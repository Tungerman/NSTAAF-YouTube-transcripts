=1
00:00
we run it on qi a few years ago yeah um
00:02
which was
00:03
there's no such thing as a fish no such
00:05
thing as a fish no seriously it's in
00:06
the oxford dictionary of underwater life
00:10
it says it right there first paragraph
00:11
no such thing as a fish
00:17
[Applause]
00:21
[Music]
00:23
hello and welcome to the pilot episode
00:26
of no such thing as a fish coming to you
00:28
from the qi offices
00:30
in covent garden my name is dan i'm
00:33
sitting with three other qils
00:34
james andy and anna and each week we're
00:37
gonna get around this microphone
00:39
and share our favorite facts from the
00:41
last seven days
00:42
so in no particular order here are the
00:45
best things we found out this week
00:47
[Applause]
00:51
okay let's start with fact number one
00:53
that comes from you james um i went this
00:55
weekend to the
00:56
um collider exhibition uh the large
00:59
hadron collider exhibition at the
01:01
science museum which was very cool
01:03
and i got fight there and the large
01:05
hadron collider
01:06
was almost turned off i think it was
01:09
turned off for a short amount of time
01:11
for what reason why do you think because
01:13
the rewiring or
01:14
the yeah maintenance yeah there's a lot
01:18
more low-fi than that apparently they
01:19
found a piece of baguette
01:21
in the machinery and it made the
01:23
temperature go up by seven degrees and
01:24
they had to turn the whole thing off
01:26
before they found the baguette if you
01:28
work with the french this will happen
01:30
i always throw my baguette into the
01:32
machine
01:34
they're actually a pest but what they
01:36
what they actually think happened is
01:38
that a bird
01:39
somehow dropped it into um into an event
01:42
or something like that and that it was
01:43
found there
01:44
but some of the physicists who were
01:45
there at the time actually thought that
01:46
maybe
01:47
um it was a time traveling bird sent
01:49
from the future
01:52
which
02:06
that's why they turned it off the job
02:08
done yeah the king's baguette
02:10
is covered in tuna mayonnaise
02:12
[Laughter]
02:14
surely someone's marketing your higgs
02:15
baguette now in paris
02:18
there was a guy wasn't there who um
02:19
broke into cern
02:21
uh he broke in uh his name was uh
02:24
how would you say this andy eloy ellua
02:28
cole
02:29
a strangely dressed match uh man he said
02:31
that he traveled
02:32
back in time to prevent the lhc from
02:35
destroying the world so they've had
02:36
a number of time traveling uh yeah well
02:38
that was one theory that the reason we
02:40
hadn't had time travelers yet was we
02:42
hadn't invented the large hadron
02:43
collider which would presumably then
02:45
be the machine that would get them back
02:49
you can't have time travelers until you
02:50
build the machine so that's why we
02:52
haven't had them in the past
02:53
well here's the final sentence of this
02:55
story mr cole as his name was uh was
02:57
taken to a secure mental health facility
02:59
in geneva but later disappeared from
03:01
himself
03:01
police are baffled but not that bothered
03:05
wait a second i should point out that
03:07
dad is on davidike.com
03:10
because i just googled him that's the
03:11
first thing that came on but this is the
03:13
talk boards it looks like they've lifted
03:14
this from they have from crave dots
03:17
don't know if that's any more reputable
03:19
but um because there was a bit of worry
03:21
at the time that
03:22
the whole universe was going to end
03:24
wasn't there yeah they thought that
03:26
because what they were actually doing
03:27
was making very very very tiny black
03:30
holes and i think in people's minds
03:32
they thought well what if they get what
03:33
if they get bigger yeah yeah but i think
03:35
what
03:35
happened i might be wrong about this
03:37
because i'm going off memory a little
03:38
bit but
03:39
they um i think the scientists said that
03:42
there was
03:42
a chance of the world ending but it was
03:45
something like
03:46
10 000 billion billion billion billion
03:48
to one chance
03:50
which is pretty much the chance of the
03:51
world ending anyway in that kind of
03:53
in that kind of time but i think they
03:55
didn't help themselves by saying that
03:57
and some
03:57
all people here is what the world's
03:59
going to win
04:00
there was a big switch on day do you
04:02
remember it was um
04:04
it was when the machine was first due to
04:05
be switched on and the bbc went to
04:07
wall-to-wall coverage of it i had to
04:08
write about it for private eye just
04:10
everyone going crazy about it and when
04:12
it didn't work for another nine months
04:14
they couldn't switch oh yeah i remember
04:15
that there was some slight problem in
04:17
the workings yeah
04:18
that's uh there was a story in the news
04:19
this week about uh the spaceship that
04:21
had been
04:22
oh yeah yeah yeah it's a lot like that
04:24
um is it called atticus
04:26
can you check what's the um it's
04:28
satellite that we sent
04:29
up that's been asleep for three years
04:31
and we sort of set an alarm on it
04:33
to wake it up yesterday absolutely yeah
04:35
and so there was a big thing where
04:36
they're all waiting
04:37
yeah and then you could you could stream
04:39
mission control in uh was it russia
04:41
maybe i'm not sure what country it
04:43
was america you could watch it what do
04:44
you mean you could you could watch
04:45
mission control as they were waiting
04:47
because it was going to be switched on
04:49
and there was an hour window where
04:51
it didn't come on so they were waiting
04:53
and then tension started getting high
04:55
and then yeah
04:56
yeah so so it was actually it wasn't too
04:59
long but yeah so there was ten minutes
05:00
where it was late
05:01
waking up and i hadn't sent any signals
05:03
back um and then they started to get
05:05
increasingly tense and if you watch the
05:06
video which i now have they suddenly
05:07
start to panic and it all goes really
05:08
silent
05:09
and then it was actually 18 minutes late
05:11
waking up because what they think
05:12
happened is
05:13
somehow the satellite put its alarm on
05:16
snooze
05:18
and just postponed his wake up cool for
05:20
18 minutes
05:21
and then which is fair enough you know
05:23
if you've been asleep for three years
05:25
you can't be expected to just bounce out
05:26
of bed
05:27
i think it was rosetta rosetta
05:30
yes that's incredible triangle has got
05:33
an awesome
05:34
solar system fact haven't you yes okay
05:37
no this is not
05:38
anna you haven't heard this yet no i
05:39
haven't i'm prepared
05:42
this has raised some controversy in the
05:44
office let's go for it
05:45
okay in 2007
05:50
the largest object in the solar system
05:53
was what do you think anna the sun
05:57
no it was a comet called comet homes
06:01
which was the the comet itself the main
06:04
body of it is three kilometers across
06:07
and it had this extraordinary explosion
06:09
at the surface and the
06:11
corona of dust they call it the uh the
06:13
comet coma
06:14
is the name for it was bigger than the
06:16
sun
06:17
wow 1.4 million out of here it was
06:21
it was 1.4 million kilometers across i
06:23
think that's and that all counted as
06:25
part of the body of the comments yes it
06:26
was one percent of the total mass of the
06:28
comet is the huge
06:29
dust because the sun is emptier than we
06:31
think it is i think that's fair to say
06:33
yeah i mean it depends on your
06:34
definition of the sun really because
06:36
there's an argument that the sun is
06:38
actually the size of the solar system
06:40
because that's as far as the
06:41
as the solar as you
06:47
the know wind goes all the way out to
06:49
there there's still particles from the
06:50
sun that are getting all the way out to
06:52
to pluto and beyond so there is an
06:54
argument that we all live
06:55
inside the sun at the moment yeah well
06:58
if that's true then then the common
06:59
thing is
07:00
the sun is the size that everyone
07:02
everyone else says it is
07:04
this comet was bigger briefly
07:07
who says that was the comment called
07:10
comet home says
07:14
okay
07:21
there's actually a body alex told me to
07:23
look this up because i cover what it's
07:24
called which is responsible for the
07:25
official non-culture
07:27
of um everything in the solar system and
07:28
it has these like most specific rules
07:30
about where everything has to be called
07:31
it's called like the internet
07:32
it's a branch of nasa um so for instance
07:34
one of its rules is that
07:36
martian craters that measure less than
07:38
60 kilometers in diameter
07:40
have to be named after villages of the
07:42
world with a population smaller than a
07:44
hundred thousand people
07:46
so they have so like tooting there's a
07:47
crater called tooting because
07:49
there's that there's yeah there is so
07:51
pleasing and the other one and this is i
07:53
think was the headline that james saw
07:54
when he came around to my computer
07:55
earlier
07:56
there is to be no penis on venus
08:01
this is this is your excuse i saw there
08:03
is no penis
08:05
and now you're making up a story
08:08
hopefully googling in case there was
08:13
[Laughter]
08:24
allowed to call anything on venus um
08:26
after anything male so everything on
08:28
venus and you look like
08:29
everything all the craters all the
08:31
mountains because
08:32
venus is i don't know because venus was
08:35
female venus is female
08:37
except this was only introduced in the
08:38
early 70s and before that they had named
08:41
the highest mountain
08:42
albert
08:46
which is called maxwell montes named
08:48
after a male physicist
08:50
but so he's sitting there on venus the
08:52
only guy
08:54
surrounded by thousands and thousands of
08:55
women and yeah you can't do that
08:57
because he's a mountain that's funny
08:59
that is brilliant it is amazing
09:01
l for ladies for the l series
09:05
yeah yeah the only man on venus
09:09
um cool okay well let's wrap up because
09:11
we've got stuff okay before we go i just
09:13
got to say if anyone wants to see the
09:14
collider exhibition it's pretty good go
09:16
down to the science museum
09:17
on until the 6th of may it costs about
09:19
10 to get in i highly recommend what do
09:21
you get to see is it um
09:22
it's just lots of facts about how it
09:24
works yeah and there's lots of
09:25
interactive stuff
09:27
yeah and do us a favor uh bring a
09:29
baguette leave it there
09:31
take a photo of some baffled scientists
09:33
trying to work out how we got in there
09:38
okay fact number two uh anna this one's
09:40
yours yeah um so for the last
09:43
month of his life us president james
09:45
garfield
09:46
ate everything through his anus
09:51
we will get letters from a lot of people
09:53
mine um
09:55
yeah i mean i wasn't there but this is
09:56
what the doctors tell me
10:00
um no so james garfield was as everyone
10:03
obviously knows
10:04
shot in july 1881 and he lived for a
10:06
further 80 days
10:08
um he was shot in the small in the like
10:10
small of his back and once in the arm so
10:12
doctors now say he would have been
10:13
out of hospital about two or three days
10:15
later but obviously because um
10:18
medicine was not as quite as advanced as
10:20
it is now in 1881 they just invited like
10:22
dozens of doctors to his bedside who all
10:24
prodded around
10:25
trying to find this bullet they didn't
10:27
know where the bullet had gone in his
10:28
body
10:29
um so they gathered round prodded about
10:31
made him worse and worse he stopped
10:32
being able to eat
10:33
and obviously if you stop being able to
10:35
consume food in those days they just
10:37
shoved it up your ass
10:38
and so that's what they did so does that
10:40
work um it does not work
10:42
no it was widely discredited in the
10:44
early 30s i think you get about an
10:45
eighth of n the nutrition from some of
10:48
the food
10:48
but there's some food that you can't
10:50
absorb at all ah what i love is the list
10:52
of
10:53
foods that he was fed in this moment
10:56
beef bouillon egg yolks
10:59
milk egg yolks egg yolks
11:02
um egg yolks it was only true for a
11:04
while because i was reading the uh the
11:06
doctor at the time his report on it
11:07
so yeah he was fed egg yolks for a bit
11:09
of time and then all the surgeons
11:11
complained that it was causing annoying
11:12
and offensive flatus
11:14
um and so they ceased feeding him egg
11:16
yolks
11:18
they stopped it because it was annoying
11:20
there yeah
11:21
not the other way thanks guys
11:25
i'd be quite happy
11:32
that's the thing as well he wasn't shut
11:34
at his mouth
11:37
presumably his mouth still works
11:45
the doctors were amazing the main doctor
11:47
in charge of saving it was called
11:48
doctor dr willard bless with two doctors
11:52
his first name was doctor
12:02
that's all i know about how what he was
12:04
fed in that time
12:05
i think maybe that was the only food
12:06
they weren't into grinding beef but he
12:08
was also given whiskey um and
12:10
drops of opium and whiskey
12:13
whiskey up his ass yeah because i mean
12:15
if you're in that sort of a state i
12:16
think
12:16
at least you want a few drams yeah it's
12:19
terrible
12:20
he was such a talented member he could
12:21
his party trick was he could write
12:23
lassen in one hand and greet with the
12:24
other simultaneously
12:25
wow he was bri he campaigned for the
12:27
presidency in more than one language
12:29
some places he campaigned in english
12:30
some places you spoke in german he was
12:32
this immensely no
12:34
he was president for four months and
12:36
then he was shot
12:37
and then he lingered for another three
12:38
months like no matter what like you
12:41
could write
12:42
greek with your left and light it with
12:43
your mind
12:45
the fact you could eat through your anus
12:48
will forever overshadow
12:50
it all i actually looked up um because i
12:53
thought uh
12:53
i i knew andy said earlier that you were
12:56
you had a list of things that he ate i
12:58
thought it'd be interesting to look up
13:00
of what his favorite foods were
13:03
so that if i was there i'd be like i'm
13:05
going to try and get you
13:06
like a sneaky dish on the side you know
13:10
uh so his favorite food was um squirrel
13:12
soup
13:14
and actually um there was a guy called
13:17
crook um
13:18
and he really wanted to cook squirrel
13:20
soup for the president but they needed
13:21
him to be a bit better
13:22
i think to the point where he was eating
13:23
again with his mouth that kind of good
13:26
um and they were given permission to
13:28
shoot squirrels on the grounds of the
13:29
soldiers homes
13:30
in order to get the squirrels in order
13:33
to do it and he loved milk
13:35
really loved milk and there was a
13:36
company called the adams express company
13:38
from baltimore
13:39
and they actually sent a cow to the
13:41
white house so they could milk it every
13:43
day so that he could get fresh milk
13:45
uh while he was dying he was shocked he
13:47
was given milk
13:48
in the manner we've described yeah but
13:50
yeah well
13:51
and you uh you were saying that um
13:53
alexander graham bell was
13:55
there while he was dying yes so i mean i
13:57
initially thought about phrasing
13:59
this fact as alexander grahamville
14:01
actually killed president james garfield
14:03
and then i felt like there might be
14:04
lawsuits from his family
14:05
but because they'd lost the bullet and
14:07
cause in in his body and because
14:09
coincidentally alexander graham bell had
14:11
been developing the metal detector at
14:13
the time
14:14
they invited him along and he tried to
14:16
find the bullet in
14:17
in his body but failed on account of the
14:20
fact that um
14:21
he was on a bed with a lot of metal bed
14:23
springs and so
14:25
they obviously thought he'd been machine
14:27
gunned down
14:32
they're everywhere there's something i
14:34
can do it's just incredible that
14:36
the i mean the genius of inventing a
14:38
metal detector and then not thinking to
14:40
remove
14:41
the massive source of metal
14:46
imagine like quietly alexander granville
14:48
was like i think
14:49
the president is a robot that would have
14:52
been his discovery
14:54
i'm not sure if james scott field was a
14:56
robot he might have been a sea cucumber
14:58
because they
14:59
actually do eat through their anuses do
15:01
they yeah
15:02
they found this out quite recently
15:03
because you know that they breathe
15:05
you know they breathe through the anuses
15:07
they they pull water in
15:09
and then push it out and the oxygenated
15:11
um water helps them to breathe
15:13
and they thought well maybe they take in
15:15
food there as well
15:17
and they found out that they have a gut
15:18
in the middle and they eat through the
15:20
mouth and through their anus
15:22
so it comes in from both sides that's
15:24
pretty cool isn't it that is cool it's
15:26
amazing
15:27
yeah and can they taste it do they have
15:29
taste buds in their anus do you think
15:31
i don't know if they have taste buds in
15:32
there well james you found out what else
15:34
you can taste with
15:35
didn't you oh yeah you can taste with
15:37
your testicles well
15:40
you have taste receptors in your
15:42
testicles no one's quite sure what
15:44
they're for
15:45
but you also have smell receptors in
15:47
your lungs
15:48
and the reason we do know why they're
15:50
there because if you get a really
15:52
terrible smell
15:53
and your receptors in your lungs can can
15:56
smell it
15:56
then it will close up your esophagus and
15:58
stop anything poisonous from going into
16:00
your body
16:00
but and as far as i know no one's found
16:03
out yet why we have
16:04
taste receptors in their testicles maybe
16:06
someone will tweet me
16:07
at egg shapes if you know why we can
16:09
taste with our testicles
16:11
[Music]
16:13
okay uh let's move on to fact three that
16:16
is james your facts
16:18
so my fact is in 2013 six people in the
16:22
u.s
16:22
named their child mushroom
16:24
[Laughter]
16:27
i mean i just love that i love the kind
16:29
of thing which we do on qi which you
16:31
sometimes just get a load of data and
16:32
mine through it for the funny bits
16:35
which is where this came from which is a
16:36
big list of all the baby names in the
16:38
america
16:39
mushroom i mean it's what would possess
16:42
you
16:43
to i think it sounds quite nice it does
16:45
sound cool actually
16:46
mushroom mushroom hey mushrooms sort
16:54
i think it's weird because i have a mild
16:55
mushroom phobia
16:58
yeah i find them like very disgusting
17:02
things
17:05
it's just the way that they reproduce
17:06
with spas and they grow on dead things
17:08
and stuff i just fight i think a lot of
17:10
people don't
17:10
yeah don't like there's something dead
17:12
about them yeah
17:13
and it's a weird one that you um i find
17:15
because my friend hates mushrooms as
17:17
well
17:18
and if i have a pizza with them we have
17:20
to remove them yeah yeah well you know
17:22
ash who did the theme tune for our show
17:24
oh yeah um
17:25
mps uh but um you kind of have to
17:28
respect
17:29
a hatred of mushroom or a fear of
17:30
mushroom in the same way you respect
17:32
someone's religious
17:33
beliefs
17:36
i really feel like like if someone
17:38
doesn't like mushrooms i really have to
17:39
be like oh okay
17:40
i appreciate that i will remove it from
17:43
any of the foods
17:45
that we will have in this house from
17:46
here on in yeah it's true mushrooms you
17:48
know they really hate it
17:49
yeah they hate it with a passion like
17:51
really
17:52
it's a bit like vegetarianism because
17:54
you're excluding an entire
17:56
um area of the mushrooms of their own
17:59
kingdom
18:00
yeah yeah kingdom aren't they yeah fungi
18:03
or a kingdom in the same way that
18:04
animals and plants are but if you think
18:06
actually uh mushrooms are more closely
18:09
related to
18:09
animals than they are to plants are they
18:12
yeah no
18:13
yeah that's true how how hasn't they
18:16
branched off
18:17
what animal-like activities do they take
18:20
part
18:21
of mushrooms hunting
18:22
[Laughter]
18:25
the mushroom approaches
18:29
really slowly
18:30
[Laughter]
18:34
i love names i'm obsessed with with
18:36
because i i always find them
18:38
particularly in pop culture i mean it's
18:40
it's definitely been the rise
18:41
of the celebrity world that suddenly
18:43
they just it's like celebrities are
18:45
going
18:46
i've called my child mushroom what are
18:47
you gonna do about it everyone's like
18:49
well nothing good i'll catch you later
18:51
we'll do this
18:52
out like yeah um because uh my two
18:55
favorite ones from recent times are
18:57
jermaine jackson of the jackson five has
19:00
changed
19:00
his surname from jackson to jackson
19:06
so he's uh he's taken an apostrophe no
19:09
so it's instead of
19:10
jackson with an o n at the end it's u.n
19:13
so it's jack's son because he doesn't
19:15
want to be associated anymore
19:17
with the jackson brand
19:21
and he held a press conference because
19:23
he was talking about his new album and
19:24
he announced it at his press conference
19:25
he said by the way
19:26
i have changed my name from here on in i
19:29
want to be
19:30
now known as jermaine jackson not
19:32
jermaine jackson
19:35
and so they asked him why have you done
19:36
this and he said
19:38
i don't want to talk about it we don't
19:41
know his actual proper reasoning that
19:43
everyone just thinks that he wants to
19:44
get away from it
19:45
i have this big list of american
19:48
people's names
19:49
yeah like baby names from 2013.
19:52
and these are all um male children with
19:55
five people uh named these names okay
19:58
in america so vader dorothy yeah
20:01
yeah that's a good name as well and also
20:03
vader was a wwf wrestler
20:05
of course yeah is there anyone called
20:07
garth vader
20:09
just accidentally with a g
20:18
don't worry it happens
20:19
[Laughter]
20:31
yeah so five boys called uh vader five
20:34
boys called kestrel which is quite a
20:35
nice name
20:36
yeah kestrel's game five boys named
20:38
lucifer
20:39
not as nice oh that's an odd one yeah
20:41
yeah it means light bearing
20:44
i mean they could have said that he
20:45
started out well he was an angel
20:47
to start that's that is weird uh five
20:49
boys called sophie
20:53
and also romance and naomi they were
20:56
boys with those names
20:57
oh isn't that romance is very nice oh
21:01
obama's mum do you know what her name
21:03
was
21:04
no this really shocked me when i read
21:06
this i was reading his autobiography
21:07
and because remember the time when he
21:09
was initially being nominated everyone
21:11
went on about his name like it was a big
21:12
thing his name
21:14
and so i'm surprised no one picked up on
21:16
this his mother's first name
21:17
was stanley stanley obama wow
21:20
she was called stan the man at school
21:24
actually in in the olden days obviously
21:26
names sometimes do change sex if you
21:28
um i looked at the 1880 census and there
21:31
were 13
21:32
uh girls in america called frank
21:38
roosevelt oh was it roosevelt had an
21:40
aunt called frank one of the american
21:42
presidents had an argument there
21:48
last year in america there were 31
21:51
johanns
21:52
because they presume it's a tough word
21:55
yeah and also there were um one thousand
21:58
four one thousand four hundred and
21:59
thirty six people called israel
22:02
and sixty-four called israel is real
22:06
man i also i uh i love people who
22:09
have a name that kind of means that you
22:11
can do a lot with it
22:13
uh like mike love of the beach boys so
22:16
love being his surname he's obviously
22:18
gone great i can put
22:19
love onto everything so he really he's
22:21
got four unreleased albums
22:23
they're really bad um so the first album
22:25
was called first love
22:26
second album was called second second
22:28
love uh country love oh nice he missed a
22:31
trick there yeah
22:32
uh then there was looking back with love
22:35
uh this is great the that one was
22:37
released that one made it so the third
22:39
unreleased one was
22:40
unleash the love and then this is the
22:43
best one at all his fourth unreleased
22:45
album anyone ever bash
22:46
what pun title you might love
22:49
that's good yeah 15 love
22:56
um the power of love that's good but no
22:59
where is the love we're just naming
23:00
other songs you can't
23:01

23:22
done a lot of work on qa in the past and
23:25
her
23:25
um stepfather i think is called
23:29
he was called james brown and he got so
23:32
annoyed with people making jokes about
23:34
him that he changed his name
23:35
to dan brown who then became the most
23:39
famous archer of all time
23:41
that's so good i love that one that's
23:43
great
23:44
[Music]
23:48
fact number four
23:51
okay fact number four is i i've was
23:54
talking to this uh historian
23:56
the other day on twitter because i don't
23:58
know if you saw on friday last week on
24:00
twitter uh
24:01
it just went nuts with people historians
24:03
talking about alfred the great bones
24:04
being found
24:05
because it's we haven't found many
24:07
monarchs right generally
24:09
yeah yeah well we famously felt rich of
24:10
the third richard iii about two years
24:12
ago and so they're really excited
24:13
because
24:14
they dug up an area where they thought
24:15
alfred the great was meant to be buried
24:17
turns out he wasn't buried there
24:18
uh and then they went to a museum
24:20
storage where they had a bunch of other
24:21
bones that they assumed to be animal
24:22
bones and they found his pelvis bone now
24:24
so we have alfred the great pelvis bone
24:26
or do we they don't quite know where's
24:28
the rest of him
24:30
we're not sure but we have a pelvis bone
24:31
which feels just really like you know
24:33
all those
24:33
like classic um jesus's grandmother's
24:36
head and
24:37
all those relics of the past i have a
24:39
fact about pelvis phones
24:41
do you hear it yeah yeah yeah weirdly
24:42
enough absolutely okay so um
24:44
there's a a department in the natural
24:47
history museum
24:48
that if you find something weird in your
24:50
garden or whatever you can give it to
24:52
them and they'll tell you what it is
24:53
and it's usually people who find what
24:55
they think is like jelly from space or
24:58
crypto zoology things jelly from space
25:01
yeah yeah
25:02
well it's what people think you know
25:03
what is it though okay
25:05
that wasn't my fact but so jelly from
25:07
space is
25:08
um whenever there is a meteorite people
25:11
seem to find this jelly on the floor
25:13
and there's been for hundreds of years
25:15
people have thought that the two are um
25:17
to do with each other yeah nobody knows
25:19
what it's from it's called star jelly
25:22
um and nobody really knows what it is
25:24
there's lots of theories
25:25
there's jelly that we don't know what it
25:27
is i think
25:28
yeah i've heard of it i've heard of stir
25:31
jelly but i didn't i've never researched
25:33
what it is you've not researched you
25:35
know about this mysterious jelly sauce i
25:37
heard about it
25:38
i thought well i'll just leave that be
25:40
i'm sure
25:45
okay so as well as getting weird jelly
25:47
they also get what people think of jet
25:49
uh dragon heads yeah and whenever they
25:51
find a dragon head
25:52
it is usually the pelvis of a sea bird
25:54
like a puffin
25:55
because apparently as puffins pelvis
25:57
looks like a dragon's head
25:59
that's great wow so all my pelvis all
26:02
claims of dragon heads turn out to be
26:04
pelvis yeah the ones that these guys get
26:06
yeah because do you know that this thing
26:08
about um
26:08
you find people thought that you would
26:11
have one-eyed monsters so they're like
26:13
what they what do you call these
26:14
monsters with one eye and the theory is
26:17
that what they actually did is they
26:18
would find the skulls of
26:20
elephants and were the yeah yeah the
26:23
elephant
26:24
skulls actually look like they have a
26:25
big hole in the middle like it would be
26:27
one
26:27
eye hole and that's where the theory
26:29
sometimes comes from well the best thing
26:30
that you've told me that i've been
26:32
telling everyone for the
26:33
past i know two weeks is that the
26:35
majority of
26:36
um sightings photos taken of sea
26:39
monsters
26:40
uh turn out not to be sea monsters but
26:42
in most cases
26:43
uh the penises of grey whales because
26:45
they mate at the surface that's amazing
26:47
today's giant
26:48
whales they always mate at the surface
26:50
and they always mate in threesomes
26:52
two males and a female which means that
26:54
there's always one spare penis floating
26:55
around the surface
26:57
looking out at the top of the wall yeah
26:59
if people google this if you're at home
27:00
listening and you google
27:02
gray whale penis you will see it
27:08
but it's very true i've looked at it and
27:09
they the majority of photos that you
27:10
will see of people claiming to have
27:12
caught a sea monster on camera
27:13
they've just they haven't but anyway so
27:16
on on twitter when i was talking to um
27:18
greg jenner francesca stavrocapolo all
27:20
these historians they they started off
27:22
by going wow alfred the great
27:24
an interesting find potentially and then
27:25
they're all now saying
27:27
not so much an interesting find like it
27:29
probably will turn out not to be
27:31
but it got me i just wanted to look into
27:33
it because i didn't know much about it
27:34
and it led me to the story of how
27:35
richard iii's phones were found
27:37
recently they were found in a car park
27:39
in leicester they were found in the car
27:40
park in leicester
27:41
so what i didn't know we all know that
27:43
exactly it was a very big phone what i
27:45
didn't know is the person who found it
27:47
philippa langley do you do does anyone
27:49
here know
27:50
about philippa langley so you do james
27:52
anna do you know that okay
27:53
what would you assume the person who
27:55
found uh richard iii's bones
27:58
what does for a professional you assume
27:59
she's an archaeologist although
28:01
i have read something about her that
28:02
tells me she's not and also i assume you
28:04
wouldn't ask me if she
28:05
were you you are you you're like shirley
28:07
i'm gonna do this
28:08
archaeologist yeah so she's not an
28:10
archaeologist she's a screenwriter
28:12
she's uh she's been writing for the last
28:14
seven years
28:15
a story you know a script about richard
28:18
iii and she got involved in research
28:20
and so she started going to all the
28:22
places where potentially richard iii was
28:23
supposed to be buried
28:25
she went to leicester and she went to a
28:27
spot where it was a loose end
28:29
it didn't look like where they said he
28:31
might be buried where he wasn't as she
28:33
was leaving from
28:34
effectively a disappointing trip another
28:35
one over the course of seven years
28:37
she saw a car park on the side and got
28:40
an
28:40
uncontrollable urge to go inside so she
28:43
went into the car park
28:45
and she was like i feel like the king is
28:47
here
28:48
but she left it she went off she came
28:49
back a year later
28:51
she felt the same urge and she saw on
28:53
the ground
28:54
a gigantic r in red writing there's a
28:58
huge
28:58
r on the floor and she said that's where
29:00
he's buried now the r is a painted r for
29:02
reserved on a car park
29:04
she's not a crazy person yeah i know and
29:06
so she said it's here
29:07
no one believed her she raised 34 000
29:10
pounds
29:10
for them to dig it up she got channel
29:12
four to come and film it and they dug in
29:14
the spot and richard iii was there
29:16
and it was a psychic um what was the
29:19
word that i said to you earlier a
29:20
pre-sentiment
29:21
a psychic pre-sentiment she just went
29:23
this is where he is but what you don't
29:24
know is that she's actually been going
29:26
all over the country digging up holes
29:27
for 20 years doing exactly anything
29:31
on it yeah every pothole so does that
29:34
mean dan that you believe
29:35
that psychic no not at all i just think
29:37
that's one of the most wonderful
29:39
like that story could not get any better
29:40
a giant r like an x marks
29:43
the initial of the king you know that
29:45
the ministry of defense spent like 20
29:47
000 pounds trying to prove that
29:48
um esp existed only like even in the
29:51
last 20 years they did that
29:52
really yes why were they trying to prove
29:54
that well i always think the reason they
29:56
do it is because they think if it does
29:58
we want to be first
30:00
and they think the russians are probably
30:01
going into this you know
30:03
so is everyone else we might as well
30:04
have a go at it i could have told them
30:06
that it didn't in fact i tried to tell
30:07
them really hard
30:11
what was strange when they found richard
30:12
the third i thought is we'd actually run
30:14
on qi a few years ago
30:16
whether richard had a hunchback and we
30:19
said
30:19
you know he didn't it was all made up by
30:21
shakespeare and people who wanted to
30:23
deface him after his death
30:24
but then when they found him they found
30:26
that he did have like an arch to his yes
30:28
an s-shaped um spine
30:32
is what they said um but no it's it's i
30:35
i just find that fascinating because i
30:37
love it when things are found by people
30:38
who shouldn't be finding the thing in
30:40
question but convinced they're going to
30:42
find it yeah i mean that's the only
30:43
instance
30:44
is it maybe something to do with the
30:45
fact that just like you usually do dig
30:47
up ground like either it's agricultural
30:48
ground so you dig it up or you're like
30:50
putting buildings in so you dig it up so
30:51
car parks
30:52
don't really need foundation so they're
30:54
just things that haven't been discovered
30:56
yet
30:56
not sure because yeah there are quite a
30:57
lot of discoveries in fact i think we
30:59
should ask at some point
31:01
um the question what vital
31:04
archaeological
31:05
discovery was made under a car park in
31:07
leicester last year
31:09
um i'm going to say that was the body of
31:12
richard iii
31:13
last year oh james you fell right into
31:16
that
31:18
last year yeah last year um no no i
31:21
didn't
31:21
yeah another car park in leicester uh
31:23
same team who
31:24
dug up the richard iii after the psychic
31:26
woman pointed them in the right
31:27
direction
31:28
um dug up this um ancient roman cemetery
31:30
which like revealed a whole bunch of
31:32
stuff about how romans used to bury
31:33
pagans and um
31:34
religious people and christians together
31:37
and that was cool yeah just revealed
31:38
this
31:38
another car park just dig up all the car
31:41
parks
31:42
yeah that one had romans

00:04

we want to say first of all thanks to
00:30
everyone who listened to the first
00:31
episode that we put out last week
00:33
got huge numbers uh we weren't expecting
00:35
it and really great feedback
00:37
there's a lot of technical hiccups that
00:39
we are sorting out we're gonna get on
00:40
with this second podcast now my name is
00:42
dan schreiber i am sitting here with
00:44
three other qils james harkin anna
00:47
chazinski
00:47
and andy murray and once again we're
00:49
huddled around our microphone
00:51
and these are the best facts that we
00:53
found out from the last seven days
00:54
so in no particular order here we go
01:00
okay first fact and let's go with you
01:02
anna
01:03
oh yeah i found out this week that the
01:04
first ever sandwich that we know about
01:07
uh contained wine yep it was a wine
01:10
sandwich
01:12
bread with wine it had all this stuff in
01:14
it but wine was one of the ingredients
01:15
yeah so um
01:16
the first recorded sandwich was actually
01:17
more of a wrap um it was called a
01:19
correction it was invented by hillel
01:21
who's a jewish
01:23
jewish religious leader from like 100 bc
01:25
so the jews have been like at this
01:27
festival eating
01:28
wine and figs and spices and stuff all
01:30
mixed up together for about a thousand
01:31
years
01:31
and he decided to just shove it between
01:34
some flatbread
01:35
and uh part of the concoction was why in
01:37
the mix so this isn't the earl of
01:39
sandwiches
01:40
invention invention i'm doing the
01:42
inverted commas sign there when i say
01:44
that so
01:44
this is way before that this is this is
01:46
way before that the earl of sandwich
01:48
claims
01:48
credit where it's not g really yeah i've
01:51
never heard that and that's actually
01:52
probably i don't think we've done that
01:53
jenna gone qi who invented the sandwich
01:55
have we thought yeah but what did what
01:57
did the other sandwich do
01:58
if anything i think he um was the first
02:00
person to
02:01
i mean he probably wasn't but he was
02:03
known for shoving meat between bread in
02:04
the west
02:05
people say it's because he was a like a
02:08
gracious gambler
02:09
yeah well there's no way that he
02:10
invented the sandwich anyway is that
02:12
because it's like
02:13
obviously for like you say forever
02:15
people have been putting
02:16
things in between two slices yeah it's
02:18
so obvious i think
02:19
i like this idea of people just putting
02:22
their name to something which has been
02:23
invented for so long like in 1999 in
02:26
japan
02:27
um someone patented curry
02:30
wow yeah what happened was the very next
02:33
year 80 people
02:34
tried to patent pizza after this
02:37
well there was a guy in australia who
02:38
successfully painted in the wheel right
02:41
oh yeah successfully yeah successfully
02:44
but that was actually the first wheel in
02:48
australia
02:50
yeah he did he successfully did it and
02:52
it made it past and he was
02:53
he did it as a kind of uh parody protest
02:58
to show how things were getting through
03:00
the net when it came to patents
03:02
because i think too a lot of people
03:03
getting stuff stolen in australia
03:05
uh as an invention and so okay yeah he's
03:08
successful i remember the guy
03:09
um in the 70s who patented the comb over
03:13
the other one like obviously that's been
03:14
happening forever but
03:16
yeah this is from the uh this is from
03:19
the wikipedia about the sandwich full
03:20
disclosure but what it says is
03:22
before being known as sandwiches this
03:23
food combination seems to simply have
03:25
been known as
03:26
bread and meat
03:30
or
03:36
hang on i just thought that would work
03:37
for all fillings yeah you just bread and
03:39
yeah bread and cheese i'm just gonna go
03:42
and have a cheese and ham
03:44
bread and cheese
03:48
i was thinking about um because the idea
03:51
of wine going into
03:52
a sandwich uh is it's a nice thing about
03:55
what else goes into a sandwich that you
03:57
would not expect but then i started
03:58
thinking i bet there's a lot of stuff
03:59
that goes into wine
04:00
that we don't expect but um there's a
04:02
nettle wine
04:04
so nettle being those stinging plants
04:06
yeah so you can get that so that's
04:07
a there's cannabis wine which is
04:08
available which has become really
04:10
popular in the us
04:11
this is my favorite one it's a chilean
04:13
wine um and it's been created using
04:15
meteorite
04:16
formed during the birth of the solar
04:17
system what yeah so it's uh it's a
04:20
it's been developed by a guy called ian
04:21
hutchin he's an english guy working in
04:23
chile
04:24
it's a meteorite that's believed to have
04:25
crashed in the atacama desert
04:28
in northern chile about six thousand
04:29
years ago uh and it submerged in the
04:31
wine during the fermented um
04:33
fermentation process yeah so it's a it's
04:36
a meteorite wine i mean that's wow
04:38
that's extremely cool yeah i really
04:40
wanted it in china you can get something
04:42
called three penis wine
04:44
can you guess what's in that two penises
04:46
uh no three penises
04:49
it does contain three different penises
04:53
of whatever okay
04:54
so deer yeah deer is one of them and
04:56
it's supposed to be like a general
04:58
pick-me-up kind of a
04:59
deer maybe a bird one of the birds with
05:01
a penis yeah most birds don't have
05:03
penises today
05:04
97 of bird species have no penises
05:07
yeah but the other three
05:12
the argentinian lake dutch 45
05:14
centimeters and
05:16
and curled and that's just it yeah
05:19
if you um if you're listening to this at
05:21
home uh google
05:22
argentinian lake duck penis and you'll
05:25
see exactly what andy's talking about it
05:27
is
05:27
epic wow well what's the third penis
05:31
i can't remember history penis
05:34
lucky dip penis penis dude
05:39
there is one other wine it's a japanese
05:41
wine which uh is called japanese feces
05:43
wine
05:45
it's known as tong and it's a primarily
05:48
made using human or animal feces
05:53
what's the third kind of feces
05:58
i'm going to give you one i'm going to
05:59
trump that even for a disgusting wine
06:02
in 1495 it was reported that the spanish
06:05
were mixing
06:06
the blood of lepers with their wine and
06:08
feeding it to the french is a
06:10
early kind of biological warfare that's
06:13
pretty ranked as they had
06:14
war at the time yeah it wasn't the
06:16
pre-emptive okay
06:17
so sorry watts leopard's blood but it
06:20
probably wouldn't have done any
06:21
harm no no because yes 90 percent of
06:24
people 95
06:25
are immune to hudson's disease hansen's
06:28
disease or leprosy anyway
06:29
and a lot of people will probably miss
06:31
identifying leprosy even then as other
06:33
skin conditions
06:34
um i'd i'd really like to quickly say a
06:36
word for the about the earl of sandwich
06:38
um because i love him it's actually the
06:40
current olive sandwich i wanted to
06:41
mention the 11th earl of sandwich who's
06:43
direct descendant of the olive sandwich
06:45
because
06:45
he so he's obviously thought i'm the
06:47
earl of sandwich
06:49
and i've got this son called orlando so
06:51
he's got orlando who's going to be the
06:52
earth of sandwich
06:53
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
06:55
go and set up a sandwich shop
06:57
and go into business with this guy
06:59
called robert earl
07:00
and it's going to be in orlando and so
07:02
that's what he did so the current earl
07:04
of sandwich owns a sandwich shop in
07:05
disneyland orlando
07:06
called orlando bloomers
07:10
it should be it's called the earl of
07:12
sandwich the good thing about um the
07:14
disney london
07:15
um tokyo and you'll know this better
07:17
than me andy but
07:18
didn't the not one of the north korean
07:21
um
07:21
kim jong un kim jong-il's three sons was
07:25
disinherited for going to one of the
07:27
disneylands
07:28
really right he had three sons and the
07:31
first two botched it
07:32
and i can't remember how the other one
07:33
did but kim jong-nam
07:35
is the eldest son of kim jong-il and he
07:38
was detained in japan with a fraudulent
07:42
passport in 2001 he was trying to
07:45
pass himself off as a dominican named
07:47
pang xiong which translates as fat bear
07:50
in chinese and so they deported him but
07:53
he was trying to visit tokyo disneyland
07:55
with his family i got told the other day
07:58
that
07:59
it was as someone i know went to south
08:01
korea
08:02
and they stood at the border of south
08:04
korea north korea
08:05
and apparently what you see when you're
08:07
at the south looking at the north
08:09
is a huge cardboard cutout of a city
08:12
that north korea has put up
08:13
to give the impression that they're a
08:14
huge metropolis from
08:16
south korea yeah they're called potemkin
08:19
towns don't they uh yeah
08:21
yeah but it's just it's like literally
08:22
like imagine the hollywood sign but done
08:24
as a ginormous looking city
08:25
so that's what you see when you when
08:27
what happens when it rains
08:29
what's made of like i'm sure they
08:30
laminated it or something oh yeah i
08:32
think yeah yeah
08:35
at the border where they both work that
08:37
was where there was a lot of recent
08:38
tension and they shut down they're
08:39
called the kaisong industrial area oh
08:41
yeah and actually workers from both
08:43
countries go into it every day thousands
08:44
of them work together
08:46
so there's this one weird point of
08:47
contact between the two countries
08:50
my favorite fact about that part of the
08:51
world is it's called the demilitarized
08:53
zone
08:54
isn't it yes but it's the world's most
08:56
militarized zone
08:57
yeah why isn't that in alana's marsette
09:01
song
09:03
she missed out so many opportunities
09:05
didn't scum
09:12
[Applause]
09:16
okay let's move on to fact two james uh
09:18
this is your fact
09:19
yeah i like this one it's um in 2003
09:22
three people in mexico
09:23
died of acne so i love that i'm pretty
09:27
sure you can't
09:27
die of acne i don't know how they died
09:30
this just came from a list of
09:32
the ways that people died so it's on
09:34
nationmaster.com
09:36
and it gives all of the mortality um
09:39
stats for all the different countries
09:41
and so if you looked for people dying of
09:43
acne there were seven
09:44
deaths worldwide three of which occurred
09:47
in mexico
09:48
and what i think it is it's just the way
09:50
that they do their stats and other
09:52
countries might have people dying of the
09:53
same thing but they don't say it's of
09:55
acne so they just died with acne
10:00
let's just say because i can see that
10:02
and otherwise
10:03
it looks to me like you died of being a
10:05
five foot six male yeah
10:08
yeah maybe they just they have to write
10:10
they have to tick a box of what they
10:12
died with them
10:12
and acne gets right to the very top and
10:15
they're just like oh it's the first
10:17
yeah an ailment right at the top is odd
10:20
vodka does he know
10:21
so yeah it's happening to be killed by
10:23
an aardvark yeah
10:24
death they do have a list of people who
10:27
were killed by animals
10:28
27 worldwide in 2003 people killed
10:32
by contact with millipedes which is
10:34
pretty cool poisonous millipedes
10:36
uh yeah venomous ones and i think five
10:38
of those were in el salvador
10:40
i seem to remember you telling me ages
10:42
ago that in australia no one's died
10:46
but no one's ever died in australia it's
10:48
really interesting yeah they just but we
10:49
don't have acne in australia
10:52
but um that no one bitten by a spider or
10:54
a snake has died in the last
10:56
50 years it's certainly been a long time
10:57
since a spider bite killed anyone
10:59
because
11:00
they have very good anti-venom now in
11:02
australia
11:03
i think it was the 1980s and i just
11:05
remember looking this up because i got
11:06
paranoid that i'd been bitten by
11:08
a black spider in in tasmania
11:11
pretty sure that i was going to be the
11:12
next case wow what we do a lot on qi is
11:15
find like people with funny deaths
11:17
and i don't think that's bad because
11:19
death is just a part of people of life
11:21
and you know we all die and
11:23
if it can be quite a funny thing then
11:24
that's good so
11:26
you could have been in one of those
11:27
lists of you could have been a stat
11:29
famous you would have liked it it would
11:30
have been announced in the qi office and
11:32
you would have been like that's awesome
11:33
what a great one that's going on
11:36
i i almost had a death which i thought
11:38
if if it happened
11:40
it would have made a nice list for you
11:42
well when i was living in hampstead we
11:44
got evacuated from our apartment one day
11:46
because
11:47
police were outside they didn't even
11:48
tell us but we went outside and then
11:49
they didn't let us back in
11:50
and i was like what's going on and they
11:52
said we found in the basement of your
11:53
flat an unexploded world war ii bomb
11:56
and so they had people inside uh
11:58
detonating the bomb
12:00
but it struck me that had that had gone
12:02
off the person calling my parents
12:04
the police officer would have had to
12:05
have said your son's met with a tragic
12:07
accident
12:08
and so how did he die he well he was
12:10
blown up who did this
12:12
we believe it to be the work of the
12:13
nazis i would have become a victim of
12:16
world war
12:17
ii i think that's hitler would have
12:19
killed me i have an even worse one than
12:20
that because there was a russian psychic
12:22
in the 80s who
12:24
wanted to prove that he was psychic and
12:26
so he stood in front of a moving train
12:28
and tried to stop it with his mind
12:30
and was killed by the train oh my god i
12:32
have one i have one death which
12:34
i'd like to share please wow this is the
12:36
man who introduced the
12:38
camel to australia oh yeah his name is
12:40
john ainsworth horrocks
12:42
and he died in 1846 and he brought the
12:45
first
12:46
camels there because they were used to
12:47
build the railways and the
12:49
result is now that there are a million
12:51
feral camels in australia
12:52
um but anyway the man who introduced him
12:54
john ain's with horrocks was killed
12:55
by his own camel what he trampled to
12:59
death no he was riding it
13:01
and he was reloading his gun it sort of
13:04
lurched a bit
13:04
as he did so and the gun went off
13:08
blasted him in the arm and in the body
13:10
he lived four days during which he
13:12
ordered the camel to be shot
13:18
i looked at them so acne just because i
13:21
was so skeptical about the idea of acne
13:23
killing you
13:23
um so and then got really caught up in
13:26
theories about acne from the 19th
13:28
century what caused it so for like 150
13:30
years they were referred to as chastity
13:32
pustules
13:33
because it was thought that the reason
13:35
you had acne was because you weren't
13:36
having
13:37
sex and so like doctors wrote so i got
13:40
this quote from a doctor in about eight
13:42
the 1830s it is a fact that this
13:44
affection disappears in young girls
13:46
immediately after marriage
13:47
and that is especially seen in young men
13:48
who observe a rigorous chastity
13:50
um and so they thought well so first of
13:52
all doctors recommend that you marry as
13:53
soon as possible to get rid of them
13:55
um and then they thought another way of
13:57
like alleviating it was to give people
14:00
laxatives
14:01
because that i guess like i don't know
14:04
in a similar way but weirdly they do
14:06
actually work to cure acne
14:07
so they try laxatives and laxatives do
14:09
work okay actually comes
14:10
can i tell you my acne things it comes
14:12
from the greek word
14:13
knee on meaning i know or i scrape
14:17
oh really yeah i have another cool death
14:19
here this was um
14:20
a guy called morton norbury and in 1910
14:24
all i know about him
14:25
is he was killed after an argument over
14:27
who possessed the most handsome
14:28
moustache
14:32
that's such a good thing that's
14:33
wonderful what's his name molten norway
14:36
it's a great day he sounds so like a guy
14:37
with a huge moustache
14:45
okay uh time for fact number three that
14:48
is my fact this week i
14:49
bought a copy of there's a new book out
14:51
called this is improbable two by mark
14:53
abrams mark abrams is the founder of the
14:55
nobel prizes he's also a good kind of qi
14:58
family friend
14:58
we love him we've he's been on museum of
15:00
curiosity we often do
15:02
talks at his ignoble tours uh one's
15:04
going to be happening yesterday if you
15:06
um go on to
15:06
if you check out uh mark abraham he's at
15:09
mark abraham's i'll check out my
15:11
egg shape we'll post up when we're going
15:12
to be appearing in that
15:14
so he's so this book is basically a
15:16
collection he runs as well as the
15:18
nobel prizes a magazine which is called
15:20
the annals of improbable research and
15:22
it's a kind of a collection of all the
15:23
greatest
15:24
research projects have been undertaken
15:26
by scientists around the world he
15:27
collects them rewrites them and
15:28
and so i'm reading the book at the
15:30
moment and there was one story which
15:32
it's not so much a fact but i i really
15:34
like the idea of it it's all the other
15:35
notable einsteins out there his point
15:38
being that it's very hard to have the
15:39
surname einstein if you work in science
15:41
because
15:43
there's a there's quite a famous one who
15:44
worked in science and
15:46
he often overshadows the rest of them so
15:48
the most notable ones that are out there
15:50
is
15:50
emmy einstein who has set an equation
15:53
that predicts the composition
15:55
of a pork carcass there's also a lady
15:58
called rosemary einstein
15:59
who she and two other colleagues at the
16:02
university of leeds
16:03
investigated the use of cannabis and
16:05
alcohol and tobacco by 300 young persons
16:07
at the university
16:08
so these these are two people who've
16:10
published reports that have been quite
16:11
successful in the scientific community
16:13
but it did get me thinking about other
16:15
namesakes other people with incredible
16:18
shadows to jump over uh and
16:21
and yeah it must be hard i'll maybe open
16:24
some doors or maybe
16:25
like it just puts a lot of pressure on
16:27
you i think you're right i think it does
16:29
open doors
16:30
so are there any other obamas out there
16:31
at the moment at the moment not really i
16:34
mean
16:34
there's a prime minister in um i can't
16:36
remember what country but he's
16:38
obama and he's currently in power really
16:40
yeah wow
16:41
yeah i don't think he's related but um
16:43
he's i'll see if it's not actually obama
16:45
just secretly running a thing on the
16:46
side i have one found an obama which i
16:49
think is
16:50
okay uh better than barack
16:53
obama yes obama um no way yep it's the
16:55
city of obama in japan
16:57
oh yes don't come on okay i'll give you
17:00
a chance
17:00
it's got a population of 32 000 so
17:02
already that's pretty good
17:04
yeah i imagine they'll be quite
17:04
productive and they make 80 of japan's
17:07
total
17:07
lacquered chopsticks oh that is great
17:10
that is great
17:11
yeah so when can when can the president
17:13
say he's done that made 80
17:15
of japan's lack of chopsticks he can't i
17:17
don't know he's working two jobs as it
17:18
is
17:21
but um yeah i mean it's it is one of
17:23
those things we all have namesake so you
17:25
james harkin have a james yeah there is
17:27
there's another james harkin who writes
17:29
for the for the guardian i think or some
17:31
other newspapers
17:33
and um molly from qi met him at a party
17:36
once
17:36
and um apparently he doesn't correct
17:39
people when
17:40
they think he works for qr
17:41
[Laughter]
17:43
and he said that if i ever want to claim
17:45
any of his um
17:46
articles which i'm sure are very good
17:48
that i can do that as well but
17:49
it's nice like going into a cooperative
17:52
with someone else
17:53
yeah i should do that with the other
17:55
enemies yeah i would just do a straight
17:57
split of everything you know
17:59
the money started whatever you know
18:02
if you're listening to this now just
18:04
please please get in touch
18:06
well he needs to listen because people
18:08
are coming up going hey great work on
18:09
the podcast
18:13
my thing about the etymology of acne
18:17
this week i've been um trying to come up
18:20
with some new facts for
18:21
our book so we did one three three nine
18:23
qi facts over christmas
18:25
and we're selling it to america and we
18:27
need to come up with some facts that
18:29
work
18:29
for for an american audience to replace
18:31
the ones that were for a british
18:32
audience
18:33
and one that i really liked was that the
18:35
first ever player drafted
18:37
by the pittsburgh steelers nfl team was
18:39
called william
18:40
shakespeare oh isn't that great
18:43
yeah i really love that and it's great
18:45
and it's great as well because you can
18:46
imagine that any
18:47
of the journalists who really struggle
18:49
with running out of cliches basically
18:51
that's just a gift like you suddenly got
18:53
shakespeare as a baseball player
18:54
yeah like if he was a football player
18:57
nfl player
18:58
uh not so good don't have a string of
19:02
baseball jokes
19:07
i tried to actually test out the theory
19:10
of someone who is great like do my own
19:12
kind of collection
19:13
of uh einsteins as it were so i try to
19:15
think of the most impressive person
19:17
alive
19:18
so i i picked who i think is sometimes
19:20
pitted as the greatest living mind at
19:22
the moment so uh the actor james
19:24
franco james franco is consistently if
19:26
you read a paper on him
19:28
treated as some sort of great god of the
19:30
intellectual for example this is a quote
19:32
this is someone from an interview
19:33
uh he has an unusually high metabolism
19:36
for productivity
19:37
a super human ability to focus so
19:39
anytime people write about him
19:41
they write about with these huge kind of
19:43
descriptions
19:44
so okay but okay look okay i'll justify
19:47
why
19:47
people think he's so impressed he's not
19:49
only an actor he's an author he's a
19:50
director he's a poet he's a painter
19:52
despite having an acting career which
19:53
he's constantly doing he's doing
19:55
post-graduate courses and got permission
19:57
to take as many as 62 course credits per
20:00
quarter
20:00
compared to the normal limit of 19 while
20:03
continuing to act
20:04
he has an iq of 140 which is considered
20:08
to be genius level although when i was
20:10
looking into that i know it's a bit
20:11
it's very dubious because the graph i
20:13
saw it had mozart
20:15
beethoven james stephen hawking no
20:18
shakira so it's a bit dubious
20:22
but so i kind of i started thinking okay
20:25
that's the best franco we have
20:26
mm-hmm i want to see whether frank
20:29
general franco i mean is he
20:31
better than james franco well did he do
20:33
more
20:34
he did more maybe fewer movies but was
20:37
in charge of more countries
20:39
yeah i think that was fair i did find
20:41
one other guy who is his name he might
20:43
be a better friend who's called jesus
20:44
franco
20:45
so he's a spanish director he was born
20:47
in 1930.
20:48
actually he died uh late last year
20:51
rather sadly
20:52
um he made over 180 movies so he made a
20:54
cult movie in 1961 called the awful
20:56
doctor orlaff
20:58
but then his career kind of took a side
20:59
where he was turned so he made a movie
21:01
called the two female spies with
21:03
flowered panties
21:05
a penis for three not not a three piece
21:10
knight of the open vaginas and
21:14
lulu's talking bunghole and he also
21:17
he was named by the catholic church as
21:19
the most dangerous director out there
21:21
and he was called jesus jesus yeah jesus
21:23
franco
21:24
and then uh franco is the first name of
21:26
the first italian in space so we have an
21:28
astronaut
21:28
who's the jesus guy wasn't he was
21:30
originally called terence but as they
21:32
saw his film think it was like jesus
21:35
for god's sake
21:38
but i think it's interesting let's let's
21:40
suddenly you know take one name franco
21:42
lucy's talking bunghole lulu's lulu's
21:45
sorry
21:46
knight of the open vaginas i don't even
21:49
know what i mean
21:50
is it like night of the living dead yeah
21:52
i don't know it's a zombie
21:54
vagina walk the earth at night yeah well
21:57
did you know that used to be the theory
21:58
about vaginas they moved around the body
22:01
they would disappear into the middle of
22:02
the night to go get food
22:06
i read a book called it should be here
22:08
it should be here
22:10
it's called the story of bee and it was
22:12
all about vaginas the history of vaginas
22:15
okay history of vaginas the first
22:17
notable vagina
22:22
who who got hungry when he was
22:26
the best thing i saw about people's
22:28
names is i went onto facebook and
22:30
npr had done this post on facebook
22:33
saying do you have a name which is
22:34
similar to someone famous
22:36
if so how's that affected your life and
22:38
there are 1100
22:40
comments on there i read through them
22:42
all
22:43
but there was um a girl called sharon
22:45
stone
22:46
who said if i had a book for every time
22:48
someone said are you wearing panties
22:50
i'd be as rich as the actress oh a buck
22:52
i think he said a book
22:56
for every time i'd be able to have a
22:57
very successful secondhand bookshop
23:01
and there was a guy called dave apps who
23:04
had to get special permission from
23:06
facebook to have an account because his
23:07
name was apps
23:09
yeah which is pretty good and there's
23:11
also a guy called nicholas dragon
23:13
and he said i don't think there's anyone
23:15
famous with my name but
23:17
anytime i meet someone new they say wow
23:19
that's a cool name
23:22
and a cool story nicholas
23:26
um did you guys know that uh samuel
23:29
johnson
23:30
i know we've got so we found one and
23:32
found the other samuel johnson but
23:33
actually there was a third
23:34
can you give a repeat of what yeah of
23:36
course so one of the other qi
23:37
researchers
23:38
um found that there was another samuel
23:40
johnson alive at the same time as samuel
23:42
johnson you know the guy who wrote the
23:43
dictionary
23:44
um who was a drunk sort of dramatist and
23:47
a
23:47
entertainer performer who was also known
23:49
as lord flame
23:50
a great name that is yeah but there was
23:53
a third samuel johnson
23:55
who so samuel johnson the one we know
23:56
about the dictionary man was asked to do
23:58
a translation of this great work by frau
24:01
paulo i can't remember what it's called
24:02
but
24:02
anyway it was this great historical work
24:04
it was big cheese at the time it was
24:05
like the harry potter of its day
24:07
and um so samuel johnson was like yeah
24:09
i'll do that started translating it then
24:11
found out
24:11
they'd also asked another guy also
24:13
called samuel johnson to do it
24:15
and so he kind of was affronted he was
24:17
like not only has someone else been
24:18
asked to do it but it's someone else
24:19
called samuel johnson
24:21
and then there's this series of
24:22
exchanges in newspapers where samuel
24:24
johnson one is getting really angry with
24:25
samuel johnson too
24:26
and eventually nine of them translated
24:28
the work they just got into this big
24:29
skirmish and they both thought sod it
24:30
then
24:31
fine i'm not doing it and then i came
24:33
along
24:34
hi watch me do it so myself oh
24:38
dance your translation
24:48
let's move on to our final fact so andy
24:51
we're coming to you yes
24:52
okay the fact is the first contact
24:55
lenses
24:56
cost as much as a car wow but what year
24:59
was this
25:00
well they were invented in germany in
25:01
the late 1880s originally and britain
25:03
was a bit late to it um that was in the
25:05
1930s but even in the 20s and 30s in
25:07
britain so even if they'd been
25:08
invented for 50 years they were still
25:10
that expensive wow yeah
25:11
so they weren't presumably things that
25:13
you would change every day
25:15
no no no these were hard contact lenses
25:17
proper sort of shell-like ones and they
25:19
were very thick as well so they could
25:20
only be one for two
25:21
hours max at a time wow and then the
25:24
irritation in your eye was so great that
25:26
you had to take them out
25:27
and initially you had to have a mold
25:29
taken of your eye there are great videos
25:30
um if you look up on british pathe news
25:33
there are photos of people's islands
25:35
being pulled apart
25:36
this big mould being stuck in their eye
25:38
and they're sort of the promotional
25:40
videos and the ladies saying
25:41
look i i you look at how nice my eyes
25:44
look now i don't have to wear spectacles
25:45
and she's her eyes are watery clearly
25:48
the remains everywhere she's clearly in
25:50
great pain
25:51
of the mergers with a gun to her head
25:54
such clever and ease oh
25:56
wow it's really funny you should look
25:58
him up if you're listening that's
25:59
amazing maybe you could post it on your
26:01
yeah i will i'll put it on my twitter
26:02
which is at andrew hunter m
26:04
and you'll be able to see so yeah that
26:06
was the first contact lenses so
26:08
you you actually found this out because
26:09
you went to a museum didn't you i went
26:11
to the museum of the
26:12
british optical association uh or
26:15
british
26:16
pharmacological association i didn't
26:17
remember the name of it but i did go to
26:19
it
26:20
it's in charing cross it's great just on
26:23
the same street five doors apart there's
26:25
benjamin franklin's house
26:26
from when he lived here and this amazing
26:28
museum but you can only go around it by
26:29
appointment
26:30
so you have to email the curator and say
26:32
i'd like to see we'll do cool stuff
26:34
and there's so much amazing stuff so not
26:36
only that the first ever soft contact
26:38
lenses are
26:39
much thinner and more comfortable you
26:41
had to they came in a glass tube and to
26:43
get access to the lenses you had to
26:44
break open the glass tube so there are
26:46
now shards of glass
26:49
near your contact lenses
26:52
the person promoting them with just
26:54
crying blood
27:00
yeah they were invented not to help you
27:02
see they were invented to shield
27:03
people's eyes
27:04
because there's a medical condition
27:05
called caricatonis kerry catilla
27:09
but very close it's called keracatonus
27:11
and it means you have a very very
27:13
sensitive it's the cornea is it at the
27:15
front of the eye
27:17
and it and it also becomes pointed and
27:19
so they were invented to help people
27:21
just live their lives
27:22
intense pain irritation so yeah they
27:25
were initially uh
27:26
a medical thing in that sense rather
27:28
than an eye cycle
27:29
yeah did you guys know that um abraham
27:32
lincoln's contact lenses were made of
27:33
wood
27:36
that's just not true
27:41
no it's not i'm sorry
27:45
i read about supposedly rene descartes
27:47
made some uh contact lenses that
27:50
were made out of um what they were fluid
27:52
inside that would
27:53
magnify things but they stuck so far out
27:55
of your eye that you couldn't blink when
27:57
you had them
28:02
great i'll tell you what the early snow
28:05
goggles
28:06
uh were made out of caribou antelope
28:08
weren't they
28:09
really yeah and they weren't see-through
28:11
they just had a very small slit
28:14
that you would be able to see through
28:15
and it would protect your eyes when you
28:16
were skiing that's great i guess that
28:18
would work
28:19
i was surprised to read that 64 of
28:21
people supposedly it's an estimate wear
28:23
glasses
28:24
have you got contacts yeah i've got them
28:26
in now you wear contacts of course
28:30

doing all the fact checking as we go
01:27
along today is anna chazinski
01:30
uh oh and i'm dan so we should start by
01:32
saying that um this is the first time
01:33
you've been to the office greg
01:35
to the qi offices yeah uh this is not
01:37
the first time alex has been
01:38
alex is uh you're almost like a part of
01:40
the family now i'm going to try to cut
01:42
down because
01:43
i i wine you're going back to america
01:45
tomorrow so yeah i don't think that
01:46
counts
01:48
but i'll be back i'll be back at the end
01:50
of this month
01:52
basically as soon as alex comes in the
01:53
office that's the end of work for the
01:54
destination yeah
01:55
well you know the thing is this office
01:57
is like the is like what i would like
01:59
the inside of my mind to look like just
02:01
neatly ordered and filled with facts
02:03
i'll categorize like literally i feel
02:04
like you could find
02:05
any fact in this office because there's
02:07
a lot well there's a lot of books
02:08
yeah there's a lot of folders oh there's
02:11
we've got the internet and everyone's
02:12
yeah i was gonna say i was gonna say
02:14
technically it could just be a closet
02:15
with a laptop
02:16
yet still and that would still hold true
02:18
so okay well
02:19
uh so as this is a special one uh maybe
02:22
we'll start with uh
02:23
yeah we'll start with you greg oh good
02:25
the least prepared one yeah yeah yeah
02:27
yeah
02:27
let's uh let's begin with the sort of
02:29
rambling incoherence yeah
02:31
that's what i would say the expert well
02:32
just give us what it's it's
02:34
your favorite thing that's kind of on
02:36
your mind this week the thing that
02:37
you've learned this is my first week off
02:39
after writing my book
02:40
my first ever book so i won't just try
02:42
to come up i think comes up next year
02:44
are you allowed to say anything about
02:45
the book like yeah that's what i can
02:46
tell you the title yes
02:47
um it's called one million years in a
02:49
day stone age to phone age it's the
02:51
range and it's sort of structured around
02:53
a modern nice life
02:59
no i thought um i just something i just
03:02
put in the book and i thought it's quite
03:02
an interesting fact really is that the
03:04
the earliest known dentistry is 9 000
03:07
years old
03:08
this is back in neolithic really
03:11
it's like the mammoths were walking the
03:13
earth with dancers
03:17
so uh we're talking here in uh i suppose
03:19
modern pakistan is what we call it it's
03:21
a place called
03:22
uh i suppose it's not my pronunciation
03:24
it's not great but
03:25
archaeologists have found teeth which
03:27
have been drilled and they've been
03:29
so you know it's the earliest really
03:30
sort of fillings or early
03:32
drilling technique using a bow drill
03:34
which is you know just a sort of
03:35
whittling
03:36
bit of sharp stick uh which is a
03:38
technique used really for jewelry
03:39
so i'm not even teeth cleaning like
03:41
because i knew that the egyptians had
03:43
horsehair toothbrushes
03:44
oh yeah even reparative dentistry goes
03:46
back that far so this this would be
03:47
medicinal dentistry this would be pain
03:49
relief
03:49
yeah i guess it's an obvious thing
03:51
because people would have been in so
03:52
much pain wouldn't they yeah
03:54
although i remember reading that like
03:56
sugar cane sugar came in relatively late
03:58
so people didn't have as bad from the
04:00
liquid time as they have today it's
04:02
interesting actually there's been a
04:03
couple of
04:03
uh major studies the past couple of
04:05
years that have shown that's not really
04:06
true actually there's an awful lot of
04:07
dental
04:08
wear and tear wear and tear but also
04:10
sugar based actually because there's
04:11
quite a lot of sugar in
04:12
in natural fruits and so forth and
04:14
obviously if you're not brushing your
04:15
teeth every day it will build up
04:17
right is it complex sugars that really
04:19
do harm though
04:20
yeah i mean the worst dentistry in
04:22
history i think if you're gonna if you
04:23
weren't sort of
04:24
elected an era i would say probably the
04:25
18th century the the georgians
04:27
the 18th centuries where dentistry
04:28
begins as a modern discipline but it's
04:30
also where
04:31
really dentistry like teeth were at
04:34
their worst
04:34
um if you look at portraits no one
04:36
smiles yes hill the first ever smile i
04:39
can't remember as a female artist french
04:40
female artist i think it's in libra i
04:43
think maybe could you check that mario
04:44
lebron perhaps
04:45
uh it's a really famous painting and
04:46
it's very controversial because i think
04:48
it's a self-portrait i think she's
04:49
grinning
04:49
wow and it's the reason you didn't grim
04:52
before because your teeth were sober
04:53
your teeth were all fine i mean who
05:01
romans brushed their teeth to some
05:02
extent uh they used rags
05:05
i mean the egyptians didn't do uh dental
05:08
surgery particularly that they did they
05:09
were very good
05:10
dentists the first known dentists in in
05:12
human history the first
05:13
named dentists are egyptian um
05:16
they found i think in 2006 i think they
05:18
found a tomb with three named dentists
05:19
on the wall
05:20
sort of written in so like like a
05:22
company name yeah yeah
05:28
um and they were they were royal
05:29
dentists so they were sort of official
05:30
dentists to a pharaoh and
05:31
they uh these three guys were clearly
05:34
sort of official
05:35
tooth prodders there was a recent uh
05:36
meta study done on egyptian mummies i
05:38
think 40
05:39
if i remember i might be wrong i think
05:40
40 had serious dental disease
05:42
wow and dental disease can kill you my
05:45
father is a physician
05:46
and he says something really interesting
05:47
that that historically the people who
05:50
get the worst care
05:51
are the famous and the wealthy because
05:53
what he's being he's being ironic
05:55
what he's saying is um typically uh
05:58
famous people have been killed
05:59
by over medicating or over operating or
06:03
too much complex treatment like as soon
06:05
as they like the body
06:06
will repair itself we talked in an
06:08
earlier podcast about james garfield
06:11
dirty dirty fingers in the wound and
06:13
stuff like that my father gave a ted
06:15
talk on it which is actually really
06:16
interesting
06:17
yeah his name is eliza edelman so i
06:18
wonder if if those pharaohs were
06:20
receiving
06:21
a a lot of dental attention or be
06:24
getting such rich food that they were
06:25
well that's the big question so the the
06:28
quality of food obviously is going to
06:29
it's going to affect things i mean
06:30
ertsy the iceman found in tirolian alps
06:34
he had really really messed up teeth
06:36
what was the fact that you were saying
06:37
about the baseball player
06:40
i can't remember his name but he's a
06:41
baseball player who was um
06:43
who had to be taken out of the game
06:45
because he bit himself on his own ass
06:47
and what happened was he slid into the
06:49
final base and his false teeth fell out
06:51
and i'm sure you know about it but what
06:54
we were saying though is that is that he
06:56
must have been in his twenties right but
06:57
yet there he was with
06:58
a full set of false teeth because that
07:00
was a thing that happened had his tv
07:01
knocked out
07:02
the 1920s apparently he's not his he was
07:04
called clarence
07:05
bleffen and he's now called clarence
07:07
climax blessing i don't really
07:09
understand that
07:13
he had a really particular gimmick yeah
07:17
no teeth you say
07:20
alex i have to tell you just as an
07:22
american and a baseball fan yeah
07:24
if you don't know this it's my favorite
07:25
baseball fact did you know lou gehrig
07:27
so i know the disease exactly you really
07:30
should have seen that one coming
07:31
yeah yeah yeah so this is what's
07:33
fantastic about it it turns out
07:34
that lou gehrig didn't die of lou
07:36
gehrig's disease
07:38
so the disease named after him he didn't
07:39
have there's an interesting wikipedia
07:41
list of people who have been killed
07:43
by already deceased people my favorite
07:46
one is someone killed not by a deceased
07:47
person by a deceased animal a really
07:49
notorious poacher in montana this is a
07:51
story that people in montana like to
07:53
tell
07:53
and like this poacher outside of helena
07:55
he was um he was really famous for
07:57
shooting deer and people told him that
07:58
there was one particular deer they'd
08:00
never be able to get and he wounded a
08:02
whole bunch of times
08:03
and finally he spotted on a bluff across
08:05
over over him and he shot it
08:07
and he turned around to celebrate and
08:09
the deo bounced all the way down and
08:10
landed on him and killed him
08:12
and the deer survived
08:15
yeah the guy did um we should move on to
08:17
another fact yeah
08:18
just just quickly satisfy obviously um
08:21
greg was right i mean he's a historian
08:23
about the first ever smile in a portrait
08:26
was in 1787.
08:27
there's quite funny the court gossip
08:29
sheet at the time said
08:31
an affectation which artists art lovers
08:33
and persons of taste have been united in
08:35
condemning
08:36
and which finds no precedent among the
08:38
ancients is that in smiling she shows
08:40
her teeth
08:41
so you know pretty outrageous i saw an
08:43
amazing um
08:44
collection of photos from a period pre
08:47
smile
08:47
where they did all the grim kind of
08:49
straight face looking
08:51
and it's outtake photos where the
08:53
families
08:54
crack up and they're laughing and it's
08:56
so interesting because it's the first
08:58
time where you see the real
08:59
personalities and this is so interesting
09:02
where they're just they're properly
09:03
laughing out loud and clearly the
09:05
person's like well this is unusable
09:08
like you don't look creepy and you don't
09:09
look solid
09:11
michael smiled this is
09:15
a dick michael
09:22
all right let's move on to our uh second
09:24
fact i want to throw in my
09:26
my fact here uh particularly because i
09:27
want to hear your thoughts on this craig
09:29
um it's a it's a theory from a guy
09:31
called dr hans all rich
09:32
nightmares which is that the middle ages
09:36
never happened oh wow wow so it's a
09:39
thing called phantom time
09:40
theory it's basically his alleges that
09:43
it was just
09:44
made up are you sure that the guy has
09:46
doctor hands already yeah i know
09:48
a lot of people believe it uh you know
09:50
obviously a lot of idiots believe it but
09:51
um
09:52
according to them 6 14 to 9 11
09:55
a.d right did not happen it did not
09:58
happen
09:58
we're going through it now what is the
10:00
basis for this theory this is it's a
10:02
conspiracy of the calendar
10:04
brilliant yeah and and so what his
10:06
suggestion is as well is that the things
10:08
that were supposed to have happened
10:09
in the middle ages people at the time
10:11
removed them from that bit of history
10:12
and created
10:14
a fiction of these 300 years i think he
10:16
said charlemagne just never existed well
10:18
as a fictional character
10:20
so basically half of the things that you
10:22
do for a living yeah just
10:23
my master's degree is a fictional
10:26
yeah i'll give you some direct uh sort
10:28
of from this article it seems that
10:30
historians are plagued by a plethora of
10:31
falsified documents from the middle ages
10:33
some documents forged by the roman
10:35
catholic church during the middle ages
10:37
were created hundreds of years before
10:38
their great moments arrived
10:40
after which they were embraced by
10:42
medieval society this implied that
10:44
whoever produced these forgeries must
10:46
have very skillfully anticipated the
10:47
future
10:48
or there was some discrepancy in
10:50
calculating dates so
10:52
where does he stand on the vikings um
10:54
[Music]
10:56
because they won vikings
11:00
[Music]
11:02
it was just he just didn't happen and
11:05
yeah no
11:06
man and uh charlemagne alfred the greats
11:10
he says that he says that maybe after
11:11
the great uh was in a different period
11:13
of time maybe the vikings
11:14
you know maybe they were just the year
11:17
before
11:19
so he stops at 9 11.
11:22
he stops it no no one though 9 11 is the
11:25
year the vikings
11:26
conquer normandy and become the normans
11:28
it's rollo king who
11:30
uh who founds the norman dynasty the
11:32
vikings become normans and the normans
11:33
of course become willing to conquer and
11:34
that becomes
11:35
our first dynasty of english medieval
11:37
kings so 9 11 is a good year but this
11:39
goes with the thing that you like done
11:40
which is
11:41
that if you come up with an idea or a
11:44
conspiracy then you can always seem to
11:46
fit in
11:46
you can find into whatever your theory
11:49
is
11:50
yeah you can imagine if you said to him
11:51
what you know what about the vikings he
11:53
would have an answer he won't have an
11:54
answer yeah because i know neurology in
11:56
the bible isn't it people who have tried
11:57
to find
11:58
patterns in the bible you said okay you
11:59
didn't realize it's been re-translated
12:01
loads of times so all right final
12:04
question then
12:04
is there any truth but the malaysians
12:07
didn't happen
12:08
i would be deeply deeply upset
12:13
would you really yeah i would actually
12:15
make it well
12:19
um i mean it's true we should be very
12:22
deeply
12:23
suspicious and skeptical of the past and
12:25
one of the things that historians do is
12:26
we we
12:27
rigorously interrogate documents and
12:29
we're always trying to disprove them we
12:31
try to apply that sort of scientific
12:32
methodology of saying how do we know
12:34
this is true and that's what great
12:35
scholarship is but you don't destroy all
12:37
things
12:38
you just you're just trying to question
12:39
them and say okay and obviously there
12:41
were problems with forgeries the
12:42
monastery for example would be given
12:43
land
12:44
and they would lose the document and
12:45
then a king would turn up going
12:46
brilliant i'm having your land back and
12:47
they'd be like no no
12:48
this is ours we've always had it so
12:50
they'd forge a document yeah and then we
12:51
get the forgery right now i read that
12:53
i read that um you know andorra the
12:55
country yeah they have
12:56
a constitution um but it's in a safe in
13:00
andara somewhere and a lot of historians
13:01
think that it's fake
13:03
really you heard that before no i
13:04
haven't faking what's it like it doesn't
13:06
exist
13:07
as in yeah it's a modern reproduction
13:09
because they don't have the
13:10
they don't have the historical basis
13:13
that they think they have
13:14
because it was it was one of those
13:15
states that came in to buffer from the
13:18
from the
13:22
if it were to be true this phantom time
13:25
thing which is
13:25
which is 110 not yeah um
13:29
then what it would mean is i mean no new
13:31
scholarship is emerging and new
13:33
scholarship is emerging all the time
13:35
yeah it is
13:35
so it would be so it would be insane but
13:38
it would also keep off
13:39
we would really interrupt with our
13:41
carbon data yeah i was just thinking
13:43
yeah yeah we use historical documents to
13:46
try and
13:47
ally up with carbon dating and you use
13:48
carbon dating to try and add up with
13:50
historical documents you try and play
13:51
them off against each other
13:52
and try and find a cross-reference and
13:53
that way if they both agree you kind of
13:54
go all right maybe that's maybe that's
13:55
legit
13:56
um with richard iii discovering the car
13:58
park recently we
14:00
that the carbon dating there can sort of
14:02
give you that
14:03
that specificity scientifically which
14:04
then legitimizes the documents that told
14:06
us he was there yes okay so then we can
14:08
kind of go oh these dogs are
14:09
these are okay maybe we can look at them
14:10
closely for something else so that's a
14:11
way of verifying it's a way of verifying
14:13
because you're using the scientific
14:14
method to sort of say okay this the
14:16
archaeology is legit so maybe the
14:18
history's okay yeah physicists like to
14:20
use
14:20
really old lead for their experiments
14:22
because it's
14:23
it's quite um it doesn't react with as
14:25
many things but that means that they're
14:26
trying to use a lot of archaeological
14:28
items
14:29
to make their experiments have you heard
14:30
of that yeah i've i've heard about it
14:32
briefly i don't know if that's
14:33
i mean it's supposed to make sense
14:34
wouldn't it maybe yeah but then
14:37
yeah it's not really great to deal with
14:39
someone else's stuff
14:40
it's richard the third and i brought it
14:50
which in fact it sounds quite well
14:51
founded that the andorran constitution
14:53
is a forgery although this isn't a book
14:55
so apparently it came from charlemagne
14:56
it was signed um
14:57
the independence of andorra was this
14:59
documentary we all know charlemagne
15:00
didn't
15:01
i think we've established uh although i
15:04
am reading it in a book where they've
15:05
spelt it's a book it's andorra business
15:07
law handbook but they've spelt
15:08
charlemagne charlemage he's a dog he was
15:16
[Applause]
15:20
all right so we're gonna go on to uh
15:22
we'll do we'll do alex's fact now alex
15:24
my fact is um it's about the most
15:27
medically indispensable sea creature in
15:29
the united states
15:31
is um the horseshoe crab are you aware
15:33
of the
15:34
no it's a wide wide plane to make isn't
15:37
it yeah
15:37
how does that work well so the horseshoe
15:39
crab lives in the
15:40
uh very bacteria-rich uh coastline
15:44
shallow waters in the uh in the ocean so
15:46
in the early 20s they were sort of seen
15:48
as a nuisance and they were ground up
15:49
and
15:50
and used as fertilizer and stuff and fed
15:52
to pigs
15:53
and and now every every year a half
15:56
million horseshoe crabs are harvested
15:59
and they're brought into factories
16:01
by one of five companies all along the
16:04
eastern coast of the united states
16:05
and they're bled alive and their blood
16:08
is baby blue
16:09
and if you can find a picture it's it's
16:11
incredibly interesting
16:12
and this blood it detects any um militia
16:16
dangerous bacterial endotoxins even at a
16:18
concentration of one part per trillion
16:21
so the fda requires
16:22
that all drugs only drugs that are
16:24
brought to market be
16:25
run uh through this horseshoe blood so
16:28
every single person in the united states
16:30
who's ever had an injection of any kind
16:32
has had a drug that's been tested in
16:35
this lal test
16:36
that's amazing that is incredible it's
16:37
unbelievable and the blood
16:39
per court is fifteen thousand dollars
16:42
so they don't kill the crabs so that's
16:44
like so people they just yeah
16:45
they believe them and then they take
16:47
them on a boat all the way out to
16:49
sea so they don't re-harvest the crabs
16:51
that they've already because they have
16:52
like a great holiday cruise
16:55
you guys have done a really good thing
16:57
but they dumped these guys really far
16:58
out and they noticed that less and less
17:00
of them are coming back
17:01
while you don't kill something when you
17:02
take a lot of its blood it does make it
17:03
more lethargic and less likely to mate
17:05
but yeah so that's so that to me is
17:07
that's very exciting i think that's
17:08
really cool
17:09
yeah that they have basically the best
17:11
immune system of anyone
17:12
they do we can use it my favorite crab
17:15
there's a have you heard of the samurai
17:17
crab
17:18
no but it sounds like a movie let's see
17:20
this is very sorry
17:23
basically sideways
17:25
[Laughter]
17:27
um there was a superstition that samurai
17:30
warriors
17:30
when they died were reincarnated as
17:33
these crabs because a lot of these crabs
17:35
that came up had the pattern on their
17:37
shell
17:38
of a samurai face it became an
17:41
evolutionary thing so it's the samurai
17:42
pattern that became
17:44
the uh that is brilliant wow and so they
17:46
would throw the ones that looked like a
17:48
samurai back
17:49
into the ocean are there other stories
17:52
of animals
17:53
selectively surviving like that because
17:54
i've always wanted i think dogs are
17:56
supposed to be a bit like that and cats
17:57
and
17:58
dogs domesticated themselves yeah
18:00
because cats when they meet out they
18:02
don't me out to other cats they only do
18:04
it to humans
18:04
really they've selected to me out just
18:07
so that we would think they're little
18:08
babies
18:08
we've domesticated dogs we you know
18:10
deliberately took wolves and
18:12
please stop biting me i'd like to do a
18:13
dog please and the amazing thing is
18:15
you can domesticate an animal really
18:16
really quickly there's a russian
18:17
scientist who did in the 50s with foxes
18:19
uh i think what was his name things
18:21
would be i think billy dean
18:23
he took fox's feral wild angry foxes
18:26
trying to eat his face
18:27
and he just bred them in brethren
18:28
brethren are always taking the most
18:29
docile
18:30
cubs and bring them together
18:36
[Laughter]
18:39
but he bred them together so you ended
18:41
up with these sort of more increasingly
18:42
docile creatures but the extraordinary
18:44
thing that he discovered was that
18:45
when you breed for physical
18:46
characteristics it also creates a
18:48
personality change they became
18:50
more sort of dog-like more sort of
18:52
fluffy-tailed and more sort of willing
18:53
to
18:53
follow around but they also changed was
18:55
sequious but they did yes
18:57
but they agree as far as the subsequent
18:59
secrets
19:00
yeah um but they will also change their
19:02
personality and demeanor and the fact
19:04
that respond to calls and so on and he
19:05
did that like ten generations that's all
19:06
it took you know there's been an awful
19:08
lot of genetic testing recently because
19:09
we can now do dna
19:10
analysis on animals and we found that
19:12
actually dogs are much older than we
19:14
thought so do we think that we
19:15
we got them for companionship or
19:17
fighting or
19:18
it's probably hunting a companionship
19:20
because we had pep bear there are
19:22
definitely at least one pet bear that's
19:24
been found in the stone age well byron
19:25
had a pet bird
19:26
byron did have a pet bed i remember the
19:27
pet bear he took it to cambridge
19:29
because he wasn't allowed a dog so he
19:31
was a bit of a ditch
19:34
is this before after he founded the
19:35
hamburger chain or is that
19:39
is that the most ridiculous oh wait
19:41
someone kept a pet scorpion in a jar on
19:43
his desk
19:44
i read this in one of your books i read
19:46
that in one of the the qi books which
19:48
are available
19:49
in fine book stores everywhere
19:52
probably the same books as greg's book
19:54
will be available in next year
19:58
talk about obsequious
20:01
but extraordinarily the fact that sort
20:03
of dog things quickly storing things we
20:04
obviously domesticated dogs because to
20:05
do that you have to
20:06
take a wild feral wolf that is trying to
20:08
kill you and gradually tame it but
20:10
it's not taming it's it's breeding it
20:12
you take the run to blitz and the
20:13
runability bring them together and
20:15
gradually you breathe them and you
20:16
create a new animal and that is the dog
20:18
the amazing thing is that the oldest dog
20:20
breed in the world is only sort of a
20:21
thousand years old or something roman
20:22
dogs
20:23
don't exist anymore so when you find the
20:24
room dog at pompeii which we that we
20:26
have found one
20:27
that breed no longer exists doesn't
20:28
exist wow
20:30
is it because they die out well the
20:32
breeding programs change and you have
20:34
sort of different
20:35
needs for them and animals are
20:36
constantly evolving and changing and we
20:37
breathe them a different way yeah george
20:39
washington to bread dogs
20:40
george washington read the american fox
20:41
sound he took a french fox sound from
20:43
um the monkey de la fayette and an
20:45
english foxhound and he brought them
20:46
together and created the american fox
20:48
sound wow
20:49
um and he was really obsessed with this
20:50
he was sort of typical 18th century
20:51
gentleman and like i'm going to breed an
20:53
animal but the amazing thing is cats
20:54
domesticated themselves
20:55
the oldest known cat i think is from
20:57
charlotte boros i think in cyprus
20:58
i think it's about 9 000 years old is
21:00
there any truth to the the
21:02
story when people attach cats to their
21:04
shields yes
21:05
the egyptians yes i love business the
21:06
battle i think pollution i think on top
21:08
of my head because so the egyptians
21:10
believed cats to be holy and revered
21:12
they had huge cat funeral monuments with
21:14
like millions of bearing cats that they
21:15
would if your cat died you shaved with
21:17
your eyebrows and you would take your
21:18
cat to this
21:18
holy city of cats they found a load of
21:21
mummies didn't they mummy fight cats
21:22
like a millionaire huge one recently
21:24
yeah yeah uh and the city i think was
21:26
called
21:27
named after the i think i might make
21:29
that up there's a different city
21:30
and they would bury the cats and they
21:31
shave off their eyes and i was working
21:32
overtime by the way
21:33
sorry i'm not sorry no no they never
21:35
want to interrupt a thousand tabs up
21:37
without information
21:38
they're great i can't wait till the end
21:40
of this section it's called okay good
21:44
but they worship cats and uh there's a
21:46
famous story that uh a roman
21:48
soldier was in his chariot and he ran
21:49
over a cat and he was killed by an angry
21:51
mob but then
21:52
in the middle ages people thought that
21:53
cats were evil didn't they and they
21:55
probably had their soul they thought
21:56
they were witches
21:57
basically burns alive as well louis the
21:58
14th i think but yeah went to a burning
22:00
ceremony
22:02
ceremony threw them onto the pirate they
22:04
used to be stoned they were eating alive
22:06
alive how do you eat a lot of declining
22:10
involved
22:11
just you just grab it yeah i guess you i
22:12
guess you hold out the legs and just
22:13
start chomping at them
22:14
oh god they've gone from gods to being
22:17
evil
22:17
and now we just put them on the internet
22:19
and laugh at them
22:26
[Applause]
22:27
[Music]
22:29
okay listen um i'm going to quickly do
22:32
my last
22:32
yes fact i found that um we have 28
22:35
people that we know
22:36
slept with queen elizabeth the first and
22:39
that they were all women
22:40
whoa what so what do you mean when you
22:43
say slept with
22:44
you slept in the same planet yeah well
22:46
it didn't does that sound right to you
22:48
same bedroom
22:49
in the same bedroom yes same bedroom um
22:51
the interesting thing about queen is
22:52
that i actually made a documentary for
22:53
channel five years ago that was awfully
22:54
ridiculous
22:55
well we said when did she have a love
22:56
child yeah
22:58
i did she well there was a rumor she did
23:01
and
23:01
spanish used it's propaganda and um
23:04
obviously i don't think she did but um
23:05
i listened to first she probably didn't
23:07
spend more than five minutes of her life
23:09
alone
23:10
she was constantly surrounded by people
23:12
like everywhere she went she was born a
23:13
princess she was always going to be a
23:15
princess and then she was a queen and
23:16
then she died
23:17
so you have ladies in waiting who of
23:18
course would sleep in the same room as
23:20
her and
23:21
you'd have sort of trucker beds at the
23:22
bottom of the bed usually they would
23:23
sleep in or
23:24
maybe beds like more of a sort of a
23:26
pull-out little oh like a cupboard
23:28
yeah almost like under the beds like
23:29
little you know yeah these people didn't
23:31
really have
23:32
any kind of private space but the queen
23:34
could never go like i want some alone
23:35
time
23:36
maybe but we don't have any records for
23:38
that and you know what else i don't
23:39
think this time period ever existed
23:42
so what does this fact mean then does it
23:43
mean that she slept with way more than
23:45
that
23:45
basically it's a way of bringing up this
23:47
interesting fact that um the monarchs
23:49
would have sleeping partners
23:50
for companionship and for safety and
23:53
whatever
23:54
i read that gandhi used to sleep with
23:57
naked female virgins to test
24:00
his chastity so they would lay next to
24:02
him in bed
24:03
wow yeah and just so he could be like
24:05
look how awesome i am
24:07
yeah okay nothing i don't want to knock
24:09
gandhi on our show but
24:10
i'm not gandhi [ __ ] that's weird
24:13
but maybe he was caught the first time
24:15
by his wife right he's like oh my god
24:17
you're having a very like no honey honey
24:18
i am
24:19
testing my chastity yeah she's like
24:22
you're gonna
24:22
so he's yeah i'll do it every night but
24:25
there's a
24:25
there's a nice story i think it's in the
24:26
bible you might be able to help us more
24:28
here
24:29
isn't it but uh it's king david i think
24:32
has a woman called
24:33
is it abby shag who is uh yeah i think
24:36
she's a
24:37
she's the official human water bottle he
24:39
gets really old
24:41
and just a woman that he cuddles with
24:43
exactly and she's a young beautiful
24:44
beautiful virgin and she gets in the bed
24:46
with him and her job is to warm him up
24:48
at night she's the one
24:51
it has an interesting translation to
24:54
20th century care of u.s presidents
24:58
this is mentioned in my father's ted med
25:00
talk which i didn't mean to play this
25:02
much
25:03
considering it's probably only got like
25:04
20 views because the ted med talk and
25:06
we'll post that we'll post this talk
25:08
yeah don't post the title
25:10
but but uh eisenhower had a lot of heart
25:12
attacks just like just like constantly
25:14
having
25:14
every morning like he would wake up and
25:16
he would go to a doctor and the doctor
25:17
was like yeah he had a heart attack last
25:18
night
25:19
and like one he he was prescribed a
25:21
prescription
25:22
that he snuggled with mamie eisenhower
25:25
but that basically was his
25:27
like it was a fair prescription for a
25:29
long time that literally to have like a
25:30
cuddle buddy would calm him down would
25:32
calm anybody down
25:33
yeah like it was it was prevent it's
25:35
been prevailing knowledge up until
25:37
pretty recently that having someone to
25:38
like snug like teddy bears
25:40
there's there are some papers that in
25:42
new england they used to circulate a lot
25:43
because i guess
25:44
new england is where i'm from i'm from
25:45
boston is like i guess teddy bears sort
25:48
of started in vermont and again
25:49
i'm sure a qi question is whether or not
25:51
teddy roosevelt yeah we think so
25:53
do you really yeah do you think that's
25:55
sorry teddy bear teddy roosevelt
25:56
yeah yeah it's 1903 isn't it he refuses
25:58
to shoot a bear is that right he's
26:00
hunting and he refuses
26:01
and kermit roosevelt was the first
26:03
westerner to shoot a panda or something
26:04
really stupid like
26:05
really might be wrong about that so just
26:08
to interject it wasn't just kermit it
26:09
was kermit and theodore
26:10
teddy's son um and they shot the panda
26:13
together
26:14
so they both agreed yeah family outing
26:17
they both shot with their separate guns
26:19
and they both claimed to be the first
26:21
westerners to kill johnson
26:22
is
26:32
no we should wrap up now but if you want
26:34

00:35
elves james anna and andy and once again
00:38
we are gonna go over
00:39
our favorite facts from the last seven
00:41
[Music]
00:42
days
00:45
fact number one this is my fact and the
00:49
fact is
00:49
that 30 million chinese people live in
00:53
caves
00:54
whoa really i've been reading a pulsar
00:57
book called
00:58
riding the iron rooster i was initially
01:00
reading it because of the fact i've read
01:01
a long time ago
01:02
he was talking about all the great
01:04
chinese inventions he said you know the
01:05
chinese invented paper
01:07
and and you know gunpowder and
01:09
wheelbarrows and then and
01:10
the guy was telling it to him in the
01:12
book ended by saying
01:13
we even have wheelbarrows in china that
01:16
you and the west don't yet know about
01:18
what yeah that was the most exciting
01:19
sentence wait a minute what could it be
01:21
that's different i know what what great
01:23
innovations have happened to the
01:24
wheelbarrow that we do
01:26
yeah so they got secret wheelbarrows in
01:28
china that we in the west don't you
01:29
know about but it was it was on the
01:31
following page that it then said
01:33
30 million people live in caves in china
01:36
and that in 1986 there was a program
01:40
to relocate all these people but not
01:43
into
01:44
houses but to relocate them into better
01:46
caves
01:48
i went to canary islands quite a few
01:50
years ago and they
01:51
traditionally lived in caves as well and
01:53
um they wanted to bring back this kind
01:55
of old tradition so you could get a
01:57
government grant to live in a cave
01:59
rather than living in a normal house oh
02:00
wow i would live in a cave like a shot
02:03
would you yeah definitely wasn't there a
02:05
story about english people
02:07
yes there was during the second world
02:09
war uh the
02:10
there are caves called chiselhurst caves
02:12
in kent and 15 000 people
02:14
stayed there and i found a um yeah some
02:17
some guidelines it's really in the
02:19
middle of this cave there's a very
02:22
english notice board saying no admission
02:25
or re-entry to the dormitory section
02:26
after 9 30 p.m
02:28
uh there must be reasonable quiet by 10
02:30
p.m lights out in absolute silence by 10
02:33
30 p.m
02:34
don't visit them i think can't you you
02:36
can i think i think i feel like i've
02:37
visited them in my childhood
02:39
there are about 15 there are 17 rules
02:40
and about 15 are about going to bed on
02:42
time
02:44
the president of china used to live in a
02:46
cave what
02:47
is it xi jinping you'll be better on the
02:50
pronunciation than me
02:51
but yeah he lived for seven years in a
02:53
cave when he was exiled during the
02:54
cultural revolution
02:55
i remember um we looked at this in the
02:58
series c
02:59
unsurprisingly um we found out that like
03:01
you said 30 million people lived in
03:03
china in caves
03:04
but we also found that the entire
03:06
population of the world in the stone age
03:07
was only five million
03:09
so that means that there were more
03:10
cavemen now than the have ever been in
03:12
history basically
03:13
which i think is great and most people
03:15
didn't live in caves
03:17
no no during this turn age but i mean a
03:18
few people would have done but most
03:19
people just lived in the open
03:21
or yeah of course i think most most
03:23
cases basically have always been
03:24
unlivable haven't they i think that's
03:26
what i read which is why most people
03:27
couldn't live in caves
03:28
although so i feel like this can get
03:30
easily confused with the fact that
03:32
a lot of people in beijing live
03:33
underground don't they
03:35
so they used to there are i think they
03:37
still do two million people at the
03:38
moment they
03:39
live underground ten percent of the
03:40
population in a basement flight
03:43
they either live in like uh basement
03:45
flat windowless basements air raid
03:47
shelters uh there are something like
03:48
pipe networks because just like property
03:50
prices are so high
03:51
i remember i read a biography on mousy
03:54
tongue which i found that uh great fact
03:56
that his barber was called big beard
03:57
wang
03:59
and there was amazing stuff about him i
04:00
mean it was an incredible biography it
04:02
was written by his personal physician
04:03
and in it he says that mao built
04:07
an entire under beijing city
04:10
like an entire city that never got used
04:12
but it was in the event of a massive war
04:13
that everyone would relocate under the
04:15
city and they would live there
04:16
and i try to do more research on it but
04:18
i can't find anything else on it
04:20
if you can't find the secret wheelbarrow
04:22
they're not going to tell you about the
04:23
massive secret city
04:26
actually leonardo had a design for a
04:28
city which was on two layers and the
04:30
poor people would live on the bottom
04:31
layer and the rich people would live on
04:33
the top layer
04:33
he was like an architect as well as
04:35
everything else eventually we're talking
04:36
about yeah sorry
04:39
not the teenage turtles
04:44
i read the other day i don't have any
04:46
solid information on this
04:47
uh they found in 2009 i think it was
04:50
uh about 60 kilometers more of the great
04:53
wall of china that they didn't know
04:55
existed
04:56
um when they were doing a google earth
04:57
survey of it they discovered a missing
04:59
bit of
04:59
the wall and they discovered a local
05:02
village nearby
05:03
who had just obviously come across this
05:05
wall and gone well no one seems to be
05:07
using this
05:07
and they took the bricks and they made a
05:09
village out of it yeah i think that
05:11
happened with hadrian's wall as well
05:12
didn't it they took bits of
05:13
well and just made houses out of it with
05:16
rome in the renaissance they used old
05:17
buildings to
05:18
make new ones here i heard a brilliant
05:21
fact about
05:22
stones this week oh yeah yeah um so the
05:25
world's largest piece of limestone
05:27
you can see where all the elves are
05:29
coming from for the l series of q a the
05:30
world's largest piece of limestone
05:32
is in lebanon it was cut up by the
05:35
romans and they were going to make a
05:37
massive great big temple with it but
05:38
once they cut it open they realized that
05:40
it was too big to carry
05:41
and so it's still there where they cut
05:43
it
05:45
that's no one's come on guys yeah
05:48
i read recently that um the oldest thing
05:50
on earth they know they well they know
05:52
the oldest rock
05:53
on earth what yeah you would think that
05:56
that's impossible but it's
05:58
it's it's a bit of a cheat it's a it's a
05:59
crystal it's a crystal that they found
06:01
it's 4.4 billion years old
06:03
wow yeah so it's the oldest um i love it
06:06
when you have like a little object that
06:07
you can date
06:08
ash who's a who's a friend of mine uh
06:10
who again
06:12
did our theme tune um he has a a chair
06:15
in his house
06:16
which is a a trunk a bit of a tree trunk
06:19
but it's so old that it's crystallized
06:21
is it crystallized the word no what is
06:22
it it's
06:23
um oh petrified petrified it is and so
06:25
it's but it feels like marble when you
06:27
touch it
06:28
and i was touching it and you kind of go
06:29
this is amazing enough and then he said
06:31
check this out this chair is older than
06:34
flowers wow oh my god
06:38
that's amazing my favorite thing by the
06:40
way about the wall
06:42
the great wall of china is that you know
06:43
when they say oh we found a bit more
06:46
great wall you go you expect it to be
06:48
five more meters of it and then when
06:50
they say 100 kilometers
06:51
yeah that's just i love it when things
06:53
are found in such a ridiculous bulk
06:55
um one of my favorite facts of all time
06:57
is barbara cartland after she died
06:59
they discovered um unpublished novels
07:02
you know like after an author dies
07:04
they're like oh we found
07:05
unpublished laws they found 160
07:08
unpublished novels
07:11
with the great wall you would have just
07:12
thought someone would have like gone
07:13
from one end to the other
07:14
just to say like this i've seen it all
07:16
now yeah mounted all that why haven't
07:17
they done that they find it weird
07:18
well there have been there were two uh
07:21
conceptual artists
07:22
who walked the length of the great wall
07:25
of china towards each other
07:27
and then they met in the middle uh and
07:29
kissed each other once and then they
07:30
never met again and that sounds like a
07:32
dream or a
07:33
very fancy film but it's not it did
07:35
happen the guy died this week who was
07:37
the person who kissed at the end of uh
07:39
world war
07:40
ii do you remember that yeah he did
07:42
iconic pictures
07:46
because i thought there was there was
07:47
doubt over over who it was
07:49
i think these were the guys who were
07:50
accepted because they have other
07:52
pictures that look very similar to them
07:54
but there were other people who claimed
07:55
to be after the war he was a male
07:57
carrier and semi-professional baseball
07:59
player
07:59
oh really yeah and um they were
08:02
identified by
08:03
the houston police department forensic
08:05
artist
08:06
she took about 100 pictures of him using
08:08
a pillow to pose as he did
08:10
and she said she could match the muscles
08:12
ears and other features of the 80 year
08:14
old
08:15
mcduffie to the sailor in the picture
08:17
you don't want to be committing any
08:18
crimes in houston anytime soon do you if
08:20
she
08:21
you've got especially not near an artist
08:22
yes he paints you at the time
08:24
his name is glenn mcduffie and after
08:26
after he was identified he went around
08:28
fundraisers and parties telling his
08:30
story and women would pay ten dollars
08:32
to uh kiss him on the cheek why the
08:35
cheek that i mean that's not
08:36
what they do in the photo you thought
08:38
you'd go for the full-on bent over
08:40
backwards wouldn't you
08:41
oh yeah otherwise what's the point maybe
08:43
that was a bit more like 10 pounds on
08:44
the cheek
08:45
yeah yeah he was changing trains in new
08:48
york when he was told that japan had
08:49
surrendered
08:50
he said i was so happy i ran out in the
08:52
street said mr mcduffie then aged 18 and
08:54
on his way to visit his girlfriend in
08:56
brooklyn
08:57
and then i saw that nurse he said she
08:59
saw me hollering and with a big smile on
09:00
my face i just went right over to her
09:02
and kissed her
09:03
afterwards i just went on the subway
09:04
across the street and went to brooklyn
09:07
can you imagine if she's just reading
09:09
the newspaper the next day and she just
09:10
sees that yeah
09:12
i know those muscles
09:16
[Applause]
09:19
okay fact number two
09:23
okay um yeah my fact this week is there
09:26
is a banker in latvia who will lend you
09:28
money
09:28
using your immortal soul as security so
09:32
in what form do you hand over your
09:33
immortal soul
09:34
when is it like a piece of paper you
09:36
sign no it's just your word i think
09:38
a word i think so yeah this guy's not
09:40
very evil
09:42
weird thing is he's an atheist and he
09:44
doesn't believe in souls this guy
09:45
apparently
09:46
and um what his point is is that it's um
09:50
a lot of people are not repaying their
09:51
loans at the moment and he said
09:53
i decided that in such times a man's
09:55
word is more precious pledge than a car
09:57
or an apartment which are depreciating
09:59
in value
10:00
how much money has he got
10:01
[Laughter]
10:09
it was a maximum of one thousand dollars
10:11
you could borrow right
10:12
there was a gaming company in 2010 who
10:15
put
10:15
in their terms and conditions you know
10:16
the things that no one reads
10:18
and by placing an order you agree to
10:20
grant us a non-transferable option to
10:23
claim for now and ever more
10:25
your immortal soul should we wish to
10:27
exercise this option
10:28
you agree to surrender your immortal
10:30
soul and any claim you may have on it
10:32
within five working days
10:35
yeah but the belief in seoul is quite
10:37
quite common uh like
10:38
even today in this country you'll get um
10:41
i
10:42
happen to know that in some hospitals
10:43
when someone dies they'll open the
10:45
window
10:46
just so that the soul can escape that's
10:48
a question of
10:49
a nurse with a superstition that is not
10:51
policy
10:54
someone said to me that um i i could
10:56
borrow money in exchange for my mortal
10:58
soul
10:59
i don't believe in my immortal soul but
11:01
i think i would hesitate before doing it
11:03
when you go
11:04
like just in case so like i was saying
11:06
before people in history um
11:07
always seem to believe that um that
11:10
people live forever
11:11
after you die you go on and you do
11:13
something else there's a huge number of
11:14
chinese emperors who all
11:16
died because they were seeking out the
11:17
elixir of life yeah
11:19
the man who effectively unified china
11:21
gave it its name he died because of his
11:23
constant search for the elixir of life
11:25
he did a number of things in his life he
11:26
did the um terracotta warriors oh yeah
11:29
and they still haven't gotten into his
11:30
main
11:31
uh that's right ariel's place and it's
11:33
incredible because
11:34
the descriptions of it from legend were
11:37
that it was uh
11:38
made with a river of mercury and um
11:41
they've
11:42
put pests to see if they if it's
11:44
dangerous or not to go in and the
11:45
levels of mercury are extremely high
11:47
extremely high so it kind of suggests
11:49
that maybe he did make it come true
11:51
but he died from drinking mercury
11:53
because he was told that he uh
11:55
was going to live forever that way also
11:57
that doesn't work does it it does
11:58
exactly the opposite it does exactly the
12:00
opposite
12:01
he was also um told by a
12:03
thousand-year-old wizard
12:04
uh who he met once and could never find
12:06
again oh yeah
12:08
that there was an island in which they
12:10
would find the elixir of life he sent
12:12
off a boat
12:13
full of people and uh supposedly that's
12:16
that boat never came back supposedly
12:17
that's the boat that founded japan
12:19
also he sent off another expedition
12:21
after the first one didn't come back
12:23
to look for the island of the islands of
12:24
the immortals only one man came back
12:27
saying that the herbs on the island were
12:28
guarded by fierce whales and that the
12:30
expedition had failed because they had
12:32
been frightened by a huge fish
12:35
speaking of people living forever there
12:36
was a politician in america called
12:38
leonard
12:39
liv forever jones uh he ran for governor
12:41
of kentucky in the 1860s
12:43
and he ran on a platform of being
12:45
immortal
12:46
and because he was immortal he refused
12:48
any medical help of any kind and he died
12:50
of a chest cold in 1868
12:52
[Laughter]
12:55
um just with the age thing i read this
12:57
the other day which i found amazing the
12:58
10th president
12:59
of america john tyler born 1790
13:04
his grandson is still alive yeah wow his
13:07
grandson is pretty impressive
13:09
you know the oldest the oldest complete
13:11
skeleton fan in britain was the guy
13:13
who was found in cheddar gorge who's
13:15
9000 years old and
13:17
you know they tried to trace um some of
13:19
his descendants they decided to just
13:20
look in the local area and they found
13:21
this guy
13:22
adrian target who's a school teacher
13:24
who's a direct descendant on his
13:26
mother's side
13:27
of this 9 000 year old skeleton so he's
13:29
now that like
13:30
he's broken the world record for someone
13:33
who can trace his descendants back
13:34
oh trace his answer back the furthest
13:36
his wife said
13:38
this is all a bit of a surprise but
13:39
maybe it explains why he likes his
13:41
stakes rare
13:44
that's great that does it that
13:47
everything's falling into place um do
13:49
you guys know about joyce heth
13:51
no no she was a she was one do you know
13:54
pt barnum the circle great yeah
13:57
from the 19th century america one month
13:59
one born every minute which he didn't
14:00
ever say unfortunately
14:02
but joyce heth was one of his earliest
14:04
successes she was 161 year old
14:07
african-american woman who was she well
14:10
this is the thing
14:11
she was part of his shows and he claimed
14:13
she had been
14:14
george washington's nanny
14:17
after she died um he hired someone
14:21
to test it and these the surgeon
14:23
responsible said
14:25
this woman is about 80 years old which
14:28
he claimed that the autopsy victim was
14:30
another person and that the real joyce
14:32
was alive in europe
14:34
[Laughter]
14:35
it was good in those days when you could
14:37
just walk around pretending to be
14:39
something
14:39
yeah yeah yeah so one of your favorite
14:42
facts is about the two headed
14:44
mexicans yeah yeah yeah yeah pascal
14:46
penang
14:47
the two headed mexican he's uh he's got
14:49
one head and he's from texas
14:58
time to move on to fact number three
15:01
which is
15:02
you hannah yeah um so i
15:05
found out this week that for 100 years
15:08
almost
15:09
all the maps we had of africa contained
15:11
a mountain range that didn't exist
15:13
they were called the mountains of kong
15:15
it was this enormous mountain
15:18
but the map first appeared in 1798 uh
15:21
it was an english geographer james
15:23
reynold who recorded the you know
15:25
park who went to africa yeah
15:27
old african niger so he was recording uh
15:29
the notes of mungo park and he just
15:31
elaborated a bit
15:32
and he invented the mountains of kong
15:34
which stretched like from
15:35
the east side to the west side of africa
15:37
the only problem with it i think was
15:38
that explorers then went there but they
15:40
because he said it was impossible he
15:42
said there were mountains of stupendous
15:44
height
15:44
it was in an insuperable barrier so
15:46
explorers didn't even bother to try and
15:48
cross it
15:49
oh because so they didn't get they were
15:50
like no the mountains are over there
15:52
can't get outside
16:02
we're going back to london but that's
16:03
that's my favorite fact about this whole
16:05
thing is that there's an explorer whose
16:07
main discovery
16:08
was undiscovering the mountain yeah his
16:10
name is louie's gust of
16:12
binger there's a town named after him
16:15
bingeville
16:16
it's in um it doesn't exist yeah he made
16:18
it up yeah
16:19
perfect but no he uh he did he
16:22
discovered he undiscovered the mountains
16:24
of kong
16:25
speaking of places that don't exist um
16:27
like bingaville
16:28
yeah okay well there's a place called
16:32
aglow in new york state and it was made
16:35
up by a guy he put it on a map
16:36
and he i think it was nanogram of his
16:39
name or an anagram of someone's name
16:41
and um it was a completely made-up thing
16:43
but it got copied by maps and copied by
16:44
max and copied by maps
16:46
and then someone put a gas station where
16:48
it should be and they called it
16:50
um aglow gas station and now there's
16:52
house there
16:53
and now it has become a real place so
16:56
now he's
16:56
gonna he is no longer a liar yeah you
16:58
know when apple maps launched last year
17:00
or the year before was it and there were
17:02
all those errors um that were hilarious
17:04
one of which was the senkaku islands
17:06
the japan and china dispute and uh apple
17:09
maps just
17:10
made two so there was one on the chinese
17:12
side of one on the japanese side just
17:13
side by side
17:14
isn't that nice that's a good way of
17:16
solving conflict it is a good idea i
17:18
just made two crimeas that russia
17:21
wouldn't have to worry about it yeah
17:22
because how often do they really go
17:23
there they just want to write it down
17:25
don't they that they own it
17:26
they simply do it's for mineral rights
17:28
as well because the
17:30
mexico wanted uh there's a beremeja
17:33
island uh is strategically important
17:35
because if you get the waters around it
17:37
you get a lot of oil deposits
17:38
um and unfortunately for mexico it also
17:41
vanished several years ago so now they
17:42
don't own that bit of water
17:44
it's you know because what you do is you
17:46
own a certain
17:47
distance around your uh land and what it
17:50
used to be it was the distance that a
17:52
cannon could fire
17:53
so you'd let you'd own say a cannon
17:55
could fire 500 meters that's the
17:57
distance that you would own out to sea
17:59
wow and that it's changed but that's
18:01
what it originally was yeah
18:03
wow i think that might have been in
18:04
reagan's time uh certainly
18:06
i'm pretty sure it was in the 80s
18:08
america changed their rules and said
18:10
okay it used to be the common distance
18:11
now we're going to say we actually hold
18:13
10 kilometers out to sea and that
18:15
increased the
18:16
area of the united states by an enormous
18:19
amount
18:20
i feel like we should mention just in
18:22
case there are people that don't know
18:23
about california and the fact that it
18:24
was an island
18:25
until the 18th century which is probably
18:27
the most famous
18:28
map cock-up and lasted from i think it
18:30
was 1510 the first map appeared that
18:33
made california into an island
18:34
um and yeah like frances drake went out
18:37
sailed out there
18:38
quarter sailed out there all sent
18:40
voyages out there and
18:41
none of them managed to just come back
18:43
and say no it definitely isn't good i
18:44
think in one of the early britannicas
18:46
and said um it is unsure whether it is
18:48
an island or a peninsula yeah
18:50
there's a theory that got confused with
18:51
guam which is
18:53
if you look at a map not very close
18:57
it wasn't very far they were doing yeah
18:59
they were bigging themselves up they
19:00
were claiming they saw the ground do you
19:01
know the good guam facts
19:03
no and so guam is this island in the
19:06
pacific
19:06
uh owned by america they have a naval
19:09
base there and an airbaser
19:11
and they um dropped some snakes there
19:13
some brown
19:14
um snakes by accident one day just a
19:17
couple of them
19:18
and with no other predators on the
19:20
island they uh multiplied and multiplied
19:21
and multiplied
19:22
and now
19:26
they've now dropped dead poisoned mice
19:29
onto the island stuffed with 80
19:31
milligrams of paracetamol which is
19:33
deadly to brown tree snakes
19:34
tied to miniature cardboard parachutes
19:38
um i've read a story which is in the
19:40
news about a mystery ghost ship that's
19:43
carrying nothing but cannibal rats
19:45
that's a very it's the same thing
19:46
they've multiplied and multiplied and
19:48
now
19:48
they're worried that this ship is gonna
19:50
they don't know if the ship is still out
19:51
there
19:52
because they're supposed to be floating
19:53
towards ireland wasn't it yeah that is
19:55
amazing you could say they were pirates
20:03
i have seen this this has been debunked
20:05
apparently they are no more inclined to
20:06
eat one another than humans dr penny
20:08
hawkins of the rspca said
20:10
rats have a really bad press and this
20:11
doesn't help
20:20
okay let's head to the final fact of the
20:23
show fact number four that's you andy
20:25
okay this is that male pennsylvania
20:28
grass spiders
20:29
are much more likely to approach a
20:30
female for sex
20:32
if she has recently killed and eaten
20:34
another male
20:35
is that because i think she's already
20:36
seated so maybe she won't eat them this
20:38
is the thing
20:39
females typically only eat one male
20:42
so if your girlfriend has already killed
20:45
and eaten one male she's probably not
20:46
going to kill her neat
20:47
yeah it's like you is the theory that
20:49
for me yeah
20:51
and also this is some females don't
20:54
um kill and eat males and there's these
20:57
blurred lines here
20:58
exactly because you'd be waiting the
21:00
whole time going so have you eaten
21:02
anyone recently
21:04
that's why you wouldn't approach because
21:06
if you knew that females ate
21:07
generally only one male you would think
21:09
oh well i'll definitely go for the one
21:10
who's
21:11
definitely not going to eat me yeah
21:14
the redbucks actually ask for it don't
21:15
they red male spiders
21:17
sort of beg to be eaten and i don't
21:19
think people are 100 sure why so
21:22
basically they
21:22
um they come up to the female who's like
21:25
50 times as big as them
21:26
and they get onto their abdomen and they
21:28
put their palp their kind of spider
21:30
penis
21:30
into the the lady and then while they're
21:33
doing that they also use their pal to
21:34
kind of somersault themselves
21:36
into the spider's mouth and then she'd
21:39
choose them because she's got two
21:40
openings so they can put the power pin
21:41
both and it's best if they get in there
21:42
with both
21:43
they so they repel themselves into her
21:45
mouth she feeds on them for a bit
21:47
so she sucks food out of this like
21:49
male's abdomen while he's still inserted
21:51
into her
21:52
and then he inserts himself into like
21:54
hole number two
21:55
and then spins back again into her mouth
21:57
to let her eat the rest of him
22:00
there are more which there are more
22:02
males which have techniques for not
22:04
being eaten if those species which don't
22:05
want to be
22:06
so some uh tetragnathid
22:10
please don't write in the pronunciation
22:11
those spiders have specialized jaws
22:13
which hold
22:14
open the jaws of females during
22:16
copulation
22:17
because they they basically carry around
22:20
sticks with which they can just lever
22:22
open her mouth
22:23
as long as it takes to have
22:28
spider is very similar to the first guy
22:30
you were talking about
22:31
um but they will only mate or they
22:33
prefer to mate with a spider who is
22:35
currently eating another male because
22:37
she's busy
22:40
just like during dinner he'll prefer to
22:41
do it don't mind me wow
22:43
just here wow that's pretty ultimate
22:45
wingman behavior
22:47
don't worry i'll take the fleck for this
22:48
one i really wish that women had
22:51
what um loads of other animals have
22:54
loads of spiders insects slugs
22:56
reptiles birds have and including uh the
22:58
red back spider which is
23:00
cryptic female choice um basically
23:04
it is the ability if someone has
23:06
recently had sex with you to decide
23:08
whether or not you're going to bother
23:09
accepting their sperm and allow them to
23:10
fertilize you
23:11
so they think that might be why it's
23:14
good to get eaten as a red back by
23:16
the woman because then she likes you
23:18
she's like oh yeah you sacrifice
23:19
yourself to me
23:20
all right fine i'll let your sperm
23:22
fertilize my egg
23:23
um so they can she can literally say um
23:25
nah not really didn't really like
23:27
how tasty he was yeah i guess so yeah
23:29
you were delicious
23:30
i'll definitely have your offspring
23:32
that's amazing but i like the term
23:34
cryptic female choice
23:35
yes that is wonderful so cannibalism is
23:38
quite common in
23:39
animal kingdom not just in spiders yeah
23:41
um like
23:42
one of my favorite ones are those sharks
23:44
i can't remember the species but they
23:46
in the womb there's more than one shark
23:49
so they haven't been born yet but they
23:50
will fight each other and eat each other
23:52
before they're even born i like rosemary
23:55
and i like the um
23:56
octopuses who will eat their own arm if
23:58
they're stressed
24:00
so it's like auto cannibalism that's
24:02
kind of why what purpose does that serve
24:05
just stressed calms you down comes right
24:07
down just like biting your nails have a
24:09
cup of tea
24:10
and eat this
24:13
i would cease to be calm so soon into
24:15
the process of eating my own
24:16
arm so going back to spiders they are
24:18
cannibals aren't they and i remember
24:20
reading i don't know if this fact is
24:21
true or not but um
24:23
if you put ten thousand spiders in a
24:24
room and just leave them to themselves
24:26
then
24:26
they'll all keep eating each other and
24:28
in the end you'll just end up with one
24:29
big
24:30
fat satiated spider so it's body would
24:33
just be bullying yeah it'll be on tiny
24:34
legs
24:36
wouldn't it be wouldn't that be the
24:37
thing but these legs aren't going to
24:38
grow spiders don't feed very often do
24:40
this
24:42
we should become a giant so let's all
24:43
eat each other
24:47
do you know that spider's brains are so
24:50
are big enough that they spill into
24:52
their legs
24:53
they're not they're not big enough their
24:54
heads are so small
24:56
you're right that is the way let's say
24:58
it again so their brains spill into
24:59
their legs
25:00
they have very small bodies as i said
25:02
very small heads
25:03
but they're mostly legs so some spiders
25:05
the brains will spill into their legs
25:08
because
25:08
the brains are bigger than their heads
25:10
it would be annoying though to think
25:11
that every time you've tripped over and
25:12
grazed your knee you might have brain
25:13
damage
25:14
imagine i'll stress stupid yeah you
25:16
probably bite your own arm off
25:17
[Laughter]
25:19
but lions kill each other which i didn't
25:21
really realize and um so if
25:23
a female line has got a bunch of cubs
25:26
that she's nursing and a male lion sees
25:28
her and thinks actually i want to
25:28
copulate with her
25:30
he can go and kill all the cubs but
25:31
within 24 hours of the male murdering
25:33
their cubs they'll be back on heat
25:35
they recover that fast there's no
25:37
morning period they're just like
25:38
they're dead also the lion king
25:42
really would just been the rest of them
25:43
going simba just get over it mate
25:45
move on have some chance you're missing
25:47
out with your sex time here
25:48
and you are telling us about how often
25:50
they have sex they're quite
25:52
yes when when lines are in heat it's 20
25:54
to 40 times a day
25:56
but it's always very for very short
25:58
periods the
25:59
the each coupling as they call it lasts
26:01
for maybe 30 seconds
26:02
as well wasn't there something about
26:04
ladybirds about that yes ladybirds
26:06
have um they have a lot of sex but they
26:09
have sex for a very long time as well so
26:11
often it's for at least one or two hours
26:13
um sometimes it's up to nine hours but
26:15
that's mostly because the male
26:17
wants to prevent the female from mating
26:19
with any other males
26:20
also male ladybirds are so
26:22
indiscriminate with who they approach
26:24
that when they meet another ladybird
26:25
they will mount it
26:26
whether it's the same species of
26:28
ladybird whether or not it's the same
26:29
sex if it's a male ladybug
26:31
they just quickly dismount and pretend
26:32
nothing's happened and walk off
26:34
does it even have to be a ladybird like
26:36
when a ladybird
26:46
[Applause]
26:46
[Music]
26:50
ladybug
26:53

27:54
you

=5
00:00
we run it on qi a few years ago yeah um
00:02
which was
00:03
there's no such thing as a fish there's
00:04
no such thing as a fish no seriously
00:06
it's in
00:06
the oxford dictionary of underwater life
00:10
it says it right there first paragraph
00:11
no such thing as a fish
00:19
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:21
no such thing as a fish
00:23
a new weekly podcast coming to you from
00:25
the qi offices in covent garden my name
00:27
is dan schreiber i'm sitting here with
00:29
three elves james andy and anna and once
00:32
again we've just
00:33
got around the microphone and we're
00:34
gonna share our favorite facts from the
00:36
last seven days so
00:37
in no particular order here they are
00:44
all right so uh let's begin with you
00:46
anna what's your fact uh so this week i
00:49
discovered that
00:50
uh rats were once the size of hippos
00:52
that is humongous yeah it's pretty big
00:54
well basically it's not all rats it was
00:56
discovered in 2008 it's called the
00:58
josepho artigasium on ac we'll put that
01:01
on the website so you can look it up
01:03
and um they think they could have grown
01:04
up to 2.5 tons
01:07
um wow so that's like the average uh
01:09
hippo i think is about one
01:11
times the largest known snake in history
01:14
and this was called
01:15
titanoboa caragenensis um it was
01:18
about the length of about three or four
01:21
cars
01:22
what what length would that be so that
01:24
is 50 feet long
01:26
what kind of cars like a lamborghini or
01:27
one of those little ones that you can
01:28
park
01:33
yelling out the side of it that's but no
01:35
there is a longer snake that was
01:36
discovered it's just never
01:37
fully been authenticated which was percy
01:40
fawcett the great explorer
01:41
he was a snake no he claimed to have
01:44
shot
01:44
a 62-foot anaconda you know and he was
01:48
he was very reputable as an explorer so
01:50
he wouldn't have he wouldn't have
01:51
bragged in 1910
01:52
theodore roosevelt offered a reward
01:55
to the first person who presented a
01:57
snake that was 30 feet long
01:59
and i don't think anyone ever claimed it
02:03
well it's is that quite clever because
02:04
is that a catch-22 or something similar
02:06
because you've offered this reward but
02:08
once you've shot a 30-foot plus snake
02:09
how are you transporting it back
02:12
um to show it off and also even if you
02:14
do see a
02:15
snake that's longer than 30 feet my
02:17
first thought would be to run away not
02:18
to capture it for a while
02:20
you don't have the hunter's mentality i
02:22
mean if all people thought like that the
02:24
stately homes of england would be much
02:25
emptier
02:28
so what else do we know about this rat
02:29
um okay so
02:31
it was actually found in 1987 in
02:34
uh uruguay it was apparently it was just
02:36
put in a box in the natural history
02:37
museum it makes you wonder what else is
02:39
in boxes at the moment
02:41
which people put aside five or ten years
02:43
ago yeah i thought i'll deal with that
02:44
later do you remember that new species
02:46
they found in a market in cambodia or
02:48
something oh yeah it was a lot it was
02:50
thought to be extinct
02:51
it was a rat and yeah they thought it
02:53
was exciting because it was extinct they
02:54
found it on a kebab
02:55
didn't you yeah well no in lao as well i
02:58
remember bill bailey
03:00
his neighbor uh went to lao and had a
03:03
picture of what he thought was a new
03:04
species of i think it was porcupine
03:07
and he showed bill and bill took it to
03:08
uh someone who studies porcupines and
03:11
they said yeah this is a new species and
03:12
it was just there sitting in the
03:13
marketplace
03:14
and the guy said as well that on this
03:16
table because it was a bunch of animals
03:17
being
03:18
sold for food he was like there's at
03:19
least like three or four new species
03:21
that we don't know about in science yet
03:22
sitting on this table that reminds me of
03:24
another one there was a guy who
03:25
bought a sea urchin i think it was on
03:27
ebay and that turned out to be a new
03:29
species
03:30
right first of all why was he buying a
03:33
sea urchin
03:34
on ebay remember in the 19th century you
03:37
would have
03:38
um like old explorers would get a load
03:40
of they would go on
03:41
an exploration they'd buy a load of
03:43
weird stuff and keep it in their house
03:45
like sir johnson's museum up the road
03:48
and
03:48
i like to think that when i have a
03:50
bigger house i'll have a cabinet of
03:51
curiosities and it'll be just stuff i
03:53
bought off ebay
03:55
and it's just a new way of exploring and
03:57
finding new things yeah yeah
03:58
someone recently found some of the first
04:01
charlie chaplin
04:02
bits of film considered to be lost and
04:04
that was an ebay purchase amazing
04:06
yeah there's constant finds going on not
04:08
just with the natural world
04:09
we just need a really big spreadsheet as
04:11
a humanity and then if we just put
04:13
everything on there that we don't have
04:14
you can just check in according to what
04:16
you know about like a stock tank
04:17
yeah like the internet well you can call
04:20
it whatever you like
04:22
if you want to make up a name for it
04:23
that's fine so going back to massive
04:26
animals i was reading about the largest
04:28
kangaroos
04:29
and apparently they were they're extinct
04:30
now but there were kangaroos that were
04:32
up to nine feet
04:33
10 tall in australia and
04:36
imagine how big that is what kind of
04:38
bounce could they go
04:39
well exactly and i read that they were
04:42
hunted to extinction
04:43
and that's pretty hardcore hunting isn't
04:46
it they're not like you james they
04:47
didn't
04:48
just run away and go back to ebay but
04:50
hunting a 10-foot kangaroo
04:53
as well yeah it's not like they were
04:54
shooting them down with rifles
04:56
i really like imagining what it would
04:57
have been like if you were like dropped
04:59
on earth any
05:00
long period of time ago like three
05:01
million years ago it just would have
05:02
been completely mental because at the
05:04
same time that rats were like sporting
05:06
this enormous size
05:07
there were elephants in cyprus that
05:09
weighed only 200 kilograms
05:11
oh yeah really still pretty how big i
05:14
don't know how big it is
05:15
do you know what i genuinely when i went
05:18
oh
05:18
for some reason i thought that was the
05:20
size of um my fist
05:22
yeah yeah i don't know why it sounded so
05:26
tiny i wasn't thinking about you have a
05:27
very inflated sense of your own strength
05:29
as well
05:31
there's a cool thing so animals shrink
05:34
ten times as fast as they grow
05:37
so in 24 million generations an
05:40
animal the size of a mouse can grow
05:41
until it's the size of an elephant but
05:43
it takes a much shorter time for them to
05:45
shrink back down again about two million
05:47
generations it must be weird if you fast
05:49
forward the footage of earth let's say
05:51
somehow
05:52
there was someone filming the whole
05:54
thing just to watch these animals just
05:55
one suddenly go
05:57
another one and the and the power play
06:00
between them it would have been a time
06:01
when elephants would be like stay away
06:03
from the
06:03
massive 20 times the size of us things
06:06
over there
06:06
and now a rat would be petrified of a or
06:09
not
06:10
aren't elephants scout of mice is that a
06:12
hangover
06:13
or is that something you saw in a
06:14
cartoon i'm definitely in a cartoon is
06:16
that not a real thing
06:18
they are scared of bees i think but not
06:20
i was surprised to learn that queen
06:22
victoria had a rat did she
06:23
yeah she had an official rat catcher he
06:26
was
06:26
he he doubled as his job he was a rat
06:28
catcher and a mole destroyer
06:30
and his name was jack black he
06:32
supposedly um
06:34
also gave a pet rap to beatrix potter
06:36
wow
06:37
yeah and so her book uh samuel whiskers
06:40
is dedicated to the rat of the same name
06:44
he was those job titles were by
06:45
appointments of queen victoria hang on
06:47
you're saying that she had a rat
06:48
and also a rat catcher and did he catch
06:51
it yes
06:51
so would she release it no she waited
06:54
for him to catch
06:55
ceremonially
06:59
and now the 4th of august the catching
07:01
of the rep begins
07:11
ok let's move on to fact number 2. i was
07:13
reading this month's 14 times magazine
07:15
it was an article
07:16
on the pope and that's where i found
07:18
this fact which is
07:19
during his 27-year run as poke john paul
07:23
ii
07:23
took over 100 ski vacations very
07:26
extravagant
07:26
and he did it he did it for a year uh
07:29
yeah he wouldn't have taken as many when
07:31
he was old
07:32
no no he he he did it for about a
07:34
15-year period
07:35
whoa yeah well so he took like seven a
07:37
year or so yeah
07:38
yeah he used to sneak out he used to get
07:40
very bored with the vatican and so they
07:41
would
07:42
genuinely they would get into a car and
07:43
they would drive to the mountains and he
07:45
stayed in a resort
07:47
with a mate of his who he would go
07:49
skiing with and he was a ski instructor
07:51
and this guy's i'd like to think he
07:52
would be in full
07:53
garb as well but his friend said that he
07:56
skied like a swallow
07:57
is that good i don't know i don't know
08:00
what that means
08:01
because swallow's almost famous for not
08:03
skiing
08:06
it's the first thing you think when you
08:07
say the word swallows not skis
08:10
but he he was uh he was a very sporty
08:12
guy he was old john
08:13
paul he was a goalkeeper wasn't he when
08:15
he was a yeah he was
08:17
he played for his school in his
08:18
university and he might have carried on
08:20
with world war ii haven't
08:21
broken out well his his um the pitch
08:23
that he used to play on in his hometown
08:25
is a sacred
08:26
site that pilgrims often go if there's a
08:28
list of
08:29
places to go that's one of the places
08:30
one of his old fields yeah
08:32
do they take away turf or things like
08:33
that the article that i read
08:35
uh was an article to do with the fact
08:37
that a bit of clothing
08:38
with a stain of his blood was stolen
08:40
recently and i know that uh
08:42
that would be seen as quite sacrilegious
08:44
to steal something like that but it
08:45
seems that everything that was to do
08:46
with his
08:47
is being left so i doubt anyone would
08:48
take any turf out of respect okay
08:50
because they see them as kind of holy
08:52
i don't know like he's gonna be um
08:53
probably um a saint if he's not already
08:56
he's this yeah
08:57
this april 27th he's a fast track
08:59
doesn't he
09:00
yeah people just love relics and i
09:01
remember reading i don't know if this is
09:03
true but then
09:04
they they gave away relics for free on
09:06
the internet after he died so that
09:08
people wouldn't then start trying to
09:10
steal and sell relics because they would
09:12
flood the market with these other ones
09:13
yeah there was there was someone in the
09:16
14th or 13th century who
09:18
um bit off the finger from the hand
09:22
of a relic in a church do you remember
09:24
this james i remember that story but
09:26
yeah
09:26
you sort of bend down to oh please i'll
09:28
kiss the finger the holy finger of the
09:30
holy hand at the same and then just
09:32
bite off a joint and keep it in your
09:33
mouth until you've left guys i got it
09:37
did you know the car did you know that
09:40
he was a member of the harlem
09:41
globetrotters
09:42
i i did say that yeah no because he he
09:45
was a total sports enthusiast so on top
09:47
of being
09:48
a um on top of skiing he also uh spent a
09:51
lot of time with muhammad ali whenever
09:53
he got the chance to
09:54
he um so he was a huge boxing enthusiast
09:57
as
09:58
is the dalai lama loves boxing i don't
10:00
know what it is about religious heads
10:02
i should say that my source for this is
10:03
brian blessed
10:05
who claims he sparred with the dalai
10:07
lama
10:08
does not look like he throw a weighty
10:10
punch like not on your
10:11
you know 23 stone fist level at all but
10:14
like he really looks
10:15
pretty weak no offense yeah i suppose
10:21
anyway i so yeah i got this fact uh from
10:23
the floridian times magazine which is a
10:24
magazine about the world of strange
10:26
phenomena i highly recommend it
10:28
it's fantastic one of the q i elves
10:30
writes for it matt coward he writes um
10:32
a misconception column for it yeah which
10:35
is like a general ignorance thing and
10:36
it's great
10:36
it shocked me when i read in this
10:38
article that he went skiing because you
10:40
kind of imagined that popes
10:41
grew up as religious people straight
10:44
from the get-go didn't have a life
10:46
before the latest pope that we had pope
10:48
francis
10:48
one of his early jobs was he was a
10:50
nightclub bouncer um
10:51
actually when you think about it isn't
10:52
his role effectively as like
10:54
one of the greatest banter now no well
10:57
he could like
10:58
when you did something bad he could let
10:59
you into heaven who's god in this is god
11:01
the manager of the club
11:03
yeah godzilla that sounds right i
11:05
thought god was a dj according to that
11:07
popular
11:08
song life is a dance fall the pope is
11:10
the bouncer
11:12
have about ministry of sound
11:18
also the people says he loves um the
11:21
hobbit and lord of the rings
11:22
he does it and often in his talks he
11:24
cites he'll use examples where he'll say
11:27
it's like frodo and bilbo like you'll
11:29
use them as absolutely funny yeah yeah
11:31
he has a
11:32
here's a degree in chemistry i wouldn't
11:33
have expected that and he has one lung
11:35
he has one lung
11:36
yeah what the other one i
11:39
just you know he gave it to the poor um
11:42
he didn't do that yeah here's the thing
11:44
he can't have donated it to the poor
11:46
because the pope is not allowed to
11:47
donate his organs
11:48
i read this in his article a while ago
11:50
yeah and the
11:51
there was a guy who's a member of the
11:53
vatican health council and they asked
11:54
him about it
11:55
and he said he couldn't do it because
11:56
the body of the pope effectively
11:58
belonged to the entire catholic church
12:00
you said a thing about the pope's uh the
12:02
pope dying
12:03
or the death death of the pope yeah yeah
12:07
it's basically when a pope dies i
12:08
haven't done this for the last two popes
12:10
but every pope before they have done
12:12
to confirm that he's dead they gently
12:14
tap him on the head with a silver hammer
12:15
and call his name out three times
12:18
hey pope they say his birth name just to
12:21
make sure he's really dead it's a
12:22
tradition it's a small silver hammer
12:24
because i remember reading an article
12:25
about when the pope died and
12:27
there was a brilliant line in it i
12:29
always remember it's um
12:30
when a pope dies his seals are defaced
12:33
and his ring is split in two which is
12:35
going to be
12:35
particularly poignant when the latest
12:37
one goes because of his lord of the
12:38
rings and hobbit
12:40
that has to be taken to mount here
12:45
you know i i also um i was suddenly
12:48
thinking i don't know much about how
12:50
they choose a pope
12:51
like how do they actually find the next
12:52
pope and you know i could technically be
12:54
a pope
12:55
as if they could choose me if they
12:56
wanted to you should be because the rule
12:58
is i'm pretty sure this is right the
13:00
rule is that
13:01
um as long as you're a baptized and
13:02
confirmed roman catholic
13:04
you could technically be chosen as a
13:06
pope i mean they usually choose a
13:07
cardinal but
13:08
theoretically they could just knock on
13:10
my door and say you're in
13:11
the only thing that might stop me is i
13:13
think i might have been um
13:15
excommunicated already um you think you
13:17
might have been excommunicated yeah
13:19
that's a very
13:20
hazy night out isn't it
13:23
i was in this nightclub
13:29
don't worry i know the bouncer
13:32
well what it is is there's there's
13:34
certain things that if you do them
13:36
you can be excommunicated even without
13:38
any priest or pope say so
13:40
they're just so bad that you are
13:42
excommunicated
13:43
and i have done one of these things and
13:45
that is
13:46
mentioning jesus's foreskin and because
13:50
he's done it again he's done it again
13:52
james your chances of being pope
13:54
are narrowing all the time
13:57
well we mentioned it on qi and so as
14:00
part of the
14:01
as a team who wrote that wrote that
14:03
script yeah that means as a roman
14:05
catholic i think i'm out
14:06
everyone who works on the production has
14:08
now
14:10
out of the running especially you i know
14:12
you would have made a brilliant pope
14:13
thank you i know i think it only on the
14:15
count if you're a roman catholic
14:17
the rest of you are going to hell anyway
14:18
right
14:20
looking forward to it um so okay if you
14:23
were going to be made pope
14:24
um they put a new rule in quite recently
14:27
which is you have to be under 80 to vote
14:29
why do you have to be under 80 that
14:30
seems unfair anyone who can successfully
14:32
complete a black run
14:35
can vote but so do you know do you know
14:37
how they so they they obviously select
14:39
the pope but they have to
14:40
they have to ask the pope first off
14:42
there's an official
14:44
sentence that needs to be said and they
14:45
all go no no
14:47
me i come on no so the question that
14:50
they get asked
14:51
is do you freely accept your election as
14:53
supreme
14:54
pontiff and the one word answer that
14:56
they give
14:58
is accepto
15:04
it's more harry potter than lord of the
15:05
rings
15:07
and then they walk through the door of
15:09
tears and then they get fitted with the
15:11
fisherman's ring
15:12
which is the ring that you were talking
15:14
about earlier that we now need to throw
15:15
into the fires of mordor i
15:16
i just want to say this this is pretty
15:18
non-sequitur but it's my favorite fact
15:20
about any popes in history
15:22
uh in the 15th century pope sixtus iv
15:25
granted a formal dispensation to the
15:27
cardinal of saint lucia
15:28
to cool himself by sodomy during the
15:31
three hot months of june july and august
15:34
amazing that's very thoughtful i'm just
15:37
i'm just so warm
15:40
i really think that if i was allowed to
15:42
commit sodomy
15:43
you're much cooler and you're considered
15:45
maybe a cold bar
15:47
that is an amazing amazing
15:56
okay let's move on to fact number three
15:59
which
16:00
is you james a hundred years ago a
16:02
quarter of the residents of new york
16:04
would move house every single may the
16:06
first at exactly
16:08
9 a.m that's extraordinary
16:11
why i read this the other day i can't
16:13
remember where i came across it but i
16:15
was just
16:15
astonished that i hadn't heard it before
16:17
it just seems like the kind of thing
16:18
that i would have come across
16:20
and what would happen is people who were
16:22
renting their houses would have a
16:24
one-year lease
16:25
and all the leases would end on the same
16:27
day and the landlords would up the rent
16:29
so much that they needed to find a
16:30
better deal
16:31
and everyone would do this and everyone
16:33
would move
16:34
and it was absolute pandemonium absolute
16:37
chaos
16:37
unsurprising yeah yeah it sounds like
16:40
what a terrible system
16:41
well it is when did that go up to um
16:43
that was until
16:44
um the 1940s i think but i mean it was
16:47
more common in the late 19th century
16:50
and early 20th century that is
16:53
it's such a bad idea i know because
16:55
moving is the most stressful thing you
16:56
can do
16:57
what if you were doing it at the same
16:58
time as a quarter of all residents of
17:00
your city
17:01
goodness maybe it's something moral
17:03
supporting about it
17:04
and you know you come out onto the
17:05
street it's like oh yeah same for you
17:07
hey
17:08
a bit like the blitz spirit kind of yeah
17:09
right exactly it's and
17:11
and something that i read about it was
17:13
that the big
17:14
kind of important people suddenly of
17:16
this of that um
17:18
of the city where the cartman the people
17:20
who drove the car who suddenly were
17:22
treated with respect that they'd never
17:23
seen
17:24
people who would be bowing to them
17:26
calling them mr cartman
17:29
and christina
17:33
[Laughter]
17:39
[Music]
17:41
mother wrote about it and i just want to
17:44
quickly read out this little passage
17:46
and she said on the first of may the
17:48
city of new york
17:49
has the appearance of sending off a
17:50
population flying from the plague
17:53
or of a town which has surrendered on
17:54
condition of carrying away
17:56
all their goods and chattels everyone i
17:59
spoke to on the subject complained of
18:00
this custom
18:01
as most annoying but all assured me it
18:04
was unavoidable
18:05
and what i love about this is it's
18:07
something which is completely obviously
18:09
impractical
18:10
but people still did it and just thought
18:11
well this is obviously the only way
18:13
we're just gonna have to put up with it
18:14
and i think that's happened quite a few
18:16
times in history i think it's quite cool
18:17
in india at the moment they're trying to
18:20
change the time
18:21
by shifting this certain area of india
18:24
by 30 minutes forward
18:25
they would save 2.7 billion units of
18:28
electricity every year
18:29
and that's the reason they want to do it
18:31
but everyone's petrified of it because
18:32
they're saying it's going to cause chaos
18:34
and i it just made me think that you
18:36
know daylight savings is a thing that we
18:38
all just
18:38
very yeah we just do it we just say okay
18:41
the time has changed
18:42
that's fine yeah i mean maybe in the
18:44
future that will be they'll just look at
18:45
it
18:46
these guys were idiots remember when um
18:48
they wanted to
18:49
work out where the um the zero
18:52
longitude was yeah and it goes through
18:55
greenwich now
18:56
um so we call it gmt um but at the same
18:59
time the french wanted to put it through
19:00
paris
19:01
which means if we'd have done that it
19:02
would have been called pmt
19:03
[Music]
19:05
you were telling me a fact about this
19:08
whole thing of
19:08
a chaotic movement and it was to do with
19:11
um the swapping of
19:12
so yeah this was in sweden i can't
19:14
remember what year it was but they
19:15
always drove on the left-hand side and
19:17
they decided to drive on the right-hand
19:19
side
19:19
and they decided to do it all at one
19:21
time so everyone would drive on the left
19:24
and then all of a sudden they would all
19:25
decide to drive on the right at a
19:27
certain time
19:28
it's amazing do you want to phase it in
19:30
gradually no no
19:32
deep end so what happened was everyone
19:35
would drive on the left
19:36
until 4 50 and then come to a complete
19:40
stop
19:40
no one was allowed to drive for 10
19:42
minutes and then everyone would
19:43
carefully move to the right hand side of
19:45
the road
19:46
and start driving again and you weren't
19:48
allowed to start again until
19:49
5. what did that can you imagine if
19:52
you're the only person in the country
19:53
who hadn't got the memo
19:55
what's going on that would be brilliant
19:59
did it work well weirdly it did and
20:02
there's
20:02
lots of pictures it looks a bit like
20:04
chaotic but it was called um i'm going
20:06
to get this wrong i'm sure but it's
20:07
something like
20:08
herger traffic on lag england or they
20:11
call it dargan h which means the h day
20:14
and on that day there were only 125
20:16
reported traffic accidents
20:18
but on a normal monday there would be
20:20
between 130 and 198
20:23
and there were no fatalities so actually
20:25
it was a safer day than normal
20:27
so we should switch sides of the road
20:28
every single day to keep fatalities down
20:31
we've got a moral duty to do that
20:36
but you would be more careful it's like
20:37
the idea of um some
20:39
innovator has come up with the spike in
20:41
the middle of the steering wheel
20:43
which is pointing directly at your heart
20:46
which would make us all drive very
20:48
carefully
20:49
the spike of damocles yeah i think
20:52
that's a brilliant idea
20:54
don't get an airbag get a spike if you
20:56
really want to be safe
20:57
there would be a lot fewer people hit by
20:59
cars but a lot more people driving cars
21:00
would die like
21:02
spike related injuries another spike i'm
21:05
afraid
21:06
well i think we can make this a quick
21:07
autopsy can't wait
21:09
the husband's been tragically impaled by
21:12
his new
21:13
hyundai tragically impaled because he
21:15
couldn't get the right
21:16
clutch
21:19
yet another seat adjustment accident
21:23
and there's another even more
21:25
complicated theory that actually it
21:26
wouldn't affect the number of statistics
21:28
we have because people always
21:29
drive at the very edge of safety there
21:32
was a study done um
21:33
on this i can't remember all the details
21:35
but there was a study done
21:36
and it was a level crossing and the
21:39
they measured how quickly people were
21:41
driving and it was just about
21:43
the safest they could do and slam on and
21:45
still not hit a train
21:47
and then they put a hedge in front of
21:50
the level crossing so you wouldn't be
21:51
able to see it until a bit later and
21:52
they found that people slowed down but
21:54
only to the extent that they would have
21:56
to slam on and just about miss the train
21:59
wow we are risk takers so going back to
22:01
the obviously impractical
22:02
in micronesia they had these maps and
22:04
the maps were um
22:06
they were made of sticks and made of um
22:08
rope and
22:09
the maps would be related to the waves
22:12
because waves change when they go past
22:13
islands
22:14
and so you would look at your map and
22:16
look at the waves and you'll be able to
22:18
tell
22:19
which way to go now the waves are not
22:22
very easy to see
22:23
if so you have to somehow detect the
22:24
waves and the best way that they found
22:26
to do it was to put the most sensitive
22:28
part of your body
22:29
into the sea which was your testicles so
22:32
they would dip their testicles into the
22:33
ocean and measure the waves
22:35
and then they would look at their map
22:37
and decide which way to go to get to the
22:38
next island the thing is
22:40
i just like the fact that i mean dipping
22:42
your testicles in the water and looking
22:43
at a map is a completely impractical way
22:47
they just thought well you know that's
22:49
the best way we have we're just gonna do
22:50
it
22:50
it's just as well that you'd have to do
22:51
it today isn't it excuse me sorry do you
22:53
know the way
22:54
to the swimming pool yeah hang on a
22:56
second
22:57
get my beaker
23:06
okay let's uh move on to our final fact
23:09
of the
23:09
show andy uh this is your one okay this
23:12
is
23:13
that nobody knows why we kiss
23:16
is that you and i on
23:20
especially not your wife or my
23:22
girlfriend
23:25
um no it's there are a couple of
23:26
theories as to why humans kiss each
23:28
other
23:29
uh as opposed to just for pleasure but
23:31
all because it feels good um
23:33
but it's it's not clear um with the
23:36
answer one way or the other basically
23:37
it's between whether
23:39
we instinctively do it or whether it's a
23:42
learned behavior well i remember reading
23:44
that actually
23:46
it's not historically that all cultures
23:48
kiss is it
23:49
so um that would imply that it's not not
23:52
instinctive to yeah to homo sapiens yeah
23:54
i think the the the theory is to it
23:56
being instinctual is that um
23:58
mothers would mash up food in their
24:00
mouth they would chew the food
24:01
themselves and they'd transfer it into
24:02
their infant's mouth yeah
24:04
and so all we're really trying to do
24:05
when we kiss each other is recreate the
24:07
nice feeling of one's mother
24:09
uh regurgitating food into your mouth so
24:12
we all love that certainly why i do it
24:15
i read that it was the kind of the
24:17
global spread of kissing
24:19
as a as a common thing was done by the
24:20
romans oh really yeah they were a
24:22
vibrant kids and culture apparently
24:24
and they maybe brought it in from india
24:26
have you read that bit no the but the
24:27
weird sentence i read is that um they
24:29
they did it via military conquest so it
24:32
was actually through war
24:33
that kissing people was much less killed
24:36
each other
24:37
now i read about one culture that
24:40
doesn't kiss you
24:41
and these are the people of mangaya
24:43
which is an island in the islands
24:45
and then they um it's written about them
24:47
that they don't kiss at all
24:49
but the way they make up for it is they
24:51
are one of the most sexually active
24:53
groups of people in the world and um i'm
24:56
going to quote this
24:57
at 28 years of age they average two
25:00
orgasms per night
25:02
five to six times a week the expectation
25:04
is that the male will strive to have his
25:06
partner have two or three orgasms to his
25:08
one
25:09
so basically they're the most orgasmic
25:11
people but they don't kiss
25:12
or they're the most compulsive liars in
25:14
the world
25:17
society of amazing braggers
25:20
orgasms last night my girlfriend had
25:23
three times as many
25:24
[Laughter]
25:27
nonsense um there is a thought that i
25:29
think cato the elder said this that um
25:31
yes the romans did like to kiss but
25:33
there's a theory that romans kissed
25:35
their wives to check whether or not
25:36
they've been drinking
25:37
and cato wrote that a husband was
25:38
considered to be acting within his legal
25:40
right if he killed his wife after
25:42
catching her drinking or with alcohol on
25:44
her breath
25:44
that's true did you guys read that it's
25:46
only this year the 2014
25:49
edition of the french dictionary that
25:50
french kissing is now a word
25:53
in france this is the word galaxy
25:56
la gallacher is an ice skating boot and
25:59
so the new term
26:00
is the idea of tongues slipping on ice
26:02
slipping on ice yeah like an ice skating
26:04
boot they're not as romantic as
26:06
we have given them credit for they did a
26:09
lot of slipping on ice last night
26:11
yeah i used the official word uh
26:13
cataglottism
26:14
yeah that's why you do so well
26:17
there's a book called the science of
26:18
kissing by cheryl kischenbaum which
26:21
i've really enjoyed i've read not all of
26:23
it but some of it the author says that
26:24
ninety percent of people can
26:26
remember their first kiss better than
26:28
the first time they had sex
26:29
is that to do with um drunkenness or i
26:32
don't
26:33
know usually
26:36
yeah do you guys know the first
26:40
video footage of a kiss it was actually
26:43
one of the first films ever shown to the
26:44
public
26:45
and it was a couple kissing and it was
26:47
from a scene which was in
26:48
a play called the widow jones and and
26:51
you can see the video
26:52
online it was filmed by the edison
26:53
company the quote they gave around it
26:55
was
26:55
they get ready to kiss begin to kiss and
26:57
kiss and kiss and kiss
26:59
in a way that brings down the house
27:00
every time that was the description yeah
27:02
and so we'll put that on qi.com
27:04
podcast you can see the very first
27:06
recorded video kiss
27:08
i think you're going to mention um the
27:10
first film to win best picture
27:12
um this was called wings i think going
27:14
off memory but andy's nodding so i think
27:16
he might be right but
27:17
there is a man on man kiss yes there is
27:20
it's to uh soldiers or aviators in the
27:23
festival yeah yeah
27:24
but we were saying about the widow jones
27:26
the first cinematic kiss i just wanted
27:28
to quickly
27:29
mention the review that it was given by
27:31
a painter called john sloan
27:33
this is also possibly the first film
27:35
review ever
27:36
this is in 1896 he said the kiss is
27:39
absolutely disgusting
27:42
neither participant is physically
27:43
attractive and the spectacle of their
27:44
prolonged
27:45
pasturing on each other's lips was hard
27:47
to bear
27:48
when only life-sized it was pronounced
27:50
beastly magnified to gargantuan
27:52
proportions
27:53
it is absolutely disgusting such things
27:56
call for police interference
27:59
that's amazing allegedly the first ever
28:01
film review police interference call the
28:03
police
28:03
shut it down he just got out of a
28:06
difficult relationship
28:07
yeah but if you watch the video as well
28:09
it's hilarious because they basically
28:11
spend half the clip with their mouth to
28:13
each other but they're just chatting to
28:14
each other yeah they're snuggled up
28:16
really close
28:16
but literally their mouth and mouth just
28:17
going oh yeah how you going
28:19
talking into each other's mouths almost
28:21
yeah obviously
28:22
um a lot of cultures have a different um
28:25
way of greeting kissing you know the
28:26
french will kiss on both cheeks it's
28:28
always a confusion you don't know how
28:29
many times you're kissing
28:30
for politicians it's a big problem
28:32
particularly when they're meeting
28:33
heads of states who particularly they
28:35
shouldn't be seen as having an intimate
28:38
moment with and i learned that bill
28:40
clinton
28:41
when he was introduced to yasser arafat
28:43
because yasser arafat's a big hugger
28:45
and there's a period where that he
28:47
couldn't just couldn't get a hug from
28:48
yasa arafat so he had to avoid it
28:50
and the way that he avoided it was that
28:52
his aides taught him jiu-jitsu
28:54
so he could call specific moves on
28:56
arafat whenever he went in for a hug
28:58
threw him over his shoulder yeah if you
29:00
watch some of the footage you'll notice
29:02
that arafat suddenly gets flipped to the
29:04
ground
29:05
no but so clinton was actively taught
29:07
jiu jitsu in order to avoid the arafat
29:09
hug
29:10
arafat finally got a hug on him though
29:12
at one point there's a photo that you
29:13
can see
29:14
yeah yeah bill clinton tries to avoid
29:16
physical contact
29:20
monica lewinsky said that he initially
29:22
kissed her the first time
29:24
he kissed her it was to shut her up
29:25
about something because she was
29:26
rabbiting on
29:27
her words i think she said that she's
29:29
putting a more
29:30
charitable interpretation on it than
29:33
yeah might deserve
29:34
maybe she accidentally walked into the
29:36
oval office and she said sorry i got
29:37
lost i was looking for the staff room do
29:39
you know where it is
29:40

a weekly podcast coming to you from the
00:28
qi offices in covent garden
00:30
once again we've gathered around a
00:31
microphone to discuss our favorite facts
00:34
from the last seven days
00:35
my name is andy murray and i'm joined by
00:37
three other qi elves
00:39

00:43
anna chazinski we also have a special
00:46
guest with us today whose name is mark
00:48
abrahams
00:49
and for those of you who don't know him
00:51
mark is the founder of the ig nobel
00:53
prizes which is a series of awards
00:55
given out every year for pieces of
00:57
research that first make you laugh
00:59
and then make you think so as an example
01:02
this year's
01:02
probability price went to a team of
01:04
scientists for making two related
01:06
discoveries
01:07
first that the longer a cow has been
01:09
lying down the more likely that cow will
01:11
soon stand up
01:13
and second that once a cow stands up you
01:16
cannot easily predict
01:17
how soon that cow will lie down again
01:20
hello mark hello thank you for inviting
01:22

and denmark and sweden oh my goodness
01:37
okay so listeners in denmark and sweden
01:38
look out for that so
01:40
let's kick off with fact number one
01:42
which is from you mark
01:44
fact number one is that a number of
01:47
years ago
01:48
some plastic surgeons in belgium they
01:51
had a young belgian man who came to them
01:54
wanting to have surgery performed to
01:56
make him look more like his idol the
01:58
singer michael jackson
02:00
this is a technique first used on
02:02
michael jackson himself
02:03
exactly there are lots interesting quite
02:06
medically it's very interesting it's a
02:07
difficult piece of surgery and in this
02:10
medical report the surgeons proudly
02:13
describe exactly how they did it
02:15
and say that they succeeded wow when was
02:18
this
02:18
this was about do they 1997.
02:21
to do special light thing where their
02:23
skin got whiter and whiter and whiter as
02:24
well like michael jackson that's
02:26
well these were plastic surgeons and
02:28
when they write
02:29
a report in a medical journal they talk
02:31
about just one
02:32
specific thing they were doing wouldn't
02:34
it be terrible to get the surgery done
02:36
and then discover that you can't dance
02:38
or sing
02:39
anywhere near as well as michael jackson
02:41
could because nobody could
02:43
that would and that's where robotics
02:45
could enter the pic
02:46
and me walking i mean you must be able
02:48
to perfect moonwalking if you practice
02:49
it for long enough don't you think
02:51
yeah but moonwalking was not the only
02:52
dance move that jackson did
02:54
one of his main ones come on it was
02:56
amazing
02:57
he was an amazing dancer we did it on qi
02:59
that it wasn't invented by michael
03:00
jackson yeah
03:01
it's invented by bill bailey right yeah
03:03
it was an old old um
03:04
guy called bill bailey not our bill
03:06
bailey the other one and um also by the
03:08
mannequin bird you remember that video
03:10
though
03:10
red cat mannequin yeah it's brilliant
03:12
this brilliant bird that has a mating
03:14
ritual it kind of
03:15
climbs up a branch and then it slides
03:17
back down like michael jackson
03:19
we always see on qi when we're doing our
03:21
research dolly parton or charlie chaplin
03:24
came
03:24
third in a chava chaplain or a dolly
03:26
parson lookalike competition
03:28
i don't know if any of those is true
03:29
have you ever found any evidence that is
03:31
true
03:31
well chaplin was so famous in his time
03:34
that if you were going to have a
03:35
lookalike competition for anyone it
03:36
probably would be him yeah but him
03:37
coming third
03:38
did i make this happen to hitler loser
03:40
look-alike competition
03:41
you're thinking of charlie chaplin
03:44
hitler came third in a charlie chaplin
03:46
competition i do have a true example
03:48
graeme greene the author once
03:50
entered a competition of writing like
03:53
graham green
03:54
and came second which is fantastic i
03:56
think it was in the new statesman
03:57
but speaking of um like uh hitler and
04:00
whoever is it true all the
04:01
stuff about dictators getting lookalikes
04:03
for themselves um
04:05
dictators look alikes i don't know much
04:06
about them well i know one thing is that
04:08
um there was a guy who looked just like
04:09
saddam hussein
04:10
and he got um kidnapped or attempted a
04:13
kidnap from
04:14
some guys in egypt because they wanted
04:16
to make a porn movie um of him
04:18
no yeah he got away but that was his
04:21
claim because he didn't want to be in a
04:23
porn movie or
04:24
some people have no ambition do they
04:26
what's
04:31
he has made everyone in korea have the
04:32
same haircut as him and
04:34
uh there was a story about how wonder if
04:36
one direction wanted to perform in korea
04:38
they were gonna have to have their hair
04:39
cut like him did you see that on the
04:40
news
04:41
i don't know the other day one direction
04:43
wanted to perform in north korea yeah
04:45
now i don't know
04:46
about the touring circuits and stadiums
04:48
of north korea but i think that's
04:49
true they're not likely to go i can tell
04:51
you that i'm pretty sure about this i
04:53
think north korea has the world's
04:54
largest sports stadium i'm sure it has
04:56
it's got the world's largest everything
04:57
and nothing else the uh the one
04:59
direction thing wasn't april fools
05:02
loads of reports are coming out saying
05:03
that he's forcing all men at university
05:05
in north korea to have his haircut
05:07
kim jong-un but i seems they're all
05:09
coming from south korean media network i
05:11
would suspect it's not true
05:12
but apparently so it used to be that men
05:14
were enough to choose from 10 different
05:16
prescribed haircuts but now men have to
05:18
pick these apparently so
05:19
let's go back to something exactly it's
05:22
a surgery yeah i remember
05:24
i found this thing um last year and i
05:25
passed it on to you mark which was the
05:27
gynecomastia in the german ministry of
05:30
defense and german soldiers
05:31
have been marching hitting themselves on
05:34
the chest with their guns
05:35
to such an extent that their breasts
05:37
have been growing and they've had to
05:38
have reduction surgery
05:39
that's amazing it's a paper by bjorn
05:41
derg krappel
05:43
and um within six years a total of 211
05:46
patients underwent
05:47
surgery in um germany wow
05:52
just banging their gun against the chest
05:54
yeah it forces the the um
05:56
tissue to grow oh wow yeah it didn't
05:58
happen to everybody but it happened
05:59
quite a few
06:00
right talking of boob jobs there's a
06:02
real life uh bobby and ken
06:04
oh really and ken has had over a hundred
06:07
surgeries to look more like ken
06:08
whereas barbie's only had a boob job um
06:10
and she does the rest of
06:11
lighting and really good makeup and
06:13
apparently when they met they had a big
06:14
fight
06:15
pen got angry with baked barbie because
06:17
he said i've spent a fortune and i had a
06:19
hundred surgeries and all you've done is
06:20
one
06:21
lame boob job totally plastic plastic
06:23
surgery
06:24
i did try to get in touch a few years
06:26
ago with these surgeons
06:28
dr mohmert's dr abelus and dr gropp
06:31
i thought that they would be happy to
06:32
talk with somebody
06:34
even the kind of journalist i am who was
06:37
interested but not necessarily adoring
06:39
they were no longer eager to discuss
06:40
this
06:42
they must be made fun of a little bit i
06:43
guess by some other people fortunately
06:45
even if they're not popular anymore they
06:47
have a surefire way of disguising
06:48
themselves in public
06:53
[Applause]
06:54
okay let's move on to fact number two
06:58
which comes from molly so last week a
07:01
few of us went on an elf
07:02
expedition to the british museum and we
07:05
uh went to the viking exhibition so i
07:07
thought i'd talk a little bit about
07:08
biking the largest viking ship
07:10
ever found was discovered when they
07:12
renovated the viking ship museum
07:13
brilliant actually underneath it or
07:16
they were basically extending the museum
07:18
and they dug down into the fjords
07:20
literally outside the museum and there
07:22
they found the the longest viking ship
07:24
ever found
07:25
and a whole bunch of other ships too
07:26
that's so convenient isn't it
07:28
yeah and underneath that evening they
07:31
found another museum
07:32
which was upside down and it was a
07:34
mirror but never mind do you remember
07:35
that guy who got um buried upside down
07:37
atop his horse they buried him upside
07:39
down he was sat on his horse upside down
07:41
and the reason he did it is because he
07:42
believed
07:43
when the world ended everyone would get
07:45
sucked up to um heaven so if he was
07:47
upside down he could be the right way
07:48
around
07:48
brilliant have you found it anna yes it
07:50
was in surrey i think
07:52
a few miles away a horse is buried
07:54
upside down too and the national trust
07:56
says
07:56
you might think this is major peter la
07:58
billier's horse as in the guy
08:00
who is very upset but it's actually just
08:01
a big coincidence oh that is a
08:03
staggering question it is
08:04
odd isn't it yes but if you want to see
08:06
it you can go to box hill and check out
08:08
the grave he was buried in 1800 his
08:10
gravestone says
08:10
major peter labellier age 75 eccentric
08:14
resident of dawking
08:15
sort of implies he knew what he was
08:17
doing it's a good epitaph to have yeah
08:19
um
08:20
vikings we should we should get back to
08:21
vikings yeah they had these things
08:23
called hogback stones in the exhibition
08:25
which were
08:26
huge uh stones they're they're curved
08:28
and they are covered with viking
08:29
inscriptions
08:30
and they think what happened was the
08:32
vikings saw people here like christians
08:34
burying their dead and putting
08:35
gravestones and so they copied them with
08:37
their hogback stones and kind of made
08:38
them scandi style with viking
08:40
things all over them decoration all over
08:42
them what was that thing about viking
08:44
coins and what inscriptions they had on
08:45
them yeah the most common written
08:46
inscription appearing anywhere in viking
08:48
scandinavia was
08:49
what do you think well something about
08:51
hrothgar angry face
08:53
and his sword or something like that
08:57
um it was actually there is no god but
08:59
allah alone he has no partner
09:01
no way no how pretty weird huh because
09:04
at the beginning of the viking age the
09:06
islamic world stretched far and wide
09:07
from spain to central asia
09:09
and they used a single coinage
09:10
throughout the empire and the vikings
09:12
obviously bought these coins back with
09:14
them when they went off on their travels
09:15
they found some of these coins because
09:17
they've scrub scrubbed out the
09:18
inscription and put
09:19
thor's hammer across the top wow they
09:22
were probably protesting outside the
09:24
viking embassy all over the middle east
09:27
and there was also some really good
09:29
viking graffiti which was like pretty
09:30
basic they tended to uh
09:32
graffiti ships all over stuff viking
09:35
graffiti
09:36
sounds like it would almost all be good
09:38
they're like the teenagers of european
09:39
history
09:40
aren't they they are yeah and oh also
09:42
these skulls which had
09:44
they they filed down their teeth oh yeah
09:46
they're more fearsome
09:47
these particular vikings just maybe were
09:50
the equivalent then of this
09:52
young belgian man who wanted to have
09:54
surgery to make him look like michael
09:55
jackson i just want to look like odin
09:57
guys
09:58
lots of people having one eye removed so
10:00
they'd look like odin emcee those hammer
10:02
oh i really like the thing though about
10:05
finding something in a really convenient
10:08
place that's such a great story about
10:10
the ship underneath the ship museum yeah
10:12
and i like this thing about um
10:13
how they found the new species of bug in
10:16
the natural history museum's garden
10:18
oh yeah that was brilliant yeah it was
10:19
amazing and they they found this um bug
10:22
in the garden they picked it up they
10:23
thought oh i've never seen that before
10:25
they checked against the 28 million
10:28
specimens they have in the natural
10:30
history museum and it didn't fit any of
10:31
them
10:32
that's fantastic how long does it take
10:34
to check against 28 million
10:36
god that poor work experience boy you
10:38
thought i'm gonna have a nice easy week
10:39
at the natural history museum so frank
10:40
could you just um
10:42
yeah there was a woman who did the same
10:44
thing in britain somewhere checked in
10:46
her garden and she found something like
10:47
27 species of wasps
10:49
[Music]
10:51
yeah yeah they're the ones who
10:52
parasitize eggs don't they
10:54
yeah i have a fun fact about them which
10:56
is that when alfred
10:57
kinsey the great sex researcher no it
11:00
wasn't ignorant it was a it was goal
11:01
boss he was an expert on but he
11:03
traveled the length and breadth of the
11:04
usa finding these
11:06
categorizing them because he was a
11:08
maniac collector he wanted to have the
11:09
biggest collection of everything in the
11:10
world
11:11
parcel them up label them and then send
11:12
them back to the university
11:15
and a lot of them hatched on the way and
11:17
so the people were constantly opening
11:19
packages of live
11:20
crawling wasps you know love alfred i
11:22
love that about alfred kinsey that um he
11:24
got into
11:25
sexology a bit later on in his career
11:27
and his wife said i don't see much of
11:28
alfred since he got interested in sex
11:32
what about the other thing that they
11:34
found in york which was the coprolite
11:36
the viking poo
11:37
do you remember that one oh we did that
11:39
did they find that under a viking
11:41
museum the viking museum
11:44
no it was in the loud bank when they
11:46
were excavating wow the sellers there
11:48
was
11:48
maybe that had been uh deposited with
11:51
the bank for safekeeping
11:54
quite yeah i don't think they'll let you
11:55
deposit things like that in the bank
11:57
the discoverer of the poo andrew bones
11:59
jones commented
12:01
this is the most exciting piece of
12:03
excrement i've ever seen
12:04
in its own way it's as valuable as a
12:06
crown jewels
12:07
andrew burns turns that man with no
12:09
sense of priority whatsoever
12:12
um i was looking up viking names and i
12:15
found
12:16
because they have the buy names you know
12:17
that like harold bluetooth well
12:19
bluetooth is where we get the bluetooth
12:20
from mobile phones from isn't it we get
12:22
it
12:22
it's named after him i think right
12:24
bluetooth yeah seriously no
12:26
i believe going completely off memory
12:28
here but it might have been that it was
12:29
nokia who did it and they
12:31
needed company yeah nokia used to make
12:33
gas masks
12:35
in fact they supplied them to the
12:36
finnish army until about 1995. i was at
12:38
a comedy show the other night and um
12:40
um the host was asking so where do you
12:42
work and he did the guy said oh i work
12:44
at
12:45
nestle and then he said okay but which
12:46
which bit you're working he said i work
12:48
in the cat food division of
12:51
nobody nestle the audience knew that if
12:52
they had a cat food vision yeah he
12:53
obviously didn't say the cat food bit of
12:55
the start because he wants them to think
12:56
he works in a chocolate company yeah
12:58
he says that so they all think he's
12:59
willy wonka and then when they go a bit
13:01
further it's like oh
13:02
captured willy wonka not so good yeah
13:06
there's a there's a kind of thing about
13:08
pet food
13:09
most of the work over the years for the
13:12
companies that sell a lot of dog food
13:13
most of the research work was to come up
13:15
with a dog food that would produce
13:16
reliable
13:17
output from the dog because that's what
13:19
matters reliable output
13:20
people believe solids are nicer than
13:23
liquids oh yeah
13:24
there was a well there was a dog poo
13:26
lottery in taiwan where to get a ticket
13:28
for the lottery
13:29
you had to turn up with a bag of dog poo
13:31
about 2 000 people turned up it was a
13:33
runaway success
13:34
and city was clean in a day and then
13:36
someone won i don't know what the price
13:37
was maybe about a thousand pounds but a
13:39
thousand bags of dog food
13:41
lovely maybe a dog i really like that
13:43
taiwanese city officials eventually had
13:45
to say
13:46
like release a statement saying the city
13:48
simply cannot afford to keep exchanging
13:50
dog poo for gold
13:51
[Laughter]
13:52
seems like strong economic reasoning
13:55
though yeah absolutely well andrew bones
13:57
jones would disagree of course he'd
13:58
exchange the launch bank copyright for
13:59
the crown jewels but
14:03
[Applause]
14:06
so the next fact is from me and it is
14:08
this one the tobacco hornworm
14:10
uses extremely bad halitosis to prevent
14:13
predators
14:13
from eating it i love the tobacco
14:18
so i found this in the smithsonian
14:20
magazine because i was
14:21
trying to i was doing uh lungs research
14:23
for the l-series and i sort of got
14:24
distracted and started reading about
14:26
breath
14:26
and bad breath and this is an animal
14:29
which has such bad breath that other
14:31
predators think it's actively poisonous
14:33
they have actually filmed a
14:35
tobacco hornworm and one of these
14:37
spiders coming towards it
14:38
somehow researchers disabled this gene
14:41
so that it couldn't give off the tobacco
14:42
smell and the spider just came towards
14:44
it and went to eat it
14:46
but i like the thing about animals using
14:48
different ways for um
14:49
defense like the hagfish remember that
14:51
guy that we did they create an
14:52
inordinate amount of slime
14:54
and that's supposed to be a way of
14:56
getting rid of predators if you pick up
14:58
a hagfish it will slide all over you and
15:00
then it basically falls out of your
15:01
hands and it's disgusting
15:02
the worst thing about it is that there
15:04
is a danger that the hagfish will
15:05
suffocate in its own slide
15:07
oh wow the texas horned lizard shoots
15:10
blood out of its eyes to get rid of
15:12
predators
15:13
and there's a crazy video which we can
15:14
post it can squirt blood
15:16
five feet and the blood has got a final
15:18
tasting chemical in it as well so
15:20
yeah another thing texans are proud of
15:21
yeah
15:23
and it can release a third of its blood
15:24
supply doing this so it's kind of quite
15:26
an exhausting thing for it to do so it
15:27
only does it
15:28
actually it's blood yeah out of its eyes
15:31
blood
15:32
for one animal is almost always food for
15:34
some other animals so maybe it's
15:35
it's a food source it's distracting
15:37
everything oh it could well be
15:39
the predator just go straight for the
15:40
blood yeah turkey vultures do the same
15:42
thing which is where they
15:44
if they're very full after a meal and
15:45
they're approached by a predator
15:47
they throw up on the ground saying okay
15:49
well rather than eating meat you can
15:50
just have everything i've just eaten
15:52
and the the bird flies away there's a
15:54
bird called the eurasian roller
15:55
the chicks vomit over themselves to
15:57
scare people away i do that
15:59
if you're on the train and you need the
16:01
seats next to you to be clear
16:03
yourself or you could do what the potato
16:05
veto does and cover yourself in your own
16:07
experiments wow that's amazing
16:08
wow yeah um mark do you know this um do
16:11
you know this paper um
16:13
called um farting as a defense against
16:16
unspeakable dread
16:17
i do i thought you know the author was
16:20
given an egg nobel prize oh
16:22
for that her name is mara sidoli
16:25
i never met her but we corresponded oh
16:27
she was italian she lived in washington
16:28
dc
16:29
she was really pleased to be getting
16:32
recognition for this paper this was
16:34
a case report about a very small boy
16:37
maybe
16:37
four years old whenever this boy became
16:39
very distressed
16:40
he would begin farting she was a good
16:43
writer mara sadole was dr sidoli and she
16:45
describes
16:46
exactly what this little kid was doing
16:48
and the effect on the room
16:50
and how she spent weeks and months
16:52
talking with him and trying to calm him
16:54
down so he no longer did this
16:56
and she was successful is it to drive
16:58
people away
17:00
that's what she felt it says it he
17:02
enveloped himself in a protective cloud
17:04
of familiarity
17:05
against familiarity before
17:09
sorry darling there's a bit of
17:09
familiarity in the room
17:11
[Laughter]
17:12
the details of it read in passages like
17:15
a battle a very personal battle between
17:18
she the older woman psychiatrist and he
17:21
the child where
17:22
she would say something and then he
17:24
would respond with a cloud of fart but
17:26
eventually
17:26
eventually they came to an understanding
17:29
she was like i'll leave and you can just
17:31
get on with it
17:32
um mark do you find that those are the
17:34
most interesting papers to you
17:36
personally
17:37
i have many favorites what makes
17:39
something
17:40
pleasing to me is something that i never
17:43
expected that's that's
17:44
really the quality one of the ones which
17:46
really sticks in my head is
17:48
exiting a building an informal look
17:50
right
17:51
which is about whether people given the
17:53
choice of an open door and a closed one
17:55
how many of them gravitate towards the
17:58
open door how many
17:59
stubbornly stay on their path and open
18:01
the closed door instead i just thought
18:03
it was a must i went to the doorway of a
18:05
large building in new york city and he
18:06
stayed there for hours
18:08
simply taking notes i believe it was a
18:10
couple years later he
18:11
repeated the experiment to see what had
18:13
changed
18:14
he tended to do this he got obsessions
18:16
he he would write reports to amuse
18:18
himself he wasn't
18:19
trying to to convince anybody that these
18:21
things were important he did this
18:23
really to relieve his frustrations if
18:26
something annoyed him he saw something
18:29
in his daily life that annoyed him that
18:31
kept happening
18:31
at some point he would decide to be
18:34
amused by it and he would go
18:36
with a piece of paper and a pen and sit
18:38
there for several hours
18:40
and count simply count how many people
18:42
do this annoying thing and how many
18:43
don't i had a few hours free
18:45
in ueno station in tokyo at the end of
18:48
last year and i decided to count how
18:49
many people were wearing
18:50
medical masks oh yeah because in japan
18:53
if you have a cold or a cough
18:54
it's considered polite to wear one of
18:56
the masks um especially if you're a hag
18:58
fish
19:00
and the answer was really annoying
19:02
because it was a perfectly neat number
19:04
so there was it was 110 people out of
19:06
1100 people
19:08
you counted 100 people wow that was very
19:11
both
19:11
i had about an hour and a half and i
19:13
just decided everyone who passes a
19:14
particular point
19:15
professor trinkus is now in his 80s he's
19:17
slowing down he's publishing at a
19:20
far slower rate well if he wants a
19:22
success
19:24
[Laughter]
19:30
okay let's go back to um to bad breath i
19:32
found this is quite weird the welsh law
19:35
um in medieval law is quite unusual in
19:38
the
19:38
um it was not too difficult for wives to
19:41
divorce their husbands usually that's
19:42
quite a difficult thing in most laws
19:44
um usually if you got divorced as a
19:47
woman you would um struggle to get your
19:49
fair share of
19:50
whatever was in the marriage the money
19:52
and the property and whatever
19:53
but there are a few different reasons
19:54
that you could get money that you um
19:56
that you were owed
19:57
neglect leprosy or bad breath
20:01
if it's a family where the wife prepares
20:03
the food she just good
20:06
husband's food do they have garlic in
20:08
those days in wales because you found
20:09
out that thing
20:10
didn't you understand yes i'm in the
20:12
process of trying to find out exactly
20:14
when garlic and leeks got to wales this
20:15
is
20:16
a little bit of controversy in the qi
20:18
offices okay i'll get it
20:20
we've covered have we covered bad breath
20:22
on the show we did about how it was
20:24
mostly uh invented by listerine because
20:26
listerine was originally
20:28
sold as a surgical antiseptic uh and
20:31
then
20:31
it was just changed to be marketed as a
20:33
mouthwash i think it wasn't it might
20:35
have been used to clean floors but
20:36
in the risk of a lawsuit i'm going to
20:38
say maybe that one
20:40
um anna do you have something for us
20:42
listerine was definitely sold as floor
20:44
cleaner
20:45
before the 1920s when it realized it was
20:46
a mouthwash i think you can say that
20:48
universities have released publications
20:50
that say that it was also sold as a cure
20:51
for gonorrhea
20:52
or chapped lips um neither of these
20:54
things was none of these things were
20:55
very successful
20:57
a floor cleaner thing would maybe tie in
21:00
with the five
21:00
second rule the idea that if you drop
21:02
food on the floor
21:04
and it's there for less than five
21:06
seconds it's safe to eat there was a
21:08
paper that just came out
21:09
and and it confirmed what an american
21:11
high school girl had done
21:12
a decade earlier that we gave an
21:14
ignorant promise if it depends on the
21:16
floor and the food if the floor is clean
21:18
and it's
21:19
not sticky probably no problem if it's
21:21
sticky food and the floor hasn't been
21:23
cleaned for a while if there's been
21:25
compromise on it so that you know yeah
21:27
no listerine around
21:28
yeah and it's custard yeah you're not
21:31
going to want to find it
21:32
[Music]
21:34
[Applause]
21:38
let's move to fact number four now which
21:40
this week comes from
21:41
james okay my fact is you could have
21:44
fallen asleep
21:45
up to five times during this podcast and
21:48
not known about it
21:49
um how could that be okay i've been
21:52
reading a book this week by richard
21:53
wiseman
21:54
it's just come out it's called night
21:55
school i'm currently 30
21:57
of the way through according to my
21:59
kindle app and
22:01
he was talking about these things called
22:02
micro sleeps
22:04
and these are temporary episodes of
22:05
sleep which may last for a fraction of a
22:07
second or up to 30 seconds
22:09
where you would fail to respond to some
22:11
arbitrary sensory input
22:13
and it's like being asleep for a very
22:14
short amount of time and he talks about
22:16
this experiment
22:17
um it was a reporter called ron
22:18
claiborne from abc who
22:20
stayed awake for 32 hours um they
22:23
connected him to a device that measured
22:25
his brain activity and set him driving
22:27
on a track for two hours
22:28
and when they looked at his brain
22:30
activity according to their study
22:32
they found that he'd taken more than 20
22:34
micro sleeps during his drive
22:35
wow yeah does this go on all day long
22:38
even at normal times or is it only
22:40
during
22:40
times of uh great sleep deprivation yeah
22:44
it happens mostly with sleep deprivation
22:46
there was a program on channel 4
22:47
called i think it was called shattered
22:49
several years ago and it was a reality
22:51
show where the premise was
22:52
you have to stay awake for 10 days
22:55
and you could be evicted for having a
22:59
micro sleep but i think the the limit
23:02
they put on
23:02
there was 10 seconds of being asleep did
23:05
they monitor their brains
23:07
the science of this is really like it's
23:09
difficult to work out isn't it mark
23:10
there's lots of science there are lots
23:12
of branches of science lots of fields
23:14
and some of them
23:15
are much iffier than others simply
23:17
because it's really difficult
23:19
to measure this stuff reliably try to
23:22
figure out your own sleep anything about
23:24
your own patterns of sleep it's very
23:26
very difficult if you're going to
23:27
measure something
23:28
and what exactly do you measure yeah you
23:30
can talk about it and it sounds great
23:32
but when you actually have to sit down
23:33
and do it what exactly are you measuring
23:34
even
23:35
these micro things everything about
23:36
sleep is like so there are a bunch of
23:38
sleep researchers around the world and
23:40
they work very hard but
23:41
it's hard for them to be sure that
23:44
almost anything that they're telling
23:46
people
23:46
really is reliably the story of sleep
23:49
it's at this point it's all good stories
23:50
with a little bit of data but when you
23:52
get down to something like
23:54
uh claiming that well people dream 30
23:57
of the night how do you really know i
23:59
think people can dream outside rem sleep
24:01
which is was thought previously to be
24:03
the benchmark for when you were dreaming
24:05
yeah and so
24:06
you don't know that yeah i mean it's all
24:08
this stuff is real it's just very very
24:09
the people who do it are trying to
24:11
measure things that are really difficult
24:12
to measure so they're trying to do
24:13
something really you know commendable
24:15
yeah just going back to your thing about
24:17
shattered yeah and there was a guy
24:19
um in america called he was a dj called
24:21
tripp i can't remember his first name
24:23
and in 1959 he um tried to stay awake
24:26
for um eight days i think it was and do
24:29
his radio show
24:30
and see how it would affect him and um
24:32
after about four or five days
24:34
he started seeing mice running around
24:36
the studio which weren't there
24:38
he would see uh spiders coming out of
24:40
his shoes and he thought his desk was on
24:42
fire
24:43
wow and when a doctor came to um look
24:45
after him he thought he was an
24:46
undertaker
24:47
yeah coming to take him away and bury
24:48
him upside down
24:52
but there was another guy there was a
24:53
student called randy gardner and this
24:55
was a few years later from 1964
24:57
he tried to set a new world record for
24:59
staying awake
25:01
um and he did it for a few days few days
25:03
a few days
25:04
and by the end he was also hallucinating
25:06
he thought he was a black american
25:08
football player he was white but he
25:10
thought he was a black american football
25:11
player
25:12
and when his friends started saying no
25:13
you're not a black american football
25:15
player he started calling them racist
25:19
that's amazing the british department of
25:21
transport says that 20
25:23
of accidents on motorways are
25:27
three sleep-related island chernobyl all
25:29
of them had people who were quite sleep
25:31
deprived at the controls
25:32
i suspect that's not a coincidence yeah
25:35
i have a fact to drag it completely down
25:38
market
25:39
impotence can be measured by um it's
25:42
quite tricky because sometimes it's
25:43
psychological and sometimes it's
25:44
physical
25:45
so um one method of testing is to test
25:47
whether people get erections as they
25:48
sleep
25:49
and in the 20th century one method of
25:51
testing this was to seal a perforated
25:54
strip of postage stamps around
25:56
the penis at the base and see if this
25:58
time to tour during the night
26:01
that's a good idea it's a brilliant idea
26:03
it's low-cost
26:04
science if you're turned on by the
26:06
queen's face
26:10
this is a weird thing according to this
26:12
is a paper called dreaming dreaming and
26:14
sexuality it's quite an old one 1966 by
26:16
a guy called fisher
26:17
or a woman called fisher i'm not sure um
26:20
they found that erections happen
26:21
um when you're dreaming even in the most
26:23
mundane of dreams it doesn't have to be
26:25
a sexual dream for you to get an
26:27
erection
26:27
just dreaming about your mom doing the
26:29
washing album or the queen
26:31
i don't know but um yeah i mean again
26:33
i'm not sure what their methodology was
26:34
but that's that was their findings
26:36
amazing um mark you really like i i know
26:39
you like uh patents don't you
26:41
i do um i found this not each and every
26:43
one no no but
26:44
the amazing ones i found them a patent
26:47
for inducing sleep from 1885 this was by
26:50
fanny paul it was pretty simple it
26:52
basically it was a piece of wood or
26:54
leather put it around your neck it would
26:56
stop the blood flow to the brain and it
26:57
would make you sleep
26:58
and um it said it thereby reduces the
27:00
activity of the brain in order that
27:02
sleep may ensue
27:04
oh god and you would just tighten it and
27:05
tighten it until you fell asleep
27:07
oh i'd love to see details in there
27:08
james yeah i'll send it on anna do you
27:10
have anything on sleep for us
27:11
uh not a whole lot from that section i
27:13
feel like you guys covered it all
27:15
i can tell you that um in that program
27:17
shattered that i also remember and seems
27:19
like it wouldn't be allowed to
27:20
be put on now um they all had various
27:22
amusing hallucinations one of the
27:23
runners up believed he was prime
27:24
minister of australia
27:26
the winner thought she was in a tube
27:27
station the whole time but two of them
27:29
became convinced that their clothes have
27:30
been stolen which i think is kind of
27:31
interesting that two people have the
27:33
same delusional hallucination
27:36

which was there's no such thing as a
00:04
fish there's no such thing as a fish no
00:06
seriously it's in the oxford dictionary
00:08
of underwater life it says it right
00:10
there first paragraph no such thing as a
00:12
fish
00:14
[Music]
00:18
hello and welcome to no such thing as a
00:20
fish this is a qi elf podcast coming to
00:23
you from our offices in covent garden my
00:25
name is dan schreiber i am sitting here
00:27
with three other qils james harkin anna
00:30
jaczynski and andy murray and once again
00:32
we're huddled around our microphone and
00:34
these are the best facts that we found
00:36
out from the last seven days so in no
00:38
particular order here we go
00:40
okay fact number one we're gonna start
00:42
with you james okay yeah my fact this
00:45
week is a computer game has been
00:48
invented that takes more than a lifetime
00:50
to complete does it digitize monopoly
00:54
oh yeah because remember that thing we
00:55
found there was a computer simulation of
00:58
monopoly and they found that something
01:00
like 12 percent of all games will go on
01:02
indefinitely yeah which is not true
01:04
because it's much more than that
01:06
what do you mean so with monopoly how
01:08
would it go on everyone would own a
01:10
certain portion of the body yeah just
01:11
keep going terry pratchett has a
01:13
computer game in his book which is
01:15
called journey to alpha centauri which
01:17
takes over three thousand years to play
01:20
and oh wow it's just you know the screen
01:22
saver the very old-fashioned screensaver
01:23
with just the moving dots for a
01:25
spaceship it's that with a counter
01:27
counting down for 3000 years and at the
01:28
end the dot appears in the middle of the
01:30
screen it says welcome to alpha centauri
01:32
now go home and someone has actually
01:34
made uh that this is a very rough game
01:37
we're going to find out about this yeah
01:39
okay um this um this came from the
01:42
design museum i went there this weekend
01:44
it's the design of the year 2014 um it's
01:47
competition for all the best design
01:49
things and this was the thing that i
01:50
thought was most interesting um but the
01:52
idea is it's kind of an art installation
01:55
and they're asking questions like what
01:57
happens to digital things after you die
01:59
if you die halfway through that game can
02:01
you pass it on to another person to
02:02
finish off the game is that possible
02:04
or maybe this game is designed for
02:07
mobile phones what happens when mobile
02:08
phones are obsolete will the game carry
02:10
on um so they're asking those kind of
02:12
questions wouldn't it be dispiriting to
02:14
you know to find out that your great
02:16
uncle had bequeathed you his high score
02:19
so far in this game that you just had to
02:21
keep on playing it for the rest of your
02:23
lifetime as well
02:25
uh to my first son i leave all the
02:27
property and my second son i leave this
02:30
game
02:31
hey do you guys know um how many hours
02:33
of games are played per week on earth by
02:36
humans if you tallied up over hours i'll
02:38
say 100 million 100 million hours yeah i
02:41
would say i'm gonna go for two billion
02:43
okay i'm gonna go for just 24 hours
02:46
that's been 24 hours 24 hours yeah and i
02:48
think most of humanity's out on a walk
02:50
okay
02:51
the answer is three billion hours oh yes
02:54
i say i'm close but actually i'm a
02:56
billionaire yeah that feels close so
02:59
gamers are supposed to be good at using
03:01
uh drones aren't they for war yeah and
03:04
also um surges
03:06
yeah if they play computer games it's
03:07
supposed to help them with keyhole
03:09
surgery and stuff like this there's a
03:10
lot of job opportunities coming up for
03:12
gamers now which didn't exist before um
03:14
when robert ballard discovered the wreck
03:16
of the titanic probably in your head you
03:18
have an image that he was in a
03:19
submersible trawling through the ocean
03:21
but he was in a submarine but they would
03:23
send down drone submarines as it were
03:25
and obviously you need someone to
03:26
operate them this this is a quote from
03:28
he said i would not let an adult drive
03:30
my robot they don't have enough gaming
03:32
experience wow so with this game did you
03:34
actually play it or i i prodded at the
03:37
screen a few times but i couldn't really
03:39
work out how to play it oh okay maybe
03:41
that's why it takes lifetimes the first
03:42
lifetime what the hell is this thing
03:46
just some of the other things that this
03:47
design of the year they had the first
03:49
car that's been able to drive 100
03:52
kilometers on one liter of petrol it
03:55
looks really cool it's a bit like a
03:56
james bond car it's very sleek and in
03:58
order to
04:00
help their
04:01
aerodynamics they don't have wing
04:03
mirrors and instead they have tiny
04:04
cameras
04:05
and they have talking lamp posts is that
04:07
useful they were popular stop that stop
04:10
that bad dog
04:14
they were
04:14
in bristol last year or the year before
04:16
i think and the idea is that say you had
04:18
a rubbish bin and it was full then you
04:20
would be able to talk to your rubbish
04:22
bin and say you you're a bit full and
04:24
you go oh sorry i'll make sure i sort
04:25
that out and then it would get emptied
04:27
so it's a way of the community kind of
04:29
dealing with stuff like that yes it's a
04:31
really interesting thing isn't it um
04:33
there's this guy have you guys heard of
04:34
dmitry itzkov no um so he set up this
04:37
thing called the 2045 initiative
04:39
basically it's a russian mogul who um
04:42
thinks that he wants to remove our minds
04:44
from our bodies essentially so our
04:45
mind's gonna live forever well that's
04:46
never gone wrong in any films
04:49
i think it seems very promising um so by
04:52
2045 he really thinks that we'll have
04:53
our minds to a couple from our bodies
04:54
and he's going to live forever and he's
04:56
100 certain of this and we'll have
04:57
holograms and we'll be able to like shop
04:59
in department stores for the body that
05:01
we want that most suits our purposes um
05:04
and live for eternity and he met the
05:06
dalai lama to discuss it who apparently
05:08
was really supportive according to their
05:09
website the thing is at the moment the
05:11
computer capability isn't enough to
05:13
simulate a human brain is it yeah 2045
05:16
seems um ambitious so i have something
05:19
about things that run for longer than
05:20
you'd expect okay because off the back
05:23
of the computer game
05:25
one of norway's most popular recent tv
05:27
shows has been a seven hour train
05:29
journey in real time
05:31
across norway
05:32
and it might be quite beautiful actually
05:34
yeah it was and so they broadcasted in
05:36
2009 and over 20 of the population tuned
05:39
in at some point to the show well in
05:41
britain that would just be like 45
05:42
minutes of sat outside milton keynes
05:46
i'd watch that i've seen shots of the
05:48
norwegian one it's gorgeous rolling
05:49
countryside the snow and the furs and
05:51
it's all beautiful and yeah here it
05:53
would not be so nice
05:54
and they keep doing this they've done 18
05:56
hours of fishing for salmon
05:59
and then they had a 12-hour knitting
06:00
night
06:01
and my favorite is national firewood
06:03
night which was in february last year
06:05
which was inspired by a norwegian book
06:07
solid wood all about chopping drying and
06:09
stacking wood which sold as many copies
06:11
as 50 shades of grey in norway
06:14
oh they're a different kind of people
06:15
aren't they
06:17
and the first four hours of national
06:18
firewood night was a discussion of
06:21
firewood and then the next eight hours
06:23
was shot was a live fireplace being
06:25
filmed for eight hours and they had 60
06:27
complaints half were complaining that
06:29
the bark had been put facing up and the
06:31
other half had been complaining that it
06:32
was put facing down
06:37
the people all the time just picking up
06:39
on this idea of things that go on for an
06:41
extended amount of time there's so
06:43
there's obviously the game where it
06:44
takes a lifetime or more than a lifetime
06:46
to play
06:47
there's a lot of musical pieces that do
06:49
exactly that as well john cage famously
06:51
has a piece it's called organ squared
06:54
aslsp as a musical piece um which was
06:57
written in 1987 for an organ
07:00
the piece itself lasts 20 to 70 minutes
07:03
um but it's going to finish it's going
07:05
to go for about 639 years ending in the
07:07
year 2640 and people you know the next
07:11
note is going to be played in a few
07:12
years time and people will go and watch
07:14
that note be played in this continuing
07:16
that sounds good yeah they use john cage
07:19
to teach like beginners piano because a
07:21
lot of his pieces are very easy
07:23
technically speaking it's like piece
07:25
number one don't play anything yeah
07:26
especially four minutes yeah that's one
07:28
of the easiest things to play there's a
07:30
lot of people who accidentally play a
07:31
note during that four minutes
07:34
no no you've got it i've seen where
07:35
you've gone wrong here you've got a
07:37
classic mistake
07:39
did you guys know this game called esp
07:41
and i don't know if this actually exists
07:43
anymore i couldn't get the website to
07:44
open but basically two people
07:46
simultaneously like tag a picture with
07:48
keywords and if you tag it with the same
07:51
word then you get a point and that's how
07:52
they tied a whole bunch of google images
07:55
wow yeah i thought
07:59
is that people around the world are all
08:00
playing this game and they're going to
08:01
see if two people say the same thing at
08:04
the same time and then see if there is
08:05
actually esp going on i don't think it
08:07
counts as esp if you're both showing a
08:09
picture of a table and you both write
08:18
[Applause]
08:20
okay let's move on to fact number two
08:22
this one's my fact the fact is that 2013
08:25
was the first year since 1933 that there
08:28
hasn't been a sighting of the loch ness
08:30
monster so there's huge worries in the
08:32
loch ness monster community because they
08:33
think nessie's dead
08:35
she's just learned to be a bit more
08:36
surreptitious after hundreds of years of
08:38
being constantly spotted if i just stay
08:40
underwater no i think they're worried i
08:43
think because they think nessie is a
08:44
friendly animal uh doesn't mind being
08:46
spotted people like nessie very much so
08:49
it's not an aggressive animal it's never
08:50
in fact in um in 2005 there was a
08:53
triathlon in scotland
08:55
where all of the athletes took a 1
08:57
million pound insurance deal out in case
09:00
of being attacked by the loch ness
09:02
monster when they were swimming across
09:04
the lock and
09:05
the the community came out saying that's
09:07
a ridiculous thing to do if anything she
09:09
would join in she would she would and
09:10
she would beat them because she's a
09:11
great swimmer they're obviously saying
09:13
that next monster is friendly because
09:15
she hasn't killed anyone in the last 70
09:17
years but there is a slight logic flaw
09:19
there isn't you're saying that maybe
09:21
once a century no i'm saying she doesn't
09:23
exist every year uh william hill the
09:25
bookies they do an actual competition
09:28
it's a photo competition where they
09:30
award money to the winner who's provided
09:32
the best photographic evidence of loch
09:34
ness monster and this is the first year
09:36
where they haven't they had to
09:37
disqualify all three entries the first
09:39
one was obviously a duck
09:42
the second one was a wave the third one
09:45
on closer inspection uh just wasn't even
09:47
the lock it was just another body of
09:49
water
09:50
so i have um a theory of what's happened
09:53
to to nessie oh yeah well it's not my
09:55
theory this is the theory by britain's
09:58
high priest of white witches kevin
10:00
carlion and he says i personally believe
10:03
nessie is a ghost of a dinosaur who has
10:05
been regularly seen in the lot
10:07
but the spirit of the creature has been
10:09
so exploited in recent years i decided
10:11
to carry out an exorcism hence no
10:14
sightings of the monster so he's saying
10:15
that he has personally killed off nessie
10:18
yeah he just thinks that people say busy
10:20
yeah people have been um messing around
10:22
with this spirit of a dinosaur and he
10:24
wanted to set it free i really like the
10:26
mythical creatures that um that we come
10:28
up with there are so many of them in
10:29
britain i don't really know if other
10:30
countries have them to the same extent
10:32
but uh my favorite i came across in uh
10:34
i'm reading our mutual friend at the
10:36
moment and i've decided to read all of
10:38
the footnotes and if you're ever reading
10:40
i think dickens especially but like read
10:41
all the footnotes they're so interesting
10:43
one of them made reference to the done
10:44
cow this um vicious beast that was slain
10:48
by guy earl of warwick who was one of
10:50
these like pre-medieval british heroes
10:53
um and yeah it was just this cow and it
10:55
produced an everlasting supply of milk
10:56
and eventually got annoyed that people
10:57
were like milking it and milking it
10:59
nothing it ran away from its farm in
11:00
shropshire and eventually guy earl of
11:02
warwick who seems like i sort of sent
11:04
george of the 10th century went out and
11:05
had to slay the cow yeah you say saint
11:08
george but slaying a cow is not quite as
11:10
impressive as slave dragon has that
11:11
although he did also slay a dragon which
11:14
was it it must have seemed like a step
11:15
down when
11:16
it's going down difficult second monster
11:18
syndrome yeah
11:21
if you go to warwick castle certainly
11:23
until the 90s i'm not sure if it's still
11:24
there because i haven't seen it you can
11:26
see the rib of the dun cow and that the
11:28
king ordered um would should be like put
11:31
in where it comes is it big
11:34
yes it is bigger they think that it's
11:35
actually an elephant tusk i mean
11:37
skeptics think that it might not be the
11:39
rib of the giant dun cow that's even
11:44
instead of saying oh it's a great crazy
11:46
magical cow
11:47
why is this elephant been there
11:49
maybe that's what they meant by a giant
11:51
cow because you know that you know that
11:53
the initial
11:54
photo taken in 1933 of the loch ness
11:56
monster the very famous photo they think
11:58
that that's an elephant no in the lake
12:01
yeah yeah justify that there was a
12:03
circus in town at the time elephants as
12:05
we've seen in david attenborough
12:07
documentaries do go swimming and when
12:08
they do they use their trunks as
12:09
snorkels and if you look at the photo it
12:11
looks exactly like an elephant trunk uh
12:12
do you guys remember that story in 2011
12:14
where police in southampton uh went on
12:16
the alert because there was a tiger
12:18
sighting in one of the fields and then
12:20
there was a gust of wind that blew it
12:21
over and it was a cuddly toy there was a
12:23
lions gear in the 70s in britain which
12:25
turned out to be a paper bag
12:28
well i don't remember the details there
12:30
was a lion scare on me last year that
12:31
turned out to be a large cat so um anna
12:34
you were saying you're not sure if other
12:35
countries have similar kind of models
12:38
enlightenment so i have i have one or
12:40
two here so um the lake okanagan in
12:44
canada they have a monster which is very
12:46
similar to nessie and um every year they
12:48
give a 50 prize to anyone who can shout
12:51
loud enough to wake the beast up so
12:53
everyone stands on the side of the lake
12:55
yells wake up wake up
12:57
and if anyone can wake them up they get
12:59
fifty dollars and they go home with the
13:01
same fifty dollars don't they
13:04
yet no winners i think isn't there a
13:06
fact you told me years ago i seemed to
13:07
remember that there was a animal similar
13:10
to the loch ness monster that had
13:11
protection policy on it in a different
13:14
country yeah in sweden that was uh it
13:16
was the storch young monster i think you
13:18
pronounce it and it was classified as an
13:20
endangered species in the 80s or
13:22
sometime like that yeah because as a
13:24
result of that direct result of that um
13:27
the thatcher government uh actually put
13:29
the loch ness monster on the animal
13:31
protection oh really yeah they were
13:33
going to do exactly the same they were
13:34
going to do what sweden did but they
13:35
decided that that was one step too far
13:37
so they would they would just put in
13:38
they were actually there was there was a
13:40
document that was put in front of
13:42
thatcher or thatcher's main people which
13:45
was they wanted to bring to blue
13:46
blue-nosed dolphins over from america to
13:49
search for the loch ness monster really
13:50
yeah it was it never got passed but it
13:52
was this was the tory government
13:54
what would happen when the dolphins find
13:57
is it like flipper they'll come back and
13:58
go i'd like to yeah
14:01
[Laughter]
14:04
speaking of hollywood people what about
14:06
charlie sheen he went looking for the
14:07
loch ness monster he did you know what i
14:09
you know you're saying that there's this
14:10
guy who exercised the ghost
14:12
charlie sheen is getting a lot of stick
14:14
from the loch ness monster community
14:16
because they think the loch ness monster
14:18
doesn't like two and a half men or maybe
14:19
they want to binge together
14:21
he went into the loch ness with a
14:23
fishing hook and a and he he attached a
14:25
leg of lamb to a fishing rod and tried
14:27
to catch it on an old wooden boat you
14:29
know what
14:30
call me captain skeptical
14:32
but i don't think that's any less
14:33
sensible than trying to exercise its
14:35
ghost
14:36
or look for it in the first place
14:40
[Applause]
14:47
okay uh time for fact number three this
14:49
is your fact anna yeah um so my fact is
14:53
that the french government forced madame
14:56
to sword to make models of her friends
14:58
decapitated heads
14:59
oh
15:00
yeah poor old madame it's kind of like
15:02
how her career started
15:04
during the revolution oh exactly yeah it
15:06
was during the terror and the the story
15:08
goes that she actually had her head
15:10
shaved and everything and they were
15:11
ready to um decapitate her as well
15:13
because she was friends with the royal
15:14
family and she had like various mates in
15:16
high places and she'd made wax models of
15:18
a lot of them and just before they they
15:20
dropped the guillotine they were like
15:22
actually you come in handy because we
15:23
want to make these death masks of our
15:24
victims and so she writes in her memoirs
15:27
about having to sift through these piles
15:28
of heads decapitated heads and pick them
15:31
up have them on her lap and making uh
15:33
making models of them yeah i i read an
15:35
account of it and i kind of got the
15:36
impression that it turned into something
15:38
she really enjoyed yeah i mean she had
15:39
no choice but you know when you kind of
15:41
just get used to something you know it's
15:43
your job you know you're now
15:44
waxing
15:46
heads for a living it was like a
15:47
treasure hunt effectively she was going
15:49
my god look this is this is the bloke
15:51
who's in the paper last week isn't he
15:52
marie antoinette's like never coming on
15:54
an easter egg hunt with you
15:57
look if you just get used to it you'll
15:59
really enjoy it
16:01
was um was my dances for the only wax
16:04
work person at the time i don't think so
16:06
i think she just made um so it's been
16:08
going on for hundreds of years i think
16:10
she was just very much a self-made woman
16:12
well my understanding of madame tussaud
16:14
is that she was an apprentice to a
16:15
doctor yeah and he would make wax um
16:18
bits of internal organs is that right oh
16:21
yeah was his name curtius yes um
16:24
but
16:25
there's a theory that he may have been
16:27
her father
16:28
her biological father yes scandal i know
16:31
her mother's husband was killed two
16:32
months before
16:33
she was the madame tyson was born um but
16:35
there is a theory that that he was very
16:38
natural because i heard about this guy
16:39
that he made most of his money making um
16:41
erotic wax miniatures
16:43
is that true i don't know i didn't see
16:45
that really that cast kind of uh
16:48
an odd light on him having this 15 year
16:50
old girl making wax models for him in
16:52
his little office creepy she was
16:54
obviously talented though she was when
16:56
she was 16 i think she made models of
16:58
russo and voltaire i love voltaire
17:01
because voltaire
17:03
had a statistician friend
17:05
who figured out that this lottery that
17:07
the french government was proposing
17:09
as a way of it making money actually um
17:12
if you brought up all the tickets of it
17:14
you are guaranteed to win more money
17:15
than you'd spent buying the tickets so
17:17
voltaire brought up all the tickets
17:19
offered in this french lottery and um
17:20
became the equivalent of a millionaire
17:22
today and never had to work again i
17:23
don't know if this is um completely true
17:25
but uh with madame tussauds these days
17:27
when they do a wax work for someone um
17:29
there's no contracts or anything and
17:31
technically i think people could request
17:33
for it to be taken away they could say
17:35
i'm not i don't want uh to be done as a
17:37
wax work but everyone just finds it such
17:39
an honor that yeah they're fine for it
17:41
to be done yeah i think you would
17:42
wouldn't you some people put a few
17:43
clauses with it so tom cruise and mel
17:45
gibson have both said um you can do me
17:47
and it's fine and people can take photos
17:49
but no press are allowed to take photos
17:50
of the wax work because then they'll
17:52
start using that um
17:54
shots and and so they've said you're not
17:56
allowed to they're good but they're not
17:58
that good yeah
18:00
tom cruise spotted again in madame
18:02
tussauds but
18:04
he just loves that place i find it very
18:06
interesting who they pick who the pool
18:08
of people is now is almost all
18:10
celebrities although every monarch since
18:11
george iii has had a wax work made of
18:13
themselves
18:14
every king and queen of england off the
18:16
top of my head ian duncan smith is the
18:17
only leader of the conservative party
18:19
not to have had a wax work no that's
18:21
just because he's the most likely isn't
18:22
it well it takes a while as well to make
18:24
the wax work and he wasn't leaving for
18:25
very long
18:26
so i imagine by the time they book the
18:28
appointments he was out do you know
18:30
jenny ryan who yeah worked on qi a few
18:32
years ago well and she had to ring up um
18:35
madame sousa for another reason to find
18:37
out which was the um most groped wax
18:40
work at madame tussaud and she found out
18:42
that it was brad pitt and the way they
18:44
found out is they work it out by um
18:46
which is the one that's taken in for
18:48
maintenance and more stuff because
18:50
presumably would have had to have been
18:51
taken over maintenance constantly they
18:53
had hitler in a glass box didn't they
18:55
because they were worried that he was
18:56
going to be repeatedly attacked and in
18:58
fact and then he was beheaded in fact
19:00
yeah someone ripped his head off was
19:02
that before or after or when was that
19:05
2008. oh 2008. it's not lunatic to have
19:07
made one during the war i suppose i
19:09
think he had his maid in the 1930s
19:11
really
19:12
gradually they moved it from you know
19:14
honored place with other statesmen to
19:15
the ground floor to the chamber of
19:17
commerce then eventually in the loo or
19:19
something like that
19:20
there's also um there was a rumor going
19:22
around that gary barlow was melted down
19:25
into britney spears
19:28
but it turned out that wasn't true he
19:30
was taken away he was taken out after
19:32
take that had finished but he was
19:33
brought back when robbie williams and
19:35
take that got back together um but it
19:37
meant that he's kept in a warehouse in
19:39
the interim and apparently there's a
19:40
warehouse with all these fallen wax
19:43
works yeah which is kind of it's like
19:44
the uh like the end of raiders of the
19:45
lost ark and i don't know who were in
19:47
there that is the stuff of nightmares i
19:49
really think imagine being locked in
19:50
that warehouse it's just going to be old
19:51
people from the 80s isn't it yeah
19:54
vanilla rice is in there and i read uh
19:56
as well that uh
19:58
some people are so enthusiastic about
20:00
being turned into a wax work that they
20:02
just do as much as they can to help out
20:04
with the authenticity of oh yeah and
20:06
boris johnson when he was turned into a
20:08
wax work he gave on the spot after they
20:10
measured him the clothes that he was
20:12
wearing and he left thank you
20:16
that was his excuse for why he was found
20:17
wandering naked
20:20
but if you visit boris johnson at madame
20:22
two swords have a look at the bottom of
20:24
his trousers because you'll notice that
20:26
there's a um a rip and that's a rip from
20:28
a bike chain from when he was riding
20:30
over to be measured
20:32
um is one of the pr stunts
20:35
i love cycling that is the best um
20:37
cockney rhyming slang i've ever heard pr
20:39
stunts
20:45
apparently in the past five years 120
20:48
pairs of false teeth and one false leg
20:50
have been left behind in madame two
20:51
swords one section
20:55
what what who leaves their teeth yeah i
20:58
don't know 123 pairs five years it's a
21:00
lot isn't it um one last fact yes about
21:02
wax works and wax in general uh it's
21:05
possible to fire lasers and a fly's
21:07
brain and make it have sex with a ball
21:10
of wax not only possible it's great fun
21:13
for the fly order
21:15
i suppose the fly if the fly doesn't
21:16
know that it's having sex with a ball of
21:17
wax so that will feel stupid afterwards
21:19
yeah we've all been there
21:23
[Applause]
21:27
okay uh final
21:29
um and we come to you andy my fact is
21:32
that during the normandy landings the
21:34
allied forces dropped dogs by parachute
21:37
onto
21:38
the battlefield
21:40
they the uk deployed parachute dogs um
21:42
in the second world war which were used
21:44
to identify minefields and to keep watch
21:46
and to warn of enemies yeah you know
21:48
when you say identify minefields does
21:50
that basically mean wander over a minor
21:52
field
21:54
sniffer dogs yeah yeah they could smell
21:56
them and they so yeah there were three
21:58
uh initially just three sent over uh
22:00
brian monty and renee and renee i think
22:03
was the only female parachutist in the
22:05
british army during the war and they
22:07
were sent in with the 13th lancashire
22:09
paris and then one of the articles i
22:10
read it said they were called paradox
22:12
brackets short for parachuting dogs
22:17
um but the the war office have made
22:19
radio appeals in 1941 for people to give
22:21
up their dogs for the war movement and
22:23
basically lots of people used it as an
22:24
opportunity to just get rid of their
22:26
dogs
22:27
so they they had thousands sent in and
22:28
lots of them weren't suitable so were
22:30
they trained to like pull the parachute
22:33
right time i think the parachutes opened
22:35
automatically and they were because they
22:37
were the right uh shape and size though
22:39
they were given the same parachutes that
22:41
the paratroopers used to drop bicycles
22:43
over the battlefield oh which they all
22:45
sorry abby are you saying a dog is the
22:47
same shape as a bicycle and size and you
22:50
can if you pedal it right they're the
22:52
same effects
22:54
that's a very good point um yeah the
22:56
first training was to jump out of the
22:57
plane with a bit of meat in your pocket
23:00
and then just chase them and then i
23:02
think for someone else to throw the dog
23:03
out of the people
23:05
it's actually slightly crueler than that
23:06
they used to starve the dogs um and so
23:09
what they would do is they would hold
23:10
the meat outside the plane so the dogs
23:12
would have yeah yeah yeah
23:14
how else are you gonna get a dog out
23:15
other than throwing it yes yeah but
23:17
they're not cruel
23:18
i think eventually they got used to it
23:20
though didn't they you do get used to it
23:22
though i remember watching a really
23:24
interesting documentary a while back
23:25
about um i think it was 12 paratroopers
23:27
in the second world war who they did
23:29
their first parachute jump and they were
23:30
obviously terrified as you are when you
23:31
throw yourself out of a plane for the
23:32
first time really really nervous and
23:34
then obviously they did it for the
23:35
subsequent five years got really used to
23:37
it not scared at all didn't parachute
23:39
for 50 years and this documentary picked
23:41
up on them when they were in their 70s
23:42
and 80s and said jonah do a patrick jump
23:44
again let's see how it is and after 50
23:46
years not a trace of fear in them and
23:48
it's like this thing where the way to
23:49
get over a phobia permanently is to do
23:51
it repeatedly and you're cured for life
23:53
so 50 years they didn't parachute and
23:54
they all just blase
23:56
up in the plane
23:57
when you're looking for
23:59
illustrious decapitated heads you get
24:01
used to it
24:02
so i have something else about people
24:04
dropping stuff by parachute during the
24:06
war and during mussolini's invasion of
24:08
ethiopia and they dropped
24:11
sheep and bulls by parachute and the
24:14
reason was and they needed food they
24:16
were in the desert and what's the best
24:17
way of doing it you can drop meat down
24:19
that's fair enough or you can drop live
24:21
animals and then they can butcher them
24:22
themselves whenever they need the meat
24:24
and so that's what they did they dropped
24:25
their bulls and the sheep they um
24:28
attached them to modified harnesses and
24:30
parachuted them down to the soldiers
24:31
that is amazing
24:33
yeah that must be the biggest thing
24:34
that's ever been parachuted a bull i
24:37
read that in parachutes actually during
24:39
war times um people as well as you know
24:42
you'd look out for it because of enemy
24:44
but you would also uh be looking out for
24:46
it because parachutes the the material
24:48
was
24:49
such a collectible it was there's a
24:51
thing that everyone yeah yeah like
24:52
apparently if it was a silk one that
24:54
would be they come in little triangles
24:56
and you would turn them into under
24:57
through um otherwise they have no
24:59
underwear oh it's like a new meaning to
25:01
go in commando
25:02
[Laughter]
25:05
i love have you guys seen the footage of
25:07
friends oh yeah rachel yeah were you
25:10
watching that poor guy who developed a
25:13
parachute suit i think starting in 1910
25:15
and i just love the fact that he so he
25:17
made this parachute suit which he
25:18
decided was going to be useful effective
25:20
and work and it just didn't work
25:21
consistently didn't and he threw various
25:23
dummies wearing it off from various
25:26
heights and they all just plummeted to
25:27
the ground and died of dummy death and
25:29
then he tried to throw himself off there
25:31
at like 10 meters high sort of levels um
25:33
fell broke his leg and so he thought
25:36
well this has gone well i'm gonna ask if
25:38
i can throw myself off the eiffel tower
25:40
wearing it um and so yeah he did and
25:43
died and you can watch it you can watch
25:44
on youtube it's an extraordinary bit of
25:46
footage that's amazing i didn't realize
25:48
that it had gone so badly before he
25:50
decided to jump off the eiffel tower
25:52
just to get just to give him the benefit
25:53
of the doubt isn't did he jump off the
25:55
viewing platform at the eiffel tower
25:56
yeah because
25:58
and that's quite low isn't it yep i
25:59
would have been surprised if
26:01
maybe if he jumped from higher it might
26:03
have worked that was what some people
26:05
said some people claim that his parish
26:07
it looked like his parachute suit
26:09
at the last moment the last split second
26:11
but i actually can't i've watched it
26:13
that sounds like um a wiley coyote and
26:15
roadrunner thing doesn't mean
26:17
he splats down and then the parachute
26:19
over yeah
26:22
yeah he had the most amazing moustache
26:24
though i wondered why the mustache
26:26
didn't save him with the air resistance
26:27
it's so good one of my favorite facts
26:29
about d-day landings is that four
26:32
percent of the sand on the beach today
26:34
in normandy is made up of tiny metal
26:36
particles left over from artillery
26:38
explosions during the attack no four
26:41
percent
26:41
that's a lot isn't it yeah did you guys
26:44
read that in the year 2000 if someone
26:45
tried to replicate leonardo da vinci's
26:47
who was one of the first people to
26:48
design a parachute oh yeah it was like a
26:50
triangular one was it yeah it was um i
26:52
think it was it was a bunch of triangles
26:54
and anyway it definitely had wood
26:55
involved so in his design it was like
26:57
some sort of cloth and wooden um things
27:00
holding it together wooden planks
27:02
holding it together so someone tried to
27:03
recreate this near 2000 but it used
27:05
modern materials and said it worked and
27:06
it was this like it was all over the
27:09
news saying you know davinci davinci's
27:11
design works this guy survived but he
27:13
used cloth and modern materials i feel
27:16
like if you built a parachute out of
27:17
wood it would never have worked would it
27:19
don't think it would work
27:20
yeah right um
27:22
the official i guess first parachute
27:25
jump as far as we know the first public
27:27
one so it was done by uh louis sebastian
27:29
lenimond in montpellier in france and
27:32
his very first jump was off a tree
27:34
holding two umbrellas cool that was the
27:36
very first parachute jumped so do we not
27:37
count um the
27:39
mullensburg monk isle mer of marne spree
27:42
um who was the 11th century monk who
27:44
flew 200 meters when he jumped off the
27:46
top of mars abbey he was airborne for 15
27:48
seconds they've worked out because they
27:50
know where he landed and where he took
27:51
off from and how high it was and he just
27:53
made a bunch of wings for himself on his
27:55
feet and his hands and he said if he'd
27:58
remember to make himself a tail then he
28:00
would have he would have been unharmed
28:01
and that actually seems to be true
28:03
because it like gives you an equilibrium
28:04
and means that you're giving me a really
28:06
bad workman
28:09
i think that sounds very true and people
28:12
would have thought him a fool when he
28:14
did that and yet a few hundred years
28:16
later we are throwing dogs out of planes
28:18
to help identify mines still doing it
28:21
2010 uh german shepherds were being
28:23
flown in and dropped over taliban
28:26
regions yeah because it's fine on the
28:28
taliban it's a spice yeah it's gonna
28:30
have little cameras on them wow yeah
28:32
yeah german shepherds
28:33
i like the idea i like the fact that in
28:35
the war it was german shepherds that the
28:36
british were dropping on germany i mean
28:38
the nazis must have thought
28:39
you treasure
28:42
that reminded me that there's always um
28:44
countries that find an animal and then
28:47
arrest it for spying that happens all
28:49
the time isn't it yes uh was it saudi
28:51
arabia or i'm making this up saudi
28:53
arabia that um arrested a coconut for
28:55
spiders
29:09
there was a bounty on his head
29:17

[Music]
00:21
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:23
no such thing as a fish a weekly qi
00:26
podcast coming to you from the qi
00:28
offices in covent garden my name is dan
00:30
schreiber i'm sitting here with three
00:32
other elves james harkin alex bell and
00:34
anna chazinski and once again we're
00:36
gathering around our microphone and
00:38
we're gonna share with each other our
00:40
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:42
so in no particular order here they are
00:47
alex let's start with you okay my fact
00:50
is that one of the last things that nasa
00:52
had to do before launching space
00:54
shuttles was detach their inflatable
00:56
owls
00:59
wow
01:00
why would they have inflatable owls on
01:02
those space shuttles basically um this
01:04
was at um cape kennedy and uh they had a
01:07
bit of a wildlife problem there just
01:09
generally because these launch pad is
01:11
actually in the middle of a nature
01:12
reserve right um so one of the problems
01:14
they had was with woodpeckers um on the
01:16
the fuel big fuel tanks on the side of
01:18
the space shuttle they're sort of bright
01:20
orange and they're covered in foam
01:21
insulation which is quite delicate and
01:23
they had this problem with woodpeckers
01:24
that were just coming up and packing
01:25
holes in them and they have no idea why
01:27
they were doing this
01:28
so didn't they didn't they actually have
01:30
to cancel
01:31
a shuttle launch in order to because too
01:33
much damage was done to where uh
01:35
discovery i think was one of the ones
01:37
delayed by quite a lot and then councils
01:38
and reschedules and things um so they
01:40
did several things firstly they used
01:42
sound blasters which i think were some
01:44
sort of sound thing to scare away
01:46
woodpeckers they also apparently had a
01:48
24 um hour bird watching contingent
01:52
on the run up to the launch to like keep
01:53
an eye out but yeah i read that um there
01:56
were people members of the public when
01:58
they'd heard about this riding in with
01:59
their own suggestions
02:00
like amateur scientists yeah yeah
02:02
there's great suggestions one of them
02:03
was to paint the tanks blue a color
02:06
woodpeckers hate
02:09
station falcons at the pads so acting
02:12
yeah effectively falcons would chase
02:14
them off um boil skunk cabbage and spray
02:16
water on the tanks
02:18
what's skunk cabbage i have no idea this
02:21
is just what is hate blue do they like
02:23
sunny days are just a nightmare well
02:25
they're not trying to peck the sky
02:27
oh they just don't like the taste of
02:28
blue
02:31
um i just say i'm not allowed to let my
02:33
dog off the lead in a nature reserve and
02:35
nasa can build like an entire space
02:37
station in the middle of one it seems
02:38
like not a good place to put it well i
02:40
think there was decor some issues there
02:42
were some other problems as well i've
02:43
got an article from a newspaper from
02:45
1983 that's um headlined nasa must cope
02:48
with wild pigs there's a quote from it
02:49
saying that um the space center
02:51
officials say they routinely check
02:53
runways for pigs and alligators before
02:55
any aircraft is clear to land i don't
02:57
think that's space shuttles but that's
02:58
um yeah alligator is supposedly always
03:00
lounging out because it's a nice heated
03:02
pad yeah for the landing strip yeah it's
03:04
not a great place for pigs to be living
03:06
where alligators live as well
03:09
cctv footage they must have epic battles
03:12
on the runways where shuttles are coming
03:13
in between an alligator and a pig who's
03:15
the one with the bats have you seen that
03:17
one with one of when one of the shuttles
03:18
launched and you can see a little bat
03:20
that was obviously sleeping on the
03:22
shuttle and obviously woke up when his
03:23
home took off
03:26
and and that's had to say we're really
03:27
sorry but he probably died everyone was
03:29
really upset
03:32
on the pig thing nasa actually hired a
03:34
pig trapper only in this article can you
03:36
imagine kind of going into someone
03:38
saying yeah i work for nasa what do you
03:39
do yeah i trapped there yeah i'm the pig
03:44
um speaking of pigs this is almost
03:46
unrelated but did you know medieval
03:48
times in england pigs were a bigger pest
03:50
than rats in london and feral pigs were
03:52
all over london the government offered
03:54
rewards if you could kill a pig and
03:55
bring them evidence that you'd kill the
03:57
feral pig they'd just be in your
03:58
cupboards eating your cereal
04:01
pooing all over the kitchen floor
04:04
so we haven't said so the reason they
04:06
had owls inflatable owls is because of
04:08
these woodpeckers and that was the
04:10
solution to put these out so these
04:12
they're basically just spherical like
04:14
spherical balloons with our owl eyes and
04:16
sort of like a like an evil eyebrow
04:18
painted on the top to look like an hour
04:20
i'll put some pictures up on the website
04:21
um but they're cool they were called uh
04:23
i think like owl terra eyes and then you
04:26
can buy them now as well they just sort
04:27
of festooned them over the the structure
04:29
of the space shuttle like halloween
04:30
decorations because they did they did
04:32
have owls that were living on the crane
04:34
that was attached to the space shuttle
04:36
um i don't know if there's a theory that
04:39
during that period that's why there were
04:40
no woodpeckers there because there was
04:41
owls living there but i got into a lot
04:43
of trouble with the rspca and other
04:46
wildlife foundations because when they
04:48
did take off this one time they blasted
04:50
these owls
04:53
it's terrible but what's interesting is
04:54
that nasa has actually been talked into
04:57
taking it quite seriously and looking
04:58
after the animals so they actively do do
05:01
that so if they're going to retrieve any
05:02
of the booster rockets that land in the
05:04
banana river which has apparently the
05:06
largest uh refuge of manatees uh in in
05:10
america they now use water jets as
05:12
opposed to propellers so that they don't
05:13
kill any of the water
05:14
so they've changed the system for that
05:16
um this is an interesting one they used
05:18
to have blinding lights that shined when
05:20
they were on the launch pads that the
05:22
turtles that were going into the sea
05:24
um log head sea turtles they would see
05:26
the light as opposed to the moonshine
05:28
and the moonshine would usually direct
05:29
them to the ocean but they would see the
05:31
launch pad lights and they would head
05:33
towards the launch pad lights and die on
05:35
the way because they'd never reach the
05:36
ocean so they've changed their lights to
05:38
be less disorientating bulbs good for
05:41
nasa
05:42
so i like lo-fi things that they do uh
05:45
the astronauts do like um
05:47
they they use taco sauce to secure
05:49
debris on the iss and um they're inside
05:53
the space suits they have a little bit
05:54
of um um they have a little bit of
05:56
velcro that they use to itch their nose
05:59
with because they can't itch their nose
06:00
and stuff like that oh yeah stuff like
06:02
that yeah nasa is very good like the
06:04
owls is a good example of just a
06:05
continuing
06:06
tradition of highly inventive solutions
06:09
yeah what was the one that you initially
06:11
alex you had a fact that you wanted to
06:13
use oh i think this has been doing
06:15
around the internet recently apparently
06:16
but um i was watching a really old
06:18
documentary about
06:20
various aspects of the earlier space
06:22
program and apparently um in the men's
06:25
spacesuits
06:26
there's a sort of condom-like sheath
06:28
that the astronauts have to wear so they
06:30
can go to the loo in the suits
06:33
and they came in three sizes which was
06:34
small medium and large but all the
06:36
astronauts were just picking large and
06:37
they refused
06:39
nasa decided to change the names to uh
06:42
large gigantic and humongous
06:49
which i really like charlie duke who was
06:51
on apollo 16. he had such a problem with
06:53
swearing that he had to be hypnotized
06:55
before
06:56
heading into space so that he wouldn't
06:58
swear once he was on the moon
07:00
so when they were doing live broadcasts
07:02
are you not allowed to swear on the moon
07:03
well no i think because we were being
07:05
you know we were hearing everything
07:07
yeah so he was told not to swear and um
07:09
it led as a result he sings a lot on the
07:12
moon because that was the compensation
07:15
in the hypnosis he got suddenly
07:17
a singer every time he was going to
07:19
swear he just belt it out my way or
07:21
something yeah yeah
07:23
there was that guy i can't remember
07:24
which astronaut it was i bet one of you
07:26
guys remembers who smug got told off
07:27
really badly smuggling a sandwich into
07:29
space i think it was corned beef
07:30
sandwich wasn't it and i remember who it
07:32
was in the 1960s yes but then weirdly uh
07:35
when buzz and neil armstrong landed on
07:37
the moon their first meal was a ham
07:38
salad sandwich yeah oh yeah and we know
07:41
that buzz um smuggled some stuff up to
07:43
the moon though he did yeah yeah he
07:45
smuggled up some um wine and some holy
07:49
bread which had been blessed by a priest
07:51
yeah to do the first ever communion yeah
07:53
incredible you could sneak
07:55
yeah it really is it makes me question
07:57
nasa whether we can put nasa in charge
07:59
of outer space missions but they can't
08:01
even body search someone properly uh
08:03
apollo 12 you get a checklist which are
08:04
these kind of flipboards that you get on
08:06
onboard the ship um some of the
08:08
prankster kind of employees for nasa
08:10
some of the engineers snuck on playboy
08:13
photos in between the checklist so yeah
08:17
we'll put a photo up on uh qi.com
08:19
podcast it's uh
08:23
it's history james
08:25
you're really trying to get people onto
08:27
our website
08:27
[Laughter]
08:29
come to qi.com podcast you can see naked
08:32
ladies boobs from outer space
08:41
okay uh time for fact number two this
08:43
one's mine um so we all know the um the
08:47
famous uh advert that comes on at the
08:49
beginning of dvds that sort of
08:51
pirates you wouldn't steal a card
08:56
yeah anyway it turns out that the music
08:58
used in that anti-piracy advert was
09:00
stolen
09:02
oh yeah so the irony the advert that's
09:05
telling you right at the end what's it
09:07
say alex that says piracy is a crime i
09:10
think piracy is stealing piracy is
09:11
stealing yeah so and so is stealing and
09:13
so is there that stuff that was feeling
09:15
as a crime um it was officially i mean
09:18
it was commissioned for an anti-piracy
09:20
ad but it was meant to be used just at a
09:22
small film festival where they were sort
09:24
of showcasing this thing so the guy who
09:26
created it whose name is melchior
09:29
wrightvelt um he wrote this music he got
09:31
given basic money for it to be used at
09:32
this local film festival and then in
09:34
2007 he bought a harry potter dvd
09:38
at the top was this advert with his
09:40
music
09:41
and so since 2007 all the way to 2012
09:43
he's been trying to say could i have the
09:45
money please because he was owed
09:47
millions i mean for the amount of use
09:50
yeah and so so finally uh the company
09:52
that was using it called him up a guy
09:54
called mr garrett's
09:57
and he said that he would pay him out
09:58
for one million euros but that mr
10:00
gerritz would get to keep one third of
10:02
that money for all the hard work and
10:04
trouble that he'd gone through to get
10:05
him that one million euros so anyway he
10:07
recorded that conversation he played it
10:09
mr garrett's got fired and um he's been
10:11
compensated since
10:13
it's pretty appalling that they did that
10:15
though it's not great i know it will get
10:17
us out of this mess yeah old fashioned
10:18
bride
10:21
what
10:22
did you guys know that harley davidson
10:24
tried to trademark the sound of its revs
10:26
what yep those three revs apparently i
10:28
don't really know much about motorbikes
10:30
but apparently the three revs at the
10:32
start uh sound like i think this is on
10:34
the harley davidson website sound like
10:36
potato potato potato and fair enough and
10:40
loads of other motorbike manufacturers
10:41
said i'm really sorry our revs sound
10:43
really similar um you can't do this and
10:45
they didn't um as the copyright is
10:47
slapping your ass
10:49
really yeah they did yeah does it you
10:51
know it goes that advert where
10:56
didn't they go that's asda price yeah
10:58
that's right is it just your own art or
11:00
anyone's like is it they've copyrighted
11:02
a sexual advance basically yeah
11:04
[Laughter]
11:07
basically the way these things work is
11:08
it's only in in the specific area if
11:11
you're trying to pass off as their kind
11:13
of thing so um aldi or waitrose couldn't
11:16
do an r slapping kind of advert because
11:18
they copyrighted it for that there was
11:20
also um someone um copyrighted touching
11:24
the side of your nose as if to indicate
11:26
knowledge and also tipping a bowler hat
11:29
and they're both registered by building
11:31
societies
11:32
really
11:33
i think it's a we're living in a really
11:34
interesting time when it comes to
11:36
copyright and
11:38
piracy and so on because we don't quite
11:40
yet know if it works for or against
11:43
the people who either make or sell over
11:45
there but like for example monty python
11:46
decided they were going to put up a
11:48
bunch of clips on youtube from their old
11:49
monty python flying circus series and
11:52
actually it had the reverse effect of
11:53
what you would think in on the amazon
11:55
charts they went up to number two and
11:56
the sales increased by an estimated 16
11:59
000 to 23 000 yeah on amazon alone
12:03
and that's that worked in their favor
12:04
whereas everyone would encourage you not
12:06
to do that because
12:07
so it's really odd it's you don't know
12:09
if it's if it works for again well the
12:11
guys at netflix they look into um what
12:13
people are pirating and then they decide
12:15
what to buy depending on what people are
12:17
pirating really sensible that's very
12:19
sensible yeah i like with video games um
12:22
they have a different approach to
12:24
anti-piracy they actually embed within
12:26
their games protection
12:28
uh things so that you can continue
12:30
playing the game but you know that
12:31
you've got a stolen item for example
12:33
there's a game called michael jackson
12:35
the experience which is on ds
12:37
um and the idea is that once the game
12:40
realizes that you've got a pirated
12:42
version of it it halts it and it just
12:44
plays rosella music all over it so it's
12:47
just like
12:48
flat so it's just like an instant loop
12:50
that's pretty clever though yeah
12:52
there's a batman game as well which when
12:54
it knows that you've got a pirated copy
12:56
batman comes in kicks your ass
12:58
physically comes through the door no his
13:00
cape will refuse to open uh preventing
13:03
players from gliding and gliding is a
13:05
massive part of the game so you can only
13:06
get so far without being to do anything
13:09
talking about uh similar things to that
13:11
um in the early days of cinema they had
13:14
silent cinema and people with pirate
13:15
films um
13:17
basically by just taking an entire film
13:19
cutting in a bit of new material and re
13:21
releasing it as a new picture
13:23
and there was a company called the
13:25
biograph company and what they did was
13:28
they made sure that their trademark was
13:29
in every single shot so it would be on a
13:32
door or on a wall or in a window or a
13:34
t-shirt or something like that so that
13:36
every time someone did that they'd just
13:38
see their trademark all the way through
13:39
the movie yeah yeah that's very good
13:41
they um the uh
13:43
years ago on museum of curiosity we had
13:45
terry pratchett on oh yeah he told us
13:47
this thing about in germany in the
13:49
german translated versions of his books
13:51
he said someone would write to him from
13:53
germany saying do you know that they've
13:55
placed adverts in your book and so terry
13:58
was fine because he was like well you
14:00
know in america back in the day that's
14:02
what they would do that would be just an
14:03
advert a full-page advert for a
14:05
cigarette company or something like that
14:07
and you just continue reading so he was
14:08
fine with it and so he said no that's
14:10
cool but the person wrote back saying no
14:11
no they've inserted the ad into the
14:14
dialogue amongst the characters
14:17
so while the characters from his
14:19
discworld novels are running around they
14:21
would suddenly stop because they were
14:22
quite parched and crack open a coca-cola
14:26
while they were being chased or opened
14:28
some maggie two-minute noodles and make
14:31
some two-minute noodles before carrying
14:32
on with what terry pratchett had written
14:34
but so they uh apparently this wasn't
14:36
just terry pratchett books there was a
14:37
lot of books in germany and pratchett
14:39
wrote to them and he's had this stopped
14:41
now but yeah that's so good yeah they
14:43
also i like um because uh it reminded me
14:46
that in china
14:48
uh there's a lot of a similar thing
14:49
where they take existing text or you
14:52
know footage but in this case text so
14:54
with harry potter books because of the
14:55
distance of time between each of the
14:57
sequels people just started writing
14:59
their own harry potter books and
15:01
publishing in china fiction yeah i've
15:02
got i've got a list uh harry potter and
15:04
the big funnel
15:07
this is great i'll give you this as the
15:08
blurb that came on the book yeah yeah no
15:10
no they were all they were all trying to
15:12
pass themselves off as genuine books um
15:14
this is the blurb after six years at
15:16
hogwarts harry potter has become an
15:18
intern sorcerer and is assigned to teach
15:20
at the honorton school harry has a
15:22
painful time at his aunt's house as
15:24
dudley has met a belly dancing girl as
15:27
harry prepares to report to his job
15:29
batbug warns him disaster awaits
15:32
exciting new character
15:34
at the school his students become wooden
15:36
stools one after another harry doesn't
15:39
know whether an evil student is behind
15:41
this or if his old benefactor hagrid is
15:43
making a mistake or if the shadow of
15:45
voldemort has returned
15:47
or
15:48
did it had something to do
15:50
with the big funnel
16:02
[Laughter]
16:04
the french version of harry potter the
16:06
book um because lord voldemort's name
16:08
his full name tom marvello riddle has to
16:09
be an anagram of i am lord voldemort
16:11
yeah and so it doesn't work in all
16:13
different countries so they have to
16:14
change his name and in france his middle
16:15
name is elvis
16:17
[Laughter]
16:18
ah that's a great fact you know what i
16:20
think that i think the chinese are doing
16:22
with the with the harry potter thing
16:23
this is just coincidentally i was
16:25
reading a bit of an interview yesterday
16:26
with this woman who decided to translate
16:28
finnegan's wake which is like james
16:30
joyce is
16:31
more dense than ulysses work and she's
16:34
taken i think seven years to translate
16:36
the first third of it into mandarin and
16:38
there's been quite a best seller in
16:39
china and they love it but there's a
16:40
little clip of her saying i don't this
16:42
is so hard please stop pressing me i
16:44
just don't know if i can write the rest
16:46
of it i don't know if i can translate
16:47
the rest right now so the chinese are
16:49
used to having what we've got a third of
16:51
finnegan's weight we love it when's the
16:53
next installment
16:56
[Applause]
17:00
okay time to move on to fact number
17:02
three which is yours james
17:05
okay yeah my fact is that according to
17:08
the um government's website of the czech
17:10
republic um there are three symbols of
17:13
easter
17:14
in the czech republic they are easter
17:17
eggs the easter lam
17:19
and whipping
17:24
i really want to do that
17:28
no so this is a tradition that is
17:30
happens every easter monday in the czech
17:32
republic and boys young lads would go
17:35
around
17:36
whipping
17:37
young maids so that they are healthy and
17:39
cheerful for the entire year to come
17:42
and the girls
17:44
for as a reward for being whipped they
17:46
give their boys uh decorated easter eggs
17:48
called kraslitzi because they're so
17:50
grateful for being whipped yeah cool
17:53
apparently anyone visiting the country
17:54
is a bit concerned when they see it
17:56
because one of the things i like to do
17:58
uh is to chase the women that's right
18:01
around with these whips
18:03
while they run away um apparently
18:05
everyone loves it so yeah yeah these
18:08
whips they're like very beautiful as
18:10
like pieces of willow with ribbons on so
18:12
they're not like a you know it's not
18:14
like a leather
18:15
yeah nine tails kind of thing
18:18
but yeah i i really love that um just
18:21
i like to look at traditions that are
18:22
going on around the world there's loads
18:24
of really cool stuff happening around
18:26
easter because often as well as it being
18:28
like a catholic feast it was
18:30
traditionally like a pagan time of year
18:33
you know it's the it's a rebirth of
18:35
things so there's all stars going on
18:37
apparently in norway i was reading this
18:39
i don't know if this is true but um most
18:41
of the major television stations of
18:43
rister show murder mystery shows and
18:45
that's all they show because it's become
18:47
a tradition that you watch murder
18:48
mysteries in norway oh really okay and
18:51
in the philippines some christians will
18:53
um
18:54
because they want to associate
18:56
themselves with jesus they will um
18:58
crucify themselves they'll nail
19:00
themselves onto a cross and be fr self
19:03
and be flagellated and uh very painful
19:06
but there there's a lot of people around
19:07
so that they don't not through they nail
19:09
themselves through the hands yep right
19:12
mental
19:13
so here's another thing about whipping
19:15
yeah do you know about these guys called
19:16
flatulence uh for the black death
19:19
um they would whip them they would go to
19:21
towns where they were struggling with
19:23
the plague and they would whip
19:25
themselves for a fee to bring god's
19:27
favor onto a community
19:29
and the idea was they would um like hurt
19:32
themselves and that would somehow um get
19:34
god's favor and he would get rid of the
19:36
plague it's a nice idea yeah that's a
19:38
good paid for it was that big because i
19:40
i the only reference point i have to
19:42
that is the da vinci code where
19:44
the evil guy in that whips himself
19:46
consistently oh it's the same yeah yeah
19:49
um and but at the same time apparently
19:52
there was another group called the
19:53
pseudo-flatulence and they also went
19:55
around europe and they would also get
19:57
money uh but instead of hitting
19:58
themselves with whips they preferred
20:00
performed unusual sexual acts in public
20:04
and it doesn't explain what unusual
20:06
sexual acts are
20:08
but you just know it's more fun than
20:09
whipping yourself yeah it is more fun
20:12
and also it's hard to imagine god would
20:14
be looking down at this and going yep
20:16
those are the guys
20:17
hold on
20:18
i like weird um weird traditions i guess
20:21
our traditions must look weird to
20:23
outsiders as well but um in
20:25
garvel you'll probably know this james
20:27
which i think has got i think it's in
20:29
sweden um they've had this tradition
20:30
since 1966 where the um a town council
20:33
built a 13 meter tall goat figure to
20:35
celebrate christmas made of straw
20:37
and vandals burned it down on christmas
20:39
eve and now it's become tradition so the
20:42
council is pretty pissed off about that
20:43
didn't want vandals to do this um but
20:45
now it's become tradition they've
20:46
maintained this 13 meter tall figure and
20:49
almost every year vandals keep burning
20:51
it down and there's this constant like
20:52
tug of war in this little town the
20:54
christmas tradition the burning of the
20:55
garvel goat happens and i think it's
20:57
happened 26 times since 1966 and since
21:01
the 1980s and english bookmakers um
21:03
allows you to place bets on the goat's
21:05
survival which you like to bet james i
21:07
can imagine you should do that um just
21:10
stop building it out of straw maybe
21:11
something less flammable if they really
21:12
yeah not so smart yeah
21:15
i was uh i was when i was looking into
21:17
the whipping i suddenly realized i
21:19
didn't know much about whipping and i i
21:20
wanted to find out more and um
21:23
i this was a surprising thing uh i read
21:25
about a guy who had not heard from in
21:27
history called whipping tom has anyone
21:28
heard of whipping tom no it sounds
21:30
familiar but no okay it was an attacker
21:32
in london uh lived near hackney
21:35
um who would uh attack women uh walking
21:38
in the street he never he never did
21:40
anything to the point of actually
21:41
killing any of them but he was just uh
21:44
he was just whipping them he would he
21:45
would approach them unaccompanied women
21:47
in alleys and courtyards and he would
21:49
just spank them on the butt with his
21:51
whip
21:52
[Laughter]
21:55
nobody
21:56
my favorite thing about it is they did
21:58
eventually capture the person and then
22:00
there was a copycat whipping tom who
22:01
appeared a few years later but the
22:03
description of him and i know it's you
22:05
know obviously this was distressing for
22:07
women but you know it's it's the 1600s
22:10
we can laugh about it he would he would
22:13
see uh he would wait in narrow and dimly
22:15
lit alleys and courtyards and upon
22:17
seeing unaccompanied women he would grab
22:19
them lift their dress and slap their
22:21
buttocks repeatedly before fleeing he
22:24
would sometimes accompany his attacks by
22:26
shouting spanko
22:30
he sounds like a superhero
22:35
so yeah in czechoslovakia he would have
22:36
been a superhero that would have been a
22:37
really good thing for him to be doing
22:38
right because the ladies love it there
22:39
yeah they would have been like where's
22:41
where's spanker
22:43
[Applause]
22:47
okay uh time for our final fact of the
22:51
show uh anna this one's yours yeah um so
22:54
my fact is that at earl's court tube
22:56
station in 1911 a one-legged man was
22:59
employed to ride the escalator
23:01
ah this is bumper harris this is bomber
23:04
harris yeah um and he was employed to
23:07
ride the escalator it was the first
23:08
escalator that had been installed on the
23:09
london underground and you know like
23:11
people were always really scared of new
23:12
inventions so commonplace they seem to
23:14
us and so he was employed by the um
23:18
department of transport to ride up and
23:19
down the escalator and show people that
23:21
it was safe and i think the idea was
23:23
like even a one legged man can get up
23:25
and down this safely so you're probably
23:27
gonna be fine guys did he was he
23:29
one-legged or did he have um a
23:31
prosthetic i think he had a prosthetic
23:32
leg um although weirdly in the first
23:35
week that the um escalator was installed
23:37
nine dresses were torn one finger was
23:39
pinched and one lame passenger fell off
23:41
his crutch so apparently not that
23:43
suitable well they weren't they weren't
23:45
as um in their early days escalators
23:47
weren't as
23:49
for example there wasn't a side hand
23:51
rail that you could hold that would go
23:52
down with you and so on so there were
23:54
there were a lot of they were a lot more
23:56
harsh well yeah
23:57
it wasn't the first escalation in uk and
23:59
harrods yeah that's right they used to
24:00
have someone standing at the top with a
24:02
bottle of brandy to give people all the
24:03
shots to come brandy and smelling that
24:05
ordeal really yeah 1920s they had a
24:08
system in uh they designed a system for
24:10
atlanta um and they had walkways that
24:13
would go at six miles an hour it's not
24:14
that fast it was kind of fast you know
24:16
uh and the idea was that you would have
24:18
a walkway that went at six miles an hour
24:20
and then next to that you would have one
24:21
at four miles an hour so you would only
24:23
have a two two miles an hour jump to go
24:25
from one to the other next to that would
24:27
be a moving walkway of two miles an hour
24:29
and next to that would be a moving
24:30
walkway which didn't move
24:32
that's sensible kind of a walkway
24:35
yeah
24:36
but that that never
24:37
took off because uh basically cars came
24:40
in around the same time and so they
24:42
didn't need them anymore i think they
24:43
installed a similar system though in
24:45
paris i find it weird how long it took
24:46
them by the way to put stairs on
24:48
escalators because um for like 20 years
24:50
they had um travelators which were just
24:52
slopes upwards but anyway i think they
24:54
had what you're describing in paris um
24:56
they had it was
24:57
about a mile long i think in 1900
25:00
um and it was two moving walkways going
25:02
at different paces and anyway thomas
25:03
edison turned up there so he seemed to
25:05
be everywhere around this time doing his
25:07
thing and he was really impressed with
25:08
it and he decided to film it and the
25:10
footage so i watched the footage of him
25:12
filming this walkway in paris and
25:13
everyone's really excited by it because
25:14
it's a new innovation and there's a
25:16
moment in the footage and i'll put it on
25:18
the website page where a man just
25:19
appears from the crowd and punches a boy
25:22
in the face
25:23
what i'll put it on the website spanker
25:25
when he's done
25:29
it's so weird
25:31
before the earls caught um the first
25:33
escalator oils court i didn't realize
25:35
that they had they installed this spiral
25:37
escalator in the 1880s or spiral
25:39
elevator i think they called it at the
25:41
time and it was really just meant to be
25:42
like a scenic ride um and so it was
25:45
meant to simulate being in france in the
25:48
middle of the mountains and so you went
25:49
up this spiral which was i can't
25:51
remember how many meters high but pretty
25:53
high went up and up and then you were
25:55
surrounded by these um vistas panoramas
25:57
of beautiful mountains where was that
26:00
possible
26:01
oh was it yeah okay because the first
26:02
ever escalator was in coney island and
26:05
that was also um an amusement rather
26:07
than anything else it was just a ride
26:09
but um there was 75 000 people rode it
26:12
in the first two weeks this amazing ride
26:14
of standing on an escalator
26:17
um i was i was reading into
26:19
just i got i got interested in other
26:21
sort of debuts at uh with the
26:24
underground oh yeah just to see if there
26:26
are any notable written about stories
26:28
and um there's a great one for the
26:30
opening of the circle line which was in
26:32
1884 yeah and this was the review from
26:35
the times newspaper which said a form of
26:38
mild torture which no person would
26:41
undergo if he could conveniently help it
26:44
first
26:46
when the tube first opened um there was
26:48
a guy who spent a lot of time in kenya
26:51
rode on it and he described the smell as
26:53
being like a crocodile's breath
26:56
yeah that's a terrible smell well
26:58
presumably i don't know it's kind of
27:00
nice for people to experience you're
27:01
never going to meet a crocodile in real
27:03
life
27:04
but you just go on turn it into a
27:05
positive yeah crocodile's breath after
27:07
it's just eaten a pig
27:08
[Laughter]
27:10
i like so how frightened people are of
27:13
new inventions and always have been in
27:15
history and how totally mental it seems
27:17
to us now like that obviously everyone
27:19
had of trains didn't they um that so i
27:22
think when stevenson was trying to like
27:24
encourage investment in his whole
27:26
railway idea um then the parliament a
27:29
lot of mps were already really against
27:30
it and it was thought that he so he
27:32
intended for trains to be going between
27:33
12 and 15 miles an hour and he was
27:35
advised beforehand definitely not to
27:37
claim in the house of commons that they
27:38
would go above nine because that would
27:40
totally freak people out um and then one
27:42
of those one of the mps asks asks him in
27:44
parliament suppose one of these engines
27:46
to be going along at a rate of nine or
27:48
ten miles an hour and a cow were to
27:50
stray up on the line would that not be a
27:52
very awkward circumstance
27:54
and he just he just said
27:56
yes very awkward for the cow and that
27:59
was it
28:03
i also like um this sorry this is my
28:05
final um
28:06
inventions thing um i like that people
28:08
were really frightened of bicycles quite
28:10
anti-bicycles um when they first came in
28:12
from like the 1860s onwards i guess and
28:15
doctors warned about things like bicycle
28:17
hernia bicycle
28:20
bicycle
28:21
uh cyclist neurosis cyclist sore throat
28:25
and bicycle face
28:28
i mean someone on a bicycle rides into
28:30
your face
28:32
you would have thought but actually it
28:33
meant that you're gonna have such a
28:35
constant look of stress on your face
28:37
from having to balance your bike that
28:38
it's gonna get stuck like that and
28:40
you're gonna be permanently twisted like
28:41
getting square eyes from watching
28:43
exactly
28:45
um just going back to uh bumper harris
28:47
so it was slightly controversial when we
28:49
first read about this quite a few years
28:51
ago yeah um
28:53
matt howard who's one of the qi
28:55
researchers reckons that it might be a
28:56
myth because he couldn't find any
28:58
evidence um contemporaries uh news
29:01
reports mentioning bumper harris yeah
29:03
um so i think i think there are news
29:05
reports from the time but they don't
29:07
give evidence as to like who he was
29:09
where you could find him like they don't
29:11
have evidence from the transport because
29:12
you would think that it would be the
29:13
kind of thing they would mention they
29:15
would have recorded well yeah i feel
29:16
like we disagree on this but maybe i
29:18
like to believe in room so it was it was
29:20
recorded from the early 1920s and there
29:22
is a guy who says that he's bomber
29:24
harris's great grandson who's called
29:26
aaron who can give like who gives
29:27
anecdotal evidence about how he he
29:30
apparently retired so he says um he
29:31
eventually retired to make cider violins
29:34
and become a watercolor artist
29:36
so with that kind of personal detail
29:37
james i don't know how you can thwart
29:39
this story i would love to if anyone
29:41
like listening by any chance knows
29:43
anyone who claims to be related to
29:44
bumper harris i would love to know if it
29:46
is true yeah i'm so get in touch
29:49
[Applause]
29:52
okay that's it for another episode
29:53

we're gonna have videos of men punching
30:23
boys on travelators uh we're gonna have
30:26
all sorts of other pictures and links to

=9
00:00
we run it on qi a few years ago yeah um
00:02
which was
00:03
there's no such thing as a fish there's
00:04
no such thing as a fish no seriously
00:06
it's in
00:06
the oxford dictionary of underwater life
00:10
it says it right there first paragraph
00:11
no such thing as a fish
00:17
[Applause]
00:17
[Music]
00:22
hello and welcome to another edition of
00:24
no such thing as a fish
00:26
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
00:28
qi offices in covent garden
00:30
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
00:31
here with three other qils james harkin
00:34
anna chazinski and andy murray
00:36
and once again we've gathered around the
00:37
microphones to share our favorite facts
00:39
from the last seven days so
00:41
in no particular order here we go
00:47
james let's begin with you okay yeah my
00:50
fact this week is
00:51
it was fashionable in new york at the
00:53
end of the 19th century
00:55
for ladies to wear live lizards as
00:57
broaches wow nice
00:58
with a pin on them well actually with a
01:00
small leash it seems
01:02
this was in an article in the archive of
01:04
the new york times about the rspca
01:07
um complaining about it unsurprising
01:09
yeah i mean
01:10
let me read you a few little bits the
01:12
lizards have been sold as chameleons
01:14
they were fastened to cushions by means
01:17
of tiny collars and chains
01:19
and they have become quite a play thing
01:20
with many people
01:22
sometimes they were worn in the streets
01:23
by women who had them attached to their
01:25
bodices it doesn't really give any more
01:27
information than that
01:28
and was this popular was it did a lot of
01:30
people do it i imagine it didn't last
01:31
for very long
01:32
because the rspca and the new york times
01:34
got involved are there any other animals
01:36
that we've yes known to have worn yes
01:39
which
01:39
really recently maybe you saw this as
01:41
well and i don't really know why i don't
01:42
remember this apparently in 2006 there
01:44
was a fashion designer who
01:46
designed cockroach brooches i think
01:48
mainly because of the rhyming thing
01:50
but they became quite a popular thing
01:51
and there was a live cockroach on
01:52
approach
01:53
and they said they were decorated with
01:55
like ornate jewelry and painted golden
01:57
stuff and apparently they could last for
01:58
up to a year
01:59
um and they just crawl around you i
02:01
think paris hilton got one women used to
02:03
keep their
02:03
small pets in their muffs they would
02:05
decorate their muffs with jewels
02:07
and um they would put pets in there and
02:09
some for a while it was like a status
02:11
symbol the larger your muff was the more
02:13
rich you were
02:14
so if you if you get like a horse in
02:15
there a 16 hander
02:17
then you know that's impressive people
02:19
are going she must be a princess or
02:21
something
02:22
she has a muff that fits a horse and
02:24
people would be impressed yes
02:26
there was another live animal that
02:29
people used
02:30
apparently in the middle ages one
02:31
recommended cure for the plague was
02:33
strapping a live
02:34
chicken around the buboes on your body
02:38
oh yeah that work nope no no that's why
02:41
a third of europe died
02:44
um i find that amazing they used to
02:46
think that if you got bitten by
02:48
by a snake that if you um put a live
02:50
pigeon
02:51
on the bite at the bottom of a pigeon it
02:54
would suck out the uh venom
02:56
that's right yeah and you would you
02:57
would consistently use more and more
02:58
pigeons until
02:59
the final anus sucking pigeon didn't die
03:03
and then you knew you got the poison out
03:04
i have a very dim memory of people in
03:06
china a thousand or so years ago keeping
03:09
something a little insect in a cage
03:12
around their necks
03:13
okay which had drunk their lovers blood
03:15
yeah that would happen in europe
03:16
with fleas fleas that's it but i can't
03:18
imagine a
03:20
cage small enough to keep a flea in and
03:21
stop it from escaping there's a poem by
03:23
john duncan called the flea which is
03:24
talking about how you know the fleas
03:26
bitten her now it's bitten him and he's
03:28
saying oh in that romantic
03:29
you know it's got it's got both of us
03:30
mingled in it
03:32
it's a good poem they all died of the
03:34
plague soon after that
03:37
which isn't caused by rats again right i
03:39
know this always comes around well just
03:41
on that subject of rats and you know us
03:43
wearing lizards
03:44
um there's a nice little mouse that
03:46
we've been giving back to
03:47
uh which is a mouse that's going kind of
03:49
it's on the endangered list
03:51
um and all the used balls from wimbledon
03:54
have been donated
03:55
as little houses for these mice that's
03:57
very nice yeah
03:59
eurasian harvest mice that's it yeah
04:01
it's so sweet
04:02
we should put a picture of on the
04:02
website of them in these little homes i
04:04
thought you were gonna say the reverse
04:06
of the
04:06
lizard thing is there's an animal that's
04:08
been wearing
04:10
a human in some way is that what horses
04:13
claim they're doing
04:15
look at my credit accessory guys yeah
04:17
the fashion for humans in tight trousers
04:19
and long boots remains
04:21
i do really like the origin of fashions
04:23
that are quite normal though
04:24
like i didn't know do you know how
04:25
people used to wear wigs from the 17th
04:27
century until the 19th century
04:29
that was because louis the 13th had male
04:32
pattern boldness
04:33
and so he insisted on wearing wigs all
04:35
the time to conceal that
04:36
they used to wear really massive wigs
04:38
and they like really ridiculous with
04:40
things in the wigs like
04:42
a ship in full sail or a windmill with
04:44
farm animals around it and this massive
04:46
wig yeah sometimes they would if there
04:49
was something would happen in the
04:50
in the news they would wear a wig which
04:52
reflected what was happening in the news
04:54
at the time
04:55
no yeah and also they were quite
04:58
expensive these wigs like if you got a
04:59
really
05:00
good one they were they were really
05:01
status symbols
05:03
and um wig theft became a bit of a
05:05
problem and what they would have is you
05:07
would walk across
05:08
if you were a thief you walk across with
05:09
a basket
05:11
and there'd be a young child inside the
05:12
basket and then you would distract him
05:14
for some reason then the child would pop
05:16
out grab the wig
05:17
pop back in into the basket and you'd
05:19
run off oh how many of those awkward
05:21
moments were there from cartoons where
05:22
the children grab someone's hair and it
05:24
turned out not to be a wig
05:25
and then and people going that's
05:28
definitely my mates hindenburg crash
05:30
that you're wearing on your head well
05:32
we're on wig theft
05:33
someone a lot of people in the 1910s and
05:36
1920s there were bands on people bobbing
05:37
their hair
05:38
whether that was locally enforced there
05:40
weren't any governmental bans on it but
05:41
it was very discouraged it was seen as
05:43
being far too racy
05:44
and at least one girl blamed her haircut
05:46
on what they called jack the clipper
05:48
as in someone someone just leaned out
05:50
and shot my hair
05:51
so a girl in the bronx said that a
05:52
highwayman had grabbed her and cut her
05:54
hair off that sounds like someone
05:56
where they thought of the name of the
05:57
criminal before
06:01
just speaking of things that banned one
06:03
of my all-time favorite qi facts this
06:05
is just a sentence in 1367 the french
06:08
king charles v
06:09
prohibited the wearing of shoes shaped
06:11
like penises
06:14
presumably because they were
06:15
uncomfortable
06:17
what happened was they were the front of
06:19
the shoe would go very long
06:21
and then they got longer and longer and
06:23
longer and then they got more sticky up
06:24
and more sticky uppy because it
06:26
became more fashionable and then people
06:28
thought oh something long and sticky
06:30
uppy why don't we make it into a penis
06:32
and they did that and then they had to
06:33
ban it it's just one of my all-time
06:34
favorite facts
06:35
lady gaga would not have fit in in that
06:37
chord
06:46
okay time for fact number two this one's
06:48
mine
06:49
my fact this week is that the great code
06:52
breaker
06:52
alan turing lost his buried treasure
06:55
when he couldn't crack his own code
06:58
so alan shuring um for those i guess who
07:02
don't quite know who he is yeah he is a
07:04
great mathematician and co-breaker from
07:06
bletchley park
07:07
and he was very instrumental in helping
07:09
to crack things like the enigma codes
07:11
and isn't he the
07:12
he's known as the father of modern
07:14
computing yeah the turing test
07:16
the turing test is named after him yeah
07:18
so this is what happened this was in
07:19
1940 alan turing
07:21
got really scared of a potential german
07:23
invasion
07:24
so he converted all of his life savings
07:26
into two bars of silver
07:28
which at the time worth about 250 pounds
07:31
he wheeled them
07:32
to some woods near schenley uh and he
07:34
buried them both
07:35
uh under the forest floor one of them
07:37
under the forest floor one under a
07:38
bridge
07:39
uh by a bit of a stream he then made a
07:41
code of where he buried it and then he
07:43
made a code of the code
07:45
and no one knows exactly how many codes
07:46
of the codes of the codes that he made
07:47
but he made a number
07:49
so no because i imagine it would be
07:52
x marks the spot x equals y
07:56
yeah so five years later
07:59
he returns with a metal detector in hand
08:01
and he goes to where
08:03
he buried them and he couldn't crack his
08:05
own codes
08:06
and he kept trying and kept trying and
08:07
kept trying he did three expeditions to
08:09
try and find his buried treasure and
08:11
each time
08:12
he couldn't do it and on top of it in
08:14
those five years the landscape had
08:15
changed someone had
08:17
knocked down the bridge where he put it
08:19
near the bed of the stream and so
08:21
he never found it and so unless someone
08:24
has found it and not told anyone about
08:25
it
08:26
alan turing's silver horde is still
08:28
buried somewhere in shenley
08:29
but we don't know what his code was to
08:30
we it was probably like yeah look at
08:32
this bridge and there's a poppy field
08:34
to your left and i think the man who
08:36
helped crack the enigma code probably
08:38
something a bit more complex though four
08:41
hops towards the left
08:42
when you reach the beach it was a double
08:43
bluff
08:46
three rolly pollies forward so simple
08:48
it's complicated that's actually
08:50
also how he cracked the enigma code in
08:51
the first
08:53
so do you know who if you find treasure
08:55
in the uk do you know who you reported
08:56
to
08:56
the local coroner wow so all he does is
08:59
uh gets dead bodies and treasure
09:00
reported to him you know what you'd be
09:02
hoping for don't you yeah
09:04
in france you can't metal detect without
09:06
a license to do so
09:08
much stricter on it than we are so i
09:10
don't know whether that means there's
09:11
much more buried treasure in france just
09:12
because there aren't
09:13
enthusiastic amateurs going around the
09:15
country and just seeing what they can
09:16
find
09:17
because something like 90 of treasure in
09:19
the uk is found by people with metal
09:20
detectors just amateurs i think
09:22
do you know how many coins you have to
09:23
find for it to qualify as like a horde
09:25
you know like he's just like a real
09:26
hoarder
09:27
he's got a whole lot of 100. i reckon
09:29
not many i reckon 20. yeah it's two
09:32
two as long as a horde as long as
09:34
they're at least 10
09:35
um precious metal wait wait two coins
09:37
i've got several hordes in my wallet
09:39
then that's brilliant
09:40
well they have to be 300 years old at
09:41
least sorry i'm very thrifty so
09:45
and very old so are you allowed to keep
09:48
a coin but you're not allowed to keep a
09:49
[ __ ] do you then have to reach yeah
09:51
yeah couldn't you just say oh i found a
09:52
coin then you know walk away from it
09:54
then walk back oh
09:55
another one
09:58
that is such a great idea i found a coin
10:01
50 times they're gonna have to rewrite
10:04
the law
10:06
there's a great story of a book that was
10:09
published in 1979 in england it was kind
10:11
of
10:11
the world's first global treasure hunt
10:14
and it was a book
10:15
called the masquerade by kit williams
10:18
it's only about 20 pages and it's all
10:20
illustrations
10:22
and the story doesn't really matter it's
10:23
the fact that in every single page
10:25
there's hidden codes to the location
10:29
of what the boy finds at the end of the
10:30
story book which is this golden
10:32
masquerade hair
10:33
and kit williams buried it somewhere in
10:34
the world he didn't say where
10:36
and it's if you crack the code of the
10:38
book you would find the masquerade hair
10:40
did anyone find it someone eventually
10:41
did but it really um it really made
10:43
people go insane in the search for it
10:45
because they became obsessed with them
10:46
they
10:46
it was it was a really really hard code
10:49
to crack um people
10:50
actually were um sectioned for
10:52
psychiatric help
10:53
because they were so obsessed and they
10:55
were they were just uh yeah not getting
10:56
to and unfortunately
10:58
the code was cracked by a couple and
11:00
they wrote the letter to kit williams to
11:01
say that we'd found it
11:02
and the day before that letter had
11:04
arrived a neighboring person
11:06
came to the house and said kit i've got
11:08
the answer i know where it is
11:09
and then uh dug it up but they were told
11:13
by one of kit williams friends the
11:14
location so they cheated in order to get
11:16
it
11:17
so he told his friends the location
11:19
somehow he must have slipped in the pub
11:21
or something i don't know what it was ah
11:23
damn it yeah the person who did find it
11:25
um
11:26
then tried to replicate the experience
11:28
with a computer game but
11:29
um it became so expensive to make it and
11:32
no one understood it once it came out
11:34
that the company went bankrupt and he
11:35
had to put the masquerade hair itself up
11:37
for auction
11:38
it went up for auction in sotheby's it
11:39
was bought by an anonymous bidder and
11:41
since it was bought 30 something odd
11:43
years ago
11:44
no one knows its location currently yeah
11:47
so it's still out there yeah get that
11:50
car in there yeah
11:53
just talking about lost things people
11:55
always lose their pin codes on their
11:56
credit cards and whatever that happens
11:58
all the time and um i saw an article
12:00
in the independent from 1996 which
12:02
thought that in the future
12:03
instead of pin codes people would use
12:05
their fingerprints
12:07
um to say who they are when they put
12:09
their credit card in people obviously a
12:11
little bit a little bit worried about
12:12
whether that would work or not and so um
12:14
they managed to stop any worry by saying
12:17
a similar program in south africa
12:19
which distributes payments to 450 000
12:21
pensioners
12:22
has resulted in only one attempt to use
12:25
an amputated finger
12:26
in more than six years so that sounds
12:29
pretty safe
12:30
wow that's just the one they found out
12:32
about presumably i mean how many people
12:34
with amputated fingers are they're
12:36
buried and someone's done true
12:37
when they had the when they had the
12:39
lineup they were like point to the guy
12:40
who did this
12:46
okay time for fact number three and uh
12:49
we're gonna do
12:50
you anna uh yeah my fact is that in 2011
12:54
the largest sperm bank in the world
12:56
stopped accepting sperm from redheads
13:01
well you know it was a supply and demand
13:02
issue i think it was it was cryos
13:04
international sperm bank in denmark
13:06
um i think denmark calls itself the
13:08
sperm capital of the world
13:09
um because is that when you arrive at
13:12
the airport
13:15
they're very proud of it everyone in
13:17
denmark whenever they answer phone has
13:18
to say
13:19
welcome to denmark sperm capital of the
13:21
world that's true so what's the sperm
13:22
bank capital
13:23
sperm bank capital yeah i don't think
13:25
they just have really well invested in
13:26
the sperm building society i think it's
13:27
more ethical
13:29
there's a lovely fact of uh just the
13:31
idea of having that logo on at the
13:33
airport uh that in scotland
13:35
they spent the tourism boards spent
13:37
hundreds of thousands of pounds trying
13:39
to re-find
13:40
a great slogan to arrive to for all of
13:42
scotland and
13:43
after brainstorms that lasted for
13:45
however long hundreds of thousands of
13:47
pounds
13:47
they arrived at welcome to scotland
13:50
that's the oldies of the goodies aren't
13:52
they yeah
13:52
sorry anna go on yeah so there's a quote
13:54
from ali shu
13:56
and he says uh there there are too many
13:57
so he runs the sperm back in denmark
14:00
cryos international sperm bank and he
14:01
said there are too many redheads in
14:02
relation to demand
14:04
i do not think you choose a redhead
14:06
unless the partner for example this
14:07
sterile male
14:08
has red hair or because the lone woman
14:10
has a preference for redheads
14:12
and that's perhaps not so many
14:14
especially in the latter case um
14:16
anyway it's obviously not fair because
14:17
um there's there's absolutely nothing
14:19
wrong with redheads just want to make
14:20
that clear
14:21
as the qi view and it also he also
14:24
stopped accepting olly shu
14:26
um stopped accepting donations from a
14:28
lot of scandinavians as well because
14:30
they um export a lot of their sperm
14:33
internationally and there's not
14:34
so people like to have children that
14:36
kind of look like them that's
14:37
wow what a weird way of making your
14:39
country bigger on the global map 10 of
14:41
their sperm go to britain in fact and he
14:42
just wraps them up and the little
14:44
package
14:44
sends them you can receive it in the
14:45
post and then you can like you can
14:47
it's all diy order it online really what
14:50
so it comes refrigerated or
14:51
yeah yeah what customers just sort of
14:53
wave it through i believe so
14:54
wow yeah so it's not
14:58
[Laughter]
15:02
unfortunately this was in 2011 there
15:04
were lots of officials trying to
15:05
establish a sperm bank for elephants
15:07
in north america because there aren't
15:09
enough elephants and they're going to
15:10
start becoming uh
15:12
too closely related to each other and
15:14
weaken the gene pool um
15:16
so 16 liters of elephant semen were
15:19
being kept
15:20
in south african export office because
15:23
american import
15:24
had no idea what to classify it as
15:26
there's a lot of bureaucracy in the usa
15:28
so it was just kept waiting there frozen
15:30
in limbo
15:31
for ages and i think it might still be
15:33
there
15:35
that was and that was three years ago so
15:37
there's 16 liters of semen waiting
15:39
somewhere
15:40
as part of project frozen dumbo
15:41
[Laughter]
15:45
shouldn't have declared should have just
15:47
gone through customs
15:50
no over 100 mills very tricky you'd have
15:52
to have a lot of tiny bottles of shampoo
15:55
do you guys think that 90 percent of
15:56
your sperm has deformed you three
15:58
specifically
15:59
i told that all the time
16:03
what do you mean i didn't know that
16:04
ninety percent of men's human sperm has
16:06
like either two heads or two tails or
16:08
multiple heads and tails
16:09
or like a coiled tail or broken tail so
16:11
you mean superheroes
16:14
yeah yeah okay superhuman but a lot of
16:17
these men
16:17
actually get the clip so they can't have
16:20
babies um
16:21
by a notorious villain known as jack the
16:23
sniffer
16:26
he's killing the superheroes before
16:27
they're born
16:29
for me when i hear the word redheads as
16:32
an australian i immediately think of our
16:34
matches because in australia that's the
16:37
leading brand of matches
16:38
they're called redheads redheads were
16:40
originally made in australia
16:42
but then they got um they got outsourced
16:44
to sweden
16:45
and so they were no longer an australian
16:47
product and we have a guy in australia
16:48
called dick smith and he runs
16:50
dick smith's electronics dick smith's
16:52
foods and
16:54
he's kind of australia's richard branson
16:56
and um he decided that he wasn't going
16:58
to allow redheads
16:59
to become the leading brand of
17:01
australian matches so he created his own
17:03
brand which you can buy in shops i think
17:04
you can still buy them and they're
17:05
called [ __ ]
17:07
um because dick smith [ __ ] and
17:10
[ __ ] became
17:11
a hugely popular product in australia
17:13
that reminds me a little bit of
17:15
do you know about redhead day in the
17:18
netherlands
17:19
it's a summer festival it takes place
17:21
each first weekend of september in the
17:23
city of breda
17:24
and all the redheads from around the
17:26
world come along and have fun and
17:28
party it's very popular uh but for the
17:32
first few years it wasn't so popular
17:33
because it clashed with a local pumpkin
17:35
contest but now it's orange to choose
17:39
what they're doing why do redheads get
17:41
such a hard time i've never understood
17:43
neither have i i always wanted to be
17:44
redheaded yeah which means you're
17:45
special
17:46
yeah the irish like redheads there's a
17:48
high demand still for redheads
17:50
amongst the irish they're still asking
17:51
for it apparently very popular in
17:53
germany as well there was a sex
17:55
researcher called professor dr verna
17:57
habermel and he said the sex lives of
18:00
women with red hair
18:01
is clearly more active than those with
18:03
other hair color with more partners and
18:05
having sex more often than the average
18:07
i find it quite interesting that um the
18:10
human sperm cell is the
18:12
smallest cell in the human body um and a
18:14
lot of people know the the
18:15
the egg the female egg is one of just
18:17
the largest i think
18:18
but a blue whale sperm is only a very
18:21
tiny amount longer
18:23
than a human's one oh it's interesting
18:25
so it's completely
18:26
different by species yeah it's totally
18:29
random
18:30
i don't know people i don't think people
18:31
know why they certainly don't know why
18:32
the fruit fly sperm is so big and
18:34
yeah why have a small sperm or a bigfoot
18:36
several times as long as the actual
18:37
fruit fly isn't 20 times
18:38
20 times long although i couldn't work
18:40
out work this out so the average
18:42
male ejaculate is half a teaspoon
18:45
um and that's where the bank is that's
18:48
where the bank got it
18:48
from really really i didn't know that
18:50
brackets i haven't also heard of the
18:52
band
18:52
[Music]
18:54
it contains 200 million sperm if you
18:56
lined up all the sperm in one ejaculate
18:59
it would stretch
18:59
six miles so you like you managed to get
19:02
your sperm into one line
19:03
it's six miles long isn't it i don't
19:04
know if you ask them all to queue up
19:07
yeah you need a spatula or something you
19:10
with two heads to the back
19:13
the man who first discovered the man who
19:14
first saw sperm under
19:16
a microscope who was called van
19:18
leeuwenhoek
19:19
uh so he discovered them in 1677. he was
19:22
very clear whenever he wrote about it or
19:24
spoke about that the sperm that i found
19:26
were
19:26
not obtained by any sinful contrivance
19:29
on my part but with the excess which
19:30
nature provided me in conjugal relations
19:33
one thing i found is that it takes five
19:36
people to get semen out of a vulture
19:40
right is that through first-hand
19:41
experience
19:43
i've got bad news for you andy there's
19:44
only four of us
19:47
what am i gonna do with this guy
19:51
no one person takes the limbs one takes
19:52
the head one takes the wings a fourth
19:54
person massages it back
19:55
so after the massage the bird gets
19:57
aroused and then it's uh cloaca appears
19:59
which is like
20:00
the sexual opening that most birds have
20:02
and then so the fourth person then grabs
20:03
the cloaker
20:05
between thumb and index finger at which
20:07
point the fifth person
20:08
collects the semen in a glass funnel or
20:11
receptacle of their choice
20:12
it doesn't you know it doesn't matter
20:14
once you've gone to that much effort
20:15
though you may as well get a glass
20:16
funnel
20:17
and that's the stag night over
20:24
okay uh final fact of the show and we
20:27
head over to
20:28
andy murray my fact is that the english
20:30
language has more words borrowed from
20:32
hawaiian than it has from welsh
20:35
which is surprising yeah because it's
20:37
quite a long way away very long way away
20:39
yeah whereas wales is quite close almost
20:42
next door
20:42
yeah so let me think so maybe that is
20:46
because
20:47
um things in hawaii are more unusual to
20:50
us
20:50
uh things that are in wales we just use
20:52
the english words for well
20:53
possibly but there seems to be a theory
20:56
that it's actually snobbery
20:58
that it was it was anglo-saxon snobbery
20:59
that repressed the welsh language and it
21:01
was it was suppressed for a while for a
21:03
long time in the 19th century um
21:04
so this is a claim made by dr philip
21:07
durkin who's the author of
21:08
borrowed words and he's also the deputy
21:10
editor of the oed so he knows his stuff
21:12
and he's ranked a lot of different
21:13
languages in terms of how many words
21:15
from them have ended up in the oed uh
21:17
and latin comes first and french comes
21:19
second
21:20
um but hawaiian uh manages to beat welsh
21:24
as does turkish and icelandic hawaiian
21:26
words that we have include things like
21:27
hula hoop from hulu uh ukulele aloha and
21:32
wiki
21:32
which means quickly so wikipedia is if
21:35
you um go to hawaii i've been to hawaii
21:37
and if you get a bus from the airport to
21:39
wherever you need to go they're called
21:40
wiki wiki buses
21:42
because they're quaint there's a bunch
21:44
of words that uh
21:45
i think someone recently wrote a book on
21:46
was that the english language used to
21:47
have that we should bring back but the
21:48
only one that springs to mind is
21:51
fizzle which used to mean in the 15th
21:54
and 16th centuries
21:55
uh it was a verb it meant to break wind
21:57
without making a noise
21:58
which we don't have anymore but
21:59
apparently yeah fizzle is where we get
22:02
the word feisty from
22:03
andy you you actually have invented
22:06
new words haven't you for you were one
22:08
of the kind of silent
22:09
authors of uh the new meaning of the
22:12
lyft book
22:13
it was a book that what was it andy it's
22:15
a book that it's a book of things that
22:16
there should be words for but aren't
22:18
so the original one was in the 80s and
22:20
it was one of the words and that was
22:22
abilene which is the pleasant coolness
22:23
on the other side of a pillow which is
22:25
lovely there's no word for that on a hot
22:26
night when you turn your pillow over ah
22:28
so nice so all the all the words in it
22:31
all the definitions of
22:32
real place names from around the world
22:34
matched with things that
22:36
experiences that don't yet have worried
22:37
to condense them exactly yeah so angram
22:40
an amusing anagram you've come up with
22:42
which doesn't quite work
22:44
for example or danby whisk which is the
22:46
bit of kitchen equipment that
22:48
you don't know what it's for but it
22:49
always means that you can't quite shut
22:50
the drawer properly
22:52
and you have to sort of jam it in so
22:54
that kind of stuff yeah
22:55
that's correct yeah going to the the
22:57
welsh thing
22:58
there are there are several thousand
22:59
people in patagonia in argentina
23:01
who are descended from the welsh and
23:03
speak welsh and spanish as their two
23:04
main languages
23:05
there are nearly as many welsh speakers
23:07
there as their own whales
23:09
that's bizarre yeah i really love it
23:11
when um language gets kind of preserved
23:13
because you're in a isolated place i
23:15
remember going to north carolina and
23:17
being right on the coastline and
23:18
obviously that's where some of the first
23:19
people landed
23:20
from southwest coast and everyone there
23:23
spoke with kind of a really thick
23:25
devonshire accent it's so weird
23:27
so you're in north carolina and people
23:28
are talking like this too
23:30
i'm not very good at that accent i'll
23:32
re-practice um
23:33
palmerston island i think in the middle
23:35
of the um pacific and they all speak
23:37
with a gloucestershire accent
23:38
yeah that's so cool everyone on the
23:39
island oh really yeah my favorite word
23:41
is grockel which is a devon word which
23:43
means somebody's not from around here
23:44
yeah that's gary romney the hawaiians
23:47
have a word for that actually um
23:51
or something like that which means
23:52
someone who's not from around there oh
23:54
yeah
23:54
yeah yeah there are some other hawaiian
23:57
words which we should probably
23:58
borrow in a bit similar to what we do
24:00
with um afterlife these are quite cool
24:02
words
24:03
makahaka hakka is someone with deep set
24:05
eyeballs
24:06
which is quite good that's me yeah i got
24:08
deep sound oh yeah yeah
24:10
if you're listening at home we can
24:12
barely see dan's eyes because they're
24:13
just so far away
24:14
[Laughter]
24:17
there's another one it's uh which means
24:20
to live like a hermit because of
24:22
disappointment
24:23
wow that's amazing it's very specific as
24:26
well
24:26
the fact that you need a word for that
24:27
implies there are a lot of people living
24:29
as hermits because of disappointment
24:32
they should meet up and not be hermits
24:34
anymore
24:35
this is completely off topic but do you
24:37
know that thing about the hermits in
24:39
like the first to the fourth century was
24:41
a fashion for um
24:42
people who were religious to go and live
24:44
in the desert as a hermit
24:46
a few people did it and then it became
24:47
more fashionable and more fashionable
24:49
and more fashionable still
24:50
and then you have all these writings of
24:52
these hermits living in the desert going
24:54
i can't move for all these other hermits
24:56
it's just
24:56
totally hermit yeah i read the other day
24:58
that one of the things that people used
24:59
to do
25:00
to sort out their melancholy this was
25:02
the rich back
25:03
in the day is that they would hire a
25:05
hermit to live on their grounds and they
25:06
would build a hermitage
25:07
and they would go and talk to that
25:08
hermit and then they would let the
25:10
problems sit with the hermit and the
25:11
hermit would then just
25:12
mull on them on their behalf yeah but
25:14
sometimes if you couldn't afford the
25:15
hermit they would often just build
25:17
the hermitage they would uh leave items
25:20
in particular positions
25:22
so they look like the home it was just
25:23
he'd just gone out for a walk you're
25:25
showing off to your rich friends
25:26
oh i've got a hermit oh he must be out
25:28
here
25:29
he's out socializing yeah he's gone out
25:31
on the town you don't really need to do
25:33
that because all you have to do is say
25:34
oh he's a hermit he doesn't like to be
25:35
dismissed
25:37
that's true i can't believe there was a
25:39
theory that it might make you less
25:40
melancholy to go and rearrange the
25:42
furniture in your fake hermit house
25:44
it sounds like i would walk out of that
25:46
house and commit suicide immediately
25:50
[Laughter]
25:52
somebody from the university of
25:54
leicester school of english who was
25:55
researching the hermit thing said that
25:56
they would leave
25:57
reading mata and glasses out a bit like
25:59
leaving sherry out for father christmas
26:02
so yeah so to look like he was there and
26:05
yeah
26:05
i think that's quite charming yeah yeah
26:07
and then they'd pretend to turn the
26:08
pages and like put a bookmark in a new
26:10
basement
26:11
every day yeah oh he's really got a long
26:13
way with little dorit
26:15
um words that we do get just going back
26:18
to welsh oh yeah because we've gone so
26:20
far off topic but words that we do get
26:21
from welsh include
26:23
flannel flummery corgi and
26:26
dad that yeah that's a pretty big hitter
26:29
but not
26:30
mum no not mum isn't isn't ma
26:34
the universal word for mother as a
26:36
result of it's
26:37
all babies but there is a place and i
26:39
think it's georgia or armenia where
26:41
the word for mother is dada yeah it's
26:44
one of very few places in the world
26:46
the kogi thing is quite interesting
26:47
because it means that um
26:49
the correct plural of corgi is corgoon
26:52
because that's the way the welsh florals
26:54
are made you have another thing about
26:56
plurals one is um that whenever i go to
26:59
um a sandwich shop i get very annoyed if
27:02
um i ask panini and they only give me
27:04
one because panini is plural
27:07
and i always ask for a penino if i only
27:09
want one of them i'm going to be
27:10
perpetually disappointed
27:13
oh my god never invite a qif to any kind
27:17
of shop
27:17
you're just going to be pedantic there's
27:20
no such thing as a fish get out of my
27:21
fish and chip shop
27:22
you're one of them aren't you do you
27:25
know what the state fish of hawaii is
27:27
no i'm going to tell you it's the
27:32
moon
27:35
this is why we took from hawaiian rather
27:37
than from welsh because they've got so
27:38
many vowels and vowels are really easy
27:39
to pronounce
27:40
the um hawaiian word who we are we are
27:44
meaning certified has the most
27:45
consecutive vowels of any word in the
27:47
current human speech
27:49
just kind of sounds like they're drunk
27:51
all the time doesn't it if you're just
27:52
lighting too many vowels
27:55
[Laughter]
27:59
um okay we should wrap up just one final
28:01
thing anna one final thing fun etymology
28:03
the first known use of the word
28:04
abracadabra
28:05
uh was from the third century seems kind
28:08
of weird to me because he would have
28:09
thought it was like a modern
28:10
i don't know it sounds like such a weird
28:12
modern concoction but it was used in the
28:13
third century by a doctor who prescribed
28:15
it as an anti-malarial it's one of the
28:17
first proposed cures for
28:18
malaria to say abracadabra
28:21
you actually have to wear it around your
28:23
neck and an amulet but i like the idea
28:25
if someone goes to the doctor's it's
28:26
like i'm feeling not very good i think
28:28
i've got malaria oh i've got the one
28:30
thing for you
28:30
abracadabra yeah
28:34
thanks i feel much better

so it's not bad it's like a fairy tale
01:13
world uh
01:14
it is a stoner film with that name uh
01:16
i'm quite
01:17
i am excited you know based in
01:18
netherlands uh yes it's in
01:20
amsterdam yeah and uh i can't really
01:23
reveal too much i have a fact about
01:24
amsterdam oh yeah to hear it
01:26
i can't remember what year it was it was
01:28
about um i don't know 80 years or so ago
01:30
but there was a fog so bad
01:32
that 29 people fell into the canals in a
01:35
single night
01:36
[Laughter]
01:38
that's fantastic okay let's start with
01:40
fact number one and we're going to start
01:41
with our special guest eric
01:43
uh bonjour uh right so in 1923
01:47
jockey frank hayes won a race in belmont
01:50
park in new york
01:51
despite being dead wow okay so he's
01:54
playing that one
01:55
yeah no he started alive right he
01:57
started alive
01:58
oh so he died mid-race mid-race yeah
02:02
okay give us more of the story well
02:04
basically he suffered from a heart
02:05
attack
02:06
uh mid-race uh but he was straddled
02:09
nice and strong in the saddle and the
02:11
horse won but how does
02:12
is there a seat belt like well he keeled
02:16
over right
02:16
yeah yeah we're not getting that movie
02:18
shane sort of like slumped over kind of
02:20
thing
02:20
yeah he's got his feet nice and strapped
02:22
in and
02:23
you know you've got your hands as well
02:24
sort of tied around the
02:26
the reigns did anyone did anyone notice
02:30
during the race or was it only
02:31
discovered after he had won
02:33
he was probably the only one just kept
02:34
running more and more laughs
02:37
he was probably the only one not hitting
02:39
the horse yeah yeah
02:40
yes still one what does that say about
02:42
cruelty yeah
02:43
they sent this horse am i right and
02:45
saying it was called sweet kiss sweet
02:47
sweet kiss of death
02:48
sweet kiss of death that's what they
02:49
nicknamed it afterwards is it yeah
02:51
wow this is interesting uh link your dad
02:54
eric
02:55
is a jockey isn't he yeah i mean that's
02:57
one of the reasons why i thought i mean
02:58
i only found out this this fact
02:59
uh this week yeah but uh but yeah my dad
03:02
is indeed a jockey because you're pretty
03:04
tall
03:04
if you don't mind me saying yeah just uh
03:07
and i've got big gums as well
03:09
which has never helped you know
03:12
at school they'd be like oh well clearly
03:13
your dad's had sex with a horse
03:15
it's not fair um unfortunately i'm hung
03:18
like a human
03:22
um you know the way that um jockeys sit
03:25
it's kind of like a crouched thing where
03:27
they're leaning forward not the dead
03:28
ones the alive ones
03:30
this is called the monkey crouch and it
03:32
was invented by a guy called todd sloan
03:34
in 1897
03:36
and what's interesting about it is no
03:37
one uh rode horses like that before in
03:39
horse races and when he invented that
03:41
horse race times and records improved by
03:43
five to seven percent in a single year
03:46
so you just completely change the spot
03:48
by deciding to crouch down and lean
03:50
forward no one had ever done it wow that
03:51
sounds amazing yeah that's like the um
03:53
in the [ __ ] floor yeah in high jump
03:55
yes yeah i mean that completely
03:57
transformed the sport didn't it
03:58
yeah we did a couple of years ago the um
04:01
the new way of throwing a javelin which
04:02
was invented
04:03
very briefly in the 1930s which is to
04:05
hold it by one end swing around
04:07
and let go the javelin yeah like
04:09
throwing the hammer
04:10
and it was banned almost immediately
04:14
for obvious reasons but it did provide
04:16
amazingly long javelin throws in fact to
04:18
the extent that it could have been quite
04:19
dangerous
04:20
a because it goes too far in my
04:22
expectations and b because
04:24
it's very hard to get it in exactly the
04:25
right direction
04:27
just getting pale incredible a slight
04:30
margin of error yeah and you've yeah
04:32
in the paris olympics in 1904
04:35
1900 um the paris 1900 yeah paris 1900
04:39
people trained in the public parks uh
04:42
javelins and they had to
04:43
they were warned to be extra vigilant
04:45
some of them some people trained at
04:46
night
04:46
so there was less chance of hitting
04:48
people but also more chance of hitting
04:50
people
04:52
the interesting thing about javelins is
04:53
that they make them um less aerodynamic
04:56
as the time goes on because
04:58
the the length of a running track is
05:00
always going to be about 100 meters
05:02
and so what they do is they have to make
05:03
sure that traveling can't be thrown more
05:05
than that
05:06
people get stronger and stronger and
05:07
better and they get closer to 100 meters
05:09
and then they always make the javelins a
05:10
little bit worse so that people can't
05:12
get
05:12
that far by the end it'll just be like a
05:14
toothpick really
05:15
heavy too
05:20
wow okay so what you were always at the
05:22
it was uh 1897 when
05:25
he discovered that idea okay that's
05:27
amazing um it's an interesting um
05:29
thing when you start looking into what
05:31
people have achieved once they've died
05:33
um there's a really one of my favorite
05:35
stories from
05:36
the ignobles world we've had mark abrams
05:39
the founder on on a few podcasts ago and
05:41
he wrote a book years ago called
05:42
the nobel prizes too why chickens prefer
05:45
beautiful humans
05:46
there's a fantastic story about a man
05:47
called lal bihari
05:49
who in 1975 when he went to the bank to
05:52
apply for a loan he discovered that he'd
05:54
been declared dead
05:56
by his uncle uh who wanted to declare
05:59
him dead in order to get
06:00
the land rights for the farm that he
06:01
owned and he spent
06:03
19 years as a dead man trying to get
06:06
recognized as a living man
06:08
uh and it just no one would recognize
06:10
him and he did incredible things like he
06:12
he stood for parliament he tried to get
06:14
arrested countless times because they
06:16
arrested him technically it meant he was
06:18
alive
06:19
so they couldn't arrest him he would do
06:20
all this stuff and they're like we can't
06:22
arrest you because you're dead
06:23
and so for 19 years he's stayed dead
06:26
technically
06:27
and finally got a court to overturn it
06:28
and he's set up in
06:30
uh in his town where he lived and i
06:32
think for all of india uh which is where
06:34
he's from
06:35
um a whole network and a group in
06:38
support of people who have been declared
06:39
dead
06:40
who are in fact alive oh i'd love to
06:42
have that power
06:44
that sounds amazing it's called the
06:45
association of dead people that he
06:47
created
06:48
and it was in 1994 that he was finally
06:51
proven to be alive a massive problem as
06:52
well in in places where the paperwork
06:54
often doesn't catch up
06:55
with people's actual legal status or
06:58
whether they're alive or not that
06:59
it happens a great deal that's why
07:01
there's a need for an association you
07:02
know was there anything
07:03
was that in india yes it was yeah
07:04
believe in reincarnation that's why he
07:06
was uh born again i guess
07:07
that's possible well let's go back to um
07:11
horse racing and jockeys and stuff like
07:13
that um and there's a
07:14
there was a jockey a very successful one
07:17
called laffett pinkey
07:18
jr and in order to keep his weight down
07:21
he would take a single peanut
07:23
slice it into slivers and eat just half
07:25
of it for lunch
07:26
the dieting for uh jockeys is actually
07:28
mad so like
07:30
me and my mom and my mom's french so
07:32
we'd eat like
07:33
so much we'd probably pick out and then
07:35
my dad he'd uh he'd always eat salads
07:38
and stuff
07:38
and i remember when we were in south
07:40
africa for one of his races
07:42
and he covered himself in black bin bags
07:45
right
07:46
and just sellotaped it all the way up to
07:48
his neck and then he pushed a
07:49
wheelbarrow full of things
07:51
and he ran around with the wheelbarrow
07:53
around the field
07:54
to lose the weight and i remember he
07:56
took off all the black bin
07:58
bags and it just poured out like a
08:00
waterfall
08:01
it was disgusting that's amazing i also
08:03
read that people
08:04
speed what a jockey speedwalk instead of
08:06
run because they don't want to put on
08:08
extra muscle don't know if that's muscle
08:10
yeah um is it ap mccoy
08:13
yeah he's one of the great jockeys of
08:15
time yeah i live i live near him
08:18
new market yeah he has very intensive um
08:21
almost golden hot baths same reason i
08:23
think to sweat out
08:24
so much of the water in his body he does
08:26
it for a couple of hours a couple of
08:28
times a day before a race yeah anything
08:29
that makes them sweat like sometimes
08:30
they'll
08:31
commit a crime near the police you know
08:32
just see if they get away with it
08:35
that's like two stones gone okay before
08:38
we move on uh ann have you got any facts
08:40
you want to
08:41
yeah i do um james's amsterdam fog was
08:43
in
08:44
1893 and it was 79 people who fell into
08:46
the canals that one night
08:48
so watch where you're going in fog um
08:51
frank hayes the new york times um
08:54
reckoned that he died just after his
08:56
horse took the leap before he finished
08:58
and they put it down to his um heavy
09:00
training regime
09:01
and his excitement coming first oh
09:04
which so well the horse's excitement the
09:07
um frank hayes excitement he's just oh
09:09
okay i've been working so hard and then
09:10
he suddenly saw he was about to win and
09:12
that may have been
09:13
what gave way um there's a tumblr i
09:15
found called curious history i haven't
09:17
seen them before but they are apparently
09:18
one of the 20 best tumblers in the world
09:20
according to msn and they say the
09:22
spectators
09:24
um thought he was showing off and was
09:25
riding one-handed kind of like riding a
09:27
bike with no hands
09:28
okay he was going over the line and no
09:29
one realized he died
09:31
until the race was over the javelin
09:34
spinning round technique actually quite
09:36
effective the current world record was
09:38
83 meters
09:39
the guy who spun around through 112
09:42
and was then was then disallowed
09:45
because yeah didn't want the copycats
09:47
that was in 1966.
09:49
so the the world record for javelin has
09:51
been disqualified well that one was
09:53
because
09:53
you're not yeah i don't think anyone's
09:56
like a helicopter
09:57
has anyone done that many before uh i
09:59
don't think anyone's got that far
10:01
but the thing is every time that they
10:02
change every time they change the
10:03
javelin they that invalidates all
10:05
previous records because you're not
10:07
on a level playing field yeah the
10:08
current record is with the current
10:09
javelin is 98.48 meters
10:12
so still less than the guy who spun over
10:14
his head that's amazing so yeah it's
10:16
pretty good
10:16
good factual nuggets
10:18
[Music]
10:23
okay let's uh let's move on to fact
10:26
number two
10:27
fact number two is my fact and that is
10:30
that some buddhist monks run marathons
10:33
to achieve enlightenment so this
10:36
is a i think extraordinary
10:40
uh endurance tests kind of seems like
10:42
it's the greatest endurance
10:44
test on our planet which is uh done by
10:46
these monks who are known as the
10:47
marathon monks
10:49
and these marathon monks uh achieve
10:51
enlightenment by going on these
10:53
huge thousand day running challenges
10:55
that go over the course of seven years
10:58
and each year they have to do a hundred
11:00
days in one chunk
11:02
of running a distance per day so 30
11:05
kilometers for the first
11:07
um 100 days then they take a break then
11:09
they do another 100 days next year and
11:11
year two they do 30 kilometers again
11:13
per day day uh year three it's 30
11:15
kilometers again
11:16
and it's 30 for four but then for five
11:18
they do 200 days straight on year six it
11:21
jumps up to 60 kilometers
11:23
per day for 100 days straight and then
11:25
in year seven it's 84 kilometers
11:27
per day for 100 days straight and then
11:29
30 kilometers
11:30
additional 100 days after that and if at
11:34
any point
11:35
during this whole process they fail to
11:37
reach the number that they're meant to
11:39
reach on that target
11:40
they kill themselves and only 46 people
11:44
in the hundred years or so that this has
11:46
been going on have successfully
11:47
completed it
11:48
so they kill themselves if they haven't
11:50
already died in the meantime
11:51
exactly but if they if they sort of if
11:53
they run short by a couple of kilometers
11:55
they carry they dress
11:56
in white because the white is the symbol
11:58
uh the color of death so they're they're
12:00
dressed for death
12:01
they bring a sword and a rope so they
12:04
can either
12:04
it sounds a lot like a ku klux klan are
12:08
you sure you got your
12:09
right yes but yeah so they have the
12:12
option of hanging themselves
12:13
or of um stabbing themselves um
12:16
i think they may not still kill
12:17
themselves i think i think they haven't
12:20
since
12:20
the since the 19th century i think it's
12:22
been officially a bit discouraged
12:24
yeah yeah it's been it's been that's
12:25
true the origin the original heart i
12:27
mean there is an
12:28
area uh near the mountain where these
12:30
monks live
12:31
in japan which is called the mountain
12:33
hye i i don't know how to pronounce that
12:35
probably it's h
12:36
i e and it's littered with unmarked
12:38
graves from
12:39
the people pre-19th century monks who
12:42
did not
12:43
manage to finish and complete it and had
12:45
to kill themselves as a as a result but
12:46
the idea is that if you do complete it
12:49
you get a medal you've got a nice little
12:51
medal you've got
12:52
the back and those flowers and the
12:54
silver blanket around you
12:55
[Laughter]
12:58
well actually you say silver blanket but
12:59
um one thing that i found out about
13:01
monks is that they uh
13:02
they have a technique where they can uh
13:05
heat themselves
13:06
up so uh what was the so it's a yoga
13:09
technique called
13:09
tomo and um they can enter like a deep
13:12
meditation and if there's a few monks
13:14
like around each other uh and they can
13:17
they can have like cold cold like
13:20
blankets
13:21
on them and they can heat those blankets
13:23
in a cold room wow
13:24
and other people would die there have
13:26
been experiments on those guys who um
13:28
i think you had sort of wet blankets put
13:30
on them and they they started steaming
13:32
until they were completely dry um there
13:35
is an endurance swimmer who we've
13:36
covered on
13:37
qi on tv and he is able to raise his
13:40
body temperature by up to one or two
13:43
degrees because he swims in very icy
13:44
water
13:45
and i wrote to him and asked is this
13:47
true and one of his
13:48
representatives wrote back and said yep
13:50
that's that's what he does let's go back
13:52
to
13:52
uh crazy monks yes yeah let's do that
13:55
exactly i'll
13:56
i'll tell you one more thing about the
13:57
marathon marks just to bring us back in
13:59
which is that um
14:00
uh so 46 people only have ever completed
14:04
uh this course i think i've got the
14:06
number on and it would be great to know
14:08
when
14:08
this practice started because i think
14:10
it's either 100 years ago 400 years ago
14:12
or a thousand years ago
14:13
um but uh 46 people have completed it
14:18
um one guy did it twice
14:22
yeah he's super enlightened yeah how
14:25
many marathons has eddie is odd though
14:27
yeah quite a lot
14:28
he's he eddie did 43 marathons in 51
14:33
days
14:33
in 2009. also his marathons were
14:36
presumably
14:37
a lot shorter i'm guessing
14:40
no marathon is always the same distance
14:43
now
14:44
they're not always the same distance uh
14:45
the original
14:47
distance run after the battle of
14:48
marathon was i think
14:50
about 22 miles it wasn't any more than
14:52
25 either
14:54
and there was a there was a lot of early
14:55
flux but wasn't the first marathon by
14:57
this guy that
14:58
had to run from argos to
15:01
like somewhere else because he was
15:02
reporting on a background
15:04
okay there had been one it wasn't that
15:06
we've lost the battle you need to flee
15:08
immediately it was hey we won guys
15:09
okay
15:16
there is a really interesting thing
15:17
about the official
15:19
modern marathon length which is that
15:20
it's 26 miles and 385 yards
15:24
and it was only it's only been the case
15:27
since 1908 and it was done to please the
15:28
british royal family
15:30
um because queen alexandra wanted the
15:32
race to start on the lawn at windsor
15:33
castle
15:34
so that her children could watch from
15:36
the nursery window and then an extra
15:38
mile was added to the race and then at
15:39
the end of the race
15:40
385 yards were added so that it could
15:42
finish in front of the
15:43
royal box at the olympic stadium in
15:45
white city so it's all been done
15:48
uh an extra mile and 385 yards
15:51
royal win here's the thing about um
15:54
crazy marathons there was um an
15:56
italian athlete called maro prosperi and
15:58
in 1994 he was running
16:00
a marathon in the moroccan sahara but he
16:03
got lost
16:04
and um when they found him nine days
16:07
later
16:08
he'd run 200 kilometers off course into
16:10
algeria
16:11
he'd lost 18 kilograms and only survived
16:14
by drinking his own urine and eating
16:16
bats that he found in an abandoned
16:18
mosque
16:21
um but this guy here do you have to
16:23
catch these bats
16:24
yeah cause that's pretty impressive as
16:26
well if he like after running loosely
16:28
goes away
16:29
drinking your own urine still like oh
16:31
now i'm gonna catch these bats
16:34
wow he just must have thought he was
16:36
having a terrible race
16:37
but he was he might have thought he was
16:38
winning yeah the other guys will be here
16:41
any minute
16:42
so anyway he got a bit dispirited as you
16:44
would um
16:45
after a few days and he um wrote a note
16:47
to his wife and
16:48
he took a pen knife from his rucksack
16:50
and he rucksack and he slit his wrists
16:53
um but he was so dehydrated that his um
16:56
blood
16:57
um his blood thickened so much it
16:59
clotted the wound so he couldn't even
17:01
kill himself
17:02
and then they eventually found him what
17:03
you should have had is a rope or some
17:05
sword
17:06
some sort of sword
17:10
i really like the story of when the
17:12
modern olympics came back
17:14
the very first marathon that was run um
17:16
because it was a big it was a big
17:18
it was the i guess big event for greece
17:20
the idea that that is what they would
17:22
win
17:23
the marathon the marathon was so rooted
17:24
in their culture um
17:26
and they already had been disappointed
17:27
because they lost discus they were
17:29
furious
17:30
because that should have been one of the
17:32
events that they wanted i have a quick
17:33
thing about that the guy who won the
17:35
discus um
17:36
had never competed with one of their
17:39
discusses before
17:40
he was an american and he had had a
17:42
practice one made in america which was
17:44
extremely heavy
17:46
and so he got to the real olympics
17:49
completely fluffed his first two goes
17:50
because he wasn't used to playing with
17:51
this
17:52
new discus and then through the winning
17:54
show like the way you're throwing it
17:56
like a frisbee as well
17:57
yeah well that might be the that might
17:59
be what is the sport movie the monkey
18:01
crouch
18:02
yeah sorry you were saying about the
18:04
well no so they
18:05
they've been uh they've been sort of
18:07
shamed in the discus they lost it to
18:08
that man
18:09
uh and so they desperately needed the
18:11
win in the marathon so there were 17
18:13
people competing
18:14
in the marathon um and they had good
18:16
chances of winning
18:17
uh as 13 of those athletes were from
18:19
greece so that was pretty high odds
18:22
um but it's great because very early on
18:24
at the race so it kind of shows you it
18:25
shows you a different age of sportsman
18:27
as well when you hear these stories of
18:28
how more
18:29
kind of like they had the right stuff
18:31
and there was more grit uh so the early
18:33
leader in the race was actually a
18:34
frenchman
18:35
runner um but he ended up uh pulling out
18:38
of the race because he got to exhaust
18:40
but mid-race while he was in the lead he
18:42
made a stop at a local
18:44
inn to drink a glass of cognac from his
18:46
future father-in-law
18:47
so he had time to stop and have two
18:50
drinks and then carry on but he dropped
18:52
out because of exhaustion
18:53
uh so the guy who ended up winning was
18:55
from greece his name was spyrodin louise
18:58
he ran it in two hours in 58 minutes and
19:00
what fueled him along the way
19:02
what his kind of choice of drinks were
19:04
he had wine
19:05
milk beer some orange juice and an
19:08
easter egg
19:10
brilliant yeah that's the winner of the
19:11
first ever modern olympic
19:13
easter egg an easter egg amazing about
19:15
the guy going into a pub they used to do
19:17
that in the tour de france do you know
19:18
that like
19:19
whenever the um the tour would go by a
19:22
pub or a bar
19:23
and the cyclist would just all get out
19:25
and on mass run into the bar
19:27
and just pilfer everything they could
19:28
get all the wine and all the beers and
19:31
everything like that
19:31
and they would run out again and then go
19:33
so all the people who
19:35
ran bars and that went past the tour de
19:37
france thing they would always close
19:38
down the shutters and try and stop the
19:40
cyclists from getting their friends it's
19:42
always the french isn't it eric because
19:43

19:45

19:52
[Laughter]
19:54
i love as well the second and third
19:56
place were won by greece as well but um
19:58
the third place winner um got
19:59
disqualified because he was later fans
20:01
who have covered part of the course in a
20:03
carriage
20:04
carriage got a lift no one said it was
20:06
against the rules that's all i'm saying
20:08

20:11
we do
20:12
uh anne have you got anything for oh i
20:14
have got so much for you oh great
20:16
so so the man the swimmer who can change
20:20
his own body temperature is called lewis
20:21
pew p-u-g-h so that's pew let's run with
20:24
you
20:25
and he is the only person who has swung
20:27
long distance in every ocean in the
20:28
world including the north pole
20:30
which he did wearing goggles speedos and
20:32
a cap wow that was all and cnn
20:34
cnn have called him the human polar bear
20:38
so that's him um the marathon running
20:40
monks um they seem to keep records since
20:42
1885 which makes it 129 years
20:45
um 46 of them have done it since okay
20:48
eating bats is not good for you they
20:49
spread diseases guinea
20:50
actually a few weeks ago have bands
20:52
eating bats because they've got an ebola
20:53
breakout and they're blaming the bats
20:55
for their 62
20:56
62 people have died um and they eat them
20:59
either in a peppery soup or they dry
21:00
them out
21:01
for a fire they advise not eating bats
21:03
until the ebola has gone away
21:06
um in terms of eating strange things
21:08
while you run it's not quite easter eggs
21:10
but a same bulk famously loves his
21:11
chicken nuggets
21:12
when he on the day he won a gold medal
21:14
in beijing they asked him how he did it
21:16
and he said he basically got up late
21:17
eight chicken nuggets went back to bed
21:19
eight more chicken nuggets did the race
21:21
such a show off such a show-off got a
21:23
world record apparently he got through a
21:25
thousand chicken nuggets over the
21:26
beijing olympics which worked out
21:28
100 a day that's a marathon that's
21:31
that's like a marathon monk but it's the
21:33
equivalent of two actual chickens which
21:35
is pretty impressive
21:37
that has not been fact-checked if you're
21:38
listening to the man that's for you
21:50
okay on to fact number three and that is
21:53
yours james
21:54
okay my fact this week is the slovakian
21:57
and slovenian embassies in washington
21:59
meet once a month to exchange wrongly
22:01
addressed mail
22:02
[Laughter]
22:04
that's fantastic isn't that great i just
22:06
that this came from a website um
22:08
[Music]
22:10
slovakrepublic.org i think it
22:12
seems to be pretty kosher this sloven uh
22:14
slovak
22:15
website i've got a special section of
22:16
their website saying we are not slovenia
22:21
they've got a load of um examples
22:23
apparently george w bush once um said
22:26
the only thing i know about slovakia is
22:28
what i learned firsthand from your
22:30
foreign minister who came to texas
22:32
and their foreign minister had never
22:33
been to texas it was the slovenian
22:35
forest minister who'd been there before
22:37
brilliant typical george w bush it's not
22:41
just him
22:41
silvio berlusconi uh introduced
22:43
slovenian prime minister anton ropp to
22:45
the crowd of journalists saying
22:47
i'm very happy to be here today with the
22:49
prime minister of
22:50
prime minister of slovakia so it's very
22:54
easily built
22:54
it does happen for these countries that
22:56
there's just we put um
22:58
we find that we keep seeing examples of
23:00
people putting minimum effort
23:02
into actually working out who they are
23:05
what they're like does that remember
23:07
that famous incident with the national
23:08
anthem for
23:09
kazakhstan yeah that [ __ ] you know up on
23:11
the podium
23:12
this girl had won gold medal and then
23:14
they played the borat version
23:16
oh the nationals and he sings in
23:20
you know the lyrics are in the lyrics
23:22
are like um we have the cleanest
23:24
prostitutes in the region
23:25
kazakhstan's prostitutes are the
23:27
cleanest in the region except of course
23:29
for turkmenistan
23:30
kazakhstan kazakhstan you very nice
23:32
place come grasp the mighty penis of our
23:35
leader from junction with testies to tip
23:37
off its face
23:38
that's that's easter that's going back
23:40
to the slovak
23:42
thing in the slovak culture there was a
23:43
slovak cultural group in america
23:45
and they had a big sort of map of their
23:47
country and there was an old guy came in
23:49
and
23:50
he was looking around and they asked
23:51
what he was doing and he was trying to
23:52
find his um
23:54
his grandfather's village because his
23:56
grandfather was from there
23:58
but then his wife came over to him she
24:00
looked at the sign and said you're not
24:01
slovak you're slovenian
24:08
[Laughter]
24:10
if they don't know how can you know the
24:12
rest of the world know
24:14
yeah that's a great story
24:18
yeah i i read about um these there was a
24:21
new couple
24:22
i think they just got married and then
24:24
they wanted to get a flight to sydney
24:26
uh and they bought the flight and it was
24:28
a lot cheaper than they thought
24:30
and when they got there they found out
24:31
that they'd actually gone to sydney nova
24:33
scotia
24:34
by accident this is um
24:38
unlike yours you're from sydney aren't
24:40
you i am yeah unlike your sydney this is
24:42
a former mining town with a population
24:43
of
24:44
26 083 and one of the highest
24:47
unemployment rates in canada
24:49
but it does have a very nice opera house
24:50
[Laughter]
24:53
well this couple they said oh we're just
24:55
going to make the most of it and they
24:56
were interviewed in the newspaper
24:58
and they said they were looking forward
25:00
to looking at the pickup trucks and
25:02
eating the local lobster brilliant
25:04
wow that's fantastic that's nice like
25:06
the positivity
25:07
yeah okay so i was looking at other
25:10
mix-ups
25:10
and um i saw a newspaper story um the
25:13
fda in america was warning
25:15
people not to mix up the prescription
25:17
eye drops called durazole
25:20
with the acid containing wart remover
25:23
duracell
25:24
apparently these are two two medicines
25:27
with very similar names and people have
25:29
been putting this acid in their eyes
25:30
thinking it was um
25:31
eye drops oh my god and that got me to
25:33
thinking if there's any other like
25:35
medicines with similar names and what
25:37
could happen yeah and
25:38
i found the brilliant list online of um
25:40
commonly confused medicine
25:42
so there's um there's a drug called
25:44
allegra which is a drug often used for
25:46
the temporary relief of runny nose and
25:48
people keep getting that mixed up with
25:50
viagra
25:52
that's their excuse yeah there's a
25:56
there's something that actually helps
25:57
to cook um carrots and potatoes it's
26:00
called vegisil
26:04
some people confuse it and there was
26:07
another thing called
26:08
abbino this was a company name and it
26:10
was an anti-gas
26:12
thing if you've got a bit of gas you
26:13
take this bino and it makes you feel
26:15
better
26:16
but people were mistaking it for biendo
26:18
which is belladonna and opium
26:20
oh wow
26:21
[Laughter]
26:24
um just another slovakia slovenia
26:27
um they've basically got really similar
26:29
flags as well which doesn't help they've
26:31
got a white blue red stripe for the
26:32
shield on the front shields are
26:34
different everything else is the same
26:35
um so slovenia have done a contest to
26:38
find a new flag but i don't think
26:40
they've adopted it yet
26:41
um which will distinguish them and then
26:43
there's a professor
26:44
um from the university of the university
26:47
of
26:48
ljubljana the university of ljubljana
26:52
who said he reckons a problem with the
26:54
confusion is that slovenia hasn't got a
26:55
brand finland has nokia and sweden has
26:57
ikea
26:58
and they need their own brand so someone
27:00
suggested slovenia becomes the one-hour
27:02
country
27:02
so you can get everywhere within an hour
27:04
it's very small
27:06
and then um with confusions as well
27:09
there was that thing at the
27:10
london olympics when the north korean
27:12
women's football team walked off because
27:14
they showed the south korean flag
27:16
not the north korean that's very
27:19
embarrassing did not go down well
27:20
uh welcoming them with the wrong flag
27:23
and just at the end rubino
27:25
um there was a second dennis the menace
27:26
who made his debut in america
27:28
um of course literally within five days
27:31
of being debuted yeah
27:32
america's dennis the menace and they had
27:34
a very similar look
27:35
and they were done completely
27:36
independently of each other that's
27:38
amazing it was like
27:39
deep impact in armageddon volcano and uh
27:42
dante speak
27:43
yep any others um
27:46
genesis and exodus the bands
27:51
[Music]
27:56
so let's move on to our final fact of
27:59
the show
28:00
and we come on to mr andy murray andy
28:03
okay my fact is in the 18th century
28:05
there were genuine medicines called
28:07
alan's nipple liniment grimstone's eye
28:10
snuff
28:11
miller's worm plums and italian bosom
28:14
friend
28:17
do you know what was in any of them or a
28:19
couple somebody said that grimston's eye
28:21
snuff was just pepper
28:22
just black pepper ground up um but it i
28:25
mean a lot of patent medicines
28:27
really consisted only of sort of 50
28:29
alcohol
28:30
yeah so they were and a lot of them we
28:32
call them patent medicines of course all
28:34
these fantastically named
28:35
uh old hamlin's wizard oil just you know
28:39
beautifully known i want that yeah um
28:41
sugar plums for worms
28:43
aromatic lozenges of steel cockings
28:46
cough lozenges
28:47
gingerbread worm cakes there were some
28:49
of them that did have active ingredients
28:50
there was one called mrs winslow
28:52
soothing syrup
28:53
and that was aimed mainly at babies and
28:55
children and it contained a full gram of
28:58
morphine
28:58
per ounce uh and cop's baby friend
29:02
that was another baby one bob's baby
29:04
friend and they
29:06
the label there boasted 8.5 percent
29:08
alcohol and 1 8 grain sulfate of opium
29:11
per ounce
29:12
and that was marketed to help to help
29:14
babies sleep yep
29:15
amazing you could you could buy uh
29:17
heroin couldn't you in the first world
29:18
war to send to troops yes on the front
29:20
line yeah
29:21
you're bad in harrods i think really i
29:23
think so still can i think
29:25
i'm not certain yeah they're behind
29:27
harrod
29:28
[Laughter]
29:30
um has anyone heard about during the
29:33
middle ages when
29:34
um uh there was uh the black death uh
29:37
that farts in a jar was a thing that was
29:39
prescribed to people
29:40
yeah the idea was that if you
29:42
conditioned um the smell
29:44
of something quite disgusting to your
29:46
nose by the time if there was an
29:47
outbreak of black death around you
29:49
you would become accustomed to that kind
29:50
of smell so it kind of made you immune
29:52
to what was going to happen
29:53
so you would go to the doctor and they
29:54
would give you a fart in a jar
29:56
i don't know if it was your own fart or
29:58
if it was a pre-packaged fart
29:59
and you would go home with it and then
30:01
you would you would rip open the lid
30:02
have a sniff
30:03
in case of emergency brake glass
30:07
rayquin that's incredible what is that
30:10
like an early version of the vaccination
30:11
idea sort of
30:13
or like taking small doses of a poison
30:15
to build up a resistance which yes roman
30:17
emperors did
30:18
yes exactly it sat to build up the
30:21
of resistance to your own farts well it
30:24
was fair enough when i had um which i've
30:26
been doing for years
30:27
when i when i had uh my appendix uh when
30:30
i had my appendix taken out
30:31
and they cut the intestine by accident
30:33
and stomach acid was pouring out
30:35
and i was digesting myself right so i
30:37
was in hospital for like three months
30:38
and you oh you know i wasn't allowed to
30:40
eat anything
30:41
so because i was allowed to eat anything
30:43
because nothing worked
30:45
i also can fart so but there was gas
30:47
trapped inside and the nurses did say
30:50
you're allowed to leave
30:51
or eat when you can fart and it took me
30:54
two months to essentially release any
30:56
gas and when it came out
30:59
it was the worst thing i have ever smelt
31:02
ever but what was also really horrible
31:05
was that i had to call a nurse to make
31:07
her smell it
31:09
which is the opposite i have a feeling
31:11
you didn't really have to call out
31:13
she's probably already ringing your taxi
31:15
she's probably got a matching story
31:16
about the worst thing she's ever smeared
31:19
and he called me in to smell it it
31:20
wasn't
31:21
[Laughter]
31:22
the other cool thing about a lot of
31:24
these medicines that i really like is
31:25
that
31:26
um beyond all the kind of crazy names
31:28
they had some of them probably
31:30
worked better than a lot of medical
31:32
alternatives which were being touted by
31:34
real doctors i had doctors with medical
31:36
degrees at the time
31:37
right and that's why a lot of medicines
31:39
things like homeopathy in the 18th
31:41
century homeopathy was your best bet
31:42
because all the other medicines were
31:44
more likely to kill you
31:46
and likely to kill you quite fast um so
31:48
that i think has accounted for a lot of
31:50
uh alternative and complementary
31:52
medicine today still being popular is
31:54
that it
31:54
it had an initial lead yeah they used to
31:57
um call them snake oil salesmen they
31:59
still do
32:00
a little bit don't they yeah and i
32:01
remember reading that um actually snake
32:03
oil
32:03
is good for you if someone sold you some
32:06
snake oil
32:07
um it contains um 20 percent of
32:10
omega-3s which is a thing that people
32:13
like to take it's supposed to be good
32:14
for your heart
32:15
and um salmon uh which is one thing that
32:17
people do take for omega-3 only contains
32:18
18
32:19
so actually snake oil would do you a bit
32:21
of good the thing is all these
32:23
medicines is trial and error so you know
32:27
at the beginning of medicine time you
32:29
know trying some honey with
32:31
hedgehog hair you know you never know
32:33
you'd be like yeah just try that
32:35
yes yeah for your eyes probably as well
32:37
yeah well that's the thing when you're
32:39
in pain
32:40
you're a little bit delirious and you'll
32:42
turn to your ins you know
32:43
your friend or your your internet friend
32:45
just to go
32:46
what do i take and they'll just say oh
32:48
yeah just do that and you will do it
32:49
yeah there's um there's a group of
32:52
people in the
32:52
amazon who um they like to put snakes
32:56
down their
32:56
trousers to bite their penises which
32:58
gives them length and directions and i
33:00
wonder how they found that out
33:01
they're really just trying to cure their
33:02
runny noses that's what they claim
33:06
um i was reading a lot about placebos in
33:08
relation to sort of you know this kind
33:10
of medicine
33:10
and this is incredible there was a drug
33:12
introduced um
33:14
in the 70s called semetadine which uh
33:17
cured 80 of stomach ulcers um
33:20
now as time passed it fell to just fifty
33:23
percent of stomach
33:24
ulcers which occurred and this seems to
33:26
have occurred
33:27
after the introduction of rhinitidine
33:29
which is a competing and super it was
33:30
supposedly a better more effective drug
33:32
so people think that the placebo effect
33:35
of the initial drug
33:37
stopped working because doctors knew
33:39
there was another supposedly better drug
33:41
and that's why the success rate fell
33:43
because doctors
33:45
have also been tested giving medicine to
33:47
patients and half of them have said
33:48
i think this is a really good drug i'm
33:50
very excited about it it's shown really
33:51
well in trials
33:52
and half of them have said i'm not sure
33:54
about this uh but take it anyway see if
33:56
it doesn't be good
33:57
patients reported much less pain with
34:00
the first sample of doctors same pill
34:02
it's incredible wow yeah and placebo
34:04
injections are more effective than
34:05
placebo pills
34:06
because it's more dramatic intervention
34:08
it feels people culturally people think
34:09
that i wonder if placebo works with
34:11
all of these really weird things that
34:13
they did in the like the middle ages and
34:14
stuff like that
34:16
so like for instance in the 14th century
34:18
one reason one way that you could cure
34:20
impotence was to wear your trousers on
34:22
your head for 24 hours
34:25
it's hard to imagine the placebo effect
34:27
working there's not imagine finding
34:28
anyone who wants to have sex with you
34:29
after you've been walking around the
34:31
village all day with your trousers on
34:32
your head speak for yourself
34:34
the placebo effect doesn't always work
34:36
though um i was reading about um
34:38
greek philosopher heraclitus who spent
34:40
the last day of his life laying the sun
34:42
covered in
34:42
cow dung convinced it would cure him and
34:45
it didn't work um
34:49
from what friendship that worked
34:54
that was lovely um okay and uh we
34:57
got anything right or wrong are you
34:58
going out uh perfectly right um just to
35:00
add that it was until 1916 that you
35:02
could buy a cocaine and heroin at
35:04
harrods
35:05
um and i thought this is a joke or not
35:07
but in the article it said you could buy
35:09
gift packs of both to send soldiers
35:11
yeah wow i think that's true nice little
35:13
christmas gift
35:14
um i had fun when you were talking
35:16
watching the weirdest youtube video
35:18
i've ever seen about how to bottle your
35:19
fart so thanks for that
35:21
according to n maniac the way to do it
35:24
is to do it while you're in the bath
35:25
because that's how you can best direct
35:27
said fart to jar but what i quite like
35:29
to see began his video by washing out
35:30
the jar
35:31
um before he put the forks in oh yeah
35:34
you don't want to get that jar dirty
35:35
yeah i just want to quickly add that
35:37
from the website that i got the farts in
35:39
a jar from
35:40
uh there was a line at the bottom
35:42
talking about
35:44
because it gave examples of how it was
35:45
done and so on and it just says sounds
35:47
funny now
35:48
but the plague was no joke
36:00

=11
00:00
we run it on qi a few years ago yeah um
00:02
which was
00:03
there's no such thing as a fish there's
00:04
no such thing as a fish no seriously
00:06
it's in
00:06
the oxford dictionary of underwater life
00:10
it says it right there first paragraph
00:11
no such thing as a fish
00:17
[Applause]
00:22
hello and welcome to another edition of
00:24
no such thing as a fish
00:25
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
00:27
qy offices in covered garden my name is
00:30
dan shriver i'm sitting here with the
00:32
regular 3ls james harkin andy murray and
00:34
anna chazinski
00:36
and once again we've gathered around the
00:37
microphones with our favorite facts from
00:39
the week and we're about to go over them
00:40
in no particular order
00:42
here we go starting with fact number one
00:46
and that is andy's yeah
00:49
my fact this week is that the words tori
00:52
and
00:52
prime minister both started out as being
00:55
insults
00:56
wait so how would you what was the prime
00:58
minister called prior to a prime
01:00
minister the prime minister was
01:01
originally
01:02
uh not called that he was called the
01:04
first lord of the treasury
01:06
and the term prime minister was thought
01:08
to be an insult because it was as though
01:10
the first lord of the treasury was
01:12
putting himself above
01:14
other ministers and marking himself out
01:16
as in some way
01:17
better so the the one we call the first
01:20
prime minister robert walpole didn't
01:21
actually call himself prime minister
01:23
ever in lifetime and it took a very long
01:25
time i think it was
01:27
1905 before the phrase was actually
01:29
officially recognized
01:31
so i really like i i just like that a
01:32
lot yeah yeah and tories used to be a
01:34
word for a brigand or an
01:36
outlaw in ireland who noted for outrages
01:39
and savage
01:40
cruelty well that's quite a change of
01:42
meaning isn't it
01:43
yeah um most of them are not irish
01:45
anymore
01:47
but it was yeah tori is older than
01:49
conservative which i always thought was
01:50
strange because
01:51
tory sounds like the slang term for the
01:53
conservative
01:54
wic was also an insult i think wasn't it
01:56
it started yeah
01:57
yeah i meant a cattle cattle driver so
01:59
it seems like all the names that we give
02:01
to our politicians and political parties
02:03
are actually negative
02:04
have negative connotations but this got
02:06
me onto unparliamentary
02:08
language oh yeah what you can and can't
02:09
get away with in the house of commons so
02:11
um mps should not call other members
02:14
liars
02:14
suggest they have false motives
02:16
misrepresent what
02:18
another person has said use abusive or
02:20
insulting language
02:21
or describe another member as drunk
02:25
i can't do that but you can't get away
02:27
with loads of stuff
02:28
so um tony banks labour mp said that
02:31
margaret thatcher acted with the
02:33
sensitivity of a sex-starved boa
02:34
constrictor
02:35
he also described tory mp terry dicks as
02:38
living proof that a pig's bladder on the
02:40
end of a stick can be elected to
02:41
parliament
02:44
which is pretty rude not to be yeah
02:46
called up on it
02:47
was the famous one was it dennis dennis
02:50
skinner said that um
02:51
half of tory mps are thieves and
02:53
criminals
02:54
and he was told to take it back and he
02:56
said all right then half of tory mps are
02:58
not thieves and criminals
03:01
i don't know when we don't have more fun
03:03
political i guess we had the monster
03:04
raving looney party although i don't
03:05
know what's happened to that but other
03:06
countries have some super fun political
03:08
parties like the polish beer lovers
03:09
party
03:10
poland actually has some really good
03:11
parties um but yeah which won three
03:13
percent of the vote in 1991 could you
03:15
accuse that party of being drunk in
03:17
parliament i guess
03:19
that's the best thing i do like it when
03:22
um
03:23
just to take it away from politics for a
03:25
second um of taking
03:27
a word that was meant as an insult and
03:29
suddenly it becomes
03:31
the main thing and and famously that's
03:33
what happened with fred hoyle
03:35
when he was told about the theory about
03:37
how the universe began
03:39
from an explosion of a singularity and
03:41
so on and he was he's
03:42
he coined the term big bang but he said
03:44
it in a sort of oh well i guess it was
03:46
some sort of
03:47
big bang and he didn't agree with the
03:48
theory but everyone went big bang i'm
03:50
going to write that down
03:51
and go down to the press and it not only
03:54
helped
03:55
uh give it a name but it actually
03:57
popularized
03:58
it as a theory generally because it was
04:00
such a lovely term so the newspapers
04:02
picked up on it
04:02
and i've got his um his obituary up here
04:04
he died in 2001
04:06
he's a bbc news this is the opening
04:07
paragraph the english astronomer who
04:09
coined the term
04:10
big bang to describe the academic so
04:12
immediately it's the top
04:14
line of his life this one thing that he
04:16
didn't want anything to do with
04:18
do you think our insults have got worse
04:20
over the century i think like when you
04:21
look back over shakespearean insults and
04:23
age less proficient and beautiful yes
04:26
less interesting less imaginative
04:28
what's the thick of it i mean there's
04:29
always been a market for people who are
04:30
really good at
04:31
coming up with insulin actually that's a
04:32
good point um there is um
04:34
there's a dutch insult i can't pronounce
04:36
it
04:38
in palinville which translates as a
04:40
shit-filled eel skin
04:42
which means a skinny person it's
04:45
such an elaborate way of calling
04:46
something skinny i think we're slightly
04:49
running low on
04:50
insults at the moment because we're all
04:52
becoming quite aware of how actually
04:54
insulting they are i've got loads here
04:57
all right all right then top three
04:59
insults that you found
05:00
oh blimey all right the micronesian
05:02
island of yap
05:03
and in the appease language only about
05:05
6000 people speak it one of the most
05:06
serious insults you can dish out
05:08
is saying you have no foreskin
05:11
they have very big stones don't they in
05:13
the app but do they
05:14
yeah they're they're famous for um
05:16
instead of currency they have these
05:18
massive
05:19
massive like round millstones and you
05:21
can buy a house with them or and they
05:23
never move
05:24
because they're too big and heavy to
05:26
move but the ownership of the stone just
05:27
trying to just transfer from one person
05:29
to another
05:30
brilliant the cool thing about these
05:31
stones as well they're absolutely
05:32
massive we'll put a picture up
05:34
on the website it's not always the
05:36
biggest one that is most valuable it's
05:38
the one which
05:38
was the most difficult to get so if
05:41
someone died when they were trying to
05:42
get this
05:43
um stone no matter how big it was it
05:45
would be worth more than a massive one
05:47
which was
05:47
easily got wow size doesn't matter so
05:50
and the second
05:51
okay so yeah first one uh micronesian
05:54
island of the app you have no foreskin
05:56
second one i do like the
05:59
farsi curse which translates as may a
06:01
fart be on your beard
06:06
so that's great that's brilliant that's
06:08
so graphic
06:09
um and last one oh can i have it okay
06:11
you can have a tie for the last one
06:12
yes it's either the hungarian insult uh
06:15
[Music]
06:17
which translates as may a horse's penis
06:19
make its way into your bottom
06:22
or this is the one of the very worst
06:24
insults in argentinian spanish which
06:26
equates to calling someone's mother a
06:27
prostitute 60 million times over
06:30
wow translate says your mother who gave
06:32
birth to you twice
06:34
was a [ __ ] two thousand times over
06:35
squared so
06:38
well it's a mathematical insight yeah i
06:41
always think that um
06:42
learning insults in a language would be
06:44
a good way of starting to learn
06:47
yes i have this theory of learning
06:49
languages as in learning the vocabulary
06:52
which is first of all you go for the
06:54
insults because that's the one that
06:55
everyone wants to learn you know as soon
06:56
as you know
06:57
what your mother is are in a language
06:59
you want to use it all the time
07:00
the next one is you learn words that
07:02
sound slightly rude in english
07:04
because you're going to remember those
07:05
all the time and then you go from there
07:07
and i think that's a really good way of
07:09
learning vocabulary in languages it's a
07:10
very good way of learning it's not the
07:12
most appropriate way of starting a
07:14
conversation
07:14
in the early stages that's why the
07:16
guidebooks begin with like where is the
07:18
bag
07:19
hello nice to meet you it's not
07:22
your mother had sex with 2 000 squared
07:34
okay uh time for fact number two anna my
07:37
fact this week is that in
07:39
a 2005 questionnaire about substance
07:41
abuse
07:42
almost one in five respondents admitted
07:44
to taking a drug that doesn't exist
07:46
that's brilliant taking drugs will do
07:48
that to you yeah
07:50
so there's this drug called derbysol
07:52
which is a fake drug it's existed since
07:54
1974 and it's basically inserted into
07:57
surveys to test
07:58
if respondents are lying but it's kind
08:01
of interesting because it suggests that
08:02
people who are responding like students
08:03
who are responding to
08:04
questionnaires about how many drugs they
08:06
take just love to claim that they take
08:07
all the drugs
08:08
just constantly taking drugs even fake
08:11
ones i'm not sure if they take all of
08:13
them because um i saw that
08:14
it said like 5.6 percent of people in
08:17
one of the surveys i saw took
08:18
this um derbysol drug but only 3.6
08:21
used heroin so it's more popular than
08:23
him yeah but i guess that's because
08:24
heroin is more dangerous
08:26
yeah well much more dangerous than
08:27
something that doesn't exist
08:29
in fact derbysol is probably one of the
08:30
safest drugs you can take anyway yeah
08:32
it's been in questionnaires for like 40
08:33
years more than 40 years because people
08:35
noticed um that there were some fairly
08:38
implausible results coming through and
08:39
kids seemed to be taking
08:40
loads of drugs and they didn't see the
08:43
effects of those drugs in school they
08:45
were working perfectly okay they seemed
08:46
kind of
08:47
compass mentos but they claimed to be
08:48
taking heroin six times a day so they
08:50
suspected something dodgy was going on
08:52
and so they inserted this drug to see if
08:53
kids were just lying about what they
08:54
were
08:55
yeah well it's very very funny um so has
08:57
anyone actually made
08:59
the drug what's it called again derbysol
09:01
derbysol into an actual drug now because
09:03
it's obviously
09:04
that's quite a nice open market isn't it
09:05
they've had free advertising already
09:07
yeah
09:07
in all these surveys yeah it could be
09:09
anything because what's annoying about
09:11
drugs is that you're only going to get
09:12
like one brand of effect
09:13
aren't you it's a stimulant or
09:14
hallucinogenic but this could be all of
09:16
them whatever you wanted it to be
09:17
as used by 5.6 of american teenagers
09:20
yeah
09:22
there is something is not to be confused
09:23
with debris which is a wound cleaning
09:25
spray for pigs and sheep that dissolves
09:27
pus
09:27
you don't want to get those two mixed up
09:29
yeah but i imagine that would get you
09:30
really high
09:31
yeah the only other explanation for this
09:34
drug i should say
09:35
uh for the people who are ticking the
09:36
the derbysol box in south korea
09:39
derbysol is one of the trade names for a
09:41
drug which is used to treat eczema
09:43
psoriasis skin diseases so maybe
09:45
all the people at this school just had
09:47
some serious skin problems
09:48
and were korean but it was in texas
09:53
i guess it's hard to do surveys because
09:54
people just lie all the time don't they
09:56
yeah self-reporting is a massive problem
09:58
and especially all kinds of
10:00
slightly naughtier things like drugs or
10:02
sex or drinking or whatever it is people
10:04
misreport
10:05
wildly yeah i remember reading them a
10:08
survey of um how many sexual partners
10:10
people have had and apparently
10:11
the average man has had something like
10:13
30 sexual partners and the average
10:15
woman's had only seven
10:16
which means either everyone's lying or
10:20
there's one very promiscuous woman
10:24
um carl sagan was a pothead where he
10:26
said he was
10:27
andrew his widow who made the latest
10:30
cosmos series
10:31
is the head of a movement to get it
10:32
legalized in the states oh no does that
10:34
mean everything he's told us is just a
10:36
drug induced fantasy
10:37
i'm gonna have to scratch some of my qi
10:39
facts
10:41
um the same sort of thing winston
10:44
churchill
10:45
had the image of him always having a
10:47
tumblr of whiskey with him but
10:49
i think a lot of people reported that it
10:50
was very very watered down
10:53
there was so much ice in it and he drank
10:54
it so slowly that
10:56
he might as well not have been having
10:57
whiskey at all basically that supposedly
10:59
was the same as dean martin
11:00
his whole stage persona was to be this
11:03
quite
11:03
drunk slightly slurry kind of character
11:06
but apparently apple juice
11:07
was what he had earlier yeah when we're
11:10
talking about
11:10
how it's difficult to do surveys uh and
11:14
stuff like that
11:14
something came into my head i don't even
11:16
know if it's related but andy do you
11:17
remember the thing where
11:19
people had to do a survey um about
11:22
how they'd react if they were in
11:23
terrible danger
11:25
and they were on an airplane and they
11:26
were told the airplane was going to
11:28
crash
11:29
yeah yeah yeah i'm sure you researched
11:31
it it was to test the response to
11:33
stress i think the the the a load of
11:36
soldiers were loaded into a plane which
11:38
climbed to 5000 feet
11:39
and then stayed level for a few minutes
11:42
and then just shook them or
11:43
shook the passengers around lots um
11:46
and then told everyone that they're
11:48
going to they were going to die that
11:49
there was engine failure
11:51
and that they had to fill out forms for
11:53
any member of their family to get any
11:54
benefits after they died
11:56
and so they did their best but they then
11:58
compared the forms to ones that they had
12:00
filled out on the ground when they
12:01
didn't think they were going to die and
12:03
um we don't really know what they were
12:04
using this data for
12:06
yeah some of them got wise to it and
12:08
they wrote messages on the
12:10
on the air sickness bags saying don't be
12:12
afraid this is an experiment
12:14
you're not going to die what do other
12:15
people on the plane subjects yeah i
12:18
reckon if i got into an easyjet flight
12:20
and i looked at the sick bag and it said
12:21
don't be afraid this is an experiment
12:23
you're not going to die
12:26
i'd probably be more worried than if i
12:28
hadn't seen that message
12:31
[Applause]
12:35
okay time to move on to fact number
12:37
three this is my fact
12:38
uh i stole this fact actually from james
12:40
harkin who's writing the new qi book i
12:42
saw it over his shoulder
12:43
it is that sea otters have a secret
12:45
pocket in their armpit which they like
12:47
to keep their favorite stones in
12:50
and this can't be a secret pocket
12:52
because they lack the capacity to tell
12:53
anyone yeah it's not
12:54
espionage uh yeah so uh
12:58
the stones thing is really interesting
12:59
because they use them it's an actual
13:02
tool to smash stuff open they eat tons
13:05
of different kind of foods but there's
13:06
some shellfishy style foods where they
13:08
need to like smash it open which i think
13:10
isn't that quite rare that yeah not many
13:12
animals use tools
13:13
no no um let's think who uses tools uh
13:16
crows and jackdaws
13:17
have been tested and they definitely use
13:19
them um is it a tool
13:21
to use the ground i don't know because
13:23
there's a bird called lama guy which
13:25
lifts up
13:26
uh tortoises into the air and drops them
13:30
onto the ground yeah onto a particular
13:33
patch of
13:34
rocky stoney ground so i don't know if
13:36
that's using tools yeah i would suggest
13:38
you said a name just then that was the
13:39
philosopher who uh
13:41
so did he genuinely die from a well we
13:43
don't know exactly how he died but the
13:45
only evidence that we have is that
13:46
someone wrote that that's how he died
13:48
um no but he did supposedly die that way
13:50
didn't he yeah yeah
13:51
is that the only case in history of that
13:53
having happened to my knowledge oh yeah
13:55
there was a different case of an
13:57
asteroid killing a dog in egypt in 1912
14:00
but that's completely different
14:02
the only link is something falling on
14:03
something there were always rumors that
14:06
you
14:06
could uh die from effluent flushed out
14:10
of airplanes that's not true is it
14:12
frozen effluent it's not true no can't
14:14
happen in case anyone was scared well
14:16
what happens
14:16
is that people who live under flight
14:19
paths
14:20
will sometimes find blocks of ice and
14:22
it's
14:23
slightly miscoloured and they think it's
14:24
going to be frozen urine but what it
14:26
usually is is
14:27
the um planes have been flying very high
14:29
they get ice on the wings and then when
14:30
they come down the ice melts and it
14:31
falls
14:32
okay basically it does make you wonder
14:33
if you've got terrible food poisoning on
14:35
a plane if they have to on a long-haul
14:36
flight if they have to make an emergency
14:37
landing halfway there to unload
14:39
do you see that thing where 100 children
14:41
had like a vomiting and diarrhea
14:43
sickness
14:44
on a flight the other day it wasn't a
14:46
hundred was it not no
14:47
i think the choir was 60 but i think a
14:49
lot of them did go down with it it
14:51
wasn't all of them
14:52
they dispatched about four ambulance
14:53
teams in paranormal but imagine being on
14:55
that flight oh my god oh my gosh
14:57
and it i probably conflating it with
14:59
another fact which is the um there was a
15:01
baltimore
15:02
food safety conference a couple of weeks
15:04
ago and a hundred people who went to
15:06
that got food poisoning
15:08
brilliant wow um so let's talk about
15:10
otters shall we
15:12
hold hands that's all i know they hold
15:14
hands yeah so they don't float away
15:16
before they sleep
15:17
yeah let's put that up on the website
15:18
because everyone loves that video don't
15:19
that's really cute
15:20
not so cute is that they peel the skin
15:22
off poisonous toads in one piece before
15:25
eating the flesh so
15:26
they don't get poisoned from their skin
15:27
but that is a party trick
15:30
it's like i can peel an orange with one
15:32
hand
15:33
here's the thing uh if you get an orange
15:36
and put it in a bowl of water it'll
15:37
float
15:38
if you peel it and put it in a bowl of
15:39
water it'll sink wow well baby otters
15:42
can't dive
15:43
they're too buoyant really yeah that's a
15:45
thing that comes with age that they can
15:46
suddenly dive
15:47
there's been a bit of anti-otter
15:50
propaganda on the internet recently
15:52
i was reading and there was a a magazine
15:56
article on a magazine online magazine
15:57
called vox and it was
15:59
entitled the case against otters
16:02
necrophiliac
16:03
serial killing fur monsters of the sea
16:06
it was written by a guy called dylan
16:07
matthews and he said that otters are
16:10
jerks
16:10
he's missed the chance of calling them
16:12
rotters
16:14
they kill baby otters they have attacked
16:16
people
16:17
monkeys and alligators and they
16:19
sometimes copulate with dead otters
16:21
attacked alligators how did that go for
16:23
them successfully
16:25
okay this is that's very interesting if
16:27
he says that because the ancient greeks
16:28
had a theory or a belief that otters
16:30
killed crocodiles by scampering into
16:32
their mouths
16:33
and then eating all of their entrails
16:36
and then running out again when the
16:37
crocodile was dead
16:38
isn't that a great thing yeah it's a
16:40
brilliant idea but i mean it's
16:41
definitely not true
16:42
yeah i was reading about wombats and
16:45
wombats
16:46
have a pouch so similar to a kangaroo
16:49
okay
16:50
but wombats dig through the ground and
16:52
so
16:53
their pouches are upside down what yeah
16:57
so that they don't get any of the stuff
16:58
into there wouldn't the baby just fall
17:00
out no because i'm like a kangaroo
17:01
they're not vertical
17:02
oh yeah the one wombat fact i remember
17:04
is that they have cubic feces
17:06
they do have cubic feet they also um
17:09
have
17:10
incredible butts like their their asses
17:13
are insanely hard no they're they're
17:16
very interesting
17:21
they run into their burrow their hole
17:23
but they purposefully leave their butt
17:24
out and
17:25
nothing can penetrate it
17:26
[Laughter]
17:29
it's true yeah chris clement uh who's a
17:31
biologist from australia came on the
17:33
museum of curiosity last year and i'm
17:35
sure he mentioned this he did this is
17:37
this is where i first have it they have
17:38
a reinforced rump when a predator
17:40
attacks a wombat it runs into its burrow
17:42
and uses its tough cartilage-filled bum
17:44
to block the hole
17:46
i've also found that they apparently
17:47
they're further is very
17:49
coarse and wide so it would feel like
17:51
bristles to eat
17:53
which must be unpleasant for a predator
17:56
so try and buy it yeah i take it all
17:57
back yeah super buds
18:00
speaking of butts i read that uh turtles
18:03
breathe through their butts not all
18:05
turtles but a lot yeah some of them do
18:07
they urinate through their mouths they
18:08
do the whole the whole system has gone
18:10
haywire there
18:13
are you sure you just weren't holding
18:14
the turtle the wrong way around
18:16
so animals collecting stuff
18:20
um bower birds you guys familiar with
18:22
bauer birds
18:23
bowerburgs build these amazing
18:25
structures like these homes for their um
18:27
potential mate and then they collect
18:29
shiny objects or like nice looking
18:30
objects and they adorn it and it's
18:32
amazing
18:33
so you see them trying to seduce ladies
18:34
and they'll bring them like anything
18:36
they can find there's one i think
18:37
there's a video of one
18:39
keeps bringing this lady like a shiny
18:41
stone or a bit of sandwich or
18:43
a bit of cloth and the lady keeps
18:45
rejecting them and then eventually he
18:46
brings her a ring and she goes oh yeah
18:48
right then
18:49
no go for it yeah i'll put that on the
18:50
website that sounds very familiar
18:52
yeah the number of times when i was
18:56
courting my wife bringing her a little
18:57
bit of sandwich
19:01
[Applause]
19:04
okay and now it's time for a final fact
19:06
of the show and that's your fact james
19:08
yeah my fact is very simple this week
19:11
knobs have been made illegal
19:12
in vancouver they're quite right too
19:15
just going for the cheap laughs yeah so
19:17
doorknobs
19:18
obviously knobs of course yeah um and
19:21
illegal
19:21
um is a slight stretch it's when you
19:24
make a new house
19:25
in uh vancouver now it's um illegal to
19:28
put a doorknob on rather than a door
19:30
handle and that's to make it more
19:32
accessible which i think is quite
19:33
interesting like yeah
19:34
is it going to be the first place is it
19:36
going to be the rest of the world are we
19:37
going to be losing the doorknobs
19:39
no one will know what a doorknob is in
19:41
500 years yeah
19:42
but yeah but that's weird of of how
19:44
recent doorknobs are between victoria
19:46
and abraham lincoln would not have known
19:48
what a doorknob was really
19:49
yeah doorknobs only came in in the late
19:51
1800s the latches weren't there things
19:53
like that
19:54
yeah yeah yeah so if this works in
19:56
vancouver it could be that there was
19:57
only a 150 year period in the whole of
20:00
history where people had done that yeah
20:02
we were lucky enough to live in that and
20:04
they're blessed that's your theory about
20:06
landlines isn't it james
20:07
yeah the idea of having a telephone in
20:09
your house was it didn't happen
20:11
until the mid 20th century then hardly
20:14
anyone had it until the 70s and 80s
20:16
and then everyone had it for a few
20:17
decades and now it's everyone just has
20:19
mobile phones
20:20
no one has landlines and so in in 100
20:22
years they'll look back at only a
20:24
20-year period where everyone had phone
20:26
lines and it's going to look really
20:27
weird
20:28
yeah and they're still going to ask in
20:29
200 years why are they still putting
20:31
this on surveys
20:32
please insert your landline
20:36
stop putting that there so that that's i
20:38
mean that's a really good point
20:39
doorknobs
20:40
are effectively going to be a blip it's
20:43
a bit like
20:43
uh so that legislation reminds me of
20:46
it's like shabbat elevators isn't it and
20:48
israel now all new builds have to have
20:49
shabbat
20:50
elevated what is one of those because
20:52
under jewish law you're not allowed to
20:54
operate electronics on the sabbath
20:56
um they're lifts that go automatically
20:59
they also have schindler's lifts which
21:00
they can use as well
21:02
that's one of the world's three biggest
21:03
lift manufacturers really really
21:05
yeah that is i can't believe i didn't
21:07
know that that's amazing it's amazing
21:09
it's great
21:10
i read from the ignoble reporters that
21:13
supposedly lift music if you have a cold
21:17
it's a great cure for the common cold
21:20
lift music it was a scientific report
21:21
first of all we don't have any cure for
21:23
the common cold second of all
21:25
lift music yeah i'm only reporting
21:27
science guys people
21:29
people who listen to lift music got
21:30
better in two weeks people who didn't
21:32
took as long as 14 days
21:34
to recover on the hand on the doorknobs
21:36
thing um
21:37
i found a quote from someone who was
21:39
hostile to the idea because the reason
21:41
they did it was for the
21:42
for the elderly and an aging population
21:44
a lot of people have arthritis and the
21:45
sort of the twisting action of attorney
21:47
67 million um adult americans will have
21:50
arthritis by 2030
21:52
according to one service yeah so that's
21:54
very interesting and
21:55
i found someone opposing it saying well
21:58
bears will be very appreciative of this
22:00
change as an unlocked levador is an
22:01
invitation for snack time those round
22:03
knobs are tricky with claws
22:04
which kind of compares people who suffer
22:06
from arthritis
22:08
to bears i was reading this in the
22:10
economist
22:11
and one of the sentences they had was
22:13
the rules have provoked grumbling about
22:14
the nanny state
22:16
much of it from dawn of manufacturers
22:18
[Laughter]
22:21
i found another guy who was objecting
22:23
who was the president of the antique
22:25
door knob collectors of america
22:27
oh yeah but presumably he should be
22:29
happy because more of them will be
22:30
antiques yeah
22:31
exactly yeah it makes his collection all
22:33
the more valuable
22:34
yeah literally everything will be an
22:35
antique i was
22:37
looking at weird laws oh yeah um and
22:40
it's quite hard to find weird laws that
22:42
are actually laws rather than internet
22:44
myths obviously
22:45
but i do like the fact that in denmark
22:47
it actually is a legal requirement to
22:48
check under your car
22:50
for sleeping people or for people before
22:52
you start driving it
22:54
and if you do run somebody over because
22:55
they were sleeping under your car when
22:57
you started then you're going to be in
22:58
trouble for it
22:58
with insurance wow i don't know if this
23:01
is a common habit in denmark
23:03
people fall asleep on the cars all the
23:04
time that's very interesting
23:06
but uh it's a thing um and the other
23:08
thing is it is actually illegal in
23:09
thailand to go out in public without
23:11
wearing underwear
23:12
that's a thing um and i also like places
23:14
where it's illegal to die
23:15
which it isn't in the houses of
23:16
parliament although a lot of people
23:17
think that it is it's not illegal to die
23:19
in the house's parliament
23:21
you are free to go there and do that but
23:24
it is
23:25
you know just if you want to yeah um it
23:28
is illegal to die
23:29
in long year bayern which is in norway
23:32
yeah it's um in svalbard yes when you
23:36
say it's illegal to die there what are
23:37
the ramifications for you
23:40
i think once you've done the act i think
23:41
there are notifications for your family
23:43
so it's a little bit like that aeroplane
23:45
moment how much do you really care about
23:46
the family who are going to be punished
23:48
after your death
23:48
it's because they found out that bodies
23:50
don't decompose there corpses are
23:51
preserved by permafrost
23:53
um which i think james you might know
23:55
more about this is it's just to do with
23:56
their climate
23:57
yeah it's really really cold because
23:59
it's about as far north as you can get
24:01
right so basically they're like
24:03
cryogenically frozen
24:05
if you will do you think do you think
24:07
mount everest is our permanent
24:09
sort of it's the most likely spot that
24:11
future civilizations will find
24:13
people of our time because they're
24:15
frozen they're fully like when they
24:16
found mallory
24:17
oh yeah his whole body was there yeah
24:19
he's just laying there
24:20
um yeah the lut desert as well in in um
24:23
iran i think um maybe it gets so hot
24:26
that things won't decompose there
24:27
maybe i might i'm going that's amazing
24:29
though because you often think obviously
24:31
in cold things won't decompose but of
24:32
course
24:33
like um microbes are gonna die are gonna
24:35
not be able to live at a certain temp
24:36
certainly i was reading a guide to what
24:39
to do after civilization ends
24:41
yesterday and it recommended um plastic
24:43
bottles
24:44
to um you know the phrase sunlight is
24:46
the best disinfectant talk about
24:48
openness it turns out the sunlight also
24:49
acts as a disinfectant by killing
24:51
microbes
24:52
so if you want to have cleaner drinking
24:54
water put it in uh
24:56
plastic bottles let the light shine
24:58
quite firstly on it and the the
25:00
light and all the heat i'm not sure will
25:02
kill microbes
25:03
knowledge that's good hey what are you
25:05
doing that were you having a rough day
25:06
yesterday
25:08
i'm just finishing my plans speaking of
25:11
survivals
25:12
if we don't have darnobs anymore then
25:13
there are some things that they've been
25:14
useful for in the past that we won't
25:16
have anymore so
25:17
after the um tsunami the famous one in
25:20
um
25:20
southeast asia uh there was a guy called
25:22
rizal shah putra
25:24
and he got lost at sea um as if
25:28
many people did but he survived um
25:30
because he ate coconuts which he cracked
25:32
open with a doorknob which was also
25:34
floating past
25:35
so that was a really useful doorknob
25:37
that's great oh yes it only had a little
25:39
pouch in which
25:42
yeah between 1830 and 1873 over 100
25:46
u.s patents alone were for doorknobs oh
25:50
slight improvements on the doorknobs or
25:53
i guess it would be like the latch they
25:54
would be the in the toilets when you do
25:56
just that little turnover little bar
25:59
goes over
25:59
i mean i guess they count as doorknobs
26:01
don't they i think a knob has to be knob
26:03
shaped
26:04
yeah oh god then that's going to be an
26:05
exciting afternoon looking into what
26:07
those paintings were
26:09
there are still a lot of innovations
26:10
happening though i think they're working
26:11
on ones which
26:12
um in hospitals which dispense hand
26:14
sanitizer as you go through
26:15
wow so presumably they wouldn't do that
26:17
every time you open the door otherwise
26:18
you just have loads of hand sanitizer on
26:20
the floor and a lot of
26:21
people slipping and falling yeah but i
26:24
think that i think they have developed a
26:25
way of doing it so you can also
26:26
give yourself a quick hit of hand
26:28
sanitizer as you go through from one
26:29
room to another right it's pretty cool
26:30
at least when you're falling and
26:32
bleeding and your wounds are all open
26:34
you've
26:35
got a very sanitized surface to land
26:37
yeah in the absence of derbysol
26:39

which was
00:03
there's no such thing as a fish there's
00:04
no such thing as a fish no seriously
00:06
it's in
00:06
the oxford dictionary of underwater life
00:10
it says it right there first paragraph
00:11
no such thing as a fish
00:17

hello and welcome to another episode of
00:27
no such thing as a fish
00:29
a weekly qi podcast coming to you from
00:31
our offices in covent garden
00:33
my name is dan schreiber and the three
00:34
other elves joining me today are james
00:36
harkin anna czyczynski
00:38
and andy murray once again we're
00:39
gathering around the microphone and
00:41
we're going to share with each other our
00:42
favorite facts from the last seven
00:44
days so in no particular order here's
00:46
the best things we found out this week
00:49
james we're gonna start with you fact
00:51
number one okay um
00:53
my fact this week is if the new godzilla
00:55
existed
00:56
it would produce 12.9 million gallons of
00:59
urine a day
01:00
that's more urine than the exxon valdez
01:03
spilled oil
01:04
how many times does godzilla go a day
01:06
that's not one
01:07
bash is it well some animals go all the
01:10
time like voles i think just urinate the
01:12
whole
01:13
really they're just consistently
01:14
urinating well actually you're
01:15
consistently urinating but it's
01:17
uh your kidneys trickle out a milliliter
01:20
of urine every minute
01:22
but obviously you can store it in your
01:23
bladder but um bowls i'm pretty sure
01:25
they
01:26
they just always let it go and then
01:29
birds of prey can sometimes see these uh
01:31
tracks of urine and that's what helps
01:32
them find the voles
01:33
ah because they're just constantly
01:35
living leaving a piss trail basically
01:37
yeah
01:37
what's weird though right is that if
01:39
godzilla were if the new godzilla were
01:40
real he would take the same amount of
01:41
time to urinate as
01:43
the rest of us do right because he
01:44
hasn't new research showing that all
01:47
animals take roughly the same amount of
01:48
time to
01:49
to weak are we 21 seconds i think on
01:51
average
01:52
it's all mammals over a certain size i
01:55
think so i'm not sure that godzilla is a
01:57
mammal
01:57
did someone find out that most dogs
02:00
urinate
02:01
in the same direction yeah they face
02:04
north or they face west
02:05
is that true um well is it true that's a
02:09
good question
02:09
um i think it was dogs defecating uh
02:12
according to the earth's magnetic field
02:14
if i remember the study correctly um i
02:17
didn't look into it into too much detail
02:18
to see how true it is but
02:20
um yeah it was definitely claimed there
02:22
is an article online saying that
02:24
this is the headline dogs have a butt
02:26
compass which is the most
02:28
unpleasant phrase i've heard for a long
02:31
time yeah
02:31
less convenient to carry around than a
02:33
compass as well yeah
02:36
but it would be convenient if you were
02:38
lost with your with your dog
02:40
absolutely if you were for example going
02:42
to the north pole
02:43
and you lost your you lost your
02:44
compasses saying it's a featureless
02:46
environment you just have to look at the
02:47
dogs
02:47
but rover has taken a piss in that
02:49
direction it's true and if you had like
02:51
five or six dogs
02:52
and they all started peeing but they
02:54
were all facing
02:55
nuzzle to nuzzle yeah in a big circle it
02:57
means you're exactly
02:59
fantastic so we agree that godzilla
03:01
definitely isn't a mammal
03:02
originally godzilla the initial idea for
03:05
godzilla that it was half guerrilla half
03:06
whale oh really and that's where the
03:08
word godzilla comes from godzilla
03:09
is a combination and that's where the
03:11
name it's the two words smashed together
03:14
gorilla whale when they actually made
03:15
the movie they did make it into a a
03:18
reptile dinosaur
03:19
prehistoric sort of monster well one of
03:22
the guys wanted it to be a giant octopus
03:23
called udaco which is very close to
03:26
ocado
03:27
which would have been good okay and what
03:29
what what was it used and was it used in
03:31
godzilla versus no i was used to
03:32
delivered groceries
03:34
[Laughter]
03:36
in the 1954 one yeah um which is the
03:38
original yeah
03:39
the sound of godzilla roaring was made
03:43
by rubbing a leather glove up and down a
03:46
double bass
03:47
strings wow yeah that's strange i really
03:50
like lo-fi
03:51
yeah solutions to problems so yeah in
03:54
jurassic park the sound was i think
03:55
tortoise is mating
03:57
yeah the new godzilla is massive isn't
03:59
he like much bigger than the old
04:00
godzillas
04:01
okay i think that's interesting the
04:02
scaling up that happens yeah
04:04
over the years the bigger and bigger the
04:06
um website where i found how much urine
04:09
they produce
04:10
um was deepsea news.com and it was a
04:13
post by a guy called dr m i don't know
04:15
what his real name was
04:16
um and he as well as working out the
04:18
urine he also um worked out
04:20
how much bigger it's gotten in the last
04:23
50 years
04:24
and then the 1954 godzilla was 50 meters
04:27
tall
04:28
but the new godzilla is about 150 meters
04:30
tall
04:31
and his idea his theory is that the
04:33
reason that it's gotten bigger is
04:35
because skyscrapers
04:36
have gotten bigger and the godzilla has
04:38
to be big enough to crush the
04:40
skyscrapers
04:41
right it's quite interesting very
04:42
interesting yeah
04:44
that's um yeah it's adapting it's
04:46
evolution it's very fast evolution well
04:48
it could be evolution it could be
04:49
sexual selection so the lady godzilla's
04:52
like male godzilla's who can crush
04:54
buildings and so they have to get bigger
04:56
so that's suggesting that there is a
04:57
lady godzilla
04:59
or that this one isn't a lady i think
05:00
that in japan in japanese they just call
05:02
it it they don't
05:03
say it's male 1 also we've never known
05:05
if it was a male or female not to my
05:06
knowledge
05:07
i just think there's a general inflation
05:08
that goes on with the next film you have
05:10
to have something even bigger
05:11
and it's just yeah run away this guy
05:13
this guy worked it out
05:14
um that it's getting bigger on a
05:16
logarithmic scale and he said
05:17
if they do another one in 2050 then um
05:20
the godzilla will be 288.4 meters tall
05:23
do you guys know what uh godzilla
05:26
breathes out of his mouth
05:27
yeah isn't it doesn't he breathe like
05:28
nuclear clouds it's atomic breath
05:32
yeah it's not fire we all i thought it
05:34
was fire certainly you think everything
05:36
is
05:36
you think the sun is fire dan i cannot
05:39
believe that that is
05:40
i'd like to back them up i also still
05:42
think the sun is on fire um but yeah it
05:44
wasn't
05:44
wasn't godzilla initially a sort of
05:46
comment on hiroshima nagasaki that was
05:47
why it was uh it was had all these
05:49
nuclear comments
05:50
it was it's interesting that the way
05:52
godzilla is defeated
05:53
certainly in the last film is with
05:55
military weapons whereas the whole point
05:56
of godzilla is it's a metaphor for
05:58
nuclear bombs you know the most
06:01
devastating weapons we can come up with
06:02
so it's kind of missing the
06:04
point if you just attack him with
06:07
weapons
06:07
capable of dealing with so we should
06:09
have beaten him with like a peace treaty
06:11
yeah or like in the world of the world's
06:12
way the the aliens catch the common cold
06:15
do you think godzilla would have been as
06:16
popular amongst like 10 to 15 year old
06:18
boys if the second half of the film had
06:20
been like a potsdam
06:21
round the table peace treaty
06:25
oh just a load of people tried to sneeze
06:27
on him
06:28
sorry can you repeat your last demand
06:33
so what i really like about your fact
06:34
james which i know you enjoy doing and i
06:36
doing it
06:36
i like doing as well is the fact that we
06:38
when you get like an original fact
06:39
and you work it out and it reminded me
06:41
of uh you one i think you found in
06:44
one three three nine facts to make your
06:46
jaw drop which is that the statue of
06:47
liberty wears a size 879 shoes
06:50
so i have worked out the shoe size of
06:54
godzilla have you
06:56
no it's the 50 meter godzilla so it's
06:58
the original
06:59
so he wears uk size 1 680 shoes
07:03
which sounds weird because he's only a
07:04
little bit taller in fact the 50 meter
07:06
is is smaller than the statue of liberty
07:08
but he has bigger feet so there was a
07:10
press release at the time which
07:11
uh gave the measurements of his weight
07:12
did you say one six eighty one six eight
07:14
so in us that's one six seven nine yep
07:18
to get those started out yeah yeah
07:20
because the new godzilla is
07:21
um quite a lot bigger than the other one
07:23
a lot of japanese super fans are really
07:25
upset that the americans have just made
07:27
him fat
07:28
so godzilla's overweight yeah that's a
07:29
problem they're saying like it's fat
07:31
from the neck downwards and massive at
07:33
the bottom this is what um godzilla
07:35
superfan thumiko
07:37
abe told the afp at a tokyo exhibition
07:40
but then um they
07:41
they had the premiere i think a couple
07:42
of weeks ago and um gareth edwards who
07:45
we
07:45
have met who was gareth edwards came so
07:47
the director of the latest godzilla
07:49
movie was on museum of curiosity our
07:51
radio show
07:52
he told us at the time that he was going
07:54
to be doing godzilla but it wasn't
07:55
announced
07:56
oh did he yeah yeah i didn't remember
07:57
that very exciting um
07:59
but um they asked him at the premiere
08:01
what he thought about these
08:02
japanese people um saying that godzilla
08:04
got very fat
08:06
and he said i just think it's comments
08:08
like that that give giant monsters an
08:09
image complex
08:12
it's such a great comeback yeah
08:18
okay let's move on to fact number two
08:20
and that one's yours anna
08:23
yeah this is one of my favorite things
08:25
i've ever found it's that the real
08:27
long john silva from treasure island was
08:29
father to the real wendy darling from
08:31
peter pan the real long john silva
08:33
the guy on whom long john silva is based
08:36
a guy called
08:37
william ernest henley who was a poet and
08:39
he wrote the poem invictus is by far the
08:41
most famous thing he did
08:42
was that nelson mandela's favorite one
08:44
yes yes and barack obama quoted it
08:46
didn't he the last verse of it at his
08:48
funeral
08:48
uh mandela supposedly read it in prison
08:51
to everyone
08:51
and that got them all kind of you know
08:53
it's staying positive it's a fantastic
08:55
poem
08:56
so that's his most famous poem this guy
08:58
uh yes which
08:59
um just i don't know if this will ever
09:02
go in but i do really like the last
09:03
verse
09:03
which is it matters not how straight to
09:06
the gate how charged with punishments
09:07
the scroll i am the master of my fate
09:10
i am the captain of my soul um it is a
09:13
great poem
09:14
so that was the poem written by the man
09:16
who long john silva was based on
09:18
yeah that's right so he was this like
09:20
full of life guy had only one leg and
09:22
robert lewis stevenson just thought he
09:23
was this great guy wrote him a letter
09:25
after writing treasure island saying
09:26
i've got to be honest with you i based
09:28
long john silva on you um because i find
09:30
you
09:30
you know such an incredible chat has
09:33
anyone read treasure island
09:34
yes it's extraordinary that we've read
09:36
it at all because for a long time
09:38
no one read his books robert louis
09:40
stevenson was seen
09:42
as a just a terrible author to the point
09:45
that when
09:45
when in 1973 they published a 2 000 page
09:48
oxford
09:49
anthology of english literature he
09:50
wasn't mentioned in it at all
09:52
and now he's one of the 26 most
09:54
translated authors in the world above
09:55
edgar allan poe
09:56
and oscar wilde but for a long time no
09:59
one read him
10:00
bizarre i don't know much about him i
10:01
know he died on samoa
10:03
yes he's on their postage stamps and he
10:05
drank a lot of guinness
10:06
it's the only other thing i know about
10:07
robert lewis stevenson he had it
10:10
shipped out to him wow that's a long way
10:12
to ship out guinness yeah yeah i
10:14
remember i
10:15
tried to find the furthest um irish pub
10:18
from dublin and i reckon it's waxy
10:20
o'shea's in um
10:22
new zealand so even from there it's a
10:24
long way to samoa
10:25
yeah it must be strange having somebody
10:26
based on you years ago i researched a
10:28
guy called lord burners
10:29
oh yeah he was an early 20th century
10:31
aristocrat and eccentric he built one of
10:33
the last follies in britain you know
10:34
those towers that go nowhere and are
10:36
completely pointless he built one of
10:37
those
10:37
and then he put at the bottom of sign
10:39
saying members of the public committing
10:40
suicide off this tower do so at their
10:42
own risk
10:42
he was a very very funny guy but he
10:44
wrote a novel in which he based all of
10:46
the characters
10:47
on his friends but he also cast it as a
10:49
lesbian schoolgirl
10:51
story and one of the characters in it uh
10:53
sitwell was so angry that he tried to
10:55
buy every copy of this book
10:57
in circulation to destroy it that's a
10:59
really good way to get good sales isn't
11:01
it yeah yeah
11:02
yeah pretty much isn't that what alfred
11:04
hitchcock did when he uh released i
11:05
think it was psycho
11:06
he brought up as many copies of the
11:08
novel psycho as he possibly could
11:09
because he didn't want the ending to be
11:10
given away was it psycho yeah
11:14
you know the um do you know who psycho
11:15
is based on yes it's based on the texas
11:18
chainsaw mascara
11:19
it's based on the same guys the texas
11:20
chainsaw massacre it
11:22
silence of the lambs and psycho they're
11:24
all based on the same guy called ed guin
11:26
oh wow he was a big famous serial killer
11:28
a real gift to
11:30
you know screenplay writers thank you ed
11:34
but if you look at it one way
11:37
um it means there are fewer psychos out
11:40
there than you think if they're all
11:41
based on this same one guy
11:43
yeah yeah that's true yeah or he just
11:45
had such a
11:46
such a variety of fictional type quirks
11:49
there must be other psychopaths going
11:50
why do you get all the gigs
11:52
i'm doing some great killings yeah has
11:54
you won a single oscar no yeah
11:56
another example of the academy getting
11:58
it no um well sansa lam's one best
12:00
picture but he did
12:01
my point is was he invited to the
12:02
ceremony what are you wearing today ed
12:04
i'm wearing my mother the nipples of all
12:08
my
12:08
victims in a belt on a lighter note
12:13
uh yeah just to take us away from nipple
12:15
wearing when i was looking into long
12:17
john silver
12:18
i found a porn star who has a similar
12:20
one when you were looking into long john
12:22
silver
12:23
so his name's long dong silver and of
12:26
course
12:26
long dong silva he's a retired porn star
12:28
now uh but he was famed obviously for
12:31
the apparent size
12:32
of his penis uh which it turned out that
12:35
uh he was using a fake penis during the
12:38
shoots
12:38
which no one really knew about um he
12:41
persuaded a makeup artist who did the
12:42
makeup for the film the elephant man
12:45
to create a prosthetic i wonder if they
12:48
thought well you know we've got a trunk
12:49
here
12:56
no he's not physically an elephant man
12:58
what am i going to do with this trunk
13:01
do you think i should quickly explain
13:03
the um wendy connection
13:04
yeah so we don't um william henry was
13:07
the father to margaret henley
13:09
who was one of the girls who jm barry so
13:11
he loved playing with children he was
13:13
always
13:13
he loved spending time with children um
13:15
and he used to hang out in kensington
13:17
gardens and entertain the kids and tell
13:18
them stories
13:19
and margaret henley was one of the girls
13:20
who used to hang out there with him and
13:22
she was the person who called him wendy
13:25
wasn't she
13:26
wendy wendy wendy wendy which is where
13:29
um we think he got the name wendy for
13:30
peterborough is it right that wendy was
13:32
not a name before
13:33
he came up with it was a very popular
13:35
name at all but there are some examples
13:36
before him
13:37
the original title of the novel which um
13:39
peter pan first appeared in
13:41
was going to be the boy who hated
13:43
mothers he's pretty dark
13:45
oh yeah yeah um and jm barry was
13:48
nicknamed the furry beast by his friends
13:51
yeah yeah he was very very short and
13:53
very pursuit
13:54
he also uh loved to play qriket right
13:57
yeah
13:58
and this is extraordinary his cricket
13:59
team have you seen his cricket team ala
14:01
hackberries yeah
14:02
the people on it this was his team h.g
14:05
wells
14:05
rudyard kipling arthur conan doyle pg
14:08
woodhouse jerome k
14:09
jerome gk chesterton a.a milne and
14:12
others that was his cricket team and
14:14
others
14:15
but there's and there's plenty more very
14:16
famous there's so many but the thing is
14:18
they were they were a terrible team
14:20
and he printed a book of advice for them
14:23
um
14:24
which had little tips it was in 1893
14:27
like
14:27
don't practice on an opponent's ground
14:29
before the match begins this can only
14:30
give them confidence
14:32
or should you hit the ball run at once
14:35
do not stop to cheer
14:44
[Music]
14:46
okay time to move on to fact number
14:49
three
14:49
and that is i believe my fact my fact
14:52
this week is that the tinfoil hats that
14:54
conspiracy theorists wear
14:56
in order to stop the government from
14:57
sending messages into their brain
14:59
uh actually does the opposite it
15:01
amplifies the signal almost to the point
15:03
that if there were a thousand people
15:04
in a crowd and they were the one with
15:05
the tin foil hat that's the only brain
15:07
that would actually get the brain
15:08
messages it's like a huge antenna that
15:10
they're wearing how do we even know that
15:12
well it was a study by a bunch of
15:13
students in america who just wanted to
15:15
look into
15:16
the myth i guess because people were
15:18
doing it no one had actually
15:19
checked it out before and obviously we
15:21
don't know how to send
15:22
messages into people's brains or take
15:24
them out uh
15:26
as far as i know james is shaking your
15:27
head as if we do um we don't yeah but
15:29
they're working on it there's
15:31
been studies done in the last couple of
15:32
years where people have thought about a
15:34
word and
15:35
people have been able to work out what
15:37
word they were thinking about by
15:38
measuring their brain waves um but
15:40
they would work if they were made
15:41
properly right so they are meant to be a
15:43
faraday cage which stops um
15:45
like electricity passing through it if
15:47
it fully covered the head
15:49
and properly tightly fitted it then
15:51
electromagnetic radiation could not get
15:53
in but as it is
15:55
if it's worn loosely or designed as sort
15:57
of you know just a skull cap
15:58
then it gets in but i love the idea that
16:01
you would make one that was so good
16:02
that the government couldn't get in but
16:04
also then you would immediately
16:06
asphyxiate
16:09
uh did you guys know that the vatican
16:11
used a faraday cage in 2013 to shield
16:13
the sistine chapel from eve stop
16:14
eavesdropping
16:15
um so no one could hear who they were
16:17
electing as pope because there was a
16:19
i think in 2003 was it point before that
16:21
was elected
16:22
uh it was not there was a leak in
16:23
germany and so they put a faraday cage
16:25
in there
16:27
tinfoil uh cardinals
16:32
that's great have you guys heard of
16:34
stealthware this is
16:36
a company um who make clothes that make
16:39
the wearers
16:40
invisible to infrared surveillance
16:42
cameras particularly those on drones
16:44
so the idea is that you wear these
16:45
clothes and drones can't see you and
16:47
it's supposed to be make you safe say
16:49
you were being
16:49
infiltrated by the american government
16:51
who were looking at you with drones they
16:53
won't be able to see you anymore they
16:54
make uh hoodies they make full length
16:57
burkas in this kind of material
16:59
the burka goes for 2 300 the hoodie is
17:02
481 dollars
17:04
um but unfortunately due to the high
17:05
cost and limited availability
17:07
so far they've only sold one item a
17:09
scarf
17:12
i know where we should put all the
17:13
secrets in my neck
17:17
swallow them but not completely
17:21
speaking of um speaking of hats um
17:23
useful hats
17:25
um the following quote is from
17:27
radiologist
17:28
richard gerstel's 1950 book how to
17:31
survive an atomic bomb
17:33
he said if you are caught outdoors in a
17:36
sudden attack
17:37
a hat will give you at least some
17:39
protection from the heat flash
17:40
[Laughter]
17:42
when i say sun that's true you probably
17:45
could mathematically calculate how much
17:46
it gives you it's just that it won't
17:49
it will by no means save your life under
17:51
any circumstances
17:53
this is amazing no army at the start of
17:55
the first world war gave their soldiers
17:56
metal helmets
17:57
it took until 1915 and thousands and
18:00
thousands of deaths before they said
18:02
you know the german army had uh leather
18:04
just little leather caps called uh
18:06
pickle album
18:08
until 1915 did people start making these
18:10
helmets and we have the image of the
18:11
helmet from the first of all the kind of
18:12
shallow
18:13
again innovated for the first world war
18:15
um francis
18:16
galton who was i believe a um
18:19
a relative of charles darwin um he
18:22
invented a hat didn't he yeah it was a
18:23
hat that
18:24
had an air conditioning device in it or
18:27
a little flap that opened the top
18:28
because he had it was the idea that if
18:30
you thought too much about stuff your
18:31
head overheated
18:32
it does explain why my hair is always
18:34
synthetic
18:36
weird hats you mentioned when was it
18:38
dangerous to wear a hat
18:40
why am i phrasing phrasing this like a
18:41
cure question because i reckon that
18:43
you'll get it
18:44
when was it dangerous in stockpot you
18:46
used to be
18:47
you used to be attacked if you weren't
18:48
wearing a hat because they had the hat
18:50
industry
18:51
uh was quite big there and they thought
18:53
it was unpatriotic to the
18:54
to
19:02
but not as mean as the straw hat riots
19:06
so in the early 20th century in new york
19:09
past september the 15th it was socially
19:12
unacceptable to wear a straw hat it was
19:14
a summer item
19:15
um and if you wore a straw hat past
19:16
september 15th then it was
19:18
traditional for youths to come along and
19:19
knock your hat your head and trample on
19:21
it
19:21
and in 1922 it got out of hand so the
19:24
straw hat riot has decided to start
19:25
knocking people's house off their head a
19:26
bit early and i think they approached a
19:27
bunch of dock workers who are wearing
19:29
straw hats on september the 13th
19:31
not the hats off trampled them started a
19:33
fight huge fight riot lasted three days
19:35
bunch of people ended up in hospital
19:36
disaster and in 1924 a guy was murdered
19:39
for wearing a straw hat after september
19:40
the 15th
19:41
so it was a dangerous business actually
19:43
three days of fighting
19:44
three days of riots the straw hat riots
19:46
one last thing on conspiracy theories
19:48
okay i like the randomness of them
19:50
because they're often so connected but
19:52
often they
19:52
also have very strange outposts so i
19:54
found a list of conspiracy theories
19:56
online and this was 16 conspiracy
19:58
theories that
19:59
have been proved to be true someday
20:01
scientists will use millions of
20:02
genetically modified animals in
20:03
experiments
20:04
scientists all over the world are
20:05
creating bizarre human animal hybrids
20:08
obama is making government employees spy
20:09
on one another and
20:11
pro wrestling is fake
20:14
number seven on this list
20:17
[Music]
20:18
should we move on we're sorry sorry
20:20
sorry we were brothers and sisters
20:21
before
20:22
literary brothers and sisters and family
20:24
connections the guy who came up with
20:26
the first ever tin hat was julian huxley
20:29
who was the brother of aldous huxley
20:31
no yeah it was in a short story called
20:33
the tissue culture king
20:35
um about a scientist who is lost in a
20:37
jungle kingdom and he offers to culture
20:39
the king's flesh so the subjects can
20:40
worship him in their home
20:42
and then this allows the king to exert
20:44
telepathic power over the entire kingdom
20:46
and in that story he says we used caps
20:48
of metal foil which reduced the effect
20:50
on ourselves so it started as a fiction
20:52
wow that's great
21:01
okay uh moving on to our final fact of
21:03
the show and that is andy
21:06
my fact is that geese sometimes fly
21:08
upside down
21:09
to lose height quickly when they're
21:11
coming into land rather than
21:13
doing a long slow descent they just it's
21:15
like a shortcut for them like a life
21:17
hack
21:17
but the best thing is they flip their
21:19
body upside down
21:20
but their head and neck stay the right
21:22
way up so they do a twist
21:24
so that it just looks weird it looks
21:26
really bizarre you see the
21:27
the neck and the head are perfect you
21:29
know and then they've got this weird
21:30
upside down body
21:31
flapping away beneath them yeah and this
21:34
is called whiffling
21:35
so great i know he's the only animal to
21:38
do that
21:39
i think there are a few others which do
21:41
it the description i read is that they
21:42
it looks like they're a falling leaf
21:44
yeah
21:44
there's good footage which we can put up
21:46
online on the podcast page
21:47
um yeah and there are amazing photos of
21:50
it being captured mid-flight
21:51
yeah it looks brilliant yeah so i
21:53
started looking up
21:55
um things about flying upside down oh
21:57
yeah the planes which have flown upside
21:58
down there was that movie wasn't there
22:00
um
22:00
flight like denzel washington yeah the
22:03
robertson
22:04
i got distracted this fact should be a
22:05
lot better research but i got distracted
22:07
watching a 10-minute clip
22:08
from flight was it the bed at the start
22:10
where he crashes he flies upside down
22:12
yeah
22:13
did you see that boeing issued a
22:15
statement after um
22:17
after the film came out and they said
22:18
the md-80 cannot sustain
22:21
inverted flight the md-80 as with all
22:24
commercial airliners was designed to fly
22:26
upright so that's a bit you know you
22:29
remember that um plane that flew under
22:30
tower bridge
22:31
oh yeah remember that no yeah you must
22:34
remember it i remember the arc de
22:35
triomphe one
22:37
go on well in 1919 someone flew a
22:39
biplane
22:40
through the arctic tree off and the
22:41
ocean is big but it's not that big
22:44
and it was it was the wingspan of the
22:46
plane plus a maybe a meter on either
22:48
side wow
22:48
it's such cool footage and we can put
22:50
that up online yeah let's put that up
22:52
yeah it's amazing the um the guy who
22:55
flew under a tower bridge i was talking
22:57
about um
22:58
this guy was called hawker hunter and he
23:01
um flew under tower bridge on the fifth
23:03
of april 1968.
23:05
he did it as um he flew across the
23:07
thames as a demonstration against harry
23:09
wilson's government
23:10
um and he was struck off from the raf
23:12
for it i think and um
23:14
weirdly there was a quote from him um
23:16
when they asked him about it and he said
23:18
he was he was flying down the thames and
23:21
he said
23:22
until this very instant i had absolutely
23:25
no idea that of course
23:26
tower bridge would be there
23:30
where did he think it was going to be i
23:32
don't know
23:33
just going back to animals in the air
23:35
very quickly so
23:36
uh geese flying upside down um this is
23:38
something that i've
23:40
i've found out weeks ago and i've
23:41
mentioned it to you guys a bunch before
23:42
but we haven't said it on the podcast
23:44
uh it's about ladybirds this i mean this
23:46
really surprised me that recent
23:48
research has shown that ladybirds who
23:51
were thought to have only
23:53
flown at a height of say our shoulders
23:56
an average human's
23:57
shoulder height actually have been found
23:59
flying at the height of 3600 feet
24:02
and they travel as fast as 37 miles per
24:05
hour
24:05
and they can go as far as 74 miles in
24:08
one journey
24:09
yeah do you know how they find them what
24:11
do you mean well they
24:12
they originally found this out because
24:14
obviously you've got you've got to be at
24:16
that height to find one so they sent up
24:19
planes with
24:20
sticky panes and saw what they got that
24:23
was very early experience that was
24:24
biplanes
24:25
when you try to swat a fly you know how
24:27
you try to swat it and you're definitely
24:29
going to get it it looks badly conscious
24:30
and then it gets away and you don't
24:32
understand how and apparently this is
24:34
because
24:35
the moment they see you coming they do a
24:36
somersault rather than just falling and
24:38
that speeds up their descent
24:40
so they just drop into a somersault you
24:41
can sort of imagine it and i wouldn't be
24:42
able to explain the physics maybe you
24:44
would
24:44
um and then the they you know pick pick
24:47
up the air with their wings and fly away
24:49
that's so cool
24:50
a little somersault tennis racket that's
24:51
what you need because they can avoid
24:53
most of the strings but they can avoid
24:54
all of them
24:56
good sorry to bring them down unlike
24:58
tennis balls in my experience
25:01
every time i hit it i do a little cheer
25:03
and then forget to run
25:05
and this might seem unrelated but on
25:07
geese can we go on
25:09
i would almost say that's completely
25:10
related
25:13
um goose grabbing was very popular as a
25:14
sport in 17th century new amsterdam
25:16
which obviously became new york and the
25:18
way it worked was you smear the neck of
25:20
a goose with soap or something slippery
25:22
and you hang the goose upside down
25:23
and a bunch of competitors ride towards
25:25
it on horses and the aim is to try and
25:27
rip its head off oh
25:28
sorry do you remember we did what uses a
25:30
goose on qli
25:31
yeah remember that we came up with loads
25:33
of different things that you can use
25:34
geese for oh yeah because they were used
25:36
as guard dogs in ancient rome and
25:38
and various different they used to turn
25:40
spits in the kitchen just grab the
25:42
handle
25:42
and turn it around slowly in the kitchen
25:44
that's great yeah
25:46
have you heard of the goose crusade it
25:48
was during the crusades and there was a
25:50
group of crusaders slightly
25:51
mad they somehow managed to believe that
25:54
a goose was filled with the holy spirit
25:56
and so they worshipped him and used him
25:58
as a guide
25:59
to find their way to jerusalem check the
26:01
compass direction every time he did a
26:03
little goose poo that should be east
26:08
wow that i'm still stunned by that cruel
26:10
the cruelty of that
26:12
yeah well when james mentioned the goose
26:13
rebellion i thought what was it called
26:14
the goose crucifixion
26:16
why didn't they call it a goose because
26:18
that is some kind of disgusting drink
26:20
they mean
26:21
oh god foreign if life gives you geese
26:26
make goose age

levin
00:55

00:57
have a show out there called skyra and
00:58
the creation
00:59
which is a panel show yeah in which you
01:01
have sort of comedians as well as
01:02
interesting guests from all sorts of
01:04
categories
01:04
wine tasters that's one i saw yeah yeah
01:07
it's a panel show
01:08
it's much like ui you know i think i
01:10
secretly i want to make ui in belgium
01:13
now i have to find a channel that wants
01:14
to host it i just remembered you got to
01:16
headline the gig at cern right yes that
01:18
was last summer i i
01:20
was performing at cern which was
01:21
absolutely amazing being a physicist
01:24
stand-up comedian yeah i could do all my
01:26
geeky jokes
01:28
that's great um all right shall we kick
01:30
into it should we get fact number one on
01:32
the way
01:32
okay fact number one we're going to
01:34
start with you levin
01:35
yes my fact is that during the second
01:38
world war
01:38
the nazis employed two official nazi
01:42
comedians
01:42
that's a starter shake yeah they were
01:44
called tran and helle
01:46
and they did funny sketches and and i
01:48
think tran was was the fat stupid one
01:50
and then heller would be the
01:51
the perfect man there's a few still on
01:54
youtube
01:55
but i must warn you they are utterly not
01:57
funny
01:59
and so surprising yeah nazis and well
02:02
they all they all have this war
02:03
propaganda scenarios like i remember one
02:06
where tran
02:07
was sitting in his living room and he
02:09
was reading a biography of churchill
02:11
that was given to him by his jewish
02:13
neighbor
02:14
but luckily hell arrived and said tran
02:16
what are you doing
02:17
that's all lies and that was about it
02:20
that's the punchline this is why central
02:22
government shouldn't get involved in
02:24
comedy writing
02:25
yeah that's right never works but they
02:27
they stopped these
02:28
shows before the end of the war because
02:31
the german people watching this were all
02:32
sympathizing with with
02:34
the stupid fat guy and not with this
02:36
impossibly perfect
02:38
helle and they were even the the stupid
02:40
comedian was banned from the nazi party
02:43
because of this yeah they're really not
02:45
funny are they i watch one of them which
02:46
sounds really similar about where he's
02:48
listening to the radio and he's being
02:50
told by
02:50
heller um to not listen to western
02:53
broadcast and he trans says
02:55
i think i can make up my own mind about
02:56
what's the truth and what's not and
02:58
hello goes no no you can't you don't
02:59
understand you wouldn't understand any
03:01
of this you can't you have to be told by
03:02
the state what's right and wrong and
03:03
when you're watching it you're going
03:05
well this tall guy who's saying you have
03:07
to be told by the state what's right and
03:08
wrong is obviously the bad guy here
03:10
and clearly i like the short fat bloke
03:11
who's going can i just listen to
03:12
whatever program i want please
03:14
so it was bizarre that they didn't
03:16
realize that they didn't come con
03:17
yeah sometimes they try to do a
03:19
punchline and well
03:21
it's always a bit pathetic when they're
03:23
trying yeah even more when
03:24
when when there's no punchline i
03:26
remember one where um tran
03:28
was was using all his red coupons even
03:31
though he didn't need
03:32
them and he had all this old bread in
03:33
his kitchen and then hella was coming
03:35
you can't do this and then what do you
03:37
do with it well i give it to the chicken
03:39
you can't give it to the chicken and the
03:41
other germans need this bread and
03:43
this war is hard on everybody and then
03:45
hella says but what about the chicken
03:47
and that was it again you totally
03:50
sympathize with the chicken when you
03:51
listen to that
03:52
it's a really endearing perspective war
03:55
was hard on the poultry
03:57
it's interesting in wartime how comedy
03:59
is used
04:00
in in propaganda like i was really
04:02
shocked by the number of walt disney
04:04
and and warner brothers cartoons that
04:06
were made featuring hitler and bugs
04:08
bunny in the same reality yeah yeah
04:10
yeah there was there were scenes of
04:11
daffy duck on the top of of hitler
04:13
smacking his face and
04:14
knocking his mustache off him and stuff
04:16
i found i found uh
04:18
anti i found german anti-nazi jokes from
04:21
the war i found them very interesting um
04:23
so one joke in berlin during the last
04:25
months of the war was that in berlin the
04:27
optimists
04:27
are learning english and the pessimists
04:29
are learning russian um
04:32
another one um two people converting one
04:34
says what what are you going to do after
04:36
the war ends
04:37
well i'm going to finally go on a
04:38
holiday and i'll take a trip around
04:40
greater germany
04:41
oh yeah what are you gonna do in the
04:42
afternoon that kind of thing
04:44
some of them kind of still still funny i
04:47
think um
04:48
when the raf is in the skies the germans
04:50
take cover when the luftwaffe is in the
04:51
sky the allies take cover
04:53
when the us air force is in skies
04:55
everyone takes cover
04:56
which you know kind of still applies but
04:59
the nazis banned
05:00
apes from making the hitler salute yeah
05:03
on pain of death
05:04
for i think both ape and the person who
05:06
trained the ape during the early 30s
05:08
there were a lot of
05:08
uh satirical comedians who made fun of
05:11
the hitler salute
05:12
and what some trait some animal trainers
05:15
in circuses trained their
05:16
apes to give a hitler yeah they dangled
05:18
the food wouldn't they so that they had
05:19
to just reach their arm yeah
05:21
and the nazis unsurprisingly took quite
05:24
a dim view of that and then made it
05:25
punishable by death by death yeah
05:27
were any apes ever executed do you know
05:30
i don't know
05:31
i got it from a book about humor in
05:32
hitler's germany and i i haven't found
05:34
any
05:35
concrete examples
05:38
i think 10 years ago a man was arrested
05:41
in germany for training his
05:42
his dog to do the hitler salute really
05:45
yeah that's quite impressive
05:46
10 years ago i think and he had trained
05:48
him and he was walking around the park
05:50
and every time he
05:51
he would he would pass a foreigner he
05:53
would uh command his dog to do a hitler
05:55
slip
05:56
wow fair enough arrest him yeah yeah
05:58
absolutely um i read
06:00
that um did you know england in 2004 had
06:03
a state
06:03
gesture no yeah it was a state chester
06:06
it's a guy called nigel roder
06:08
and he won a competition to become the
06:11
official uh
06:12
state chester but there was too many
06:13
complaints so he got his
06:16
title removed what were they complaining
06:18
about oh well the
06:19
sour grapes that i think they haven't
06:20
been given yeah yeah uh
06:22
it basically said that the english
06:23
heritage should not be allowed to use
06:24
the title of state chester a lot of
06:26
people are just like you can't he can't
06:27
be the state chester
06:28
we're all jesters well it's not it's
06:30
less funny when it's a state
06:32
comedian as well apparently eric idol
06:35
says that prince charles asked him to be
06:36
the official court jester
06:38
and he said no the mayor of reykjavik is
06:40
a stand-up comedian
06:41

06:58
ice bear in the iceland zoo well the

zoo at this point only has i think a cow

07:41
so you know could be it could be a
07:42
running thing could be
07:44
um we should move on james uh before we
07:46
do have you got any
07:47
facts you want to chuck in you were
07:49
talking about the walt disney and warner
07:51
brothers
07:51
um propaganda um donald duck was in de
07:54
fuera's face
07:56
where he breaks down after experiencing
07:58
a nightmare where he has to make do with
08:00
eating ridiculous
08:01
nazi food rations such as a smell of
08:03
bacon and eggs
08:05
coffee made with one bean and a slice of
08:07
stale bread
08:08
wow and then commando duck donald duck
08:12
by himself destroys an entire japanese
08:14
air base
08:15
that sounds amazing uh anything else
08:17
yeah levin was talking about the um dog
08:19
who is doing the hitler salute
08:21
um i found it on the daily mail website
08:24
uh under the headline howell hitler
08:27
and they arrested this guy whose dog was
08:30
doing the hitler salute
08:32
and uh spokesman eva marie konig said we
08:35
are retraining him to stop him raising
08:37
his leg too high he doesn't have
08:39
anything that would make him interesting
08:40
to right-wing extremists
08:42
however we think he will quickly find a
08:43
new owner because he is so famous
08:47
[Applause]
08:51
okay time for fact number two this one's
08:54
my fact
08:54
um so this fact is that the philippines
08:57
basketball association which is the
08:59
second oldest in the world after the nba
09:01
have 10 teams in total and their names
09:04
include
09:04
the rain and shine elasto painters the
09:07
san
09:08
miguel biermann and tolkien tech's
09:10
tropang texters
09:12
so it's a lot of teams with no integrity
09:14
at all just
09:15
selling out constantly well that's just
09:16
how it's done there it's not selling out
09:18
it's just
09:18
that's that's the way that they are like
09:20
if you watch boxing matches these days
09:22
most boxers have
09:23
adverts painted on their back there's a
09:25
guy in america who's who's selling his
09:27
last name now so
09:29
so companies can can bid and the highest
09:31
bidder
09:32
will be the company name that will
09:33
become his official last name right he
09:35
did it last year for one company and now
09:38
he's called
09:39
i don't know james mcdonald's or
09:40
something and now he's doing it again
09:43
because it was only for one year
09:44
and i think he he gets some fifty
09:46
thousand dollars out of it
09:47
how do i think the only benefit for
09:50
these companies is in the
09:51
newspaper coverage that the man is
09:53
changing his name because no one
09:55
sees you know kevin budweiser and thinks
09:57
i must go and have a beer
09:59
we had a we had a football team in in
10:01
belgium which was
10:02
sponsored by quick quick is the belgian
10:05
uh the belgian mcdonald's like burger
10:07
king
10:07
and uh they had one player called
10:09
mcdonald's and so
10:11
he was running on the field with this
10:13
quick logo on his back and then
10:14
mcdonald's
10:17
when i was looking into the filipino
10:18
basketball stuff um because they it's a
10:20
huge sport there they absolutely love it
10:22
um but i suddenly remembered that dennis
10:24
rodman had been out there
10:25
a few years back dennis rodman was in
10:27
the chicago bulls um
10:29
he famously was married to carmen
10:31
elektra and he's been most notable in
10:32
the news recently
10:33
because of his relationship with kim
10:35
jong-un but um
10:37
when he went out to uh the philippines
10:39
to play in sort of one of those
10:41
americans versus the philippines
10:43
uh basketball matches he met up with his
10:45
estranged dad
10:46
who he hadn't seen for 40 years who's
10:48
been living in the philippines for all
10:50
these years he's had
10:50
29 children to 16 different wives
10:54
and his name this is his birth name
10:56
philander
10:57
spelt exactly the same just exactly the
10:59
same it's philando rodman he lives out
11:01
there
11:02
and he runs his own burger shop which is
11:04
called rodman's rainbow obama burger
11:06
restaurant
11:07
in which you can get different colored
11:09
buns and apparently they're really good
11:10
burgers
11:12
try them out they're are really good
11:13
names all over the philippines i think
11:15
the uh the president and his sisters
11:16
have nicknames including pinky
11:18
nunu and ballsy well there's the classic
11:20
cardinal sin
11:21
who was the main cardinal for years he's
11:24
i think he's passed away
11:26
yes he died a few years ago yeah yeah
11:28
there are amazing sports names all over
11:30
the world though they're so fun
11:31
remember i think in 2005 there was a
11:34
sudden rush on sales of the
11:36
peruvian football team deportivo wankers
11:39
shirts
11:40
in britain and there's a quote from the
11:42
club spokesman who just came over and he
11:44
was like it is very strange everyone in
11:46
britain seems to think we have a funny
11:47
name
11:50
the wanker are just like the peruvian
11:51
peoples it's not a funny word they
11:53
decided to when they were in danger of
11:55
being relegated they decided to change
11:57
their football ground
11:58
to the highest town in the world which i
12:00
think is called cerro de pascoe and i
12:02
probably haven't pronounced that right
12:03
but
12:04
it is 400 meters above sea level and
12:06
normal people can't really breathe there
12:07
or do anything and so obviously these
12:09
guys are used to it
12:10
so and they were accused of cheating
12:11
because whenever a football team came to
12:13
play them they all just kind of started
12:14
collapsing
12:16
meltdowns yeah they still got relegated
12:18
so it did not work well it's amazing
12:20
my favorite basketball effect is
12:21
somewhat the same it's
12:23
the spanish basketball team had to
12:26
return their gold medals of the
12:27
paralympics
12:28
in 2010 because their iqs turned out to
12:31
be too high they had a basketball
12:33
competition for the
12:34
uh or whatever intellectually call it
12:38
and so the spanish completely cheated
12:40
for being well for having too high and
12:42
like too high in iq
12:44
that's amazing which is not normally an
12:45
accusation level that many sports people
12:48
i'm sorry that's the boy who was picked
12:50
second last speaking
12:52
consistently for 13 years of school do
12:54
you know the the
12:55
um the guy who invented basketball john
12:58
naysmith his middle name is
12:59
a and they don't know what his middle
13:01
name means and the family have said we
13:02
think he just put it there
13:03
like president uh ulysses s grant
13:06
yeah yeah possibly it's just an s isn't
13:09
just an s yeah yeah
13:11
but one of the discoveries that they've
13:12
made about this guy is the influences
13:14
that they reckon that led to the
13:16
creation of basketball including a game
13:18
called
13:18
has anyone heard of this duck on a rock
13:20
is it anyone who's done it i've seen
13:21
that referenced as being one of the
13:22
inspirations but what is it so the idea
13:24
was that you would have a bunch of kids
13:25
playing it you would have
13:26
a rock a big stone on a tree stump and
13:29
that would be the duck
13:30
and you had to knock the duck off the
13:33
rocks one person had to stand
13:35
and protect the duck and make sure it's
13:38
not knocked off the stump
13:39
the way you knock the stone the big
13:41
stone off the stump is by throwing rocks
13:43
at it
13:44
big rocks so effectively it's a kids
13:46
game where you were having stones
13:48
chucked at you in order to protect
13:50
another stone
13:51
so this is this is what uh james
13:53
naismith played as a kid
13:54
that led to him partially inventing
13:56
basketball i think that sounds fun
13:58
really yeah stones i'd have a size limit
14:01
on the stones you could throw
14:02
they used it so he used a peach basket
14:04
at first and they kept using that was in
14:06
1891 they kept using peach baskets until
14:08
1906 i think but they realized really
14:10
early on to drill a hole in the peach
14:11
basket and then you'd poke a stick up
14:13
through the hole so you can poke the
14:14
ball out
14:15
when you figured out that you can make a
14:16
hole and then
14:18
yeah let's just make a small one yeah
14:20
just for a stick that's big enough i
14:22
think it might have been though
14:23
apparently he had a really
14:24
tense relationship with the school
14:25
janitor because of all his peach baskets
14:27
and he kept on having his peter baskets
14:29
with holes in them so i think maybe it
14:31
was
14:31
like to appease the janitor he was like
14:32
okay i'll just do a small one so a hole
14:34
that's big enough for a stick but not
14:36
big enough for
14:36
a peach yeah
14:40
that makes sense in japan they like to
14:44
turn games into unofficial sports i i
14:46
only i read it today that they have
14:48
official rules for pillow fighting now
14:51
so they have and there's a there's now
14:53
an official pillow fight association of
14:56
japan
14:56
there's a referee so there must be rules
14:59
and i think it was a japanese guy who
15:01
once tried to get
15:02
hide and seek as an official olympic
15:04
game
15:05
[Laughter]
15:06
that's correct other ones we had on the
15:08
show were toe wrestling
15:10
yeah and then of course there's the very
15:11
famous i think it's even british
15:13
the very famous sports called ferret in
15:15
your pants
15:18
what is it well it's very simple you
15:20
have to you have to close
15:22
um your your trousers at your ankles and
15:24
then you have to put a ferret in your
15:26
pants
15:27
and then you have to close uh the
15:29
trousers around your waist and and
15:31
well then you just wait then you have to
15:33
wait and just wait for the rest of your
15:34
life and you have to set a world a world
15:36
record
15:36
and ferrets ferrets normally bite and
15:40
they don't let go so the best way to do
15:43
this
15:43
is to wait until it bites and of course
15:46
they like the soft bits more
15:48
they say don't pull them loose because
15:50
they will bite again just
15:51
leave it yeah just cope with the pain
15:54
it's very easy to say that isn't it yeah
15:55
just
15:56
just leave it it's fine what are you
15:57
complaining about it'll get worse if you
15:59
pick it yeah
16:00
and the world champion is very proud
16:02
that after his world record he he had
16:04
three more kids
16:06
oh wow yeah that's pretty impressive um
16:09
all right let's uh we should wrap up on
16:10
this one james have you got anything to
16:12
add
16:12
um the guy who sold his name that levin
16:15
was talking about is uh
16:17
jasonssurfwrap.com
16:19
formerly known as jasonheadsets.com
16:22
i'm not sure what his name was before
16:24
that i was looking for the rules of
16:25
pillow fighting
16:26
i found the pillow fight league of
16:28
toronto and they have a few rules there
16:30
rule one is
16:31
women fighters only no exceptions
16:36
and the last rule is loading a pillow
16:38
with a foreign object such as a brick is
16:40
strictly forbidden
16:43
and then just finally i found a
16:44
newspaper article from 1992
16:47
about ferrets this was in the town of
16:49
newtown in mid wales
16:50
this is a group of vigilantes and
16:52
they've had a lot of crime in the area
16:54
and they said our plan for keeping
16:56
lauren order is simple
16:57
anyone we catch in the act of committing
16:59
a crime will frog march off to the hills
17:02
where there's no one to hear the screams
17:04
we'll hold him down
17:05
and slip fred into his trousers
17:14
okay let's let's uh move on to fact
17:17
number three and anna that's your fact
17:19
yeah my fact is that if you get a zebra
17:21
fish drunk
17:22
and put him in a tank with other zebra
17:23
fish the sober ones will follow him
17:25
around
17:25
in a conga line um
17:30
yeah um so yeah they brought so the way
17:33
they
17:33
they've made zebrafish drunk before
17:34
they're quite useful fish to study
17:36
because they're translucent so you can
17:37
see what's going on in their bodies
17:38
without having to slit them open
17:40
um but the way they do it is they put
17:42
drop alcohol into their tanks and then
17:44
they take the zebra fish out of the
17:45
alcoholic
17:46
tank drop it in with other zebrafish and
17:47
another one and yeah turns out they all
17:49
follow him around
17:50
and why are they following they're not
17:52
entirely sure so if you get a zebra fish
17:54
it's just like humans really they get
17:55
more lively and they move faster and
17:58
they seem not as afraid of threats and
18:00
stuff
18:00
and so everyone just followed him about
18:02
he seems like a cool guy follow that
18:04
fish
18:04
yeah follow that fish with no food of
18:07
ours now
18:08
we're still here in the town okay um i
18:11
read a story about a drunken moose
18:13
um they found it in a entangled in an
18:15
apple tree
18:16
uh yeah so i saw the pictures yeah did
18:19
you amazing photo
18:20
yeah yeah it happened in sweden right
18:21
yeah it's an amazing photo how did i get
18:23
drunk i got drunk off eating apples
18:25
so the apples were fermented but it
18:27
happens a lot that animals get drunk
18:29
from eating fermented fruit there was
18:30
once a documentary where they
18:32
where they were showing a um a drunk
18:34
elephant and then afterwards turned out
18:36
that the documentary makers just
18:38
made him drunk just gave him alcohol wow
18:41
there's a there's a
18:42
there's a myth that elephants drink um
18:45
that they get drunk
18:46
from the amarula fruit which comes from
18:49
the marula
18:50
tree um and it i've i've found that it's
18:53
probably not true unfortunately well
18:55
unfortunately unfortunately either way
18:56
but that they would have to eat so much
18:59
of the fruit
19:00
and also they eat i mean every every
19:02
animal near near a marula tree loves the
19:04
fruit so they eat it as soon as it drops
19:05
some elephants even push over the trees
19:07
to get to the higher fruits
19:09
so it would be far too quick for it to
19:11
ferment into enough alcohol
19:12
is it a myth about koalas and eucalyptus
19:15
do they get high
19:16
dolphins get high on a by chewing puffin
19:20
fish
19:21
really yeah a puffin fish has has a
19:23
poison that comes out so
19:25
it when when it when it's bitten it
19:27
blows up and and it ejects a poison
19:29
and dolphins are are big enough so they
19:31
just get high
19:33
and when they find a puffin fish they
19:34
they they hand it to each other
19:37
like students with joints yeah it's just
19:41
yeah they hand it to each other and then
19:43
they hang upside down in the water in
19:44
their cheeks
19:45
they're just tripping wow dolphins have
19:48
is there footage of that one
19:49
yes it is
19:52
and it was it was seen for the first
19:54
time because they used
19:56
cameras that looked like sea animals so
19:59
they
19:59
they built a camera that looked like a
20:01
sea turtle and the dolphins were not
20:03
disturbed
20:04
and this was not seen before because
20:05
they don't do it when they're humans
20:06
around yeah
20:07
too paranoid yeah i guess so um on drunk
20:11
animals yeah
20:12
and drunk elephants specifically
20:13
elephants do get drunk quite often in
20:15
india apparently um an elephant
20:17
expert in assam claims because of uh
20:20
indian rice wine and i don't know why
20:21
they keep leaving it out but um
20:22
elephants love indian rice wine and so
20:24
they've stampeded villages and got their
20:26
rice wine and stuff um and there was an
20:28
occasion a few years ago i think maybe
20:30
in 2004 where
20:32
they got really drunk on rice beer and
20:34
they ended up knocking over
20:35
an electricity pole and four of them got
20:38
electrocuted
20:40
so it's drinking is dangerous not just
20:42
for
20:43
humans but it's not dangerous for
20:45
another animal
20:46
called uh the pen tails tree shrew
20:49
which lives in malaysia and it's
20:51
frequently drunk as in much drunker than
20:53
humans get it
20:55
several times over the legal limit to
20:57
drive for example
20:59
even if it wasn't you know a tree true
21:02
but the equivalent of about nine small
21:04
glasses of wine
21:06
is what scientists think based on tree
21:08
true biology and also the effect of the
21:10
nectar
21:11
um but they don't get drunk
21:14
in the same way that humans do they
21:16
don't show the same effects behaviorally
21:19
so some scientists think that we might
21:21
be able to harness the power of the tree
21:23
true to drink
21:24
we would want to harness something that
21:25
allows us to drink and not get drunk
21:27
because beyond me i don't think that's
21:28
something humanity's crying out
21:29
like a car um but yeah that's really
21:31
cool i think they pollinate the plant by
21:33
doing this
21:34
and so they'll go keep going back to the
21:36
bar and getting another another sip and
21:38
slow lorises do it as well that's cool
21:40
i love slow lorises uh yeah the slow
21:42
loris i think is the only
21:44
mammal that is both venomous and
21:45
poisonous and it's the only primate
21:47
that's
21:48
venomous at all they produce poison in
21:50
their elbows
21:52
um and then they lick it and
21:55
they have it in their teeth and then
21:56
they'll bite you with it and they'll
21:58
inject the poison into you
21:59
wow so it's not it's not quite venomous
22:02
because usually you're producing the
22:03
venom in the same place where you're
22:04
just giving it to your face yeah yeah
22:07
they're so cute got such a cute
22:08
reputation yeah
22:10
don't bite you we had on our show we had
22:12
um a venomous
22:14
centipede that eats bats
22:19
yeah it's it's 30 centimeters long and
22:21
it hangs from the top
22:23
of a cave and when a bat flies by it
22:26
just
22:26
catches them while they're flying and
22:28
then eats it complete in two hours i
22:30
think it's amazing we had it on the show
22:32
and i threw in a piece of chicken and it
22:34
just ran for it and just
22:36
grabbed it i hate centipedes so much i
22:38
think they're my least favorite animal
22:39
yeah i don't like them at all what about
22:42
millipedes
22:42
i don't i like them i've been reading
22:44
about legs and
22:46
centipedes move very fast because
22:48
they're hunters
22:50
and millipedes move nice and slowly and
22:51
gently because they're scavengers
22:53
they're not interested in
22:54
you know chasing down prey so i think
22:56
it's that centipede movement that i
22:57
don't like
22:58
fair enough the one that levin was
23:00
talking about is called scolopendra
23:02
gigantia and it's been found in london
23:05
the bat-eating one great i bet it's been
23:07
found in
23:08
south west london hasn't it
23:10
unfortunately no it was found by stuart
23:12
hein who with a guy who we've met from
23:13
the natural history museum um
23:15
it was reported to him and it was
23:17
climbing up someone's living room wall
23:20
wow a bite a bite of this uh
23:23
uh bite of the centipede is described as
23:26
30 bee stings in one
23:27
place for a human so it's it's not
23:30
lethal for a human but it's
23:31
extremely painful james if you tell me
23:33
where the living room was i will never
23:35
go to that postcode in london
23:38
we could invent the sports centipede and
23:39
depends
23:43
um all right should we uh shall we move
23:44
on so james you got anything do you want
23:46
to
23:46
add the misconception about koalas
23:48
getting getting high
23:50
on eucalyptus save the koala.com and not
23:53
very happy about that at all there
23:55
they say the myth possibly arose as a
23:58
way of explaining why koalas sleep for
24:00
up to 22 hours a day
24:01
they need more sleep than most animals
24:03
because eucalyptus leaves contain toxins
24:06
which kind of sounds like they are
24:07
getting a bit high but they're very
24:09
adamant they're not okay that's so sweet
24:10
that they're trying to defend them from
24:12
accusations of drug addiction
24:14
like our little koalas are not just
24:16
taking drugs and getting high
24:18
okay good boys
24:24
um okay let's uh let's move on to our
24:26
final fact of the show and andy
24:29
it's you okay the youngest woolly
24:31
mammoths
24:32
are older than the oldest egyptian
24:34
pharaohs
24:35
um mammoths were walking the earth while
24:37
they were flowers
24:38
in egypt and after about a thousand
24:40
years of pharaohs as well but yes the
24:42
last mammoth died out in about
24:44
1500 bc so they were around a lot longer
24:48
than we think actually that was actually
24:49
when the pyramids
24:51
haven't they yeah that sounds like a
24:52
great b movie pharaohs and mammoths
24:55
yes coming to theaters near you yeah
24:58
but presumably there weren't any woolly
25:00
mammoths in egypt no
25:01
there's no ferrous riding a woolly
25:03
mammoth no the last ones were in the
25:05
arctic
25:06
in the arctic they're on a place called
25:07
wrangle island which is amazing the name
25:09
is now part of russia
25:10
few people believe they're still around
25:12
actually yes yeah they were they were
25:14
allegedly seen in northern russia i
25:17
think
25:17
three years ago there was a youtube clip
25:20
but then it turned out to be false of
25:21
course
25:22
yeah but you have you have this this
25:24
niche
25:25
movement of cryptobiologists who think
25:28
that there's
25:29
many large animals that we haven't found
25:30
yet such as bigfoot of course
25:32
yeah but they also believe in the
25:33
mammoth well i mean it's it's really
25:35
interesting because we do
25:36
when you say yeah there might be woolly
25:38
mammoths out there most of us just go
25:39
that's impossible
25:40
but they have found countless numbers of
25:42
extinct animals that turned out haven't
25:44
that haven't been extinct
25:45
and we had a um in a future podcast
25:47
coming out we spoke to a
25:49
uh an explorer called john blasted snell
25:51
who went out to look for
25:53
a mythical mammoth elephant and managed
25:56
to find it and it was thought to have
25:57
been extinct
25:58
and turns out it wasn't and i can't
25:59
remember does anyone remember where he
26:01
looked for that yeah nepal
26:04
that was it's a different kind of asian
26:06
elephant yes to the one ever
26:07
the one that everyone thought yeah yeah
26:09
you have you have this cartoon by xkcd
26:11
the
26:11
the internet youtube and and he he has
26:14
this
26:15
this timeline and he says that now that
26:17
everyone is carrying
26:19
a photo camera or a video camera
26:20
everywhere the odds of finding bigfoot
26:23
are getting pretty
26:24
slim because we had all these messy
26:26
photos from a from a big distance but
26:28
everybody has a camera everywhere now so
26:31
if it exists we should see it in the
26:32
coming ten years or it just
26:34
is important yeah yeah oh speaking of
26:36
fakes uh in 2003
26:38
a museum in leon sea abandoned its plans
26:42
to display a 150
26:43
000 year old four foot long woolly
26:45
mammoth tusk
26:47
after a second opinion from a geologist
26:48
identified it in the length of victorian
26:50
drainage pipe
26:53
so it did not they were using tusks
26:56
that's fantastic amazing yeah i think at
26:58
this point that the
27:00
the dna that they found in frozen
27:02
mammoths
27:03
is good enough to clone them they found
27:05
woolly mammoth blood
27:07
uh and muscle tissue inside the bodies
27:09
which is
27:10
a big step towards it but the just
27:12
there's so many difficulties of cloning
27:14
beyond the
27:14
jurassic park problem finding a host
27:17
finding
27:18
you know an organism similar enough and
27:20
but they did clone the
27:22
ibex the pyrenean ibex but that was an
27:24
animal which had died out in the 90s
27:26
and they managed to clone one it
27:28
survived to seven minutes
27:30
the one that seven minutes yeah and then
27:32
it had lung problems and
27:33
and died as a result of them but they
27:36
managed it and one animal carried it i
27:38
don't know
27:38
okay and maybe i suppose a similar ibex
27:42
we had a guy on museum of curiosity the
27:45
radio show that we do
27:46
he's a primatologist called volca summer
27:48
and he was saying one of the dangerous
27:50
things that you're not allowed to say
27:51
out loud
27:52
is that actually humans and great apes
27:54
could actually still
27:56
copulate and have a child there is a
27:58
story that
27:59
in belgium congo there was a mix of a
28:02
bonneville and a human
28:04
really yes but it's uh it's completely
28:07
unchecked
28:10
one of the most famous biologists in in
28:12
belgium
28:13
is is very fond of this myth and and
28:15
really wants
28:16
to find it because i think technically
28:19
that that would mean that we are
28:21
we are the same species now that's only
28:23
that's only if you're
28:25
if the children can have children
28:26
themselves right yeah yeah yeah i am
28:28
three and a half percent neanderthal uh
28:30
by the way
28:31
what you've actually you know that for
28:32
certain yeah yeah wow i had my dna
28:34
tested i am three and a half percent
28:36
yeah
28:36
wow is that high above average i think
28:39
the average is two and a half yeah
28:40
so i'm a bit more stupid than average
28:44
no i'm stronger sorry i meant this
28:45
considering opening jazz
28:47
the place where you where you test it
28:48
when they send the results they also
28:50
have a suggestion of buying the t-shirts
28:51
three
28:52
three three and a half percent
28:53
neanderthal so for every percentage they
28:55
have a t-shirt so they have
28:56
maybe one or two ten percent in the end
28:58
how high does it go
28:59
i don't think it goes up to ten i think
29:01
maybe five or something else is the
29:03
highest and the lowest is maybe one and
29:05
a half or something
29:06
five is quite a lot yeah i'm surprised
29:08
yeah but i'm not sure i'm not sure hey
29:09
did you know that with woolly mammoth
29:10
tusks
29:11
that if you cut them open like if you
29:14
slice in between
29:14
you can tell how old the woolly mammoth
29:16
was by the rings like a tree
29:18
yeah you can count the age of a woolly
29:20
mammoth by its rings the same thing
29:22
is true for the earwax of whales
29:26
wow yes so a whale a whale is a mammal
29:30
and of course because of the high
29:31
pressure the water would get inside the
29:33
ears and
29:34
and evolutionary they developed a plug
29:37
of earwax inside their ears to keep the
29:39
water
29:40
out and it grows every year so when they
29:42
when they find when they find a dead
29:44
whale
29:44
they just cut open the earwax block and
29:47
they can count
29:48
the earrings in there wow that's a
29:51
lovely job
29:53
yeah and they can even um they can even
29:56
find chemicals in the rings so they know
29:58
in in what year it was exposed to
30:00
certain chemicals in that yeah
30:01
should we james you want to add anything
30:03
um the um
30:04
ibex was surrogated in a domestic goat
30:08
uh and that worked okay one quick more
30:10
yearing fact
30:11
yes yes you might have heard this the
30:14
the
30:14
the oldest tree in the world um there
30:17
there's
30:18
i think there's this wood in california
30:19
where they have really old trees up to
30:22
four thousand five thousand years old
30:24
and one guy was was testing them and he
30:26
had he had a special drill you had to
30:27
drill into the tree and then take it out
30:29
and you could count the earrings and it
30:31
was a very expensive drill was a new one
30:32
so he put it in the tree and then he
30:33
couldn't get it out again
30:35
and then one of the one of the guys
30:36
there said ah let's just cut down the
30:38
trees there's lots of them here and cut
30:39
them down and he took this sample and he
30:41
started counting and found out that this
30:42
was
30:43
the oldest tree ever seen in the world
30:46
that he had just cut down and the
30:50
the other oldest living tree is in
30:52
another state so they were very angry
30:54
because now the other state had the
30:55
oldest tree in the world
30:57
and he had to quit his job and he moved
30:59
to studying lakes
31:01
and i'm always wondering you can't cut
31:03
down a lake at least well i'm always
31:04
wondering if he ever studied
31:05
the arrow lake which is slowly drying up
31:07
of course
31:09
might be his fault too
31:11
[Applause]
31:14
[Music]
31:15
okay that's it that's all of our facts
31:17
thanks so much for listening everyone if
31:18

31:42
our special guest leaving
31:43
at leaven skirting great fantastic we're
31:46
going to have lots of these videos and
31:48
and links and all that sort of stuff
31:49
we've been talking about in this episode
31:51
up on qi.com
31:52
podcast so if you want to check out
31:54
anything there and we'll be back
31:56
again next week thanks everyone for
31:58
listening to this episode and no such
31:59
thing as a fish
32:02
[Music]
32:09
[Applause]
32:12
goodbye
32:17
[Music]
32:21
you

=14
00:00
we run it on qi a few years ago yeah um
00:02
which was
00:03
there's no such thing as a fish there's
00:04
no such thing as a fish no seriously
00:06
it's in
00:06
the oxford dictionary of underwater life
00:10
it says it right there first paragraph
00:11
no such thing as a fish
00:17
[Applause]
00:19
hey everyone welcome to another edition
00:21
of no such thing as a fish a weekly
00:23
podcast coming to you from the qi
00:25
offices in covent garden my name is dan
00:27
schreiber i'm sitting here with the
00:28
regular three qi
00:30
elves anna chazinski andy murray and
00:32
james harkin and we've got joining us
00:34
today on fact checking judy's freddy
00:36
soams
00:36
and once again we have gathered around
00:38
the microphones in our offices
00:40
to tell each other our favorite facts
00:42
from the last seven days so
00:44
in no particular order here we go
00:48
first up it's james
00:51
uh my fact this week is that the ceo of
00:54
levi's
00:55
chip berg hasn't washed his jeans in
00:57
more than a year
00:59
so when you first mentioned this to us
01:02
yes
01:03
i thought that wasn't that surprising
01:05
because i didn't really wash jeans and
01:07
didn't realize that was a thing
01:09
i was shocked and i wanted to know where
01:11
his mother was
01:12
and i wash my jeans every day but annie
01:15
eats crisps of a plate
01:16
come on that's true can't trust his
01:18
household habits but um apparently i'm
01:20
right right so
01:21
a jeans aficionado is on my side well
01:24
there are lots of people who think that
01:25
you shouldn't wash jeans because
01:26
it um it fades the colors and it spoils
01:29
the fabric
01:30
but that's people who work for jeans
01:32
companies not so much microbiologists
01:35
who tend to think that you probably
01:36
should wash them because there's going
01:38
to be lots of bacteria on there um so
01:40
how much bacteria are we talking
01:42
okay so um there was a student at the
01:44
university of alberta called josh
01:45
lay or lee and um he as an experiment
01:48
wore the same pair of jeans for 15
01:50
months without washing them
01:52
and after two weeks he found that he had
01:55
um around a thousand to two thousand
01:57
bacteria
01:58
and per square centimeter that was on
02:01
the front of the jeans
02:02
fifteen hundred to two thousand five
02:04
hundred on the back and between eight
02:06
thousand
02:06
and ten thousand in the crotch area
02:08
lovely
02:10
i wonder how many more that is than we
02:11
have on our skin yeah well
02:13
you do have bacteria on your skin we
02:15
have we have ten times more bacterial
02:17
cells than human cells in our bodies is
02:18
that right yes that's right most of them
02:20
are very small cells in the
02:21
gut but 90 of you is not human yeah and
02:24
doesn't isn't that where all the smell
02:25
comes from
02:26
i seem to remember saying this to you
02:27
guys a long time ago but that's where
02:29
that's why that's why you smell it's not
02:31
you it's the little animal lads
02:33
it's a very poor excuse on a date though
02:36
it's not me it's the 90 of cells which
02:38
aren't me and my body
02:41
so if someone ever says to you oh you
02:43
smell of sweat today you should say no i
02:44
smell a bacterial feces actually
02:47
in your face where are you going don't
02:49
get in that taxi
02:51
promise for us um so
02:54
i don't know do you just not do anything
02:57
with your jeans anna or do you put them
02:58
in the freezer like some people do
03:00
i don't really understand this freezer
03:01
thing what's the freezer thing well
03:03
that's what this um this guy from levi
03:05
says that um instead of washing you can
03:07
click you can kill the bacteria by
03:09
putting your jeans in the freezer
03:11
and one it it means that it doesn't fade
03:14
the genes and what have you
03:15
but two it also will save water and
03:17
apparently um people
03:19
are using a lot of water all the time um
03:21
uselessly for
03:22
washing their jeans so that's a bit like
03:24
that's like a
03:25
cool way of cleaning in the same way
03:26
that remember the person who used to
03:27
have an asbestos
03:29
um tablecloth oh yeah charlemagne
03:34
okay so like dan says exactly that he
03:36
had an asbestos
03:37
tablecloth after each meal he would take
03:39
it out throw it in the fire
03:40
and then let the fire clean it and then
03:42
he would bring it out and use it again
03:44
did he die young by any chance
03:46
can i tell you my favorite thing about
03:47
this levi's fact is
03:49
that i just like that the head of levi's
03:52
wears levi's
03:53
yeah it's just i love anytime you hear a
03:55
story where someone uses the thing that
03:57
they created
03:58
or or that they're the head of like when
04:00
i was wearing my no such thing as a fish
04:02
t-shirt at qi recordings this week
04:04
exactly yeah they're of course ashamed
04:06
to buy online
04:07
in new zealand not from us i like it
04:11
even more so when you see the
04:12
the company getting in trouble for
04:15
something to do with their own company
04:16
like for example jimmy wales who created
04:19
wikipedia
04:20
got in trouble for editing his own
04:22
wikipedia page
04:23
which is the top line of what you're not
04:25
meant to do and he got busted for it and
04:27
i don't know what he was thinking
04:28
because it comes up as edited by jimmy
04:30
wales i think we
04:31
tweeted this the other day and freddie
04:33
you might have to check which units they
04:35
were but there's an american uni that or
04:37
uh uh guidelines on plagiarism and it
04:39
was all plagiarized from another
04:40
american oh yeah that's a great fact
04:42
that was yeah that's
04:42
it's a q tweet if you can find that do
04:44
we know who invented jeans by the way
04:46
well there's a difference between jeans
04:48
and blue jeans
04:49
you know the blue jeans that everyone
04:51
wears today yeah were invented in the
04:53
late
04:53
19th century in america but this is cool
04:56
um there have been paintings discovered
04:58
from the 1650s where people are wearing
05:00
the blue cloth sort of fixed in with
05:02
white which is the you know the proper
05:05
jean fabric um and the artist is unknown
05:07
but it's called the master of the blue
05:08
jeans
05:09
and so in one there's a peasant wearing
05:11
a blue skirt another there's a boy in a
05:13
ripped dark blue jacket and it looks
05:14
like they're wearing
05:15
jeans and jeans yeah yeah and double
05:17
denim it's very very cool
05:19
is that a neem because that's where it
05:21
comes from denim doesn't it
05:23
denim is from neem or it's either there
05:25
or it's from genoa
05:27
in italy which is where they think we
05:29
might get the word
05:30
jeans from but that's not that's not
05:32
blue jeans with the rivets in those
05:33
those were the ones which
05:34
took over the whole world yeah but
05:36
levi's didn't call their product jeans
05:38
did they for a long time
05:39
um i think for the first 107 years they
05:42
called them waste overalls
05:44
we had a fact in one of our books that
05:46
half of the world's population are
05:47
wearing jeans at any one time oh yeah
05:50
um i can't remember where it came from i
05:51
think i kind of missed maybe i know
05:52
where it came from oh god
05:53
well it was a man called miller who
05:55
visited lots and lots of countries and
05:57
in every country he visited he stopped
05:59
and counted the first hundred people to
06:00
walk by
06:01
and in each one he found that almost
06:02
half the population were wearing jeans
06:04
on any given day which is
06:05
unbelievable yeah it's fantastic i'm
06:08
wearing jeans now
06:09
i'm wearing jeans yeah me too i'm not
06:12
wearing jeans yeah this type of thing
06:13
that's my smelling
06:14
and i thought yeah just
06:17
going back to um not really washing
06:20
etcetera
06:20
and there was a a very famous dirty
06:23
celebrity
06:24
um in the um 19th century i think
06:28
i thought 1970s
06:31
and he was called dirty dick you know
06:33
dirty dicks pub
06:34
on liverpool street near liverpool
06:36
street station uh on bishop's gate
06:38
and what happened was on his uh wedding
06:41
day his fiancee died very sadly
06:43
and then after that he refused to wash
06:45
or clean for the rest of his life
06:47
and lived in this place in in london and
06:50
he became really famous for being dirty
06:51
and never washing and
06:52
if you sent any letters uh addressed to
06:55
the dirty warehouse london they would
06:57
always get to him because he was so
06:58
famous for being dirty well there wasn't
07:00
watching queen victoria that washing was
07:01
really bad for you as well didn't she
07:03
people did yeah in the 19th century very
07:05
unfashionable okay
07:06
um before we move on uh freddie have you
07:08
got anything to add
07:09
yeah so um the tweet that uh was on uh
07:11
quickipedia the other day was that um
07:13
a university in oregon has plagiarized
07:16
the section on plagiarism in its student
07:18
handbook
07:18
um from the section on plagiarism in
07:20
stamford university's handbook
07:22
wow so good and we took that tweet from
07:25
omg facts
07:32
okay let's uh move on to fact number two
07:35
and this fact is my one
07:37
uh it's a long one so i was i was just i
07:41
found this pretty astonishing
07:42
the first successful transatlantic
07:44
flight which happened in 1919
07:46
was made by two guys from manchester but
07:49
it's one of those trips where
07:51
it was just a complete disaster but they
07:52
managed to do it but my favorite bit
07:54
about the fact
07:54
is that at one point they got completely
07:56
lost while they were in the air
07:58
they were just covered in cloud and fog
08:00
and when they
08:01
came out of the cloud and fog thinking
08:03
that they were 13 000
08:05
feet in the air it turned out they were
08:06
only 60 feet above the water and not
08:09
only that but they were flying sideways
08:11
on a 90 degree angle to the surface of
08:13
the ocean
08:14
wow i always know when i'm at 90 degrees
08:18
because of gravity yeah were they so
08:20
tense while they were flying that they
08:22
just didn't
08:23
oh so stiff and they were right they
08:25
were so tense now i
08:26
i got this from bill bryson's book one
08:28
summer america 1927.
08:31
he was saying this is how tense it was
08:33
for them to do it the guy who was in
08:34
front
08:35
who was called allcock was holding onto
08:37
the wheel they didn't have a cover over
08:40
them it was like a convertible plane
08:42
and the other guy's job who was brown
08:45
had to sit forward
08:46
and using his two index fingers as kind
08:48
of windshield wipers on the goggles of
08:50
all cog
08:50
that was his job to basically just be
08:53
wiping them away
08:54
he also had to jump out onto the wings
08:56
of the plane six times in order to knock
08:58
icing off
08:59
and get back on i said
09:03
they flew through the great cake drift
09:08
so when was this what year was this 1919
09:11
1919
09:12
um they did the first transatlantic yeah
09:14
but they went from canada didn't they
09:16
they went from newfoundland
09:17
yeah to ireland yeah but at one point
09:20
they even
09:20
went the wrong way they did a loop and
09:22
started heading back towards canada
09:24
it is pretty easy to get disorientated i
09:27
think when you're flying
09:28
um shame on me i can't remember who it
09:30
was but there was an explorer who was in
09:32
a balloon
09:32
and he went up very very high and sort
09:35
of passed out or fell asleep or
09:37
something like that and then when he
09:38
woke up
09:39
um he thought he'd landed and so decided
09:41
to get out of the plane to just walk on
09:43
the snow
09:44
which he saw below and only when he was
09:46
halfway out of the balloon did he
09:47
realize that it wasn't snow it was
09:49
actually the clouds and he was still
09:51
20 000 feet up oh my god uh in 1914
09:55
when you look at the military use of of
09:57
airplanes
09:58
uh there's this fact here that the
10:01
french air corps
10:02
had the largest air force in the world
10:04
larger than germany britain
10:06
italy russia japan and austria all
10:08
combined
10:09
and they only had three dozen planes and
10:12
that was the largest in the world
10:14
so how many did the rest of us have four
10:17
each or between us each shed each and
10:19
america had two
10:21
and in the space of four years they went
10:24
up to
10:24
britain having fifty five thousand
10:26
germany having forty eight thousand
10:28
italy having twenty thousand and france
10:30
still had thirty six
10:32
um do you want to hear something cool
10:34
about lindbergh yes please who made the
10:35
first
10:36
solo flight from new york to paris he
10:39
was the 19th person to cross the
10:41
atlantic in a plane
10:42
oh really yeah to see the first solo
10:45
then
10:45
he was the first solo new york to paris
10:48
that was the thing and new york is a
10:49
much further distance because obviously
10:50
it's further down the coast
10:51
so lots of people talk about the amazing
10:53
length he went to to cut down the weight
10:54
of the plane and even he even cut the
10:56
top and the bottom off his map
10:57
so that it would save a couple of ounces
11:00
um but he also had this thing uh
11:02
he said i had an arm burst cup which is
11:04
a device for condensing the moisture
11:06
from human breath into drinking water
11:08
how cool is that why don't we still have
11:10
these he didn't realize how
11:12
famous he was gonna be did he he knew he
11:14
might be in the papers so he
11:16
um he subscribed to a cutting service
11:18
that would send
11:19
all the um newspaper cuttings to his
11:22
mother's house
11:23
um thinking it would just be a few here
11:25
or there but of course it was in every
11:27
single newspaper for days and days and
11:29
days
11:30
and by the end of his first week his
11:31
mother discovered to her horror that a
11:33
fleet of trucks was preparing to deliver
11:35
several tons of newspaper articles to
11:37
her house
11:39
reports were at the time like if he left
11:40
something on his plate
11:42
you know a meal like corn on the cob the
11:45
waiters would fight over it because that
11:46
would become
11:47
a really precious drummer's drumstick
11:49
after a gig yeah
11:50
except an actual drumstick um so the
11:53
right flyer was
11:54
the wright brothers plane that they
11:56
first flew and what's the highest
11:58
altitude that any part of it reached
12:01
20 feet 30 feet i'm thinking it's a qi
12:05
question so i think i know the answer
12:07
yeah go on is it the moon it's so the
12:09
moon
12:12
of course another one of neal's little
12:14
trinkets
12:15
who brought up neil armstrong armstrong
12:16
brought it up to brought up a bit of the
12:17
wing we had
12:18
a few series ago buzz aldrin on museum
12:21
of curiosity
12:22
sister show to qi and no such thing as a
12:24
fish cousin of no such thing as a fish
12:27
and i found this fact that
12:31
i hadn't read in any of his biographies
12:32
i can't even remember where i found it
12:33
now but i
12:34
i mentioned it to him in person because
12:36
i thought this is gonna be amazing to
12:38
say to buzz aldrin i discovered that his
12:40
dad
12:41
was mates with one of the wright
12:42
brothers oh
12:44
so within the father's lifetime he knew
12:47
the first person
12:48
to fly a plane and his son became yeah
12:50
that's probably the first well the
12:52
second person to stand on the moon
12:54
and so i said to him you might have
12:56
actually met him because you were at the
12:58
same air force base where your dad and
13:00
he worked
13:01
and he went yeah i guess so and he just
13:04
wasn't interested
13:05
at all i i thought i delivered that i
13:07
think it's the way you tell him then
13:11
the wright brothers dad told them that
13:13
they were never allowed to fly together
13:14
didn't he because he was worried that
13:15
one of them was going to die so they
13:16
only flew together once
13:18
in that whole line and you know on that
13:19
so after their first flight in the
13:21
wright flyer um
13:22
in 1903 i think it was then so they they
13:24
took turns flying and they had goes on
13:26
it and they flew further and further and
13:27
then they had a chat about it stood next
13:28
to the plane had a chat about it and the
13:30
right flyer never flew again after that
13:31
day because a gust of wind picked it up
13:33
and flipped
13:34
it over a bunch of times and broke it oh
13:35
really yeah just as they were talking
13:37
they're like oh [ __ ] there goes that
13:38
do you guys know who was the first woman
13:40
to fly solo in an airplane is it
13:43
not a female lady human is it a female
13:46
animal
13:46
is it a female aunt is it a tortoise
13:50
it's not even a qi thing it's just a
13:51
question and
13:53
it's a question to which none of you
13:54
know the answer tell us the answer god
13:56
damn it
13:56
it was blanche stewart scott of course
14:00
because the story was quite good because
14:01
she was the first woman to fly solo in
14:03
an airplane she reached 40 feet and it
14:05
was in 1910
14:07
and she was a friend of an aviator
14:09
called glenn curtis
14:11
and he like was a time in in those days
14:14
nobody thought a woman should really be
14:15
in an airplane and
14:17
he allowed her to sort of taxi around
14:20
the airfield in the airplane but she
14:22
wasn't allowed to take off
14:24
and then something happened we don't
14:27
know what happened
14:28
on september the 2nd in 1910 and she
14:31
managed to take off
14:32
and ended up going up to 40 feet in the
14:34
air and no one really knows
14:35
how she managed to do it because what he
14:38
would do is he he would insert a block
14:40
of wood behind the throttle to stop her
14:42
from reaching the necessary speed to
14:43
take off
14:44
and then assume that a woman would not
14:46
have the intelligence to remove a block
14:47
of wood
14:48
from behind a throttle because my theory
14:51
is that's probably what she did
14:53
or it might have come loose itself and
14:54
did she land it yeah
14:56
so she didn't die no she didn't die okay
14:58
that's good news
15:00
i have a fun fact about the guy who
15:01
invented the autopilot
15:03
oh cool um who was laurence ferry who i
15:06
think you're familiar with andy yeah
15:08
but so he also inadvertently invented
15:10
something else which was the mile high
15:12
club
15:13
sorry i was going to make that like
15:14
attention thing like yes then i just
15:16
decided to study the answer
15:18
um so yeah in 1916 he was giving flying
15:21
lessons to this socialite called mrs
15:23
waldo pierce
15:24
whose husband to make this story a bit
15:26
more poignant was driving an ambulance
15:28
in france at the time in the war
15:29
her husband was friends with ernest
15:31
hemingway by coincidence um so
15:33
lawrence berry autopilot inventor mrs
15:35
waldo pierce go up in his
15:37
plane he uses his autopilot um to fly
15:40
the plane for a while while he has a
15:41
quick
15:42
uh bit of uh whatever euphemism you want
15:45
to give it how's your father
15:47
with mrs waldo um and the plane crashed
15:50
something went wrong with the autopilot
15:52
people think that they kicked it during
15:53
their relations
15:54
and kicked the autopilot of course and
15:56
the plane crashed into a duck pond
15:58
and they were found unclothed by duck
15:59
hunters fortunately her husband was
16:01
driving an ambulance nearby
16:03
[Laughter]
16:05
sperry claimed they'd been divested by
16:07
the force of the crash
16:08
when they emerged
16:12
oh my god isn't there a fact that the
16:14
first ever hot air balloon
16:16
trip there was some hanky-panky going on
16:18
in there not the first ever because i
16:20
think that was the mongolia brothers
16:22
[Laughter]
16:25
um george bigen and leticia sage went
16:28
up in a balloon organized by an italian
16:29
man called illuminati but he got out
16:32
just at the last minute and it went over
16:34
piccadilly and as it went over
16:36
piccadilly people could see sage on all
16:37
fours
16:38
um although she maintained that she was
16:41
not having sex i think she said she was
16:42
looking for something
16:43
although i can't remember for sure and
16:45
all of all of her clothes had fallen off
16:47
in the excitement of going out there
16:49
and so then later on in these big wager
16:51
books that they have in london clubs um
16:53
one one wager reads lord chumbley has
16:56
given two guineas to lord darby to
16:57
receive 500 guineas
16:59
whenever his lordship plays hospitals
17:01
with a woman in a balloon a thousand
17:02
yards from the earth maybe
17:04
people's clothes were just much more
17:06
poorly designed
17:07
in the olden days maybe they just never
17:08
washed their jeans and they just fell
17:10
off
17:11
crumbling away
17:18
okay um time for fact number three
17:21
and that is anna's uh yeah my fact is
17:24
that in 2007
17:26
a woman called evan latimer inherited
17:28
napoleon's penis from her father
17:32
that happened yeah um so
17:35
basically at napoleon's autopsy in 1921
17:38
there were 17 doctors present
17:40
um and it's thought that the main his
17:43
physician his main doctor
17:44
cut off his penis we know that bits of
17:46
his body were removed so his heart was
17:48
removed because he wanted it sent to his
17:50
wife his estranged wife although it
17:51
never got to her and there's a theory
17:53
that it was eaten by rats
17:54
and anyway then it was later admitted by
17:56
one of the doctors who was there that
17:57
other bits of napoleon's body were also
17:59
removed
18:00
so it resurfaced at the beginning of the
18:02
20th century from the family of the
18:04
priest who was also present at the
18:05
autopsy whom the physician had given it
18:07
to
18:08
um and yeah it was put up it was sold to
18:11
a collector and it's been sold at
18:13
various auctions
18:14
and it's been on display in new york and
18:16
what did they sell it for
18:17
only three thousand dollars he bought it
18:19
for in 1977 that would have been more
18:21
money
18:22
a bit more but also it was questionable
18:24
whether it was
18:25
his penis at all but was this woman
18:27
upset that you know did her elder sister
18:29
get
18:29
the duke of wellington's penis in the
18:31
middle or something was it was the whole
18:32
bequest penises maybe
18:35
because his penis is certainly
18:36
diminutive it measures 1.5
18:38
inches now and there is a defense that
18:40
it wasn't very well preserved
18:42
so there's been some shriveling but it
18:43
is it's been likened to various things
18:46
it's been likened over the years by
18:47
people who've seen it to shriveled eel
18:48
beef jerky and a bit of leather
18:50
um and it's 1.5 inches um yeah it was
18:54
described as a mummified tendon i
18:55
believe when he removed it
18:57
which is a very delicate way of
18:58
describing a severed penis
19:00
yeah certainly better than shrivel deal
19:04
i first read this fact in a book called
19:06
the antiques magpie which is really good
19:08
um and it's written by an antics
19:10
roadshow expert he thinks that the
19:11
reason the
19:12
willie was lopped off was because the
19:14
physician was annoyed at being left out
19:16
of napoleon's will
19:18
i read it was the chaplain who wanted it
19:20
done as an act of revenge
19:22
um because uh napoleon kept calling him
19:24
impotent well he did give it to the
19:25
chaplain so maybe they both had a chat
19:27
in the pub one night and he was like i'm
19:28
really pissed off napoleon i'm not in
19:30
his will and the chaplain was like i'm
19:31
pissed off napoleon too he's called me
19:32
impotent
19:33
and they agreed to it maybe they each
19:35
got half which explains its size
19:38
that's such a good point yeah um it's
19:40
actually three inches
19:41
we've been unfair the thing is that
19:43
after napoleon was captured at waterloo
19:46
all of his belongings were sent on tour
19:48
around england very much like
19:50
the x factor roadshow today for example
19:52
so
19:53
his carriage was sent around the country
19:55
and it drew crowds it
19:56
had little objects that he had owned
19:58
like a gold tongue scraper
20:00
a flesh brush and a chocolate pot i'm
20:02
sorry what's a flesh brush i
20:04
think i'm not certain it's a brush with
20:06
hard bristles that you use to stimulate
20:08
your skin
20:08
and stimulate blood flow but i i'm not
20:11
certain did you guys know that this
20:12
this is a bit of research that i did in
20:14
the b series and no one liked it
20:16
napoleon um had a little genie
20:20
that he used to talk to called that
20:25
little 1.5 inch it's dried up genie
20:27
honestly it's small but it works
20:28
magic just rub it just rub it
20:33
um no he he had a um it's apparently
20:36
someone who
20:36
before big battles used to come from the
20:39
stars
20:40
called the red man is what he called him
20:41
the red man and he first appeared during
20:43
the battle of the pyramids
20:44
and supposedly napoleon said he made a
20:46
pact a 10-year pact with this genie
20:48
oh weird rasputin's penis
20:52
that was sold um and it turned out later
20:55
to be a dried up piece of
20:56
sea cucumber and not a penis at all just
20:59
can you imagine all the women who were
21:01
disappointed in the bedroom by that
21:04
um and just tooting car moon another
21:06
famous person was the only mummy
21:08
uh who was buried with an erect penis
21:11
wow
21:12
someone else's or her yes yes
21:15
um one of the best sentences said out
21:17
loud in this office
21:18
i'm convinced was one night when me and
21:20
james were sitting here uh
21:21
and putting music to one of the no such
21:23
thing as a fish podcast
21:25
and in a moment of silence where james
21:27
saw oh i've got
21:28
you know i should just start a
21:29
conversation james said to me hey did
21:31
you know over 600 men in the world have
21:33
two dicks
21:37
uh yeah no that is true 600 men have two
21:39
dicks there was a
21:40
circus performer who had two penises
21:43
remember him no um i can't remember no i
21:46
missed it i missed that
21:48
i missed when i was seven that zippo's
21:50
circus
21:50
[Laughter]
21:52
you were concentrating on the clowns and
21:54
the elephants yeah
21:57
i can see the man exposing himself by
21:58
the door of the tent
22:02
i'm not sure he was part of the circus
22:04
obviously thinking about it it might be
22:06
two men
22:07
[Laughter]
22:10
so the guy was called um juan baptista
22:12
dos santos
22:14
and he was known as the man with two
22:15
penises uh and he was born in pharaoh in
22:18
portugal in
22:19
1843 and um in 1865 he turned down the
22:23
sum
22:23
of 200 000 francs to appear for two
22:26
years with a french circus
22:28
ah impressive guy that would be very
22:30
difficult for his tailor though
22:31
which way to sir address to the left no
22:34
actually both
22:35
go to the left and the right
22:42
okay moving on to our final fact of the
22:44
show fact number four andy
22:46
yours my fact is to say i don't care
22:48
about something a german person has the
22:50
option of saying
22:51
it's sausage to me or in german
22:56
um yeah so there's a rich heritage
23:00
of sausage sayings in germany there's
23:03
another one which
23:04
suggests that it's very important is
23:06
that sausage is very important where you
23:08
say
23:08
uh is gate um divorced which is it's all
23:11
about the sausage
23:12
um anyway this is from a blog on uh
23:14
oxford dictionary's
23:16
website from the oup they have other
23:18
ones like um if you're sulking
23:20
you are playing the offended liver pate
23:22
the belly dig the liver
23:24
spilling that's like i think that's like
23:27
referring to the bottom lip sticking out
23:29
isn't it it's like a bit of a liver
23:31
i think so yeah they have a sausage
23:33
academy i believe
23:35
you can get a sausage diploma um in
23:38
germany you can get it
23:39
is it a diploma that's also a sausage
23:40
that's a real thing i also have a
23:42
sausage diploma or i got it from bangor
23:44
university
23:46
no anna's right there's a students have
23:50
earned
23:50
certificates at the sausage academy they
23:52
learn things like what's the right
23:53
mustard to put with what sausage and
23:55
which is the best lager to drink with it
23:56
in america they have the national hot
23:58
dog academy
24:00
and they do a similar thing they have
24:01
rules about eating hot dogs
24:04
and so for instance one of them is don't
24:06
take more than
24:07
five bites to finish a hot dog for
24:10
footlong wiener seven bites are
24:11
acceptable and also don't use ketchup on
24:15
your hot dog
24:16
after the age of 18 mustard relish
24:19
onions
24:19
cheese and chili are acceptable the
24:21
first hot dog eating competition was
24:23
held in 1916
24:25
uh which i think was in the states so
24:27
the year before they entered the war
24:28
when they were still locking around
24:30
and the winner ate 13 frankfurters i
24:32
don't know in what
24:33
time scale that was but recently the le
24:35
the latest record i've found was from
24:37
last year
24:38
where a man ate 69 hot dogs in 10
24:41
minutes
24:42
with buns i i highly recommend to anyone
24:44
listening if they want to find out more
24:45
about this kind of hot dog eating
24:47
competition stuff
24:48
i just read an article by john ronson in
24:50
his book lost at sea
24:52
called the hunger games and he
24:54
interviews the top
24:55
the person who set that record that andy
24:57
just read out uh it's
24:58
him into jon ronson interviewing him and
25:00
it's phenomenal
25:01
the industry the great breakthrough was
25:04
um
25:05
a very small slight looking i think
25:07
japanese japanese yeah
25:08
who came up with the incredible
25:10
innovation that you don't have to chew
25:11
your way through the buns
25:12
you dip them in water which makes them a
25:14
lot smaller a lot easier to swallow
25:16
quickly and
25:17
revolutionize the game but actually flop
25:19
moment in competitive hot dog eating
25:22
but actually there is controversy
25:23
whether you should be allowed to do that
25:24
it sounds like cheating
25:26
i definitely think you shouldn't i'm
25:28
afraid to say no um i found a there's a
25:30
japanese
25:31
book uh which is it's published in
25:34
edinburgh and it's
25:35
called the insider's guide to scotland
25:38
obviously though with a japanese title
25:39
that's the translated title and in the
25:41
book
25:42
they um advise anyone from japan
25:44
visiting scotland to avoid eating the
25:46
sausages
25:47
oh yeah speaking of parts of the uk and
25:51
sausages
25:52
there was a welsh product called dragon
25:54
sausages and it had to be taken off the
25:56
shelves because it didn't contain any
25:57
dragons
26:00
yeah a paris county council spokesman
26:02
said the product was not sufficiently
26:04
precise to inform a purchaser of the
26:06
true nature of the food
26:09
uh there's a man called david harding in
26:11
london who's become the first official
26:13
sausage addict and he's spent two more
26:15
than two grand on therapy to try and get
26:17
over it
26:18
um because he can't live he says i
26:20
genuinely cannot bear the thought of
26:21
living without sausages he thinks he's
26:22
had at least one sausage a day since he
26:24
was three
26:24
wait and he's having therapy to why
26:25
would why would you need therapy to get
26:27
over that just
26:28
by they're not going anywhere just buy
26:29
another sausage oh yeah that's that's
26:31
your
26:32
attitude to all drugs isn't it
26:45
sausages are very elderly
26:50
they are they've been long and noble
26:52
history i've found a lot of things
26:53
online i
26:54
haven't need to properly stack it up but
26:56
i think they're older than
26:57
ancient rome yes which is good i'm
27:00
pretty sure they are um
27:03
there's an aristophanes play called the
27:05
knights as in knights of the round table
27:07
uh in which a sausage seller uh beats
27:10
a demagogue in conversation over
27:13
politics because he knows how to do all
27:15
the stuff like
27:15
mincing up policies and stuff them and
27:17
dress them up looking all nice and
27:19
pretty
27:20
yeah well that's the thing they say laws
27:22
are like sausages don't they
27:24
yeah was it bismarck i think there's
27:26
bismarck who said it um
27:27
laws are like sausages it's best not to
27:29
watch them being made
27:30
yeah something like that so we're
27:33
talking about how old sausages are um
27:35
they were banned um or blood sausages
27:37
were banned by
27:38
leo the wise he ruled in the 10th
27:41
century
27:42
and he banned the blood sausage and the
27:44
pronouncement was like this it said
27:46
we hereby forbid all persons either to
27:49
use or
27:50
sell it and we give notice that if
27:52
anyone should in contempt of divine law
27:54
have been found to have prepared blood
27:56
as food whether he sells
27:58
or buys it he shall have all his
28:00
property
28:01
confiscated wow and after being severely
28:04
scourged and disgracefully shaved
28:07
he shall be exiled for life
28:08
disgracefully shaved
28:10
what is that that's wonderful that's
28:12
very funny um the catholic church banned
28:14
them in the fourth century as well
28:15
because um they were thought to be a
28:16
part of pagan rituals which they were
28:18
often
28:18
hey this is really exciting there's uh
28:21
there's a bunch of forgotten grim fairy
28:23
tales
28:24
stories and one of them is called the
28:27
mouse the bird
28:28
and the sausage a mouse of the bird of
28:31
the sausage set up the house together
28:32
for a while and things are going well
28:34
bird's job was to fly into the forest
28:36
every day bring back wood mouse carried
28:37
water let the fire set the table
28:39
sausage did the cooking making sure
28:42
their meals were properly flavored by
28:44
rolling around
28:44
in them um
28:48
i think we should um wrap up yeah okay
28:50
uh freddy do you want to add anything
28:51
before we wrap up
28:52
yeah i i have one thing um it's kind of
28:54
mundane but pretty impressive all the
28:56
same so
28:56
asda um actually commissioned in 2000
29:00
the creation of the world's longish
29:01
sausage and it was made in
29:03
sheffield and it measured 59.14
29:06
kilometers
29:07
kilometers kilometers yeah 36.75 miles
29:10
wow did they just not turn on the thing
29:14
which divides the sausages up
29:16
you know so they just have a continuous
29:18
production line
29:19
with one sausage that must be it oh
29:21
that's great good fact that's good they
29:23
also won the world's most frightening
29:24
penis metaphor
29:26
with that
29:29
napoleon looked on with envy

00:21
such thing as a fish
00:22
this is the qi podcast coming to you
00:25
from our offices in covent garden my
00:27
name is dan schreiber i'm sitting here
00:28
with anna chazinski james harkin and
00:30
andy murray
00:32
and these are our favorite facts from
00:33
the last seven days so
00:35
in no particular order here we go
00:39
james okay my fact is the aztecs
00:42
wore necklaces made from popcorn was it
00:46
done like you know the uh
00:47
the necklace the candy necklaces that
00:49
you have yeah kind of like that on a
00:51
string yeah on a string
00:52
was it like that but yeah was it there
00:54
so that they could eat the popcorn
00:55
no it was there because they used
00:57
popcorn as a like an offering to the
00:59
gods because it was an important crop
01:01
wait did the aztecs actually pop the
01:03
corn or did they just eat it
01:05
as yes they heated it up yeah wow
01:08
god you don't i think a popcorn is
01:09
basically hasn't existed since before
01:11
the odeon cinemas have existed yeah
01:13
and yet it used to not be allowed into
01:15
cinemas no
01:16
yeah in the early days it was you had to
01:18
buy it outside at a vendor and eat it
01:20
outside
01:20
and then when the great depression
01:22
happened and motion picture sound and
01:24
all that came and they started selling
01:25
inside
01:26
that's when they noticed how popular it
01:28
was yeah one side of the building
01:29
uh what happened was that the first
01:31
cinemas wanted to be like theatre so
01:32
they had very beautiful
01:34
carpets and very beautiful walls and
01:35
stuff and they thought if they sold
01:36
popcorn people just tread it into the
01:38
carpets
01:39
it makes total sense it's not a
01:40
ridiculous item to have in cinema
01:42
um they used to eat it for breakfast in
01:44
america they uh they mixed it with milk
01:46
and sugar and cream so it was kind of
01:49
like a rice crispy
01:50
in a way yeah popcorn was also marketed
01:53
originally
01:54
as pearl or non-pereirae either french
01:57
for without equal
01:58
not nice not classic yeah yeah i have a
02:01
cool thing about popcorn just
02:02
um it's called popcorn this is
02:05
chain reactions so it happens in a
02:07
popcorn bag i think
02:09
but 1700 nuclear weapons
02:12
have in the uk have design flaws which
02:14
could conceivably cause multiple
02:16
warheads to explode one after the other
02:18
which is known as popcorning i like the
02:20
idea of giving like
02:22
really non-threatening names to really
02:24
threatening things out well mushroom
02:26
you know a mushroom cloud will you hate
02:27
myself it's true i find mushrooms on
02:30
their own very threatening
02:31
yeah do you know that uh during world
02:33
war two they tried to ban
02:35
the production of popcorn yeah too noisy
02:38
would alert german bombers to cities
02:41
yeah
02:43
um they they argued that popcorn
02:44
production should be forbidden
02:46
because it was just non-essential at the
02:48
time it was like we've got more
02:49
important
02:50
things to do than popcorn uh but this
02:52
led to the creation of the national
02:53
popcorn association
02:55
and they published a pattern flip called
02:57
popcorn is a fighting food
02:59
which i argue that popcorn contained
03:01
twice as many energy units as a pound of
03:03
steak
03:04
and it was a morale builder popcorn was
03:07
the first food to be cooked
03:09
intentionally by a microwave really yeah
03:12
it was
03:13
the microwave that was discovered by a
03:14
guy called percy spencer he walked past
03:17
a magnetron in world war ii
03:18
and he noticed that the chocolate in his
03:20
pocket had melted
03:22
and so he thought well i wonder what
03:24
that could have been he realized it must
03:25
be in this machine
03:26
and so then he got some popcorn put it
03:28
next to the machine and then it did cook
03:29
and that was the first time they ever
03:31
realized it's the most positive reaction
03:33
i've ever heard to someone having
03:34
chocolate melt in their pockets yeah
03:35
glad that he made the connection that
03:37
you then put the thing in the machine as
03:38
opposed to cooking everything in your
03:40
pocket just by walking around next to it
03:42
yeah that could have been how we
03:43
microwaved everything
03:45
so on aztecs i actually went to the
03:48
beyond el dorado exhibition at the
03:49
british museum recently which was
03:51
excellent and i think it might be over
03:52
now so sorry i probably shouldn't have
03:53
mentioned that
03:54
but if a wealthy aztec died and was
03:57
cremated then a dog had to be cremated
03:59
with them so that it could guide them
04:00
through the afterlife their relationship
04:03
with their gods
04:04
you know twenty thousand people were
04:06
sacrificed
04:07
they did another human sacrifice for a
04:09
year they were 20 000 dogs as well that
04:11
means
04:12
yeah that's yeah they used to take
04:13
hallucinogens didn't they uh
04:15
the ritual leaders would take
04:17
hallucinogens to get closer to the gods
04:19
and at this exhibition they have these
04:20
amazing masks so then they put masks on
04:22
a certain animal so they they were
04:23
called batman
04:24
or bat you'd be batman if you wore this
04:25
bat mask and they thought it transformed
04:27
you into a bat
04:28
so they'd take a hallucinogenic put a
04:29
bat mask on and i guess just
04:31
run around the tribe going i'm batman
04:36
well they also had jaguar people didn't
04:38
they yes
04:40
they would kill a jaguar get inside
04:42
their flesh and then they would be like
04:44
the main
04:44
warriors so they're not actually despite
04:46
the fact that we call them
04:48
aztecs they're not aztecs well they
04:50
didn't call themselves yeah we've given
04:52
them that name
04:52
yeah they call themselves mexica that's
04:54
right yeah so what how did
04:56
how does that happen that we were all
04:57
cool with still calling them something
04:59
they're not
04:59
feels like another example of good old
05:01
western ignorance yeah it is
05:03
the aztec word for gold do you know what
05:05
that is no
05:06
it is i don't know if i can pronounce
05:08
this tau quit
05:10
lattle which literally means excrement
05:12
of the gods
05:14
gods pooed it right out and then they i
05:16
guess they offered it right back to them
05:18
well montezuma had a nephew called
05:20
kuwait lehuak
05:21
which meant plenty of poo or dried extra
05:24
dried excrement wow montezuma's revenge
05:27
have you heard of that
05:28
that's having a dodgy tummy yeah so this
05:31
guy's name is just
05:32
completely associated montezuma now
05:34
means
05:35
lots and lots and lots of experts yeah
05:39
speaking of excrement and old american
05:41
languages as we were
05:43
so des moines you know the city in iowa
05:45
yeah
05:46
bill bryson's from there is he yeah oh
05:48
well perhaps he knows that a new
05:49
linguistic study has been done which
05:51
shows that the name
05:52
literally probably means [ __ ] face and
05:54
it was a mistake so
05:56
when they were naming it they asked the
05:57
native americans what the place was
05:59
called and they said des moines which
06:00
was the insulting name that they called
06:01
their rival tribe
06:02
which was [ __ ] and now
06:17
he had a zoo
06:25
[Laughter]
06:29
had exotic animals obviously but it also
06:31
include dwarfs albinos and hunchbacks so
06:34
a bit of a human zoo bit of a pc
06:36
nightmare for uh
06:38
if he was still around and if you tried
06:39
to do that today they wouldn't let you
06:41
yeah
06:42
political correctness gone mad
06:48
okay uh let's move on to fact number two
06:50
and that comes from
06:52
you chozinski yes my fact today is that
06:55
in 2011
06:57
china tried to pass up a scene from the
06:58
film top gun as footage of its own air
07:01
force
07:02
that's amazing yep it was it was a state
07:05
broadcaster china central tv or
07:07
obviously as we know it's cctv
07:09
and it was a news bulletin in a report
07:12
about training exercises that were being
07:14
undertaken by the air force
07:15
and it was showing an example of a
07:17
successful strike on an airplane
07:18
and this explosion and i will post it on
07:20
the website in slow motion i mean it's
07:22
the explosion from top gun
07:23
with a straight face reporter going and
07:25
this is them successfully blowing up an
07:27
airplane here
07:28
well topkin was um a propaganda movie
07:31
for america anyway
07:32
it was um partly funded by the pentagon
07:35
was it yeah in order to get people
07:37
to sign up for the military um when it
07:39
was on
07:40
in the cinemas they had um recruitment
07:42
tables in the theaters so that people
07:44
could just sign up
07:45
yeah and apparently that was the highest
07:47
recruitment period they've ever
07:48
had because everyone came out of the
07:50
cinema just buzzing just going girl
07:52
america and and then there was a booth
07:54
and they were like yeah and then
07:57
a month later they find themselves being
07:59
shot at yeah like what what happened
08:00
then
08:01
i thought it was a little bit volleyball
08:02
and showers yeah yeah exactly i have not
08:04
seen top gun
08:05
no i mean so please no spoilers i have
08:08
seen the live stage show of hit
08:10
which featured no props except the guys
08:12
doing planes they held their arms by him
08:16
and that was it they did all the dog
08:17
fights you're kidding it's very bad hour
08:19
talking about uh the fact that
08:21
recruitment went up which it did by 500
08:23
i think recruitment for navy pilots also
08:26
sales of ray bans post top gun this is a
08:28
bit of a spoiler andy if you haven't
08:29
seen it they wear a lot of ray bans oh
08:30
man uh they went up by 40
08:32
did they yeah i love it when something
08:34
influences the market when 50 shades of
08:37
grey
08:37
came out rope sales and hardware store
08:40
went through the roof but also every
08:42
cultural artifact associated with it so
08:43
there's that is it's been
08:44
allium there's a classical music piece
08:47
which is referred to quite a lot in the
08:48
book
08:49
and sales of that absolutely rocketed
08:51
there was a new story when john prescott
08:53
was
08:54
found playing croquet on his lawn and
08:56
the um sales of croquet sets went up by
08:58
three times
08:59
wow i thought you're gonna say they
09:01
plummeted
09:02
everyone returning their crew no such
09:04
thing as bad publicity
09:06
okay world well china have got a form on
09:08
this haven't they because at the
09:09
olympics in 2008 didn't they have one
09:12
adorable looking girl singing a song at
09:14
the opening ceremony
09:15
and it was revealed that she had not
09:17
actually been the one singing they had a
09:18
slightly less telegenic girl
09:20
yeah behind a screen somewhere maybe
09:22
locked in an attic just singing into a
09:24
microphone
09:25
you mentioned china having form there
09:27
are a couple of other amusing
09:29
chinese news agency stories a few years
09:32
ago the state news agency published a
09:33
health report
09:34
and it was illustrated with this x-ray
09:36
scan of a human head but they use an
09:38
x-ray scan of homer simpson's head
09:40
and if you look it up i mean it's over
09:41
simpson's head
09:43
with that that one where he has a very
09:44
very tiny brain yeah exactly
09:46
two monkeys like picking flames off each
09:48
other it's the tiny brain
09:51
i'm just on the wikipedia page for
09:52
propaganda in the people's republic of
09:54
china and uh there's nothing there
09:58
well that's i remember a story when i
09:59
when i first started with qi uh
10:01
it was a fact that i found it was that
10:03
when china realized
10:05
the power of the internet they got
10:07
really nervous so they hired a man
10:10
to sort it out gave him a computer sat
10:12
in a room
10:13
he came at the end of the day going this
10:15
is a bit bigger than we realized
10:19
one dude who was meant to literally go
10:20
through every forum going
10:22
hey you guys stop talking about that
10:26
there's just been a recruitment drive in
10:27
the chinese military
10:29
and they've changed the rules slightly
10:30
to get more people in the
10:32
in the army so they've introduced new
10:34
height requirements
10:35
which have been reduced by two
10:36
centimeters so slightly shorter people
10:38
can get in
10:39
uh they've changed the weight
10:40
restrictions because actually
10:42
most people have put on more weight
10:44
because of obesity crisis
10:46
they've reduced eyesight requirements so
10:48
people who are more short-sighted can
10:49
now get in
10:50
and they're allowing people with tattoos
10:52
which they didn't before
10:54
wow so the chinese army will now be very
10:56
short
10:57
fat tattooed short-sighted and
11:00
probably running the wrong way because
11:01
they can't see where they're going um
11:04
haven't we just changed the rules for
11:05
the british army reserve so that you can
11:07
now have face or neck tattoos
11:09
neck tattoos sound very painful to me i
11:10
did read a book about a guy who got one
11:12
tattooed in the second world war on the
11:13
inside of his foreskin
11:15
saying hi doc yeah for medical
11:18
examinations and things like that
11:20
so there's a real top gun school but
11:22
supposedly you get a five dollar
11:24
fine if anyone on the staff quotes the
11:27
movie top gun
11:28
so it's it's way it's military planning
11:30
uh military training for
11:31
they should call it military planning
11:33
that saves time which is vital in the
11:34
heat of battle

11:51
in 2013 india's army spent six months
11:54
watching chinese spy drones violating
11:57
its airspace
11:58
only to find out that they were actually
11:59
jupiter and venus
12:01
oh that is embarrassing
12:04
um we were talking about immediate
12:05
mistakes and this is just my favorite
12:07
one
12:07
in 2008 a christian website was
12:10
publishing a story about tyson gay
12:11
who you know the sprinter tyson gay so
12:13
this christian website in america
12:15
wasn't allowed to use the word gay it
12:16
had an automated system which
12:18
whenever it saw the word gay change it
12:19
to homosexuals so this website published
12:21
an article
12:22
referring to tyson homosexual all the
12:24
way through ties and homosexual was a
12:26
blur and
12:26
blue sprinting 100 meters past anyone
12:28
else has it it means a lot to me the 25
12:31
year old homosexual said
12:33
i'm glad my body could do it
12:36
that's fantastic uh it's called the
12:38
scunthorpe problem isn't it yeah
12:39
when computers um mis represents
12:41
something as being rude
12:43
because of the what four-letter word the
12:45
word yeah people living in scotland
12:47
couldn't put their addresses into
12:48
certain
12:49
computer systems because it had that
12:50
word in another place with that problem
12:52
is a penis stone
12:53
but it looks it's spelt penis tone
12:57
what is a penis tone i wonder can anyone
12:59
impersonate that yeah it's like um
13:02
yeah exactly okay you need to bang a
13:04
fork on it
13:07
[Applause]
13:08
[Music]
13:11
okay time for fact number three and that
13:14
is my fact my fact is that
13:16
in 2003 somebody misplaced the master
13:19
keys to the lawrence livermore national
13:21
laboratory which is the home of the
13:22
fastest computer in the world and it's a
13:24
lab where they develop all science and
13:26
technology for america's national
13:28
security
13:29
due to the loss of these keys they had
13:30
to replace the locks and those locks
13:33
cost one million seven hundred dollars
13:35
to change
13:35
[Music]
13:37
i mean that's that's a good day for a
13:38
locksmith but that's that's
13:40
i mean it makes sense when you hear it
13:42
really because obviously they've got the
13:43
best locks in the world
13:44
what's so great about these locks well
13:46
they like those ones how my mom opens a
13:48
car where you can click them and
13:49
open it ten yards away because that's
13:52
pretty amazing i reckon they're better
13:54
no they can't be yeah i think they've
13:55
got a deadbolt on them because those are
13:57
really good those ones
13:58
you have to have them on your front door
13:59
to get insurance top tip they could be
14:01
like chill blocks they're quite a good
14:02
chub
14:03
there's a nice word as well chub yeah
14:05
also a fish of course either a fish or a
14:06
lock
14:07
don't confuse them and then what's
14:09
because
14:10
a lock is part of a canal system which
14:12
has water which is also a place where
14:14
fish can live that's true
14:16
yeah that's probably where the the
14:17
connection happened
14:19
yeah yeah okay that's enough for that
14:21
fact
14:23
i feel like no one's taking my fact
14:24
seriously no no
14:26
no no we're not
14:29
have you guys read about volvo's new
14:31
plan i think it's only announced this
14:32
year so they remotely unlock your car
14:34
and deliver your shopping into it and
14:36
then leave again but you'd call tesco
14:38
and be like deliver my shopping to my
14:40
car click that option on your tesco
14:42
online shop
14:43
they arrive give you a text you go okay
14:44
yeah you can unlock it isn't that cool
14:46
so you'd sit in the office do your
14:47
online shop go back to your car and it's
14:48
just there
14:49
it's a bit we i mean it sounds like
14:50
we're heading to sort of like i've
14:52
ordered takeaway they literally
14:53
they come through my front door and just
14:55
put the food in my mouth
14:59
um i have i have zipcar in london and
15:01
you open
15:02
you can open those with your mobile
15:03
phone yeah me too i always find it
15:05
incredible
15:05
i have another example of that lock
15:08
changing
15:08
disaster oh yeah this was a few years
15:11
ago in 2006 at feltham young offenders
15:14
institution
15:15
they had to spend 250 000 pounds
15:17
changing the locks
15:18
basically a tv news crew had been in and
15:20
they had filmed a prison key
15:23
and as a result all the locks had to be
15:26
changed well in case somebody saw the
15:27
footage and could
15:28
recreate that key okay somebody took a
15:30
photo printed the photo made it a 3d
15:33
model
15:33
pressed it into a cake of soap you'd
15:35
have to have a very high definition tv
15:37
to get that key right
15:38
yeah that's true that's what also
15:39
happens on tv when we want to put a
15:41
photograph of a banknote or something
15:43
they make you put specimen on it so
15:45
people can't
15:46
take a photo of the screen print off the
15:48
photo and then
15:49
pass it off as money also this is so
15:51
cool banknotes have little
15:53
things on them little circles in
15:54
patterns which stop photocopiers from
15:56
photocopying them it's amazing i read
15:59
that yeah
16:00
but then i got a banknote and tried to
16:02
photocopy it on my
16:03
photocopier and it worked oh in
16:06
september 2012
16:08
you could buy a set of master keys for
16:10
new york city on ebay
16:11
and the newspapers went a bit crazy
16:13
about it and said it was a terrorist
16:15
dream come
16:16
true and it's supposed to be able to
16:18
help you um turn off
16:19
elevators in public buildings but of
16:22
course in order to do that you'd have to
16:23
get past
16:24
all of the security to get into the
16:26
building in the first place well this
16:27
this is the thing you think that
16:28
these places would have incredible
16:30
security so like number 10 downing
16:32
street
16:32
has a phenomenal lock system in that it
16:35
has
16:36
no lock or no door handle it's just
16:37
nothing on the front of the door you can
16:39
only open it from the inside once you
16:40
get inside
16:41
what happens you can open the door any
16:42
time you like yeah what happens if
16:44
everyone goes out
16:45
this is the problem that means that that
16:47
house is never not occupied how often do
16:48
you think that screws up and david
16:50
cameron's left sitting on his doorstep
16:51
well apparently
16:52
i don't know how often someone's left
16:54
outside but apparently
16:55
in the first five years that tony blair
16:57
was at downing street
16:59
37 computers four mobile phones two
17:01
cameras a mini disc player a video
17:02
recorder four princes two projectors and
17:04
a bicycle was stolen
17:06
from the building wow how does that
17:08
happen it's so it's bomb proof the door
17:10
it's a bit of bomb-proof metal it was
17:12
originally made of oak and then there
17:13
was an ira attack
17:14
uh mortar was uh launched into the back
17:17
garden of number 10 in 1991.
17:18
do you guys remember when gordon brown
17:21
got locked in a toilet had to be rescued
17:22
by tony blair i think it was in the
17:23
early 90s
17:24
when uh they went they went to discuss
17:26
the potential leadership in the early
17:27
90s and they were having this meeting
17:29
gordon brown went to the loo
17:30
tony waited there for 15 minutes like
17:32
what is going on the phone rang he
17:33
didn't answer because he wasn't at his
17:34
own house
17:35
and the aunt's phone came on and it was
17:36
gordon brown upstairs going hello
17:39
tony i'm uh i'm stuck in the toilet can
17:41
you go and get me out
17:42
is it because the toilet in 10 downing
17:45
street doesn't have a hammer
17:49
speaking of stealing things there was in
17:50
the eu summit in the
17:52
2000s and the catering staff went on
17:55
strike because they weren't being paid
17:56
and so
17:57
when all the politicians and the admin
18:00
people whatever went for lunch there was
18:01
no staff there
18:02
and they raided the whole thing and
18:04
stole all the cutlery
18:05
wow okay does this maybe explain where
18:07
all our forks have gone
18:09
from the qi office big scandal in the qi
18:12
office at the moment supposedly i've
18:13
been throwing all the forks into the bin
18:16
around there is no proof whatsoever
18:19
because you know
18:20
you don't remember doing it um i just
18:21
want to quickly turn it to uh
18:23
this laboratory which looks after the
18:25
super computers of the world
18:26
and there was an old fact i remember
18:28
which i think james you found ages ago
18:30
which was that deep blue
18:31
was the first computer to be a grand
18:33
master at chess but its subsequent
18:35
career most people when you win a major
18:37
championship you know there's a lot of
18:38
glory a book deal and so on
18:40
it now uh works as a reservationist for
18:42
a u.s airline so it just deals with
18:44
reservations yeah they
18:46
they split it into two pieces one half
18:48
went to a museum and the other half
18:49
worked for
18:50
panama wow american airlines wow i'm
18:52
glad that doesn't happen with people
18:55
actually like this carlson
18:57
is currently in the oslo museum half is
18:59
a trolley dolly with
19:00
uh oslo i i read as well that it they've
19:04
worked out that if you
19:05
took all the information on the internet
19:07
and you were to save it do you know
19:09
how many blu-ray discs it would take to
19:11
save the entire internet
19:14
how many if you fit it all onto blu-ray
19:15
discs is that a weirdly small number
19:17
like yeah
19:18
three weirdly it is quite small um 200
19:20
million
19:21
which is i think i think that's quite
19:23
small actually i agree
19:24
where are you going to put these you're
19:27
going to need a big shelving unit
19:29
and the admin will be a nightmare that's
19:31
true when you're trying to get your
19:32
favorite cat video
19:34
why didn't you alphabetize these would
19:37
you know how many emails are sent per
19:38
day
19:39
many millions no how long is it 247
19:43
billion
19:44
wow the fastest ever internet connection
19:46
this fact's a few years old so it
19:48
probably isn't anymore but this was
19:50
a lady called sigrid lothberg and she
19:53
had an internet connection which was 40
19:55
gigabytes per second
19:56
and it was put in by her son who was in
19:58
swedish internet legend peter loughberg
20:01
and uh what did she do with it she dried
20:04
her washing on it
20:05
because it gave off so much heat and she
20:07
didn't know what else to do with it so
20:08
she tried her washing with it
20:09
that's great did you guys know that
20:11
internet on the moon now is faster than
20:13
in most parts of rural britain
20:14
what how do you get into like they call
20:16
it broadband that's how it was released
20:19
imagine holding your phone up and trying
20:20
to speak to siri through your helmet
20:22
yeah it'll be very hard to tap your
20:25
phone properly with those gloves
20:28
[Applause]
20:29
[Music]
20:33
okay it's time for the final facts of
20:36
this episode and we head over to
20:38
andrew hunter murray my fact is
20:41
did you know that ken is officially an
20:43
accessory to barbie
20:51
yeah this is very weird okay so the
20:54
barbie and ken origin the original
20:55
barbie and ken
20:56
ken was named after the son of the
20:58
inventors of barbie but barbie was named
21:00
after their daughter
21:01
barbara oh yes it's just quite clearly a
21:04
sort of brother-sister
21:05
thing um and ruth the the wife of the
21:08
couple who invented
21:09
barbie and ken argued for a bulge in his
21:11
groin but the design team refused to put
21:13
one in
21:14
yeah he is he's famously bereft
21:17
underneath those certainly is trousers
21:19
yeah um there is a
21:20
trailer trash doll you can buy in
21:22
america um it's called turlane
21:25
it's a pregnant doll from 2005 and she's
21:28
one of these talking dolls
21:30
and her catchphrases include if the
21:32
trailers are rocking
21:34
don't come a knocking and pouring me a
21:37
double i'm drinking for two
21:39
whoa does she ever give birth in some
21:42
kind of traumatic
21:44
sound in life josh can you imagine that
21:45
doll giving birth doll
21:47
they've got to make it well they were
21:48
used for good dolls
21:50
during brown versus the board of
21:52
education when civil rights legislation
21:54
was overturned in 1954
21:55
it was one of the first cases where a
21:58
supreme court
21:58
cited a social study in its reasons for
22:01
making a certain decision
22:02
so this was when america agreed that
22:05
segregation was a negative thing and had
22:06
a negative effect on
22:07
the people who were subject to it and
22:09
what they did was in the experiment they
22:11
brought black and white dolls to schools
22:12
that were segregated so black schools
22:14
and they'd show the kids a black doll
22:15
and a white doll and get them to say
22:17
which one do you think is a good doll
22:18
and which is a bad doll and all the kids
22:19
will go oh the white one's a good doll i
22:20
want to play with the white one because
22:21
that's
22:21
what they've been brought up to think
22:23
and then they'd ask them okay and which
22:24
door do you think is
22:25
more like you and almost all the kids
22:27
got really really upset meeting like
22:29
cried or ran out of the room because
22:30
suddenly they were
22:31
identifying themselves with a doll they
22:33
just said was the bad doll
22:34
and that was cited by the supreme court
22:36
when round basketball education
22:38
came to its conclusion that is really
22:40
interesting yeah yeah
22:41
yeah here's another good use for a doll
22:43
which is it's a nice use but
22:44
perhaps not as worthy as your use and
22:47
there was a chinese guy whose wife had
22:49
died
22:49
and he became rather attached to his
22:51
blow-up doll
22:52
and everyone started taking the mickey
22:54
out of him a little bit and he got very
22:56
upset
22:56
and so he decided to end it all and
22:59
eyewitnesses at the scene were
23:00
horrified to see him plummet from the
23:02
building holding what they thought was a
23:05
child
23:05
but was actually his blow-up doll and he
23:08
very romantically jumped off the
23:10
building with his blow-up doll uh landed
23:12
on the doll the doll exploded
23:14
and he survived wow
23:17
she gave her life for him exactly it's
23:19
romantic very romantic that must have
23:22
been a horrific moment
23:23
everyone saw this what they thought was
23:24
a child explode
23:29
you can get this is slightly
23:30
controversial dope on a rope dope on a
23:32
rope was
23:33
saddam hussein with a noose around his
23:35
neck um which was commemorating his
23:37
death it's from a website
23:39
called hero builders and they've got
23:40
over 100 satirical figures that you can
23:43
get including
23:44
tony blair as an action man uh you can
23:46
get george bush as a superhero michael
23:48
jackson holding a baby over
23:51
there gordon brown comes with his own
23:53
portaloo
23:56
that'll be the same company probably
23:57
which in 2002
23:59
osama bin laden dolls dramatically
24:01
outsold tony blair dolls really i think
24:03
it was a bit of an embarrassment
24:04
yeah really yeah well that was not the
24:06
only firm to make
24:07
osama bin laden dolls because in 2005
24:09
the cia
24:10
made a custom-made bin laden action
24:13
figure
24:13
which they were thinking about
24:15
distributing to children in the middle
24:17
east
24:17
and the face would peel off and reveal a
24:19
much scarier red face with demonic eyes
24:22
and you know
24:22
oh wow so with usage of the toy suddenly
24:25
satan would appear
24:27
yeah exactly feeling wow yeah okay so
24:29
that would that would apparently put
24:30
children off that would apparently make
24:32
children support the war on terror more
24:34
we put them off dolls they put them off
24:36
dolls yeah no kids love that kind of
24:37
thing don't they
24:38
yeah that's true it's like it's like a
24:40
one-way rubbish transformer that doll
24:42
also if you didn't explain the toy was
24:44
going to do that potentially that was
24:46
the most costly thing that they've ever
24:47
done in the cia with all the recalls of
24:49
people sending in the toy back going
24:51
you realize there was a demon face
24:53
underneath this
24:56
i thought it was suspicious when the cia
24:58
was selling dolls
25:00
hey by the way just with the with the
25:02
idea of osama being turned into
25:04
into a doll when i read that story it
25:07
made me think about
25:08
sort of villain merchandise or dictator
25:11
merchandise
25:11
because they always i just i just
25:13
suddenly remembered that people like
25:14
saddam hussein used to publish
25:16
novels oh he did yeah he had four novels
25:19
and two of the novels actually were
25:20
published in japan
25:21
and sold in shops and a surprising
25:24
number of people wrote like gaddafi
25:25
wrote a novel
25:26
was a collection of short stories and it
25:29
was called escape to hell and so did kim
25:31
il-sung the turkmen dictator sapamura
25:34
niyazov
25:35
wrote a book of his spiritual thoughts
25:36
which became required reading if you
25:38
wanted to pass your driving test
25:41
that's kind of completely completely
25:43
barking mad
25:44
there seems to be a genre of dictator
25:46
lit i think
25:48
yeah so i was yeah i was trying to find
25:52
dicklet on uh online
25:53
and you came up with some terrible
25:55
google results yeah yeah it's got about
25:56
100 million blu-rays of it now
26:00
but if you go to uh if you go to
26:02
goodreads one thing that goodreads has
26:04
so while twitter has followers and
26:06
facebook has likes
26:08
goodreads has fans you've become a fan
26:10
of an author
26:12
oh no so kim il-sung
26:15
has one fan mousey tongue has 40 fans
26:20
mussolini has 20 fans gadhafi has 34
26:23
fans and hitler 390 fans
26:26
oh great yeah loving his book work
26:30
minecamp obviously very popular and it's
26:32
sequel
26:33
had a sequel minecamp had a secret
26:35
sequel to minecraft in 1935
26:37
called zweit book which literally means
26:39
second book i guess he'd run out of
26:40
imagination
26:42
maybe the editors said i think we should
26:43
remove that difficult
26:45
from the title

00:04
there's no such thing as a fish no
00:05
seriously it's in
00:06
the oxford dictionary of underwater life
00:10
it says it right there first paragraph
00:11
no such thing as a fish
00:17
[Applause]
00:20
hello and welcome to another edition of
00:22
no such thing as a fish coming to you
00:24
from the qi offices in covent garden my
00:26
name is dan schreiber i'm sitting here
00:28
with three other elves anna chazinski
00:30
james harkin and ann miller and we've
00:33
gone fact checking judy's today
00:34
alex bell and once again we've gathered
00:37
around the microphone to share our
00:38
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:40
so
00:40
in no particular order here we go
00:45
fact number one james um okay my fact
00:49
is the world record for most kicks to
00:51
one's own head is 127 in a minute
00:56
more than two seconds that's more than
00:57
two seconds that's
00:59
a lot of kicks how did he do it well
01:01
there's a video on the guinness book of
01:03
records website i think
01:04
uh it's i think he's like kind of um a
01:07
martial arts guy
01:08
and he's very supple and and fast and
01:11
and
01:12
possibly stupid and possibly slightly
01:14
mental
01:15
but that means for him to do that speed
01:17
he has to be going like literally
01:21
is he related to roy kirby who i know
01:24
is the guy who's broken the guinness
01:26
world record he's also a martial arts
01:27
guy for
01:28
the hardest kick to the groin i think
01:31
he took he took a 22 mile an hour kick
01:34
to the groin with
01:36
1 100 pounds of force and didn't
01:38
register any pain at all he said
01:40
yeah he's built up a pain threshold
01:42
apparently they do it in a certain
01:43
there's a certain type of martial art
01:44
and i can't remember what it's called
01:46
where basically you run hard objects
01:47
over your muscles every day and it sort
01:49
of
01:49
pulverizes the nerve fibers and causes
01:52
fractures to the bone and then when they
01:54
heal the body compensates by adding
01:56
extra calcium to you which
01:57
means that you stop feeling pain um
01:59
here's a newspaper article that i found
02:02
which is somewhat related to ana's fact
02:04
yeah um
02:05
a 28 year old man who claimed to be
02:07
acting out of
02:08
curiosity when he asked seven women to
02:10
kick him in the groin
02:12
was sentenced yesterday to 60 days in
02:14
jail one of the women afraid of what he
02:16
might do if she refused kicked him
02:17
repeatedly
02:18
oh my god the guy thanked her and left
02:21
on his bicycle
02:22
he had no seat so
02:25
the court um asked his wife and what she
02:28
thought about it
02:29
and she told the card that she was at a
02:30
loss to explain his conduct
02:32
and she said i can honestly say i find
02:34
it as odd and peculiar
02:36
and disturbing as everyone else
02:39
um i wanted to look more into this guy
02:41
joel leindecker he's the guy who kicked
02:42
himself in the head 127 times
02:44
he's broken his own record a number of
02:46
times so on one of the occasions
02:49
he was interviewed by someone and they
02:51
said can i see an example of you doing
02:53
this and
02:54
and he said yeah sure um and so he did
02:56
it he only managed 80.
02:57
but what was great was the interview
02:59
afterwards the interview is going
03:01
wow i don't know what to say after
03:03
seeing such a spectacle how do you feel
03:04
who's breathing heavily he's like i'm
03:06
really exhausted it's really tiring
03:09
and she starts trying to interview him
03:11
and he just keeps getting more and more
03:13
concussed and out of it and yeah she's
03:16
she says um so how often do you do this
03:19
and he's like well i pretty much only do
03:20
it when i know that i'm gonna be making
03:22
a record attempt
03:23
i don't really practice in my spare time
03:25
or anything
03:26
sorry can i get a second i'm really i'm
03:28
really light-headed right now
03:30
she goes sure don't pass out he bends
03:32
down hands on these takes deep breaths
03:34
i might actually have to sit down or
03:35
something would you mind if can we do
03:37
this
03:38
interview inside she basically is just
03:40
totally concussed off the back of it
03:42
and the first time he did it he did it
03:44
with shoes on and he didn't
03:46
know that he should have done that so
03:47
now he does it with either socks
03:49
socks yeah he should wear slippers
03:50
you're right no he does it barefoot or
03:52
with socks on
03:53
i imagine the interview would be like so
03:54
how do you feel about kicking yourself
03:56
127 times in the head he's like
03:59
what are you talking about
04:04
there's another guinness world record
04:06
champ and he's called ashrita furman
04:08
and he was born the year the first
04:09
guinness book of world records came out
04:11
and he holds the guinness world record
04:12
for holding the most guinness world
04:13
records
04:14
ah so he's had 533 and 189 are still
04:18
active
04:19
and they include pogo stick jumping
04:21
underwater popcorn sculpture
04:22
balancing most eggs on head m m's eating
04:25
blindfolded with chopsticks and drinking
04:27
200 milliliters of mustard
04:29
wow wow so the really serious records
04:31
yeah
04:32
does it include yeah does it include
04:34
this one longest distance pulled by a
04:36
horse
04:37
while on fire i've seen that guy
04:41
yeah yeah he was dragged 1551 feet while
04:45
on fire
04:46
by a horse um i think the funnest world
04:48
record to break
04:49
is the most rotations hanging from a
04:50
power drill in a minute which is 148
04:53
it was in 2008 um but isn't that fun so
04:56
this guy just attached a power jaw to
04:57
the ceiling held onto it and just span
04:59
around on it for a minute i want to
05:00
start doing that recreationally
05:02
that is great the grossest one i found
05:04
was for this distance of squirting milk
05:06
from eyes
05:07
nice oh wow 279.5 centimeters
05:10
why is milk coming out of your eyes
05:11
shouldn't you see anything about that
05:13
yeah people do it by um because their
05:15
sinuses are all
05:16
attached and they snort it through their
05:18
nose and shoot it through their eyes
05:20
i think students do it i had a friend at
05:22
school they could put a whole cocktail
05:23
stick up his nose
05:24
don't do that they can kill you oh that
05:25
was his party alfred kinsey could put a
05:27
whole
05:28
toothbrush up his penis crystalline
05:30
first
05:31
what really yeah he's a sexologist
05:34
alfred kinsey
05:35
i don't know where is he from the 50s
05:37
right yeah yeah he uh his party trick
05:39
was to put um
05:40
a party trick he wants to see that wait
05:43
wait i've got a great okay
05:44
the guy who got women to kick him in the
05:46
balls was arrested i hope he was
05:47
arrested at some point
05:48
shall we invite alfred to the wedding
05:50
well
05:52
can we search his bag on the way in if
05:54
there's a toothbrush in there
05:55
no way in 2009 jonathan lee riches
05:59
filed an injunction against the guinness
06:01
book of records seeking to stop them
06:03
from naming him as the most litigious
06:05
individual in the history of mankind
06:07
brilliant we might have to bleep his
06:10
name out of this podcast
06:11
yeah that's brilliant evil knievel used
06:14
to have a lot of world records
06:15
remember him he would jump over buses on
06:18
a bike and stuff like that
06:19
as far as i can see i think there is one
06:21
record that he still owns this is really
06:23
hard to google but i think
06:24
there's one thing that he still owns can
06:26
you guess what it is most bones broken
06:28
is correct is it really yes
06:31
yeah i just that's one thing that i know
06:34
about him because you watch
06:35
videos of him but it's it's it's
06:36
actually in terms of sharden freud
06:38
the funniest video is online because you
06:41
see this
06:42
man like just like yeah i'm gonna own it
06:44
look at these buses
06:45
i'm gonna go right over there but it's
06:47
gonna be awesome and every single time
06:50
he just collapses and just flies across
06:53
the ground
06:54
the guy who has relatedly the guy who
06:56
has the record for the furthest ever
06:57
flown in a car crash
06:58
was matthew mcknight it was in 2008 and
07:00
he flew 118
07:02
feet but while he was recovering in
07:04
hospital his doctor brought him the
07:06
forms to sign the guinness forms to sign
07:07
to prove that he had flown further than
07:09
anyone else which i just think
07:10
is a very unsympathetic doctor move like
07:13
a couple of days he broke like all of
07:15
his bones but not enough to get that
07:16
record
07:17
yeah not as many as an evil yeah correct
07:19
we should try and think up
07:21
a record that we can break well here's
07:22
one that we could break yeah
07:24
and the most ferrero rochers eaten in
07:26
one minute is ten
07:28
oh
07:31
is it like crackers they draw your mouth
07:33
so you think it's easy or is it cinnamon
07:35
in the middle they have like it's kind
07:37
of liquidy yeah
07:39
yeah alex have you got anything to add
07:40
before we wrap up uh yeah i did find
07:42
that in 2006 the man who holds the world
07:44
record for spending the most time in a
07:46
cage with centipedes married the woman
07:47
who held the same record but with
07:49
scorpions
07:50
oh that's great
07:52
[Applause]
07:56
okay it's time now to move on to fact
07:58
number two and
07:59
yes there is a bear in the pyrenees who
08:02
is facing castration
08:03
because he has fathered nearly all the
08:04
other bears oh that's a bit harsh
08:07
i think it's harsh well it's on him i
08:09
would i would say well done him he's
08:11
amazing he's called pyros
08:12
and there are about 30 bears and there
08:14
are only four other males and none of
08:16
them have followed any bears themselves
08:18
but the problem is officials don't like
08:19
it because they're worried that he's
08:20
ruining their gene pool basically and
08:22
there's recently a bear born that was
08:23
his daughter and his granddaughter and
08:25
they started to get a bit worried
08:27
that this is problematic the problem
08:29
with pirates is um bears generally
08:31
stopped being sexually active around 19
08:33
but pyros is 26 and still going wow
08:36
are the birds becoming increasingly more
08:37
deformed i think i think a bear always
08:40
looks pretty good so you
08:41
can't tell they're deformed under all
08:42
their fur well pliny didn't think that
08:44
was true
08:44
he thought when a baby bear was born it
08:46
was completely shapeless
08:48
and that they got into their bare shape
08:50
by being licked into shape by their
08:52
mothers
08:53
i think everything when it's brand new
08:54
is quite a strange shape and then they
08:55
start getting more of their shape
08:57
when they're yeah that's a good excuse
08:58
i'm not sure what his excuse was for
09:00
saying that they had very dim eyes when
09:02
they're born
09:03
and the way that they get their eyes
09:04
better is to allow bees to sting their
09:06
faces
09:08
to improve their eyesight i was uh i got
09:11
very interested in the idea of this bear
09:12
because um i didn't realize that their
09:15
sex drive was so high
09:16
so i did a very quick google on it i
09:18
didn't get very far
09:19
what did you google pony bears
09:23
that means something very different in
09:24
the gay community which i didn't i
09:26
completely forgot i did know that i
09:28
completely forgot so just anyone out
09:29
there if you do click
09:30
uh horny bear into google uh don't then
09:33
click on the link that says my favorite
09:34
hot and horny bears certainly don't do
09:36
it at work
09:38
imagine what that we're all completely
09:40
misunderstanding this news article
09:42
oh yeah oh dear okay there's a bear in
09:45
the bible
09:46
there's a few actually but one of them i
09:48
like um the biblical prophet
09:50
elijah once cursed a group of children
09:52
who teased him for being bold
09:54
uh as a result they were mauled by bears
09:56
and killed yeah
09:57
i love that story because it's something
10:00
ridiculous like
10:01
42 kids like a lot of children and
10:03
they're like baldy baldy and he's like
10:05
right fine you're going to get killed by
10:06
bears yeah
10:08
so do you know what what you had to do
10:09
if you're attacked by birds i think we
10:10
covered this
10:12
yeah that's right so you might be
10:14
attacked by a brown bear or a black bear
10:16
yes uh the problem is that brown players
10:18
are sometimes black and black bears are
10:20
sometimes brown so it's hard to tell
10:22
if you're attacked by a brown bear
10:25
then you should play dead but if you're
10:27
attacked by a black bear and you play
10:28
dead you'll
10:29
almost certainly be killed yeah these
10:31
interests are like wow
10:32
oh yeah and they're just like oh this is
10:34
so much easier i also be like i want a
10:36
chase i don't really just like pirates
10:40
uh peter the great trained up two bears
10:44
he had two white bears to serve vodka to
10:46
his guests
10:47
and if they didn't accept the vodka then
10:49
he would train the bear to harass them
10:51
which i think might explain russia's
10:52
vodka problem because you're not going
10:54
to turn down vodka
10:55
from an angry bear what do you mean
10:56
harass them
11:00
the other thing is a white bear is
11:02
presumably a polar bear yeah
11:04
my favorite kind of bear is a spectacled
11:05
bear they actually have markings like
11:07
they're wearing a pair of glasses
11:08
they're amazing if you haven't seen them
11:09
look them up isn't paddington based on
11:11
where i was going because
11:13
they are the only bear um found in south
11:15
america
11:16
so paddington by default must be a
11:17
spectacled bear but of course we know
11:19
he's not a puller but i like the idea of
11:20
paddington with glasses
11:21
and paddington is originally going to be
11:23
from deepest darkest africa but the
11:25
problem with that is there are no bears
11:27
yeah that makes sense is it true that
11:29
byron had a bear
11:30
yeah yeah so that's that's true we've
11:32
discussed this in the podcast actually
11:33
but why not to oxford
11:34
any time that i've seen um news about
11:37
this bear the one thing that doesn't
11:38
come up is the name of the bear
11:40
oh how do we know that he had a bear yet
11:42
the name of the bear has not made it
11:44
through
11:44
one more bear thing um i didn't know was
11:47
that during the cold war in the 1960s
11:49
americans tested their supersonic jet
11:52
ejector seats on bears
11:54
and they fired bears out of the ejector
11:56
seats and then tested how safely they
11:58
landed and they survived actually but
11:59
then they had to put the bears down to
12:00
study
12:01
what had happened to their spines and
12:02
what happened to their internal organs
12:04
so
12:04
they were launching bears out of
12:06
airplanes yeah there were pictures these
12:08
bears look pretty terrifying how did
12:10
they get a bear
12:10
in an ejector seat yeah they must have
12:12
been drug they were drugs
12:14
so um we did the thing on qi about the
12:16
pig face ladies
12:17
which was actually a shaved bear in a
12:19
dress yeah and they used to get the
12:21
bears really drunk before they shaved
12:22
them
12:23
yeah that's insane hey do you know what
12:25
a uh
12:26
it's either the pronunciation is tap it
12:28
or to pair
12:29
i'm not sure what the pronunciation is
12:31
associated with bears do you know what
12:33
that is
12:33
t-a-p-p-e-t i don't think i know that
12:36
word
12:36
it's basically the um blockage that is
12:40
created when they go into hibernation
12:42
like a butt plug it's a butt plug yeah a
12:44
plug of hair that uh
12:45
yeah it's amazing that for seven months
12:48
they can sleep they don't eat drink
12:50
urinate defecate how do you do that
12:51
seven months that's like
12:53
by plugging up your butt i am my mind's
12:55
blown by hibernation yeah no
12:57
they do they don't have a night they're
12:59
going to topper and um
13:00
which is slightly different but some
13:02
female bears can
13:04
give birth while they're asleep what
13:06
yeah wow
13:07
it's not not all of them but some of
13:09
them they must have a seriously high
13:10
pain threshold
13:11
i think they just pass out drunk for a
13:12
full seven months that kind of explains
13:14
that and they do like alcohol well void
13:16
check the bear loved beer didn't he
13:18
who helped the polls in world war ii
13:21
um carrying artillery back and forth
13:23
okay um
13:25
but his favorite drink was beer and he
13:26
loved his cigarette
13:28
this was a bear yeah voice check the
13:30
butt he's really famous i think there's
13:31
a statue of him in prince's street now
13:32
in edinburgh because
13:34
he you spent the rest of his days in
13:35
scotland i think good place well we've
13:36
also got that um penguin edinburgh zoo
13:38
and neil's olaf is he a
13:40
norwegian guard yeah a nighthood um we
13:43
are going to have to move on
13:44
alex uh have you got anything you want
13:46
to add uh only that byron's bear was
13:48
called bruin
13:49
we know his name yep oh okay bruin is
13:52
just a name for a bear though really
13:53
isn't it probably
13:54
it also just sounds like a misspelling
13:55
of byron i'm sure
13:58
i wouldn't write that down wrong at
14:00
cambridge
14:04
okay it's time to move on to fact number
14:07
three
14:07
and that's my fact and that is poland's
14:11
only official ghost hunter thinks that
14:13
ghosts have given up on haunting humans
14:15
ah
14:16
yeah now it's amazing that poland has an
14:17
official registered ghost hunter to
14:20
begin with
14:20
yeah uh secondly he's very dispirited
14:23
because he thinks that we've become all
14:24
too skeptical and that
14:26
ghosts are no longer interested in
14:27
humans or it could be that he's a very
14:29
very bad hunter and he just can't find
14:31
them because he's a rubbish hunter and
14:32
he's blaming it on them disappearing
14:34
that's very true i mean i i know that in
14:37
bhutan there's an official yeti hunter
14:39
yeah yeah and he's been working for the
14:40
king he's under his second king now
14:42
because the new king took over and he's
14:43
been
14:44
working with him for something like 20
14:46
odd years
14:47
and uh nothing he's you know yeah but he
14:50
but what he said is is the reason we
14:52
haven't seen any is that a they have the
14:53
ability to turn themselves invisible
14:55
secondly he says that they have the
14:56
ability to take their feet off and put
14:58
them back on the other way around so
14:59
when it looks like they've walked one
15:00
way in fact they've gone the other
15:02
sneaky very hard to tell where yeti's
15:04
gone well i've been to bhutan they have
15:06
a yeti
15:07
sanctuary don't they they do sanctuary
15:09
yes they have a yeti park
15:11
it's an actual yeti park where there are
15:13
like park rangers
15:14
we look after the yetis um so when you
15:16
say an official ghost hunter is this
15:18
like a government-sanctioned post
15:20
yeah but i mean presumably he's just a
15:21
private guy and people pay him to go and
15:23
hunt for
15:23
yeah i think i think that's what it is
15:24
and people have stopped paying him now
15:26
because they don't believe in ghosts
15:26
anymore and he's a bit pissed off so
15:28
he's decided to claim that the ghosts
15:29
are angry with people
15:30
i think they might have gone to wales um
15:32
because last year the welsh police force
15:34
received 13 reports of ghosts up from
15:37
only two in 2010.
15:39
bloody polish immigrants is this what
15:41
people are talking about
15:42
when they say that i can say that
15:44
because i'm half polish
15:46
but as well as finding 13 um ghosts in
15:49
wales um south wales police also got
15:51
reports of
15:52
three zombies two werewolves two
15:55
vampires and six witches
15:57
wow i think they're on like a paranormal
15:58
rotor because nottingham
16:00
in 2011 said in the last six years they
16:02
had 34 cases of ghosts and they also had
16:04
46 witchcraft and three ufos all of
16:07
which turned out to be chinese lanterns
16:10
chinese lanterns are often the most
16:12
mistaken object for a ufo
16:14
they did this huge breakdown of
16:16
everything that people thought was a ufo
16:18
and what it actually turned out to be
16:19
and chinese lanterns was way up right at
16:21
the bottom two percent of all ufo
16:23
sightings uh turned out to be the moon
16:25
do you know about the uh the big ghostly
16:28
frenzy that happened in london back in
16:30
1762
16:31
i do not okay this is the story it's
16:33
it's called
16:35
scratching fanny of lane oh yes i
16:37
do know about that
16:39
it's amazing just for anyone who doesn't
16:41
know it in 1762 there was a public
16:43
frenzy in london
16:44
over the ghost of fanny kent scratching
16:47
and knocking coded messages from behind
16:48
the wall of a room where she lived
16:50
the owner of the house sold tickets so
16:52
that you could witness it uh and
16:53
storeholders hold refreshments
16:55
uh to crowds who are gathering outside
16:57
so it's a really big thing the duke of
16:59
york came to see it
17:00
samuel johnson came uh he did a seance
17:02
there but he debunked the whole thing
17:04
wow um and the noise turned out to be
17:06
made by an 11 year old girl called
17:08
elizabeth who was concealed behind the
17:10
wooden board
17:11
uh and was doing it with her uh corset
17:14
but this is the interesting thing is
17:15
that obviously throughout history people
17:17
have reported
17:18
poltergeisty kind of things um and a
17:21
surprising fact that i read is that
17:22
it's mostly associated with pubescent
17:26
girls around 11 and 12 years old yeah
17:28
which is why in all the movies like
17:29
exorcist it's always a young girl but
17:32
james do you wanna do you know anything
17:33
about that like is there any um research
17:35
i know some history of it um you know
17:37
how um sometimes
17:38
um people say if it's if they're trying
17:41
to talk to a ghost they'll say knock
17:43
once for yes and twice for no
17:44
yeah that came from um some
17:47
sisters i can't remember their name i
17:49
think they might be the fox sisters or
17:51
something
17:51
and um they were tricking their parents
17:55
by um setting up a load of levers which
17:57
would make bangs
17:58
underneath the table just for fun really
18:00
but then suddenly all the
18:02
neighbors got involved and then suddenly
18:03
it became really famous across the
18:04
country and then
18:06
eventually they admitted that it was all
18:08
a hoax but yeah that's where that
18:09
once once and twice knocking thing comes
18:12
from okay right um but there have been a
18:13
few over the history about um
18:15
young girls doing things like that yeah
18:17
and the enfield poltergeist
18:18
case which was um an 18 month long
18:21
ghost haunting that happened in up in
18:23
enfield in london we had a guy on uh the
18:26
upcoming series of museum of curiosity
18:27
who
18:28
he's a skeptic but he studied it all and
18:30
and his point about it was the only
18:32
thing that they said
18:33
as a what could be the explanation was
18:35
is that the girl
18:36
in question who was a young 11 to 12
18:38
year old girl at the time
18:39
uh was that she was very clever um but
18:41
he doesn't buy that as an excuse because
18:43
he thinks that was will star wasn't it
18:44
will store yeah
18:46
um but you can see you can see because
18:47
like in your story the not one and two
18:49
knocking that's an 11 year old girl
18:51
in the story of scratching fanny at
18:53
lane that's a
18:54
yeah that's a 11 to 12 year old girl
18:56
maybe 11 to 12 year old girls are
18:58
incredibly clever maybe that's it
18:59
they might be um there's also they're
19:01
quite susceptible to hysteria
19:03
um when you get things happening where
19:06
large groups of people
19:07
all believe something which isn't quite
19:09
true i'll get hiccups
19:10
yeah i'll get hiccups or i'll get a
19:12
laughing fit or whatever often it does
19:14
turn out to be
19:15
um pubescent girls it makes sense based
19:19
on what you know of
19:20
um adolescence yeah the beginning of
19:22
adolescence you're very impressionable
19:23
and there was a cult there's a history
19:25
of like people assuming hysteria and
19:26
girls
19:27
can i tell you about scottish ghost
19:28
tours um when i was really young my mom
19:31
basically put me off them for ages
19:32
because she told me she saw an ad in the
19:34
local paper for a jumper okay alex have
19:38
you got anything you want to add to this
19:39
before we move on uh only if anyone was
19:41
interested in looking up
19:42
uh the origin of the knock once for yes
19:44
twice for no the sisters were called
19:46
margaret and kate fox
19:47
ah they were yeah it was fox hang
19:50
on foxy girls
19:51
i'll just i just want to quickly add
19:53
that this guy in poland this official
19:55
ghost hunter
19:56
um is very upset with the situation does
19:58
want it to change
19:59
um he has a 24-hour hotline that you can
20:02
call him on
20:03
if you have a ghost that you'd like to
20:05
report because he complains that very
20:06
few people now take ghosts seriously so
20:08
even if they do have a paranormal
20:10
experience they tend to ignore it and
20:11
are reluctant to contact him
20:13
and his name is poita shalkovitz
20:17
and if you want to get in contact with
20:18
him there is a hotline or you can email
20:20
him on ghost underscore hunted
20:23
vp.pl well he thinks that people are
20:25
just they see ghosts but they don't care
20:26
enough these days you see a ghost and
20:28
you think whatever i'll just get on with
20:29
my day
20:30
yeah the thing is about ghosts
20:31
apparently is most of them
20:33
are not like see-through people who are
20:36
people in
20:36
sheets or whatever they're just
20:38
normal-looking people which makes me
20:39
think
20:40
they probably are normal people yeah
20:42
yeah that means i see ghosts all the
20:44
time
20:45
yeah you guys for instance and what's
20:47
bruce willis doing in the corner of the
20:49
room
20:55
all right time to move on to fact number
20:58
four
20:59
that is yep my
21:02
fact i found out this week in a recent
21:05
new scientist is
21:06
that fallout from the cold war is being
21:08
used to solve murders
21:10
okay explain right so nuclear testing of
21:14
the us and the ussr between 1952 and
21:16
1963
21:17
caused a massive spike in the carbon 14
21:20
isotope and is the type of carbon that
21:22
you measure the
21:24
degeneration of when you're carbon
21:25
dating to see how old something is
21:27
okay so there's a sudden spike in the
21:28
atmosphere of carbon 14 it was spread
21:30
all over the world
21:32
and then as soon as the weapons ban came
21:35
in
21:35
in 1963 it started declining again
21:39
so you can tell when something died
21:42
by comparing how much carbon 14 in their
21:45
body
21:46
uh to what they call the bomb curve
21:48
which is the gradual decrease of carbon
21:49
14 in the atmosphere since 1963
21:51
you can tell when they died so okay
21:53
that's how you date someone's death so
21:55
it's actually been really useful i just
21:56
like the fact that like in
21:57
hundreds of thousands of years time
21:58
they're going to look at our bodies and
21:59
we'll be the cold war generation because
22:01
our bodies have
22:02
you know quite as much radiation kind of
22:04
all superheroes
22:06
do you know what the perfect um thing
22:09
for forensics is
22:10
apparently it's glitter glitter yeah the
22:13
reason is
22:13
that glitter sticks to you and you can't
22:16
get rid of it no matter what and because
22:18
people just accept it and it's there
22:19
they don't really care about it
22:20
so they just leave it on themselves for
22:22
days and days and days and apparently
22:23
it's
22:24
if you commit a crime in a circus
22:27
for instance or in a child's birthday
22:29
party or something then they can they
22:31
can use the glitter so if someone comes
22:33
and assaults you or murders you you
22:35
should always keep a little box of
22:36
glitter so you can throw it over them at
22:37
the last minute and be like
22:39
it'd be like smart water it's
22:40
interesting as well it must be a big
22:42
period where
22:43
people were testing out new methods like
22:45
forensics and fingerprints and so on and
22:48
we've adopted them as kind of absolute
22:50
truth now for a lot of them
22:51
fingerprints i know is actually slightly
22:54
queried because every different country
22:57
has different requirements for what
22:58
makes up a match of a fingerprint
23:00
so in france and australia they need 12
23:04
identical points
23:05
to make sense of a fingerprint whereas
23:06
in italy they need sixteen
23:09
and in america it just varies from state
23:10
to state of how many
23:12
they're just like he's got fingers yeah
23:14
he's the guy yeah that's our man
23:16
but fingerprinting somehow has made it
23:18
through but there's other ones back in
23:19
the 1970s there was a lady called dr
23:21
louise robbins
23:23
and she was at the university of north
23:24
carolina she declared herself to be the
23:26
world's
23:27
only footprint identification expert
23:30
and she claimed that she could not only
23:32
identify the shoes
23:33
but the person who had been wearing the
23:35
shoes as well and as a result 12 people
23:37
were sent to prison
23:38
and after her death a panel of 135
23:40
forensic experts reviewed her work and
23:43
realized that it was just
23:44
absolute nonsense people went to prison
23:46
12 12. yeah
23:48
wow um actually i really remember
23:50
solving a crime there's a
23:51
i love this story as a 12 year old
23:53
called jessica maple and she went on a
23:56
summer camp called be a junior district
23:58
attorney
23:59
and then um her grandmother had died a
24:01
few years ago and people broke in and
24:02
stole
24:02
stuff from her house and so she used her
24:04
skills and outsmarted the police and
24:06
found the guys that she um went to the
24:08
house found a broken window and
24:09
fingerprints that the police had missed
24:11
and then she told them and then while
24:13
they were following her lead she found
24:15
she
24:15
found a local pawn shop that had all her
24:16
grandma's stuff in it and then they had
24:18
managed to identify the guys who'd taken
24:20
it
24:20
and she was 12. which is good for her so
24:23
just junior district attorney yeah
24:25
i have another thing about kids and this
24:28
is about nuclear stuff there was a boy
24:30
scout in america called david hahn
24:32
and he earned his merit badge in atomic
24:34
energy presumably by
24:35
answering a quiz or something like that
24:37
or making you clear well that's what he
24:39
decided to do he decided he had a badge
24:41
and so he was going to build a nuclear
24:43
reactor and so he collected small
24:45
amounts of radioactive material from
24:47
household goods like smoke detectors
24:49
and built himself a nuclear reactor in
24:51
his shed wow
24:52
and the police accidentally discovered
24:54
it when they were looking for something
24:55
else
24:56
the us government commandeered his
24:58
mother's house uh decontaminated it and
25:00
buried his shed in the desert in utah
25:02
wow
25:03
oh my god but they took his whole shed
25:06
to the desert that's like up for like
25:07
with radiation
25:10
wasn't there a guy in england recently
25:12
who became the youngest person to build
25:13
a nuclear reactor and i might have made
25:15
that up so maybe alex could check it
25:17
i think he lived in i want to say slough
25:19
it was somewhere
25:20
that sounds comically bad really
25:22
glamorous
25:23
but um a 13 year old boy called jamie
25:25
edwards he made it at school
25:27
yeah yeah apparently it's illegal to
25:29
move sheep in wales until they've been
25:31
checked
25:31
to see whether they carry traces of the
25:33
fallout from chernobyl really yeah
25:35
on this particular subject i've got a
25:37
question for you guys oh yeah
25:38
why shouldn't you buy trousers from the
25:40
northern ukraine
25:42
i don't know why shouldn't you buy
25:43
trousers from the northern ukraine
25:45
chernobyl fallout
25:50
ladies and gentlemen that is the joke
25:52
yeah
25:53
just so you know just as a little inside
25:55
bit of behind-the-scenes information
25:57
here
25:58
anna has consistently for the last what
26:00
14 podcasts
26:02
said that same joke and we've cut it out
26:04
every single day
26:05
has refused to have it in the book this
26:07
is the day and you will not hear it in
26:09
this one either
26:10
unless someone else said it it's the
26:11
best joke ever um
26:13
alex do you have anything to add before
26:15
we move on yeah the thing about uh sheep
26:17
in wales being radioactive is right uh
26:18
all the sheep in the highest
26:19
pastures still are exposed to the
26:22
highest levels of
26:23
uh cesium um and so they will have to be
26:25
tested and regulated before they go to
26:27
market
26:27
so for those people that's still
26:28
shagging sheep stop it
26:30
it's very dangerous no yeah i'm not sure
26:34
they do that
26:35
james don't ruin my fantasies because if
26:37
they did the knobs would fall out
26:41
[Applause]

00:11

00:18
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:20
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:22
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:24
covent garden my name is dan schreiber
00:26
i'm sitting here with
00:27
three other elves we've got james harkin
00:29
anna chiczynski
00:30
and on fact-checking duties andy murray
00:33
and we also have a special guest today
00:35
it's the creator of qi it's the chief
00:37
gnome himself
00:38
mr john lloyd today's episode is a
00:41
special one it is a tie-in for the final
00:43
of the 2014 brazilian world cup and we
00:46
are going to be talking about
00:48
nothing but football now this is going
00:50
to be quite interesting given that none
00:51
of us know
00:52
anything about football but we've done
00:53
our research and so we've once again
00:55
gathered around our microphones and
00:56
these are the best football
00:58
facts that we found out from the last
00:59
seven days so no particular order here
01:01
we go
01:03
okay fact number one anna yep my fact is
01:06
that the first known football chant was
01:08
composed by
01:09
elgar the first gnome football champ
01:11
that was in honor of me the chief gnome
01:15
okay let's clarify that elgar wasn't a
01:17
gnome um
01:18
he's obviously one of our most famous
01:21
composers he wrote
01:22
land of hope and glory london of hope
01:24
and glory is often used as a football
01:26
champ
01:27
yes it is isn't it they sing um we hate
01:29
nottingham forest
01:30
we hate everton 2 we hate man united but
01:33
liverpool we love you
01:34
and they always change the teams but the
01:36
first team always seems to be nottingham
01:38
forest because it scans properly
01:40
which is a bit harsh i'm not in a forest
01:41
like every team hates them
01:43
the other thing about elgar he's the
01:45
only major composer to have mastered the
01:47
bassoon
01:51
so when other composers were writing for
01:53
the bassoon were they just making it up
01:54
no the bassoon is a very important thing
01:56
in in all sorts of ways
01:58
darwin used to play the bassoon to worms
02:00
on his billion table to see if they had
02:02
a sense of hearing
02:04
because i know that elgar stopped
02:06
playing the violin because he decided he
02:07
wasn't good enough so maybe he did that
02:09
thing and thinking i'm a bit crap at all
02:10
the mainstream instruments let's go for
02:12
the weirdo
02:12
that no one ever plays was he a
02:14
footballer no he wasn't but he was a big
02:16
fan
02:16
of wolves and he wrote a song called he
02:19
banged the leather
02:20
in 1898 which was actually before he
02:22
became particularly famous he'd written
02:23
a few
02:24
pieces and he wrote it because he went
02:26
to stay with his friend dora penny
02:28
whose father was a rector in
02:29
wolverhampton and he
02:31
the first question he asked her when he
02:32
got off the train was so we're gonna go
02:34
and see a football match
02:35
and after that he they went and he
02:37
cycled 40 miles from his home regularly
02:39
to go and watch wolf's play
02:41
so how did he spread the chant initially
02:44
i'm not there's not much evidence of it
02:46
being some of the time i think it was
02:47
only discovered about 50 years
02:49
after oh okay so it wasn't him being an
02:51
embarrassing dad
02:52
in the crowd just going come on everyone
02:54
i played on the bassoon you guys sing
02:56
along
02:57
that's why bassoons are now banned
02:58
that's like the old school of the
02:59
wizella
03:00
yeah i'm coming with their bassoons
03:05
the thing about chance i really like is
03:07
it must that there was a referee very
03:09
famous referee called graham paul
03:11
oh yeah and he on a show sort of waxed
03:14
on about how depressed he was about the
03:16
fact that his surname rhymed with whole
03:18
because he just knew that like as soon
03:20
as you join the football you've got to
03:21
look at every element of your life and
03:23
just go where can this be turned into oh
03:25
no
03:25
paul hold no no that's why paul anker
03:28
never became a referee i suppose
03:29
yeah exactly but it is it's got an
03:32
amazing history doesn't it so i managed
03:34
to find
03:35
uh there's the who ate all the pies oh
03:37
yeah
03:38
that famous chant uh supposedly it's uh
03:41
it gets traced back to a footballer who
03:43
was a goalie
03:44
called william henry fulk do you know
03:46
william henry faulkner yeah
03:47
fatty fox was he a goalkeeper he was a
03:49
goalkeeper the most extraordinary player
03:51
he was
03:52
six foot four when the average size was
03:55
five foot five
03:56
um he used to bend the crossbar he would
03:59
pull down on it to make the goal
04:01
smaller and he was just a furious guy
04:05
uh one time he would disagree with a
04:07
referee about a call that made them lose
04:09
a match and so he
04:10
nakedly ran through the stadium trying
04:13
to find the referee
04:15
naked yeah he was naked he hid himself
04:16
in a broom cupboard uh this referee
04:18
because he was so petrified and he
04:20
started trying to rip the doors off and
04:21
he was
04:22
fat yeah was that a tactical thing
04:24
because i've always wondered if there
04:25
should be a width restriction on goalies
04:27
because if you were
04:28
fat enough you're just blocking the
04:30
whole goal right i don't think that's
04:31
possible
04:32
i don't think although he did play
04:33
cricket and apparently uh people used to
04:36
joke that there was
04:37
an appeal against the light whenever he
04:38
was bowling
04:41
um a guy called um on twitter called
04:44
at villanesstatto he tweeted me about
04:47
the football podcast and he told me
04:49
about this goalkeeper called lee roose
04:51
and his trick was quite quite clever
04:53
really whenever a corner would go in he
04:55
would
04:56
sit on the crossbar so he was higher
04:58
than everyone else and then he'd launch
05:00
himself from the crossbar to catch the
05:01
ball
05:02
wow that's pretty good yeah it's a great
05:04
trick if it works
05:06
yeah i don't suppose they do it anymore
05:07
so maybe it doesn't work
05:09
you know osama bin laden has his own
05:10
chant really arsenal
05:12
yeah it's osama whoa osama whoa whoa
05:15
he's hiding in kabul he loves the
05:18
arsenal
05:21
arsenal fan he was a huge arsenal fan
05:23
and when he lived in london
05:24
he actually went to a bunch of matches
05:26
bought a jersey which he brought back
05:28
for his son which was a
05:29
i believe ian wright was even right
05:35
now he and he officially got banned by
05:37
um
05:38
by arsenal from ever attending one of
05:40
their matches on their grounds
05:41
post 911 that was that was arsenal's
05:44
official response to the travesties of
05:46
america
05:47
um from 2004 to 2005 england got its
05:50
first chant
05:51
laureate johnny hurst it was a the board
05:54
that decided who he was going to be was
05:56
chaired by andrew motion who was
05:57
obviously the poet laureate at the time
05:59
and he was paid 10 000 pounds for a year
06:01
which is twice as much as the poet
06:02
laureate gets for his post
06:04
um to right chance and you should look
06:06
him up because they are appallingly bad
06:09
i mean and arsenal actually in 2008 i
06:12
think or i don't know in the early 2000s
06:14
arsenal released an official chant book
06:17
and distribute it to its players which
06:19
obviously did not catch on at all well
06:21
like a hymns book
06:22
basically like him like standing up an
06:24
assembly
06:26
at the first commoner we will be singing
06:27
him number 369.
06:29
the referee is a wanker
06:32
okay uh andy have you got anything to
06:34
add on chance yes i have
06:36
uh we were on charles darwin earlier and
06:39
darwin
06:39
shouted at his earthworms in his last
06:42
book which was called
06:43
the catchy title the formation of
06:45
vegetable mold through the action of
06:47
worms with observations on their habits
06:49
he played the bassoon to them it's got a
06:51
brilliant end that book yeah
06:55
so that's darwin i have found
06:58
a i found an article in the guardian
07:00
which says that osama bin laden was not
07:02
a fan
07:03
what uh of arsenal but it's it's i think
07:06
it's
07:07
open to dispute because he was a fan of
07:09
football in his younger days so i i
07:10
reckon that one
07:11
i reckon that one stacks up um someone
07:14
wrote after he was after he was killed
07:16
someone wrote on twitter
07:17
after watching arsenal yesterday it was
07:18
perhaps unwise for bin laden to rush
07:20
into his yard
07:21
shouting out come on the gunners
07:32
okay let's uh move on to fact number two
07:34
and that is my fact
07:36
and that is that eric cantona was raised
07:38
in a cave
07:39
there's a good football chant about him
07:41
is there isn't that
07:42
yeah they did sing ooh cantona didn't
07:45
they a lot and
07:45
man united still uh fans still sing
07:47
about cantona even though he hasn't
07:49
played for them
07:49
yeah he even in the year that he was
07:51
banned for fly kicking a man in the head
07:54
still won the players player of the year
07:58
when you say he's raised in a cave dad
07:59
do you mean a cave or
08:01
and carve a wine cellar
08:04
i'm sure it's a cave he was french he
08:06
was french that's just french
08:08
yeah no it was a it was a lookout post
08:10
uh that was used by
08:12
occupying nazis uh during world war ii
08:14
then got abandoned and his paternal
08:16
grandparents arrived
08:17
uh from sardinia and they occupied the
08:20
cave and they slowly renovated it over
08:21
the years
08:22
funny didn't take up cricket rather than
08:24
football those bats in there
08:28
really got the tone of the lame jokes on
08:30
the podcast
08:32
i'm in there like a rat up a pipe
08:34
[Laughter]
08:35
so just speaking of going up in caves i
08:37
was thinking about people who've uh who
08:39
live in
08:39
bizarre homes um there's a story in the
08:41
news this week about a house in
08:43
wales that's gone up for sale for 425
08:46
grand which has its own private
08:47
train station where you can hail down
08:49
trains isn't that cool you can hail a
08:51
train yeah
08:52
that's not uncommon at my my mom's uh
08:55
local station indoors
08:56
you stick your hand out and the train
08:58
stops do not try this station
09:00
pandolino is going past um eric cantona
09:04
he sits in the pantheon of those amazing
09:06
football characters that you love almost
09:08
as much for their social life as you do
09:10
for their life on the field on the pitch
09:13
um like pele pele is another one that i
09:15
love what did he do there's an amazing
09:17
ad where um
09:18
he was standing in a massive pitch
09:20
looking around going you know
09:22
i've played in some of the greatest
09:23
stadiums of the world i've played
09:25
amongst the greatest roaring fans that
09:27
you could ever want
09:28
and then he goes into the locker rooms
09:30
and he says i've shared these locker
09:31
rooms
09:32
with some of the greatest players who've
09:33
ever walked onto the pitch and we spoke
09:35
about everything our lives
09:37
our families our greatest fears the one
09:40
thing we never spoke about though
09:42
was erectile dysfunction and then it
09:44
turned into an ad and how you need to
09:45
see your doctor
09:46
if you're not getting it up yeah i was
09:48
just like pele where is this come from
09:50
and he became the ultimate advocate of
09:52
um
09:52
erectile dysfunction so that's as
09:55
exciting as your career to me
09:57
um this is somewhat related another
09:59
brazilian footballer garinchae is very
10:01
famous
10:02
from the same era um he lost his
10:04
virginity to a goat
10:05
according to his official biography no
10:08
um
10:09
and really yeah apparently and when was
10:11
on top james that's the thing
10:14
i think uh the goat for the first half
10:16
uh he was his nickname was
10:17
the wren because the way he ran because
10:19
one of his legs was shorter than the
10:20
other
10:21
and um when they won the world cup he
10:23
got a bonus and he hid the money
10:25
underneath his child's bed
10:27
forgot about it and then when he
10:28
remembered uh he found out that his
10:30
child had been wetting the bed for three
10:31
years and it was completely ruined all
10:33
the money oh
10:34
no talking of um nicknames
10:37
do you know who sulfus uh nielsen was
10:41
i do not he was nicknamed kralban or
10:43
bandy legs
10:44
and he's the first man to score 10 goals
10:47
in a national match really yeah because
10:50
his band
10:51
leg made him very difficult to tackle
10:53
because there was a huge
10:54
gap between where his legs should be
10:57
1908 at the olympics
10:58
we were talking earlier about um cantona
11:01
kicking football fans
11:02
yeah he's got nothing on this guy um
11:04
javier flores
11:06
he was a colombian midfielder and he'd
11:09
lost a game
11:09
lost a football match and he was driving
11:11
home and as he was driving there was a
11:13
group
11:14
of fans there and they started shouting
11:16
week
11:17
week week uh and so he shot them oh
11:20
and when he got brought up in front of
11:23
the judge
11:24
um he said that as he drove past it
11:25
wasn't his fault he was drunk
11:27
but i happen to know from having been a
11:28
lawyer in my early youth that
11:30
drunkenness is not a defense to murder
11:32
no especially not when you're driving i
11:33
don't suppose but because crime of
11:35
passion can sometimes be a defense in
11:36
france can't it
11:37
i think i think france is the only
11:38
country where for murder you complete
11:40
crime of passion
11:41
i read somewhere i'm sure this is a
11:42
pocketful andy will tell us but
11:44
it used to be a crime of passion to kill
11:47
somebody for pinching your parking space
11:48
in france
11:51
it's considered such an offensive thing
11:53
to do
11:54
totally let off are footballers by and
11:57
large
11:58
uh underprivileged in terms of their
12:01
upbringing would you say
12:02
you would think that it's a
12:03
working-class sport in this country you
12:05
would think
12:06
and it's fine it didn't start out that
12:07
way did it because in the early days
12:09
they were all
12:10
um there's an amazing guy called lord
12:12
kinnaird who was
12:13
um president of the fa for 33 years
12:17
um extraordinary player he was he played
12:20
in nine
12:20
fa cup finals five times on the winning
12:22
side um three times for wanderers which
12:24
is a mixed public school boys team
12:26
and twice for the older tonians and he
12:30
didn't just play football he won the 350
12:32
yard race at eaton
12:34
in 1864. the international canoe race at
12:37
the 1867 paris exhibition
12:39
two blues for tennis at cambridge and he
12:42
was champion of cambridge
12:44
university in both fives and swimming
12:45
extraordinary games great in those days
12:47
when you could be
12:48
the best at everything yeah wasn't it
12:50
you were like the best soccer player you
12:52
were automatically going to be the best
12:53
long jumper and the best
12:55
you know tennis player and everything
12:56
but speaking of the gentleman sports
12:58
teams at corinthians was a team of
12:59
gentlemen that was
13:01
so gentlemanly that if they got tackled
13:03
in the penalty era they would refuse the
13:05
penalty because they thought there was
13:06
no way that anyone could possibly have
13:08
done it on purpose
13:11
that's right i've got the actual uh
13:12
quote for that here uh yes cbfry wrote
13:15
it is a standing insult to sportsmen to
13:17
have to play under a rule which assumes
13:19
that the player intends to trip hack or
13:21
push their opponents and behave like
13:23
cads of the most unscrupulous kidney
13:28
brilliant cristiano ronaldo thinks the
13:29
same thing it's just outrageous
13:33
um all right andy have you got anything
13:34
to add yes i have uh we were talking
13:36
about cantona earlier way back in
13:38
distant memory
13:39
um and uh just a couple of extra things
13:42
i found about him after he retired from
13:44
the game
13:45
uh he applied to register his name and
13:47
the phrase who
13:48
are cantona as commercial trademarks
13:50
just speaking of um
13:52
trademarking i remember that when david
13:54
hasselhoff got divorced
13:56
part of his divorce settlement was that
13:58
he claimed
13:59
full and total use of the phrase don't
14:02
hassle the hoff
14:03
and that his wife was not allowed in any
14:05
circumstance to use that
14:07
publicly or otherwise that's great we
14:09
were on defenses against crimes earlier
14:11
i have not found any evidence
14:12
that parking spaces are justification
14:16
for murder
14:16
i found someone who in france who did
14:18
kill someone else over a parking space
14:20
but
14:20
i'm not sure it counts as a criminal i
14:22
thought it was yes unlikely i agree
14:24
but crime of fashion has been recently
14:26
reinstated partially as a defense
14:29
uh in in murder cases um in england yeah
14:32
um last year uh on garincha
14:35
the brazilian footballer um so four
14:37
times in his career he scored
14:39
from a corner which is a must be the
14:41
bandy legs coming in handy and in one
14:42
match against fiorentina he beat four
14:44
defenders and the goalkeeper and then he
14:46
stopped
14:46
short of the line to wait for the
14:48
defenders to catch up with him and then
14:49
beat them again
14:50
and scored nice showboating
15:00
okay uh let's move on to fact number
15:02
three that's yours james
15:04
okay my fact is that in the first world
15:06
cup final
15:07
uh in 1930 and the two teams um
15:10
uruguay and argentina couldn't agree on
15:13
the size of bull
15:14
to use and so they used argentina's
15:17
small ball in the first half
15:18
and uruguay's big ball in the second
15:20
half
15:22
and it was such a difference that
15:24
argentina were two one up at half time
15:26
when they were using their small ball
15:28
and in the second half uruguay with the
15:29
big ball went on to win 4-2
15:32
so obviously made quite a big difference
15:34
for the second half so there was no
15:35
official ball
15:37
that was used no they there was no
15:39
official size to the ball at that time
15:41
uh there is now wasn't there a thing
15:43
with with cricket when it started that
15:45
nobody thought to define
15:46
how wide a bat could be really you could
15:49
have an enormously wide bat you know
15:51
that would completely cover the wickets
15:55
that's a brilliant thing and there's an
15:57
interesting thing i found out about um
15:59
there are four
15:59
um olympic sports that have goals in
16:02
them
16:03
um football hockey water polo and hanzo
16:06
hamble yes and there's an interesting
16:07
thing called the penalty factor
16:10
which is um because obviously goals are
16:12
all different sizes and heights and the
16:13
balls are also different sizes so that
16:16
a football goal is twice as wide as a
16:17
hockey goal but the ball three times
16:19
larger
16:20
and the penalty factor is the number
16:22
that takes all these factors into
16:23
account it works out how hard it is
16:25
relatively score a goal in those four
16:27
sports
16:27
oh really and surprisingly they're all
16:30
extraordinarily similar
16:31
really well do you think that's just
16:33
trial and error that they ended up like
16:34
that
16:35
i don't know yeah it sort of feels like
16:38
it doesn't it yeah there's a really
16:39
interesting
16:39
little factoid which is a football goal
16:42
you probably knew this james but
16:44
i would say i knew nothing about
16:45
football before this weekend but the
16:47
role of qr as you all know
16:48
better than anybody is that everything's
16:50
interesting they've looked out long
16:51
enough and it has been
16:52
absolutely fascinating actually all
16:54
these little side lights like
16:56
so a football goal is eight yards wide
16:58
and eight feet high it's a really neat
17:01
little thing because in metric it
17:02
doesn't look like anything interesting
17:04
no you're right and fifa did try and
17:06
there or they did talk about widening
17:08
the goals
17:09
a few years ago because um i think it
17:11
was after the american world cup and
17:13
they were trying to get americans
17:14
interested and thought that well there
17:16
aren't enough goals
17:17
in soccer and so they thought about
17:19
making the goals wider by 50 centimeters
17:22
on each side
17:23
which would have spoiled the 8x8 but
17:25
also um a lot of the goalkeepers went
17:28
well people watch it because it's so
17:30
difficult to score goals i mean if it
17:31
becomes easy if you can kick it into a
17:33
bit where no goalkeeper can get to it
17:35
then it just spoils the game there used
17:37
to be as well the the crossbar
17:39
was not there initially it was just like
17:42
like
17:43
um like rugby just two poles in the air
17:45
and they
17:46
decided eventually to add the crossbar
17:48
because people just kept lobbing it
17:50
way over the height that any human could
17:52
get and would estimate whether or not it
17:54
had in fact gone between
17:56
the two bars yeah the net was actually
17:58
invented by an everton fan who was so
18:00
annoyed because not only was it a trick
18:02
of the eye whether or not the ball had
18:03
gone past the post on the inside or
18:05
outside of the goal
18:06
but fans used to line up right back by
18:08
the goal line
18:09
and so they would just hit it with their
18:11
hand or with their leg so when a goal
18:13
went in it just went
18:14
right back out again and no one knew if
18:16
it actually had made it through
18:17
there was a famous thing that happened
18:18
that a few years ago it must be 10 years
18:20
ago now and i'm going to say it was
18:22
bristol city but it might be wrong
18:24
and what they had they had the net but
18:26
they had the advertising holdings
18:28
too close to the back of the net so
18:29
someone hit a shot it went in
18:31
instead of making the net bulge it hit
18:33
the advertising hoardings came back out
18:35
and
18:35
they didn't give the goal because they
18:36
didn't realize it had gone in oh really
18:38
yeah
18:38
is bristol city any good as a team no
18:41
yeah
18:42
i wondered why because there was a
18:43
famous line in the nine o'clock news and
18:45
mel smith is a news reader reading out
18:48
the headline it says
18:49
lord lucan has been found he's been
18:52
playing center forward for bristol city
18:55
i like it
18:56
sorry to any bristol city fans listening
18:58
though i'm a treme rovers fan they
19:00
always beat us but they are
19:01
not a very good team now i remember i
19:03
went to bristol one time
19:04
and um we were driving down we were
19:06
trying to get to ashton gate which is
19:08
the
19:08
which is the bristol city ground and we
19:11
stopped and we asked a guy um
19:12
excuse me can you tell us where bristol
19:14
city's football ground is
19:16
and he said oh no we don't play football
19:18
around here
19:20
he was the captain of their team maybe
19:23
it's lord lucan
19:25
any other interesting rules james um
19:27
there used to be no lightering
19:29
allowed in football um the rules was
19:32
yeah no lightering near the opponent's
19:34
goal but which basically
19:36
then later became the offside rule i
19:38
really like in the early days of
19:39
football how
19:40
things just went as people decided on
19:42
the spur of the moment so there was a
19:43
match in
19:44
1894 in sunderland versus darby county
19:47
and
19:47
basically the match uh was ready to
19:50
start except that the uh referee hadn't
19:52
arrived because he'd missed his
19:53
connecting train
19:55
and so they decided they decided to go
19:57
for it anyway they brought a guy in who
19:59
knew how to referee as well he came into
20:01
the match and they played 45 minutes and
20:03
there was a three-nil
20:04
lead to sunderland by half time the
20:07
referee arrived
20:08
said what'd you do start the match
20:09
without me no no no made it void
20:12
started the match again they ended up
20:13
playing a three-halved uh
20:16
match do we know what the final score
20:18
was yeah um
20:19
it was five nil uh so sunderland still
20:21
won but really it should have been eight
20:23
nil
20:23
when the goalkeeper who had lost the
20:25
match eight nil was asked
20:26
why they'd lost he didn't blame the big
20:28
defeat on the fact that the referee
20:30
had messed them about by not showing up
20:32
and then cancelling the points and then
20:34
so he blamed it because he said it was a
20:36
failure of his to find any rice pudding
20:38
in sunderland before the match and his
20:41
motto famously was no pudding no points
20:44
that he ate a bowl of rice pudding
20:46
before every match so yeah that was his
20:48
excuse
20:48
football of course evolved from like a
20:50
village sport where
20:52
two villagers would get a pig's bladder
20:54
and they would try and
20:55
get it from one village to the other
20:57
there's a game in uh 1280
20:59
at olgum in northumberland where a
21:01
player was killed as a result of running
21:03
against an opposing player's dagger
21:07
which sounds rather like he's getting
21:09
blamed but yeah
21:11
that's not my fault he ran into my
21:13
dagger looks like that line in chicago
21:15
he ran into my knife he ran into my
21:17
knife ten times
21:19
what also there's it's it's interesting
21:21
to see again how the game evolves and
21:22
how these
21:23
how all the rules come into play like uh
21:25
for example the whistle
21:26
the whistle was quite a late
21:28
introduction into football and what they
21:30
used to do was referees just used to
21:31
wave a hanky
21:33
any time they needed to get the
21:35
attention of the other players and so it
21:36
used to get passed down
21:37
i'm like oh mate uh hanky's hanky's
21:40
being waved um also
21:41
uh folk apparently this guy fatty folk
21:43
who i mentioned earlier
21:44
um supposedly the reason of bull boys
21:47
being
21:48
invented for the sport was a result of
21:50
him because what they used to do was
21:51
behind the goal
21:52
to accentuate his size six foot four
21:54
everyone else roughly five foot five
21:56
they used to place two little boys
21:58
behind the goal
21:59
just to make him look way larger and
22:01
more intimidating
22:02
and then any time the ball went past the
22:04
boys just naturally went and grabbed the
22:06
balls and that supposedly was how
22:08
how ball boys came about right oh wow
22:10
it's a very naturally evolving sport and
22:12
just going back to the first world cup
22:14
with the two bowls um
22:16
the winning goal was scarred by a guy
22:18
called hector castro
22:19
uh which is quite impressive first
22:21
winning goal in the first
22:23
world cup final what's even more
22:24
impressive is he only had one arm
22:27
and um when he was 13 years old he
22:29
accidentally amputated his right
22:31
forearm while using an electric saw and
22:34
his teammates
22:34
nicknamed him elmanco
22:40
andy do you have anything to add yes as
22:42
well as uh variations in the size of the
22:45
ball there were variations in
22:46
early matches between the kind of
22:48
football code that you would use
22:50
so there were the sheffield rules and
22:51
the nottingham rules and
22:53
some some matches took different
22:56
sets of rules even for the first and
22:58
second half of the game and in the early
23:00
days as well they turned up with
23:01
different numbers of players so teams
23:03
were between nine and 18 players
23:08
uh john elliot you mentioned the massive
23:11
cricket bat that someone used
23:12
this is officially known as the monster
23:15
bat incident
23:16
of 1771. um
23:20
so it was just one guy who came up with
23:22
a massive bat and
23:23
the whole wicked yeah basically but they
23:26
suddenly produced some eight-foot stumps
23:28
that they nailed in behind him
23:33
um and a huge like indiana jones ball
23:36
yes
23:37
coming down made of stone
23:46
okay time for our final fact of the show
23:48
and that is you mr john lloyd
23:50
okay my fact is that fifa the federation
23:55
international football association
23:58
has more members than the un
24:02
right which i think is uh surprisingly
24:04
counterintuitive quite a lot more
24:06
members actually it's got
24:07
17 more members than the the un
24:10
uh most of these uh members are tiny
24:13
little colonies like
24:14
um american samoa anguilla aruba bermuda
24:17
british virgin islands came around cook
24:19
islands curacao
24:20
pharaoh islands guam hong kong is a
24:23
member of fifa
24:24
macau montserrat new caledonia palestine
24:27
as a member of fifa but not of the un
24:30
and of course scotland northern ireland
24:32
england and wales
24:34
and the upshot of this is that it is the
24:36
reason
24:37
ultimately why britain doesn't have a
24:39
football team in the olympics
24:41
probably the only national side as far
24:43
as i know
24:44
the only country in the world that never
24:46
enters the last three olympics a british
24:49
football team was in 64 68 in 1972 they
24:52
didn't even qualify
24:53
they didn't even get in three years
24:54
before that they knocked out in the
24:56
first round so this thing of britain not
24:57
being very good at football is actually
24:58
really old it goes right back to
25:00
gets right back to the 1920s and um
25:04
in 2012 the host country doesn't have to
25:06
qualify
25:07
so you just have a team by right yeah so
25:10
initially the scots the northern irish
25:12
and the welsh all refused to take pla
25:14
part as official
25:15
fas i don't know if that would change
25:17
later i think it did change i think we
25:19
did
25:19
get a team in the end and fail miserably
25:21
like we do in every tournament
25:22
and it was controversial and they're not
25:23
going to do it again i think yeah so the
25:25
uk isn't a part of
25:27
fifa yeah wow the good thing about um
25:30
not being part of fifa is that you're
25:31
not
25:32
bound by their rules so there's a story
25:34
you know how luis suarez has been banned
25:36
from all football for biting
25:37
yes some guy um well there's a story
25:40
that he might be able to go and
25:41
train in kosovo because they're not
25:43
members of fifa
25:44
really which was a nice little loophole
25:46
for him yeah
25:47
i like as well that there's a there's
25:49
one of the teams that isn't a part of
25:51
fifa
25:51
is um yeah um
25:54
whereas most of the other teams have a
25:56
sort of quite legit reason like the uk
25:58
for not joining their one is actually
26:00
just a slight admin error um they've
26:02
been
26:02
inactive since 1998 uh because their
26:05
membership expired
26:07
um but they've confirmed an intention to
26:09
apply for membership again
26:10
so they are going to join eventually
26:12
yeah well so they just failed to fill in
26:14
the form
26:14
yeah so who who was in charge of filling
26:16
the forms
26:17
it was 28 pages yeah come on uh so the
26:20
netherlands are now through to the
26:21
semi-finals in the world cup and
26:24
they might be through to the finals by
26:25
the time they might be through the
26:26
finals um
26:27
they only booked their hotel in brazil
26:29
up till the 7th of july and fifa have
26:31
organised for
26:32
all of its sponsors and visiting
26:33
dignitaries that were going to come just
26:34
for the semi-finals and finals to move
26:36
in
26:36
so they've had to kick out the dutch
26:38
team so that's today that when we're
26:40
recording this podcast they've just been
26:41
kicked out so i'm not sure where they're
26:42
going to stay
26:43
well they could probably have the
26:44
english camp there you go
26:47
i think that struck me forcibly looking
26:49
at the olympic history
26:51
is that on average today one football
26:54
match in four
26:55
anywhere in the world is a draw because
26:57
if you look at the early scores
26:58
in the uh 1908 olympics um
27:01
which is won by britain two nil against
27:04
denmark in the final
27:06
and the danish team included pure
27:08
mathematician harold bohr who's brother
27:10
brother of the physicist nielsen who's
27:12
as you know
27:13
you probably know an accomplished
27:14
goalkeeper himself and harold boar
27:17
scored twice in denmark's opening game
27:19
and in the quarterfinals
27:20
britain beat sweden 12-1 and denmark
27:23
beat
27:24
france b team 9-1 in the semis
27:27
denmark beat france 17-1 i think in the
27:30
first world cup both semi-finals were
27:32
like seven one or eight one or something
27:34
like that
27:34
uh but just going back to niels bar um
27:36
being a goalkeeper he's once said that
27:38
he
27:39
let in an outrageously long shot due to
27:41
being distracted by a mathematical
27:43
problem
27:44
[Laughter]
27:47
there's another nice thing in the 1920
27:49
olympics and antwerp
27:50
in the final between belgium and czech
27:52
slovakia for the only time in football
27:54
history the competition couldn't be
27:55
completed
27:57
because the czechs walked off the pitch
27:59
complaining of bias by the officials for
28:01
all english
28:02
for sending one of their players off and
28:04
intimidation by belgian soldiers in the
28:06
in the crowd so that they they just
28:07
walked off and that was the end of it
28:09
um you mentioned the fa they were
28:12
responsible for banning
28:13
women's football for 50 years which
28:15
isn't unusual and was banned in a lot of
28:17
countries
28:18
but um the women's football around uh
28:20
just post the first world war and up
28:21
until 1921 when it was banned was more
28:23
popular than men's football
28:24
and women's matches would draw bigger
28:26
crowds the biggest ladies team was the
28:28
ladies team from preston called
28:30
dick curse um but their match was played
28:33
in 1920 at goodison park and liverpool
28:36
and it drew a crowd of 53 000 people
28:38
with another
28:39
another 10 to 15 000 reportedly turned
28:41
away
28:42
um and the justification for the fa
28:46
banning women from playing on any
28:47
fa approved grounds which was
28:49
effectively the same was that women were
28:51
too frail to play football and they'd be
28:53
too easily injured
28:54
and um it was basically seemed to be
28:56
that it was drawing attention and crowds
28:57
away from men's football
28:59
it was always the most popular in
29:01
america for the last 20 years women's
29:03
football's been much more popular than
29:04
men's football hasn't it especially in
29:05
schools
29:06
i have a match of a ladies match from
29:09
may 1881
29:11
and it was an england versus scotland
29:13
match
29:14
done played in scotland and this is the
29:16
review of it
29:17
from bell's life newspaper so it has
29:20
come at last
29:21
what next the event that has had the
29:24
paper so agitated was
29:26
a woman's football match several years
29:28
ago there was a rage for silly displays
29:29
of certain kinds of athletics by women
29:31
but we thought the time had passed
29:33
to give the arrangement any semblance of
29:35
an international events
29:37
the girls had the cheek to designate the
29:39
farce england
29:40
versus scotland so not a good review for
29:43
the opening
29:45
international not great analysis of the
29:47
football played
29:48
no oscar wilde said football is all very
29:51
well as a game for rough girls
29:53
but it is hardly suitable for delicate
29:55
boys
29:57
that's good i read about the uh the
29:58
female the north korean female
30:01
uh football team oh yeah which has a
30:03
fantastic history and that's another
30:05
thing i love that north korea is a part
30:07
of fifa while they're in what happens
30:09
yeah yeah they're in the last world cup
30:10
i think it is a in that way a force for
30:12
good is that yeah
30:13
for a moment uh as it were violent
30:16
nationalities forgotten in favor of
30:18
friendly competition
30:19
exactly i mean there were there was
30:20
conditions apparently in north korea
30:22
whereby you could only watch a match if
30:24
they'd already watched it and saw that
30:26
north korea had won so which meant they
30:27
didn't watch any matches
30:28
i don't know if i've said this before i
30:30
might have done in the last world cup
30:32
they'd played i think brazil in the
30:34
first game and
30:35
they'd lost like three two or four two
30:36
but it'd been a really good game
30:38
and everyone thought wow this north
30:40
korea team is actually quite good
30:42
they've got a good chance and so
30:44
they didn't show the first game in north
30:45
korea but they showed the highlights
30:47
afterwards
30:47
and they thought well actually we're
30:49
doing pretty well so we will show the
30:50
next game live and they played portugal
30:52
and they lost
30:53
seven one or seven nil or something like
30:56
that they got absolutely
30:57
battered they they um also in 2011 in
30:59
the
31:00
world cup in germany um north korea lost
31:02
two nil to america
31:04
and their coach said that the team
31:05
played such a bad way on that match
31:08
because a few days ago five of their
31:09
players were struck by lightning
31:12
i was unfortunate for them and also the
31:14
coach claimed that he was being coached
31:17
by kim jong-il via an invisible mobile
31:21
phone that the theory leader had
31:22
invented himself
31:23
so he was getting coaching tips from
31:24
that um the team then eventually got
31:26
busted for having steroids
31:28
um for using steroids uh the reason they
31:30
were using the steroids supposedly was
31:32
to help them recover from the lightning
31:34
strike
31:36
but they also this is really nice in
31:38
1999 at the women's world cup which was
31:41
held in america the north korean players
31:42
arrived but
31:43
fifa got really concerned about one of
31:45
the players dental care
31:46
because it just they hadn't had proper
31:48
dental care their teeth were looking
31:49
really bad so they gave her free
31:51
treatment
31:51
it was paid by fifa free treatment um
31:54
and then all the other players on the
31:56
team faked sort of phantom teeth
31:58
this is so they could all get their
32:00
teeth done as well so they didn't win
32:01
any matches but they all went back to
32:03
north korea with fantastic teeth
32:05
they were like why are they smiling so
32:06
much they've lost all their games
32:10
uh does anyone have anything to throw in
32:11
before we go to andy i do
32:13
yeah i want to tell you this fantastic
32:14
story about uh the island of grenada
32:17
against barbados in the shell caribbean
32:19
cup of 1994. do you know this story no
32:21
no
32:21
no it sounds great it's one of the
32:23
weirdest football matches you've ever
32:24
heard of so
32:25
it was the last of the group stage okay
32:27
so barbados
32:28
had to beat grenada by two goals to go
32:30
through to the next round
32:31
on goal difference and if they failed
32:33
then grenada would go through
32:35
so at that time the organizers
32:37
introduced a new rule for golden goals
32:39
okay and they said a golden goal if it's
32:42
scored will count for two goals
32:44
because the golden goal by definition
32:46
ends the match is not fair on people who
32:48
win matches by golden girls yeah so
32:50
golden gold counted for two okay
32:52
so barbados took an early two-nil lead
32:54
and they were doing really well they
32:55
held that all the way through the first
32:57
half
32:57
they were playing great in the second
32:59
half and looked like they were going to
33:00
coast through
33:00
that two-nil lead into the knockout
33:02
stages when
33:03
grenada suddenly scored and made it 2-1
33:06
and it was seven minutes from the end of
33:07
the match
33:08
so the barbations the beijing said right
33:11
the chance of scoring a third goal
33:13
in seven minutes are very small so they
33:15
turned round and shot into their own
33:16
goal
33:17
making it a draw which meant as it was a
33:20
draw
33:21
when the match was over it would have to
33:22
go to extra time yeah and they had a
33:24
chance of a two-nil lead with the new
33:26
golden goal rule right
33:28
that's brilliant yeah so then yeah
33:30
they've turned around scoring all girls
33:31
says two to all
33:32
and it's three minutes to go so grenada
33:34
now has to be really intelligent and
33:36
they think
33:37
right it doesn't matter which end we
33:39
score at
33:41
as long as it's not a draw yeah it will
33:44
be only a one goal difference and we'll
33:45
go through so first of all they rush up
33:47
to the barbarian
33:48
now wait a minute let's go the other way
33:51
go back to their own goal meanwhile the
33:53
beijing team realized we've got to
33:55
defend the grenadine goal
33:57
so the whole team go round and like a
34:00
penalty wall block the grenade and go
34:02
which they successfully do full time is
34:04
called at uh at two all and they go to
34:07
extra time and barbados
34:08
wins the golden goal in five minutes oh
34:10
wow that's brilliant
34:12
brilliant um okay andy any uh final
34:16
facts that are in here
34:17
uh well you got everything just about
34:19
correct there i think i couldn't find
34:20
any mistakes
34:21
uh there's a cup rather nicely called
34:23
the elf cup oh
34:24
yeah which um which took place in 2006
34:27
between crimea greenland kyrgyzstan
34:29
tajikistan tibet northern cyprus and
34:31
zanzibar
34:32
i bet no the cyprus won that because
34:34
they're like a really good team aren't
34:35
they
34:35
they hosted it and they won it yeah
34:38
um and one of the early women's football
34:41
teams was called the honey ballers
34:43
which is just rather nice and their team
34:45
captain was a lady called mary hudson
34:47
but she played under a pseudonym
34:48
because of the ban um and the fa have
34:51
since
34:51
apologized for the ban i do know that
34:54
amusingly in germany when they allowed
34:55
women to play football then they would
34:57
only they were only allowed to play in
34:58
warm weather
35:01

00:11

[Applause]
00:22
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:24
no such thing as a fish it's a weekly
00:26
podcast coming to you from the qi
00:28
offices in covent garden
00:30
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
00:31
here with james harkin anna czecinski
00:33
and we have a special guest today he's a
00:35
very close friend of ours he's the
00:36
co-creator and producer of museum of
00:39
curiosity
00:40
and has a lot of claims to fame that we
00:43
probably should mention
00:44
tell you what rich give us one of your
00:45
claims yeah okay
00:47
uh i coined the term international man
00:51
of mystery
00:53
for the austin power movies uh you knew
00:55
one of the actors in it right uh uh
00:58
yeah um i knew neil malarkey who was
01:00
working very closely with mike myers
01:02
yeah those two used to be a double act
01:04
didn't they yeah they were a double act
01:05
that's right
01:05
and uh i i used it as a program now
01:09
it in fact does come from a back page
01:11
advert in the stage
01:13
and uh it was for a guy who was the
01:15
international man of mystery i can't
01:16
remember his name
01:17
um and uh neil just took it and gave it
01:20
to
01:21
mike myers i just thought it was a
01:22
coincidence but then neil confirmed it
01:24
to me that he passed that on and that
01:26
became
01:26
the thing in the movie yeah and you're
01:30
also just
01:31
not quite in charge of fire right uh
01:33
half of me is interested
01:34
[Laughter]
01:38
yeah there's a scene where um there's a
01:40
choir singing
01:41
uh to be an englishman on a stage and
01:44
i got moved actually i was near the
01:46
middle you were just leaving
01:48
it yeah and he got moved near and near
01:49
the center he's very tall i think that
01:51
was to make a nice sort of
01:52
like inverted v shape yeah kind of
01:55
pyramid shape of
01:56
of heads but i got moved right i must be
01:58
just ugly also
01:59
i got moved right to the edge and if you
02:01
if you watch on a proper
02:02
i mean if you watch on an ordinary old
02:04
telly you won't see me at all but
02:05
widescreen
02:06
yeah white screen
02:07
[Laughter]
02:12
you tell me i think most people think
02:14
their left-hand side is their better
02:15
half
02:16
do they yeah it's probably my evil side
02:18
yeah i didn't know you had one that is
02:20
like if you cut nixon's face in half um
02:23
and
02:24
uh uh you make a kind of mirror image of
02:26
of one side you get evil nixon
02:28
british or both sides of nixon were
02:30
either well yeah but evil people
02:32
have more asymmetric faces apparently
02:35
okay yeah i'm sure that's a qi factor oh
02:37
no people are gonna be freaking out at
02:39
home now looking at their wonky faces in
02:41
the mirror
02:41
so it's really weird you can see a nice
02:43
happy smiling face if you do one side
02:45
and then a really scowling evil
02:47
sinister so that's a very long
02:48
convoluted way of saying our special
02:50
guest is rich turner yeah that's the
02:51
rich turner podcast there we go
02:53
okay so uh so we've gathered around the
02:56
microphone once again
02:57
and we brought with us our favorite four
02:59
facts from the last seven days so here
03:00
we go in no particular order these are
03:02
our favorite things
03:07
rich we're gonna start with you fact
03:09
number one okay when neil armstrong
03:11
stepped on the moon and said that's one
03:13
small step for a man
03:15
or for man uh he was wearing ladies
03:18
underwear
03:20
that's really did you get that fact from
03:23
buzz aldrin when we met him last year
03:26
yeah he's just like slapping him down
03:28
they were both wearing ladies underwear
03:29
as a matter of fact
03:30
so um when apollo needed to get their
03:33
spacesuits made
03:34
they uh ended up asking playtex
03:37
the bra manufacturers to to make the
03:40
spaces so they actually got the women
03:42
from the production lines
03:43
at their factory and they made the
03:45
spaces they made i think it's 21 layers
03:48
all made by them um so effectively all
03:50
of the same technology all the same
03:52
skills
03:53
uh all the same stuff as we're making
03:55
bras and girdles
03:57
um and that's what they were and you
03:58
know look at those pictures again and
04:00
think of that
04:01
as a great big playtex bra that they're
04:03
wearing and it makes sense it's actually
04:05
you look at the stitching it's it's you
04:06
know the stitching
04:08
the clasp they were trying to take it
04:09
off and they couldn't quite fumble
04:11
around
04:11
spells could do it one-handed he always
04:13
bragged about that
04:15
why did they choose a latex why did they
04:17
choose that company to make the suit
04:19
playtex i think it's because they had
04:20
the skills with the stitching actually
04:22
they were the only people that knew how
04:24
to make
04:24
that i mean something like three rows of
04:27
stitches in a row
04:28
tiny tiny stitches great deal of
04:30
precision required and
04:32
and they won the contract because they
04:33
were the best at doing it were they made
04:35
out of latex
04:36
uh parts of the spacesuit were made of
04:39
leather yeah i think they were
04:40
yeah were they frilly
04:44
i understand that the spacesuits now are
04:47
they haven't been washed they're still
04:48
covered in moon dust um
04:50
yeah so they're sitting in the back
04:52
rooms of a museum somewhere
04:53
yeah and i've read that um when
04:56
ex-apollo astronauts
04:58
like to go to a museum to revisit the
05:00
whole experience of going to space they
05:01
don't go to the smithsonian to look at
05:03
the rockets and the
05:04
on the capsules they go to the space
05:06
suit museum or
05:09
yeah wherever it spacesuit in the um in
05:11
the science museum isn't there in
05:13
in london i've seen that i've seen it um
05:15
it's quite cool because it has
05:17
like where you would think of the um
05:20
what do you call it the arm seam yeah so
05:23
where'd the seams are
05:24
you think it's the seams actually it's
05:26
little pipes where they
05:28
used to put water up there to keep
05:29
people warm or cool oh yeah that was one
05:31
of one of the undergarment layers yeah
05:32
and
05:33
actually that was a british invention
05:34
was it yeah that was invented for
05:36
um british uh fighter jet pilots
05:40
um to keep them warm uh and i think it
05:43
was one of the proudest moments i think
05:44
patrick moore flagged it up on the day
05:46
of the moon landing to remind
05:47
people that there was something british
05:49
that was something british on the moon
05:51
there's no there's not many british
05:52
things on the moon are there we we were
05:54
talking the other there you and i about
05:55
patrick moore
05:56
and you were convinced that he had a
05:58
crater on the moon yeah but he doesn't
06:00
it was a different place
06:01
well he i mean the one that rich thought
06:04
that was patrick moore's turned out to
06:05
be
06:06
another one another more roger moore
06:08
yeah
06:09
from moonraker moonraker is that just a
06:13
film with roger moore raking out
06:15
being crazy on the moon where does
06:17
moonraken the name come from because
06:18
there is they call
06:20
there's a town in wiltshire or somewhere
06:22
where they call them moonrakers because
06:23
supposedly
06:24
they were so stupid they saw a moon
06:26
inside the lake and they tried to get it
06:28
out
06:29
but i don't know where that comes from
06:30
james bond wow it's a weird thing to
06:33
put a bond movie about isn't it
06:36
based in wiltshire well
06:39
uh neil armstrong's boots are supposed
06:40
to be around this space and where are
06:42
they floating around are they i thought
06:44
they're in a museum wow
06:44
i think the well the the uh what's it
06:48
called the silicon rubber
06:49
right um they're called overshoes
06:51
they're like galoshes
06:52
that they had on on the spacesuit they
06:54
actually i think threw them off i think
06:55
they're on the moon
06:57
among the many things that they chucked
06:59
onto the moon and left there there's the
07:01
lovely hasselblad cameras are all up
07:02
there
07:03
except one i think one came back home
07:04
and that was auctioned recently for
07:06
quite a lot of money i can't remember
07:07
how much yeah i can imagine yeah it's so
07:09
countless how tolerant we are of
07:10
littering on the moon that i can't
07:12
remember how many billions of tons it is
07:13
but there's like
07:15
some billion tons of litter in space and
07:17
then a lot of people have left
07:19
litter on the moon and it's basically
07:21
fine yeah well there's a strict laws now
07:23
about uh
07:24
about space junk because we're it's
07:26
getting to the point now i mean the
07:28
movie that's the whole point of the
07:29
movie gravity
07:30
was that they were pointing out that
07:31
we'll reach this point where we can't
07:33
actually
07:33
leave our planet because of these
07:35
spinning bits of debris that are just
07:37
hurtling around the planet six times the
07:39
speed of a bullet
07:40
so it's it's it's been been a big
07:42
concern on top of it on the moon they've
07:44
actually
07:44
turned or they're trying to turn certain
07:47
areas of the moon into sort of like
07:48
national parks as it were
07:50
so that no one could because the chinese
07:52
are now going there
07:53
india have got plans to go there and
07:55
they want all these heritage spots
07:57
like the apollo 11 moon landing spot to
07:59
be yeah
08:00
to be preserved isn't that typically
08:02
american you go and trash a place and
08:04
the bits that you've trashed you declare
08:05
to be
08:06
preserved to be preserved as a national
08:08
park yeah
08:10
forget the rest well the thing is i
08:11
reckon if they call it a national park
08:14
then technically it's going to be an
08:15
american national park so that means
08:16
part of the moon would be american
08:18
yes yeah you're not allowed to claim
08:20
parts of the moon are you not allowed to
08:21
but that's a technicality
08:22
there is there is a scam and i come on
08:25
what it's called
08:26
in fact there are a whole bunch of scams
08:27
that allow you to buy land on the moon
08:28
and they look surprisingly
08:30
plausible but definitely not a thing if
08:32
anyone's bought land on the moon you do
08:34
not own land on the moon no but there is
08:35
something on the moon that does belong
08:37
to
08:37
an individual millionaire on earth and
08:39
that's the lunar rover that was sent up
08:41
by the russians it landed at the same
08:43
time that neil armstrong and buzz aldrin
08:44
were on there and it was a remote rover
08:46
that would picked up some rocks
08:48
um and the russians left it there and
08:50
they're a bit short of money for their
08:52
space program so they auctioned it off
08:54
someone liked it oh really right so that
08:57
landed
08:58
within the same time frame yeah
09:00
literally in the same on the same day
09:03
it was moving on the surface of the moon
09:05
when they were moving around that's
09:06
fantastic i've never heard that
09:08
anyway on underwear yes let's go back to
09:11
underwear
09:12
underwear guys um you can buy uh
09:15
flatulence filtering underwear now oh
09:17
yeah it's handy it's called shreddies it
09:19
doesn't do that anyway
09:21
for years i'm so sorry everyone
09:24
um but yeah isn't that good you can buy
09:26
it for like 35 and they're called
09:28
shreddies
09:28
and they're made of a special kind of
09:31
carbon which apparently absorbs the
09:33
smell yeah it'll be like um
09:35
like graphite kind of stuff they
09:36
actually call it zorflex but i think
09:38
that might be a made-up word
09:39
it'd be a bit like charcoal which would
09:41
normally stop normal smells
09:43
so if you can't afford a play you could
09:44
just put some charcoal in your pants
09:46
yes there was the british troops in
09:49
world war ii some british troops had a
09:51
secret plan to go into battle in women's
09:53
underwear
09:54
this was a scottish um group they were
09:58
kilt wearing soldiers
09:59
and they were worried that their legs
10:01
were being exposed to poisonous gas and
10:04
obviously
10:04
other parts underneath the kilts that
10:06
they wouldn't normally cover would be um
10:08
would be um hit by the poison gas and so
10:11
they test they did tests to see
10:14
if it would work if they were long
10:15
stockings and woolen bloomers
10:17
and the tests show that it would work
10:19
but it was decided that the protective
10:20
clothing would be too costly to supply
10:22
all scott's regiments and so they just
10:24
banned kilts from the
10:25
battlegrounds that's tragic yeah yeah
10:28
so when did they ban kills uh 1940.
10:32
really yeah oh that is a shame what they
10:34
don't march into battle
10:35
in a kilt anymore not on the
10:36
battleground they could march in it but
10:38
they wouldn't
10:39
fight in it no so it's just for dressing
10:40
up at weekends now
10:43
and james joyce always used to keep a
10:45
pair of dolls knickers in his pocket
10:47
but apparently he always kept them there
10:49
and then when he got really drunk
10:50
sometimes he would take them out
10:52
put them on his fingers and then do like
10:54
a little dance on the table with his
10:56
fingers i'm doing the dance for people
10:58
at home
10:59
that does actually sound entertaining
11:00
yeah so it's a party trick that's much
11:02
better than his books
11:05
it's a bit easier to understand the
11:06
newest scenes yeah have you ever has
11:08
anyone read your season i started
11:09
reading it
11:10
i started reading it as well it's
11:12
completely unreadable isn't it
11:14
it's pretty dense it was so it's so
11:15
unreadable that when it first came out
11:17
it got banned in britain because they
11:18
thought it was written in code
11:20
[Laughter]
11:22
that's true that's true patel was
11:24
original the reason it was allowed to be
11:25
published i only found this out
11:26
yesterday
11:27
uh they knew that it was like
11:29
revolutionary dangerous stuff
11:31
but it was deemed uh by the publishing
11:33
powers that be
11:34
that it was totally dense and unreadable
11:36
and no one would ever make it through it
11:37
and it would have a really conceivable
11:38
impact
11:39
yeah idiots
11:46
okay uh it's time to move on to fact
11:49
number two and that is my fact my fact
11:52
is that in 1963 muhammad ali released a
11:55
stand-up comedy album
11:58
wow yeah that's good and it's cool
12:01
it's called i am the greatest i didn't
12:03
know he intended it to be comedy so was
12:05
it
12:06
it was meant to be funny because it was
12:08
kind of marketed as like a cabaret
12:10
sort of thing yeah it says this is this
12:12
is the blurb on the back it says yep
12:13
it's no empty boast as the greatest
12:15
sportsman of the last
12:16
this or any century does his thang in a
12:19
hilarious amazing collection of stand-up
12:21
poetry and rapping
12:22
just prior to entering the history books
12:24
by becoming the greatest
12:26
ever catalogues heavyweight champ of all
12:29
time
12:30
so that's that's the kind of yeah
12:31
stand-ups in there and the reason i know
12:33
about this is was i was in hmv walking
12:35
around looking at the audio
12:36
comedy section and you know peter cook
12:39
jerry seinfeld muhammad ali
12:42
what is this doing here it's interesting
12:44
though because this was when he was a
12:46
rising
12:47
boxing superstar it was at the time when
12:49
he was doing quite well he wasn't yet
12:50
world champion
12:52
and also the year 1963 it's a really
12:54
interesting years the year that
12:55
bill cosby released his first album was
12:58
kind of the period where stand-up comedy
13:00
was really being
13:01
turned into something so you could argue
13:03
that the album that he released
13:05
muhammad ali was a spoken word album but
13:08
i think it's only called the spoken word
13:09
album because of the context of the time
13:12
that it was released in but it was a guy
13:13
on stage
13:14
telling jokes reading funny poems to an
13:17
audience who were laughing along to it
13:18
he was basically like the
13:20
predecessor of tim key i don't maybe he
13:22
was serious though he was a famously not
13:24
a humble man
13:25
i think he had the impression in his
13:26
head that he was the greatest because he
13:28
did some extraordinary things
13:30
like there's a there's a clip on youtube
13:31
that you can see of
13:33
when a guy is standing on the edge of a
13:35
building ready to commit suicide
13:37
he's just lost it and the police are
13:39
there and everything they're filming
13:40
it's just a news crew filming it and
13:42
suddenly
13:42
someone just goes and then muhammad ali
13:44
arrived and he comes
13:45
running to the building with his
13:47
entourage he gets up he's in the other
13:49
window and he talks the man down
13:51
wow yeah it's an amazing shot it's also
13:53
interesting the way that um because
13:55
it's just on that idea of that sort of
13:57
that idea that he could just run up to a
13:59
building and talk someone down and they
14:00
would just allow him
14:02
oh muhammad ali's here yeah let him chat
14:04
to the guy step back
14:05
yeah exactly that's a lot better than
14:07
when paul gascoigne turns up with a
14:09
fishing rod and some chicken isn't it
14:10
yeah i'm actually
14:12
trying to think of any sports person
14:14
alive today who could do anything um
14:16
actually there was uh some of the
14:18
england cricket team talked a guy
14:19
off a bridge in australia in australia
14:22
last year yeah yeah
14:23
stewart broad was it stewart broad and i
14:26
can't remember who else that prayer i
14:27
think yes
14:29
you know the famous rumble in the jungle
14:31
match yes
14:32
george it was in an african country
14:35
in zaire yeah it was in kinshasa yes uh
14:38
this is this is not an amazing fact i
14:40
just didn't know it um
14:41
because of the time difference that
14:43
match was fought at 4 a.m in the morning
14:45
yeah so everyone in the country who came
14:48
to watch it because it was such a big
14:50
event
14:51
uh they were all there at 4 am muhammad
14:53
ali was up at 4 00 a.m
14:54
some of those times where you don't know
14:55
whether it's best to stay up for it or
14:57
get up early
14:58
yeah and then you accidentally fall
15:01
asleep at 3 30 and you invest the whole
15:02
thing yeah
15:03
um i think the gun the government paid a
15:05
huge amount it was it was insane
15:06
yes it was yeah yeah i think there's the
15:08
zaya government a huge amount of money
15:09
to have it there didn't it because uh it
15:11
was gonna help
15:12
uh tourism and help draw attention to it
15:14
yeah it's big tourist hot spot now
15:16
democratic republic
15:18
isn't it work like a charm
15:21
okay so uh just speaking just going into
15:23
boxing okay
15:24
rather than muhammad ali the first
15:27
rules of boxing the first codified rules
15:29
were the queensberry rules
15:30
and they had an explicit rule for
15:32
bidding boots with having springs
15:36
which is quite good so before that
15:37
you're allowed boots with springs
15:39
presumably someone must have gone to a
15:41
boxing
15:41
match with springs on his boots and they
15:44
had to ban it
15:44
yeah that sounds like it would just be
15:46
really quite cumbersome and not very
15:47
helpful i know you could bounce over
15:49
them and then hit them on the back
15:50
that's true seriously good spring i
15:52
think you should get springs on your
15:53
back
15:54
so when you're knocked down just come
15:55
right back up again that would be great
15:56
like one of those toys you get
15:58
another rule um about boxing in the 18th
16:00
century most boxers had long hair
16:02
um but they stopped that after referees
16:05
made it legal to hold your opponent's
16:06
hair with one hand and hit
16:08
him with the other
16:13
um okay we're going to have to wrap up
16:14
on this one is anyone else he was also a
16:16
magician wasn't he
16:17
yeah yeah muhammad ali could could do
16:19
magic tricks he was a magician as well
16:21
really yeah what kind of imagination he
16:22
is
16:23
well i i don't know he's his son uh
16:25
muhammad ali jr who's a very
16:27
um poor man now because uh he's been
16:30
sort of cut off by
16:31
muhammad ali's third wife um
16:34
yeah no he remembered that his dad used
16:36
to do magic tricks in the ring when he
16:38
was uh
16:39
when he was in training yeah he used to
16:41
um he used to make
16:42
um uh handkerchiefs disappear and he
16:44
used to do like a
16:45
levitation trick where you stand on the
16:47
tiptoes of one toe and it makes it look
16:49
like you're levitating
16:51
but because um he because of his islamic
16:53
beliefs
16:54
um he wasn't allowed to deceive anyone
16:57
so he would always explain exactly how
16:58
his tricks were done as soon as he'd
17:00
done them
17:01
and was thrown out of the magic circle
17:02
pretty swiftly
17:04
i would like to be the bouncer to throw
17:06
him out the magic circle
17:08
i got one last fact for muhammad ali do
17:10
we
17:11
all know what he changed his name from
17:12
cassie's clay to muhammad
17:15
i know what you're going to think yeah
17:17
yeah is it cassius x yeah cassius x and
17:20
he did it because he was with um
17:21
malcolm x at the time hanging out with
17:23
him so there was there was the x-men
17:26
how long did you keep that name for long
17:27
though no he didn't i think he only had
17:29
it because while he was waiting to get
17:31
ver a verified name from the nation of
17:32
islam didn't he when he decided to shake
17:34
cassius clay because that was his slave
17:35
name
17:36
but the nation of islam elijah muhammad
17:38
had to give him a proper name and so he
17:39
took cassius x in the interim
17:41
i think that's that's it yeah it is yeah
17:44
might use that next year cool you heard
17:46
it here first guys yeah
17:50
all right okay time for fact number
17:52
three and that
17:53
is chozinski yep my fact is that in 1325
17:58
in
17:58
italy war was declared and 2 000 people
18:01
were killed because of a stolen bucket
18:04
okay the war of the open bucket
18:07
bucket uh so it was there were two rival
18:09
city states bologna and modena at the
18:11
time
18:12
and mo denise soldiers stole the bucket
18:16
the bolognese bolognese bucket from
18:18
their city well and it had some loot in
18:20
it apparently that i guess they'd
18:21
acquired in other kind of
18:23
battles and they stole the bucket and so
18:25
bologna declared war on them
18:27
and brought a 32 000
18:30
strong army to invade and reclaim the
18:33
bucket
18:35
you could say that the crusades i mean
18:37
it all depends on how you translate
18:39
words for sort of a vessel that holds
18:41
things but you could say that the
18:42
crusades
18:43
were all fought over a bucket couldn't
18:45
you go on the holy bucket the holy grail
18:47
okay yeah good yeah i mean these are
18:50
ancient languages it might be just a
18:51
bucket
18:52
i like walls that have started over uh
18:54
really apparently minor and comical
18:57
such as such as the war of jenkins ear
19:00
that's quite a famous one isn't it
19:02
yeah what was that uh so jenkins was a
19:06
british privateer in 1738 and he
19:10
went out to the americas and his ear was
19:12
cut off by
19:13
spence the spanish who were also in the
19:15
americas privateering
19:17
themselves and so he came back to
19:18
britain and he brandished his ear in
19:20
parliament i was like look what those
19:21
spanish guys have done to me
19:23
and uh so they went to war
19:26
oh i think yeah what to get the year
19:28
back or
19:29
oh no he had the ear just because they
19:31
were so irritated that the spaniard's
19:33
dead
19:33
cut off the air it kind of makes you
19:35
wonder about the butterfly effect really
19:36
that
19:37
maybe every war in the world was started
19:39
by something incredibly tiny
19:41
yeah just we don't know what it was
19:43
always yeah just two people just
19:45
going you're a dick yeah yeah did you
19:48
say who won the war
19:50
uh the war of jenkins here or the war in
19:52
the bucket oh yeah the war of the
19:53
buckets so
19:54
the modernist who'd stole in the bucket
19:56
initially won the war and you can still
19:57
if you go to modena in their cathedral
19:59
you can see the bucket it's proudly hung
20:01
up
20:01
as a symbol of their victory
20:05
wow yep an open bucket go check it out
20:07
an empty bucket nothing in it i don't
20:09
there's anything in it now
20:10
no here's um a better reason for going
20:13
to war
20:13
and when the goals sacked rome um for
20:16
the first time
20:17
it was because they'd recently drunk
20:19
wine for the first time and they wanted
20:20
to take over the place where it came
20:22
from
20:23
that according to the orders the best
20:25
reason i've ever heard
20:26
it's good isn't it this is amazing
20:30
the shortest war in history the britain
20:31
zanzibar war you could argue was started
20:33
by
20:34
a cricket match basically it was that so
20:37
it was
20:37
in 1896 and it was started when zanzibar
20:40
declared war because british ships were
20:41
in a harbor they weren't allowed to be
20:42
in but they were in the harbor because
20:43
the british sailors on the ships wanted
20:45
to participate in a quicket tournament
20:47
and there was a football wall wasn't
20:49
there between nicaragua and
20:50
costa rica yes i think we might have
20:52
mentioned that on nicaragua
20:54
i can't remember but it was um basically
20:56
just there was
20:58
a lot of tension between the two
20:59
countries and then there was a football
21:01
match there was some
21:02
um problems in the stands a bit of
21:04
hooliganism and then that just turned
21:06
into a full-scale war
21:08
and and as in always in war there were
21:10
no real clear winners
21:12
yeah um costa rica has got a bit of a
21:15
bit of form as well because they had the
21:17
google maps while do you remember that
21:18
one
21:19
what was that i don't know um what
21:20
happened was um there's
21:22
a an island in a river uh between
21:24
nicaragua and
21:25
costa rica and they've been fighting
21:27
over it for years so this is really a
21:29
pretext
21:30
but the nicaraguan guy said oh this they
21:32
sent some people over there in costa
21:33
rica's like wow why are you doing that
21:35
he said well just look at google maps
21:36
it's ours and someone in google maps had
21:38
put the territory the border in a
21:40
slightly different place than costa rica
21:42
thought
21:43
and so they used google maps as a
21:44
pretext for what didn't last very long
21:46
and
21:47
google maps kind of apologize
21:49
[Laughter]
21:54
um okay we should we should wrap up add
21:56
one more interesting bucket
21:57
bring it bring it up uh the only other
22:00
interesting bucket i could find and it's
22:02
kind of worth mentioning because it's
22:04
about the sentinel
22:05
centenaries people and i don't know if
22:07
that's how you pronounce it but they're
22:08
one of the few people in the world which
22:10
we don't know anything about
22:11
because they're very hard to access so
22:12
they live in the andaman islands in the
22:14
bay of bengal
22:15
and um they whenever outsiders try and
22:18
sort of penetrate their their culture
22:20
then they get arrows shot at them and
22:22
they're repelled so no one knows
22:23
anything about them except
22:24
sometimes people go and leave gifts for
22:26
them and so anthropologists have been in
22:28
the past and they've left gifts of
22:29
coconuts bananas
22:30
pigs and buckets for them and they take
22:33
away all of these and they take them
22:34
back into the forest with them
22:36
but they only take away red plastic
22:38
buckets but they refuse to take away
22:39
green plastic buckets that are left for
22:41
them
22:41
nobody knows why a mystery weird yeah
22:44
well one day
22:45
someone's going to get in there and be
22:46
able to ask them why that'd be great
22:49
i'll be the first question yeah that
22:50
should be asked what's up what's with
22:52
the whole
22:53
red bucket thing yeah okay buckets are
22:55
quite dangerous
22:57
um the only stats i have are from 1996
23:00
but in that year 10
23:01
907 americans were taken to hospital
23:04
with injuries caused by buckets
23:06
wow did you get any details on the
23:07
injuries was that the pranks buckets up
23:10
on top of doors oh it could have been
23:11
that couldn't they i was thinking people
23:12
tripping over buckets
23:13
yeah that too or standing on one or
23:16
something
23:17
to get behind a horse a lot of americans
23:18
are into that apparently what yeah no
23:20
there's a documentary on channel 4 a
23:21
little while ago that um
23:22
yeah are you talking about what i think
23:24
you're talking about yeah i think the
23:26
name for the documentary was footprints
23:27
on the pale
23:28
and it's the that's what the wife should
23:31
look for
23:32
uh uh when she goes down to the barn to
23:34
see if her has been um been
23:36
messing i'm sorry according to the
23:38
kinsey report
23:39
a lot of uh in the 50s a lot of young
23:41
americans first
23:42
experience of um of sex was with a with
23:45
an animal
23:46
right i think the kids are important
23:48
slightly um debunked a little bit but
23:50
yeah i am all right i mean that
23:52
obviously does go on in
23:54
certain places i suppose and footprints
23:55
on the pale yeah footprints on the pale
23:57
could just mean they were using it to
23:59
climb onto the horse
24:01
i think that's what rich is saying it's
24:03
a great country song title isn't it
24:11
okay now it's time to head to the final
24:14
fact of the show
24:15
and that is james's james what do you
24:17
got okay my fact is there is a group of
24:19
chimpanzees
24:20
in zambia who wear a blade of grass in
24:22
their left ear as a fashion statement
24:26
that's quite cool how do we know it's a
24:27
fashion statement well because there's
24:30
no other use for it
24:31
and they've noticed that when it started
24:33
with one chimpanzee called julie
24:36
in 2010 and she started walking around
24:38
with this little bit of grass out
24:39
hurrier
24:40
and then whenever she met another
24:42
chimpanzee and they would put a piece of
24:44
grass in their ear and it kind of spread
24:46
like a meme around the zambian forests
24:48
and so they think it's a cultural
24:50
fashionable thing
24:51
and the pictures are brilliant we'll put
24:52
one up on the website but it's just
24:54
literally
24:55
like you know like um in um sitcom
24:58
in um sketches where you had a like a
25:00
farmer and he was chewing a long piece
25:02
of grass it's a bit like that only it's
25:04
sticking out of their ears it's a long
25:05
piece
25:06
it sticks right in there it's not behind
25:07
their ears right in there and it's
25:09
probably about
25:10
um i would say about 25 centimeters long
25:12
and they're just walking along
25:14
with it sticking out it's like an
25:15
earring kind of thing i i wonder if it's
25:17
to do with them we're the people who put
25:20
that in area that bit of grass and
25:22
you're the guys who don't so it's a
25:23
tribal yeah
25:25
yeah um the chimpanzees in the kabale
25:27
forest uh in zambia they use sticks to
25:30
get their
25:30
um sticks to get honey whereas badongo
25:33
forest chimpanzees use leaf sponges
25:36
and it's always people who are part of
25:37
this group and if they move to the other
25:39
group they use their
25:40
their technique so that seems to be a
25:42
cultural thing as well
25:44
so there's quite a few quite a lot of
25:46
evidence of culture in chimpanzees
25:47
i know that mandrills use like uh
25:50
sharpened sticks to clean out their ears
25:52
with but it seems like you can clean out
25:53
your hair with grass but yeah they used
25:54
sharpened sticks for that and they also
25:56
shave off sticks to pick out their
25:58
toenails
25:59
you've been seen doing that so that's
26:00
nice that shows a bit of fashion
26:01
consciousness
26:02
yes what aesthetic or personal hygiene
26:05
personal hygiene
26:06
yeah it's more than i do
26:10
can i can i throw a completely left
26:11
field i'm just going on word association
26:13
yes please
26:14
um but you just mentioned toenails and
26:16
it's one of my favorite
26:17
most recent facts that was that um
26:20
there's a
26:20
museum in america um which one of its
26:24
exhibits
26:25
is possibly elvis's toenail and because
26:28
it was found in the carpet of his home
26:30
so they think it might be his uh and
26:32
that's that's just sitting there
26:34
wow um also not related but i found out
26:37
this week that uh sir walter scott had a
26:39
salt cellar made from king
26:40
charles the first's fourth cervical
26:42
vertebra right
26:44
just another celebrity body part yeah
26:46
have you seen charles
26:47
darwin's stick his walking stick no
26:50
everyone should have a look at this
26:51
we'll put this on qi.com podcast but if
26:53
you want to see in person and you live
26:54
in london or coming to london you can go
26:56
to the welcome trust and they have it on
26:58
display
26:58
in their collection and it looks like
27:01
he's a bond villain it's got this skull
27:03
with
27:04
with emerald eyes yeah yeah it looks
27:06
really sinister it's his walking stick
27:07
and you go that's not your
27:09
that's that's satan's one maybe that was
27:12
just on his evil side
27:13
that's blowfields yeah yeah he was a bit
27:15
of an obsessive walker as well i think
27:16
he
27:17
in his last home that he lived at he had
27:19
a path made that he
27:21
just walked and walked and walked round
27:23
and round on this square
27:24
someone who loved to explore that's not
27:26
very adventurous
27:27
[Laughter]
27:28
i was um reading about uh stonehenge for
27:31
something about the radio show that
27:32
we're about to do um
27:34
and it was about charles darwin that he
27:36
was the first person to
27:37
um do an excavation at um stonehenge
27:41
um but what he was actually doing was
27:43
looking for earthworms and he wanted to
27:45
see
27:46
how the digging of earthworms would
27:47
affect the way that the
27:49
stones would change um how upright they
27:52
were
27:53
but that was the first scientific thing
27:54
done wow
27:56
wow we're really side swiping the the
27:59
chimpanzee facts out of this i know
28:01
yeah we should get back on track i'll
28:02
tell you well let's go to fashion okay
28:04
because there was a fashion in the 1860s
28:06
amongst
28:07
young ladies uh in england to walk with
28:09
a limp
28:10
in imitation of alexandra princess of
28:12
wales a concert of edward vii
28:15
she'd had rheumatic fever when she was
28:16
younger and she had a stiff knee and so
28:18
she walked around with a limp and
28:19
everyone just copied her
28:20
and it lasted for 10 years for
28:22
disappearing without a trace it must be
28:24
weird when you're a royal
28:25
because you won't know if people are
28:27
emulating you out of
28:33
in the 18th and 19th centuries i think
28:35
there was a ban on wearing over a
28:38
certain weight of clothes because heavy
28:39
fabrics were only supposed to be worn by
28:41
the wealthy
28:42
it was a social thing and so poorer
28:43
people used to not wear underwear
28:45
um so that they they wouldn't have to
28:47
exceed the weight limit and also in the
28:48
18th and 19th centuries i think in
28:50
france
28:50
it was fashionable to wet your clothes a
28:53
bit before you put them on so that when
28:54
you were wearing them it would become
28:56
obvious
28:56
they would cling to your body and it
28:58
would show that you weren't wearing
28:58
underwear isn't that raunchy
29:01
there were century laws weren't they
29:02
that said that only um people
29:04
with a certain amount of money were
29:06
allowed to wear certain things i
29:07
remember
29:08
in france it was something like you
29:10
weren't allowed to have more than
29:12
103 buttons on your clothes or something
29:14
stupid like that
29:16
that poor policeman is at the lower end
29:18
of policing isn't it when you're
29:19
counting buttons on women's dresses
29:24
sought after job i'm sure yeah i also
29:26
was looking this was actually um when i
29:28
was looking into your facts about
29:29
underwear rich
29:30
uh it was only in the 1920s that women
29:32
realized that it was good to sort of
29:34
separate breasts
29:35
for fashion and so pre-1920s and that's
29:38
in 1905 for instance
29:40
a french bus supporter came out that was
29:42
uh really really fashionable and it
29:43
effectively unified the breasts
29:45
and the mono boob was basically the only
29:47
fashion until the 1920s
29:49
you just have to have one wow one single
29:51
bit but you mean like a boob chew right
29:53
you don't mean like it looked like
29:55
one boob well the victims used to talk
29:57
about a woman's bosom
29:59
didn't they they probably only thought
30:00
they had one there's only one
30:02
men were horrified i like the quote on
30:04
the wikipedia page that says until the
30:06
1920s breasts were always treated on
30:09
mass
30:13
okay we are we need to wrap up uh anyone
30:15
got any last second facts we want to
30:17
throw in oh one interesting thing on
30:19
animals wearing clothes obviously they
30:20
don't wear clothes out of choice but um
30:22
i love
30:23
harry there are a couple of people so
30:24
putting animals on clothes is much older
30:26
than you think and
30:27
what do what do we call it uh when cats
30:29
do it like lol cats
30:31
oh yeah a lot of people putting clothes
30:32
on animals on animals exactly so
30:34
it happened in the 19th century a guy
30:36
called harry pointer and then there was
30:37
this guy called harry whittier frieze
30:39
um who lived from 1879 to 1953 he was a
30:41
photographer who made his entire living
30:43
out of dressing up
30:44
uh cats dogs rabbits etc and they're
30:46
really cute i'll put some of these
30:47
pictures on the website as well
30:48
if we can get them but um he preferred
30:50
cats because he said
30:52
rabbits are the easiest to photograph in
30:54
costume but incapable of taking many
30:55
human parts
30:56
poppies are tractable when rightly
30:58
understood but the kitten is the most
30:59
versatile animal actor
31:01
and possesses the greatest variety of
31:02
appeal so there you go cats are the best
31:04
actors
31:06
[Applause]
31:09
[Music]
31:11

32:28
you

=19
00:00
we ran it on qi a few years ago yeah um
00:02
which was
00:03
there's no such thing as a fish and
00:04
there's no such thing as a fish no
00:05
seriously it's in
00:06
the oxford dictionary of underwater life
00:09
it says it right there first paragraph
00:11
no such thing as a fish
00:17
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:20
no such thing as a fish
00:22
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
00:24
qi offices in covent garden
00:26
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
00:27
here with the three regular elves anna
00:29
chazinski
00:30
james harkin and andy murray and once
00:32
again we've gathered around the
00:34
microphones with our four favorite facts
00:35
from the last
00:36
week and here they are in no particular
00:38
order okay
00:39
starting fact number one james okay my
00:42
fact this week is
00:44
about kangaroos as you all know uh it
00:47
comes in the form of a question and that
00:48
question is how many legs does a
00:50
kangaroo have
00:52
i think i can feel this one with
00:53
confidence uh two
00:59
james is holding up a tiny button
01:01
where'd you get that that's from the qi
01:03
travel game
01:04
which is available in shops oh my god
01:06
that must be the most annoying toy
01:09
can you imagine on an airplane the
01:11
little kid sat next yeah
01:13
oh my god just any time you get
01:14
something wrong can i eat ice cream
01:16
no no i'm afraid the answer is i can eat
01:20
ice cream
01:21
okay i'm gonna put that to one side now
01:23
because that probably is very annoying
01:24
um yeah they don't have two legs wait so
01:26
if they don't have two
01:28
they must have what four the front the
01:30
front hands or legs i'm gonna have to
01:32
get my buzzer out again what why
01:37
yeah that is annoying uh no they have
01:41
uh three or five depending on how you
01:43
look at it um
01:44
the tail counts as a leg and that's
01:47
according to a new study which was in
01:49
new scientists a couple of weeks ago
01:51
and what they did is they put a kangaroo
01:53
on a
01:54
treadmill yeah which had pressure points
01:56
and could see when they were putting
01:58
pressure on the floor
01:59
and they found that in the normal walk
02:00
not their bouncing walk but the other
02:02
one they do it's kind of a shuffling
02:04
walk
02:04
and they used the tail in the way that
02:07
any other animal would use a leg
02:08
is it a weight bearing thing though yeah
02:10
that's what weight bearing
02:11
and propulsion yeah wow okay so i've got
02:14
two questions
02:15
first question is can they walk
02:17
backwards because that's one of the
02:19
great
02:19
australian either myths or truths
02:23
uh because the idea is that the uh the
02:25
the country's code of arms has a
02:26
kangaroo and an emu
02:28
on either side looking at each other and
02:29
the idea being that they were chosen
02:31
because not only are the national
02:32
animals but they can't walk backwards
02:34
neither an emulator because doesn't it
02:35
say on the coat of arms or ways forward
02:37
or something keep going forward that's a
02:39
terrible terrible piece of advice
02:41
for a lot of people yeah crossing the
02:43
road cliffs
02:46
that's true i think they can jump
02:47
backwards there's yeah you can see on
02:49
youtube
02:50
there's footage of woody allen boxing a
02:51
kangaroo in a very very weird bout
02:53
very odd isn't it it's on youtube yeah i
02:55
think moves backwards a bit in that
02:57
yeah yeah you said you had a second
02:59
question i do uh
03:00
yeah second question that i had was are
03:02
they the only animals
03:04
with a tail for a leg um as far as i
03:07
know
03:08
you do have prehensile tails that
03:09
animals use to swing around trees and
03:11
stuff and grab things but
03:13
not to my knowledge do they use them to
03:14
walk do dugongs use their tail
03:17
as like a supportive thing isn't there
03:19
anything where they do
03:20
do gongs yeah are they you know those
03:22
things uh they're manatees they
03:23
oh yeah a type of mannequins so you
03:25
can't so the things that sailors
03:27
apparently
03:27
thought were mermaids back in the olden
03:29
days they actually do have quite human
03:30
faces i think they have adorable faces
03:32
i'll put a picture on the website just
03:33
last time i was back in sydney
03:34
the aquarium they had like an arrival of
03:36
dugongs and it was
03:38
all over the posters uh in the city and
03:41
you know dugongs are here
03:42
and it was the most unexciting
03:45
attraction to
03:46
an aquarium since they had the lego
03:48
exhibition at sydney aquarium
03:50
lots of um bits of lego washing up on
03:52
british beaches do you know about this
03:54
there was a crush
03:55
there was a container crash in the late
03:57
90s
03:59
um something like a billion pieces of
04:01
lego went into the water
04:03
and they're still washing up in in north
04:05
and south cornwall
04:06
wasn't it weird because a lot of the
04:08
lego happened to be c-related stuff
04:11
like they're octopuses which are very
04:13
very special
04:14
and yeah little bits of secrets oh maybe
04:16
they are like little lego plankton
04:18
and that's what you were watching in syd
04:20
music yes remember there was that um a
04:22
guy wrote a book all about another
04:24
container shrimp uh that
04:26
had
04:35
yeah plastic ones were in the same
04:36
container didn't know that they don't
04:38
get the same
04:39
publicity as a duck stick because the
04:40
rubber duck
04:43
when have you ever bought someone to rob
04:44
a beaver
04:47
let's leave that maybe that was maybe
04:49
that was like a new thing that they were
04:51
bringing over this is our big chance
04:52
we're shipping over all the plastic
04:54
beavers it's gonna be a massive hit
04:56
now we'll never have them um animals
04:58
which have odd numbers of legs
05:00
okay are there any do you know any dandy
05:03
there's a crab isn't there yes there is
05:05
there's a spider crab
05:07
called macro kierra camp fairy
05:10
it's like that massive japanese spider
05:13
crab that you see every now and then on
05:14
the internet it's
05:15
it's absolutely humongous and there's a
05:17
study done and they found that three
05:19
quarters of the crabs are missing at
05:20
least one limb
05:22
and most crabs have got 10 legs in fact
05:24
all crabs have got 10 legs
05:25
so most of these particular crabs have
05:27
got nine legs
05:29
although they have lost them wow it's a
05:31
bit yeah it's a bit of a cheat isn't it
05:32
they should just evolve with one leg
05:34
fewer well they might
05:35
wouldn't need to lose that they can
05:37
survive with up to three legs missing
05:39
that's more than i can do um
05:42
there's a thing called a seven arm
05:44
octopus is that born with seven arms no
05:47
it has eight arms
05:48
but one of them is very small and curled
05:49
up and you can't see it very well so
05:51
people thought they had seven arms
05:52
people who didn't look very closely yeah
05:55
um and then also there's starfish of
05:56
course
05:57
yeah so all of those creatures like
05:58
starfish sea urchins sea cucumbers
06:00
always have multiples of five
06:01
don't they but they're not legs really
06:03
they're limbs limbs
06:04
yeah and the tripod fish do you guys
06:06
know about the tripod fish which is
06:08
extremely deep water fish
06:10
and it has three long protrusions that
06:12
come
06:13
off its fins so it's i think it's never
06:15
any more than 30 centimeters long but
06:16
it's little
06:17
thin protrusions can be up to a meter
06:19
and it walks along on them like a tripod
06:21
and it's really good because it means
06:22
it's at the right level for the currents
06:24
to sweep loads of prawns into its face
06:26
and it can detect vibrations in the
06:28
seabed if
06:29
predators are coming so i reckon that
06:31
might be the closest other animal
06:33
is to having three
06:47
basically a tiny worm with these two
06:49
minuscule front legs which they use to
06:51
basically crawl up their mother's fur
06:52
into the pouch
06:55
get their back legs later they are tiny
06:56
aren't they like they're the size of a
06:58
grain of rice
06:59
kangaroos when they're born yeah people
07:01
thought that um kangaroos had two heads
07:03
when they first saw them when europeans
07:05
first saw them because of their joey
07:06
on the chest oh yeah that makes sense so
07:09
when the first uh descriptions came back
07:11
to
07:11
to the west that's what they thought wow
07:14
um
07:14
they have there's the qi fact which
07:16
might have been one of the first
07:18
ever qi facts about kangaroos having
07:20
three vaginas which they do just in case
07:22
there's one listener out there who
07:23
doesn't know it
07:24
um so first fact i learned when i was
07:27
having my interview for the job
07:28
yeah was interview for qi was a chat
07:32
a lunch was it testing your response to
07:36
that what did you do yeah you recoiled
07:38
and discussed you would have immediately
07:39
been rejected i didn't recall and
07:41
discussed i said
07:41
[Music]
07:43
which is correct i like the sound of
07:44
that
07:47
that's the incorrect response i've got
07:49
two favorite kangaroo qi facts
07:51
that have been in the books and the tv
07:53
shows but i absolutely love them the
07:54
first one is that the mother kangaroo
07:56
mammary glands
07:57
so female memory glands produce both
07:58
full cream and fat-free milk
08:00
simultaneously that's wonderful the
08:03
child's just the roots got an option
08:05
they're like the waitrose of macropodia
08:08
yeah exactly
08:09
and the other one is that kangaroos swim
08:11
doggy paddle
08:12
when they go swimming that's their style
08:14
doggy paddle and also
08:15
they kick their legs independently when
08:17
they swim which they never do on land on
08:19
land they move both legs simultaneously
08:21
so you see them move forwards either
08:22
hopping or
08:23
using the tail to project themselves but
08:25
in swimming
08:26
dum dum dum either side did you know
08:28
that elvis had a pet kangaroos did he
08:30
i i've always been curious if anyone had
08:32
a pet kangaroo and
08:33
elvis had one he had a couple i think uh
08:35
he was giving them
08:36
i'm going off memory here but i think he
08:38
was given them by uh zoo in australia
08:41
and then he gave them back because they
08:43
weren't as much fun as he thought they
08:44
were going to be
08:45
yeah one quite cool thing when i uh
08:49
i read about kangaroos is kangaroo
08:51
mother care
08:52
kangaroo mother care is what's being
08:54
recommended for premature births in
08:56
developing countries so 10 percent of
08:57
premature birth and developing countries
08:59
the child dies within the first year and
09:02
in
09:02
90 in developed countries so it's a
09:04
massive problem in developing countries
09:06
and they're suggesting kangaroo mother
09:08
care which is basically where
09:09
you have constant skin to skin contact
09:11
between baby and mother
09:12
and the mother straps the baby to her
09:15
for up to like the first eight or nine
09:16
months
09:17
and it reduces infant mortality by 50 so
09:20
could have saved like
09:21
would save like 1.1 million deaths a
09:23
year and it's just about the warmth of
09:24
the skin contact and constant
09:25
breastfeeding
09:26
and probably bonding between mother and
09:28
child and anticipating its needs more
09:31
a pretty simple way of seriously
09:33
reducing infant mortality yeah
09:34
i've got i've got one last thing i want
09:36
to throw in before we move on
09:38
which is that um there's been a study
09:40
that's shown that male kangaroos
09:42
can attract the opposite sex by
09:45
impressing her
09:47
with his biceps oh yeah with his
09:50
forearms
09:51
they're apparently really important in
09:52
the kangaroo world to the point where
09:54
they frequently adopt poses
09:57
showing their muscles like bodybuilders
09:59
going hey ladies
10:01
two tickets to the gun show like just
10:03
for people listening dan
10:04
is doing the bodybuilder poses as i'm
10:06
doing it yeah if you've ever seen johnny
10:07
bravo it's a lot like
10:10
yeah exactly yeah and in a fight that's
10:12
often
10:13
apparently what the female kangaroos are
10:15
looking at at the males in a fight
10:16
they're going
10:16
look at the biceps on that guy yeah
10:18
because what they do is they grab the
10:19
other guy
10:20
with the arm bits and then they kick
10:22
them with the leg bits so the arms are
10:23
quite important
10:24
in fighting yeah but the legs are more
10:27
impressive if you want to attract
10:27
someone why aren't they going look at my
10:29
huge
10:29
feet how awesome are my huge feet guys
10:32
you know what they say about kangaroos
10:33
with big feet
10:36
[Applause]
10:40
okay time to move on to fact number two
10:43
and that
10:44
is anna yep my fact is that during the
10:47
financial crisis of 1720
10:50
parliament called upon stock brokers to
10:52
be sewn into sacks filled with poisonous
10:54
snakes
10:54
and thrown into the thames was that a
10:56
serious thing i mean that's
10:58
surely i think it was just uh it i don't
11:01
think they were intending it actually to
11:02
happen it was to express their vehement
11:04
dislike
11:04
um but it was during the south sea
11:06
bubble which was one of the earliest
11:08
financial crises
11:09
the guy who made the speech which
11:11
suggested this
11:12
was lord molesworth and he was drawing
11:15
on roman tradition which had
11:17
people who committed parasite uh which
11:20
had them thrown into the tiber
11:21
so he said what's parasite it's uh
11:23
killing your father
11:24
anyway even with animals as well there
11:26
were animals in the sack there was a
11:28
rooster a monkey and a dog in the sack
11:30
with you when you went into the river
11:32
oh was that it's horrible isn't it
11:34
according to another roman thing
11:35
if there wasn't any water nearby if
11:38
there wasn't a convenient
11:39
river or sea nearby you would be put in
11:41
a sack with a rooster and a viper and a
11:43
dog and a monkey and then thrown to wild
11:44
animals to be torn apart
11:46
oh my god yeah they used to put more
11:47
effort into punishment i think they go
11:49
to lengths to find these poisonous and
11:51
tropical exotic creatures
11:53
well i think this was because in this
11:54
particular case before the debate
11:56
because everyone was extremely angry
11:57
about the south sea bubble bursting
11:58
because people were ruined by it
12:00
including in fact um isaac newton
12:02
invested a lot of money in the south sea
12:05
company and he was totally bankrupt
12:06
after it
12:07
and alexander pope was not because he
12:09
was one of the crafty ones who exited
12:11
early
12:11
um but so did isaac newton isaac newton
12:13
got out in time
12:15
and then went back in he could see it
12:17
was going to fall
12:24
but yeah people were angry and so in
12:26
parliament was getting very vehement and
12:28
so before the debate the king made a
12:30
speech
12:30
urging people to retain prudence and
12:32
temper to ensure that
12:34
um the right punishments were
12:35
distributed and their response to that
12:37
was they
12:38
throw them in the thames in a sack
12:40
that's sewn up with
12:41
poisonous well the king got out in time
12:43
did you follow the people who got out in
12:44
time he and robert walpole who i think
12:46
was prime minister at the time
12:47
both got out in time but that's only
12:48
because their financial advisors had
12:51
disobeyed
12:52
them really interesting yeah
12:55
oh that is interesting actually this is
12:57
not going to be good for you
12:58
i'm i'm not going to put the money in so
13:00
isn't that in any financial advices are
13:02
that thoughtful for everyone
13:03
all the time um luckily
13:07
we learned our lesson and there was no
13:08
financial crisis ever again
13:10
absolutely it's not the earliest is it
13:13
the two is tulip mania the first
13:15
was that yes it was yeah it was 16 17th
13:18
century yeah so you should explain what
13:19
that
13:20
is so judith mania was in the
13:21
netherlands wasn't it and um it was when
13:23
people were suddenly started going mad
13:24
for tulips and the price of tulips
13:26
massively inflated and i
13:28
think the price of one tulip bulb was
13:30
the same as a 10-year salary for the
13:32
average craftsman wow
13:34
and then it burst and there's a really
13:36
cool story about two dominion which is
13:38
um in the 1630s that sailor was
13:40
imprisoned
13:40
in a dutch prison for eating what he
13:42
thought was an onion
13:44
it was actually a tulip bulb and that
13:46
could have fed the entire crew of his
13:48
ship in 12 months
13:49
oh that's insane who eats an onion just
13:52
on its own
13:54
a sailor who's not had vegetables for a
13:57
long time i suppose
13:58
that's pretty desperate not only are you
14:01
eating an onion you've just eaten the
14:03
world's most expensive onion
14:05
you know what as well it didn't taste
14:07
that oniony
14:07
[Laughter]
14:09
i was reading about uh parliament
14:11
because i don't actually know much about
14:12
parliament uh there's that thing of
14:14
that if the queen goes to parliament
14:17
then buckingham palace needs to take
14:19
an mp prisoner yeah for the time that
14:21
she's there just in case they suddenly
14:23
decide
14:23
hostage yeah which is a movie has that
14:26
i've not seen made yet
14:27
why not ever a really important mp is it
14:29
no do they get like the rubbishes
14:31
i think they get a the new guy yeah
14:33
sorry no offense if you're listening and
14:34
you've been the hostage
14:36
but it's normally not george osborne
14:38
it's normally not a really senior
14:40
member of parliament dispensable just in
14:42
case exactly in chess terms it's like
14:44
trading the queen for
14:45
a pawn except you've got 600 pawns and
14:48
this is the least good of them
14:52
it's the replaced one because you lost
14:53
all the other yeah i lost the proper one
14:56
yeah
14:58
i was thinking about mps doing kooky
15:00
stuff in parliament i read somewhere
15:02
that william pitt the younger he was a
15:04
drunk
15:04
and he once during a speech vomited
15:07
behind the speaker's chair
15:08
and then returned to his seat and
15:09
continued doing his speech until the end
15:13
there are contemporary reports that say
15:14
that but you don't they might come from
15:16
they might be propaganda from the other
15:17
side but he was a drunk
15:18
so i have one more thing on uh
15:20
parliamentary
15:21
misdeeds in 2010 a tory mp had to
15:24
apologize for being too drunk to cast
15:27
his vote on the budget he got drunk in
15:28
the
15:29
parliament bar and he forgot to rock up
15:31
and vote and hazel blairs who we all
15:33
probably know labour mp said she had
15:34
been out on the terrace with him but had
15:36
retired to the library when it got a bit
15:38
too lively
15:39
but this man's name is mark reckless
15:44
that's great um you mentioned the bar so
15:46
parliament has their own bar don't they
15:48
oh yeah they've got a few bars they have
15:50
a library
15:51
stranger's bar they're all kind yeah and
15:53
cheaper drinks they've also got a
15:54
hairdressers
15:56
yeah and this is really odd they have a
15:58
rifle shooting range
16:00
all the lords have one in the basement
16:01
yeah yeah yeah yeah isn't that really
16:03
odd
16:04
yeah they have they just go you go and
16:06
shoot a rifle
16:07
i think it's very rarely used they used
16:09
to have rifle shooting in pubs
16:11
yes it was like a pub spot that people
16:14
would go around the different pubs and
16:15
play against each other
16:16
and they banned it and you know why they
16:18
banned it because people were gambling
16:20
on it
16:22
that's excellent didn't it wasn't some
16:24
of it across
16:25
corridors and things like that yeah
16:26
incredibly there's some brilliant photos
16:28
of people taking
16:29
shots in a pub and there's like old boys
16:32
drinking the
16:33
stout underneath the barrel of the gun
16:35
it's absolutely brilliant
16:36
what should we do in this place where
16:37
people come and get really drunk and
16:39
disorderly
16:40
should we introduce guns
16:43
um anything else um can we just quickly
16:47
go back
16:47
to punishments because i have one more
16:49
thing oh yeah yeah in the olden days
16:50
they used to um
16:51
saw people in half as a as a mode of
16:54
execution which is quite a good way of
16:56
going about it when works
16:58
well not a good way but away it's a it's
17:00
a thorough way
17:02
simon the zealot was sawn in this way
17:04
supposedly
17:06
simon the salad yeah you know him really
17:07
enthusiastic
17:10
hey guys do you want to play rounders
17:11
later
17:14
but the way that they sawed him i don't
17:15
know if this is what they did with
17:17
everyone but they hung
17:18
him upside down and they started with
17:20
his groin and went
17:21
lengthways oh god the goldfinger method
17:23
yeah yeah
17:24
sorry when you said in half i thought
17:26
you meant as in a magician's trick me
17:27
too
17:28
but so they did it oh my gosh starting
17:30
with the grind that is the worst
17:33
but simon the zelda didn't mind
17:36
guys i'm not feeling as zealous about
17:38
this as i normally am about other things
17:42
[Applause]
17:45
okay uh time to move on to fact number
17:47
three and that is you
17:49
andy murray my fact is that there are
17:52
three times as many estate agents in the
17:54
uk as there are members of the armed
17:55
forces
17:56
yeah that is weird well it's yeah
17:58
there's been a massive boom in estate
17:59
agents recently and also
18:00
all the soldiers have been sacked so in
18:02
some ways it's i'm surprised
18:05
there are being huge cuts and people
18:06
said that the army is going down to the
18:08
size it was
18:09
uh at the boer war but uh it's not true
18:12
it's actually going to be substantially
18:13
smaller than it was during the
18:14
war yeah because in in wartime then
18:16
armies increase massively
18:19
it's amazing there are graphs of the the
18:21
armed forces population
18:23
from about 1870 to today and obviously
18:26
there are two vast spikes there
18:28
um but and it's been a gradual take off
18:30
since the end of the second world war
18:32
and are they becoming estate agents is
18:33
that what is it a straight swap is this
18:35
why i got shown around a house by a guy
18:36
in camouflage
18:39
now this house has a beautiful uh bunker
18:42
which you might want to use it's facing
18:44
north and it's very defensible
18:46
very debatable um i don't know i don't
18:48
think a lot of them are becoming estate
18:50
agents how many real estate agents do we
18:52
have
18:52
real estate agents or fake statements
18:56
uh there are i think it's something like
18:59
560
19:00
000 from memory in 2008 an estate agent
19:03
was showing people around a potential
19:05
property uh
19:06
i think it was in uh somewhere in the
19:08
south of england it was worth 350 grand
19:10
he opened up the walking closet to show
19:12
it off and he found the owner hanging
19:14
dead in there
19:16
a spokesman for the company said it was
19:18
quite a shock
19:19
which you would expect it would have
19:20
been good if it had been
19:22
sold by a guy called roy brooks do you
19:24
guys know who he is no
19:25
no okay roy brooks was an estate agent
19:27
from the early 20th century and he was
19:29
known
19:30
as the honest estate agent he was he
19:33
would give
19:34
somewhat two honest descriptions of his
19:35
houses that he was trying to sell so
19:37
i'm going to read one um this was
19:40
from the early 20th century by roy
19:42
brooks um
19:43
brothel in pimlico
19:45
[Laughter]
19:46
wanted someone with taste means and a
19:49
stomach
19:50
strong enough to buy this erstwhile
19:51
house of ill repute in pimlico
19:54
it is untouched by the 20th century as
19:56
far as convenience for even the basic
19:58
human decencies
19:59
is concerned although it reeks of damp
20:02
or worse the plaster is coming off the
20:04
walls
20:04
and daylight peeps through a hole in the
20:06
roof it is still habitable judging by
20:08
the bed of
20:09
rags [ __ ] ends and empty bottles in one
20:11
corner
20:12
plenty of scope for the socially
20:14
aspiring to express their decorative
20:16
taste
20:16
and nothing to stop them putting
20:18
westminster on their note paper
20:20
that's fantastic ten rather unpleasant
20:23
rooms with a smelly backyard
20:24
fifteen thousand pounds wow with a
20:27
smelly backyard
20:29
why did he do that uh well he became
20:32
famous for it and
20:33
then got a lot of people like looking at
20:35
his properties because he'd become
20:37
famous
20:38
there is definitely room for someone to
20:40
do that today
20:41
i went on a viewing with someone who was
20:43
looking to buy a place recently
20:44
and it was basically a condemned place
20:46
and the estate agent to her credit said
20:49
this is awful isn't it and she was
20:51
really really yummy
20:53
well the kitchen was all covered in
20:54
brown rust and condemned tape where it
20:56
says do not use this is condemned
20:57
equipment
20:58
and she says just looks like really bad
21:00
food and then someone can get to the
21:01
toilet
21:02
in time that was the first viewing i'd
21:04
ever been on that was quite that was 450
21:07
000 pounds in
21:08
zone nine and the four most
21:12
adulterous professions in the us are
21:14
physicians police officers lawyers and
21:16
then real estate agents no we're a state
21:18
agency
21:20
i do like real estate i thought that's
21:22
what they i feel like in australia
21:23
that's what we call them
21:24
real estate i think it is and in america
21:26
as well possibly yeah realtors or things
21:28
but here we just say state agency
21:29
hearing real estate agents is wonderful
21:31
um doctors that's that's not great
21:34
doctors
21:34
i know wow police how did they find that
21:36
out was it self-reported no it was um
21:38
from a website where you go if you want
21:41
to
21:42
if you're married and you want to hook
21:43
up with people like those illicit
21:45
encounters
21:47
and you have to put your um profession
21:49
in there and that's what they found
21:50
right well they might have been lying
21:51
about that i mean they've been lying to
21:52
the people in their lives as well so
21:54
it's entirely possible a lot of
21:55
would-be doctors were just saying yeah
21:57
i'm basically a doctor
22:00
there's a website you can look up in the
22:01
us which tells you if anyone's died in
22:03
your house
22:04
oh okay and how they did it um how they
22:07
did it
22:08
sounds like john bonderson's john
22:09
funderson yeah james uh
22:11
wrote an endorsement uh for this book
22:13
that john bonderson he's a um
22:15
he's a friend of ours he's a friend of
22:16
ours he does all sorts of
22:18
odd travels around the uk to discover
22:21
this book in particular was called the
22:22
murder houses of london basically he's
22:24
got this book which is all about all the
22:25
houses in london where there have been
22:27
murders
22:27
and he goes into detail about the
22:29
different murders that have been there
22:30
it's really really interesting book
22:32
um i got drunk with him once in central
22:34
london and
22:35
uh when we got drunk he went do you want
22:37
to see some of the houses and we
22:38
walked around london and he was like
22:40
here there was a murder and he was so
22:42
excited by these uh
22:44
these um just with the with the people
22:46
being murdered in houses though
22:47
um sometimes the idea of ghosts is
22:50
actually a desirable
22:52
thing that real estate agents real ones
22:54
uh use
22:55
um in order to sell a house i mean the
22:57
there's people actually used to put
22:59
wanted ads out when they were looking
23:00
for a house
23:01
with little requests for ghosts in the
23:05
house
23:05
wow um the word mortgage does everyone
23:08
know what that means
23:09
it means a massive kick in the balls
23:11
delivered to the wallet no it means
23:13
death mort it means death pledge
23:16
uh basically you hang yourself until you
23:18
die
23:19
sort of well the reason so the earliest
23:21
explanation we have for that is
23:23
from someone i think in the 16th century
23:25
who said the reason mortgage is
23:27
death pledge literally is because it is
23:30
doubtful whether the borrower will pay
23:31
at the appointed day
23:32
such some or not as is due and so the
23:35
land is taken from him i.e
23:36
dead to him so it's called a death
23:38
pledge or a dead pledge literally
23:39
because it's so unlikely you'll be able
23:41
to pay it back
23:42
that you're going to have the land taken
23:43
away from you that you wanted um
23:45
but it comes from the same route which i
23:46
find really interesting it comes the
23:48
word mortgage comes from the same route
23:49
as the word wedding so
23:50
gage um is a pledge and wed
23:54
was pledged and they both come from the
23:55
germanic word wadjo
23:57
[Laughter]
23:59
why don't we still use it yeah look it's
24:01
a stupid word
24:02
so funny it's a really beautiful wadjo
24:05
actually though the pride looks
24:06
wonderful
24:08
i think we've we've just realized why we
24:10
don't still use in the funeral
24:18
okay time for the final fact of the
24:19
podcast and that is my fact and that is
24:22
that uh i recently discovered that
24:24
medieval manuscripts
24:26
are littered with drawings of warfare
24:29
between
24:29
snails and knights they're just
24:31
constantly in battle
24:32
and the amazing thing is no one knows
24:34
why it's a total mystery
24:37
it's incredible isn't it wonderful it's
24:38
just so on the margins on the side
24:40
of all these manuscripts they'll just be
24:42
drawings of snails versus
24:44
the same size it's not a real size night
24:46
and a tiny snail it's the same size
24:47
it fluctuates sometimes sometimes it is
24:49
tiny by their foot sometimes they're way
24:51
larger than the
24:52
the night um and people are people are
24:56
looking into it to try and
24:57
work out why there was there was a great
24:59
paper called the snail in gothic
25:01
marginal warfare
25:03
and they have theories that it's a
25:05
representation of the resurrection of
25:07
jesus
25:07
that the snail represents a sort of um
25:10
highly armored chivalric foe
25:14
um they don't know they just have no
25:16
idea what i think it might be
25:17
you know when you just sat there
25:18
doodling one of the things you doodle is
25:20
like a spiral
25:22
and sometimes if you just draw a spiral
25:24
you might then turn it into a snail
25:26
and then when you've drawn to snail what
25:27
are you obviously going to do make it
25:29
fight at night
25:30
it does go down a bit there but um
25:33
there's a lot of paintings of the virgin
25:35
mary
25:36
um where she has snails in the picture
25:38
that's a symbolism of the virgin mary
25:39
because
25:40
their shells mean that their modesty is
25:42
protected
25:43
and that it was thought that they
25:45
reproduced without sex
25:47
oh really and they don't do that do they
25:49
uh
25:50
snails yeah they don't reproduce without
25:52
sex no no they don't know
25:53
with sex so the the the randy little
25:56
beasts yeah the hermaphrodites
25:58
and they fire love darts at each other
25:59
they certainly do so love darts
26:01
uh they're they're like little arrows
26:04
which are attached
26:05
uh to the to the snail but they don't um
26:08
they don't fire them through the air
26:09
they basically get into close combat and
26:11
then stab each other
26:12
and sometimes can stab each other very
26:14
fastly so the harpoon will go
26:16
through the other snail's head and out
26:18
the other side
26:19
and then they mate yeah that's not what
26:21
really what the painters of the virgin
26:23
mary were going
26:24
for no no there's a lovely 15th century
26:27
manuscript uh that's covered in cat paw
26:29
prints that i think went on twitter last
26:31
year went bit viral
26:32
oh we should put that on our podcast put
26:34
it on the broadcast it humanizes it
26:35
really because suddenly you think oh my
26:36
god a cat just walked across this guy's
26:38
head was the one where the cat peed on
26:40
it was it
26:40
did it yeah the cat peed on it and and
26:43
the guy wrote here is nothing missing
26:45
but a cat urinated on it during a
26:47
certain night
26:48
cursed be the pesky cat that urinated
26:50
over this book during the night
26:52
in deventer and because of it many
26:54
others too and beware well not to leave
26:56
open books at night where cats can come
26:58
as in arrive right cut it
27:01
forward to clarify that it sounds like
27:04
in the margins of these manuscripts
27:06
are where whoever was scribbling all the
27:08
stuff in the monks
27:10
let's say um it was like their own
27:11
little place in the book where they
27:14
could say what they really felt and the
27:15
drawings that they could doodle in no
27:17
one would know to stop them and
27:18
people have translated some of like the
27:20
extra commentary
27:21
written by some of these monks who are
27:23
frustrated from writing out these long
27:25
manuscripts and they're amazing so some
27:26
of them include
27:28
uh new parchment bad ink i'd say nothing
27:31
more
27:32
another one is oh my hand
27:35
and this one now i've ridden the whole
27:37
thing for christ's sake
27:39
give me a drink that's in a manuscript
27:42
oh god it's fantastic it's quite
27:44
exciting because i didn't realize at the
27:45
time when i saw this snail versus night
27:47
thing that there's a lot of mysteries
27:49
in medieval manuscripts and they're
27:51
constantly digging them up and
27:52
there's great blogs on the uh the
27:54
british library website on the
27:56
smithsonian's website where they go into
27:58
the back rooms
27:59
they dig through all of these
28:00
manuscripts and they managed to find
28:02
things that have just been lost
28:04
in their archives and they contain
28:05
mysteries once they find them they found
28:07
this great one recently which was a
28:09
it was a long-lost cookbook that they
28:11
were dying to find that they knew the
28:12
existence of and it was written by a guy
28:14
called jeffrey fuel
28:16
and he he worked in the kitchens uh for
28:18
the queen of england
28:19
in 1328 to 1369 so that was philippa
28:22
of haynolt at the time and um he was
28:24
basically known as the heston blumenthal
28:26
of his day
28:27
and he wouldn't have known who heston
28:29
blumenthal was
28:30
that's the mystery really yeah exactly
28:33
the only evidence we have for time
28:34
travel
28:36
he made tiny night porridge
28:42
this is what's weird about it it's got a
28:43
bunch of recipes in it and it has a
28:45
recipe for hedgehogs
28:46
black birds and then a recipe for
28:49
unicorns
28:50
and one of the one of the recipes uh
28:53
starts
28:53
with the sentence taketh one unicorn
28:57
that is so good
28:59
yeah that was the kind of cookbook you
29:00
know when you get a cookbook that's
29:01
really complicated and you open it and
29:02
you think oh i don't have any of it
29:06
straight away you're closing that and
29:07
going [ __ ] it delia
29:10
who was the heston blumenthal you
29:12
remember mrs beaton she published
29:14
recipes for
29:15
kangaroo going back to that yeah she
29:17
carried kangaroo tails
29:19
oh that's funny because the western grey
29:21
kangaroo smells of curry
29:23
does it yeah apparently well speaking of
29:26
uh kangaroos there is a manuscript which
29:28
is a portuguese manuscript
29:29
uh which has in one of the you know how
29:33
they always have a big
29:34
letter to start off yeah and there's
29:36
always a drawing inside
29:37
once upon a time with a big o yeah
29:39
exactly and then the drawing in the o
29:41
in in this uh portuguese manuscript uh
29:44
they have a picture of a kangaroo and it
29:46
predates
29:47
when supposedly um anyone had visited
29:49
australia by 400 years
29:51
now here's the thing they obviously
29:54
don't know whether or not
29:55
it was uh a kangaroo in the drawing
29:58
because people have pointed out it looks
29:59
quite similar to an aardvark
30:01
um and an aardvark apparently can go on
30:03
its hind legs when it's trying to eat
30:05
something off a tree
30:06
but when you look at this picture and
30:07
we'll put it on the website it's a
30:08
kangaroo like no question about it it's
30:10
definitely a kangaroo
30:12
there is a painting from 1496 that has a
30:14
sulfur-crested cockatoo in it which is
30:17
apparent native to australia yeah and
30:19
they reckon that that is
30:20
evidence that there was trading going on
30:22
throughout the world at that time
30:24
okay we might not have uh westerners
30:26
might not have sailed down to australia
30:28
but
30:29
the australians would have traded with
30:30
the chinese who would have traded with
30:32
indians who would have traded with
30:34
europeans okay
30:36
wow yeah that's amazing because
30:38
australia was definitely trading with
30:39
china in things like sea cucumbers
30:42
so there's no reason to to think that we
30:45
wouldn't have traded
30:46
that the trade route wouldn't have come
30:47
all the way through the silt path etc
30:49
yeah yeah they spread rumors didn't they
30:51
they said these islands that we've got
30:53
are guarded by
30:54
giant giants sea serpents and giant
30:57
birds
30:57
and they made it they made the spice
30:59
islands sound as intimidating as they
31:01
possibly could
31:02
just so that no one else would sail
31:03
there and also it was so that the price
31:05
would be so high so
31:06
cinnamon sticks they said that they were
31:08
part of a nest of a giant bird
31:10
and in order to get this bird you had to
31:12
kill oxen and hide them so the bird
31:14
would go down and get the oxen
31:16
and then you could sneak up and grab
31:17
bits of its um bits of its nest
31:20
and they were cinnamon sticks of course
31:21
it's all made up but it meant that when
31:23
you came home you could charge a massive
31:24
price because all five of my men were
31:26
killed
31:27
wow i'd have one cool thing about
31:28
knights so how do you
31:30
dub a knight um sword on both shoulders
31:33
right yep
31:34
wasn't always the case so um by the time
31:36
willie and the conqueror come to england
31:38
to knight someone you punch them in the
31:40
face
31:43
yeah it was a blow with a fist a bare
31:46
fist to the face or neck
31:48
and this is how william the conqueror
31:49
for instance knighted his son henry
31:52
just happy bunch in the neck when did
31:54
that stop
31:55
uh not sure it's still going still
31:57

=20
00:00
we run it on qi a few years ago yeah um
00:02
which was
00:03
there's no such thing as a fish and
00:04
there's no such thing as a fish no
00:05
seriously it's in
00:06
the oxford dictionary of underwater life
00:10
it says it right there first paragraph
00:11
no such thing as a fish
00:17
[Applause]
00:17
[Music]
00:18
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:21
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:24
coming to you from the qi offices
00:26
in covent garden my name is dan
00:28
schreiber i am sitting at a table
00:30
with anne miller james harkin and andy
00:32
murray
00:33
and once again we've gathered around
00:35
with our favorite facts from the last
00:36
seven days
00:37
and in no particular order here they are
00:42
okay fact number one and that's you
00:45
james okay
00:46
my fact is that the most painful place
00:49
to be stung by a bee
00:51
is your nostril is it it is in so it be
00:54
inside your nose
00:55
yeah the just the inside of your nostril
00:57
apparently it's the worst place to be
00:59
how do you know this well i know this
01:01
because there was a cornell university
01:03
student called michael smith
01:05
who decided to let bees sting him on all
01:08
different parts of his body and find out
01:10
which was the most painful
01:11
when you say all do you mean actually
01:12
all well the main ones
01:14
the main ones they find the main parts
01:18
of my hands
01:19
and my feet yeah i want to put nostril
01:20
on my head shoulders knees and toes
01:22
obviously
01:22
i'd say inside your mouth probably
01:24
pretty bad yes or your ears
01:26
like things that are touching your ends
01:28
did he do it on his penis that's what
01:29
we're all dancing around
01:32
well you might be dancing around your
01:33
penis i would be if a beard stung it
01:37
uh he did yes um he did it on the number
01:40
of different
01:41
parts of his body and he gave them marks
01:43
um out of
01:44
10 uh for how painful they were and the
01:46
nostril was 9.0
01:48
the upper lip was 8.7 and the penis was
01:52
the third worst place to be stung and it
01:54
was 7.3 out of 10.
01:56
wow he had one bee which he would hold
01:59
beside his body in order to make it
02:01
sting him
02:03
uh and that's poor beat just put back in
02:05
the box afterwards
02:06
well thank god that's over then half an
02:08
hour later oh here we go
02:10
is it true that bees don't die after
02:12
stinging you
02:13
mammals have tougher skin so if they
02:15
sting a mammal there's a higher chance
02:16
of the sting being left behind and then
02:18
the bee
02:18
not surviving however if they sting
02:21
other insects which is what they
02:22
normally sting
02:22
then they're fine that they can sting
02:24
them repeatedly do you know what a bee
02:25
does if it can't sting you if you're too
02:26
small to be stung
02:28
if you're too small to be stuck when are
02:29
you relatively not a human like an
02:31
insect
02:32
oh like someone invading the nest yes
02:34
yeah i know what does it do they bite
02:36
do they and their bites have a chemical
02:37
in that basically paralyzes their prey
02:39
so they can turf them out of their hives
02:40
and they might be able to be used in
02:42
human medicine for anesthetics actually
02:44
the theme tune to our podcast
02:47
wasps by emperor yes the song is all
02:49
about
02:50
how bees survive a wasp attack when they
02:52
come into their nest
02:53
which is that they heat it up by
02:55
vibrating inside
02:57
and they can sustain within their own
02:59
body a certain amount of heat which is
03:00
higher than a wasp heat so they
03:02
literally cook the wasp
03:03
inside the hive that's awesome we also
03:06
should mention the least painful
03:07
places just in case oh yeah a super
03:10
villain says
03:13
um well soul of your shoe would be yeah
03:15
it'll be amazing
03:16
um but on the body the skull tip of the
03:19
middle
03:20
toe apparently and upper arm they're all
03:22
very low rated 2.3 i read about this
03:24
horrible thing in new zealand where
03:26
they're selling the venom face masks
03:28
so the idea is that it works like a
03:29
natural botox so they need
03:31
about 20 hives to harvest one gram of
03:33
this venom and they claim it makes your
03:34
skin feel firmer it makes it
03:36
you've had a facelift but dermatologists
03:38
say there's no benefits and actually it
03:39
can cause you quite severe medical
03:40
problems
03:41
um bees can fly higher than mount
03:44
everest
03:44
we did the thing about landing a
03:45
helicopter on mount everest which is
03:47
incredibly difficult and dangerous
03:48
because the air is so thin up there that
03:50
even with the speed of helicopters the
03:51
rotor blades go at
03:52
it's almost impossible to do but someone
03:54
has done it has done it yeah yeah
03:55
but it wasn't a b just to clarify well
03:58
edmund hillary he was a beekeeper yeah
04:00
and actually it was
04:01
his beekeeping job that funded his trip
04:03
to get to mountain first yeah
04:05
yeah he put it on his passport when they
04:06
asked what his job was he said he was a
04:08
beekeeper oh that's awesome yeah yeah
04:10
other famous beekeepers sherlock holmes
04:12
yes he retired to become a beast retired
04:14
becomes a beekeeper yeah
04:15
aristotle as well was a beekeeper and he
04:18
made this really odd claim that
04:20
they survived for seven years when in
04:22
fact they survived for seven weeks
04:24
so either he thought well they're still
04:25
here and just didn't recognize that he
04:26
had newborn bees
04:28
oh he was a dog oh my god yeah wow
04:30
aristotle we've just blown this thing
04:32
wide open
04:34
i saw another thing in the news in the
04:35
news a few weeks ago that norfolk police
04:37
are warning people to be aware of b
04:38
rustlers they've been turning up in the
04:40
night and stealing hives full of
04:41
thousands
04:42
of bees oh really sounds quite a high
04:43
risk fish yeah
04:45
germany has fantastic bee laws and
04:47
roughly broken down they're this if
04:49
bees break away from a hive they are
04:53
only still your bees if you're in
04:55
pursuit
04:56
so as long as you're in pursuit they are
04:58
your bees so there is nowhere off limits
05:00
to you if you have to run into the
05:01
houses of parliament there
05:02
you can because you're few to your bees
05:04
yeah if you're extrapolated from this
05:06
law yeah if they then land in the hive
05:09
of someone else's
05:10
farm yeah and it's an empty hive then
05:12
you can break that hive down
05:14
collect your bees and bring it back and
05:15
just replace the hive if it lands in a
05:17
hive that's full of bees
05:18
then the other owner he's just he's just
05:20
acquired some new bees
05:22
now the best law of the whole thing is
05:23
that if you're in pursuit of your bees
05:25
there's a law that states that if you
05:26
see someone else in pursuit of their
05:28
bees
05:28
and your two b colonies collide and turn
05:31
into one swarm
05:33
you are now the co-owner of these bees
05:36
you're in business
05:44
um can i quickly tell you about b bids
05:47
please do oh yeah
05:48
this is an article by a beekeeper on be
05:51
dot org nice but the article reads
05:54
having about ten thousand bees on your
05:55
face is one of the best ways to
05:56
demonstrate how calm and fun bees can be
06:00
and so the idea is that so step one
06:02
prepare the bees
06:03
step two prepare the person step three
06:06
add bees step four
06:07
remove bees because into more detail on
06:10
how you do all of these things
06:11
so basically you attach them to your
06:13
chin and you have to put vaseline on
06:14
your eyes and you have to put cotton in
06:16
your ears
06:16
how do you attach them to your chin is
06:17
it like on each hair on your
06:20
chin or something you put a queen bee
06:22
just below your chin
06:23
and the bees swarm to her how do you get
06:26
her
06:26
you spray the bees with sugar syrup and
06:29
the
06:30
assistant will tie the queen around your
06:31
head so the queen is under your chin and
06:32
then
06:33
you just hold a tray on your belly and
06:35
the assistant dumps all the bees into
06:36
the tray and they just gather to the
06:38
queen
06:38
okay and you've got a massive beard made
06:40
of bees however he does point out
06:42
he's never done this without being stung
06:44
at least once or twice i want to know
06:46
what would happen
06:46
if you were in germany and you were
06:48
chasing your bees and they all gathered
06:50
on some guy's face
06:53
there is a myth about bees according to
06:55
the internet this is a common
06:56
misconception amongst some people
06:59
that bees hate bad language and will
07:02
sting those who swear in their presence
07:04
i heard that if you kill i think it
07:06
works with bees and wasps if you kill
07:08
them
07:08
you need to get out of there quick
07:09
because if you kill them they release a
07:10
chemical to warn their
07:12
hive mates that there's danger was
07:16
something in the
07:17
news this week that they found that
07:18
gorillas communicate by
07:20
b.o you mean guerrilla girl is not
07:22
guerrilla warriors fellow castro
07:24
just raised an arm well uh
07:27
yes arafat used to just fart whenever he
07:30
wanted to
07:31
because that was his kind of thing it
07:32
was his intimidation to clear the room
07:34
just it was just his thing he got so
07:36
much he just got so much joy and we have
07:38
the room to ourselves please
07:40
it doesn't make your presence
07:43
i was reading that urban bees they've
07:46
completely evolved
07:47
so um there was a study done in toronto
07:49
that showed that three out of eight
07:50
alfalfa leaf cutter bees have nests that
07:53
are made up
07:54
of shredded plastic bags apparently they
07:56
use us as sort of salt licks like
07:58
us humans and lots of insects um drink
08:00
animals tears together
08:02
we that we did on qri a few years ago
08:03
that there was a company developing bee
08:06
bomb detectors
08:07
oh yeah you train bees to stick out
08:08
their tongue at the smell of explosives
08:11
and things like that
08:12
wow you know how you use smoke to
08:15
um pacify bees do you know how that
08:17
works uh no
08:19
it doesn't make them drowsy as you might
08:20
think in the normal way
08:22
they think they're in trouble and so
08:24
they eat up all of the honey
08:26
and because they eat up so much they're
08:28
so full they can't really do anything
08:30
and they're just waddling around and
08:31
they're not attacking people i think
08:32
that's how this
08:33
the smoke stuff works that's great it's
08:35
good that isn't it i really hoped it
08:36
would be by getting him addicted to the
08:37
smoke
08:38
and so that they just want another
08:39
cigarette well they have there is a
08:41
study where they try to get um some bees
08:43
addicted to narcotics to see how it
08:45
affected what could possibly go wrong
08:47
yeah so they got some bees hooked up
08:49
cocaine and according to the results uh
08:51
the cocaine turned
08:52
good bees productive members of the hive
08:55
into untrustworthy bees and
08:58
graceful anthropomorphism how does an
09:01
untrustworthy bee behave then
09:02
i think if i remember this study
09:04
correctly bees will do a little dance to
09:06
say how much honey they have yeah called
09:08
the waggle dance
09:09
and the ones who had taken cocaine would
09:11
do that we've got lots of honey dance
09:13
when actually they should have done that
09:14
we didn't really find much honey we
09:15
mostly found cocaine down it's amazing
09:18
than anyone else has ever found you got
09:19
to come we got to come look what about
09:20
drunk bees do you know about them
09:22
no no so you sit in a corner and get a
09:23
bit sad yeah it is a bit like that they
09:25
um
09:26
they have more flying accidents and
09:28
sober ones
09:29
and they can sometimes forget how to get
09:31
back to the hive and die as a result
09:33
and if they do make it back to the hive
09:35
then they can be rounded on by other
09:36
bees
09:37
who punish them by chewing off their
09:39
legs so they're legless
09:43
[Applause]
09:45
okay let's move on to fact b fact number
09:48
two just a
09:49
call back there uh yeah okay this is my
09:52
fact
09:53
and this fact is that walt disney used
09:56
to eat breakfast like all of us but his
09:58
favorite breakfast was fresh doughnuts
10:00
dunked in scotch that's why it's nice
10:05
he's one of those people who when you
10:07
look into him just comes up with
10:09
there's so many extraordinary little
10:10
facts about him that you would never
10:13
have known
10:13
and i'm surprised that we do know i'm
10:15
surprised that we do know that he dunked
10:17
his doughnuts
10:18
in uh scotch i'm surprised that we know
10:21
that he used to keep his testicles on
10:23
ice
10:24
because he looks wait wait wait wait
10:26
wait wait wait wait wait wait
10:27
that was on ice it was his testicles he
10:29
used to put his balls on ice because
10:31
he had a low sperm count and he thought
10:33
that would help his electronics were
10:35
missed
10:35
yeah exactly yeah he the rest of him
10:37
isn't frozen it's just his testosterone
10:40
when we regenerate him there's an
10:42
enormous pair of bulls
10:44
there's a guy called josh schumacher in
10:46
america and he's painted
10:47
um a thing called snowballs and these
10:50
are pants that come with a special
10:52
integrated pocket
10:53
that cools a man's nether regions in an
10:55
effort to boost his sperm count
10:58
awkward christmases sorted yeah for the
11:01
man who has everything
11:02
colder testicles um a scarce story went
11:05
round a few years ago the
11:06
iron breed lowered your sperm count
11:09
basically would staff the scottish
11:10
reproduction rates i think it turned out
11:12
not to be um chinese
11:14
eunuchs um would keep their testicles in
11:16
a jar
11:17
in the hope that they would arrive
11:18
complete in the next world after they
11:20
died
11:21
i just moved house and i you know i'm
11:23
getting rid of a lot of my old stuff
11:25
i can imagine finding your testicles in
11:27
a drawer or something and thinking i
11:29
will hang on to these yeah everyone's
11:30
got one of those drawers at home haven't
11:32
they with just odds and ends like old
11:33
batteries
11:34
jars of testicles what happens to
11:36
foreskins what do you have to
11:37
circumcision
11:38
some of them can be used in cosmetics
11:42
and not really this is the most in the b
11:44
face mask i know they're used as
11:46
artificial eyelashes
11:47
they just no they're not andrew um
11:51
no there was a bit of a bit of a thing a
11:53
couple of years ago that some
11:55
hospitals have been taking the uh remove
11:57
foreskins from
11:58
children and they'd been using them um
12:01
to make cosmetics without the
12:03
patient's consent i did work experience
12:04
in the hospital when i was younger and i
12:06
was in an operating theater and they had
12:08
a sign on the wall about different kinds
12:09
of bins
12:10
and after i read it i was i think it was
12:11
the orange bin was for human body parts
12:14
oh i never saw one but i was wary of
12:16
that's like recycling gone mad isn't it
12:19
it's like
12:19
you're gonna put it in your green bin or
12:21
your brown bin or your
12:23
uh walt disney what do we have about him
12:26
something i didn't know about walt was
12:28
that
12:28
he was the voice of mickey there are
12:30
lots of mickey mouse's and one of the
12:31
actors who played mickey mouse married
12:32
the lady who played minnie mouse
12:34
which is very nice oh that's good yeah
12:36
that was good
12:37
mickey mouse there was a complaint that
12:39
the others were too big
12:41
and when it first came out and then they
12:43
said pitchers in the future will have
12:45
small or invisible others
12:46
quite unlike the gargantuan organ whose
12:49
antics have leaked have shocked some and
12:51
convulsed
12:52
others i get a lot of those letters too
12:54
[Laughter]
12:56
i found that yesterday this is not
12:57
really related but from um the mickey
12:59
and minnie thing
13:00
do you know fergie from the black eyed
13:01
peas um was
13:03
someone in peanuts what i've forgotten
13:05
the name of the character in peanuts the
13:07
one with
13:07
blonde curly hair um her voice was done
13:10
in the 80s by fergie it was the first
13:11
thing she ever did when she was like
13:13
nine years old
13:13
okay i've just googled it um she played
13:16
sally that's right
13:17
that's a really good fact yeah just one
13:19
other related fact to
13:20
people behind the characters ariel and
13:23
belle
13:24
so ariel from the little mermaid and
13:26
belle from booty and the beast
13:27
they were both based on a real life
13:29
model whose name was cherie stoner
13:31
and they used all of her mannerisms so
13:33
there's very famously
13:34
ariel does this thing where she kind of
13:36
blows her hair in frustration
13:38
and her hair blows that was just um
13:40
cherie just improvising and she
13:43
also had the tail of the fish she did so
13:45
i mean it was very convenient
13:46
but she wasn't just a model because then
13:48
she became a part of the family
13:50
and she was the writer and producer for
13:52
the animaniacs and casper the friendly
13:54
ghost oh really
13:54
yeah she was like a proper um that's
13:56
pretty good that reminds me of a fact
13:58
about the statue of liberty
13:59
uh it was designed by bertoldi and i
14:02
think he based
14:03
the body of the statue of liberty on his
14:06
mistress
14:07
and the face on his mother oh that's
14:09
just a little bit freudian isn't it but
14:11
that's like uh justin's mother would be
14:12
very statuesque
14:14
if so the she's worried big tiara all
14:16
the time
14:17
maybe um justin pollard one of the other
14:20
qi elves um
14:21
in his book secret britain he talks
14:23
about how the rolls royce
14:24
the statues the spirit of ecstasy is
14:26
based on the mistress
14:28
of mr royce was it yeah well one of them
14:30
uh it was their mistress who died in a
14:32
boating accident and it was his tribute
14:34
to her to keep her alive forever yeah so
14:36
that's that's his mistress on the front
14:38
of the car
14:38
um let's talk about breakfast there was
14:40
a study done saying that if you eat
14:42
cake for breakfast it's really good if
14:44
you're on a diet
14:45
and they got a load of overweight people
14:48
and they gave them
14:49
cake for breakfast that was the only
14:50
difference in any of their lifestyle
14:52
and they all lost weight and the idea is
14:55
that if you eat the sugary stuff in the
14:56
morning you're less likely to
14:58
snack on it during the day wow um so
15:01
a bowl of special k and a bowl of
15:03
frosties have only a one calorie
15:04
difference
15:05
and it's the special k that are more
15:07
calorific whoa
15:08
so you're better off eating frosties wow
15:10
really the iron that you get
15:12
added to cereals if you have a good
15:15
enough magnet you can get the iron
15:16
filings out of the cereal
15:18
there's a way of doing that there's
15:19
videos on youtube of how to do it that's
15:21
awesome yeah
15:22
disney world yes is the second largest
15:25
purchaser of explosives
15:27
in the u.s for their fireworks or are
15:29
they taken for terrorism no it's
15:31
fireworks but after the military is
15:32
number one or they're planning something
15:34
really big
15:35
actually that reminds me of a fact that
15:37
i almost used for the podcast this week
15:40
i read it on a website called
15:41
collectorsweekly.com and they said that
15:43
before they had fireworks what they
15:45
would do is they would get
15:46
two anvils turn one of them upside down
15:48
put it on top of the other one
15:50
put explosives in between them set fire
15:53
to the explosives so that the anvil
15:54
would fly into the sky
15:56
what could possibly go wrong i know and
15:58
it caused all sorts of problems people
16:00
getting injured and what have you but
16:01
it's a
16:01
hangover it's a cartoon trope of someone
16:03
being killed by a massive animal falling
16:05
on them
16:05
something that was a real risk yeah the
16:07
weather's going to be heavy anvils today
16:13
okay it is time now to move on to fact
16:16
number three
16:17
and that is you and yes my fact is that
16:20
the french used to call arsenic pudre de
16:22
succession
16:23
or inheritance powder because it was
16:25
used in so many murders
16:27
that was obviously not so sort of on the
16:29
tin
16:30
yeah and the pharmacy i would say and
16:32
harrison's better no it was actually um
16:34
arsenic was used quite a lot at this
16:35
point because um it was used to kill
16:38
kill rats and they actually also use
16:39
arsenic to colour their wallpaper green
16:41
so there are quite a lot of cases where
16:42
people would go have these sort of
16:44
symptoms
16:44
and when they went to the seaside it
16:46
would clear up because they're away from
16:47
their wallpaper and this sort of
16:48
lingering
16:49
arsenic was it wasn't napoleon
16:51
supposedly
16:52
poisoned by i mean that was the myth
16:54
wasn't it yeah there's a myth people are
16:55
pretty sure these days that he died of
16:57
uh stomach cancer not of wallpaper
17:02
to fill in on the official form cause of
17:03
death wallpaper wallpaper that was
17:04
almost
17:05
uh anvil anvil anvil wallpaper
17:08
it's like that either that wallpaper
17:10
goes or i will yeah it was that he said
17:12
oscar wilde
17:13
turns out he didn't say that he said
17:14
something like it but he said it days
17:16
before he died
17:17
and i don't think he kind of went oh
17:19
that was a pretty good end line i'm just
17:20
going to leave it there
17:21
he lived on for another 30 years in
17:22
complete silence yeah
17:26
um but this arsenic fact so i got it
17:27
from and lucy warsley's book about
17:29
murders which is really interesting it's
17:30
all about how the british kingdoms are
17:32
obsessed about reading about murders
17:34
the arsenic itself it was problematic
17:36
because it doesn't have a smell and the
17:37
symptoms are very similar to um cholera
17:39
and you couldn't trace it at all until
17:41
some chemists developed the marsh test
17:43
which is how you could separate arsenic
17:44
and prove someone had it before that
17:45
there was no way of proving that you had
17:47
taken arsenic
17:48
so it was not supposed to smell of
17:49
garlic when you heat it up or something
17:51
yes i read that as well when you heat it
17:53
it's uh i don't know if
17:54
they weren't cooking it yeah or maybe
17:56
they were putting in garlic bread
18:00
one of the best tests for the presence
18:02
of arsenic was developed by samuel
18:04
hannemann
18:04
who is the guy who invented homeopathy
18:07
so that was one of his
18:08
more successful could his test detect
18:10
like one part in 10 billion
18:13
well apparently you do need a small
18:14
amount though to live they've tested
18:16
it yeah you have it in your body yeah so
18:18
they've tested on chickens and rats
18:20
they've given them a diet normal diet
18:21
but only without arsenic
18:23
and they grow up stunted so they don't
18:25
know whether it's essential for humans
18:26
because i don't think they've done that
18:27
kind of experiment but
18:28
isn't it isn't it in lipstick as well uh
18:31
in some campaigns
18:32
yeah there's some traces in the usa i
18:34
think i think it's not allowed in any
18:35
british
18:36
cosmetics in the us you're allowed up to
18:38
three parts per million
18:40
um of arsenic in the lipstick wow
18:43
there's like really grim stuff about
18:44
food isn't it right yeah you had like
18:46
one hair for how many grams and one dead
18:48
fly
18:48
one rodent hair per jar and three up to
18:52
three maggots
18:54
one
19:00
but they used to think it was good for
19:01
us didn't they because it was prescribed
19:02
for a lot of medication yeah
19:04
diabetes tuberculosis malaria here is
19:07
arsenic
19:07
yeah pretty much everything it was it
19:10
was a pick me up
19:11
the cure yeah there was a medicine
19:13
called dr fowler's solution
19:15
um which was used to treat favors and
19:17
it's just a solution of potassium
19:18
arsenite watered down with lavender
19:19
water
19:20
and you would take a few drops with a
19:21
glass of wine charles dickens had it
19:23
overseas accurate tonic aphrodisiac
19:26
treats snake bites malaria epilepsy
19:28
morning sickness diarrhea
19:29
you name it there was also dr rose's
19:32
arsenic complexion wafers
19:35
they were advertised as being simply
19:37
magical for the complexion
19:38
um i've got another effect from lucy
19:40
worley's book which i really love which
19:41
is uh madame tussaud's chamber of
19:43
horrors which
19:44
which they originally was called the
19:45
other chamber um sort of filled with
19:46
models of murderers you go and look at
19:48
them
19:48
and during the first world war training
19:51
soldiers used to um be set an initiation
19:53
test to go and hide in the chamber and
19:54
spend the whole night there
19:55
and it became such a pest that me that
19:57
madame tussauds had to officially ask
19:59
the war office to stop them doing this
20:00
oh wow i have a fact that you'll like
20:04
and about arsenic and that is that
20:06
hedgehogs are immune to
20:08
arsenic poisoning hedgehogs are they
20:10
yeah i like a good hedgehog fat
20:12
you can build up a resistance to arsenic
20:14
if you try your hardest
20:16
is good news yeah there was some
20:18
peasants in the styrian alps
20:20
several centuries ago who ate massive
20:22
chunks of arsenic twice a week
20:24
and they claimed it improved the
20:25
complexion so not far off though
20:27
um and scientists said no that's
20:29
ridiculous and it's very poisonous and
20:30
they're like well how come our skin is
20:32
so good
20:35
but then there was a meeting in 1875 of
20:38
the association of german scientists
20:40
at which a peasant ate twice the fatal
20:42
dose of arsenic trioxide
20:44
before a big audience and they tested
20:46
him afterwards and they tested his urine
20:47
which is how you wow
20:48
before a big audience it's like people
20:50
were easily
20:51
entertained in those days well they
20:54
didn't have transformers did they
20:56
can't watch a man he might die yeah i'd
20:59
watch that like a shot yeah i think it's
21:01
like an early version of man versus food
21:03
man versus poison yeah that's a great
21:05
story today man one but next time
21:08
yeah poison poison poison anvil
21:13
anvil if you are poisoned with
21:16
nitric acid the way to tell is your snot
21:19
starts to foam
21:20
wow iris that's cool the um agatha
21:23
christie's novels so agatha christie uh
21:25
used to work as a worked as a nurse and
21:27
a pharmacy dispenser during the wards
21:28
where she got a lot of her knowledge
21:29
about poisons
21:30
over half of her character deaths were
21:32
from poison and there was one case where
21:34
she
21:34
i won't say the book in case it's a
21:35
spoiler but in one novel she is thallium
21:37
poisoning
21:38
and she detailed the symptoms so
21:40
thoroughly hair loss and things that go
21:42
wrong
21:42
that they were then used by people to
21:44
diagnose real-life cases of thallium
21:45
poisoning and she saved at least two
21:46
lives
21:47
wow what a great fact that's awesome uh
21:50
dogs can be poisoned by eating the feces
21:52
of drug users
21:54
just a fact it serves them right i read
21:57
in the
21:58
new york times that 2008 was the first
22:00
time in 30 years
22:01
that more more people died from
22:02
poisoning than from car crashes oh
22:05
wow oh i see i found the fact online
22:07
which i really like which is that jack
22:08
bauer has killed more people than sharks
22:10
how many sharks has he killed well the
22:14
aquatic series is coming up next
22:16
um other things that are poisonous
22:18
daffodils old parts of a daffodil
22:20
planter
22:21
poisonous ovarian effects if we if i ate
22:23
a daffodil i'd die if you had too many
22:24
of them you're healthy you can even if
22:26
you're trapped in a small space with a
22:28
daffodil
22:28
it'll give you headaches if you're stuck
22:32
in a lift and the only other passenger
22:33
is a daffodil
22:34
i would like to think that after the guy
22:37
eating arsenic
22:38
it was like and for our next act it's a
22:40
man in the box with a daffodil
22:42
david blaine will be with this daffodil
22:44
in a cupboard for 90 days
22:47
does that mean if you're going to
22:48
hospital and you're bringing flowers to
22:49
someone don't bring it out you're not
22:50
meant to have flowers at night yeah
23:04
i think the amount of oxygen a daffodil
23:05
can deal with in a night is not going to
23:07
asphyxiate
23:08
very often andy you think you're so hard
23:11
you can
23:11
sit in a room with a daffodil i'm afraid
23:14
he'll do it i've seen him do it get me
23:15
one now yeah
23:16
i'm right now we're gonna put andy in a
23:18
room with a daffodil for the next week
23:19
and if he's not on next week's podcast
23:21
you know what's happened
23:22
yeah all right uh it's time for our
23:26
final fact of the episode
23:28
and that of course is andrew hunter
23:30
murray
23:31
my fact this week is that shouting at
23:33
drivers improves their driving
23:35
that doesn't really work in my
23:36
experience yeah this is under certain
23:38
circumstances i should clarify if
23:41
you're listening to this in the car
23:42
don't bellow at the driver um
23:44
this was a study in kenya they have a
23:47
lot of buses are they called
23:49
my tattoos and the initiative was
23:51
basically to put stickers
23:53
in buses with appalling images of
23:55
accidents and and things like that
23:57
because they have so many traffic
23:59
accidents and so many deaths right
24:01
and the idea was to get passengers on
24:03
the buses to stand up and speak up
24:05
against these
24:06
reckless drivers who caused a lot of
24:07
accidents and they said look if the
24:09
driver is driving badly look at all
24:11
these horrible accident photos like on a
24:12
packet of cigarettes
24:14
and speak up and everyone just started
24:16
shouting at the drivers on these
24:18
randomly slow down yeah you maniac and
24:21
they found that
24:22
my tattoos with these stickers they're
24:23
about half as likely to get into
24:24
accidents
24:25
but um there is yeah there's an effect i
24:27
can't remember it's cold
24:29
there was a factory and they wanted to
24:31
see if they could improve the output and
24:33
they did loads of different things to
24:35
these people and
24:36
everything they tried the output would
24:38
go up no matter what they tried they
24:39
would make the lights a bit brighter it
24:40
would work they would make the lights
24:42
darker it would work they would try
24:43
everything that would always work
24:45
and just by the fact that you're being
24:47
tested or you're being studied
24:48
it makes people try harder because they
24:50
know someone's watching but i do think
24:51
this did
24:52
generally yeah no it's a really good
24:54
fact um so i have a news article about
24:56
shouting
24:57
just to slip in um a dog walker sparked
25:00
a major search and rescue operation
25:02
by calling out for her pet named yelp
25:06
and basically people had heard her
25:08
shouting yelp yelp and thought she was
25:10
shouting help help
25:11
and there was a massive operation to try
25:13
and find this woman who's calling for
25:15
help
25:17
people were kind there was um like an
25:19
open shaft nearby and people thought
25:21
that
25:21
their voice was coming from the shaft
25:23
yeah
25:25
spike milligan was put a lost dog ad
25:28
in the uh newspaper in the ad just read
25:30
here boy
25:31
[Laughter]
25:34
that's great was it one of um the qi
25:37
panelists
25:37
who said that they had a dog called
25:39
mingus oh it's ross noble is his
25:41
granddad's dog i think oh yeah
25:43
but um yeah so his dog was named mingus
25:45
i can't do the accent but ross said
25:47
and the problem with this dog was that
25:48
he had the same accent as ross so he
25:50
goes to the park to be chatting megas
25:51
singers and all the local girls are like
25:53
who are you calling
25:54
i um read earlier that there was a
25:57
ancient greek belief that basil would
25:58
grow better if you shouted curses at it
26:00
while you were planting it
26:02
haven't properly checked this out but i
26:03
like that because the bees would come
26:05
and pollinate it maybe they ever come to
26:06
the swearing
26:07
it's an ancient secret leave on earth
26:09
the the effect where you know
26:11
when you're at a party or something and
26:12
everyone's talking loud so you talk a
26:13
bit louder
26:14
and then eventually everyone's talking
26:15
really loud there's a scientifically
26:17
observed effect called the lombard
26:18
effect
26:19
oh yeah and it doesn't just happen in
26:20
people it happens in animals too
26:22
zebra finches quails hummingbirds
26:24
marmosets beluga whales orcas
26:26
manatees that sounds like a great party
26:28
yeah
26:28
[Laughter]
26:30
well they've discovered that there's a
26:31
certain type of bird that sings louder
26:33
now in the city
26:34
just back to urban animals yeah yeah
26:37
because it's just the the city noises
26:38
and i can't remember what it's called
26:40
but
26:40
it's i'm pretty sure nightingales sing
26:42
louder in their cities but
26:43
i don't think it's i don't think that's
26:45
what you're talking about see i want to
26:46
know if there's a
26:46
word for that effect when you say
26:48
something awkward because it's loud
26:49
you say it the music cuts out and
26:51
everyone hears you shout out we should
26:52
call it the ann miller effect
26:54
uh maybe not that's not a good one good
26:56
named after me
26:57
okay who's not here we should call it
26:58
the anna chazinski effect
27:00
um i like just with this original fact
27:03
of uh the idea of being shouted at when
27:05
you're driving
27:06
a bus i read this great story years ago
27:08
which this has reminded me of there was
27:10
a bridge in china
27:11
which uh famously people would jump off
27:13
and and try and commit suicide but if if
27:15
the police got there in time
27:17
they would block off the bridge and they
27:18
would have uh
27:20
try to negotiate the guy off the bridge
27:23
and uh this one time
27:24
um they were stuck for like two hours
27:26
while this this guy was on the edge of
27:28
the bridge threatening to kill himself
27:29
and um this retired soldier was just so
27:32
sick of the police not being able
27:34
to negotiate with this guy he just
27:36
decided i'm gonna do something about
27:37
this
27:38
he got out of his car he went past the
27:40
police they couldn't stop him and he
27:42
went up to the guy and he put his hand
27:44
out to shake his hand they shook hands
27:46
and then he pushed him off the bridge
27:48
yeah because he was like you're hot you
27:50
selfish holding up the truck you're
27:52
holding up the traffic
27:53
now fortunately when he plunged he
27:54
landed on a partially inflated
27:56
big bouncy castle bouncy castle that
27:58
they make
28:00
there was a children's party going on
28:01
below well you know you know when you're
28:03
committing suicide they try to lure you
28:05
down yeah they always
28:06
for a lot of if if you get there in time
28:07
for a lot of suicide people
28:09
like if there's a fire and they'll have
28:10
a blanket they'll like take off your
28:11
shoes before you plummet
28:13
some facts about um bad drivers okay
28:16
i spent some of this afternoon doing a
28:17
theory test online oh yeah how did you
28:20
get on
28:20
i passed did you yeah yeah you tried i
28:23
can yeah
28:24
yeah i got the minimum pass mark but i
28:26
just love these questions so here's one
28:29
it's a multiple choice i'll just read
28:30
out the options as you approach the
28:32
pelican crossing the lights change to
28:34
green
28:34
elderly people are halfway across you
28:37
should
28:38
wait because they will take longer to
28:40
cross yeah that sounds reasonable
28:42
wave to them to cross as quickly as they
28:43
can
28:45
or rev your engine to make them hurry
28:48
i remember doing these myself and they
28:49
always were terrible things like
28:50
referendum are just like
28:51
wait and proceed when safe yeah i know
28:54
there's another one where
28:55
you know you're at a lunch occasion and
28:57
you you'll have to drive in the evening
28:59
should you drink nothing
29:02
have a hot meal with your alcohol
29:05
there was an internet news story a few
29:08
years ago and i'm quite sure it's not
29:10
true
29:11
but it was supposedly the chinese theory
29:14
test
29:15
and some of the questions were so
29:16
ridiculous one of them was like
29:18
you knocked someone over do you a go
29:21
over
29:21
get the intestines and push it back into
29:24
their body
29:32
which is an accident casualty has an
29:33
injured arm they can move freely but
29:35
it's bleeding
29:36
why should you get them to keep it in a
29:38
raised position is it a that will help
29:39
to reduce the bleeding
29:40
be because it will ease the pain c it
29:43
will help them to be seen
29:44
more easily or d to stop them touching
29:48
other people
29:50
with their blood that's a real british
29:53
theory
29:54
here's a here's the thing about driving
29:55
you can drive fast enough
29:57
um for speed cameras not to get you if
30:00
you're driving fast enough on the road
30:01
how fast do you have to be going only
30:03
119 million miles per hour
30:06
top gear to you when they invented the
30:08
speed cameras themselves to encourage
30:10
speeding initially
30:11
and well he was a racing driver who
30:12
invented that yeah that's how he was
30:14
doing all the
30:15
curves and corners yeah okay i have a
30:17
fact about car insurance
30:19
okay the very first policy was written
30:20
by lloyd's uh in 1904 and it had never
30:23
been done before and so there were no
30:24
guidelines they were completely starting
30:25
from scratch
30:26
and so all the documents referred to it
30:27
as a ship navigating on land
30:30
nice i like it i have a fact about that
30:33
guy gatso oh yeah
30:34
yeah he got he died in 1998 but he was
30:37
caught out by his own cameras all the
30:39
time
30:39
and he himself said i am often caught by
30:41
my own speed cameras and find hefty
30:43
fines on my doormat
30:44
even i can't escape my own invention
30:46
because i love speeding
30:48
he said all of that um there uh just
30:52
with the uh the shouting thing
30:53
uh shouting obviously sometimes can just
30:55
really make you feel good as well
30:57
but um there was a study that was done
30:59
and this did win an egg nobel we've
31:01
mentioned ignoble one of our previous
31:03
guests was
31:04
mark abrams who runs the whole thing uh
31:06
an award was given to richard stevens
31:09
and some others at keel university who
31:10
confirmed that swearing
31:12
relieves pain yeah i remember that yeah
31:14
yeah it's called la lucia yeah
31:17
six percent of drivers will deliberately
31:19
swerve to kill animals they see on the
31:20
road
31:21
six percent well that's pretty low at
31:24
the same time yeah exactly
31:25
yeah and the way that they worked that
31:26
out is there was a study done
31:28
and they got like plastic animals like a
31:30
little plastic snake or a plastic
31:32
plastic scorpion or something and they
31:34
would put it on the side of the road
31:35
where people weren't driving
31:36
and they would count how many of them so
31:38
i didn't say it was a snake or a
31:39
scorpion i thought you were imagining an
31:41
elk or a puppy or uh
31:44
with my hedgehog facts i remember
31:45
reading about a man and he would drive
31:47
around and if he found roadkill
31:49
hedgehogs he would take them
31:50
make a clay cast of them then put them
31:52
back on the road as a permanent marker
31:53
so people would notice how many deaths
31:55
wow someone else drives around cooking
31:58
roadkill and eating it they maybe maybe
32:01
they're partners he's tried loads of
32:02
stuff
32:03
yeah he keeps eating this concrete
32:06
harder than teeth
32:07
i wonder just thinking about that
32:08
someone putting a plastic snake on the
32:10
side of the road i wonder how many times
32:12
a day
32:12
just even the four of us are being
32:14
secretly tested by scientists like
32:16
there's just so many of these things
32:18
what about that facebook thing the other
32:19
day what was that strange
32:21
see when you log on to facebook you
32:22
don't see everything you see a selection
32:24
that facebook chosen shooters to show
32:25
you
32:25
and they started skewing it so you'd see
32:27
like sort of pessimistic updates from
32:28
your
32:29
more emo friends and then they watched
32:30
you see if you then posted a more
32:32
sad update if they could affect your
32:34
mood by what they showed you
32:35
wow it's a fairly uncontroversial
32:38
finding i think that
32:39
if you see a load of miserable statuses
32:41
you'll feel a bit glam yeah unless you
32:42
hate all your friends which i do
32:44
so you've got the friday yeah i was
32:46
delighted i posted a lot of cheers
32:49
great to see neville's lost his job
32:51
[Laughter]
32:52
neville sam it is controversial though
32:56
because
32:56
um they're experimenting on people who
32:58
haven't given their permission
33:01
yeah but presumably snakes on a road
33:03
isn't well the rubber snake can't give
33:05
informed consent for two reasons
33:08
many
33:14
um okay uh we should wrap up uh has
33:16
anyone got any last
33:17
minutes from our first fact book
33:20
one two seven qa facts which is that
33:23
shin floss is a german 24-hour hotline
33:25
which allows customers to release penta
33:27
progression by swearing at the telephone
33:28
operators
33:30
keep your things dressed give them a
33:31
call that's what they're doing do you
33:32
have the number by any chance i don't
33:33
but hopefully you can put on our website
33:34
and we can
33:35
put on our website 1-800
33:40

=21
00:00

00:02
which was
00:03
there's no such thing as a fish and
00:04
there's no such thing as a fish no
00:05
seriously it's in
00:06
the oxford dictionary of underwater life
00:10
it says it right there first paragraph
00:11
no such thing as a fish
00:17
[Applause]
00:19
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:22
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:24
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:26
covent garden my name is dan schreiber
00:28
i'm sitting here with
00:29
four other elves i've got andy murray
00:31
james harkin anna chazinski and on fact
00:33
checking judy's alex bell
00:35
so once again we've gathered around the
00:36
microphone with our favorite facts from
00:38
the last seven days
00:39
and in no particular order here we go
00:44
my fact is that made in germany product
00:47
labels were originally intended to put
00:49
people off buying the product
00:50
it was a law pass in england in 1887
00:53
which
00:54
forced foreign companies to put labels
00:56
saying where the product had been made
00:57
on their items because
00:59
british companies were worried about
01:00
german knock-off products flooding their
01:02
market and being cheap and tactical
01:04
typical inferior germans exactly poor
01:07
manufacturing base
01:08
terrible footballing skills apparently
01:11
it was many to say the sheffield cutlery
01:13
industry
01:14
obviously it's ironic because made in
01:15
germany very very quickly became a stamp
01:17
of
01:18
very high quality so true fanta is
01:20
german
01:21
it became popular during nazi regime
01:24
it wasn't invented specifically for it
01:26
oh i thought hitler commissioned it i
01:27
thought he wanted like a german software
01:29
that's what people think but it became
01:31
popular then but it wasn't invented
01:33
specifically
01:34
right by hitler that wouldn't be
01:36
surprising
01:37
um i find it very weird when countries
01:39
decide
01:41
that their products have to be patriotic
01:43
or like you know the classic thing
01:45
during
01:45
the war in iraq when america and france
01:48
fell out
01:49
that freedom fries became the thing and
01:52
i love the story of freedom fries
01:53
because
01:54
it was one guy who was a republican
01:56
chairman called
01:58
bob ney and he renamed the menus of
02:01
three congressional cafeterias with
02:03
freedom fries that's how it started
02:05
and then it just spread from that yeah
02:06
and he didn't need to tell anyone about
02:08
it
02:08
because he has control over the
02:10
cafeterias so he just said this is
02:12
happening
02:13
so they changed it it's not amazing he
02:14
has control
02:16
yeah fascistic imposition of freedom
02:18
based
02:21
i did read a reference to supposedly
02:23
french kissing
02:24
a couple of real zealots decided they
02:26
were now going to do only freedom
02:28
kissing
02:29
i don't think that caught on either
02:31
freedom toast as well for a french toast
02:32
he also
02:33
he also changed that on the menu and
02:34
that didn't get as much press
02:37
you can make the substitution for
02:38
anything which is french new freedom
02:39
movie starring gerard de padua
02:41
yeah dawn freedom of course famous
02:43
english comedians
02:46
apparently they um bi-cutted french's
02:48
mustard
02:49
even though it's owned by a british
02:50
company and it's named after an american
02:52
guy called mr french
02:53
that's right he actually came out and
02:54
said please don't boycott us it's just
02:56
it's the surname of our family
02:59
have you guys heard of star spangled ice
03:01
cream yeah
03:02
you heard this this is brilliant so it
03:04
was conservative americans
03:06
had an ice cream company and they gave
03:08
their ice creams
03:09
punning names so for instance the mint
03:12
ice cream was called
03:13
smaller government
03:16
so can you guess what the chocolate ice
03:18
cream was called during the
03:20
bombardment of afghanistan well it was
03:22
called
03:23
choc and ore
03:26
even better the vanilla ice cream was
03:29
called
03:29
i hate the french vanilla
03:33
but it gets right to the point just back
03:35
to the freedom fries thing very quickly
03:37
it was really nice there was a counter
03:39
so when people were doing the freedom
03:40
prize thing there was a cafe
03:42
uh in santa cruz which changed their
03:44
menu of fries to
03:46
impeach george w bush fries which is a
03:48
really nice response to that
03:50
speaking of labels there are these
03:52
american handbags tom bin
03:54
handbags and they have washing
03:55
instructions on in english and french
03:57
that were made during the bush era
03:58
and the english ones are perfectly
04:00
normal and then when you read them in
04:01
french
04:02
they say do not bleach do not dry and
04:04
dried do not iron we are sorry our
04:05
president is an idiot we did not vote
04:07
for him
04:08
on all the bags that's great that's
04:11
lovely
04:11
in the first world war there's exactly
04:13
the same thing happened with all german
04:14
name products in the usa
04:16
so sauerkraut was called liberty cabbage
04:19
and
04:19
that was renamed as a result of a
04:21
delegation
04:23
petitioning the federal food
04:24
administration they said that sauerkraut
04:26
consumption had decreased by 75
04:28
since 1914 over the course of the war
04:31
and they said look we've got 400 tons of
04:33
it in new york alone
04:34
on our hands please rename it so that we
04:36
can actually sell some of this stuff
04:38
they're cool wow yeah german measles
04:40
became liberty measles
04:43
although that's sort of on the fringe of
04:44
you know freedom kissing or whatever
04:47
i was thinking about on germany because
04:49
obviously made in germany now is
04:51
something that's associated with high
04:52
quality
04:53
and in fact the obverse to my original
04:55
fact which is that made in germany was
04:57
imposed on the germans by the english
04:59
now the eu regulations are saying that
05:02
labeling should be more accurate so if
05:04
actually most of the work on a product
05:05
is done in bangladesh and the most
05:07
expensive part comes from
05:08
india then you're not allowed to say
05:10
made in germany because you're a german
05:11
company and germans are saying that's
05:13
really unfair one of the reasons people
05:14
buy our products is because it says made
05:16
in germany because they're really good
05:17
anyway this is a long-winded way of
05:19
saying german economy is great and
05:21
maybe has something to do with the fact
05:22
that their word for borrow is the same
05:24
as their word for guilt
05:26
so they obviously have really really
05:27
good borrowing rates personal borrowing
05:29
is very low
05:30
because it's shameful it's shameful
05:32
every time you borrow you
05:33
get a you have to say the word guilt
05:35
that was a really roundabout way
05:40
good i think i wanted to inform people
05:42
about the eu regulation at the same time
05:44
as rounding it off
05:45
no one can say you didn't do that i
05:47
think i did so i was looking into uh
05:50
made in china
05:51
as a label i was really surprised by
05:53
stuff that they produce
05:54
85 of all artificial christmas trees
05:57
are from china not really other things
06:00
that are made in china the us
06:02
uh uniforms for the 2012 olympics
06:05
really yeah and also in 2008 police in
06:08
china said they discovered a factory
06:09
making free tibet
06:10
flags
06:14
yeah but they they apparently the
06:15
workers at the factory said they thought
06:16
they were just making colorful flags
06:18
they didn't know the significance of
06:19
them so the made in china label is
06:21
exactly the same as made in germany's in
06:23
japan forced it on the chinese to say to
06:25
discourage people from buying chinese
06:26
products
06:26
shortly afterwards no way i quite like
06:29
funny labels on stuff and i
06:30
just remembered that the ipod shuffle
06:33
when it first came out on its little
06:34
safety label said
06:36
do not eat ipod shuffle which was useful
06:40
my sister bought a um pram for um
06:43
her first kid sophia and uh this is a
06:46
huge box and on the side of the box it
06:47
has a picture of a baby saying baby not
06:49
included
06:50
i can't tell if it was a joke all right
06:54
we should wrap up on this one alex have
06:55
you got anything to add going back to
06:57
soft drinks
06:58
fanta was invented actually by coca-cola
07:00
because they couldn't import their syrup
07:02
into nazi germany so they were trying to
07:03
make up a drink using the leftovers that
07:05
were available
07:09
okay time for fact number two and that
07:11
is my fact and my fact this week is in
07:13
1991
07:14
a professor at iowa state university
07:16
proposed that we could solve virtually
07:18
every problem of human existence
07:20
by blowing up the moon not every problem
07:22
this is what he said
07:23
not losing the remote
07:24
[Laughter]
07:27
i think that was included i think he
07:29
went literally through
07:30
wow so what problems are we solving and
07:32
how well the problems range
07:34
from weather problems to famine to
07:37
disease now it has been pointed out by
07:40
most scientists
07:41
alive that this is not the case it would
07:43
not solve the problems in fact
07:45
nasa was saying that if we did blow up
07:47
the moon most likely part of the
07:49
exploded moon would come back as a
07:51
meteorite impacting on earth
07:52
and causing sufficient damage to
07:54
extinguish extinguish all life
07:56
so actually slightly the reverse effect
07:58
of what he said
08:00
no it kind of would solve all our
08:01
problems we wouldn't have any problems
08:03
anymore that's true yeah
08:05
he thought and his name was professor
08:06
alexander abian
08:08
his idea was that you would do it
08:09
remotely from earth so you would put
08:11
explosives into the moon and just push a
08:13
button
08:13
when did you say you said that in 1991
08:16
oh right it's quite recent then yeah
08:18
enough to know better yeah he's dead now
08:20
unfortunately
08:21
uh and his children say that he was a
08:23
very sane man so
08:24
this is not this is not as if he was a
08:26
lunatic he was a very much loved
08:27
mathematics professor at his university
08:30
there have been a lot of wacky
08:31
suggestions about how to save the world
08:33
over the years haven't there some of
08:34
them you've got to admire and apparently
08:36
they
08:36
some of them could work so one idea is
08:38
that we wrap greenland up in a blanket
08:40
you guys read this no no so the problem
08:44
is so all the
08:45
all the green and ice is melting that's
08:46
obviously a bit of an issue so in 2009
08:49
a bunch of geo engineers covered
08:51
greenland in this big white blanket and
08:53
it's meant to reflect the sun so it
08:54
means that the sun doesn't heat up and
08:56
melt the ice and um it was surprisingly
08:58
successful more successful than
08:59
predicted but it would cost about a
09:01
trillion dollars
09:02
to do it to the entirety of greenland
09:05
pretty weird
09:06
it's strange that putting a duvet on
09:08
something would cool it down
09:09
yeah you would think it would just melt
09:11
it um but in a hot country if you go on
09:13
if you've got the sun
09:14
blazing in on you and you've hide under
09:15
it over here thank you is not a very hot
09:17
country no
09:19
that's a fair point so does the theory
09:21
work or not yeah it did work but it's
09:23
just that it's way too expensive to be
09:25
at all feasible
09:26
yeah my favorite fact about greenland is
09:28
that um until
09:29
quite recently uh 10 of the whole
09:31
population lived in the same apartment
09:33
block
09:34
what no one one percent was it one
09:37
percent yeah
09:37
something like 400 people out of 40 000
09:39
i think yeah something like that
09:42
isn't that cool yeah that's right it's
09:43
called block k i think or something like
09:45
that
09:46
block p i got that completely wrong
09:48
didn't i
09:49
i knew there's a fact in there somewhere
09:51
so did we work out what kind of problems
09:53
he was going to solve
09:54
it was one of those things where he kind
09:56
of just made the statement he didn't
09:58
publish a paper on it or anything he
09:59
just kind of loosely gave the
10:01
territories and it was stuff like
10:03
the weather pattern he didn't really go
10:04
into it
10:06
hi been cut off at high tide on a beach
10:08
is always a nightmare it's always a
10:09
nightmare that's going to stop yeah
10:11
losing your remote that was a big part
10:13
of his decision
10:15
would there be any tides left without
10:17
the moon yeah because the sun does
10:19
is has tidal forces there are solar
10:21
tides as well yeah it just would mean
10:22
that it would be high tide at
10:24
midday every day everywhere in the world
10:27
where you were if it was midday it'd be
10:28
high tide oh that's so boring it's like
10:30
decimalization isn't it
10:32
so no all those tied timetables that
10:34
have been reprinted as well
10:36
crazy pounds chilling in pence world of
10:38
the moon
10:39
mollusk's reproductive organs grow and
10:42
shrink
10:43
according to the phases of the moon so
10:45
if there was no moon
10:47
would they stay big or stay small it
10:48
depends when you blew up the moon yeah
10:52
so there'd be a powerful lobby from the
10:53
mollusk community to blow it up when
10:54
they were big
10:55
is that like that's like the wind
10:57
changing when the moon blows up your
11:00
face you suck that way
11:01
your testicle will remain the same size
11:03
forever
11:04
i think we shouldn't be too judgmental
11:06
it should be because he i think he
11:08
abian is that what he was called when he
11:10
died he said
11:11
those critics who dismissed my ideas
11:14
very close to those who dismissed
11:15
galileo and it was
11:16
true you know when galileo was thinking
11:19
that so maybe
11:20
300 years when the moon's just in
11:22
shattered pieces across the universe
11:23
i don't think galileo ever proposed
11:24
blowing up the moon it wasn't smart
11:26
enough
11:30
there was a plan to do a nuclear
11:32
explosion on the moon wasn't there by
11:33
america
11:34
uh as a show of might to the russians
11:37
wow
11:37
yeah it was like a pr exercise oh that
11:40
is fascinating sort of pointlessly
11:42
exploding something
11:43
yeah i mean it wouldn't have blown up
11:44
the moon it would have just made a bit
11:46
of a flash
11:46
the idea was the russians would look up
11:48
and go oh my god they blew up
11:50
a bit of the moon they must be a lot
11:52
better than us
11:53
oh they've got terrible aim were they
11:56
trying to hit us there
11:58
eastern europe come on they can't hit a
12:00
bundle
12:02
yeah i of course um
12:05
shaking my head because i know dad is
12:07
gonna say something about yetis or
12:09
vampires no it's my favorite book of
12:11
recent times that i purchased which is
12:13
called who built the moon
12:14
and it's a really lovely theory that um
12:17
the moon is artificial because
12:19
back when the rocks were originally
12:21
brought back from nasa's apollo 11
12:23
mission
12:24
the geologists who were studying the
12:25
rocks said this says made in china
12:29
no they they said that basically the
12:32
moon is just
12:33
it's such a weird thing the moon the way
12:35
it sits the position it sits in
12:37
the perfectness of the distance between
12:39
the sun and the earth
12:40
and uh and just all the features that it
12:43
allows for
12:44
the tides and all that it just it's
12:45
easier to to prove it doesn't exist than
12:48
to prove it does exist
12:50
um there are people called ecosexuals
12:54
do you know about these guys is it
12:56
people who like having sex with the
12:58
planet
12:59
yes in a way there are people who have
13:03
married the moon
13:04
oh wow there were also people who
13:06
married the earth and they interviewed
13:08
these people and they said there were
13:09
450 of us and we're all married to the
13:12
earth
13:13
has anyone had a divorce to the earth
13:14
because they fell in love with the moon
13:17
because actually these people who
13:18
married the moon and married the earth
13:21
they also married the appalachian
13:23
mountains
13:24
and some snow in ottawa i'm tiring of
13:26
these people and
13:27
when they go to spain later this summer
13:29
according to the news report they plan
13:31
to marry some hunks of coal in the
13:37
so they're all [ __ ] basically they're
13:39
just putting themselves out there left
13:41
right and center and the wedding
13:42
ceremony though where you've got
13:44
the person standing on one side of the
13:45
altar and the entire earth on the other
13:47
side of the earth
13:48
where the guests sit for a mountain
13:50
range
13:52
yeah you might now kiss the snow yeah
13:55
the wedding ended tragically when the
13:57
groom melted
13:57
[Laughter]
14:01
so could we survive without the moon is
14:02
that at all possible i
14:05
don't think i doubt it there would be
14:06
earthquakes wouldn't there and
14:08
um volcanoes and one theory is that
14:12
the earth's rotational axis is as if it
14:14
just disappeared
14:15
that the earth rotational axis would uh
14:17
go way off
14:18
and provoke drastic climate change oh
14:20
yeah because doesn't the
14:22
um moon stop us from wobbling like
14:24
there's a natural wobble of planets
14:26
and because we have the moon it steadies
14:27
the earth and without that i think it
14:29
would cause
14:30
dramatic climate change yeah probably
14:32
like what happened to mars
14:34
oh really i think so like as in we would
14:37
end up with no atmosphere
14:38
we are so lucky to have the moon yeah
14:40
yeah thank you and your friend dan is
14:42
trying to destroy it
14:44
i know he wants to help
14:47
this amazing thing and alex you'll
14:49
probably have to help me find
14:50
the proper fact about this but there was
14:52
a story about when apollo 10
14:54
went around the backside of the moon so
14:56
you know how you lose contact
14:58
with the earth because you can't get any
15:00
signals it's like o2
15:02
on a regular day it's like this is a
15:04
terrible signal
15:05
so they have a few minutes behind the
15:06
moon and the astronauts in apollo 10
15:09
as they were going around the moon they
15:11
started hearing this amazing orchestra
15:13
and they couldn't explain it and what's
15:14
really interesting is it's only recently
15:16
that they've declassified these papers
15:18
and the conversation that they had was
15:20
they were going we can't tell everyone
15:22
back on earth
15:23
that we're hearing this because they
15:25
just won't believe us that will be our
15:26
career over if we suddenly claim to hear
15:28
this orchestra
15:29
it took them years to work out what it
15:30
was it turns out that it was a
15:32
beam that was coming off from saturn i
15:35
think it was
15:36
um alex you might have to help me on
15:37
that one there i can find i found a
15:39
video
15:40
that about the the phenomenon and it
15:42
obviously happened but i can't find
15:43
anything about an explanation
15:45
eugene cernan described it several times
15:46
as an outer spacey style
15:48
type music he probably just swallowed
15:50
his ipod nano
15:53
patrick moore was a keen a keen musician
15:56
um
15:56
he's a glockenspiel player xylophonist
15:59
don't confuse glockenspiels and
16:00
xylophones
16:01
he played a really fun prank in 1976 on
16:03
april the first
16:04
because obviously he did his radio
16:06
program what was it called sky night sky
16:08
at night but on april the first 1976
16:10
patrick moore told a radio audience that
16:12
unusual planetary alignment would cause
16:14
people on earth to weigh
16:15
a little bit less at 9 47 in the morning
16:17
and that if everyone jumped in the air
16:19
they'd experience a strange sensation of
16:21
weightlessness
16:22
lots of people did it and they
16:23
immediately called up the radio to say
16:25
hey it happened i felt it
16:26
i was weightless for a second yeah
16:27
people claim they actually levitated
16:29
yeah
16:29
yeah that's great it's such a good hoax
16:31
i love it i like the fact that the
16:33
first player person to play golf
16:35
probably the only person who played golf
16:36
on the moon alan shepard
16:38
missed it on his first attempt kind of
16:41
shot yeah he missed the shot
16:42
wow he was in a spacesuit which i guess
16:44
it's hard to hit a golf ball
16:45
one thing i really really like is that
16:47
when neil armstrong and buzz aldrin
16:49
first landed on the moon they just
16:50
landed uh nasa
16:51
got in touch with them and ordered them
16:53
to eat a meal and go to sleep
16:55
yeah can you imagine having just landed
16:56
on the moon and being told to go to bed
16:58
let's have a nap
16:59
yeah it's open up get to the moon this
17:01
is what we can do
17:02
we don't deserve to be contacted by
17:03
others
17:06
[Music]
17:08
okay time for fact number three and that
17:11
is james harkin
17:12
okay my fact this week is um something i
17:15
read on mentalfloss.com
17:18
and it is that in new york city until
17:20
1925
17:22
drivers going east or west stopped to
17:24
the amber light and drove on green
17:26
while drivers going north or south drove
17:29
on an amber
17:30
light and stopped on green so it was it
17:33
was it like a traffic light that had no
17:34
back
17:35
yeah you could see it from all different
17:37
directions so but you'd have to know
17:39
whether you're going east or west or
17:40
north or south which sounds
17:42
but in new york i suppose that's easier
17:44
than london which has no grid system for
17:47
most of it
17:47
yeah easier less easy than just saying
17:50
across the city
17:51
red means stop why did they do they must
17:54
have had a reason for splitting it up
17:56
like that no no i think it's because
17:57
they
17:58
aren't they use the same lights for
18:00
people going in
18:01
each directions wow so when it was on
18:03
amber these guys could go and when it
18:04
was on green these guys could go but it
18:06
was the same
18:06
mental i think there were no diagonals
18:08
in new york as well
18:11
similar kind of thing in london the
18:13
circle line
18:14
on the underground used to be owned by
18:16
two different companies i.e
18:18
the clockwise bit was owned by one and
18:20
the anti-clockwise is owned by another
18:21
and you had to get a separate ticket
18:23
from a different office sometimes the
18:25
companies would try and sell you a
18:26
ticket so you'd go around
18:27
30 stops their way rather than go back
18:30
three stops with the other company
18:32
wow sounds like journey planner on tfl
18:35
i can't have to take seven items of
18:37
transport together who was
18:38
alex was it you yesterday who's saying
18:40
that the most popular tube journey
18:42
is covent guard into leicester square oh
18:43
yeah yeah it's the most popular one and
18:45
the shortest distance and the shortest
18:46
commonly traveled
18:47
unless you take the anti-clockwise route
18:49
in which case
18:50
it's pretty long yeah during the
18:54
cultural revolution
18:55
uh in china um they wanted to change it
18:58
so that green meant spot
18:59
stop and red meant go because obviously
19:01
red was a much more positive
19:03
color in those days it's very strong i
19:05
love about the cultural revolution that
19:06
fact about how
19:08
um they tried to kill all the sparrows
19:10
because
19:11
they were eating all the crops do you
19:13
remember that i think that was the great
19:14
leap forward was it
19:16
yes it wasn't a mao yeah so what did
19:18
they do there were like half a
19:19
half a billion sparrows in china and
19:22
they
19:22
um had a scheme where everyone was
19:24
encouraged to kill them all
19:25
and so everyone killed all the sparrows
19:27
and then that's great because they're
19:29
not eating the crops anymore but they
19:30
didn't realize that actually the
19:31
sparrows were eating all the insects
19:32
that were eating the crops so they got
19:34
rid of the sparrows and then all the f
19:35
all the crops died because they were
19:37
eaten by insects instead fools
19:39
people never anticipate introductions
19:41
and culling people never seem to
19:42
anticipate the natural knock-on effect
19:43
oh exactly even though it happens every
19:45
time yeah
19:46
i really like that guy who wanted to
19:47
introduce to america every single bird
19:49
mentioned in shakespeare
19:50
and he introduced tons of them and one
19:52
of them is now the biggest pest in
19:54
america and i can't know which one it is
19:55
is it called scaling or something like
19:56
that yes something like that sailing
19:58
like that yeah i have an amazing sparrow
20:01
factor that i found yesterday
20:02
i'm so glad this has come up i read this
20:04
in a carl sagan book i was in foils
20:06
and just flipped it open to random page
20:08
and it was that
20:10
sparrow's testicles are a millimeter
20:12
long
20:13
and weigh one milligram oh so i tweeted
20:16
that yesterday
20:17
and case molecule who is the natural
20:19
history museum
20:20
in rotterdam's head curator uh he got
20:23
back to me
20:23
saying that in april and may the
20:26
sparrow's testicles will grow to the
20:27
size of a kidney bean
20:29
wow a millimeter oh my days that's like
20:32
a
20:33
that's what's happening like a thousand
20:34
times i had a full moon
20:36
[Laughter]
20:38
i read yesterday that on also on
20:41
testicle news
20:42
oh yeah not that wasn't the website
20:45
so i read that hippos can hide their
20:48
testicles
20:49
around their body like on their
20:51
shoulders
20:54
what they can do is they can retract
20:55
them up to a foot inside their body
20:58
and the reason that they do it is
21:00
because when hippos used to fight each
21:01
other or when hippos do fight each other
21:03
they often go for the testicles
21:05
and so it's evolved as kind of an
21:07
evolutionary way of moving their
21:08
testicles out of the way
21:10
and it's a real problem if you're trying
21:11
to castrate them
21:16
believe hippos have beaten you guys to
21:17
it you surely you wish that you'd
21:19
evolved
21:19
wwf wrestlers do it that's the okay
21:22
right
21:23
this is this goes back to uh ian fleming
21:26
because
21:26
in one of his books i think it's in you
21:28
only live twice
21:29
bond's getting his instructions from m
21:31
and m says be careful of
21:32
sumo wrestlers in japan because they can
21:35
always draw their testicles into their
21:36
body
21:37
why be careful
21:40
watch out for those testicle retractors
21:57
them into themselves if i had a half
21:59
hour with you andy
22:02
and i had a lot of determination but
22:05
the fact that i'm kind of uh we've
22:07
slightly jumped past which i love
22:08
way more is that hippos kick each other
22:11
in the balls
22:13
bite their balls oh wow because if you
22:15
think about it it's a good
22:16
if you're fighting someone for um sexual
22:19
reasons as in you're trying to get the
22:21
lady
22:21
hippo yeah then a good way of going
22:24
against the guy is to bite his testicles
22:26
off because then he can't mate with the
22:27
female two birds one stone so you sort
22:29
of [ __ ] him and also
22:30
one bird no stones i i think we should
22:33
maybe go back to traffic lights yeah
22:35
sure
22:38
i was reading about the history of signs
22:40
and when the two people who standardized
22:42
signposts in the uk it's pretty
22:43
thrilling reading
22:44
um were jock kinnear and margaret
22:46
calvert in the 1950s but one of the
22:48
things there was uproar about when they
22:50
were standardizing signposts was
22:52
signs had usually been in capital
22:53
letters and their proposal to put them
22:55
in lower case
22:56
apparently caused outrage in the sign
22:58
making communities
23:00
now i can't even they decided because
23:03
it's easier to read from a distance
23:04
because capitals can look all
23:05
sort of the same if you're at a distance
23:08
and they were tasked to find the most
23:09
boring font available to them so it
23:10
wasn't distracting for trying
23:12
to go with and it's called motorist font
23:15
that does sound boring to be fair i like
23:18
the way that
23:19
before they standardized it they would
23:21
have weird like signs
23:23
there was the sign for schools used to
23:25
be
23:26
a flaming torch of knowledge
23:29
brilliant i want to live in a country
23:30
where those are the symbols it's great
23:32
isn't it but yeah imagine driving up the
23:33
road and you see a flaming torch new
23:35
school is not the first place you think
23:37
danger fire turn around i mean actually
23:40
that's called liberty
23:41
straight ahead the sign for schools now
23:44
the
23:44
girl in that picture is or children
23:46
crossing is based on that
23:48
the woman margaret who standardized the
23:49
schools which i don't know how it's
23:50
based on her because it's the most
23:51
generic
23:52
girl picture ever yeah and the sign for
23:54
farm animals is based on her family cow
23:56
which was called patience
23:57
so now we know that the cow on those
23:59
farm signs is called patience
24:01
wonderful um alex have you got anything
24:03
to add
24:05
yes a couple of things very quickly um
24:06
it was eugene schieffen
24:08
shiflin in uh 1890 who released a load
24:11
of birds in central park they're all
24:13
mentioned in shakespeare
24:14
he let bullfinch's chaffinches
24:17
nightingales and
24:18
skylocks into the park but it was the
24:20
starlings that he uh released
24:22
um which have now grown to about
24:23
population about two billion wow massive
24:25
pests in british columbia is the second
24:26
largest produce of blueberries and they
24:28
just eat all the blueberries
24:31
it was in you only lived twice that bond
24:33
was being taught how to be japanese
24:35
and his teacher told him that someone
24:36
else's can retract their testicles but
24:37
it's as
24:38
far as i can tell a complete myth yeah
24:39
there's nothing like
24:41
artificially doing it or otherwise um
24:44
again half an hour with me and andy in a
24:45
room
24:48
[Applause]
24:50
okay time for a final fact of the show
24:53
and that is you
24:54
andy murray my fact is that there are
24:56
companies which
24:57
lasso icebergs to stop them hitting oil
25:00
rigs
25:01
that's really good how cool is that
25:02
that's very cool so when you say lasso
25:04
do they do the
25:05
cowboy thing if they just throw a rope
25:07
at it they just throw a rope and they
25:08
say yeehaw and then they brand it which
25:10
doesn't work because
25:11
it melts it melts it's not exactly
25:16
like the cowboy thing but basically a
25:18
ship circumnavigates an iceberg with a
25:20
robe yeah
25:20
what i mean so it ties it on at one
25:22
point it goes around the circumference
25:23
and then reattaches it
25:24
and just toes it now you don't have to
25:25
tow more than a few degrees off course
25:27
to ensure that it doesn't
25:28
hit an oil rig but it's really clever
25:30
and half the battle is in knowing where
25:32
ice bugs are and checking how they're
25:35
floating and so they
25:36
so they observe the sky or they observe
25:38
the sea rather from the skies
25:40
and check what's moving where if any
25:42
icebergs do need to be
25:43
moved then they call it cowboy they call
25:45
it cowboy yeah that's absolutely
25:47
that started with the titanic didn't it
25:49
was it was the fact that the iceberg
25:51
hitting the titanic led to them going we
25:53
need to monitor these things now
25:54
and they started putting in place the
25:57
system that we now have
25:58
to work out where they all are yeah the
26:00
international ice patrol which i just
26:02
really like is a name fantastic
26:03
organization yeah
26:05
yeah that's good but i like the fact
26:06
that yeah after the titanic they were
26:08
just a bunch of guys and boats were sent
26:09
out to check where icebergs were so i
26:10
assume they just kept crashing into
26:12
icebergs okay
26:12
there's one here got another one got one
26:15
you know they have a photo or two photos
26:17
that they think
26:18
potentially was the iceberg that the
26:21
titanic crashed into
26:23
it's got red paint along the side so
26:25
there's two icebergs that definitely had
26:26
pain so
26:27
the pictures were taken just for that
26:28
reason uh because they thought oh wow
26:30
how curious they didn't know that the
26:32
titanic incident had happened which
26:34
sounds weird but true the two boats it
26:36
was a german boat they had no idea
26:38
i read an amazing article on wired which
26:41
was a biography of the iceberg
26:43
that hit the titanic as much as you
26:45
could speculate they reckon it started
26:47
in greenland
26:48
basically every year there's about 15 to
26:50
30 icebergs that are carved
26:52
from the glaciers and they reckon only
26:54
about one percent of those make it
26:56
to the atlantic um and then they
26:57
gradually melt and so they eventually
26:59
disappeared so had the titanic been
27:01
going a few years later it might not
27:02
have been there at all i kind of like
27:03
the idea of the
27:04
of the iceberg then going on to live a
27:07
normal life
27:08
yeah with an ecosexual husband
27:12
well it would also have been 3 000 years
27:13
old because when it fell as snow
27:16
onto onto the arctic it will have been
27:18
packed and then
27:19
and then very slowly moved out from
27:21
that's an interesting life to have
27:22
nothing happen for 3 000 years
27:24
and then you run into the titanic yeah
27:26
yeah his mates must think he's super
27:28
cool that's the thing they were saying
27:29
it was probably born
27:31
as an iceberg roughly at the same time
27:33
as tutankhamun
27:34
right yeah i mean that's so nice that
27:36
that was happening well and then it just
27:38
found its way down to the atlantic and
27:39
eventually just
27:40
it's really really amazing i guess it
27:42
could be like um
27:43
say some sweat from tutankhamun went up
27:46
into the atmosphere it turned into snow
27:48
fell down yeah waited there for three
27:51
thousand years and then hit the titanic
27:53
so our claim is that two to come and
27:54
sunk the titanic
27:56
that should be your fact and this that
27:58
is that conspiracy remember yeah no
27:59
no but that was the big thing that there
28:00
was stuff from it's a huge
28:03
myth from back in the day that tooting
28:05
car moon's uh stuff from the howard
28:07
carter finding was on the titanic
28:09
and it was the curse that brought it
28:10
down yeah wow you guys must know that
28:13
that was one of the classic childhood
28:16
yeah like that was uh the children were
28:17
told bedtime stories dan was told
28:19
conspiracy theories
28:21
in his cradle raised in terror the thing
28:23
is dan little dan
28:24
the lizards are behind it all
28:27
sleep well it is weird to think yeah you
28:30
might have molecules
28:31
of water that were in the titanic
28:33
iceberg in you now
28:34
do you guys know about the world's
28:36
largest iceberg no no
28:38
it's about the size of jamaica about
28:41
half the size of wales
28:43
and it carved off in the year 2000 and
28:46
they think that there's probably still
28:47
bits of it that haven't melted wow
28:49
that's that was that an antarctic one uh
28:51
yeah it was called iceberg b15
28:53
catchy they don't they don't have very
28:55
creative names icebergs
28:56
like hurricanes they just they have b50
28:59
d12
29:00
d14 d12 do they rap a lot they do yeah
29:04
i was looking at oil breaks america's
29:07
third largest oil field
29:08
is la and it's completely concealed so
29:11
if most oil fields you picture like
29:13
those big pylons la is full of secret
29:15
oil rigs
29:16
so at least sort of hippifying around i
29:18
think the 1930s
29:19
and people who had built these huge oil
29:21
buildings they're disguised as normal
29:22
buildings and they're all over hollywood
29:24
and there are just buildings all over la
29:27
which look like normal concrete
29:28
buildings
29:28
and inside they're sucking up you know
29:30
hundreds of thousands of gallons of
29:31
transformers of the oil industry aren't
29:33
they
29:34
towing an iceberg yeah we've done some
29:36
computer models to see if it's
29:38
feasible to tow an iceberg from the
29:41
arctic
29:42
down to africa to give people drinking
29:44
water and they think that
29:46
you could take um an iceberg from
29:48
newfoundland uh to the northwest coast
29:50
of africa it would take
29:51
five months and would retain more than
29:53
60 percent of the icebergs mass
29:56
if it was the cheapest way it might have
29:58
been tried
29:59
there must be try it yeah it was tried
30:01
wow yeah in the second half of the 19th
30:03
century smaller icebergs were routinely
30:05
taken up to peru
30:07
for refrigeration in the brewing
30:08
business
30:10
oh from the south pole uh yes from the
30:12
side
30:13
so where do they keep them is there like
30:14
an african harbor where they just have
30:16
loads of icebergs
30:19
must look so bizarre it's not only
30:21
icebergs that we're lassoing
30:22
nasa is investing in a project to lasso
30:25
an asteroid using a robotic space lasso
30:28
lassoing an asteroid into lunar orbit to
30:30
make sure it orbits the moon so that it
30:32
hopes that by 2025
30:34
we're going to be able to use it
30:36
astronauts will be able to use it as a
30:37
way station from which to extract
30:38
consumables on the way to mars
30:40
that's so much like the worst idea i've
30:42
ever heard we've already established
30:44
that
30:45
losing the moon would solve all our
30:47
problems and now we're saying let's
30:48
bring another moon in
30:50
yeah a moon for the moon
30:54

00:11
no such thing as a fish
00:17
[Applause]
00:21
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:23
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:26
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:27
covent garden
00:28
my name is dan treiber i'm sitting here
00:30
with the regular three elves andy murray
00:32
anna chazinski and james harkin and once
00:34
again we have gathered around the
00:35
microphones to share our favorite facts
00:37
from the last seven days
00:39
so again let's do it our favorite facts
00:42
james
00:43
my fact is that in 1903 a man called w
00:47
reginald bray posted himself
00:51
wow how how he stuck a stump on himself
00:55
and walked down to the post office and
00:56
said i want to be taken
00:58
to to a house which happened to be his
01:00
own house
01:01
and they took him yeah was it a slow day
01:03
for him
01:04
he finished his book didn't really know
01:06
what to do
01:07
he was um he was a bit of a wag a bit of
01:10
a practical joker
01:12
uh and one of the things he did was he
01:14
read through all of the post office
01:16
guide and worked out what the smallest
01:18
and largest things he could post were
01:20
um so he discovered that the smallest
01:22
item that he could post was 1b
01:24
and so he posted that and the largest
01:27
was an elephant but he couldn't find an
01:28
elephant so he posted himself
01:30
what year was this uh 1903 1903
01:33
it sounds like because uh there's so
01:36
many examples of
01:37
people just testing the limits of the
01:39
posting system
01:40
yeah like just a bunch of practical
01:42
jokers going how far can we push this
01:43
there was a guy
01:44
who um sent an entire building's worth
01:46
of bricks
01:48
because he was building a bank in a
01:49
different city and the cheapest way
01:51
was just to send the bricks via the post
01:54
oh my god
01:55
were they individually wrapped no i
01:57
think that's what i hoped they were it
01:58
would be a brilliant admin job for
02:00
someone wasn't it sticking the stamps on
02:01
and putting them in
02:02
yeah alex would love that yeah he would
02:04
he sent them at 40 at a time
02:06
they must have not introduced weight
02:07
limits then that must have been when
02:09
they did it by size that's where that's
02:10
when they introduced the scales
02:11
that's when they brought it in uh 200
02:13
pounds per day became the uh
02:14
the limit that they then imposed there's
02:16
a weird um history of people posting
02:18
themselves it's not just this guy
02:19
there's been a few since
02:21
a guy called mr seng i'm not sure where
02:23
he was from um
02:24
he um decided to post himself in
02:27
a sealed box and he thought it would
02:29
just be a 30 minute journey and but they
02:31
put him in the wrong pile
02:32
and he was stuck in there for three
02:35
hours
02:36
uh and he didn't make a hole in his box
02:38
so he could hardly breathe and when they
02:39
cut him out he'd passed out
02:42
and um when they interviewed him in the
02:44
newspaper afterwards he said i tried to
02:46
make a hole in the cardboard but it was
02:47
too
02:48
thick and i didn't want to spoil the
02:50
surprise by shouting
02:55
wow that was a real dedication to
02:58
a surprise but then he couldn't really
03:01
jump out and say surprise because he
03:03
passed out
03:05
and was it a good surprise or was it
03:07
like he was a burglar
03:08
and he was gonna jump out and then
03:10
ransack a house well there was a guy who
03:13
um posted himself oh what was it now
03:16
okay so
03:16
there was a guy who decided he wanted to
03:18
cross america
03:19
uh and he was called mr mckinley i don't
03:22
know what his first name was
03:23
and he decided it'd be better to go in a
03:25
box because he could charge the postage
03:28
to his company
03:29
rather than paying for the ticket which
03:30
you have to have to pay for himself
03:32
that's how i get to work every day
03:33
it's the same thing yeah sorry go on
03:36
yeah you're always arriving by second
03:37
post aren't you
03:38
[Laughter]
03:40
all snapped i want my by far the latest
03:45
of these
03:46
um so he built the 550 freight charge to
03:49
his employer and climbed into the crate
03:51
of course by being in a plane he was
03:53
lucky he was in a plane which was
03:55
like air conditioning stuff but a lot of
03:56
them is very dangerous because they're
03:58
you know it's very cold in there do you
04:01
know you used to be able to send
04:02
children by post really yeah
04:05
did you used to be able to pose children
04:07
around the place until
04:08
1920 was it in the us anyway yeah i
04:11
think it was banned officially until
04:13
around then but you would
04:14
buy the stamps and you would put the
04:17
stamps on
04:18
the child's jacket and then the child
04:19
would sit in for example the mail van
04:21
of the train yeah and they were a bit of
04:23
post and you could i think you could
04:25
lump all your posts together because
04:26
there are pictures of children with
04:28
posts strapped to them
04:30
and then they turn up and be like not
04:31
only
04:33
just going back to w reginald bray oh
04:36
yeah he has his own website which i
04:38
didn't know he's
04:38
amazing yeah but there the website is
04:41
absolutely fantastic
04:42
um he collected a lot of autographs so
04:44
he he
04:45
sent thousands of cards out to people
04:47
asking them to be returned autographed
04:49
to the
04:49
to the pope or his local railway station
04:51
master um and on the website it has this
04:53
lovely line which is
04:54
over the years reginald amassed over 15
04:56
000 autographs declaring himself the
04:58
autograph king
04:59
a title that was undisputed by his peers
05:05
just imagine him saying anyone going to
05:07
challenge me
05:10
imagine you were like his pretender i
05:12
think you wouldn't tell him that you had
05:13
all these autographs and then you go up
05:15
to him and go excuse me you the guy
05:16
who's got the most autographs in the
05:18
world
05:19
would you mind just signing and then
05:21
when he signed it yeah you have one over
05:24
him
05:24
oh that's good that's very cool yeah the
05:27
ignoble people mark abrahams and the
05:29
improbable people
05:30
they um tried to send a helium balloon
05:32
through the post
05:34
and they wrote the address on the
05:35
balloon and then took it to the post
05:37
office and
05:38
when they weighed it obviously it has
05:39
negative weight and so they were like
05:41
well we're not going to pay you postage
05:43
i think you should pay us
05:45
[Laughter]
05:46
the balloon was refused reasons given
05:49
transportation of helium
05:51
and not wrapped so i don't think you're
05:53
not allowed to transport helium
05:55
oh explosive i mean that was around they
05:57
were wrapping helium
05:58
in a balloon that's true yeah so one of
06:02
the most common
06:03
um questions that gets us to the u.s
06:05
postal system is
06:06
can you mail a dog um they get this
06:09
question all the time says
06:11
um spokesperson sue brennan the answer
06:13
is no
06:14
can't mail a dog no the whole point of
06:17
postmen and dogs is that they don't get
06:18
along
06:19
can you imagine a dog in a sorting
06:21
office
06:21
[Laughter]
06:24
did actually they've worked out how many
06:26
for some reason they've only done this
06:27
in germany but 3 000 postmen a year
06:29
bitten by dogs in germany and 2255
06:34
pairs of trousers are torn resulting in
06:36
eight million pounds worth of medical
06:38
bills
06:38
in 2001 the german post office started
06:41
teaching dog psychology to postmen
06:43
it's just it's just a permanent ongoing
06:45
war that's what
06:48
except the postmen are not allowed to
06:49
carry weapons and dogs are
06:52
well they are weapons oh that's that's
06:55
no i mean that's like saying i was it
06:57
joel lewis who had his um
06:58
his fists um designated a weapon
07:02
this is jackie chan what was it i've
07:04
always heard about this and i've never
07:05
believed it is it true
07:06
i think when you say you've always heard
07:08
it i think it's me literally repeating
07:09
it yeah
07:10
most days jackie chan told whoopi
07:13
goldberg
07:14
and a number of others on the view that
07:16
when he's in america
07:18
he is considered his fists to be a uh
07:22
an illegal weapon do you get all of your
07:24
facts from the view
07:25
actually no i don't because they're a
07:27
bit um i remember watching an episode
07:29
where they were talking about the
07:31
possibility that the moon landings
07:32
didn't happen that it was a hoax and
07:34
whoopi goldberg was going i don't want
07:35
to like
07:36
speculate about the truth about it but
07:38
all i'm saying is you know
07:40
who was filming neil when he went down
07:41
on the ladder who was holding that
07:43
camera
07:44
i don't want to speculate it's like
07:45
whoopee do you know
07:47
whoopi goldberg got her nickname due to
07:49
her childhood flatulence
07:51
oh yeah she was a big farter yeah
07:53
whoopee yeah that's right
07:55
that's good yeah and she worked in a
07:56
morgue didn't she did she you might
07:58
mention that before putting makeup on
07:59
corpses
08:00
and then everyone when she walks in
08:01
everyone's like what's that smell yeah
08:04
a lot of people just woke up and walked
08:06
out oh god who was it did someone send a
08:08
load of wasps
08:10
um and you can make wasps go to sleep
08:13
and the pla they were set on a flight
08:15
and the flight was delayed or something
08:17
and they all woke up
08:18
you can still buy um parasitic wasps
08:20
through the post and therefore um
08:22
like pest control instead of using
08:25
pesticides you can use them
08:27
and then what do you get mailed to you
08:28
to get rid of the parasitic wasp
08:29
infestation that you've now
08:31
got um then you get a spider to catch
08:33
the fly
08:34
yeah there was always a big flaw in that
08:36
song
08:37
because cows don't eat dogs that's
08:40
very true
08:44
okay time for fact number two and that
08:47
is my fact
08:48
my fact this week is that the oldest
08:50
edible ham
08:51
has just celebrated its 112th birthday
08:54
so how do we know it's edible oh because
08:56
it's quite a famous ham it
08:59
first came to prominence when it
09:00
celebrated its 100th birthday
09:02
and uh someone has since bought it and
09:05
and i guess anytime it has a birthday
09:07
now people mention
09:08
it so i wanted to dispute this claim
09:09
because my local butcher
09:11
missed a fella best butcher in the world
09:13
you guys should all go to him
09:16
are we sponsored by mr fella now i have
09:18
been past mr fella's place in the club
09:20
market and i can confirm there is a very
09:22
old ham in the winter yeah so he claims
09:24
i think he bought it
09:25
in 1993 when it was 101.
09:29
it cost him 990 pounds but he said he
09:31
would have paid at least five grand for
09:33
it because it was so special
09:34
it is now 125 he says
09:37
and he says that's edible now when he
09:39
bought it from uh
09:41
the auctioneer that was telling enough
09:42
they said they weren't sure it was
09:43
edible but he's the butcher
09:45
he should know why is he not in the news
09:47
why is he not it hasn't been proven has
09:49
been officially verified is this like
09:51
the autograph guy
09:52
like no one else can be bothered they're
09:53
like yeah we have way older ham dude but
09:55
like we don't need the title of
09:57
world oldest house i think he's above
09:58
that yeah
10:00
wow well that's similar to the world's
10:02
tallest man who i think was certified
10:04
the word
10:05
world's tallest man and then he refused
10:08
to do the tests anymore
10:10
so they stripped him of his title and i
10:12
think there is another man who is now
10:13
officially the world's tallest man but
10:15
actually is slightly shorter than the
10:17
previous man why did he refuse to be
10:18
re-measured
10:19
he doesn't want the hassle of being the
10:22
world's tallest man
10:23
because when you're the world's tallest
10:24
man people come to see you as if you're
10:26
an attraction
10:27
i remember reading this odd fact about
10:28
the idea that
10:30
there are no children in the town um
10:33
not because he scared them away but just
10:35
because there's too much
10:36
hassle to have a super tall guy and kids
10:40
in the same town i can't remember the
10:42
exact fact but it was operation he is
10:44
the size of a you tree
10:46
[Laughter]
10:49
old things that have been eaten a german
10:52
pensioner who received a tin of american
10:54
lard 64 years ago in an aid package has
10:56
only just tasted it
10:57
after discovering that it is still
10:59
edible oh wow i just didn't want to
11:01
throw it away said hans feldmayer 87.
11:04
see that's the spirit which makes people
11:06
keep ham for
11:08
decades yeah when it's just not very
11:10
nice ham yeah in 2005 we found a 4
11:12
000 year old bowl of noodles in china
11:16
which i quite like that they're still in
11:17
the bowl and that settled the debate
11:19
because there's quite a
11:20
quite a heated debate i think between
11:22
chinese arabs and italians over who
11:25
first came up with the noodle
11:26
and that's the oldest evidence of a
11:28
noodle so china's got it at the moment
11:30
wow speaking of well-preserved food
11:33
there's obviously the kiviak the inuit
11:36
food
11:37
which is made from orcs that are
11:39
preserved in the hollowed-out body of a
11:41
seal yeah so you stuff them in there for
11:42
seven or eight months and they're
11:43
completely preserved then you get them
11:44
out and eat them apparently they're
11:45
pretty disgusting
11:46
but that's them but i do quite like the
11:49
wikipedia page
11:51
which is so it's called kiviak and at
11:53
the top of the wikipedia page it says
11:55
not to be confused with kiviak
11:58
person so sometimes i think wikipedia
12:00
goes overboard with their clarifications
12:02
there
12:02
i don't think anyone's looked up their
12:04
mate kiviak and can't hey
12:06
you never told me you uh food stuff that
12:08
gets preserved in a seal skin
12:10
for eight months isn't there a thing
12:11
with camels whereby
12:13
if you have poisonous water you get the
12:15
camel to drink it
12:16
um and then it vomits it back up and
12:18
that makes it um
12:20
drinkable have you ever heard about this
12:22
i have not heard
12:27
because it filters it there's something
12:29
about it's a
12:30
poisonous food or it's water or this
12:32
website i'm getting is
12:34
six dangerous urban survival myths about
12:37
water
12:40
actually i'm reading this page now and
12:42
it doesn't mention dan's
12:44
insane camel theory wow this is really
12:46
interesting you shouldn't necessarily
12:48
cut open those big barrel cacti
12:50
um the odds are the inside will be tough
12:52
and fibrous the water contained will not
12:54
be abundant and also there's a greater
12:55
chance the water inside will be bitter
12:57
and acidic which could induce vomiting
12:59
diarrhoea and cramp
13:00
oh well at least if you vomit it someone
13:01
else could drink it
13:05
imagine having a magic vomiting camel
13:07
which could purify anything
13:11
yeah i think i've got it wrong somewhere
13:12
i think it's i think it's to do with
13:14
food
13:14
google food camel vomit survival
13:19
if anyone knows about this camel weird
13:22
survival tip then send us a message to
13:24
schreiberland or
13:26
i read i read a thing about how um we
13:28
have been making attempts to create food
13:30
that last
13:31
longer so obviously this ham is kind of
13:33
an anomaly in that it's it's very old
13:35
and that's very notable but
13:36
in the army because they um they
13:38
obviously have to have food that's
13:40
nicely preserved but they want people to
13:42
eat well
13:42
they've been attempting to make
13:44
interesting long-lasting foods and
13:45
sandwiches is one of the big things
13:47
most soldiers apparently want sandwiches
13:49
they've currently made a sandwich which
13:51
can last for two years and not go stale
13:53
or soggy
13:54
and the people who made it are trying to
13:56
work what they're calling an immortal
13:58
peanut butter and jelly sandwich that's
13:59
the dream so we can be at war forever
14:02
great that's what they want one soldier
14:05
said they're the best two-year-old
14:06
sandwiches i've ever eaten
14:09
did you know that they fill all crisp
14:10
packets with nitrogen instead of with
14:12
oxygen
14:13
so that the crisps don't go off instead
14:15
of with air they don't put air in they
14:17
get rid of all the oxygen in the packets
14:18
to keep them fresh yeah ash was telling
14:20
me ash who is the uh
14:22
the lead singer of emperor yes who did
14:24
our theme tune um
14:26
he was saying that when sparkling water
14:28
is transported overseas
14:29
they take the bubbles out and then they
14:31
put the bubbles back in
14:33
when they reach their country
14:34
destination has no one heard this you
14:36
could
14:37
no okay if anyone listening uh can help
14:39
me out is that where still water is they
14:41
forgot to put the bubbles back yeah
14:43
that's when the bubbles have ended up in
14:45
a different country i do know that when
14:47
they make decaf coffee they
14:48
send they sell the caffeine to soft
14:52
drinks companies to put into soft drinks
14:54
isn't that amazing i would love to know
14:56
what caffeine looks like
14:57
isn't it funny how you said that and i
14:59
just accepted it and when dan said
15:02
i just immediately thought it was
15:03
rubbish it's the boy who cried wolf
15:05
writ large yeah
15:09
[Applause]
15:11
okay uh it's time to move on to fact
15:13
number three
15:14
and that is chozinski yes my fact is
15:18
that
15:18
orangutans like playing on ipads but
15:21
gorillas do not
15:22
really yeah so this actually started as
15:25
an april fool's joke
15:27
by the sun and the heading of their
15:29
article was
15:30
planet of the apps saying how gorillas
15:32
love playing angry birds
15:34
and yeah good old son always one step
15:37
ahead with the wit
15:38
and it gave the idea some guy who worked
15:40
at milwaukee county zeus read this
15:41
article and thought hey actually
15:43
apps for apes good idea and started
15:45
showing gorillas ipads
15:47
but they didn't like it because so
15:48
guerrillas are feel threatened by
15:51
uh direct eye contact and face to face
15:52
contact so they do a lot of their
15:54
interacting site in a side long way
15:56
and so that doesn't work very well with
15:57
eye pads because you can only see it
15:58
properly and then as soon as you look at
15:59
it you feel
16:00
like the birds trying to attack you and
16:02
they smash it wow right
16:04
there is a thing about gorillas and eye
16:06
contact and there was a zoo that
16:08
gave out these glasses do you remember
16:10
that um
16:11
and they were glasses with pinholes in
16:13
so you could still see them but they had
16:15
pictures of eyes looking in different
16:17
directions
16:18
and the idea was you would look at the
16:19
gorillas but the gorillas
16:21
wouldn't know that you were looking at
16:22
them yeah i think it's rotterdam zoo
16:24
isn't it
16:24
and i think it was off i might have been
16:25
after a woman got attacked by a gorilla
16:27
the only downside it seems is that so
16:29
they play on these ipads about
16:31
half an hour but if you give it to them
16:33
to hold
16:34
they have smashed quite a few in the
16:36
past so the zookeeper or the staff have
16:38
to hold the ipad while the orangutans
16:41
play on that's right i think the
16:42
bit of a hassle i think i read the
16:43
average length of an unsmashed
16:46
um ipad left alone with an orangutan is
16:48
15 seconds
16:51
that's the limit well which is actually
16:53
the battery life as well
16:56
um i really really like orangutans i
17:00
think they're brilliant
17:01
they're solitary apparently so yeah they
17:04
spend all of their time
17:05
they know their neighbors by sight but
17:07
avoid all contact with them so in that
17:08
sense not unlike londoners
17:10
[Music]
17:11
but they also make a lot of noise to
17:13
advertise their whereabouts so that they
17:14
can avoid each other is something rather
17:17
beautiful and tragic about that isn't it
17:18
just everyone going around saying here i
17:20
am don't come near me
17:21
um british they're british
17:25
they've come up with the idea of showing
17:27
orangs in other zoos
17:30
you're familiar
17:33
they don't like that andy they've come
17:35
up with the idea of showing orangutans
17:37
in other zoos
17:38
uh pictures of ranks they might like to
17:41
have sex with they might like to mate
17:42
with so that they can do breeding
17:43
programs rather than going to the hassle
17:45
of transporting
17:46
and orangutan across the country and
17:48
then to find out they actually they
17:49
don't fancy each other
17:50
but can they fancy each other throughout
17:52
the year yeah basically like tinder
17:54
i don't know yeah isn't that weird
17:56
another similarity with us
17:57
is that the it's the younger ones take
18:00
to the ipads much better than the older
18:01
ones the older ones are much more set in
18:03
their ways
18:04
same thing and orangutan was the villain
18:06
in the first ever
18:07
detective story oh what's he supposed to
18:10
be the first
18:11
murderer spoiler alert the murderer is
18:14
an orangutan
18:16
you can't say spoiler alert afterwards
18:18
can you
18:19
[Laughter]
18:21
and by the way it was hamlet's stepdad
18:25
spoiler alert um ash told me
18:28
uh oh no god
18:33
apparently dolphins when they when they
18:36
start communicating
18:38
the words that they'll use to
18:39
communicate the first word will be
18:42
their name and then the second world
18:44
word will be the action they're doing so
18:45
i'd be like
18:46
dan drinking and they all they can pick
18:48
their name as well that does sound more
18:50
familiar to me i think i have heard that
18:52
that dolphins use
18:53
their names that's how you know when
18:55
someone's about to speak on university
18:57
challenge
18:59
so dolphins would be good yeah thompson
19:02
edinburgh yeah
19:03
flipper ucla
19:08
hmm quite useful for people who forget
19:11
people's names though wouldn't that be a
19:12
great social
19:13
yes habit to say their own name before
19:15
they start speaking yeah
19:16
my life would be a lot easier so much
19:18
better yeah um under european
19:20
regulations
19:21
pigs have to be mentally stimulated
19:22
because i think pigs are quite
19:23
intelligent so they get easily bored
19:26
um so they've developed pig chase
19:29
the pig video game have you guys seen
19:30
this and you can play a video game
19:32
with a pig as a person and they have
19:34
this huge screen in their style
19:36
and there's like a glowing light on it
19:38
and you control the light and the pig
19:40
snuffles up and follows the light and
19:42
the aim is to get your finger on the
19:43
ipad to make contact with the pig's
19:45
snout
19:45
on the light and then you guide it
19:46
towards uh goal and then you score and
19:49
there's a big display of fireworks
19:50
they're very good at it apparently
19:51
that's great
19:52
i'd love to play a pig in a computer
19:53
game i might have a higher chance of
19:55
winning yeah you used to be able to play
19:56
chickens at
19:58
knots and crosses in america um they had
20:01
these machines
20:02
there was definitely one in coney island
20:04
i'm not sure where the others were but
20:05
there were a few and it was impossible
20:06
to beat them
20:07
because it's impossible to lose at nuts
20:09
and crosses if you play the right move
20:11
they were trained to always go in the
20:12
right place and so you would play these
20:14
chickens at nuts and crosses and you
20:16
could never beat them
20:17
wow so if you can't beat a chicken at
20:19
knots and crosses andy i don't fancy
20:21
your chances
20:22
playing a pig at call of duty
20:26
[Applause]
20:29
okay now it's time for a final fact of
20:31
the show and that is
20:32
andy hunter murray okay my fact is that
20:35
the 1888 encyclopedia britannica entry
20:38
for wales reads
20:40
c england does it mean a place where you
20:44
can see england
20:46
maybe um i think it's
20:49
so i i just thought this would be time
20:51
to rectify this
20:52
you know historical imbalance and poor
20:55
treatment by britannica
20:57
but james actually you found something
20:58
that that makes this more complicated
21:01
but it's not just an example of england
21:02
being totally you know anti-well sure
21:05
i've seen the assertion on a few
21:07
websites and i found the
21:08
text of the actual britannica and
21:12
um it seems like the the thing which is
21:14
entitled england is actually
21:16
about england and wales it's about south
21:17
britain in the article for england it
21:19
says legal phraseology is not quite
21:21
consistent on this head
21:23
but the more accurate description of
21:25
south britain is england and wales
21:27
rather than england only and in the
21:29
article they mention
21:31
england and wales as the whole thing
21:32
rather than just england i see
21:34
that's good in a way you know yeah so i
21:36
thought whales time for wales
21:38
i like wales they've got the world's
21:39
largest underground trampoline
21:42
oh yeah i know i really want to go it's
21:44
about the launch yeah
21:45
yeah i think it's open now i think yeah
21:47
over about two weeks ago no sorry
21:48
what oh my god it's larger than saint
21:51
paul's cathedral
21:52
and it it's a place that's already
21:54
famous because as the world's longest
21:55
zip wire
21:56
oh wow don't if we'll put photos of the
21:59
underground trampoline
22:00
up here because this is um it's
22:01
unbelievable um
22:03
james you've got a you've got a mug here
22:06
which is a
22:06
has a welsh word on it yeah the welsh uh
22:09
train
22:10
place um which is the longest um
22:13
single word train place in the uk on
22:16
anglesey yeah can you say the word
22:18
uh i can try go for it might not be spot
22:21
on
22:21
but it's something like um slam fair
22:24
pogoyngath aguero
22:35
but the thing about that is that um that
22:38
was a
22:38
manufactured name yeah it's called
22:41
slanted rpg
22:42
uh and um they added all the extra bits
22:46
i think as a
22:47
publicity stuff they wanted a record
22:48
yeah it was a very early publicity stunt
22:51
where they tried to turn themselves into
22:52
a notable town
22:54
and uh and it worked there's places
22:56
which have done that there's a place um
22:58
there's a place called oh god what's it
23:01
called hamilton
23:02
ohio which has an exclamation mark after
23:05
hamilton
23:06
yeah but they changed it they just voted
23:07
on it in the 70s just for
23:09
the exclamation mark and yeah they
23:11
hadn't just turned themselves into a
23:12
musical
23:12
no it sounds like a musical doesn't it
23:14
yeah but they they wanted um
23:16
they wanted more tourists and they
23:17
wanted more revenue from tourists so
23:18
they so they did that and it worked i
23:20
think it worked
23:20
but also that's the best they could come
23:22
up with put an exclamation mark at the
23:24
end of their name
23:25
well i mean it's cost effective isn't it
23:27
yeah i mean i went to
23:29
blah blah blah um we'll definitely get
23:31
letters for that one
23:34
say the short one i went there because
23:37
um i was in north wales and it was about
23:40
a 50 mile drive from where i was but i
23:42
just wanted to go to that place okay
23:43
okay and i bought a mug so there we go
23:47
now if everyone did that they'd sell 60
23:49
million mugs a year
23:51
so there was a town in america as well
23:54
that claimed to be the center of the
23:56
universe danny wallace did this as a
23:57
book
23:58
yeah um because it just no one else knew
24:00
where the center of the universe is
24:01
the mayor said something like um i've
24:04
spoken to a lot of physicists and
24:05
astrophysicists and they said that the
24:07
universe doesn't really have a center so
24:09
if nowhere else is claiming to have it
24:11
then i think we'll have it
24:12
and he claimed there was like a bench or
24:14
a manhole cover or something in the
24:16
middle of the town he said right this is
24:17
the center of the universe and they put
24:18
a little plaque up
24:19
amazing good good game i think that's
24:21
quite fun um
24:22
yeah uh so okay that was pretty bold of
24:25
britannica to do that
24:26
but you're saying that's a bit of a
24:28
disputed no it's not disputed it's they
24:30
definitely did do that and wales
24:31
obviously deserves its own section
24:33
in that we have a 1911 britannica in
24:35
this office and
24:36
um that has a very large section on
24:38
wales so they soon amended it
24:40
yeah i was wondering if when you said
24:42
when you told us this fact whether maybe
24:44
if you turned to england it would have
24:45
an entry that was like c
24:47
wales which did used to happen so
24:49
there's this guy's written this really
24:51
good book called
24:52
reading the oed it's by amon shea and he
24:55
read the whole oed recently
24:56
it was before it was uh re-edited in
24:59
2007
25:00
i think so you read the oed from before
25:02
that and found a bunch of hilarious
25:03
stuff
25:04
one of which was the word unpoetic for
25:06
which the entry just said
25:08
cf below and the word below was
25:10
unpoetical and it said cf above
25:12
so that was quite a good one there are
25:15
other excellent ones
25:17
so there's one that's created for the
25:19
word
25:20
dis gibbelin which is
25:24
d-i-s-g-h-i-b-e-l-l-i-n-e
25:25
and the definition is to distinguish as
25:28
a guelph
25:29
from a ghibline
25:30
[Laughter]
25:32
someone was really proud of himself for
25:33
coming up with that it sounds like leah
25:35
doesn't it that
25:36
yeah it sounds like a milf guelph a grey
25:39
whale
25:40
i'd like to
25:44
in the first edition of the encyclopedia
25:46
britannica
25:47
which is even more basic and rude than
25:49
the
25:50
the 1888 one rude isn't simple i was in
25:53
rude but the entry for woman just says
25:56
the female of man
25:57
c homo um and the entry on tobacco says
26:02
that excessive use is capable of
26:03
quotes drying up the brain to a little
26:06
black lump consisting of mere membranes
26:09
they should put that on cigarette
26:10
packets shouldn't they yeah yeah
26:13
there was a book um you know in the oed
26:15
how you have
26:16
um sources for each of the things so
26:19
it'll have
26:19
what was that word you just said it
26:22
would have disquibbling and then it
26:24
would have
26:24
um the source for for where they found
26:27
which book they found it in
26:28
there are 51 words in the oed which have
26:30
the source meanderings of memory
26:33
by someone called nightlark and no one
26:35
knows what that book is
26:37
oh do they know who nightmark is nope
26:39
that's great
26:40
just very quickly on this idea of the
26:42
mysterious um
26:44
mysterious book yeah um i i
26:47
read this story when i was looking into
26:50
stuff about posting
26:51
uh yourself across the country in 1976
26:55
so starting in 1976 residents in a small
26:57
town called circleville
26:58
in ohio population 13 000 um they
27:02
all started receiving these letters
27:05
accusing them
27:06
of various misdeeds and the letters were
27:09
just anonymous no one knew but everyone
27:11
in the town was getting them
27:12
wow and they had theories as to who was
27:15
sending them
27:15
there was a theory that it was a writer
27:17
called ron giuseppe
27:19
um who was writing them but then he
27:22
mysteriously died
27:23
but the letters continued coming to them
27:25
until the 1990s
27:26
and then they just stopped it's a bit
27:28
like i know what you did last summer
27:30
yeah and i know what you did last summer
27:31
and i know what you did last time
27:33
i don't know what they did last summer
27:34
i've never seen it i
27:36
killed someone with a car spoiler alert
27:42
so bringing it back to wales uh it does
27:45
at least get the chance to
27:46
laugh in our faces when we [ __ ] up which
27:48
we often do where wales is concerned
27:50
so street signs are quite a famous
27:52
example aren't they there was that
27:54
sign that went up in wales a couple of
27:56
years ago so there was the english
27:58
above which said something like take the
27:59
next left if you want to get to x place
28:01
and then the translation in welsh below
28:03
actually translated as i am not in the
28:05
office at the moment
28:06
send any work to be translated
28:08
[Laughter]
28:09
there's a sign between cardiff and
28:11
penarth that tells cyclists that they've
28:13
got a problem with an inflamed bladder
28:16
that's what the translation is and
28:18
there's a sign for pedestrians in
28:20
cardiff
28:21
that reads look right in english and the
28:23
welsh translation below is
28:25
look left
28:29
okay that's it that's the end of our
28:30
show those are all of our facts thanks
28:32

00:04
no such thing as a fish no seriously
00:06
it's in
00:06
the oxford dictionary of underwater life
00:10
it says it right there first paragraph
00:11
no such thing as a fish
00:18
hello welcome to another episode of no
00:20
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:22
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:24
covent garden my name is dan schreiber
00:26
i'm sitting here with james harkin anna
00:28
chazinski and
00:29
alex bell and once again we've gathered
00:31
around the microphone with our favorite
00:32
facts from the last seven days and in no
00:34
particular order here we go
00:38
okay let's start with fact number one
00:40
anna chazinski
00:41
so my fact is that alexander the great
00:44
band beards in battle
00:46
to combat beard pulling how long were
00:49
the beards
00:51
i'm not sure actually i do know they
00:52
were fashionable before that so
00:54
he actually was a proponent of beards
00:56
before one battle where
00:58
he was leading the macedonians and it
01:00
was his troops versus the persians
01:02
and the persians started grabbing his
01:05
troops
01:06
beards and pulling them off their horses
01:07
and killing them or taking them prisoner
01:09
and there's one anecdote of one of the
01:11
opposing troops grabs a guy's beard
01:12
and holds it there while he decapitates
01:14
him which is quite a useful way of
01:16
decapitating someone so yeah no beard's
01:17
in battle after that so that was that
01:19
was just one battle where half the
01:20
soldiers died
01:21
because of beerus shaving guys
01:24
going well i didn't really think it was
01:26
that bad yeah i thought it's good battle
01:27
guys
01:28
got a lot of kills in that and the thing
01:30
about alexander
01:32
um i read somewhere else that one of the
01:34
reasons he might have done it is that he
01:36
was only 20 years old at the time
01:38
and all of the um other soldiers were a
01:40
lot older than him
01:41
and one way that you showed authority if
01:43
you're older was by having a big beard
01:45
and so he didn't want these other guys
01:46
to have beards because he wanted to have
01:48
the authority over them yeah
01:49
he was really short as well wasn't he so
01:51
maybe was he
01:52
yeah so he should have made them all
01:54
sort of like stand on their knees all
01:56
the time and
01:57
limp around not good in battle another
02:00
time
02:00
where war killed beards was world war
02:03
one can people stop wearing
02:04
stop wearing beards yeah you wear a
02:05
beard don't you stop wearing beers in
02:07
world war one
02:08
because they were prone to lice which
02:10
isn't ideal in the trenches
02:13
one useful beard was the first guy who
02:15
swam from jonah groves to land's end
02:17
he grew a massive beard to protect his
02:19
face from jellyfish stings
02:21
ah smart that's clever isn't it another
02:23
useful beard
02:24
um was blackbeard's beard oh yeah i said
02:26
beer too much there
02:27
um he apparently used to adorn his beard
02:29
with slow burning fuses to make himself
02:31
look more intimidating in battle so he
02:32
decorated himself like a
02:34
big scary christmas tree so he lit his
02:36
hairy face on fire i know it's quite
02:38
dangerous isn't it he would put
02:39
fuses for dynamite and things slow
02:41
burning ones stick them in his hair and
02:43
his beard
02:44
and light them up apparently that made
02:46
him look even scarier
02:47
yeah i would i guess yeah slash easy to
02:50
spot and slightly ridiculous
02:51
slash could has a higher chance of
02:53
selling your face on facebook
02:55
then you look like an idiot beards are
02:58
really weird
02:58
aren't they they've just gone in and out
03:00
of fashion so wildly since the beginning
03:02
of civilization
03:03
like ancient rome i don't think people
03:05
were pro-biz because it was a sign of
03:06
slovenis you weren't looking after
03:08
yourself
03:08
and then other points in time they've
03:11
been a sign of manliness so i think
03:13
uh medieval times it was a sign of
03:15
virility
03:16
well there was that study recently about
03:18
um how women find beards attractive and
03:21
but only
03:21
up until a certain number of people have
03:23
beards and once you go over that number
03:25
then they don't find them attractive
03:26
anymore and apparently we opposed that
03:28
number now so wearing a beard is not
03:30
attractive anymore i think jeremy paxman
03:32
tipped the balance
03:33
did he i think he was that was a straw
03:35
that broke the camel's back
03:37
is really regretting his beard now
03:39
though because he made a big point of
03:41
the fact that you should be allowed to
03:42
have a beard on tv
03:43
and then there's the um the blf have you
03:46
heard of the blf
03:47
is it the beard liberation front yeah
03:50
i feel like what do they go around
03:53
cutting off people's beards no they're
03:54
they're
03:55
very um free that beard
03:57
[Laughter]
03:59
or just letting them loose on the moon
04:00
yeah no they want to encourage beards
04:02
they think it's one of the great sort of
04:04
like glass ceilings of
04:05
every job in the world that if you have
04:08
a beard it stops you from getting higher
04:10
in a company or getting you on tv
04:11
or they treat it as if it's like worse
04:13
than the glass ceiling for women
04:15
or or race or anything beards yeah they
04:18
said that bearded women's even worse
04:20
bearded women yeah don't get many
04:21
bearded women on panel shows do you you
04:23
don't you don't well there was the saint
04:24
willger fortis wasn't there who was
04:26
an english saint who there are paintings
04:29
of her that were mistaken for jesus for
04:30
a long time she looked exactly like
04:32
jesus she was crucified and she had this
04:34
big long beard
04:35
and actually she's just a female saint
04:36
who grew a beard do you remember that
04:38
guy who went to the darts and he looked
04:39
like jesus and he had to get kicked out
04:41
no
04:42
why was he getting it just really
04:43
quickly what happened is a few years ago
04:45
you know how darts matches get quite
04:47
rowdy
04:48
no but no they do and so there's a match
04:50
going on
04:51
and then some of the crowd who are very
04:52
drunk and having a good time
04:54
notice that one of the other members of
04:56
the crowd looked a bit like jesus
04:58
and then suddenly it spread and everyone
04:59
was going jesus
05:01
jesus to this guy and it was putting the
05:04
darts players off so much that
05:05
the guy who looked like jesus got
05:06
escorted out of the venue oh my god
05:09
that's really
05:10
unfair yeah escort the people out who
05:12
are chanting at him
05:13
i know but that was everyone yeah so it
05:15
was either just him left
05:16
or he wasn't yeah what else was left
05:19
speaking of jesus in the first
05:20
six centuries of christianity all images
05:23
of him look
05:24
like an angelic sort of roman statue
05:27
look like a god with curly blonde hair
05:30
and no facial hair at all and it was
05:33
only in about i think the 12th century
05:34
that we suddenly decided to change him
05:36
into this guy with a big long beard who
05:37
was scrawny and skinny and
05:39
um just back to women quickly with
05:41
beards um
05:42
i uh i found this great thing in the in
05:45
squire
05:45
the qi um fact database uh which
05:49
did you guys read this about the 12th
05:50
century indian scripture
05:52
the koka it's called it's in the 12th
05:54
century indian scripture um
05:56
it basically says it recommends that uh
05:59
a man should not marry a woman with a
06:02
beard
06:02
that was one of the like the main things
06:04
in the scripture but just all of the
06:05
other
06:06
you shouldn't marry redheads uh you
06:07
shouldn't marry anyone
06:09
who sighs laughs or cries at meals
06:13
any girl with inverted nipples uneven
06:16
breasts
06:16
flap ears spindle legs or who is scrawny
06:19
girls whose big toes are
06:21
disproportionately small
06:22
girls who make the ground shake when
06:24
they walk past
06:26
and my favorite any girl named after a
06:28
mountain a tree
06:29
a river or a bird someone's standards
06:33
are too high out there
06:36
it's like nice oh you know what i really
06:38
like everything about you your
06:39
non-inverted nipples your non-spindly
06:42
legs
06:42
but i'm afraid mrs thames there's
06:44
nothing i can do about it we have to
06:46
talk about your girlfriend oak tree
06:50
i'm not sure about her there was a 16th
06:52
century
06:53
um uh austrian mayor i think he was a
06:56
leader of a town
06:57
called hansteinger who's supposedly had
07:00
one of the longest beards
07:01
in history oh yeah and he he's also
07:04
famous having supposedly one of the most
07:05
ironic deaths as well which was
07:07
he died by falling down the stairs and
07:09
breaking his neck after tripping over
07:11
his beard
07:12
um he was running to attend a fire uh in
07:14
the city and
07:15
he forgot to pick up his beard and tuck
07:17
it into his breast pocket as he usually
07:18
does
07:20
so yeah he died very dangerous
07:24
dangerous things so i feel sorry for um
07:27
roman boys who used to have to their
07:29
first gr their first
07:30
first little sprouting which i imagine
07:32
for men is quite an exciting event
07:34
used to be whisked up to the temple to
07:37
devote it to the gods
07:38
which must be quite irritating you
07:39
finally see a whisker appearing on your
07:42
face
07:42
after all those years and your mom's
07:44
like all right get it off we're giving
07:46
it to the gods
07:47
i imagine there's mayans listening to
07:48
this going oh what
07:50
i see you become a man and you're taken
07:52
up there and you lose a little bit of
07:53
your hair
07:54
[Laughter]
07:56
tweezed out yeah i have my vowels
07:58
removed yeah
08:00
my son and daughter's head off
08:03
first world roman problems
08:05
[Laughter]
08:07
you know they're not allowed um the
08:09
yankees don't allow beards
08:11
for their players the baseball team the
08:13
baseball team in america new york
08:14
yankees
08:15
uh for a very long time now they've not
08:17
allowed any player
08:18
to have a beard so many players who have
08:21
said that they want to join the yankees
08:22
say
08:23
ah there's no way i'm losing my beard
08:25
that's definitely going to stay they're
08:26
just going to have to break the rule for
08:27
me and then they always backtrack like
08:29
months later when they're finally signed
08:30
they're offered like a 10. yeah yeah
08:33
exactly okay i guess i'll just lose that
08:35
beard then
08:35
that's like kind of like i think
08:36
dreadlocks were a problem for an
08:38
australian rugby union player who had
08:40
long dreadlocks and people always used
08:41
to tackle him by pulling on his
08:42
dreadlocks
08:43
and i believe the manager at one point
08:45
said you can't get rid of those guys
08:46
this is really jeopardizing our game
08:48
as a nazi rules player this is going
08:50
completely off topic now but he
08:52
um so i don't really know the rules of
08:54
aussie rules very well but
08:55
you catch the ball a lot you jump up and
08:57
catch the ball don't you yeah and
08:59
the ball was kept hitting his little
09:00
finger and he dislocated it so many
09:02
times that every time he caught the ball
09:04
it would really give him pain on this
09:05
little finger
09:06
and so we had it amputated just to make
09:09
it easier just to be a better player
09:11
oh that's great devotion to the game
09:13
there was another player
09:14
but not for aussie rules but for um for
09:16
rugby league in australia
09:18
who his trick fingers as well was that
09:21
in a scrum uh he'd put his finger up
09:23
people's butts
09:24
and they would drop the ball and he
09:26
would always get the ball aside
09:27
and everyone kept complaining about it
09:29
but no one really believed it and they
09:31
finally caught him with his finger
09:33
and he got banned from the game for
09:35
quite a while brown-handed
09:40
okay uh time to move on to fact number
09:42
two
09:43
that is my fact and my fact this week is
09:45
that
09:46
psychopaths don't experience contagious
09:49
yawning
09:50
like the rest of us if if you're not a
09:54
psychopath
09:56
was that a real one or a fake one
10:00
they did this test with dogs where they
10:02
had 29 dogs
10:04
experience uh a yawn to see if they
10:06
would yawn back and 21 out of 29 dogs
10:09
yawned back and they only yawned when it
10:11
was a genuine yawn if a human just went
10:13
with their mouth open they didn't yawn
10:15
back yeah that's weird
10:16
i do think it's amazing that yawning is
10:18
contagious in the human community
10:20
in the dog community and between humans
10:22
and dogs as well yes that's
10:23
ridiculous although i wonder if a dog
10:25
makes a human yawn
10:26
yawning is so contagious that humans can
10:29
yawn
10:30
just by reading the word you're not
10:31
thinking about yawning sometimes so if
10:32
you see a dog yawning and you know it's
10:34
a young man i bet that's contagious yeah
10:36
basically anyone listening to this
10:37
podcast now is probably yawning and it's
10:39
not just because of your terrible facts
10:41
wow it's dear often i think it's amazing
10:47
yawning is a mystery we don't know why
10:48
we yawn there are over 20 scientific
10:50
theories for why we yawn and none of
10:52
them is agreed upon
10:54
yeah i think that's fascinating that's
10:55
amazing really weird now the latest
10:57
theory is that it cools your brain
10:59
so you're warning it gets sucks in so
11:01
you yield more in winter because you
11:02
suck in the cool air and it goes through
11:04
your nasal tissue and
11:05
through your throat and it's when your
11:06
brain's too hot the ancient greeks
11:08
thought that it was your soul trying to
11:09
escape that's why you're supposed to put
11:10
your hand over your mouth
11:11
really they thought your soul would
11:13
escape when you were sneezing as well in
11:15
fact people that's why they say bless
11:16
you isn't it
11:17
yeah yeah that makes more sense to me
11:18
because you're pushing it out i would
11:20
have thought
11:20
you're sucking it in it just sounds like
11:22
people thought they had this soul inside
11:23
them that was just trying to get out in
11:25
any way
11:25
possible did you
11:29
but also if you failed to put your hand
11:31
in front of your mouth and you
11:33
uh sneezed did they just consider you
11:35
someone who then lost their soul
11:37
good one [ __ ] your soul's gone down
11:39
and the rest of their life was just
11:41
the rest of your life you're waiting for
11:42
someone else to sneeze and you put your
11:43
mouth
11:44
right next to them i got your soul well
11:47
hey james just yawned
11:49
was that oh yeah oh my god it wasn't
11:51
that was a genuine one was that genuine
11:53
oh yeah no it wasn't it was really it
11:55
can't be he's a psychopath
11:57
yeah should we addre why is it that
11:59
psychopaths
12:00
don't yawn contagiously what do we think
12:03
because i know autistic people are much
12:05
less likely to yawn contagiously as well
12:07
but do we know why
12:08
as far as i know it's to do with empathy
12:10
and i find that a weird thing because i
12:12
didn't think that yawning was a way of
12:14
showcasing emotion to each other um so
12:17
there's a guy a neuroscientist called
12:19
james fallon and he was um he'd worked
12:22
out what people's brains look like if
12:23
there's certain types of people and he
12:24
worked out what
12:25
uh psychopaths brains look like and he
12:27
had um a a load of
12:29
different brain scans next to him and he
12:31
saw
12:32
one that definitely looked like a
12:33
psychopath and it was his own brain scan
12:35
so he worked out that he was a
12:37
psychopath himself
12:38
which is quite a cool thing and then did
12:40
he go on a killing spree well no
12:43
he's they did an interview with him and
12:44
then he said oh you know what i never
12:46
realized i was
12:47
a psychopath until then but then he said
12:49
i'm obnoxiously competitive
12:51
i won't let my grandchildren win games
12:54
i'm kind of an [ __ ]
12:55
and i do jerky things that piss people
12:57
off so the clues were there
13:01
all falling into place
13:05
ants uh yawn when they wake up do they
13:08
yeah
13:08
they they do something it looks like
13:09
they're yawn so they wake up and they
13:10
stretch all their legs and they
13:12
open their mouths if they want to know
13:13
that that's really cute how adorable so
13:14
it's weird how many animals do it there
13:16
was a study in 1994 and i haven't been
13:18
able to find anything subsequent to that
13:20
that's disproved it
13:21
that found that the only vertebrates
13:23
that don't yawn are giraffes
13:25
and there's um the 2011 egg nobel prize
13:28
for physiology
13:30
was won by a couple of scientists who
13:32
did a study called
13:33
no evidence of contagious yawning in the
13:35
red-footed tortoise
13:37
ah really all psychopaths if only
13:41
be afraid um it fetuses yawn in the
13:44
first trimester which i find amazing
13:45
because if you think how tiny a fetus is
13:47
is in the first three months of
13:48
pregnancy
13:49
and it's yawning already people don't
13:51
know why it's probably pretty boring in
13:52
there
13:54
there's an antidepressant called
13:56
anaphronyl one of the side effects of
13:58
which is spontaneous orgasms triggered
13:59
by yawning
14:02
so you couldn't use the excuse i'm too
14:04
tired because it would immediately be
14:05
disproved
14:06
yeah they've invented a yawn activated
14:08
coffee machine which was tried out at
14:10
johannesburg airport last year i think
14:11
which
14:12
instead of paying you just had to go up
14:13
to it and it has a facial recognition
14:15
thing and if you
14:16
genuinely yawned then it gives you some
14:18
coffee oh but then surely if
14:20
the first person does a genuine yawn
14:22
everyone else in the queue would catch
14:23
them
14:24
yeah and they'd go out of business
14:26
immediately it's weird something that
14:28
i've experienced for years which
14:30
until uh looking into this fact i didn't
14:32
realize was a thing is that
14:33
if i do a stand-up gig i always yawn
14:35
before the gig
14:36
i always like just have this massive
14:38
yawn and i just thought that's
14:40
okay that's i don't know what that is
14:41
that must be uh me getting the
14:43
adrenaline
14:44
ready or something but it seems
14:45
counterintuitive because it makes it
14:47
seem like you're tired and people if
14:48
they see you yawning they're going oh
14:50
you're not really that bothered about
14:51
this gig no i think it's an anxiety
14:53
thing maybe it's a way of your body
14:54
really wanting more oxygen you know you
14:55
hyperventilate when you're anxious yeah
14:57
yeah i think maybe it's another way of
14:58
everybody doing that yeah they found
14:59
they found that um
15:00
olympic athletes the majority of them
15:01
will yawn before their events uh
15:04
concert violinists will yawn before uh
15:07
concerto um they even found there was a
15:09
guy in the army who
15:10
monitored um uh army special forces
15:13
jumping out of planes parachuting
15:15
and they would all yawn as they would
15:16
walk up to the door and he did a study
15:18
on it just to see if it was
15:19
it was just like a camera though they
15:21
might have been going yeah
15:24
yeah actually geronimo his real name was
15:27
um
15:27
guy aflay which means one who yawns
15:30
really easter that was a good link yeah
15:33
wow
15:33
as you crowbar around to that
15:37
i did notice on online when i googled
15:40
world's longest yawn
15:41
because i thought i bet someone's got
15:42
that record i don't think anyone does
15:44
have that record
15:45
but all of those kind of onion wannabe
15:47
websites that are trying to write
15:49
satirical
15:50
news stories that seems to be the most
15:52
popular choice of news story longest
15:54
yawn recorded as man
15:55
realizes oasis are forming again like
15:58
and they all try and oh it was a
15:59
recorded three-minute yawn that's how
16:01
boring the news of them reforming was
16:03
seems to be one recorded as another
16:05
article about the longest you want
16:06
yeah exactly someone needs to write that
16:08
one
16:09
[Applause]
16:11
okay time for fact number three and that
16:13
is james
16:14
okay my fact is the big bang was quieter
16:17
than a motorhead concert
16:21
so how loud is a motorhead concert i
16:23
don't really know what they are the
16:24
motorhead was uh and is
16:26
a um a metal band who have a very famous
16:29
lead singer
16:30
called lemmy yeah and they sung the song
16:33
the ace of spades
16:39
yeah so they apparently reach uh
16:41
regularly reach around 126 decibels
16:44
and according to an article in focus
16:47
magazine that i read the other day
16:49
the big bang was about 120 decibels
16:51
really
16:52
now i don't really understand exactly
16:54
what that means but i went on
16:55
on the internet and had a look around
16:57
and i found this website
16:59
telescope dot wordpress.com it's a blog
17:01
by um a physicist
17:03
and basically they've managed to by
17:05
looking at the uh
17:06
background radiation of the universe
17:08
they've managed to work out that there
17:09
were some sound waves there
17:10
and they managed to work out how loud
17:12
those sound waves would have been
17:14
and according to them it was about 120
17:16
decibels
17:17
and well there's no one there to hear it
17:19
yes and these sound waves
17:21
whether they'd be able to be heard by
17:22
human ears anyway i don't know but
17:24
you know i don't pretend to be able to
17:26
completely 100 understand this so i'm
17:28
gonna what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna
17:29
post a link to this guy's blog
17:31
on my twitter feed at egg shaped and
17:34
people can make their own minds up
17:36
so a blue whale which is the loudest
17:38
animal
17:39
in existence can give of a cool that's
17:42
188 decibels
17:43
so that's much louder than the big bang
17:46
and also loud enough to rupture your
17:47
eardrums if you heard it in fact isn't
17:49
it
17:49
yeah anything a bit over 100 110 120
17:53
that's going to
17:53
hurt your ears yeah yeah the subject of
17:56
concerts
17:57
apparently one of the reasons the
17:58
beatles stopped touring was because
18:00
their concerts weren't
18:01
loud enough during their 1964 tour which
18:04
was their last tour
18:05
the audience was just screamed so loudly
18:07
all the way through for the entire
18:09
evening that no one could hear the music
18:10
and the beatles came to the conclusion
18:11
that their concerts weren't about the
18:13
music anymore
18:14
and they tried all this different
18:15
equipment they still can get it to work
18:16
so they decided to stop touring that was
18:17
one of the reasons
18:18
uh bands now have monitors on stage that
18:21
play the music back to them so they can
18:22
hear
18:23
their sound levels and what they sound
18:24
like they didn't have that back then so
18:25
there was a really famous beatles gig
18:27
where they played it in a baseball
18:28
stadium
18:29
in america where it was so loud the
18:32
screaming of the fans
18:33
they couldn't hear themselves play so it
18:35
wasn't even that the fans couldn't hear
18:37
them
18:37
they couldn't hear themselves and they
18:39
were just completely out of tune the
18:40
whole
18:41
songs yeah yeah yeah the world's loudest
18:43
scream that is a british record
18:45
um it's held by a lady called jill drake
18:47
from tented
18:48
in kent oh i come from there do you yeah
18:51
oh you might have heard her
18:52
yeah um she
18:56
um set the record with 129 decibels in
18:59
the year 2000.
19:00
hang on she yelled louder than the big
19:02
bang
19:04
to be fair tinted is a pretty awful
19:06
place
19:08
and um the funny thing is that she
19:10
didn't know that she was good at
19:11
screaming
19:12
and but she was on a trip to london when
19:14
the millennium dome was there
19:15
and they just happened to be having a
19:17
shouting and screaming competition
19:19
so she's like well i'm here i'm on
19:20
holiday i might as well check and then
19:22
she did it and she found that she had a
19:23
real skill for it and now she's got the
19:25
world record
19:27
skill at screaming does it like on her
19:29
cv or something yeah how is that a skill
19:31
alicia the best in the world is
19:33
something i seem to remember that she
19:35
made the record and just beat out the
19:37
other competitor who was her twin sister
19:40
is that right yeah i'm pretty sure her
19:41
twin sister is the second loudest
19:43
screamer
19:43
her parents must have been so sick of
19:45
them yeah um
19:47
the loudest noise recorded in all the
19:49
loudest noise that we know of happening
19:50
in modern history was the eruption of
19:52
krakatoa in 1883
19:53
and it could be well it reverberated
19:56
around the world seven times i think it
19:57
could be detected on instruments going
19:59
seven times around but it could be heard
20:00
three thousand miles away
20:02
wow so it was in indonesia and it could
20:04
be heard in western australia didn't it
20:05
burst people's eardrums
20:06
like 20 miles away anyone within a 10
20:08
mile radius um their eardrums explode
20:12
that's insane yeah um i've got one
20:15
motorhead fact
20:16
which is that oh yeah they recently uh
20:18
rocked so hard at a concert that one of
20:20
the guy's head banging
20:22
uh it got got a blood clot in his brain
20:25
as a result of the like absolute just
20:27
head banging that was going on
20:29
yeah and he survived so it's now a it's
20:31
now a mark of awesomeness both to the
20:33
fan and the band that they rocked a guy
20:35
so hard that his brain
20:36
spasm gave him an aneurysm there was
20:38
that thing about um was it madness
20:40
who i think they did a thing at finsbury
20:42
park where everyone was
20:44
stumping up and down so much that they
20:45
caused an earthquake a very small
20:47
earthquake it might have been that that
20:48
was also in a in a football stadium in
20:50
america was it yeah yeah where they were
20:52
hard at the chiefs kansas city chiefs
20:55
that that happened quite recently yeah
20:57
so they triggered an actual earthquake
20:59
as in it was measured it was measured
21:08
yeah it's the moment magnitude scale now
21:10
yeah but it's pretty much
21:11
yeah yeah if anyone got any last facts
21:13
they want to chuck in
21:14
um so these guys called penzias and
21:18
wilson were awarded the nobel prize for
21:19
physics in 1978 because they detected
21:22
the cosmic fog
21:23
that's meant to be a signature of the
21:24
big bang so that's what we study to work
21:26
out what we think happened in the big
21:27
bang
21:27
and two pigeons had to die in order for
21:30
them to work this out so they had
21:31
the horn antenna to detect it and it
21:34
kept on
21:35
showing higher temperature than expected
21:38
when they were looking at this cosmic
21:39
fog
21:39
and they thought oh is it the pigeon poo
21:41
in the horn antenna so they gave the
21:43
pigeon to a pigeon
21:44
fancier and said take these pigeons away
21:46
and pigeon factory took them away
21:47
let them go so they returned to the horn
21:49
antenna
21:50
nested in there again and so they shot
21:52
the pigeons but i just think if you've
21:53
got two
21:54
physicists and you're a pigeon fancier
21:56
you go my one job
21:58
is to keep these two pigeons out of the
22:00
horn antenna while these guys try to
22:01
work out the universe
22:03
and he cocked it up yeah but what was
22:05
interesting about that was that
22:07
i thought the usually these kind of
22:09
things happen to be
22:10
um that someone thinks they've
22:12
discovered something amazing and it
22:13
turns out to be
22:14
actually the pigeon shot all over the
22:15
equipment and ruined it and that was it
22:16
was actually the other way around with
22:17
this because they thought it was the
22:18
pigeon and it turned out to be
22:19
they discovered the background cosmic
22:21
radiation of the universe they just
22:22
didn't realize it who was it i've
22:24
completely forgotten his name now but
22:25
there was a physicist who
22:26
spent years studying venus he was
22:27
looking through venus in a telescope
22:29
and he uh thought he was looking at
22:31
canals on venus and it turned out he was
22:32
actually
22:33
he actually had his telescope
22:34
incorrectly calibrated he was looking at
22:36
cataracts in his eyes and the blood
22:39
vessels rather in his eyes yeah years
22:40
and years and were studying these and
22:41
it's really sad actually because yeah
22:42
and there's maps of
22:43
venus isn't there that he drew and
22:45
actually it's a map of the inside of his
22:46
own eyeball
22:47
that's so cool have you guys heard about
22:49
the mysterious hum
22:51
it's apparently the mysterious hum going
22:52
around it's not true though is it
22:54
um well it's true that people think it
22:56
exists yeah there's a lot of people
22:57
reporting that there's this low hum
22:59
that's appearing in certain bits of the
23:01
planet and a lot of people are
23:02
experiencing it
23:03
and no one knows where the hum is coming
23:05
from is it detected on sound detecting
23:07
equipment
23:08
i don't know enough about it um
23:10
sometimes these facts are better when
23:11
you don't read into them
23:12
[Laughter]
23:14
the electromagnetic radiation of the sun
23:16
makes a noise a really interesting sound
23:18
i was going to submit it for m series
23:19
actually for music check it out if you
23:22
go on youtube
23:23
yeah musical the earth does as well
23:25
there's a there's a note there's a
23:26
definite note i think it fluctuates
23:28
um yeah basically anything that's
23:31
anything that's vibrating will
23:32
bring a noise sound the earth emits an
23:35
ear-piercing combination
23:36
of shrieks and whistles apparently and
23:39
that's just from tension
23:43
[Applause]
23:44
okay uh time to move on to our final
23:46
fact and that is
23:47
alex my fact is that pixar accidentally
23:51
deleted toy story 2 halfway through
23:52
making it
23:54
how yeah so this is a really great story
23:57
okay so
23:57
um basically everyone in pixar there
24:00
were over 100 people working on the film
24:01
at the time
24:02
and um they all had access to the the
24:05
the files at the same time that there
24:06
was no sort of protection and this was a
24:07
while ago so it was quite simple
24:09
computer systems
24:10
someone literally just typed in the
24:11
wrong command in the computer by
24:12
accident
24:13
realized that they'd accidentally told
24:15
the computer to delete the whole film
24:16
and that it was doing that
24:17
um they then quickly sent emails around
24:19
being like [ __ ] please can someone help
24:20
me i think i've just deleted my story
24:22
too
24:23
they then rang downstairs to the place
24:25
where the servers were and was
24:27
they just said unplug the machine as
24:29
quickly as you can so they did
24:30
so they turned it off and turned it on
24:31
again which is the solution to
24:32
everything
24:33
when they turned it back on they found
24:34
that nearly all of the movie had been
24:36
deleted oh my god um so
24:38
they started panicking and they started
24:40
asking everyone does anyone have any
24:41
bits of the film at home
24:43
because apparently the whole film only
24:44
shook up 10 gigabytes with the
24:46
all the information it took to make it
24:47
which was still a large amount in that
24:49
time but a 30 minute episode of the case
24:51
areas of qi is 13 gigabytes on our
24:53
server so that's
24:53
you know that's more than all of the
24:55
information to render toy story 2. wow
24:57
and um so that so they thought they'd
25:00
lost the entire film until they
25:01
remembered that
25:02
um one of their employees one of the
25:04
animators was on maternity leave
25:05
and had been given a computer to work on
25:07
from home uh which had the entire film
25:09
on and had only been backed up
25:11
two weeks ago so they drove around to
25:12
her house they wrapped up the computer
25:14
in blankets and put it in the back of a
25:16
volvo and
25:16
drove it back to pixar with the whole
25:18
film on it and it was estimated
25:20
to be worth about 100 million dollars
25:22
that computer because it had all of the
25:24
work on it was the only copy
25:25
i like the way you you specified it was
25:28
a volvo as well
25:29
yeah i know there's something about a
25:30
volvo isn't it it's just known as
25:32
the the 100 million dollar volvo because
25:34
it was just like everyone was just
25:36
holding the computer and they strapped
25:37
it in with seatbelts and they were
25:38
incredibly worried that it was all going
25:39
to be
25:39
over two miles an hour
25:42
the whole story is slightly undermined
25:44
by the fact that they finished the film
25:45
and it was all fine
25:46
and then pixar decided to start again
25:48
basically from scratch because the story
25:50
wasn't good enough so they actually got
25:51
deleted twice
25:52
yeah i love that about pixar i mean
25:54
that's such a testament to their quality
25:56
control because they just said actually
25:58
no let's start again it was their second
25:59
feature film so they already wanted to
26:01
get it right so they did redo it but
26:03
even to the point where they were
26:04
getting to the final product they
26:06
uh they were going to release it on vhs
26:08
it was going to be a director vhs they
26:10
weren't confident that it was going to
26:11
yeah they certainly weren't confident
26:13
billy crystal turned down the role of
26:15
voicing woody and he says that's the
26:16
biggest mistake he ever made in his
26:18
career
26:19
which was just a voice overall bill
26:21
murray was also approached
26:22
and he turned it well he didn't turn it
26:24
down he missed the phone call
26:26
because bill murray has a system whereby
26:27
he doesn't have an agent he has an
26:29
answer phone message
26:30
system that you can leave your requests
26:32
for him to be in your movie on
26:34
and uh he missed out on that phone call
26:36
that day he accidentally deleted it
26:38
halfway through
26:40
exactly um yeah so he would have been in
26:42
it and he says that was the big regret
26:44
of his career as well
26:45
uh pigs are great there's that i think
26:47
this might be in the next series of qi
26:48
but that lunch that the four big
26:50
cheeses that pixar had in 1994 where
26:54
so it was john lasseter pete doctor
26:56
andrew stanton and joe
26:57
rant they had one lunch and at that
27:00
lunch they came up with the
27:02
ideas and the rough storyline sketches
27:04
for a bug's life
27:06
monsters inc fining nemo and wool e
27:08
which does make you wonder what they did
27:09
for the subsequent 10 years if that's
27:12
covered in a lunch but it takes them
27:14
like six years to make
27:15
a single movie yeah and they are just
27:18
yeah like tom hanks was doing the voice
27:19
over for it
27:20
when he was filming sleepless in seattle
27:23
and that feels like that was
27:25
30 years ago even though it's something
27:26
like 20 and you know forrest gump when
27:28
he was doing forrest gump
27:30
he was still doing the voiceover for it
27:32
just doesn't feel as old as
27:34
those i read this and i i don't really
27:36
know enough about films to know if it's
27:38
true but
27:38
he was doing philadelphia at the same
27:40
time and he refused to do any toy story
27:42
but at the same time because he didn't
27:43
think he should be doing comedy voice
27:45
over while he was doing his
27:46
yes that's what i read and it was in the
27:47
period where he was doing philadelphia
27:49
and forrest gump
27:50
um and he felt like these aren't uh the
27:52
appropriate movies
27:53
so what was he worried about that he was
27:55
going to accidentally be funny in the
27:57
really serious yeah maybe in the middle
27:58
of philadelphia who might bring
28:00
out his um you're my favorite deputy
28:04
there's a snake in mine buzz lightyear
28:06
was originally called luna larry
28:08
oh better name yeah he was called luna
28:11
larry and then he had a brief period as
28:12
tempus and then morph
28:13
they went
28:17
who's the famous tony hart's little um
28:19
plasticizer
28:20
in the 70s oh really yeah
28:23
yeah maybe they found out about that
28:25
tony hart from heartbeat
28:27
um he's the guy who invented moth yeah
28:29
and he also drew
28:31
the um picture for blue peter you know
28:33
the little ship
28:34
yeah thing and um he got a one-off flat
28:37
fee of
28:38
50 pounds or something like this but if
28:40
he'd have got like just one p
28:42
for every time they used it on a badge
28:43
or on something else like that he would
28:45
be a multi-millionaire by now
28:47
that's like i read the story the other
28:48
day about the man
28:50
who designed the mcdonald's golden
28:52
arches
28:53
oh yeah have you have you any idea what
28:55
his name is
28:56
surely that's he created one of the most
28:58
iconic things yeah
28:59
ronald no it wasn't and i don't know his
29:01
name either i read it but i can't
29:03
remember it now
29:04
but um he was offered by the brothers
29:06
that he could get a flat fee
29:08
or he could have a additional royalty
29:11
for every time a new mcdonald's opened
29:12
and he said i'll do the flat fee
29:14
i can't see this going any bigger yeah
29:16
on the opposite end of the scale there's
29:17
the guy who painted the mural at
29:19
facebook when facebook had just started
29:20
and he was paid in facebook shares i
29:22
think so he's now a multi-billionaire or
29:24
something ridiculous yeah
29:26
um just heading back to toy story too
29:27
quickly what i love about this fact
29:29
is i love just hearing the behind the
29:31
scenes stories of these these kind of
29:32
disasters or early stages of things that
29:35
we've become to know and love and
29:36
i love just in animation generally i was
29:39
reading up recently about
29:40
some early disney movies and um
29:43
alice in wonderland the original early
29:46
version scripts i don't know if it was
29:47
the very first one but certainly in the
29:48
very early stages do you know who was
29:50
the author of the script for the
29:51
animation
29:52
aldous huxley really yeah he wrote a
29:54
bunch of versions of it
29:56
and then uh it just didn't make it
29:57
through into the end um and also
29:59
uh the uh the lion king was originally
30:02
called
30:03
king of the jungle it still says on all
30:05
their press uh
30:06
king of the jungle you know just in the
30:07
taglines but they dropped it because
30:08
they suddenly realized that
30:10
there are no lines in the jungle
30:12
therefore you can't
30:13
have it but it was pitch the movie was
30:15
pitched itself as
30:16
bambi in africa meets hamlet and it
30:18
became nicknamed
30:19
bamlet when they were making it it is
30:22
based on the hamlet isn't it i haven't
30:23
watched like yeah
30:24
you can see a lot of similarities when
30:26
you watch it bambi itself was going to
30:28
be
30:29
uh in the scene spoiler alert where his
30:32
mum gets shot
30:33
then it was the scene was originally
30:34
going to be bambi saw his mum get shot
30:37
and saw her being dragged away by
30:39
hunters and leaving behind a pool of
30:40
blood as the bloodied carcass was
30:42
dragged away along the meadow
30:43
and then they thought that she that's
30:44
probably disturbing enough as it is well
30:46
on top of that as well
30:47
the uh the movie who framed roger rabbit
30:50
it turned out that they were going to
30:51
make the killer of bambi's mother
30:53
the evil guy in who framed roger rabbit
30:55
and that was going to be revealed in the
30:56
movie and they decided to drop that at
30:58
the last minute we just we just recorded
31:00
the recent series the museum of
31:01
curiosity and one of the guests was
31:03
richard williams who's the head animator
31:05
can i
31:05
talk about it of course yeah okay so one
31:06
of the guests was richard williams who
31:08
was the
31:08
main animator a really big animator and
31:10
he was the main guy he basically
31:12
drew roger rabbit and jessica rabbit and
31:14
i was talking to him afterwards in the
31:15
pub
31:15
and i was asking about all of these
31:17
hidden because in roger rabbit
31:18
especially it's a it's a family film but
31:20
there are a lot of single frames where
31:21
there's some really dark stuff going on
31:22
and one of them is um jessica rabbit
31:25
falls out of a cab at one point
31:27
and um and like her skirt goes up and
31:29
you see everything and there's a big
31:30
controversy about this when they
31:31
recently re-released the film
31:32
and basically what happened was uh
31:34
richard williams um
31:36
drew her falling out and her skirt went
31:37
up a bit but you didn't it wasn't
31:38
actually explicit he didn't see anything
31:40
in the 2004 i think re-release of the
31:42
film on dvd
31:43
some new animators went in and made it
31:46
explicit and drew
31:47
some stuff there but i didn't tell
31:48
anyone and richard got the blame for it
31:50
they also they also put in that movie
31:52
there was um some graffiti on the wall
31:54
which said for a good time this is
31:55
roughly what it said for a good time
31:57
called
31:57
allison wonderland and the number that
32:00
they put underneath was
32:02
the phone number of michael eisner the
32:03
head of disney at the time
32:05
it was his actual number and they had to
32:07
subsequently take that out as well
32:09
from that movie on the subject of
32:10
pornographic broadcasting um
32:12
the comcast is a massive american
32:13
broadcasting company and they're
32:14
responsible for
32:15
loads and loads of americans watching
32:16
television and um they
32:18
they have a really bad history of
32:19
accidentally broadcasting hardcore
32:21
pornography and really inappropriate
32:22
times
32:23
so one time they did it during the super
32:25
bowl about 30 seconds
32:26
another time was on cartoon network and
32:29
the third one was on the disney channel
32:30
they just accidentally replaced programs
32:32
with pornographic hardcore
32:34
wow i was looking at sort of that you
32:37
know tiny technical mistakes that
32:39
could have had huge repercussions like
32:41
the fact that last year
32:43
there was a typo in a sign outside of
32:46
the oregon teacher standards and
32:48
practices commission
32:49
and the sign read oregon teacher
32:51
standards and
32:52
practices commission without a d right
32:54
so just a d missing
32:56
and a guy got so angry about this that
32:58
he resolved to explode it with a
33:00
pressure cooker bomb
33:01
and so he marched in brandishing this
33:03
bomb into the teacher standards
33:04
commission and said i can't believe
33:05
there's a typo in this side it's
33:06
outrageous i'm exploding this bomb
33:07
now when to explode it the bomb didn't
33:09
explode so then he wrote furious letters
33:11
to everyone and campaigned about the
33:12
fact that the
33:13
bomb making instructions on the internet
33:15
were also riddled with typos and it was
33:17
for that reason his bomb hadn't worked
33:19
so the typo caused the crisis but then
33:22
it also
33:22
saved the crisis from happening so i
33:25
don't know whose side you're on
33:26
tiny toy story fact one of the working
33:28
titles for toy story was toys in the
33:30
hood with a zed for toys
33:31
that's good catch 22 was originally
33:34
going to be called catch 11 but it was
33:36
around the same time that um ocean's
33:38
eleven the first ocean's eleven came
33:39
out and so there was a concern that it
33:41
was going to be confused i remember it
33:43
was called catch 18 for a while yeah
33:45
they toyed with catch 18 so after they
33:47
discarded catch 11 they went for a
33:49
number of other options well so they had
33:50
a meeting like joseph heller we
33:52
could you come into the office we love
33:54
the book yeah really good uh we need a
33:55
new number for the title
33:57
yeah they're working their way up it's
33:59
like catch live no there's ocean's 11.
34:01
okay catch 12. well there's also ocean's
34:03
12.
34:04
okay
34:10

00:04
no such thing as a fish no seriously
00:06
it's in the
00:07
oxford dictionary of underwater life it
00:10
says it right there first paragraph no
00:11
such thing as a fish
00:17
[Applause]
00:19
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:21
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:24
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:25
covent garden my name is dan schreiber
00:27
i'm sitting here with three other elves
00:29
james harkin alex bell and anna
00:31
chazinski and once again we've gathered
00:33
around the microphone with our four
00:34
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:36
and here we go in no particular order
00:38
here they are
00:41
okay fact number one alex okay when he
00:43
was bored
00:44
calvin coolidge used to ring a bell to
00:46
summon his bodyguards
00:47
and then hide from them under the oval
00:49
office desk
00:51
really yup just as a joke but i mean
00:54
presumably after the first time you've
00:56
done that
00:57
or or did they have to be like parents
00:59
you're a four-year-old child
01:02
oh no yeah i wouldn't have much trust in
01:05
them if they
01:05
were continually fooled by it like every
01:07
time that would be the worst
01:08
you would fire your secret service
01:10
straight away you'd be like seriously
01:11
this is the second time you're done
01:13
yeah well actually speaking of firing
01:14
people and hiding i i found a completely
01:17
sort of slightly related fact as well
01:18
secondary fact herbert hoover
01:20
um had a really strict privacy policy to
01:22
the point where whenever he or his wife
01:25
were on the approach the white house
01:26
staff would signal to each other using
01:28
the bell system in the white house
01:30
and then hide in a cupboards or behind
01:32
bushes or something like that
01:34
because he uh he hated seeing his staff
01:36
and
01:37
really liked his privacy and they risked
01:39
being fired if they were seen so any
01:40
time he
01:41
uh came into a room they would sort of
01:43
have to scramble around and try and hide
01:44
somewhere they got so used to doing this
01:45
that when harry truman uh took over the
01:47
presidency
01:47
moved into the white house he was like
01:48
where are all my stars
01:50
herbert hoover invented hoover ball
01:53
didn't he
01:54
which was what's that is it as soon as
01:56
he gets the ball or the other player is
01:57
hiding cupboards
01:58
he just gets to walk right to the goal
02:00
line yeah he then hides under a desk
02:03
that's cool um no it was actually
02:05
invented by his doctor to keep him fit
02:07
and it's a cross between according to
02:09
the government website
02:10
tennis volleyball and medicine ball
02:12
which do you guys know what that is
02:14
medicine ball yeah it's a it's a big
02:15
bowl that you use for
02:17
exercise yeah everything so it's
02:19
basically like volleyball with an
02:20
unbelievably heavy ball about the weight
02:22
of a newborn baby
02:23
and you throw it over the net um calvin
02:25
coolidge liked to eat breakfast in bed
02:27
while having his head rubbed with
02:28
vaseline
02:30
was he bald because that is a recipe for
02:33
greasy hair
02:34
you know the guy who invented vaseline
02:36
he was uh forgotten his name
02:38
cheeseburger or something like that um
02:40
he thought that vaseline was like a big
02:43
sort of cure-all and he used to eat it
02:45
every single day and he would used to
02:46
rub it on his body all the time because
02:48
he thought it would cure him wow
02:50
illness and did it uh well he's dead
02:53
okay
02:54
so it didn't make him live forever yeah
02:56
okay so it wasn't an elixir
02:57
i can understand why he does that uh i
02:59
once went on a date and i
03:00
i couldn't find any hair gel um and my
03:03
hair was really all over the shop
03:04
if this is something about mary's story
03:06
can i stop you there
03:08
i put i put tiger balm and my god that
03:12
was the most intense sensation i've ever
03:14
had it was like putting chilis
03:16
all over my head it was just like on
03:18
fire and
03:19
my head stunk like hell i
03:22
got on the train and everyone was like
03:24
what is that is that a successful date
03:26
it was because in the end i had to admit
03:28
it i was like by the way the reason my
03:29
head
03:30
smells like this because i did tiger
03:32
bomb over my
03:33
and she said i really like the smell it
03:35
is quite a nice smell and if you have a
03:36
cold it's quite so maybe if she was a
03:38
bit blocked exactly
03:39
really helped her exam my sinuses were
03:41
incredible
03:42
my point is though is that maybe the
03:43
vaseline on his head while he's eating
03:45
kind of gives a slight kind of
03:46
like putting tabasco on you maybe that's
03:48
how he managed to get mrs coolidge
03:50
she was like i really like the smell of
03:51
vaseline yeah you thought of tiger balm
03:54
there is a thing called the coolidge
03:55
effect do you know that no
03:57
the idea is that male animals prefer to
03:59
have sex with females they've never seen
04:01
before
04:01
than females that they have seen before
04:03
and it's called the coolidge effect and
04:04
it's named after calvin coolidge
04:06
why and it's a story about um
04:09
him and his wife who were being shown
04:12
around the farm
04:13
and they got to a chicken yard and um
04:16
mrs coolidge noticed that the
04:18
male chicken was having sex a lot and
04:20
she said to the guy
04:21
you know does he do that a lot and he
04:22
said oh yeah he has sex about 12 times a
04:24
day
04:25
and she goes well you should tell that
04:26
to my husband so then the guy went to
04:28
calvin coolidge and he said
04:30
this chicken has sex 12 times a day um
04:32
and your wife told me to tell you about
04:33
it and he said oh is it the same chicken
04:35
every time that you have sex with
04:36
and this guy said no it's a different
04:38
chicken every time he said we'll tell
04:39
that to my wife then
04:40
stinking farmer named it then uh it was
04:43
named after that anecdote which i guess
04:44
probably didn't even happen
04:46
yeah but just to make this clear that is
04:47
a really cruel thing he said so he did
04:49
basically say the only reason he wants
04:50
to keep having sex is because it's not
04:52
with my wife every time
04:53
he's saying if i was to have sex 12
04:55
times a day it wouldn't be with you
04:57
yeah to be fair is a pretty snaggy move
04:59
on her part
05:00
no one comes across well in that
05:02
anecdote at all apart from the chicken
05:04
[Laughter]
05:06
do you know i only found this out the
05:07
other day a weird number of presidents
05:09
have won
05:10
grammy awards for spoken word albums
05:13
really so i stumbled upon this because
05:15
hillary clinton did a spoken word album
05:16
which was a
05:17
uh some kind of you know telling us how
05:20
we should live better
05:21
album in the 90s obama's won two grammys
05:24
oh dream spoken words
05:25
for his autobiographies oh they are well
05:27
spoken yeah
05:29
that's true um clinton's got one both
05:31
the clintons have got one jimmy carter
05:33
kennedy a president you have to be well
05:35
spoken though don't you you have to be
05:36
good at doing speeches so
05:38
yeah not that surprising it makes total
05:39
sense yeah yeah i wonder who didn't get
05:41
one
05:42
well well george bush certainly didn't
05:44
did he not yet
05:45
maybe so uh is that it's an early night
05:48
just full of presidents
05:50
just waiting and the best spoken word
05:52
we've got clinton
05:53
obama's are the only ones who were asked
05:55
to make um audio tapes it would be like
05:58
and the winner is calvin coolidge has
06:00
anyone seen calvin coolidge
06:02
[Laughter]
06:04
i want to talk about hide and seek
06:06
because we were talking about oh yes
06:07
yeah
06:08
coolidge playing hide and seek um so you
06:10
know how um refrigerators
06:12
have got this magnetic seal that keeps
06:14
them closed yeah
06:15
that's because of hide and seek in 1958
06:18
the decade up to 1958
06:20
um a load of kids had been killed
06:21
playing hide and seek and hidden inside
06:23
refrigerators
06:24
and so the new law was brought in saying
06:26
that they had to be capable of being
06:28
opened
06:28
with a 15 pound push from inside and as
06:32
soon as that law came in they had to
06:33
come up with a way of
06:34
making sure they stayed closed um but
06:36
were able to be open from the inside and
06:38
that's where they might
06:39
push because previous to that would it
06:41
lock and then well they used to have
06:43
latches
06:44
so the kid would be stuck inside yeah
06:45
okay that's interesting uh
06:48
because i only found out recently that
06:50
in back to the future
06:52
the time machine was originally supposed
06:54
to be a fridge
06:55
and the reason it was changed was
06:56
because of a fear that kids would start
06:58
trying to imitate them and locking
06:59
themselves in fridges yeah
07:01
should we wrap up on this one it feels
07:03
like uh no go go i
07:04
was just looking at um things well
07:06
hobbies of presidents which quite good
07:08
and related to hide and seek
07:09
so woodrow wilson made his secret
07:12
service staff
07:13
paint his golf balls black in winter
07:15
didn't he so that he could still see
07:17
them in the snow
07:18
but in more humorous news one of
07:20
einstein's favorite hobbies was sailing
07:22
and he loved to sail even though he
07:24
couldn't swim and refused to wear a life
07:26
jacket
07:26
and at one point in his life he had to
07:28
be pulled from the water by a teenager
07:30
who heard him crying out for help and
07:31
pulled einstein out of the water
07:32
and the teenagers just disappeared so no
07:34
one knows who that teenager was but
07:35
einstein's life saved by by a teenager
07:38
uh but bizarrely this year there's a
07:40
fish called einstein in blackpool
07:42
and it got a bladder infection which
07:43
meant that it stopped being able to swim
07:45
and just sank to the bottom
07:46
and so the guy in blackpool has designed
07:48
a tiny fish lifejacket which the fish
07:50
now uses to swim in
07:52
so unlike einstein this poor einstein
07:55
fish has been forced into a life jacket
07:56
and given the chance to swim
07:58
again i just think that's a really weird
07:59
mirroring of the real einstein's life
08:03
[Applause]
08:04
okay time for fact number two and that's
08:06
my facts my fact this week is that until
08:08
2011 the sun
08:10
was only in theory a sphere but it's now
08:13
confirmed
08:14
to be a sphere oh yeah have you
08:16
confirmed that nasa confirmed it
08:18
they yes how did they do that so nasa uh
08:20
basically and this was a headline that
08:21
appeared on nasa's official website
08:24
uh on february the 6th 2011 it said it's
08:26
official
08:27
the sun is a sphere and the idea was
08:30
that nasa had two twins stereo probes
08:32
they were called stereo
08:33
and they went to either side of the sun
08:35
and took the first 3d photo
08:37
basically they got to the dark side of
08:38
the sun as it were yeah they got to the
08:40
side that we never see yeah it's not
08:42
dark as such though no in but just in
08:44
terms of uh
08:45
uh badly chosen words it's uh it's the
08:48
darkest it's
08:48
amazing if they got to the other side
08:50
and it turned out to be dark yeah it
08:52
would be amazing or flat or a hologram
08:54
something awesome but anyway i just find
08:55
that amazing i find that we've gone all
08:56
this time
08:57
and just assuming that scientists agree
08:59
that it's a sphere
09:00
yeah and it's probably a bit
09:01
tongue-in-cheek but i just like i just
09:03
like that that is how far scientists do
09:05
actually go
09:06
might not be might not that's what they
09:07
say yeah am i not there yeah it is
09:09
amazingly spherical yeah they don't
09:11
understand why this is the case it was
09:12
discovered only in 2012 it's the most
09:14
perfect sphere in nature by quite a long
09:16
way
09:17
and i think it's the second most perfect
09:18
sphere in the universe that we know of
09:21
and um what's the first the first are
09:23
the silicon balls that have been used as
09:25
a replacement for the kilogram
09:26
so one incredible thing is that if you
09:28
scale the sun to the size of a beach
09:30
ball
09:30
it's bulged the biggest dip and it would
09:32
be less than the width of a human hair
09:34
but even so the biggest dip on the sun
09:36
so
09:37
it's the biggest difference between its
09:39
smallest diameter and its biggest is 10
09:40
kilometers
09:41
and uh if my mass is right if you blew
09:44
up this perfect sphere that we've
09:45
created
09:46
to the size of the sun then the biggest
09:48
dip in it would be about
09:50
120 centimeters i know you always wanted
09:53
to have um
09:53
a guinness book of record record done
09:56
yes
09:56
one that you can't have is the um record
10:00
for longest time spent staring at the
10:02
sun because the guinness book of records
10:04
specifically refuses to accept entries
10:06
for that one
10:07
ah wine because it's too dangerous
10:08
because it's too dangerous
10:10
uh isaac newton used to like do
10:12
experiments where he would look at the
10:13
sun for
10:14
as long as possible and he did it one
10:17
time for so long
10:18
that he had to shut himself up in a
10:19
darkened room and wait for his site to
10:21
return and it took three days for his
10:23
site to return
10:24
not so smart not so smart
10:27
when in 1999 when there was an eclipse
10:30
um a lot of people were looking at the
10:31
sun then
10:32
and when people obviously damaged their
10:35
eyesight and they went to hospital
10:36
afterwards
10:37
the doctors could tell exactly when they
10:39
looked at the sun by looking at the
10:41
impression on the retinas so if it was
10:44
like
10:44
a halfway through the eclipse it would
10:46
have the half sickle of the
10:47
wow wow that's so cool although i don't
10:51
know how anyone's eyes got damaged then
10:52
because i remember it and it was so
10:53
cloudy
10:54
so um the original fact that we had here
10:56
was how we didn't know for sure that the
10:59
um sun was a sphere
11:00
but people were pretty certain about it
11:03
so galileo for instance he
11:05
could see the um sunspots going round
11:07
the back and coming back again and so he
11:09
postulated that it must be a sphere and
11:10
there are lots of other reasons why
11:12
we were pretty certain it was a sphere
11:15
but not a hundred percent yes exactly i
11:18
read a headline
11:19
which you guys are gonna hate
11:22
but so the people listening to this
11:24
podcast they must hear down about to say
11:26
something and then those are
11:27
all groaning and wonder why we do it and
11:29
it's you know what it's the look on his
11:30
face
11:31
as soon as he's about to say something
11:33
ridiculous he has this look as if to say
11:35
i'm a naughty boy you guys are all good
11:37
shout at me and anyway go on
11:39
okay so the world almost ended in 2012
11:43
but we survived we survived by a week
11:46
this is what happened
11:47
the sun had a ginormous solar flare in
11:50
2012
11:51
around july and it shot out into one
11:54
particular bit of space
11:56
we were a week away from the end of the
11:58
path of where it went out to
12:00
and scientists have said that if we were
12:02
in the path if we were a week ahead in
12:03
time or if it happened a week later and
12:05
we're in that path
12:06
this the size of the solar flare would
12:09
have knocked us basically back to the
12:10
dark ages
12:11
it was literally we were that close to
12:13
destruction well and if we'd just been a
12:14
bit further ahead in our rotation around
12:16
the sun yes
12:17
we would have been in its path so it's
12:18
just we just happen to not be in its
12:20
path
12:20
wow i am slightly terrified of the sun
12:22
because there is this massive risk of
12:24
coronal mass ejections just wiping out
12:25
all technology on the planet which is
12:27
just horrible idea um
12:28
there was a massive solar storm in uh
12:30
1859
12:31
which uh is the storm that has had the
12:33
biggest effect
12:34
on earth since records began on this um
12:37
and the the biggest
12:39
piece of in technological infrastructure
12:41
that existed at that point was the
12:42
telegraph network
12:43
and um they it basically all across
12:45
europe and us it basically shut down
12:47
everyone unplugged their machines but
12:49
there were sparks flying off all the
12:50
pylons and even if you turned off
12:52
the transmitters they were still sending
12:54
and receiving messages
12:55
and aurorae were seen all over the world
12:59
and
12:59
um in places like the rocky mountains it
13:01
was so bright that the gold miners
13:03
actually got up and started making
13:04
breakfast because they thought it was
13:05
daytime
13:06
wow wow really yeah
13:09
lloyd of london the insurance people um
13:11
in 2013 they did a study
13:13
uh using the data from uh from 1859
13:17
to work out how much it would cost if
13:18
that kind of thing happened today and
13:19
they estimated that in the us it could
13:21
cost up to three trillion dollars worth
13:23
of damage even if it was just that
13:24
strong
13:25
so it could go so much worse than that
13:26
very scary yeah you know um you were
13:28
just saying about these
13:29
guys who woke up in the middle of the
13:31
night because they saw the corona
13:32
earlier this week there was an
13:34
earthquake in california it was in the
13:36
um
13:36
napa valley where they make wine and
13:39
enough people around there have these
13:41
um you know these uh exercise bands
13:44
that are attached to the internet and it
13:46
can tell how how many steps you've done
13:48
every day and how your heart rate is
13:49
doing and such like that yeah and they
13:50
could work out
13:51
who had woken up at the same time as
13:54
this earthquake went off
13:55
and they found out that more than half
13:57
of the people who woke up
13:59
during the earthquake stayed up for the
14:00
rest of the night even though it went
14:02
off at 3am
14:03
oh really yeah that's just just a way
14:06
that you can take information that was
14:07
for
14:08
another thing and then work out how
14:10
humans react to something
14:11
yeah um you mentioned california and the
14:13
sun so relatedly
14:15
there's a big solar plant in california
14:17
and when birds fly over the top of it
14:18
often they catch fire because the sun's
14:20
crazy being so concentrated so then
14:22
they've called them streamers the guys
14:24
who work there and these birds fly
14:25
through and cat ignite stop
14:26
spontaneously combust mid-flight wow and
14:29
set on fire it's really sad
14:31
yeah it's very sad they must freak out
14:33
mid-flight like that's
14:34
never happened before you're on fire oh
14:37
i thank you no you're on fire
14:43
okay time for fact number three and that
14:45
is jazinski
14:47
yeah my fact is that there are some
14:49
birds nests that contain over 100 rooms
14:52
and are so heavy that they cause trees
14:53
to fall down what
14:55
yeah so these are really cool this is my
14:57
new favorite creature i think the
14:58
sociable weaver bird
15:00
which you find in southern africa in
15:02
south africa botswana places like that
15:04
and they are really sociable so they
15:06
built they build these gigantic nests
15:08
where
15:08
up to 400 birds will live in one nest
15:11
and they have loads and loads of
15:12
different chambers
15:13
and they're incredibly efficient for a
15:14
bunch of different reasons but they do
15:16
weigh an enormous amount and so trees
15:19
will collapse
15:20
yeah trees are tree recently collapsed
15:22
under their weight so they can weigh
15:24
almost a thousand kilograms which i
15:26
think is about as much as 12 adult men
15:28
so if you stick 12 adult men in a tree
15:30
it's likely sometimes the branch is
15:32
going to break and it did
15:33
the desert where most of these birds
15:35
live is obviously very hot in the
15:36
daytime and gets very cold at night
15:38
and it's insulated so that if you go
15:40
right into the middle of this nest where
15:42
they all roost together
15:43
then it's much warmer at night like more
15:45
than 10 degrees warmer than it is in the
15:47
daytime
15:47
and then in the daytime if you hang out
15:49
in the outside chambers it's more than
15:51
10 degrees cooler than it is in the
15:52
daytime because it's so well shaded
15:54
wow they have different rooms for
15:55
different things or do they have their
15:56
own rooms and stuff they all the pairs
15:58
have their own room so each room will be
15:59
a pen sometimes their offspring and then
16:02
in the center will be where they all
16:03
sleep together it's like a hotel
16:05
it really is it's incredible it is like
16:07
wow a huge and it's not just that
16:09
is it that other birds um live in there
16:12
as well
16:12
yes i saw a list of some of the other
16:14
birds who live there um they include
16:16
the familiar chat
16:20
the ashy tit and the rosy faced love
16:23
bird
16:24
ah um but yeah they do they let other
16:26
birds live in them which i think is
16:28
also great of these guys when they've
16:29
got a spare room going they say to their
16:31
mates hey you can be asked to build a
16:32
nest
16:33
don't worry so they're like a hostel
16:34
yeah it's like airbnb
16:36
yeah exactly badgers do that as well
16:38
don't they do they yeah because badgers
16:40
have sort of like a very similar to a
16:41
rabbit hole but it's because rabbits
16:43
only let rabbits in but badges are like
16:45
if they see a rabbit they'll be like
16:46
come on in mate
16:47
yeah and they let them live with them
16:48
yeah are you sure this isn't um
16:50
watership down or it might might be wind
16:53
in the wilderness
16:54
yeah they all wear tweed right um
16:57
prairie dogs we've done on qi as well
16:59
quite responsively and they're quite
17:00
similar to these birds and i also like
17:02
them for it aren't they because they
17:03
they have enormous boroughs prairie
17:05
towns i think they're called
17:06
so uh they're smaller than they used to
17:08
be because they're now more in danger
17:09
but in 1900
17:10
a prairie town was found that took up 25
17:14
000
17:14
square miles and housed 400 million
17:16
prairie dogs
17:17
but how many 400 million 400 million
17:22
are you hearing the number that's like
17:24
the population of america isn't it yeah
17:26
so you've got prairie dogs in america
17:28
that's amazing
17:30
in one house it's in it's in a book
17:34
called prairie conservation
17:35
preserving north america's most why do
17:37
they need to work on services
17:39
there's 400 million in every single
17:41
house they're doing good
17:44
but they let other animals live in their
17:46
homes as well so you get burrowing out
17:48
how is there any room come on squeeze in
17:51
let's go back to nests yeah yeah tell us
17:54
about nests
17:55
you were talking about the temperature
17:55
of the nest how it flocked yes uh i
17:57
found something great thing about
17:58
temperature unless
17:59
the sex of an alligator and some other
18:01
reptiles like lizards and turtles
18:03
is determined by how warm the nest is
18:05
that they're laid in
18:06
so for alligators if the egg is kept in
18:10
a nest at 30 degrees it turns out female
18:12
and if it's 34 degrees it turns out male
18:14
1 really yeah
18:15
so in 2009 some researchers um
18:18
found a geo falcon nest uh in the arctic
18:22
and um they did some radiocarbon dating
18:25
on it and they found that it been in use
18:28
for 2500 years so people have been
18:31
living there since the roman era
18:33
our birds had been living there i should
18:34
say
18:37
just outside get out of my house
18:40
wow that's incredible yeah dan you've
18:42
been away at the edinburgh festival yes
18:44
while you're away greg jenner came in
18:46
who was in one of our earlier podcasts
18:47
he's a historian from horrible histories
18:50
and we were talking about um a human
18:52
nest it was like
18:54
a mattress inside a cave somewhere in
18:56
africa so
18:57
this mattress was in use for 77
19:00
000 years wow 77 000 years imagine how
19:04
long that is
19:05
like 2 000 years was like when jesus was
19:08
when jesus was around
19:09
77 000 years is it still in here this
19:12
mattress
19:13
no no okay i mean we should keep the
19:15
tradition going
19:16
that's true actually yeah why do we stop
19:17
they used moss and they would put it in
19:19
this corner of a cave
19:21
and then they'd use it for a while for a
19:23
while for a while and then that they
19:24
would
19:25
burn it and put more moss on top and
19:26
then they would burn it and put more
19:28
moss on top
19:28
and this moss was particularly good
19:30
because it would stop insects from being
19:32
able to live there so it's a really good
19:33
place to sleep
19:34
but also um so you're saying it's the
19:36
exact same bed effectively
19:38
yeah because they just kept adding
19:39
different bits of the mattress yeah yeah
19:41
yeah
19:41
wow and they almost never changed the
19:43
bedding we didn't ask about it was only
19:44
about every
19:45
2000 years or something that they
19:46
bothered even changing the moss
19:48
just uh just on the subject of
19:50
mattresses i was reminded
19:52
um there's a trap door at the bottom of
19:54
the blue whale in the natural history
19:55
museum in london
19:56
um when they opened it up um they
19:59
discovered a mattress in there
20:01
um and it was basically a time capsule
20:03
inside the blue whale because
20:04
it was when they were building it's
20:06
where all the um the workmen would sneak
20:07
in so they found a bunch of magazines
20:09
and newspapers and empty
20:11
uh wrappers but also a mattress uh
20:13
because apparently
20:14
horny curators that used to be a top
20:16
location
20:17
i can't believe they went to that sort
20:19
of trouble think about it if you're if
20:21
you're someone
20:21
who works at the natural history museum
20:23
you're already quite a big dork
20:25
and so the idea of sex inside a blue
20:28
whale
20:28
yes please i mean even i think that
20:30
that's the best possibility
20:32
with the mattress i don't know why they
20:33
need the trapdoor because a blue whale's
20:35
vagina is large enough to walk through
20:37
such a good point maybe it's a male blue
20:39
whale yeah oh that's probably it i was
20:41
just going to talk really quickly about
20:43
the weaver birds just because they often
20:44
now build their nests
20:46
on telegraph poles and pylons so you'd
20:47
recognize their nests and anyway this
20:49
often causes power outages
20:51
so i was looking at animals that cause
20:52
power outages and squirrels are always
20:54
cutting off electricity
20:56
so there are some electricity companies
20:58
that say that two-thirds of their
21:00
electricity outages just come from
21:02
squirrels chewing through wire
21:03
or like linking up circuits by jumping
21:05
from one bit to another
21:06
and they've shut down the nasdaq twice i
21:09
think an estimated
21:10
20 million dollars worth of shares were
21:13
not traded
21:14
in that time
21:23
okay time for the final fact of the show
21:24
james okay my fact is
21:26
the worst baseball team in south korea
21:29
has replaced its supporters with robots
21:32
and so these guys are called the hanwha
21:33
eagles and they've lost more than 400
21:36
games in the last five years
21:38
they came bottom of the league in the
21:40
last two years and
21:41
their opposition have started calling
21:43
them the hanoi chickens because they
21:45
don't pull up any kind of fight
21:46
what they do is they have these screens
21:48
around the pitch
21:50
and you can using your computer or your
21:52
phone you can put your photo
21:54
on the screens and you can make the
21:56
screens do mexican waves or do cheers or
21:58
chants or whatever
21:59
i just think that's quite a that is cool
22:02
god that's so
22:02
sad isn't it though i mean so the
22:04
players is the idea that the players are
22:06
supposed to feel
22:07
rejuvenated at the site of automated
22:10
things which are being forced
22:11
mechanically
22:12
to cheer them on yeah thinking like that
22:15
yeah i think it's a bit demoralizing
22:17
it's solving the wrong problem
22:19
like it's the problem is the bad team
22:21
not that the fans are booing because
22:23
they suck so much
22:24
it's like do you know what we got to
22:24
solve about this our fans they're the
22:26
problems let's
22:27
invest all our money yeah futuristic
22:29
robots
22:31
to cheer as we lose again and again and
22:33
again
22:34
okay so here's another way of using your
22:36
fans maybe a slightly better way you
22:37
guys don't like the robot thing
22:39
i like the robot thing i just think it's
22:40
not solving an issue okay well um the
22:42
washington bullets had this um super fan
22:45
called robin thicker
22:47
and then what they would do with him is
22:49
they'd let him sit behind the opposing
22:51
coaches bench and they would give him a
22:54
megaphone
22:55
and he would make fun of the opposing
22:57
team by shouting at them
22:58
um so he would make fun of the coaches
23:01
outfits
23:02
or when the chicago bulls came to play
23:04
he read the sex passages of the bulls
23:06
coaches autobiography
23:08
that's him showing the game wow that was
23:12
distracting
23:13
i was looking up uh robots and death and
23:16
um
23:16
i found out that jeremy clarkson is
23:18
really killed by a robot on robot wars
23:20
apparently one of the robots was was
23:22
fighting another robot and a circular
23:23
blade came loose and zoomed across the
23:25
studio and
23:26
they had it on film and they played it
23:28
back in slow motion and it went across
23:29
his head
23:30
two inches above his scalp whoa so yeah
23:32
we actually know who the first person
23:33
would be killed by a robot
23:34
and his name was robbie williams robbie
23:37
williams yeah
23:38
how was he killed by robot it was in a
23:39
he was in a in a
23:41
calf factory or something like that and
23:43
he was in ford factory and he was hit by
23:45
a protruding arm
23:46
and he was was killed by that so it was
23:49
like because it was an arm
23:50
kind of was a robot yeah well it was it
23:53
was a big mechanical
23:54
device it was for moving car parts from
23:56
one end of the factory to the other
23:58
and it just he got hit on the head
23:59
really hard for it the second guy who
24:00
got comfortable definitely got killed by
24:02
a robot
24:02
his name was kenji radha and that was
24:04
two years later
24:05
and he got pushed into a grinding
24:07
machine by a robot arm oh
24:09
yeah like was it a militia with
24:11
malicious intent so there's never been a
24:12
malicious death
24:13
there is an innate human fear of robots
24:15
the first use of the word robot
24:17
was in a plague by czech playwright
24:19
carol capec called rossum's universal
24:21
robots and it was about robots trying to
24:23
take over and kill people
24:24
nine percent of americans when surveyed
24:26
admit that they will have sex with a
24:27
robot
24:28
or would have sex with a problem there
24:31
was that book called sex and robots
24:32
which
24:33
um it's a guy who's a huge computer
24:35
scientist and chess
24:36
champion saying that he thinks we'll
24:38
have sex with robots within 50 years
24:39
he's one of the 9
24:40
yeah definitely they did have the first
24:43
kissing robots
24:44
in 2008 they were made in taiwan and
24:46
they performed as the stars in phantom
24:48
of the opera they did an all robots cast
24:50
a phantom of the opera and these two
24:52
robots kiss and it's the worst kiss
24:54
you've ever seen
24:55
their heads come together and then they
24:56
pause for 10 seconds and their heads
24:58
pull apart it's like a 12 year old's
24:59
disco
25:00
empathetic robots are a thing that just
25:01
being experimented with and they've sort
25:03
of
25:04
are claiming they've invented where
25:06
they're robots that respond to your own
25:07
facial expressions with
25:08
matching facial expressions and they're
25:10
preparing why are you smiling
25:12
really creepily sorry okay i'm gonna
25:14
stop looking at you
25:15
so they've come up with empathetic
25:17
robots now whose face is stopping
25:19
everybody they've come up with
25:21
empathetic robots whose faces mirror the
25:22
facial expressions that humans have
25:24
in the hope that they can care for
25:27
lonely humans and
25:28
future but again a bit like the fake
25:30
cheering crowds in
25:32
korea it seems like a sad thing if you
25:33
need a robot to fake empathetic facial
25:35
expressions in order to feel okay
25:37
our buddy levin skyra uh who is on this
25:40
podcast
25:40
a few episodes ago uh just actually took
25:43
part in the opposite version of what
25:44
we're talking about which was
25:45
the world robot football oh yeah and he
25:49
went out to
25:50
uh brazil i think it was in brazil yeah
25:53
and so
25:53
uh it was robots playing against each
25:55
other at football and
25:57
levin was saying that they've projected
25:59
that within 50 years
26:00
a robot football team will be able to
26:02
beat a human football team within two
26:04
months they'll be able to beat man
26:06
united
26:07
did you see so if you've seen this down
26:09
you've been away so we're
26:10
recording this on wednesday but on
26:12
tuesday man united played against mk
26:14
dons who are
26:15
lower in the third tier of english
26:16
football and they lost four nil
26:19
whoa and there was a great thing on
26:20
twitter and there was a girl who'd
26:22
um got a free bet from a online betting
26:25
site
26:26
and she put two pound fifty on man
26:27
united to win four nil but had
26:29
accidentally
26:30
put two pound fifty on mk duns to win
26:33
four nil
26:33
at five hundred to one wow wow
26:36
i know and she was like oh my god oh my
26:38
god oh my god i've gotten over a
26:40
thousand pounds
26:41
that's right yeah anyway let's talk
26:42
about oh would you like to talk about i
26:44
was going to talk about sports fans
26:45
since we're on sports now um so i was
26:48
looking up generally sports fans one of
26:50
the amusing things i like that's
26:52
happened in the past is that
26:53
during baseball matches until about 100
26:55
years ago because the
26:57
stadia was smaller if you hit the ball
27:00
out of the stadium it would fall into
27:01
the long grass
27:02
and the game had to stop for five
27:04
minutes and everyone the fans and the
27:06
players had to
27:07
spend five minutes searching for the
27:08
ball because they wouldn't have lots of
27:10
spare balls i think now in baseball
27:11
balls just get lost and that's it they
27:13
have
27:13
they've bring spares people take them
27:15
don't they yeah well you get to if it
27:16
comes out and you catch it it's your
27:17
ball yeah
27:18
that's how it works another thing about
27:19
old baseball games where
27:21
um they didn't have as many umpires in
27:22
those days and
27:24
some of the umpires were allowed to if
27:25
they weren't quite sure about a decision
27:27
they're allowed to consult the
27:29
audience consult the crowd like he wants
27:31
to be a millionaire yeah exactly
27:33
and see what the crowd thought and then
27:35
use their ideas if they couldn't really
27:37
work it out 72 percent of the audience
27:39
thinks that that was a home run it must
27:41
have sucked when you were playing away
27:42
games
27:43
yeah he blatantly made it and he just
27:45
missed it did he make it
27:48
so i think the angriest any sports fans
27:50
have ever been and james will know about
27:52
this must be during the heidi game
27:54
is that the calvin coolidge game heidi
27:57
goseki yeah
27:59
i don't think i know about the heidi
28:00
game it's so good and it is
28:03
frequently voted the most exciting game
28:04
of american football of all time it was
28:06
oakland raiders vs new york jets and it
28:08
was really close the
28:09
new york jets were just ahead of the
28:11
oakland raiders but it was obviously a
28:12
really thrilling match it had about
28:13
three minutes left and suddenly at the
28:15
very last minute the oakland raiders
28:16
over to the new york jets and they won
28:18
and it was a massive title and it was a
28:19
massive deal
28:20
and nbc the network that was
28:22
broadcasting it as it had overrun by a
28:24
couple of minutes past its three hours
28:26
switched over automatically to show
28:28
heidi for all the kids on the other
28:29
channel
28:30
now they didn't want to do this the nbc
28:32
executive saw that it was a really
28:34
thrilling match and we're like we've got
28:35
obviously keep this on the airwaves
28:36
so they tried to call the studio to say
28:38
obviously keep the match on guys look at
28:40
this it's the biggest match ever
28:41
but so many people so many angry fans
28:44
were trying to call the studio to say
28:46
i can't believe you're going to switch
28:47
over to heidi it's outrageous i want to
28:49
watch the rest of the match
28:50
that their phone lines broke down and
28:52
the executives couldn't get through to
28:53
the studio to say keep it on
28:55
so in the great irony of fan complaints
28:59
they caused heidi to overtake the match
29:01
by calling breaking the phone lines
29:03
and heidi came on and then nbc managed
29:05
to irritate people
29:06
further i think by during this episode
29:09
of heidi
29:10
there was a really touching scene where
29:12
heidi's disabled sister i think
29:14
learns to walk and they thought what can
29:16
we do to remedy this so they flashed up
29:17
the score suddenly for the fans in the
29:19
middle of hiding
29:20
so just all these little kids suddenly
29:24
tearing up at this scene sounds like an
29:26
episode of 30 rock
29:27
um my favorite baseball player just
29:30
before we finish
29:31
uh is joe sprints okay
29:35
and he'd um one of his rivals another
29:38
baseball catcher
29:39
had caught a ball that had been dropped
29:41
from the top of a building
29:42
and he got a world record for the
29:44
highest catch
29:45
from a high point so he decided that he
29:48
wanted to beat this
29:49
record and so he got a friend to
29:53
go up into a blimp and someone was going
29:55
to drop the ball from the top of this
29:57
hot air balloon and he was going to
29:59
catch it oh my god okay
30:00
um he caught it in the way that baseball
30:02
players do with his mitt
30:04
directly above his face the ball hit his
30:06
mitt
30:07
the mitt hit his face and he fractured
30:10
his jaw
30:10
and lost five teeth and apparently he
30:13
dropped the ball
30:14
oh and someone alongside him stop
30:17
hitting yourself
30:22

=25
00:00
we run it on qi a few years ago yeah um
00:02
which was
00:03
there's no such thing as a fish and
00:04
there's no such thing as a fish no
00:05
seriously it's in
00:06
the oxford dictionary of underwater life
00:10
it says it right there first paragraph
00:11
no such thing as a fish
00:19
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:21
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:23
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:25
covent garden my name is dan schreiber
00:27
i'm sitting here with three other elves
00:29
andy murray
00:30
anna chazinski and james harkin and once
00:32
again we've gathered round the table
00:34
with our favorite facts from the last
00:35
seven days
00:36
so here we go in no particular order our
00:38
favorite things from the last week
00:44
my fact is that rats wearing polyester
00:46
pants can't get erections
00:49
how did they find this out uh so this
00:51
guy it was in 1993 and it was
00:54
uh dr ahmed shafiq and he dressed up 75
00:57
rats we just established why
00:58
he did this first yeah he wanted to see
01:00
if polyester decreases fertility science
01:03
dan
01:03
okay yeah so yeah he split them into
01:06
five groups dressed
01:07
one group up in cotton trousers or pants
01:10
dress another group having polyester
01:12
pants another group up in wool pants and
01:13
another group up in 5050 which i think
01:15
is what most people wear right right
01:17
it's like 50 cotton 50 polyester and
01:20
yeah they had to wear these pants
01:21
continuously for six months
01:22
and then he shoved them in with a load
01:24
of women
01:26
[Laughter]
01:33
sorry yeah he shoved them in with a load
01:34
of female rats and he found that the
01:37
ones wearing polyester pants try to
01:39
mount the females
01:40
and their ability to penetrate them was
01:43
significantly reduced
01:44
and the idea is synthetic fabrics are
01:46
bad for you is that it yeah actually
01:48
that's cool so that's
01:49
he said that but i think that's
01:50
controversial a lot of studies say
01:52
wearing polyester boxers might reduce
01:54
your sperm count but
01:55
how weird yeah but then i read i read
01:58
quite a good quote from a doctor saying
01:59
how come during the 70s and 80s when
02:01
everyone was wearing tight polyester
02:03
clothes
02:04
suddenly the human population didn't
02:05
decrease rapidly yeah there were a lot
02:07
of advances in other areas
02:09
as well the only work in a world where
02:11
the only variable was what kind of
02:12
fantasy childhood everyone was wearing
02:15
yeah so anyway he thinks the reason this
02:16
happens and the reason that it maybe
02:17
happens in humans but the reason that it
02:19
happens is definitely in rats
02:21
is that it creates kind of a static
02:23
electricity
02:24
around if you're wearing polyester types
02:26
so you're you've got electric genitals
02:28
you've got electric genitals yeah it's
02:29
like a great band name
02:32
and the sperm hate that okay and i found
02:34
this out in a book called bonk by mary
02:36
roach
02:37
who we love because she writes excellent
02:39
books so bonk is uh
02:40
a scientific approach to sex but it's
02:42
really well written it's really
02:43
entertaining read
02:44
i thought i when i heard the fact i read
02:46
into this guy just very quickly because
02:48
i wanted to see what kind of character
02:49
he was and
02:50
there was a great little thing that mary
02:52
roach had found out that he was
02:54
nobel prize nominated but the thing is
02:56
she checked up to see
02:57
if he was nobel nominated and the rules
03:00
of nobel
03:01
are that they don't reveal who the
03:02
nominations is until 50 years after the
03:04
nomination itself
03:05
so you can go around she's saying put
03:07
that on your resume you can go around
03:08
saying you're a nobel prize nominated
03:10
person and no one will ever know
03:11
yeah but he also uh performed the
03:14
world's first bladder transplant
03:16
he also did the same experiment on dogs
03:18
which i find so i think he might have
03:20
just really liked putting pants on on
03:21
animals
03:22
he was quite clear in the study that he
03:24
washed them every time they were soiled
03:26
rats do soil themselves a lot they
03:28
urinate almost all the time oh that's a
03:30
lot of washing then yeah
03:32
unless it was just number two's that he
03:34
was clean enough
03:35
but um so rats urinate all the time
03:38
everywhere to attract women
03:39
female rats and they also we on food to
03:42
market as edible
03:44
standard practice yeah uh females will
03:46
we on a male that they particularly like
03:48
male rats will do the same to females
03:50
young rats will we
03:51
on older rats and no one knows why they
03:53
do that and dominant males regularly wee
03:56
on their subordinates non-standard
03:58
practice no
04:00
that's a lot of weighing to be cleaning
04:01
up do they have to constantly drink
04:04
incessantly in the pub just downing
04:06
pints
04:09
so we don't know why they piss on each
04:11
other um
04:12
i think the idea is maybe that it
04:14
contains pheromones or something like
04:16
that but it
04:16
seems like such a blunt instrument to us
04:18
because we don't know about
04:20
whatever pheromones may be in it so they
04:21
probably look at us going oh these
04:22
humans they make noises with their
04:24
mouths when they're happy when they're
04:25
sad
04:26
to please people to make people angry
04:27
it's grotesque why are they marking that
04:29
urinal is edible
04:30
[Laughter]
04:33
going back to mary roach which the book
04:36
bonk which is where you got
04:37
the fact about rats and pants from um i
04:40
read it a few years ago for
04:42
i think it was in the j series and
04:43
because you have to tenuously tie
04:44
everything to the letter of the alphabet
04:46
you're studying mine was a j
04:47
for jiggy brackets jiggy
04:50
um other incredible facts from this book
04:52
bonk uh i love this one in 1851 a
04:54
gynecologist called james
04:56
platt white was expelled from the
04:57
american medical association for
04:59
inviting medical students to observe a
05:00
consenting woman giving birth
05:02
because his colleagues were so outraged
05:03
by the idea of a male doctor looking at
05:05
female genitals
05:06
i was given birth to in front of a bunch
05:08
of students really yeah
05:10
it was pretty awesome can you remember
05:12
much about it of course i can't
05:13
yeah a lot of talk about how beautiful i
05:15
was
05:16
um oh and the other the other um
05:18
two-fifths of the human penis is hidden
05:20
beneath the skin
05:21
two-fifths it's like an iceberg oh and i
05:24
think the other thing which i've
05:25
mentioned on this podcast before is
05:26
about the p
05:27
the postage stamp penis test well say it
05:29
anyway what is it
05:30
in the 20th century if if someone
05:32
couldn't get an erection it was either
05:33
going to be psychological or it was
05:35
going to be physiological so to test
05:36
whether or not it was a
05:38
purely bodily problem or whether it was
05:39
all in the mind they would attach
05:41
a strip of perforated postage stamps
05:43
around the base of the penis and then
05:44
leave you overnight
05:45
if it was a purely psychological problem
05:47
you would have an erection as you slept
05:48
and the perforations would tear
05:50
whereas if it was a physiological
05:51
problem you wouldn't and you know
05:53
you'd wake up still worst thing was when
05:55
you woke up and your penis been sent
05:56
bastable
05:57
[Laughter]
06:00
[Applause]
06:03
okay time for fact number two andrew
06:06
hunter murray
06:07
okay my fact is that during the first
06:09
world war entertainments for the troops
06:11
included uh organized pillow fights
06:14
wheelbarrow races
06:15
and wrestling on the backs of mules
06:17
sounds like fun it does sound like fun
06:19
wrestling on top of a mute like two men
06:21
on the top of a mule what i think it is
06:23
is
06:23
two men on two different mules trying to
06:25
push the other one off
06:27
like low-key jousting but i haven't
06:28
confirmed that so you may be right it
06:30
may be
06:30
maybe two men on one mule but that's
06:33
that's a lot to put on one mule yeah
06:35
yeah
06:35
um i do know you're not allowed legally
06:37
to uh ride a llama what do you mean
06:39
nobody's allowed to ride alarms just in
06:41
this country or
06:43
well uh again you test the limits of my
06:45
knowledge
06:46
we do it's really bad for them to ride
06:50
them
06:51
so they have quite weak backs and you
06:53
can load them up with a bit of weight
06:54
but
06:55
really not very much and when you look
06:56
at them they've got these lovely
06:57
vertical high necks and then
06:58
quite a dip in their backs but you can
07:00
easily see that riding them would be
07:02
quite bad for them actually yeah they'd
07:04
audience ride them everywhere they
07:05
didn't care
07:06
um anyway yes so the these were just the
07:08
various um
07:09
things that were done to keep morale up
07:11
among british troops because obviously
07:12
there's a lot of time going on between
07:14
battles
07:14
so where did these fights take place are
07:16
they in the front lines do we think
07:17
just front trench i suspect a little bit
07:19
further back yeah they probably didn't
07:21
do wheelbarrow races in no man's land
07:23
did they
07:23
just going over the top with your
07:25
pillows so sorry just so
07:27
yeah just uh this this pillow fight that
07:29
we only know about it because these are
07:30
first world war diaries which the
07:31
national archives have been digitizing
07:33
and you can go and see them like you and
07:35
you can go and look through them
07:36
they have hundreds of thousands of
07:37
documents they have a copy of the
07:39
doomsday book there
07:40
a replica of it but nonetheless it's
07:42
very cool um wow
07:43
yeah very good hey so uh pillows used to
07:46
be made of stone
07:49
lighter fight with those would you when
07:51
was this in the 70s
07:53
these are thousands of years old so the
07:54
very earliest pillows are mesopotamian
07:56
they're about 9 000 years old and
07:58
they're they're made of stone and
07:59
they're carved in a in a half moon shape
08:01
so they can support your neck
08:03
some people think that it was just to
08:04
stop insects crawling into your nose and
08:06
mouth as you slept
08:06
okay um on the day he died martin luther
08:08
king had a pillow fight few hours before
08:10
he died it was recorded in andrew
08:11
young's biography andrew young was a
08:13
really good friend of his and the three
08:14
of them were in
08:15
the memphis lorraine hotel and
08:18
yep apparently martin luther king and
08:20
another friend set up on this other guy
08:22
with pillows and
08:23
beat him that's a pillow assault yeah it
08:25
was a pillar of assault yeah it was
08:26
pillar abuse
08:27
um japan actually has issued an official
08:30
pillow for pillar fighting
08:31
oh they're really into it yeah yeah
08:33
there's an annual pillow fight day
08:35
in japan and uh and you know if a pillow
08:38
has a zip if a pillow has um
08:40
feathers that you could choke on if it's
08:41
made out of stone made out of stuff
08:44
you know there's a lot of there's a lot
08:45
of pain that can be uh brought on by a
08:47
pillow and
08:48
the safest pillow you can use for pillow
08:50
fighters they've seen them
08:52
yeah but what feathers we're not allowed
08:56
feathers anymore in a pillow fire if
08:57
feathers come out and you choke on a
08:58
feather you can die that's part of the
09:00
joy of pillow fighting
09:01
feathers everywhere peter the great of
09:02
russia used uh
09:04
used a young male orderly stomach as a
09:06
pillow when he was traveling
09:08
he would he would fall asleep and he
09:10
would wake up an hour or two later
09:11
completely refreshed
09:12
because he sometimes had uh convulsions
09:14
uh which might have been epileptic
09:16
convulsions we're not sure
09:17
but uh when when it became a proper
09:19
convulsion the only cure was to put him
09:20
in the company of someone he found
09:21
relaxing
09:22
and so when he married his second wife
09:24
it was always her or another young woman
09:25
he would just put his head in her lap
09:27
and she would stroke strokes it's like
09:29
the idea of like him going to bed with
09:30
his wife
09:31
saying night honey laying back on a man
09:37
[Laughter]
09:46
[Laughter]
09:48
if we go back to entertainment in the
09:49
first world wars because i know this is
09:50
one of your boss's favorite things andy
09:53
the wipers times have you guys ever read
09:54
the white pieces of time
09:57
uh in his lot the other boss he's not
09:59
john lloyd andy does is
10:01
moonlighting it private eye um but i
10:04
think he did a documentary on the wipers
10:05
times didn't they but they i just find
10:06
it amazing so in 1916 in the trenches
10:08
the wipers times was the trench
10:10
newspaper and it was a satirical
10:11
newspaper really funny like private eye
10:13
or the daily mash
10:14
and it happened just because it was when
10:16
they were in ipra
10:17
and they just stumbled across a printing
10:19
press that was lying around
10:21
and then they started distributing this
10:22
newspaper it would do things like uh
10:24
publish articles
10:25
apologizing for when the british shelled
10:27
their own people and
10:29
it was it's pretty subversive when you
10:31
read it yeah you think
10:32
how on earth did they get away with
10:34
printing and distributing this to normal
10:36
soldiers because
10:36
it was always sufficient given that they
10:38
had their letters checked and they
10:39
had to be read all the way through to
10:40
check they weren't saying anything
10:41
negative about the war but they were
10:43
allowed to publish this newspaper which
10:44
is extremely negative about their
10:45
experiences in the trenches it's kind of
10:47
weird
10:48
it's amazing i have one more really one
10:50
of my favorite facts about the first
10:51
world war
10:52
okay they dug a section of trench to
10:54
help
10:55
people train for life in the trenches in
10:57
blackpool um but they also took visitors
10:59
around
11:00
you could pay a penny and visit them
11:01
they were called the lose trenches and
11:02
be shown around by a soldier who was
11:04
recuperating who'd been actually at the
11:06
front in france or belgium
11:07
imagine spending all that time on the
11:08
front line in world war one
11:10
and then being sent to blackpool
11:13
allowed to say that because i'm from
11:14
lancashire the record for the
11:17
largest pillow fight ever engaged in
11:20
was set in chicago in 2013 and
11:23
involved 3 813 people but four and a
11:26
half thousand pillows which i think is
11:28
cheating
11:29
so somebody vlad too yeah i guess so oh
11:31
didn't know that was allowed
11:33
gotta check the old japanese pillow
11:34
fighting rules um just
11:36
this is pretty non-sequitur but about
11:38
world records
11:39
i just really like that thing about the
11:41
um world record custard pie
11:43
fight the record was 253
11:47
custard pies thrown in the fight
11:50
it would have been 255 but two of the
11:52
pies were mysteriously eaten
11:56
that mysterious
11:59
that's quite small for a custard pie
12:01
fight we could beat that we could do
12:02
that in the q
12:03
audience couldn't we yeah don't know how
12:05
the studio managers are going to feel
12:06
about that
12:11
okay time to move on to fact number
12:13
three and that is
12:14
james okay my fact is
12:18
that the atmosphere on venus is so hot
12:20
that if you took a pizza out of a
12:22
freezer there it would cook in
12:24
three seconds wow wow and would it cook
12:27
all the way through or would it burn on
12:29
the surface and not cook in the middle
12:31
great because yeah i imagine yeah there
12:33
would be a certain
12:34
rare quality of the inside yeah and on
12:37
the outside
12:38
yeah and this comes from um a a talk by
12:42
neil degrasse tyson
12:44
and it was about his book which was
12:45
death by black hole and other cosmic
12:47
quandaries
12:48
and he says in his book i think that it
12:50
would take either seven or nine seconds
12:53
uh but in this article about his talk um
12:55
someone corrected him and said it would
12:57
be three seconds
12:58
oh okay uh i'm not sure what the
12:59
correction was i think it might have
13:01
been to do with the pressure or
13:01
something
13:02
i like when scientists come up with
13:04
these sort of weird
13:06
analogies it is good because someone
13:08
might say to you okay
13:10
it's 800 degrees fahrenheit on venus but
13:12
what does that mean to anyone yes it's
13:14
just a number isn't it
13:15
yeah but also if it's 800 degrees
13:18
fahrenheit on venus
13:19
why are you having pizza you should have
13:21
a nice ice cream
13:23
cool lemonade yeah and if you're in a
13:25
refrigerator as well
13:26
stay in the stay in the fridge it's
13:28
boiling outside how are you powering
13:30
this fridge
13:32
okay there are there are certain
13:33
administrative problems here but
13:35
nonetheless that's what would happen in
13:36
fact fridges um
13:38
in the arctic um the chukchi i think do
13:41
this and probably in canada they do it
13:43
as well
13:44
they use um refrigerators to keep things
13:46
warm
13:47
no because if you have food outside
13:49
it'll freeze but if you put it in the
13:50
refrigerator where it's like three
13:52
degrees it'll keep it stopped do they
13:54
do they call the fridge the oven no
13:57
i'm speaking of weather on planets do
13:59
you guys know about planet hd189733b
14:04
uh so this is a planet that is 63 light
14:07
years away from us
14:08
and it rains glass sideways in 7 000
14:12
kilometers per hour wind
14:13
on this planet i wouldn't like to play
14:15
golf in that
14:16
do you know i actually tweeted this a
14:18
few days ago i think someone responded
14:19
with that exact answer
14:21
yeah it sounds like a cool place though
14:22
so it's got this deep blue hue which
14:24
they've worked out as a result of um
14:26
it's molten glass so it's silicate in
14:28
the atmosphere which is
14:29
shooting down sideways wow have you guys
14:32
heard about the mysterious light oh
14:35
venus
14:37
no daniel we haven't heard about your
14:39
mysterious lights
14:40
the ashen light it's called it's a light
14:42
that happens on the planet
14:44
that uh scientists have been studying
14:45
have no idea what it is there's a lot of
14:47
theories no one's decided what it is yet
14:49
herschel saw it uh patrick moore was a
14:51
guy called franz von grutheissen i can't
14:54
pronounce his name probably but but he
14:55
believed that it was fires
14:56
from a celebration of a new venusian
14:58
emperor being announced
15:00
all these scientists have been looking
15:01
at it over the years and we still don't
15:02
know what it is so it's a mystery and
15:04
they could be lightning
15:05
it's just a patch of light that just
15:07
comes up and i have no idea what it is
15:09
for a long time they did think that
15:10
could be life on venus because it's so
15:12
covered in
15:12
clouds it was really difficult to see
15:15
but with telescopes what was going on
15:17
under there
15:17
and so it was only when they sent probes
15:19
down that they realized actually
15:21
there's no way anything could possibly
15:22
live down here when the soviet um venera
15:25
program sent
15:26
probes down there uh the longest any of
15:28
the probes lasted was 127 minutes before
15:31
it
15:31
before they melted it melted really um
15:34
the surface of venus is hot enough to
15:35
melt an aluminium pan
15:37
so i don't know what you're serving this
15:38
pizza on
15:39
[Laughter]
15:42
hey you want to hear some stuff about
15:43
pizza oh yeah yeah
15:45
okay um this was a publicity stunt by
15:48
pizza hut in the early 2000's they
15:49
claimed that they were the first company
15:51
in the world to deliver a pizza to outer
15:52
space
15:53
uh because the company uh sent one on a
15:56
russian rocket
15:57
to the international space station and
15:59
then yuri usachov
16:01
uh one of the russian cosmonauts living
16:02
there ate it
16:04
and pizza hut paid about seven hundred
16:06
thousand quid for that so i think we can
16:07
all agree money well spent
16:08
it is now that they've got this kind of
16:10
promotion from the qi podcast
16:11
before they were wondering if anything
16:13
had happened to it yeah but they paid
16:15
all this money and with in return they
16:17
got to do that
16:18
then they got footage of mr chav
16:20
flashing a thumbs up after
16:22
eating the pizza and then for pasting
16:24
the chain's logo on a rocket last year
16:27
do you guys know about pizza hut's
16:28
proposal package no
16:30
uh so this sounds romantic it is
16:33
romantic
16:34
because ten 10 010
16:37
it was a limited edition offer in 2012
16:39
and it came with a red ruby ring
16:41
a limousine which took you to your
16:43
location of choice flowers fireworks a
16:45
photographer
16:46
and the cherry on the icing a 10 dinner
16:48
box what's a ten dollar bill it's like a
16:50
box with a pizza and some cheese sticks
16:52
um another thing that pizza hut has is
16:54
its own perfume
16:55
called ode to pizza hut it smells
16:58
apparently like a freshly opened box of
17:00
pizza although
17:01
a professional smellologist whatever
17:03
we're calling them actually said it
17:05
smells like cinnamon
17:06
baby powder and most overwhelmingly feet
17:09
they're not my favorite toppings
17:12
actually speaking of will you marry me
17:13
this is something i looked into for the
17:15
last five we were discussing
17:16
for the iceland fact but the first woman
17:19
who ever placed a personal ad in a
17:21
newspaper was immediately committed to
17:22
an asylum
17:23
oh what did it say did it say blah blah
17:26
blah
17:28
i'm going to kill everyone marry me no
17:31
she was just committed to an asylum by
17:32
the meds she placed a personal ad in the
17:35
manchester weekly journal in 1727 she
17:38
was called helen morrison
17:39
and the first person to respond was the
17:41
mayor who had locked up in an asylum for
17:42
a month
17:43
for doing something so completely insane
17:45
i don't believe
17:46
that when was the last time you're in
17:48
manchester
17:50
they're a mean bunch a few things about
17:52
weather okay
17:54
on planets the great dark spot on
17:56
neptune has winds of
17:58
1500 miles per hour if the winds
18:02
anywhere on earth for instance are more
18:04
than about 120 miles an hour it's no
18:06
longer possible to stay upright
18:08
and it's 1500 miles an hour there so 10
18:10
times
18:11
10 so you're telling us if you open an
18:13
umbrella you would fly you would fly
18:15
well you would
18:16
certainly be thrown along the floor if
18:18
not fly awesome
18:19
um also on mars the um atmosphere is so
18:22
thin
18:23
on mars and that if you stood um at the
18:26
equator at noon
18:27
it would feel like summer at your feet
18:29
and winter at your head
18:30
wow amazing crouch to eat your pizza
18:35
stand up to eat your ice cream desert
18:37
little
18:38
clouds floating around your midriff yeah
18:40
it's very thin so you wouldn't really
18:42
see
18:42
would it be like being a giant on earth
18:46
yeah maybe i'm just trying to get a
18:47
clear sense of what it would be like to
18:49
be there
18:49
i was looking at weird ways to cook
18:51
stuff okay uh because
18:53
you know pizza on venus a weird way to
18:55
cook stuff tips for other weird ways to
18:56
cook stuff if your oven's broken
18:58
poaching salmon in the dishwasher
19:00
apparently
19:01
does it work yeah yeah great wrap it in
19:03
tin foil yeah
19:05
um cook on top of your car engine you've
19:06
got to drive for about an hour in your
19:07
car for something to cook properly like
19:09
an egg but
19:10
um the other good way to cook something
19:12
uh when your oven's broken is to put it
19:13
in the middle of a compost heap
19:14
and so there's a guy who likes to do
19:16
this i was reading his blog
19:18
and it gets really hot in the middle of
19:19
compost heaps so in fact once our combo
19:21
seep in our garden
19:23
set on fire it was mental in our garden
19:25
yeah
19:26
but also composty yeah so maybe you know
19:29
wrap it in foil
19:30
again but this guy says i quote now
19:32
whenever i hanker for a real breakfast
19:34
treat
19:35
i drop a few eggs in the compost heap in
19:37
the evening and look forward to a
19:38
morning feast
19:40
are you sure when he says drop a few
19:41
eggs
19:48
okay time for the final fact of the show
19:50
and that is my fact and my
19:52
fact this week is that in iceland there
19:54
is a phone app that tells you if you're
19:56
related to the person that you're
19:57
hitting on
19:58
okay i don't usually go to frozen food
20:00
supermarkets to hit some people but
20:02
maybe you do
20:02
okay the country iceland uh they've got
20:05
a really small population over there
20:06
something like 320 000 people
20:08
so many people were accidentally finding
20:10
out you know in the bedroom chat
20:12
in the morning so like oh so what are
20:14
you up to today i'll go to my
20:15
my mom's uh my mom's barbecue oh i'm
20:18
going to a barbecue today
20:20
oh my god cousin sue yeah that's that's
20:22
how it works it's my grandmother's
20:23
birthday today oh me too
20:26
yeah so where do you live just in the
20:27
next bedroom actually weird right
20:32
yeah so uh this is this is a really
20:34
important app because they want to stop
20:35
the gene pool from becoming incestuous
20:37
and it's basically in a bar you both
20:39
have the app on your phones you bump the
20:41
phones their motto is bump phones before
20:42
you bump in the bed
20:44
and uh the idea is that then tells you
20:46
whether or not you're related
20:47
it's very clever that's great isn't the
20:49
feature the specific feature in this app
20:51
is called i'm going to mispronounce this
20:53
sifyaspezpilier which is called the
20:56
incest spoiler
20:58
yeah it's got negative connotations it
21:00
implies you're ruining something that
21:01
could have been otherwise important
21:02
experience yeah it sounds like you
21:04
wanted incest incest spoiler alert
21:06
[Laughter]
21:08
is what you would receive on your phone
21:10
it's a spoiler alert yeah
21:13
that's so good but yeah i just think
21:14
that's my what i really love most about
21:17
it other than
21:17
like it's it's a very interesting app uh
21:20
is the fact that
21:21
apps are getting to the point now where
21:23
we've just got so many options of
21:25
lifestyle choices via reading a little
21:28
app that you know my friend um
21:30
knew that she was giving birth because
21:31
her pregnancy contraction app
21:34
told her i mean you should keep her
21:36
phone you figured
21:37
out anyway yeah i don't know how that
21:38
works also in japan at the moment
21:40
there's a new app
21:41
which uh okay basically this sounds
21:43
really weird but
21:44
there's a bra now in japan that doesn't
21:47
come off
21:48
unless you truly love the person that
21:51
you're talking to
21:52
oh or that you're having a challenge
21:54
kind of like a chastity bra
21:55
and the way that it knows that you uh do
21:58
like the person
21:59
is something in the bra that monitors
22:01
your pulsating heart
22:02
your heart then sends a message to your
22:04
iphone where there is an app that
22:06
releases the bra
22:07
and then it can come off what about when
22:09
you go go to sleep at the end of the day
22:11
and you want to take your breath you
22:12
have to feign being in love
22:13
[Laughter]
22:16
and also faster heart rate what if
22:17
you're being mugged and then your bra
22:18
comes on
22:19
um those photographs on roller coasters
22:22
would be really interesting
22:24
everyone's brass
22:28
i wasn't scared that's not what you're
22:29
pressed to sing
22:33
there was an app in azerbaijan in 2013
22:36
that would tell you the results of the
22:38
election
22:39
as soon as the results came in
22:40
unfortunately anyone who downloaded it
22:42
got
22:42
um a message the day before the polls
22:45
opened saying that there was a massive
22:47
landslide for the current president
22:49
that's great wow whoopsie
22:53
there's a really good one i read about
22:54
the other day called run p and it's an
22:56
app
22:57
and the idea behind it is so you know
22:59
when you're in the cinema and you're
23:00
watching a movie
23:01
and you really need the toilet but it's
23:03
a great movie and you're going i have no
23:04
idea when i need to go
23:06
so the app is you open it up and you
23:08
type in the name of the movie that
23:09
you're watching and people have
23:11
watched the movie before have put this
23:12
into the app so if you're watching
23:13
guardians of the galaxy it will say
23:15
one hour 28 minutes in you're gonna get
23:17
to a scene that says that's like this
23:19
perfect time to go it's a boring scene
23:21
it's not needed to know the rest of the
23:22
plot
23:23
so it tells you exactly in every movie
23:25
where you need to go for repeat
23:26
that's good that's so good it's not a
23:28
great app yeah wow
23:30
okay uh incest yes should we talk about
23:33
it
23:33
for a while please um so in hawaii they
23:36
used to um
23:38
revere incest and they had a system
23:40
called
23:41
nia upo whose aim was to keep the royal
23:44
lineage
23:45
as clear as possible and the very top of
23:47
their society was a kapu
23:49
and that was a product of a royal
23:50
brother and sister and if you were
23:53
the son or daughter of a royal brother
23:55
or sister you were considered a god
23:57
partly because you had seven legs and
23:59
were blue yeah
24:01
wow weird yeah yeah so in russia china
24:05
ivory coast spain portugal and quite a
24:06
few other places it's not illegal to
24:09
commit incest um but in korea it's
24:12
really illegal
24:13
uh and um actually you cut not allowed
24:15
to marry anyone who's
24:17
uh related more closely than eighth
24:19
cousin oh my god
24:20
yeah although obviously it's difficult
24:22
to check that um
24:24
you're not allowed to knowingly do that
24:26
um but you
24:27
by law i think you have to check that
24:28
they're not second cousins in
24:30
in south korea you're not it was decreed
24:32
in 1308 that if you had the same surname
24:34
as someone else you couldn't marry them
24:36
because of this
24:36
taboo however a fifth of people in south
24:39
korea have the surname kim
24:41
so there are all these people who might
24:42
love each other very much and be very
24:43
distantly
24:44
not related at all essentially but
24:46
legally they weren't allowed to marry so
24:48
i think they've changed it now have they
24:49
a little bit yeah they have in 1997 it
24:51
was repealed
24:52
but before that every so often they
24:54
would just have an amnesty and say
24:55
okay a few ten thousand of you can get
24:57
married to each other interesting
24:58
yeah that's very yeah it is i was going
25:00
to talk about iceland does anyone have
25:02
anyone interested in iceland i love
25:04
iceland
25:04
iceland have you been to iceland go back
25:06
along uh yes i have i always think
25:08
iceland is like um a geography teacher's
25:10
best ever thing because it's got
25:12
everything like what oh my god
25:13
earthquakes and
25:14
you know tectonic plates and everything
25:16
the geezers yeah they also believe in
25:18
elves
25:19
which uh is very exciting yeah
25:21
fifty-four percent
25:22
i think fifty-four percent well yeah i
25:24
remember because i only know this
25:25
because john lloyd
25:26
uh told me this uh years ago he said
25:29
that 54
25:30
believe in it uh but if you get them
25:32
drunk uh
25:33
something like 90 percent admit that
25:35
they actually believe in it
25:37
which i really like that's right there
25:39
was quite a good comment from an
25:40
icelandic academic who was saying you
25:42
say that it's geographically fascinating
25:44
who's saying you can completely believe
25:46
if you've lived there and growing up
25:47
there the earth is so
25:48
volatile and moving all the time and
25:50
wisps of smoke shooting up out of the
25:51
ground and stuff it's kind of not
25:53
surprising that people think there are
25:54
spirits everywhere and there's a really
25:55
sweet story of
25:57
a politician an icelandic politician a
25:59
couple of years ago his cast ban off the
26:01
road
26:02
and he said that he was saved from any
26:04
injury by elves
26:06
and then a short while later they were
26:08
going to build
26:09
over the elf home and the elves lived in
26:10
a nearby boulder and so the politicians
26:12
said no you can't do that
26:14
and said we'll have to move the boulder
26:15
that the elves live in
26:17
so they got someone who speaks to elves
26:18
to talk to the elves who are invisible
26:20
to most people
26:21
and they said okay you can move our
26:22
boulder but we really need to have a
26:23
view of the sea and it's got to be on
26:24
grass because we like to keep sheep
26:26
also invisible sheep south facing
26:28
gardens yeah and they did
26:30
invisible tiny elf sized sheep uh that
26:32
you know elves are human sizes
26:34
icelanders are they yeah oh i see them
26:36
they're people
26:37
wait they look like people but they're
26:39
invisible that is the only difference
26:42
that you can't i didn't know i didn't
26:44
know they were man's size as it were um
26:45
should we move on i was just going to
26:46
say
26:47
quickly uh because i think i must be one
26:48
of james's favorite museums or whichever
26:50
one of you loves weird museums uh
26:51
iceland
26:52
has the phallological museum and that
26:54
has as well which is the penis museum
26:55
penis museum say the real
26:57
sorry sorry i was not i would mention
26:58
penises too much i felt like we should
27:00
use different words two-thirds of it's
27:02
underground
27:03
[Laughter]
27:04
well you say that but parts of it are
27:06
invisible because it claims to have
27:08
um penises as well as penises of lots of
27:10
animals it claims to have elf
27:12
penises oh and do wealth penises look
27:14
like human penises yeah but they're
27:15
invisible
27:16
so it's just a huge empty cabinet i've
27:19
brought in my collection of l penises
27:20
i'm very
27:21
disappointed that none of you mentioned
27:22
it i'm actually on the wall
27:24
i'm actually wearing my elf dick coat
27:26
right now
27:28
it's just a coat of penises but you
27:29

well the books are really short the
01:17
books i write they're they're almost
01:19
more like pamphlets i mean
01:20
and the also uh the font is really large
01:23
the margins are wide
01:25
uh sometimes you'll just like in between
01:27
chapters there'll just be a few
01:28

01:49
course of her lifetime she has owned and
01:52
cared for
01:53
three pet cats yeah
01:57
so and how did she get these cats it's a
01:59
good question well
02:00
i i know that she actually because she
02:02
speaks sign language um
02:04
knows a thousand words in sign languages
02:06
and apparently they asked her what would
02:07
you like for christmas and she said i
02:09
would like a pet cat
02:10
it's a good thing she doesn't know
02:11
flamethrower
02:13
all the words for freedom all right a
02:16
thousand words isn't that many though is
02:18
it
02:18
is it not i know more than a thousand
02:20
words
02:25
if you take the thousand words you use
02:27
most often yeah they probably cover
02:28
almost everything
02:30
yeah and then it's it's specific ones
02:32
after that like hammock or thrombosis or
02:34
whatever
02:35
so what you know whatever maybe they're
02:36
in your top thousand i don't know yeah
02:38
but it'd be lovely to see the thousand
02:39
words you use most often yes
02:41
it'll be really cool i have that list in
02:43
russian actually what that you use
02:44
no i got that i was trying to learn
02:46
russian and i still am but not very well
02:48
and i thought one way to do it would be
02:50
to get the thousand most popularly
02:51
spoken words in russian
02:53
and then try and learn them all that's
02:54
how uh dr seuss wrote uh cat in the hat
02:57
oh really yeah
02:58
he um he he got a book that was a list
03:01
of
03:01
i think the first 100 words that
03:03
children learn how to read and he uh
03:05
almost as an exercise decided or as like
03:08
a
03:09
shamelessly cynical uh marketing point
03:11
he said i'll write a i write a book
03:13
using just those words
03:14
he had very big fonts as well didn't he
03:16
yeah absolutely the biggest
03:18
did he not do a thing where one of his
03:20
books was a bet with his publisher that
03:22
he could write a book with fewer than 50
03:24
words or something like that i think it
03:25
might be
03:26
that was that yeah yeah yeah but he a
03:28
lot of his stories are
03:30
it's hard to tell if they're true like
03:32
he spread a lot of mythology about
03:33
himself in his time uh he said that he
03:35
used to get all of his ideas from a
03:37
small town where they made the cuckoo
03:38
clock
03:38
uh he used to go there and they'd give
03:40
him ideas but he was also a mummy hunter
03:42
which is interesting yeah he used to go
03:43
with his wife and then go mummy hunting
03:46
was this way is this late 19th century
03:48
early 20th early 20th doctor
03:50
he would be later right uh yeah because
03:51
i know he was i know he's a cartoonist
03:53
during world war two so he must it must
03:55
have been before after that it's amazing
03:56
that even then you could still go mummy
03:58
hunting
03:59
well they used to they used to uh dig up
04:00
mummies and crush them up and and
04:02
and sell them as medicine in jars um
04:05
where
04:06
i just you know around like brooklyn
04:08
yeah
04:09
oh no there's a book that says that the
04:11
kings of england lots of them were
04:12
cannibals
04:13
right because they consumed human flesh
04:16
in the form of mummies
04:17
ground up mummies and things like that
04:18
yeah they thought it had some sort of
04:20
curative property
04:21
wow yeah um anyway back to coco oh yeah
04:24
yeah um so toco asked for a pet cat
04:27
and also it was quite deceiving coco
04:29
basically one day this is a story i read
04:31
about coco the gorilla um they came back
04:33
to
04:34
where coco is and a sink had been ripped
04:37
out
04:37
of the wall this is my favorite coco
04:39
story then tell us
04:40
right yes so uh a gigantic sink had been
04:43
ripped out of the wall and
04:44
you know two thousand pound sink um and
04:46
the scientist uh
04:48
confronted her and said you know who
04:50
ripped out the sink signed who ripped
04:52
out the sink
04:53
and after the long pause coco uh
04:56
signed uh janus and janice was one of
04:59
the lab assistants
05:00
who was uh a 21 year old 95 pound
05:04
woman and uh coco tried to pin it on her
05:08
and uh the scientists signed to coco i
05:10
don't i don't believe that jan is ripped
05:12
out of sync i think gorilla ripped out
05:13
sync
05:14
and coco had to sort of hang her head
05:16
and admit
05:17
uh what she'd done and she signed uh
05:20
coco
05:20
ripped sink bad gorilla coco because i
05:23
read that she blamed the cat as well
05:24
oh wow she was always painting things on
05:26
other yeah is that why she wanted the
05:28
cat to just disguise her crime
05:30
yes exactly yeah she needed a stooge
05:34
that's actually i read about another
05:36
story about coco apparently so she
05:38
um has a name for a human which is
05:41
nipple
05:41
and um she at least three former keepers
05:45
have claimed that they were pressured
05:46
into showing their breasts
05:47
at the guerrillas request that's right
05:50
this cocoa
05:50
is kind of like an evil tyrant and it
05:53
seems like she got whatever she wanted
05:55
whenever she wanted and there were there
05:56
were no checks and balances and
05:58
she was constantly making a scientist
05:59
disrobe and yeah coco knows what's going
06:01
on
06:02
absolutely maybe the cat she wanted was
06:03
a white fluffy cat which she could
06:05
stroke
06:06
she dictated her to man she's quite old
06:09
now she's 30 or 40 years old
06:12
i think that's a reasonably advanced
06:14
stage i think i think maybe
06:16
longer than that evidently but captivity
06:18
in the world differs
06:19
yeah they live longer in captivity i
06:21
think the oldest known uh primate
06:23
that's non-human i think was cheetah out
06:26
of the tarzan movies
06:28
oh yeah because it lived in captivity in
06:30
hollywood somewhere and
06:31
obviously we don't we don't know how old
06:33
every single primate is but this one in
06:35
particular lived to about 70 or
06:37
something really
06:38
yeah there was another hollywood
06:39
lifestyle there isn't it yeah cheetah
06:41
was an artist right
06:42
it's same with bubbles michael jackson's
06:44
um
06:45
monkey but bubbles had a rough end he
06:47
ended up in a sanctuary far away from
06:49
the from the glitz and glamour
06:50
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah michael never
06:53
apparently never visited
06:54
although it said i read this thing where
06:55
they said that um he always thought of
06:57
bubbles
06:58
uh as his first child and added that he
07:00
hoped the jackson children would keep in
07:02
touch with their stepbrother
07:04
uh after he's gone so he did love him
07:06
but he got too aggressive he got too big
07:08
apparently
07:09
when chimpanzees get too big can you
07:12
imagine bubbles in that animal sanctuary
07:14
with the other chimps trying to explain
07:16
what his childhood was like i mean
07:20
what how would anyone believe it michael
07:22
jackson of the chimpanzee
07:24
that's right yeah um my grandmother used
07:27
to own a chimpanzee in cambodia really
07:29
was your half brother
07:30
it was it was named after me actually is
07:32
it yeah it was called they call me
07:34
chumps that's my nickname i had it was a
07:36
kid from them and they named it sounds
07:37
like you were named after the chimpanzee
07:39
yeah yeah well they had a gibbon as well
07:40
and they kept in this cage in this
07:42
restaurant they had a restaurant in
07:43
cambodia where um it's not like a pick
07:45
your own given thing is it because
07:46
i don't know they were just they were
07:48
there okay okay yeah it was an amazing
07:50
restaurant because they they used to
07:51
have a massive menu but everyone kept
07:52
ordering the goulash
07:53
and what they discovered was that one of
07:55
the chefs kept putting marijuana inside
07:57
which is legal there um so they got rid
07:59
of the whole menu and it was just a
08:00
goulash
08:01
marijuana place that's what my
08:03
grandmother but they had to um
08:05
had to give away the chimpanzee because
08:06
um she got sexually frustrated with the
08:08
gibbon in the cage and
08:09
ripped its arm off very sad yeah rips
08:14
that's what that's yeah wow
08:17
well they're freakishly strong and um uh
08:21
they've they've evolved to
08:24
go for vulnerable parts of you know
08:26
another primates body so it
08:28
they they will rip off the genitals of
08:30
male rivals and throw them
08:32
yeah hundreds of feet throw themselves
08:35
yeah oh yeah and then
08:36
because then you're simultaneously
08:37
killing your enemy and also you're
08:39
expunging his genetic influence on your
08:42
drive very much the john wayne bobbitts
08:44
the animal kingdom very efficient
08:47
violence god imagine you just walking
08:49
through the forest as an exploring this
08:50
gorilla [ __ ] smacks you in the face it's
08:53
a rough day
08:54
that's a rough day oh gorilla testicles
08:56
only
08:57
about an eighth or a sixteenth the size
08:59
of human ones
09:00
certainly the penises are very small
09:02
guerrilla people but that's because they
09:04
do all the establishing supremacy
09:05
with their muscles isn't it with their
09:07
body there's no need for sperm
09:08
competition because right
09:09
they you know once you're a male gorilla
09:12
and you get a
09:13
harem then you're you're away you don't
09:15
need to worry about competition from
09:16
other males in that sense
09:18
and you don't need like like a cool car
09:20
yeah you can just kind of
09:22
show up yeah i think it's something like
09:24
a male
09:25
silverback gorilla's erect penis is a
09:27
quarter of an inch in length or
09:28
something like that you might be right
09:30
yeah
09:30
so like a normal sized penis right guys
09:33
like an average average male penis
09:38
um okay should we wrap up with this one
09:40
yeah yeah uh anna
09:41
uh we should go to you do you have any
09:42
anything you want to add um yeah a few
09:44
things so
09:45
long time ago uh you guys were talking
09:47
about the 1000 most commonly used
09:48
english words oh yeah
09:50
oh yeah um yep so i've got a list of
09:52
them here and i just
09:53
i thought i'd read them all out and
09:56
you're right
09:57
the oven and yep how much time have we
09:59
got another three
10:01
i know the three most common nouns are
10:02
time person and year
10:04
yes anyway um the first 25 shut up james
10:08
don't care it's my role now this is my
10:11
moment the first 25 words in the
10:13
thousand most frequently used words make
10:14
up a third of all printed material
10:16
just 25 words the reason coco knew what
10:20
a cat was before she had her pet cat
10:22
her two favorite books were the three
10:24
little kittens and put in boots
10:26
and so she looked at those pictures and
10:29
knew the word cat i don't know the three
10:31
little kittens
10:32
neither do i you should've talked to
10:33
coco anyway they first of all tried to
10:35
give her a stuffed toy that looked like
10:37
a cat to
10:38
fob her off and she was really pissed
10:39
off and made it clear that she needed
10:42
the real thing
10:42
so they got they got the real thing and
10:44
she named it all ball
10:46
did we discuss that no we didn't so she
10:48
she named her first kitten obviously she
10:49
only has a thousand words in her
10:51
vocabulary which it turns out isn't
10:52
enough for a good cat name
10:53
so she called it all ball because
10:56
apparently according to her owners she
10:57
likes to rhyme in sign language
11:03
time for fact number two and that's my
11:05
fact uh my fact this week is according
11:07
to yeti experts oh god
11:09
yeah uh it is easier to escape a female
11:12
yeti than a male yeti because female
11:14
yetis have such long dangling boobs that
11:17
before they can chase you they need to
11:18
chuck them over their shoulders like a
11:20
scarf
11:20
otherwise they may trip on them and bang
11:22
their head james you're looking
11:23
skeptical that's a fact
11:25
yeah it's a fact about something that
11:27
doesn't exist it's a fact about
11:28
something that no one has ever seen
11:29
yes uh but it's a fact that comes from
11:32
captain john knoll captain john noll was
11:34
the guy
11:35
who first broke into tibet under a guise
11:38
because he weren't allowed as a
11:39
westerner into tibet and he was the
11:40
first person to see mount everest
11:42
and think we need to climb that he came
11:44
back to england and he pitched it at the
11:46
royal geographical society
11:48
and that's what led to the mallory
11:49
expedition and he was on the mallory
11:51
expedition he was the official
11:52
photographer
11:53
do you think they said i'm not really
11:55
sure that sounds like a good idea and
11:56
then he said oh no there's giant
11:58
monkeys with enormous breasts yeah
12:00
exactly oh he might have i don't know if
12:02
he believed in the yeti that might have
12:03
been a that that was a bit of myth that
12:04
he brought back with him
12:06
but it's a fact it is a fact about
12:08
something that
12:09
people who believe in the yeti believe
12:11
if you were talking to someone who
12:13
believes in a yeti
12:14
right here in this room and you said did
12:15
you know this i'd say yeah of course
12:17
it's a weird one though isn't it because
12:19
it's a fact that that is believed
12:20
amongst
12:21
people who believe in it yeah it's like
12:23
a different world of facts it's like a
12:25
second subspecies of facts
12:26
because it is a yeti fact but it's not a
12:29
real world fact
12:30
i think it's a person fact yeah it's a
12:32
fact about what people believe
12:34
so do you know about the 10 million
12:36
dollar bigfoot bounty tv show
12:39
no no okay it was on a very small
12:41
american channel i can't remember which
12:43
one it is
12:43
like a satellite channel or a cable
12:45
channel and
12:46
um there was a number of teams and they
12:49
every week
12:50
tried to find evidence of bigfoot and
12:52
whoever found the least evidence each
12:54
week would get kicked off until there
12:55
was only two teams
12:57
so how did they classify the least
12:59
evidence they had a team of experts
13:01
who would who would explain that and um
13:04
the final two whoever got the most
13:06
evidence if they could find
13:08
evidence of bigfoot then they would win
13:10
10 million dollars
13:11
wow did the price go unclaimed it went
13:13
unclaimed at that point even i know
13:15
bigfoot is something of a recluse but if
13:16
i were him i would go and make a deal
13:18
and say i'll take five
13:20
you take five million i'll post for one
13:22
picture and you know yeah
13:23
hang on the premise of this show is that
13:25
if you find most or
13:26
least evidence you're either saved or
13:28
kicked off but if at the end of the show
13:30
the people who found most evidence had
13:32
found no evidence and therefore the
13:34
temple went unclaimed
13:35
then all the other teams are like they
13:37
found even less than no evidence
13:39
yeah that's the premise uh the 10
13:41
million was underwritten by lloyds of
13:42
london
13:43
probably as a as a joke oh man i'd love
13:47
to see the look on their face if they
13:48
found bigfoot
13:49
yeah what a rough
13:52
shareholders meeting that is you know
13:54
just uh we're in the red this quarter
13:57
they found bigfoot we're sorry
14:01
they did uh quite recently there was a
14:03
study done of um
14:05
creatures claiming to be bigfoot or the
14:08
sasquatch
14:09
and they took 57 samples of hair
14:12
that people had sent into them saying
14:14
this is bigfoot or this is a sasquatch
14:16
um one of them was a piece of fiberglass
14:18
so that didn't get used but they managed
14:20
to get down to about 30 where they
14:21
didn't know what it was immediately
14:23
and of that 30 they turned out to be
14:26
cows horses uh raccoons or
14:30
um sometimes bears but they think that
14:32
they might have got two samples from
14:33
previously unrecognized bird species or
14:36
hybrids
14:36
so they might have discovered new
14:38
species wow by doing that there's plenty
14:40
more to find out there
14:41
we live under this weird assumption that
14:42
we've discovered everything
14:44
right and in the ocean we've barely
14:45
cracked the surface right yeah yeah
14:48
yeah the ocean is i think we've done
14:51
something like six percent tops we
14:53
definitely mapped mars better than the
14:54
other
14:55
the thing that i liked most about this
14:56
yeti fact other than it's yetis and i
14:58
love yetis
14:59
uh is that i i just love it's it's
15:02
advice to escape it's it's escape advice
15:04
and i love escape advice because i think
15:06
it's it's the best kind of weird handy
15:09
advice that you probably will never need
15:10
to use but it will always stick with you
15:12
if you know this fact now about female
15:13
yetis this will not leave you for the
15:15
rest of your life i
15:16
found this thing of like the best way to
15:18
in chinese mythology to escape
15:20
a vampire is to make sure you have bags
15:22
of
15:24
um they're rice counters apparently
15:27
vampires yeah so
15:28
they do do you spill rice you spill rice
15:31
as they're chasing you they
15:32
they have a dilemma where they're like
15:33
ah yeah and then they're right
15:35
they have that in eastern european
15:37
vampire culture as well like you put
15:39
sand on the
15:40
on the doorstep and they won't come into
15:41
your house because they'll just stand
15:42
there counting what we're saying is that
15:43
all vampires have obsessive compulsive
15:45
disorders yeah like that one off
15:46
sesame street who goes is that where it
15:50
came from the count and sesame street
15:52
that was just i think that was just a
15:53
pun on the word count probably oh yeah
15:56
um if you wanted to escape being an
15:58
aztec prisoner
15:59
uh andy i know you like you know this
16:01
fact you like it um
16:03
if you were a slave sorry in aztec times
16:05
the way to escape was to run away from
16:07
your master in the middle of the market
16:09
and step in some human excrement and if
16:11
you did that you were no longer a slave
16:14
really yeah that was quite a loophole it
16:16
implies either there was a lot of human
16:18
excrement around all that it was very
16:20
rare
16:20
maybe it was actually there was quite a
16:21
lot because they they're um the sewers
16:23
went alongside this
16:25
town walls kind of thing okay well the
16:26
other thing was if someone tried to stop
16:28
you from being a slave and someone
16:30
noticed that
16:31
then sorry if you stopped someone trying
16:33
to escape then you became a slave so no
16:35
one ever stopped them
16:36
once they started running away everyone
16:38
went oh nothing to do with me i think i
16:39
think it gives people a fair chance yeah
16:41
i respect that
16:42
really great story that i like about uh
16:45
sort of a moment of needing to escape
16:47
uh the guys set up mi6
16:50
mansfield coming oh yeah yeah he's great
16:52
because you assume that he would be the
16:54
ultimate
16:54
spy yeah this great story where during
16:56
world war one he went into germany
16:59
disguised as a german soldier
17:01
infiltrating
17:02
a german camp but got busted immediately
17:06
because it turned out he didn't know any
17:07
german immediately at the gate
17:10
at least he was like yeah if he'd
17:12
learned 25 words he would have been he
17:14
would have been tried
17:14
yeah he used to do his thing he had a
17:17
wooden leg but no one really knew at the
17:18
time that he had a wooden leg but in
17:20
meetings
17:20
if he got bored with what anyone was
17:22
saying and no one knew he had this leg
17:24
he used to take a massive knife that he
17:25
had on the desk and just stab
17:26
himself in the leg that will go whoa and
17:28
then he'd just take over
17:30
anyway
17:37
100 yards you should see people's faces
17:39
um
17:40
we should probably wrap up on this one
17:41
as well anna have you got anything to
17:43
add
17:43
just a couple of small things so on
17:46
yeti's
17:47
you were saying that it's if you're
17:48
being chased by a female yeti
17:50
you're in luck because they've got these
17:51
big breasts that get in their way but
17:53
apparently according to yeti
17:54
experts you're also likely to be able to
17:56
escape a male if you run downhill
17:58
because it's got long hair that blows in
18:00
its eyes when running so it can't see
18:01
well
18:02
i have that so and oh just the
18:05
uh the ocean floor the estimates are
18:07
that we've only discovered 10
18:10
of what there is to be discovered in the
18:11
ocean although
18:13
if you're talking about mapped sea floor
18:14
that's in the public domain we've only
18:16
discovered two to three percent
18:18
but apparently so much of the
18:19
information about the ocean is
18:20
completely classified
18:21
and shrouded in secrecy according to
18:23
national geographic
18:25
the seven percent of what we've
18:26
discovered about the ocean no one's
18:27
allowed to know because it's so
18:28
highly secretive well it's genuinely
18:30
classified yeah
18:31
so military classified information right
18:33
because i guess they have the gadgets
18:35
that go under there so that it's
18:36
proprietary information right
18:38
yeah well so they wouldn't want to say
18:40
they want to share
18:41
that technology right probably right it
18:43
must come down to that yeah
18:45
yeah because nobody's claimed it
18:46
nobody's claimed that that that
18:49
that's chunk of the earth they have
18:50
drones lots of drones
18:52
ocean drones now which is so cool they
18:53
have whole generations of little robots
18:56
and their only job is to measure or
18:57
assess one thing and you just set them
18:59
off and they can go all over the world
19:01
they're always beaming information back
19:03
yeah like google spiders
19:04
yeah in a way yeah wow it sounds amazing
19:08
sounds made up
19:16
okay uh on to fact number three james
19:19
okay uh my fact this week is uh the
19:21
karma sutra suggests 64 arts to practice
19:24
alongside sex
19:26
they include solving word puzzles and
19:28
teaching birds how to talk
19:31
yeah that's weird i just assumed it was
19:32
just all sex parties no not that much
19:34
sex in there at all
19:35
in that case i am a lot sexier than i
19:37
realized i'm getting pretty good at the
19:39
telegraph cryptic crossword
19:42
that's amazing yeah 64 of them uh some
19:45
of the others
19:46
tattooing the art of making beds playing
19:50
on musical glasses filled with water
19:53
knowledge of minds and quarries and the
19:55
art of [ __ ] fighting
19:57
or are these dating ideas before you get
19:59
to the actual portion of the book about
20:00
sex
20:01
no it's why not visit a minor quarry why
20:04
not play
20:05
musical glasses filled with water yeah
20:08
but so what was the book then what is it
20:10
okay the book is
20:11
um it was written in the third century
20:13
by a celibate monk
20:15
and um he was bringing together all of
20:17
the
20:18
different writings from beforehand that
20:21
were about sex
20:22
or about um the art of mating
20:25
in humans so where does teaching a bird
20:28
to speak
20:29
these are things that if you do those it
20:30
will improve your prove your general
20:32
life and also your sex life oh
20:34
sort of like a holistic approach like
20:36
yeah yeah yeah there are nine pages on
20:39
how to look after your wife
20:41
uh and 26 pages detailing how to seduce
20:43
other men's wives
20:47
and it's harder to be fair it needs more
20:51
well here's one way to seduce other
20:52
men's wives yeah from that it's called
20:55
uh pocket no pocket
20:57
first take the heart of a mongoose uh
20:59
then the fruits of a fenugreek plant
21:01
and a god and some snake eyes mix them
21:04
all together cook them over the fire
21:06
and then put them in your eyes and it'll
21:08
make you invisible and then you can
21:10
go and find another man's wife
21:13
mistranslated invisible for blind
21:16
god times were great back then if a
21:18
recipe at the beginning of a thing
21:20
says take the heart of a mongoose
21:23
yeah just the very first ingredient
21:25
that's like the equivalent of like
21:26
preheat the oven at 350 degrees
21:30
just the most basic construction yeah
21:32
there's um a papyrus an egyptian papyrus
21:34
which has
21:35
a load of things that when it says uh
21:37
snake's blood what it's supposed to be
21:39
is
21:39
some kind of fruit juice or something
21:41
and when it says crocodile excrement
21:43
it's supposed to be some clay
21:45
a special kind of clay from ethiopia so
21:47
they use these words even though they
21:48
didn't really mean oh it's all coded yes
21:50
james has a theory that um because in a
21:53
lot of contrast
21:54
they say that the ancient egyptians used
21:55
crocodile dung as a contraceptive yeah
21:57
but you
21:58
and i think it was just actually a piece
22:00
of clay from
22:01
um abyssinia or from ethiopia and they
22:03
used to
22:04
make it into um what do you call these a
22:06
pessary and
22:07
stop people from being able to
22:10
impregnate you that way
22:11
but you get it in all the lists of facts
22:13
it's like they use crocodile dung for
22:15
contraception it's pretty unlikely yeah
22:17
all euphemisms yeah
22:18
it's always eye of newt right isn't it
22:20
yeah experiences you know
22:23
can you imagine them trying to piece
22:25
that together what is going on
22:28
what do they want from us
22:31
so that would be amazing someone in that
22:33
period taking it literally
22:35
and going and actually getting the heart
22:36
of a mongoose maybe what did you do to
22:38
our [ __ ] man
22:39
that means pencil get a pencil everyone
22:42
knows it so that would be very
22:43
embarrassing to serve that you know
22:45
which is potion app and yeah yeah filled
22:47
with all the literal ingredients
22:49
yeah it would explain a lot of fancy
22:50
cookbooks today as well if heston
22:52
blumenthal is actually using a series of
22:53
elaborate
22:54
metaphors and he just wants us to make
22:55
spaghetti bolognese
22:57
take liquid nitrogen no i mean i mean
22:59
ice
23:01
yeah so what else is there in the karma
23:03
sutra so the karma suture was
23:05
um discovered by richard burton who did
23:08
the first um british uh english
23:10
translation
23:11
yeah we should say not richard burton
23:12
the actor yeah the victorian explorer
23:14
that's right yeah
23:15
yeah not that richard burton who is the
23:17
most extraordinary character
23:19
yeah seemingly fictional when you read
23:21
his life story because of the amount of
23:22
things that he did
23:23
spoke like 30 languages there's probably
23:25
too many that i've made up there but
23:27
yeah he did speak a lot of languages but
23:29
i'm not sure how well he spoke them all
23:31
because
23:31
he translated the kama sutra from
23:33
sanskrit and
23:34
whenever um he was supposed to translate
23:36
the word dildo
23:38
he put statue instead which kind of
23:40
changes the meaning of some of the
23:42
things in there
23:43
yeah he also when instead of writing
23:46
about penises and vaginas because he was
23:47
writing for victorian audience
23:50
um he would call the penis lingam
23:53
which was sanskrit for wand of light
23:56
and he was called the vagina yoni which
23:58
was sanskrit for sacred temple
24:01
wow so it's place your wand of light
24:03
into the sacred temple so it must read
24:05
like a harry potter book when you read
24:06
his version of the karma sutra do we do
24:09
we have more
24:10
sort of ancient love guides outside of
24:13
the kama sutra i've never really heard
24:15
it's an egyptian one
24:17
there's one called the tyrion erotic
24:19
papyrus
24:20
genuinely there's the turin shroud and
24:22
then from about 2000 years before that
24:24
is the turin erotic papyrus
24:26
um and it's a series of uh blue drawings
24:28
basically
24:30
yeah i don't think it's meant quite as a
24:32
love guide i think it's more to to
24:33
titillate and things like that
24:34
okay there was that great i can't
24:37
remember his name um anna you might be
24:38
able to find it but in the natural
24:40
history museum they have effectively
24:41
what is an erotica book it was
24:43
during a shackleton trip uh where the
24:46
guy who was studying penguins
24:48
um witnessed the insane love life of
24:51
penguins
24:52
and he found it so dirty that all of the
24:54
bits where he had to describe
24:56
the actual like sexual acts he put into
24:58
what was it great
25:00
so that you had to be a real scholar i
25:01
didn't think it was in a code i think it
25:03
was a code on top of ancient greek yeah
25:05
so they cracked the code wow and then
25:07
even after you've cracked the code it's
25:08
still an ancient group
25:09
still in ancient greek if i saw
25:11
something coded in in
25:13
ancient greek i would man i would assume
25:15
the worst and then and
25:17
jump right into that oh yeah photography
25:19
was a lot harder to access in the old
25:20
days wasn't it
25:21
you had to crack the code and then
25:23
translate from greek and then it's about
25:26
penguins
25:28
and so the karma sutra again um yeah
25:31
they have a section on oral sex
25:33
well it starts off saying oral sex is
25:35
very very
25:36
terrible and you shouldn't be doing that
25:37
kind of thing and then they have quite a
25:38
few pages on how to do it
25:40
like how this is what you definitely
25:42
shouldn't do whatever you do don't do
25:43
this and then don't do it this way and
25:45
don't do it this way
25:46
it's a bit like during um prohibition
25:49
when
25:49
they um they used to like sell uh
25:52
winemaking kits
25:53
and it would be grapes and whatever and
25:55
it says whatever you do don't put this
25:57
alcohol in these grapes and don't
25:58
flash them down or whatever for a long
26:00
time uh theater in new york city uh
26:02
it was against the law unless it had
26:04
some kind of higher moral purpose oh
26:05
yeah and so uh
26:06
pretty much every show uh during the
26:09
sort of pt barnum days was uh
26:11
uh a show like a a a sexy melodrama
26:16
and then at the end a stern matronly
26:18
woman would come out for 30 seconds
26:19
after two hours of this and say
26:21
like don't do what you've just seen and
26:25
uh that would kind of be it that's why
26:27
they were they were referred to as moral
26:28
lectures
26:30
wow and people would start to file out
26:32
you know as the woman came on
26:33
yeah i'd i'd rather have that at the
26:35
beginning i think would she
26:37
yeah does that not spoil the rest of the
26:38
movie no because then you forget about
26:40
it once the sexy melodrama starts
26:41
[Laughter]
26:43
well during the the uh before um
26:47
there's there's a few decades where uh
26:51
film was really closely regulated by the
26:52
united states government and
26:54
one of the things was you could never
26:56
portray uh a criminal in a positive
26:58
light
26:59
oh yeah and and you can never show them
27:01
uh
27:02
getting away with their crime they
27:04
always had to be punished
27:06
and so there's a lot of films where
27:08
basically uh
27:10
they get the girl they get the money
27:12
they get the
27:13
the fame and the glory and then they're
27:14
just inexplicably gunned down
27:16
i think buy a stun matronly like
27:28
but it's all these hilarious like tacked
27:30
on endings right
27:31
yeah you were just mentioning pt barnum
27:33
before my favorite pt barnum thing is
27:35
that
27:35
when people used to go to his circuses
27:38
you would pay your money pay two dollars
27:40
go in
27:40
and then there would be a big sign
27:42
saying this way to the egress
27:43
and everyone would go down there not
27:45
really realizing that egress means exit
27:47
and they'd go straight out and they'd
27:49
have to pay to go back in again
27:50
and then they probably wouldn't ask for
27:52
their money back because they were too
27:53
humiliated yeah
27:54
they didn't know that he thought it was
27:55
a female eagle awesome that's great well
27:57
he
27:58
he yeah he was brilliant yeah
28:01
um he invented the skylight i believe i
28:03
think he's the first person to yeah
28:05
the american museum in manhattan that
28:07
should probably be fact-checked but
28:08
but yeah yeah the first person to burn
28:10
electric lights
28:11
uh at night for no pragmatic reason
28:15
other than self-promotion so if so the
28:17
the original new york city skyline
28:19
was just the word barnum shapeless void
28:23
but the museum burned down didn't it oh
28:25
yeah yeah burned down
28:26
i wonder if yeah and then later on he he
28:29
had spent a long time building a
28:31
palace for his house and that burnt down
28:33
i think the day after completion yeah he
28:34
built a kind of uh
28:35
sort of like a xanadu type place like a
28:37
gigantic
28:38
uh mansion and it burned down almost
28:41
immediately yeah
28:42
and then weirdly he this is all in
28:44
connecticut where he sort of
28:46
retired after after his long career and
28:48
uh i think i think bridgeport
28:49
connecticut
28:50
he i think became mayor of the town
28:53
or so so he had his whole like small
28:56
town political career towards the end
28:59
it used to be a problem where things
29:00
burned down didn't it like there was a
29:01
lot of
29:02
yeah because it still is in many ways
29:04
you know we just haven't solved that
29:06
problem for building burning down yet
29:07
but in theaters it used to be because i
29:09
used to light things up with
29:11
like um fire all the time and there was
29:13
a few that burnt down in covent garden
29:15
yeah quite a while ago
29:16
and then they had to put the prices up
29:18
and people protested against the prices
29:21
going up because they had to pay for
29:22
this
29:23
damage and they protest they riot they
29:26
rioted for days and days and days and
29:28
they were known as the upriots
29:30
because people wanted the old prices and
29:32
so op
29:33
is old price and people would just stand
29:34
there while they were trying to do the
29:35
play and just go
29:36
up up up up for like hours on a tough
29:40
crowd
29:40
i know that's a rough night i always
29:43
think the worst would be uh
29:44
the actors uh on stage during the
29:46
lincoln assassination
29:48
just like man how do you get the
29:50
audience back after that
29:55
um okay anna have you got anything to
29:57
add yeah a couple of things to clarify
29:59
so the guy you were talking about who
30:01
wrote the sexual habits of adelie
30:03
penguins was
30:04
dr george levick who was a surgeon and
30:06
medical officer for
30:08
the british antarctic expedition led by
30:10
scott 1910
30:11
yeah it was suppressed for almost 100
30:12
years 97 years and was only made public
30:15
in 2012
30:16
because it was considered too crude for
30:18
society to handle i think did we mention
30:20
that on qi that um
30:22
the penguin thing i think it might have
30:23
been on the show in which case he kept
30:25
it secret for more than 100 years until
30:27
2012 and then the next year we put it on
30:29
national television
30:30
yeah sorry victorians any stupid
30:33
sensibilities in a way he should if he'd
30:35
only published it then we'd all have
30:36
forgotten about it by now yeah exactly
30:39
uh things in the karma sutra so
30:41
something that
30:42
burton you're right he did mistranslate
30:43
a lot of the kama sutra he
30:45
downplays women's positions so in the
30:47
kama sutra women it's
30:48
there's a lot of equality in there a lot
30:49
of gender equality which obviously he
30:51
didn't approve of being a victorian man
30:54
and so for instance there's a bit in the
30:55
text that advises that the wife of an
30:57
unfaithful man
30:58
should scold him with sharp language and
31:00
burton just inserts the word never
31:02
into that man should
31:06
never scroll down
31:09
so this is a minor change
31:12
editing decision
31:17
um okay time for the final fact of the
31:19
show uh andy
31:20
hello my fact this week is that there
31:22
are more than 15 trillion tons of water
31:24
above the earth
31:25
now at any given moment isn't that
31:28
amazing
31:28
that's a lot yeah is it a lot 15
31:31
trillion
31:32
cents i guess it is i think so it's hard
31:33
to imagine such a big number it's
31:35
i know what you mean it's a small
31:36
proportion a very small proportion of
31:37
the total amount of water on the planet
31:39
obviously
31:40
but nonetheless it is a vast amount
31:43
it's too big to compute really but this
31:45
is the really the the really cool thing
31:47
about clouds so the average cloud weighs
31:48
about 400 tons
31:49
it turns out the average cumulus cloud
31:51
um so
31:53
individually all the drop because why
31:55
don't they just fall they well they are
31:57
they're always falling but
31:58
the air inside the cloud is moving
32:00
upwards faster than they're falling
32:02
so it's like a slinky on an escalator
32:05
and if you can imagine that yeah it's
32:07
yeah um so
32:08
but and the water droplets are so tiny
32:10
the 0.01 millimeters in diameter
32:13
a billion of them would be the same size
32:14
as a sugar cube and they're very fast
32:17
spaced out when you say a slinky on an
32:18
escalator do you mean an escalator going
32:20
up
32:20
yeah i do i've never had that image in
32:22
my head ever it's always stairs with a
32:24
slinky just going down but presumably
32:26
the slinky can stay
32:27
yeah that's what that is yeah wow yeah
32:29
that's a strong image i've never had
32:30
that in my
32:32
life a perpetual motion machine yeah hey
32:34
guys you cracked it there we go
32:36
if only we could think of a way of the
32:38
escalator going up without any input of
32:40
energy
32:47
the size of the tiny aerosol droplets in
32:50
the cloud
32:51
is one micron in width which is the same
32:53
width as a human sperm
32:55
wow okay a normal normal male penis is
32:59
just
32:59
slightly bigger than that
33:03
right
33:06
but the sperm is the smallest cell in
33:08
the body isn't it or just about the
33:09
smaller cell
33:10
it's very close to it whereas but i
33:12
don't think it is really
33:13
but it's it's down there it's it's
33:15
pretty small but like blood platelets
33:16
are pretty small
33:18
yeah yeah i think it's not the same it's
33:20
generally said to be the small but the
33:21
female leg is definitely the last the
33:23
biggest okay yeah yeah
33:24
but the biggest egg in all nature will
33:26
be like a bird's egg probably like a
33:28
ostrich yeah those things are big yeah
33:30
what used to be the
33:31
elephant bird egg remember the one that
33:32
david attenborough found the
33:34
um the egg of it it looks like a giant
33:37
ostrich
33:38
uh and it's it's it's the largest an egg
33:41
can be
33:42
all right before it gets too thick that
33:43
the thing inside can't crack out of it
33:45
or that
33:46
it just couldn't form to begin with it's
33:47
called the oven sorry i'm in the oven
33:49
not the
33:50
egg like a chicken's egg because that's
33:52
fast
33:53
yeah yeah yeah yeah i'm just thinking
33:56
about that egg
33:57
the the giant burdek do we still have
33:58
the elephant bed no no it's extinct but
34:00
we do have the egg it's kind of like
34:02
when you go to mongolia and you
34:03
find dinosaur eggs just found a new
34:05
dinosaur did you guys see that right
34:07
yeah gigantically yeah the biggest one
34:09
they've ever found
34:10
they say it's uh 12 times as big as a
34:12
t-rex
34:13
what yeah i heard that in the guardian
34:16
this morning yeah 12 times
34:18
it is scary when you see the photos of
34:20
these giant like like uh
34:22
thigh bones which are twice the size of
34:25
a person
34:25
but did you know that most of these
34:27
dinosaurs had feathers
34:29
this is the new theory they looked like
34:31
uh people are yeah people say they
34:32
basically looked like giant chickens it
34:34
makes them a little less intimidating
34:36
jurassic park needs a whole cherry shell
34:38
someone will do it someone will do it at
34:40
some point for the 20th anniversary
34:42
they'll come up with
34:43
all feathers on every dinosaur
34:45
velociraptors i think and velociraptors
34:46
were tiny weren't they they were the
34:47
size of
34:48
i think large chickens and small dogs
34:50
somewhere in between those two
34:52
yeah um
34:56
do you know what that is clouds juice
34:58
yeah yeah rain
35:00
well yeah it is pretty much your fancy
35:01
words this is a bolton thing
35:03
no it's not very much not it's a it's
35:05
bottled water
35:07
uh that you can get um in claridges
35:10
and they sell it in a menu like wine and
35:12
it's collected on a plastic roof on a
35:14
tiny windswept
35:16
island off the australian coast and it's
35:18
the most expensive bottled water ever to
35:20
arrive in the uk
35:21
wow what how is it sold as being better
35:24
because normal bottled water the trade
35:26
winds come off the
35:28
ocean and it's supposed to be much purer
35:30
because there isn't any pollution
35:31
on the rain it's weird isn't it because
35:33
it it's just h2o
35:35
yeah there are ways of purifying water
35:37
you just need to boil it and condense it
35:38
and then you've got
35:39
no impurities at all yet we have this
35:43
idealized water in our heads yeah though
35:46
you could buy launch them so badly
35:47
yeah don't you guys want to taste that i
35:49
bet it's great let's all go to cleveland
35:51
let's get sushi on the way to get them
35:52
to sponsor this thing
35:57
and cloud juice it sounds hot it doesn't
36:00
sound nice though it's not a nice name
36:01
yeah why do they call it
36:03
water lovely cloud juice
36:07
[Laughter]
36:10
but there's also you could get beer
36:11
where it cut the water comes from
36:13
glaciers and that's supposed to be like
36:15
better and purer oh like ice cream ice
36:17
vine as well
36:18
which is wine where the grapes are
36:20
frozen and so all the sugar is pushed
36:22
into the remaining bit of the grape
36:23
which isn't frozen and then you crush
36:24
that grape
36:25
so it makes a much sweeter wine
36:28
okay have you heard of cloud9 yes yeah
36:31
yeah of course yeah yeah well
36:32
um this is really cool cloud9 is not the
36:34
highest most elegant floaty cloud there
36:36
is cloud9 is actually
36:38
at the very bottom of the height scale
36:39
in the international cloud atlas
36:41
it's like high fog essentially is is
36:44
cool is cumulonimbus
36:46
so cumulus are the fluffy ones nimbus or
36:48
rainy and that's that's cloud9 yeah yeah
36:50
if you want really high elegant clouds
36:51
uh you want cloud 0 which is
36:53
cirrus and that's the stuff which is
36:55
just ice crystals in the sky it's just
36:57
millions of ice crystals floating
36:58
together yeah
36:59
did they like change the numbers or
37:00
something is that why we say cloud nine
37:02
is
37:02
no they were all um so the famous system
37:05
was invented by a scientist called luke
37:07
howard
37:07
which is all the last names cumulus
37:10
nimbus stratus
37:11
um serious is love it means a curl of
37:12
hair that's really because it does
37:14
it looks it looks beautiful like that
37:15
but um he came up
37:18
uh with the system and the poet gerther
37:21
was so impressed with this incredible
37:23
classification job that he
37:25
he dedicated four whole poems to him and
37:27
he praised him for bestowing form on the
37:29
formless and a system of ordered change
37:31
on a boundless world you know back in
37:34
the day when there weren't names for
37:35
different types of clouds um
37:36
but this is really cool the year before
37:38
luke howard came up with his that was
37:39
1802
37:40
it was another french scientist called
37:41
jean-baptiste lamarck and he came up
37:43
with the system
37:44
um and he came up with his when he was
37:46
ill in bed looking at the clouds
37:47
floating past his window and they had
37:49
uh onvoil which means hazy atrupay
37:52
mast pomelay which means dappled and
37:55
gruppe
37:56
which means grouped was that the same
37:58
lamarck who came up with evolution at
38:00
the same time
38:01
yeah so he was off on a couple of things
38:04
yeah but unfortunately no one paid any
38:06
attention to his system
38:07
in the next year along comes fancy boy
38:09
with his latin and away you go
38:11
but they believed him about you know uh
38:13
giraffes stretching their necks out
38:14
until they were lost yeah people bought
38:16
that for a while right yeah yeah there's
38:17
still some people american
38:19
like there's still some people who think
38:20
that lamarcus and will come back one day
38:22
there were some studies like in the last
38:24
few years that um
38:25
mice can uh pass their memories on to
38:28
their grandchildren
38:29
and if that was true if that turns out
38:31
to be true that would be lamarcus
38:34
yeah right right yeah it's such a mad
38:36
idea when you can pass on
38:38
uh learned traits like it was fear
38:40
wasn't it they associated a particular
38:42
smell with fear and
38:44
two generations on the mice which had no
38:46
contact with their
38:47
grandparents exhibited the same fear
38:50
okay
38:50
which is if true unbelievable so it's
38:52
not but it's not like
38:54
us getting you know you and me suddenly
38:55
talking about the war no no but the fear
38:57
had altered that
38:58
just those memories came down no but the
39:01
fear had altered their genes
39:03
so they would they would they were
39:04
afraid of the smell of i think it was
39:05
lavender
39:06
my favorite experiment live experiment
39:08
is they uh they
39:09
they hooked uh a mouse's uh
39:13
they hooked his pleasure sensors in his
39:15
brain uh with an electrode to a
39:18
button uh which he could press
39:21
in order to send a jolt of endorphins
39:24
you know into his system
39:25
and he he kept you know predictably he
39:28
kept
39:28
pressing the button and he pressed it uh
39:31
so incessantly
39:32
that he forgot to eat and he forgot to
39:34
drink and uh
39:35
his limbs eventually atrophied
39:39
uh to the point where he had to just
39:40
press it with his face oh my god
39:42
he died ultimately of starvation and no
39:44
one stepped in
39:46
no no they just let him go with him it
39:48
just sounds like
39:49
like one of the saw movies or something
39:50
yeah and then i read another one about
39:52
uh
39:52
they took a bunch of mice and they uh
39:55
played them classical music and they
39:56
took a bunch of other
39:58
mice and they played them rock and roll
39:59
and uh they mixed them together and
40:01
the rock mice ate the classical mice
40:07
um okay should we should we wrap up on
40:09
this anna have you got have you got
40:10
anything you want to
40:11
add so the largest dinosaur ever found
40:14
has been discovered it weighed as much
40:16
they estimate as 14 african elephants
40:19
it's seven tons heavier than the
40:20
previous record holder
40:22
it was found in argentina so it's pretty
40:23
impressive and it's about
40:25
20 meters tall uh which reminded me
40:28
of a thing i read and i think it was a
40:30
new scientist blog if anyone saw the
40:32
first episode of this series of doctor
40:34
who
40:34
where the t-rex was the same height as
40:37
big ben oh yeah the largest known
40:39
specimen of a t-rex that we have was
40:41
is four meters and big ben is 96.
40:44
so
40:50
[Music]
40:51
okay that's it that's all of our facts
40:53
uh thanks everyone for listening uh if
40:55
you want to get in contact with any of
40:56
us about the things we've been talking
40:57
about on this podcast you can reach
40:59
most of us on twitter um i can be gone
41:02
at schreiberland
41:03
uh andy at andrew hunter m james at
41:06
egg shaped simon you're not on twitter
41:09
are you no no dice i'm sorry oh my god
41:12
how why uh you know i just cool
41:15
yeah i just it's just my level of
41:16
coolness it's just too high
41:19
i just know it would consume my entire
41:20
life if i was on social media so i just
41:22
steer clear of all of it
41:24
fair enough okay but if uh you can't get
41:26
him online but you can get him
41:28
in book shops that's a good link um yeah
41:31
so spoiled bratz is out now but also
41:33
all of his books uh last girlfriend on
41:35
earth elliott allagash what in god's
41:37
name
41:38
yep um and then there's two in america
41:40
if you're listening in america
41:41
there is uh free range chickens and ant
41:44
farms
41:45
that's amazing uh they're all amazing no
41:47
there's no notes in front of him he's
41:48
just doing this
41:49
yes i remember that i really appreciate
41:51
that i've read it i've read all the
41:53

00:02
which was
00:03
there's no such thing as a fish there's
00:04
no such thing as a fish no seriously
00:06
it's in
00:06
the oxford dictionary of underwater life
00:10
it says it right there first paragraph
00:11
no such thing as a fish
00:18
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:20
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:22
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:24
covent garden
00:25
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
00:26
with two of the regular elves andy
00:28
murray and anna chazinski and we have a
00:29
special guest today
00:31
it's the co-host of antony this helen
00:32
zaltzman and once again we've gathered
00:34
around with our favorite four facts from
00:36
the last week
00:37
and here they are in no particular order
00:40
okay fact number one uh and that's you
00:42
helen
00:43
yes uh i discovered that lol
00:47
the acronym that people now use to
00:48
signify the fact that they're
00:49
weak-minded and words are inadequate for
00:51
their own needs
00:53
used to mean not laugh out loud or even
00:56
lots of love but
00:57
little old lady which uh it doesn't come
01:00
up that much now in
01:01
twitter and tech speak but it was a
01:03
medical definition they had a whole list
01:04
of little old lady
01:06
related abbreviations like lolinad which
01:09
was little old lady in no apparent
01:11
distress
01:12
which you would think why did they need
01:13
to note the absence of distress or you
01:15
would just
01:16
note the fact that she was distressed
01:18
and uh lol for the gabor
01:20
which stood for little old lady fall
01:21
down go boom
01:23
that's a very common complaint doesn't
01:25
it um they exploded
01:26
exactly yeah you have to be very careful
01:29
because some of them are unstable
01:31
is this the thing like the medical slang
01:33
the thing the doctors used to write on
01:34
charts
01:35
is that where it comes from because
01:36
there's a story that keeps on surfacing
01:38
about the
01:38
three-letter acronyms your doctor uses
01:40
like flk means funny-looking kid
01:42
ouch i think they've not been used for
01:44
everything
01:45
my friends use them they're doctors no
01:47
yeah they're still they're still
01:48
amusement yeah
01:50
i found another lol uh which was through
01:53
nasa nasa
01:54
when they were sending all of their uh
01:56
missions they had sort of
01:57
i guess i don't know if it's right to
01:59
call them primitive computer systems but
02:00
they had a thing called core rope memory
02:03
which was basically a read-only memory
02:05
style computer that they used and
02:07
it was made in factories by effectively
02:10
little old ladies and it's called lol
02:12
memory and it means little old lady
02:14
memory
02:15
and yet little old ladies often their
02:17
memories are really erratic you know
02:18
they'll remember childhood but not
02:20
things that happened last week
02:21
that's literally the worst style of
02:23
memory you want to send on a mission to
02:24
mars
02:25
my grandmother was always calling me by
02:26
one of my brother's names because she
02:27
just couldn't remember
02:28
yeah imagine if hal on her 2001 space
02:31
odyssey was
02:32
was lol old lady what's your name do you
02:35
want a biscuit
02:36
i can't do that brian or sydney
02:39
whatever morse code had
02:42
a list of official abbreviations written
02:45
up in 1878
02:46
and it's quite funny because you look
02:47
through them so it's called the philips
02:49
code
02:50
and it's obviously like if you're
02:51
transmitting morse code and you want to
02:52
speed things up there are a few things
02:53
that you say a lot so you need to
02:55
so he assigned them a number rather than
02:57
spelling it out so
02:58
they're kind of obvious stuff like five
03:00
is have you got business for me
03:02
22 is wire test 23 is all copy
03:05
88 is love and kisses oh that's the only
03:08
one that's like that all the rest of
03:10
them yeah number eight
03:11
oh yeah yeah it's a shame it wasn't
03:13
higher up the rankings
03:14
no it wasn't it also sounds like the
03:16
most boring bingo callers
03:17
in the world yeah number five wire test
03:22
loving kisses that's great um i also was
03:24
because this whole idea of finding words
03:26
that were used
03:27
for different meanings previously i read
03:29
this blog written by ann curzin who's a
03:31
language expert and she was talking
03:32
about how different words and what they
03:33
were previously used for
03:34
so the word guy to mean a guy do you
03:38
know where that comes from
03:39
it's not from guy fawkes is that
03:41
according to her yes really oh yeah it
03:42
comes directly from guy fawkes
03:44
seems too obvious to me it does i think
03:46
i would have assumed that and there was
03:47
going to be a twisted
03:49
weird answer and then somehow and it was
03:51
mainly in america that it picked up that
03:53
it just became
03:53
guy but it was off the back of guy
03:55
fawkes according to her it's weird that
03:57
it's in america it picks up yeah
03:58
it is a fundamentally british they have
04:00
no investment
04:02
in eyeballs and also it suggests that
04:03
they think all men are merely effigies
04:06
of humanity it's true it's true but they
04:10
must it must have been like the original
04:11
action man i guess
04:12
in america but it was called guy so it
04:14
was just like okay this is
04:15
this is a guy this is a guy and he's a
04:17
man of all your action men
04:19
no i'm just saying action man's called
04:20
action man right he's not called mark
04:22
like it's it's an action man and this
04:24
was a guy toy
04:26
you got your guy toy what is action
04:27
man's real name i don't know if actually
04:29
man has a name
04:30
that is a great that is a brilliant
04:32
question we're raising more than we're
04:33
solving today
04:34
yeah i hope it's something really
04:35
embarrassing i just walter
04:37
yeah wayne wayne man
04:42
man it's definitely his last name yeah
04:44
i've got a real name for action man
04:47
right this is in the tv series from 1995
04:50
who is a man suffering from a
04:51
amnesia who is appointed leader of team
04:53
extreme fighting against the evil doctor
04:55
x
04:56
uh he later learns his real name is
04:57
matthew xler
04:59
excellent yeah e-x-l-e-r is this tv
05:02
series canon
05:03
in the action man genre according to
05:07
action man wiki
05:08
his name as an action man toy is matthew
05:10
xler as well
05:11
i learned a good thing of things that
05:13
other things used to be called well
05:14
we're in this category oh yeah
05:16
um so sandwiches i've been researching
05:18
because obviously they're named after
05:19
but not invented by
05:20
the fourth earl of sandwich he was only
05:23
called sandwich because
05:24
his great-grandfather the first girl was
05:26
given the chance to choose a
05:27
town for the peerage to be named after
05:29
when he was given a peerage
05:30
and he chose sandwich because it's where
05:32
his fleet was anchored he was a
05:34
big admiral and he originally didn't
05:37
want to choose sandwich but he chose it
05:38
because his first choice
05:39
was portsmouth and there was already a
05:41
lord portsmouth and they had a bit of an
05:42
argument about
05:43
who would get to be the earl of fort
05:45
smith so we could all be having egg and
05:47
crest portsmouth
05:48
today how cool is that very cool yeah it
05:51
works a portsmouth i can't imagine
05:52
saying that it actually is more of a
05:53
sensible word than sandwich him and
05:55
cheese portsmouth
05:56
yes please yeah yeah that worked more
05:58
inviting yeah that felt very good
06:00
just jumping on portsmouth something
06:01
that should have had a different name as
06:03
well
06:03
gandalf the grey wasn't going to be
06:05
called gandalf the grey
06:07
what was it going to be called action
06:08
man he was going to be killed action
06:11
he was going to be called bladder thin
06:13
[Laughter]
06:15
which is not what you should call an old
06:17
man with a beard
06:18
bladder thin trouble yeah exactly
06:23
yeah b-l-a-d-o-r-t-h-i-n that was a name
06:27
that was eventually given to a dead king
06:28
who's mentioned just once
06:31
he's mentioned just one splatter thing
06:32
yeah readers didn't go for that won't
06:34
bring him back
06:34
yeah so i enjoy the battle of emoticons
06:39
where the first emoticon appeared you
06:41
know so i think we we've researched some
06:43
of this for qi last year this is related
06:44
to laws right everyone sees the link
06:46
yep so there was a smiley face
06:48
apparently in a transcript of a speech
06:50
by lincoln which is just a semicolon and
06:53
a closed bracket
06:54
so winky yeah yeah we have won the
06:56
battle of gettysburg
06:57
[Music]
06:58
does that mean he has one
07:02
i just changed the history books
07:06
that might be the most revealing thing a
07:08
document has ever shown
07:10
that was history altered that's the
07:12
equivalent of fingers crossed behind the
07:13
back
07:18
so i think it's a typo but now there's
07:20
one in 1648 which someone has found in a
07:22
1648 poem
07:23
it's called to fortune by robert herrick
07:26
it has the word smiling yet
07:28
and then it has a colon and then a
07:29
closed brackets and it is in brackets so
07:31
it's probably
07:32
also a typo uh but the first actual
07:34
emoticons definitely emoticons were in
07:35
puck weren't they in 1881. we'll put
07:37
this on the website
07:38
what's park park is a human magazine a
07:40
satirical magazine in the 19th century
07:42
and so basically it was in a joke about
07:44
how they didn't want to keep playing
07:45
cartoonists so there's quite a funny
07:47
little paragraph they say where they say
07:48
cartoonists are totally overrated we
07:50
don't need your stupid overpaid
07:52
overvalued art
07:53
we can create art just with our
07:55
typewriters and then it gives you a
07:56
smiley face a grumpy
07:58
face a bored face and a surprised face
08:00
below
08:01
created with typography and they're the
08:03
first thing
08:04
smileys 1881. and yet you would think
08:07
that
08:08
back then when it was a lot harder to
08:10
type than it is now because keyboards
08:12
were quite beefy and before that scribes
08:14
had a lot of words do you think that
08:15
emoticons would be more expedient than
08:17
they are now
08:18
now it's easier than ever to type a word
08:20
and yet people yeah yeah yeah
08:22
yeah so you're saying they were
08:23
justified in 1881 but now no get over it
08:26
yes bio tapestry could have saved a big
08:29
drawing of harold just do a winky face
08:31
actually originally meant has been shot
08:32
in eye
08:33
[Laughter]
08:36
maybe that like an hour and a night is
08:38
just typography for winky face back in
08:40
those days
08:41
that's what he was doing
08:44
[Applause]
08:48
okay time for fact number two and that's
08:50
my fact my fact this week
08:52
is according to researchers at glasgow
08:54
caledonian university
08:56
listening to billy connolly can
08:57
substantially increase your tolerance to
08:59
pain
09:00
wow is it because after you've listened
09:02
to billy connolly everything else seems
09:03
insignificant or is it that billy
09:04
connolly really distracts you from the
09:06
pain and makes you feel more positive
09:07
it's a positive thing they
09:09
it was a it was basically an ice bucket
09:10
challenge they they put patients
09:12
uh fists into buckets of ice and they
09:14
found that when they were listening to
09:15
billy conley
09:17
it actually increased the length of time
09:18
that they could keep their hand inside
09:20
there
09:20
so it distracted them it distracted them
09:22
and made them sort of enjoy
09:24
um having their fist in a bunch of
09:26
devices this is directly from an article
09:28
that announced the findings of these
09:30
scientists it's from april 7
09:31
2003 so boffins have proved that
09:33
laughter
09:36
so immediately very much a majority yeah
09:40
what are these bloody dweebs find out
09:41
though okay
09:44
nerd burgers have proved that laughter
09:46
really is the best medicine
09:48
with some help from billy conley's
09:49
stand-up routines a team of scientists
09:51
discovered that the biggian's patter
09:52
acts as a painkiller psychologists
09:54
compared people's pain thresholds while
09:56
listening to music comedy and doing
09:58
mental arithmetic
09:59
the glasgow caledonian university team
10:01
claims vintage connolly
10:02
incredible only vintage apparently none
10:04
of his music none of the new stuff
10:06
increased tolerance of pain by up to
10:08
three times i completely buy this
10:10
actually
10:11
it was a three-year study the weird
10:12
thing is that things were different for
10:14
men and women
10:15
so for women the most effective pain
10:16
relief was not actually from the comedy
10:18
it was from hearing their favorite music
10:20
and if you're allowed to choose your own
10:21
music that has an also a beneficial
10:23
effect on the kind of
10:24
there's the gateway theory isn't it
10:25
there's one theory of pain that by
10:27
blocking the pain from getting through
10:28
yeah with another stimulus yeah people
10:30
could be listening to this show whilst
10:32
having minor surgery
10:33
to take their mind off it i don't know
10:34
if our chat about doctors at the
10:35
beginning is gonna
10:37
get us into hospitals now in the uh
10:40
i think it was around 1910 or 1915 a
10:43
woman had a
10:44
a grapefruit-sized tumor removed from
10:47
her ovary she had the surgery on her
10:48
kitchen table and even though anesthesia
10:50
existed at that point
10:51
she didn't have any she just sang hymns
10:53
to stave off the pain
10:54
wow did it work well they quite well she
10:58
said now
11:00
tim has gone very high pitched and
11:01
shrieky i guess no it's definitely in
11:03
the notes
11:04
yeah yeah tip for dentists and people
11:05
carrying out minor surgery turn to him
11:07
four five four in your books
11:09
nearer my god to thee
11:16
there's no evidence that the surgeons
11:18
forced anesthesia upon this woman just
11:20
to shut her up
11:21
that'd be super distracting wouldn't it
11:23
and also it means she wouldn't be still
11:25
yeah high dental surgery that would be
11:28
really irritating wouldn't it
11:29
there are amazing things which can
11:30
increase your tolerance to pain they've
11:32
tried smells on people
11:34
and morphine
11:35
[Laughter]
11:38
they've tried working in a team so they
11:39
tested on rowers
11:41
they tried rose from the oxford boat
11:42
race squad and they they
11:44
put them in a team and they had a higher
11:46
pain threshold when they were
11:47
working together or when they had been
11:49
training together than when they were
11:50
separate so
11:51
so we're going to perform surgery on you
11:52
but if all your friends also agree to
11:54
have surgery performed on them at the
11:55
same time
11:56
it's gonna be better for you yeah yeah
11:57
maybe it just seems ruder to moan
11:59
when you know that everyone else is
12:01
feeling the same pain as you can i tell
12:02
you about one guy
12:03
football match fa cup final manchester
12:06
city birmingham in 1956
12:08
the goalkeeper from city was called bert
12:09
troutman he broke his neck after diving
12:12
for the ball
12:13
and played on he made it he made a
12:16
series of crucial saves and his team
12:18
won 3-1 wow i know
12:21
a 2006 study found that people with
12:24
migraines people who get migraines have
12:25
20 percent more sexual desire
12:28
there you go again is it to take their
12:30
minds off it
12:32
is painkilling it's just about taking
12:33
your mind off it yeah yeah tonight dear
12:35
i've got a headache
12:38
hop on
12:41
there was quite a good 2008 study at
12:43
stanford
12:45
it showed traumatic pictures to its
12:47
study participants and i just like it
12:48
sounds like a traumatic study to be
12:50
involved in
12:50
and found that if you encourage the
12:52
participants to make jokes
12:54
about the traumatic thing you were
12:55
watching then it decreased their
12:56
negative
12:57
feelings about it and if you encouraged
12:59
them to make positive jokes it really
13:00
decreased their negative feelings about
13:01
it so they were shown pictures of
13:03
this is the list ranging from car
13:04
accidents and corpses to aggressive
13:06
animals and dental exams
13:08
god but i'm so impressed that the study
13:09
participants could make funny joke if
13:11
someone says make a positive joke about
13:12
that picture of a dead person now
13:14
i'm quite impressed they all do it the
13:16
thing is kind of like mock the weak in
13:17
that sense
13:25
okay time to move on time to go to fact
13:27
number three and that is cecinski
13:30
my fact is that the first woman to cycle
13:32
around the world learn to ride a bike
13:34
the day before
13:34
she set off well she probably figured
13:36
she could pick it up on the mission
13:38
yeah you've got long enough yeah what i
13:40
like is that in the 1890s the records
13:42
for
13:42
round the world travel and the records
13:44
for cycling around the world were both
13:45
broken by women
13:46
which is quite unexpected nelly blair
13:48
was a woman who wanted to imitate
13:49
philly's fog and do around the world in
13:50
80 days
13:51
did it in 72. who was this woman who
13:53
cycled around the world she was called
13:54
annie cohen kopchovsky
13:56
she was originally latvian she was 23
13:58
years old at the time
14:00
jewish married mother of three children
14:02
lived in boston
14:03
and she just decided she was gonna do it
14:06
so she was
14:07
such an amazing character so she was a
14:09
real rappenter she told amazing stories
14:11
so it's very hard to know actually what
14:12
if her story is true and what's not
14:14
but she said you know i got on a bike
14:15
the day before had two lessons
14:17
and set off and she claimed she did this
14:19
because she'd heard these two men in a
14:21
bar
14:21
make a bet that no woman could travel
14:23
around the world on a bike and so she
14:25
decided to challenge them
14:26
and she was offered a 10 000 reward if
14:29
she made it which she did so she got
14:30
that
14:31
interestingly when she did it she wasn't
14:33
called annie cohen kopchovsky she was
14:35
called annie londonderry
14:36
because she got sponsorship from
14:39
londonderry spring water
14:40
so they paid her 100 to change her name
14:42
and have their branding on the back of
14:44
her bike
14:44
that's hilarious it's good isn't it wow
14:46
so it dates back a lot yeah
14:48
so much further than i had realized yeah
14:50
when you're cycling around the world
14:52
what are the rules about crossing water
14:55
could you do the least amount of land
14:57
cycling possible
14:58
and just take a boat from most of the
14:59
way and she did she did do a lot of
15:01
boating you would have to really because
15:02
of oceans
15:03
there was there was a very snarky thing
15:06
that was said about it
15:06
when she got back which was they said
15:08
she traveled around the world
15:10
with a bike not on a bike that's good
15:12
she was the first woman to travel around
15:14
the world with a bike
15:15
belly blind did nothing still a record
15:17
guys
15:18
yeah it's and she made up a lot of
15:20
things about her life didn't she yeah
15:22
she studied medicine for two years and
15:23
she was a married mother of three and
15:25
she was
15:26
sold in the newspaper stories as as an
15:28
unmarried and childless woman maybe she
15:30
just wanted to get away from the kids
15:31
[Laughter]
15:34
have any of you been following the
15:35
progress of mr balzy
15:37
who is a man who in order to raise
15:40
awareness of testicular cancer of which
15:41
he is
15:42
a survivor and currently in remission is
15:44
pushing
15:45
a giant inflatable testicle across the
15:48
united states
15:49
from los angeles to new york he's it
15:51
started on the third of september so
15:53
he's done a few hundred miles he's got 4
15:55
000 left to go
15:57
and he's been through some desert so
15:58
he's quite lucky that the testicle
15:59
hasn't
16:00
punctured yet we can shelter in the
16:02
shade of it though to protect himself
16:03
from the heat
16:04
how big six feet diameter
16:07
and he's just rolling it along he's
16:08
rolling it along and if you meet him
16:10
along the way then you can uh write
16:12
things on the testicle
16:13
great that's great yeah that is so mr
16:16
ballsy sounds like a good mr man as well
16:19
mr ballsy went for it he didn't care was
16:22
he called ballsy originally or was he
16:23
sponsored by the bullseye company
16:26
his name was thomas cantley but yeah
16:28
andy you were saying she made up
16:29
fantastical stories about her life this
16:30
woman and it was partly i think how she
16:32
funded her trip so she'd sell those
16:33
stories to give lectures along the way
16:35
and stuff
16:35
so a few of the things she claimed was
16:37
that she spoke several languages that
16:38
she'd been to a whole bunch of countries
16:39
that she definitely didn't go to
16:41
she'd hunted tigers with indian royalty
16:43
she was almost killed by what she called
16:45
asiatics
16:46
because they thought she was an evil
16:48
spirit she fought in the sino-japanese
16:50
war in 1895
16:52
where she fell through a frozen river
16:54
and ended up in a japanese prison with a
16:56
bullet wound in her shoulder
16:57
and then she was attacked by highway men
16:59
in marseilles wow
17:00
she was just a brilliant storytelling
17:02
people loved it not surprisingly well
17:03
you would wouldn't you if no one was
17:04
there to check
17:05
you wouldn't just say yeah it was fine
17:07
yeah i stayed in okay hotel yeah you're
17:09
right
17:09
do you think the men in the bar who were
17:11
betting that a woman could never cycle
17:12
around the world did you think they
17:13
existed or were they just a
17:15
fiction to get her to do this trip i
17:17
don't know you can imagine men betting
17:18
that
17:19
i thought the idea was that they were
17:20
just making those kind of bets and she
17:22
thought oh yeah that's
17:23
because they call it the the age of
17:25
round the world bets
17:26
no one's ever traced the men um she made
17:29
them up
17:30
yeah but nonetheless very cool i found a
17:33
lady called julianna burring was the
17:35
first lady to
17:36
cycle actually around the world and the
17:38
rules started it was in 2012
17:40
which staggers me i know yeah it's weird
17:43
isn't it you would have thought they'd
17:44
done it ages ago yeah but
17:45
when we say actually we mean without
17:46
taking a boat most of the way which
17:47
should be right is what annie
17:48
londonderry did or a brain
17:50
yeah so there are official rules about
17:52
it i think these must be guinness world
17:53
record rules
17:54
you have to cycle the same distance as
17:56
the circumference of the earth
17:57
which is 24 900 miles you have to go in
18:01
one direction and start and finish in
18:02
the same place so you are allowed to go
18:04
by sea and air
18:04
but you have to cycle at least 18 000
18:07
miles of the route
18:09
so that's the rules and she actually
18:11
miss burring she had only been riding a
18:13
road bike properly for eight months
18:14
which is not quite the same as you know
18:16
learning the day before but still
18:17
it's not much yeah she's really pro is
18:19
she wow
18:21
yeah i thought 2012 was late when women
18:23
started cycling obviously it was very
18:25
controversial in the 19th century
18:26
because it was thought of as
18:27
inappropriate
18:28
thing for women to be doing and a new
18:29
york newspaper released a list of rules
18:32
for women cycling a list of advice
18:34
which included things like don't try to
18:37
ride in your brother's clothes just to
18:38
see how it feels
18:39
[Laughter]
18:41
don't scream if you meet a cow if she
18:43
sees you first
18:44
she will run and don't use bicycle slang
18:47
leave that to the boys bicycle slash
18:49
bicycle slang
18:50
it was a very baldy language yeah it was
18:53
what about things like how not to flush
18:54
their bloomers and
18:56
well they weren't supposed to wear
18:57
bloomers at first but then they started
19:00
because they were much more sensible
19:01
a tighter than i think people wanted to
19:03
keep women wearing proper clothing
19:04
rather than
19:05
changing for cycling so they sold
19:07
special lightly boned corsets
19:09
for ladies like those of the american
19:11
lady corset company
19:13
which offered one hundred dollars of
19:15
free bicycle insurance with every biking
19:17
course it sold
19:18
also that came with the bike oh and
19:20
insurance was a massive thing you used
19:21
to get insurance if you read the daily
19:22
mail you would have insurance against
19:24
railway accidents
19:25
if you could prove it you had a copy of
19:27
the coupon from the paper on you
19:28
when you were maimed in a railway
19:30
accident then you would be given 100
19:32
pounds of insurance
19:33
wow what a handy thing to have around
19:35
yeah i love the original title of the
19:37
bicycle
19:38
because it wasn't originally called
19:39
bicycle i mean there was a more
19:40
primitive version of a bicycle yeah
19:42
called the uh velocipede yeah
19:45
isn't that great velocipede yeah it
19:48
sounds so much speedier and cooler
19:50
yeah i thought you'd say they didn't
19:52
want women to cycle because it was
19:53
dangerously liberating
19:55
you can move around more you can move to
19:57
the next village and find maybe another
19:58
man not the man that
20:00
you know your uncle wants you to marry
20:02
the thing that i love about
20:04
annie londonderry is she just it's it's
20:07
of that period i mean i think we still
20:08
have people like that living today but
20:10
when you read stories about them it's
20:11
like oh i'm gonna cycle the world oh i
20:12
don't know how to cycle
20:14
kind of thing it's just these brilliant
20:15
eccentrics who just went off and did
20:17
these
20:17
huge yeah endurance feats like mary
20:20
kingsley i look at her and just go what
20:22
an extraordinary person she
20:24
just went off and did it in a time where
20:26
she was told you shouldn't be doing that
20:28
um she was an explorer wasn't she yeah
20:29
she was an explorer she yeah yeah she
20:31
went to west africa
20:32
she used to do this thing whenever she
20:34
would rock up to
20:36
a tribe that would just you know not
20:38
necessarily had any contact and she was
20:40
told the majority of these places they
20:42
will just kill you on site
20:43
and her thing was she just didn't care
20:45
she just used to run into the villages
20:47
and just yell don't worry it's only mean
20:52
and she never she survived the board
20:53
today um
20:55
on round the world stuff another another
20:57
random connection
20:58
the first ship to travel around the
21:00
world twice was called hms dolphin it
21:03
was in the 1760s but it was captained by
21:05
lord byron's grandfather
21:06
um and he was the same guy who named and
21:09
claimed the falkland islands
21:10
so when he was on hm stove and he bumped
21:12
into the falklands went can i call this
21:14
a falcons and king george they're yours
21:16
he was very accident he was called foul
21:18
weather jack
21:19
that was his nickname and whenever he
21:20
went he had an amazing unerring knack of
21:22
sailing into massive storms and
21:24
hurricanes and tempest really
21:26
yeah so you can imagine the cruise
21:28
delight when they saw him walking up the
21:29
gangplank
21:30
oh great hey guys this is gonna be fun
21:33
hey
21:33
have you all brought your umbrellas
21:35
[Laughter]
21:38
[Applause]
21:42
okay time for our final fact of the show
21:44
and that is andy murray
21:45
okay my fact is when squirrels are
21:48
attacked by
21:48
snakes they increase their blood
21:50
pressure so much that their tail gives
21:52
off more
21:52
infrared radiation and it makes them
21:54
look bigger
21:55
that is really cool just the tail or or
21:58
the rest of the squirrel as well just
21:59
the tail really
22:00
yeah i should uh specify this is with
22:02
californian ground squirrels and it's
22:04
when they're dealing with rattlesnakes
22:05
now rattlesnakes can see in infrared
22:07
and so when they are confronted they
22:09
heat up their tail
22:10
deliberately they they increase the
22:12
temperature and then they wave it in the
22:13
snake's face
22:15
to the snake's infrared sensing organs
22:18
it looks as though there's a much larger
22:19
creature there
22:20
and when they see other snakes they
22:22
don't do it they do wave their tail
22:24
around but they know that
22:25
they can see an infrared yeah they know
22:27
the rattlesnake can see infrared even
22:29
though
22:29
the squirrel can't see an infrared it
22:32
knows the rattlesnake can and when it's
22:33
when it meets a gopher snake which can't
22:35
see an infrared
22:36
doesn't do it i mean it doesn't know it
22:38
contain infrared it's evolved to learn
22:40
that the rattlesnake doesn't like just
22:41
so maybe this is a coincidence happy
22:43
coincidence yeah
22:45
but as someone says it's not it doesn't
22:47
see a huge animal that sees a small
22:49
squirrel with a gigantic tail yeah is
22:51
that what was happening and they're
22:52
scared of tails
22:54
for goodness sake they've got their own
22:56
leaflet
22:58
there's a there's a type of squirrel
23:00
where its genitals are 40
23:01
the length of its body so i wonder
23:03
whether rattlesnakes
23:04
i'm not bothered and that squirrel uh
23:07
can autofillets yeah it gives itself
23:09
fellatio
23:11
yeah yeah that is a good claim i saw a
23:14
photo of it
23:15
and its testicles are 20 the length of
23:17
its body
23:18
and it's just outrageous if you see them
23:20
in infrared they're twice as big as that
23:22
yeah these are south african ground
23:24
squirrels someone worked out that if
23:26
if they were humans they'd have a 35
23:27
centimeter scrotum
23:29
it's inconvenient isn't it yeah on a
23:32
bicycle especially
23:34
apparently in 2007 in iran they arrested
23:37
14 squirrels on suspicion of espionage
23:40
wow that's wonderful so wait what were
23:43
the squirrels doing in iran
23:44
uh well they thought that they'd been
23:46
all kitted up by the enemy to go in and
23:49
do squirrel lesbians were they kitted up
23:51
what with magnifying glass
23:53
tooled up squirrels they've got rations
23:57
because white honest girl like carrying
23:58
an enigma machine or something i would
24:00
actually be suspicious that something
24:01
was going on yeah
24:03
someone is going to a lot of effort for
24:05
a youtube viral certainly yeah
24:07
animal defense mechanisms are
24:09
extraordinary though aren't they because
24:10
some of them some of them are obvious
24:11
like making yourself look big
24:12
but others them like there's a there's a
24:15
the horned lizard in texas can shoot
24:17
blood up to five feet out of its eyes
24:20
but then it's lost a third of its blood
24:21
so it's not exactly a fighting fit is it
24:24
it has to go up and collect all the
24:25
blood yeah but you wouldn't you wouldn't
24:27
have
24:27
if i was you know picking my own fish in
24:29
a restaurant tank
24:30
and one shot blood out of its eyes
24:32
probably pick a different fish
24:35
fair enough sea cucumbers well they
24:36
shoot their internal organs out of their
24:38
anuses
24:39
you think well that's really going to
24:40
scare an enemy isn't it oh look i've had
24:41
a prolapse get away
24:43
they shoot their intestines i mean
24:44
that's intestines they just
24:46
like that's a pretty severe bullet to
24:48
get to the face it's a bold move
24:50
it is a very bold how do you get them
24:52
back in is it like on a spring they just
24:53
grow new ones
24:54
yeah yeah cucumbers roll
24:57
cool there are squirrels which can do
25:00
other things as well so one of
25:01
um california ground squirrels they chew
25:03
on old
25:05
skins from rattlesnakes and then they
25:07
lick themselves and their pups
25:09
and this makes them smell half like a
25:12
squirrel and half like a snake
25:14
and it means that the snakes leave them
25:15
alone and they've tested on snakes
25:17
they've given them stuff that smells
25:19
like squirrels like snakes and then this
25:20
half and half mix and they only go for
25:22
the stuff which take
25:23
which smells exclusively like a squirrel
25:25
so that's how they protect themselves
25:26
other ones have ultrasound
25:28
squirrels are incredible what's the
25:29
thing you were telling me about eagles
25:30
the other day with squirrels oh yeah
25:32
they uh
25:32
if they're being hunted by a bird of
25:33
prey they will go round and round a tree
25:35
very fast to disorient the bird which
25:37
will sort of just start spiraling and
25:38
then crash into the branches of the tree
25:40
and be embarrassed i'll have to leave
25:42
because of its embarrassment how could
25:43
they just they're amazing that sounds
25:45
like something out of a cartoon
25:46
it does isn't it sure squirrels versus
25:49
rattlesnakes does seem like a classic
25:50
cartoon setup oh they've got to do that
25:53
in the like alien vs predator series and
25:55
their whole series of films i've got to
25:56
do
25:57
yeah and it wouldn't be much worse than
25:59
the most recent alien vs predator films
26:02
so is it definitely that it's not an
26:04
intimidation thing to the rattlesnake
26:05
it's that they think it's bigger
26:07
because i read a thing where it said
26:08
that what it in fact does it says to the
26:10
rattlesnake
26:11
that i know that you're there ah rather
26:13
than being a sort of like whoa that's a
26:15
big squirrel better not
26:16
mess with that one i don't know if they
26:18
know exactly what effect they think
26:19
they're having on the rattlesnake
26:21
whether it's yeah attack or defense or
26:23
anything like that but yeah it seems to
26:25
have an
26:25
and the desired effect yeah okay yeah it
26:28
would just probably shock them in the
26:29
same way that
26:29
cats do it i mean lots of animals do it
26:31
don't they that's why we get goosebumps
26:33
well they think that so we look bigger
26:34
yeah yeah so it's not the
26:36
the hair right it's a most from when we
26:38
were covered in hair okay people think
26:40
if you're getting
26:40
shots all the all the hairs rise up yeah
26:42
yeah yeah and therefore you look
26:44
slightly bigger and more intimidating
26:45
i mean i agree it's a [ __ ] defense
26:46
mechanism well you look like you've just
26:47
been blow-dried
26:49
yeah and that's scary and that's scary
26:51
yeah that is scary he looks after
26:52
himself but he knows a fight
26:55
yeah that's true speaking of things that
26:57
uh shoot out of the
26:58
eyeballs so the the toad you were just
27:00
talking about and do you guys know about
27:01
the mongolian death worm
27:03
no okay so no one's technically seen a
27:05
mongolian death warrior
27:06
okay they're made up death worms yes
27:08
like yetis and brian blessed they don't
27:09
exist
27:10
it is a cryptid there are people in
27:11
mongolia who claim totina is definitely
27:13
a cryptid but what i like about it is
27:14
its defense mechanism is that it can
27:16
shoot acid
27:17
from its eyes uh and lightning bolts
27:19
from its ass
27:20
what yeah yeah this made up creature can
27:23
shoot lightning
27:24
sorry who came up with with this it's a
27:26
mongolian uh
27:27
fiction fiction right
27:31
yeah that is incredible we should be
27:33
able to utilize that in science somehow
27:36
yeah lightning from an anus it's like
27:38
dan's crypto corner isn't it every week
27:40
and if you spot where it is you let us
27:42
know and you'll win a book
27:44
there's a particular kind of ant that
27:45
can shoot a nuclear holocaust
27:50
there is a termite though that explodes
27:52
if you're eating it so if it gets eaten
27:54
by its prey it kind of suicide bombs
27:56
itself
27:56
and it takes out the prey that's eating
27:59
it there we are and see through
28:00
fiction we've found our way back to
28:02
facts
28:05
can i tell you one more thing about
28:06
squirrels yeah okay so there are there
28:08
are arctic ground squirrels and
28:10
they hibernate for eight months of the
28:11
year but when they're hibernating
28:14
their body temperature drops to minus
28:16
three degrees
28:17
celsius which is the lowest body
28:19
temperature any mammal has ever been
28:21
recorded as having as in right in the
28:22
middle his core is minus three
28:24
how do they do that well some fish do
28:26
the same thing it's called being super
28:27
cooled
28:28
and they they live in sub-zero
28:30
temperatures but
28:31
they know how the fish do it because
28:32
they have a kind of anti-freeze in their
28:34
blood but the the squirrels don't
28:36
don't have that so they have no idea how
28:38
they do it also on squirrels
28:40
they plant more trees than humans do
28:43
because
28:44
74 percent of the nuts they bury they
28:46
forget where they put them
28:47
wow idiots idiots
28:51
because they're too busy
28:55
um goosebumps which we weren't talking
28:57
about um
28:58
great books yeah excellent tweeted me
29:01
once
29:02
that was the most exciting moment well i
29:03
tweeted him first he tweeted that did he
29:05
just tweet you saying woo
29:06
[Laughter]
29:10
sorry
29:12
[Laughter]
29:15
but goosebumps are called hen bumps in
29:18
french and spanish chicken bumps in
29:20
dutch and chinese and duck bumps in
29:21
hebrew
29:23
but there's a real poultry theme there's
29:25
definitely a theme everyone's got the
29:26
same idea
29:27
and they've just gone to slightly
29:28
different ways cold turkey has something
29:31
to do with that as well
29:32
when people are coming off drugs they
29:33
get massive goosebumps and people like
29:34
well that's like when you've got a
29:36
turkey that you've plucked oh really
29:39
okay turkeys which have been plucked do
29:41
look like that
29:42
like like heroin addicts
29:48
pete dockerty's uh look
29:51
put pete in the oven for four hours

00:21
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:24
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:26
covent garden
00:27
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
00:28
here with three of the regular elves
00:29
it's andy murray anna chazinski and
00:32
james harkin
00:32
and once again we've gathered around
00:34
with our favorite four facts from the
00:36
last week
00:36
and here they are in no particular order
00:41
andy murray my fact is that over a
00:43
hundred people used to watch king louis
00:44
xiv
00:45
get up and get dressed every day did he
00:47
know they were there
00:48
yes he did so was it like a window no
00:51
people would come into his bedroom and
00:52
watch him hundreds this
00:54
is a ceremony called the levee as in the
00:56
french verb for getting up and
00:58
it was kind of to ease the king into the
01:00
day that would be quite good if you got
01:02
up in the morning and brush your teeth
01:04
and you got a big round of applause that
01:05
would really
01:06
help your day start yeah and people came
01:08
to see him while he was having his
01:09
breakfast so
01:10
a few people would come in when he was
01:11
still in bed at eight o'clock and he
01:14
would be woken up and his nurse
01:15
would kiss him his childhood nurse and
01:17
his chamber potter would be removed and
01:19
then
01:20
this ceremony started which took an hour
01:22
and a half and he would have his
01:23
hands washed in wine he picked a wig he
01:26
was given his slippers and dressing gown
01:27
his hand washed in wine
01:29
yeah yeah he washed his hands in wine
01:30
why would he do that no idea stinky
01:32
hands the whole day
01:33
spartans used to wash newborn babies and
01:35
wine it was one of the first things that
01:37
happened to them as they got a bucket of
01:38
wine and washed in them yeah wow
01:40
so some and sometimes he would just go
01:42
to the corner and and have a wee in the
01:44
chamber pot with no
01:45
embarrassment or inhibition well we've
01:47
done on this podcast haven't we how he
01:48
liked to defecate in public
01:50
was that him yes that was having like
01:52
two
01:56
suggested that toilet cubicles are
01:57
becoming you know no no
02:00
no i like to put in public the really
02:03
amazing thing is where the bit where
02:04
they dress him
02:05
so two officials took the sleeves of his
02:07
night shirt
02:08
and started to pull it off him while
02:10
another courtier brought a fresh and
02:12
pre-warmed
02:13
shirt to the king and then two other
02:16
people this is four and five
02:17
had to hold up the king's dressing gown
02:19
as a curtain so people didn't get a
02:21
glimpse of
02:22
um you know so quick question uh back
02:24
then how do you pre-warm something
02:26
do you hold it over an oven do you like
02:28
a mirror of fire or maybe
02:29
you can warm up irons can't you and then
02:31
you can press the other one i've been
02:32
worn by someone for a little
02:33
yeah that's what i was thinking because
02:34
if it was a fire then you're going to
02:36
get the wood smell
02:37
this guy must have been the smelliest
02:38
man this is the smelling of
02:40
that what that sounds like is he wakes
02:42
up and he gets dressed as a walk of
02:44
shame
02:46
smelling of booze and fire i read
02:48
something about
02:49
microbiomes this is off topic but what
02:52
it is is
02:53
if you go into your house you leave
02:56
microbes everywhere
02:57
and they're specific to you so my house
03:00
will have a certain microbiome
03:02
and then you'll have one that's
03:03
completely different but the interesting
03:04
thing is if i if we went to stay in a
03:06
hotel
03:07
you would only have to be in that hotel
03:09
for 24 hours before the microbiome of
03:12
that hotel room is indistinguishable
03:14
from your house
03:15
wow that's how much they all go from one
03:18
place to another
03:19
if only like dogs we could use them to
03:20
mark our territory then we'd
03:22
claim ownership of everywhere then we
03:24
might have a bit more of this planet
03:25
than we already do
03:28
i'm getting sick of the swans taking
03:30
bits of my
03:31
land by right um going back to louis
03:35
i really like the fact that so it's part
03:37
of the le ceremony and the is it the
03:39
kouche ceremony when he goes to bed
03:41
yeah does that not mean yeah
03:44
just means go to bed yes there was a
03:45
couche ceremony yeah that he obviously
03:48
had his private chamber where he
03:49
actually slept and then he had his bed
03:50
chamber where all of the people used to
03:52
do all this stuff so he would be woken
03:54
up in his private chamber at let's say 7
03:56
30 a.m
03:57
and then escorted to his the public
03:59
chamber which also has a bed in it
04:01
and have to sit in bed and sort of fake
04:03
that he was being woken up out of bed
04:04
and then to go back to bed
04:06
to have this whole couches ceremony
04:07
around him they take his clothes they
04:08
put his nightgown he climbs into bed
04:10
they kiss him good night they tell him a
04:11
little rhyme
04:12
he does a fake snore and then he has to
04:14
get out of the display bed and walk down
04:17
the corridor to his private bed chamber
04:19
to actually go to sleep
04:20
and louis the 15th really didn't like
04:22
these ceremonies and so he would get up
04:23
in the morning and go hunting for a
04:25
couple of hours first
04:26
and then sneak back in and pretend to
04:27
get us asleep that's amazing
04:29
it sounds like a real hassle what if you
04:31
just want to get downstairs yeah
04:33
it sounds like a complete pain did
04:34
anyone else get it was it just
04:36
specifically him no his descendants did
04:38
it lasted for centuries yeah
04:40
sorry though what i mean is oh anyone
04:42
outside of the king well what i read is
04:43
that some of his courtiers who came to
04:45
that ceremony had their own levy
04:46
ceremonies in their own house earlier in
04:48
the day
04:49
oh my god oh my god i'm the dresser the
04:51
dresser of the dresser the dresser of
04:52
the dresser of the king
04:53
i know it caught on so it became
04:55
fashionable with charles ii in england i
04:56
think so the french really went for it
04:58
and then we picked up on it
04:59
and you used to be able to watch king's
05:00
eating as well they used to have public
05:02
galleries you could walk through
05:04
some i can't remember which historian it
05:06
is but someone calculated that louis the
05:08
14th would have eaten between getting up
05:10
and going to bed
05:10
30 different dishes in the course of the
05:12
day just constantly being fed
05:14
his life sounds like it sounds like
05:17
salvador dali has designed his life
05:19
surrealist nightmare do you know about
05:22
the
05:23
woman's rebellion in the time of the
05:25
14th
05:26
this was the introduction of chocolate
05:28
in the court of louis
05:29
and uh it was a new thing people were
05:31
drinking chocolate
05:32
when the washer ladies first saw the
05:34
brown stains on the fine white damask
05:37
table napkins
05:38
they refuse to touch them i mean going
05:40
on what anna said about louis the 14th
05:42
behavior in the corridors of versailles
05:44
probably probably
05:45
a reasonable assumption yeah and the
05:47
other interesting thing about louis xiv
05:49
i always like is
05:50
this guy called ustash dasher so this is
05:53
a prisoner
05:54
of louis he was transferred from prison
05:57
to prison all over france for 34 years
05:59
he had to wear a mask the whole time a
06:02
black velvet mask
06:03
he was told that if he said anything
06:05
other than food or water he was to be
06:07
killed on the spot
06:08
and no one knows who he was or anything
06:10
like that and there's
06:11
loads of conspiracy theories in french
06:13
history about whether he was
06:15
louie's twin brother or he was the son
06:18
of the king of england
06:19
and hence the man in the iron mart
06:21
brilliantly and is that is that who he
06:23
is
06:23
he's the man in the iron mask well
06:24
that's the idea that duma had
06:26
came from that he popularized champagne
06:28
didn't he him and dom perignon got
06:30
together decided they loved wine from
06:31
the champagne region even though it
06:32
wasn't ever fizzy and it was like a real
06:34
guy
06:34
yeah uh he was a monk yeah dummy
06:37
that's like nachos being invented by mr
06:40
nacho
06:41
now buy a guy called ignacio oh it's not
06:43
chipper oh that's good
06:44
king louis xiv probably only liked
06:46
champagne because he thought it got the
06:47
germs off his hands better
06:48
yeah this is great wine dom perignon i
06:52
love it
06:52
oh he took it as a cure for his gout
06:55
yeah which obviously didn't work
06:57
that's right but don't the bane of dom
06:58
perignon's life was the fact he couldn't
07:00
get these bloody bubbles out of
07:01
champagne well enough so you know they
07:03
they would try to make it as flat as
07:04
possible and it was only after louie
07:06
died that people decided to start
07:07
drinking it sparkling
07:08
i have a cool fact about champagne which
07:10
is that in the days before
07:12
toughened glass bottles used to explode
07:14
at the slightest provocation and you had
07:16
to wear
07:17
an iron mask to go into the wine cellar
07:20
and wine champagne makers would lose
07:22
sometimes up to a third of their bottles
07:24
because obviously it can be a chain
07:25
reaction
07:26
if one goes then all the others around
07:27
it might go as well so yeah you had
07:30
you see these incredible outfits that
07:31
they had to put on big heavy gloves
07:33
oh no someone's ordered champagne again
07:37
put the radiation suit on yeah
07:40
um louis xiv ruled for so long that
07:43
his successor was his great grandson he
07:45
outlived his oldest son
07:47
and his oldest grandson ruled for 72
07:49
years
07:50
i like louis what else has he done he
07:52
wasn't a nice guy particularly he was
07:53
extraordinarily lavish i mean he robbed
07:55
his own people in order to fund his
07:57
spending habits and in fact
07:59
that's where we get another piece of
08:00
etymology the word silhouette
08:02
so that comes from louis xiv reign
08:04
because
08:05
etienne de silhouette was the finance
08:08
minister
08:08
and so he was the guy who organized
08:10
attacks the people a lot and especially
08:12
the rich so that louis could have
08:13
expensive habits and you're wondering
08:15
how the hell we got silhouette from here
08:17
that meant that rich people who used to
08:18
get their portraits painted couldn't
08:20
afford to do that anymore
08:21
and their replacement for that was just
08:23
having silhouettes of themselves drawn
08:24
and it was called silhouettes because it
08:26
was like it became a byword for
08:27
on the cheap because we can't afford
08:29
this yeah yeah and so
08:31
he as well as there being a man called
08:32
don perrion there was a man called
08:34
silhouette
08:35
gender silhouette and don pereira
08:36
hanging out with louie together yeah
08:39
that needs to be written
08:40
like burns sideburns and named after a
08:43
guy called burnside
08:44
really yeah he was the first song he was
08:46
the first head of the nra burnside
08:47
wasn't he
08:48
don't forget hank krispy kreme
08:52
i thought it was crispy cream that would
08:55
have been a lot better
08:57
anyway yeah sorry to derail it with that
08:59
just there's a man called silhouette
09:01
yeah i like that right i think the only
09:02
image we have of him is a silhouette
09:05
is that right no you heard me say his
09:08
name
09:09
stopped listening i'm pretty sure
09:11
everything is that
09:12
that is exactly what i did
09:15
okay time for fact number two and that
09:17
is james
09:18
okay my fact is that there is an
09:20
original picasso
09:22
that no one will ever see because it was
09:24
eaten by the dog
09:25
by the dog was this in the door
09:28
that was picasso's jazz friend to the
09:30
dog
09:31
there was a dog called lump who was
09:34
named after the german word for rascal
09:36
the dog lived with picasso for six years
09:38
and one day he
09:40
drew a picture of a rabbit which if it
09:43
was still around there would be worth
09:44
tens of thousands of pounds
09:45
but the dog carried it into the garden
09:47
and ate it because he thought it was an
09:49
actual rabbit because we've all seen
09:50
picasso's paintings and they're not as
09:52
realistic as that would imply
09:54
that's true that's true yeah didn't
09:56
picasso
09:57
maybe he was a bit of a dodgy character
09:59
who was lying about the whole dog
10:00
thing because he was a bit dodgy he was
10:02
purported to have stolen the mona lisa
10:04
at one point wasn't he wasn't he the
10:05
prime suspect
10:06
he was definitely interrogated about it
10:07
and now i think he's the
10:09
artist with the most works of art stolen
10:11
of any artist
10:12
i think there was something like 1100
10:14
works of picasso original picassos
10:16
around the world
10:17
so if you spot all stolen by dogs oh
10:20
yeah he did burn a lot of his work when
10:21
he was younger went because he was too
10:23
cold
10:23
and um too poor to afford proper heating
10:26
and he had all these sheets of paper
10:28
with drawings on he just burnt them
10:30
do you remember hearing that thing about
10:32
picasso that he had two mistresses and
10:34
they came to his house
10:35
and they said oh you have to choose
10:38
between us
10:39
and he said no you need to fight it out
10:42
and then he just sat there and let them
10:43
fight
10:43
brilliant the only man who could get
10:45
away with that yeah wow
10:47
and you can hang your clothes up over
10:48
there corner of the room
10:51
sotheby's once won a 20 million dollar
10:53
contract
10:54
to sell a collection of picassos and van
10:56
gogh if they won a game of
10:58
scissors paper rock hold on sorry
11:00
sotheby's won the game of scissors i
11:01
don't understand how
11:03
versus christie's and they'd both gotten
11:06
like the contract at the same time they
11:07
didn't know who was going to get it and
11:09
so
11:09
they just did a game of rock paper
11:11
scissors all of them all the staff
11:12
lining up opposite each other mr sotheby
11:14
against mr chris mr christie
11:16
mr sotheby one steinbeck's dog at his
11:19
first draft of of mice and men
11:21
really really yeah that's happened oh
11:24
wow do you know where the
11:25
rumor of the dog eating one's homework
11:27
first came from
11:29
no apparently it's from i think it was
11:31
1901 and it was in a welsh village and
11:33
there was a stand-in vicar
11:35
and he was reading out his sermons at
11:37
the end and then he felt like his
11:38
sermons had been too short and he hadn't
11:40
prepared enough
11:40
so he went back into the vestry to talk
11:42
to one of the clerics afterwards and
11:43
apologized and said he dropped some of
11:45
it on the way and the dog ate half of
11:46
his sermon
11:47
if you are interested in dogs the
11:48
wikipedia list of individual dogs is
11:50
unbelievably good is divided into
11:53
actors athletes faithful dogs working
11:55
dogs
11:56
other heroic dogs dogs of unusual size
11:59
which is divided i kid you not into
12:01
small dogs heavy dogs and tall dogs
12:04
also space dogs is one of them okay yeah
12:07
lyca
12:08
and so on intelligent dogs notorious
12:11
dogs
12:11
ugly dogs unique dogs what's a unique
12:14
dog every dog is unique dan
12:16
fame by proxy that's a famous bliss
12:20
did you see that in the news this week
12:21
about the russian biggest lender in
12:23
russia
12:24
if you get a mortgage with them you get
12:25
a free cat i however they lend it to you
12:28
so that you can be photographed with it
12:29
in your new home because well
12:31
it's like there's supposed to be a thing
12:32
about good luck in russia yeah
12:34
if it's quite true but that you the
12:36
first to go into house should be a cat
12:38
did you know that builders used to wall
12:40
up cats inside buildings that they were
12:42
working on no i didn't know that
12:43
they've been found when you do
12:44
renovations you often find a mummified
12:46
cat
12:47
in the walls of a property they also put
12:49
shoes in didn't they in the walls
12:51
yeah and there's a guy who collects all
12:52
the times when they've been mentioned
12:54
and has a big long list online of all
12:56
the
12:56
secret shoes that are in is that just
12:58
for fun is that some sort of
13:00
in-builder's good
13:01
superstition the first cat mentioned in
13:04
an
13:04
english witch trail wasn't black it was
13:06
white and spotty
13:07
was it and was that bad at the time the
13:09
nature it wasn't a dalmatian well the
13:10
reason
13:11
how good were they identifying well the
13:13
reason they knew it was a witch's cat is
13:15
because
13:15
it would talk to her and it was called
13:18
satan said
13:20
two obvious clues yeah um apparently
13:23
white cats with blue eyes
13:25
are deaf yeah most of them are i think
13:27
and also almost all tartar shells are
13:29
female
13:30
what yeah that's amazing yeah um just
13:33
back to the paintings very quickly
13:35
there's also a painting that we do have
13:37
but we're never gonna
13:38
see the proper original of it's the
13:41
three bronte sisters
13:42
sitting in this painting and it was
13:44
painted by bramwell their brother
13:45
and it's the only drawing that we have
13:47
of the bronte sisters the interesting
13:49
thing about it is that bramwell used to
13:51
be in it
13:52
he painted himself into the drawing but
13:54
he lost confidence in himself
13:57
so he painted over himself by putting a
14:00
pillar
14:00
just this huge pillar randomly in the
14:03
painting and it was only when they
14:04
looked closer at it that you could see
14:06
you know peeking out yeah yeah yeah
14:09
crying man behind the pillow that's a
14:11
bit like i think it's bruegel's painting
14:13
massacre of the innocence
14:14
it was commissioned by a king but he
14:16
wanted to make a political point about
14:17
how
14:18
inhumane is mascot been so the painting
14:20
looks like a beautiful snow
14:21
scene and there's just piles of snow
14:23
everywhere and snow just falling down
14:25
everywhere and children playing
14:26
and then if you look they've done x-rays
14:28
of the paint and if you look behind all
14:29
the snow there's
14:30
countless dead bodies everywhere oh wow
14:33
there was the painting that they just
14:34
found recently they did a restoration on
14:36
this painting which was of a beach scene
14:38
and there was a crowd of people
14:39
stadigrad area they didn't know why
14:41
and then when they restored it it
14:43
revealed a beached whale
14:45
like a ginormous whale just laying there
14:48
which has obviously come on to the shore
14:51
well and someone had painted over that
14:52
it was seen as being a bit unfashionable
14:54
and a bit a bit weird to have
14:55
this big whale in the paintings on wales
14:58
there was a news story recently and
14:59
apparently this happens quite a lot of
15:00
when you get a big beached whale
15:02
it can fill up with gas and it gets like
15:04
really really inflated and really tense
15:06
and then if you slightly prick it i mean
15:08
you've got to kind of
15:09
break the well in order to dispose it it
15:11
completely explodes and so there's
15:13
footage of whales that explode that
15:14
innards all over there's some videos on
15:16
youtube
15:17
some really good really entertaining
15:18
videos yeah i have the best thing about
15:20
beached whales it's about well i've been
15:22
reading this book whales bones of the
15:23
british isles
15:24
by a guy who has spent 30 years
15:27
traveling around
15:28
finding whales draw bones in arches and
15:30
things like that and yeah as gate posts
15:32
and his umbrella stands and all of these
15:34
things
15:34
in 1897 a whale was stranded near
15:36
bournemouth and it began to make this
15:38
terrible smell
15:39
and according to the newspapers one
15:41
somerset farm laborer
15:42
climbed up on top of the body and
15:43
declared i've come 40 miles to see this
15:46
here whale
15:46
and i'm going to walk from his head to
15:48
his tail he started on his walk but the
15:50
carcass had for some days been
15:51
undergoing a softening process
15:54
and the surface giving way like rotten
15:55
ice the adventurous laborer sank into
15:57
the blubber
15:58
and was subsequently extricated from his
16:00
unpleasant surroundings a sadder if not
16:03
a wiser man
16:08
time for fact number three that's my
16:09
fact my fact this week uh during world
16:12
war ii
16:12
the u.s navy diving manual contained
16:14
detailed instructions for what to do
16:16
if eaten by a giant clam
16:20
yeah die with dignity
16:22
[Laughter]
16:23
you're supposed to basically you're
16:25
supposed to have very heavy-duty
16:26
scissors and cut
16:27
its muscles from inside the mouth i like
16:30
because it was you who originally found
16:31
this fact and when i said it to you
16:32
yesterday i was like oh where did you
16:34
get this back from you
16:35
oh it was a book what was it called
16:36
again it took you a few seconds a few
16:38
beats
16:39
oh yeah it's called eaten by a giant
16:41
clam
16:42
didn't even open the book joseph cummins
16:44
if anyone wants to read it great yeah
16:45
it's really interesting but actually the
16:48
way to get away from a giant climb is
16:50
just to pull your hand out because
16:51
they don't close fully do they yeah so
16:54
you can't be eaten by a giant clam
16:55
yeah there is a crustacean they found
16:57
recently i can't remember what it's
16:59
called
17:00
which its teeth are the hardest known
17:02
substance that nature produces
17:04
it's got these black jutting out teeth
17:06
wow maybe i'll see your teeth and i'll
17:07
raise you ray windstone
17:10
we should say we are a far bigger threat
17:12
to giant clams than they are to us we've
17:13
overfished them
17:14
horribly and so now they're critically
17:16
endangered in lots of places it's
17:18
amazing how long they take to grow as
17:19
well it takes them 11 months to get to
17:20
just a couple of inches across
17:22
and then to get one up to the weight of
17:23
five pounds it takes seven years
17:26
so really big ones that you see on the
17:27
ocean floor could be 50 years old or
17:30
70 or 80. i've seen it all they've seen
17:32
it all well they've seen a very very
17:34
tiny bit of it all
17:35
the largest giant clams in history can
17:37
be found
17:38
under london wow really yeah
17:41
they're fossils they're not still alive
17:44
i know ceramics they're called
17:46
and they can be found in the cretaceous
17:48
gold clay underneath london and they
17:50
were as big as two meters
17:52
in size wow the height of a door i think
17:54
the largest one ever
17:55
found was in japan and it weighed 730
17:58
pounds which is about
18:00
as much as four adult men which is it's
18:02
big enough that you can understand why
18:04
people slightly thought it was
18:04
threatening but it's quite fun to google
18:06
if you do a google book search for giant
18:08
clams and then you
18:09
refine it to the 19th century that is
18:11
quite entertaining because there are a
18:12
lot of books of popular science which
18:14
warn of the dangers of being
18:15
eaten by a giant clam journal of popular
18:17
science from
18:19
1896 which talks about how if you're
18:21
diving
18:22
a slack line or pipe may fall into the
18:24
jaws of a giant clam which close over it
18:26
and hold the diver prisoner to his death
18:28
alone in the dim ocean depths or the
18:31
biggest
18:31
pearl ever found was inside a giant clam
18:34
the pearl of
18:35
lao tzu and it was found by william cobb
18:37
and he claimed that when
18:39
they found that it was a guy was killed
18:41
by a giant clan when they were trying to
18:43
find the
18:44
oh yeah i read that account yeah
18:45
apparently what happened was this
18:47
guy he was a direct diver and he went
18:50
down grabbed a hold of the pearl
18:52
it closed and then he wouldn't let go of
18:54
the pearl and he stayed there and
18:55
drowned
18:56
do you know about the oldest clam ever
18:58
unsurprisingly we only know because we
19:00
killed it
19:00
because that's what we do a group of
19:02
researchers in iceland they
19:04
fished a load of clams up and it turns
19:06
out that he was 507 years old
19:10
when they took him up he was born in
19:13
1499.
19:14
isn't that amazing what would have been
19:15
happening in 1419 well they called it
19:17
ming because that was ming dynasty china
19:19
how many
19:19
started at dynasty yeah henry the
19:21
seventh had been king for a little while
19:23
the battle of bosworth
19:24
was a recent memory 1885 yeah i mean you
19:26
probably didn't have
19:27
the recent memory of the battle of
19:28
buzzfeed i've got no evidence he
19:30
actually fought there
19:32
it'd be the one sort of like longevity
19:34
diary that if you got hold of it just be
19:36
boring dark oh mate you went through a
19:38
lot and we've just got off
19:40
filtered filtered some more yeah yeah
19:42
yeah 396.
19:43
grew another ring yeah 397.
19:47
females in one oh sorry females is wrong
19:50
obviously because they're hermaphrodites
19:51
aren't they so
19:52
they are male and female but they can't
19:53
fertilize themselves so they just spurt
19:55
out their eggs and sperm into the water
19:57
and they let them find each other but
19:59
they can eject in one egg ejection 500
20:01
million eggs which is quite impressive
20:03
whoa
20:03
so there's a lot of also they 98
20:07
of them do start as men as well and then
20:10
they they just transfer
20:11
into whatever sex they want to a bit
20:13
later leeches do that as well
20:15
um speaking of sea life actually i would
20:17
urge people to look up blue lobsters so
20:20
i didn't realize that one in two million
20:22
lobsters
20:23
is born bright blue and so this is
20:25
really exciting for
20:26
lobster catchers when they come across
20:27
them and they are like properly bright
20:29
blue and then one in 30 million is
20:31
bright yellow
20:32
which i think it's what is going on well
20:34
what what gives just a random mutation
20:36
okay right if you search on the
20:37
wikipedia for unique lobsters
20:39
yes again a massive list tall lobsters
20:44
heavy lobsters space lobsters
20:47
space lobsters that's a movie yeah
20:50
the smallest species of giant clam is
20:53
called the boring
20:54
clan because it balls into the coral oh
20:58
this is also cool they found the fossil
21:00
of
21:00
not a shellfish from a long time ago but
21:03
a shark from a long time ago which they
21:05
think ate shellfish because it had these
21:06
massive tooth plates which it probably
21:08
used to crush
21:09
things like giant clams it was a 10
21:11
meter long
21:12
shark they found it in kansas the fossil
21:15
of it isn't that amazing uh just back
21:16
very quickly to the fact that the royal
21:18
navy did put how to escape a giant clam
21:20
into their booklet i do love when you
21:22
just read stories of silliness that
21:23
seemed silly to us but maybe made sense
21:25
at the time
21:26
to the people and i've got a story here
21:28
which is an old qi fact but it's
21:30
that in 1993 an army bomb disposal unit
21:33
was called to investigate a suspicious
21:35
looking package
21:36
outside the ta unit in bristol they blew
21:38
it up with a controlled explosion
21:40
but only to discover that it was a
21:41
parcel of leaflets explaining how to
21:43
deal with suspicious packages
21:46
excellent yeah yeah um yeah i like funny
21:49
labels and unnecessary labels on
21:51
products like i think we talked before
21:53
about the do not eat the ipod shuffle
21:55
but yeah
21:56
there are other good ones there's a uh a
21:58
packet of screwdrivers which is sold in
22:00
america where there's the warning at the
22:02
top says
22:03
not to be inserted into penis which is
22:06
great
22:08
i don't believe why don't you believe it
22:11
you think you should
22:12
it clearly belongs there and he runs to
22:15
the bathroom
22:17
by that logic almost everything in the
22:18
world should have that label on it
22:20
except possibly medical swabs and even
22:23
they should be labeled only sometimes in
22:25
certain penis
22:26
we've covered before that alfred kinsey
22:28
the sex researcher yeah
22:29
okay all right all right maybe it didn't
22:32
say on his toothbrush
22:36
or maybe as where he gripped it it wore
22:38
away the do not over time
22:40
hang on what's this label
22:44
okay time for the final fact of the show
22:46
and it
22:47
is anna chazinski my fact yep
22:50
is that a hundred used to be 120
22:53
what do you mean ah well that's a great
22:55
question dan
22:56
i mean that well i mean a couple of
22:58
things so the word 100
23:00
derives from an old northward hundrath
23:03
which literally meant 120 and when
23:06
people referred to 100 throughout the
23:08
middle ages and
23:09
up until the 17th century in a lot of
23:10
cases they actually meant 120 because
23:13
we worked especially before the 14th
23:15
century on a duo decimal system or a
23:18
base 12 system rather than a decimal
23:20
system as we do now so everything was
23:21
divisible by 12.
23:22
is it true that they said a small
23:24
hundred when they meant a hundred
23:26
yeah and they said a hundred or a long
23:28
hundred or a great hundred
23:30
for 120. yeah it's so weird so when you
23:33
saw like the roman numeral c
23:34
throughout medieval times that would
23:36
usually refer to 120 not 100.
23:39
but it wasn't actually that regular and
23:41
so 100 can mean various different things
23:42
depending on what you're referring to
23:44
so if you were counting drinking glasses
23:47
or gunpowder weight then if you said 100
23:49
then that would be
23:50
100 but if you were counting eggs or
23:52
pins or fish
23:54
if you said 100 that would be 120 but
23:55
then there were some commodities for
23:57
which it was neither so apparently
23:59
in roxburg shear and sell cook sheer a
24:01
hundred sheep or lambs was actually 106.
24:06
and it was 100 for dried fish in some
24:09
places was actually 160 and if you were
24:11
talking about onions and garlic and you
24:12
said 100 it was 225.
24:15
so god knows how the hell anyone knew
24:17
how much they'd ordered of anything
24:19
interestingly a thousand comes from
24:20
exactly the same etymological route as a
24:22
hundred
24:23
so thousand literally means a strong
24:25
hundred and again in medieval times a
24:27
thousand was one thousand two hundred
24:29
usually because it was
24:30
a strong hundred it was ten times a
24:31
hundred which was 120. so to be clear it
24:33
wasn't it could be 12 times
24:35
yeah so it's not so i was going to say
24:36
to be clear it wasn't a completely
24:38
geodecimal system it was sort of a half
24:40
and half
24:40
so it wasn't all divided by i think
24:42
we've established this was not a system
24:43
of any kind
24:45
at all yeah it didn't have a lot of
24:46
binding logical rules to it no
24:48
this is why no one got anything done
24:49
until about 1800 and then we all sorted
24:52
out the numbers and we found coal
24:53
and then we got on with the industrial
24:55
revolution there is a tribe in the
24:56
amazon it's the
24:58
manduruku manduriko tribe and they only
25:01
count
25:01
up to six and as soon as they get up to
25:03
six the next number just becomes
25:05
many so if you're having like a dinner
25:07
party and there's like how many people
25:08
are coming it's
25:09
as many it's like cool i appreciate that
25:11
but i need to set out some chairs james
25:13
what's the thing about
25:14
chinese use it's a counting system in
25:16
china and they use all the bones
25:18
each knuckle is worth three things
25:20
because i think you have like three
25:21
lines on your knuckles or something and
25:22
they can count up to about a million
25:24
with that
25:25
the venerable bead had a good way of
25:26
counting he could count to a million by
25:28
moving his hands up and down his body
25:31
oh yeah oh yeah we've heard this all
25:33
before every 16 year old boy
25:35
just counting his number for 90 000 for
25:39
instance was represented
25:41
by grasping your lines with your left
25:43
hand with your thumb towards the
25:45
genitals
25:46
there's a great one called the yup no in
25:47
in papua new guinea it's a
25:49
aboriginal tribe and they have a
25:51
counting system that goes up to 33
25:53
but they use their body like the way
25:55
that we use our fingers to count to ten
25:57
uh they go further and but there's a
26:00
logical kind of step for each one so
26:02
they count
26:02
ten on their fingers and then their toes
26:04
take them up to twenty
26:06
then their ears eyes nose and nostrils
26:08
take them to 27
26:10
and then their left nipple is 28 right
26:12
nipple 29
26:13
belly button 30. i don't like where this
26:15
is going
26:16
it heads into man territory uh left
26:18
testicle 31
26:20
right testicle 32 penis 33. so women
26:23
just can't count as high
26:24
they have they get up to 27
26:26
unfortunately they're stuck well they've
26:28
got nipples
26:28
to 30 to 30. uh that'd be fantastic in
26:32
bingo calling
26:33
right testicle 32
26:36
i've just found the fact of the chinese
26:38
and counting using their finger joints
26:40
so it's not a million that they can get
26:42
to it is
26:43
one less than 10 billion cool i think
26:46
the last few things that we've just said
26:48
come from a book called alex's
26:49
adventures in number land it's by alex
26:51
bellos
26:52
and his book is extraordinary i haven't
26:54
read his new one but the first one
26:55
is amazing to drag it back to hundreds
26:57
for a minute 100 weight was 112
27:00
pounds still this still is yeah yeah but
27:02
only after the 15th century before that
27:04
it was 108 pounds
27:06
oh the whole thing is a nightmare yeah
27:08
it really is yeah
27:09
so when we get up to 10 when we're
27:10
counting up to 10 we think we use the
27:12
decimal system of counting
27:13
but if we properly did it 11 should be
27:16
19
27:16
and 12 should be 15. but we say 11 and
27:19
12 because we used to work on a semi
27:21
durodecimal system also the number 100
27:25
is the sum of the first
27:26
nine prime numbers yeah that's weird
27:28
between two and 23
27:30
and all the seven in between add them up
27:32
you get 100. cool the other thing is
27:33
that if you had to pull the numbers on a
27:35
roulette wheel they add to 666. which is
27:37
a personal fact as well
27:38
so you were saying that the word hundred
27:40
came from old norse and that's it meant
27:42
120.
27:43
we still spoke norse in the uk until the
27:46
18th century parts of the uk
27:48
speaking north that's amazing in the
27:51
1701 i think it was a census or there
27:53
was certainly um a report in 1701
27:56
and they said there were still a few
27:57
monoglos speakers who couldn't speak any
28:00
other language apart from norse that is
28:01
so cool
28:02
well the thing is like shetland was
28:04
belonging to the norse people for a long
28:06
time and they
28:07
honed it to scotland in the 15th century
28:10
or something like that so theoretically
28:12
they could buy it back if they wanted to
28:13
wow in the roman army you know being
28:15
decimated oh yeah
28:16
is where one in ten men is killed um
28:18
what i didn't know before is that it was
28:20
a punishment
28:21
for what you thought it was a treat
28:23
reward good news boys
28:25
i thought it happened in war that you
28:26
know you lose one man intent you say oh
28:28
god the legion was decimated yesterday
28:30
terrible result
28:30
but no it's a it's a punishment but
28:32
there was a minor punishment which is
28:34
called being sentimated
28:36
which is where one person in a hundred
28:38
is put to death
28:39
and they choose it by lot and the reason
28:41
it's a punishment for everyone
28:43
isn't it because one in ten if you're
28:44
decimating as a general
28:46
is killed by the other nine in ten so
28:48
it's a punishment for everyone i think
28:49
so nine people had to stone one of their
28:52
people to death oh dear
28:53
you know a word that doesn't exist but
28:56
does exist
28:57
zillion it exists but there's no
28:59
numerical
29:01
no it's just a random like when you want
29:02
to come up with something unfeasibly big
29:04
yeah there used to be a children's
29:05
magazine called zillions
29:07
and the wikipedia entry for it just says
29:09
it existed for several years until 2000
29:11
when it was folded
29:12
into its parent magazine consumer
29:14
reports
29:17
happy 18th birthday here's consumer
29:19

00:44
it's in

00:49
no such thing as a fish
00:52
[Music]
00:56
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:58
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
01:00
coming to you from the qi offices in
01:02
covent garden my name is dan schreiber
01:04
i'm sitting here with three of the
01:05
regular elves it is james harkin
01:07
anna chazinski and andy murray and once
01:10
again we've got our four favorite facts
01:12
from the last seven days and here they
01:13
are
01:13
in no particular order james
01:17
starting with you what's your fact okay
01:18
my fact this week is
01:20
that the head of the international chess
01:22
federation believes that chess was
01:24
brought to earth by aliens
01:26
[Laughter]
01:27
and he should know yeah what kind of
01:30
evidence does he have for that
01:31
uh he has first-hand evidence because he
01:34
was abducted by aliens in 1997
01:37
and shown around the galaxy uh and they
01:40
told him
01:40
the earth is set to collide with the
01:42
planet nibiru
01:44
killing us all if mankind does not
01:46
cleanse its aura by playing more chess
01:48
[Music]
01:50
in an interview in time magazine that
01:51
was what's his name again
01:55
he's a politician as well he's um the
01:58
head of the kalminkia
02:00
province of russia and he has friends
02:03
such as chuck norris
02:04
uh and he was friends with salam hussein
02:06
is he friends with david ike
02:08
he should be why do these political guys
02:10
all these sort of like eccentric
02:12
characters always have an american
02:14
action hero as a good mate they all have
02:17
you know chuck norris being his mate or
02:19
like kim jong-un having dennis rodman
02:21
i guess it's like a trophy friend trophy
02:24
american mate for
02:25
some kind of buddy movie that may erupt
02:28
one day any biography
02:30
movie done of a big political leader of
02:32
our time is effectively going to come
02:33
out like rush hour
02:36
chuck norris just quickly on him uh i
02:38
read this thing whereby
02:39
he despite being in violent movies hates
02:42
that his kids
02:43
would have to watch violent movies but
02:44
they all want to watch his movies so he
02:46
does this thing where he edits out
02:48
all the fight scenes from his movies and
02:51
lets his kids watch that
02:52
and i cannot think of anything more
02:54
painful than watching a chuck norris
02:55
movie
02:56
without the fighting scenes yeah do they
02:59
think that he's in a load of 26 minute
03:00
long feature films
03:03
um just back to the sky mr ilium genov
03:06
uh
03:06
he said that uh aliens gave us chess
03:09
that's one thing but he also said they
03:10
gave us something else
03:12
anyone know what it is no is it a
03:14
technology or an illness or a body part
03:16
no sweet corn he says they gave a sweet
03:20
corn but he says it was a different
03:21
civilization
03:22
uh they gave us sweet corn maybe the
03:24
aztecs are the incans or something
03:26
and are they are they threatening the
03:28
world with destruction unless we eat as
03:29
much sweet corn as humanly possible
03:31
do you know what he's been more um he's
03:33
been more asked about the chess
03:34
donation from space than he has the
03:36
sweet corn i can't find anything else
03:38
you know what guys i was really hoping
03:39
this was going to be about chess
03:42
let's go into the channel can i tell you
03:44
a fact about chess yes please okay um
03:46
in 1999 gary kasparov obviously great
03:48
chess champion played
03:50
the world at chess oh yeah he played 50
03:52
000 different people from more than 75
03:54
countries in one game
03:56
so they all submitted votes on what
03:58
moves they should take as a team
04:01
and whichever move received most votes
04:02
was the move that the world made against
04:04
kerry kasparov
04:05
um after four months the game ended at
04:06
move 62 when 51
04:08
of the world's team voted to resign
04:13
wow 49 must have been livid yeah yeah
04:16
but they weren't even acting on so 50
04:18
000 people but they weren't even
04:19
on their own even as 50 000 they had um
04:22
four chess experts guiding them acting
04:24
as world team coaches
04:25
and suggesting moves and strategies so
04:27
even with
04:28
expert help 50 000 people cannot beat
04:31
gary kasparov
04:32
um gary kasparov when he so famously he
04:35
obviously had the two matches against
04:36
deep blue the super computer
04:38
uh the latter of which was in ninth so
04:40
he won the first one which was a set of
04:41
six games
04:42
and then in 1997 he played another set
04:44
of six games and
04:46
in the first game of the six he won but
04:49
he basically had a mental breakdown
04:51
after it had finished because
04:53
the computer had done what he thought
04:54
was a completely ingenious move that
04:56
even he couldn't understand
04:58
um so gary caswell was winning but the
05:01
computer moved
05:02
a rook in a really random position and
05:03
gary kasperov couldn't work out why that
05:05
possibly would make any computing sense
05:07
so suddenly he went oh my god i can't
05:09
work out the logic of what this computer
05:10
is doing
05:11
it must be better than me and that was
05:13
the last game that he ever
05:15
won against the computer because he
05:16
became so frightened that oh that this
05:18
has super
05:19
human intelligence and actually uh one
05:22
of the computer engineers admitted to
05:23
nate silva
05:25
15 years later that there was a bug in
05:27
the computer
05:28
and it just resorted to randomly moving
05:30
a piece totally at random
05:32
it would be better if someone had just
05:33
moved the horse in the wrong way or
05:35
something
05:36
yes just knock the table over
05:39
oh my god you can move the whole three
05:41
up and five across
05:43
no one tell me this yeah he thought that
05:44
he thought it was a sign that the there
05:46
were humans intervening yeah with the
05:48
computer he
05:49
oh yeah and he's also cheating just um
05:51
about your thing about caspara versus
05:53
the world
05:54
andy um there's i had can go one better
05:57
on that
05:57
which is the he the first ever world
06:00
chess champion
06:01
was called wilhelm steinitz and um he
06:04
was a great player and
06:06
he was he beat everyone and then he
06:08
started to slightly lose his marbles a
06:09
little bit
06:10
and he um challenged god to a match
06:13
and he would play god quite often and he
06:16
quite often beat god and he got so much
06:18
better than god that he would
06:20
start giving god like a pawn extra to
06:22
try and make it a bit more even wait
06:24
when you say he
06:25
beat god yeah it was god playing well i
06:27
think he was like maybe slightly
06:29
schizophrenic so he was getting the
06:31
getting the moves himself and go oh god
06:32
did that oh god you idiot
06:36
and so he would he would be good and
06:37
very sadly he ended up in a mental
06:39
asylum and
06:40
died penniless but he was the first ever
06:42
chess champion called
06:43
wilhelm steinitz there is a debate about
06:46
whether chess makes you mad or not
06:47
there's a really good navigator
06:48
quote about the fact that um everyone
06:51
who plays chess must eventually go
06:52
insane
06:53
but my favorite chess player is this guy
06:55
called nathan sharansky
06:57
who is now an israeli politician i think
06:58
but he was a human rights campaigner in
07:00
soviet russia and
07:02
he was a childhood chess prodigy and he
07:04
was put in a siberian prison in 1977 for
07:07
nine years
07:08
and he said chess kept him sane so he
07:10
was in this tiny freezing cold cell
07:12
was hardly given any food it was
07:13
completely dark um he there was
07:16
absolutely nothing in the cell just
07:17
stone and he just played chess
07:18
in his head against himself for nine
07:20
years and said that that was the only
07:22
way that he survived it
07:23
and that kept him sane yeah i think it's
07:25
in iran they
07:26
banned the you know when you get the
07:28
pawn to the end and you can turn it into
07:30
a queen
07:30
i think they banned that move because it
07:32
promoted bigamy
07:34
because then the king had two wives
07:35
surely it would be promoting
07:36
transvestism
07:38
you're assuming that pawns are men yes i
07:41
am are they
07:42
i don't know i'm comfortable with that
07:44
queens used to only be able to move
07:46
less like they could only move one space
07:48
in any direction
07:49
yeah they were rubbish they were the
07:51
worst and then they could move like
07:52
knights for a while for some reason
07:53
which is kind of bizarre because you
07:54
would have thought knights could move
07:55
like that because they're horses
07:56
queen could do it too sorry just your
07:58
logic is like well they're on horses so
08:00
that makes sense
08:01
actually it's never struck me that
08:02
doesn't make sense doesn't it the
08:03
knights can move too
08:05
horses can jump over i think yeah they
08:07
can jump but there's no particular
08:08
reason why a horse
08:10
would move two forward and one to the
08:11
side at the same time the evil knievels
08:14
of the chess what
08:14
do you guys when you play monopoly are
08:16
you going okay i'm going to get the car
08:17
because that moves faster than a hat
08:20
this is a bit too much logic oh yeah the
08:22
battleship blow up the iron
08:24
yeah have you seen they brought out new
08:26
pieces
08:27
for the monopoly board yeah they brought
08:29
in a cat last year didn't they yeah
08:30
they've got rid of the iron
08:31
or the old boot possibly and replaced it
08:33
with a cat
08:35
but is it sorry go on andy sorry just on
08:37
the monopoly thing the cat
08:38
won a vote a popular online vote uh and
08:41
it beat a robot helicopter diamond ring
08:43
and a guitar
08:45
and one of the guys from hasbro said i
08:47
think there were a lot of cat lovers in
08:48
the world that reached out
08:49
yeah they're always bloody reaching out
08:52
robot
08:55
we all know um turn back the waves um he
08:58
once had a chess game with
09:00
an earl of his called earl ulf and he
09:03
did a move i think it was a night's move
09:05
but he realized it was a bad one tried
09:07
to take it back oh
09:08
olf said no you can't do that it turned
09:11
into a massive argument commit commute
09:13
tipped up the table went off in a huff
09:15
and then had earl ulf
09:16
killed wow napoleon got really angry
09:20
playing chess well according to one
09:21
account napoleon got really angry
09:23
playing chess against
09:24
the mechanical turk didn't he yeah we
09:26
should explain who the mechanical term
09:28
yeah so the
09:28
mechanical turk was a fake chess machine
09:31
that existed between 1770 and 1854
09:34
and it was theoretically it was this
09:37
robot that was dressed up like a
09:39
turk and it managed to beat napoleon
09:42
franklin babbage other famous people at
09:44
chess and it sort of toured the globe
09:46
and it was this turkish man with a huge
09:49
box on which he had a chessboard
09:50
that he apparently played by some
09:52
robotic power so i don't know why no one
09:54
ever said hey can this turk play without
09:56
the huge box
09:57
because inside the huge box under the
09:59
chessboard was obviously a guy who was
10:00
controlling the chess pieces
10:02
why does that box keep sneezing yeah i
10:04
think
10:05
what um maybe this is why the robot's
10:08
not allowed on the monopoly board
10:10
all the games it's been banned from in
10:13
case napoleon
10:14
puts him to death but yeah at one point
10:17
napoleon i think wrapped a shawl around
10:19
the mechanical turk's head so that he
10:21
wouldn't be able to see the board
10:24
which obviously didn't make a blind bit
10:25
of difference there was another famous
10:26
um
10:27
chess player who um always had excuses
10:31
and he'd lost five games in a row he was
10:33
five nil down
10:34
and he said oh the first one i lost
10:36
because i had toothache and the second
10:37
one i lost because i had a headache
10:39
and the third one i lost because i had
10:40
rheumatism in my legs and
10:42
that fourth one i lost because i just
10:44
wasn't feeling very well
10:46
and then they said well why did you lose
10:48
the fifth one and he said what am i
10:49
expecting to win
10:50
every game
10:50
[Laughter]
10:53
that was like when uh david haye after
10:55
his match where he lost
10:57
he's like you know it's i twisted my
11:00
ankle this morning and
11:02
and that was his excuse no he broke a
11:04
toe he broke a toe oh i broke my toe and
11:07
it really affected how i punch with my
11:09
arms i just wish i'd learned
11:11
i was here yeah oh come on that's all
11:13
right yeah well your toe
11:15
yeah yeah you can't move you can be
11:16
really painful no he was
11:18
he was fine can i just say it can i just
11:20
say if david haye's listening i believe
11:22
you oh me too actually yeah
11:24
sorry david i don't but i don't know who
11:26
you are i thought you were a chess
11:28
player
11:30
come on let's bring weedy chess player
11:31
hey over here
11:35
this is rash guys i'll break his other
11:38
toe
11:38
[Laughter]
11:41
okay time for fact number two and that
11:43
is my fact my fact this week concerns
11:45
the greenland shark which is a shark i
11:48
didn't know existed until a few days ago
11:49
and what i love about it is the
11:51
greenland shark is so slow
11:53
that it basically needs all of his food
11:56
to be asleep
11:57
in order to eat it because otherwise if
11:59
it can move anything can outswim it
12:01
because its fastest speed
12:02
is one mile per hour why is it so slow
12:05
because it's in cold water and so it
12:07
needs to preserve all of its energy and
12:09
so on
12:10
they can do little bursts of speed can
12:11
they the sharks they can but when they
12:13
say when they
12:14
in everything i've read i could be if if
12:16
someone out there knows any different
12:17
because i'd love to know
12:18
uh apparently with the bursts of speed
12:20
yeah they can only get up to about 1.6
12:23
miles an hour so that's their burst of
12:24
speed that's amazing yeah yeah it's not
12:26
so much a burst
12:27
is it they're amazing looking they're 20
12:29
feet long as well they're huge yeah
12:31
they're ginormous yeah
12:32
so it seals the greenland shark and the
12:35
problem with eating seals
12:36
is that it it's fine if they can manage
12:38
to get the seal but the seal can swim at
12:40
two miles per hour
12:41
so it's always just in front of this
12:43
shark who's giving it it's all gone
12:46
it's not always just in front it's
12:47
always increasing its distance
12:49
that's true that's right a mile every
12:51
hour so basically they have to wait to
12:52
find
12:53
a sleeping seal and here's the thing the
12:55
seals
12:56
uh their main predator or the polar
12:58
bears up on the ice
12:59
and they would rather be in the ocean
13:01
and risk being asleep
13:03
because they can probably have a good
13:04
sleep notice a shark on its way and by
13:06
the time it wakes up it can still get
13:08
away yeah you could
13:09
press snooze quite a few times before it
13:11
gets you yeah
13:13
but they're extraordinary creatures just
13:14
generally their their skin is poisonous
13:16
i don't know if i've read about that
13:17
within any other sharks not the rest of
13:19
them too they're flash as well that's
13:20
sorry that's
13:21
yeah yeah yeah though so they're
13:22
completely poisonous we couldn't eat
13:23
them um
13:24
and do you know what it does to you if
13:25
you eat it do you know the effects it
13:27
has what's the poison
13:28
the poison so the poison is
13:30
trimethylamine oxide
13:32
and so if you eat the flesh of the shark
13:33
that has the effect of extreme
13:35
drunkenness
13:36
does it so if you manage to not eat too
13:37
much then you can just get really pissed
13:39
so it's like licking a toad except if
13:41
you don't like drugs and you like
13:42
alcohol yeah
13:43
exactly wow like a hallucinogenic toad
13:45
you can lick this shark uh
13:47
looking i think you'd have a nibble you
13:50
can cook it though
13:51
there are ways of preparing it properly
13:53
so so
13:54
but it's a very disgusting way of
13:56
cooking it you have to bury the meat in
13:57
the ground
13:58
it's one of these is it yeah for six to
14:01
12 weeks and then you expose it every so
14:03
often
14:03
and you thaw it out and then you freeze
14:05
it again then you have to hang it up to
14:06
dry for several months and then you
14:07
finally cut it into bite-sized cubes
14:09
well i think in order to eat that you'd
14:11
have to be pretty drunk
14:12
yeah and it says the end product which
14:14
is called uh
14:15
hecaril or hakarel is a delicacy which
14:18
is
14:18
the universal way of describing foods
14:20
that are horrible
14:22
but rare um they they can live these
14:24
sharks can live up to 200 years
14:26
they think no that can't be right yeah
14:29
this is what they say they
14:30
they know this because scientists have
14:32
said that they can live up to
14:34
roughly 200 years of age they know this
14:36
because they measure how much they grow
14:37
per year and they only grow about one
14:39
between half and one centimeter per year
14:42
and so they found them the size of great
14:44
white sharks and they
14:45
they made an assumption that that's how
14:47
large they can get it's really weird how
14:48
little we know about this shark as well
14:50
they were only first photographed in
14:51
1995
14:52
and the first bit of actual footage of
14:54
them is from 2003.
14:56
so they're kind of this new species to
14:58
us really it was actually thought that
14:59
sharks in general died in their 20s but
15:01
then
15:02
they did radioactive um tests on them
15:05
because the radiation that went from the
15:07
nuclear tests into the environments
15:09
meant that you can test how old things
15:11
are
15:11
and they found that um sharks now
15:13
routinely live into the 70s
15:15
wow wow okay yeah that's such a strange
15:17
thought isn't it an elderly shark
15:19
uh they have found inside the greenland
15:21
shark haven't they um some pretty
15:22
impressive animals given that they move
15:23
so slowly
15:25
they've got they found reindeer and they
15:27
found really fast moving seals inside it
15:29
a lion a cheetah yeah a polar bear
15:33
found inside one of them yeah which is
15:36
weird
15:36
they basically eat everything because
15:39
they don't have many options
15:41
of living things to eat because
15:43
everything can swim away
15:44
they're genuinely they're scavengers
15:45
they just if they see something dead and
15:47
it looks edible they will eat it because
15:49
that's their three options are it's
15:51
either asleep it's dead or it's swam
15:53
into my face
15:54
those are the three eating options that
15:56
they have
15:58
i want to talk about some slow chases
16:00
okay yeah
16:01
um so in i don't know when this was a
16:04
few years ago there was a news report
16:06
of a guy um called mr smith who stole
16:09
a jcb and then he drove off
16:13
at 10 to 15 miles an hour the police
16:16
were called they started chasing him
16:18
but then realized that he was just going
16:20
and they couldn't stop him
16:22
and so the the policeman got out and
16:24
chased him on foot
16:27
and he said i was able to keep pace at a
16:29
fast jog
16:32
which is quite a good police chase and i
16:34
was also reading about this
16:36
really cool thing called the marathon de
16:38
madok which is a french marathon
16:40
and it's known as the world's longest
16:42
marathon uh
16:43
and it's a full 26 miles and there are
16:45
23 wine stops on the way
16:49
and a lot of these things you just
16:50
paused to complain
16:53
no sadly not no it's where you drink
16:55
wine and they stops also offer
16:57
specialties such as steak
16:59
and ice cream um when you get to stop
17:02
and at 23 miles there's an oyster stop
17:04
so you can have some oysters
17:06
and um according to the organizers this
17:09
marathon has the most medical support of
17:11
any marathon in the world wow
17:14
of course yeah and no one's ever
17:16
finished it come for the steak stay for
17:18
the heart attack
17:22
uh slow are the slowest animals um the
17:24
sloth is obviously
17:25
uh a good guy and can only move at three
17:29
meters per minute but i think that's
17:30
fine because it can do so much other
17:31
cool stuff so it can spin its head 270
17:33
degrees
17:34
which i didn't know exorcist style quite
17:36
impressive yeah james is trying it now
17:38
you've got about
17:38
40 i would say 40 degrees you've managed
17:43
no you've got about 90. certainly went
17:44
over 90.
17:46
um but i didn't know the sloths were so
17:48
sedentary that algae grows on their coat
17:50
and
17:51
they use it as camouflage well i think
17:54
they're justifying that after the fact
17:55
no this is camouflage meant to do it
17:57
guys
17:59
they eat it as well don't they the algae
18:01
there you go multi-purpose this leads to
18:03
a brilliant
18:03
interesting thing about the slows which
18:06
is the
18:07
two-toed variety i think they climb down
18:09
from the tree to defecate
18:11
and that uses up eight percent of all
18:13
their energy which is a lot of energy
18:15
just to go to the toilet yeah actually
18:16
terrifying though to be 12 shits away
18:18
from death
18:20
if one uses eight percent of your energy
18:22
oh yeah
18:23
you will be counting in your head that's
18:26
four
18:27
that's like you could see like the
18:28
energy bar at like the top of street
18:30
fighter
18:31
that's how you can break that down you'd
18:32
have to really conserve it wouldn't you
18:34
do they need it i can hold it for
18:36
another six hours but it's been 11.
18:38
[Laughter]
18:40
okay time for fact number three and that
18:43
is you chozinski
18:45
my fact is that in the 19th century you
18:47
could be committed to an asylum
18:49
for novel reading no it was if you're
18:52
caught reading a novel
18:54
banged up was it specific novels or i
18:56
didn't say actually it was just so this
18:58
is well i found
18:59
records from west virginia asylum from
19:01
between 1864 and 1889 and
19:04
pennsylvania state lunatic hospital are
19:05
just two sources that i found
19:07
which give lists of reasons for
19:08
admission and one of them is novel
19:11
reading
19:11
other reasons for admission into the
19:13
west virginia asylum in that time period
19:15
include
19:16
kicked in the head by a horse bad
19:18
whiskey
19:19
and imaginary female trouble don't know
19:22
what that is uh hysteria i guess
19:25
but imaginary no there's a separate one
19:27
hysteria is totally separate and
19:28
menstrual trouble is that could be an
19:29
imaginary female
19:31
trouble with the wife it was only men
19:32
you're not married
19:34
get to the asylum now um actually
19:36
speaking of that so in the
19:38
other asylum the pennsylvania asylum
19:40
novel reading was cited as a cause of
19:42
lunacy and two patients
19:43
one man was admitted for mortified pride
19:46
but the most common
19:48
cause of admission uh so the most common
19:50
illness or the most common reason for
19:52
going mad for which
19:53
226 patients were admitted in one year
19:56
in 1866
19:57
was just trouble yeah i got trouble
20:01
it's an incredible list it includes
20:03
things like the war
20:05
yeah that's another reason for admission
20:06
to an asylum yeah um
20:08
do you reckon that's ptsd that that
20:10
would be yeah
20:11
i said shell sharks yeah that would be
20:14
two more of my favorites from that list
20:16
um one of them is tobacco and
20:19
masturbation
20:21
are those paired together yes they are
20:24
yeah yeah there's a separate one for
20:25
masturbation
20:26
and then tobacco masturbation i believe
20:28
is a different question
20:29
there's masturbation and syphilis
20:30
suppressed masturbation masturbation for
20:32
30 years and
20:34
my favorite deranged masturbation
20:39
what's your favorite what hobby
20:44
yeah this is like a list of our our
20:46
weekend
20:48
it's my to-do list masturbation also
20:52
thought to be caused by novel reading
20:53
in the 19th century yep i was reading an
20:55
extract my book called disease insanity
20:57
and deformity written in 1860
20:59
and it said masturbation often caused by
21:01
novel reading and the way you can spot
21:03
masturbation in
21:04
uh somebody so obviously it's a terrible
21:05
sin i know how to spot it
21:09
i don't need a guide it's hard to
21:11
identify
21:12
give me a line up i'll spot the guy
21:18
it's number four you can tell because
21:21
he's got tobacco
21:24
um how do you really spot it oh you can
21:27
spot it by
21:27
sunken ghastly eyes and clammy greasy
21:30
skin irritability eyes averted when they
21:32
meet ours basically all the symptoms of
21:33
being a teenager
21:34
oh i had a good one sorry um i have a
21:37
good
21:37
thing in the um this was in 1869 and it
21:40
was an essay by the reverend j.t
21:42
crane about novel reading about why it's
21:44
so bad for you yeah
21:45
and there was loads of different reasons
21:47
uh mostly it's about
21:49
encouraging imagination and obviously
21:50
that's not to be encouraged
21:52
but one of the things that says that a
21:54
novel reader is merged in the hero of
21:56
the story
21:57
handsome in person brilliant in mind
21:59
endowed with every excellent and
22:01
excellence and bearing a name of at
22:03
least three syllables
22:05
so basically if you read novels it makes
22:07
you think you have a name of three
22:08
syllables
22:10
uh he soon imagines he is desperately in
22:12
love with some little damsel in the
22:14
neighborhood
22:15
he begins to canvas her she turns him
22:17
down and eventually he commits suicide
22:19
and that's apparently if you read novels
22:21
that's what will happen to you to every
22:22
person wrote a novel really
22:24
it is extraordinary but we don't realize
22:27
that the novel was a new form
22:29
um uh in the who doesn't in the 18th and
22:32
early 19th centuries but it's extremely
22:34
you don't why yeah
22:35
but it's extraordinary to think of a
22:37
world in which novels were unknown and
22:39
then
22:39
suddenly people were writing these
22:41
things yeah and it was a lot of
22:43
worried of course typical to the time
22:45
about the effect on young women
22:47
it was all about women how they would
22:48
imagine themselves to be as you say
22:50
james heroines and things like that
22:52
yeah that would lead them to abandon
22:54
their studies their wholesome pursuits
22:55
actually jane austen mounts a very
22:57
lively defensive novel reading
22:59
in northanger abbey she says they
23:00
contain everything that's excellent
23:02
in mankind yeah she didn't have a vested
23:04
interest though being a novel right
23:06
oh you've blown the lid right on this
23:08
one james get it in private eye now
23:11
uh not just women because what about
23:13
goethe's um sorrows of young
23:15
uh i i like that it's gerta's sorrows of
23:18
virta
23:19
yeah i do like that no but that yeah
23:21
that was the novel he wrote wasn't it
23:23
yeah the main character commits
23:26
one of the characters was very
23:28
distinctively dressed i can't really
23:29
remember it was like he had yellow
23:30
trousers or and a red jacket or
23:32
something i commit suicide and then
23:34
everyone supposedly copied him
23:35
and there was 2 000 suicides in europe
23:37
blamed on that novel
23:38
god wow so they are dangerous
23:41
stay away from the novels um okay we've
23:44
got to move on anyone got anything else
23:46
chuckin yeah just just some really good
23:48
stuff about uh how they dealt with
23:50
the mentally ill in the 19th century um
23:52
so when you were put into your asylum
23:53
for novel reading uh
23:54
some things that you could have done to
23:56
you were so freezing cold showers and
23:58
shaved heads were often ministered
23:59
because it was thought that you could
24:00
release the madness through your head
24:02
and you'd have an application of
24:03
blisters where your skin was burnt a lot
24:05
so you bliss it up so a blister would be
24:07
prescribed
24:08
um but the funnest i think are whirling
24:10
chairs
24:11
so these were what they sound like
24:13
really where you get sat in a chair tied
24:15
to it and it spins round and round and
24:17
round around
24:17
and it's supposed to send your madness
24:19
propelling from your body so there's a
24:20
great account for instance in 1822 work
24:24
uh yeah well like a charm but like a
24:26
dream in all the accounts i've read i've
24:27
read tons it's always no improvement no
24:29
improvement
24:30
they never caught on if there was a
24:31
transcript of just like the doctor's
24:34
kitchen where they all met during the
24:35
day
24:36
they would sound way more mad than
24:38
anyone who was in that assignment
24:40
how's your day been i put him on the
24:42
whirling chair to you know propel his
24:44
madness out of it
24:45
how'd it go it didn't work i don't know
24:47
if we've got a faulty chair i don't know
24:49
what's going on
24:50
because the conversations would have
24:51
been insane in there
24:53
you didn't whirl him fast enough
24:57
okay time for our final fact and that is
25:00
andy
25:01
hello my fact is that the japanese
25:04
yakuza crime syndicate has its own
25:05
website which has a theme tune
25:08
designed to attract new members wait so
25:10
just very quickly because i don't know
25:11
much about them
25:12
this is like a real kind of like
25:14
menacing
25:15
mafia like yeah except that there's a
25:18
lot of acceptance of them in
25:20
japanese society and um it's not illegal
25:23
to be a member but it is illegal to do
25:25
obviously a lot of the activities which
25:27
is which is extortion
25:28
or rackets of one kind or another so
25:31
they have a very interesting racket
25:32
which is basically large-scale
25:33
bribery where they buy shares in a
25:35
company enough to get them to a
25:36
shareholders meeting where they can
25:38
speak in public
25:39
and then they just find dirt on the
25:40
company's executives get in touch with
25:42
them and say
25:43
if you don't pay us a significant whack
25:45
of money we will come to the
25:47
shareholders meeting and read out all
25:48
this terrible stuff about you
25:50
and so they do it right and the only
25:52
effective method against them apparently
25:54
is to
25:54
have everyone's shareholder meetings on
25:56
the same day so that
25:59
they can't be everywhere at once so now
26:01
ninety percent of
26:02
companies on the tokyo stock exchange
26:04
have their annual shareholder meetings
26:05
on the same day now
26:06
yeah yeah but it's very weirdly sort of
26:09
half accepted and then they they
26:11
they see themselves as not being
26:13
criminals they see themselves as having
26:14
a proper code of honor and having you
26:16
know their life
26:17
and they sometimes do i mean whether
26:20
it's a cynical act or not they for
26:22
instance in 2011 were some of the first
26:24
people to get to the tsunami
26:26
uh uh the tsunami affected areas with
26:29
aid weren't they and in 1995 the same
26:31
thing
26:31
in kobe in when the earthquake hit uh
26:34
they think that if the yakuza hadn't
26:35
arrived in time with their aid then
26:37
there would have been much much more
26:38
damage done because other
26:40
agencies couldn't get in fast enough
26:42
yeah so they they're controversial
26:44
because they don't they're not totally
26:45
unpopular
26:47
they've got this thing i read that they
26:49
have a um
26:50
a 12-page exam now for all of your
26:52
members
26:53
just to make sure because they keep
26:54
getting in trouble for kind of rookie
26:56
errors in the way that laws are changing
26:57
and so on i think it's because they
26:59
they don't mind doing their big
27:01
racketeering and stuff but they don't
27:02
want to get in
27:03
with a brawl or just like a yeah yeah
27:05
lame like a parking fine or something
27:07
like that they're trying to stop them
27:08
doing the small things but that's what's
27:10
really funny because um
27:11
in a normal exam if you were doing that
27:13
for normal people who just live
27:15
quite a sort of legal life it would be
27:16
stuff like not parking your car in a
27:18
certain spot the stuff that they have
27:19
the topics that they cover are
27:21
dumping industrial waste
27:25
and vehicle theft which is normal i love
27:27
that dumping industrial waste
27:29
yeah they also have a newsletter that
27:31
they do yeah as well
27:32
yeah and it's it's what you wanna no no
27:35
you go for it
27:36
um so it goes only to the regular
27:38
members you have to be a proper
27:40
full-time member to get one of the
27:41
newsletters but that's
27:42
28 000 people and it's um articles
27:46
motivational articles from the
27:47
management about the difficult times
27:49
we're going through it now it's going to
27:50
pick up soon uh haikus articles on
27:53
fishing
27:54
um entreaties to perform good works so i
27:57
think it's designed partly as a little
27:59
propaganda thing because they know that
28:00
people outside the
28:01
acoustic are also going to read it and
28:03
yeah hey these guys
28:04
they sound like pretty fun we should go
28:05
angling some time with them you know
28:07
whatever did you go onto their website
28:09
that you were talking about yeah i did
28:10
and it's very old school
28:12
you can translate it into english can't
28:14
you and a lot of it is about
28:15
anti-marijuana saying that marijuana
28:17
shouldn't be allowed in the country and
28:19
all that kind of stuff yeah exactly it's
28:21
the banished drugs and purified the
28:23
nation league yeah is they
28:25
is the front for it yeah um
28:28
isn't there a branch of it that is quite
28:29
anti-drug zone it's called the yamu
28:31
chai something yeah there is a problem
28:34
yeah the yamaguchi gumi is is genuinely
28:36
quite anti-drugs or
28:37
parts of it are very anti-drugs yes yes
28:40
they are yeah
28:41
um so they're selective about the crimes
28:42
they commit they are exactly
28:44
it's it's more a kind of power extortion
28:47
racketeering thing
28:48
um and i should say where i got this
28:50
fact from it's from this magazine called
28:51
delayed gratification quarterly which is
28:53
a very cool magazine because it's all
28:55
news from three months ago which has
28:57
been filtered and written about really
28:58
carefully and
28:58
there's this incredible photo feature
29:00
which you should check out by a guy
29:01
called anton kusters
29:03
who was allowed into the syndicate for
29:05
two years to photograph them and their
29:06
tattoos are
29:08
extraordinary they often don't get a say
29:10
oh we'll put these up on the side
29:12
yeah and if you google anton kuster's
29:15
k-u-s-t-e-r-s
29:16
then uh you'll find his photos of them
29:18
right this magazine just sounds like an
29:19
excuse for a newspaper that was very
29:22
slow getting to the press i know it
29:23
sounds like
29:24
it sounds like if greenland sharks made
29:25
a newspaper yeah
29:27
um i did genuinely try and get hold of
29:29
delayed gratification quarterly
29:31
um on monday last week and they said
29:33
come back on wednesday
29:36
excellent yeah um hell's angels
29:39
another well the us department of
29:41
justice considers them a crime
29:42
syndicate and anyway i was reading a
29:45
news story on them the other day where a
29:47
german student
29:48
mooned a group of hell's angels and
29:49
hurled a puppy at them before escaping
29:51
on a stolen bulldozer
29:52
so he he ran outside presumably where
29:54
every single one of their harley
29:56
davidsons was sitting
29:57
thought i need an escape vehicle i need
30:00
to get away from these guys real quick
30:02
bulldozer he must have thought that the
30:04
dog would distract them somehow
30:06
well it must have because he was stopped
30:07
by the police not the hills angels
30:09
perhaps they thought they didn't really
30:10
care that much and they'd rather go on
30:12
drinking
30:12
do they have a theme tune as well oh
30:14
speaking of theme tunes have we got did
30:15
you manage to find the uh yakuza uh yeah
30:18
so here it is
30:35
so the lyrics are with nothing but my
30:36
courage and this body i'll trust myself
30:38
to the life of a yakuza and follow this
30:40
path i've decided on
30:41
wow it's not as jingly as i was hoping
30:44
it would be no no
30:44
it's not really i was hoping it was more
30:46
like a an advert trying to get you to a
30:48
kfc or a mcdonald's or something like
30:49
that
30:50
yeah i'm not signing up after hearing
30:51
that you should be like don't be a loser
30:53
join the yakuza james spent the whole
30:57
podcast
30:59
so speaking of theme tunes did you guys
31:01
know that salman rushdie wrote a theme
31:03
tune once
31:04
for a tv show we all know and love nope
31:06
he wrote a theme tune it was titled
31:08
the best things begin with b and it was
31:12
for the burnley building society
31:14
he wrote the lyrics to it you can dream
31:16
a little you can dream a lot but the
31:17
best dreams of all
31:18
are the ones you've got building in the
31:20
burnley
31:21
that is fantastic and i can't find any
31:23
evidence of it online i reckon he goes
31:24
through the internet every day and make
31:26
sure he deletes every reference too
31:27
that's
31:28
great though i didn't even know burnley
31:29
had a building
31:31
didn't do its job apparently he was very
31:33
bad in advertising so
31:34
the one thing i know about burnley is
31:36
they drink more benedictine than
31:37
anywhere else in the world
31:39
do they well the best things in life do
31:41
begin with b yes
31:44
then it's they drink it in benion hot
31:47
which is benedictine in hot water and
31:48
it's a specific club especially
31:50
in a certain area of burnley and they
31:52
all drink benedictine oh really and then
31:54
invest their money very sensibly
31:55
yes that's what they're into
31:59
there was something else oh yeah he
32:01
worked um he came up with the slogan for
32:03
fresh cream cakes
32:04
naughty but nice yes he did um and he
32:06
also
32:07
invented the word irresistible yep for
32:10
aero chocolate bars
32:12
pretty cool so that obviously
32:14
pre-figured a lot of his magical realism
32:16
later on
32:16
yeah yeah can i tell you something about
32:19
theme tunes yes please
32:20
okay i have a couple of things about
32:22
theme teams which i really like so you
32:23
know the theme tune to desert island
32:25
discs yes
32:28
it was inspired by the view uh over
32:31
bogner regis
32:32
was it yeah the composer wrote it
32:35
looking across the lagoon
32:36
towards bogner it's called the blue
32:38
lagoon or something isn't it
32:40
yeah it is sleepy lagoon sleeping yeah
32:42
it kind of makes you want to go there
32:43
good old bog nori does it gets really
32:45
bad rap doesn't it it does yeah
32:47
it shouldn't as you say it's like just a
32:49
quick um
32:50
uh interjection waterloo sunset was
32:51
originally called liverpool sunset
32:53
wasn't it because it was
32:54
about uh the beauty of the sunset over
32:56
liverpool and then it was changed
32:57
because i think the kings felt that
32:59
waterloo
32:59
might resonate with more people burnley
33:02
sunset would have been better wouldn't
33:03
it but
33:04
yeah best things in life begin with b
33:06
yeah
33:08
someone rushed he's working on his
33:09
sequel now i'm the only building society
33:11
sunset
33:13
did you know that the star wars theme
33:15
tune has lyrics
33:18
no yeah what are the lyrics so okay
33:20
basically there was a holiday special
33:22
that was made
33:22
that george lucas has since said if he
33:24
had enough time and a hammer he would go
33:26
around smashing every pirated copy out
33:28
there that still exists
33:29
and it was uh basically the story of
33:31
chewbacca going home
33:33
for chewbacca wookie day with his family
33:35
during it had all these very surreal
33:37
moments and all the chara all the actors
33:39
from star wars were in it including
33:40
princess leia
33:41
who then sings the star wars theme tune
33:44
with lyrics yeah and uh the lyrics are
33:47
roughly
33:48
we celebrate a day of peace a day of
33:49
harmony a day of joy we can all share
33:51
together joyce it's really boring lyrics
33:52
but it's a really nice
33:54
it's a really nice thing lyrics are out
33:57
there for that song
33:58
um there was an i don't know if it's
34:01
right to call this a theme tune but
34:03
early american presidential candidates
34:06
they would have songs
34:07
associated with them oh yeah they kind
34:08
of are like theme tunes so
34:10
um john quincy adams was the president
34:12
in 1828 and he was the incumbent and he
34:15
was facing andrew jackson
34:17
so um john quincy adams um
34:21
he didn't write it but a song penned on
34:23
his behalf
34:24
was called little little know ye who's
34:27
coming
34:28
and it warns of fire and slavery and
34:30
pestilence if john quincy adams loses
34:32
the election huh the lyrics are
34:34
fires are coming swords are coming
34:36
pistols guns and knives are coming
34:38
if john quincy not be coming oh that's
34:42
quite good
34:43
and then he lost the election by a
34:44
landslide so and did
34:46
was america overtaken for the next
34:48
hundred years by fire and brimstone it
34:50
was not
34:51
uh you were just you were talking about
34:52
presidential theme tunes i really like
34:54
the fact that was it bill clinton's one
34:55
one of the democratic conventions when
34:57
bill clinton was incumbent uh
34:59
he it was originally going to be the
35:01
theme tune for the convention was going
35:02
to be mambo number five
35:03
until some smart person pointed out that
35:06
it contains the lyric a little bit of
35:07
moniker in my life
35:11
so they changed that i think bill
35:12
clinton used to go up to ladies and go
35:14
the best things in life begin with a b
35:18
that's very funny uh have we got any
35:20
more on this um so there was a gang of
35:22
counterfeiters
35:23
that tried to con the bank of england a
35:24
few years ago out of 28 billion
35:26
pounds and they did that by claiming to
35:29
have a collection of one thousand
35:30
pound and five thousand pound banknotes
35:33
according to the news article the
35:34
audacious plot was foiled
35:36
by the fact that the one thousand pound
35:38
banknotes had not been
35:39
legal tender for more than sixty years
35:42
and the five hundred thousand 000
35:43
version never existed ah
35:46

35:49
bad

to you this week from the aces and
01:04

01:06

01:08
schreiber please welcome to the stage

the three regular elves andy murray anna
01:13
chazinski and james horrican
01:15
[Applause]
01:20
and once again we have gathered round
01:22
with our four favorite facts from the
01:23
last seven days and in no particular
01:25
order here we go fact number one and
01:28
beginning with you james okay my fact
01:30
this week is that the first bbc radio
01:33
presenter with a northern accent was
01:35
given the job to make it more difficult
01:37
for the nazis to impersonate news
01:39
readers
01:42
so why were the nazis impersonating news
01:44
readers uh it was they thought that if
01:46
they could pretend to be news readers
01:47
over the radio then people would believe
01:49
anything they said and they'd be able to
01:50
say oh we've got such a strong army and
01:52
people would just believe it so they
01:53
like raid the bbc it was just propaganda
01:56
really they would pretend to be bbc news
01:58
readers okay yeah and so there's
02:00
people like that but yeah yeah it's also
02:02
why we've got james on the podcast
02:06
it's james the nazi
02:11
no this was a guy called wilfred pickles
02:13
he was the first northern news reader
02:15
from
02:16
1941 he was from yorkshire
02:20
and a lot of people didn't believe the
02:22
news when he read it out because he had
02:24
another accent
02:26
apparently what did they think they
02:27
thought that's a nazi trying to do a
02:28
british accent
02:32
no i don't know what they thought really
02:33
they just they just thought this guy is
02:36
you know uneducated he can't possibly
02:37
know what the news is that's what they i
02:39
read this thing about in the early days
02:40
of news reporting particularly on radio
02:43
that they never uh it was all male
02:44
presenters and they said that they
02:46
wouldn't allow female presenters on
02:48
because they didn't want them to have to
02:50
go through reading bad news like
02:52
upsetting news stories yeah they just
02:54
thought oh they're not going to like
02:55
that that would be
02:56
it's too emotional and it's true it's a
02:59
bbc thing where they announced that they
03:00
said we're not going to allow women to
03:01
do that they'll be too upset when they
03:03
hear this bad news no it's wow it's
03:05
terrible right they did have one in 1933
03:07
the first female uh news reader she was
03:09
called mrs giles barrett
03:12
i don't know what her real first name
03:14
was it doesn't seem to come up you've
03:15
seen a picture mrs charles yeah as he
03:17
named after her husband we were [ __ ]
03:19
to women back in the day
03:21
we still are but like i mean doubly so
03:23
that's terrible there were complaints
03:25
she was there for two months and the bbc
03:27
took her off the air for technical
03:29
reasons oh she's
03:31
technically her gender is wrong
03:35
did you know that all news readers were
03:37
originally uh anonymous
03:39
no so they didn't give their names or no
03:41
it was just the voice of the bbc news
03:43
and so we have the nazis to thank the
03:45
named news readers because during the
03:46
war people said that they should be able
03:47
to listen and kind of authenticate who
03:50
they were listening to so the first one
03:52
was frank phillips and he said in july
03:53
1940 battle of britain time this is
03:56
frank phillips from the bbc so that
03:58
again you couldn't be impersonated but
04:00
what so today we might have hugh edwards
04:02
just being a man on a screen wow we're
04:04
so identified
04:06
yeah yeah
04:07
isn't that weird though that none of
04:09
them identified themselves um do you
04:10
guys know about the very first ever uh
04:12
bbc news report on the radio no no okay
04:15
it's great uh it basically was on the
04:17
14th of november and i forgot to look up
04:18
the date
04:20
but it's on the 14th of november so
04:21
we're coming up to the anniversary very
04:23
exciting
04:25
uh and um basically he uh he read out
04:28
the news uh it was a guy called arthur
04:31
burroughs and he read it out um but he
04:32
read it twice once quickly and then once
04:35
slowly and then asked the listeners
04:37
which did you prefer
04:40
just for future recordings to know which
04:42
ones did they go with
04:44
it's not been recorded uh i i don't know
04:46
the answer so we don't know if now we
04:48
have quick news or slow news uh yeah i
04:51
have no idea i have no idea also it was
04:53
really weird because when they started
04:54
doing the news they did it post 7 pm and
04:56
lord wreath joined look so lord wreath
04:58
if you if you don't know his name he's
05:00
the guy who in the bbc they have a big
05:02
kind of saying which is uh to entertain
05:04
inform and educate that's the lord
05:06
wreath philosophy for bbc that
05:07
everyone's tried to stick to he joined a
05:09
week after the very first uh broadcast
05:12
of a radio um announcement telling the
05:14
news on the bbc and he had this thing
05:16
where he said we don't want anyone to be
05:18
doing news bulletins before 6 p.m
05:20
because the newspapers will be hurt as a
05:22
result of it and so no one was allowed
05:24
to do anything uh in terms of announcing
05:27
any news to the point that when they
05:29
showed uh horse racing on the sorry when
05:31
they played horse rating on the on the
05:33
news they couldn't have commentators
05:35
commentating on the horse race so you
05:37
listen to hooves and people cheering at
05:39
like 4 p.m and then at 7 p.m they go and
05:42
blitzer won
05:44
they would wait till the 7 o'clock news
05:46
was there a pause in between the year i
05:48
think so and
05:50
yeah so you were speaking of radio
05:52
though do you know what they did in 1955
05:54
when uh itv started i think it was 1955
05:56
wasn't it um and what the bbc did to try
06:00
and jeopardize itv's chances
06:02
no they didn't it wasn't actually on tv
06:04
because radio was a more popular medium
06:06
at that time they killed off grace
06:08
archer
06:09
in the archers gasp 20 million people
06:13
tuned in the population of britain was
06:15
40 million at the time half the country
06:18
tuned in to listen to grace get killed
06:19
off from the archer the um the archers
06:21
fans really hate you don't they dan
06:23
no well yeah
06:26
we make i so outside anyone who listens
06:28
to this podcast uh might know that um we
06:30
also the four of us work for qi and one
06:33
of the qi things is a radio show called
06:34
museum of curiosity and museum of
06:37
curiosity is played at 6 30 every
06:38
evening on a monday and arches follows
06:40
immediately and we get the [ __ ] ripped
06:42
out of us by the archers fans they hate
06:44
us and they just they don't even they
06:46
just they say how much they hate us and
06:48
then they do hashtag the archers and so
06:51
everyone why do they hit you they just
06:52
pass they catch the last five minutes of
06:54
museum of curiosity right and we're
06:56
usually talking about pubic lice or
06:58
something like that
06:59
and this doesn't come up on the arches
07:01
apparently no it doesn't there was a
07:02
great there was a fantastic one this
07:03
week though there was someone who
07:04
actually tweeted what is this garbage i
07:06
absolutely hate it hashtag the archers
07:08
someone wrote back going i know this
07:09
program sucks they should cancel it the
07:10
archers is terrible
07:13
oh
07:15
lovely confusion i have a fact about
07:16
lord wreath
07:18
john wreath as he was then um when he
07:19
applied for the post of general manager
07:21
of the british broadcasting company he
07:23
did not know what broadcasting was
07:25
and he wrote in his diary
07:27
that when he was called to an interview
07:29
he quotes still hadn't the remotest idea
07:32
as to what broadcasting was i hadn't
07:33
troubled to find out
07:36
and they gave him the job
07:41
um when so do you know why remote
07:43
controls were what was the main
07:44
attraction of them how they were
07:46
marketed remote controls what for tv
07:48
yeah isn't that what we're calling don't
07:49
have to get up and walk over to the
07:50
thing presumably it is that but their
07:52
main strategy in the marketing was it
07:54
was after itv came about and adverts
07:56
came about and remote controls were just
07:58
volume controls and they looked like one
08:00
of those rotary phones so they were like
08:01
a dial which you just dialed up or down
08:03
and it was so you could meet the adverts
08:05
so adverts came onto tv and immediately
08:08
they marketed something that could make
08:09
them shut there was one really early
08:12
there was one really early remote
08:13
control that was done by light and the
08:15
problem with it was that when um the sun
08:17
shone on it it would turn the channel
08:19
over
08:22
there's a great um i i was talking about
08:24
this in the office a few days ago and i
08:25
can't verify this fact and i really want
08:27
to
08:28
go anyone who knows this show i'm known
08:30
as the dubious one on the show um
08:33
not just on this show just in life the
08:35
way i do any research for this show is
08:37
to put in the fact and then put plus
08:39
yeti that's my kind of research for this
08:41
show that's how bad i am at it but uh i
08:44
i read a fact in a book years ago when i
08:45
first moved to england and it was the
08:47
fact that when they doing when they did
08:48
live tv dramas they would have a thing
08:50
where obviously it was black and white
08:52
everything had to be done live as they
08:53
were going along and the actors if they
08:55
forgot their lines as they were doing
08:57
this play live they would mime speaking
08:59
and then the other actor would mime
09:01
speaking back at them so that while the
09:03
production were quickly trying to find
09:05
cards that could show them what the next
09:06
line was the people at home were going
09:08
what the hell's wrong with the tv our
09:09
sound's gone again and get up and hit it
09:12
and then by the time they remember the
09:13
line they'd be like we should go to the
09:14
shops and then they're back into the
09:15
play but i can't prove this as a fact so
09:17
if anyone listening or anyone in this
09:19
room tonight knows it uh please let me
09:21
know yeah yeah
09:23
don't don't wait up for the post
09:25
um accents oh go on what no what was
09:28
yours well i've got smacks and girls and
09:30
stuff to talk about you know foreign
09:31
accent syndrome
09:33
oh yeah it's a real thing so it's not
09:35
just mad people making it up i
09:37
kind of use you know when someone wakes
09:39
up like terrible psychiatrists
09:42
yeah i would um but yeah it's a real
09:44
thing so it happens if you have a
09:45
particularly bad migraine you can get
09:46
foreign accent syndrome but it's not why
09:48
you wake up with an a specific for an
09:50
accent it's just where you wake up with
09:51
an accent that sounds kind of like a
09:52
foreign accent so there's like an
09:54
interview with this woman julie mathias
09:55
who just had a migraine and now speaks
09:57
in this bizarre kind of scandinavian
10:01
indian south african hybrid um and i
10:04
think it's really horrible for hercules
10:05
it must be tough right also capgras
10:07
syndrome do you know that one it's where
10:10
you believe that one of your loved ones
10:12
has actually been um has died and been
10:14
replaced by a robot or something like
10:16
that
10:18
yeah yeah
10:20
what
10:21
no like we all had it like that time
10:23
when my dad died and was replaced by a
10:25
robot
10:27
yeah but that actually happened yeah but
10:29
for people with the syndrome yeah
10:32
but if you google this and look for
10:33
examples of it happening there's like
10:35
one pretty much one or two examples on
10:37
the bbc news and the most famous person
10:39
to have it done was called alan davis
10:42
really yeah
10:44
and i always wanted to run that on qi
10:45
but thought no not really
10:47
just in case it's actually him yeah all
10:49
right
10:50
i can't believe you're mocking me on qui
10:52
do you wanna hear something cool about
10:53
uh the queen's accent yeah so they've
10:56
done a study on her but without her okay
10:59
they've
11:01
they've listened to the queen's speech
11:03
from three from different decades so
11:04
they listened to loads from the 1950s
11:06
and then they listened to loads from the
11:07
1980s and they found that she no longer
11:09
speaks the queen's english
11:11
so they measured loads of sounds surely
11:13
by definition what she says is
11:15
that's true but they it was a study at
11:17
macquarie university in australia and
11:19
they said that her accent has drifted a
11:20
bit so she sounds a bit um like some
11:23
younger and i'm using their words she
11:24
sounds jamaican now sounds dramatic
11:27
they said she's she has cockney
11:29
influences now apparently yeah i mean
11:31
you can't tell apparently most of the
11:32
changes it was 12 or 13 vowel sounds she
11:35
says you'll get me yeah
11:38
um
11:39
why can't we tell if she has it machines
11:42
can hear it apparently computers can
11:43
hear machines
11:45
like that my dad yeah
11:49
um
11:50
but they they they were so happy to
11:52
study her because and these are the
11:53
words she hasn't lived in different
11:55
communities that might alter her accent
11:57
yeah
11:58
no kidding um
12:00
so you reckon she got it off tv or
12:02
something i don't know maybe yeah she
12:04
has a fact she's a huge fan of um i
12:06
think yeah
12:08
yeah it's a miracle museum is still good
12:10
you should see your tweets to me
12:13
um
12:14
she didn't do a speech in 1969 there was
12:16
no queen speech on tv and the reason was
12:18
she had already done one interview that
12:20
year
12:21
in the summer for a
12:22
documentary and it changed her accent so
12:24
much because she couldn't bear well she
12:26
just said that's enough you get one one
12:28
dose of queenie a year and that was it
12:30
for 1969. so she did it
12:32
yeah that's great um we used to speak
12:34
rotic english didn't we which is how the
12:35
americans speak english the way
12:37
americans speak is the way that uh is
12:39
proper english is the english that we
12:41
were speaking in the 17th century
12:44
uh yeah we don't pronounce ours and
12:45
that's wrong and that's because spelling
12:46
hasn't kept up with the way we speak
12:48
what do you mean don't pronounce like
12:50
oh god i'm not going to think of any
12:52
examples now um
12:54
so you know if we said i've just got the
12:55
word somerset written down here so if we
12:57
say somerset they'd say summer set
12:59
summer although that she just sounds
13:00
like a summerset
13:04
since i'm my forte say someone said dan
13:06
you've got a summer set yeah exactly
13:09
like cover and garden
13:11
but there's no r in covenant
13:13
he's got it wrong
13:15
this is the biggest contention i have a
13:17
messed up accent i know i have a best of
13:19
accent the main tweet outside of
13:21
archer's hatred towards me
13:23
that i get is people listening to our
13:25
show saying why are you saying cover
13:28
garden like i get so much [ __ ] from my
13:30
accent what about the child who listens
13:31
to the podcast oh there's a child who
13:33
listens to our podcasts they're they're
13:35
three four years old yeah three four
13:36
years old the godmother wrote in to us
13:38
to say that james every time uh you're
13:40
you talk my my little goddaughter she
13:43
smiles and she's so happy how nice yeah
13:45
and then when dan comes on she frowns
13:48
and looks disappointed and stops
13:50
listening
13:53
really splitting accent okay let's go
13:56
back to the point in hand yeah i want to
13:57
speak about wilfred pickles so this was
14:00
a guy with a northern accent who read
14:01
the news uh he also was the host of the
14:04
first british quiz show to give away
14:06
prizes it was called have a go and the
14:08
jackpot was three pounds
14:11
oh that's that's good doesn't it well it
14:13
was more than i suppose but still yeah
14:15
it's not who wants to be a millionaire
14:16
is it
14:17
who wants to own three pounds
14:18
[Laughter]
14:23
but they got an audience of 26 million
14:27
if you think about what breakoff got
14:29
what 13 million last week 12 million
14:31
this was uh up to 1967 he did it yeah a
14:34
lot more people used to watch yeah but
14:36
they didn't
14:37
they didn't have back then
14:40
what was he what was the fact that you
14:41
told me in the office the other day
14:42
about um the like attire and stuff when
14:45
they when they were recording
14:47
in radio early radio about what they had
14:49
to wear i actually know this is funny
14:50
okay yes no i do remember dan yes in the
14:54
30s the british news readers had to wear
14:56
dinner suit even though you couldn't see
14:57
them when they were reading the news on
14:58
the radio i really like that you can
15:00
tell though you can tell with the voice
15:02
except setting up properly they won't be
15:03
slouching like i am now are they
15:06
is that why was that the justification
15:07
yeah i think it gives you a better
15:09
you know posture a better accent yeah
15:11
just you know just being being annoying
15:14
about it sure yeah
15:15
for anyone listening we're all wearing
15:17
dinner jackets
15:20
some animals have accents don't they but
15:21
not all what
15:23
i'm trying to distinguish which animals
15:25
do which don't no no they do
15:27
so people tend to think that like hardly
15:29
animal and hardly any animals have
15:30
accents like animals is in their dreams
15:32
the way the way they speak but then
15:34
farmers in the north of england reported
15:35
that i think it was i think this might
15:37
have been where i just read somerset it
15:39
was a somerset farmer who said that his
15:40
cows had a different accent to the
15:42
farmers in surrounding counties
15:45
oh this is the social thing they do they
15:47
move in
15:48
that one that won an egg nobel prize
15:49
didn't it yeah cows moo in regional
15:52
accents yeah yeah a very appeared review
15:54
scientific paper that um and
15:57
babies as well babies have regional
15:59
activities
16:02
no babies go french and german babies
16:04
have different ways of saying
16:07
neither of them sound like that german
16:09
ones go
16:10
ah and
16:12
i'm paraphrasing and french babies going
16:14
yeah
16:16
okay there is a difference machines can
16:18
hear it my
16:20
dad um
16:22
we should we should wrap up on our first
16:24
fact uh we got anything else anyone want
16:26
to add anything
16:27
uh apparently the announcers on the bbc
16:29
if they would cough during a broadcast
16:31
they would be inundated with cough
16:33
lozenges and woolen underwear because
16:35
everyone was scared that they had a car
16:36
so guys whenever you want to start
16:37
throwing
16:40
oh that's really good okay um
16:42
yeah yeah go for it just to go in case
16:43
we don't come back onto the subject of
16:44
radio for
16:45
loads of podcasts um when women's uh
16:47
began in 1946 it was hosted by a man
16:51
early early items on the show included
16:53
cooking with whale meat
16:55
i married a lion tamer
16:57
and how to hang your husband's suit
17:00
[Laughter]
17:01
true
17:04
great in fact okay um
17:07
time for fact number two uh and that is
17:09
my fact and my fact this week is that in
17:12
china if you want to empty a building of
17:15
people a building full of people if you
17:16
want to empty it you play this song
17:20
[Music]
17:22
don't get up and leave if you hear this
17:24
[Music]
17:27
and it doesn't work apparently
17:29
[Music]
17:32
so
17:33
this is
17:34
does anyone know what that is
17:36
no one okay anyone can even guess the
17:38
artist
17:40
yes
17:41
oh five points
17:43
yeah
17:44
now i've this is a weird thing no one in
17:46
this country in the uk seems to know who
17:47
kenny g is kenny g is one of the biggest
17:49
artists in the world and in my heart uh
17:52
he's
17:53
sold 75 million albums uh worldwide he
17:57
uh played at the inauguration of bill
17:59
clinton he worked on the bodyguard
18:01
soundtrack if you watch the grammys in
18:03
the 90s invariably at some point michael
18:05
bolton would rock on stage next to kenny
18:07
g and they would own it uh and the
18:09
interesting thing is that since the year
18:11
2000 in 1989 this song came out and it
18:14
got really big it's called going home by
18:15
kenny g and for some reason it got
18:18
adopted and no one really knows why in
18:20
china as the going home song so at the
18:22
end of the day
18:26
why why did they choose it
18:29
why didn't they choose melody and b
18:32
wake me up before you go go what
18:36
so they basically it's a tune that just
18:39
gets played everywhere at schools at the
18:41
end of school they play it to kids to go
18:43
home if you're on a train that's
18:44
entering the final stop of its
18:46
destination the terminal uh they play
18:49
that song everywhere in china in a
18:51
marketplace they'll play it on luke for
18:52
an hour and a half to tell you to get
18:54
out people aren't really getting the
18:56
hint if you have to play it for an hour
18:58
and a half
18:59
at the end of a party presumably you
19:01
play that when you want everyone well
19:02
when because as a result this song he
19:03
doesn't get any royalties from it but he
19:05
plays a lot of gigs in china now he had
19:07
to make sure that he put that song at
19:08
the end otherwise people start leaving
19:10
during the gig but this is this is an
19:12
insane thing
19:13
if you did get royalties though he would
19:15
be richer than bill gates if they play
19:16
it for an hour and a half at every day
19:18
at the closing of a month not only that
19:19
when tv used to end at say like 12 a.m
19:22
or 11 p.m whenever it is in china up
19:24
until 6 a.m when it came back on it
19:26
would be on loop that was the song that
19:28
played kenny g is massive in china
19:31
i i have i read a few
19:33
accounts from chinese people saying i'm
19:35
pretty sick of this song now
19:38
i liked it the first time i heard it and
19:40
now i really don't so i think yeah so i
19:43
hadn't heard of kenny g oh no i had
19:44
heard of him i didn't know what he was
19:45
but i think that's us being musically
19:46
illiterate i think everyone else in
19:48
britain i think you're tarring british
19:49
people with our brush by saying no one's
19:51
heard of kenny no no no one in this room
19:53
except one person right
19:56
okay yeah well done so the only thing so
19:58
i was like i haven't heard of this guy i
19:59
don't really listen to music that was
20:01
you know made in the last 40 years so i
20:03
just decided i'll look up something
20:04
about music uh i know he's kind of
20:06
jazzed let's look up a circular
20:08
breathing the longest musical note ever
20:11
held lasted 45 minutes and 47 seconds
20:15
and the record was set by kenny g yeah
20:17
it was so great
20:21
well i like playing golf and i looked up
20:23
who's the best musician who plays golf
20:25
and it's kenny g
20:27
it really is everywhere he's off plus
20:29
0.8 and many years ago kenny g woke up
20:32
one morning when his uncle said i have a
20:35
business uh my friend is running and i
20:38
think you might be interested you should
20:39
buy some stocks into it they make coffee
20:41
and he went i'll buy some stocks and he
20:43
now has made almost as much money off
20:45
the back of the fact that he put stocks
20:47
into starbucks before it launched as as
20:50
much as he's made from his 75 million
20:52
albums so should we boycott him now
20:54
[Laughter]
20:57
i have been doing an unconscious boycott
20:58
of him all my life
21:03
no i didn't know who kenny g was either
21:05
and i am i googled kenny g is and the
21:08
first two are kenny g is my imaginary
21:11
friend
21:13
and kenny g is katy perry's uncle
21:16
and i looked it up and he isn't
21:18
i
21:19
have no idea what that's about at all
21:22
and then i spent the rest of the
21:23
afternoon googling katy perry's uncle
21:25
who is even less interesting than kenny
21:27
g
21:29
what's he do who is he uh he's a
21:31
director of movies he's dead now oh okay
21:34
oh
21:35
bit of a downer you didn't even know him
21:38
and in fairness guys he was a robot
21:44
breathing there was a thing uh in greece
21:46
called the disfigurement of athens and
21:49
it's written about by some some greek
21:51
writers and apparently that was a weird
21:53
facial disfigurement you would get if
21:54
you did too much circular breathing oh
21:56
really what's that like
21:58
i don't know how you do it no how you do
22:01
circular breathing yeah i read i read
22:02
about how to do it the other day and i
22:04
still it's i can't do it you save a
22:06
little bit of air in the in your mouth
22:08
and then you breathe through your nose
22:10
is it how people beat
22:14
yeah yeah um so jazz he's jazz right
22:16
that's what he does otherwise i've been
22:18
reading about the wrongs yeah yeah yeah
22:20
yeah yeah yeah let's say he's just
22:21
saying he plays the saxophone dizzy
22:23
gillespie round for president did you
22:25
know that what uh
22:27
19th of america in 1964. he ran a joke
22:30
campaign for president he promised to
22:32
rename the white house the blues house
22:33
and a point
22:35
and he was going to appoint duke
22:36
ellington as his secretary of state and
22:38
miles davis is head of the cia
22:40
which would have been miles davis
22:43
he also uh dizzy gillespie couldn't hit
22:46
um in since 19 from 1949 he was unable
22:49
to hit the b flat above high c on his
22:51
trumpet because he had a very very minor
22:53
bicycling accident but he got a thousand
22:55
dollars which i think was quite a lot in
22:57
1949 sure um in compensation for it
22:59
because it's damaged his art but could
23:01
never hit that high b flat yeah
23:04
wait a minute cycling accident just a
23:06
twisted ankle yeah stopped him from
23:08
being able to hit a high weird
23:10
yeah
23:11
maybe he was winded or something like
23:12
that you can sue for damaging your arm
23:15
your arms
23:23
just checking
23:25
another influential jazz person most
23:27
influential guitarist of all time
23:30
uh jimi hendrix i was gonna go with
23:32
django reinhardt or maybe we're talking
23:33
about jazz guitar oh okay and was
23:35
missing the two main guitar playing
23:36
fingers in here yeah yeah yeah so only
23:38
ever did solos on two fingers didn't he
23:40
die because he refused to go to a doctor
23:42
yes i think he did yeah he had a minor
23:45
medical condition he didn't go to a
23:46
doctor and then it got bad and then he
23:47
died does anyone know what can you
23:49
remember what he had don't remember no
23:51
just speaking of uh django um this is
23:53
this is a very weird link but it's
23:54
something i was when i was looking into
23:56
all the stuff about michael bolt sorry
23:58
kenny g being massive in china it is
24:00
curious when you find out about people
24:01
who are big in in other countries who
24:04
aren't sort of as like like um norman
24:06
wisdom being massive in albania yeah
24:08
like norman wisdom is huge still to this
24:10
day in albania when he died it was
24:12
almost a national holiday and they just
24:13
they have national holidays
24:20
finally finally the hated wisdom is
24:22
removed
24:22
[Laughter]
24:25
when kenny g dies
24:27
a lot of chinese society will celebrate
24:29
not having to listen to this song
24:30
anymore that's true that's true oh come
24:32
on
24:34
there's there's a lot of kenny g love in
24:35
your room um yeah it's it's like people
24:38
more famous in other countries yeah yeah
24:39
so i was reading about people who are
24:40
more famous the list of americans or
24:42
just people um foreign people to china
24:45
uh being big there it's quite it's quite
24:47
interesting the most famous person in
24:48
china is kobe bryant who's a basketball
24:50
player
24:51
which i did not most famous person in
24:53
all of china well i no my theory is that
24:55
it's actually mr bean uh which and then
24:58
at number three mao zedong
25:00
[Laughter]
25:07
yeah it's a phrase
25:09
no it's the most famous foreigner okay
25:11
yeah yeah yeah
25:12
it's
25:16
these people are getting bigger and
25:17
bigger and as a result um there's a
25:19
really interesting thing going on with
25:21
the movie world at the moment which is
25:22
that the chinese movie world has now
25:24
overtaken bollywood it's taken over
25:26
everything except america they're the
25:27
second largest movie makers in the world
25:29
and so as a result of these people's
25:30
names getting quite big they're getting
25:32
put into movies now and being sold to
25:34
china and as a result so the top film in
25:36
china last year was transformers above
25:39
anything in the world right they
25:40
absolutely loved it the latest
25:41
transformers movie that came out um but
25:43
they do this really interesting thing
25:45
where they have to edit out certain bits
25:47
of the movie as it exists because it
25:49
turns out there's a lot of anti-chinese
25:51
government stuff in movies that we don't
25:53
realize so when movies go out suddenly
25:55
there's a missing five minutes where a
25:57
character has been taken out and it
25:59
suddenly just doesn't make sense cloud
26:00
atlas they took out 43 minutes of the
26:02
movie when they took the china that you
26:05
can argue that it could miss 43 minutes
26:07
couldn't do that i haven't seen it i
26:08
haven't seen it in when the sound of
26:10
music came out in south korea it was
26:12
really really popular and like cinemas
26:15
were playing it four or five times a day
26:16
and one cinema owner wanted to work out
26:18
a way that he could play it more times a
26:19
day to get more cust paying customers in
26:22
so he edited out all the songs
26:24
that's amazing
26:26
that's like if anyone heard an episode
26:28
that we did uh i think it was last week
26:30
of the week before chuck norris when he
26:32
plays his movies to his kids doesn't
26:34
like the idea of his kids seeing the
26:35
fight scenes in the chuck norris movies
26:37
so he personally edits out all the fight
26:39
scenes from his movies and his kids just
26:41
watch it and i cannot think of a worse
26:43
experience
26:44
than watching a fightless sound of music
26:46
without any songs
26:48
it's just called of i can
26:59
[Laughter]
27:03
when i said django the reason i said
27:04
that is django unchained the quentin
27:06
tarantino movie yeah went into china and
27:08
it was pulled minutes from all the
27:09
cinemas when it started because they had
27:10
a nude scene and they don't allow nudity
27:13
in movies now that's not anti-china
27:15
propaganda
27:18
no it's just it's uh they have strict
27:20
laws still with with
27:21
the other thing is that china is the
27:23
biggest as in the amount of money they
27:25
take not the number of movies they make
27:26
i think um yeah yes because it's in
27:29
hollywood bollywood hollywood which is
27:31
nice
27:32
yeah they do this thing as well now so
27:34
you know like when we watch a james bond
27:35
movie how they take out you just see
27:37
richard branson suddenly in it and it's
27:38
obviously a virgin ad or it's just
27:40
product placement the whole way through
27:41
they reshoot scenes with chinese product
27:44
placement so which movie was it here uh
27:46
it was during world war z
27:49
um
27:50
uh great movie great film great movie um
27:53
it is a great film what's it worldwide
27:55
you like pacific rim as your greatest
27:57
movie
27:58
come on
28:00
thank you oh my goodness jaeger's
28:02
forever all right
28:04
i saw i saw an edited version of uh
28:06
world war z because i was on a plane
28:08
watching it because that's when you
28:10
should watch world war z and
28:12
they edited out the bit with the
28:13
enormous plane zombie scene which ends
28:16
with the plane crashing
28:18
really really yeah weird right we need
28:20
sensors let us watch the scene
28:24
that's fair we should we should move on
28:26
we've done quite a lot i just want to
28:27
say one more thing so this kenny g's
28:30
real name is
28:31
kenneth kenneth gorlick kenneth golick
28:34
yeah and i thought i'd check and see if
28:36
i had anything on him in my files on my
28:38
computer and i didn't have anything on
28:40
him but i did have something on another
28:42
kenneth garlic
28:43
and this is that is a weird coincidence
28:47
yeah kenneth j garlick this is
28:49
he's a medic and he wrote a paper called
28:52
a four-letter word in the medical
28:54
literature and he went through all
28:55
medical literature looking for instances
28:57
of the word [ __ ]
28:59
okay he found 17 instances since the
29:02
1960s
29:03
um four were about a fungus called [ __ ]
29:06
two were two were sexual
29:09
uh and six were the author
29:11
okay
29:13
what do you mean as in the name of the
29:15
author all right sorry so hero the most
29:17
prolific single contributor was dr e
29:19
[ __ ] whose four german language
29:21
publications on the malic acid
29:23
metabolism of saccharology
29:26
constitutes a major contribution to the
29:28
field
29:29
this may be about to change with the
29:31
emergence of dr l [ __ ]
29:33
as a co-author of a publication in 1999
29:37
so look out for those new [ __ ]
29:42
okay uh let's move on to fact number
29:44
three and that is chozinski uh
29:48
yeah it is
29:49
uh
29:52
my fact is that the two leading
29:55
paleontologists of the 19th century used
29:57
to destroy their fossil sites after
29:58
excavating them so that their rival
30:01
wasn't able to find anything on them
30:03
that's insane and so and these really
30:06
were the two by far and away the leading
30:08
paleontologist so they were edward
30:09
drinker cope and othniel charles marsh
30:12
othniel yeah that's right that's his
30:13
name got a problem with that no
30:16
no ma'am
30:19
it's just a brilliant name it's good so
30:20
before they came along there were nine
30:22
species of dinosaur had been uh
30:23
discovered and named and between the two
30:25
of them uh by the time they both died
30:27
they'd named 136 species between them
30:29
including all the ones you've heard of
30:31
all the big ones stegosaurus diplodocus
30:32
triceratops all those guys and they kind
30:35
of liked each other at first so they met
30:36
in 1867 and they named species after one
30:39
another so a giant serpent from new
30:42
jersey was called mosasaurus kopianus
30:46
after cope and vice versa yeah i'm not
30:48
sure that was because he liked him
30:49
because it actually is cope anus
30:52
copy artist is it that's what it is yeah
30:54
so i think that might have been an
30:55
insult
30:57
if only you've been there to tell him he
30:59
thought they were best friends i think
31:00
this is why he was so upset [ __ ]
31:02
asaurus
31:06
um
31:07
so relationship went sour when cope
31:09
showed off this fossil of an
31:10
elasmosaurus um at a big like showing of
31:13
nephi's discovered classic focus yeah
31:17
not at the end yet uh who did that put
31:20
the head on the wrong end of it and
31:22
marshall i think you put the head on on
31:23
the tail and cope was like no i haven't
31:25
you know you're wrong and i called in
31:26
the museum curator the academy curator
31:29
who said yeah you put head on the wrong
31:31
end and he was so humiliated by that
31:32
that marsh wrote that after that he's
31:34
been my bitter enemy um and it was so
31:37
extreme they spent 25 years stealing
31:39
each other's fossils they both employed
31:41
teams of sort of spies to go and
31:43
jeopardize each other's sights so they'd
31:45
steal and break each other's fossils and
31:47
one of the marsh got into government so
31:48
that he could withdraw funding from the
31:50
other guy there was this a constant
31:52
exchange of letters where one would say
31:54
some of my fossils are damaged and have
31:55
disappeared i know you're responsible
31:57
and the other one would write back going
31:58
uh it's outrageous that you'd accuse me
32:00
of that but since you mentioned it some
32:01
of my fossils
32:03
and it's just 25 years of this wow it
32:06
was called the bone wars the bone wars
32:08
how would they destroy each other's
32:11
sort of well dynamite was how marsh did
32:13
it dynamite yeah so they would just they
32:16
would find their bit and then go there
32:18
may be lots more here but i'm just gonna
32:20
yeah just in case there is or i think if
32:22
they couldn't carry stuff back or if
32:23
they they'd found the thing they needed
32:24
to find they couldn't carry stuff back
32:31
or maybe they thought they would propel
32:33
it back with the dynamite
32:37
i read that
32:38
on one occasion their two teams of
32:40
researchers even had a stone-throwing
32:41
battle against each other they hate yeah
32:45
they hated each other they were throwing
32:47
their muscles at each other yeah no i
32:49
think they're just yeah
32:51
and it was quite even though they were
32:52
obviously really successful a what are
32:54
we missing that we could have and b was
32:55
quite damaging to their like how good
32:57
they were at their work because they
32:58
constantly rushed to have stuff
32:59
published before the other person and
33:01
this is whence the brontosaurus cock-up
33:03
came about
33:04
so marsh off neil marsh um named the
33:07
apatosaurus and then he thought he found
33:09
a different dinosaur and he named it the
33:10
brontosaurus and that was a really
33:12
catchy name because it means like
33:13
thunderhorse or something and it turned
33:16
out that um it wasn't a bronze source it
33:17
was just another apatosaurus and
33:20
by that and that was just because he'd
33:21
sped it through because he must publish
33:22
more papers than and he won the bone
33:24
wars in the end because he named 80 new
33:26
species and um copenhagen 56. i don't
33:29
think there were that many winners on
33:30
this really
33:32
i remember
33:38
well are you my teacher
33:41
when bones fight each other nobody wins
33:45
i i read that they died um
33:50
dinosaurs
34:00
so yeah so after cope
34:03
marsh when he got into government he
34:04
devoted his yeah as you say he made
34:07
himself hugely powerful just so he could
34:09
fight the other guy but then he tried to
34:10
take um he tried to take copes fossils
34:13
away from him and that was his crucial
34:14
misstep because
34:16
um he said these were these were found
34:17
with government money and and and dug up
34:19
with government money therefore the
34:20
government owns them and we're going to
34:21
take your collection away from you but
34:23
cope proved that he paid for all of his
34:25
own and yeah the receipts kept the
34:26
receipts right kept the receipts yeah
34:27
and he he destroyed marsha's reputation
34:29
by showing that martial behaved so
34:31
unethically so then march lost his job
34:33
in government lost all his income lost
34:34
everything cope died 56 years old
34:37
penniless marsh died two years after
34:39
that and he had 186 dollars left you see
34:42
anna no winners
34:43
[Music]
34:43
[Laughter]
34:48
dinosaurs are all
34:49
they named 142 dinosaurs but only 30
34:53
are actual they're still dinosaurs they
34:54
got over excited
34:56
a lot of them were mistakes they made
34:57
what 110 fake dinosaurs
35:01
rushed to beat the other guy they're not
35:02
vague we just weren't as good a
35:03
classifying species then yeah um cool
35:06
dinosaur thing um the most complete or
35:08
one of the most complete fossils we have
35:10
of a t-rex was wrapped around and with
35:13
its teeth embedded in the most complete
35:15
fossil we have over triceratops wow it's
35:17
really cool um so annoyingly it went
35:20
straight to bonhams and they're trying
35:21
to sell it for something like 12 like 10
35:23
million dollars or something so they
35:24
haven't got signed into verified
35:26
recently yeah last year
35:28
and they were saying about how uh
35:30
t-rexes would have eaten them and they
35:32
would have like taken their head off
35:34
like a tin opener kind of thing is that
35:36
something because his teeth were
35:37
embedded in its neck the teeth had come
35:39
out of the t-rex and were in this so
35:41
that was the theory that they would just
35:42
cut around the neck and take the head
35:44
off and eat the inside so then it was
35:45
doing this and there was an earthquake
35:46
they think and which caused um sand to
35:49
fall on top of them and they sort of
35:50
sunk into the sinking sand and they were
35:51
forever embraced for 60 million years
35:54
they've been embraced as if it wasn't
35:56
exciting enough with dinosaurs fighting
35:57
then there was an earthquake
35:59
that's amazing incredible you don't get
36:01
that kind of entertainment anymore
36:05
um i read the very first dinosaur bone
36:07
that was ever found uh was at the time
36:10
not thought to be a dinosaur bone it was
36:12
in retrospective kind of looking at the
36:13
drawings of the thing that was described
36:16
and it was a guy called robert plot oh
36:18
yeah um and uh robert plott he thought
36:20
what he'd found was not a dinosaur but a
36:23
giant
36:24
which is incredible he thought he was
36:26
looking at this bone he was like this
36:27
must be a giant man and and so he told
36:30
everyone that that's what he thought it
36:31
was yeah it was actually um it was a top
36:34
of the thigh bone and because of the
36:36
shape of the top of the thigh bone of a
36:38
dinosaur it's quite hard to imagine that
36:40
but because of its shape um they called
36:42
it scrotum humanum
36:44
because they look like a giant scrotum
36:46
and the thing is that they giant balls
36:50
is that what he thought it was that
36:51
wasn't him that was richard brooks who
36:53
thought that but he came a little bit
36:54
later he he thought it was a giant um
36:56
like an elephant or something like that
36:58
right but then they came along called it
36:59
scrotum humanum and then they realized
37:01
it was a megalosaurus bone but according
37:04
to the rules of nomenclature they should
37:06
keep the first thing that it was called
37:08
so the megalosaurus should really be
37:09
called scrotum humanum
37:12
that's so good
37:13
so the thing i really liked about this
37:15
guy though robert plot um he was quite
37:16
an influential character back in the day
37:18
uh when it came to science and
37:20
classifying things and pushing forward
37:21
ideas um he also wrote about and i'd not
37:24
heard about this until today when i was
37:26
looking into him he wrote about the
37:27
first ever noted double sunset
37:31
what yeah double have you heard about
37:33
this okay so he noticed it in leak which
37:35
i've not heard of either i don't know
37:37
it's famous for it i think if you're if
37:38
you're from anywhere near leak like
37:40
they're known for their don't know for
37:41
the double sunset it's amazing what is
37:42
it no no i don't know it's a real thing
37:44
it's a real thing it's just where the
37:45
contours of the earth are aligned such
37:48
that when the sun sets on a certain day
37:49
of the year i think it's on the solstice
37:51
um it looks like it sets over one hill
37:53
and then because of the distance a
37:55
certain hill behind it is it rises up
37:57
again and sets again it's just look at
37:59
it on youtube it's a real phenomenon
38:02
it's
38:09
another thing just on rivalries that i
38:11
really like is that um
38:13
there's so much academic warfare that
38:14
goes on it's not just with the dinosaur
38:16
hunters um you look through any bit of
38:18
history up until now i tweeted once
38:20
saying where does outer space begin and
38:22
that sparked a huge debate on twitter
38:23
for ages where no one knew where outer
38:25
space technically began uh so i loved
38:27
collecting these little things and i
38:28
found this thing that the uh the first
38:29
mobile phone call ever placed was in
38:32
april the third on april the 3rd 1973.
38:35
there was a guy called martin cooper he
38:37
invented it uh and uh
38:39
he basically worked for motorola and his
38:41
very first phone call when he was like
38:44
we've made the mobile phone let's do
38:45
this his very first phone call was to
38:47
the rivals at a t to say that they've
38:49
gone there first how cool is that he
38:51
called and we got there suckers bye
38:54
and hung up that was the very first
38:56
mobile phone call ever made 1973.
38:59
um we need to move on by the way oh
39:00
should we just quickly talk about what
39:02
bastard edison was go for it yeah
39:05
it's about bloody time i think it is so
39:08
obviously uh edison is credited with a
39:10
great deal he was propaganda maestro
39:12
and he came up with dc current while
39:15
tesla was coming up with ac current
39:16
which is what is used most mostly around
39:19
the world now because it's much more
39:20
useful it travels longer distances etc
39:22
but edison waged such a strong campaign
39:24
against tesla and against ac current to
39:27
the extent that he wrote to the uh
39:29
society of the prevention of cruelty to
39:30
animals in the us and asked them to send
39:33
him a bunch of dogs cats sheeps horses
39:36
and elephants to electrocute using ac
39:39
current to prove that it was dangerous
39:41
and the prevention recorded to animal
39:42
society said yes of course here you have
39:44
some animals
39:45
feel free to electrocute them at your
39:47
convenience
39:49
and uh
39:50
they're not really doing their job are
39:51
they he did that in public something was
39:53
going on there i think in the
39:54
electrocuted
39:57
which is just the most traumatic thing
39:59
so topsy was um a circus elephant who
40:02
basically she killed one guy who poked
40:04
her in the face or something and so she
40:06
was supposed to be hanged as elephants
40:08
tended to be when they were executed
40:11
they used to hate they used to hang
40:12
elephants what
40:13
the best way to do it it's not the best
40:15
way to do it i mean
40:19
this is the source of a lot of
40:20
contention in the qa office yeah
40:27
[Laughter]
40:35
okay time to move on
40:38
to our final facts
40:40
andy murray my fact is that um mozilla
40:44
firefox translates its uh computer
40:46
systems into hundreds of different
40:47
languages um but lots of the metaphors
40:49
don't translate so things like cookies
40:51
or files or or mouse things like that so
40:54
in senegal in the fula language a
40:56
computer crash is known as a hookie
40:58
which means a cow falling over but not
41:00
dying
41:03
isn't that good
41:04
and they they have all kinds all of
41:05
these things they're translating them
41:06
using local idioms and local um
41:09
languages so a timeout is a hanama which
41:11
means your fish has gone away
41:16
and
41:17
i don't really get this one but aspect
41:19
ratio me
41:21
is translated as jean dondero which is a
41:24
rebuke from elders when a fishing net is
41:26
wrongly woven you don't get that i don't
41:29
no do you know what aspect ratio is not
41:30
really no
41:31
[Laughter]
41:33
i'm thinking about it now i do get it
41:34
yeah
41:35
i think that's quite good it's kind of
41:36
like a fishing net isn't it when it's
41:38
wrongly woven i'm bluffing i still don't
41:40
know what it is
41:41
never mind i do like it when yeah so
41:44
when when
41:45
interesting linguistic metaphors i guess
41:47
and i think we might have been more fun
41:48
with them in in the olden days so in the
41:51
1800s they referred to ducks or any
41:54
birds with feet quite close to their
41:55
bums as ass feet and if you read
41:59
like
42:00
natural science journals and stuff
42:01
they'll say the odds the ass foot duck
42:03
present here or the ass foot present
42:05
here was wasn't the grieb formerly known
42:07
as an ass foot it would have been yeah
42:08
yeah
42:09
which one is known as a wind [ __ ]
42:11
that's a kestrel castro or a kite
42:14
because they stay hovering against the
42:16
wind yeah
42:20
so um computer words in hawaiian the
42:22
word for computer literally means
42:24
electric brain
42:26
that's um
42:27
yeah and in iceland the computer is
42:29
known as a tulva which means number
42:31
prophetess
42:33
that's good isn't it that's really nice
42:35
i like it's a female as well yeah yeah
42:38
yeah and um they they're old
42:40
standard
42:42
their old word for a pager was oh i
42:44
can't pronounce that um frith flyofur
42:48
which means thief of the peace
42:51
wow
42:52
that's good
42:53
that's incredible um yeah so speaking of
42:56
women and computers first person to
42:58
write computer code was a woman right
42:59
who i think we've talked about who yeah
43:01
she's here tonight
43:03
welcome to the stage 350 year old please
43:06
come up uh ada loveless or lovelace i
43:08
never know how to describe byron byron's
43:12
although she was never allowed to see
43:14
him because her understandably her mum
43:16
hated him so much yeah
43:18
um yeah she was also she wrote the
43:20
world's first computer code um
43:22
in 1842 and it was because she worked
43:24
with charles babbage didn't she who made
43:26
the analytical
43:27
engine was that what it was called yeah
43:29
um and it wasn't called a computer
43:31
because originally computers were people
43:32
who did sums yes you would say i'll just
43:35
go and turn on the computer
43:36
no you wouldn't
43:41
that's too wrong in too many ways
43:44
my mom always you know parents have like
43:46
really lame jokes they do your whole
43:47
life and whenever you say to her could
43:49
you turn on the lights please she starts
43:50
flirting with the light switch
44:03
the first search engine was called
44:05
archie
44:07
oh yeah and so it's still up by this guy
44:09
called alan emtarge uh it was in the 80s
44:12
in 1983 and he was barbadian or bayesian
44:14
whatever whichever we're going to call
44:15
it and uh yeah so he set up this search
44:18
engine he did computer science and it
44:19
was called archie and because i think
44:21
like comic book fans overlap quite a lot
44:24
with computer geek people sometimes and
44:27
so everyone assumed it was named after
44:29
archie the comic book guy and so
44:30
eventually he did an interview where he
44:32
came out and he said it's not named
44:33
after archie it's named after archive
44:35
and i took the v out aren't you the
44:37
comics are the most insipid thing i've
44:39
ever read
44:41
he was not invited back to comic con the
44:42
next year
44:44
um anyway he hasn't owned a computer
44:45
since 1983.
44:47
you probably probably haven't let him
44:48
have one
44:49
so rude about their next cartoon
44:52
um
44:53
the word bug supposedly was coined in
44:54
1946 when a lady called grace hopper uh
44:58
found a moth trapped in a relay at
44:59
harvard university and she she freed
45:01
them off and then she taped it into a
45:02
book but still
45:04
the computer then worked again and
45:05
that's where people thought uh we got
45:07
the word bug from but it's not true it's
45:09
been a news since at least the 1870s
45:11
however she is amazing she is a not only
45:13
a great computer scientist she was also
45:15
a us navy rear admiral
45:17
wow she's badass there are photos of
45:19
this little old lady in an
45:20
enormous rack of medals on her chest and
45:22
you know she's got the naval proper
45:24
naval admiral hat amazing yeah
45:28
she died in about 1980 or 1990 um so in
45:32
the mid 40s 50s 60s was when she was in
45:34
her admiral and computer heyday right
45:37
yeah look her up great hopper very cool
45:38
brilliant i was looking at language
45:40
because of the language part of the fact
45:43
i was looking at the language of vanuatu
45:45
which is called bislama and this was
45:48
brought to the islands by sailors so
45:49
they're a bit you know a bit racy the um
45:52
the words and a lot of their words have
45:54
the word [ __ ] in them oh their word for
45:56
[ __ ] is sit so sit belong fire is ash so
46:00
it's the ship which is left over after a
46:02
fire is burnt which is quite good
46:04
uh sits water obviously is diarrhea
46:07
and sit belong spider is spider [ __ ] a
46:11
spider web
46:12
oh
46:13
i fell into that one
46:14
[Laughter]
46:18
and then i spent all afternoon looking
46:20
at vanuatu
46:21
basically what have you found i found
46:23
that they have pseudo-hermaphroditic
46:25
pigs on the island and these are the
46:28
pigs that they've bread and bread and
46:30
bread to have less and less testosterone
46:32
so their penises have got smaller and
46:34
smaller and smaller and now you can't
46:35
even tell they have penises and they're
46:38
pseudohermaphrodites and they're so
46:40
precious on the island that they're used
46:41
as currency
46:43
so they use pseudo hermaphroditic pigs
46:45
as currency which is the best sentence
46:48
i've ever heard
46:51
do they carry it around didn't wallet no
46:53
it's just like owning it and then you
46:54
would if you wanted to buy a house and
46:56
you had 10 of these you would like use
46:57
those
46:58
i think they use tusks as currency as
47:00
well so it takes seven years for a task
47:01
to grow in a full circle at which point
47:03
it is valuable uh after the pig it's
47:06
removed for the pig obviously or taken
47:07
but if it and if you get a double tusker
47:09
that's 14 years worth of accumulated
47:11
money so that's how to calculate what's
47:13
worth more
47:14
um i was looking at language as well and
47:16
um so fun words that exist in other
47:18
languages that we don't have words for
47:20
in english i think we should um so i
47:22
think my favorites are um
47:25
which one uh jayus or yayas in
47:27
indonesian is a joke so unfunny that you
47:29
have to laugh at it which is weird that
47:32
that's my next edinburgh show title if
47:33
anyone wants to
47:35
come along
47:36
um mangata in sweden is it literally
47:40
means moon street so it's guessable
47:43
actually but it's the do you know what
47:44
it is no
47:47
it's the so when the moon's reflecting
47:49
over a lake it's the reflection of the
47:51
moon that looks like a road um and then
47:53
sobremesa in spanish is the time spent
47:56
in conversation after a meal and it
47:57
literally means after the uh over the
47:59
table but i really like that because
48:00
that turns it into
48:02
an activity that's then kind of
48:03
justified in spending six hours doing
48:06
right yeah yeah yeah sorry mesa post
48:08
burning the washing up basically
48:11
no the the word uh this is a great it's
48:13
a swiss word and it's altos and
48:15
hinterlas
48:19
and it's the swiss word for a pension
48:20
and they just say ahv but what it means
48:22
is old age and survivors insurance
48:26
how cool is that
48:28
okay just one more thing about senegal
48:29
because uh that was the original the
48:31
original fight all the way back was
48:33
about senegal
48:34
the main language in senegal is wolof
48:36
and uh the wolof language doesn't really
48:39
have um words for colours it does have
48:41
them but they don't use them so they
48:42
don't have the word for blue and orange
48:44
and red they use the french but they do
48:46
have lots of words for shades of grey
48:49
loads and loads
48:51
no no really how many
48:52
[Laughter]
48:55
we don't know i don't know the reason
48:57
they have so many shades of grey is
48:58
because of their cast system because the
49:01
shade of your skin matters so much to
49:03
them that the different shades between
49:05
black and white are really really
49:06
important
49:07
and that's why they have so many shades
49:09
of grey and the good thing about it is
49:11
if you're a person who does a lot of art
49:13
with pencils especially uh in africa
49:16
they use all these different shades of
49:17
grey when you're deciding how much you
49:19
shade things in so they are actually
49:20
useful as well as as well as a bit
49:22
racist yeah
49:25
i'm so excited that you've mentioned
49:26
wolof because when i was reading about
49:28
jazz it's in the wolof language that
49:31
they think the word hip comes from and
49:34
it's a word in what in the world of
49:35
language called happy cat and obviously
49:37
so it's like a black culture thing jazz
49:40
and so they think hip comes from
49:41
heppycat and then a bunch of other
49:42
etymologists think that that's rubbish
49:44
and that's just sort of post-hoc
49:45
rationalization and they say there's no
49:47
actual evidence that it comes from happy
49:49
cat and so apparently among etymologists
49:51
instead of saying to cry wolf you say to
49:53
cry wolof and this is etymologist banter
49:58
to cry
50:01
start using it guys
50:03
okay
50:05

hello welcome to another episode of no
00:20
such thing as a fish
00:22
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
00:23
q offices in covent garden
00:26
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
00:27
here with andy murray james harkin and
00:29
anna chazinski
00:30
and once again we've gathered around the
00:32
microphone with our four favorite facts
00:33
from the last seven days so here we go
00:35
in no particular order
00:37
let's do it
00:40
james fact number one uh my fact this
00:43
week
00:43
is that in the 17th century there was a
00:46
prophet called
00:47
dorothy harling who would cure you of
00:49
your sins by urinating on the afflicted
00:52
part of your body
00:53
wow when you've got a sin what's the
00:56
afflicted part of your body well if
00:57
you'd been
00:58
swearing it could be your mouth right if
01:01
you'd stolen something that could be
01:02
your hands i guess
01:03
okay you thought a dirty thought your
01:06
brain should piss in your ear
01:09
she would whip people first she would
01:10
whip you first to try and get rid of the
01:12
sins and then she'd urinate on you
01:14
and she was known as the permanent
01:16
spring this sounds more like a
01:18
like a chapter from 50 shades of grey
01:20
does it
01:21
oh yeah whipping urinating on i mean
01:23
that's all very bondage based
01:25
activity it's not it wasn't uncommon to
01:27
use urine in a
01:28
weird medical way though was it in the
01:30
in around that time in the 17th century
01:32
so they had people who
01:33
would smell or or look at the color or
01:36
even sometimes the flavor
01:37
of people's urine in order to diagnose
01:39
disease and they had um
01:41
you know those color wheels you get they
01:43
had a urine wheel
01:44
like pantone yeah exactly and i had 20
01:47
different colors of urine around the
01:49
edge of it
01:49
20 shades of pee
01:54
and so then it was all to do with the
01:56
humors and whether your four humors were
01:57
in order but i think that would work i
01:59
think if your urine tasted
02:00
sweet then you might be diabetic that's
02:02
how they used to do that right yeah
02:04
yeah doctors used to diagnose you it was
02:05
called thomas willis the man who
02:06
discovered it is in 1674 he said that
02:09
diabetic people's urine
02:10
was wonderfully sweet as if it were
02:12
imbued with honey or sugar
02:13
and it was called willis's disease for a
02:15
long time diabetes because of
02:17
him discovering it um palin said that
02:20
you could use urine for a whole bunch of
02:22
uh of ailments
02:23
but stale urine mixed with ash could be
02:25
rubbed on your baby for nappy rash
02:28
which sounds just like a really
02:29
unpleasant way to be entering the world
02:30
i think there's like a mayan
02:32
tablet or something like that that says
02:34
this is about the patient if all else
02:36
fails have him remove one sandal
02:38
urinating it and drink the urine and
02:41
this was if if everything else in the
02:43
that the doctor prescribed didn't work
02:45
then that was the last thing you should
02:46
try
02:46
arm sandals are they full of holes uh
02:49
good
02:50
point i don't understand how i would
02:51
retain liquid in my sandals
02:53
um so actually drinking urine has been
02:55
thought by quacks for centuries as being
02:57
a way of
02:58
you know um solving any problems that
03:00
you have i think we mentioned it on qi
03:03
that and we have a website um address
03:05
that we bought called drinkmyurin.co.uk
03:09
and if you go into that then it takes
03:10
you to the qi website
03:12
but what that means is because we still
03:14
own it all of the qi.com
03:16
urls can also be written as
03:18
drinkmyurin.co.uk
03:20
so if you go onto
03:23
drinkmyurine.compodcast
03:24
you'll find our podcast page yeah um
03:27
speaking of drinking urine the sami
03:28
people of um scandinavia northern
03:30
scandinavia people thought for ages that
03:33
they would feed magic mushrooms to their
03:34
reindeer and then they would drink their
03:36
rainbows
03:37
yeah so and then they get high off magic
03:38
mushrooms but without getting the
03:40
poisonous effect and vomiting which is
03:42
what happens if you eat them directly if
03:43
you eat too much
03:44
and then this anthropologist came along
03:46
and debunked this whole thing and said
03:48
the sami people did not drink reindeer
03:49
urine
03:50
and then he went and interviewed a sami
03:51
person so he wrote a whole book about
03:53
how they don't
03:54
and then he met some sami people and
03:56
they were like yeah we do this all the
03:57
time
03:58
so we had to write another book saying
04:00
actually
04:02
i read a thing about um the koryak
04:04
people in siberia
04:05
they would take a sort of hallucinogenic
04:07
psychedelic mushroom
04:09
and the the mushroom would send them
04:11
insane into like beautiful psychedelic
04:13
thing the problem was it's quite
04:14
expensive
04:15
and so it has a um thing in it where
04:17
when you urinate it doesn't dilute the
04:19
hallucinogenic in it and so basically it
04:21
comes out just as strong just slightly
04:23
diluted from the initial thing that
04:24
you're taking
04:25
so the people who couldn't afford to
04:27
take the mushroom would buy the urine
04:29
off the people who just had a trip so
04:31
that they could then have that
04:32
soviet russia they used to if you had
04:34
chewing gum you would chew it until you
04:36
didn't have the taste anymore and then
04:37
you'd pass that on to someone else to
04:39
have the
04:39
remnants of it at least because it was
04:42
so rare
04:42
but if there was no taste left yeah but
04:44
i think i'm right in saying your mouth
04:46
kind of gets used to the taste so
04:47
there's still some left
04:48
it does and that's why there's always
04:50
room for pudding it's called sensory
04:52
specific satiety sss
04:53
and if you are really full of your main
04:55
course you think oh i can't eat any more
04:57
of this whatever it is you're having
04:59
risotto but then someone says
05:00
hey how about a profiterole your taste
05:03
buds perk up and you think
05:04
oh wait maybe i can squeeze in a bit
05:06
more food because it's a different
05:07
flavor it's a different flavor right
05:09
okay
05:09
um i've got a good year in fact turns
05:11
out that we
05:12
urinate fifty percent more than we drink
05:14
per day um
05:16
how could that be that's what i thought
05:17
is it because you're breathing in water
05:19
vapor no it's because all the foods that
05:20
get broken down there's lots of water
05:22
and foods
05:23
that's amazing yeah that is good hold on
05:26
thanks
05:26
you all thought it was gonna be dubious
05:29
i thought it was gonna be because
05:30
because we are half yetis
05:34
uh the first obscenity law in england uh
05:37
was in 1663 when
05:38
poet sir charles sedley got too drunk
05:41
shouted blasphemous things from a
05:43
balcony in covent garden
05:44
and urinated on the crowd below
05:48
and that was also the last law written
05:50
in norman french in the uk
05:52
was it yeah that's a nice coincidence we
05:55
should get a balcony
05:58
sigmund freud viewed urinating in public
06:00
as a sign of strong subconscious
06:01
ambition
06:03
oh did he yeah and if that's true
06:04
central london on a friday night is one
06:06
of the most ambitious places
06:07
in the world um i've got one more thing
06:10
about you yeah
06:10
so oh which do you want do you want the
06:12
one about rabbits or the one about the
06:13
future
06:14
oh the future the future um so as well
06:17
as these
06:18
um doctors who were genuinely trying to
06:20
work out how you could use urine to
06:21
diagnose
06:22
uh disease there were people who
06:23
practiced the art of euromancy
06:25
which is the art of telling the future
06:27
using urine and they were also known as
06:29
piss prophets a bit more vulgarly
06:31
um but they took omens from different
06:33
signs in it so some people took omens
06:35
from the color of the
06:37
uh client's urine or from its taste or
06:39
they read the bubbles
06:41
immediately after it hit the bowl so you
06:43
would have to uh to wee in a in the
06:45
divination bowl
06:46
and if there were large bubbles spread
06:48
out you were about to come into money
06:51
small bubbles packed together uh it
06:53
would be illness or someone you loved
06:54
would die
06:55
and oh no someone would die just because
06:58
i peed bubbles
06:59
small pack together bubbles yes so be
07:01
careful can you imagine
07:03
wow yeah and it was very common in the
07:05
17th century a lot of people
07:06
slagged them off ben johnson said that
07:09
they were turdy facey nasty paty lousy
07:11
farticle rogues
07:13
famously mature man so this um lady
07:17
dorothy harling
07:19
she was thought to have been someone who
07:21
was predicted in the book of revelations
07:23
there were a lot of these people called
07:24
french prophets who came over they were
07:26
hyggenos and they would um
07:27
they claimed that they were you know
07:29
profits from from the bible
07:31
um but i just really like prophets i
07:33
like you know people who think that
07:35
they're
07:36
they're gods or yeah but i love this guy
07:38
there was a guy called cooper i can't
07:40
remember his first name
07:41
and he was living in london he was
07:43
unemployed and some of his friends
07:45
and some of his indian friends told him
07:47
that he looked and moved just like an
07:48
ancient
07:49
indian goddess and he thought oh well
07:52
that sounds quite good anyway so he then
07:54
went
07:54
to gujarat and he claimed to be this
07:58
ancient goddess in human form
08:00
and now he lives in a holy saffron robe
08:03
living among 80 eunuchs why didn't he
08:06
say to his friends
08:07
okay great whatever let's have another
08:09
drink who takes their friends comments
08:11
on how they look that seriously yeah but
08:13
every time i saw my mum i believe i was
08:15
beautiful
08:18
oh you are beautiful
08:20
[Laughter]
08:25
okay time for fact number two and that
08:27
is you chozinski
08:29
so my fact is that despite the fact that
08:32
homosexuality is completely illegal
08:34
in the south sudan a woman can have a
08:36
female husband and a child can have a
08:38
female
08:39
father oh how does that work so it makes
08:42
sense because
08:43
it's uh it's true actually across parts
08:45
of east africa in various tribes but um
08:47
one of the tribes is the newer tribe
08:50
and if a woman is infertile it's a way
08:52
of her being able to continue her family
08:53
line so this infertile woman has a
08:55
father who wants to pass on property to
08:57
a son or a grandson right so the
08:59
infertile woman marries another woman
09:01
and then this other woman has a secret
09:03
lover whom she
09:04
has some sex with gets pregnant and then
09:06
she has a child by that
09:08
man but that child is officially the
09:09
child of the
09:11
infertile woman and the other woman wow
09:13
and then everything like legal
09:14
societal cultural rights everything like
09:17
that it's all the same as if they were a
09:19
normal
09:19
husband and wife marriage it's openly
09:21
accepted that that's what's done
09:23
and uh you know it's enshrined in law
09:25
and there's this other weird thing as
09:27
well which is
09:27
uh i think this is another tribe in
09:29
kenya it's the courier tribe which is
09:31
called daughter-in-law marriage
09:33
the courier tribe
09:43
yeah they deliver babies uh no the
09:45
courier k-u-r-i-a
09:47
tribe and they have this thing called
09:49
daughter-in-law marriage where an
09:50
infertile woman marries another woman
09:54
and then she gives as a wife the other
09:57
woman to her fictitious son
09:59
so this woman doesn't have any sons but
10:01
she marries a woman
10:03
and then donates that woman to her
10:05
made-up son
10:06
and so that woman now counts as her
10:08
daughter-in-law and then that woman gets
10:10
pregnant
10:11
and then that counts as her grandchild
10:13
it's a very confusing system
10:14
so it's like having it's having your
10:17
friend marry your imaginary friend
10:19
yes yes exactly because daughter having
10:22
a daughter-in-law is a sign of status
10:23
in uh certain african tribes and again
10:26
confers certain cultural
10:27
systems oh my gosh pretty great serious
10:30
problems if you can't have children
10:31
yourself or if but you want to keep a
10:33
family line going
10:34
yeah genius yeah there are there are
10:36
lots of um
10:37
women in albania who live as men aren't
10:40
there yeah is it a
10:41
canoe or something i think so yeah but
10:43
actually i say there are lots there are
10:44
very few now because it's a very old
10:46
customer and most of the remaining ones
10:48
are in the 70s 80s or even 90s so
10:50
but they they simply live as men so they
10:52
dress as men they live as men and do
10:54
they pretend that they are men or does
10:55
everyone know that they're women but
10:56
they just
10:57
know that they're a woman but they have
10:58
the status of a man yeah all you have to
11:00
do is dress as the man
11:01
and then people accept that you are yeah
11:04
and
11:04
that's just the way society works you
11:06
don't marry you're not allowed to marry
11:07
and you're known as a sworn virgin i
11:09
think
11:09
that's right yeah yeah but you are
11:11
officially a man even though you're
11:13
you're a celibate man you won't you
11:15
won't marry a woman but okay
11:17
there is a the canoe is in albania like
11:20
uh and he says it's a very old-fashioned
11:21
one but i think there's one other thing
11:23
if i'm right it's the same thing where
11:25
um if your wife is having sex with
11:28
another guy
11:29
you're allowed to kill them but you have
11:31
to kill them both at the same time
11:33
with one bullet and they have to be in
11:35
the act
11:36
at the time wow could you guys just line
11:39
up there please
11:41
still stand still that's a needlessly
11:44
complicated workaround
11:45
you could just say you're not allowed to
11:47
murder anyone yes yeah
11:48
it's a loophole isn't it it is a
11:50
loophole it almost sounds as if it
11:51
happened once and they went
11:53
oh no no it's legal do you read the
11:56
uh in france you can marry dead people
11:58
okay and
11:59
it's called posthumous marriage uh and
12:02
the idea
12:03
is that say i have a fiance and
12:06
she's going to like inherit half of what
12:09
i own
12:09
but then i die legally she'd have no
12:11
right to it so they do the marriage
12:13
after i've died and then she legally
12:15
is part of that family and owns half of
12:17
the orange all of this
12:18
stuff that makes sense these are all
12:20
ingenious solutions
12:22
to the natural problems of life and you
12:24
know how it gets in the way of
12:26
all the societal problems of life mainly
12:28
in the case of like gender
12:30
discrimination and
12:30
yeah it's quite funny the idea it's like
12:32
they really miss the point that women go
12:34
to you know the lawmakers and say
12:36
or the gay people in africa and say
12:38
we're really sick of this discrimination
12:39
they'll
12:39
make us go okay we'll let you pretend to
12:42
be a man does that solve the problem
12:44
it's like it's the suffragettes no not
12:46
really the suffragettes have gone down
12:47
that road
12:48
then we'd be living in 100 male britain
12:50
today yeah
12:52
all of you have the legal right to be
12:53
men uh you were talking about france
12:55
a french wedding custom in the oven
12:57
region
12:58
in um in certain villages it's called la
13:00
roti so they have the wedding and then
13:02
the married couple then go to their bed
13:04
chamber and then it's traditional for
13:05
the wedding guests to interrupt their
13:06
bed chamber in the middle of the night
13:08
overturn their bed chamber and then they
13:10
fill up a chamber pot with all the
13:11
leftover wine champagne food
13:13
sometimes toilet paper apparently tampon
13:16
soaked in tomato sauce
13:17
and they force the bride and groom to
13:20
drink the contents of this chamber pot
13:22
as a wedding ritual it's supposed to
13:24
signify the intimacy of their future
13:25
lives together or something
13:27
wow yeah romantic right what a great way
13:30
to ruin someone's wedding night
13:31
[Music]
13:32
i'm definitely going to start doing that
13:34
to my friends or they also fill it with
13:36
champagne and chocolate
13:37
sometimes which symbolizes urine and
13:39
feces yeah
13:40
i have a bit of a worry about champagne
13:43
representing urine because it has lots
13:44
of bubbles in it
13:45
and presumably everyone's just gonna die
13:47
they're small packed together bubbles as
13:49
well
13:49
yeah there's another wedding which and i
13:52
really want the verification of it
13:54
so if anyone belongs to the tidong tribe
13:56
in borneo who's listening to this
13:57
podcast or who knows of them
13:59
apparently if you get married in this
14:01
tribe you're not allowed to
14:03
urinate or defecate or wash for three
14:06
days after you get married
14:07
and it's just on this one person's blog
14:09
who went and hung out with zidong tribe
14:10
but i couldn't find reference to it
14:12
anywhere else
14:12
so three days you have to hold it in
14:14
that's amazing there's been a problem
14:15
with this anna because if the tea dong
14:17
tribe uh in borneo in the middle of the
14:19
jungle are listening
14:20
how they're going to tell you because
14:21
you're not on twitter that's a good
14:23
point i forgot that's the only way they
14:24
communicate
14:25
also holding it in for three days just
14:27
after a wedding
14:29
is tough yeah you drink a lot at a
14:31
wedding that's so true
14:33
and it's going to be the most unsavory
14:34
after those three days it's the least
14:36
romantic way again
14:38
to end them as you both fighting your
14:40
way to the toilet
14:41
for an explosive session anyway
14:44
um have you heard of bride pie this is
14:48
an english
14:48
wedding tradition so you have wedding
14:50
cake everyone knows about that
14:52
but traditionally in the 17th 18th
14:54
centuries around that time
14:56
you would also have bride pie and this
14:58
is a savory dish and it had lots of
15:00
little things in it like uh
15:02
cox combs you know those from a cockrell
15:04
or
15:05
lamb's testicles or goose giblets it
15:07
sounds like a very unsavory part
15:09
to me there was one recipe for a bride
15:12
pie in robert may's book the
15:13
accomplished cook which
15:14
included uh veal sweetbreads ox tongues
15:18
a pint of oysters bacon chestnuts lemon
15:20
juice
15:21
pickleberries wine a live snake for
15:23
entertainment purposes
15:26
more oysters and an onion i always find
15:28
my pies aren't
15:29
entertaining dear milton mowbray i was
15:32
most disappointed on getting to the end
15:34
of my pie
15:35
to find you had left out the live snake
15:38
please
15:38
can you rectify this situation
15:42
uh marriage is in sudan do you remember
15:44
that famous guy who married a goat
15:46
oh yeah yeah yeah he had to didn't he
15:48
yeah
15:49
he was caught in the lagrante galecto
15:53
and they said well in order to preserve
15:55
the honor
15:56
of the uh goat who was called rose he
15:59
had to
16:00
marry her and um rose unfortunately died
16:03
about a year later
16:04
after she swallowed a plastic bag how
16:06
convenient for the man
16:09
in india people sometimes marry trees
16:11
don't they do they
16:12
uh yeah why would you bury a tree it's
16:14
an astrological
16:15
thing so um in certain parts of india
16:18
you are manglic
16:19
if you're born on a certain day of the
16:21
month which means that astrologically
16:22
you have bad luck and
16:24
in marriage it means that you'll likely
16:25
be married to a lot of different
16:26
husbands either they'll die or you'll
16:28
get divorced and the way to counter
16:29
balance that
16:30
is in a ceremony which is called uh arc
16:33
viva
16:34
or kumviva where you marry a tree or an
16:37
urn and that's your first marriage and
16:39
so that means and you do the full
16:40
ceremony and that means you've done
16:41
marriage number one
16:42
now you can do marriage number two and i
16:44
think the former miss world
16:45
yes of 1990 was a tree in 1996 yeah
16:49
she did this in i think 2003 or 2004.
16:53
um because she was very superstitious
16:55
and she was born under this sign
16:57
and the idea is that after you get
16:58
married you then chop down the tree or
17:00
smash the urn
17:01
not to be recommended with genuine
17:03
husbands i feel bad for the tree though
17:05
yeah even the trees delight you're going
17:07
to marry a beautiful woman
17:10
it's the wedding night i'm so excited
17:14
excuse the guy with the eggs approaching
17:23
okay time for fact number three and that
17:25
is my fact my fact this week
17:27
it's a discovery that tommy flowers the
17:29
man who was responsible for the first
17:31
ever
17:32
i guess the first ever computer you
17:33
could call it colossus which was
17:35
designed during world war
17:36
ii it's that when they were pushing
17:38
forward the idea that the colossus
17:39
should be made
17:40
it kept blowing up because it was made
17:42
of 100 1 500 different valves kept
17:44
blowing up every time they turned it on
17:46
and they said this can't work and he was
17:48
convinced it could work he worked out
17:49
that by turning it on and off
17:51
that that's what was blowing it up so
17:52
the first ever bit of i.t advice was to
17:54
not turn it off
17:55
then turn it back on again that's
17:56
brilliant that's really funny
17:58
so this was tommy flowers tommy flowers
18:00
yeah tommy flowers used to work for the
18:01
post office
18:02
so he designed this thing he put it
18:04
forward they said no to it
18:06
after they said no to it um he solved
18:08
the problem and then they said no to it
18:10
again
18:10
because it just took up too much space
18:12
and it was going to take a year to make
18:14
so he just went ahead with it anyway as
18:15
a kind of half secret project
18:17
which is an amazing half secret project
18:19
to have because it was the size of a
18:21
room
18:23
in bletchley i don't know how you hide
18:25
that i don't know yeah and bletchley
18:26
among people whose job it is to find out
18:28
any secrets you might be like
18:30
it's literally the worst place in the
18:31
world to try and keep a secret that's
18:33
such a good voice it's so funny
18:34
yeah well we found the oldest computer
18:36
ever was always cited as the oldest
18:38
computer ever
18:39
was only discovered in i think it was
18:41
1902
18:42
i want to say anyway earlier the early
18:44
20th century was that ancient greek
18:46
computer from the second century bc
18:49
which is called the antikythera yeah
18:52
is that definitely a computer do we
18:53
think uh everyone always refers to it as
18:56
a computer so it's an unbelievably
18:57
complex system of
18:58
cogs which if you spin a handle on it
19:01
which correctly show you the rotation of
19:03
all the planets that have been
19:04
discovered at the time which was
19:05
five planets i think and could predict a
19:07
lunar eclipse and a solar eclipse
19:09
and they have and they didn't make
19:11
anything nearly as complicated as that
19:12
for another 1500 years
19:14
the most if if anyone listening to this
19:16
is thinking oh i'll look into that later
19:18
google it right now while you remember
19:19
it or maybe
19:20
just press pause and check it out
19:22
because it's the most extraordinary
19:24
looking item
19:25
and it's so out of place in time that's
19:27
the thing you look at it and it's
19:28
like all those books that used to come
19:30
out back in the 70s by eric von daniken
19:32
and stuff saying oh there were ancient
19:34
batteries and stuff and you and you look
19:35
at it and go no of course not this is
19:37
this is completely falsified this is the
19:38
real deal this is a thing that just is
19:40
so complicated
19:42
it's insane i'm calling it i think
19:43
that's a computer the word computer used
19:45
to refer to someone who just worked out
19:47
when easter was
19:49
really yeah they would have a monk whose
19:51
job it was to work out all the dates and
19:53
all their feasts and stuff like that
19:54
obviously
19:55
easter being the main one and they were
19:57
called computers if you
19:58
if you tried turning him off and then
19:59
turning it back on again
20:01
um i read that the colossus was actually
20:04
dismantled a bunch of them were
20:05
dismantled
20:06
i think eight of the ten and all of the
20:08
parts that made it up
20:10
went into the spares of uh post office
20:13
systems again really so a large part and
20:15
apparently those are still being used
20:16
today so a large part of the postal
20:18
service
20:19
is still used being used using parts
20:21
from colossus the very first computer
20:23
and that explains a lot
20:24
[Laughter]
20:26
a couple of years ago at a qo recording
20:27
we had some charity guests and one of
20:29
the people i met there
20:31
was he ran the com he ran the computers
20:34
which controlled a lot of trains all
20:35
over the uk and he said they run on
20:37
every system that you can imagine
20:39
there are still trains running on ms-dos
20:42
in britain today and there are ones
20:44
which run on apples and
20:45
when they first built the computing
20:46
systems a lot of the levers for the
20:48
points changing and things like that
20:49
they used parts from old raf planes and
20:52
levers and things like that
20:54
amazingly cool hodgepodge way of doing
20:56
it the problem with that is of course
20:57
that when you have
20:58
things going wrong you don't have the
21:00
parts to replace them because they're
21:01
such antiquated
21:02
systems and also if you had someone who
21:05
had to
21:05
fix a computer system and it's written
21:07
in some old code that no one does
21:09
anymore then
21:10
you're completely screwed ms-dos is
21:11
going to come back james is it
21:13
c colon yes
21:17
do you know who wrote the do you
21:18
remember the opening music for microsoft
21:20
when
21:21
your computer would turn on that music
21:22
that it would make
21:24
that one it was exactly that yeah do you
21:26
know who wrote that was it
21:28
yeah no there wasn't that one actually
21:30
oh all right i couldn't tell which one
21:31
that one was that james was doing
21:33
he wrote brian i wrote the one that went
21:36
um
21:40
sounds like him he got given a list of
21:42
about 100 words
21:44
descriptive words saying it needs to be
21:46
sexy informative
21:48
exciting ambitious all these words and
21:50
it needs to be in
21:51
um 0.75 seconds or something like that
21:54
or
21:54
3.4 seconds um and uh and so the great
21:58
secret of it is that he wrote it on a
21:59
mac
22:00
oh really yeah really um the first
22:03
laptop
22:04
was um sold in 1982. uh they were
22:07
selling them dota doll
22:08
and they were priced around 20 dollars
22:11
in today's
22:12
money so pretty expensive things they
22:13
were pretty big about eleven pounds
22:15
um but the main problem the reason
22:17
people don't wanna buy them is because
22:18
they had a keyboard on them
22:20
and um like big executives who worked in
22:23
offices thought that typing stuff was
22:25
something that would be done by
22:26
secretaries not by themselves
22:28
and so they really resisted having
22:29
anything that had a keyboard on it
22:31
that's really funny status indicator
22:33
yeah that's incredible computers have
22:35
changed quite a lot i was reading in the
22:36
news just this week
22:38
they have a supercomputer that read a
22:40
hundred thousand
22:41
um scientific papers in two hours and
22:44
cross-referenced
22:45
all of them against each other and found
22:47
completely new types of biology
22:50
whoa i know really it's quite
22:52
complicated to
22:53
explain what it was but it was something
22:55
like they they were looking for a
22:56
specific compound and they
22:58
looked for mentions of it in all these
23:00
hundred thousand papers and
23:01
cross-referenced them against each other
23:03
and they found new types of these
23:06
compounds that they didn't know existed
23:07
before or something like that anyway
23:09
that's absolutely unbelievable i know i
23:11
can't really work out what it means i
23:12
have no it's i'll post it on my on my
23:14
twitter feed if people want to read that
23:16
but it's it's
23:17
absolutely amazing so i was looking into
23:18
code breaking during world war ii the
23:20
guy who invented
23:21
who came up with enigma arthur sherbius
23:23
didn't know what he'd come up with he
23:25
died in 1929
23:26
in a carriage accident i think um before
23:29
he knew that it was being put to that
23:30
kind of use
23:31
but he also invented the electric pillow
23:34
sorry what's an electric pillow
23:36
i assume so he patented a way of
23:38
transmitting heat through various
23:39
objects and so i think it's like an
23:41
electric blanket
23:41
oh just to keep your head really hot i
23:43
don't know why you've brought that up
23:44
because that's the one
23:45
problem isn't it the pillows get too hot
23:47
yeah
23:48
you turn the pillow over and the other
23:50
side's even hotter
23:58
okay time for our final fact of the show
24:00
and that is andy murray
24:02
hello my fact is that a couple of
24:05
botanists from kew gardens
24:06
recently checked a one pound 29
24:10
bag of porcini mushrooms from the
24:12
supermarket
24:13
and they found three species which were
24:15
previously unknown to science
24:17
that's really cool they thought they'd
24:19
run it through a dna
24:21
sequencer as you do yeah they do that
24:23
before they eat all of their meals
24:25
it's a bit like horse meat and lasagna
24:26
kind of thing is it like they thought
24:28
they were porcini but i know it's like
24:30
unicorn lasagna yes
24:32
yeah so does that mean they're just
24:35
we're missing them all because they just
24:37
happen to be botanists we've all
24:38
probably eaten
24:39
mushrooms that are completely unknown to
24:41
science um
24:42
so they got to name them which is cool
24:44
you don't often get the name three new
24:45
species
24:45
what did they call them um they called
24:47
them latin names
24:49
which translate as white beef liver
24:52
delicious
24:52
cattle liver fungus and the third one
24:55
just means edible
24:57
ran out of ideas one of the um people
25:00
who has a lot of animals named after
25:02
them who's live there's an explorer in
25:03
venezuela
25:04
called charles brewer carius and he
25:07
has a lot of animals attributed to him
25:10
um
25:10
partially because in venezuela there's
25:12
so many undiscovered species
25:14
that any time he goes to a new um one of
25:17
the table top mountains
25:19
um he just discovers tons of new species
25:22
it's so diverse up there as well they
25:24
say that if you're on top of these
25:25
tabletop mountains
25:26
if you have two bodies of water
25:28
literally meters apart from each other
25:30
the fish inside this one will be a
25:31
complete different species of the fish
25:33
inside of the one sitting beside it
25:34
that's how varied and
25:36
so are you talking about the andes did
25:38
you say because i the orchids that are
25:40
in the
25:40
andes the ecuadorian andes they have
25:42
more uh orchids than anywhere else on
25:44
the planet that are
25:45
uh endemic only found there a one
25:47
botanist called lou jost found four new
25:49
species of orchid in a single day
25:51
all hidden in the same patch of moss wow
25:54
isn't that amazing there was a new
25:55
species of chameleon found in tanzania
25:57
uh and it was found after a snake spat
26:00
out a still undigested specimen in the
26:02
feet of a british scientist
26:05
there's a snake there he's like oh no
26:07
there's a snake and then it sort of
26:08
vomits up
26:09
a chameleon and goes oh that's a new one
26:11
i haven't seen that before incredible
26:12
that's like there's that happens all the
26:14
time it seems to these sort of uh the
26:15
zoologists and stuff there was the guy
26:17
who discovered a new species of monkey
26:19
that fell into his notebook
26:20
i know it wasn't monkey it was a new
26:21
species of frog dark frog it fell into
26:23
his notebook right as he was did he
26:25
press it like a flower
26:28
leave it for three days and then show it
26:30
to my teacher
26:32
uh my favorite species discovery is a
26:35
really exciting discovery in 2010
26:37
of a species called the australopithecus
26:40
cediba
26:40
which is a type of hominid a new type of
26:42
hominid they found and basically this
26:44
guy
26:45
lee burger is a paleoanthropologist and
26:47
he was in south africa
26:48
on a paleontological dick looking for
26:51
fossils a new species
26:53
so while he was doing this his
26:55
nine-year-old son
26:56
nearby matthew was playing with the dog
26:58
and tripped over
26:59
a clavicle and jawbone which turned out
27:01
belonged to a new species of hominid
27:03
and brought it back to his dad he was
27:05
obviously like shut up son i'm not i'm
27:07
busy now
27:08
go away come back later turn out he
27:10
discovered a new human basically
27:11
incredible um okay so this is i really
27:14
like this we don't know for sure
27:16
how many species of gerbil there are oh
27:19
that's great we know of 95
27:21
um but i think no one's properly looked
27:23
into it like with so many species
27:25
animals we have no idea how many there
27:26
are
27:26
among the 95 known species of gerbil are
27:28
wagner's gerbil
27:30
as well as cheesemans the south african
27:32
hairy-footed
27:33
swarthy's pleasant burtons julian's
27:36
vivacious and riggenbach's
27:40
pleasure i like pleasant gerbil i don't
27:42
believe such a thing exists
27:44
i think i feel about gerbils like you
27:46
feel about mushrooms oh yeah um yeah
27:48
one won them on a pizza uh not too many
27:51
of them no
27:51
they have an indefinable aura of death
27:53
around them is that a fact
27:55
no i mean that's what james thinks about
27:56
mushrooms oh right okay got it on the
27:58
subject of gerbils finding stuff in food
28:00
uh there was a guy in kittlington which
28:02
is quite near where i'm from in
28:03
oxfordshire recently
28:04
who bought online from tesco's a pack of
28:07
hovis sliced bread
28:08
and there's just the best picture of it
28:10
so he found a whole mouse
28:11
inside the bread and it was a sort of it
28:14
looks like something
28:15
fossilized but it's this complete mouse
28:17
and it took about four slices of bread
28:19
but without a tail and he'd already
28:20
eaten some
28:21
so was the genuine i found half a maggot
28:24
in my food
28:25
premier foods who made the bread
28:27
admitted it had failed to ensure all
28:29
stages of food production were protected
28:31
against contamination
28:33
wow um the food standards authority
28:35
allows
28:36
up to 20 maggots per 100 grams of
28:38
mushrooms before it's a problem
28:39
um and 75 mites before that again 20
28:43
20 maggots per 100 grams of mushrooms is
28:45
okay it is quite a lot isn't it for
28:47
underground
28:47
very much i suppose mushrooms dried
28:49
mushrooms are very light
28:50
so 100 grams is quite a lot uh it's not
28:53
dried it's drained
28:54
oh okay so just normal mushrooms there's
28:56
a species of mushroom um named recently
28:58
called
28:59
phallus drewzii and that was named after
29:02
a guy called bob drews
29:04
and obviously phallus because it's
29:06
shaped like a penis
29:08
and so this basically is named bob
29:09
drew's penis
29:12
wow that's the name of the thing why
29:14
does someone really not like bob drew's
29:15
no that it was in his honor they were
29:17
friends of his uh and he said
29:19
in an interview with the newspaper he
29:21
said i am utterly delighted the funny
29:23
thing is
29:24
that it is
29:27
this is gonna go wrong no he said i'm
29:30
absolutely delighted the funny thing is
29:31
that it is the second smartest stone
29:36
i can't do this do you need someone else
29:39
to read it out for you
29:40
i might do it sorry i have to read this
29:42
because i keep laughing bob drew
29:44
said i am utterly delighted the funny
29:46
thing is that it's the second smallest
29:48
known mushroom in this genus
29:51
and it grows sideways almost limp
29:56
okay there you go that's amazing yeah
30:00
but he was delighted that it was named
30:01
after him
30:02
it also emits a foul loader and attracts
30:09
well i understand why i'm so pleased the
30:12
mushroom on the other hand
30:13
[Laughter]
30:17
isn't there a rose named after june
30:19
whitfield oh yeah in the catalog
30:21
description it says it's good in a bed
30:23
but best up against a wall
30:27

hello and welcome to another episode of
00:22
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:24
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:26
covent garden my name is dan schreiber
00:28
i'm sitting here with anna chazinski
00:29
james harkin and i'm fact checking
00:31
judy's andy murray and joining us as
00:34
well is a very special guest it's ash
00:36
gardner the lead singer of emperor yes
00:38
the band whose song we use is our theme
00:40
tune and they've just got a new album
00:41
out it's called an island called earth
00:44
and throughout the show during the
00:45
interstitial moments instead of our
00:46
regular stings we're going to be using
00:48
extracts from songs from that album that
00:51
you should definitely buy also at the
00:53
end of the show we're going to play a
00:54
full track single from the album called
00:56
monkey king hello ash hey what's up guys
00:59
i'm ash good evening all right let's
01:01
begin with fact number one and we're
01:03
gonna start with you ash
01:05
cool so my fact that i have today is
01:07
that in 1060 bce the egyptian city of
01:11
pyramids was moved 20 kilometers to the
01:15
north including obelisks sphinxes
01:19
temples
01:20
so stilai
01:22
why did they move it
01:24
well their tributary of the nile that
01:27
they were on
01:28
dried up as the nile is carrying so much
01:30
sediment it's constantly it's constantly
01:33
filling itself up and they're in the
01:34
nile delta so yeah they're they're a bit
01:37
of the river move their fresh water left
01:38
them so they they chased it yup did they
01:41
wait i mean because you know you don't
01:43
wake up one night and go oh my god
01:44
there's 20 kilometers of silt where
01:46
there was a river so they must have
01:47
waited and just gone to and from the
01:48
nile until gradually it was just that
01:51
bit too far and then one day yeah i
01:53
thought it's gone just a centimeter too
01:55
far for me now so let's go 20 kilometers
01:57
up that direction yeah carrying all this
02:00
there is a river that changes
02:02
direction in in the year i think it's a
02:04
ton lay sap is it in cambodia and it
02:06
goes towards the lake for half the year
02:09
and then it changes direction and goes
02:10
away from the lake for the rest of the
02:11
year and that's because the mekong river
02:13
has so much uh water flowing down it
02:16
that when it reaches the sea it can't
02:18
get the water into the sea quick enough
02:20
so it backs up and fills up a lake i
02:22
think in the wet season that lake is 10
02:25
of the size of cambodia so the nile was
02:27
really important of course for the
02:28
egyptians um
02:30
so much so that the new year began at
02:33
the flooding so whenever the flooding
02:34
was that was when the new year was uh
02:36
their maps were orientated so that the
02:39
source of the nile was at the top so the
02:41
north
02:42
was in the south and the south was in
02:43
the north as we would imagine which of
02:45
course upper egypt
02:47
is
02:48
is the southern bit yeah
02:51
yeah that's upper egypt is is the bit
02:53
that heads towards sudan and ethiopia
02:55
yeah and so important was it that it
02:57
flooded every year that uh egyptian
02:59
pharaohs would ritually masturbate into
03:01
the nile to ensure an abundance of water
03:06
well i believe so what was the belief
03:08
behind it was giving birth to more water
03:10
is it just literally to provide more
03:12
liquid they think that tiny deposit is
03:15
gonna tip it over the edge well who
03:17
knows how big the deposit was in those
03:18
days
03:19
but yeah no it was um like because it
03:22
was a bringer of life etcetera and
03:24
wow did they do that to other stuff
03:28
apparently cleopatra had the first uh
03:30
vibrator and apparently it was a wooden
03:32
box with a b on the inside of it what
03:34
the b was good
03:36
that was no vibrating element i believe
03:38
the vibrator was the fourth um
03:40
electronic um thing to be powered by
03:42
electricity when electricity was first
03:44
invented yeah i can't remember what the
03:46
other three were weirdly that's the only
03:48
one i remember
03:49
um so the guy who moved the town it was
03:52
ramsey's the second too ramsay's the
03:54
second was the one who built it was the
03:55
one who built it who's also the guy
03:57
whose body
03:59
we transported to paris in 1974 didn't
04:02
we and he's the only dead person who's
04:03
ever had a passport i think oh really
04:06
really on his passport his occupation
04:08
was listed as king bracket's deceased
04:10
wow the only other thing i know about
04:11
the city that was moved is so that i
04:13
think uh we thought for ages that it was
04:16
in a location which is now tanis didn't
04:17
we yeah and then they realized that um
04:20
all the objects that they could date
04:22
back to pi ramses were actually located
04:25
in
04:27
yeah but tannis is where they've they
04:29
set like raiders of the lost ark isn't
04:30
it yeah yeah yeah that's where the ark
04:33
of the covenant was supposed to be taken
04:35
to in indiana jones yeah now we're
04:37
getting into dan
04:40
territory apparently they were saying
04:42
that tanis would be up there amongst the
04:44
most famous of discoveries next to
04:46
tutankhamun had it been found in a
04:47
different period of time but it was
04:49
found just as world war ii broke out i
04:51
think so as a result no one really uh
04:54
talks about it but it was they found so
04:55
much there they found everything from
04:57
their pottery to their as you say
04:59
temples and
05:00
huge structures right how how big was
05:02
the biggest one really big 200 tons yeah
05:04
was the biggest obelisk that they moved
05:06
yeah so how long how much are we talking
05:08
here in terms of stuff so
05:10
multiple sphinxes
05:12
uh all of the temples and buildings they
05:14
took apart brick by brick and moved
05:16
those
05:17
but the uh the obelisks and stuff were
05:19
moved whole sphinxes yeah they had more
05:22
than one sphinx
05:23
did they yeah
05:25
the thing about the sphinx is is it
05:26
right that it was understand for like
05:29
hundreds and hundreds of years and then
05:31
they just kind of found the top of its
05:32
head and then they dug down and yeah
05:34
that is pretty right that was like
05:35
around napoleon in his lot when they
05:37
turned up they've got photographs from
05:39
around that time period where just the
05:40
head of the sphinx is sticking out
05:42
that's so cool wow so have we actually
05:44
dug to the bottom is he like on a
05:45
tricycle maybe
05:48
yeah you can see his feet but we can't
05:49
see the bottom of the block
05:50
yeah
05:51
what could he be on or she is she
05:53
um so they think that the sphinx is the
05:56
face of khufu which is the person who
05:58
the great pyramid was built for so maybe
06:00
the sphinx is a guy yeah oh i thought
06:03
the sphinx was a woman and that when
06:04
she's riddling then she's female
06:06
i'm pretty sure is it true that napoleon
06:08
actually shot off the nose or not
06:10
question
06:11
no we don't think so really yeah we
06:13
think there's photos of it without a
06:15
nose before napoleon came along right it
06:18
also had sketches and stuff from before
06:20
napoleon yeah probably not photos photos
06:24
it also had one of those um
06:26
those things that come after the braided
06:28
beard the braided beard which is in the
06:29
british museum there are cases
06:31
throughout history of us moving just
06:33
great structures aren't there like a
06:34
move tower bridge that's what it
06:35
reminded me of is when we took apart
06:37
tower
06:38
sorry london bridge that's the myth that
06:40
it was tower bridge uh we sold london
06:42
bridge to the americans didn't we and it
06:43
was the guy who sold it numbered every
06:46
brick so it was taken apart bit by bit
06:48
and then could be put back together
06:49
exactly the same oh wow i once read that
06:51
the windows of lincoln cathedral the
06:54
stained glass windows they took them
06:56
apart piece by piece and then labelled
06:58
them all and then put them back wanted
06:59
to put them back as a jigsaw this was
07:01
during the war because they didn't want
07:02
them to get smashed uh and then uh
07:04
someone lost the picture of what it was
07:07
so they had to do it painstakingly and
07:09
just work out where everything was and i
07:11
emailed them and it's not true
07:13
yeah
07:16
a bit off topic but the way that uh
07:18
talking heads recorded remain in light
07:20
is that every percussive instrument
07:22
would play constantly throughout every
07:25
song and then when they came to mix the
07:27
album they muted they automated the
07:29
mutes for on off for the different
07:32
percussive sections so they're like oh
07:33
we want a cowbell here
07:35
that is hey there's a cowbell insane so
07:37
when they went back to re-mix it or
07:39
remaster it about ten years ago and they
07:41
listened to it they went
07:43
oh wow oh
07:45
it sounds like they played it before
07:47
they'd written it like they just got
07:48
everyone to play everything yeah and
07:50
then we didn't have time to write
07:52
anything guys yeah play we'll write the
07:53
song through them write it later yeah
07:57
so uh ramses had he apparently had over
08:00
200 different wives and with these 200
08:03
different wives he had uh
08:05
69 sons
08:07
and over 60 daughters he's done quite
08:11
well to get so many kids considering he
08:13
was masturbating into the nile every
08:15
single day
08:16
maybe they were swimming
08:19
one tiny thing which i really like
08:21
because speaking of uh moving moving
08:23
buildings is that ataturk was a big fan
08:26
of nature and he had his uh yelova
08:29
mansion he was told by the people who
08:31
built his yolova mansion that there was
08:34
a tree in the way of it and they were
08:35
going to have to cut down this tree it
08:36
was a plane tree and instead of letting
08:38
them cut it down he made them move the
08:40
entire mansion four meters to the left
08:42
wow yeah dedication
08:45
bit annoying for the construction
08:46
workers also the uh the biggest the
08:49
biggest stone to ever be moved this is
08:51
this is a bit random but it was moved in
08:53
russia and it was moved up not that long
08:55
ago like 200 years ago yeah they just
08:57
decided to tug a massive stone it's
09:00
bigger than any stone humans have moved
09:03
ever any of the egyptian yeah anything
09:06
why did they do that
09:07
just for a smash right a strong man
09:09
contest yeah it was poutine wasn't it
09:11
just
09:12
grabbing it and pushing his shirt off
09:14
no there was a bigger stone actually um
09:17
and this was the romans they cut it uh
09:20
but they couldn't move it um so they cut
09:23
it out it was this massive rock they
09:24
were going to move it to a city as a big
09:26
temple thing but it was just so big they
09:28
couldn't move it and it's still there
09:29
where they cut it
09:30
you couldn't be good at everything
09:31
romans
09:34
uh okay andy uh anything to add uh yes
09:36
there's uh so you're all doing very well
09:39
um
09:40
interesting thing about the sphinx the
09:42
greek sphinx was a woman but the
09:43
egyptian sphinx was typically shown as a
09:45
man which is called an andro sphinx
09:50
on on rivers changing directions
09:51
actually the amazon once flowed in the
09:53
opposite direction
09:54
it used to flow from the atlantic ocean
09:56
to the pacific wow yeah until at least
09:59
65 million years ago which is cool the
10:02
okay so
10:03
stuff i have found a source which claims
10:05
that the vibrator was the fifth
10:06
household appliance to be electrified
10:09
and the fourth one was the clothes iron
10:11
uh but the first mechanical vibrator was
10:12
actually steam powered and was called
10:14
the manipulator um
10:16
and on the yeah
10:18
you couldn't silently get away with that
10:20
one could you
10:22
i'm just i'm just going to go to my room
10:23
again early night why are you going down
10:25
to the coal shed again it was it was it
10:27
was massive it had to be kept in a
10:28
separate room the vibrator room they
10:31
come up in jane austen novels i think it
10:33
sort of pokes through into the next room
10:34
basically
10:36
it's pretty
10:36
good the beginnings of the glory hole um
10:38
wow yeah
10:41
uh okay we should move on uh let's have
10:43
a quick burst of a emperor yes song
10:46
[Music]
10:53
[Applause]
10:55
okay that was
10:57
to tanis that little extract you heard
10:58
just there from ash's album uh that was
11:01
exactly the subject that we were just
11:02
talking about for his fact okay time for
11:05
fact number two jaczynski my fact is
11:07
that in 1864 one of charles dickens
11:10
friends had a flat pack swiss chalet
11:12
delivered to his home as a christmas
11:14
present
11:15
and that wouldn't have fit in the
11:16
stocking no it didn't so uh it was
11:19
charles dickens actor friend and he had
11:21
it delivered to hayam station near char
11:23
near dickens's house it arrived in 58
11:25
boxes and were split into 94 pieces
11:28
and uh yeah dickens had to go pick it up
11:31
loaded onto the carriage multiple trips
11:33
i imagine and erected at home was it was
11:36
it wrapped was it like every was it
11:38
disappointing every time he opened one
11:39
of his what is this what the hell is
11:41
this i wonder if it came with
11:42
instructions well because they came with
11:44
someone who knew what they were doing
11:46
probably in those times instructions was
11:48
probably a human oh if only mcconnell
11:50
did that now
11:51
yeah every box came with just a human
11:53
being but you can buy a flat pack ikea
11:56
house now right and you assemble it it
11:58
has instructions i mean i think they
11:59
come and assemble it for you i'm
12:01
guessing i don't think it's like one
12:02
allen key and someone
12:04
online are all from germany and they
12:06
have guys that come and install them for
12:07
you yeah so i think that's quite a risky
12:09
present to get somebody it's if they
12:11
don't like it how do you return that
12:13
yeah
12:14
gift vouchers is definitely safer isn't
12:16
it yeah swish on a gift vouchers get
12:18
that um but fortunately he absolutely
12:20
loved it and he built it in a road ran
12:22
through dickens property and he built it
12:25
on one side of the road and his home was
12:26
on the other so then he had to build a
12:28
tunnel that ran from his house to the
12:31
swiss chalet because he didn't like
12:32
having to cross the road because you
12:33
know he liked his privacy so he erected
12:35
this entire tunnel which still survives
12:37
uh where he used to escape his writing
12:39
chalet
12:40
that's where he wrote so it's more like
12:42
a shed really isn't it would you say
12:43
stories can be two stories no uh he
12:46
seemed like a really fun guy as well he
12:48
uh he basically had a secret
12:51
writing room a secret area in his house
12:53
that was hidden behind a bookshelf which
12:55
was a fake bookshelf and so he had fake
12:57
books on the bookshelf and he actually
12:59
he came up with names
13:02
yeah so some of the titles include
13:04
noah's architecture was shakespeare's
13:06
mother fat
13:07
and he had a nine volume set titled cats
13:10
lives yeah yeah i don't know if it's
13:12
true but that's it it's true it's it
13:14
still exists where is the house and the
13:16
tunnel it was in kent the garden of
13:18
england there is um a village in i think
13:21
it's in kent where they have a load of
13:23
charles dickens memorabilia and stuff
13:25
and he never lived there it's just a
13:27
place he used to go on holiday sometimes
13:30
and there was a counsellor who was so
13:31
annoyed that everyone was like calling
13:33
the shop like charles dickens shop or
13:35
charles dickens pub he had a plaque put
13:38
on his house saying charles dickens did
13:40
not stay here really yeah apparently i
13:43
think i think this is the same town that
13:45
very recently there was a school here
13:47
which was the charles dickens primary
13:48
school or just charles dickens school
13:50
and they've taken charles off the name
13:51
now and put another title on i can't
13:53
remember what it's called but the town
13:55
is furious about it oh really yeah so
13:57
they've taken charles off but they've
13:59
kept dickens yeah so it's the something
14:01
dickens school maybe frederick dickens
14:02
his brother he was an alcoholic who um
14:05
used to borrow money on his brother's
14:07
name just to get alcohol and then died
14:10
in a he died of alcoholism or something
14:12
and dickens supported his family for the
14:13
rest of his life didn't he did he yeah
14:16
good guy he uh he's it's very funny i
14:19
was uh looking into his great grandson
14:21
who performs a lot of his books now as
14:23
live one-man plays or maybe maybe
14:25
there's a cast but his name is gerald
14:27
charles dickens oh yeah and what's very
14:29
funny is if you look into all the great
14:31
great great grandsons of all the dickens
14:33
um they've all somehow decided to keep
14:35
charles in there just to really drill at
14:37
home there's a middle name in there of
14:39
charles in virtually every single
14:41
charles dickens his sons have weird
14:42
names like alfred tennyson or he used to
14:45
give them really weird names because he
14:46
was kind of fun so he nicknamed his kids
14:48
so his daughter was called lucifer box
14:50
because she had a stormy temper he
14:51
called one of his sons chicken stalker
14:53
all his life and one of his sons was
14:54
called plawn wasn't there skittles as
14:56
well skittles yeah i think i didn't know
14:58
those skittles around back then
15:00
there was no way to taste the rainbow
15:02
the best dickens story i think is when
15:04
hans christian anderson came to stay
15:05
with him and he was supposed to stay two
15:07
weeks and he stayed five and the dickens
15:10
family hated him i found a complete boar
15:12
and dickens had as soon as chris hansen
15:14
anderson left he left in the guest room
15:16
a note on the mantelpiece that just said
15:18
hans anderson stayed in this room for
15:20
five weeks which seemed to the family
15:22
ages
15:24
that was erected in the guest room oh my
15:26
god
15:27
anderson never knew anderson used to
15:29
write articles saying how what a great
15:30
time he'd had with dickens and how close
15:32
they are and dickens just shunned him
15:33
from then on
15:35
some stuff about gifts seeing as we
15:38
talked about that before during world
15:40
war ii um obviously there wasn't much
15:42
stuff around and so women's weekly
15:45
magazine pointed out that anything is
15:47
worth giving as a gift and they said a
15:49
box of matches now makes a very
15:51
welcoming gift
15:53
and you can make it more important
15:54
looking by dressing the box up by
15:57
sticking a scrap of pretty wallpaper or
15:59
decorative christmas paper on the front
16:01
and back of it
16:03
that's nice though isn't it this is good
16:05
yeah well gifts i've been reading lately
16:07
about uh economists estimate that when
16:09
you give someone a gift there's on
16:11
average a 10 to 30 percent financial
16:14
loss that you're making because
16:15
obviously when you give if you give
16:17
someone a gift if i give you a gift
16:18
james then you give me a gift and that
16:20
was something i decided was too
16:21
expensive to buy with my own money this
16:23
isn't going to cut it at christmas when
16:25
you go to your family and go and they
16:27
say where's our gift and you go
16:28
economists estimate that this is
16:31
yeah
16:31
so i don't think they're taking into
16:33
account the emotional effect of the gift
16:34
but certainly from a value perspective
16:37
gifts aren't worth it guys in japan they
16:38
have an amazing gift-giving culture
16:40
where if somebody gives you a gift you
16:43
need to give them back a gift of half of
16:45
the uh half of the value of the original
16:48
gift and then the original gift giver
16:50
gives a card and that finishes the gift
16:53
cycle
16:54
[Laughter]
16:58
yeah so you kind of have to have like a
17:01
five pound book token on you at all
17:03
times in case someone gives you a ten
17:04
pound one which is why all the candies
17:07
and all of the stuff in japan it all
17:08
comes individually wrapped so you can
17:10
buy a big box and give one to everybody
17:12
in your office right and they have to
17:14
give you ha ha
17:16
and then you gotta get them all cards ah
17:17
that's terrible absolute hell also you
17:19
have to ask the really rude question
17:21
when someone gives you a gift of so how
17:22
much was this i reckon they just i
17:24
reckon they deduce that that's all
17:26
within this yeah you have to guess
17:28
majesty what do you get when someone
17:30
gives you a flat packs with chalet yeah
17:33
do you remember when barrack obama came
17:35
to visit gordon brown and gordon brown
17:38
gave barack obama a pen holder carved
17:40
from the timbers of the sister ship from
17:42
which the white house desk is made and
17:44
the first edition of a seven volume
17:46
biography of winston churchill and
17:48
barack obama gave gordon brown a 25 dvd
17:52
box set that didn't work on british dvd
17:56
what was it
17:57
it was just of the 25 top films of all
17:59
time and like that list he'd just gone
18:01
through the top 25. it's like a mixtape
18:03
yeah
18:04
um when donald rumsfeld went to um iraq
18:08
he gave saddam hussein
18:10
some medieval spiked hammers
18:12
and salim hussein gave him back a video
18:15
um documenting syrian atrocities
18:18
oh wow
18:19
it was people stabbing puppies wasn't it
18:21
yeah
18:22
there's an amazing thing online so if an
18:24
american president is given a gift
18:26
if the gift is under
18:28
350 dollars american the president gets
18:31
to keep the gift if it's over that it
18:33
belongs to the people um and recently
18:35
they did a list of all the countries
18:37
that given him presents and the worst
18:38
one they decided was from poland
18:41
uh who gave obama when he visited in
18:43
2012. they gave him a computer game
18:46
called witcher 2
18:48
a dvd called best of witcher 2
18:51
a witcher 2 gift box set
18:53
three golden witcher 2 coins a witcher 2
18:57
book which are two stickers and an ivory
18:59
coloured witcher 2 bust of one of the
19:01
characters wow that was his that was his
19:03
present
19:04
uh andy anything to add before we move
19:06
on gordon brown's presence to barack
19:07
obama cost 10 000 pounds and the dvds in
19:10
return were just yes the 25 best films
19:12
of all time as judged by one online firm
19:15
the following time that gordon brown had
19:17
to give barack obama gifts he gave him
19:20
two books
19:21
a carnegie anthology about the scottish
19:23
american industrialist andrew carnegie
19:25
and scottish estate tweets so he kind of
19:28
learned his lesson about giving the
19:29
president really good presence yeah
19:31
okay uh we should move on guys uh here's
19:34
another mps song
19:35
[Music]
19:37
[Applause]
19:39
[Music]
19:50
okay that song was called cosmos and uh
19:52
it's now time for fact number three
19:55
james my fact is that neuroscientists
19:58
could tell if you are a musician simply
20:00
by looking at your brain wow so this
20:03
comes from a book called musicalphilia
20:06
by oliver sacks
20:07
it's a great book all about music and
20:09
the brain and he's basically saying that
20:12
yeah the the brain just develops
20:14
differently from people who spend their
20:15
whole life playing music i think it was
20:17
oliver sacks that said that he reckons
20:20
everybody has perfect pitch as a baby
20:22
but you learn to disregard it and it's
20:25
only the practice of music which keeps
20:28
that up so he argues for the fact that
20:30
you cannot learn perfect pitch as an
20:32
adult also as a baby when you're two you
20:34
have more brain cells than you'll ever
20:36
have again don't you yeah they could
20:37
they say take advantage of it and you
20:39
can you can remove a large portion of
20:41
the baby's brain yeah half and it can
20:43
still function as a full breath of
20:44
anyone's brain what well not in adults
20:47
no no you can move half of anyone's
20:48
brain and it still works as a brain
20:51
i think you want to do it quite
20:53
carefully with like a clean knife yeah
20:56
and so music and the brain there's been
20:58
lots of studies about that and there's
21:01
been a study quite recently that looking
21:03
at brain waves of musicians and they
21:05
found that when two musicians think um
21:07
play a duet their brain waves
21:09
synchronize which is quite cool wow
21:11
yeah and there's another one that they
21:13
looked at jazz musicians as they're
21:15
improvising and found out that they
21:16
turned off areas linked to
21:18
self-censoring and inhibition
21:20
as they do that
21:22
and then there was another study by
21:23
harriet watt university that looked at
21:26
the kind of music people liked and then
21:28
gave them personality tests and found
21:30
out what kind of personalities they had
21:32
and they found that blues fans had high
21:34
self-esteem their creative outgoing
21:36
gentle and the t's
21:38
jazz fans have high self-esteem a
21:41
creative outgoing at ease
21:44
and a tease and the tease
21:49
classical music fans have high
21:50
self-esteem they're creative and they're
21:52
at ease
21:54
and rock and indie fans have low
21:56
self-esteem are not hard working not
21:59
gentle and not outgoing
22:02
excellent that's ash
22:05
what's up
22:06
sorry i was just having a nap
22:09
i couldn't keep up with all this um you
22:12
can't tell amazing things from looking
22:14
at people's brains can't you so it's a
22:16
really reliable way to predict someone's
22:18
political affiliations if you look at
22:20
someone's brain function you've got an
22:21
82 not you personally if you're a brain
22:23
surgeon you've got an 82 percent chance
22:26
of predicting someone's political
22:27
affiliation whether they would like how
22:29
they would actually vote
22:31
or democrat uh if they've had half their
22:32
brain removed they're a ukip supporter
22:36
wow politics oh my goodness this huge
22:39
this is new for us oh my god um another
22:41
quite cool thing you can tell is you can
22:43
predict if your relationship's gonna
22:44
last so what yeah so they they looked at
22:47
couples at the start of a relationship
22:49
when they said they were falling in love
22:50
and the couples where their brain
22:51
function showed that they were
22:52
suppressing the area of the brain that
22:54
usually is judgmental and the area of
22:56
their brain that's selfish um if they're
22:59
more suppressed then the relationship
23:01
lasts so so surely let's all like uh
23:04
there needs to be an app for this right
23:06
a brain scanning app yeah as soon as you
23:08
meet someone man that's weird isn't it
23:10
it's too that's it would be too scary
23:12
for people to do here's another thing
23:13
that explains how little we know about
23:15
the brain there was a case of a guy
23:17
called mr b we don't know what his real
23:18
name was um he had bad ocd depression
23:22
and anxiety
23:23
so he had um shock therapy that gave him
23:25
electric shocks and to in theory was
23:28
that they would change his brain waves
23:29
or whatever um so the treatment worked
23:32
actually quite well his ocd went his
23:33
depression went his anxiety went but it
23:35
had a strange side effect it turned him
23:37
into the world's biggest johnny cash fan
23:41
before the surgery mr b was a casual
23:43
music listener who liked dutch music the
23:46
beatles and the rolling stones but after
23:48
the treatment he bought every johnny
23:49
cash cd and dvd he could get his hands
23:52
on and he wouldn't listen to anything
23:54
else that's amazing um okay andy you got
23:57
anything to add this is interesting on a
23:59
perfect pitch it's also more common
24:00
among blind people for whom if you have
24:03
a perfect pitch it's more handy to work
24:05
out whether a car is moving or which
24:07
direction or footsteps it sort of gives
24:09
you more of
24:10
an idea of your surroundings and also
24:12
for people who speak other languages
24:14
because a third of the world's language
24:15
is a tonal
24:16
and
24:17
to understand yeah thai vietnamese and
24:19
and lots of chinese uh languages
24:22
that you need pitch to work out what
24:23
someone's actually saying to you so um
24:25
it's interesting that uh pitch is
24:29
not as powerful in our brains as rhythm
24:32
and that you can lose
24:34
through head traumas and disease and
24:36
stuff you can lose your ability to
24:38
differentiate pitch but it's really
24:40
really difficult to lose um
24:44
your idea of rhythm and your sense of
24:46
rhythm that's weird yeah so it goes so
24:48
it goes back further way further yeah
24:51
okay we need we need to wrap this one up
24:52
uh here's another preview from the mps
24:54
album
24:57
[Music]
24:58
[Applause]
25:01
[Music]
25:08
that song was called cosmic cat and uh
25:10
now it's time for the final fact of the
25:12
show and that's my fact and my fact this
25:14
week is during world war ii jack warner
25:17
who was the head of warner brothers
25:18
studio and the founder uh he realized
25:21
that from the air his hollywood studios
25:23
were indistinguishable from a nearby
25:25
aircraft factory
25:26
and uh as they were worried of bombing
25:28
happening at the time he had a giant
25:30
arrow painted on the rooftop with the
25:32
words lockheed that away
25:35
taking that a bit further what that what
25:37
everyone in america should have done was
25:38
painted on their roof white house this
25:40
way so no one got bombed apart from the
25:42
white house that's true wait why don't
25:44
you want to bomb the white house if
25:46
you're jack warner you don't want people
25:47
to bomb your studio so you paint an
25:49
arrow on it so surely everyone should
25:51
paint an arrow on their houses asking
25:53
them to bomb the president or just away
25:54
from my house please
25:59
yeah i think the president would have
26:00
been like guys
26:02
i saw an interview with the next head of
26:05
the us military a couple of years ago i
26:07
think it was on vice magazine
26:09
and the interviewer posed the question
26:11
whether if the whole world got together
26:13
and attacked america whether they could
26:15
land a single troop on american soil and
26:17
he reckoned no
26:19
really they'd stop us before we even got
26:20
to the he reckons if the whole world got
26:22
together not one troop would get landed
26:26
on american soil
26:27
what if yeah but surely canada's on our
26:29
side and mexico is right yeah exactly he
26:32
was he was like south america and
26:34
america that's he was like accounting
26:36
for them well i think we should try it
26:39
for you tomorrow
26:41
let's do it can i just say to the nsa if
26:43
they're listening i don't think that's a
26:44
very good idea at all
26:46
and when i say if they're listening
26:48
[Laughter]
26:50
i just with the thing of jack warner
26:52
painting a massive arrow on the roof the
26:54
i the thing that i liked about it though
26:56
was the idea that if there was a
26:57
japanese bomber flying over they would
26:58
look down to it and they'd be like oh
27:00
directions and i've always wondered
27:02
about directions like how do you in back
27:04
then how did you get flight directions
27:06
if you didn't have a map for the area or
27:08
whatever there are big concrete arrows
27:09
in america that's what yeah that's an
27:11
extraordinary thing that i had no idea
27:12
about uh yeah the post in america the
27:15
way that they used to direct the postman
27:17
was to have these huge concrete arrow
27:20
slabs on the ground and they would just
27:22
bring you from the east coast to the
27:24
west coast and back again and so like in
27:26
a plane yeah in a plane you'd look down
27:27
you'd see an arrow going that away all
27:29
right things about roofs oh yeah seeing
27:31
as that was the point at the start
27:34
apparently there are churches in the uk
27:35
that have a thing called the voice of
27:37
god which is a microphone on top of
27:39
their roof that when you're trying to
27:41
steal metal steal lead from their from
27:43
the roof then it'll say stop doing that
27:45
you terrible person you're going to hell
27:48
kind of thing and there seems to be a
27:50
lot of news articles about people
27:51
painting penises on the top of roofs
27:54
i've seen at least two or three of those
27:56
there was one in hungerford in 2009 a
27:58
guy called rory and painted a large
28:01
phallic symbol on his parents um roof
28:05
and his mother claire 49 said we don't
28:08
want any more children so the idea of
28:10
sleeping under a giant fertility symbol
28:12
is rather worrying
28:14
she's kind of missing the point
28:16
i think the journalists must have
28:18
pointed out to them that it was a
28:19
fertility symbol because she said that
28:21
and then the husband said we don't want
28:23
to lie in bed at night and hear couples
28:25
at it above us which is a really
28:26
confusing quote but i think he's
28:28
implying that randy couples are going to
28:30
come and go to their room oh like
28:31
they're doing the surname exactly
28:33
exactly but i did like that story
28:35
because they only found out that he'd
28:36
done it when he was away on his gap year
28:39
so they wrung him up and he was in
28:40
brazil at that time so he just said oh
28:42
you found it then
28:45
um jack warner just very quickly
28:47
character because i didn't know much
28:49
about him it's the big one of the
28:50
biggest movie studio names we all know
28:52
warner brothers um originally they were
28:54
called uh once golezer that was their
28:57
surname so it could have been once
28:58
glazer brothers um but they changed it
29:00
to warner uh they initially started uh
29:03
as three brothers um who were just going
29:05
getting into the movie business they
29:06
started the business as a result of
29:08
their dad selling his gold watch and
29:10
them selling their horse called bob and
29:12
jack warner was a really interesting
29:13
character very hated he out did all of
29:16
his brothers he got them to sell their
29:18
shares saying that that all of them were
29:19
going to share and then he bought them
29:20
all back the next day on his own and
29:22
they never spoke to each other again uh
29:24
even to the point when they fell out
29:26
that he was when his brother died harry
29:28
died uh they asked the press were like
29:30
hey oh you know any any response and he
29:32
said i don't give a about harry
29:34
yeah i mean that's that's intense he
29:35
said there's if you look at quotes of
29:37
his online all the quotes are just like
29:39
one was to an actress uh where he said
29:42
you were very good playing a
29:43
heroine but you shouldn't win an award
29:45
for playing yourself
29:47
that's harsh and he also apparently met
29:50
albert einstein and when he met albert
29:52
einstein uh he said to him i too have a
29:55
theory of relativity
29:57
don't hire them but he yeah him and his
29:59
older brother harry had a terrible
30:00
relationship and there was one uh
30:03
account of them
30:04
harry running through the studio chasing
30:06
jack wielding a lead piping screaming
30:09
i'm gonna kill you which is just so
30:10
seems like it was the inspiration for a
30:12
lot of cartoons that followed it yeah
30:14
did a lot of people get killed by lead
30:16
piping in the old days maybe they just
30:18
played pluto this is that's why pluto
30:19
was a really insensitive game when it
30:21
first came out
30:22
all i know about warner brothers is they
30:24
used to make cartoons
30:26
yeah it's weird that they made all these
30:27
all those big films and now we associate
30:29
warner brothers so much with cartoons
30:30
but they made quite a lot of uh
30:33
politically incorrect i'm to say
30:35
cartoons there is a group of films
30:36
called the censored 11 which are the 11
30:38
warner brothers films which had to be
30:40
suppressed from the 1950s onwards did
30:42
you know when uh when jack warner was
30:44
young and his uh his parents ran this
30:47
movie uh movie theater he used to be a
30:50
chaser which is somebody who would come
30:51
on in between the movies and sing to
30:54
clear out the audience to get a second
30:56
audience maybe that's where all his
30:58
bitterness comes from is the fact that
31:00
he was employed to be a he was yeah
31:02
he was a vaudeville performer when he
31:03
was younger and totally failed at it and
31:06
was really well known at just being a
31:09
bad comic and always having really bad
31:11
jokes but being quite keen and trying to
31:14
make people laugh just failing just on
31:16
warner brothers yeah do you know the was
31:19
flintstones to warner bros production i
31:20
started looking into all sorts of
31:22
barbarous wasn't it oh yeah oh on hannah
31:24
barbera actually i was reading about tom
31:26
and jerry the other day the last tom and
31:28
jerry cartoon that um hannah and barbara
31:30
directed they commit joint suicide at
31:33
the end of it so what they both get
31:35
dumped by their respective girlfriends
31:37
and so i think tom gets which one is the
31:39
cat tom's the captain yeah so he gets
31:41
dumped first so he's getting really
31:43
depressed and then jerry gets dumped and
31:44
they sit on a railway line and it ends
31:46
with them sitting waiting for the train
31:47
to come and mow them down that's so dark
31:50
yeah it's really weird they committed
31:52
suicide yeah they did together but it's
31:53
quite sweet because they did it together
31:54
they finally suicide packs are never
31:56
sweet
31:58
um so the flintstones used to be
32:00
sponsored by winston cigarettes and so
32:02
it used to have adverts once and
32:03
cigarettes at the beginning and the end
32:04
of it and there was a public outcry
32:07
about this because uh one of the most
32:09
famous was when fred and barney sneak
32:12
around the back of the house when the
32:13
women are doing the housework and they
32:15
sit down and have a cigarette and they
32:16
talk about how great it is that they're
32:17
smoking these great cigarettes while
32:19
their wives are doing all the hard work
32:21
and fred flintstone said winston tastes
32:24
good like cigarette should and there was
32:27
public outcry because that's a misuse of
32:29
the word like and it should be as
32:31
cigarette should
32:35
we're pretty angry about that
32:38
okay andy uh anything to add on american
32:41
military might america spends more on
32:43
its military than the next 15 countries
32:45
combined and the total amount of land
32:47
area occupied by u.s bases and
32:49
facilities is bigger than washington dc
32:52
massachusetts and new jersey combined
32:55
and on roof pinasia uh i've just found
32:59
two headlines from the metro that i want
33:00
to leave you with man surprised by
33:02
massive roof penis
33:04

hello and welcome to another episode of
00:20
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:22
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:24
covered garden my name is dan schreiber
00:26
i'm sitting here with james harkin andy
00:28
murray and anna chazinski and once again
00:31
we have gathered around the microphone
00:32
with our four favorite and spooky
00:36
facts from the last seven days for this
00:38
our halloween special and in no
00:40
particular order here we go
00:44
fact number one andy
00:46
my fact is that until the year 635 a.d
00:50
halloween was on the 12th of may
00:56
why was it on the 12th of may and why
00:57
did we change it well it's only really
00:59
on the 12th of may because it's
01:00
halloween is the day before all saints
01:02
day
01:03
yeah
01:03
i was under the impression that that was
01:05
the first of november
01:06
yes well basically halloween is part of
01:08
the all hallow tied festival it has
01:10
three days which is all hallows eve
01:12
which we call halloween all hallows day
01:14
or all saints day and all souls day it
01:15
was introduced in 609 a.d but it was on
01:18
the 13th of may and everyone would
01:19
travel to rome and do pilgrimages there
01:21
but in 835 gregory iv who was then the
01:24
pope said that it should become the
01:26
first of november and we're not really
01:28
sure why there is a theory that it was
01:30
because sort of a way of um adopting
01:33
other
01:34
religions or other traditional rights
01:36
and make folding them into the church
01:37
because there already was a kind of a
01:40
middle of orton yeah that's called
01:42
samhain and it was the festival of the
01:45
beginning of winter and there was a lot
01:46
of death around in the air and that's
01:48
what people said also autumn is just a
01:49
spookier time spring isn't a spooky time
01:52
that's when life starts to happen and
01:54
the sun's coming out except that when
01:56
people autumn spooky well when people
01:57
used to visit rome there is a theory
01:59
that it was moved to autumn because when
02:00
so many people visited rome everyone got
02:02
malaria which is itself quite a spooky
02:05
ah
02:06
to zombie-like yeah hordes of pilgrims
02:09
so but it did it used to be because
02:10
obviously we've transformed it into a
02:12
time of the undead and and all that
02:15
stuff like really was it as spooky back
02:18
then yeah so that might be why it might
02:19
have been nice in may yeah um there are
02:22
amazing halloween traditions which sort
02:24
of evolved from the whole remember the
02:25
dead thing so trick-or-treating came
02:27
from souling it was originally not just
02:29
children it was poor people and children
02:31
you would go door-to-door praying for
02:32
people
02:33
dead people in exchange for cake
02:36
i've heard some other ideas about where
02:37
trick or treat came yeah me too yeah
02:39
that's debate all right yeah
02:41
so here's one for instance they had
02:43
mischief night in leeds and bradford in
02:45
yorkshire
02:46
and the children would go around causing
02:47
trouble and the authorities would just
02:49
let them off and they say it's
02:52
mischief nate oh okay um there was also
02:55
um a thing called hop tuna in the isle
02:58
of man
02:59
and that had people wandering around
03:01
armed with bits of turnip singing in
03:04
banks and demanding cash
03:07
and the idea is that these guys from
03:09
like yorkshire or isle of man or ireland
03:12
or scotland had all gone over to america
03:14
during the you know whatever that was
03:16
and that's they brought it there and
03:17
then it's come back over here that's
03:19
that's one theory behind trick or treat
03:21
well i thought it was a i think it was
03:23
originally a german tradition but it was
03:25
popular in uh pennsylvania and dutch
03:28
communities in america up until the
03:29
early 20th century there are firsthand
03:31
accounts of it and it's called
03:32
bellsnickling which i think it should be
03:34
because it's just a good name but it was
03:36
a christmas tradition it happened on
03:37
christmas eve but it's so similar so
03:39
basically uh the teenagers of the
03:41
community would dress up as various
03:43
different characters fictional
03:45
characters and they go around kids
03:46
houses and they'd scare the kids and the
03:49
kids would have to guess what they were
03:50
dressed up as and if they guessed right
03:51
they got a sweet so basically there's
03:53
lots of different theories to trick or
03:54
treats it's probably just something that
03:56
builds up all over the world like it's
03:58
an obvious thing isn't it one night a
03:59
year you go a bit crazy yeah like the um
04:02
like the purge that movie
04:04
like the movie the perch
04:06
um so bobbing for apples is halloween
04:08
tradition now obviously it seems like it
04:10
should be more of a valentine's day
04:11
tradition so it was a way of people
04:14
selecting a future husband so each apple
04:17
would be dropped in water and assigned a
04:18
man's name and then a bunch of women
04:20
would rock up plunge their faces into
04:22
the water and the apple that they bit if
04:24
they bit the apple the first time then
04:25
they'd marry them out and live happily
04:26
ever after if they bit the apple
04:29
successfully the second time then he
04:31
would court her but their love would
04:32
fade and if they but the apple the third
04:34
time the relationship was doomed
04:36
but it used to be that um is it called
04:38
bobbing for apples because the name of
04:40
the man you might marry would be bobby
04:42
bob it was always bob yeah only people
04:44
called bob good attention
04:45
it sounds like swinging you know when
04:47
you throw your car keys into a hat but
04:49
with more commitment
04:50
yeah yeah what it feels like
04:53
it's weird because halloween has turned
04:54
in these days into a scare-mongering
04:57
time where everyone thinks bobbing for
04:59
apples were filled with razor blades and
05:01
and yeah
05:03
and big scare wasn't it there was a big
05:04
scare yeah yeah and just general you
05:06
know like you've got to watch out now
05:08
and it's not safe to be on the streets
05:09
um that portends badly for the
05:11
relationship doesn't it if the apple
05:12
you've bobbed into the man's name is
05:14
full of razor blades
05:17
but i got it first time so i'm sure the
05:19
marriage will be successful
05:22
um have you guys heard of a singer
05:23
called keisha yes spelled with a dollar
05:26
sign in her name okay cool because i
05:27
read something about her but i just
05:28
wanted to check people have heard of her
05:30
i haven't uh she has a song called
05:31
supernatural do you know what that's
05:33
about
05:34
ghosts it's about her having sex with a
05:36
ghost her experience having sex with
05:37
ghosts which she does um on a semi
05:40
regular basis apparently she once had to
05:42
go to a um hypnotherapist who told her
05:45
that she had dead people living in her
05:46
body and specifically in her nether
05:49
regions and so she had to have her
05:51
vagina exercised
05:53
and uh the song supernatural ex all
05:55
songs
05:58
dvd
06:00
following the footsteps of davina mccall
06:02
there's a word for someone for the ghost
06:04
that has sex with people but i can't
06:05
remember what it is succubus succubus
06:09
yeah are they the female and male
06:11
versions yeah yeah
06:13
that happens in ghostbusters yes
06:15
yeah yeah i saw a bus yesterday which
06:17
had ghost bus tours written on it which
06:19
i think is an amazingly good way of
06:21
doing it because they do ghost bus tours
06:23
it's better than calling it suck your
06:25
boss
06:28
um just quickly on the night terrors and
06:31
being assaulted by
06:32
ghosts in your sleep uh there's a
06:34
folklorist david huffer who estimates
06:36
that 15 percent of people will
06:38
experience that at some point in their
06:40
lives um so don't genuinely don't feel
06:43
bad if you've had it it's just
06:45
where you're kind of just kind of on the
06:47
verge of waking up or on the verge of
06:49
going to sleep and your consciousness
06:51
comes back but your body's still asleep
06:53
and so you can't really sit up and you
06:56
kind of get a bit of a terror that you
06:57
can't sit up i think that's quite a
06:58
common thing yeah and people believe
07:00
that it's like people believe it so that
07:02
they're being held hold on and down
07:04
the consciousness has come back before
07:06
the body has woken up properly that's
07:07
paris wow i had that uni it's absolutely
07:10
terrifying yeah so do you know what the
07:12
number one halloween costume is uh what
07:14
is the most popular uh a witch still
07:16
yeah what i thought it was gonna be
07:18
something really surprising like it's
07:19
actually isn't it
07:20
yeah but i thought it would be like i
07:21
don't know a super hero costume
07:24
there's a list online of the most
07:26
popular ones isn't there in america this
07:27
is and there are seven million uh
07:29
children dressed as witches in america
07:31
this year they think and there's going
07:33
to be 5.8 million princesses which is
07:35
the second most but how's that scary
07:38
yeah
07:39
well there's a theory that the costumes
07:40
comes from this tradition which is in
07:42
the middle ages where churches would
07:43
display their relics for um all hallows
07:46
eve and all hallows day but if they
07:48
didn't have any they would let the
07:49
parishioners dress up as the saints
07:50
instead ah how cool is that which saint
07:53
would you dress up as annie
07:54
um
07:56
i don't know saint jerome oh yeah what
07:57
did he look like
08:00
if i dress up as saint martin of tour
08:03
would i be allowed to do what he did
08:04
which was he went around exercising
08:06
people and one of the ways he did that
08:07
was to push his hand down their throat
08:09
and push the spirit out of their anus
08:12
he's going the wrong way about it if
08:13
he's trying to exercise keisha isn't he
08:17
apparently there's a quote which is
08:18
something like um
08:20
the spirit left a muddy filthy trail
08:23
behind it as it left
08:27
[Applause]
08:29
okay uh time for fact number two and
08:31
that is my fact my fact this week is
08:34
that witches used broomsticks to put
08:36
hallucinogenic drugs up their bums
08:39
what
08:40
turns out that a lot of historians
08:42
suggest that the imagery itself is
08:44
actually representative of what they
08:46
were going through which is that they
08:47
used to do hallucinogenic drugs and the
08:50
tripping and the flying that they used
08:51
to do was actually fly to the mind there
08:53
was stuff going on inside their head and
08:54
it was all just one big drug trip
08:58
which is insane a drug called dattura a
09:00
european drug that you could get which
09:02
was a hallucinogenic and they just used
09:04
to go through their mental landscape and
09:06
the flying bit of it is just
09:07
representative
09:09
of what they were going through in their
09:10
heads i suppose that's more logical than
09:12
them actually flying yeah what about the
09:14
broom well okay
09:17
the broom
09:18
was uh
09:20
a way of applying the datura drug which
09:23
uh it was an application device for the
09:25
bum oh wow a suppository a suppository
09:29
so all the imagery that you see is not
09:31
them flying on a broom it is using the
09:34
broom as a suppository for the drug a
09:37
guy called jordan de bergamo um in the
09:40
15th century he was one of the guys who
09:41
made up who who raised about it said
09:44
they anointed the staff and then
09:46
anointed themselves under the arms or in
09:48
other hairy places
09:50
which is another way one could refer to
09:52
it yeah exactly what you meant um yeah
09:54
so i i just like that i like that
09:56
because everyone dresses up as a witch
09:58
and they have an impression of why
09:59
they're dressing up as it and it turns
10:00
out there's a whole different
10:01
connotation to what do we think this is
10:03
definitely true about the broomstick or
10:05
because there must be some other
10:06
theories about why this yeah i i so i
10:09
found this out via a ethnobiologist
10:11
called wade davis oh yeah he's a guy
10:14
who's who's made extraordinary
10:15
adventures he's written great books and
10:17
this was just a passage inside this book
10:19
the book was actually about zombies on a
10:20
trip that he did to haiti we went to
10:22
five separate villages and in those
10:24
villages they all used the same
10:26
combinations of thing to create this
10:28
thing where people were cited as being
10:30
supposedly being zombies so
10:32
his idea is that he did discover what
10:34
makes zombies in haiti and it's this
10:36
potion i like the idea on potions that
10:39
um so i was reading about 16 in 16th
10:42
century spain this physician
10:44
he raided a house basically which was
10:46
occupied by what they thought was
10:48
witches and he confiscated from it a pot
10:51
full of a certain green ointment
10:53
composed of herbs such as hemlock
10:55
nightshade henbane and mandrake from a
10:57
home of a couple accused of witchcraft
10:59
and i just like the idea that that's the
11:00
16th century drugs raid
11:02
the doctor
11:03
well i've got some mandrakers i'm a
11:05
hemlock under the bed
11:08
the first woman in germany to run a post
11:10
office was burned as a witch
11:12
oh was she was it yeah nugget running a
11:15
post office no raising the price of stem
11:17
no she was called uh katarina hennot uh
11:20
or henno um and no she was she was just
11:23
um a big member of the community and
11:25
then she got accused of being a witch as
11:27
they often did
11:29
and then she was burned unfortunately
11:30
extraordinary number of witches or
11:32
alleged witches who were killed in
11:33
europe in the 15th to 18th centuries is
11:35
it 50 000
11:36
yeah something like that but like the
11:38
salem witch trials that basically came
11:40
as just someone accusing someone else
11:43
and then it went bigger and bigger and
11:44
bigger but it ended when um the wife of
11:48
the mayor or something like that got
11:49
accused of being a witch and then
11:50
suddenly the mayor went oh this is all
11:52
rubbish
11:53
you guys stop it but until then the
11:55
authorities had kind of agreed to it all
11:57
and then as soon as like one of the
11:58
wives of the main guys in the town was
12:00
accused then suddenly they were like
12:02
nope no yep definitely not true bloody
12:04
politicians i know
12:06
um they still uh in papua new guinea
12:08
there's still a tradition of kind of
12:10
hunting down witches and accusing people
12:11
of witchcraft and that's mainly focused
12:13
on men at the moment apparently
12:15
has quite a heavy focus on men yeah and
12:17
also when i was reading about this i
12:18
learned the difference between
12:19
witchcraft and sorcery which does make
12:21
total sense uh but what would you guess
12:23
it was men and women no it's witchcraft
12:24
is something that you are born with that
12:26
you have a gift inside you and sorcery
12:28
you can learn so we could all be
12:29
sorcerers but only i am a witch
12:32
one way of finding out if someone was a
12:34
witch in africa
12:36
was administering poison to a chicken
12:39
they're mentioning the name of a
12:40
suspected witch if the chicken dies then
12:42
the suspect is a witch which it might be
12:45
because the suspect is a witch or it
12:46
might be because you've just poisoned it
12:48
wow that's a stacked legal system you've
12:50
got yeah yeah yeah in the 19th century
12:53
uh there was a chicken that kept on
12:55
laying eggs saying that christ was
12:56
coming and the end of the world was nigh
12:58
um and everyone got really panicked by
12:59
this for a while it was and so it was
13:01
written on the eggs and eventually a guy
13:02
went to investigate it and it turned out
13:04
that it was being written on the eggs
13:05
and then they were being shoved back up
13:06
inside
13:08
them
13:10
again
13:14
have you heard of witch bottles you
13:15
would you would bury them this was in
13:17
the 16th and 17th centuries you would
13:19
bury them to ward off witches basically
13:21
and um you would fill up an ordinary
13:24
bottle with uh with hair and urine and
13:28
pins
13:29
okay and that was the person you wanted
13:31
to protect
13:32
you would put their urine in and it
13:34
would throw any spell they cast back on
13:35
you and they keep finding these things
13:37
buried all over the place that's weird
13:38
isn't it because that's almost like a
13:40
spell in itself isn't it yeah so you're
13:42
almost doing your own little bit of
13:44
witchcraft to get rid of the witch which
13:46
kind of makes you a witch as well oh no
13:48
it's a never-ending cycle eventually
13:49
we'll all be witches yeah the pins are
13:51
quite important to witches um they they
13:53
use them a lot in their in their spells
13:56
um the pendle witches who are from my
13:58
neck of the woods they were found to be
14:01
witches because one of them went to town
14:03
to try and procure some pins because
14:06
they needed them for the spells um asked
14:08
this guy for some pins he said no he
14:10
walked away she swore at him or
14:12
something he then had a stroke or a
14:14
heart attack and they thought that she'd
14:16
caused it
14:18
and then that's why they all got caught
14:20
and then hanged for being a witch oh
14:22
really yeah uh broom was traditionally
14:24
used in marriage ceremonies um in a lot
14:26
of cultures because one end represents
14:28
the phallic kind of male end and one end
14:30
is the the bristly female end but also
14:33
the youngest person to get a patent on
14:35
something is a little boy who's got a
14:37
patent on a double-headed broomstick and
14:39
it's sam hofton of buxton in derbyshire
14:42
he was three years old when he came up
14:43
with it and by chance his father was a
14:46
patent lawyer
14:52
okay time for fact number three and that
14:54
is chozinski yeah my fact is that the
14:56
woman who played the voice of reagan in
14:59
the exorcist only agreed to play the
15:01
part on the grounds that she have two
15:02
priests in her sound booth at all times
15:05
could be constantly drinking whiskey
15:07
chain smoking cigarettes and eating raw
15:09
eggs coincidentally
15:10
very similar to anna's rider for all
15:13
things reporting
15:15
we just haven't mentioned gregory
15:17
hayden boys
15:21
obviously she had a majorly raspy angry
15:23
voice in there but why the priests well
15:26
because so she decided that yeah as you
15:27
say she wanted to do the whiskey and the
15:29
cigarettes and the raw eggs because she
15:30
thought that would give her the right
15:31
voice but she was an alcoholic and she
15:34
had was dry and so she
15:36
was she also addicted to raw eggs and
15:38
priests
15:41
so she thought the priest would monitor
15:42
her because uh to make sure that she
15:45
wasn't falling off the wagon in the
15:46
process of drinking the whiskey oh they
15:48
weren't there to kind of exercise any
15:49
demons
15:51
well that's what i thought i thought
15:52
presumably it was because of
15:53
spirituality so i've read both but the
15:55
either the director or the producer i
15:56
can't remember who just had an interview
15:58
where he said that it was because she
15:59
was an alcoholic but then i have also
16:01
read that it might be because she wanted
16:02
to make sure no evil spirits got into
16:04
her while she was playing the part but
16:05
yeah warner brothers who were talking
16:06
about last week failed to credit her for
16:08
voicing her in the exorcist well it
16:10
sounded like uh from what i read she
16:11
didn't want to be credited initially
16:13
because she just saw i'm just doing a
16:14
voicing and it was such a popular movie
16:16
in fact i think still to this day uh it
16:18
was the highest highest grossing film of
16:21
the time that they that warner brothers
16:22
had i think adjusted for inflation yeah
16:24
adjusted for inflation that was the
16:26
highest grossing film that they had so i
16:28
think as soon as that happened she
16:30
suddenly wanted to be credited oh yeah
16:32
you know the scene where the girl's neck
16:34
spins around and snaps back into place
16:36
yeah that sort of sound of her neck
16:38
like creaking around it was actually
16:40
made by the director's wallet
16:42
he had a little cracked leather wallet
16:44
and he just sort of twisted it around
16:46
near the microphone and that made this i
16:48
just love the idea that he's such a
16:49
cheapskate that whenever he opens his
16:51
wallet it makes his creepy sound
16:54
and the shot of the cobwebs close up
16:56
that was inside there
16:58
he used to the director used to in order
17:00
to achieve the requisite levels of fear
17:02
on the faces of the actors used to fire
17:04
guns during filming at certain points
17:09
i could never tell if this stuff is true
17:10
when you read this about movies he was
17:12
interviewed yeah i know but he said he
17:14
did it okay in scream drew barrymore is
17:16
the opening scene in scream if you
17:18
remember the movie where she's chased
17:20
and she becomes the first victim of the
17:22
the villain um apparently in order to
17:25
keep her scared on set wes craven would
17:28
go around telling her stories of animals
17:30
being harmed because she loved it yes
17:33
and that would put the fear in her brain
17:35
it's like no she's an actor she knows
17:37
how to act scared it's kind of insulting
17:39
to the actors a little bit yeah it's
17:40
like oh you can't do a scared face i'm
17:42
going to have to pretend to shoot you
17:43
yeah yeah so in alien the famous
17:46
spoiler alert chest bursting scene the
17:49
actors weren't told about it beforehand
17:51
and i think i've read a bit more i think
17:53
they were told but not in detail they
17:55
weren't told exactly how horrible it was
17:56
going to be and they did use four
17:58
cameras for the tech so they got to see
17:59
the re the real sort of horror on the
18:01
face yeah the actors reacting so well
18:02
there's another one at the alien movie
18:05
which is that um they needed a shot of a
18:07
cat looking scared apparently it wasn't
18:09
scary enough for someone in an alien
18:11
costume to be there so what they had was
18:13
they had a screen down with the cat
18:14
sitting there as the camera's filming it
18:16
lifted the screen and there was a dog
18:17
sitting there and they didn't tell the
18:19
cat that there was going to be a dog
18:20
that's kind of insulting to the cat
18:22
saying that he can't act properly yeah
18:23
it's true um the exorcist wouldn't have
18:25
been written if it weren't for groucho
18:27
marx really i think yeah who wrote it
18:29
yeah yeah
18:31
in fact
18:32
actually the guy who did write it had
18:33
only ever written comedy before
18:35
um and then wrote the interest but uh so
18:37
he's called william blatty and he went
18:40
on this show called you bet your life
18:42
which was hosted by groucho marx yeah
18:44
and he won ten thousand dollars which
18:46
allowed him to take some time off more
18:47
grueling work and right now
18:49
yes that's great yeah
18:52
who wrote to kill a mockingbird uh
18:54
worked on an airline booking
18:56
uh desk
18:58
uh maybe or maybe she was sort of
18:59
managing an airline booking outfit and
19:01
then she was given a sabbatical by her
19:03
employers and that's when she wrote to
19:04
kill a mockingbird wasn't kafka just a
19:06
clerk and then he just used to go home
19:08
and write and stuff like that i always
19:09
love that idea of these great writers
19:11
actually doing other
19:12
jobs
19:13
in their spare time there's a thing in
19:15
the the latest fact book we've just done
19:17
which is that there are 500 references
19:19
to jeffrey chaucer in his lifetime which
19:20
is a huge number for someone living at
19:22
that time yeah not one of them says that
19:24
he's a writer it's always he was a spy
19:26
wasn't he or something was he think so
19:28
oh he's a good one then
19:29
i did not get you haven't read the spy's
19:32
tale
19:32
[Laughter]
19:35
um jack nicholson was a firefighter and
19:38
in the shining when there's that really
19:40
famous scene in the shiny if you've seen
19:41
it where he has to hack down the door
19:43
with an axe the props guys originally
19:45
made a prop door that was really easy to
19:46
hack down because even a firefighter he
19:48
hacked it down too easily so they had to
19:50
get an actual door put in for him to
19:52
hack down
19:53
because he was two cause he was
19:54
supermanly and strong wow yeah well
19:56
that's cool what a cool guy i have a
19:57
thing about e.t um et was originally
20:00
conceived of as a horror movie was it
20:02
yeah it was after close encounters of
20:04
the third kind uh spielberg wanted to do
20:05
more
20:06
more alien stuff um but he wanted to do
20:09
something darker and more threatening
20:10
than close encounters and so he
20:12
commissioned the script and it featured
20:13
aliens who could kill you just with one
20:14
long bony finger remember et's finger
20:17
and they made a load of prototypes of
20:19
the models of it and they basically look
20:20
like evil et's you know how in gremlins
20:23
the bad mogwais look a bit like yeah the
20:25
good one um that's basically and then
20:28
did they realize that drew barrymore was
20:30
incapable of doing the requisite scared
20:31
face so they had to change so steven
20:33
spielberg came in and said animals are
20:36
being attacked
20:38
yeah
20:38
can i tell you one quick thing about
20:39
exorcisms please don't yeah we're going
20:41
to move on shortly but so this is the
20:42
thing the the catholic church still has
20:44
five or six hundred exorcists official
20:46
ones um one of them uh gabrielle amorth
20:50
is the the kingpin of them he's
20:52
supposedly done a hundred thousand he
20:53
used to do 20 a day wow 20 a day yeah
20:56
but they do that's a lot isn't it but
20:57
you can rattle through them they're
20:58
easier than you think yeah no
21:00
they are true katie brand the comedian
21:03
she used to do them really
21:05
yeah katie brown used to be a part of a
21:07
church and one of the things that she
21:08
used to do was
21:09
uh demon exercising
21:12
down the throat version or was it i
21:14
think it was more they've what
21:16
do you have i think you just
21:18
yeah yeah i think also it's a lot of
21:19
yelling like the power of christ compels
21:21
you it's that sort of stuff and people
21:23
are talking in tongues and yeah saint
21:24
hilarion used to could exercise up to
21:26
400 people at the same time so i think
21:28
you can do them ensemble if you're very
21:30
good she also wants exercise to camel
21:32
it's amazing um so i just wanted to tell
21:34
you one thing i found from an article
21:36
about these exorcism conferences the
21:38
church has um during the conference the
21:39
reverend cesar trokui an exorcist based
21:42
in switzerland recounted one experience
21:43
he had aboard a swiss air flight two
21:45
lesbians he said had sat behind him on
21:48
the plane soon afterwards he said he
21:50
felt satan's presence as he silently
21:52
sought to repel the evil spirit through
21:54
prayer one of the women he said began
21:56
growling demonically and threw
21:57
chocolates at his head
22:00
typical demon behavior asked how he knew
22:03
the woman was possessed he said
22:05
once you hear a satanic growl you never
22:07
forget it it's like smelling margarita
22:09
pizza for the first time it's something
22:11
you never forget
22:14
margarita pizza do you know what the
22:16
first ever horror film was
22:18
oh yeah it was in 1898
22:21
no it wasn't it was before that it was
22:22
it was a george melliers
22:25
movie yeah it was like two minutes long
22:27
wasn't it yeah it was about two minutes
22:28
long and and um he followed it up with
22:31
another movie so it was cool i think the
22:32
first one was called the haunted castle
22:34
yeah the second one was the second one
22:35
was three minutes long and everyone said
22:36
no they've gone overboard this
22:39
i year
22:39
i can't take it
22:41
this so uh the second movie this was the
22:43
plot a man tries to go to sleep but is
22:45
disturbed by a giant bug climbing up the
22:47
bed onto his wall he attacks the bug
22:49
with a broom and disposes of it in a
22:50
chamber pot in a compartment of his
22:52
bedside table
22:54
and that was it that's the second horror
22:56
movie ever made third horror movie ever
22:58
made was a remaking of the haunted hotel
23:00
by george eliot by another group of
23:02
people that's amazing yeah and nosferatu
23:05
um that was the first version of dracula
23:08
but the first movie to have the name
23:09
dracula on it was in the i believe in
23:12
the 20s they did this really interesting
23:14
thing where they made um dracula by in
23:16
the daytime the english version and a
23:18
spanish film crew came in at night used
23:21
all the same sets and made a spanish
23:23
version of dracula so they made it in
23:25
tandem which seems like a really great
23:27
idea if they were using the same sets
23:28
but they were using totally different
23:29
also it means that the whole of the
23:31
british one has to be set during the
23:32
daytime which is probably not when
23:35
dracula only came out at night doesn't
23:36
get out much so yeah yeah
23:39
it's just a guy he keeps intimating that
23:41
he has a secret at night but we never
23:42
see what he does
23:43
[Laughter]
23:45
um the actor who played in bella lugosi
23:47
oh yeah but he was buried in the cape
23:49
that he wore
23:51
in the dracula movie let's see yeah okay
23:53
yeah just a nice little it was the first
23:55
time anyway
24:00
okay time for the final fact of the show
24:02
james okay my fact is that the secret of
24:06
youth is drinking youngster's blood
24:10
great thing to be condoning on our
24:12
podcast we should also mention that next
24:14
to anna's two priests are some
24:16
youngsters for james
24:19
open brackets if you're a mouse close
24:21
brackets and they're also mice
24:25
so these are some studies done quite
24:26
recently um where they've transplanted
24:29
young mice blood into older mice and
24:32
they've reversed some of the signs of
24:34
aging in these mice what signs they
24:37
stopped being racist and stuff that's
24:39
amazing
24:39
[Laughter]
24:41
um yeah it's really incredible no it is
24:42
amazing uh they're not quite sure why
24:44
they think this might be some some
24:46
compounds in there which which help you
24:48
but it's um like muscle mass um
24:51
it's the brain tissue it's it's all
24:53
sorts of all sorts of things wow
24:56
probably won't work in humans just for
24:58
that disclaimer
25:03
yeah well i mean you couldn't really do
25:04
it could you but i don't think there's
25:06
any evidence that it works in humans
25:08
very good i'll do it yeah you're younger
25:10
than me yep oh no
25:12
remember that was the theory that the
25:13
queen mother
25:15
was constantly having no i've not heard
25:17
that theory get out of course you've
25:18
heard that no i really haven't remember
25:20
we move in different circles dude
25:22
no there was the big dan moves in
25:24
different crop circles to us
25:27
it was the big thing that the the queen
25:29
uh the queen mother the reason she was
25:32
able to stay old and alive
25:34
alive being the main one uh was that she
25:37
used to have blood of the young
25:40
i don't know i've genuinely never heard
25:41
that i know i don't think any normal
25:43
people have well the queen mother there
25:45
is a headline from the telegraph queen
25:46
mother is given eight hour blood
25:48
transfusion which is when she was 101
25:50
but it was um
25:51
it was to help her recover from uh
25:54
anemia which she had she wasn't
25:55
personally biting into the necks of
25:57
youngsters yes it was a medical
25:58
procedure
26:00
you're looking on the wrong site mate
26:01
because davideick.com clearly says
26:04
people did used to uh try blood
26:06
transfusions doctors didn't they before
26:08
it was in any way a safe or sensible
26:10
thing to do and for weird stuff like i
26:12
think uh louis the 14th personal
26:15
physician jean-baptiste denny uh used to
26:18
do blood transfusions to various people
26:20
for various things infused the same guy
26:22
with calf's blood twice because he was
26:24
suffering from a mental illness and he
26:27
had various symptoms after this like um
26:30
vomiting passing black urine etc but for
26:32
some reason he agreed to a third attempt
26:34
at which point he died from the blood
26:36
transfusion because obviously it was
26:37
incredibly unsafe in those days and i
26:39
didn't know about blood types and stuff
26:41
no no um but it turned out so then he
26:44
was accused of killing the guy and then
26:46
they've tested his blood since the guy
26:47
who died and it's turned out that he was
26:49
poisoned by arsenic probably murdered by
26:51
his wife who obviously saw an
26:52
opportunity i thought you'd probably get
26:54
this blamed on that doctor man yeah yeah
26:57
yeah the first documented um case of any
27:00
kind of transfusion was uh by pope
27:02
innocent the eighth he was a 15th
27:05
century pope
27:06
um he was supposedly given the blood of
27:09
three ten-year-old boys but he took it
27:11
by mouth he didn't transfuse it into his
27:13
blood
27:14
yeah and also it's not that maybe it's
27:16
not true and it's just like anti-people
27:18
hysteria yeah okay right but that's the
27:20
first written evidence we have of anyone
27:22
taking someone else's blood lover's name
27:23
pope innocent yeah you're making a
27:25
suggestion that's not an anti-papal name
27:28
is it
27:29
guilty they called him okay in really
27:31
witty circles yeah yeah i i do mix in
27:35
those witty circles
27:37
james is a joke writer for the
27:39
protestant society
27:42
um
27:43
i've read a bit more about this mouse
27:44
experiment oh yeah so the um the young
27:47
mice that they did the experiment with
27:49
were three months old and the elderly
27:50
mice were 18 months old i just think
27:52
that's quite sweet yeah
27:54
completely decrepit um but they i mean
27:56
they did it partly by stitching together
27:58
their circulatory systems yeah which is
28:00
an extraordinary idea and then after the
28:02
experiment they the mice who had been
28:04
treated the elderly mice who've been
28:06
treated remembered how to find a hidden
28:08
resting platform in a water maze better
28:10
than the control group and this is the
28:12
maze that they use for mice these days i
28:14
don't know if you know this it's not
28:15
like the hampton court maze anymore it's
28:17
basically it's a lot smaller these days
28:19
yeah it's just way too big no but they
28:21
um so the standard mouse test these days
28:25
is either a t shape or a y shape or it's
28:28
a tub of milky water with a platform
28:30
hidden somewhere under the surface and
28:32
they put the mouse in and it has to swim
28:34
desperately around until it can find the
28:36
platform
28:37
that's amazing
28:39
it sounds easy to use much easier than
28:40
hampton court
28:45
anyway animals that drink blood uh a
28:47
tick can drink 600 times its own body
28:50
weight in blood in one sitting um
28:53
and it's so it's back blows up to look
28:55
like a balloon it's great oh yeah
28:58
there's also a bird that drinks blood
29:00
vampire finches have evolved in the
29:01
galapagos islands because it's quite
29:04
tough climate out there for them to
29:05
survive and they've worked out that they
29:06
can peck at the backs of other birds of
29:09
booby birds apparently and they can get
29:11
bits of blood out of them but the
29:13
interesting thing is is that they don't
29:14
mind
29:15
yeah they don't booby birds just sit
29:17
there and they're kind of
29:19
mine
29:20
they think that either they don't react
29:21
because uh there are a lot of the
29:23
finches so they might be swarmed by the
29:24
finches so they've worked out that
29:25
they're going to be killed by them
29:28
yeah they're sitting there hating it and
29:30
they're just saying to each other just
29:31
leave it just leave it please
29:32
it's not worth it it's not worth it
29:34
so this is cool um
29:36
while we're on vampire animals vampire
29:39
bats obviously well there's the common
29:41
vampire then there's the hairy legged
29:42
vampire bat and the white winged vampire
29:44
bat and the white winged one and they
29:46
feed on birds and mammals um
29:49
their trick for getting chickens is they
29:51
will approach a hen and they'll mimic a
29:53
chick by nuzzling up to her brood patch
29:56
which is a bit of skin on her underside
29:57
which her she uses to transfer heat to
30:00
the eggs
30:01
as she nests and the hen sometimes
30:03
thinks it's her baby cuddling up to her
30:05
and so she'll just sit on the bed um
30:08
which which then has an all-you-can-eat
30:10
buffet
30:11
because it's managed to trick their hand
30:12
into thinking that it's uh
30:14
yeah maybe cruel freaky that is
30:17
um bed bugs also drink blood and young
30:20
bed bugs are transparent so the first
30:22
meal they have turns them red
30:24
oh my goodness i really love that image
30:27
oh head last mouth parts are transparent
30:30
as well so you can see a little vein of
30:32
blood going from a scalp into the
30:35
headlights oh that's cool yeah well i
30:37
remember in australia head lice you'd
30:38
always get head lice because you were
30:40
always in the bush and stuff the school
30:41
i went to at least we were constantly
30:43
having today yeah we always had life in
30:44
school but that's because of schools and
30:46
kids not the bush
30:48
but yeah they are quite see-through you
30:50
can see yeah you can see i remember one
30:52
falling out of my head once i'm being
30:53
like wow yeah they were so good that's a
30:55
donation they just look as well they
30:57
don't jump there's normally children
30:58
playing and it has to be one head
31:00
touching another so if you have a group
31:02
photo obviously they spread like
31:03
wildfire but it's it's
31:04
also the idea that they prefer clean
31:06
hair to dirty hair is just they just
31:08
like hair oh do they yeah they're just
31:10
like a place where they can grab on some
31:12
hair and drink some blood they don't
31:13
care if it's dirty or right it sounds
31:15
like a rumor that was propagated by nine
31:16
year olds recalcitrant nine-year-olds
31:18
what's weird though is that they just
31:20
stay exclusively here they stay in your
31:22
head hair whereas
31:24
pubic glass travel all over the body you
31:26
can get them in your eyebrows you can
31:28
get them in your eyelashes but you don't
31:29
get them in your hair and they're two
31:30
separate species and they don't actually
31:32
cross over yeah very odd i've been
31:34
reading a book it's a book about
31:35
parasites and it says if you have pubic
31:37
lice in your eyelashes you've probably
31:40
done something to deserve that
31:42
it's probably been in the bush
31:49
okay that's it that's all our facts
31:51

00:00
hi everybody it's andy here just to
00:02
start with a bit of shameless
00:03
self-promotion before we get into this
00:05
week's episode proper which is that we
00:07
have written a new book and it's just
00:09
been published it's called 1411 qi facts
00:12
to knock you sideways it's got a lot of
00:15
facts that we found out researching this
00:17
podcast a lot of effects that we found
00:18
out
00:19
not researching the podcast it's got a
00:20
lot of facts in it basically so
00:22
if you like facts please do buy a copy
00:24
and then 20 or 30 more for your friends
00:26
and family okay
00:28
cheers run it on qi a few years ago yeah
00:31
um which was there's no such thing as a
00:33
fish there's no such thing as a fish no
00:35
seriously it's in
00:36
the oxford dictionary of underwater life
00:39
it says it right there first paragraph
00:41
no such thing as a fish
00:47
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:49
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:52
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:54
cover and garden my name is dan
00:55
schreiber i'm sitting here with anna
00:56
jaczynski james harkin and andy murray
00:59
and once again we've gathered around the
01:00
table with our four favorite facts from
01:02
the last seven days
01:03
and here they are in no particular order
01:07
okay fact number one james okay my fact
01:10
this week is that comets stink how could
01:13
you know that
01:14
so the rosetta probe which we all know
01:17
is
01:17
currently going around the comet and
01:20
during that they've managed to collect
01:21
some
01:22
data from the comet itself they've
01:24
managed to do some spectral analysis
01:26
on the molecules and they found out that
01:28
it smells
01:29
like a mixture of rotten eggs cat urine
01:32
and bitter almonds
01:33
yummy although did we talk about the
01:35
fact that cat urine is good
01:37
if you smell it in wine
01:49
is like ammonia isn't it that's the kind
01:51
of smell but the
01:52
chemicals that they have on this comet
01:54
are hydrogen sulfide ammonia hydrogen
01:57
hydrogen cyanide formaldehyde methanol
02:00
and sulfur dioxide
02:02
and that apparently gives those smells i
02:04
really like the science writers who
02:05
receive that kind of slightly dry some
02:08
people would say report from rosetta and
02:10
go
02:10
so i've read this list of chemicals do
02:12
you think we can do the headline
02:14
comet stinks yeah let's go with it
02:18
well you're kind of over yeah fine it
02:20
does overstate it a bit because
02:21
actually if you were on the comet you
02:22
wouldn't be able to smell it because the
02:24
molecules are just not numerous enough
02:26
for your nose to detect them
02:28
if you had a sniffer dog they'd be able
02:29
to detect it dogs can smell the weirdest
02:31
things i didn't actually realize their
02:33
nostrils were as amazing as they are
02:34
so they can smell whale poo from a mile
02:37
away
02:38
they've been trained to basically the
02:40
way they tell the way they tell about
02:41
whale's health is to
02:43
analyze their poo it's on the edge of a
02:45
boat so there's the edge of the yeah
02:47
okay just
02:47
sorry just kind of like just holding it
02:49
yeah just barking whenever it finds the
02:51
poo
02:51
i read this on the daily mail i don't
02:53
know if it's true
02:55
and cbd's they can smell dvds as well
02:57
which helps her when people are
02:59
trying to counterfeit dvds and get them
03:01
over borders and stuff so they can smell
03:02
huge hordes of dvds
03:04
dogs are right nosed i think when they
03:07
smell they smell with their right
03:08
nostrils all of them
03:09
that's a good question i don't know if
03:11
it's like humans and some of them aren't
03:12
doctors who are more creative and ask
03:15
all the time
03:22
um yes so harmful smells they smell with
03:25
their right nostril but nice familiar
03:26
smells they reserve for their
03:28
nostrils and their right nostril new
03:29
smells they always smell with the more
03:31
sensitive right nostril and weirdly
03:32
there is the other way around
03:33
so they prick up their left ear when
03:36
they're hearing something that's
03:37
threatening like a thunderstorm
03:39
and if they're hearing like other dogs
03:40
barking that they want to hang out with
03:41
they pick up their right ear
03:42
wow there's something threatening over
03:44
on their right they spin round and round
03:45
and round and then collapse
03:47
just to take it back to space for a
03:48
minute oh yeah even if you were
03:50
up there the odds are that if you're an
03:52
astronaut up there you might not be able
03:53
to smell this comet and that's
03:55
in spite of the few molecules thing
03:56
because in
03:58
space the sense of smell really suffers
04:00
because all the fluids that normally
04:02
pooling at the bottom of your body
04:03
throughout the day just because you're
04:04
upright go all over your body and they
04:06
tend to bunch up
04:07
in your upper torso in your head which
04:08
is why astronauts like eating spicy food
04:10
because it's some of the few foods that
04:12
can actually get through the sinuses
04:14
right you smell better do humans like
04:16
smell
04:17
half the time on the left nose and half
04:18
the time of the right nose or something
04:20
like that that's how you breathe
04:21
through nostrils on an alternating basis
04:23
um camels have the ability to close
04:25
their nostrils
04:25
yeah because of sand it's like with
04:27
their eyelids so they have three sets of
04:28
eyelids yeah
04:29
one which are like window wipers the
04:31
other which is the normal eyelids and
04:32
the third one which are transparent so
04:33
that when it's sandy they can just see
04:35
through anyway
04:36
and their nostrils as well have the
04:37
ability to go and just shut up
04:39
yeah they make that noise
04:52
i love that my impressions are limited
04:54
to you
04:56
don't get down to do impressions his
04:58
retracting hippo testicles are exactly
05:00
the same as covering nostrils as is
05:02
arnold schwarzenegger
05:06
um the comet doesn't smell bad to
05:09
anyone under the age of four because
05:12
apparently
05:12
up until the age of four nothing smells
05:14
bad to you what oh
05:16
this is a ted talk given by this um
05:18
four-year-old
05:21
great guy i like it all so everything is
05:22
just interesting and then you learn to
05:24
react badly to certain smells post the
05:25
age of four
05:26
i feel like i've made my brother smell
05:28
wasabi before he was four and he freaked
05:30
out
05:30
but that's more of a that's more
05:32
sensation you know that losing your
05:34
sense of smell is one of the
05:35
chief indicators of dying soon they've
05:37
tested lots of elderly people and of the
05:39
elderly people who
05:40
couldn't smell or whose sense of smell
05:43
was really badly impaired
05:44
a significantly higher proportion of
05:45
those people died in the following five
05:47
years right
05:48
his own is not guaranteed at all it's
05:50
interesting that you're saying that your
05:51
sense of smell
05:52
is dulled in space because there are
05:54
quite a lot of examples of astronauts
05:56
giving very
05:57
sort of exact descriptions of what
05:58
things smell like like buzz aldrin and
06:00
neil armstrong saying that the moon
06:02
smelled of gunpowder
06:03
when they got back in also apparently
06:06
one of the big issues that they have so
06:07
as well as having a sniffer at nasa one
06:09
of the big things they were trying to
06:10
work out was the diet
06:12
of astronauts because both farting and
06:14
burping
06:15
were massive things particularly in the
06:16
apollo missions going to the moon it
06:18
just smelled of farts it's because of
06:19
the smell and not because it could
06:20
propel you across the station no
06:22
uh mary roach who wrote a book called
06:24
packing for mars actually looked into
06:25
that there was an idea that you could
06:26
fart propel yourself across
06:28
yeah surely you could according to the
06:30
person that she asked he said that the
06:32
size of the human
06:33
against the push of whatever air was
06:35
coming out wouldn't be enough
06:36
to actually do it it would be enough but
06:38
you just probably wouldn't move very far
06:40
yeah you should have had a lot of baked
06:42
beans before going into space
06:44
17 000 cans you have to not care how
06:46
long it took you to get to the other
06:47
side
06:48
of the space lounge space lounge i mean
06:51
it should be called lounge they must
06:52
have a lot they must have a lounge here
06:53
on the iss yeah or in any did they have
06:56
one on
06:57
apollo 11 not a lounge no
07:00
it's a luxury isn't it yeah i think
07:02
that's that wasn't the necessary trimmed
07:04
down
07:06
loser billiard room
07:11
um so we've definitely covered in our
07:13
fact books before that in space
07:14
astronauts hearts get rounder
07:16
oh yeah but also in space their eyeballs
07:18
get flatter
07:19
wow people are in space for a long
07:21
mission they report blurred vision
07:22
sometimes
07:23
and what they think is the reason is
07:25
extra fluids in your head which are
07:27
normally elsewhere in the body so this
07:28
results in a flattening of the eyeballs
07:30
and
07:30
even swelling around the optic nerve and
07:32
when they go back to earth the swelling
07:33
around the optic nerve subsides but
07:35
sometimes um
07:36
your eyes don't uh they don't round out
07:38
again
07:39
right you have slightly flatter eyeballs
07:41
if you had aliens who came to earth
07:43
and they looked like humans you would be
07:45
able to tell they were aliens because
07:47
they'd have flatter eyeballs because
07:48
they've been in space before they came
07:50
here so that could be a way of
07:51
oh yeah that is the plot of james's
07:54
first novel
07:56
i was reading uh bill bryson's short
07:59
history nearly everything a while ago
08:00
and he says this thing about comets
08:02
in it and i guess meteorites anything
08:04
that enters the earth's atmosphere
08:06
he was asking these two guys what kind
08:08
of warning we would have against a
08:10
comet meteor asteroid strike and they
08:13
said
08:13
in all reality unless someone had
08:16
spotted it
08:16
and it's very hard to spot one second
08:19
well for that
08:20
that's our warning well what about there
08:23
wasn't
08:23
any warning of that it just came down
08:25
and landed in the middle of russia
08:26
would have been one second here what
08:29
would you do with that one last second
08:31
[Laughter]
08:33
well i guess i'd ring people and tell
08:35
them what i really thought
08:36
[Laughter]
08:39
comets a lot of scientists think that uh
08:40
it's comets that brought life to earth
08:43
don't they because comets are
08:44
made of water well of ice and that might
08:47
be where the water and organic matter
08:49
for earth came from
08:50
uh when hail bought the last time
08:52
hellbop came around because they're on
08:53
orbits around the sun and they go past
08:55
the earth every now and then the last
08:56
time it came before 1997 was when
08:58
stonehenge was being built
08:59
approximately really that's how big that
09:02
orbit is
09:04
and so people going crazy with comets
09:07
that happens quite a lot
09:08
in 1910 there was a comet it was
09:10
halley's comet where everyone went crazy
09:12
when it came over do you remember
09:14
why did they go crazy well what happened
09:15
was you know all these chemicals that
09:17
they found
09:18
one of them includes cyanide and people
09:20
had already realized that there was
09:21
cyanide inside a comet's tail
09:23
and some people had thought that the
09:25
when the comet goes past
09:26
the tail would go through the earth and
09:28
we'd all get killed by cyanide
09:30
and so everyone thought the world's
09:31
going to end not in one second but in
09:33
like a few years you'd all asphyxiate
09:35
basically so they had end of the world
09:37
parties in new york
09:38
they had enormous we're all going to die
09:40
events everywhere it was this
09:42
mad enormous scare like yeah everyone
09:45
they sold these
09:46
leather inhalers that you would cover
09:47
your mouth with so that it wouldn't kill
09:49
you
09:49
some people thought that the cyanide
09:51
would react with the earth's atmosphere
09:52
and create laughing gas and so
09:54
everything would be
09:55
killed after death yeah if you want to
09:57
do an operation with a lot of operations
09:59
booked for that moment
10:01
and there was one guy in california who
10:03
somehow managed to nail himself to a
10:05
cross
10:06
on the day it was going to happen and
10:08
then of course the day we got the second
10:10
hand
10:11
well that's why it says somehow
10:18
okay time for fact number two and that
10:21
is andy
10:23
so my fact is that the explorer sir
10:25
rannell fines who is the oldest briton
10:27
ever to have climbed
10:28
mount everest used to get such bad
10:30
vertigo that he would ask his wife to
10:31
climb ladders to clear the gutters
10:33
instead of him
10:34
that sounds like an excuse doesn't it it
10:36
does yeah and
10:37
we're talking about is it acrophobia he
10:39
has a fear of heights
10:40
i don't think he has the yeah the
10:42
medical vertigo which is where you feel
10:44
dizzy no matter whether you're in a high
10:45
place or not
10:46
so yeah it's weird everest is one of the
10:48
only mountains i've seen
10:49
where any photo doesn't justify the
10:51
largeness or the danger of it because
10:53
it's such a wide
10:55
mountain right you can't really get an
10:56
understanding of how tall it is that's
10:58
true
10:58
like the main peak of everest is the
11:00
highest peak in the world of course but
11:02
the second highest peak
11:03
is the second highest peak of everest
11:06
which is taller than k2
11:07
oh that's cheating it is cheap yeah it's
11:10
riding on the back of someone else right
11:12
until the very end
11:15
so basically this fact is pretty much
11:17
just an excuse to talk about sereno
11:18
fines
11:19
who's done a lot of absolutely amazing
11:21
stuff that's great he
11:23
has gone up the nile on a hovercraft
11:25
yeah which is the first time someone did
11:27
that
11:27
his expedition the trans globe
11:28
expedition went around the world
11:31
but not horizontally uh vertically
11:33
leaving from greenwich
11:35
going through both polls and then back
11:36
to greenwich no one has done that before
11:38
no one's done it since then
11:39
which is amazing and then he after he
11:41
had a heart attack and a double heart
11:43
bypass operation four months later
11:45
he did seven marathons in seven days uh
11:47
on seven continents
11:49
such a show off yeah yeah he um just on
11:52
the badass nature of renault fines he
11:54
once off an expedition got frostbite on
11:55
his fingers
11:56
and he got it so bad that he needed to
11:58
have them amputated but when he took his
12:00
fingers and himself they're still
12:01
attached to a doctor
12:03
they said we need to wait for it a bit
12:04
longer for it to deaden before we can
12:06
amputate
12:07
and he lost his patients at home one day
12:09
so he went into his shed
12:10
he eventually took them off with a black
12:12
and decker vice and a fret saw
12:14
but he tried a number of other devices
12:16
beforehand different saws and it just
12:17
wasn't working
12:18
great product placement for the black
12:20
and decker yeah
12:22
yeah so he's done so he's quite fun
12:24
anyway he seems to be quite an
12:25
entertaining chap
12:26
so at one point when he was in the army
12:28
there was a ball i think and he
12:30
persuaded some of his fellow military
12:33
men to procure a lively squirming piglet
12:35
cover it in tank grease and slip it into
12:37
a crowded ballroom
12:38
which is quite fun but another fun thing
12:40
he did was he was wanting to get into
12:42
the sas
12:43
do you know about this so one of the
12:45
tests against the sas that he had to
12:46
perform was to plan
12:48
and try to execute a bank robbery and so
12:51
he was supposed to rob a branch of
12:53
barclays bank
12:54
and he went and he asked for a tour
12:56
around barclays bank
12:57
and based on that he went to a cafe
12:59
afterwards and made detailed plans of
13:01
the bank
13:01
and that evening the owner of that cafe
13:04
called the police and said a man who
13:07
looks like he's pretending to be in the
13:08
army has left here some very detailed
13:10
plans of the local bank
13:12
could you please get on this it was in
13:13
the headline of the times the next day
13:14
was
13:15
dodgy looking man leaves behind plans of
13:18
bank robbery
13:18
although i don't think he was rejected
13:20
from the sas for that he also
13:22
was almost james bond weirdly he
13:24
auditioned for james bond
13:26
cubby broccoli got him in and they
13:28
auditioned 400 people and he made it
13:30
down to the last six
13:32
oh okay yeah but then he got rejected
13:33
immediately by cubby broccoli cubby
13:35
brockley said
13:36
that he looked like a farmer whose hands
13:38
are too big and clumsy well his hands
13:40
aren't too big anymore
13:41
[Laughter]
13:44
that's in such bad taste lord lucan as
13:47
well
13:48
was asked to audition for jonathan yeah
13:51
yeah he didn't go to anybody wasn't he
13:54
he was quite famous did you not go to it
13:57
in africa he's doing quite a job of
13:59
going undercover
14:00
if this is part of his audition yeah i
14:02
would say he's done very well
14:04
um also because that's the one that
14:06
roger moore then became james bond for
14:08
and i was reading in craig brown's book
14:10
one to one that
14:12
george lazenby got the job of being
14:14
james bond by knowing that cubby
14:16
broccoli was going for a haircut in a
14:17
place and getting his haircut next to
14:19
him
14:19
and feigning ignorance about oh hi how
14:21
are you so yeah
14:23
uh martini like he was like right yeah
14:25
yeah i have always wondered how the hell
14:26
george lazenby got the job
14:28
so when reynold fines and lord lucan
14:30
were going for it they lost the job to
14:31
george lazenby no to roger moore oh okay
14:34
yeah all right that's fine why do you
14:35
think it's extraordinary that anyone
14:36
could have lost
14:38
me yeah is it the oldest guy to have
14:40
climbed everest do you know how old
14:42
they've been older ones haven't they
14:43
yeah so he's the oldest british guy oh
14:45
yeah
14:45
the oldest guy's japanese he was 80 when
14:48
he got up there
14:49
and he spent half an hour up there and
14:52
he he broke his own record he was the
14:54
oldest
14:54
previous it was his third trip up there
14:56
he went up there when he was 70.
14:58
and there was this big thing about two
15:00
days behind him in terms of trekking was
15:02
an 81 year old
15:03
so he was he was going to be able to
15:05
hold the record for two days
15:06
and then this 81 year old was like on
15:09
the way behind but he didn't make it
15:10
didn't make it he didn't die but he
15:12
didn't make it i think there's two of
15:13
them who keep beating each other's
15:15
record
15:15
aren't they yeah i think because the
15:17
last time this guy the japanese guy he's
15:19
called mira the last time he did it they
15:20
asked him
15:21
if the other guy beats you are you going
15:23
to try and do it again he said at this
15:25
point i could not think of anything but
15:26
rest
15:28
hmm it must have been knackered yeah
15:29
yeah that's that's reverse psychology
15:31
trying to convince the others
15:34
nope not for me
15:40
okay time to move on to our third fact
15:43
and that's cezinsky
15:45
my fact is that a ryanair crew member
15:47
recruited today
15:48
could not possibly be the same height as
15:51
a crew member from the first ryanair
15:53
cabin crew okay what does that mean
15:56
that so they do have um height
15:58
restrictions don't they
15:59
yeah they do so if you're recruited
16:00
today you have to be at least five foot
16:02
two
16:03
to be in the crew now in 1985 on the
16:06
first ryanair flight
16:08
uh you had to be under five foot two to
16:09
work on it
16:11
under five foot less than five pretty
16:12
sure it was small because
16:14
the planes were small it was because it
16:15
was a tiny cabin yeah
16:17
yeah so it was just crude tiny people
16:20
yeah yeah but then the
16:21
passengers i guess they just have to
16:24
crouch
16:25
well they're not you're not standing
16:26
throughout the whole flight oh i don't
16:27
know i don't know about the first ride
16:28
on their flights maybe you were
16:29
maybe no that's a future
16:32
um that's very cool but yes i think it's
16:35
quite weird that you need to be over a
16:36
certain night now i suppose you need to
16:37
reach up
16:38
some of them say you need to show that
16:40
you have have to have a certain reach
16:42
so you could be sharp with very long
16:43
arms yes
16:45
mr tickle i read that on
16:48
eva which is a airline uh their height
16:51
they do have a height restriction thing
16:53
as well but it's purely for aesthetic
16:54
purposes
16:55
i wouldn't be surprised if they had that
16:56
in the 70s but these days it seems a
16:59
little bit
17:00
well i found out about what it was like
17:01
in the 70s okay okay so this is during
17:04
pan am's
17:04
heyday uh you have to be as you say anna
17:07
at least five foot two
17:08
uh weigh no more than 130 pounds and
17:10
retire by the age of 32.
17:12
geez and you weren't allowed to be
17:14
married or have children and so most
17:16
women lasted about 18 months
17:18
because because they always bloody go
17:20
off and have kids don't they these women
17:21
and that's what we can't be relied on to
17:23
employ them
17:25
well the marriage restriction lasted
17:26
until the 1980s which is unbelievable
17:28
wow
17:29
you know the first uh budget airline was
17:31
in 1971 it was founded which is a long
17:33
time ago
17:34
but that one was outrageously sexist the
17:35
stewardesses had to have orange hot
17:37
pants and white gogo boots
17:41
before before they were dressed as that
17:44
though they used to dress as nurses
17:46
um and that's not some sort of weird
17:48
sexual fetish there were nurses that
17:50
weren't
17:50
yeah exactly in fact the first official
17:52
flight attendant was a nurse and a pilot
17:54
and she only became a flight attendant
17:55
because i didn't allow her to become
17:57
a pilot yeah
18:01
yeah yeah yeah did you read this article
18:03
in uh collectors weekly it's a really
18:05
really good website um
18:07
they have loads of great articles on
18:09
there and they did a thing about
18:10
um hostess uniforms and they talked
18:14
about ellen church and she was a
18:15
registered nurse
18:16
but the reason that they had registered
18:18
nurses is because
18:19
all the passengers were getting uh
18:21
nauseous and vomiting
18:22
because of the dc3 planes these
18:25
particular types of plane
18:26
that were just all over the place so
18:28
everyone would be sick and that's why
18:29
they
18:29
first brought in the female attendants
18:31
because they needed nurses
18:33
wow wow to hold out sick bags yeah
18:35
apparently all right
18:36
she by the way wasn't the first ever
18:38
flight attendant oh she wasn't no she
18:40
wasn't and it's
18:40
first female one she's the first female
18:42
but the first ever proper flight
18:44
attendant was a german guy
18:45
called heinrich kubis and he was flying
18:48
with the red baron and
18:51
tiny peanuts he was on all the um
18:55
all the zeppelins prior to planes but he
18:57
was the flight attendants
18:58
and and he very much cared about his job
19:01
to the extent that he would wear hot
19:03
pants and go go
19:04
yes exactly yeah um but he also so he
19:07
was on
19:08
he was on a number of famous zeppelins
19:09
the most famous of all he was on was the
19:11
hindenburg and he was the one who
19:12
basically noticed that it was on fire
19:15
and uh helped all the passengers to get
19:17
off it
19:18
and uh he was a very he was very
19:20
actually a lot of people
19:21
survived the hindenburg yeah yeah a lot
19:25
of them jumped from about 15 feet in the
19:27
air and then he was on the edge and he
19:28
went all right everyone go
19:29
and so he gave the go ahead the
19:31
hindenburg was almost called the hitler
19:33
it was originally gonna be called the
19:34
hitler wow
19:35
yeah um i didn't know that that pole on
19:37
the top of the empire state building was
19:39
actually to doc
19:40
zeppelin's yeah it was a zeppelin docker
19:43
yeah that's so cool
19:44
very exciting just to go back to ellen
19:45
church for a second the first
19:47
uh female stewardess so um they were
19:49
called sky
19:50
girls originally the the sky girls were
19:52
expected to
19:54
i'm quoting here haul luggage screw down
19:56
loose seats
19:57
help with fueling the plane and finally
19:59
at day's end
20:00
help the pilots push the plane into the
20:02
hangar
20:05
how good is that uh the first passenger
20:07
flight
20:08
it was one guy and it was from some
20:11
petersburg in florida to
20:12
tampa and it lasted 23 minutes and the
20:15
flight
20:16
rarely exceeded five feet in altitude
20:22
that's really interesting it's like we
20:24
are now cruising that's
20:25
five feet if you look to the left you'll
20:27
see a man
20:30
here's some chewing gum for you to
20:31
choose no your ears don't pop
20:34
crazy wait give us more details on this
20:37
this is amazing
20:38
well i know it was it was called a
20:39
flying boat i think because that was the
20:42
only terms in which they could just
20:43
know because they had planes but they
20:44
called it a sky boat oh
20:47
wow well it was the first guy paid four
20:48
hundred dollars which was about
20:50
uh nine thousand dollars today but then
20:52
the prices came right down after that
20:54
and basically it carried a maybe 1200
20:56
passengers over the next few months
20:58
and they paid at five dollars five
21:00
dollars special
21:02
thing it was the former mayor of the
21:03
town who got to go on this journey
21:05
and where did he have to pay more to be
21:07
the one who's trying it out
21:09
no and also 400 down to five that's
21:12
quite
21:13
yeah he was kicking himself
21:26
um other things that have been taken on
21:29
planes or attempted to take on planes a
21:30
two-month-old tiger cub was recently a
21:32
woman recently attempted to smuggle it
21:34
by disguising it as a stuffed toy
21:35
amongst other fake tiger cubs
21:37
oh that is clever it is clever that's
21:38
what he does when he tries to hide among
21:41
the other teams he puts all the
21:42
yeah that's true but he sticks his face
21:44
out oh yeah yeah yeah
21:45
we're as a more sensible alien would
21:47
have just hidden behind him
21:49
why did he need to do that why did he i
21:51
was pushing a bit of a show off
21:53
the show and then there was the last one
21:55
which i did put on twitter yesterday
21:56
which was woody's toy gun
21:58
was confiscated from him recently at
21:59
heathrow and there's the guy who was
22:01
conversated from took a picture and the
22:03
guy is literally removing this tiny toy
22:05
gun
22:05
from woody the cowboy
22:08
the cowboy and it wasn't like a it's not
22:11
like
22:12
a gun a life size yeah it's it's like a
22:14
tiny little
22:15
it was a tiny woody and they just put an
22:16
ak-47
22:19
what it's a toy don't be ridiculous
22:23
um that's there was a guy who was on
22:24
ground staff this guy
22:26
said here are some of the conversations
22:27
i overheard there was a lady who tried
22:29
to bring her goldfish
22:30
on board and so she had it in a bag with
22:33
water in it and they said
22:34
okay what we've worked out is we can
22:36
allow the goldfish to go on
22:37
but we can't allow the water yeah so
22:40
they did a lot of water the other one
22:41
was
22:41
they so the goldfish had to live in a
22:44
little 25 milliliter
22:46
yeah exactly yeah but you can buy liquid
22:48
once you've gone through security
22:49
so could you hold it in your hand and
22:51
buy a bottle of water yeah yeah
22:52
drop it in your evie yeah um and the
22:54
other one was they had an argument about
22:56
what state mashed potato is so they
22:59
couldn't decide if it was a liquid
23:02
or uh yeah they didn't know what it was
23:03
and so they eventually decided that it
23:04
was a gel
23:05
um and that you'd
23:10
um i've got two other things on height
23:12
restriction uh one is astronauts have
23:14
height restrictions as well but there
23:16
was famously there was one astronaut who
23:18
was a great astronaut called scott
23:20
parazynski
23:21
he was not allowed to do a mission
23:22
because of his height restriction
23:24
interesting thing about him though
23:25
just in relevance to this was he really
23:27
tall or really smart he was really tall
23:29
okay um he's the only astronaut ever to
23:31
have gone into space and also to reach
23:34
the summit of mount everest
23:35
oh wow just as an interesting connection
23:37
did he land on the summit of mount
23:38
everest when he got back
23:41
did he go up everest and go no i want to
23:43
go higher than this yeah
23:45
almost there now yeah might as well
23:47
carry on i've just read that i'm on i'm
23:49
on this astronaut scott uh parazynski's
23:52
uh wikipedia page and it's got a list of
23:54
awards and honors and he was the
23:56
honorary captain for the us
23:58
luge team for the 2010 winter olympics
24:00
what do you mean honorary captain
24:01
i don't know it's just they made him an
24:03
honorary place to be the honorary
24:04
captain of the
24:05
olympic team yeah i wonder if he got a
24:07
medal if they won
24:08
oh yeah he could say he would you get an
24:10
honorary medal yeah you stand on an
24:12
honorary podium which is
24:13
next to the main podium doesn't matter
24:20
it is weird that the word honorary just
24:22
means not yeah
24:23
in life basically there's restrictions
24:26
on heights of sand castles on certain
24:28
german beaches
24:29
uh they can't be above three meters
24:31
there's some three meters yeah which is
24:33
huge
24:34
i'm not surprised that you can't be
24:35
about three meters yes that's not
24:37
building a sand castle
24:38
building it's earthworks yeah are you
24:41
signing permission for that
24:42
there's at least one beach in germany
24:44
where um
24:45
they knock down the sandcastles at the
24:47
end of every day so that people don't
24:49
trip over them in the dark that's funny
24:51
yeah yeah yeah seriously three meters i
24:53
know that's what are the crazy rules of
24:54
the germans i've got not allowed to
24:55
build a massive house on the beach
24:58
not allowed to drive more
25:04
[Applause]
25:04
[Music]
25:06
okay time for a final fact and that's my
25:09
fact
25:09
this week my fact is uh according to his
25:12
website steven seagal
25:14
is the only private citizen to destroy a
25:16
nuclear device
25:18
steven seagal the uh action hero uh i
25:21
found this on his website
25:22
okay sorry stephen tagalog has steven
25:24
seagal has dismantled according to his
25:26
website it's in his uh philanthropy
25:28
section of his website it's a
25:31
philanthropic act yeah it is definitely
25:33
yeah
25:33
i don't so uh looking into it uh he's
25:36
tricked us a bit
25:36
okay uh he didn't physically with his
25:39
hands dismantle
25:40
his mouth yeah yeah he used his ponytail
25:44
uh he uh he sponsored people to
25:46
dismantle so he
25:47
he gave the money to be able to do it
25:50
it's really funny will you
25:51
stephen segal turning up at your door
25:52
will you sponsor me
25:56
if you give me 50p per mega ton
26:00
that's great so he paid for it to be
26:02
decommissioned basically yes yeah
26:04
he was one of the people he's an
26:05
interesting character he does he's a
26:07
he's a bit of a lone wolf
26:08
old cigars really yeah well he you know
26:11
he's a lone wolf
26:12
lonewolf is someone who just says i'm
26:13
not a part of any kind of like he
26:15
doesn't do cinema really anymore
26:17
he goes he's straight to dvds don't
26:19
think that's out of choice is it
26:23
on principle i am a straight to video
26:25
man that's a good fight
26:27
very good point uh he might be in the
26:29
new expendables movie uh so
26:31
yeah all right so he sacrificed his
26:33
strong principles for that
26:36
my favorite things about seagal i'll
26:37
just give a quick breakdown he's a
26:39
musician as well i found that out in the
26:40
music section of his uh
26:42
what is his website did he want to pay
26:43
someone to play music
26:47
he's got two albums one is called mojo
26:50
priest and the others called songs from
26:51
the crystal cave
26:53
wow yeah i think it's mojo priest that
26:55
has 19 tracks on it because
26:57
he's got a lot to give and uh one of the
27:00
songs
27:01
is called talk to my ass
27:04
[ __ ] puncher blues is another one is
27:07
that carcass in
27:08
[ __ ] fighting i don't know like he
27:10
doesn't like [ __ ] fighting
27:12
because he's an animal rights activist
27:13
isn't he well he is a sheriff he's a
27:15
sheriff we think we've
27:16
actually voted for that yeah you can i
27:18
think we mentioned before that he was a
27:20
sheriff haven't we yes
27:21
but one of the things that he did as a
27:23
sheriff was break up a [ __ ] fighting
27:25
ring
27:25
in america wow and he used a full swat
27:28
team
27:29
a bomb detecting robot and a bevy of
27:31
armored vehicles
27:32
including the fully fledged tank he was
27:34
in the tank wasn't he yeah yeah um
27:36
115 birds were euthanized on the spot
27:39
and thousands of dollars of damage were
27:41
done
27:41
to this guy called jesus levira
27:44
lots of damage done to his property
27:46
including damage caused by the tank
27:48
knocking over his walls
27:50
it's a bit overkill isn't it 115 birds
27:52
were euthanized on the spot surely part
27:54
of
27:54
breaking up a [ __ ] fighting ring is to
27:55
prevent cruelty to animals yeah
27:57
let's just go in all guns blazing will
27:59
you never fight
28:02
you've missed the best bit of the story
28:03
god he got the wrong house
28:06
yeah it wasn't the right house yeah he
28:08
uh it was
28:09
he slaughtered all these animals
28:11
including well it was just another house
28:14
he was a who's just breeding them and um
28:17
not only did the chickens
28:18
uh the cockroaches die um so did the
28:20
owner's dog
28:22
and steven seagal had to write an
28:23
apology letter to the kid
28:26
because he killed his dog good yeah yeah
28:29
that's appropriate
28:30
yeah yeah they needlessly disposed of a
28:32
lot of bombs which the family just
28:33
harmlessly had
28:36
they were just breeding the bums take a
28:38
bomb disposal robot into a [ __ ] fighting
28:39
ring why would you
28:40
drive a tank through the house steven
28:43
seagal that's what he does
28:44
in 1940 they had new golf rules um to do
28:48
with the war in certain clubs in
28:49
england and one of them was a player
28:52
whose stroke is affected by the
28:53
simultaneous explosion of a bomb
28:56
may play another ball from the same
28:57
place penalty
28:59
one stroke wow i think as a golfer i
29:02
think that's quite harsh
29:04
like it's not your fault yeah but you've
29:06
got to be very focused james and i think
29:08
it shows you're not taking it seriously
29:09
enough you're distracted by every bomb
29:11
that goes off yeah
29:12
that's a good point yeah i do get
29:13
distracted on the golf course um
29:15
you like conspiracy theories dan i have
29:17
one yeah so in
29:18
the 1950s and 60s there was some nuclear
29:20
testing in space until that was banned
29:22
by the un
29:23
but in the un document that forbade it
29:25
it said the reason we have to ban
29:26
nuclear testing in space is because it
29:28
could destroy
29:29
exotic weapons and other military
29:31
satellites so i want to know
29:33
what exotic weapons are hovering around
29:37
our world right now what does that mean
29:39
exotic weapons pineapple
29:41
pineapple problems
29:42
[Laughter]
29:44
just to clarify for listeners i like
29:47
conspiracy theories i don't believe in
29:48
them
29:50
that's you declare you say that every
29:51
week and every week we cut
29:56
on construction sites in germany they
29:57
still often call bomb disposal units um
29:59
before they
30:00
do much construction because there are
30:02
plenty of unexploded bombs
30:03
in germany i think someone was killed
30:04
earlier on this year a man was killed
30:06
when a bomb
30:07
from world war ii exploded there were
30:08
more than a billion shells in northern
30:10
europe
30:11
um that were given yeah that were sent
30:14
over there by the allies
30:15
and 30 of them failed to explode
30:18
and the main belgian group that get rid
30:21
of it are called
30:22
dovo and they recover between 150 and
30:24
200 tons of
30:26
um stuff every year wow well good night
30:30
anyone want about bruce willis that's
30:32
who i researched because i didn't know
30:33
who stephen cigar is
30:34
oh sure yeah um so
30:37
you know he was on friends bruce willis
30:39
yeah i didn't know that no
30:41
oh god guys played gunter oh god guys
30:44
you've got 10 very successful seasons
30:47
that's great
30:49
yeah everyone listening is gonna know
30:50
this so he played rachel's boyfriend and
30:52
the dad of ross's girlfriend
30:53
anyway he did it for no fee he was in
30:55
about three episodes i think and he lost
30:57
a bet to matthew perry and so he didn't
30:58
get paid for it
30:59
because he lost a bet whole nine yards
31:01
when they were in the whole nine yards
31:03
where yeah matthew perry was like this
31:04
film is gonna be good i thought it's
31:06
gonna go to the top of the film charts
31:07
and uh it did go to the top of the movie
31:09
charts when it opened
31:10
is that how friends worked basically
31:12
they got people in and then did wages
31:14
with them for the first four seasons
31:16
phoebe was paid in pineapples
31:19
it really showed interacting
31:23
um nothing of bruce willis he owns he
31:25
says the most expensive thing he's ever
31:26
bought is a ski mountain in idaho
31:29
that's the kind of thing you say to
31:30
someone after you've just bought
31:31
something really expensive and you want
31:32
to show off you say oh what's the most
31:34
expensive thing you own and then you
31:35
hope they ask you back yeah exactly
31:37
he probably goes around to parties all
31:39
the time saying that so what's the most
31:41
expensive
31:42
that sofa looks expensive is it the most
31:44
expensive thing that you own
31:46
he actually this makes him even even
31:49
more vomit inducing
31:50
he said to the guardian journalist who
31:52
asked him i don't tell many people this
31:54
but it's a mountain in idaho obviously
31:56
saying it to a guardian journalist who's
31:58
printing it
31:59
actually given the circulation of the
32:00
gun
32:02
keep this under your hat only publish it
32:04
in your newspaper
32:08
[Laughter]
32:10
bruce willis as well um i seem to
32:12
remember that he
32:14
when they were looking for osama bin
32:15
laden said i will give a million dollars
32:18
if you find he put a bounty on his head
32:20
basically yeah that's really so that
32:22
when he goes to parties he could say
32:23
what's the most expensive thing you've
32:25
bought oh i bought osama bin laden
32:32
another thing about bruce willis is that
32:33
he lost two-thirds of the hearing in his
32:35
left ear when on die hard because the
32:36
director said that they had to use extra
32:38
loud blanks
32:39
and now apparently his daughter claims
32:41
this is why he gets accused of being
32:42
rude and interviews is because his
32:43
hearing isn't very good so he ignores
32:45
people a lot
32:46
what's the justification for him telling
32:48
people he's bought a mountain
32:50
what was that you said what's the most
32:52
expensive thing i've ever heard about
32:54
nobody
32:57
[Laughter]
33:00

[Music]
00:19
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:22
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:24
this time coming to you from the turtle
00:26
comedy book festival in camden london uh
00:29
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
00:31
here with andy murray anna chazinski and
00:33
james harkin and this week all of our
00:35
facts are coming from the new qi book
00:37
1411 qi facts to knock you sideways so
00:41
here are the four facts that we entered
00:42
into that book and in no particular
00:44
order here they are fact number one
00:46
james
00:47
so my fact this week is
00:50
viking names included desirous of beer
00:54
squat wiggle
00:56
lust hostage
00:58
short penis
01:01
able to fill a bay with fish by magic
01:05
the man who mixes his drinks
01:08
and the man without trousers
01:12
but so
01:13
okay when you say that these are viking
01:16
names were they were they're like were
01:18
there more than two sometimes in a in a
01:20
ship was it like did you have to be like
01:21
do we have a surname here because we've
01:22
got two short penises on the boat
01:26
uh i don't know about that they did
01:28
there's a great long list of them these
01:29
comes from names of people actually from
01:31
the sagas uh from the icelandic sagas
01:34
and the norwegian sagas and these are
01:36
the kind of nicknames rather than actual
01:39
first names i think did you find out
01:40
anything about the specific like a squat
01:43
wiggle do we know what that is
01:46
what is it some kind of
01:48
what it is well i can i don't i assume
01:50
the person who was called it did it
01:53
right and wiggle yeah
01:55
yeah
01:59
you do on the dance floor where you like
02:00
go down to the floor and then up again
02:02
that i do on the dance floor yeah or in
02:04
the office sometimes we all find it a
02:06
bit weird i think it's what like when a
02:08
dog wipes its bum on the ground on the
02:10
carpet you know it does that yeah little
02:12
squat wiggle you know how native
02:13
americans name their children after the
02:15
first thing they see after they give
02:16
birth do they yeah do you think squat
02:18
wiggles parents saw this dog doing the
02:20
thing on the floor
02:22
wait what
02:23
really yeah that's the idea
02:25
i
02:26
always thought that was a myth as well
02:27
yeah i'm sure it's a myth so someone
02:30
gave birth next to a sitting bull and
02:32
that's how yeah yeah
02:33
oh jumping badger oh is that literally
02:36
what it was well that's the idea i don't
02:38
know if it's really i think some i think
02:39
it depends what um what uh kind of
02:42
american what tribe you are from some of
02:43
them named their children uh i think the
02:47
miwok tribe name their kids after how
02:48
this nearest stream looked when they
02:50
gave birth oh really yeah really
02:53
probably a limited number of yeah yeah
02:55
you've got to be very immature with your
02:56
adjectives
02:58
yeah
02:59
where muddy
03:01
is that where the band got the name
03:10
short penis and the man without trousers
03:11
were friends with each other
03:14
i hope one named the
03:16
other i found out a few more of them
03:19
they're all from um the land nam mabok
03:23
which is a medieval work about uh when
03:25
the north went to iceland and settled it
03:27
and so there's a load of it's a bit like
03:29
a doomsday book there are loads of
03:30
records of people and where they live
03:31
and all of this a few more of them same
03:33
name same source
03:35
harm fart
03:36
[Music]
03:40
arsene victim
03:43
that was the name arsene victim um a
03:46
person in trouble or in disgrace but i
03:48
think that's inaccurately transcribed
03:50
and able to remain warm in winter
03:54
that sounds like a euphemism of fat
03:56
doesn't it
04:00
able to remain warm in winter
04:02
one of my favorite ones is king ragnar
04:04
hairy britches we might have mentioned
04:05
him on qi actually yeah a few people
04:07
know him uh he got his name because his
04:10
wife made him hairy trousers from animal
04:12
skins and they were supposed to protect
04:14
him in battle
04:15
for magic trousers
04:18
yeah magic triangles did they work
04:19
did they well
04:24
i like that you know that situation when
04:26
you're in a room and someone comes up to
04:28
you you blatantly know and you've
04:29
forgotten their name oh yeah i'd love to
04:31
see that scene in viking times that
04:33
would be amazing short penis
04:37
ugly aerospace big notes
04:41
you look like a [ __ ] i'm sorry
04:44
you're right
04:45
maybe they were more catchy and north
04:47
did you yeah they're quite long-winded
04:49
aren't they yeah that's actually a name
04:51
of a person
04:53
long-winded
05:04
yeah and it's because
05:06
um there's an inventor of weapons from
05:08
the tower of london which is in 1330 and
05:10
there was a ballista a big projectile
05:12
device which was called lady ganilda so
05:15
again gun hill there went war or battle
05:16
so that's where so even though they
05:18
weren't really around at the time were
05:20
they guns no no no yeah
05:23
vikings i've just had a moment of crisis
05:25
of confidence about when they when did
05:26
you say
05:27
uh 13th century yeah yeah you're fine
05:31
something else invented by the vikings
05:33
or from that area this is one for you
05:35
anna sarcasm
05:36
well thanks james
05:39
yeah great you like that um really good
05:42
the words or the concepts no the
05:43
concepts according to clans gruber the
05:46
danish ambassador whose name also sounds
05:48
made up um he says that the danish and
05:50
the uh british have a similar sense of
05:52
humor with our sarcasm and the way that
05:54
we make jokes and so he reasons that it
05:56
must have come over with the vikings
05:58
okay do you say khan's gruber
06:01
no
06:01
klaus gruber class grouper sorry i
06:03
thought it sounded like han's group with
06:05
a baddie in die hard
06:09
one for the die hard fans
06:13
does his name have a good meaning in
06:15
english do we know like makes up
06:16
questionable theories
06:20
we get quite a lot of a surprising
06:21
number of words from from uh the vikings
06:23
don't we and they're all quite negative
06:25
which might be
06:27
like pillage
06:28
like village and um hell i think and
06:30
weak skull slaughter anger dirt freckles
06:34
it might be that i've gone through them
06:35
and chosen the most negative ones
06:38
purpose is my point muggy
06:40
muggy is that negative i guess so
06:42
it's never a good thing is it no
06:45
come on you've got to come outside it's
06:46
so muggy
06:50
feeling too dry so what about berserk
06:52
that's something to do with bears is it
06:53
or uh so berserk the berserkers were the
06:56
uh viking warriors who were just insane
06:59
weren't they and they think that either
07:00
they worked themselves up into some kind
07:02
of meditative trance because they were
07:04
so like force themselves to be so angry
07:06
that they became vicious warriors or
07:08
they were just on drugs anyway they were
07:09
called berserkers which is where we get
07:11
the word berserk
07:12
yeah and there's one theory that
07:14
actually vikings weren't worse than
07:16
anyone else but the only reason that we
07:18
have only bad stories about them is
07:20
because they attacked monks who are much
07:21
more literate than them and so the monks
07:23
were the people who were writing things
07:24
down and they wouldn't write anything
07:26
better
07:26
that's a that's a proper theory
07:28
yeah great i'm not an equivalent it's
07:30
like writing something rude about mark
07:31
zuckerberg a few hundred years from now
07:34
your name will be mud
07:38
that's very cool uh i so i mean what i
07:40
love about this obviously is we're
07:42
talking about silly names um and i had a
07:44
fact to just tell you guys i had a fact
07:46
that i tried to use on a previous
07:48
podcast which got rejected in the office
07:51
uh which was that forty percent of all
07:53
penises are in america
07:55
uh and it's the surname
07:58
it's the surname penises you can go on
08:00
our website and it tells you where they
08:01
all are forty percent in america fiverr
08:03
and britain uh the most popular name
08:06
shot
08:09
there must be there must be someone
08:11
whose name is shorty penis
08:13
well there was one guy called penis
08:14
penis penis
08:17
actually that was a that was a popular
08:18
name because it was in there it was no
08:20
it wasn't a popular name that's a
08:21
computer error that cannot be
08:24
no one was it hyphenated it was uh no no
08:27
it's just pure just people so you think
08:29
of two penises
08:33
penis penis was also a very popular name
08:35
next to penis penis people so it's a
08:36
double barrel name obviously so this
08:38
surely must be people filling in online
08:40
forms with rude words
08:42
i don't know the most popular is bob
08:44
penis so i don't know
08:45
[Music]
08:48
it's just an actual name they didn't let
08:50
me do it on the show so not gonna get in
08:52
this week either
08:55
did you guys be speaking of stupid names
08:57
and kind of um vikings that there's a
08:59
swedish couple who are being fined
09:02
because they failed to register a
09:04
legally approved name for their child
09:05
and
09:06
they've presently called their child um
09:08
i don't know how to pronounce this it's
09:10
brook
09:14
11116 and apparently
09:19
fahrenheit is pronounced al bin but it's
09:22
a series of consonants and so they were
09:24
told they weren't allowed to register
09:25
that as a name for their child and so
09:27
they said they were willing to change
09:28
the child's name to a the letter a which
09:31
also wasn't accepted um and so they've
09:34
been fined but yeah the explanation was
09:36
that the naming of their child uh as
09:38
such was a pregnant expressionistic
09:40
development that we see as an artistic
09:42
creation
09:43
[Music]
09:45
that's not really going to cut it when
09:46
he's being bullied in school
09:48
did you see today uh there was there was
09:50
a article in the paper today and i can't
09:52
so maybe someone here will remember it
09:54
uh the number one hacker
09:57
internet hacker in the world um they
09:59
managed to crack his code and get into
10:01
all the places he's been hacking because
10:03
his personal password was his cat's name
10:06
with one two three at the end
10:10
i was just in the news the worst thing
10:12
was his cat was called password
10:20
uh wayne rooney had his um his computer
10:23
hacked and his password was stella
10:25
[Music]
10:28
you're not helping yourself when you're
10:29
him with the stereotypes are you no
10:31
doing that
10:33
other beers are available
10:36
um interesting naming traditions so the
10:39
amazonian amanda tribe when you say you
10:42
get your name at birth and then when
10:44
your younger sibling is born you have to
10:45
give your name to that sibling and take
10:48
on another name and you have to
10:49
constantly change change your name
10:51
throughout your life and that's the
10:52
tribe that doesn't have a concept of
10:54
time so they're really interesting
10:54
because they don't have any words for
10:56
like day week month and so the only way
10:58
they distinguish time is by like the
11:01
stage of life that you're at so you get
11:03
a new name for whatever stage of life
11:04
you're at so if you graduate you're
11:05
called like history degree
11:08
i don't know how many history degrees
11:09
they're getting but um
11:11
wait do you have to change your name
11:13
until your parents have their last child
11:16
uh i'm understanding that right so
11:18
yes you do as soon as one of the family
11:19
changes the name often the rest of the
11:21
family also has to change your name
11:22
so even if you were 30 and your parents
11:25
had another child all right that's not
11:27
likely
11:29
you could change your name sort of 10 20
11:31
years later i guess sharp penis must be
11:33
really hoping that his parents had a
11:34
good time
11:37
come on guys
11:39
we're not going to do it son you
11:40
inherited your father's traits i'm not
11:42
going there again
11:46
um
11:47
yeah my my favorite pop star name change
11:50
i've done a few in the podcast so i
11:52
can't say it out loud now but uh what i
11:54
discovered recently michael bolton
11:56
that's not his real name michael
11:57
bolton's what real name is not michael
11:59
bolton what is it it is michael bolatin
12:03
he lost an o from a single o and he lost
12:06
it and there's another singer called
12:08
michael bolton who's a country singer in
12:10
america who they keep asking him like
12:12
obviously you're trying to make a career
12:14
in music and you're called michael
12:15
bolton why have you not changed your
12:17
name and his answer was why should i
12:19
change it he's the one who sucks
12:23
very strong principles it's not going to
12:24
work in the sales but yeah yeah yeah
12:27
it is a better name i found a thing
12:28
about viking mice
12:30
what i'm just
12:32
right well bear with me um no
12:35
there are there is such a thing as
12:36
viking mice so all the mice in um
12:40
scotland and ireland and bits of whales
12:42
are viking ones because they're directly
12:44
descended from norwegian house mice and
12:47
they came over with the vikings and they
12:50
were much more effective than the weak
12:52
the weedy anglo-saxon mice
12:56
and they know that's how they they think
12:58
they know that um the vikings lived in
13:00
scotland and ireland first in enough
13:02
density to support house mice because
13:04
the house might only live somewhere
13:06
where the either you get quite a dense
13:07
concentration of people so that's how
13:09
they know that the vikings were hardy
13:11
enough to live there is because their
13:12
mice went there with them and they lived
13:14
there in enough numbers to support them
13:16
this is amazing yeah
13:18
um vikings are quite cool so they have a
13:20
god of skiing
13:23
in fact they have a god and a goddess of
13:25
skiing they have the god of skin who is
13:27
uh you double l r um always pictured
13:29
with skis and a bow and arrow and then
13:32
the
13:36
hey are you going out on the slopes
13:37
don't forget your bow and arrow
13:43
um
13:43
yeah goddess scardy um not they did they
13:46
were in a relationship or anything but
13:48
yeah she was the same always on skis
13:49
always bow and arrow and she married um
13:54
another god called njord and they split
13:56
up because they had a bitter fight about
13:58
the fact that he loved the coast and she
14:00
loved the mountains and skiing so that's
14:02
in north mythology and scada is where
14:04
the word scandinavia comes from
14:07
her name goddess of skiing that's cool
14:09
so the vikings had uh quite a cool way
14:11
of making fire um fire that could last a
14:14
long time where they can they collected
14:16
fungus called touch wood from um trees
14:20
and then they would like bash it down
14:22
and then they lit it oh then they boiled
14:24
it in water for a few days and then they
14:26
lit it and instead of catching fire
14:28
properly it just kind of um
14:30
what's it called kind of um smoldered
14:33
and then it would last a few days and it
14:35
would be you know a useful fire they
14:37
could take on ships and stuff wow
14:39
i was reading today that um fire is a
14:41
problem on antarctica apparently because
14:44
you wouldn't think it would you because
14:45
it's cold
14:46
is that what's melting at all no because
14:48
it's so dry and and like a lot of wind
14:50
which can blow the fire somewhere so if
14:52
you yeah it's one of the things i'm most
14:54
worried about on antarctica is fire they
14:56
have a fire department how does this
14:57
there's a fire brigade
15:00
really yeah yeah antarctic fire
15:02
department because they're a bit because
15:04
the driest place in the world is in
15:05
antarctica isn't it it is there are
15:06
these valleys
15:08
dry valleys never get any haven't had
15:09
any rain for two million years and even
15:12
then it wasn't much they're muggy
15:17
we need to move on guys
15:19
think about any last things you want to
15:21
get in um i just have one more thing
15:23
about a different type of vikings it's a
15:25
bit sad the minnesota vikings i'm an
15:27
american football fan
15:29
and there was a minnesota vikings fan
15:31
who vowed to let his beard grow until
15:33
his team won the super bowl and he died
15:36
in 2013 with a 38 year old beard
15:42
so sad we salute him yeah what a dude
15:45
amazing um i found one last fact that i
15:47
want to add which is from uh we're at
15:50
the book festival it's from our new qi
15:52
book uh this is the fact and it's to do
15:55
just with with names johnny cash's
15:58
estate once refused permission for his
16:00
hit ring of fire to be used in a
16:02
commercial for hemorrhoid cream
16:06
just wonderful good decision um should
16:08
we move on to facts
16:10
okay time for fact number two uh that's
16:13
my fact uh and as we said at the top uh
16:16
all of our facts come from this new book
16:17
that we've done there's 1 411 facts in
16:20
this book i after much
16:23
much work only managed to get one fact
16:27
into this book
16:31
wait till you hear it
16:34
this is my fact
16:36
and it concerns the model jordan uh
16:41
otherwise known as katie price why why
16:43
did you only get one in
16:46
they were all about jordan
16:48
or 900
16:52
uh so my fact this week is you only live
16:55
once is katie price's fourth
16:57
autobiography
17:05
and that's on page three hundred and
17:07
thirty four seventy one should be on
17:08
page three shouldn't it really
17:10
oh yeah
17:13
is there any sign in it that she's aware
17:14
of the irony of it like is it a humorous
17:17
ironic comment on modern day celebrity
17:19
autobiographies that she's making of
17:21
course there is it's katie price yeah
17:23
yeah have you read it uh no
17:27
no in fact i'm pretty sure she hasn't
17:29
because she was promoting her new
17:31
autobiography her fifth autobiography uh
17:34
and they asked her where does it pick up
17:36
from and she said it picks up from the
17:37
amazing ending of my last book which i
17:40
think was about when i broke up no i
17:42
stopped reading it there i was like you
17:43
cannot say where i think about your own
17:45
life in a book
17:47
like that's unacceptable but that's yeah
17:50
i just love it you don't get hillary
17:51
mantel going i think was cromwell was he
17:54
dead yet
17:56
i'm not sure what happened to winston
17:58
smith anyways
18:00
um katie price has written more books
18:02
than shakespeare wrote plays
18:04
well shakespeare didn't write any plays
18:06
really yeah you're right
18:08
katie price hasn't written anybody
18:12
they would get along like a house on
18:13
fire but she's admitted it she has
18:15
admitted it she had a quote when she was
18:16
talking about her book she said i'm not
18:18
gonna lie i don't sit there with a
18:19
typewriter and write it so this is
18:21
someone who still thinks you write a
18:22
book with a typewriter
18:26

18:27
i we don't do that on this show i don't
18:29

18:34
because you said knocker
18:36
[Music]
18:39
yeah
18:40
so uh this is this is another thing that

18:46
interesting thing it actually has gone
18:47
on out on the latest qi book uh sorry no
18:50

18:52
about katie price which has actually
18:53
outsold
18:54
all of the booker list didn't she at one
18:57
point yeah yeah i mean so she sells
18:59
massive which is insane but all of them
19:01
are ghostwritten she's admitted that
19:02
they're ghost written and ghost riding
19:04
is just ginormous now ghost writing is
19:06
so big at the moment this is insane
19:08
they've started outsourcing it to other
19:10
countries so they go to the philippines
19:12
for ghost writing now celebrity
19:14
autobiographies get sent to the
19:15
philippines and they have people that
19:17
just cannot be true are they good at
19:18
writing ghostwriting in the philippines
19:20
yeah why not quite a lot of people admit
19:22
to not reading their autobiographies
19:23
don't they
19:23
[Music]
19:25
as well
19:25
ronald reagan yeah what did he say oh he
19:28

19:31
looking forward to reading this book and
19:32
so on so am i
19:34
cool i hear it's very good i can't wait
19:35
to read it yeah naomi campbell models
19:37
obviously don't like to like to read
19:39
their own autobiographies no and barry
19:41
manilow didn't write the song i write
19:43
the songs
19:46
it's another environment it's true
19:47
that's an actual fact
19:50
um the first ever autobiography was
19:51
ghost written
19:52
well it was the first ever autobiography
19:55
was the bible
19:59
i don't know jesus i don't think you
20:01
mentioned a ghost it was
20:03
it was holy ghost written it goes
20:05
written
20:07
that's what the holy ghost was for what
20:08
purpose do you think it's her
20:10
nobody knows the other two are so
20:12
obvious in their roles he's from the
20:14
philippines no one knows him
20:19
no the first autobiography in english
20:20
was written by someone called
20:22
marjorie kemp um and it was written in
20:24
the 1400s and she was an illiterate
20:27
woman who wrote the whole thing in the
20:28
third person and so she read it have you
20:30
have you yeah what i did an english
20:32
degree and they make you read a lot of
20:33
what
20:36
um yeah it's not very good oh it's
20:39
really it's really not there's no
20:41
there's no i'm not here to knock
20:42
margarita we don't do that on this
20:43
podcast
20:45
it's she spends maybe three or four
20:47
hundred pages crying and and weeping
20:51
all the words are smudged
20:53
i can't read this yeah it's very hard
20:55
going it's really with her because she
20:57
imagines herself uh married to jesus and
21:00
and lying in bed there with him and it's
21:01
a very strange text in lots of different
21:03
ways yeah yeah that's not funny it's
21:05
just it's just true was she
21:07
she was from lancashire wasn't she i
21:09
think she was my neck in the woods yeah
21:10
yeah is she like a wise woman or
21:12
something yeah she was like a prophetess
21:14
so yeah yeah who had a religious
21:16
awakening it's very interesting but at
21:17
the same time it's also quite boring
21:20
a surprising amount of people used to do
21:22
ghost writing so mozart used to do ghost
21:25
writing really yeah he'd write he would
21:26
be commissioned by other people they'd
21:28
put their names to it mozart would then
21:30
provide the music for it yeah uh charles
21:32
dickens's very first book uh it was a
21:34
book that he ghost wrote for a clown
21:37
called grimaldi
21:38
just um going back to mozart when he
21:41
first played in europe he was very young
21:43
like nine years old or something and
21:44
everyone thought he was a dwarf in
21:46
disguise
21:48
that's true really yeah it was written
21:50
that they thought he was
21:52
because
21:57
what you're going to say is if you're
21:58
going to disguise a dwarf you don't make
21:59
it the same height
22:03
yeah that is a good point yeah that's
22:04
true that is true
22:05
how do you make them tall you can't
22:07
stretch a person as part of a disguise
22:09
stilts
22:12
although i'll put him put him far away
22:14
on a hill so no one can tell
22:17
with a small piano right
22:20
um
22:21
started as a stilt
22:23
walker as a dwarf
22:27
he's just stretched him on the rack for
22:29
20 years someone who does stretch his
22:30
body is superman remember that yes
22:33
that's true yeah
22:34
so as part of superman's disguise he
22:36
puts on his glasses but he can also make
22:38
his um spine two inches smaller so he
22:41
kind of goes smaller so that's no when
22:43
he when he becomes quite careful yeah
22:44
that's right yeah
22:46
shorter as clark kent so people for
22:47
extra realism don't tell i mean he's not
22:50
real
22:54
um that was going to be my fact next
22:56
week
22:57
damn it
22:58
[Music]
23:00
i have a few good uh so
23:03
titles of autobiographies which i just
23:04
really like um colonel sanders wrote one
23:07
called life as i know it has been finger
23:10
licking good
23:18
leonard nimoy wrote one called i am not
23:20
spock and then a follow-up called i am
23:23
spock
23:25
i've read them both love you
23:28
really good highly recommend them book
23:29
festival read them

23:32
iron spock and margaery kemp
23:36
and judge judy anyone i judge judy the
23:38
american sort of weary ascent um
23:41
judge judy wrote one called don't pee on
23:44
my leg and tell me it's raining
23:48
which is apparently an american idiom
23:50
it's sort of don't
23:51
don't lie to me don't have you don't
23:53
piss on my back and tell me it's raining
23:54
oh gosh
23:56
yeah
23:58
it might be a bolton thing
24:00
in bolton it's necessary to say that
24:04
[Laughter]
24:07
in 2010 a man was caught masturbating to
24:10
alan sugar's autobiography
24:14
in crawley library
24:16
the man was cautioned
24:18
and banned from returning to the library
24:23
was the book cleaned afterwards
24:26
it was no more information
24:29
wow
24:30
in 1979 gerald ford released his
24:33
autobiography and betty ford his wife
24:35
was releasing um hers at the same time
24:37
and his was called a time to heal the
24:39
autobiography of joel ford and hers was
24:40
called the times of my life which
24:41
obviously sounds much more fun and for
24:43
hit so that year for gerald ford's 64th
24:46
birthday betty gave him a a t-shirt that
24:50
read my i bet my book will outsell yours
24:52
oh she's quite sweet yeah and did it and
24:55
it did yeah
24:56
yeah wow yeah so good prediction yeah
24:59
and then next year the t-shirt said told
25:02
you yeah
25:04
and then they divorced
25:08
um alec baldwin wrote one which sold 12
25:10
copies in its first month
25:12
which is amazing and it has an amazingly
25:14
bad title it's called a promise to
25:16
ourselves colon a journey through
25:18
fatherhood
25:21
yeah that's the name
25:22
of the bronte sisters their first book
25:24
of poetry there were three of them wrote
25:26
it and they only sold two copies yes
25:28
so they didn't even buy one each in the
25:30
first
25:31
in the first year it took a year to sell
25:33
two copies unbelievable yeah
25:36
well they live together you can [ __ ]
25:38
yeah you're right
25:39
i like the fact that autobiographies
25:41
used to be called apologia didn't they
25:43
when so when you look back to antiquity
25:45
then it was always apologia which was
25:47
sort of apologizing for what you've done
25:49
wrong which seems like much more people
25:50
should do rather than you know it was
25:52
kind of false modesty yeah it was it was
25:55
usually a justification of what all
25:57
their critics had aimed at them and um
25:59
explaining that it was yeah but
26:00
augustine as well who a lot of people
26:02
say is the first autobiography of kind
26:04
of a non-classical age um his was just
26:07
called confessions and that was his
26:09
explaining all the stuff he'd done wrong
26:11
and not even stuff that he remembered so
26:13
chapter one of augustine's autobiography
26:15
was him saying when i was a child i
26:17
don't really remember it very well but i
26:18
know i will committed loads of sins and
26:20
for that i'm really sorry i feel
26:21
terrible about it don't know what they
26:23
were but i'm sure i did
26:25
really really bad sorry guys
26:27
wow yeah no john henry newman who's an
26:30
eminent victorian wrote one in 1864
26:32
which is called apologia pro suavita or
26:35
apology for his life which sounds very
26:37
sarcastic like
26:39
sorry about my life guys
26:43
adolescent um we should we should move
26:45
on okay yeah we're going way over
26:47
anything else
26:49
no
26:50
i got a couple of interesting things
26:52
which i didn't know which is so there's
26:53
a number of things that happening uh you
26:55
have ghost writing which is obviously
26:57
just ghostwriting someone's
26:58
autobiography there's a term in the
27:00
music world which is called a hummer and
27:02
hummer is someone who takes claim of
27:05
having written a tune on a movie so like
27:07
back when charlie chaplin used to make
27:08
his movies always said written directed
27:10
music by
27:11
he would go around so he'd walk up to a
27:13
musician who he'd hide and go
27:16
good luck and then he would take claim
27:18
for having written that song
27:20
and that's called a hummer hummers take
27:22
someone who takes claim for a song off a
27:24
hum that they've done to say hang on
27:25
because they hummed near somebody who
27:27
wrote something yeah yeah exactly
27:29
no no they would hum an initial tune and
27:31
say build on it and then they would do
27:33
it and so it's ghost writing it's it's
27:35
it's fake and also i was really
27:38
surprised by this um
27:39
there's script doctoring which is done
27:41
as well for hollywood movies and
27:43
obviously that is done a lot of the time
27:44
but i didn't know these famous people
27:45
were involved with it so tom stoppard we
27:47
all know tom stopbard tom stopard was a
27:50
ghost writer in the in the movie sense
27:52
uh so script doctor for indiana jones
27:54
and the last crusade what for the born
27:57
ultimatum and for star wars iii revenge
28:00
of the sith oh isn't that amazing
28:03
yeah it's amazing in the way that i
28:05
don't believe it no is it true yeah it's
28:06
absolutely true and also carrie fisher
28:08
uh speaking of tom stoppard and star
28:10
wars carrie fisher princess leia of star
28:12
wars actually ghost wrote most of tom
28:14
stoppard's place
28:19
she did she did script doctoring for
28:20
sister act lethal weapon three last
28:22
action hero the wedding singer uh and
28:25
she wrote all of tinker bell's uh
28:26
dialogue in hook well carrie fisher's on
28:29
the christmas episode of qi this year
28:31
isn't she yeah well if i'd have known
28:32
that i got to write the script instead
28:33
of spending all that time
28:36
it's true um okay we should move on uh
28:39
okay it's time for fact number three and
28:42
that is chelsinski
28:44
yeah my fact from the book uh is that
28:47
william morton father of anesthesia
28:50
first experimented on himself but kept
28:52
falling asleep before he could describe
28:53
the results
28:55
[Laughter]
28:59
day nine very optimistic about today
29:04
that's amazing
29:06
uh yeah he loved it he loved
29:07
experimenting on himself and various
29:09
things so this was in the 18th late
29:11
1830s 1840s and he was experimenting
29:13
with ether um and he
29:16
also experimented on his wife's chicken
29:19
he cut off its crest uh to see if it
29:21
would be in pain which she said that it
29:22
wasn't a psychopathy
29:26
what are you doing this morning i was
29:27
just cutting bits off animals it was
29:29
painful
29:30
how does he know as well he's like yeah
29:32
did that hurt
29:33
no okay
29:34
i'll keep going he spoke chicken
29:36
that's just one of his gifts oh yeah he
29:38
experiments a lot of goldfish on the pet
29:40
dog uh on various pets on his students
29:44
who
29:44
we're not still cutting things off are
29:46
we
29:47
yeah just decapitated no um and yeah
29:50
because people tended not to want to
29:52
volunteer themselves but eventually he
29:53
had to get a volunteer because he did
29:54
keep falling asleep so once his wife
29:56
walked into the room and found him
29:57
unconscious on the floor um and had to
29:59
rouse him and he'd been asleep for about
30:01
12 minutes and he said he thought he
30:03
probably would have died had she not
30:04
interrupted
30:05
so um his wife went through a lot so his
30:07
wife said he was obviously quite a
30:08
strange character loved um these kind of
30:11
grotesque experiments on himself and
30:12
things around him his wife said uh never
30:15
shall i forget my sensation as a young
30:17
bride at sleeping in a room where a tall
30:19
gaunt skeleton stood in a big box near
30:22
the head of the bed which i just like is
30:23
the image of coming home on your wedding
30:25
night and going
30:27
what's that
30:29
is that going to stay
30:33
human skeleton that he kept by his bed
30:36
amazing yeah deal breaker i would say
30:38
but whatever
30:40
well once you're already married
30:42
yeah another thing you can do picky
30:43
picky
30:47
but yeah so it says in the book father
30:49
of anesthesia and he's quite
30:51
controversial so if there are any like
30:52
horus wells lovers out there i
30:54
understand that horace wells was the guy
30:56
who experimented with nitrous oxide
30:58
which turned out to be more effective in
30:59
a lot of ways as an anaesthetic but he
31:02
was unfortunate because it seemed to be
31:03
working so he decided to do a public
31:05
demonstration of how effective an
31:07
anesthetic this was in 1845 and he
31:09
slightly um misjudged the amounts he had
31:11
to given the length of time he had to
31:12
give it for and this public
31:13
demonstration ended in like the
31:15
screaming hysterical agonized fit of the
31:17
person in question so everyone went home
31:19
and said well this is rubbish isn't it
31:21
that's not wow let's not try this
31:24
i don't know then there was um there's a
31:26
lot of surgeons didn't really like
31:27
anaesthetic at the start no i'm not sure
31:29
if i've said this before but there was a
31:30
russian surgeon called nikolai pregoff
31:32
and he didn't like using laughing gas
31:34
because he was accustomed to the screams
31:36
and reactions to pain of his patients
31:38
and found it much more difficult to
31:40
operate on an unresponsive body
31:44
yeah but apparently he wasn't alone like
31:46
a lot of surgeons like to know that if
31:47
you prod this bit someone's screaming
31:49
you say no it's not they said it guided
31:50
the scalpel yeah and a lot of people
31:54
oh don't go there okay
31:57
yeah there was a there was a french
31:59
surgeon called magendi um who thought it
32:01
was ridiculous all this experimenting
32:02
with anaesthetics because he said the
32:04
pain was essentially irrelevant and um
32:06
it was barely worth noting the pain of
32:08
actual surgery and i've looked into him
32:10
and he was never operated on yeah
32:14
but and then a lot of religious a lot of
32:16
christians thought that it was what god
32:18
intended for us and that it was kind of
32:20
anti-christian
32:22
suffering and bearing children exactly
32:24
yeah yeah
32:25
wow very controversial um before they
32:28
had um before uh morton got involved and
32:31
kind of before wells got involved as
32:33
well they just had laughing gas shows
32:34
which just traveled to the country uh
32:37
across america um so supposed professors
32:39
would travel from town to town giving
32:40
lectures and then just put people under
32:42
laughing gas and then people would laugh
32:44
and then stagger about and then fall
32:46
over and talk rubbish and um
32:48
yeah and they just happened on the
32:50
pavement and it was at one of these that
32:51
horace wells noticed that someone had a
32:54
painful accident and didn't flinch and
32:56
so he thought oh well i'm going to go
32:57
and try this i try this out on people
32:58
and the next day he had one of his own
33:00
wisdom teeth taken out under the
33:02
influence of nitrous oxide and that's
33:03
what set him off on the whole yeah wow
33:05
it took a long time didn't it because
33:07
when was um
33:09
what's he called loving nitrous oxide
33:10
humphrey davey was uh that was the 1790s
33:13
wasn't it when he was dealing with
33:14
laughing gas and it wasn't until the
33:16
1840s that so for ages they just laughed
33:19
yeah for 50 years just going they must
33:21
be used to this
33:23
at the moment
33:25
i read a really good so james has got us
33:27
a subscription to the british newspaper
33:29
archive which if anyone um wants to i
33:31
would highly recommend because it's so
33:32
fun so i looked up are you going to
33:34
offer everyone you're logging
33:37
james arghan yeah no um his cat's name
33:40
one two three
33:43
um so there was a letter written to the
33:45
liverpool mercury in 1824 and this was
33:47
in the era when a lot of people were
33:49
going to shows and having nitrous oxide
33:51
tried on them and it was by someone
33:52
who'd been to one of these shows and he
33:53
tried nitrous oxide and he wrote it out
33:56
to the paper saying describing it saying
33:58
the sensation somewhat resembled those
34:00
i've experienced when coming in for a
34:02
share of superfine wine
34:04
which wine it most resembles i cannot
34:06
determine but if you or any of your
34:08
friends are anxious to have the point
34:09
settled you have only to send me a few
34:11
specimens of superior champagne or
34:13
burgundy
34:18
what a guy
34:19
yeah i'm really obsessed with people who
34:21
do self-experimentation because oh yeah
34:23
it's because it feels like it was a long
34:26
gone era where they were doing it and
34:28
and now you look at the news almost
34:30
virtually every day and it just seems to
34:31
be going on more and more people just
34:33
going into their own world not asking
34:35
for permission the guy um barry marshall
34:38
won the nobel prize what are your
34:39
countrymen yeah an australian fellow
34:41
australian uh won uh the nobel prize for
34:44
trying to
34:45
try to explain that you all know this
34:47
better so why don't you just say this uh
34:48
yeah a lot of people know i guess it's
34:50
um so he won the nobel prize because he
34:53
proved that uh stomach ulcers were
34:55
caused by a bacteria called hylia
34:57
heliobacter pylori i think it's called
35:00
and he found that out by testing himself
35:02
by giving himself this um bacteria he
35:05
and then he turned out that he did get
35:07
these uh stomach ulcers and then he took
35:08
some antibiotics and it got rid of them
35:10
and it's not all stomach ulcers but it's
35:12
a lot of them yeah but he effectively he
35:14
should have died off the back of what
35:15
the medical community thought would
35:17
happen to him so he just went screw it
35:18
i'm going to drink a petri dish from
35:20
bacteria myself and i'm going to do it
35:21
to myself i really admired that but it
35:24
has been going forever and my favorite
35:25
ever self-experiment story is back from
35:28
2000 bc it's from the ming dynasty and
35:31
it's a guy called uh one who from china
35:34
who decided to become the first ever
35:35
astronaut
35:38
announced he's like gonna be the first
35:39
ever astronaut
35:41
when was it it's ming dynasty good grief
35:44
yeah uh so he decided he was gonna be
35:46
the first ever astronaut they didn't
35:47
have rockets then did they they what
35:49
they did have was um fireworks
35:52
so
35:54
so they had some rockets so he sat on a
35:56
chair and attached to the chair 40 sec
36:00
47 rockets
36:02
he had 47 attendants
36:05
candle ignite
36:07
the 47 rockets
36:09
there was a massive explosion and
36:11
neither one who or the chair were ever
36:13
seen again
36:15
so they might be in space
36:18
it could have worked
36:20
it could have worked and i thought i did
36:22
do that in the movie that would have
36:24
been
36:26
a press announcement from pixar sorry we
36:29
really cocked up this time um try to
36:31
send a character into space he's dead
36:33
the chair is gone as well
36:35
uh no he it's it's no one really agrees
36:37
that this definitely happened it's
36:39
definitely apocryphal
36:41
but at the same time there is a crater
36:43
on the moon named one who i thought you
36:45
could say created by his impact
36:48
there's a crater and yeah i've spoken to
36:50
my friends
36:51
okay some more self-experimenters uh
36:53
herbert wollard and edwin carmichael did
36:56
some experiments in 1933
36:59
and they wanted to know how it felt to
37:01
put certain pressures on the human
37:03
testes
37:05
and so they placed
37:07
they placed weights on the testes
37:10
and they explained what how it felt so
37:12
i'll give you some of the things they
37:14
said
37:15
300 grams slight discomfort discomfort
37:18
in the right groin area
37:20
550 grams definite discomfort intestinal
37:24
region
37:25
followed by a dull ache in the right
37:27
lumbar region dorsally shall we stop now
37:29
no let's keep going
37:32
i don't know i'd like to stop no we're
37:33
going on
37:35
and then when they get up to 850 grams
37:39
there's a quote of what he said
37:41
and he exclaims at once that is quite
37:44
different from the left side
37:50
wow good understatement
37:53
so speaking of crushing testicles do you
37:55
guys
37:58
do you guys know auguste beer
38:01
uh no who so he's someone who pioneer
38:05
pioneered the cocainization of the
38:07
spinal cord in like 1898 which is where
38:09
you inject cocaine into your spinal
38:11
fluids and it has a numbing effect and
38:13
it was quite successful so he and his
38:15
assistant auguste hildebrand decided to
38:17
try it out first of all his assistant
38:19
was um supposed to try it out on him and
38:22
use the wrong size syringe for the
38:23
needle which meant that he injected uh
38:25
august spinal cord and his spinal fluid
38:27
just spouted out all over the room
38:29
because it didn't fit
38:30
well this is useless and then he was
38:32
drained of all his spinal fluid so they
38:33
couldn't try that again so they switched
38:35
places and the assistant agreed to have
38:37
him
38:38
infect his spinal cord i would not
38:40
switch places with someone whose spinal
38:42
fluid i just wasted
38:44
i would feel very bad about that
38:48
so they did it and it was quite
38:49
successful it was very successful he
38:51
lost all the feeling in his legs and so
38:53
to
38:55
to check that it worked all got august
38:58
kicked stabbed bludgeoned and burned his
39:00
shins plucked out his pubic hairs
39:02
stubbed out cigars on his leg and then
39:05
crushed and tugged his testicles
39:07
yeah that's what happens this is for my
39:09
spinal fluid
39:13
but they said so he felt nothing so they
39:15
thought this has been great and they
39:16
celebrated by getting really pissed and
39:18
smoking loads of cigars and
39:20
they woke up the next day and apparently
39:23
it was awful and they felt like hell for
39:26
five days
39:28
apparently that's a common side effect
39:29
of loss of cerebral spinal fluid i guess
39:32
combined with quite a bad hangover
39:35
i guess we shouldn't have that some of
39:36
the line of cocaine into our spines last
39:39
night
39:41
he was the seventh that did it
39:43
wow
39:45
we need to move on
39:46
and tell you about one um another
39:48
self-experimenter this guy is
39:50
unbelievable in 1804 he was an american
39:53
student called stubbins firth what a
39:54
name and he wanted to show that yellow
39:57
fever was not contagious and so he did
39:59
so by
40:01
okay
40:02
brace yourselves
40:03
inhaling the vapor of sufferers
40:04
simmering black vomit
40:07
he then he then injected the vomit into
40:09
his own veins and into cuts on his arms
40:11
um despite the fact that a dog he had
40:13
injected had died within minutes
40:16
he then and then he smeared his body
40:18
with patients blood sweat and urine and
40:20
drank patients saliva blood and vomit he
40:23
didn't catch it
40:24
um
40:26
because the samples came from late stage
40:28
patients who were no longer contagious
40:36
what a guy all right okay uh let's move
40:38
on to our final fact time for a final
40:40
fact and that is andrew hunter murray
40:43
okay my fact is that um
40:46
chestington world of adventures banned
40:49
animal onesies to stop the animals
40:50
they're getting confused
40:56
so
40:57
did they genuinely
40:59
get confused we're all confused by
41:01
animal ones
41:04
so they weren't confused that it was
41:06
another animal that was similar to it it
41:07
was just
41:08
they just thought yeah
41:10
that's a poor fashion choice i don't
41:11
know why you've gone for that um it was
41:13
a temporary one to stop the uh they had
41:15
a new giraffe and a new rhino and they
41:18
they hired bouncers and if you went in
41:19
an animal onesie apparently you were
41:21
going to be given a gray boiler suit to
41:23
put over it um it was just which would
41:25
make you look more like a rhino
41:30
and a big pointy hat
41:34
why we don't know i don't know
41:36
chief exactly says but news there's an
41:39
article in new scientists about this
41:40
they asked an animal expert and she said
41:42
certain colorations do give warning
41:44
signs to other animals and also that
41:45
movement is the trigger so big cats get
41:47
interested uh if someone limps past
41:49
their enclosure because they look weak
41:50
and then she said possibly the worst
41:52
thing you could do is limp past the lion
41:54
enclosure in a zebra print outfit
41:58
what about climbing into it uh also bad
42:00
also yeah sorry second worst thing limp
42:02
past yeah
42:04
um
42:05
since 2012 the company kigu who make
42:07
onesies have sold twice as many panda
42:10
onesies as there are pandas
42:15
yeah but it is easier in both ways it's
42:16
easier to make a panda onesie to be fair
42:18
so yeah i'm just saying you don't have
42:20
to put two panda onesies together and
42:21
then leave them for five years
42:24
a panda onesie is more keen to shag each
42:26
other
42:27
than pandas
42:29
much easier well they did we talked
42:31
about the zoo in china that tried to
42:33
disguise uh really crap animals is
42:35
really great animals
42:38
in the in the henan province i feel like
42:40
we might have to they tried to they
42:42
dressed up a tibetan mastiff as an
42:44
african lion
42:46
rats posed as snakes dogs dressed up as
42:49
leopards
42:50
[Music]
42:52
and in an effort to save face the zoo's
42:54
animal department chief claimed the real
42:56
lion had been temporarily sent to a
42:57
breeding facility or they didn't explain
42:59
why there was a mastiff dressed up as a
43:01
lion in the lion's enclosure
43:04
they also said by the way we've got
43:05
mozart playing tonight you should come
43:06
and see him
43:10
they do but they do
43:11
it's a super when you when you start to
43:12
google uh zoos and people dressing up as
43:15
animals most of the articles that come
43:17
down are from the idea that it's the zoo
43:20
people who are dressing up so there were
43:22
pandas talking of pandas um they had a
43:25
they had a small baby panda that was
43:26
born and they wanted to put it into the
43:28
wild uh so all of the zookeepers dressed
43:30
up as pandas so they didn't think that
43:34
there was human contact going on so
43:36
maybe it does actually confuse the
43:37
animal i don't know
43:40
giving them much credit animals are very
43:41
good at recognizing each other aren't
43:43
they a lot of animals are so what i
43:44
think we talked about wasps last week
43:46
that they can recognize each other's
43:47
faces so if you put wasps in a maze and
43:49
you show them a photograph of one wasp's
43:51
face that leads to something bad and one
43:53
wasps face that leads to something good
43:54
then they learn the wasps face and learn
43:57
to like go that direction rather than
43:59
the bad wasps face which may i don't
44:01
know what happens when they meet those
44:02
wasps in real life and have
44:04
oh you [ __ ] you kept leading me down
44:07
a bad way
44:08
uh but yeah sheep are really good at
44:10
recognizing each other which is weird
44:12
because they all famously look the same
44:16
now you're being sheep racist
44:18
i'm a sheepist
44:20
yeah if you show sheep uh so i think
44:22
they experimented on 50 sheep and if you
44:24
show them a picture of one sheep like
44:26
two a couple of sheep faces then they
44:29
can always identify the one that's
44:30
associated with something good or 85 of
44:32
the time i think they identify the ones
44:34
associated with something good um so
44:36
yeah i don't think animals are being
44:38
confused by humans dressed in furry
44:40
stuff all right well then in a different
44:42
case at a zoo in tenerife
44:44
they have a thing they do this in zoos
44:46
now where they dress up
44:49
certain members of the team as an animal
44:51
and get them to try and escape the zoo
44:53
and the costume bits yeah yeah the
44:56
costume the costume bid is just just to
44:58
add effect and fun for them to do and so
45:01
sorry in case in case
45:03
it's to test if a gorilla escaped from
45:05
an enclosure and it started running out
45:07
how they could have an emergency yeah
45:09
exactly they have an emergency routine
45:11
if something escapes and they have to
45:13
make sure that they know what they're
45:14
doing so yeah but
45:15
a a guy in a gorilla suit can't rip
45:17
someone's arm off
45:19
do they add extra realism by ripping
45:20
someone's arm
45:22
yeah they do well what happened in this
45:23
case is one of the zookeepers wasn't
45:25
told this was happening he saw the
45:26
gorilla escaping and shot a tranquilizer
45:28
door into the person
45:31
genuinely this is this was this year
45:34
they had to they had to bring them to
45:35
hospital and bring them back too that's
45:37
amazing so evidently animals are better
45:39
at noticing
45:41
humans dressed up as animals than humans
45:43
are yeah
45:44
in 2008 if you rang up dublin zoo you
45:47
would get an answerful message saying if
45:50
you are calling to speak to mr rory lyon
45:53
sea lion g-raf or anyone similar please
45:56
be aware that you are victim of a hoax
45:58
message
46:04
yeah or perpetrating one that's true
46:07
yeah that's exactly what i would do if i
46:09
had thought of it
46:12
so i really like the history of zoos as
46:14
well so when um london zoo was first
46:17
opened it was obviously much more wild
46:19
westy than uh modern zoos so um they
46:23
just had they thought they would use
46:24
zebras to pull people around in
46:25
passenger carts and carriages and things
46:28
um you could play with the bears
46:30
sometimes
46:31
but just let you play with the bears um
46:33
and they didn't have proper vets you
46:34
know they they just um and also sorry
46:38
they were the bears yeah that's never
46:40
gonna end well
46:42
and they died in their hundreds
46:45
um a female seal disappeared two weeks
46:47
before the grand opening and they only
46:48
found it two days before the public
46:50
first arrived i don't know whether how
46:51
does a seal
46:53
the sketchy on detail here i don't know
46:55
if it escaped the zoo or just was in the
46:57
zoo but not but in the lion enclosure
47:01
um
47:02
the very first animal at london zoo was
47:04
a griffin vulture called dr brooks who
47:06
was named after the anatomy teacher who
47:08
had donated him and his job used to be
47:11
to eat the corpses when they were
47:12
finished with um but then he had retired
47:15
so he didn't have a fresh supplement
47:17
of the children who'd been sent to play
47:18
with the best
47:20
so we're in a different place dr brooks
47:22
anatomy school he he would dissect
47:24
bodies and then afterwards he would the
47:26
vulture could have the rest but after he
47:28
retired no more bodies so he said well i
47:29
have to find a home for the vulture
47:31
wow
47:33
one in eight
47:35
british adults owns a onesie don't they
47:37
that's in one of our five books
47:40
from us
47:40
half of one yeah
47:44
is that true yeah just anyone here
47:47
sure offense oh that looks about right
47:48
wow
47:50
that's about ten yeah yeah it's like
47:52
thirty percent that wasn't ten was no no
47:55
it wasn't
47:56
any any animal animal ones
47:59
which
48:01
wait someone someone in the front row is
48:02
wobbling his hand because he's not sure
48:14
this is interesting this is onesie hour
48:18
you know when you find yourself looking
48:19
up really really hopeful stuff for qi
48:22
research so today i found myself looking
48:24
up at one point
48:26
animals dressed in human onesies
48:33
oh please tell me that you found this
48:35
anything my god if someone finds one
48:37
that would be good there's a sloth ones
48:39
that you get if sloths get mange then
48:40
you have to shave them from head to toe
48:42
but um they need to remain warm and so
48:45
they've designed sloth
48:46
onesies but yeah actually
48:49
yeah yeah that's cool yeah that would be
48:50
the worst human ones here that games are
48:53
slow well also the worse for if you're
48:54
trying to show a sloth escaping a zoo
48:57
because
48:58
you could literally go home come back
48:59
the next day and they've moved a meter
49:01
like that's not the animal escaping
49:03
sloths have lots of beetles living in
49:05
their fur so
49:07
the onesies would have to be thick
49:08
enough for all these beetles to live
49:09
yeah and moths and all sorts yeah you
49:12
must be the worst onesie buyer you're
49:14
returning it to the store i'm sorry but
49:15
this is not an accurate description
49:19
where the beatles what the hell's going
49:20
on here it's a [ __ ] joke
49:23
i made several attempts to lure beetles
49:24
into my suspension
49:27
i found the few of them found it
49:29
enticing prospects
49:31
churchill had a onesie winston churchill
49:33
yeah
49:35
yes
49:36
he called it his siren suit because air
49:38
raid sirens he spent a lot of the war
49:40
second world war working underground at
49:41
the cabinet war rooms and um he had a
49:43
specially designed i don't
49:46
people have dressed this up so they say
49:47
he invented the onesie which he did not
49:50
that's not fair because it's like an
49:51
adapted boiler suit but it was auctioned
49:53
recently for thousands and thousands of
49:54
pounds
49:55
yeah it wasn't an animal it wasn't an
49:57
animal
49:59
can you imagine
50:00
you know
50:01
churchill had a dog onesie
50:03
when churchill talks about his dog
50:09
my black dog's back again
50:12
i'm imagining him in the dog onesie
50:14

52:52
um hey listen we we need to wrap up
52:54
really soon oh really yeah uh do we have
52:56
any more final facts we want to throw
52:58
into this i quite like if we're talking
53:00
about theme parks i didn't know what the
53:02
first ever roller coaster was or the
53:04
original roller coaster so you're
53:06
nodding are you thinking russia it was i
53:08
was thinking blackpool
53:09
[Music]
53:12
no russia hundreds um they had seventeen
53:15
hundred yeah seventeen hundreds they had
53:17
russian ice slides and it was this fad
53:19
in russia that went through all the
53:20
seventeen hundreds catherine the great
53:21
loved them she had loads of them
53:22
installed on her own property and what
53:24
they were they were the structures that
53:26
were up to a hundred feet tall and they
53:27
were what they sound like so they were
53:29
you climb up a ladder 100 feet there's
53:31
an ice light and you just slide all the
53:32
way down it and people would have them
53:34
installed in the halls of their stately
53:35
homes so you'd go into a stately home
53:37
there's a huge ice slide in the middle
53:39
um
53:41
yeah and then the french during the
53:42
napoleonic wars saw these and thought
53:43
that's really and tried them and said
53:45
that's super fun and then they
53:48
yeah that was the predominant emotion in
53:50
moscow in eighteen twelve
54:00
um so the french brought them back and
54:02
then built the world's first roller
54:03
coaster and called it russian mountain

hello and welcome to another episode of
00:34
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:37
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:39
covent garden my name is dan schreiber
00:41
i'm sitting here with andy murray anna
00:43
chazinski and james harkin and once
00:45
again we've gathered around the
00:47
microphones with our four favorite facts
00:49
from the last seven days and in no
00:50
particular order here they are
00:54
[Applause]
00:55
fact number one
00:57
my fact is that if you got into an
00:58
argument in 18th century abyssinia you
01:01
could resolve it by blaming everything
01:03
on the camel
01:05
the camel on the camel yeah were all
01:07
arguments about who had eaten the hay i
01:10
think it turned out that all crimes yeah
01:12
perpetrated by camels
01:14
you blamed it on the camel too much he's
01:16
bound to get the hump hey how long have
01:18
we been planning that
01:20
uh yeah so this was first recorded in
01:22
bruce's travels into abyssinia to
01:24
discover the source of the nile and this
01:26
book was uh written between 1768 and
01:29
1773 and it was his travels around
01:32
africa trying to find the source of the
01:33
nile and uh he observed this tradition
01:36
wow so what what exactly does it involve
01:38
so what he said was he came across a
01:41
town where the townspeople had been
01:42
fighting for several days when it was
01:44
agreed upon by the elders of both
01:46
parties that nobody had been to blame on
01:48
either side but the whole wrong was the
01:50
work of a camel
01:52
and so they the towns people rounded up
01:54
this camel they chose a camel at random
01:56
i guess you can't round up one camera
01:58
yeah
01:59
well it was a very clever camel it was a
02:00
criminal yeah
02:02
uh it was seized and everyone in the
02:04
town gathered around and one by one they
02:06
speared the camel and he recorded that
02:08
they upgraded the camel with all the
02:10
wrongs done so they told the camel
02:12
everything he had done wrong shouted at
02:13
it for a while each one of them speared
02:15
it and then apparently retired fully
02:18
satisfied as to the wrongs they had
02:20
received from the camel
02:22
so yeah there's quite a long history of
02:24
blaming things on animals isn't there
02:25
like scapegoating for instance yeah the
02:27
famous one there was a case in saint
02:29
kilda i think where a great orc was
02:32
accused of being responsible for a storm
02:34
that had ravaged and killed her um it
02:36
was captured and put on trial and found
02:38
guilty and stoned to death this is a
02:39
real animal presumably or it's like a
02:42
bird a uk is the bird it's not it's now
02:44
extinct that was one of the first things
02:45
i ever researched for qi was the great
02:47
talk because i joined during the g
02:48
series they use them for everything on
02:49
saint kilda didn't they yes they used
02:52
filmers and gannets and orcs and they
02:54
ate porridge for breakfast which was you
02:56
know sprinkled with great orc shavings
02:58
and they had they had yeah they used to
03:00
go and kill them in their thousands and
03:02
they men would just walk around because
03:03
they're flightless they would go to the
03:05
islands where they flocked and so they
03:07
would just go around clubbing them to
03:08
death because it saved ammunition so you
03:10
didn't have to waste bullets killing
03:12
them and then the last one was seen you
03:15
know floating out at sea in the mid
03:17
century and that was it it's never been
03:18
seen since wow
03:20
awkward
03:22
oh my god
03:24
ancient egyptians used to when like they
03:26
felt they've been particularly sinful
03:28
used to sacrifice an animal and lump all
03:30
their sins onto this animal then
03:31
sacrifice it and then they'd sell it to
03:34
foreigners because they didn't want to
03:36
eat the sinned on classical
03:38
foreign so is that this was where we get
03:40
the scapegoat from is that right the
03:42
escape guilt is from the torah from
03:44
jewish folklore i think and what they
03:47
would do is on the day of atonement um
03:49
the jewish high priest would lay his
03:51
hands on a live goats confess all the
03:53
sins of the children of israel and then
03:55
send it away into the wilderness it's
03:57
like a santa claus who just gets the
03:59
naughty list
04:00
but then has to deal with it
04:02
um the ancient greeks used people for
04:04
this kind of purpose didn't they so they
04:05
would have a person i think it was often
04:08
a disabled person who they would again
04:10
they'd pile all their sins upon this
04:12
person and send him into exile and that
04:14
would be that person taking their sins
04:15
away and he was called a pharmacos which
04:18
is where we get pharmacy pharmaceuticals
04:21
is from because he would remedy the sins
04:23
of a
04:24
community yes it's amazing yeah it's
04:26
quite a cool world origin and sort of
04:28
unpleasant was there a reward for it
04:30
beforehand did you live quite well
04:32
before you were cast out yes you did you
04:34
used to be treated as kind of uh blessed
04:36
and cursed so they'd be preserved and
04:38
they'd be like they'd be hosted around
04:41
the village and does that not make it
04:43
worse because like the difference
04:45
between being sent into the wilderness
04:47
and just having a normal life is one
04:49
thing but the difference between that
04:50
and having a really great life is even
04:52
worse yeah well tom hanks explores this
04:54
theme in the film joe versus the volcano
04:56
i believe
04:57
um if you remember that one seen that no
04:59
i didn't know that was a great
05:01
philosophical oh yeah three ties of a
05:03
film and the q i's gain was news night
05:05
reviews
05:07
[Laughter]
05:09
camels does anyone have anything about
05:10
camels i do go on uh
05:13
google you know google maps i do yeah
05:16
yeah so street view yeah they've had one
05:19
camel with a camera on its back walking
05:21
the leeward desert that's good yeah it's
05:24
basically a camel has mapped one of the
05:26
deserts one of the great deserts one
05:27
camel just one camel that's a lot for a
05:29
camel to do yeah his name's raffia
05:31
that's a great name yeah 150 kilometers
05:34
southwest of abu dhabi and uh yeah just
05:37
went is it on its own how does they know
05:39
how how do they direct well in the
05:40
picture that i've seen online there's a
05:42
dude walking it you can train camels to
05:44
go in certain directions uh by giving
05:47
them food if they go in one way and then
05:49
they'll keep going there because they
05:50
think that's where they'll find food and
05:52
that's a way that they transport drugs
05:54
across the sahara oh yeah they train
05:56
these camels to walk from western africa
05:59
all the way up to
06:00
the mediterranean
06:02
they train them and train them and train
06:03
them and then they put the drugs on the
06:05
back of the camels and they don't need
06:06
any human assistance at all so if they
06:08
get caught if the camels get caught by
06:09
the police then there's no humans yeah
06:11
no but again camel's getting blamed
06:13
because the camel's gonna be on the one
06:14
that takes the wrap camel milk is more
06:16
nutritious than cow milk isn't it is it
06:19
yeah i don't know why they don't drink
06:20
it in australia for instance why they've
06:22
got more camels than anywhere else well
06:23
they're all feral they started selling
06:24
in america why wouldn't you yeah they do
06:26
and i think they're trying to make it
06:27
into a baby milk as well australia um
06:30
sells camels to saudi arabia
06:32
does it yeah saudi arabia also imports
06:34
sand for use in construction exactly so
06:37
the saudi sand isn't good for
06:38
construction whereas the australian one
06:40
is and also the um saudi camels are for
06:44
breeding and racing whereas the
06:46
australian ones are good for meat um
06:48
i've got i i was looking into just
06:50
general excuses because i do like that's
06:52
the scapegoat but it is also just a
06:54
fantastic excuse to sort of say let's no
06:56
longer argue about this stuff and um
06:59
so can i okay some some of my favorite
07:01
sporting excuses yeah this one comes
07:03
from us sprinter lashon merritt oh yeah
07:06
um he was banned because he did a drug
07:08
called dhea i'm not gonna try and
07:10
pronounce the longer version of that
07:11
word
07:12
but he claims it wasn't to improve his
07:14
performance he claims there's a quote i
07:16
was trying to make my penis bigger
07:20
he didn't realize that they had this
07:21
kind of drug in it it was to improve his
07:23
performance
07:26
yeah it would probably
07:28
not help his spotting performance at all
07:29
would it it's still it could be worse it
07:30
could be a high jumper this is an
07:32
interesting thing you know how high jump
07:33
works
07:35
you leave that behind yeah
07:38
here's another one uh so okay there's a
07:41
cyclist called tyler hamilton who did
07:44
you know about this one i know him okay
07:46
so he got busted um because they'd found
07:49
someone else's red blood cells oh his
07:51
blood uh which suggested that there was
07:53
all this thing about replacing your
07:54
blood and stuff um his claim was that it
07:57
was his unborn twin oh he said that his
08:00
mother had uh had a twin who died um
08:03
weirdly medical authorities have said
08:04
that that's plausible that definitely
08:06
happened yeah it's called chimeraism
08:08
isn't it and the idea is that you um had
08:11
two um babies and then a very very early
08:14
stage one of them um was enveloped into
08:16
the other one it could be even just when
08:18
it's a few cells
08:20
and it means that you can sometimes
08:22
people who have one eye which is
08:23
different color that could be cut due to
08:25
chimeraism but also yeah it's really
08:27
interesting actually yeah oh okay so
08:30
blaming people
08:31
blaming your mistakes on other people is
08:33
socially contagious in the same way that
08:35
a yawn is
08:36
um so they've done studies and they
08:38
found that when you watch someone else
08:40
blaming someone then you will blame
08:43
someone yourself and that's more likely
08:45
to happen wow so there can be a culture
08:47
of blame yeah that's amazing also you're
08:50
just mentioning yawning has made me yawn
08:51
now so thank you for that actually
08:59
okay time to move on to fact number two
09:02
and fact number two is my fact
09:05
my fact this week is that in ancient
09:07
greece they used to play with yo-yos
09:10
now i know that everyone in this room is
09:11
not as surprised by that as i am but i
09:13
just i think it's amazing it's great
09:15
yeah
09:16
okay because james and anna seem to know
09:18
that but i saw this i went to a
09:20
wikipedia page i thought they just
09:21
played with xboxes
09:23
there's actually
09:25
boxes
09:26
exciting
09:27
very good
09:29
there's there's a vars and there's a
09:31
illustration on this vars of someone
09:33
from ancient greece a boy playing with
09:34
the yo-yo and i looked at that and i was
09:36
like what the hell is that doing there
09:38
that's really weird it's so out of place
09:39
in time for me i was saying to james
09:41
earlier i feel like that's like if i was
09:42
looking for evidence of time travel and
09:44
i didn't you know didn't know stuff
09:46
about history which now i know it's not
09:47
time travel but i didn't know that that
09:49
was like i think that's the only one
09:51
there is that jar i think
09:53
and i don't think we have written
09:55
evidence of it so and i don't think yo
09:57
has reappeared until
09:59
quite a lot later so maybe he was a time
10:02
traveler wow and he made it onto a vars
10:04
it makes you think as well that if you
10:07
did get put back into ancient greece as
10:09
a time traveler then i know i have no
10:11
uses but i do know how to walk the dog
10:13
and rock a cradle in yo-yos that would
10:16
instantly be mr popular you'll be on all
10:18
of ours
10:20
to be fair though we only have that one
10:22
virus because almost all the vases in
10:24
the world have been smashed from that
10:25
time so
10:27
[Laughter]
10:29
um so maybe it's that maybe every single
10:32
vars
10:34
on it yeah
10:35
all right but they do think they do
10:36
think it appeared in ancient china way
10:38
before there's three locations that they
10:40
kind of say it could belong to ancient
10:42
greece ancient china and the philippines
10:44
the philippines is less so of a strong
10:46
argument except for the fact that they
10:47
call it the yo-yo and that's where
10:49
america adopted the word yo-yo from but
10:52
in philippines they used it as a weapon
10:54
we thought on qi certainly that yo-yos
10:57
were never used as weapons
10:59
and we got quite close to running it as
11:01
a general ignorance on the show and i
11:02
don't think we did in the end
11:04
but then i read um something by
11:06
president aquino iii of the philippines
11:09
and he reckons that they do have
11:10
evidence that it was used as a weapon
11:12
after all so according to the president
11:14
it's true but we still really don't
11:16
think it he said that their version that
11:18
they used was large and with sharp edges
11:21
and studs and attached to thick 20-foot
11:24
ropes for flinging at enemies or prey
11:26
i've had a different etymology for yoyo
11:28
which is the
11:29
it was known in france in the late 18th
11:32
century as the juju de normandie which
11:34
just means a little toy so that's
11:36
another possible one okay it's
11:39
one of those again you look into the
11:40
history of it and suddenly it starts
11:41
appearing everywhere napoleon's army it
11:44
says online that fought with yo-yos no
11:46
you just used to play with them in the
11:47
kind of downtown yeah i think of
11:49
wellington
11:50
napoleon played i mean
11:52
surely that's a myth there are paintings
11:54
of yeah the napoleonic army aren't there
11:56
with yoyos almost all pictures of people
11:58
playing with yoyos in the 18th 17th
12:00
centuries are adults and it was a really
12:02
fashionable thing to do like you get
12:03
parisian ladies in the 18th century
12:05
playing with yo
12:07
as they're walking along with their
12:08
parasols and their smart clothes
12:10
i think it was quite tremendous i just
12:11
didn't know it was such a big deal the
12:13
yo-yo it was a big deal when i was a kid
12:15
yeah yeah me too yeah in the 80s late
12:17
80s when i was a kid it was massive in
12:19
school we all had yo-yos same in the 90s
12:21
it was well it was voted the biggest fad
12:24
toy of the 20th century because every
12:26
childhood has had a yo-yo being a big
12:28
part of it yeah there was a massive one
12:30
in 1988 and they the company that made
12:34
this particular type of yo-yo
12:36
sold a couple of hundred in 1987 and
12:38
more than half a million in 1988.
12:41
how come it just became a massive fad
12:43
and everyone in every school had to have
12:44
one the company that made them was
12:46
called pms international
12:49
it's a really pissed off woman looking
12:51
for something to occupy her kids
12:54
um you used to be able to become rich
12:55
and famous for scale extric in america
12:58
yeah it was massively popular in the
13:00
1960s they used to show live tournaments
13:03
on us tv and there were more slot car
13:06
facilities and there were bowling alleys
13:08
in america uh that's in the 1960s and
13:10
today there are none no way yeah what's
13:13
the worst it's a slot car so it's like
13:15
so um
13:18
it's just like it just slots in a little
13:20
sort of plugs into the track um another
13:22
famous toy car maybe the most famous toy
13:25
car uh yeah go on um brum
13:28
brum
13:29
oh wow
13:30
cartoon from the 90s
13:40
i was going for bigger i was going for
13:41
the cozy coupe you know that you know
13:43
what i mean right no it's this is the
13:44
red and yellow car
13:46
oh yes can have that as a kid yeah as a
13:48
kid that you sit inside
13:50
for a kid oh yeah yeah yeah one of those
13:52
um so that has been the best-selling car
13:55
in the us it was throughout the 90s
13:57
and the last time uh the last i had was
13:59
from 2008 in the u.s and the uk it sells
14:01
more than any other make of car that's
14:03
great wouldn't that be great if that was
14:04
the rescue plan for general motors well
14:06
we've actually got a new model we are
14:07
very excited and it's going to
14:08
reinvigorate the american car industry
14:10
it's not not a long way from smart cars
14:12
are they they're no they're true yeah
14:14
but they're closer to flintstone cars as
14:15
well
14:17
well that's similar to the fact that
14:19
lego is supposed to be the largest um
14:21
tire manufacturer yeah yeah doesn't it
14:24
you know you can buy a lego nazi
14:25
concentration camp
14:28
yeah you can yeah it was designed by an
14:30
artist and i think it was bought by the
14:31
warsaw jewish memorial museum or
14:33
something and so right it's not meant to
14:35
be uh right so it's not a commercial
14:37
project
14:37
i don't think so they've said that lego
14:40
people are getting angrier as the years
14:42
go on out there yeah expressions can i
14:44
tell you about twister yes
14:46
i love twister so much is it ancient
14:48
this is not an ancient greek game no
14:52
that would be great yeah it's on the
14:53
other side of the varsity they've never
14:54
looked well they have ancient persian
14:56
rugs with this
14:58
[Laughter]
15:00
um so okay the inventor is a guy called
15:02
rain
15:04
rain goya i think is his name i don't
15:06
know how to pronounce it um but he
15:07
wanted to call it pretzel although one
15:09
of his initial names for it was king's
15:11
footsie um but the thing is it tanked
15:13
when they first sold it because people
15:15
thought it was risque did they sell it
15:16
sex in the box or something like well
15:18
other people complained supposedly that
15:20
other manufacturers or possibly the
15:22
bosses at the other firm which made it
15:24
and they were going to give up sears
15:26
didn't want it for their catalogue and
15:28
the one last ditch attempt they had was
15:30
to get on a tv show and the pr firm
15:32
pushing twister got it onto the tonight
15:34
show with johnny carson and he played a
15:37
round of it with um eva gabor who was a
15:41
sex symbol at the time and the next
15:43
morning the queue was 50 deep
15:46
and they sold 3 million that year wow
15:48
and it was just it suddenly took off
15:51
because that one appearance on tv it's
15:53
weird when because toys if they take off
15:55
they really take off yeah like my
15:56
especially thai helicopters
16:01
um my little i
16:03
went to see my little niece recently it
16:05
was her birthday and i was shocked that
16:07
there's a whole new toy there's
16:09
dominating everything and it's looms
16:12
looming is the biggest thing is that
16:14
giant weaving looms and you use rubber
16:16
bands and you loom bands to go around
16:18
your wrist you make necklaces all that
16:20
it's the biggest go walk by any kids
16:23
shop at the moment look in the window
16:24
it's all looms on display um get this in
16:27
2008 the national toy hall of fame
16:29
awarded oldest toy to
16:32
the stick
16:42
at christmas and your parents go good
16:44
news we bought you something from the
16:46
thai hall of fame
16:48
[Applause]
16:51
time for fact number three and that is
16:54
andy my fact this week is that most
16:56
honeybee hives in the usa live on trucks
16:59
on flatbed trucks
17:01
they do not live in fields where you
17:03
might think or in stationary apiaries
17:05
most bees in the usa are driven around
17:07
and rented out so that they can
17:09
pollinate plants they never find a home
17:11
they just the truck is their home i
17:12
think some i don't know about how it
17:14
happens during winter but i think during
17:16
the summer season there are billions of
17:18
bees being driven all over america um
17:20
and they stop and they're released to
17:22
pollinate a crop and then they go back
17:25
to the hive in the evening or whatever
17:27
it is they finish doing all the
17:28
pollinating and then away they go
17:30
they're driving because
17:32
it's partly because of that yeah
17:34
although colony collapse has slowed down
17:35
they're not sure why but even so a third
17:37
of all bees in america die each year um
17:39
they think it's because of these
17:41
chemicals used called neonicotinoids i
17:43
thought bees would die within a year
17:45
they lived well the lifespan is really
17:47
variable depending on how hard they work
17:48
so i think
17:50
as with people um
17:53
we're all in our late 80s
17:55
i think worker bees um in hot weather
17:58
where i think they have to work harder
18:00
and have a lifespan of about six weeks
18:01
and then if it's a cold year then they
18:04
can last for about 10 months they move
18:05
around slowly don't they're sort of
18:06
sluggish the other thing i read about
18:08
old bees is if you give them a job that
18:10
normally young bees do then their brains
18:13
stop aging or even reverse it they get
18:15
younger it's like doing sudoku for them
18:18
yeah apart from i don't think the young
18:19
people are doing sudoku these days if
18:21
you started playing with looms then your
18:23
hair your brain would go or if you teach
18:25
an ob to play call of duty advanced
18:27
warfare yeah yeah cool and the brain
18:30
chemistry can change can't it so if so i
18:32
think honey bees do lots of jobs so
18:34
there are certain like worker bees are
18:35
just workers um and
18:37
uh drone bees etc but honey bees do lots
18:40
of jobs and when they switch from one
18:42
job to another their actual brain
18:43
chemistry changes and i think they're
18:45
one of the only animals that's known to
18:46
do that
18:47
in order to adapt them to their other
18:48
job
18:49
um but they do so we do need them to
18:52
pollinate our crops don't we i think
18:54
a third of the world's crops they're
18:56
responsible for 20 billion dollars worth
18:58
of food production in america alone i
19:01
think don't flies pollinate flowers more
19:03
than than bees do no well lots of other
19:05
things do as well so there are 20 000
19:07
species of bee which no and the honeybee
19:09
is the one that gets all the press so
19:11
the agave plant which tequila's made out
19:13
of is um pollinated by bats yeah um the
19:17
cocoa plant is pollinated by midges are
19:19
we about to go through all the plants
19:37
it's a peanut [ __ ]
19:42
there is a bat if you're listening to
19:44
this stop what you're doing and google
19:46
the tube-lipped nectar bat because it
19:48
has the longest tongue proportional to
19:51
its body look of any animal it's longer
19:53
i think than the animal itself or it's
19:54
two-thirds of the animal's length and it
19:56
has such a long tongue it has to keep a
19:58
bit of it in its rib cage and they
20:00
specialize in pollinating and drinking
20:02
the nectar from these flowers with
20:03
incredibly long trumpets so that's what
20:06
they they have to do they have to have
20:07
this unbelievable tongue wow
20:10
um i found a great headline to do with
20:11
the trucks uh carrying all the bees oh
20:13
yeah and the headline is this it's
20:15
someone who made a connection why are so
20:16
many bee carrying trucks crashing
20:19
apparently
20:20
in the last few years there's been
20:22
serious problems with these trucks that
20:24
are carrying the bees overturning on the
20:26
road smashing down and releasing
20:28
millions of the bees into the road just
20:30
millions swarming everywhere presumably
20:32
that happens mostly not on motorways but
20:34
on b roads
20:37
i enjoyed that
20:39
so they crash it they crash yeah they
20:40
crash and they release all these bees it
20:42
causes help for them and there was a
20:44
really funny thing of
20:45
there's been like two to three of these
20:47
major crashes millions of beers
20:50
and then one time another truck uh came
20:52
along that crashed but it wasn't
20:54
carrying bees it was carrying honey and
20:56
it's filled uh something like 200
20:58
gallons of honey which attracted just
21:02
thousands of swarms of bees and so they
21:03
had another bee crisis on their hands
21:05
and then you can't you have to get them
21:06
the right ones back onto the truck when
21:08
you fix the truck and you have to
21:09
separate them pliny had a theory that if
21:11
honeybees were caught outdoors at night
21:13
and they they had to camp out basically
21:15
and they would sleep on their backs to
21:16
protect their wings from the dew ah
21:20
which was rubbish right it was rubbish
21:21
yes it was and remains oh god
21:24
that's
21:25
interesting
21:26
but not true
21:29
have you heard of the superhero the red
21:30
bee
21:31
no he's one of the worst superheroes of
21:33
all time i just i love him um he's his
21:36
identity is rick raleigh he's an
21:37
assistant district attorney in oregon
21:39
and his modus operandi is to put on a
21:41
red and yellow costume and he has
21:42
trained bees with which he fights nazis
21:45
and this is from the wikipedia page for
21:47
the red bee his favorite bee is named
21:49
michael and lives inside his belt buckle
21:52
for use in special circumstances
21:58
okay time for our final fact and that is
22:00
james okay my fact this week is the
22:03
sacramento police department get at
22:05
least one call a week from people stuck
22:07
in the world's largest corn maze that's
22:09
really funny wow
22:11
i could tell by the way you laughed no
22:13
it was i just like the thought of it of
22:14
just the phone ringing in the in the
22:16
station
22:17
so how big is this corn maze uh it's 63
22:21
acres in size so what do the police do
22:24
when they're called often the police
22:25
will get into the maze and then they'll
22:28
they themselves will have to call
22:30
the bigger police yeah until it's kind
22:32
of like a conga line that they
22:33
eventually finally yeah i think they
22:34
just calm them down really because it's
22:36
mostly that people are like freaking out
22:38
a little bit because they're stuck okay
22:40
uh and then presumably the owners of the
22:42
maze and can then go in and sort it out
22:44
there was it must be a nightmare being
22:46
like okay we shot at six
22:48
nine o'clock now there's something there
22:49
we shot it yeah it's six but last entry
22:52
is at 9 30 in the morning
22:54
that's when you know you're in a serious
22:56
meeting there was a guy in in england
22:58
who had a maze it was quite it wasn't
23:01
like a big like corn one it was a small
23:03
one and he was mowing it he was mowing
23:06
the paths
23:07
and he got to about halfway through and
23:09
then he realized he had to go to his
23:10
daughter's school thing and so he had to
23:14
leave but he couldn't get out of his own
23:15
maze and so he just used his lawnmower
23:17
and just plowed straight through and
23:19
gave himself an exit oh it's the world's
23:22
yeah exactly he said i've just found the
23:24
article he said i'd already had feedback
23:26
suggesting the maze was tricky to
23:27
negotiate before i became lost myself
23:30
next year i think i'll make it a bit
23:32
easier next year i'll listen to the
23:34
bloody feedback
23:37
uh but yeah mazes in general they're
23:39
pretty good i love mazes i haven't been
23:40
amazed for ages i don't think i've ever
23:42
been really yeah let's all go to hampton
23:44
court in germany mazes are called
23:46
irgarten or
23:49
good aerogardens
23:49
that yeah
23:50
that's good but there you used to be so
23:52
mazes go out of labyrinth is that right
23:54
yes so a labyrinth is a maze with only
23:56
one entrance and exit so you can't get
23:58
lost in it you just go straight and you
23:59
come straight back out again lots of
24:01
mazes surely got only one exit an
24:02
entrance
24:03
sorry they're half yeah
24:05
yeah so you walk in and you keep walking
24:07
yeah you get to the middle and then you
24:08
get back out again and there's no way
24:10
you can't turn left or right you just
24:12
have to go in that direction i see
24:14
because yeah there's all the stuff about
24:15
the
24:16
labyrinth crete with thesis and the
24:18
minotaur but you wouldn't get lost in
24:19
that you wouldn't even need a thread so
24:20
was the labyrinth just effectively a
24:23
more complicated walk
24:25
yeah like what was the purpose behind it
24:27
so actually
24:28
yeah it does look nice but people used
24:30
it for like um religious reasons
24:32
sometimes or because it's a very
24:34
particular pattern um one way that you
24:36
could do it is you would you would walk
24:38
in and on the way into the center of the
24:40
labyrinth you would be thinking about
24:41
your problems and then the way out you
24:43
would think about your
24:44
solutions to be a contemplative thing
24:47
apparently like also norwegian sailors
24:49
would um
24:50
would go through these mazes just before
24:52
they went it would be good luck so they
24:54
used it as a charm thing sometimes as
24:56
well i read other another theory um
24:59
either symbolizing the hard life of an
25:01
early christian
25:02
or showing the entanglements of sin or
25:05
my favorite uh you would it would be
25:07
like doing a mini pilgrimage if you
25:08
committed a small sin
25:10
[Laughter]
25:12
go to hampton court but like that's
25:14
cheating because labyrinths are quite
25:15
fun or maize is quite fun but i think
25:17
it's like go and have a long walk and
25:19
think about what you've done kind of
25:20
thing i suppose so yeah that's it
25:23
go on a long walk but stay within yes
25:26
stay within sight of me
25:27
yeah we close at six
25:31
i think they've they've found a maze in
25:33
peru that's more than three thousand
25:35
years old i think so it's in the
25:37
peruvian andes and it's beneath charvin
25:41
de juantar which is this ancient site
25:44
and the whole maze is underground and
25:45
they think that it acted as a ceremonial
25:48
like massive and disorienting acoustic
25:50
chamber because if you go down into it
25:52
the way that it's built means that
25:54
you're when your voice bounces off the
25:56
walls madly and like if someone else in
25:58
another part of the maze you can never
25:59
find them and you think they're coming
26:00
from a different direction and if you're
26:01
above the maze it sounds absolutely
26:03
terrifying and they found at this site
26:04
all these uh kind of trumpet things and
26:06
if you blow the trumpets it sounds
26:08
sounds like like a torch i think yeah i
26:10
think so yeah so you get lost in this
26:12
maze and also sounds are coming from
26:14
everywhere there's an old scandinavian
26:16
punishment um called the uh cave of
26:19
roses and that was you would go into a
26:22
dark cave and then they would throw a
26:24
load of poisonous animals at you and you
26:26
just have to stay there for a while and
26:27
then come out and hopefully not be
26:29
bitten really yeah it's a bit like i'm a
26:31
celebrity kind of yeah
26:33
cave of roses is a misleading title
26:36
they all have misleading names torture
26:37
equipments because you very rarely get
26:39
one called the excruciating foot cutter
26:41
off a thing there's one called the pair
26:42
of anguish oh yeah which is uh
26:45
something's a piece of metal right and
26:46
it gets put into your mouth and then i
26:48
think it's expanded and it it hurts your
26:50
daughter
26:57
yeah
26:58
if a judge has a bit of an eye for the
26:59
amateur dramatic side of things he said
27:01
i sentence you to eat a pear
27:03
of
27:04
anguish people make messes into weird
27:07
things and i think i sent you something
27:08
recently done of um brian blaser's face
27:10
was turned into a maze slash crop circle
27:13
that's right yes pretty great yeah um in
27:15
the november 2004 election america a
27:18
farmer carved giant faces of john kerry
27:21
and president bush into his corn field
27:23
in pleasant grove in utah which i just
27:25
think when farmers do that you're
27:27
ruining your crops right yeah yeah they
27:29
do it for um to bring in tourists and
27:31
stuff don't they dragon they make
27:37
formerly known as pleasant grove
27:39
[Laughter]
27:43
by studying sheep in mazes they found
27:46
that when left to their own devices
27:48
sheep tend to turn to the left
27:52
when left at their own devices when
27:53
they're not constantly being bothered
27:55
will you just leave me alone for a bit
27:57
so i can think
27:59
okay i'm going to go left
28:04
you can make an infinite maze in a
28:07
finite room if you use virtual reality
28:10
and they've made these particular types
28:12
of virtual reality it is but it's quite
28:15
clever they've made these particular
28:16
types of virtual reality and the
28:18
illusion is so strong that people keep
28:20
walking around and they don't realize
28:22
they're going around in circles so
28:23
you're walking around in one room but it
28:25
feels like you've walked miles but
28:27
actually you haven't that's okay
28:31
that's because i saw a thing online
28:33
about a japanese janitor who had drawn a
28:36
maze did you read about this yeah i do
28:38
kind of remember it his daughter dug it
28:40
up in amongst his papers just found it
28:42
it's just it was but it was a piece of
28:43
paper and
28:45
she put it online and everyone listening
28:47
if you if you want to see something
28:49
amazing just go look at it it's the most
28:50
intricate it's and she sells it now she
28:52
sells prints of it because it's so
28:54
beautiful and when you said infinite and
28:57
it was in virtual yeah i kind of thought
28:58
oh no when you look at this this looks
29:00
like it just goes on you know when
29:01
people say like the coastlines are it's
29:03
the idea of fractals so that the closer
29:05
you look in at something it just gets
29:07
more and more complicated so it's just
29:08
infinite in terms of yeah wow but to be
29:11
fair i bet that the corridors were
29:14
pretty dirty
29:15
[Laughter]
29:18
no one can find anything in the school
29:20
anymore
29:20
[Laughter]
29:22
i found out about ways you can navigate
29:24
if you are lost just in an urban area
29:26
okay one way one great way of doing it
29:28
um satellite dishes almost all point in
29:30
the same direction in britain they
29:32
almost all point to the southeast wow
29:34
yeah also going downhill is normally
29:36
towards the river
29:37
or the coast if you're in a
29:39
um and if you're lost in the morning you
29:42
can find a station by going against the
29:44
flow of people because everyone's going
29:45
to work from the station if you're in
29:47
the center of town
29:48
and if you're lost oh you might be going
29:49
towards a huge fire
29:51
yes
29:52
yeah
29:53
it's not a perfect system
29:54
[Laughter]
29:56
let's end with some stupid reasons for
29:58
calling 911 or 999. okay um there was a
30:01
man who received a letter asking him to
30:03
attend a hospital appointment on tuesday
30:05
the 6th of february and he called 999 to
30:08
tell them that tuesday wasn't the sixth
30:13
uh yeah so i think the cornish uh police
30:15
force released a top ten list of the
30:16
most ridiculous emergency calls they'd
30:18
have and i think three of them were bird
30:20
related and uh so one of them was a
30:22
woman saying i can see a really rare
30:24
bird sitting on top of a telegraph pole
30:26
who should i ring
30:28
um i read a thing on it's doing the
30:30
rounds on the internet at the moment
30:31
it's not particularly funny um because
30:33
it was a lady in distress but it was a
30:35
really interesting thing where she
30:37
called up 999 or 911 and she goes hi i'd
30:40
like to just put in an order for a pizza
30:43
ham and cheese she said something
30:44
pepperoni and they go sorry ma'am this
30:46
is this is the police she was yeah i
30:48
know i'd love to get a ham and cheese
30:49
please so please and they go what uh
30:52
sorry you know this is the police yep so
30:54
can you can you uh do you need me to
30:55
tell you my location or do you know have
30:57
you got and they go do you know is there
30:59
something going on there yes there is
31:00
yep uh how long will that be
31:02
um okay man we'll we'll just find your
31:04
location we'll be there very soon yep
31:05
quick hurry um we'll we were very hungry
31:08
kind of thing like she kept
31:09
becoming the famous phone call that uh
31:11
that the guy who took the phone call
31:13
released
31:14
it was a domestic abuse call and
31:16
they and they tracked and they worked
31:18
out that that guy had got in trouble
31:19
before twice for domestic abuse so they
31:21
were like this is definitely a sincere
31:22
call yes that is really yeah and well
31:24
done for the operators realizing yes
31:26
yeah yeah in june of this year a woman
31:28
in birmingham phoned 999 because she was
31:30
unhappy with how many sprinkles she had
31:32
been given on her ice cream
31:34
and they were all on the wrong side as
31:35
well maybe she found 99
31:42
okay that's it that's all of our facts
31:44
thank you very much for listening if you
31:46

you goodbye on to me
32:33
you

=37
00:00
we run it on qi a few years ago yeah um
00:02
which was
00:03
there's no such thing as a fish there's
00:04
no such thing as a fish no seriously
00:06
it's in
00:06
the oxford dictionary of underwater life
00:10
it says it right there first paragraph
00:11
no such thing as a fish
00:18
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:20
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:22
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:24
covent garden
00:25
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
00:26
here with anna jaczynski andy murray and
00:29
james harkin
00:30
and once again we've gathered around the
00:31
microphone with our four favorite facts
00:33
from the last seven days and in no
00:35
particular order
00:36
here we go starting with fact number one
00:40
and that is jacinsky yeah my fact this
00:43
week is that
00:44
in 1874 there was a plan to transport
00:47
dead bodies from all over europe to
00:49
mount vesuvius and throw them
00:51
in is this the plan of a super villain
00:54
well
00:55
maybe maybe so it's reported in a couple
00:57
of newspaper articles from the time
00:59
there's one article in the daily gazette
01:01
for middlesbrough
01:02
uh which describes how an american
01:05
company
01:06
has got some capital to erect uh
01:09
railways or like have trains running all
01:12
over europe
01:13
and it takes people who have died who
01:15
want to be cremated in mount vesuvius
01:16
and it runs them up mount vesuvius and
01:18
then it tosses them
01:19
into the burning uh lava below
01:23
and this so i can't find any
01:27
evidence of this i can't find that the
01:28
company ever happened but
01:30
it seems strange that it would only be
01:31
reported in the middlesbrough that seems
01:33
a bit weird
01:34
um it's also reported in the new york
01:36
times in the same year okay
01:38
so it just tilts you in as the train
01:40
passes
01:41
it just sort of tips the carriages over
01:43
the edge and then they tilt back on well
01:45
i think the train probably stops at the
01:46
top because then the other article it
01:47
mentions that there would be some sort
01:48
of a chapel built
01:50
at the top of mount vesuvius where you
01:51
could have a small funeral service
01:53
before oh yeah
01:54
before tipping your family member into
01:56
the be better if the tracks went
01:58
actually over the caldera
02:00
and then just tip them out as it was or
02:02
just like the if the bottom just opened
02:04
up yeah
02:04
you just dropped them out is there
02:05
always lava at the bottom no there's not
02:07
see it's that's that's a weird thing
02:09
that they always say with
02:10
throwing people into volcanoes i like
02:12
that this is what they always say
02:15
if there's an active volcano yeah the
02:17
fumes from a volcano are enough to kill
02:19
you so anyone trying to throw someone
02:21
into a volcano
02:22
would die immediately purely just off
02:24
the back of it no no you could do it at
02:25
a certain point so
02:26
uh there was one more source which from
02:28
1878 which was just before vesuvius had
02:31
an eruption i think it was like vesuvius
02:32
was getting ready
02:38
they were very european the local papers
02:41
um and i think it was sort of bubbling
02:43
and waiting to erupt and that's the
02:44
ideal moment that's when you want to
02:46
catch it
02:46
there's a really funny letter that was
02:48
written to um
02:50
the new york times around this time
02:52
about this idea
02:53
and it says it's recently occurred to
02:56
certain thoughtful ingenious persons
02:57
that the constant fire maintained in the
02:59
crater of vesuvius generates an enormous
03:01
amount of heat which is wholly wasted
03:03
occasionally a native italian has
03:05
inadvertently slipped into the volcano
03:07
and has vanished so suddenly and
03:09
completely that not even a trace of
03:11
garlic could be centered in the air
03:13
and nothing but a silent hand organ and
03:15
a bereaved monkey remained to recall
03:18
the fact that a citizen of free italy
03:20
has flashed into flame and
03:22
dissipated in the gases and it goes on
03:24
because it's not just racist against the
03:26
italians
03:26
this is the new york times even the
03:28
stoutest british tourist who has toppled
03:30
into the crater while searching for a
03:32
good place to boil a tea kettle
03:34
has disappeared before he could fairly
03:36
mention his purpose of writing to the
03:38
times newspaper and denouncing the
03:39
neglect of the local authorities to rail
03:41
in the crater
03:42
well to be fair they've got us to a t
03:43
haven't they yeah they've
03:48
i know sometimes we think journalism is
03:50
always getting worse
03:51
but i think there we have definite proof
03:54
that it sometimes gets better as well
03:55
yeah i don't know i think it's quite
03:58
amusingly reported garlic isn't an
04:00
italian
04:00
trope an italian filling and not even
04:02
his baguette
04:04
and stripey jersey remained on the
04:05
outside nor his trademark
04:07
beret and there's just one more part
04:09
from this letter which is good and which
04:11
the newspaper article reports as well
04:12
which is one of the advantages
04:13
of this service this funeral service is
04:16
that
04:16
um mourners who've seen the remains of
04:18
their loved ones comfortably cremated in
04:20
the finest natural furnace in europe
04:22
can straightaway distract their minds
04:24
and delay their grief by enjoying the
04:26
view from the summit of the mountain
04:27
and making a subsequent visit to all
04:28
points of interest in naples in the
04:30
vicinity
04:31
and the the newspaper actually reports
04:33
that you'd get uh the train ride would
04:35
come with a voucher to spend in naples
04:37
once you got there
04:39
i think this is really cool speaking of
04:41
magma so there's a new project to
04:43
see if we can drill further than we've
04:44
drilled before into the earth and
04:46
see if we can get basically to where the
04:49
magma starts
04:50
and isn't it weird that the furthest
04:53
we've ever sent an object away from this
04:55
earth
04:56
is 20 billion miles so now i think it's
04:58
the voyager wasn't it that was sent out
04:59
in the 70s it's now 20 billion miles
05:01
away
05:02
the furthest we've ever got into the
05:03
earth and it's not for want of trying
05:05
is 12 kilometers it's really hot down
05:08
there but it's really cold in space
05:11
yeah yeah it's just because there's
05:12
stuff there though the geologists are
05:13
just saying
05:14
in space you've got no stuff people act
05:16
like it's such a big deal but actually
05:17
it's mostly
05:18
space there are a couple of molecules
05:19
per cubic meter in space that's true but
05:21
that's
05:22
much much fewer than in the ground where
05:25
there are
05:25
loads of molecules literally every
05:27
centimeter that's the molecule
05:29
[Laughter]
05:30
the slate.com official explainer
05:34
question of the year for 2007
05:36
was why don't we drop medical waste and
05:38
nuclear waste into active volcanoes okay
05:41
and what was the answer because they'll
05:42
blow up nuclear waste all over
05:44
southern italy basically yeah you put it
05:48
in
05:48
it wouldn't it's not hot enough to stop
05:50
it from being radioactive um but it
05:52
would just kind of fire it straight back
05:54
into the atmosphere
05:55
so we'd have a nuclear volcanic eruption
05:57
sorry and that got question of the year
05:59
because i think that's one of the
06:00
silliest questions i've ever heard
06:03
i read though that one of the issues
06:04
with a volcano eruption
06:06
is that obviously over the months after
06:08
it lava can just still travel towards
06:10
towns and they don't know how to stop it
06:12
they don't know what to do right
06:13
one of the things that they tried back
06:15
long time ago was they bombed
06:17
the lava so they literally bombed the
06:20
area of where the lava was going into
06:21
wow george patton did that the idea was
06:24
to divert
06:24
the uh direction of the if you can get
06:27
it all in a channel that yeah
06:28
so he launched a bombing attack on lava
06:31
wow
06:32
there's a volcanic island called
06:34
ferdinand which is off the coast of
06:35
sicily
06:36
and it is only above sea level when it's
06:39
erupting
06:40
so normally it's not and so it's not on
06:41
very many maps and so in 1986
06:44
the amer us air force flew over and
06:46
bombed it thinking it was
06:48
um a libyan submarine oh really
06:52
yeah there's that volcano in tanzania
06:53
isn't there that erupts
06:55
black lava it's the only example of
06:58
of a volcanic erupting substance in the
07:00
world and it's just because it's made of
07:01
uh
07:02
carbon and tight instead of silicate
07:04
silicate materials but um
07:05
yeah the lavas so it's very normal
07:08
exactly
07:08
it can run at about 500 degrees celsius
07:10
which is much much cooler than normal
07:12
lava
07:12
um this is really cool sicilians used to
07:15
use the slopes of mount etna to keep
07:17
their food cold okay because there's
07:20
snow all over the slopes of mount etna
07:22
so they use the caves in the side of the
07:24
mountain to keep fruit cold and things
07:26
like that and lemons and
07:27
yeah didn't nero take snow down there
07:29
and make like an ice cream kind of thing
07:31
he probably took credit for it didn't he
07:33
you know nero
07:35
he tramples over intellectual property
07:37
rights of others
07:39
um the land speed record on a bicycle
07:42
was set
07:43
on a on a volcano was it yeah
07:46
it was on ciro negro which is in
07:49
nicaragua i think
07:51
and it's like a really steep slope and
07:53
so people go down there quite often for
07:55
fun
07:56
and this was done by a frenchman called
07:58
eric barron
07:59
known as the red baron and he reached
08:01
107 miles per hour
08:03
before his carbon fiber mountain bike
08:05
snapped in two
08:06
sending him tumbling down the last
08:08
section of the mountain he broke five
08:09
ribs dislocates her shoulder and tore
08:11
muscles in his hands
08:14
but got the record worth it do we know
08:17
yeah the thing i always see is when
08:19
people are trying to break speed records
08:20
and that
08:21
for example cycling you cycle along but
08:23
you suck along with an enormous truck
08:24
driving ahead of you really
08:26
and you're really close behind it so you
08:28
have to assess the speed quite carefully
08:30
and it's to get rid of the air
08:31
resistance and all that
08:32
so that's if you're if you're pedaling
08:34
whereas this guy is just going down a
08:35
massive mountain
08:37
yeah it's more like plummeting really
08:38
yeah it feels like cheating as well
08:40
that's true um i was actually going to
08:42
save this fact for later in the podcast
08:43
because my facts about running but
08:45
running is easier supposedly i read this
08:48
earlier today i couldn't believe it
08:49
running is easier at about 20 degrees
08:52
celsius when the air temperature is
08:54
there or higher
08:55
because there are fewer molecules to get
08:57
in your way as you run
08:59
much easier in space much more difficult
09:01
when you're going through the area
09:05
i don't believe this is that much
09:06
different i only lost that one because i
09:08
think there are a lot of molecules out
09:09
today
09:10
yeah my lane was full of molecules to be
09:12
fair
09:15
[Applause]
09:17
okay time for fact number two and that
09:19
is harken okay my fact this week is that
09:22
in 2010 an abandoned wastewater
09:25
treatment plant in baltimore
09:26
was found to be home to an estimated 107
09:30
million spiders with a density of 35
09:34
176 spiders per cubic meter
09:37
i just feel sorry for the work
09:38
experience boy who had to count them
09:41
because he didn't have a fear of spiders
09:42
before but he does now
09:45
yeah it was an estimated number and then
09:47
they've kind of extrapolated that to get
09:49
the number
09:49
and they were all alive they're all
09:51
alive yeah they are great though some of
09:52
me
09:53
can catch and eat fish i think they've
09:54
just found out they found spiders come
09:56
that's why this can
09:57
they find out there are at least five
09:58
species of spider which one of them is
10:00
the dolomites spider which can
10:02
catch fish the fish are on average twice
10:04
their size
10:06
and they anchor their hind legs to like
10:08
a stone in a in a lake or a river
10:10
and then they grab the fish with their
10:11
front back that's amazing it's pretty
10:12
impressive
10:13
yeah that is really cool um i read that
10:16
they found not too long ago the
10:17
oldest spider web ever okay and it was
10:20
in
10:20
it was in east sussex i think and it was
10:23
in it was in amber it was
10:25
oh yeah yeah it was like from dinosaur
10:27
days and they were they were studying it
10:29
and so i asked a definitely very stupid
10:31
question
10:32
by all means yep all right cool yeah i'm
10:35
learning to ask now
10:36
um why are we not for the things that we
10:39
want to preserve
10:40
let's say for a long time in the future
10:41
just coating it in amber you know like
10:43
imagine if dinosaurs covered themselves
10:45
in amber we might have a full dinosaur
10:47
i actually think that's brilliant do you
10:49
yeah
10:50
i do james doesn't i don't know where we
10:53
would get enough amber because obviously
10:54
it's
10:55
low quantities i'm sure we have better
10:57
ways of keeping things like
10:58
i'm sure i just smelled that but just
11:00
from history the only things that have
11:01
survived through
11:03
that are in a perfect state are things
11:05
in amber
11:06
and that just seems like an obvious time
11:08
capsule of a
11:09
of a thing okay that's cool
11:15
um so why do spiders not get stuck on
11:17
their own webs do you know that
11:19
um oh do they have some kind of
11:20
lubrication uh around their legs
11:22
well nobody is 100 sure but what it
11:25
seems like
11:25
is that they leave their um glue on the
11:28
webs
11:29
in only little blobs all the way around
11:31
and they just simply tiptoe around it so
11:33
they don't stand on their own bits of
11:35
glue
11:35
and if they do stand on it then it's a
11:37
little bit of a pain like getting
11:39
you know chewing gum on your shoe or
11:40
whatever but it's not that bad um but
11:42
when a fly comes into it he hits like 50
11:44
blobs at once and so
11:45
that's what makes them stuck i think
11:47
it's such a big amount so it's kind of
11:49
like uh
11:50
in a bond film or something where you
11:51
have to avoid all the lasers if you're a
11:53
fly
11:53
like catherine zeta jones in that film
11:55
he has to creep around them
11:57
a maze of glue entrepreneurs yeah great
12:00
film yeah
12:01
uh so the ogre face spider called as
12:02
such because it has massive eyes which
12:04
means it can't go out in daylight
12:05
because it's much too bright for it
12:06
um but anyway it is pretty ugly and uh
12:09
it does this really clever thing so you
12:10
reminded me when you said the spiders
12:12
dropped little droplets on their web
12:14
first of all it spins a web between its
12:16
front legs so it acts as a sort of
12:18
like a fly capture so it will hang down
12:21
from its back legs
12:22
above wherever it wants to stay to catch
12:25
the flies and then it swings this
12:26
web or net that is maybe between its
12:28
front legs at its prey and catches them
12:30
and the way that it knows when to swing
12:32
is it creates a target by
12:34
doing a little white poo on the ground
12:37
and it leaves a little white blob of
12:38
feces as a target
12:39
and as soon as is in the dark as soon as
12:41
it sees an insect of some sort across
12:43
this bit of poo
12:44
drops down upon it gets it in its net
12:46
wow that consumes it
12:48
very comfortably very clever yeah what
12:50
do you reckon
12:51
the lifespan of a spider is surely 10
12:54
years
12:55
10 years so i don't know the answer
12:58
what i do know is i know the the as so
13:01
far as we know the oldest living spider
13:03
so the spider with the longest lifespan
13:05
okay 28 years
13:07
it's in mexico they had one that was
13:09
captured in 1935 it's the world's oldest
13:11
spider
13:12
uh and it's 28. and what's its secret
13:15
does it drink a lot of milk or
13:17
bird eating bird eating okay i eat
13:20
birds i smoke 20 cigarettes a day i
13:21
don't exercise i don't know how i do it
13:25
there was i was reading about the oldest
13:27
um recorded person
13:28
who lived to be 122 and she died in
13:30
1997.
13:32
yeah and she quit smoking i think five
13:35
years before she died
13:36
so she was 117 she went okay come on
13:39
this has been enough
13:40
but i quite enjoyed i put dip at this on
13:41
twitter the other day she was born in
13:43
the year that edison
13:45
made the first sound transmission and
13:47
she died in the year that hansen
13:49
released
13:49
[Music]
13:52
was that what did for her in the end she
13:54
was the one who said that i only have
13:56
one wrinkle and i'm sitting on it yeah
13:58
that's her she was cracking so just to
14:01
put the original
14:02
fact into context which is that there
14:04
are 107 million spiders here
14:06
with a density of 35 000 per cubic meter
14:09
um the standard amount of um
14:12
spiders that we think are in like a
14:14
british field would be
14:16
about 49 per square meter wow that's
14:19
quite a lot though it's still quite a
14:20
lot
14:21
yeah that was a study done in 1958 in a
14:24
sussex meadow
14:25
in the 1950s if you look at photos they
14:26
were actually overwhelmed with spiders
14:30
that's why everyone's got their mouths
14:32
shut in early photographs is to stop the
14:34
spiders getting in
14:35
yeah so is this a case of you know when
14:39
they say if you leave
14:40
um rats and they breed in the breed in
14:42
the breed or any is is this a case of
14:44
just a total isolated
14:46
sort of spider just farm i think they're
14:48
just small oh they
14:49
the baltimore one yeah um yeah that's
14:51
basically it
14:52
um they had no predators there um they
14:55
were allowed to just create as much as
14:57
they wanted and
14:58
eventually there was 107 million of them
15:00
it's extraordinary
15:01
you need a massive class wouldn't you to
15:02
put that out yeah a big shoe
15:05
what have they done with it do we know
15:06
the way it was worded i think i glanced
15:08
that article they
15:09
it said um they the people at the
15:11
baltimore wastewater treatment plant put
15:13
out a call for
15:14
extreme spider help which isn't an
15:17
understatement
15:19
i think the grammar is different stream
15:21
spider semicolon
15:22
help yeah do you think spiderman ever
15:24
got any false calls of people wanting
15:26
him to just get rid of spiders
15:29
guys i'm dealing with some proper crime
15:31
here batman
15:32
same thing that's true yeah catwoman now
15:34
still not married okay
15:40
time for fact number three and that's my
15:42
fact my fact this week is that according
15:44
to the vatican the greatest pop album of
15:46
all time
15:47
is revolver by the beatles
15:50
i would have thought they would choose
15:51
abby road personally but shows what i
15:54
know
15:59
that is created with the devotional hum
16:03
according to the vatican well it's the
16:04
vatican newspaper
16:06
who did a um they published a list of
16:08
what they consider to be the best albums
16:10
of all time
16:11
is the vatican newspaper called the
16:12
prali mail
16:13
[Music]
16:15
it's called uh romano i can't pronounce
16:19
it
16:19
which is a very funny pun in italian
16:21
[Laughter]
16:23
the weird thing is first off the beatles
16:25
were the ones who
16:27
more famous in any band in the world for
16:29
having an association
16:30
with a fight with the church when john
16:32
lennon said that the beatles were bigger
16:34
yeah than christianity or is it because
16:36
of jesus but i thought he said sorry
16:37
then jesus
16:38
but he also said christianity would um
16:40
shrink and fade away
16:41
in that very same way but i thought he
16:43
said it despairingly i think he
16:45
wasn't i didn't think he was celebrating
16:47
the fact that they're bigger than jesus
16:48
he was it
16:49
didn't matter it was the very notion of
16:51
what he said i mean it led to
16:52
uh people were burning their records in
16:54
the streets throwing all their
16:55
merchandise it was a huge backlash
16:57
a huge backlash it was one of the
16:58
biggest sort of moments of their career
17:01
that they had to recover from wow but so
17:03
it's it's interesting they've given him
17:04
a pardon now they've pardoned him for
17:06
saying what he said they they said the
17:08
beatles were satanic music
17:09
but the list is just i mean it's pretty
17:11
it's just a mismatch you don't expect
17:13
the vatican to be saying the beatles
17:15
david crosby pink floyd fleetwood mac
17:18
donald fagan donald fagan is the lead
17:21
singer steely dan so not even a steely
17:23
dan album
17:24
a solo word yeah spin-off it's like the
17:26
equivalent of
17:27
like nominating a john bon jovi solo
17:30
album and not a bon jovi album like it's
17:32
just a very
17:33
obscure choice so i think this newspaper
17:35
is trying to hip
17:36
up isn't it i've read the uh the vatican
17:39
thought it was getting a bit dated all
17:41
this we
17:41
still love the hymns oh god we we like
17:44
our big long robes and our cross
17:45
necklaces
17:46
i think there was a movement in within
17:48
this newspaper to say look we're
17:50
with it guys and so now they report they
17:52
so they review harry potter which is
17:54
again
17:54
has had issues with the church and they
17:56
said that the half blood prince was good
17:58
because it showed a clear line of
17:59
demarcation
18:00
between good and evil that's interesting
18:03
because there the vatican's exorcist
18:05
uh really didn't like it he came out
18:08
satanic
18:09
yeah he also thinks that yoga is satanic
18:12
i think yeah
18:12
i think he needs to he needs to get with
18:14
it he's 89.
18:18
probably too late there was a big
18:19
feature about this paper in the guardian
18:21
and it said that
18:22
until 2007 this was kind of the old days
18:24
for
18:25
los angeles there were two kinds of
18:27
articles um
18:28
the first one was those in which a
18:30
vatican department had
18:32
definitely directly intervened in and
18:34
they had a code for that which was three
18:36
asterisks placed above or near the
18:39
article
18:40
um but the other kind the combination
18:42
didn't have the asterisks on were those
18:43
which have been written by
18:44
uh la zervatore's staff but they were so
18:46
careful not to embarrass anyone that
18:48
these articles were totally unreadably
18:49
boring
18:50
so you had a choice of reading either
18:52
propaganda or tedium yeah but that's
18:54
kind of changed now they've
18:55
i believe they've shaken it up a bit um
18:56
but but it's not it's not the
18:58
it's not exactly the official voice of
18:59
the church is it it's a weird place
19:01
between
19:02
yeah official and unofficial it's it's
19:04
allowed it's allowed in the vatican
19:06
it's a paper that's kind of seen as a
19:08
daily paper there
19:09
yeah and it seems to have a lot of it's
19:11
it's the place where if if the pope has
19:13
something to say
19:13
there'll be the people to publish it
19:15
it's very much the middlesbrough gazette
19:17
[Laughter]
19:19
do you guys know about the apostolic
19:21
penitentiary system
19:22
been through it mate yeah yeah that's on
19:25
our that's the title of our spin-off
19:26
podcast
19:27
[Laughter]
19:31
no what is it so it's this tribunal it's
19:33
the oldest
19:34
um it's the oldest established body of
19:37
the holy see its existence 1179
19:39
and it's where you go when you've
19:40
committed a sin that's too heinous to be
19:42
forgiven by a priest so if you've got to
19:44
confess something you go to confession
19:45
the priest is like whoa
19:47
out of my pay grade then you go to the
19:50
apostolic penitentiary
19:51
tribunal and there are five sins that
19:53
are two evil
19:54
shall we guess what they are yeah go on
19:56
i'll go for murder oh no murder is easy
19:58
genocide even is you can get a genocide
20:00
forgiven by your standard priest
20:02
yeah you can watch yeah your what your
20:05
local
20:06
how many hail marys do you have to say
20:07
for that look it takes a couple of weeks
20:09
reciting in your roots so three of them
20:12
are cruising the pope
20:15
what's putting your finger up
20:18
um maybe defacing his rings
20:24
uh killing the pope you can't kill the
20:26
pope that's understandable yeah
20:28
um there are three which just apply to
20:29
people who want to work for the church
20:31
so if you're a priest and you've been in
20:32
any way involved in an abortion then you
20:34
have to go here to confess it right
20:35
to directly to the pope um and if you're
20:37
a priest who's been confessed to and
20:39
then you've broken your
20:41
oath not to share your confession and
20:42
then the only other one that normal
20:44
people like us can commit and we'd have
20:45
to be sent to the vatican is if we um
20:48
deface the eucharist what do you mean a
20:50
local church if i get body of christ and
20:52
i drop it
20:53
i think trump is dropping it right you
20:56
can play the five second rule
20:58
that's probably the three day rule in
20:59
the catholic church
21:02
so it's more if you're doing it
21:04
intentionally there was a scientist in
21:06
america recently for instance who drove
21:07
a rusty nail for a bit of communion
21:09
wafer and i think the church was pretty
21:10
pissed off with him about that
21:12
i like that um i just like the idea of
21:14
the pope listening to pop music i don't
21:16
think he does it's obviously just this
21:17
paper that's saying it but there are a
21:19
lot of i like when you read about
21:20
people who are in high power positions
21:23
and they
21:24
admit to liking certain things so the
21:26
dalai lama is very good mates with the
21:28
red hot chili peppers and the beastie
21:30
boys
21:31
which is just such a weird mismatch but
21:33
he recognized that he could put
21:34
free tibet concerts on used the power of
21:36
these pop stars and he realized they're
21:38
the people who spoke to people so he
21:39
became very good mates with them
21:41
um david cameron do you know what his
21:42
favorite album is coldplay
21:44
album no he's he said that it was dark
21:47
side of the moon
21:48
by pink floyd oh yeah but he everyone
21:50
knows that that's a lie because everyone
21:52
knows that his favorite album is the
21:53
queen is dead
21:54
by the smiths but he can't say that now
21:56
that he's prime minister though he had
21:58
constantly said that before becoming
22:00
prime minister interesting
22:01
then when he did say he loves the smith
22:03
both morrissey and
22:04
johnny marr came out saying you are not
22:07
allowed to like us
22:09
banned david yeah that's ridiculous it's
22:11
not really up to them
22:12
i know i just like them coming out and
22:13
saying it's ours and you're not allowed
22:15
to like this
22:16
all musicians come out and ban
22:17
politicians from liking their music
22:19
after a certain age you shouldn't have a
22:20
favorite album you should have a
22:21
favorite
22:22
i don't know symphony what's your
22:24
favorite symphony andy i haven't reached
22:25
that age yet
22:28
beethoven's seventh is my favorite album
22:30
[Laughter]
22:33
on uh niche newspapers yeah can i tell
22:36
you about uh my favorite one which
22:38
is uh jail mail which is a relatively
22:41
new magazine and it's for
22:42
everyone in the prison system oh yeah
22:44
there are two others which are called
22:45
inside time and converse
22:47
as in convict and verse so converse
22:50
um i think the daily jail would have
22:52
been better but i'm not gonna you know
22:54
uh i think it's a weekly anyway so uh
22:58
but anyway it was it was hugely popular
23:00
and it's
23:01
uh it's had to double its print run for
23:03
its for its next edition
23:04
and um yeah it's it has advice on what
23:07
to do when you're up before the governor
23:09
and uh details of uh reading projects
23:12
and how to find employment and i just is
23:13
it written by
23:14
people and by prisoners i think a lot of
23:16
it is yeah common use of the world
23:19
yeah yeah a lot of journalists in there
23:22
uh i just think that's cool
23:23
um can i just on the beatles yeah i
23:25
didn't realize that apparently their
23:26
concerts
23:27
all just smelled of urine and if you
23:30
looked around the aisles you saw women's
23:31
pee and bob gildoff has
23:33
attested to this so this is because
23:35
women used to turn up and wet themselves
23:36
so excited
23:37
these days the rolling stones gig smell
23:39
of urine but that's the act
23:42
[Applause]
23:44
okay let's move on to our final facts
23:46
and that is
23:47
andrew hunter murray my fact is that for
23:49
the first
23:50
50 years of the olympics the only event
23:52
was the 200 meter sprint
23:54
which must have made the two weeks of
23:56
the competition extremely boring in the
23:58
most part
23:59
um is this the modern olympics no this
24:01
is the ancient greek olympics
24:02
right so this is from a book i've just
24:04
got called eureka everything you always
24:06
wanted to know about the ancient greeks
24:07
but were afraid to ask by
24:09
a guy called peter jones and it looks
24:11
like it's full of
24:12
good things and it basically says for
24:14
the first 50 years it was the olympic
24:15
game not the big games
24:17
which is a nice way of putting it um and
24:19
then after 50 years they added the 400
24:21
meter race but the cool thing is
24:22
if you won it the entire olympiad was
24:25
named after you for the next four years
24:26
so it would become the kevin olympics or
24:27
whatever that was instead of the athens
24:29
olympics
24:29
isn't that great really cool the usain
24:31
bolt olympics yeah
24:33
and then they started adding funkier
24:34
things later like boxing and wrestling
24:36
and chariot racing
24:37
uh after a couple after 200 years they
24:39
had a race in armor
24:40
oh that sounds good yeah that's great i
24:43
read that that was
24:44
the race in armor uh the only body
24:46
coverings was a helmet and shin guards
24:48
wow that was what the razor and the rest
24:50
of it was completely naked okay i wasn't
24:52
imagining that at all i was thinking
24:54
big heavy plates of armor so it's a
24:56
challenge like american football or
24:57
whatever but the 200 meters wasn't even
24:59
200 meters was it i think it was 192.
25:01
yeah um so that's true did they call it
25:04
the 200 meters before we just called it
25:05
that
25:06
we we've that's an approximation it was
25:08
called uh
25:09
stadion which is where we get the word
25:10
stadium from and there was a measurement
25:12
of a stage based on that
25:14
yeah okay cool and there were other
25:15
games as well i didn't realize this
25:16
there was the pythian games in delphi
25:18
it was really short games
25:22
uh and then games and uh and if you
25:25
wanted the games at delphi you got
25:27
laurel obviously at the olympics you got
25:28
olive uh
25:29
at the isp3 in games you got pine and at
25:31
the name games it was celery which you
25:33
won
25:33
which i find very pleasing um where the
25:35
olympics were held in 2012 in london
25:38
uh that borough knew him uh is the most
25:40
physically inactive borough in the whole
25:42
of the uk
25:43
wow that's good yeah that's where i live
25:46
um
25:46
is it yeah well i live i live in hackney
25:49
but i'm literally i'm 10 minutes away
25:50
from stratford
25:51
um 39.17 of people in um take no
25:55
exercise at all
25:57
where's numero but stratford's it's 10
25:59
minutes away from where you live
26:00
yeah but i've never heard he couldn't be
26:02
asked to go there
26:04
in the 1932 olympic 3000 meter
26:07
steeplechase it was actually run over
26:09
three thousand four hundred meters
26:10
because an official lost count of the
26:12
number of laps
26:14
that's so good that's so good yeah you'd
26:17
feel and you'd you'd be
26:18
you'd realize soon after you'd forgotten
26:21
i don't know how many they've done yeah
26:24
and you'd wonder if
26:25
anyone else would spot yeah oh the poor
26:27
guy
26:28
well the runners as they're coming in
26:30
and they're going through the pineapple
26:31
yeah they're looking at you and you're
26:32
not saying anything like one
26:34
another well you just try and bluff it
26:36
out wouldn't you because you'd know if
26:38
you tr
26:38
if you stop them too early you think i
26:39
definitely don't want to stop them too
26:40
early because they'll really know
26:42
but if i make them do another lap it'll
26:44
look like it's their fault for being
26:45
slow
26:45
yeah so did the was the one the person
26:48
who crossed the boundary
26:49
at the right time or the person who
26:50
finished at the wrong i think it was the
26:52
same person but it would have been at
26:53
the end
26:54
oh my gosh especially because and
26:56
everyone must have put on a real burst
26:57
to get to the finishing line and then
27:00
yeah no no whistle no crowds cheering
27:03
just
27:04
that would be a great olympic race
27:05
though we're not telling you how many
27:07
laps
27:08
would that be great that's a brilliant
27:10
yeah sometimes it's one sometimes it's
27:13
45. yeah that's a really good idea okay
27:15
so
27:16
and then we put them all in amber at the
27:18
end
27:22
so there's no adequate training yeah for
27:24
it yeah cool
27:25
well that is the spirit of amateurism
27:27
which they would want
27:29
they wouldn't they weren't they weren't
27:30
amateurs from the start in the illinois
27:32
no they weren't they got loads of money
27:33
didn't they in the ancient greek limits
27:34
i think someone's worked out
27:36
that um gaius appelius diocletes was
27:39
extremely good at winning money i think
27:40
in his olympic games and he won a lot of
27:42
events and
27:43
it's been worked out that he won what
27:45
would be the equivalent today of over 15
27:47
billion dollars in modern day cash
27:49
wow 15 billion just from winning a bunch
27:51
of olympic events
27:52
i think they work it out on the
27:54
percentage against like say for instance
27:57
someone in the army
27:58
yeah something that we can yes it's
28:00
really hard though
28:01
it's so hard doing that there are three
28:03
or four different ways of calculating it
28:04
anyway sorry it was like it was it was
28:06
enough to so he earned enough to pay the
28:08
entire salary of the whole roman army
28:10
for more than two months
28:11
so they could work out like that wow
28:13
which he didn't do they they got us
28:14
they
28:19
[Laughter]
28:22
do you hear an olympic steam joke yes
28:24
please uh
28:26
marcus was so slow in the races that the
28:28
groundsman locked him in for the night
28:30
because he thought he was a statue isn't
28:32
that good
28:36
um that's an ancient ancient
28:39
uh athletics joke yeah yeah oh i was
28:42
gonna say in 1908
28:43
uh when we hosted the london olympics
28:45
first of all we did say that was
28:46
obviously the first time we hosted it
28:47
and we weren't supposed to host it
28:48
the reason uh in fact fitting me in this
28:50
podcast that we didn't was because
28:52
i think uh somewhere in italy was
28:54
supposed to host it and vesuvius erupted
28:56
in 1906 so they couldn't so we stepped
28:58
in like the heroes that we are we then
29:00
cocked it up in a number of ways
29:01
so we included we had all the flags up
29:04
on poles around the stadium as you do
29:05
that was the first year that became
29:06
tradition
29:07
we had the chinese and japanese flag up
29:09
neither of which countries competed
29:11
we forgot to include the swedish and
29:13
american flags which were competing
29:15
so obviously the swedes were really
29:16
polite about that and like oh no don't
29:18
worry about it so we'll just never mind
29:20
and america brought their own flag and
29:22
their own poll and hoisted it up
29:24
themselves of course
29:27
it was sponsored by oxo by the way
29:29
olympic games
29:30
yeah it was actually sponsored by oxo
29:32
indian foot powder and odol mouthwash
29:34
fantastic things to be sponsored by was
29:36
it was that oxel
29:38
comma indian foot powder i don't think
29:40
it was used for that this isn't uh
29:42
was originally used to cure athletes
29:44
[Laughter]
29:47
no and we are announcing actually that
29:49
today is our first podcast that's
29:50
sponsored
29:51
by oxo indian foot powder
29:55
in india they have a thing called the
29:57
rural olympics
29:58
and they have three types of
30:00
competitions in there they have rural
30:01
games such as kabaddi or wrestling
30:04
modern sports such as athletics and
30:06
football and performing
30:08
sports such as acrobatics twisting an
30:10
iron rod by placing it on the adam's
30:12
apple
30:13
passing a tractor over the rib cage and
30:16
cracking a big stone by placing it on
30:18
the chest etcetera
30:20
letting a tractor go over your chest
30:22
yeah that's just one of the spots
30:24
how can you win at letting something
30:26
happen and you just
30:29
it's more of not losing a disappointment
30:32
after the tractor drives over your chest
30:33
and you look up and you see a judge
30:34
giving you a five five
30:38
my lungs have come back come on that's
30:40
why you got a five
30:41
[Laughter]
30:44
i have a fact this is really fun they
30:46
think that the starting position
30:48
for running races at the ancient greek
30:50
olympics was just standing up next to
30:52
each other yeah and with your arms
30:53
stretched out in front of you
30:56
as opposed to the crouching still what a
30:57
funny way of starting a race isn't that
30:59
brilliant
31:00
what it might work if you then push your
31:02
arms backwards and it might give you
31:03
some momentum yeah
31:04
get the molecule out of the way
31:06
[Laughter]
31:11
okay that's it that's all of our facts

00:04

00:24
weekly podcast coming to you this time
00:26
from brussels belgium
00:27
my name is ann treiber i'm sitting here
00:29
with three of the regular elves it's
00:30
andy murray anna chazinski and james
00:32
harkin
00:33
and we also have a special guest this
00:35
evening the great leaving skyra and once
00:37
again we've gathered around the
00:38
microphone with our four favorite facts
00:40
from the last seven days and in no
00:41
particular order here we go
00:44
okay fact number one starting with you
00:46
leavin
00:47
yes my fact is that um apparently
00:51
ants nests can get infested
00:54
by ants on
00:58
all ants nest infested by ants just by
01:00
definition
01:01
all the time they go where do they come
01:02
from no there's
01:04
there's a very small species of ants and
01:07
they're called the
01:08
thief ants they're smaller than a
01:09
millimeter and they live
01:11
inside the walls of the nests of bigger
01:14
ants
01:14
they just have small tunnels in the
01:17
walls of of ants nests
01:19
and then they sit there and they wait
01:20
and when there's food around and there's
01:21
no soldier ants they sneak out
01:23
they steal the food and then they run
01:24
back into the wall and the bigger ants
01:26
cannot follow them because the tunnels
01:28
are too small
01:29
wow that's ingenious uh how big were
01:31
they one millimeter
01:32
yeah a bit less than one millimeter yeah
01:34
wow are the other ants like i don't know
01:36
if i'm going crazy but i think we have
01:38
an ant problem
01:41
yeah they put they put poison around and
01:44
tell the children
01:44
[Laughter]
01:47
none of them can move so hard to have a
01:50
picnic in an ancestor
01:54
yeah so what have they ever caught them
01:57
the the thief ants yeah no i just mean
01:59
is it like a conspiracy theory in that
02:00
world it's like swear to god they're
02:02
here
02:02
look where was that bit of crumb i
02:04
brought back it's gone
02:06
well i i think every now and then one of
02:08
these soldier ants will will will
02:10
actually catch one and and eat it
02:12
apparently we you you all may have one
02:14
of these colonies events in your home
02:16
and you won't know they're there because
02:17
they're so small
02:18
and they can get into sealed packages of
02:20
food again because they
02:22
are so small wow i read that the
02:24
smallest
02:25
species of ants can are so small they
02:28
could live
02:28
inside the brain case of the larger
02:30
species of ant
02:32
wow like a colony of them could there's
02:34
one kind of
02:35
and called the acorn ant and they have
02:37
an entire nest
02:38
in one acorn whoa so there's
02:42
there's this there's a small animal it's
02:43
called an acorn weevil a very cute
02:46
little
02:46
bug and it um it eats the inside of
02:49
acorns when they're still on the tree so
02:51
it drills a little hole and then it's
02:52
it sucks out the inside and then it
02:54
falls down and so there's there's a
02:56
hollow acorn on the ground with a small
02:58
hole inside
02:58
and that's where these acorn ants go in
03:01
and they build an entire nest in one
03:02
acorn they're actually
03:04
they they can be found around belgium
03:06
and england so when when you walk around
03:08
and
03:08
you you see a an oak and you just pick
03:11
up
03:12
acorns you look for for the ones that
03:13
are in in the wet ground
03:15
and you crack them open like one in one
03:17
hundred will have a small nest of acorn
03:19
ants now
03:20
wow that's so cool there's an ant isn't
03:22
there do
03:23
is it bruneians that when they're
03:25
threatened
03:26
they're the ones that the worker
03:27
answered on the front line and they
03:29
explode their own heads
03:30
so that they spill a sticky brain goo to
03:33
slow down
03:34
whoever it is who's trying to attack
03:35
what they're like suicide ant bombers
03:37
yeah
03:37
yeah kamikaze ants wow yeah there's a
03:40
james and i we were talking about this
03:42
on the train
03:42
okay it's my favorite kind of answer
03:44
okay okay this is great my favorite
03:46
kind of ants are called door head ants
03:48
and they're called door head hands
03:50
because their
03:51
heads are doors yeah what do you what
03:54
are you every door in your house
03:58
no they have this amazing flat head it's
04:00
like a flat circle of their head
04:02
and they use it to plug holes in trees
04:05
and the other ants live inside the that
04:08
tree what
04:09
so wait why do you need to plug a hole
04:11
in to stop other people from coming in
04:13
that's how doors work that's amazing
04:16
but it's so funny because it's just one
04:18
of those cases of you're born
04:20
and that's what you do like there's
04:21
probably a door head ant sort of going
04:23
oh i want to be a poet when i'm older
04:24
dad
04:25
i'm afraid son i'm sorry your father was
04:28
a door your grandfather
04:31
nothing else not even a gate defense so
04:34
can i ask more about these tiny ants
04:36
um are they do they have any other homes
04:39
outside of
04:40
just infesting other nests or is it just
04:42
a really charmed life
04:44
it's well i i think it's it's an easy
04:46
life i think they're also found
04:48
outside of of other nests but they're
04:50
they're always looking for food and it's
04:52
just the easiest thing
04:53
some of them live next to um an ants
04:56
nest so not inside the walls but next to
04:58
it and have just one small tunnel going
05:00
to the other nest just to go back and
05:01
forth every now and then to the shop
05:03
wow have you heard there's a there's a
05:06
ant that has the s quickest slam
05:11
of jaws of all the animal kingdom is
05:13
that
05:14
i think it's the trapdoor it's the trap
05:15
door and yeah a lot of door and a lot of
05:18
door ants basically yeah door face dance
05:21
yeah
05:22
there's the swing door and there's the
05:24
revolving door
05:25
and that's good um but they what's
05:28
really exciting about them
05:29
is that they so they can slam really
05:32
quickly i think i wrote it down it was
05:33
something like 230 kilometers an hour
05:35
that's just really quick
05:37
um but what's really exciting is if
05:39
they're being attacked
05:40
they can use it as an escape an escape
05:42
mechanism
05:43
by slamming their mouth into the ground
05:45
and just launching themselves
05:47
yeah completely away from their prey i
05:49
think what they do is they kind of bite
05:50
the floor don't they and if the floor's
05:52
hard enough then it
05:53
fires them off yeah it's amazing
05:56
lobsters can swim backwards but not
05:58
forwards
05:58
what lobsters can walk in oh right
06:02
they're doing backstroke no they can
06:04
walk forwards but if they're in real
06:05
trouble
06:06
they have their whole they they flip
06:07
their tail under them
06:09
and that really really first and that
06:11
sort of jets water back uh forwards and
06:13
they are pushed back
06:14
so that's their escape mechanism but
06:15
they can never use it to swim forwards
06:17
it's really tragic
06:25
apparently in panama you can get ants to
06:28
clean your house
06:29
so if you go out there army ants in
06:31
panama so they all act
06:33
on mass thousands and thousands of them
06:35
in one ant army and if you leave your
06:37
house at the right time so you know when
06:38
it's army ant season
06:40
um then they come and they eat
06:41
everything so every crumb
06:43
every worm every bit of dirt on your
06:45
floor they eat it
06:46
so there are people in panama who say we
06:47
just go out for the day come back at the
06:49
end of the day they've gone
06:50
everything's clean they should have made
06:51
the canal like that shouldn't they just
06:53
put a line of ants down just to bite it
06:56
that would have been quite cool we've
06:57
got to start using them i think that's
06:58
high risk
06:59
really yeah personally you've got to
07:01
make sure all your food's in very very
07:03
safe places
07:04
yeah you're in trouble if you forget the
07:06
dog yeah you really are
07:08
you've got a skeleton yeah there's a
07:11
lemon on that taste of lemon
07:12
that i didn't know about if you lick it
07:14
it tastes like lemon how can you lick an
07:16
and
07:16
a single apple all right you like a
07:18
bunch of them you put them on a lolly
07:20
and they're really cool so they um rely
07:23
on
07:24
these uh shrubs to survive um as their
07:27
homes and they're really good defenders
07:28
of these jobs so if any other plants try
07:30
to grow around them
07:31
then they kill them so it's a really
07:33
ideal kind of
07:34
guard to have which i quite like that's
07:36
loyal very loyal yeah
07:38
are they any use for us for not unless
07:40
you're a shrub
07:41
i haven't suspected yeah
07:46
i'm still stuck on this door edge
07:48
because i just love the idea that that's
07:50
where he is all the time
07:51
and the only interaction he has is with
07:53
the ants coming in and out hey mike
07:55
how's it going yeah
08:04
are all the ants in the colony door ants
08:06
but only some of them are used as actual
08:07
doors that's right
08:09
okay and yeah only of some of them are
08:11
used by does as
08:12
does sorry um but some of them actually
08:14
use their heads because they're kind of
08:15
flat and around the top here they can
08:17
use them to float down if they want to
08:18
jump
08:19
out of a tree it means that they won't i
08:21
mean ants wouldn't die if they fell
08:22
anyway would they
08:24
but it helps them to glide in whichever
08:26
way they want that's quite cool isn't it
08:27
yeah they're also parachute ants yeah
08:30
that's that's the thing
08:31
that's just bad marketing when you vote
08:32
a door in a parachute don't call
08:34
yourself a door
08:36
call yourself a parish yeah much cooler
08:38
you're right branding they need work on
08:40
branding apparently
08:41
seagulls in the uk have started behaving
08:43
quite badly this year
08:44
and it's because they've been eating red
08:46
ants and the formic acid in red ants
08:49
makes them drunk
08:50
um and so seagulls have been crashing
08:51
into buildings and they've been a bit
08:52
more vicious stealing people's
08:54
sandwiches
08:54
and they've been flying out in front of
08:56
cars and it's because they're all pissed
08:57
sounds british to me
09:02
i was actually on drunk animals which i
09:04
know we mentioned and we love
09:05
there was a story this week about
09:08
bohemian waxwing birds in yukon in
09:10
canada
09:11
and they've been getting really drunk on
09:13
fermented berries this year
09:14
so the national park in canada yukon
09:18
wildlife sanctuary has set up rehab
09:20
centers for them um
09:21
so if you see they advertise every if
09:24
you see one of these drunk birds you've
09:25
got to take it to the rehab center and
09:26
say it's a drunk bird and they put it in
09:28
this little cage and they let it sober
09:29
up until it's responsible enough to be
09:30
able to fly on its own again
09:32
[Laughter]
09:34
that's amazing you said they were eating
09:35
berries yeah okay so there's a species
09:38
of nematode
09:39
worm that when it infects a certain type
09:41
of ant
09:42
it makes that arse go bright red so it
09:44
looks exactly like a berry
09:46
and so the birds come down and eat it
09:48
and then get infected themselves and
09:49
then the nematode goes out of the
09:51
feces and then it does a whole system
09:53
that's amazing
09:54
yeah that is really amazing that's like
09:56
the zombie ants isn't it which i think
09:58
we've covered
09:58
i love zombie ants which so zombians are
10:01
the ones where there's uh
10:02
what do you call it not a mushroom a
10:03
fungus that spreads itself
10:05
over the forest floor doesn't it and
10:07
then it gets into the head of these ants
10:09
and possesses them to climb
10:10
high up the trees um and then they eat
10:14
their brains from the inside out so they
10:15
die high up this tree and then the
10:17
fungus grows
10:18
out of their brains and spreads itself
10:19
all over the forest floor again and the
10:20
process starts all over again
10:22
so you have another zombie ant that it's
10:24
caused by the forehead fly so a forest
10:26
fly a very small fly
10:28
and it hovers over an ant waits for the
10:30
right moment
10:31
and then it dives down and in the dive
10:33
it puts an egg
10:34
in the neck of the ant and the egg will
10:36
hatch
10:37
and the the small larvae will start
10:40
eating the brain
10:41
and this ant will will just start
10:44
walking straight forward
10:46
not returning to the nest just walking
10:47
walking walking and when it's when it
10:49
has been walking long enough
10:51
the larva will release a chemical that
10:54
makes the neck
10:56
solve away so the head falls off
10:59
oh and then you have just a ant head
11:02
lying there and then the larva will will
11:05
live there and eat
11:06
and then form a cocoon and then it flies
11:08
out as a new forage fly and it returns
11:10
to the nest and attacks a new ant
11:12
oh my god wow do they know about this so
11:14
they wear
11:16
i just wonder if you're like a quite
11:18
balanced normal ant you must be like
11:19
going what the hell is going on here
11:21
this guy's just walked forward he's come
11:22
back he's attacked us
11:23
this other guy thinks there's tiny
11:24
little ants stealing our food
11:26
make tastes of lemons
11:28
[Laughter]
11:30
frank's ass looks like a berry
11:33
we're out of control here i just want to
11:35
be a doll
11:41
okay we need to move on to fact number
11:42
two and that is
11:44
cecinski yeah my fact this week is that
11:47
in cambodia a teenage girl's parents
11:50
might build her a love hut where her
11:52
parents encourage her to sleep with as
11:54
many boys as she wants until she
11:56
finds the one that she likes this is in
11:58
the krung
11:59
it's k-r-e-u-n-g krung crayon tribe in
12:02
cambodia which
12:03
is in rural northern cambodia and
12:06
basically when a girl turns about 13
12:08
it's between the ages of 13 and 15.
12:10
her parents say okay we understand that
12:12
you want to be getting to know boys now
12:13
and it's often embarrassing for the boys
12:15
to come and visit your house when your
12:16
parents are there so their parents is
12:17
traditional for the parents to build her
12:19
this love hut which is removed from the
12:21
house away enough away
12:23
and she sleeps there and boys come and
12:25
visit her and different boys come every
12:26
night
12:27
and they so a lot of the girls say
12:29
sometimes they just stay up and talk but
12:30
i guess you would say that when your
12:31
parents ask
12:32
and sometimes and they just do that
12:36
until they find one who is their soul
12:38
mate
12:38
and apparently they say it takes on
12:40
average 10 boys
12:42
for them to find their soulmate so
12:44
that's the average this is this is
12:45
absolutely
12:46
i can see a bad hollywood rom-com
12:50
forming in your mind
12:55
and you just know that hugh grant is
12:56
going to be the 10th boy
12:59
oh there he is move is going to be
13:00
finished now
13:01
[Laughter]
13:03
but also the fact that they that the
13:05
parents build it themselves and you know
13:07
when it's finished you have you get a
13:10
tour you know
13:11
and your father would go like yes you
13:12
know i built this and it's uh very
13:14
stable and
13:15
don't sit on that bit it creaks a bit
13:17
and yeah
13:18
yeah it's the exact opposite of what
13:20
every other dad that i know
13:22
would do like my dad would build that
13:24
love hut for my sister and then stand
13:26
outside and try to kick the ass of every
13:28
person
13:30
yeah with a shotgun in the meantime
13:31
she's inviting boys in the house you
13:33
know
13:34
look at my dad he's still out there no
13:36
problem i reckon he would build it with
13:38
like the biggest
13:39
heaviest door ever wouldn't he
13:43
just anything to stop them oh my god in
13:46
the ant world the door would be one and
13:48
i would never get to sleep
13:50
hey mike have fun in there hope she
13:51
picks you i'll keep it closed
13:54
oh no yeah until the 18th century
13:58
most people slept twice per night and
14:00
they took a two-hour break
14:02
in between to smoke have sex or visit
14:04
neighbors
14:06
or all three it's just a wake-up
14:10
what are the three options again i
14:13
always forget
14:14
which order should we do them tonight
14:16
did
14:17
we haven't seen the neighbors for a
14:18
while
14:21
they used to advise that the best time
14:23
to um
14:25
make love was after your first sleep in
14:28
the era where it was two sleeps a night
14:30
um a scientist in the 17th century said
14:32
the time it's going to be most
14:33
productive and enjoyable
14:34
after sleep number one so it's first
14:36
sleep second sleep it's because you
14:38
you're a bit refreshed
14:39
yeah yeah okay it makes sense it was
14:41
when so when it got dark and no one had
14:43
electricity and no one could afford
14:44
candles and so as soon as it got dark at
14:45
8 in the evening you just passed out
14:47
nothing else to do and then you wake up
14:48
at midnight and go well
14:50
should we shag speaking of the darkness
14:53
do you know that um
14:54
people sleep 20 minutes longer on the
14:56
night when there's a full moon compared
14:58
to when there's not a full moon
14:59
no way yeah way how come it's exhausting
15:01
being a werewolf though
15:04
um just speaking of love huts uh i
15:08
found out uh before nintendo made video
15:11
games
15:12
they had a bunch of other products one
15:14
of which was that nintendo used to run
15:16
love hotels
15:19
i love hotel it's effectively a brothel
15:22
um
15:23
but done the nintendo style it's uh
15:26
there are different levels there's
15:29
there's platforms and you walk in
15:32
everyone's dressed
15:33
did someone order a plumber yeah
15:38
and they also like to get to give you a
15:40
kind of um a sense of
15:42
isolation and no contact with the people
15:44
working in the actual hotel they used to
15:46
send the keys for rooms to you in the
15:48
reception or in your room through
15:50
pneumatic clients like mario like those
15:53
you know the the
15:54
awesome green players it's for couples
15:55
isn't it it's for people who are in no
15:57
no it was also
15:58
for prostitution and so on i missed that
16:01
level in super mario actually
16:04
because the keys get fed up to me so i
16:06
can serve as my prostitute yeah
16:08
i don't remember that i was in tokyo
16:10
last year and there's a there's a
16:12
district which is it has a lot of these
16:14
love hotels in and i walked around it
16:16
because it's a really
16:17
they're all built in weird fabulous
16:19
styles like medieval
16:21
european castles or one of them is looks
16:24
like a robot
16:25
they're bizarre buildings and the re
16:28
i was just i stressed i didn't enter any
16:30
of them and the reason that they
16:33
are popular is because um the average
16:36
japanese flat is about
16:37
two rooms i mean there are no love huts
16:39
put it that way and
16:41
it's very difficult to have time as a
16:44
couple by yourself
16:45
and often three generations of a family
16:46
live in the same flat and it's
16:48
everyone's sort of right next to each
16:50
other so that it's kind of
16:51
evolved out of the property market
16:53
basically that's why it happens
16:55
so the reason i like the love hearts is
16:57
because it's like a real
16:59
it's an example i guess of gender roles
17:01
being turned around a little bit and
17:02
but so um a anthropologist called fiona
17:05
mcgregor went there and interviewed all
17:07
generations and they said the women are
17:08
really independent and they know exactly
17:10
what they want and there's a lot of
17:11
equality and relationships between them
17:12
um so i like examples of that so there's
17:14
the bari tribe of venezuela and other
17:16
south american tribes
17:18
believe that children can have more than
17:19
one father so again promiscuity in women
17:22
is quite common
17:23
and they'll say you know you'll say
17:24
who's who's your child's father and say
17:27
uh well she was uh it started with this
17:30
guy
17:30
and then this guy came in a couple of
17:32
months later and the sperm sloshed
17:33
together
17:34
which is what they think and the child
17:35
is sort of a combination of a bunch of
17:37
men
17:38
um so again you know promiscuity fine
17:40
you just wait till your dads get home
17:42
you are in so much trouble they used to
17:46
think that um
17:46
the child would be able to get things
17:49
from whoever they suckled from
17:51
didn't they so um they would think that
17:53
a child they would
17:54
get a wet nurse who would be able to
17:56
speak greek in the hope that the child
17:58
would suckle from
17:59
that wet nurse and be able to speak
18:00
greek in the future yeah
18:02
how did that go i can't speak greek
18:08
you could walk up to a very beautiful
18:09
greek woman so
18:11
i'd like to learn greek and
18:17
guys we need to move on does anyone have
18:18
anything more they want to throw into
18:19
this one
18:21
in this is in 2000 it was only in 2006
18:24
that the official spanish
18:25
siesta was cut down from three hours to
18:28
one hour
18:29
three hours until 2006 was the lunch
18:31
break yeah but you stay at work until 10
18:34
in the evening so it was also tough
18:35
do you know they have world
18:36
championships in siesta no yeah
18:39
how do you win they have they look for
18:42
very loud places like like shopping
18:45
malls and then they put beds there and
18:47
they just have the athletes come up
18:49
and they just have a countdown and then
18:50
go nap and then
18:52
the guy who has who falls asleep fast
18:55
and has the longest nap
18:56
he's the winner is the world champion in
18:57
siesta wow you can fake that
19:00
yeah i guess so you can measure you can
19:02
measure someone's asleep
19:03
yeah i think they've probably worked out
19:05
it's not just the guy going yeah
19:07
[Music]
19:09
um okay we should move on andy murray
19:12
my fact is that uh
19:16
the longest canyon in the world is 50
19:19
longer than the grand canyon and we
19:21
didn't know about it until
19:23
august last year how do we miss it yeah
19:26
how can that be the case well
19:27
there it is buried under 1.9 miles of
19:29
ice
19:30
so okay to be fair but this is so cool
19:32
it's in greenland
19:33
and um it's the the grand canyon is
19:36
maybe
19:37
uh 280 miles long and this one is 460
19:40
miles long
19:41
and it could be even bigger um but we
19:44
didn't know about it because it's under
19:45
this huge
19:45
ice sheet which is so heavy that it's
19:47
turned greenland into a bowl
19:49
a bowl-shaped country um
19:52
for ages scientists had no idea why uh
19:55
if
19:55
if it's like a bowl with all this ice
19:56
weighing down surely there should be ice
19:58
melting at the bottom and there should
19:59
be lakes
20:00
under the uh ice sheet but there aren't
20:03
and they couldn't find any with radar so
20:05
when they found this canyon which goes
20:07
towards the sea they think oh this must
20:08
be how the water
20:09
has been getting out and not causing the
20:12
uh
20:13
the lakes to form wow yeah that's
20:15
amazing and
20:16
last year and no human has ever seen it
20:17
because when it happened this canyon
20:19
formed
20:20
it was four million years ago we didn't
20:21
exist
20:23
wow can we break the ice and have a look
20:25
get tourists there
20:26
i mean if we do well if the if the ice
20:29
goes then the seas will rise by seven
20:31
meters and we're all
20:32
completely stuck well but that's that's
20:34
a good question
20:35
what would happen if all the ice on
20:38
greenland would melt so
20:39
ice that ice that is floating in in sea
20:41
water when it melts it doesn't
20:43
make the sea level go up but all the ice
20:45
that on that is on land masses such as
20:47
greenland and antarctica
20:50
will make the sea level go up but if you
20:52
would only melt the ice that is
20:54
on greenland then in belgium and in
20:58
england
20:58
nothing would change and in iceland the
21:01
sea level
21:02
would go down by three meters because
21:06
this ice sheet has so much gravity
21:09
that it pulls the water towards
21:11
greenland
21:12
and when you melt it the water level
21:14
around greenland will go down
21:16
and then the rest of the world will go
21:17
up wow so like
21:19
people like the seychelles are screwed
21:21
or
21:22
like tuvalu or maldives yeah they're all
21:25
screwed but
21:26
we're fine yeah there's one problem when
21:28
the ice on greenland melts it probably
21:30
starts
21:30
melting too on antarctica and that's uh
21:33
yeah
21:34
yeah that is a problem one thing i like
21:35
about greenland because it's in
21:36
greenland right yeah
21:38
um is that so eric the red was the guy
21:41
who who
21:41
first founded uh made a european
21:44
settlement on greenland
21:45
and the reason he did that was because
21:47
he'd been expelled from iceland in
21:48
around 985
21:50
a.d for murdering one of his neighbors
21:52
and the reason he lived in iceland in
21:53
the first place is because his father
21:55
had been banished from norway
21:57
manslaughter
21:58
so his family was constantly murdering
22:00
people
22:01
um but his son leif eriksen was actually
22:04
the first european to
22:06
land in north america wasn't he yeah and
22:08
he said about 500 years before columbus
22:10
did landed
22:11
on the north american continent and then
22:13
went back but the reason so i think this
22:15
is really funny the reason
22:16
he could find it was because there was
22:18
another guy in iceland at the time whose
22:20
father had moved to greenland
22:22
and he wanted to find his father so he
22:24
set sail for greenland not knowing where
22:25
he was going
22:26
um and he came across so he had a
22:28
description of of greenland
22:30
knew what he was looking for kept on
22:31
seeing this kind of coastline which was
22:33
lots of forests and stuff and then lots
22:35
of verdant green land and other people
22:37
on his boat kept saying can we get off
22:38
here what is this and he was like no
22:40
we're going to greenland and he kept
22:42
very detailed diaries of what it was and
22:44
it was north america but he wouldn't let
22:46
them get off and he sailed up the whole
22:47
coast of north america
22:48
eventually arrived in greenland and leif
22:50
erikson was like you know that place
22:52
you saw how did you find that uh but
22:55
yeah first guy to get to america
22:57
they're the the tallest trees on
22:58
greenland are two inches high
23:03
two inches that doesn't really
23:06
constitute a
23:07
it's a tree yeah it's a tree tree
23:09
because i think it's more than
23:11
two inches um they say they don't they
23:13
have the similar in iceland they have
23:14
very small trees
23:16
and there's a joke that they say is it
23:18
like um what do you do if you get lost
23:20
in a forest in iceland and the answer
23:22
is stand up that's very good it's true
23:24
they have they have
23:25
birch trees that are about one meter
23:28
yeah one meter high but another another
23:30
fact about greenland
23:31
there are no two towns in greenland that
23:34
are connected by road
23:36
oh you cannot drive to another town you
23:39
have to
23:40
go by boat or fly there's no roads
23:42
between town that is a pain
23:44
yeah it is the other thing is about um
23:46
greenland is if you look on a map
23:48
any kind of globe or whatever you'll
23:49
always have uh newark which is the
23:51
capital will always be on that map so
23:53
we'll probably goth that up so a few
23:54
other places
23:55
um newark is the largest place it's 19
23:58
000 people live there
23:59
which would be a village in the uk but
24:02
it's still on every globe it's a tiny
24:03
tiny
24:04
place but it's still on every globe i
24:05
would find i find that quite interesting
24:07
yeah yeah
24:08
and if you look at like this the 11th
24:10
most populous um
24:11
city in the world uh is somewhere in
24:13
china that's on no globes
24:15
because it's right next to hong kong so
24:16
why would you put it on and that's got
24:18
like probably i don't know 50 million
24:20
people living there
24:21
not not on any globes and then this
24:23
place has got 10 000 19 000 and it's on
24:25
every globe yeah it's quite cool there's
24:27
a place the most northerly point of
24:29
greenland
24:30
is called a coffee club island and it
24:33
was named by a guy
24:34
um in honor of his coffee club back in
24:36
denmark i think he's danish
24:38
uh he was called large [ __ ] what i know
24:40
he wasn't
24:41
was he no he was called laughs
24:45
but i'm going to call him large cars
24:46
yeah i'm sure everyone at school did as
24:48
well
24:50
and he found this a place he called it
24:52
coffee club island it's right in the
24:53
northern tip it's the northernmost point
24:55
of land on
24:56
all of earth it became quite famous and
24:59
then someone else went to
25:00
um look at it a few days later and found
25:02
that there was actually another bit of
25:03
land
25:04
just over there and it had been
25:06
underwater when he'd been there because
25:07
the tide was so high wow
25:09
but the other place doesn't really have
25:10
a name they call it starbucks that will
25:12
get all
25:16
those are the days where you could just
25:17
go and call things after your local
25:20
reading club bay
25:24
the place where when they first went to
25:26
greenland the only bay that was good for
25:28
fishing that um the two
25:30
settlements uh fished in was called
25:32
disco bay which i quite love it
25:34
this sounds like a fun place yeah um
25:37
canyons was it named after anything
25:39
that's why no i don't know well it's in
25:40
the language
25:41
uh so i guess this one disco is latin
25:44
but i can't remember what form it's not
25:46
related to that okay it's uh
25:47
yeah viking talk of the 10th century if
25:50
i don't if you're fluent there
25:52
no disco is shot for disco tech
25:55
and that was named after bibliotech
25:57
which is french for a library
25:58
and it was named because it's a place
26:00
where you have discs like records
26:02
so disco tech has a biblioteca's books
26:05
and discotheques discs
26:06
so actually a discotheque should be a
26:08
place where everybody has to be quiet
26:09
looking at vinyl you know
26:11
yeah yeah
26:14
have you seen the beatles album okay
26:16
speaking of beatles while we're on that
26:18
um and canyons as we were um there's a
26:20
canyon in america
26:21
which i haven't written down the name of
26:23
it but there was a guy in america was
26:25
rocking walking down there he was called
26:26
james richards
26:28
and when he was walking down the canyon
26:29
he tripped and he fell down quite a long
26:31
way down the canyon
26:32
knocked himself unconscious and he says
26:35
that he then woke up in a parallel
26:37
universe
26:38
where the beatles never broke up
26:41
there was a man called jonas there who
26:43
told him all about what happened with
26:45
the beatles
26:46
and when he returned to our world he um
26:48
brought one of their tapes with him
26:50
and he has a website where he has the
26:52
music of the beatles
26:54
because they never broke up in this
26:56
parallel world wow how were they good
26:58
after they didn't break up did they
27:00
sound like a lunatic in the desert
27:02
[Laughter]
27:04
actually one of the um the so the
27:06
beatles started as the quarry men
27:08
um and uh one of the members pete
27:11
shotton
27:12
uh he went on to become john lennon and
27:14
yoko ono's personal assistant
27:17
and years ago there was an official
27:18
biography by a guy called hunter davies
27:20
who wrote about the beatles in their
27:21
time and he went and he revisited all
27:23
these original characters from the
27:24
beatles
27:25
pete shotton now lives on an island uh
27:27
somewhere off
27:28
england and he when he was asked by
27:31
hunter davies how are you doing he said
27:32
i'm really good
27:33
i'm actually back in contact with john
27:35
and they went
27:36
what do you mean and he said i had an
27:37
american medium come and she got me back
27:40
in contact with john
27:41
and we're writing songs again um he by
27:44
the way in the quarrymen was the guy who
27:45
played the washboard not even an
27:47
instrument
27:48
that's literally a kitchen item um
27:51
nobody does a washboard like pete
27:54
if he was from birmingham um can i
27:58
just on the subject of canyons because
27:59
when i think of canyons i think a grand
28:01
canyon and i immediately think of evil
28:03
knievel
28:04
and evil knievel is extraordinary
28:07
because as far as i can tell from
28:08
reading his career we all know evil
28:10
knievel right the guy who tried to jump
28:11
the grand canyon
28:12
he also was just one of the great stunt
28:14
bike people of all time
28:16
most people came it turns out just to
28:18
watch him fail every time
28:20
and every single thing that he did it
28:22
was like which bit do we want him to
28:24
fall on
28:24
so one of his first uh so actually he
28:27
started doing stunts
28:28
so why did people wanting to fail
28:31
because he kept surviving so it was it
28:33
was just fun to watch a man go i'm
28:35
jumping over two mountain lions and a s
28:37
and a cargo of rattlesnakes and when he
28:39
goes he falls into the rattlesnakes and
28:41
they all cheer
28:42
and that genuinely happens because
28:43
they're like this man can't die it's
28:44
fine
28:46
this is the weird fact about evil
28:47
knievel he practiced crashing more than
28:49
he did
28:50
landing well that explains his problem
28:54
he was um he's an interesting character
28:56
i mean he
28:57
he used to carry a cane around and he
29:00
carried inside the cane
29:01
wild turkey uh the alcohol and he would
29:04
drink it from his cane directly
29:07
and no one would see and i thought no
29:09
one would see
29:12
[Laughter]
29:14
i'm not an especially observant person
29:16
but if i saw someone walking with a cane
29:17
and then drink from it i think i would
29:19
sit up did he do that while he was
29:21
riding he was getting drunk while he was
29:22
dead that's why he kept crashing he kept
29:24
trying to get the lid off the cane
29:25
there's um an american um a car guy from
29:29
the
29:29
indy 500 or whatever called dick trickle
29:32
i always remember his name
29:33
i don't know why i remember his name he
29:35
used to he liked to smoke and
29:37
it was in uh must been in the 50s or
29:39
something and he had a helmet
29:41
but he wanted to smoke while he was um
29:43
riding and so he would drill a hole in
29:44
his helmet so he could get the cigarette
29:46
through there and so he could smoke
29:48
while he was driving and i always wanted
29:50
to run on qi
29:51
why did dick trickle have a hole in his
29:53
helmet but they never let me do it
29:56
and we never will
29:59
um in the grand canyon do you know what
30:01
the most common cause of death is
30:03
falling sort of not having enough to
30:06
drink
30:06
no so i would have thought that it's
30:08
plane crashes uh it's weirdly common
30:10
and in fact so the reason the federal
30:13
aviation administration
30:14
in america was set up so like um i guess
30:17
a
30:17
safety overseer of air flights was
30:19
because of the grand canyon
30:21
and there were two commercial flights
30:22
used to like detour to go over the grand
30:24
canyon so people could have a quick look
30:25
so there were two flights i think in
30:26
1956
30:28
they collided um but also i think it's a
30:30
bit of a risk
30:31
with a canyon the air flow goes
30:34
downwards and so they have to clear
30:35
airspace sometimes around the canyon now
30:37
so
30:38
the biggest diamond mine in the world
30:42
um which is somewhere in africa uh
30:45
has airspace cleared around it because
30:46
the downwards flow has pulled a bunch of
30:48
helicopters into it
30:49
i say a bunch too it's enough to say
30:53
actually let's not do this anymore
30:54
that's a planet eating helicopters
30:57
[Laughter]
31:00
um well guys we need to move on by the
31:01
way um yeah yeah
31:03
the scariest crater in the world is in
31:05
turkmenistan
31:06
and you know do you guys know about this
31:08
the darwaza crater which is also called
31:10
the door to hell
31:11
yeah it's so terrifying so it's where
31:13
the soviets were doing experiments there
31:15
in they were drilling for gas in the
31:17
1970s
31:18
and there was a leak and essentially
31:20
what happens was obnoxious gases leaked
31:22
out and there was a
31:23
it set fire and it's been burning ever
31:25
since so for 40 years 45 years now it's
31:27
been constantly on fire
31:29
and it's this huge crater and a guy
31:30
descended into it last year
31:32
george korunis um had to wear a kevlar
31:35
suit and sort of abseil down into it
31:38
and uh he said that he didn't know why
31:40
anyone else hadn't done it before
31:41
because
31:41
once you're there there are no
31:42
restrictions if you can find the right
31:44
place you can drive out up get out of
31:46
your car walk over the edge and jump
31:47
right in if you want
31:48
the choice is yours i'm so far the only
31:50
person who's actually done that
31:52
i would have thought no one had done it
31:53
because it's constantly on fire
31:57
can i really quickly tell you about the
31:59
the first ever expedition through the
32:00
grand canyon
32:01
uh was by the american explorer powell
32:04
um
32:05
and he was an incredible explorer he had
32:07
just one arm he lost his other one in
32:08
the civil war
32:09
never mentioned it but they took four
32:11
boats and um
32:13
ten men went on this expedition four of
32:15
them died on the expedition
32:16
um they they had to throw food overboard
32:20
they lost
32:20
boats they they it was a terrible thing
32:22
on the first day they threw away 200
32:24
kilos of bacon
32:25
because they thought it was slowing them
32:26
down and by the end they were eating
32:27
moldy flour
32:29
because they had no food left but the
32:32
boats were called these were the four
32:33
names of the boats
32:34
maid of the canyon emma dean
32:37
kitty clyde's sister and
32:41
no name
32:42
[Laughter]
32:44
just evidently that meeting they just
32:47
ran out of ideas after the first three
32:48
two a.m
32:49
come on let's go come on we've been here
32:51
for four hours we must be able to think
32:52
of one more let's just go with no name
32:55
okay let's let's
32:56
move on okay okay time for our final
32:59
fact of the show and that is
33:01
james okay my fact this week is
33:04
that in 2008 the university of bath
33:07
invented a 3d printer that could print a
33:10
copy of itself
33:11
within three minutes that copy had
33:13
copied itself to make a third copy
33:16
and today nobody knows how many of these
33:18
printers exist
33:19
in the world that's so amazing they're
33:22
gonna take it over aren't they
33:24
oh yeah they're gonna princess to death
33:27
what a way to go this is one of the one
33:29
of the end of the world scenarios it's
33:31
called the grey goo
33:33
and it's not about it's not about 3d
33:35
printers but it's about
33:36
nano robots so um i think it was already
33:40
mentioned by
33:41
feynman in the in the 60s they were
33:43
thinking about nano robots that could
33:45
reproduce themselves because of course
33:47
nanobots are so small you need like
33:49
millions of them as well but let's just
33:51
build one that builds the others
33:53
and then they had this idea like okay
33:54
what if they break out of the laboratory
33:56
and they just start
33:58
collecting stuff and so one of the end
34:00
of the world scenarios is that there
34:02
would be
34:02
some research center turning into a grey
34:05
goo of nano robots and it was just
34:07
spread all over the world until we were
34:09
a big bowl of nuts they feed off carbon
34:11
so they start eating
34:12
all of us as well um i read a um a quote
34:15
by someone saying that mankind's last
34:17
great invention
34:18
will be the first self-replicating
34:20
intelligent machine
34:22
basically that's the end of us but the
34:24
idea with the grey goo is actually they
34:25
would have to get their energy from
34:27
somewhere so unless they could somehow
34:28
be solar panel probably will
34:30
will probably be okay but we have
34:31
invented the solar panel james i don't
34:33
want to worry
34:35
we've given them their tools yeah they
34:37
can get their energy chemically you know
34:39
like
34:40
we digest food once they've figured out
34:41
well once we figured out how to build
34:43
them that way then we're doomed
34:44
let's just not figure it out there is um
34:48
there are some researchers i'm not sure
34:49
where they are um who have come up with
34:51
this
34:52
um machine uh and they programmed it to
34:55
get across a certain
34:56
uh bit of land which has got bumps or
34:58
whatever uh they
34:59
3d printed it uh they made it walk and
35:02
then when it got somewhere or broke or
35:03
whatever
35:04
then they fed that back into the
35:06
computer and let it re
35:07
kind of work itself out to try and make
35:09
it a little bit better and a little bit
35:11
better and a little bit better
35:12
and that's kind of like a way of making
35:15
evolution
35:16
through computers and that's happening
35:17
right now right yeah absolutely
35:19
um just so very quickly on the printer
35:21
so they've built a printer that can
35:22
replicate itself
35:23
it sounds like it's really quick and
35:25
they sold that
35:27
and then someone else has replicated one
35:29
yeah so the idea is that they've they've
35:31
sold a thousand of these
35:32
printers that can print other 3d
35:34
printers and they assume that
35:36
if you've bought one you're probably
35:37
making some yourself and then you've
35:39
probably given them to someone else etc
35:40
etc so they don't know how many of the
35:42
extra ones have been made
35:43
this was in 2008 i was i was visiting uh
35:46
we have a very big 3d printing company
35:48
here in here in belgium called
35:50
materialize and they do amazing stuff
35:52
and i was visiting them and one of the
35:53
great things they do is when
35:55
when a surgeon has to operate on a
35:57
broken bone
35:58
he does the operation completely in
36:00
virtual reality so they
36:02
take a scan of the bone and then he puts
36:04
it in a computer and then he's he's just
36:06
looking in the computer how to fit them
36:08
back together
36:09
what the best points are to drill in the
36:11
bones and put the titanium plate on it
36:13
and then they 3d print a template that
36:16
he can use when he does the operation so
36:18
he can do the operation super quick
36:20
just opening it up clicking the plastic
36:22
parts on the bone
36:23
pushing them together and the hole where
36:25
he has to drill are already there
36:27
so he just goes click click puts it
36:28
together drill drill drill the screws
36:30
inside and he's finished and everything
36:32
was prepared in the computer it's like
36:33
an
36:33
an ikea ikea broken bonus
36:37
it's like ikea that's five hours later
36:40
i'm screwing missing i think we're
36:42
missing one part
36:44
someone had a skull printed didn't they
36:46
recently um
36:48
3d printed a skull but this is a weird
36:50
thing that's been done with 3d printers
36:52
in japan
36:53
they're having their fetuses 3d printed
36:56
so if you want to meet your baby before
36:58
it comes out of you
36:59
you ask for a 3d printout it's only
37:01
about 800 for your fetus and it's 3d
37:04
printed in a little see-through
37:05
books wow when will we be able to 3d
37:09
print a person
37:10
an actual living person i will have
37:12
keanu reeves oh sorry no
37:14
but they genuinely have 3d printed a
37:16
keanu reeves no but i want a proper one
37:19
like a real human yeah i want a working
37:21
kid
37:23
there were two life-sized mannequins of
37:25
two guys who were looking for
37:27
a girlfriends and match.com an online
37:30
dating site did 3d printouts of those
37:33
guys that looked exactly like them
37:35
didn't look anything like them
37:36
and they put them in a shop window and
37:38
the idea was that women would walk past
37:40
and go
37:40
i like the look of him and then and then
37:43
do they remain single
37:44
or i i don't know but yeah i guess so um
37:47
anna you were talking about
37:49
japan and the fetus thing there was a
37:52
japanese lady called magumi
37:53
igarashi she was arrested quite recently
37:56
for distributing data that allowed
37:58
recipients
37:59
to make 3d prints of her genitals
38:02
and what she wanted to do was to model a
38:05
uh
38:06
kayak in the shape of her genitals
38:10
she yeah she's an artist she's an artist
38:13
okay that's no excuse
38:16
no her art is all about um her body and
38:19
making it more
38:20
kayak like
38:24
which is weird actually i just
38:25
remembered the word kayak means men's
38:27
boat oh yeah
38:28
yeah and in there is another word for
38:30
women's boats so
38:31
in the olympics the um the kayaks should
38:34
only be a men's event and they should
38:35
have a different name for the women's
38:37
event
38:38
all the eskimos are watching the
38:40
olympics
38:43
women in the kayak yeah these men are
38:46
very effeminate
38:49
james's letter writing campaign saying
38:51
women should not be allowed to take part
38:53
in the kayak event
38:56
so what's the resolution of the story oh
38:58
um she was let go
39:00
um yeah they they arrested her and then
39:02
they said actually we can't really
39:04
arrest you for this it was bad publicity
39:05
for the government so they let her go
39:07
right why kayak
39:10
because it's kind of the right shape
39:12
yeah well here in belgium
39:14
i think you need to see a doctor
39:18
let's move on oh by the way my favorite
39:22
headline of the week
39:23
uh i read it in the 14 times just you
39:25
just mentioned arrest
39:26
made me think of it the headline was
39:28
police say quadruple
39:30
amputee is armed and on the run
39:36
um so initially it was about
39:40
3d printed guitars yeah so
39:43
no actually this fact is about 3d
39:45
printers making themselves but
39:46
originally my fact was going to be that
39:48
the band klaxons
39:49
are doing guitar at the moment and all
39:51
their guitars are made
39:53
from 3d printers which i think is pretty
39:54
cool that's really cool
39:56
why did they do that just because it's
39:57
cool well they are cool
40:00
hey hey hey are they having a printed
40:02
jam
40:03
that's a very cool
40:07
no they said earlier this year that they
40:09
were going to do it but they didn't
40:10
think it was possible
40:11
and then some guys from the university
40:12
of sheffield i think it was came in and
40:14
said actually we can do that and
40:16
they've made these 3d uh printed guitars
40:18
and apparently they're really good
40:20
um there's a film in america which will
40:22
make a
40:23
uh which will 3d print based on lots of
40:25
photos of you and measurements a model
40:27
of your head
40:28
which is for your loved ones to keep
40:30
your ashes in after you die
40:33
it's really really creepy it's so
40:36
strange
40:36
it's just it's and it says hang on
40:38
there's a line from the company on the
40:40
website
40:41
you will never again have to worry that
40:42
you might forget what your loved one
40:44
looked like
40:46
when you invest in one of these
40:48
custom-made very life-like cremation
40:50
urns
40:52
because we're all looking at photos of
40:53
our loved ones going but what do they
40:55
look like
40:56
[Laughter]
40:58
um do you know nasa has started
41:00
investing in 3d printers
41:01
i'm not surprised yeah and but what's
41:03
really interesting is it's not just for
41:05
items because i think they already do
41:06
that where they
41:07
they print out stuff that they can use
41:09
on the international space station and
41:10
so on
41:11
um they've started doing it for food so
41:14
they've started printing
41:15
pizzas um but what's amazing is it
41:19
actually it looks like it's going to
41:20
work and they're going to start feeding
41:22
astronauts with this pizza and it says
41:23
that you can um uh it takes seven
41:25
minutes to print a pizza
41:27
wow it takes less than that to make a
41:30
pizza though
41:31
you're in space and then and then it
41:34
goes like
41:35
we're sorry but the tomato cartridge ran
41:38
out
41:39
and you got god you put in a new
41:41
cartridge i have to print a template now
41:43
and then i got a
41:44
whole new sort of green bluish pizza
41:47
coming out let's just throw it away a
41:49
new one yeah but there's someone's
41:51
working on a digital cookbook
41:53
now so three ingredients yeah yeah it's
41:55
going to be a thing
41:56
it's that's our future well i have i
41:58
have a bit of news for you when you buy
42:00
pancakes in the supermarket they are
42:02
printed
42:03
what yeah all the pancakes in the
42:05
supermarket are printed what do you do
42:06
about that
42:07
of course it's just it's just
42:10
in a factory there's this big line
42:12
running around entering the ovens and
42:14
the the ink is coming out of extruders
42:18
and they just
42:18
print it on the it would be easier for
42:21
the companies now to make square
42:23
pancakes but nobody would buy them the
42:24
only reason they are around
42:26
is because we're used to around square
42:29
stuff yeah yeah but they're printed they
42:30
can even make them with your name you
42:32
know big big long pancake with you
42:34
that writes your name wow pancakes are
42:36
printed yeah
42:38
so i think they need to stop using the
42:39
word printed that's the problem isn't it
42:40
because we don't trust printers
42:42
we need to come up with a better word
42:44
because they're printing organs now or
42:46
they think they're
42:46
uh they're very close to printing organs
42:48
so they've print they're having trouble
42:50
with capillaries i think at the moment
42:52
um but we can print tissue and yeah
42:55
functioning functioning blood vessels
42:56
but we know that printers screw up all
42:58
the time
43:00
so we're not trusting what if you get
43:02
the wrong printer as well and you print
43:03
out your thesis on the pancake maker
43:06
yeah and then the dog literally eats
43:08
your homework
43:11
that's gonna be a new thing um we we
43:13
need to wrap up guys
43:15
yeah if you want to throw in um i we
43:17
were talking about uh
43:18
having medical operations and guitars
43:21
this was there
43:22
this is where i went does anyone watch
43:23
true detective has anyone seen true
43:25
detective
43:26
one of the guys in that or he's also in
43:28
csi recently played the guitar during
43:30
brain surgery
43:31
and so he's one of those and he did this
43:34
reddit
43:35
ama so we just quickly described that so
43:38
when you're having brain surgery done
43:39
they need to know that everything's
43:41
working properly and so the way that
43:42
some people do it if you play guitar is
43:44
they'll be cutting your brain open the
43:46
back and you'll be playing guitar the
43:48
whole time
43:48
and if they make any mistakes then
43:50
you'll do something wrong with the
43:51
guitar playing so they'll know that
43:53
there's a mistake yeah
43:54
yeah and he was asked so he did an ama
43:56
on reddit like an ask me
43:58
anything thing on reddit and first of
44:00
all i found it really weird because
44:01
maybe the first 50 questions were what
44:04
was it like to work with matthew
44:05
mcconaughey
44:06
how did you find true detective did you
44:09
find you
44:10
could identify with a character and i
44:11
had to do a command f for surgery
44:13
finally
44:14
um but yeah he described it as the worst
44:16
thing ever
44:17
apparently so if you ever thought brain
44:19
surgery was going to be fun
44:20
and he was asked to describe it further
44:22
and he said sorry it's like nothing else
44:25
i know to compare it to it's kind of
44:26
like i'm in this club of brain surgery
44:28
people
44:29
and we're the only ones that understand
44:30
it i think that's quite a cool club
44:32
wow there's a i think it's it was a
44:36
dutch
44:36
brain surgeon who who told that he had a
44:38
similar operation like
44:39
somebody's staying conscious just to see
44:41
if they didn't do anything wrong
44:43
and they were working in the brain and
44:44
suddenly he said hey touch that bit
44:46
again
44:47
and they said what yeah he said the song
44:49
november reign of guns and roses is
44:51
right there
44:52
what yeah and so they said touch it
44:55
again and they touch it
44:56
yes i'm hearing it now no yeah and this
44:59
guy
45:00
told this story and then afterwards his
45:02
colleague said like why didn't you cut
45:03
it out it's a horrible song
45:05
[Laughter]
45:10
okay that's it that's all of our facts
45:12

[Applause]
46:15
you

=39
00:00
we run it on qi a few years ago yeah um
00:02
which was
00:03
there's no such thing as a fish and
00:04
there's no such thing as a fish no
00:05
seriously it's in
00:06
the oxford dictionary of underwater life
00:10
it says it right there first paragraph
00:11
no such thing as a fish
00:17
[Music]
00:19
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:22
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:24
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:26
covent garden
00:27
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
00:29
here with anna chazinski
00:30
andy murray and james harkin and once
00:32
again we've gathered around the
00:33
microphone with our four favorite facts
00:35
from the last seven days
00:37
and in no particular order here we go
00:41
james okay my fact this week is that the
00:44
san francisco fire department's
00:46
ladders are made of wood which is not
00:49
perhaps the material you
00:50
think would be good for putting near
00:52
fire no why are they
00:54
it's because in san francisco you have
00:56
the the wires that go over for the trams
00:57
they're
00:58
electrified and so if they use metal
01:00
ladders they might get electrocuted
01:02
yeah they have had stories of people who
01:04
when they were trying to they were
01:05
trying to
01:06
fight fires they'd put the metal ladder
01:07
and they'd hit a wire of some sort and
01:09
just
01:10
blow up the firefighters who are
01:12
climbing not not completely
01:14
but like yeah and so they use this um
01:17
this wood which is very high quality and
01:19
they think that it's still
01:20
fire resistant enough that it won't
01:21
settle fire high quality like
01:23
i've got a high quality mahogany table
01:25
at home bit like that it is quite hard
01:27
to set fire to wood under the right
01:28
circumstances it doesn't just burst into
01:30
flame like
01:30
paper you know yeah um so this fact came
01:33
from an email which i get
01:35
sent to my inbox every day uh it's
01:37
called now i know
01:38
it's by a guy called dan lewis and it's
01:41
every day full of interesting stuff
01:43
it's really good we're all fans we're
01:45
all fans yeah exactly
01:46
no it's just full of q a style material
01:48
and it's and it's really good that's
01:50
so that's very cool about fire fire
01:52
ladders being made of wood are there any
01:53
fire engines made of wood
01:55
no i don't know men made of wood
01:57
[Laughter]
02:00
poles are made of wood still are they
02:02
quite often they normally don't have
02:04
poles anymore do they a lot of stations
02:05
these days when they're built are on
02:07
ground level
02:08
and there was a room they were being
02:09
eradicated in britain because of health
02:10
and safety concerns which has been
02:11
denied although they are being
02:13
eradicated in the us
02:14
so new fire stations don't have
02:17
firemen's poles built in them usually
02:18
anymore
02:19
it is a weird thing to find as well
02:20
because i can get downstairs quite fast
02:22
i think it's isn't it also because um so
02:24
fire station is always used to have
02:26
spiral staircases which i think are
02:28
slower to get down because
02:29
and you could injure yourself as well
02:31
yeah and the reason they had spiral
02:32
staircases was because in the 19th
02:34
century when
02:34
fire trucks were obviously drawn by
02:36
horses they kept the horses downstairs
02:38
which is why fire at stations are built
02:40
on two floors often
02:41
and there was a problem with horses
02:42
running up the stairs and then not being
02:43
able to get downstairs
02:46
i think as well it's because you're
02:47
about to do something extremely
02:49
dangerous
02:49
lives do get lost and you can say oh
02:52
yeah he had some fun just before he went
02:55
do you know about the first fire engine
02:57
uh that we ever had like that wasn't
02:59
uh horse drawn there was a guy called
03:01
john lofting and he created what was
03:04
called the sucking worm fire engine
03:07
and right yeah and that was his first uh
03:10
that was
03:11
he sort of patented that it worked on
03:13
the name a bit more
03:14
why is it called that does it have nice
03:16
water up i guess because it sucks
03:18
it sucks something and it looks like a
03:20
worm
03:22
i'm guessing that's why it is he
03:25
invented a number of things he also
03:26
invented
03:28
a horsepowered thimble canerling machine
03:31
i don't know what knurling is
03:33
nailing you know on the end of a thimble
03:34
they have the kind of bumpy bits that
03:36
you grip things it's making that make
03:39
bumps that's horse powered
03:40
yeah he did that before his powers so
03:43
fire horses
03:44
um quite useful easily scared hence the
03:47
reason that dalmatians are known as
03:49
fire dogs so you know dalmatians always
03:50
accompanied fire engines in the 19th
03:52
century
03:52
i did not know that and what were they
03:54
used for loads of things
03:56
so first of all they would keep the
03:58
horses calm around the fire so horses
04:00
will freak out around the fire and
04:01
apparently they were there as a
04:02
comforting influence
04:04
but also i like the idea that the first
04:06
fire
04:07
siren fire engine siren was dalmatians
04:10
barking because one of their purposes
04:11
was to
04:12
a if once the alarm sounded in a fire
04:14
station then dalmatians would know that
04:15
they had to run outside the fire station
04:17
barking and the people would know to
04:18
clear the way
04:18
because the fire men would have to get
04:20
out and then they would run in front
04:22
because they can run really really fast
04:23
for really long
04:24
distances they would run in front of or
04:26
around the fire engine horse-drawn fire
04:28
engine barking and raising the alarm to
04:29
everyone around saying get out of the
04:30
way that's fantastic amazing they're the
04:32
the original firefighter that's
04:34
wonderful firemen these days they don't
04:36
want to rescue animals from trees
04:37
anymore do they not well
04:38
it's another one
04:42
saying that uh it's much more effective
04:43
to call the rspca because it costs about
04:45
300 quid every time somebody calls out
04:47
yeah
04:47
i heard a thing i heard a thing from the
04:50
rspca that says if you see a cat up a
04:52
tree we advise you to leave it for 24
04:54
hours before calling the rspca
04:56
as they usually manage to get down by
04:58
themselves that's interesting after all
05:00
when was the last time you saw a cat
05:01
skeleton up a tree
05:04
wow it's quite a good place this is a
05:05
good one really grim the rspca
05:09
also the rspca have issued a press
05:10
statement saying can people please stop
05:12
bringing
05:12
them when there's a fire and yeah
05:16
it's much more effective to call the
05:17
fire brigade yeah some um some
05:19
animals that the um london fire
05:21
department have rescued recently um a
05:24
kitten with its head stuck in a bongo
05:28
two dogs in a toilet in bromley in 2009
05:32
that's a big toilet isn't it it could be
05:34
tiny dogs couldn't it it could be
05:35
yeah sorry a chimp in a chimney in tower
05:38
hamlets
05:38
oh chimney that's so cool and an adult
05:42
hamster trapped in a disabled lift in
05:44
greenwich
05:46
so i feel sorry for fire so they always
05:48
release these press statements emergency
05:50
departments saying these are the
05:50
ridiculous calls we've got and the
05:52
reason we're saying this is because we
05:53
want you to stop
05:54
making them and the only effect it has
05:56
is that on podcasts like this i guess we
05:57
repeat what they've told us and laugh at
05:58
it
05:59
but so uh recent calls to the fire
06:02
service
06:02
include there are loads of people who
06:04
get stuck in handcuffs um
06:06
i think someone said about 70 people a
06:07
year uh call his fire department um
06:11
nine instances of men with rings stuck
06:13
in awkward places
06:14
do you know what that means it means
06:16
penis is it not so it's not the ring
06:17
going
06:18
into something um well i have a
06:21
statistic of nine instances of men with
06:23
rings stuck on the penises so i think it
06:24
might be the same that's the
06:25
worst proposal ever isn't it she'll say
06:29
no and you'll be asked to leave the
06:30
restaurant
06:31
other reasons people have called fire
06:33
engine someone with a lucy stuck on his
06:35
head
06:35
which i really like that guy he was only
06:37
going in to get the dogs to be fair
06:41
did you guys know that george washington
06:43
was a volunteer firefighter
06:45
oh yeah not yeah um yeah
06:48
other famous firefighters there was a
06:51
guy
06:51
who effectively was kind of like the
06:53
evil knievel of the firefighting world
06:55
called the
06:56
red adair have you heard of the red
06:58
adair
07:00
yeah so he was he was he was uh he would
07:02
fly in planes and you would put out
07:04
fires from the skies and i just read
07:06
about one of the fires that he put out
07:07
that i'd not heard of which i find
07:09
amazing
07:09
it was in the sahara and it was
07:11
nicknamed the devil's cigarette lighter
07:14
it was a plume of flame that went as
07:16
high as 450 feet
07:18
imagine that image of just a 450 foot
07:21
pillar of flame what was it from was it
07:24
just a very deep hole in the ground i
07:26
think so
07:27
the magma layer yeah yeah they'll have a
07:30
seam of
07:31
coal and it would have set on fire one
07:32
time it's just all the fuel is coming
07:34
back again i don't know for sure
07:35
imagine that it will be that and i'm
07:37
always amazed that they leave it it's
07:38
like this office set on fire me just
07:40
strolling out into the street oh never
07:42
mind
07:43
that's what we're supposed to do if
07:44
there's a fire goes well designated by
07:46
us
07:49
yeah so he had the biggest business and
07:50
then but all of his best kind of
07:52
associates who he
07:53
had working for him set up their own
07:54
businesses which is a shame my favorite
07:56
one was two of his top right hand
07:58
men asgard boots hanson and ed coote
08:01
matthews
08:01
left and i think they only left so they
08:03
could start a business called boots
08:06
which is what their business was called
08:09
that's great
08:09
rome burned down didn't it in um
08:13
64 a.d is that the fiddling while ron
08:15
burnt moment
08:16
what was the fiddling nero the emperor
08:18
supposedly yeah he was caring so little
08:20
about the fire that he was playing the
08:21
fiddle
08:22
well there are two contrasting reports
08:24
one of which says he saved everyone from
08:25
the fire one of which suggests that he
08:26
started it because he wanted to rebuild
08:28
rome
08:28
two thirds of it burned down in a day he
08:31
probably claimed that
08:32
but i do like the fact that he um blamed
08:34
when he realized that people were
08:35
blaming the great fire of rome on him
08:37
he diverted the blame to christians and
08:39
he had a bunch of christians burned
08:41
and have that uh yeah
08:44
and he would hold garden parties where
08:46
he used the burning christians corpses
08:48
as torches
08:49
to light the garden party wow
08:53
yeah going isn't that mike
08:55
[Laughter]
08:57
are you invited to the party yeah a bit
08:59
nervous about that actually
09:01
but i like that it's the invitation did
09:03
you say guest or outdoor heater
09:08
let's just finish on some uh ways that
09:11
things have caught fire in london
09:12
in the last few years this is another um
09:14
london fire department press release
09:17
um there was a fire started after
09:18
someone tried to dry out a toilet roll
09:20
they had dropped down the loo by popping
09:22
it in the microwave for a few minutes
09:26
uh another one is a man using a pair of
09:29
boxer shorts to vigorously apply linseed
09:31
oil to a floor
09:32
caused the pants to overheat and a fire
09:35
to start
09:37
that must have been so vigorous why was
09:39
he cleaning him with his pants
09:40
he wasn't cleaning i think he was adding
09:42
the oil to kind of make it
09:44
more durable is that what you do with
09:45
linseed oil that's right he was putting
09:47
linseed oil on the floor
09:48
and then rubbing it with his pants yes
09:50
right that's what i question
09:52
oh the use of pants rather than another
09:54
rag yeah
09:55
yeah imagine if you employed a cleaner
09:57
they turned up
09:58
you don't even brought a cloth got these
10:02
guys
10:08
[Applause]
10:13
okay time for fact number two and that
10:15
is my fact
10:16
and my fact this week is astronauts
10:19
do not snore so they don't snore at all
10:22
you can't be an astronaut if you don't
10:23
if you snore or they don't snow once
10:25
they're in space
10:25
a mixture of the both let's start it on
10:27
earth mostly when they're
10:29
trying to find astronauts they go
10:31
through all sorts of rigorous
10:33
challenges and they test them for
10:35
certain things that they know
10:36
that won't work in space one of the
10:37
things that they know won't work in
10:38
space
10:39
is that you'll become very irritated
10:41
very quickly if one of the people
10:43
in the international space station has a
10:44
very loud snore that's one of the things
10:46
that they find
10:47
so they immediately disqualify people
10:49
who have loud snores
10:51
from being an astronaut and they did a
10:53
test where they showed
10:54
five astronauts who snore roughly at 16
10:58
of the time of their sleeping time in
11:00
space once they got there that 16 was
11:02
reduced to less than one percent
11:04
so space actually reduces your snoring
11:06
level and they think it's because of the
11:08
gravity they think it's because
11:10
your tongue is not touching and blocking
11:12
in the same way
11:13
in your head 75 of astronauts take
11:15
sleeping pills
11:16
which i find interesting if they're on
11:18
the international space station um
11:20
because most sleeping pills to have
11:21
warnings like may cause drowsiness
11:23
decrease mental alertness problems with
11:24
coordination
11:25
don't drive or operate machinery don't
11:27
engage in hazardous occupations
11:29
requiring complete mental alertness or
11:31
motor coordination
11:33
that's possibly the heaviest machinery
11:35
[Laughter]
11:38
specific warning on there do not operate
11:40
the international space station if
11:42
you're taking this build
11:43
okay so you're not allowed to go into
11:46
space if you snare too much
11:47
yes but when you go into space people
11:50
don't snore as much anyway
11:51
yeah it doesn't seem really fair that
11:52
you're stopping the soros from going in
11:54
this you
11:55
much
12:03
if you send a really heavy snorer into
12:05
space and then they have huge rounds
12:07
with their colleagues because their
12:09
colleagues can't sleep at all that is a
12:10
risk to a mission shortly yeah it is
12:12
it's it's very odd the um the amount of
12:15
tests that
12:16
um or the amount of things that can get
12:17
you disqualified from being an astronaut
12:19
these days
12:20
it's all to do with stuff that will
12:21
irritate people
12:23
who you're hanging out with so i got
12:24
this fact by the way from um a book
12:26
called packing for mars by mary roach
12:28
and it's the most fantastic book if
12:31
anyone listening to this
12:32
uh likes astronauts space mars read it
12:36
it's
12:36
it's perfect as a book and and she has
12:38
all these examples that
12:39
the tiny things are the things that are
12:41
going to irritate you most in space
12:43
so and anywhere people who are arctic
12:45
explorers and stuff they she has all
12:46
these passages taken out from like
12:48
french anthropologists saying you know
12:50
it got to the point where the way he
12:51
would sip
12:52
his soup or the look or the way he'd
12:54
blow out a candle pissed me off so much
12:57
yeah yeah yeah why are you taking
12:58
candles for the international space no
13:00
no this is
13:00
uh this would be like an arctic explorer
13:02
again again
13:04
so it's his
13:10
[Laughter]
13:16
britain's loudest nora is a woman as far
13:18
as i could tell
13:19
and she so she's 60 years old she snores
13:22
at 111.6 decibels which is eight
13:25
decibels louder than the raw of a
13:26
low-flying jet
13:29
yeah um presumably she was snoring so
13:32
loud that either
13:33
her husband or her kids or something
13:35
said listen this is ridiculously loud
13:37
but i feel like
13:39
we could do something with this we
13:40
should at least get a bit of press out
13:41
of this yeah let's call
13:42
let's call the fire department let's
13:44
call someone to come
13:45
and register your snore as the loudest
13:48
the only way they realized it was so
13:50
loud it was quite sad really she went on
13:51
that program that was on a couple of
13:52
years ago um this like snore school
13:54
thing where um it was a reality tv show
13:56
where people with sleep problems all
13:57
hung out together in the same house
13:59
and so her husband said please can you
14:00
do this because yeah this is terrible
14:02
for me
14:03
and she went on it and everyone else who
14:05
also had serious snoring problems
14:06
heard her and went wow this woman is out
14:09
of this world
14:10
and that's when they tested it um okay
14:12
well that's good
14:13
she said that's when she realized that
14:14
it wasn't normal okay
14:16
okay so you know when you see pictures
14:18
of the astronauts on the moon and
14:20
they're kind of hopping around
14:21
yeah do you know why they're hopping
14:23
around no
14:25
so you might think it's because there's
14:27
less gravity so that's just a good way
14:29
of getting about yeah but it's actually
14:30
because their spacesuits weren't built
14:31
for walking they were really solid so
14:33
the only way to move around really was
14:35
to kind of
14:36
saute like a kangaroo like a kangaroo
14:39
it's amazing
14:40
kangaroos in space um just speaking of
14:43
them being on the moon
14:44
buzz aldrin did an ama not too long ago
14:47
on reddit ask me anything on reddit
14:49
and um he revealed that when he jumped
14:52
onto the moon
14:53
uh so when they landed they didn't land
14:55
hard enough that they'd
14:56
gone they expected the the lunar module
14:59
to go right into the moon but it kind of
15:00
just
15:01
landed so softly that it didn't actually
15:03
really dig into the ground
15:05
so the ladder from which they were meant
15:06
to land on the moon on the outside was a
15:09
lot higher
15:10
than it should then it was meant to be
15:11
so they had to do a big drop
15:13
to the moon so neil you see him drop
15:14
down the same with buzz
15:16
now when when they're uh when they're
15:18
wearing their astronaut suits
15:20
they all have this kind of diaper system
15:22
for both urine
15:24
and for for crapping and uh what
15:26
happened was for feces
15:28
when buzz aldrin jumped down onto the
15:30
moon he landed so hard that he knocked
15:32
the bit of the diaper system off that
15:34
was meant to collect his urine
15:35
completely away and if we all remember
15:38
uh one of the first things he did on the
15:39
moon was have a pee
15:40
and the p went straight down into his
15:42
boot so his whole two hours on the moon
15:45
was him yeah it was him just with a full
15:48
bladder's worth of pee
15:49
hanging out in his left foot he had a
15:51
terrible time yeah
15:52
those children on the moon was hating
15:54
while he was hopping around there was
15:55
slosh and urine
15:56
as well that's gonna spoil it isn't it a
15:59
bit you would
15:59
yeah yeah yeah you would have that on
16:01
your mind well maybe it's the one
16:03
situation
16:04
where it's big enough you don't mind
16:05
about sloshing around in your own way
16:07
i don't know though because yuri gagarin
16:09
when he went back to russia after coming
16:10
back down
16:11
he says one of the biggest moments was
16:12
when he was presented to
16:14
the nation effectively and he was being
16:16
presented with some kind of reward and
16:18
he looked down and he noticed that his
16:19
shoelace was untied
16:21
and that's all he can remember from the
16:22
event the nervousness of just knowing
16:24
that his shoelace was untied so actually
16:25
big moments don't necessarily
16:27
didn't have pee in his shoes well that
16:29
was the other thing he'd then
16:31
you're in gagarin oh my god
16:34
you know there's no seats in space what
16:37
yeah they they used to have seats on
16:38
mirror
16:39
and they realized you obviously just
16:40
don't need seats in space
16:42
like who's using a seat is that why when
16:44
you come back down from space to
16:45
re-acclimatize one of the first things i
16:47
was reading about the crew i think it
16:48
was chris hadfield crew that arrived
16:49
back on earth a couple of years ago
16:51
and one of the first things they give
16:52
you like this crew come and carry you
16:54
out of the
16:55
air ship that you've landed on and they
16:56
put you in a specially designed
16:57
reclining chair
16:58
which apparently helps you they're one
17:00
of them yeah you sit for like half an
17:01
hour to an hour just in these chairs
17:03
once you get out
17:05
they do have chairs in the in the module
17:07
that comes back into
17:09
earth's atmosphere okay so you do sit in
17:10
a chair there but apparently
17:12
nowhere else is there a chair you don't
17:13
need it i would be really gutted to get
17:15
up there and find out there were no
17:16
chairs
17:17
how would you even sit i i would try and
17:19
strap myself into the chair
17:20
you'd have to because of the zero
17:21
gravity i appreciate that that's an
17:23
obstacle but what about the other day
17:24
would you want to sit down you'd look
17:26
like a dick like you would be
17:28
the one astronaut in space who's like oh
17:30
what's murray doing
17:31
that would be an irritant why's he
17:33
sitting on a chair we're in
17:34
space
17:36
floating around on a rocking chair yeah
17:38
yeah
17:40
well thanks to astronaut murray we have
17:42
had to spend 18 million dollars sending
17:44
a lazy boy into your face
17:50
[Music]
17:52
okay time for fact number three and that
17:55
is josinski
17:56
my fact is that in march 1876 it
18:00
rained mutton-tasting meat in kentucky
18:04
well actually you say uh but the reason
18:06
that um they knew it was mutton tasting
18:07
was obvious because they tasted it
18:09
when it happened and it was pronounced
18:11
by various people who tasted it as
18:13
very palatable um and a fresh meat a
18:16
butcher tasted it and said that it
18:17
tasted like sort of high quality meat
18:19
colonel sanders tasted it and said this
18:21
is the best thing i've ever tasted
18:22
[Laughter]
18:24
uh yeah so what i find interesting about
18:26
this obviously there's lots of you know
18:27
weird stuff fell from the sky stories
18:29
but
18:30
we still have specimens of this meat and
18:31
we're still trying to work out what it
18:33
was
18:34
do we know what it was uh we don't know
18:35
what it was it went through various
18:37
scientists at the time trying to work
18:38
out what it was so
18:39
bits of this meat kept getting posted
18:41
from one scientist to the next who all
18:43
tasted
18:43
and you said it went through several
18:45
sections
18:48
so then it was sent to this guy called
18:49
leopold brandeis
18:51
who said it tasted like frog or spring
18:53
chicken legs
18:55
which was and then i read in a british
18:57
newspaper at the time and
18:58
they were saying we have heard of
19:00
showers of frogs which ought to be
19:02
acceptable in france
19:03
but we do prefer uh the idea of mutton
19:06
tasting meat in britain which is just
19:07
another nice example of 19th century
19:09
newspaper racism really
19:10
i read as well that uh someone and this
19:13
is this is a call back for
19:14
long-term listeners but someone after
19:16
they thought that it wasn't mutton
19:18
they thought that it was star jelly that
19:20
they thought it was the myst
19:21
medical appearance this was leopold
19:23
brandeis right yeah
19:25
he said it tasted like frog um and all
19:28
chicken legs and that's what he imagined
19:29
star jelly would taste like so it was
19:31
that
19:31
and then it was sent to lots of other
19:32
scientists who said no it's not and they
19:34
concluded it definitely had
19:36
animal cartilage uh lung tissue seven
19:39
samples were examined by several
19:41
scientists
19:42
who confirmed some of it to be lung
19:43
tissue some of it to muscular tissue
19:46
and two samples to be made of cartilage
19:49
can i
19:49
tell you a theory that arose at the time
19:51
this was from the new york times it was
19:52
a journalist called william
19:54
olden william livingston alden he said
19:56
and he was not being entirely serious
19:58
here but it was a kind of meteor shower
20:03
he said according to the present theory
20:04
of astronomers an enormous belt of
20:06
meteoric stones constantly revolves
20:07
around the sun
20:08
and where the earth comes into contact
20:10
with this belch is soundly pelted
20:11
similarly we may suppose that there
20:13
revolves about the sun
20:14
a belt of venison muscle and other means
20:17
divided into small fragments which are
20:19
precipitated upon the earth
20:20
not a serious theory he was trying to be
20:22
funny so the most serious theory which
20:24
arose at the time and this is what they
20:25
still think it was is vulture vomit
20:26
because vultures
20:27
as i think we know uh vomit is a defense
20:30
mechanism
20:30
and they can vomit quite a lot and the
20:32
combination of stuff it was seems to
20:34
imply that vultures would have been
20:35
soaring really high
20:36
um above which they can soar up to seven
20:39
miles above the ground
20:40
so it would have caused it to scatter
20:42
that far seven
20:43
miles yeah seven miles in the air they
20:45
float the highest bird ever
20:47
found was found when it crashed into a
20:48
plane actually but um it was flying
20:50
much higher than mountains that's pretty
20:52
pretty harsh for this bird that's like
20:53
i'm higher than everyone's ever been
20:56
smacked yeah this is why they don't do
20:58
that
20:59
so vulture vomit is done as a defense
21:02
mechanism
21:03
and uh one of the things i was reading
21:04
about it was if a vulture
21:06
has a predator attacking it the reason
21:09
it will vomit
21:10
uh one one reason might be that it's
21:13
quite
21:13
it's got a bit of acidic stuff in in the
21:15
vomit and it could go in the eyes of the
21:17
predator and sting and make them go off
21:18
but the other reason
21:19
is that it's an offering to say if
21:22
you're hungry have this instead of me
21:24
i know coyotes can eat vulture vomit but
21:26
it is so acidic because vultures
21:28
stomachs that's why vultures can eat
21:29
like
21:30
dead rotting gross meat yeah yeah their
21:31
stomachs can really
21:33
break that down yeah because
21:34
they're so acidic so i'm surprised that
21:36
many things
21:37
can eat vulture vomit but also it
21:39
doesn't sound like much of an offering
21:40
does it it's like
21:41
oh don't eat me eat this disgusting
21:44
acidic
21:44
rotting meat yeah yeah yeah yeah you're
21:47
like i don't know actually i'm gonna eat
21:48
you
21:48
yeah um bearded vultures eat seventy to
21:52
ninety percent
21:52
bone yeah that's amazing and that's as
21:55
you say their stomach acid
21:57
is what allows them is incredibly strong
21:59
and also it's what
22:00
lets them have um they can destroy
22:03
cholera and anthrax bacteria
22:05
oh yeah which is why they can eat such
22:07
yeah they've got lots of antibodies that
22:09
nothing else has yeah vultures will
22:11
often peck at dead animals um
22:13
through their anus i'm sorry to say
22:17
and really how do they get the beak back
22:18
through the rain
22:21
um it's to get at the entrails which are
22:24
full of good stuff do you guys know what
22:26
a group of vultures
22:27
it's called yeah what is it the kettle
22:30
kettle yes that is one of many there are
22:33
other
22:34
ones on a vault yep there's five in
22:37
total
22:38
what the others kettle vault anna do you
22:40
want to throw one in ah
22:41
damn it i can't remember a culture of
22:43
vultures oh that'd be
22:44
very good but no there's a wake and a
22:47
committee
22:49
and a venue and
22:53
that would be terrible wouldn't it if
22:54
you're having a party hello i'd like to
22:55
book a venue please for my party
22:58
three weeks later a load of vultures
22:59
turn up at your door
23:04
oh this is worse than nero's parties
23:09
uh yeah the uh kettle refers to vultures
23:12
in flight
23:13
uh committees vault and venue refers to
23:15
them when they're resting in trees
23:16
and awake must be when they're eating
23:18
dead stuff it's when they're feeding
23:20
yeah makes sense yeah um turkey vultures
23:24
we on their own legs yeah so does buzz
23:26
aldrin yep
23:29
was he doing it for the same reason i
23:30
was just trying to cool myself down i
23:32
think that's what they do
23:33
they do it to cool themselves down and
23:34
also there's a theory that the urine is
23:36
quite acidic and it might be a way of
23:37
sterilizing their legs because they
23:39
stand in a lot of rotting flesh to feed
23:41
that's a good idea
23:42
yeah i wanted to move on to just quickly
23:44
to things falling from the sky
23:46
um i found an article from a few years
23:49
ago and this was a woman who described
23:51
how a mysterious rock
23:52
fell from the sky onto a derby street
23:55
not
23:56
a passing goose to the ground
23:59
that is mysterious she thought it might
24:01
have been a meteorite or something like
24:03
that but dr andrew johnson
24:04
a geologist of the university of derby
24:07
didn't think he was he thought he was
24:08
something
24:09
like a piece of limestone from the peak
24:10
district and they asked him yeah but how
24:12
come it came from the sky
24:13
and he said i haven't got a clue where
24:15
it came from unless somebody threw it in
24:17
the air
24:21
did you see that story this week about a
24:23
guy in san francisco who owned a chinese
24:25
restaurant who was trying to
24:26
defrost some meat out on the street he
24:29
was caught tenderizing his meat by
24:31
bashing it on the pavement
24:32
and stamping on it and so they examine
24:34
the pavement which was covered in
24:35
blackened gum
24:36
cigarette butts and track bacteria of
24:38
all gut-twisting varieties
24:40
according to the article at least it's
24:44
tender
24:47
okay time for our final fact and that is
24:49
andrew hunter murray
24:51
my fact is that the victorians invented
24:53
a
24:54
coat which doubled up as a boat
25:10
that's amazing um it was designed by a
25:12
man called peter halkett who was a naval
25:14
officer
25:15
and uh he wanted something which you
25:17
could go exploring with
25:19
and take it over frozen terrain
25:22
but which would cope in extreme weather
25:23
and which might get you out of a tight
25:25
spot
25:25
so if the frozen terrain started melting
25:27
i guess the idea is it's getting warmer
25:28
i don't need my coat anymore but i do
25:31
need something
25:33
um how did it work it's amazing it was
25:36
made of rubber and you should you should
25:37
look for it online
25:38
we should try and put up a picture of it
25:40
i'll put it on your twitter
25:41
um which is that it had four separate
25:44
compartments very sensible in case one
25:46
of them got punctured and it took a few
25:47
minutes to inflate and then it can
25:48
support the weight of eight people
25:51
yeah and um i mean the designs he tested
25:54
a prototype on the river thames
25:56
and he went nine miles on it and some
25:57
explorers did genuinely take it with
25:59
them
26:00
so i guess if you're one of the seven
26:01
people who doesn't have the coat you
26:03
have to not take the piss out the idiot
26:05
in the huge boat shape
26:08
just in case it floods it's yeah
26:11
well it's like that um bra gas mask that
26:13
won the ignoble
26:15
prizes yeah prize a few years ago it's
26:16
got two cups therefore can support two
26:18
people this is like an earlier version
26:20
of that
26:21
yeah um another thing that brown's been
26:22
made to do it's called the wine rack
26:24
um and it's a bra that can carry more
26:26
than a bottle's worth of wine
26:28
um and so it has the double benefit of
26:30
increasing your cup size
26:32
so you pour the wine into it and you can
26:34
kind of suck it out you pour the wine
26:35
into it it's got a straw attached
26:36
it's made to hold the wine oh like one
26:38
of those cool sports hats that you have
26:40
it uh
26:41
when you watch baseball what are those
26:42
cool yeah
26:45
dan's wearing one now he's been wearing
26:47
one since the first episode
26:49
i'm actually wearing a brass another one
26:52
for men which is the beer belly which is
26:54
much less attractive and it can carry a
26:56
six equivalent of a six pack of beer
26:58
very good but then during the night the
27:00
man gets slimmer and the woman's breasts
27:02
get smaller so he's getting more
27:03
attractive while she should have
27:05
uh like in his trousers to make his
27:07
bulge look bigger shouldn't it yes
27:09
yeah yeah the cocktail
27:12
[Laughter]
27:15
that movie has an old different meaning
27:17
now doesn't it
27:18
um yeah so this uh this boat it's just a
27:22
coat boat fantastic convention yeah how
27:25
would you inflate it or
27:26
is it i don't know i think it was
27:29
i mean it's quite a big thing so i
27:31
presume you wouldn't have to be blowing
27:32
it up
27:33
yeah no i think you'd have to pump it up
27:36
yeah
27:36
because that'd be amazing at dinner when
27:37
you're taking your coat off
27:39
and an eight-seater boat plates around
27:42
the tree
27:44
just come back to the restaurant cloak
27:46
room with your little ticket
27:48
which one is yours yeah it's the black
27:50
one that looks like a boat
27:53
yeah we've got eight of those which
27:55
which one is it
27:56
you explorers the last time we're
27:58
hosting the royal geographical society
28:00
dinner here
28:02
well the idea of the thing it came with
28:04
a walking stick
28:05
which can fold out into either a paddle
28:08
uh or a large umbrella
28:09
and so you can set sail with the
28:11
umbrella or ro row with the paddle
28:13
actually i read about a really
28:14
interesting invention from roughly the
28:16
same period
28:17
uh which was a cane it was a
28:19
multi-purpose cane
28:20
uh effectively the swiss army knife of
28:22
caine's and it could do it could do a
28:24
number of things it could
28:26
uh it could be transformed into a flute
28:28
so you can
28:29
play your cane as a flute um you could
28:32
catch
28:33
butterflies with it so it must have had
28:36
some sort of
28:36
net that came out of it um you could
28:39
measure horses
28:40
with it that was one of the selling
28:41
points i don't know who's measuring
28:43
horses measure horses with any cane
28:45
this is three canes high that's true
28:47
that's true well this had a specific
28:49
i don't know what it is that you used
28:51
for it what was it what was the measure
28:52
horse's butterfly
28:53
net butterflies flute uh
28:56
and then it could also be an umbrella
28:59
this is my favorite thing in the
29:00
advertising of it it's
29:02
a uh that it can be an umbrella why an
29:04
umbrella why
29:05
of course to keep you dry while you
29:07
smoke your cane pipe
29:10
so it was also a pipe so it's fantastic
29:14
and another one with more than one use
29:16
um albert pratt
29:18
invented a thing called a gun helmet
29:20
which was a helmet with a gun on it
29:22
[Laughter]
29:24
um
29:27
and it was uh very good but the one
29:29
minor disadvantage during trials was
29:31
that the recoil broke the wearer's neck
29:34
[Laughter]
29:37
the internal mystery how did both armies
29:40
end up completely
29:41
wiped out do you think there's a fault
29:43
with our gun helmet
29:46
no no more than there is with our leg
29:48
grenade
29:50
there's some really funny footage online
29:51
which i think richard wiseman found
29:53
first or it might have been in this
29:54
really good blog called brain pickings
29:56
but it's of uh when they were testing
29:58
bullets and bulletproof
29:59
glass and it's a man of women testing it
30:01
and the man's holding this gun standing
30:02
about
30:03
25 feet from this woman who's just
30:04
holding this tiny piece of bulletproof
30:07
glass in front of her face
30:08
and letting him shoot her whoa it's
30:11
great and she just kind of rocks back
30:13
and it's like go again hit me again
30:14
it's very terrifying seeing someone
30:16
being shot at it's really
30:17
counter-intuitive
30:18
yeah it's confusing to me why they
30:19
always put the person behind the bullet
30:21
proof glass attachment well if they put
30:22
in front of it it's not really gonna
30:23
work
30:25
it was an ancestor of anna's who
30:26
invented the gun helmet
30:29
um i found a patent in 1890 for
30:33
a combined stepladder cot ironing board
30:36
and
30:37
chair um and it was designed
30:40
it was invented by one stephen fry oh
30:43
really
30:43
yeah in one yeah 1890 wow
30:46
prestigious maybe that's what he was
30:48
doing before blackout yeah
30:50
i have one funny thing on coats okay uh
30:53
so draco who wrote down the first legal
30:55
code
30:56
um i think it was in the seventh century
30:57
bc draconian comes from where draconian
31:00
comes from
31:01
um do you guys know how he died no
31:04
it is written that it was a sign of
31:06
appreciation if someone was doing a
31:07
public performance which he would
31:09
to um in public throw your coats at him
31:12
as like hello i guess that would throw
31:13
flowers or something at someone now
31:15
you threw your coat at him and the way
31:17
he died was one person had a boat
31:20
an eight-seater boat crushed draco
31:24
it was basically that the way he died
31:26
was he suffocated under a huge pile of
31:29
appreciative coats
31:30
oh really oh yeah because people
31:32
actually liked him didn't they people
31:33
liked him yeah
31:34
he despised his draconian measures oh my
31:36
god why are there no pictures of
31:38
like people most appreciated person of
31:40
the year and it's just a picture of
31:41
coats
31:43
you don't see the person it's that was
31:45
still true cloak room attendance would
31:47
be the most respected people in society
31:50
that's true uh someone's invented a
31:52
jacket where
31:53
you wear it as a normal jacket but
31:55
there's an extra arm that hangs out so
31:57
that your girlfriend can get underneath
31:58
the arm
31:59
but you don't need to have your arm over
32:01
her so you have two functioning arms and
32:03
it's a third arm but does that not knock
32:05
people over in the street when you're
32:06
just walking around when you've been
32:07
dumped
32:08
yeah that's a sad sign walking home as
32:10
you will be five minutes after you say
32:12
don't worry darling just put this fake
32:14
arm over yourself and feel comforted
32:16
i've delegated the touching of you to
32:18
this product i have bought
32:20
[Laughter]
32:21
they've also developed mattresses which
32:24
have grooves in them so that you can put
32:26
your arm underneath
32:28
rather than getting your arm trapped
32:29
under whoever you're in bed with
32:31
because there's always a problem that if
32:33
you're lying on your
32:34
side where do you put your other arm
32:37
which is underneath you
32:38
oh yeah so it's got an armhole okay yeah
32:40
yeah
32:41
and then you can just hold on you're
32:42
saying the armhole is for a girlfriend
32:44
well as a man you would lie in bed and
32:46
put your arm in the groove and then your
32:47
girlfriend would lie on the other side
32:48
of the bed so
32:49
you're i'm with you but james so that
32:51
implies a horizontal groove but then
32:52
james's way which i prefer because i'm
32:54
not
32:54
into the whole arms in bed what's that
32:55
about um with a boyfriend thing
32:58
um i have a fake hard product you might
33:00
be interested in
33:05
i like the idea of somewhere to put your
33:06
arm when it wasn't that has been invited
33:08
as well
33:08
i think they're two different inventions
33:10
yeah they are you feel like someone was
33:11
plagiarizing someone else there
33:14
from the people who brought you the
33:16
horizontal bed group the vertical
33:18
bedroom
33:20
um one more thing about inventions so um
33:23
you know how
33:24
car horns are kind of like like quite
33:27
horrible noises they used to be much
33:30
nicer
33:31
and they changed that um because one of
33:34
edison's assistants had a car
33:36
and he nearly ran over someone in newark
33:39
after and noted that his angel's harp
33:41
noise of his horn didn't have any impact
33:44
on the pedestrian
33:45
and he realized that he had to have a
33:46
much harsher sounding horn yeah it'd be
33:49
quite nice ending if you did actually
33:50
hit someone because they didn't see your
33:52
car
33:52
coming and as they were dying you play
33:54
the angel noise to make them think
33:57
they're going somewhere nice that might
33:59
be a nice comforting ending
34:01
nice ending
34:03

no such thing as a fish
00:48
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
00:49
qi offices in covent garden
00:51
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
00:53
here with anna chazinski and miller and
00:55
andy murray and once again we have
00:57
gathered
00:58
around the microphones with our four
00:59
favorite facts from the last seven days
01:01
and in a particular order here we go
01:07
starting with you andy my fact is that
01:10
in 18th century france
01:11
tooth pullers were entertainers who
01:12
performed in front of
01:14
cheering crowds so one of them had the
01:17
party trick of
01:18
pulling teeth out of a patient with one
01:20
hand while firing a pistol with the
01:22
other
01:22
and all the while he had his head in a
01:24
sack
01:26
why was he shooting i don't get the gun
01:27
shooting bit it's just it's a touch of
01:29
flamboyance
01:30
yeah it was it was entertainment yeah
01:33
yeah
01:34
i've got a really painful tooth great
01:35
well i've got a show on
01:37
8 p.m there was one guy who did that in
01:40
the late
01:41
1800s who was called edgar parker he
01:43
might be the person you're talking about
01:45
okay i think he's edgar parker and he
01:46
changed his name by deadpool to painless
01:48
parker
01:49
that's really cool yeah james iv of
01:52
scotland
01:52
was a keen amateur dentist a keen
01:55
amateur
01:56
sounds a bit like he wasn't good at
01:58
being even an amateur
01:59
yeah she's tried really hard don't give
02:01
up sun don't give up
02:03
one day you could make amateur
02:05
[Laughter]
02:06
glorious day um well peter the great did
02:09
that as well he
02:10
practiced it on his nobles dentistry so
02:13
if you had a toothache and peter the
02:14
great was around you had to keep it to
02:16
yourself yeah because otherwise he'd say
02:17
come on get in the chair no anesthesia
02:20
yeah
02:24
i have something for that i'll just get
02:26
my hammer yeah jesus get my brain sore
02:28
um and he kept all the extracted teeth
02:30
in a little bag he was very proud of it
02:32
and it's now in the uh the kunst camera
02:33
at the museum in
02:34
petersburg there's a bunch of fairies
02:36
planning a heist
02:39
mark zuckerberg's dad is a dentist and
02:41
his website advertisers or used to
02:43
advertise we cater for cowards
02:45
and he's he specifically targets people
02:47
who have death that's a really good idea
02:49
it's right because i think
02:50
they're quite anti and emphasizing if
02:51
you don't need it but some people get so
02:53
freaked out by the dentist yeah his
02:54
website should say we pull teeth out of
02:56
your facebook
02:58
[Laughter]
03:00
um so i read that the egyptians used to
03:02
use toothpaste way before toothbrushes
03:03
were invented yeah
03:04
and but it doesn't sound very nice it
03:06
was things like ox hoops ashes burnt
03:08
eggshells and pumice
03:09
oh yeah lovely sounds penis
03:14
worst chatter blind ever or excuse for
03:17
infidelity
03:18
i lost my toothbrush darling
03:22
the plumber happened to be here
03:23
[Laughter]
03:26
um so the egyptians used the gross
03:29
toothpaste 5000 years before the
03:30
toothbrush was invented
03:31
first toothbrush was made with the
03:32
bristles from a pig's neck bristles from
03:34
a pig's neck
03:36
better than the penises the ancient
03:37
egyptians that's true it's definitely an
03:39
improvement
03:41
in 2013 a man escaped from prison in
03:44
sweden to go to the dentist
03:46
he went to the dentist he had the
03:47
affected tooth pulled out and then he
03:49
reported himself to the police and they
03:50
took him back to prison
03:51
he got a day added to his sentence as
03:53
punishment that's fantastic yep
03:55
did he book uh
04:01
[Music]
04:09
[Laughter]
04:13
while i'm here do you have large sums of
04:15
cash on the premises
04:16
[Laughter]
04:19
just because your fact was about
04:21
obviously uh funny sorts of
04:22
entertainment in
04:23
um centuries past and freak shows there
04:26
was
04:27
a guy joseph poo pujol or pujol
04:30
who in the 19th century made his living
04:32
by farting
04:33
and his living was yeah yeah what
04:36
standard
04:36
was it was he what yes he was
04:40
there's a whole film about him he was
04:41
incredible yes there is
04:43
a good fight yeah he could suck air in
04:45
through his bottom and then
04:46
do tunes he retired from his farting
04:49
career
04:50
to become a baker after the first time
04:52
oh no i wouldn't eat his pies
04:54
i do wonder how successful he was in
04:56
that so he went from breaking wind to
04:58
breaking bread
04:59
oh just a joke for you all he claimed
05:02
that the farts also did not smell
05:04
he memorably said my parents ruined
05:07
themselves scenting my rectum what
05:10
who is this man what does that mean he
05:12
was a french cabaret
05:14
entertainer he's really improved
05:17
his parents have spent an enormous
05:18
amount of money making sure that his
05:20
his farts did not smell bad like a scent
05:22
like a
05:30
every 15 minutes he just releases
05:32
another waft of lavender into the room
05:38
time for fact number two and that is
05:41
anna my fact this week is that in the
05:44
first world war the romanian army
05:46
issued an order that only officers above
05:48
the rank of major
05:50
had the right to wear eye shadow in
05:51
battle that's interesting
05:54
very funny no there are so many elements
05:56
in that
05:57
the rank of major then wearing eyeshadow
05:59
and then in battle
06:00
presumably outside battle all bets were
06:02
off yeah yeah outside badly you can do
06:04
what you are
06:07
battle we don't care what do you do have
06:09
a good time yeah no varnish still all
06:10
right
06:11
i think nail varnish is okay but again
06:13
in the us army new regulations there's
06:15
recently been a ban
06:16
on men wearing nail polish who's doing
06:19
that in china and japan a few thousand
06:21
years ago everyone
06:22
painted the nails okay i think you did
06:24
maybe there's a that's a niche little
06:26
kind of tribute group to ancient china
06:28
that exists in the u.s
06:29
crack down on the romans used to paint
06:32
the nails with blood
06:34
it'd go weird brown almost immediately
06:35
wouldn't it yeah they keep reapplying a
06:37
fresh supply
06:38
yeah that's the only reason they were
06:40
saying murderers actually was
06:41
getting an army because they couldn't
06:43
tell who was murdering because everyone
06:45
had blood on their hands
06:46
in those days you've got blood on your
06:47
hands wasn't a bad thing it was just it
06:49
was just a statement of fact about
06:50
everyone
06:50
looking at you blood on your hands yeah
06:52
yeah yeah that's true
06:54
yeah super drug two for three pounds
06:56
it's smudged a little bit actually it's
06:58
also on your knife
06:59
[Laughter]
07:01
that's where we get cosmetics from is
07:02
roman times they had cosmetics
07:05
who were slaves whose job was to apply
07:06
makeup and perfume to their mistresses
07:08
and help out with the
07:09
toilette so that's where we get the web
07:10
from cosmetics
07:12
do you know where we got the word makeup
07:13
from you see those adverts for a max
07:15
factor the makeup of makeup artists
07:17
he was an actual guy called max baxter
07:19
yes so his name was maximilian in fact
07:21
doritz he's from poland
07:22
and he coined makeup as a noun from to
07:24
make up your face as a verb and he was
07:25
the first one to turn into a noun
07:26
he was the first person and that is why
07:29
it's extremely hard to research makeup
07:31
if you're looking for
07:32
what people were wearing in the olden
07:33
times a brand new bloody word and
07:35
there's no real old equivalent for it
07:38
except on your hands turns out some of
07:40
history's biggest murderers were
07:41
actually just
07:42
height of fashion the ancient romans
07:46
who were bold would disguise it by
07:48
painting their heads
07:50
when it rains it it sort of seems to uh
07:53
it grows it slides like it grows
07:55
yeah my favorite fact that i've read
07:57
about the whole thing of like just what
07:59
you're allowed to wear in war and so on
08:01
is that hygiene and clothing was quite a
08:03
big thing they always wanted
08:04
the soldiers to have clean clothes so
08:06
apparently anytime you saw
08:07
a battlefield there would always be huge
08:10
clothing lines
08:11
just behind where they were stationed of
08:14
people
08:14
drying their clothes for them and
08:16
getting them clean yeah so anywhere that
08:18
an army moved behind them was almost a
08:20
laundry room
08:21
yeah that came along yeah where were you
08:23
in the war were you on the front line
08:24
i was really on the washing line
08:29
um speaking of effeminate did you see
08:30
those pictures of north korean soldiers
08:32
female soldiers who wear stilettos
08:34
when they're on parade they're trying to
08:36
look taller like cats are making
08:37
themselves look big
08:39
maybe well that's why we uh have the
08:41
bear skins isn't it
08:42
even trying to fool incredibly stupid
08:45
enemies of the crowd
08:48
british have really long heads i've got
08:50
massive skulls
08:52
um so i find the bearskins quite weird
08:56
that they still exist do you know how
08:57
many bears
08:58
it takes to make one of those hats or
09:00
how many hats per bear
09:01
you could probably get 10 hats from a
09:03
bear you think 10 hats from a bear yeah
09:05
it's
09:05
quite big does the hat
09:08
include the head of the bear or is it
09:11
just the skin
09:11
yeah that's what they've got underneath
09:12
the hat is right this is the roaring
09:14
head that's the last line of defense
09:16
yeah is the bed take off the hat you
09:19
unleash the bear
09:20
at the right moment so one
09:23
bear one hat per bear yeah and so every
09:26
year we need
09:27
a hundred new ones and so 100 bears
09:29
we're killing a year that's terrible
09:31
just the edge of the guy just cut a tiny
09:34
square out of this bare skin
09:36
throw the rest away are you sure we can
09:38
make nine or ten more hats out of this
09:39
single basket no no
09:41
no no we want only the finest back hair
09:43
from the bear
09:44
you know small of the back that's it
09:47
june rig as i went i went bear trekking
09:48
in greece a few months ago
09:50
yeah did you see any bears um of course
09:53
not they're all in buckingham palace
09:54
they're all in the house
09:56
just go watch the changing of the garage
09:57
checking there yeah we saw lots of
09:59
tracks but we didn't see any of the wild
10:00
um i wanted a really cool makeup fact
10:02
did you know that um dave myers from the
10:04
harry bikers
10:04
started his career as a makeup artist
10:06
did he specialize in prosthetics he
10:08
watched the bbc that's where he met sly
10:10
king the other harry biker he was a
10:11
locations manager and
10:12
uh first aid on films including harry
10:14
potter and they met on the end
10:16
of catherine cookson drama can you guess
10:17
what samuel peeps
10:19
bought his wife to uh
10:22
to improve her looks was it his cheese
10:25
no that
10:25
was your guess it's it's not nice i'll
10:27
tell you that much oh a snake
10:29
no no it was puppy urine
10:33
you'll get plenty of europe that's true
10:35
upon up with some little discontent with
10:37
my wife upon her saying that she had got
10:39
and used some puppy dog water
10:42
um being put upon it by a great desire
10:43
of my aunt white who has the mind to get
10:45
some for her ugly face
10:47
oh he's a charmer it's your anniversary
10:49
darling liquid i've got you
10:51
so ugly puppy urine will improve your
10:54
face right now
10:55
i'm not going near you until you've
10:57
covered yourself in dog weed
10:59
quite possibly the worst anniversary um
11:01
so looking into military dress
11:03
drab is a color um so drought comes from
11:06
in the 19th century when the british
11:07
army was stopping colorful and we
11:08
started wearing camouflage we started
11:10
wearing a dull brown color
11:11
it was drab and everyone dressed up in
11:13
drab that is fantastic i can
11:14
legitimately say to my girlfriend you're
11:15
looking very drab tonight here and she
11:17
can't be offended by that
11:18
would you say to her you're looking very
11:19
red tonight or very blue dress
11:21
say your outfit is very good i'm sorry
11:24
that's what i mean
11:25
[Applause]
11:26
i
11:28
time to move on to fact number three and
11:30
that is anne
11:31
my fact is that the most borrowed
11:32
children's author from british libraries
11:34
doesn't exist
11:36
how does she not exist she's not a real
11:38
person
11:39
okay what what's her name daisy meadows
11:43
but she's syndicate sort of she's a
11:45
front for this group so it's a series of
11:47
books called rainbow magic they're
11:49
crazy popular there are over 150 of them
11:51
they saw over 20 million copies
11:53
and it's a company called working
11:55
partners who created the book they make
11:56
it by committee
11:57
nobody owns any of the ideas any of the
11:59
characters they have a bunch of writers
12:00
who write the books
12:01
they're basically loads of them
12:02
basically a mini series you get the pets
12:04
series or the
12:05
school fairies there was one i read
12:07
about called the pop star fairies and
12:09
they
12:09
all have names that kids will recognize
12:10
there's jessie presumably jessie j adele
12:12
the singing fairy
12:14
miley the stylist fairy but there are
12:16
seven in the series
12:17
and four of them are did you guys know
12:19
this band so think of a band that have a
12:20
vanessa a frankie a rochelle and una
12:23
there's saturdays right there are five
12:25
people in the saturdays
12:26
molly's the other one molly's the other
12:27
one so she's not wow let me just take a
12:30
moment shall we
12:31
yep and see what just happened there i i
12:33
just know there's a molly in the
12:34
saturday there's somalia
12:36
because you read that phrase don't you
12:37
molly from the saturdays yes
12:39
but it's very pop culture do they are
12:40
they directly doing that yes
12:43
characters look very similar um i don't
12:45
know what they look like because i
12:46
haven't actually read the full series
12:47
myself
12:48
but i did notice that you're researching
12:50
i'm really sorry because i didn't read
12:52
all 200 books
12:53
um but so they have things um like they
12:56
brought elizabeth the jubilee theory
12:58
okay they have hates the royal wedding
13:00
fairy more cynically
13:01
they brought out alexandra the royal
13:03
baby fairy in may 2013. prince george
13:05
was born in july 2013.
13:07
and i'm pretty sure alexander was a
13:08
running favorite if it had been a girl
13:10
so it's like an alternative timeline now
13:12
maybe fairies have different pregnancy
13:14
um periods yeah maybe they only go for
13:17
six months
13:18
i don't think it's ever been documented
13:19
uh so these have become quite popular
13:21
collaborative writing
13:22
it's it's a thing now there's another
13:24
one called erin hunter and the reason
13:26
she's called aaron hunter
13:27
is because so that uh so the series is
13:30
pitched at the same kind of people who
13:31
like the brian jack redwall series and
13:33
the reason she's called that is because
13:34
hunter would be close to
13:35
jacques in libraries so that people who
13:37
were browsing red wall but this happens
13:39
again i think lee
13:40
child who does very well um with his
13:42
books he pictures
13:43
is a pen name and he picked it because
13:45
trial is between
13:46
christie and chandler so he thought
13:48
he'll be browsing that section then
13:49
we'll be like hey who's this new guy we
13:50
should check it out
13:51
okay right there's a new app called
13:53
inkvite have you guys heard of this no
13:55
no no
13:55
my phone doesn't do apps but it's where
13:57
you can do collaborative fiction
13:58
yourself
13:59
so it's kind of like a more pretentious
14:02
game of consequences i think where
14:03
you can invite up to four people and
14:05
you're allowed to write i think 280
14:07
words of your novel
14:08
and then you pass it on to the next
14:09
person and they right and then i think
14:11
you mean more fun rather than more
14:12
pretentious
14:12
yeah no it does sound actually quite fun
14:14
um a set of
14:16
collaborative books that i really like
14:18
i've been obsessed with them since i've
14:19
arrived in this country
14:21
uh no but sweet valley high also
14:23
obviously fits into this category um so
14:25
no this is not one single author but
14:26
mills and boone
14:28
you love mills i love the concept of
14:29
them i just love the turn around no i
14:31
really i'd love to write one one day
14:33
um i'd love to write a science fiction
14:35
one and i know that they don't have or i
14:37
thought they didn't have their own
14:38
science fiction
14:39
arm but they do there's a science
14:41
fiction paranormal arm
14:43
there's amazing titles they do this
14:44
thing by the way where they if someone
14:46
in a paranormal one visits a dinosaur
14:48
and has an erotic
14:49
moment with a dinosaur oh yeah they
14:51
don't consider it bestiality because all
14:53
the animals and crypto animals in it are
14:55
intelligent
14:55
so they're just like us consenting yeah
14:59
yeah so taken by t-rex
15:03
i remember seeing these book covers did
15:05
the rounds a while ago like dinosaur
15:06
erotica was that mills and broon all
15:08
along
15:08
that was dan emailing them
15:17
the rest are too rude frankenstein's
15:18
15:20
it's not rude that's lazy lazy lazy
15:23
writing milked by aliens
15:35
but here's the thing so mills and boone
15:37
um why i'm fascinated behind by it is
15:39
that um
15:40
no same book stays on the shelf for
15:42
longer than three months they pulp it
15:43
straight after
15:44
wow so they have a huge turnaround um
15:47
and in 2008 they were saying six point
15:50
every 6.6 seconds
15:52
someone bought a mills and boom book the
15:53
same guy there was dan
15:56
well here's the thing standing at the
15:57
till with a bigger and bigger pile next
15:58
to him you know i've got to have another
16:00
one i've finished this one already
16:02
you can read them very quickly to be
16:03
fair yeah yeah
16:05
and they they equate for three quarters
16:07
of all romance novels that are brought
16:09
into this country i like how we're
16:10
calling these romance
16:11
taken by a t-rex i've headed back to
16:14
romance
16:16
disney movie did you do that brilliant
16:19
thing
16:19
about what they do with pulp and bins oh
16:22
yeah this is a q
16:22
question yeah it was there is that the
16:24
m6 of the m8 toll road is made up of
16:26
pulp
16:26
so when you drive down you're driving
16:28
over all those taking bikes
16:29
they use the foundations and they in the
16:31
foundations to stabilize it
16:33
that's why it's always a bit of a
16:34
turn-on when you're driving driving down
16:36
the m6
16:37
only only for damn yeah turn left then
16:38
turn on
16:39
[Music]
16:40
very good so i was looking at libraries
16:43
and
16:44
the tarzan books were banned from some
16:46
libraries in america in the 1950s
16:48
because tarzan and jane were living in
16:49
sin
16:50
wow yeah what was the great fact you
16:52
told me about tarzan
16:53
anna it's that um oh yeah the guy who
16:55
wrote tarzan is the great grandfather
16:57
of wes anderson oh yeah true edgar rice
17:00
burroughs yes
17:02
so i was just looking at other or i
17:03
stumbled upon other stuff that's been
17:05
banned uh for amusing reasons and do you
17:07
guys remember a couple of years ago when
17:08
dictionaries were
17:09
removed from classrooms in california
17:13
a parent complained that a child
17:15
stumbled across in the merriam-webster
17:17
dictionary
17:18
the phrase oral sex so the district
17:20
spokeswoman betty cadmus told a
17:22
newspaper that the books were
17:23
immediately pulled off the shelves and
17:24
temporarily housed off location
17:26
to make sure that children didn't get
17:28
their hands on it and i really like and
17:29
it wasn't me that spotted this stunning
17:31
irony um
17:32
it was a blogger whose dennis baron
17:34
who's a professor of linguistics
17:36
pointed out that her name was betty
17:37
cadmus who was issuing the statements
17:39
cadmus was the phoenician who brought
17:42
writing to the ancient greeks
17:44
wow and she takes it away taking it away
17:47
great
17:47
it's nice isn't it so good um in the
17:49
1960s in public libraries you used to
17:51
have things which were called block
17:52
books
17:54
which were wooden blocks on the shelves
17:56
and that was in place of any books that
17:57
the librarians thought were
17:59
risque or obscene or you know like top
18:02
shelf well what you had to do basically
18:03
you had to take the block to the counter
18:05
and then they would get the book out
18:06
from under the desk and give it to you
18:08
was it to shame people because you feel
18:10
really dodgy when someone had to go
18:11
beneath the counter to get something
18:13
arriving at the front desk with just an
18:15
arm full of wooden blocks
18:16
i'd like all these please granny behind
18:19
you giving you a really disapproving
18:20
stick
18:21
it's tarzan come on um do you guys know
18:23
what the most
18:24
banned book in 2013 was i think this was
18:26
in america
18:27
wasn't trying to ban to kill a
18:28
mockingbird again i don't know that was
18:30
banned though
18:31
yeah that was famous was it was it
18:34
atheism for sexy people was it billy
18:37
this is just another excuse to slip in a
18:38
fact but billy goats gruff was banned in
18:40
oregon because it was deemed too violent
18:42
for children to be in a children's
18:43
library
18:44
oh um but i take it it wasn't that um it
18:47
was
18:48
captain underpants by dan pilkey that's
18:50
an
18:51
outrage it's one of the great works of
18:53
literature of the 20th century fantastic
18:55
kids books
18:57
never heard of them no you know they're
18:59
they're very popular they're about
19:00
school
19:00
they're about a headmaster who gets
19:02
hypnotized um into thinking that he's
19:04
captain underpants and any time
19:06
a certain key word goes off he suddenly
19:09
becomes captain underpants
19:11
and runs around with the cape and his
19:12
underpants and does adventures and it's
19:14
all in his head
19:16
i really thought you were going to say
19:17
any time a certain keyword goes on he
19:19
whips his underpants off
19:21
as you say as a head teacher i can sort
19:22
of see why why these books were banned
19:24
if he's captain underpants does he wear
19:25
his trousers over his underpants like
19:27
the opposite of superman who famously
19:29
wears his
19:29
underpants over his trousers superman's
19:31
not called captain trousers
19:34
that's where my clever analogy breaks
19:36
down unfortunately
19:38
also another banned book i was very
19:40
surprised by this uh where's wally
19:42
got banned for quite a long time like
19:44
it's so frustrating because it's too
19:45
hard
19:46
yeah yeah it's called where's waldo but
19:48
someone noticed so in america swear as
19:50
well though someone noticed that in one
19:52
of the drawings
19:53
that on a beach there was a topless lady
19:56
laying on the beach
19:57
yeah and you could i mean she was laying
19:59
on her stomach lifting up so it was kind
20:01
of more side boob
20:02
well it's obscene and i'm disgusted well
20:04
i reckon the person that found her is
20:05
probably a
20:06
genius at finding wally you can find
20:07
boobs on a page yeah well i'm sure he's
20:09
fantastic at finding oral sex in the
20:11
dictionary as well
20:11
some people are just desperate to be
20:13
offended um
20:15
i really like this in the second world
20:17
war some authorities some local
20:18
authorities
20:19
established uh they they put collections
20:22
of books in air raid shelters
20:24
so there was a tube station at bethel
20:26
green and it had four thousand books in
20:27
it and six thousand people would turn up
20:29
every night
20:30
in the shelters and they'd have a
20:31
library available to them and
20:33
they were really really sort of
20:34
intellectual books as well like uh
20:35
bertram russell and schopenhauer and
20:37
you know all kinds of oh i see the
20:39
people with low brown taste don't
20:40
deserve to be
20:42
entertained in an air race no i'm just
20:44
saying it's
20:45
it's you know very impressive thinking
20:47
of people sheltering from air raids and
20:48
also reading some of the great works but
20:50
i'd be so pissed off you're terrified
20:52
you just need something easy to distract
20:54
you and all you've got is
20:55
great works exactly i would have
20:57
preferred books with the titles like how
20:59
to survive
21:00
an air raid and how to survive being
21:03
trapped
21:04
in a small tunnel with a group of other
21:06
very very scared humans it's not very
21:08
escapist though isn't it
21:10
no making more people sort of in the
21:11
brutal realism okay well
21:13
when we're fighting over the last rat in
21:16
the tunnel and you're
21:17
quoting deep philosophy to me and dan's
21:20
munching away
21:21
on his rodent who's having the better
21:23
time because i read
21:24
101 ways to cook a rodent
21:28
the first of ever mobile library was
21:29
horse drawn that's really nice
21:31
it's so cool and they still have uh in
21:34
bits of
21:35
i think north africa they have a camel
21:36
mobile library they travel around from
21:38
town to town and they have school books
21:40
and they do have all kinds of
21:41
educational things i just think that's
21:42
incredible
21:43
wow and then when they they stay for a
21:45
few days and then they go off across the
21:46
desert again
21:47
seeking out the next air raid shelter
21:48
that would have been cool if you've gone
21:49
to an airway shelter and there were just
21:51
loads of camels there waiting for you
21:53
to be trying to eat them yes there are
21:55
some places where i
21:56
might be in the uk where you can get
21:58
books from the national health service
21:59
if you're depressed
22:01
oh i thought you meant books about the
22:02
national house that you actually mean
22:03
you can get them prescribed yeah yeah
22:04
they can get rid of my books
22:06
well kind of like bertrand russell i'm
22:07
not sure what kind of life
22:09
wound cauterizing for dummies that kind
22:11
of thing
22:13
[Music]
22:16
okay time for the final fact of this
22:18
show and that's my fact my fact this
22:20
week is that it would cost
22:22
850 quadrillion dollars
22:24
to build the death star and you're
22:27
probably wondering how
22:29
i yes i know this i discovered this fact
22:32
there's a website that you can go online
22:34
called we the people which is set up by
22:36
the white house
22:37
specifically for people who want to ask
22:39
a question to barack obama
22:41
and the idea is that you put it up as a
22:43
petition and if enough people sign it
22:45
the white house has to officially reply
22:47
and one of the questions
22:48
was a response to secure resources and
22:50
funding and begin construction of a
22:52
death star
22:53
by 2016. uh and the response
22:56
uh it was a fantastic response they said
22:58
we we can't do this we agree that we
23:00
share your desire for job creation
23:02
a strong national defense um but it's
23:04
just not on the horizon
23:05
one being that it would cost 850
23:07
quadrillion dollars uh two
23:09
the administration does not support
23:10
blowing up planets
23:12
[Laughter]
23:13
which is really nice white house
23:14
administration calculated how much it
23:16
would cost them to build
23:17
actually no it was someone else uh they
23:18
didn't as you said they provided a link
23:20
you just find
23:27
no and also uh also it would take years
23:30
and years to gather all the material
23:31
that you would need
23:32
i think it said it would take eight
23:33
hundred and thirty three thousand
23:35
three hundred and fifteen years to make
23:37
well i'll be dead by the way to fight to
23:38
finally get enough steel to get enough
23:40
steel to actually make it on petitions
23:42
you know this recent innovation from the
23:44
british government which is that
23:45
the government has an e-petitions
23:47
website and anything that gets a hundred
23:48
thousand signatures
23:49
is passed to a business committee in the
23:52
house of commons for possible debate
23:53
this has generated quite a lot of
23:55
amazing petitions
23:57
like ban bald football players from
23:59
liverpool football club
24:00
okay uh royal baby to be given lion king
24:03
welcome
24:04
oh isn't that good yeah um what is that
24:08
held up
24:12
yeah by rafiki do you know what was
24:14
what's really cool is this we the people
24:16
site
24:16
um it's actually in terms of research
24:19
really a fantastic place to find stuff
24:21
out so uh one of the
24:22
petitions was asking the white house if
24:24
they could release the recipe for the
24:25
honey ale home brewed
24:27
at the white house i'll just quickly
24:28
just very quickly tell you about it
24:29
which is uh so president obama bought a
24:31
home brewing kit for his kitchen in the
24:33
white house
24:34
and then they had the chefs and they had
24:36
all the people who work there
24:38
who do brew their own beer come and sort
24:40
of create this ultimate kind of
24:42
recipe that they could then use and now
24:44
they stick to this one recipe
24:46
and it's the white house's official
24:48
honey ale brewing beer that they all
24:51
it's a drink they all drink there it's
24:52
the first as well i've learned from this
24:53
article it's the first evidence that
24:55
there's been
24:56
beer brewed in the white house um so
24:58
they have in the past have
25:00
known that george washington used to do
25:01
whiskey but that wasn't
25:03
in the white house uh that jefferson
25:05
used to make wine but again
25:06
um that was uh maybe that was in the
25:08
white house but this is definitely the
25:10
first beer
25:10
in the white house so president obama
25:12
has given the white house a beer
25:14
ah at least he brought them something
25:16
here yeah nice isn't it
25:18
i don't mean that i quite like him and
25:20
lastly what's really nice is the
25:22
uh the ingredients for the beer is all
25:24
unique
25:25
but honey particularly because they use
25:27
honey that they tap from the first ever
25:29
bee
25:30
hive that the white house has had which
25:32
is on the south lawn
25:33
oh their old honey their own beer so
25:35
it's their own beehive
25:37
to create the honey for their own home
25:39
brewed honey a bunch of kind of rural
25:41
hippies really aren't there yeah and if
25:43
it takes off they might leave this whole
25:44
government nonsense they might just go
25:46
into beer brewing
25:47
that is what the republicans want them
25:48
to do yeah smaller government and we
25:50
want more
25:51
home brewed honey ale obama don't get us
25:53
wrong we like your beer
25:57
do you wanna know my favorite star wars
25:58
facts go on oh yeah it's
26:00
that in sync the band justin
26:02
timberlake's band made a cameo
26:03
in star wars episode two attack of the
26:05
clones but they were cut out the final
26:06
version yeah thank god
26:07
another thing i love about star wars yes
26:09
um dave prouse he was darth vader's body
26:12
dave proust is also the green cross code
26:13
man he gave an interview a few days ago
26:14
where he said that that was his best
26:15
rule of his life was not not being
26:17
raided being the goodie and saving lives
26:19
you just ruined darth vader for a lot of
26:21
captivated and terrified
26:27
darth vader never crossed the road
26:28
between two cars you'll notice that in
26:30
all the films all the films
26:31
no matter what he might do he did
26:33
crosstalk never does it once david
26:35
has the best title of an autobiography
26:36
for me what is it i think
26:38
it's uh it's called straight from the
26:39
force's mouth that is very good
26:42
kind of he doesn't talk uh in star wars
26:45
well he's not known for his thoughts he
26:46
was going to have the voice of darth
26:48
vader
26:48
he was convinced that he was going to
26:49
have it and then they revealed that
26:51
actually
26:52
we don't really want a west country
26:53
accent for this master of yeah
26:56
but there is a video kicking about him
26:57
doing the voice i've seen it it's
26:58
brilliant
26:59
i actually came up with what i thought
27:01
was a better title for his book
27:03
which is the empire strikes hardback
27:05
that is very good
27:07
for paperback um star trek invented the
27:09
touchscreen
27:10
did it did it everything so star trek
27:12
yeah yes um captain kirk
27:14
used to write with his little
27:15
touchscreen pen thing um
27:17
on a touch screen i mean it's not like
27:20
on set they have this new touchscreen
27:22
thing that they've invented going
27:23
guys should we patent this now or should
27:25
we continue with the series
27:27
that is true it is substantially harder
27:28
to to invent an ipad than it is to say
27:31
i've got a magic device that lets me do
27:32
anything talk to anyone
27:34
like jk rowling invented the
27:35
invisibility cloak i think we should
27:37
we should we should invent something
27:39
right now invisibility click does exist
27:41
now
27:41
doesn't it um reflective stuff
27:45
you can see it seeing the issue i
27:47
thought you couldn't it doesn't
27:48
it you can put it over your hand or your
27:49
head they've tried it and it doesn't
27:50
tamper with anything around it and you
27:52
can't you can see the background behind
27:54
it anyway that's been invented a
27:55
hoverboard's been invented which is
27:56
apparently a thing from back to the
27:57
future which is another thing
27:58
i saw footage of it the other day it
28:00
looks amazing it does look funny it does
28:01
look really cool i mean it looks
28:03
very beta it looks very you know early
28:05
stages right it is working that's
28:07
fantastic
28:07
there's a great blog about star trek
28:09
inventions years ago it came out so
28:11
i'm sure most people if they know star
28:13
trek know this but someone did a list of
28:15
all the things that star trek didn't
28:16
invent
28:17
um including cup holders
28:20
on the ship they always are the cup in
28:22
the head uh seat belts
28:25
you think a seat belt they're always
28:26
flying around
28:28
when they're attacked yeah on star
28:30
trek inventing touch screens
28:32
the first touchscreen in real life was
28:34
invented in 1888
28:36
and it was invented by this person
28:37
called alicia gray and it was like a
28:39
kind of fax machine so it used this
28:41
electric pen
28:42
to transmit an electric signal across
28:44
wires and it meant you could draw a
28:45
picture
28:45
and then someone at the other end in
28:47
1888 could see the picture that you'd
28:48
drawn
28:49
and this was used for things that needed
28:50
signatures so it was used quite commonly
28:53
in hospitals and banks and stuff
28:54
you'd be like oh you need me to sign
28:56
that i'm sorry i'm not here but i'll
28:57
just sign that over the phone that's
28:59
amazing that is amazing
29:00
yeah we still can't do that well we
29:02
don't anymore do we lose it we obviously
29:04
so we've lost technology i mean i
29:05
i don't know i've never been able to
29:07
sign over the telephone
29:08
me neither but you can't key in your
29:10
page well we can't do
29:14
[Music]
29:16
i don't believe that me either it's so
29:19
exciting
29:20
it's a real thing i suppose it sends an
29:22
electric signal of a device moving over
29:24
paper doesn't it yeah yeah but we just
29:26
we don't have that don't we in we're
29:28
using a like sure i've got one somewhere
29:30
google docs
29:32
check your drawer alex has probably
29:34
gotten in the station recovered
29:36
he's been telling us to use it for years
29:37
yeah can i tell you my favorite star
29:39
trek fact this will be my last star trek
29:41
fact
29:41
uh it's that spock was originally going
29:44
to be
29:45
martian he was going to be from mars wow
29:48
yeah
29:48
but he he didn't end up being martian
29:50
because the other writers kind of
29:52
laughed the idea out of the room because
29:54
they said by the time the series was
29:55
nearing the end of its first series or a
29:57
few series
29:58
we would be on mars and no one would
30:00
mean it would just not be believable
30:02
that's so funny yeah that's great so
30:04
they made them from
30:05
that they thought wouldn't be believable
30:06
with the whole of star trek yeah
30:08
everything else something about space
30:10
that i learned recently i'm reading
30:12
commander chris hadfield's book at the
30:13
moment
30:14
former captain of the international
30:16
space station he when he was out
30:18
on his first ever space walk and he was
30:20
trying to fix something on the
30:21
international space station
30:22
had a huge pain in his eye which forced
30:25
tears out of his eye
30:26
and he was saying that it ended up
30:28
sending him blind
30:29
because tears don't function like normal
30:32
tears in space they don't fall
30:33
they instead build up as a huge blob
30:35
over your eye
30:36
so he was suddenly blind completely in
30:38
one of his eyes
30:40
because this huge body of water was
30:41
sitting in front of it and it got so big
30:43
that it eventually
30:44
passed over the bridge of his nose to
30:46
his other eye so suddenly he's out in
30:48
space
30:49
and he's trying to fix the international
30:51
space station and he's
30:52
completely blind literally blinded by
30:56
his tears but he has made a double
30:57
bubble right which is something you're
30:58
always trying to do when you're blowing
30:59
bubbles
31:00
the problem is like this is very
31:02
inconvenient
31:04
bad news nasa and some good news good
31:06
news for eight-year-old me
31:08
um but apparently what would happen is
31:10
naturally the tears would get so big
31:12
that it couldn't hold it anymore and it
31:14
would
31:14
flood space it would flood all
31:20
through a kind of as if you were looking
31:22
through goggles i guess
31:24
so i was looking at other things that
31:25
people have valued
31:27
uh fictional things they valued mr
31:29
burns's manner which is worth 127
31:31
million
31:32
dollars and but that has to include
31:34
things like a bottomless pit
31:35
which he has so a simpsons fan let's see
31:37
how many references a simpson's
31:38
fantastic can get bottomless pit a room
31:40
containing a thousand monkeys banging on
31:42
a thousand typewriters and a robotic
31:43
richard simmons
31:44
uh wayne manor would be 105 million
31:48
but also is that it yeah no it's
31:50
affordable
31:52
um but they made a real simpsons house
31:54
in 1997. they ran a competition
31:56
for someone to win the simpsons house
31:59
and the winner had a choice of either
32:01
taking him 75 000
32:03
or getting to live in the simpsons house
32:05
which have been totally recreated to
32:06
look exactly like it inside and out
32:09
but if they chose the house option they
32:11
were contractually obliged as soon as
32:13
they
32:13
took their prize to repaint it so like a
32:15
normal house again
32:16
oh so the person who won it took the 75
32:19
grand and said
32:20
i thought you were going to say the
32:21
contract was every day when they got
32:23
home
32:23
they had to recreate the intro title
32:26
secrets
32:26
which would eventually get very annoying
32:28
yeah they have to paint themselves
32:29
yellow
32:30
children fingers as well yes
32:33
yeah do they do that oh yeah of course
32:35
sorry sorry
32:38
it's that famous opening sequence of the
32:39
simpsons well they all cut
32:43

hello and welcome to another episode and
00:44
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:46
coming to you this week from the aces
00:48
and eight bar in toughnell park my name
00:50
is dan schreiber i am sitting here with
00:51
anna chazinski james harkin and andy
00:54
murray this is our christmas special and
00:56
once again we've gathered around the
00:57
microphones with our four favorite facts
00:59
in the last seven days and in no
01:01
particular order here we go we begin
01:03
with my fact my fact this week is that
01:06
before going on stage to read a
01:08
christmas carol charles dickens had a
01:11
warm-up routine of drinking a pint of
01:13
champagne
01:15
in the morning when he woke up he'd have
01:17
two tablespoons of rum
01:19
he would have the pint of champagne at
01:20
lunch and then just before he went on
01:22
stage he would have sherry which he
01:25
would mix raw egg into wow the
01:27
interesting thing is is that you would
01:29
think okay charles dickens he probably
01:31
did one or two readings of a christmas
01:33
carol you if you look into his biography
01:36
you could almost claim that he was as
01:37
much a performer as a writer he spent
01:39
years as a performer he would go on
01:41
massive tours just like michael mcintyre
01:44
he was like
01:45
properly always on tour one of his cars
01:47
in america um got him 2.3 million
01:49
dollars that's how much in today's money
01:51
that oh in today's money oh but so
01:54
another thing he used to do at his tours
01:56
is hypnotize his wife
01:58
also as a warm-up act i think okay so
02:00
that was his warm-up routine the warm-up
02:02
act hypnotized his wife he was really
02:03
into hypnosis and so he bring his wife
02:05
on stage and show off wow yeah he would
02:08
what would he make his wife do uh i
02:10
think he just made her like be able to
02:12
obey him in every way which maybe she
02:13
was doing already but it was the 19th
02:15
century
02:17
so he was really into mesmerism which i
02:20
mentioned because you like people whose
02:21
names are directly related to
02:24
the thing that they created and um anton
02:26
mesmer came up with mesmerism which is
02:28
hypnotism you know mesmer had a big tree
02:30
in his garden that people would come and
02:32
hug
02:33
and that's where tree hugging came from
02:35
he claimed that he had mesmerized it and
02:38
made it um given it some of it his
02:40
hypnotic he called it animal magnetism
02:42
didn't he yes he did yeah and he also
02:44
claimed he'd uh he also claimed he had
02:46
mesmerized the sun
02:50
again remotely and he just said yeah if
02:52
you get any sunlight you're getting some
02:54
of my mesmeric power now
02:56
i mean he was a charlatan wow charles
02:58
dickens and a christmas carol so he made
03:00
no money from it in spite of the fact
03:02
that it was incredibly popular so within
03:04
maybe six weeks there were five
03:05
different performances of it on the
03:07
stage in london all over london at
03:09
different theaters but they had not very
03:10
good copyright laws and basically
03:12
pirates stole pirates
03:16
19th century is the right time for
03:18
pirates um no actual um book pirates
03:21
what am i saying copyright pirate
03:24
it was pirated that's what i'm looking
03:25
for
03:26
and then he sued the pirates and i'm
03:28
gonna keep using the word pirates um and
03:30
they declared themselves bankrupt uh so
03:32
he was left to pay the equivalent of 56
03:35
000 pounds in modern day money in his
03:36
own legal fees because they just folded
03:38
immediately so it's quite sad for him he
03:40
did have speaking of pirates cowboy
03:42
connections paris and cowboys are kind
03:43
of connected right in people's minds um
03:45
so
03:48
they're kind of kind of cool murderous
03:50
figures from history um so
03:53
butch cassidy's grandfather was the
03:55
basis for oliver twist it is thought so
03:58
butch cassidy's great grandfather went
04:01
into business with charles dickens
04:02
father and they ended up falling apart
04:04
they both ended up in prison together um
04:06
and charles dickens grew up saying butch
04:08
cassidy's grandfather being a beggar on
04:09
the streets and oliver twist it's
04:11
thought he based he based it on butch
04:13
cassidy's grandfather that's amazing for
04:15
a second i thought you said he was the
04:16
bassist
04:17
for oliver twist
04:19
i'm not a band no not a band in that do
04:21
you know who scrooge was based on
04:23
one person they thought it might have
04:24
been based on scrooge was a guy called
04:26
jeremy wood and he was a very famous
04:28
miser back in the day um he was such a
04:31
miser that his coffin was said to be
04:33
stoned when he died they all threw
04:35
stones at him because they hated him so
04:37
much um he once went to gloucester to
04:39
chukesbury and jumped on the back of the
04:41
hearse because he didn't want to pay for
04:42
a
04:43
carriage
04:45
he
04:45
chose to die because there was a coffin
04:47
passing by
04:48
and he thought now would be a good time
04:49
to save money
04:51
and he also if you're stoning somebody's
04:52
coffin that's too late
05:00
yeah but he also would walk down the
05:02
docks and there would be coal ships
05:04
going past and he would just grab small
05:06
bits of coal that came off these ships
05:08
just so they didn't have to pay for them
05:09
pay for the call himself
05:11
so he's a real miser and they reckon
05:12
that's and he's quite famous for it at
05:14
the time as well right okay did dickens
05:15
actually base scrooge on a person though
05:18
it might be on him there's a few other
05:19
people as well right okay there's a good
05:21
person um called uh jasper pachelberten
05:24
who's in the old curiosity shop uh and
05:27
he uh killed his 14 wives by tickling
05:30
them to death
05:32
and apparently he's based on a real
05:34
person
05:35
amazingly
05:36
based on a an article in the illustrated
05:39
police news of 1869 uh entitled a wife
05:42
driven insane by a husband tickling her
05:45
feet and this guy had fooled his wife
05:47
into thinking that being tied to a plank
05:49
would help her bad back
05:51
and then once she was secured she would
05:52
uh drive her to insanity with a feather
05:55
to the feet
05:56
oh my god you can't vote for that twice
05:58
though no
06:00
can you
06:02
well you're insane by the end of the
06:03
first year yeah it's true yeah um i i uh
06:06
i was looking into rituals because i i
06:08
just love the idea that that was a thing
06:10
that as i say dickens did this he would
06:13
tour like a stand-up comedian and so he
06:15
would do that every day it's not like
06:17
this was a random thing he would get up
06:19
and have the rum and the champagne and
06:20
the sherry every single day while he was
06:22
on tour and i don't know how you can
06:24
sustain doing that but it turns out that
06:26
every great writer had some kind of
06:28
quirk of a ritual that they would stick
06:30
to uh and i was looking into a few of
06:33
those uh there's some really fun ones
06:35
tom wolf we all know tom wolf bonfire
06:37
the vanities uh his thing was he one day
06:41
had the most amazing what he said was
06:42
the most inspired burst of writing that
06:44
he's had in a very long time he was
06:46
standing by his window he had this burst
06:48
of writing and he was he loved it so
06:49
much that he just saw i need to recreate
06:51
whatever i did to lead me to this moment
06:53
of great writing and he couldn't work it
06:55
out so he kept retracing the steps and
06:57
then he worked out what it was it was
06:59
that night that he did this great burst
07:00
of riding he was standing by his window
07:02
looking outside and he was fondling his
07:04
genitals and he was like oh my god that
07:06
was it fondling my genitals is what has
07:08
made me come up with these great ideas
07:10
so that's now how tom wolf writes and we
07:12
know this as well because it was in a
07:13
letter to his editor uh where he wrote
07:16
that his penis remained limp and
07:18
unaroused like like he told his editor
07:20
i've worked out what makes me a great
07:21
writer and that that's what it is
07:23
there's tons of writers but i don't have
07:25
relied on alcohol
07:27
throughout throughout the ages so
07:29
tennessee williams the playwright
07:30
tennessee williams um angie from his
07:32
diary in 1957 reads uh two scotches at
07:35
the bar then three drinks later in the
07:38
morning um a daiquiri at dirty dicks
07:41
three glasses of red wine at lunch three
07:42
of wine at dinner also a green
07:44
tranquilizer whose name i do not know
07:46
and a yellow one i think is called
07:48
recirpine or something like that
07:49
and the bad thing about that is when he
07:51
wrote it he was in rehab at the time
07:53
[Laughter]
07:54
genuinely yeah jj ballard used to have
07:57
scotch as well and that was because it
07:59
said he thought that it changed the
08:00
micro climate of his brain people
08:02
justify it and whatever they need to
08:05
um they've discovered speaking of
08:06
alcohol that alco so a scientists have
08:09
recently discovered with paleogenetics
08:11
which is used as a kind of gene
08:12
sequencing that humans developed the
08:14
capacity to uh digest alcohol
08:17
successfully way before we thought they
08:18
did so we thought they we did in about
08:20
7000 bc and it turns out was about 10
08:22
million years ago and that's when we got
08:24
this gene and that's the reason that
08:26
we've survived so our ability to um
08:28
properly digest alcohol because all the
08:31
fruit that was falling from the trees at
08:32
the time that we needed to eat to
08:33
survive was rotting and fermenting and
08:35
there was a mutation in our ancestors
08:38
jeans which meant that we could eat it
08:39
not die that's like that's like with
08:42
neanderthals and milk
08:43
apparently
08:45
milk is a new thing to us apparently
08:46
we've only been able to that's why i
08:48
always offer people milk because i'm
08:50
like
08:51
neanderthal in disguise
08:52
[Music]
08:54
and when they pass the test i know um
08:56
that's and milk intolerance increases as
09:00
you get closer to the equator
09:01
what yeah yeah britain is the most
09:03
lactose tolerant country in the world
09:05
yeah most lactose tolerant lactose
09:07
tolerance is a mutation and it spreads
09:09
in prevalence as you get towards the
09:10
pulse of the earth because i think isn't
09:13
there something to do about going off i
09:15
mean in hot temperatures that sounds
09:17
stupid but i think it's true so they
09:19
just don't have fridges they're just
09:21
leaving their milk to go off well we
09:22
didn't have fridges until very recently
09:24
yeah sure and they've got them at the
09:26
equator now it's not that hard
09:28
i know but what i'm saying is that
09:30
500 years ago you wouldn't have
09:32
as it wouldn't be as easy to keep milk
09:34
cold and there's less of a reason to
09:36
have the mutation because milk is drunk
09:37
less and there's less um farming pasture
09:41
okay yeah um we need to wrap up on the
09:42
fact does anyone else have anything they
09:44
want to add
09:45
um all i have to add is that ernest
09:48
hemingway he was an alcoholic another
09:50
writer alcoholic and his friend george
09:52
plimpton said that by the time he was
09:54
dying his liver protruded from his belly
09:56
like a long fat leech
09:58
which made me think that if you don't
10:00
have that you're probably okay
10:04
all right let's let's move on to fact
10:05
number two fact number two is from james
10:09
okay my fact this week is that crap
10:12
christmas jumpers date back to the
10:15
romans um what do you mean by that well
10:18
i genuinely don't know actually didn't
10:19
result
10:20
yeah so not christmas because there
10:22
wasn't a christmas there but they did
10:23
have a similar festival um called
10:25
saturnalia and part of it was a festival
10:28
called sigilaria on the 23rd of december
10:32
and there was a writer called marshall
10:34
who wrote about the gifts that you would
10:35
get around that time and he said that
10:38
you would get fish sauce jars of honey
10:40
bottles of wine toothpicks a few other
10:43
things and then one of the things was a
10:45
shaggy nurseling of a weaver on the
10:47
scene a barbarian garment a thing
10:50
uncouth but not to be despised in cold
10:53
december so basically he was saying that
10:56
in that time of year people would get
10:57
really horrible jumpers but they would
10:59
be happy of them because the weather was
11:00
so bad it's a bit more poetic isn't it
11:02
yeah
11:03
ah another shaggy nurse sling of a
11:04
weaver
11:06
guys it's going to be shaggy nurse thing
11:07
of a weaver day on friday so do wear
11:10
your shaggy nurseling of a weaver to the
11:12
office
11:13
make a donation um and also at
11:15
saturnalia aristocrats would wear
11:17
brightly colored fabrics and not
11:18
necessarily matching ones they would
11:20
wear unusual combinations of clothes and
11:22
the outfit was called the synthesis
11:24
which means
11:25
things being put together so i think
11:27
that's the other strand of the christmas
11:29
jumper theory yeah that's right
11:31
that's right this um comes actually from
11:33
a press release from the university of
11:35
reading that i read and they've they've
11:37
gone into all this um they also said
11:39
that people then drank raisin wine wine
11:42
flavored with pitch honeyed wine which
11:44
does sound nice and also a special wine
11:47
for loosening the bowels
11:49
that's who who is accepting that at
11:51
dinner
11:53
can i get the bow loosening
11:56
that's that's what were their toilets
11:57
like it's like would you like red white
11:59
or balloon yeah exactly or brown
12:01
effectively yeah the toilets were okay
12:04
were they yeah we found um we i mean i
12:07
mean the four of us have found a
12:08
perfectly preserved roman toilet seat on
12:10
hadrian's wall oh we haven't but they
12:12
have
12:13
they were okay they were shooting off
12:14
walls
12:16
but they have they had they had latrines
12:18
yeah did they go over the edge of the
12:19
wall because there are barbarians on one
12:21
side of the wall well so it was like an
12:22
attack strategy as well as
12:25
but that's the thing actually about um
12:26
you know what like medieval uh towns
12:29
yeah the idea is that you would throw
12:31
boiling oil on the people attacking you
12:32
but of course they would never do that
12:34
because oil is a really precious thing
12:36
that you you know you need to keep and
12:38
so that what they would throw is urine
12:40
and feces
12:41
okay that's or sometimes boiling water
12:43
but never oil that's one of the best
12:45
ever cartoons from private eye there's a
12:47
castle being attacked and the defenders
12:49
are pouring a huge cauldron of oil over
12:50
the side and there's a guy in chef's
12:52
whites next to them saying drizzle it
12:53
for god's sake drizzle
12:54
[Laughter]
12:57
[Music]
12:58
maybe you were poor boiling oil to show
13:00
how rich you were though in the same way
13:02
that people have you know in the
13:04
elizabethan times they used to blacken
13:06
their teeth didn't they because it
13:07
showed if you had really rotting teeth
13:08
that uh you were eating lots of rich
13:10
food maybe it was that kind of yeah i
13:12
think that was why people did that
13:14
um
13:16
mark of status there's another weird
13:18
style that happened in america uh when
13:20
tv became a massive thing when people
13:22
started owning their own personal tv in
13:24
their houses i got this from a bill
13:25
bryson book there used to be a
13:28
type of clothing called videos this was
13:30
before videos and you would buy your
13:33
video to wear to someone's house to
13:35
watch tv
13:37
and everyone would be wearing the same
13:38
thing because it was such an event to
13:40
watch tv in a house did it look like a
13:43
bit like a black rectangular thing with
13:45
two
13:46
circular dials yeah do you know what the
13:49
patron saint of television is this is
13:50
going because the patron say
13:53
that is um saint claire of assisi who is
13:56
one of the followers of saint francis of
13:58
assisi
13:59
and she was sick in bed and there was
14:02
there was a mass going on in the other
14:03
room and she could somehow see the mass
14:06
happening on the wall
14:07
and that miracle then made her the
14:09
patron saint of um television wow wow
14:12
what did she see
14:14
she saw the mass happening oh that was
14:16
it yeah it's like songs of praise i
14:17
changed the channel yeah come on
14:20
was it a glass wall
14:23
there was another uh saint from assisi
14:25
called saint vitalis of assisi and he is
14:29
the patron saint of genital diseases
14:33
okay
14:34
uh and don't need to tell me mate
14:36
[Laughter]
14:40
there's a patron saying of stds
14:48
he's like a junior minister in the std
14:50
saint department
14:52
obviously as a broader brief as well so
14:54
georgia is the patriot's out of leopards
14:55
yeah yeah anyway sorry um oh yeah so
14:57
saint vitalis was the patron saint of
14:59
stds and um diseases of the genitals uh
15:02
in 2011 there was an auction house in
15:05
ireland that had his head in a jar
15:08
supposedly his head a relic and they
15:10
sold it to a uh an american movie star
15:14
and we don't know which movie star it
15:15
was this is a fun guessing game and a
15:17
fun libel opportunity too
15:20
i say julia roberts
15:22
speaking of heads and christmas
15:24
traditions
15:26
so there's a welsh christmas tradition
15:28
that i'm not going to be able to
15:29
pronounce which i don't think happens as
15:31
much now as it and it happens still in
15:32
glamorgan but nowhere else which is
15:34
called marie lewis which is where a
15:36
group of drunken revelers would put a
15:38
horse's skull on a stick and then they'd
15:40
go around people's houses and bang on
15:42
their doors at christmas and they'd sing
15:43
them a carol and then you had to have a
15:45
sing-off
15:46
with the people in the house and it was
15:48
like a competition and then they had to
15:49
let you in with your horse's skull and
15:51
they had to feed you and then you had to
15:53
sing a goodbye carol and then you would
15:55
leave with your horse's skull and go to
15:56
the next house it just sounds like a
15:58
really weird version of carol singing
15:59
another tradition is uh this is an old
16:02
english tradition cake tossing do you
16:04
know that one no it's not much to it you
16:06
just get a perfectly good cake and throw
16:08
it against a wall
16:09
against the wall yeah not even seeing
16:11
how far you can no no you stand next to
16:13
the wall throw it and it's supposed to
16:14
like give you a year without any hunger
16:16
oh really yeah
16:18
there's another sorry go on what the oh
16:20
just wanted to share this which is the
16:23
theory of when the sweater began because
16:24
it's quite a vague thing you know did it
16:26
begin with the romans what did it been
16:27
before that one website i found says it
16:29
began with 19th century british
16:30
fishermen because they needed something
16:32
chunky and heavy to repel water and keep
16:34
them warm and that is from a website
16:36
called dances with wolves
16:38
nice
16:40
they they would make christmas jumpers
16:42
for penguins didn't they for a while do
16:44
you remember that really yeah there was
16:45
like an oil spill in new zealand yeah do
16:48
you remember and then they what they
16:49
wanted was little jumpers to put on the
16:51
penguins so they wouldn't preen
16:52
themselves and and like get the oil then
16:54
they get the oil in their mouth if they
16:56
print themselves they thought they might
16:57
get about 100 but they ended up getting
16:58
15 000. wow
17:00
and actually they're no good at anyway
17:03
like if you put a sweater on a on a
17:05
penguin it's not really the best thing
17:06
to do best thing to do is just put it in
17:08
cold water or warm water
17:09
i guess that's how they've evolved over
17:11
millions of years to be able to deal
17:14
with cold weather yeah exactly so now
17:16
whenever you send them a
17:18
jumper for a penguin they just put it on
17:20
like a thai penguin and they sell it in
17:22
this shop great thanks
17:25
this is semi-unrelated but they've done
17:27
an experiment in the last few months um
17:29
where they've put lingerie on rats and
17:32
it's to see how
17:34
they always do it to rats and it's to
17:36
see how why men are attracted to women
17:38
but it was you know they put like kind
17:39
of sexy underwear on rats and then they
17:42
got um them to go and have have sex with
17:44
male rats and then if the same woman
17:46
came back later then the guy didn't want
17:47
to have sex with the female without her
17:49
wearing the sexy lingerie so it's like
17:51
as soon as you're programmed to believe
17:52
that the sex is going to be good with
17:54
the lingerie wearing woman then you
17:56
don't enjoy it as much or you don't want
17:58
to do it with the non non-lingerie
17:59
wearing women apparently this proves why
18:01
men are attracted to women that is a
18:02
terrible terrible slogan for a christmas
18:04
jumper
18:07
i write experiments to find that stuff
18:09
out is because we had a fact in the
18:11
previous podcast which was uh
18:13
what was it they were in polyester pants
18:15
yeah
18:16
yeah rats in polyester pants um don't
18:19
what was it they can't get it up they
18:21
can't get the wrong direction if they're
18:22
wearing little trousers
18:25
wow yeah so male rats like no honestly
18:27
you look really beautiful at the
18:28
lingerie i just i don't know what's
18:30
going on down there
18:33
i'll complain to the polyester company
18:35
yeah
18:35
okay uh time for fact number three and
18:37
that is anna
18:39
yeah my fact is that uh male turkeys
18:42
blush when they see female turkeys
18:46
quite sweet yeah
18:48
especially if they're wearing lingerie
18:52
why why do they blush so turkeys
18:54
generally have a weird anatomy anyway
18:56
but um some people think it's because uh
18:59
when turkeys gobble it actually takes up
19:01
a lot of energy and they gobble as part
19:03
of their strutting ritual to attract
19:04
women because it's a sexy thing to do
19:06
and when they gobble it causes the blood
19:08
to rise up and up into their face and
19:10
they turn bright red and they really do
19:11
go bright red but it's only business so
19:13
they're smooth you know the turkey's
19:14
snooze which i find like the weirdest no
19:17
what is it the snoot is that floppy bit
19:19
of skin that dangles really far for
19:21
toki's face and it's a secondary sexual
19:23
organ because um so when a turkey is
19:26
aroused it gets engorged with blood and
19:28
it gets longer and female turkeys fancy
19:31
male turkeys with longer snooze and so
19:33
that snooze goes bright red
19:35
when it's trying to juice
19:37
wait so they have a thing on their face
19:39
that when they're aroused
19:41
it extends yeah and it's got no purpose
19:43
nobody knows why it's there you also
19:45
have a thing on your face that extends
19:46
when you get aroused
19:48
actually but you have erectile tissue
19:50
inside your nose
19:51
oh yes yeah yeah yeah
19:53
does it does it
19:54
increase in size when you are around it
19:56
can do sometimes and there's a thing
19:58
called honeymoon rhinitis which you can
20:00
get um which apparently when you get
20:03
aroused it makes you sneeze and some
20:05
people get uh start sneezing when
20:06
they're aroused well this is a new
20:07
perspective it's the story of pinocchio
20:09
well this is why your nose does get
20:11
longer when you lie doesn't it because
20:12
you get tense and so they say your nose
20:14
does expand
20:16
what else what else people get ten times
20:17
bigger when you're aroused as well 10
20:19
times yeah because it's only smaller
20:21
like
20:22
no hang on
20:24
that small yeah you're right that
20:25
doesn't sound right maybe they're bigger
20:27
under the surface i think you're
20:27
thinking of cartoons when their eyes
20:34
get bigger but now by 10 times obviously
20:35
right okay yeah but so i could be able
20:37
to tell if someone
20:39
i don't know if it's noticeable that
20:40
knows things but then if you're a turkey
20:42
you can't really play it cool with your
20:43
snoot can you
20:44
that's true and if you blush as well
20:47
yeah it's very awkward for them and then
20:48
because they've got uh so the top of
20:50
their head turns bright blue also when
20:52
when they're around or excited um their
20:55
heads
20:57
turn their head blue so it is actually
20:58
quite obvious to a woman when they hang
21:00
on sorry i've what
21:02
so they've got like you know can pick
21:04
what a turkey looks like and they're
21:05
kind of grayish gray yeah they're like a
21:07
turkey head yeah yeah and it goes like
21:09
they go
21:10
they go bright their head goes bright
21:12
blue yeah like my jumper bright blue no
21:15
it's more paler than that oh okay yeah
21:17
this is what so turkeys are great right
21:19
and turkeys were do we think they were
21:20
nearly the official animal uh emblem of
21:23
america or not this is a myth apparently
21:26
but i think it's basically true the idea
21:27
is that benjamin franklin liked them so
21:29
much and he thought they were noble
21:30
animals and he wanted them to be the
21:32
official he did bird of the usa i don't
21:34
i don't know if it's true so when it was
21:36
decided that they were going to make a
21:37
bald eagle the emblem of the usa then um
21:40
franklin was outraged and he said it
21:42
couldn't be a bald eagle because they
21:44
have bad moral character
21:47
he said you may he wrote his daughter
21:49
saying you may have seen them perched in
21:50
some dead tree where too lazy to fish
21:53
for himself he watches the labor of the
21:55
fishing hawk when that diligent bird has
21:57
taken a fish and is bearing it to his
21:58
nest for his young the bald eagle
22:00
pursues him and steals it so he wrote
22:02
that and he said a much more respectable
22:04
bird and a true native of america is the
22:06
turkey so i don't know why people keep
22:08
debunking this franklin wanted the bird
22:09
to be franklin wanted it to be yeah i
22:11
have a thing about electrocuting them
22:12
right yeah he wanted to he what he not
22:15
only wanted to he did electrocute
22:16
turkeys um and on one occasion he got a
22:19
crowd together to watch him doing it and
22:20
then ended up electrocuting himself
22:22
which is amazing um he wrote to a friend
22:25
a turkey is to be killed for our dinners
22:26
by the electrical shock and roasted by
22:28
the electrical jack and he practiced it
22:30
lots and then got a crowd together and
22:32
he just he was numb for the rest of the
22:34
evening after he gave himself a huge
22:35
shock and he wrote to his brother saying
22:37
two nights ago being about to kill a
22:39
turkey by the shock from two large glass
22:40
jars i inadvertently took the hole
22:42
through my own arms and body do not make
22:44
this more public for i am ashamed to
22:46
have been guilty of so notorious a
22:47
blunder so sorry franklin
22:50
your secret's out now
22:54
the other thing though is that turkeys
22:55
aren't that noble are they really i mean
22:58
if you put if you put a male turkey
23:00
apparently in a room with a model of a
23:02
female turkey uh he'll mate with it just
23:05
as eagerly as he would with the real
23:07
thing oh yeah but he will also do it if
23:10
you put a turkey head on a stick he'll
23:12
also try and mate with that really yeah
23:15
yeah and they did an experiment with all
23:17
the different bits of a turkey that
23:19
which will work and which won't work
23:21
a freshly severed head on a stick was
23:23
the most effective that's what it liked
23:24
the most it was the most effective most
23:26
effective well i like you but i don't
23:29
know could you maybe lose everything
23:30
below your neck yeah well yeah you've
23:33
got that one's the most effective
23:34
followed by a dried male head on a stick
23:38
followed by a two-year-old withered
23:39
female head
23:41
on a stick is turkey porn just heads is
23:44
that it's like breasts
23:46
just cut out the body and then last
23:48
place but still eliciting a sexual
23:50
response was a plain balsa wood model
23:54
of the head
23:56
they're randy the snood just got very
23:58
slightly bigger
24:01
wow so that's emblem of the usa turkey's
24:04
never asked are you a leg or a breast
24:06
man they just say are you a head or a
24:07
head i'm a head man yeah i love it
24:11
and when was this done do you know
24:14
it was done in the late 50s by some
24:16
people at the university of pennsylvania
24:18
oh my god perverts in the university
24:21
yeah you know when they say they're
24:22
cutting science budgets around the world
24:25
you're just going but we need to put
24:26
these rats in in braziers and we've got
24:30
trying to find out if he wants to shag
24:31
that head like
24:34
i kind of get it now i've had this had
24:35
decomposing for two years in my office
24:38
we all think it's going to the moon in
24:40
bars and it's there
24:42
this is where the real budget's going
24:45
wow turkeys aren't very breasty now
24:47
aren't they much more than they're
24:48
supposed to be well let's me know
24:50
i have noticed yeah we were chatting
24:51
about this yeah no i thought i saw your
24:54
computer's screens
24:57
they've
24:58
increased was the waitrose website
25:03
look at the head on that one
25:08
go on and turkey's got much bigger
25:10
they've increased by 57 in size since
25:13
1980 i think um because i know since
25:16
1965 sorry um because we're obviously
25:18
breeding them to have huge breasts
25:20
because we like the taste of turkey
25:21
press and this is why so wild turkeys
25:23
are laughing in the face of domestic
25:24
turkeys because they can fly they can
25:26
fly 55 miles an hour i think wow um and
25:29
and most domesticated turkeys can't fly
25:31
at all because they're so top heavy they
25:33
can they can run 25 miles away yeah
25:36
unbelievable wild turkeys yeah wild
25:38
turkeys turkeys can't uh
25:40
farm turkeys can't have sex with each
25:43
other anymore it's quite sad they're
25:44
they're too heavy and they're sort of um
25:47
a bit uh distorted and they have to be
25:49
um
25:50
they have to be masturbated and then
25:52
artificially inseminated
25:53
and the people who is it not because
25:55
they're all dubious now going that's
25:56
it's probably just a head on a stick
25:58
mate
26:00
but the people who do it call it milking
26:02
and it's not milking it's not melting um
26:05
don't dress it up they then they then
26:09
all right they sort of
26:11
can i read you a brief account of it it
26:13
won't take long but the effects will
26:14
last forever in your minds
26:17
so this is according to a journalist who
26:18
went around a visited turkey farmer he
26:20
said i was complaining about the
26:21
impossibility of a journalist getting to
26:23
see the process when i heard a russell
26:24
of feathers beside me the turkey was
26:26
already upside down in paul's hands he
26:28
swiftly uncovered a hole amidst the
26:30
feathers gave it a couple of tweaks and
26:32
there was the turkey semen looking at
26:33
like a bit of crumbly old toothpaste
26:36
we take this said paul and suck it into
26:38
a rubber tube it's then blown into the
26:41
vagina so you have to suck it up with a
26:43
rubber tube
26:44
and then blow it up another turkey
26:47
that's a job
26:48
i hope that this is a job that people
26:50
today
26:51
so what what makes you think you're
26:52
qualified
26:54
well i've always been interested in
26:55
sucking animal semen up through tubes
26:57
i hope they didn't say that
26:59
they didn't say the crumbly old
27:00
toothpaste thing to its face did they
27:02
because that it can be quite massive
27:04
in
27:11
do you have any aqua fresh
27:12
[Laughter]
27:14
hey i read of that turkey poo
27:17
let's say you had two turkeys and you
27:19
were like oh tell me the gender of these
27:21
two turkeys you can tell which one is a
27:23
male and which one is female by their
27:25
poo
27:26
because the poo of a male turkey comes
27:28
out spiral
27:29
like a mr whippy ice cream it comes out
27:31
just like uh but it does that's the kind
27:33
of way that it comes out and then a
27:35
female poo comes out in the shape of a j
27:38
oh yeah so that's that's how you know
27:40
because they have different uh is this
27:42
right james they've got different
27:44
animals
27:44
clark has yeah they have different shape
27:46
clockers another good turkey thing which
27:49
i actually discovered last year and
27:50
isn't our fact book one for one one
27:52
facts to knock you sideways um
27:55
if you want to buy it uh is that so in
27:57
turkey the word for turkey means indian
27:59
bird in indian the word for turkey means
28:01
peruvian bird in greece the word for
28:04
turkey means french bird and in malaysia
28:06
the word for turkey means dutch chicken
28:08
so no one had a clue where it was coming
28:11
from but it was definitely foreign yeah
28:15
there's a foreign bird well there's a
28:16
theory that they were called turkeys
28:18
here because the merchants who sold them
28:21
across europe were turkish yeah but of
28:23
course they're all native to mexico i
28:25
was going to say the native americans
28:27
apparently uh the real origin of the
28:30
name is ferki
28:31
so they should be ferkis not turkeys oh
28:34
okay i didn't know that that's good as
28:35
well start calling them hashtag facts
28:38
um
28:39
we should move on time to move on to our
28:41
final fact of the evening and that is
28:44
andy
28:45
my fact is that the composer of the song
28:47
jingle bells also wrote the yuletide
28:49
classic we conquer or die
28:52
[Laughter]
28:53
that was a genuine song written by the
28:55
same man
28:56
his name was james lord pierpont and uh
28:59
he was an american composer he was also
29:01
the uncle of jp morgan incidentally the
29:03
banker
29:04
and um yeah and he wrote this he wrote
29:07
this song and a number of others the
29:09
lyrics to we conquer or die go uh the
29:12
war drum is beating prepare for the
29:13
fight the stern bigot northman exalts in
29:16
his might gerd on your bright weapons
29:18
your faux men and i and this be our
29:20
watchword we conquer or die
29:22
so jingle them
29:26
you can see where it led on was that
29:28
was that his difficult second song
29:32
which one came first do we know i think
29:34
jingle bells came first some of them we
29:36
don't know the dates for oh no he's like
29:38
someone who wanted to be taken more
29:39
seriously
29:41
did he write anything else is that it
29:42
for me yeah you read a load of songs um
29:44
i have uh are they all in the christmas
29:46
theme or the
29:47
aggressive military theme a lot of them
29:49
are in the aggressive military theme we
29:50
wrote our battle flag and strike for the
29:52
south and oh let me not neglect it die
29:56
because he was
29:58
he was on the side of the south in the
30:00
civil war and he he lived in um boston
30:02
massachusetts originally and then he
30:04
moved down to savannah georgia
30:07
which is where he spent the civil war
30:08
and he wrote a load of these songs um on
30:11
behalf of the south as a kind of
30:12
agitprop thing jingle bells was the
30:14
first one to be played from space wasn't
30:16
it was it
30:17
yeah yeah it was really um it was when
30:21
tom stafford and wally shearer were in
30:23
space it was in 1965 okay i think um and
30:26
it was a prank so they said they'd seen
30:28
a kind of a
30:29
floating asteroid or something they were
30:31
talking to you know mission control or
30:33
whatever on the ground float something
30:35
floating and they were gonna get it and
30:36
see what it was and it turned out to be
30:37
this tiny harmonica it was 3 8 of an
30:40
inch wide and then they launched into a
30:42
rendition of jingle bells around
30:44
christmas time from space they had
30:46
originally planned to play
30:47
we conquer or die they couldn't get the
30:50
rights
30:52
so they pretended that they pretended
30:54
that they saw santa claus is that right
30:56
did you say that no so that's what
30:58
happened they they kind of went down to
31:00
mission control and said we can see this
31:02
this one guy with 12 other figures
31:04
flying into the earth's atmosphere and
31:06
they're pretending that they could see
31:07
father christmas was that what it was
31:09
supposed to be i just saw them saying
31:10
they thought they saw a satellite
31:12
he said i see a command module with
31:14
eight smaller modules in front the pilot
31:17
of the command module is wearing a red
31:19
suit there's a lot of there's a lot of
31:20
uh sort of christmasy elements to space
31:23
travel
31:25
lying and lying from up there that makes
31:27
me wonder about the whole moon landings
31:29
conspiracy theory if they're claiming
31:30
santa claus was there
31:33
uh so some other carols um that saw
31:36
three ships you know that song that's
31:38
our three ships there's an extra verse
31:40
of that that we don't really sing
31:41
anymore which talks about carrying the
31:43
dead bodies of the three wise men on the
31:45
ships how do they die
31:48
let's say natural causes
31:51
and yeah so the idea was that these um
31:53
three wise men were on the boats and
31:55
they'd sailed all the way from bethlehem
31:57
now the problem is that bethlehem isn't
31:59
on the coast um but people in britain
32:01
didn't really know where bethlehem was
32:03
or in europe they didn't know they just
32:04
assumed it was like a seaside resort
32:06
and so the part of the song goes it
32:08
sailed from bethlehem to cologne i think
32:11
it was but how could it do that just
32:15
yeah one on each ship uh let it snow let
32:17
it snow let it snow was written by sami
32:19
khan and jules stein and they claimed
32:22
they came up with the idea to cool
32:23
themselves during a heat wave by writing
32:26
the song
32:27
i don't really see how that works though
32:29
do you like i'm dreaming of a white
32:30
christmas was written i think next to a
32:33
swimming pool in italy i think so yeah
32:35
do people find it so irving berlin wrote
32:37
white christmas didn't he and uh he was
32:39
jewish and he wrote it as sort of an
32:41
ironic song um and
32:43
they recently did a poll in america of
32:46
people's top 25 favorite christmas songs
32:48
and more than half of them are written
32:49
by jewish people and um these are the
32:52
these are the guys who are writing all
32:53
the great christmas trees last year it
32:55
was either last year the year before
32:56
costa coffee did a poll amongst their
32:59
customers of what they think is the
33:01
worst christmas song that's been ever
33:03
been written okay you know what came out
33:04
on top
33:05
oh i don't know it was cliff richards um
33:12
yeah worldwide they've not allowed any
33:15
of their uh their coffee shops to play
33:18
cliffrich's song anymore well irving
33:20
berlin tried to get radio stations to
33:21
ban elvis presley's version of white
33:23
christmas because i thought it was uh i
33:26
think his exact words were it's a
33:27
profane parody of his cherished yuletide
33:30
standard he ordered staff in new york uh
33:33
to uh he's oh he ordered his own staff
33:35
to phone radio stations and say don't
33:37
play this because he thought it was so
33:38
outrageously gross
33:41
why was it gross was there too much i
33:43
think i'm just a little bit too sexy i
33:45
don't know elvis presley a lot of radio
33:46
stations uh refused to play elvis
33:48
presley's songs when he first became
33:50
popular because they assumed that he was
33:52
black and it was that the time when uh
33:55
yeah well they also banned him um i
33:57
don't know if this is a myth but and it
33:59
might be a myth is it a myth no i think
34:00
it's not a myth they could only film him
34:03
um
34:04
sort of torso above they couldn't show
34:06
his legs because his legs were too sexy
34:08
in the dance moves yeah he was just
34:09
shaking too much mostly his hips yeah
34:11
mostly his hair their legs are not the
34:13
problem is yeah he's got to cut out that
34:14
like however
34:15
yeah you can you can do below the knees
34:17
guys or you can do above the waist yeah
34:19
whereas on on turkey top of the pops
34:21
they cut off the head
34:24
to see the body that's all you get
34:26
um rudolph the redness reindeer was
34:28
nearly called reginald
34:31
reginald
34:32
yeah it doesn't scan as well but it
34:34
wasn't it wasn't the song originally it
34:35
was a it was a coloring book for
34:36
children and an advertising guy came up
34:38
with it and um he very nearly called it
34:40
reginald but then he crucially didn't
34:41
and it sold two and a half million
34:43
copies in its first year this little
34:44
coloring book and which is quite nice
34:47
about rudolph the red knows reindeer it
34:48
was written by just a copywriter who
34:50
worked for a montgomery award huge
34:52
department store and they'd just been
34:54
told they didn't want to spend those
34:55
money buying christmas gifts to sell so
34:57
they told their staff to write a
34:59
christmas song
35:00
so this guy robert may wrote rudolph the
35:02
red nosed reindeer and um it sold
35:05
incredibly well made loads of money um i
35:08
think you know it was remade into a song
35:09
and the montgomery ward people in charge
35:12
of montgomery award gave him all the
35:13
rights to it he had no rights to it at
35:15
all and he was in trouble his wife had a
35:17
terminal illness um he was in massive
35:19
debt and as soon as it was released as a
35:21
song they sold him all the rights to 100
35:23
and he lived off the proceeds of that
35:25
until i think 1970s when he died so
35:27
that's quite nice that is nice that's
35:29
great yeah um hark the herald angels
35:31
sing the tune is written by mendelssohn
35:34
which possibly you know and meddleson
35:35
originally wrote the tune as a tribute
35:37
to the gutenberg's
35:39
gutenberg's printing press
35:41
it was uh how awesome is the printing
35:43
press song which is how awesome is the
35:45
printing press scans the same as hawker
35:47
herald age you'll see that yes they
35:48
originally actually went gutenberg the
35:50
deutsche man zunda di fickle anne what
35:53
do facultan i have no idea
35:57
so the weirdest thing for me about this
35:59
fact is when you hear someone who's
36:01
famous for something and then they've
36:03
produced another bit of work that is
36:04
just so
36:06
you know jingle bells we conquer or die
36:08
it's just so different to like it's like
36:10
when i when i found out that barbara
36:12
cartland invented a glider
36:14
that the military started using sorry
36:16
what barbara cartland the romance
36:19
novelist who wrote a billion romance
36:21
novels also invented a glider that you
36:23
could fly in that the military was like
36:25
that is so good we're using it
36:28
and that's one of her and
36:30
yeah that's that's a thing that and and
36:32
michael jackson
36:34
invented um
36:36
invented the fax machine and
36:39
no michael jackson i this actually i
36:41
don't know if most people know this but
36:43
he he wrote the song do the bart man the
36:45
michael jackson's the oh everyone does
36:47
know that but he he wrote the simpsons
36:48
song do the bar really and he invented
36:50
those shoes that let you kind of stand
36:52
on a slant as well yeah he did actually
36:54
he was a part of the that when he slants
36:56
forward there's a patent taken out where
36:58
it's weighted boots and he was he was
37:00
one of them
37:01
act like this is the kind of shoe that's
37:02
really caught on since then
37:04
what are you doing we're all wearing
37:06
them we're all wearing them now so
37:07
everyone walks over like that
37:09
this is connected because i wanted to
37:10
mention this earlier the person who made
37:12
christmas carols cool again was saint
37:15
francis of assisi also i believe uh yes
37:18
so it was at a time when it was in the
37:20
13th century at a time when it was all
37:22
like uh very serious and very somber and
37:26
he tried to make christmas celebrations
37:28
fun again and he uh
37:32
made it so that for instance drinking
37:33
songs that were sung in taverns like fun
37:35
drinking songs he he made them be
37:37
rewritten with chris christmas lyrics
37:42
um a few years ago the pope said that he
37:44
was a play by francis of assisi what do
37:46
you mean well he started off his life he
37:48
was a drinker and he was a partier and
37:49
then he gave away all his stuff to a
37:51
leper and the pope actually said that he
37:52
was one of the original playboys fun guy
37:55
crazy nativity i think he turned
37:56
nativity into a fun theatrical event so
37:58
decided that the birth of jesus should
38:00
be something that we all go and enjoy
38:01
watching you know the vatican didn't
38:03
have a christmas tree until 1982.
38:06
no
38:07
i think they associated it still with
38:08
being the old heathen thing wow yeah
38:11
there's a thing in america where you
38:12
call them holiday trees i've just read
38:14
this really random report where there
38:17
was a guy who he was a politician who
38:19
died he had a previous career i can't
38:21
quite remember what his previous career
38:22
was and when he died apparently it was
38:24
just such a big thing in his life that
38:26
he hated the idea that things were
38:27
called holiday trees and he wanted to be
38:29
called christmas trees that when arnold
38:31
schwarzenegger spoke at his funeral
38:34
he said i swear
38:36
i will make the christmas tree return it
38:38
was the report that came out arnold
38:40
schwarzenegger promises christmas trees
38:42
to return in funeral eulogy
38:47
um we need to wrap up
38:48
you guys how many more yeah jingle bells
38:50
was originally a bit of a saucy song
38:52
i just wanted to tell you that um the
38:54
second verse um it goes a day or two ago
38:57
i thought i'd take a ride and soon miss
38:59
fanny bright was seated by my side the
39:01
horse was lean and lank misfortune
39:03
seemed his lot he got into a drifted
39:05
bank and then we got upsot
39:08
which
39:09
no one knows what it means
39:12
but
39:13
it sounds like it should be upset but it
39:15
didn't quite right
39:17
i think that's exactly what it means
39:18
actually
39:19
yeah and then like now the ground is
39:21
white go it while you're young take the
39:23
girls tonight and sing this slaying song
39:24
basically a sleigh was like having a
39:26
sweet ride in the 50s and you'd go and
39:29
slay everywhere and you know you'd go up
39:31
into the hills up to going to sleep
39:33
everywhere sounds a bit like some kind
39:34
of gory uh yeah something that you don't
39:36
want to be involved with but you go
39:37
playroom and you'd you know that was
39:39
that was very impressive to a young lady
39:40
you've got a sleigh four
39:42
i have a oh just one more thing to add
39:44
yes which is more of a like a feminist
39:46
mission statement about the holly and
39:48
the ivy and the whole in the ivy the
39:51
song and so it's always kind of bugged
39:53
me how you know how that ends saying of
39:55
all the trees that are in there with the
39:56
holy bears the crown so in the hole in
39:57
the ivy the holly's one and holly is a
39:59
bit of a dick because it's all spiky and
40:01
nasty um and actually this dates back to
40:04
medieval times when the holly
40:06
represented the masculinity of the male
40:08
form and the ivy was a woman ivy was
40:10
this weak gentle woman and the holly was
40:11
this strong and it's very resilient and
40:13
it represented a man and in medieval
40:15
villages they would sing the women would
40:16
sing have competitions against the men
40:19
and they would be the ivy and the men
40:20
would be the holly so every time women
40:23
you sing the holly and the ivy and you
40:24
finish saying the holy bear's the crown
40:26
you're saying the men have won
40:29
that's that's what that means we need to
40:30
change it don't we we need to change it
40:32
get arnold schwarzenegger on the phone
40:34
[Laughter]
40:37
i swear to you anna
40:40
the ivy will rise again
40:45

00:28
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:31
no such thing as official weekly podcast
00:33
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:35
covent garden
00:36
my name is dan triber i'm sitting with
00:37
the three regular elves it's andy murray
00:39
james harkin
00:40
and anna chazinski and once again we
00:42
have gathered around the microphones
00:43
with our four favorite facts from the
00:45
last seven days
00:46
and in no particular order here we go
00:50
starting with you jacinsky my fact this
00:53
week is that
00:54
franz kafka once convinced his entire
00:56
family that einstein's theory of
00:58
relativity was going to cure his
01:00
tuberculosis
01:01
right how is that gonna work uh it's a
01:04
good question i can't exactly tell you
01:06
but i can tell you how it was claimed
01:08
it was gonna work i'm not sure i
01:09
understand it but essentially the plan
01:11
was that you would take a cruise
01:13
according to this spoof article that he
01:15
sent to his family you take a cruise
01:17
heading east
01:18
in the direction of the earth's rotation
01:20
and this would enlarge your body
01:23
and that would close the cavities in
01:25
your lungs that were causing these
01:26
problems
01:28
and by enlarging your body and gaining
01:29
weight by taking this easterly cruise
01:32
then you'd be cured and he actually said
01:34
that there was a company
01:35
in prague that was fitting out hospital
01:37
ships specifically for this purpose
01:40
unfortunately i think the holes would
01:41
get bigger as well that that was one of
01:43
the many flaws
01:45
in the claim like is it in superman
01:47
where he flies
01:48
around the world and slows down the
01:49
rotation no he turns it
01:51
backwards he spins the world backwards
01:54
which reverses time yeah
01:55
which stops uh his from lois lane from
01:58
dying
02:00
i don't think that would work either
02:01
wouldn't it also turn back the thing he
02:03
had just saved because he saves the
02:04
world first and then he has to turn the
02:06
earth backwards to save the girl
02:07
but it would also undo his own
02:10
saving of the world in the first one so
02:12
he'd be in exactly the same well is that
02:13
similar to the fact that
02:14
science i've wondered if when you sail
02:16
back westward is that gonna
02:18
i mean is your tv gonna return do you
02:20
then have to stay in china does everyone
02:22
with tb have to end up in china
02:24
i think if you keep traveling east
02:25
you're all right okay you have to keep
02:27
going forever and ever
02:28
do we know their reaction the family's
02:29
reaction when yeah they was a joke
02:32
they were really devastated yeah that's
02:34
not usually how good jokes endearing
02:36
that's how good brother jokes always end
02:39
someone being very upset
02:40
joke fail but kafka was amazing wasn't
02:42
it kafka is the most hilarious character
02:44
um
02:44
he wrote letters obsessively all the
02:46
time which is great so we've got this
02:48
and i think as most people know he
02:50
hardly had anything published in his
02:51
life i think he published four hundred
02:53
and fifty pages of work in his life and
02:55
on his own
02:56
wasn't it yeah a few stories the trial
02:59
wasn't and then on his death he said to
03:01
his publisher
03:02
wrote him that famous letter saying make
03:04
sure you burn everything i've written
03:06
and obviously instead of doing that um
03:08
it was all published yeah so
03:10
his um publisher was called max broad
03:12
yeah and max broad um
03:14
kept all of his papers and then was in a
03:16
really weird sort of menage a trois
03:18
relationship with a woman called esther
03:20
hoffa
03:21
and her husband otto and when he died he
03:25
gave
03:25
all of his all of kafka's papers to to
03:28
esther hoffa who then gave them to her
03:31
daughter
03:31
and her daughter now lives in an
03:33
apartment full of cats
03:35
with all of kafka's papers in the corner
03:38
and
03:38
basically they seem they think they're
03:40
all going to just get demolished by cat
03:42
people wow and we'll never be able to
03:43
read them so
03:44
everyone wants to get these um kafka
03:46
papers so that we can read these amazing
03:48
stories
03:48
and she's like no they're mine and my
03:50
cats are going to pee on them and
03:52
is that why because i think the british
03:54
library or the or maybe the bodily
03:55
is keeps claiming that they actually
03:57
have the right to them and there's some
03:59
ambiguity in what kafka said what broad
04:01
said they should get them
04:02
yeah and everyone also keeps trying to
04:03
get rid of the cats and so they keep
04:05
going in the council and saying no we're
04:07
going to take these cats and every time
04:08
they take like 20 cats away another 20
04:10
arrive
04:11
they just keep coming
04:18
so the whole burning all of your work
04:21
post your death
04:22
why i think because so it's actually
04:24
estimated that he burned 90
04:26
of what he wrote during his life kafka
04:28
so we only have 10 of what he wrote but
04:29
he was a real perfectionist and he hated
04:31
himself he was really self-loathing so i
04:32
think he thought that nothing that he
04:33
ever wrote was good enough
04:34
yeah and um i mean i guess maybe some of
04:36
it's quite revealing like he wrote this
04:38
letter to his father he went on holiday
04:40
for two weeks intending to write and he
04:42
ended up spending the entire two weeks
04:43
writing a letter to his father this
04:45
incredibly long letter
04:46
about everything his father had done
04:47
wrong and it was all his father sounds
04:48
like a terrible person so um
04:50
it was accusing him of say of doing
04:52
stuff like his father would say no one's
04:54
allowed to speak at the table the table
04:55
is for eating but his father would
04:57
incessantly speak at the table
04:58
no one's allowed to swear but his father
05:00
had the foul this mouth of anyone he
05:01
knew
05:02
he was terrified of his father and he
05:04
wrote him they spent two weeks writing
05:05
this letter that he never sent him
05:07
um another letter that he wrote that i
05:09
quite like is he wrote a
05:11
16-page letter asking for a promotion
05:14
when he worked at the
05:15
workers accident and insurance company
05:18
the thing about his father in the dinner
05:20
table um kafka liked to
05:23
um have the diet called fletcherism yeah
05:25
that one so that's where you just
05:26
keep chewing every mouthful a hundred
05:29
times yeah until it goes
05:31
yeah until until basically there's
05:32
nothing left in your mouth and it all
05:34
turns into motion
05:35
what's the point of doing that by having
05:36
larger things in your body it makes you
05:38
put on more weight whereas if you chew
05:39
it all it makes
05:40
it go through yeah because it'll be more
05:42
broken down won't it by your saliva
05:44
yeah so they used to for instance they
05:46
used to have dinner parties like
05:47
fletcher's and dinner parties where
05:49
they would have a timer so everyone
05:51
would have a mouthful and they would
05:52
have like a one minute timer and
05:54
everyone would
05:55
choo choo choo and then they'd be like
05:56
ding okay next mouthful and then you'd
05:58
do that
05:59
wow come to parties 7 p.m on the 4th
06:02
carriages 9 p.m
06:03
on the 12th fletcher was really cool
06:06
actually um
06:07
he said he thought that by doing his
06:09
particular style of
06:11
um diet that you would only defecate
06:13
once every two weeks
06:15
and he said that it would smell like
06:16
warm biscuits
06:19
and also apparently he carried around a
06:21
sample of his own feces around to
06:23
illustrate the wonder
06:24
wow that's true hopefully he didn't
06:27
carry it in a biscuit
06:30
he also got really into muller's he was
06:32
into fads because he was really
06:33
self-conscious about his weight
06:35
um he was afraid of his own reflection
06:37
because he thought he hated the fact
06:38
that he was so ugly but he actually
06:39
wasn't
06:40
um but he got really into muller's
06:42
exercise fad which was
06:43
i think probably the first real big
06:46
exercise fad this guy called muller
06:48
telling you the exercise you should do
06:50
every day
06:50
like naked that was the naked exercising
06:52
so he always appeared in a loin cloth
06:54
and
06:54
said people should just wear this little
06:56
and he would go skiing in samara it's in
06:57
a loincloth and stuff and people were a
06:59
bit skeptical about how beneficial this
07:00
was to anyone's health
07:02
um but he got right he was devoted to
07:04
that that's fantastic
07:06
yeah i was looking into sort of just
07:09
famous authors and their quirky ways of
07:11
writing you know so kafka obviously just
07:12
going for massively long loaders it's
07:14
really enjoyable to find out that
07:15
everyone doesn't find writing as easy as
07:17
you assume that they did
07:19
some of the biggest authors so um uh
07:21
victor hugo
07:22
he was so bad at writing and
07:24
concentrating and needing to be in the
07:26
you know you always have that oh i need
07:27
to get out of the room and do something
07:28
more important he used to lock away
07:30
all of his clothes to avoid temptation
07:33
of going outside
07:34
oh wow yes he often had a chauffeur who
07:37
would give the clothes to say
07:38
no account give me these clothes until
07:40
i've done my work
07:41
and uh and then he did he did eventually
07:44
start wearing a shawl i think people
07:45
would walk in and be like
07:47
was there a greek writer who shaved half
07:50
of his head
07:51
and the idea was that he would be too
07:53
embarrassed to go out in public and so
07:55
he would stay in and write
07:56
i can't remember who that was wow these
07:59
are all
08:00
universally bad ideas yeah the
08:02
interesting thing for these great
08:03
writers if you can't resist the
08:04
temptation you end up wandering the
08:05
streets stark naked with half a head of
08:07
hair and you're in an asylum but the
08:09
half the hair
08:09
head of hair is okay because if you were
08:11
desperate enough you could just make
08:12
sure that you were facing one direction
08:14
wherever you went as long as you kept
08:16
that spot no one would know
08:18
um on just on writing practices yeah i
08:20
didn't know this about t.s eliot who
08:22
similarly to um kafka left in he didn't
08:24
want his life written by anyone he left
08:26
instructions there should be no official
08:27
biography of him
08:28
and i think peter ackroyd's just written
08:30
one but he basically wasn't allowed
08:32
access to
08:33
any of t.s eliot's private letters or
08:35
any of his life so it's quite
08:37
difficult yeah i think he just made it
08:39
all up so maybe this is made up but no
08:40
t.s eliot used to
08:42
put very pale green makeup on his face
08:45
and nobody knows why he wore very pale
08:47
green makeup people have speculated it
08:49
was to look like a corpse although i
08:50
don't know
08:51
why i'd want to do that maybe it's just
08:52
a fashion thing yes elliot
08:54
who's he the green face guy maybe oh
08:56
yeah he was just
08:57
always insanely jealous maybe it was
09:00
that
09:00
oh yeah just constantly what are his
09:02
poems like i haven't read it are they
09:04
just like
09:05
she's with him again
09:08
did you see the green cat in bulgaria
09:10
this week who's in the news
09:11
no yeah there's a green cat in bulgaria
09:13
it's like bright green and everyone's
09:15
like
09:15
how on earth could it be a bright green
09:17
cat is it like some kind of
09:19
science experiment gone wrong or
09:20
something but apparently it like
09:22
sleeping in a tub of green paint
09:24
[Laughter]
09:27
right how long did it take them to work
09:29
that out yeah okay
09:30
victor hugo yeah i think this is right
09:33
kept a detail an extremely detailed
09:35
diary of all the women he slept with
09:37
did he yeah but it was it was extremely
09:39
detailed it was like a spreadsheet with
09:41
lots of different columns and lots of
09:42
different
09:42
that's kind of a woman's worst nightmare
09:44
that's like the um
09:46
the uh curator at the natural history
09:48
museum he does that doesn't he
09:50
no did we speak did we talk about this
09:52
on the podcast he used to collect
09:53
um after every sexual conquest a single
09:57
hair of pubic hair yeah after he after
10:00
you
10:00
sorry we should specify this is not the
10:02
current curator
10:04
you just said the curator i just want to
10:06
avoid any potential i don't know
10:08
the one that we've spoken about before
10:10
he was a curator i can't remember his
10:11
name he used to collect
10:13
um uh just one one sprig i seem to
10:16
remember
10:16
sprig of pubic hair being the word used
10:20
uh and he would file them uh in color
10:23
a date and he did a proper curator's job
10:25
on it so they were going through all his
10:26
his files after he died and they came
10:28
across this
10:30
kind of collection can you visit that at
10:32
the natural history it's not on display
10:33
at the moment
10:34
it's a real shame it should be though
10:35
yeah it should it's very distressing
10:38
um other writers in their their weird
10:40
writing habits
10:41
um there was a writer who's huge
10:42
american novelist at the uh sort of
10:45
night early 1900s thomas clayton wolf
10:47
who always used to write
10:48
on a refrigerator because he was so tall
10:51
which just seems like he's rubbing in
10:52
people's faces little magnet letters
10:54
yeah took him a long time to get a novel
10:56
out there
10:58
imagine sending it to the publishers as
10:59
well there are 300 fridges outside
11:04
kids rearranging it
11:08
this novel just seems to say bum bum
11:13
uh just going back to kafka if we can
11:15
yes um so
11:16
there was a um a biography of kafka
11:18
written a couple of years ago by a guy
11:19
called james hawes
11:21
and he caused controversy because he
11:22
wanted to talk about
11:24
the pornography that kafka had uh and
11:27
apparently
11:28
he was saying that kafka was into
11:29
hardcore porn including images of
11:32
hedgehog style creatures performing
11:34
fellatio
11:35
hedgehog style creatures yeah so like
11:37
creatures that look a bit like a
11:38
hedgehog but like porcupines maybe we
11:40
don't know
11:41
okay we'll just say porcupine i think
11:43
they're like half human half hedgehog
11:45
things
11:46
so he was a furry isn't that what a
11:48
furry is yeah
11:49
kind of i'm not sure he dressed up as
11:51
them okay but then the
11:52
um the german scholars then said well
11:56
this is obviously rubbish um
11:58
this um author in britain is just a
12:00
prude
12:01
and these um hedgehog kind of things are
12:03
just not pornography at all they're just
12:05
high art
12:06
oh yeah and he said that comparing those
12:09
illustrations
12:10
to hardcore pawn is like comparing a
12:11
poem by henrik heiner
12:13
with an advertising slogan for
12:15
mcdonald's so basically
12:17
this isn't hardcore you should see our
12:18
hardcore yeah
12:20
come into the back room i'll show you
12:22
something yeah since we're on the
12:24
subject um
12:25
i was reading a book about uh the
12:27
history of london and sort of london and
12:28
vice basically and it had titles for
12:31
uh 19th century pornography which were
12:34
quite something so the spreeish spouter
12:37
or flash cove's slap up reciter
12:40
and that is a good title you know um the
12:42
jolly companion and
12:43
the story of a dildo
12:45
[Laughter]
12:47
it sounds like it could almost be a
12:49
girl's name you'd see it on the shelf
12:51
you think ah
12:51
the little the maiden a dildo well it
12:53
might have been the story of a dil as in
12:55
the story of alan dildo
12:57
yeah exactly so i um i spoke about on a
13:00
previous podcast
13:01
uh just on on this subject um about
13:03
monster erotica
13:04
um you guys remember so it's it's an
13:08
amazing i
13:09
spent the weekend looking more into it
13:10
i've downloaded a number
13:12
and but the interesting thing was
13:14
they're all on kid though you could get
13:16
them
13:16
um there's this whole world of monster
13:18
erotica and you would figure that who
13:20
who the hell's reading this no one's
13:22
reading
13:22
is reading it that's who he was reading
13:25
um
13:25
it turns out some of the authors are
13:27
making up to thirty thousand dollars a
13:29
month
13:29
if this is an advert in a sidebar saying
13:31
how i earn thirty thousand dollars a
13:32
month working
13:37
clearly the whole 30 000 is coming out
13:39
of dan's bank account
13:42
um kafka used to laugh uncontrollably at
13:44
his own jokes which is weird
13:48
indeed another thing which i think he
13:49
would have found funny because he had a
13:50
really morbid sense of humor hence the
13:52
um a spoof letter to his family
13:54
convincing them he wasn't going to die
13:56
which i don't know if i mentioned this
13:57
but he did die of tb
13:58
quite young um shortly after sending
14:00
them that spoof
14:01
article um was that while he was writing
14:04
the hunger artist which was a story
14:06
about starvation he was writing that as
14:08
he was dying of tb
14:09
and during the writing of that about
14:10
someone who can't eat his throat closed
14:12
up and he's not being able to eat
14:13
anything
14:14
so it's sort of like his body was trying
14:16
to give him the visceral experience of
14:17
what he was writing about
14:18
well i used my first job was
14:21
interviewing um
14:22
women with acid reflux
14:26
for a market research company and after
14:28
four days of doing that my boss and i
14:30
both doing the same interviews we both
14:31
got the symptoms of acid reflux on the
14:33
same night
14:33
coincidences one more thing about
14:36
letters
14:37
um gordon brown apparently like to write
14:40
letters to people in the x factor
14:44
and he he wrote basically for a few
14:47
years well i think it was while he's
14:48
prime minister he would write to people
14:50
and say oh
14:50
i thought you were very good or i
14:52
thought remember this yeah yeah he wrote
14:54
to one guy daniel evans a 38 year old
14:56
swimming pool cleaner
14:58
and said on a personal note can i say
15:00
that the next time simon says you are
15:02
only supported by the over 60s
15:04
you can tell him i disagree he was 57
15:07
and he wrote that
15:09
thing's gotten really helping my case
15:10
yeah was he really big like a massive
15:12
fan apparently
15:13
no it sounds like some kind of sad
15:15
political stunt that his peers stupid pr
15:17
advisers told him to do along with
15:18
smiling like a maniac in order to
15:20
ingratiate himself with people
15:22
doesn't it yeah i'd like to think it was
15:24
real oh i've got one more thing about
15:26
the writing process
15:27
yeah okay so uh there's a an inventor
15:30
who james it turns out has met
15:33
uh called doctor yoshiro nakumatsu
15:36
yeah which is that him yep so you've met
15:38
him he okay so he's responsible
15:40
for 3 300 inventions according to him
15:43
claims to be the most prolific inventor
15:44
of all time yeah
15:46
he patented the floppy disk uh he
15:49
had many of his greatest ideas uh when
15:51
he was close to drowning
15:55
and when you say many it means yeah
15:57
obviously this is a guy's
15:59
shouldn't be in a pool and so basically
16:03
he
16:03
uh he also invented scuba apparatus yeah
16:06
armbands so he realized that uh in order
16:10
to have good ideas or at least what
16:11
works for him is that he needs to be
16:14
at the bottom of a pool simulating the
16:16
idea that he's about to drown
16:18
and he had developed a one of his
16:19
inventions an underwater notepad
16:22
so he'd start jotting ideas down as he
16:25
was on the brink of death and then swim
16:26
back to the surface and come out and go
16:28
flop me disc
16:31
[Applause]
16:32
okay time for the fact number two and
16:35
that is andrew hunter murray
16:37
my fact this week is that dead geckos
16:39
still stick to walls
16:41
it's just pleasing isn't it just a nice
16:43
fact um
16:44
and this was tested by a team of
16:46
scientists who stuck a gecko
16:47
they didn't stick a gecko on all they
16:49
just let it climb up one and then killed
16:50
it and killed it
16:52
did they really yeah that's how they did
16:53
it yeah it was um it was induced death
16:55
rather than waiting for the gecko to die
16:57
of natural causes which
16:58
would to be fair have slowed the
17:00
experiment down a great deal
17:02
um so it's it's really interesting how
17:04
come you don't see loads of dead geckos
17:06
on the walls
17:07
all the time and they're not filling up
17:08
all the walls you do every
17:10
blizzard wallpaper you see that's
17:12
actually real
17:13
lizard wallpapers that yeah yeah you
17:15
know yeah very fashionable um
17:17
well it lasts not forever it lasts until
17:20
a while after they die at least half an
17:21
hour after they die they can still be
17:23
there
17:23
good question you know how we've been
17:25
because andre geim
17:26
uh who is a professor he um
17:30
he came up with uh the nobel prize
17:32
winner yeah nobel prize winner for
17:33
graphene
17:34
uh going to change the world he does
17:36
these friday night experiments
17:38
one of the things that he's invented in
17:39
which he's trying to make better
17:41
is a glove which acts like a gecko it's
17:44
called um
17:45
gecko tape i believe you can climb up a
17:47
wall the only issue that they have with
17:49
it is that unlike a gecko it kind of
17:51
the the little hairs which is what they
17:53
are using so spider hairs and gecko
17:55
hairs that's the kind of technology that
17:56
they're trying to harness
17:58
uh it clogs up and so you start slipping
18:00
and you start going down
18:01
my question is get a big enough gecko
18:04
why can't you create a glove
18:05
where live gecko is on the actual end of
18:08
the glove and you climb a wall
18:10
with four geckos with four geckos
18:12
attached to your hands and your feet
18:13
there's no reason there's no reason at
18:14
all has anyone tried
18:16
yeah there are ethical reasons
18:18
definitely oh hang on they're they're
18:19
making them climb walls and killing them
18:21
while we don't know we're already
18:22
in jupiter's territory for scientific
18:25
purposes not spider-man purposes
18:27
this would help this would be from
18:28
military all right we should say
18:30
how they can do it in the first place so
18:32
um it's very
18:33
very clever every square millimeter of a
18:35
gecko's foot contains 14 000
18:37
little hair-like structures um and as
18:40
they
18:40
climb up the wall they basically push
18:43
these into contact with the wall
18:44
and they use something called the van
18:46
der waals force yeah which is so cool
18:48
it basically disrupts the balance of
18:50
electrons and protons in
18:51
atoms so the hair as it's pushed towards
18:54
the wall
18:55
it pushes all the electrons of the first
18:57
atom of the wall to one end
18:59
right so it pushes them to the other end
19:01
so that atom is next to the one next to
19:03
it
19:03
and it repels all the electrons to the
19:05
other one because
19:06
like forces repel that means that you've
19:09
got
19:10
an atom uh with all electrons at one end
19:13
and an atom with all protons at one end
19:14
and they then
19:15
are attracted to each other and stick
19:17
together yeah that
19:18
in microcosm is how the gecko climbs up
19:21
walls wow and they can support 20 times
19:22
their own weight i think they inspire
19:25
they've inspired a kind of super glue
19:26
the way it works um
19:28
they've designed super glue based on
19:29
that yeah there's another there is a
19:32
type of super glue that's based on that
19:34
and the thing that muscles use so
19:36
muscles will attach to rocks using a
19:38
kind of
19:39
um like cement and they've mixed that
19:42
kind of cement technology with the van
19:44
de val's
19:45
technology of the geckos and they've got
19:47
a new adhesive called
19:48
um it's called gekko or something like
19:50
that which is like supposed to be a
19:52
super duper amazing
19:53
yeah but also works underwater so it
19:55
could be used for
19:56
you know like um elastoplasts that won't
19:59
go
19:59
fall off in the bath and stuff like that
20:01
that would be very handy that would be
20:03
really useful i can't believe they
20:04
haven't got on that yet but i don't
20:05
think
20:06
the elastic blast industry would allow
20:07
it no they make their money from people
20:09
constantly losing them in the bathroom
20:11
it's like a conspiracy theory yeah
20:13
you're going up against big plaster
20:14
there
20:16
i wonder if there's a technology that
20:18
we've not yet harnessed in
20:20
the you know when you uh lick uh icicle
20:23
yeah sticks to it yeah i mean that's a
20:25
very good sticky
20:27
little thing that we haven't really
20:28
harnessed do you think it's like 20
20:30
times your own weight do you think you
20:31
could hang i'll have to wait
20:32
have you seen dumb and dumber when
20:33
they're trying i have yeah but i don't
20:35
know if that they did a lot of
20:36
scientific research there's about five
20:37
people trying to pull
20:38
jeff daniel's tongue off that okay look
20:41
it's really cold outside today
20:43
yeah that wall is very cold put your
20:45
tongue in it
20:46
we'll kill
20:53
do you guys remember that woman earlier
20:55
on this year who claimed that she'd
20:56
given birth to a gecko oh yes
20:58
in indonesia um and her and her midwife
21:01
uh both reported it she thought she was
21:03
gonna give birth to a child and when it
21:05
came out
21:05
turned out that uh it was a lizard
21:07
coated in mucus and blood apparently
21:09
slithered out of the birth canal and i
21:11
don't know a
21:12
why the midwife had to help with that it
21:14
seemed because it was quite easy
21:17
oh yeah of course those downed adhesive
21:20
feet
21:21
um but then they became the target of
21:23
this witch hunt in indonesia because she
21:25
was accused of witchcraft
21:27
so why would you make that hoax why
21:29
would you pretend you'd give them birth
21:30
to a lizard
21:31
it must be like the kafka joke she
21:32
thought this is going to go down a treat
21:34
and then
21:35
it got revealed actually they're kind of
21:37
backfired
21:38
wow geckos lick their own eyes to keep
21:41
them they don't
21:41
they can't blink yeah so they just go
21:43
around licking their own eyes oh yeah
21:45
isn't it that they don't have eyelids
21:47
they've got a sort of clear film over
21:49
their eyes
21:49
but they don't have movable eyelids i
21:52
believe
21:53
is that right you have three eyelids
21:55
done i've always thought you looked a
21:56
bit weird
21:57
what do you mean three eyelids on each
21:58
eye do i so the one that goes down yeah
22:00
one goes up
22:01
and you have another little one there's
22:03
a little kind of flap of
22:05
pink in the corner of your eye and that
22:07
use is what used to be your third eyelid
22:09
and now it's only a little tiny flat
22:11
that's very coincidental because geckos
22:13
have three eyes do they
22:14
they have a third eye which is a little
22:16
light sensing a pineal one
22:18
yeah um trying to think of how to
22:20
describe it really what does pineal mean
22:22
okay so basically
22:23
it is um it's they are cells which will
22:27
um they will sense light um and their
22:30
outgrowths are the pineal gland which is
22:32
in the top of your head
22:34
and i think the idea is that they can
22:36
then sense the change in light above
22:38
them so if any kind of predators come
22:40
from above
22:40
then they'll be able to sense them i
22:42
think that's right yeah
22:44
and they've done tests on people where
22:46
and i don't think this is a pineal thing
22:47
but where completely blind people
22:49
can tell whether a light is on or not
22:52
people who
22:52
hear someone click the switch there's a
22:55
type of gecko called the moorish gecko
22:58
and they
22:59
change they are delicious
23:02
they change color um if you put them on
23:05
a surface but unlike a chameleon they
23:06
change colour to be the same colour as
23:08
the cell
23:08
they genuinely camouflage themselves
23:10
yeah exactly and these
23:12
geckos say you put them on a yellow
23:14
surface they'll turn yellow
23:16
but if you blindfold them they'll still
23:18
turn yellow
23:19
because it's not their eyes that are
23:21
getting white it's
23:23
some kind of light sensors in their skin
23:24
that are doing it
23:26
amazing so if you put the blindfold
23:28
around those kind of stomachs
23:30
then they won't be able to see it and
23:31
they won't be able to change that's not
23:32
a blindfold though is it it's a
23:34
stomach can they do patterns
23:38
i can put them on a picture of marilyn
23:40
monroe and have like
23:41
that appear on a gecko very sexy you're
23:44
fulfilling a long-standing fantasy of
23:46
dan's here
23:48
looks like
23:54
there was a gecko discovered in 1877 a
23:57
british lieutenant colonel called rh
24:00
bedam
24:01
found it in india and then it
24:03
disappeared
24:04
and we just rediscovered it 135 years
24:06
later
24:07
we stumbled back upon it the jay paul
24:10
ground gekko very old
24:12
very bored not any company for a long
24:14
time
24:15
i missed the colonel
24:18
okay can i tell you something about
24:19
adhesion yeah i think you will like okay
24:21
this is in 2008
24:23
uh a campaigner against a third runway
24:24
at heathrow attempted to glue himself to
24:26
gordon brown at a downing street
24:28
reception
24:30
um he's called dan glass that'd be
24:32
terrible because you'd have to spend all
24:33
saturday night watching x factor
24:38
so he was about to receive an award from
24:40
the prime minister for his campaigning
24:41
work and then he stuck out his super
24:43
glued hand and touched the prime
24:44
minister's sleeve
24:46
and um downing street later said there
24:48
was no stickiness of any significance
24:51
but the amazing thing is he'd smuggled
24:52
this in in his pants
24:54
um and he said afterwards i just glued
24:56
myself to him and after 20 seconds he
24:58
tore my hand off it really hurt
25:00
he threw his hand off
25:05
he's a tough man wow he had to give a
25:08
couple of tugs before it came away um he
25:10
was just grinning about it he didn't
25:12
seem to take me seriously
25:16
and then later on he was allowed to stay
25:19
at number 10 for 40 minutes after this
25:20
happened
25:21
wow and when he left the building i'm
25:22
quoting from the bbc article about it
25:24
here
25:24
he tried to glue himself to the gates of
25:26
downing street but was prevented from
25:27
doing so by a police officer
25:29
i didn't have much glue left by that
25:31
point he said
25:33
[Applause]
25:34
okay time for fact number three and that
25:37
is james
25:38
okay my fact this week is that the
25:40
active ingredient
25:42
in the first ever homeopathy treatment
25:44
was the blood of thomas beckett
25:47
wow so this basically when thomas
25:50
beckett died he was
25:51
basically a saint straight away as soon
25:53
as he died and everyone thought he was
25:54
great
25:55
and they had his blood as a relic but
25:57
they only had a small amount of his
25:58
blood so the way that they could
26:00
um give it to lots of different people
26:02
was to put a tiny drop
26:03
an enormous vat of water and then take
26:06
bits of that water and give it to people
26:08
and it supposedly will be able to cure
26:09
everything
26:10
which as far as i'm concerned is pretty
26:11
much homeopathy i agree yeah and it's uh
26:15
supposedly uh just a few years after he
26:18
died
26:18
um in in from the time that they started
26:21
doing it to a few years after
26:22
something like 703 miracles supposedly
26:26
yeah yes but that was over the whole i
26:28
think that was over a 10-year period
26:30
and in just one year a couple of years
26:32
later a hundred thousand people visited
26:34
the um oh it's quite a low hit rate so
26:37
it's quite a low hit rate
26:38
but i found another report saying it was
26:39
that you know you would drink the water
26:41
this homeopathic water that james
26:42
has mentioned and also there were cases
26:45
were reported
26:46
in which it was used for the magical
26:48
detection of thieves and even for
26:50
extinguishing fires which
26:52
is the same as that yeah exactly it's a
26:55
miracle
26:57
the holy water put out this fire i was
27:00
thirsty before and now i am not nasty
27:03
i was dirty before i was too hot before
27:07
this magical substance can i tell you
27:11
about these just really quickly about
27:12
those monks yeah
27:13
so one of them uh was called william of
27:15
canterbury of the two monks who was
27:16
writing down because this was um in
27:18
canterbury that's where he died right
27:20
right that's where he was buried anyway
27:21
because he was the archbishop and she
27:22
was killed
27:23
and that's as part of canterbury tales
27:25
as well he is the journey
27:27
oh to physically the end point is thomas
27:30
a beckett right or thomas beckett not a
27:33
beckett right
27:34
that isn't beckett is a later edition he
27:37
never really had the ah
27:38
it was the same with a dildo
27:39
[Laughter]
27:42
dildo if he was on twitter these days he
27:44
would be thomas beckett
27:46
yeah um i always feel sorry for henry
27:48
the second in the thomas beckett
27:49
incident because he
27:50
said didn't he famously while people
27:52
claim that he said will no one rid me of
27:54
this turbulent priest or
27:55
uh some other phrase like that and that
27:58
is the kind of thing you say when you're
27:59
slightly pissed off with somebody and
28:00
what you're not asking your friends
28:02
to do is actually go and brutally murder
28:04
them yeah i wonder if he
28:05
they came back we're like well we did it
28:07
he's like you did what did what yeah
28:09
oh my god guys simon sharma reckons that
28:13
um
28:14
that's not the right no that's a really
28:16
neat phrase and
28:17
um the biographer at the time edward
28:19
grimm wrote in latin and he's
28:21
the the translation is what miserable
28:24
drones and traitors have i nourished and
28:25
brought up in my household
28:27
who let their lord be treated with such
28:28
shameful contempt by a lone born cleric
28:31
which is not catchy but actually there's
28:33
no way of
28:34
he's not saying that go and kill him is
28:36
he no although he is
28:37
no it's even more ambiguous but he is
28:40
actively saying that
28:41
his like the people who work for him
28:43
have a responsibility to go and seek
28:45
vengeance isn't he in that quote
28:46
he's saying you're crap because you're
28:48
letting us know exactly all over me
28:50
and i bet they got told off for doing it
28:52
it's one of those bosses
28:53
she's never happy one of them had to go
28:54
and fight on the crusades for 14 years
28:56
to say sorry really just to say sorry
28:58
yeah
28:59
yeah oh wow well henry was was i think
29:02
whipped by 80 monks
29:06
he requested it he was asking for it
29:09
he was like he wanted to be penitent so
29:11
he asked to be whipped
29:12
by these monks yeah and they they just
29:14
said sure
29:15
that's not weird we'll do it it was more
29:17
common at the time
29:18
yeah to uh to be requests for monks to
29:21
whip you
29:24
you're making it sound weird now one
29:27
thing i i read a really peculiar thing
29:28
about him
29:29
peculiar to me but then clearly i find
29:31
things like being whipped by eddie monks
29:33
peculiar so
29:34
maybe this is you're just weird i read
29:37
that on his death
29:38
the monks at canterbury discovered that
29:40
he wore a hair shirt
29:42
and it was infested with lice these were
29:45
under his vestments
29:46
what's a hair shirt that is a special
29:48
shirt made of very coarse animal hair
29:50
that you put on under your normal
29:51
clothes
29:52
and it scourges and irritates you and to
29:54
keep you suffering
29:55
oh so it was it wasn't like a nice
29:57
comfort thing no
29:59
do you not wear those what do you wear
30:02
when you go to be whipped by 80
30:06
thomas beckett was voted the second
30:08
worst britain of the last thousand years
30:11
oh yeah in a poll by bbc history
30:13
magazine
30:14
uh who came who came first chat the
30:16
ripper
30:17
wow so that's quite harsh yeah
30:19
considering that he wasn't really a
30:25
there are lots of other murderers i'm
30:26
surprised by jack the ripper
30:28
what surprised my jacket inverted the
30:30
worst britain the worst of all time
30:32
of all time who would you go for i don't
30:34
know
30:35
[Laughter]
30:37
there's a theory he got his name beckett
30:39
from uh beck which means beak
30:40
because he had quite a prominent nose
30:42
and that was maybe a family trait
30:44
and that's where his family got the
30:45
surname from it's just a theory but oh
30:47
really humanizes him a bit thomas beaky
30:49
when he was killed he'd just got back
30:50
from a six-year
30:52
i was going to say a six-year holiday
30:53
he'd actually been exiled um
30:55
in in fearing his life but still that's
30:58
how he was marketing it
30:59
yeah his friends so he was away for six
31:01
years because he was in fear of his life
31:04
yeah he was he was right if when he
31:07
literally arrived back he was killed he
31:09
came back under an amnesty
31:10
because he had a huge power struggle
31:12
with the king and then he got back
31:14
under an agreement and it was all going
31:15
to be fine and then he started
31:17
excommunicating
31:18
a load of people yeah who he'd
31:20
specifically agreed he wouldn't or the
31:21
king had asked him not to
31:23
okay so that was the reason that he was
31:25
killed back on your word
31:26
um on homeopathy the guy who came up
31:29
with it
31:30
uh so and called it homeopathy came with
31:31
the original theory for it
31:33
who was hahnemann he thought that coffee
31:36
was
31:36
the thing that caused when he went
31:37
through a facebook in the coffee caused
31:39
huge numbers of diseases
31:40
and he said the thing that was wrong
31:41
with coffee and the reason you know it's
31:42
bad is because
31:43
coffee drinking makes everything
31:45
pleasurable and you know that in life
31:47
you're supposed to suffer as well as
31:48
experience pleasure and
31:50
you sort of get drunk on coffee and you
31:52
enjoy everything too much
31:53
and that's not how it's supposed to be
31:55
so he says even in the corporal
31:57
functions
31:58
which in a natural state of health are
31:59
accompanied by rude and almost painful
32:01
sensations
32:02
now operate with an astonishing facility
32:04
and even with a species of pleasure
32:06
what is he referring to when he talks
32:07
about carp it sounds a lot like he's
32:09
referring to the fact that you've
32:10
suddenly got chronic diarrhea as soon as
32:12
you have a coffee and it sounds to me
32:13
like he was just a constipated man
32:15
sounds like he's got ibs yeah it does
32:17
doesn't it accompanied by rude and
32:18
painful sensations yeah it's ibs
32:20
yeah good diagnosis so george vi uh
32:23
received homeopathic treatment when he
32:25
was
32:26
trying to get his speech right so in the
32:29
king's speech he had that but it wasn't
32:30
in the movie
32:32
what did he have what did they give him
32:33
a ground-up word diluted heavily
32:35
how do they just a very short word
32:39
with lots of silence it was a medicine
32:42
called hypericum and um he was so
32:45
appreciative of it that he named a
32:47
racehorse after it
32:48
oh so quite appreciative yeah and i'm a
32:50
child after it
32:53
king hypericum probably best
32:57
um i saw i was i was looking on a forum
33:00
about uh
33:01
just i guess these kind of miracle
33:03
relics
33:04
that are out there and um someone was
33:07
asking an interesting question which is
33:09
they used to these these relics used to
33:11
sort of
33:12
perform or you know give miracles in
33:15
quite a sort of large
33:17
volume in the early days and the
33:19
question was as time passes
33:21
do relics perform less miracles just
33:24
because like the gecko on the wall after
33:26
half an hour it'll fall off yeah has he
33:28
got a period
33:28
of battery running exactly does it does
33:30
it have the ability to do it for so long
33:32
and um everyone obviously said no on the
33:35
forum but
33:36
yeah i just like that as a question i
33:37
like do they run out of steam
33:39
do they run out of steam yeah yeah well
33:41
because you just i love
33:42
this my favorite thing about this part
33:44
of history is with these kind of relics
33:46
like
33:46
it does sound like everyone was a
33:48
superhero back then and we've lost the
33:49
ability to be superheroes i found a
33:52
thing that james
33:52
uh posted on qi the forums years ago
33:56
um i found it this week but this is
33:59
really funny
33:59
so this is someone's superpower from
34:01
back in the day um
34:03
the times reported that sonora anna
34:05
morano the luminous
34:07
woman of piranha um she suffered from
34:10
asthma
34:11
and as a result of the asthma emitted a
34:13
blue glow
34:15
from her breasts as she slept many
34:18
doctors came to witness the phenomena
34:20
[Laughter]
34:23
but apparently i'm not sure if there's
34:25
ever an answer to why she had
34:26
is that a superpower are we counting
34:28
that as a superhero well i mean
34:30
uh that you know what purpose is that
34:32
luminous breast woman well if you're
34:33
lost in the
34:34
she piled up with t.s eliot in his green
34:36
face
34:39
circus if that's the times i guess
34:41
that's not as old as i thought it was
34:43
no it's quite i remember that i don't
34:45
remember it happening
34:46
i wasn't posing as a doctor or anything
34:49
um no but i remember reading about it i
34:50
think i read it
34:51
in 14 times actually so it must have
34:53
been only 10
34:54
in the last 10 years yeah i'm not sure
34:57
how real it was
34:58
blue boobs for short
35:03
after they finish filming a film they
35:05
just superimpose blue breasts onto
35:06
everyone
35:08
[Applause]
35:10
okay time for our final fact of the show
35:12
and that is my fact and my fact this
35:14
week is
35:14
that in 2013 a group of people
35:18
attempted to crowdfund london's first
35:20
ever ufo museum
35:22
they needed a million dollars but
35:24
unfortunately after 30 days of pushing
35:26
and trying to raise money
35:27
they only managed to get 370 i mean a
35:30
million in 30 days is very ambitious but
35:32
also
35:33
that is what that's ten dollars a day
35:34
they managed to raise it's almost like
35:36
the kind of people who are putting this
35:37
together have unrealistic ideas
35:40
not based in reality yeah they only got
35:43
four pledges
35:44
really from people and someone one it
35:46
felt like one of them was their mom
35:47
it was like you know like when you set
35:49
up this thing and it's like oh please
35:50
support my thing
35:51
yeah always your parents come in first
35:53
yeah yeah
35:54
so but i mean it looked really
35:56
interesting uh
35:57
what was going to be in the ufo museum
36:00
well it i think it was going to be uk
36:01
based ufo stuff of which there is tons
36:03
the biggest ever sighting of ufo
36:05
like a big ufo incident was in the uk
36:09
yeah but i mean get the actual saucer
36:11
did we we don't have the ufos
36:13
is it just a lot of mad people telling
36:15
anecdotes sort of stuck in rooms in the
36:17
museum
36:17
saying i saw this really scary thing in
36:20
the sky
36:21
yeah what would be really great is that
36:22
you go in and you don't see anything and
36:25
you come in and you go we saw nothing in
36:26
there
36:26
and then they say yeah the men in black
36:29
at the end
36:30
who wipe your memory that's a really
36:32
cheap way of making a
36:33
that's a brilliant idea um so there is a
36:37
there's not a ufo museum that i can find
36:39
in existence but you know
36:40
what i assume about are there ufo
36:42
museums as well yeah that's one in
36:43
russia
36:45
yeah oh yeah what's in there it's all i
36:48
guess i'll put like a
36:49
a a dummy of an alien and that will
36:51
become as famous as
36:53
what could be the real alien because
36:54
enough people have seen it yeah that's
36:56
what they do so there's a cryptozoology
36:58
museum
36:58
in maine and it seems like they do the
36:59
same thing they just keep making models
37:01
of
37:02
made-up animals and then saying isn't
37:03
this amazing this is what a yeti would
37:05
look like
37:06
if it was a thing yes um but it does
37:08
sound quite cool the international
37:10
cryptozoology museum
37:11
in portland they've got thousands of
37:13
exhibits and like bits that are claiming
37:15
to be bits of um barnum's fiji mermaid i
37:18
kind of want to test you on whether you
37:19
know what all these made-up words are
37:21
okay so i love them they're mate yeah
37:22
they're they're they're they're they're
37:22
they're they're they're they're they're
37:22
they're they're they're they're they're
37:22
they're they're they're they're made you
37:23
can see a few of them in the british
37:24
museum so these are the
37:25
one at the harnemann i think yeah so
37:27
these are the ones that it's a half
37:28
monkey half fish sewn together
37:30
yeah they are they're right there just
37:32
inside on the right hand side of the
37:34
british museum yeah
37:35
i think we've talked about them before
37:36
yeah we've talked about them in relation
37:37
to pt barnum
37:38
yeah who had a load of them one of his
37:41
other tricks was
37:42
he said i have a cherry colored cat in
37:44
this bag
37:45
and it was just sleeping in some cherry
37:47
paint
37:49
um no it was just a black cat and he
37:51
said some cherries
37:52
are black
37:52
[Laughter]
37:55
that's quite good yeah i kissed a girl
37:58
by the mermaid
37:59
in the british museum sorry hmm just
38:01
remember that's the worst katy perry
38:03
song i've ever heard
38:06
about the mermaid it sounds real you
38:08
know that half monkey fish thing
38:10
why did you kiss her just next to the
38:12
mermaid
38:13
a first date
38:18
so dan do you know what this is the so
38:21
this this museum contains
38:22
like loads of hair samples of like the
38:24
abominable snowman and
38:26
around pen deck and it's a single pube
38:28
from each one
38:29
i think
38:32
um and there's also a letter from the
38:34
actor jimmy stewart who's one of my
38:36
favorite actors so this disappoints me
38:38
if it's true
38:38
a letter from the actor jimmy stewart is
38:40
on display as his link to the pang
38:42
bok yeti hand mystery hand yeah yeah how
38:46
was jimmy
38:46
lincoln there was a hand which
38:48
supposedly belonged to a yeti
38:50
but yeah uh he was very obsessed with uh
38:52
yetis and he managed to get his hands
38:54
on this on the hand yeah there was a
38:56
review of this museum
38:58
and the guy said quite frankly we have
39:00
more creepy things in my living room
39:02
than they have in this museum
39:03
and then he gave it five stars
39:04
[Laughter]
39:07
another museum in america the cockroach
39:09
hall of fame museum
39:11
which is in plano texas uh this was a
39:13
guy called
39:14
michael boden um who was an exterminator
39:18
and he has dead cockroaches dressed as
39:22
celebrities
39:24
have you got any examples uh yes ross
39:27
paroch
39:28
oh my god and david letter roach
39:32
too has he i think he's also got a
39:33
liberochi hasn't he oh yeah
39:36
it's a little gold cape sitting at a
39:37
tiny piano yeah
39:39
so um this guy's experience with the
39:41
bazaar i'm reading here
39:42
um began in the 1980s when he held a
39:45
contest to find the biggest cockroach in
39:47
dallas
39:49
he later traveled the country judging
39:51
cockroach fashion contests
39:53
as a promotional stunts for an
39:55
insecticide company
39:57
well you wouldn't do it as anything else
39:58
would you it's a serious
40:00
investigation i like the way that he's
40:02
had that job and he's turned it into
40:03
something awesome like
40:04
music i bet the insane side come and
40:06
he's annoyed he sort of went a bit
40:08
off-piste
40:10
daniel i have a question for you what
40:12
shape was the first ever flying saucer
40:15
oh there's a clue in the word saucer so
40:18
it was round like a saucer no
40:21
it tricked you um no the the word saucer
40:25
why it was called flying sorceress
40:26
because it skipped
40:27
across the sky like a saucer like if you
40:29
were skimming a saucer
40:31
that's why it got called that it was
40:32
actually um crescent shaped
40:35
like a boomerang oh really yeah is that
40:38
why we can't keep them because they
40:39
always go back to where they came from
40:41
oh yeah well there aren't any ufos in
40:44
the museum
40:44
so do we know anything about the people
40:46
who started this are they
40:48
they're they're genuine believers in um
40:50
alien ufos
40:51
yeah well i'll give you i'll give you
40:52
the basic blurb yeah they wrote our team
40:54
includes people of soundbind
40:56
who wanted to go to a ufo museum one day
40:59
close to home in paris london and berlin
41:00
and realize that they had to travel
41:02
thousands of miles to visit such a place
41:04
when you have to start off
41:05
something by saying where of sound mind
41:08
obviously it's like
41:09
well i think they think sound mind means
41:11
they hear voices in their head
41:15
we already have access to material from
41:16
a former ufo museum
41:18
but to open a new place today that would
41:20
look modern one would need much more
41:22
material
41:22
and to purchase new equipment we've even
41:24
found a few perfect locations to rent in
41:26
london but there are many other issues
41:28
to solve first
41:29
we need your support to do more research
41:31
produce more information boards
41:32
mannequins videos pictures
41:35
computers etc we truly believe this is a
41:38
unique exciting project that would
41:39
attract a lot of people and we need your
41:41
help and support to make this become a
41:42
reality
41:43
that was their basic blurb no mention of
41:46
what would be in there
41:47
um have you heard of kick ended no no
41:50
it's a side project to kickstarter which
41:53
a man has set up which is all the
41:55
projects on kickstarter which have
41:57
made nothing okay and they include
42:00
um the book so long constipation
42:05
um that's a toilet book
42:09
anyone who doesn't have two or more
42:10
easily possible bowel movements a day
42:12
will benefit from reading so long
42:14
constipation
42:14
have you seen those adverts for
42:16
anti-constipation medicine which say
42:18
uh instant overnight relief no it really
42:21
doesn't sound like someone does it
42:23
you might want to clean your sheets in
42:24
the morning total immediate relief
42:27
wherever you are relief
42:30
everywhere yeah sorry so
42:33
so long constipation didn't get a single
42:35
no nothing do you know what else didn't
42:37
get a single pledge
42:38
is someone called henrietta needed to
42:40
raise six thousand dollars to fund her
42:42
comedy show called
42:44
please love me oh my god nothing
42:47
nobody zero if you're out there
42:50
henrietta we love you
42:51
another quite good idea that i might
42:52
have donated to um was the little eats
42:55
did you read that which is a guy who uh
42:57
has invented a food that is dog food
43:00
and human food which if you have a dog
43:03
they're always
43:04
you can eat dog food can't you yeah and
43:06
dogs can eat human food i don't know can
43:07
you eat dog food
43:08
without really hating it yeah no
43:11
probably not
43:12
it's probably not tasty but i think you
43:13
can eat it yeah oh yeah i remember the
43:15
new
43:15
thing about a supermarket there was a
43:17
fact that i'm going to get the numbers
43:19
wrong but it's something like
43:20
um there is enough food in a supermarket
43:23
um for a single person to stay alive for
43:25
56
43:26
years and it's something like 67 years
43:28
if you're willing to eat dog food
43:30
oh yeah i'd eat the dog food early on
43:34
because you don't want your last
43:35
year to be the worst year you'd save the
43:38
haribos
43:40
that's a really good idea yeah but then
43:42
if you get saved
43:44
after like five years why did you eat
43:46
the dog food first
43:47
there'd be psychologically a lot of
43:49
questions going on yeah
43:51
can i just take it back to museums for a
43:53
second uh because
43:54
i just did a search on the sort of weird
43:57
museums of the world
43:58
and there's so many great ones i don't
44:00
know why they exist but i'm so glad that
44:02
they do
44:02
uh the giant shoe museum
44:06
it's it's i don't know if you count it
44:07
as a museum it's a single exhibit
44:09
wall is it a show no it says here
44:13
to see the museum's collections visitors
44:15
must drop quarters into a coin box and
44:17
then look through
44:18
stereoscope viewing slots that reveal
44:20
views of a variety of giant shoes
44:23
uh including size 37. that's american
44:26
size though yeah but that was worn by
44:28
the world's tallest man
44:29
and the world's largest collection of
44:31
giant shoes tallest ever man william
44:33
wadlow
44:34
yeah was he called no robert wadlow he
44:37
was a shoe salesman that was his job was
44:39
he
44:39
yeah because he had to get really really
44:41
big shoes because
44:42
they didn't make them that size he went
44:44
to the company and they said yeah sure
44:45
you can have them for free
44:46
if you go around and sell them and he
44:48
did but why would anyone else want to
44:49
buy size 37 shoes it was an example of
44:52
what great worksmanship you have because
44:54
you can make such a big one then surely
44:55
you can make little ones as well
44:57
right okay that's very cool so
44:59
minnesota's science museum has the
45:01
content of a former museum inside it
45:03
which was called the museum of
45:04
questionable medical devices
45:06
oh yeah uh including the prostate gland
45:08
warmer
45:09
the vibratory chair and the recto rotor
45:13
you just picked three at random there
45:16
france has four museums devoted to foie
45:18
gras
45:18
wow i mean they didn't want more than
45:21
the first one actually but
45:22
the people behind the museum just kept
45:24
stuffing them down their throats
45:28
that's scary are you pretty lazy
45:32
okay that's it that's all of our facts
45:34

00:28
thanks
00:32
hello and welcome to another edition of
00:35
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:37
coming from the qi offices in covent
00:39
garden
00:39
my name is andy and i'm sitting here
00:41
with three of the regular elves james
00:43
harkin alex bell and anna tajinski
00:45
and we've gathered our favorite facts
00:47
from the last seven days and we're now
00:49
going to talk about them
00:50
in no particular order
00:56
first fact is alex
00:59
okay my fact is cows have friends and
01:02
they get sad when you separate them
01:04
oh how are they cow friends yeah so
01:07
basically
01:08
um northampton university um did a study
01:11
so cows are heard animals obviously
01:14
yeah yeah so they live in a herd but
01:16
they get separated a lot because you
01:17
know they need to be milk they need to
01:18
be taken to the vets et cetera
01:20
um and northampton university did a
01:22
study uh where they
01:23
looked at cows when they were in a field
01:25
and monitored all their behavior to see
01:26
which cows hung out with which other
01:28
cows and then
01:30
they separated them out into different
01:31
combinations so sometimes they'd be
01:33
removed from the herd in pairs
01:34
and sometimes they'd be with a cow
01:36
they'd never hung out with before or
01:38
sometimes they'd be with their best
01:39
friend
01:40
don't know how we worked out bracelets
01:42
do they wear bracelets yeah
01:44
and sometimes they were on their own uh
01:46
and
01:47
their each time their heart rates and
01:49
cortisol levels were monitored um
01:51
and from that apparently we can work out
01:53
um
01:54
whether cows get stressed or not
01:56
cortisol we should say is the
01:57
stress hormone is that right yeah
01:59
apparently there's quite a high level of
02:00
stress with integrating into a new
02:02
uh herd so if you take a cow and you put
02:04
it in i was gonna say how stressful
02:05
could it be being a cow well
02:09
very fair enough if you know what your
02:11
demise is going to be i would say
02:13
very but that's true they don't given
02:15
how little is going on in their lives i
02:16
think any change is pretty stressful i
02:18
mean if you're moving
02:19
from one field to the other that's
02:20
probably groundbreaking to them
02:22
if you think about it yeah yeah so it's
02:24
hard it's hard to tell if that counts as
02:25
a friend
02:26
yeah we're kind of anthropomorphizing
02:28
them aren't we i think elephants always
02:29
feel like they're the clo they're the
02:31
ones that we're most justified in
02:32
anthropomorphizing because
02:34
they have they mainly have a weirdly
02:35
human attitude towards their dead don't
02:37
they they mourn don't they
02:38
yeah they mourn their dead and they bury
02:40
them sometimes with leaves and earth and
02:42
they'll
02:43
come back to visit where the where the
02:45
elephant died their family member died
02:47
the thing about elephant graveyards is
02:48
that a myth or is that real
02:49
it is a myth yeah yeah so that's the
02:51
idea that um the elephants will
02:53
go to a certain place to die and then
02:55
you'll find lots of bones there because
02:57
it's a special place for elephants but
02:59
you'd feel
02:59
terrible if you were an elephant and
03:01
everyone's everyone else said hey come
03:02
on we're going to the elephant graveyard
03:04
and you said why they said no reason
03:08
that's like the um the cartoon the daily
03:11
mash of the turkey
03:12
um which is saying just before christmas
03:14
it's a bubble speech bubble coming out
03:15
of the turkey's mouth saying
03:17
hey guys so are you doing anything for
03:18
new year
03:21
feel sad but elephants something really
03:23
weird about elephants are on it is
03:25
if you show them a piece of ivory and
03:27
then a piece of wood they get much more
03:28
agitated by the ivory and if you show
03:30
them an elephant skull and then the
03:31
skull of another large arm like a hippo
03:33
skull they're much more agitated by the
03:34
elephant skull
03:35
really which seems elegant skulls are
03:37
quite scary though aren't they because
03:38
they have like a big
03:39
hole yes that is true the idea is that's
03:42
where cyclops
03:43
myth might have come from because it
03:45
looks like there's a massive eye hole in
03:47
the middle but actually it's where the
03:48
trunk comes out from
03:50
cow skulls only have uh they only have
03:52
bottom teeth so they're
03:53
that we have two sets of teeth obviously
03:55
and yeah top teeth and bottom teeth they
03:56
only have bottom teeth and where the top
03:58
teeth should be
03:58
there's just a sort of long area of bone
04:01
so they they grind up
04:03
what they eat really yeah cows don't
04:04
have upper teeth so i would basically i
04:06
was looking into how
04:08
the digestive system of a cow so they're
04:10
they're ruminants which means that
04:11
they basically ferment the grass first
04:14
they eat so they pick up the grass by
04:15
they actually curl their tongues around
04:17
the grass instead of ripping it up with
04:18
their teeth which i thought was really
04:19
interesting
04:20
then they chew it then they it goes down
04:22
into their stomach and sits there for
04:23
oil and ferments for a bit so they get
04:24
nutrients out and then they regurgitate
04:26
it back into
04:27
their mouths and chew it some more which
04:28
is the ruminating bit and that's cards
04:30
now so that's where chewing the card
04:31
comes from
04:32
and then they sort out again winding
04:33
your tongue around a blade of grass is
04:35
quite sexy isn't it
04:37
you know women for yourself you know
04:45
[Laughter]
04:47
i bet cows tied cherries in knots as a
04:49
final
04:51
yeah that's what i was thinking of
04:52
what's that you know when you tie cherry
04:54
in a knot with your tongue and then
04:55
that's kind of shows that you're
04:57
yeah cherry stock that that sounds
04:59
incredibly difficult and i don't think
05:00
it's not that hard my brother yeah yeah
05:03
it's not as hard
05:04
once you learn how to do it's pretty
05:06
easy and you're a babe magnet then
05:08
yeah i could also pick up blades of
05:09
grass with my tongue
05:12
another animal which has friends is
05:14
sharks
05:15
if you can believe sharks have friends i
05:17
don't believe that
05:18
um oh okay some scientists analyzed a
05:22
group of a particular species of sharks
05:24
which swim around together and they
05:26
couldn't work out if they were swimming
05:27
together because
05:28
they were just food sources which were
05:30
close to each other all their home
05:31
ranges were
05:31
in the same place but they discovered
05:33
that actually some shark preferred the
05:35
company of
05:36
certain other sharks and actively
05:38
avoided other ones
05:40
even though they were all in the same
05:42
area if their territories overlapped so
05:43
they've included these sharks basically
05:45
they're friends it's so good it could be
05:47
that they have
05:48
friends or it could be that they just
05:50
have enemies and they're hanging around
05:52
these other guys because they're not
05:53
enemies
05:53
what's the definition of an enemy or a
05:56
friend true
05:57
yeah this is is quite interesting
05:59
they're like why would animals have
06:00
friends and there must be an
06:01
evolutionary reason for it
06:03
and i read two possible explanations i'd
06:05
never heard before
06:06
so one of them was the enemy's enemy
06:08
thing and evidence for that is in
06:10
dolphins who they there were two
06:13
dolphins who had avoided each other so
06:15
they didn't particularly like each other
06:16
and then as soon as another dolphin came
06:18
along that wasn't part of their group
06:19
and that was effectively an enemy to
06:20
both of them
06:21
those two first two dolphins started
06:22
hanging out with each other became
06:24
bestest buddies
06:24
because suddenly they unite against
06:26
their common enemy so what i feel is
06:28
happening with this podcast actually and
06:29
the new guy and you're all ganging up on
06:31
me and being horrible shut up alex
06:34
the other good explanation i thought
06:36
about why animals are friends to be
06:37
attracted to the opposite sex
06:38
so they studied macaques and there was a
06:41
macaque who was super attractive
06:42
like really good physical build etc but
06:45
he wasn't very good at making friends
06:46
with other males and women stop shocking
06:48
him so same with humans i guess if
06:50
someone's unpopular
06:51
again we we need to say female macaques
06:56
i think just going back to the dolphins
06:58
for a second um
07:00
they hang out in pods i think to feed
07:02
though don't they because
07:04
they swim around in a circle making
07:06
bubbles and trapping
07:07
uh fish in those bubbles so that they
07:09
can eat them so that's kind of a useful
07:11
uh reason for having friends i think the
07:14
smallest unit of dolphins
07:16
is two or three males and they club up
07:19
to guard the females basically that they
07:21
uh perceived as being theirs and then
07:23
several of those little units
07:24
were grouped together to steal females
07:26
from other males
07:27
but sometimes two of those even larger
07:30
units will club up
07:31
um and form a kind of coalition even
07:33
though normally they're rivals
07:35
wow then there must come an awkward
07:36
moment where the dolphins have to decide
07:37
which one them actually gets
07:38
to copulate with the female well
07:40
dolphins have a very
07:41
varied sex life so they can all do it
07:44
you're saying
07:45
yeah they have they have blowhole sex
07:48
and um they have they have all kinds of
07:50
sex long-haul jobs
07:53
okay there is one other sign that could
07:55
be um an indicator that animals are
07:57
friends with each other which is they
07:58
measure the levels of oxytocin
08:00
inside them which is known in humans as
08:01
the love hormone and if you have it you
08:03
you are more inclined to
08:05
trust other people and love them and he
08:07
tested this is interspecies friendship
08:08
so that's very exciting
08:10
i like disney film friendships yeah
08:11
exactly yeah um they tested a terrier
08:13
and a goat
08:14
which were both young males and they
08:16
they were used to playing and having
08:17
play fights and
08:18
playfully nipping each other rolling
08:20
around in this stuff and so they played
08:21
for 15 minutes and then after that
08:23
they measured the levels of oxytocin the
08:26
amount of oxytocin in the dog had
08:27
increased by 48
08:29
which they said suggested the dog was
08:32
quite attached to the goat
08:34
um however the goats increase in
08:36
oxytocin was 210
08:38
and the authors of this said we
08:40
essentially found that the goat might
08:42
have been in love with the dog
08:44
which is a tragic thing
08:47
this isn't that great now that's sad
08:50
yeah
08:51
yeah uh just so animal friendships most
08:53
people uh
08:54
thought that animals with big brains are
08:55
more likely to make friends and they
08:56
found that fruit bats can make friends
08:57
as well and they have tiny brains
08:59
so that's quite confusing but they found
09:01
this because things like there was a
09:03
pregnant fruit bat
09:04
and they found that she was being
09:06
groomed and hugged repeatedly by
09:08
another bat who was unrelated to her
09:09
another female bat and then when she
09:11
gave
09:11
birth then uh the the other female bat
09:14
who'd been grooming her
09:15
and a third female fanned her with their
09:17
wings
09:18
to keep her cool wow just being nice to
09:21
each other for no reason
09:22
you know bats can fan each other with
09:23
their wings that's amazing in itself i
09:25
think
09:25
yeah that is cool now i wish i had wings
09:28
yes because that's the primary use for
09:30
wings isn't it
09:30
the best thing is that you can use the
09:34
keyboard
09:42
oh you can do that with them too
09:46
um d.h lawrence had a cow called susan
09:49
um yeah which he loved and wrote a lot
09:50
about and there's one other um celebrity
09:52
cow
09:53
that i found um elm farm olly also known
09:55
as the sky queen
09:57
was the first cow to fly an airplane to
09:58
fly in an airplane
10:02
the sky
10:05
for a while she was at the controls
10:08
that's how i got over the moon right
10:12
um yeah so she was the first car to fly
10:13
in an airplane um it was in 1930 at the
10:16
international air exposition in missouri
10:18
a man called ellsworth bunts became the
10:20
first man to milk a cow mid-flight
10:22
which he did in that flight and he
10:24
parachuted cartons of milk down to the
10:26
spectators below
10:28
and that is the stupid most brilliant
10:30
thing that's fantastic right
10:32
um another thing that sorry and another
10:34
thing
10:37
if that was intentional anna you're
10:38
fired from the podcast
10:40
another thing that affects cow lactation
10:43
um is slow songs
10:44
apparently if you play slow ballads to a
10:47
cow then their lactation increases but
10:49
if you play fast clubby songs
10:51
to a cow i think it was described as
10:52
euro club classics
10:54
uh there's no effect on lactation i
10:55
don't know what the euro club classics
10:57
are
10:57
yeah eiffel 65 probably that one
11:02
ever died thank you very much
11:08
okay time for fact number two which this
11:10
week is james harkin
11:12
okay my fact is that it's illegal to
11:15
take a selfie with a tiger
11:17
in new york city what so many questions
11:22
well it kind of speaks for itself really
11:23
this is a new law that's come in
11:25
and it prohibits direct contact between
11:27
members of the public and big cats
11:30
so it's like with travelling circuses or
11:32
that kind of thing
11:33
and really it's that you're not allowed
11:35
any photos but obviously the press have
11:37
put it forward as no tiger selfies
11:39
because apparently tiger selfies are a
11:41
thing
11:42
on our dating websites yes to make i've
11:45
just realized someone's told me about
11:46
this and to make men look
11:47
extra manly apparently they photograph
11:49
themselves next to big
11:51
it's simultaneously manly and cuddly
11:54
because you're cuddling a tiger but it's
11:56
a tiger i know alex you've done it
11:57
haven't you i've been to i've been to i
11:58
haven't i have visited
12:00
i have visited the blog which i found
12:01
this morning called tinder guys with
12:03
tigers but actually thinking about it
12:04
now
12:05
if you're next to a tiger the tiger is
12:07
big and manly and
12:08
well not manly but big and powerful um
12:11
and next to him you're just going to
12:13
look
12:13
less powerful so you want to be next to
12:15
a really weak like a hamster or
12:16
something there's lots of baby tiger
12:18
photos
12:18
well maybe women will be very
12:20
disappointed on the eventual dates
12:22
because they assumed that it was the
12:23
tiger in the photo
12:24
[Laughter]
12:26
um well this is the technique that was
12:28
surely first patented by vladimir putin
12:31
oh yeah who has photos taken with every
12:33
wild animal
12:34
but they're mainly dead aren't they they
12:36
know that a lot of the well
12:37
he does he does some hunting once there
12:38
is genuinely putin swimming with
12:40
dolphins on the internet
12:41
dolphins who are previously enemies
12:42
ganged up and
12:47
he's trying to ban blowhole sex
12:53
that's satire right
12:57
i was looking into history of selfies
12:59
because it seems quite like a modern
13:00
thing so i had a look
13:01
um the earliest photograph of actually
13:04
the earliest photograph of a person in
13:05
american history um is is actually a
13:07
selfie um it was taken by a guy called
13:10
robert cornelius and he took it in 1839
13:12
he was a lamp maker um and
13:14
he was responsible for developing a
13:15
process called daguropaty um which was a
13:17
short-lived photographic
13:18
process of some sort um which is
13:20
probably during the 1840s
13:21
the process was so slow that he was
13:23
actually able to set up the camera and
13:24
then run into shot for about a minute or
13:26
so and then go and close the lens cap
13:27
which is
13:28
quite quite and the photos were called
13:30
daguerreotypes
13:31
that was it um wikipedia describes the
13:33
photo which you can go and see as
13:35
an off-center portrait of a man with
13:37
crossed arms and towels hair
13:39
so i reckon it would be pretty well on
13:40
instagram because that's that's pretty
13:42
close to the mark for the first selfie
13:43
that's
13:44
quite cool pretty well done yeah yeah do
13:45
we think that was the first
13:47
self portrait no because people have
13:49
been drawing themselves for years but i
13:50
had to look into what the first ever
13:52
there's a collection of lines in a cave
13:56
um which may which may be a drawing of a
13:59
face
14:00
27 000 years old we're kind of assuming
14:03
it's the same person who drew it though
14:04
if we're saying it's a selfie
14:06
exactly yeah it's it's open to debate
14:08
there are a few lines next to it that
14:10
look a bit like a tiger
14:12
um 19th century portraits are fun um we
14:14
talked about
14:15
headless photos headless photos so
14:18
so yeah victorians like to like to
14:20
photograph themselves headless i think
14:22
and carrying their heads or with their
14:24
heads in their laps they managed to
14:25
doctor photos from a really early time
14:27
so you get portraits from the 1850s and
14:29
60s
14:30
they weren't necessarily doctored they
14:32
were like illusions they actually didn't
14:34
have heads
14:35
the photo was so prestigious back then
14:37
that you would have your own head cut
14:38
off
14:39
to have a photo made of you so that it
14:41
would look better no totally worth it a
14:42
lot of them would be
14:43
like it's hard to describe but as in
14:45
there would be illusions so that you'd
14:47
have two people in the photo and one
14:48
person would be sort of
14:49
on the end of a table with their head
14:51
resting on it and the rest of their body
14:52
uh sort of out of shot and then another
14:54
person would be organized in a way that
14:56
you
14:56
didn't look like their head was there
14:58
and when you lined them up it looked
14:58
like their head was not where it's
14:59
supposed to be oh
15:00
that's very good um and have you heard
15:02
of have you heard of snap shooting which
15:04
was a game
15:05
that people played no this is in the
15:06
very early days of handheld cameras it's
15:08
so much fun you had to escape while
15:09
someone else tried to take a photo of
15:11
you oh
15:12
isn't that cool that's quite good it's a
15:14
bit like
15:15
laser quest yeah but it's laser quest
15:18
where you don't know the results for
15:18
three days until you've had the photos
15:20
developed
15:21
it sounds like a fun game this is really
15:23
interesting i thought
15:24
um so after national so national
15:27
geographic published its first
15:28
wildlife photographs in 1906 in the
15:31
magazine
15:32
and two of the national geographic
15:33
society board members
15:35
resigned in disgust because wildlife
15:38
photos
15:38
they said it was becoming a mere picture
15:40
book and that wasn't what the national
15:41
geographic was all about
15:42
wow yeah a few more selfie things you
15:45
know these selfie sticks yes
15:47
yeah um there's a thing called a belfie
15:49
stick do you know what that is
15:50
um selfie stick is it well a belfie i i
15:54
know to my shame is a selfie of your own
15:56
bosom yes
15:57
so it's a stick to take a photo of your
15:59
own bottom that's right a self
16:00
colonoscopy
16:03
no it's not that the article i read said
16:06
it's curiously out of stock at the
16:08
moment but is ostensibly a real product
16:11
so i'm not sure if it's even real
16:12
okay but the idea is that you hold it
16:15
and then it takes a picture of your bum
16:16
and then you can send it to people
16:17
presumably
16:18
you want to see that kind of thing oh
16:20
brave new world
16:22
uh the statue of liberty is taking one
16:24
continuous long selfie i found this on
16:26
reddit today um
16:27
there's uh her hand which is holding up
16:29
the um
16:31
torch um there's a camera video camera
16:33
which you can stream a live
16:34
feed from online and it's pointing down
16:36
to her face so she's taking one wow
16:38
that's pretty cool right that's great
16:39
really good that's such a good fact
16:41
yeah veinous woman in the world does
16:44
anyone have more
16:45
some stuff about things illegal in new
16:47
york oh yeah
16:48
okay so it's strangely it's illegal to
16:51
honk your horn
16:52
in new york city unless it's an
16:53
emergency so that's another
16:55
accuracy then because any time there's
16:57
an establishing shot of new york there's
16:58
the soundtrack there's lots of lots of
17:00
no it's not allowed it's just that
17:01
everyone's breaking the line right
17:03
there's a constant state of emergency
17:07
um it's also illegal for three or more
17:10
people to dance in new york city
17:11
what this is the rave laws that they
17:13
have there so what constitutes a rave
17:15
also in the same place yeah you can book
17:17
an appointment with the city
17:19
can i dance now what do you mean in the
17:20
same place uh
17:22
it's okay if you're in your own home
17:24
actually but
17:25
it's going to be the people in your home
17:26
have to be yourself people who live
17:28
there
17:28
or bona fide guests it's legal in
17:31
churches
17:32
and weirdly it's also legal in premises
17:35
licensed as retail cigarette dealers
17:38
the cigarette buying dance you have to
17:40
do in order to get your twenty more
17:41
likes
17:42
that's right so if you're in a bar and
17:43
three of you are dancing you need um
17:45
a license need a dancing license so the
17:48
bar might have a dancing license yeah
17:49
otherwise it constitutes an illegal
17:51
right
17:51
and um also pinball machines were
17:53
illegal in a lot of america but in new
17:55
york until the 70s
17:56
wow um it was because it was kind of
17:59
gambling and in the 1940s mayor
18:01
laguardia smashed up a load of pinball
18:03
machines in front of the press and threw
18:05
them in the sea
18:06
he threw the press into the sleeve
18:10
recently the mayor of riga drove a tank
18:12
over an illegally parked car
18:14
to make a point although he had
18:16
illegally parked the car himself
18:18
so it wasn't uh it wasn't just a random
18:20
illegal parked car what was the point he
18:22
was making that look at my big tank
18:26
yeah clearly literally it was park
18:29
properly big issues in in latvia what
18:32
we're talking about
18:32
we're talking about it now so it's
18:35
worked if i yeah actually guys i'm
18:36
double parked out there so i'm just
18:38
gonna have to go before the bear
18:40
freaking
18:44
all right time for fact number three uh
18:46
which is anna
18:48
yep my fact this week is that morgue
18:50
refrigerators in turkey
18:51
are equipped with motion sensors alarms
18:54
and handles that open them from the
18:55
inside
18:56
in case anyone in there wakes up
18:58
perfectly perfectly sensible precaution
19:00
i think so does it happen ever um it has
19:03
uh i don't think there's been any
19:04
instances certainly not in that place of
19:06
it happening
19:06
um but i think there's a sort of
19:08
widespread paranoia
19:10
in that area of turkey it's in malatya
19:12
in turkey and
19:13
they have yes they've got like door
19:15
handles on the inside there are sensors
19:17
all around the inside compartment so
19:19
that if anything touches the walls then
19:21
automatically the drawer comes open
19:23
so the corpse is free to leave but um
19:26
but corpses move around a little bit
19:28
don't because the
19:28
escaping gases and i think eventually
19:32
but not very much and also when they
19:33
become zombies yes
19:35
yes that is a concern in which case why
19:37
have we built easy access
19:39
from the wall compartments that's true
19:42
if the zombie apocalypse happens these
19:44
are going to be the first guys out
19:45
there yeah and they'll let all the
19:46
others out um in the 19th century
19:49
there was no reliable indicator for
19:51
death people did not know that it was
19:53
your heartbeat
19:54
ah but that's still kind of true because
19:56
it could be brain activity
19:59
that's true but so i think actually
20:01
there is a slight kind of
20:02
argument about how you can actually say
20:05
that someone's dead whether it's a
20:06
heartbeat whether it's a brain activity
20:08
yeah it's almost like we know so much
20:10
now that we've blurred the boundary that
20:11
we
20:11
originally set yeah well they just
20:13
didn't have a boundary tool they knew
20:15
nothing at all
20:15
and they had competitions um to enter
20:19
where you would be given 1500 pranks if
20:21
you worked out an easy and reliable sign
20:22
of death
20:23
um the winner was the heartbeat and it
20:25
was the man eugene bouchou who invented
20:28
the stethoscope and um eugene
20:31
sounds like what you might hear down a
20:33
stethoscope
20:36
but it was fantastic and he got a lot of
20:37
criticism for being so impetuous as to
20:39
say that you could
20:40
bury someone only two minutes after
20:42
ascertaining that they were dead
20:44
everyone else said no no no you should
20:45
wait and it took it took years
20:47
did you say that he invented the
20:48
stethoscope sorry sorry he didn't yeah
20:50
yeah
20:51
because the stethoscope was invented by
20:52
a guy who was embarrassed when he had to
20:55
take
20:55
the heartbeat of a particularly buxom
20:58
lady wasn't it
20:59
and the way that you used to do it was
21:01
you would put your head right down next
21:02
to someone's chest
21:04
and he was embarrassed to to kind of go
21:06
into the breast area so
21:08
he left her alone excuse me while i go
21:09
and invent something
21:13
i might be wrong about this but i think
21:14
he did it with a rolled up newspaper or
21:16
something and thought
21:17
well this works quite well and now i'm
21:19
gonna make something even better i might
21:20
be wrong about that last bit i'm not
21:22
sure
21:22
the other ideas suggested for the prize
21:24
included um
21:25
sticking a thermometer into the stomach
21:27
to see if you were cold enough to be
21:28
buried into the rectum would be good
21:30
uh i don't think anyone suggested that
21:33
for this because you've got two
21:34
different ways one
21:35
the shock of having something up your
21:36
bum and two temperature
21:38
yeah okay well they're not actually
21:40
still taking
21:41
uh submissions but i i will pass it on
21:46
they they also had attaching pincers to
21:48
the nipples of the presumed corpse
21:50
um just burning the patient's arm with
21:52
boiling water and seeing what happened
21:54
putting a multitude of leeches near the
21:56
bottom um or sticking similar to my wife
22:00
or sticking a very long needle with a
22:01
flag at one end into the heart
22:04
and if the patient was alive and there
22:05
was any movement the flag would wave a
22:06
bit
22:07
and not for long and then when he died
22:10
it would come down to half half-mast
22:13
one doctor said that the patient's
22:15
tongue should be rhythmically pulled for
22:16
three hours
22:19
we should say a lot of this is from a
22:20
fantastic book by john bonderson
22:22
called buried alive and it has a huge
22:24
amount of unbelievably interesting
22:26
information about this
22:27
cultural fear over the centuries since
22:29
you mentioned putting stuff up the anus
22:31
in the late 18th century doctors william
22:34
halls and thomas cogan decided the best
22:36
treatment
22:37
for someone who seemed dead after
22:39
drowning was
22:40
a tobacco enema um and so they used to
22:43
shove things up your anus didn't they
22:44
and that had like a dual purpose of
22:46
testing if someone was
22:47
dead giving you a nice hit of tobacco
22:50
exactly
22:52
and it was thought that first of all it
22:54
would warm up the drowned person by
22:56
pumping tobacco up their bum
22:58
and second it would stimulate their
22:59
respiration again um and it got a lot
23:01
more popular
23:02
when they started doing it with bellows
23:04
so they're a kit so before
23:05
this they were just doing it with a with
23:07
their mouth to the bun
23:08
no so mouth to ass resuscitation yeah
23:12
it was mouth upon resuscitation which
23:14
was problematic because a lot of people
23:15
had died of illnesses which involved
23:16
quite a lot of
23:17
like fecal matter being infected so
23:19
quite a few people who tried this
23:21
doctors who tried this ended up dying
23:22
themselves
23:23
to be fair they were supposed to blow
23:24
not suck yeah exactly yeah they did it
23:26
wrong but then
23:27
once that doctor's died presumably
23:29
another doctor will come along and say
23:31
my god this patient has died i must
23:32
resuscitate it this is an awful chain
23:34
reaction
23:35
if you've just stuck to backup someone's
23:36
asked then you're gonna suck instead of
23:38
blow because you've basically made a
23:39
human cigarette
23:42
it's gonna be the sequel to the human
23:44
center they used to hang those tobacco
23:46
enema bellows up by the river thames
23:48
where you would have life
23:49
belts today or life rings they would
23:52
just have
23:53
stan as standard have you guys heard of
23:55
the toten house
23:56
no um so these were literally that means
23:59
house of the dead obviously that was a
24:01
19th century germany they're very
24:02
popular these were basically large halls
24:04
which are sometimes very lavish and
24:06
neatly decorated
24:06
um in which bodies were kept for several
24:09
days um to ensure that they were really
24:10
dead i think this is a pretty grim job
24:12
if you were an attendant at this hall
24:13
you had
24:14
possibly had 12 hour shifts waiting for
24:16
any signs of life terrifying
24:18
horrible job really quite easy actually
24:21
i mean
24:21
what's a call not a lot of times at
24:23
which anyone actually wakes up i guess
24:25
yeah but if you missed that one time
24:26
then yeah if you fell asleep for that
24:28
one
24:29
five minute window when the zombie
24:31
apocalypse they all came
24:32
up and they're like jeff what were you
24:34
doing you were supposed to be watching
24:35
them
24:36
you just woke up as an empty hall and
24:38
you're like oh [ __ ]
24:39
um yeah the paris morgue actually um was
24:43
around the turn of the 20th century it
24:45
was
24:46
arguably the most popular tourist
24:48
destination in paris
24:49
and that's at a time when the eiffel
24:51
tower felt as well
24:53
they were getting up to 40 000 visitors
24:55
in a single day
24:56
they did you see that with mentalist
24:57
items as well they were in some weird
24:59
tourist attractions
25:00
last week i was in portugal and anyone
25:02
who follows me on twitter will know this
25:03
already but i went to
25:05
a bone chapel it was in evora which is a
25:09
town in the middle of portugal and it
25:11
was made by the monks and they took
25:13
all of the bodies out of the town and
25:16
then
25:16
sort of put them on the walls in like
25:18
some kind of weird tiling
25:20
yeah it's like tiling yeah wow so it
25:22
decorates the whole chapel
25:24
the best thing about it was i took a
25:25
photo of it and put it on facebook and
25:27
facebook recognized the skulls and tried
25:29
to make me tag them as my friends
25:31
i thought they were people i mean that's
25:33
great so they've just got
25:34
real skeletons yeah real skeletons yeah
25:36
hanging up
25:37
and they have actual dead bodies as well
25:39
but when we were there the dead bodies
25:41
had been taken down for restoration
25:46
but it was supposed to be a place where
25:48
you would go when you think about your
25:49
mortality and
25:50
and whatever so you know memento maurice
25:52
no uh well they're kind of things
25:54
that uh remind us that you're going to
25:56
die basically and
25:58
that that all this is temporary and all
26:00
all flesh is dust and all of this stuff
26:02
so it's just something to remind you so
26:04
in lots of um
26:05
medieval renaissance pictures there's a
26:06
skull there just to point out
26:08
you're gonna die um watching countdown
26:14
the memento marion countdown could be
26:15
the big clock oh that's like graves
26:24
[Laughter]
26:26
oh basically as well as a memento maura
26:28
there's also a memento viva ray
26:30
oh which is a really nice thing it's a
26:31
reminder that you are alive and to take
26:33
pleasure in life and you don't really
26:35
hear
26:35
much about um so there was a thread of
26:37
people who worked in mortuaries
26:39
uh comparing their experiences and there
26:41
was someone who'd had a job in a
26:43
military and they
26:44
got in someone who died who'd been a
26:46
hand model and he said it was really
26:48
weird because he went into the service
26:49
the funeral service that they were
26:50
having and they have lots of photographs
26:52
up all over the place
26:53
and almost all of the photographs were
26:55
just of this person's hand
26:58
so this was a funeral of that character
27:00
from the adams family
27:04
there was another one where a clown had
27:06
died and the person was buried in full
27:08
clown costume the whole family were
27:10
clowns all the friends were clowns and
27:12
at the family's request the funeral
27:13
directors had to dress up as clowns as
27:15
well
27:16
didn't the shoes not fit in the coffin
27:20
they put him in the coffin and all the
27:21
sides fell out
27:24
[Applause]
27:26
okay and the final effect is my fact
27:29
this week and it is that
27:30
henry viii had two official cradle
27:33
rockers who were paid
27:34
three pounds a year each to rock his
27:36
cradle i should stress this is when he
27:38
was a baby
27:39
i had a great image in my head before
27:40
you told me that
27:42
three pounds a year would have been a
27:43
lot in those days presumably it would
27:45
have been more
27:46
but not a huge amount and also my
27:48
question is
27:49
did they go in shifts or did they need
27:52
two people to rock one cradle
27:54
well his cradle was massive um it was
27:57
five feet long
27:58
and two feet wide and this is the
27:59
rocking one as well this isn't just a
28:00
crib for a baby this is an actual
28:02
rocking cradle
28:03
um suspended from a wooden canvas
28:05
covered with crimson cloth of gold and
28:07
trimmed with ermin
28:08
and it was ridiculous nice it was henry
28:11
viii
28:11
he went in well not at the time it was
28:13
just a small baby at the time
28:15
his daughter was it mary the first had
28:16
even she had four cradle orcas
28:18
four yeah and she had two cribs as well
28:20
she had an everyday cradle which was
28:21
silver and gold i think and then a
28:23
cradle of estate for special occasions
28:25
for receiving visitors
28:26
the current queen has 733 credits
28:31
it just goes up every time because they
28:32
want to out do that
28:35
um edward vi uh was was given a baby
28:38
replica of a court when he was
28:39
not yet one year old he had a
28:40
chamberlain a vice chamberlain a steward
28:42
a cofferer lots of other stuff
28:44
they were they were sorry they weren't
28:46
other babies
28:48
that's a fantastic idea brilliant yeah
28:52
that that's the most adorable thing i
28:54
can think of
28:56
they're all dressed as there's a little
28:58
thomas cramer baby and there's a wallsy
29:00
baby
29:00
that's how i imagine little cbeebies is
29:03
wrong
29:05
um no so and when henry viii's first son
29:08
was born he henry appointed him 40 staff
29:11
immediately including a baker and the
29:13
keeper of the cellar for some reason
29:15
it would be brilliant if they were
29:16
babies as well that wasn't it i just
29:18
love this idea of just a community of
29:20
babies looking after
29:21
like a tiny maybe a miniature buckingham
29:23
palace this is the muppet babies of the
29:25
tudor court
29:26
i like it they didn't call themselves
29:28
tudor did they didn't like that
29:30
no what is that it reminded them of
29:32
their welsh
29:33
background tudor and they didn't like
29:35
that henry viii
29:36
referred to himself as the embodiment of
29:38
the union of the families of lancaster
29:40
and york
29:41
rather than tudor tudor snappier isn't
29:43
it it is snappy it was like
29:45
like 100 200 years afterwards when it
29:47
became more common
29:48
um moving down the line a little bit
29:50
queen victoria
29:52
well i basically think she sounds like
29:53
she had a phobia of babies she did she
29:55
described them as rather disgusting
29:57
um she described her own babies as
29:58
froglike and frightful went undressed
30:02
and she had nine yeah um
30:07
she when she was a baby her father
30:10
described her as
30:12
as plump as a partridge and more a
30:14
pocket hercules in a pocket venus i
30:16
think she was quite a fat baby
30:18
hercules supposedly killed two snakes in
30:20
his crib
30:21
oh yeah yeah he did uh some vengeful
30:24
goddess um released them towards him
30:26
didn't he he smashed them together is
30:27
that where the rattle was invented
30:29
yes he killed the snake so they were
30:31
rattled and then he turned around
30:34
and someone was like if i take out the
30:35
snake aspect of this it would make a
30:37
great toy
30:37
but queen victoria named victoria very
30:40
controversial victoria wasn't really a
30:41
name in britain at the time was it
30:43
not a girl's name and she was named
30:45
after her mother who was german a lot of
30:47
politicians and men at court tried to
30:49
make her change her name when she was
30:50
going to exceed to the throne
30:51
something more conventional so i think
30:53
elizabeth was suggested originally
30:55
um when the queen gave birth to prince
30:58
charles uh
30:59
prince philip was playing squash at the
31:00
time yep
31:02
did he leave the game no the queen's in
31:04
labor for 30 hours but he he
31:06
played one game of squash people have
31:08
been tired at the end of that
31:09
someone was taking care of him well he
31:12
just comes and goes oh i'm exhausted
31:14
what a day it's been how was your day um
31:18
do you know swaddling yeah which is
31:19
where you just restrict babies very
31:22
tightly in their movements for the first
31:23
few months of their life it's incredible
31:24
that this happened and that we
31:26
still happens around the world i think
31:27
yeah to simulate womb environment is
31:29
that right
31:30
i don't know and they used this used to
31:32
happen babies who were in their
31:34
swaddling clothes um would sometimes be
31:37
um hung up from a nail on the wall which
31:40
was to give their care so you just sort
31:42
of loop a bit of the swaddling over a
31:43
nail on the wall and the baby would just
31:45
be entertained by its surroundings this
31:47
is according to the victorian album
31:48
museum
31:48
to give their carers a rest and to
31:50
entertain them with the surrounding
31:51
environment
31:53
like a ball that's a really funny idea
31:55
like a wall-mounted baby
31:56
it'd be good if you had like sex tuplets
31:58
and they were just hanging up around the
32:00
hole yeah or you could put them like
32:01
plaster ducks you could put them going
32:03
up in a diagonal line
32:04
[Laughter]
32:06
it was phased out i think it was widely
32:08
perceived as being bad for the baby's
32:10
health
32:11
obviously um
32:14
um cradles and cots um
32:17
the first in fact actually i was looking
32:19
into cradles and quartz and i started
32:20
accidentally looking into prams
32:22
but the first pram was invented in 1733
32:25
and it was made to be pulled along so it
32:27
was like a small pram and it had a
32:29
harness so it could be pulled along by a
32:30
goat or a dog
32:32
that's adorable imagine a mini henry
32:34
viii baby being pulled along by a dog
32:37
a dog and the goats who are best friends
32:39
oh god the disney film rides itself
32:43
but pram is short for prambulator yeah
32:46
but there was no one walking i guess
32:48
that's true it was being pulled by now
32:50
the dog and the goat would have been
32:51
walking
32:52
yeah um walking into our hearts
32:55
oh jesus um they called the first prams
32:57
um that when pram started becoming
32:59
popular in the mid
33:00
19th century i think they were called
33:01
male carts because they were based on
33:02
design for male cuts when you just push
33:05
like big packages along and because
33:06
female babies weren't allowed in them
33:10
i read that there's one book i've read
33:13
this in and i can't find it verified but
33:14
children's cuts were initially used to
33:16
be bassinets which would just sit on the
33:17
floor and then they were raised off the
33:19
floor due to a perception that there
33:20
were
33:21
noxious fumes that existed below knee
33:23
level and explosive vapors that existed
33:25
near the ceiling
33:26
and that the middle air of a room was
33:28
the healthier you had to breathe
33:30
technically isn't that true because
33:31
oxygen is flowerable so we near the top
33:34
and carbon dioxide
33:35
is it's the gas in the room just moves
33:37
around too much
33:38
yeah it was a very still room they were
33:40
onto the right idea
33:42
and we're killing our babies by leaving
33:43
them on the floor um
33:45
it's very unusual putting babies in
33:46
cradles having them sleeping cradles and
33:48
cots and stuff in most parts of the
33:49
world it's really weird that we do that
33:50
um yeah like vast majority of countries
33:53
i think it's pretty much unheard of and
33:54
babies just sleep with their parents
33:56
parents used to not really worry about
33:57
washing their babies too much either oh
33:59
yeah mothers in medieval times
34:01
would dry nappies rather than wash them
34:03
and in the book i was reading about this
34:05
a history of childhood this was because
34:07
of
34:07
the healing powers of urine and in bits
34:10
of france
34:11
uh people thought that if you washed a
34:12
child's head you would make it
34:14
simple-minded
34:15
and if you cut its nails and hair before
34:17
it was a year and a day old
34:19
it would be respectively mute and a
34:20
thief
34:22
being mute is good if you're a thief
34:23
because you make less noise
34:26
okay here's a thief now so we might as
34:28
well make sure as well
34:30
please make sure okay cut his nails then
34:34
yeah extraordinary can i just do one
34:36
thing about an
34:37
unusual job that i read today okay so i
34:39
was reading a book earlier on it's
34:41
called sex on earth
34:46
sorry they were talking about the way
34:48
that horses have sex um specifically
34:50
instead um so
34:51
they have a stallion will come in and
34:53
have sex with uh with a female horse
34:56
uh and they were explaining how this
34:58
happens and there is a guy
35:00
who's one and only job is to hold the
35:02
base of the stallion's penis
35:04
while it is in the mayor's vagina and
35:07
his job
35:08
is to feel for the tell-tale throbbing
35:10
of ejaculation
35:12
so that he knows when it's finished why
35:14
does he need to know
35:16
right so they can stop there stop the
35:19
act
35:20
surely surely it stops anyway that's
35:22
much of a hurry that means
35:24
right the useful bit's over i'm gonna
35:26
say it's a brilliant book it's by uh
35:27
jules howard it's absolutely okay but
35:29
that's presumably why
35:30
in nature you see a lot of um skeletons
35:33
of horses which have just died because
35:34
they didn't know when to stop having sex
35:39
imagine how the stallion feels during
35:42
all that
35:43
embarrassed i presume i don't know if i
35:46
would if a horse turned up
35:48
and started holding the legs
35:52
did you just say i'm a stallion in bed
35:54
no i said there's a stallion
36:00

36:02

hello everybody and welcome to another
00:55
episode of no such thing as a fish a qi
00:58
podcast coming to you
00:59
from our offices here in covent garden
01:02
uh dan schreiber is still away but we
01:04
are working on the pronunciation
01:05
my name is andrew murray and i'm here
01:07
with three of the other qils they are
01:09
anne miller james harkin and anna
01:11
tajinski
01:12
and we have gathered around the
01:13
microphones to bring you our four
01:15
favorite facts
01:16
from the last seven days and then a lot
01:17
of other facts we found out off the back
01:19
of those
01:23
so let's get going the first fact of
01:25
today is
01:26
anna my fact is that from the year 800
01:30
to the year 1349 the coliseum was used
01:33
as an apartment block
01:34
really yeah um but yeah we only
01:36
discovered this a couple of years ago a
01:38
bunch of archaeology was done at the
01:39
coliseum
01:40
and they excavated it and they
01:42
discovered things like sewage pipes
01:44
and that is evidence that it used to be
01:47
a block of flats and we know it was
01:48
owned it was bought
01:49
by monks and then they would rent it out
01:52
to
01:52
normal people who would take a flat
01:54
there that's good that's what happened
01:56
and the community so the space where
01:57
they all did all the fighting in the
01:58
back in the ancient world was a communal
02:01
living space where they'd
02:02
um have their market space or where they
02:05
graze their animals or they just hang
02:06
out have a barbecue have a barbie
02:09
over sunday afternoon yeah it was used
02:11
for a lot of things wasn't it it wasn't
02:12
just an apartment block once it had
02:13
fallen into disrepair i read that
02:15
it was used for lots of uh trades like
02:18
cobblers and
02:19
uh blacksmiths and also glue makers and
02:22
also
02:22
a fortress for 12th century warlords
02:24
called the frangipani
02:27
almond paste yeah they that was their
02:29
main weapon of choice i think
02:31
they just smothered people with
02:32
delicious delicious comestables i think
02:35
it was used as a dumping ground so
02:36
between when
02:37
uh all the visual sports were banned
02:39
there in the fifth century and when it
02:41
was brought up by these monks
02:43
about 500 years later it was used as
02:45
just a garbage dump where everyone
02:47
dumped their old
02:48
detritus i mean i guess if you've got a
02:49
big story center you might as well put
02:51
stuff in it
02:51
yeah it's weird though they obviously
02:53
didn't have much respect for this
02:54
amazing
02:55
edifice i think that happens in general
02:57
around the world doesn't it like
02:58
something will go slightly into
03:00
disrepair and then people will just
03:01
steal bits of it to build their own
03:03
houses and yeah
03:04
whatever you use what you can don't you
03:06
yeah there's actually instant andrews we
03:08
have so quite a lot of contenders
03:09
there's
03:10
places to visit blue down because it's
03:11
quite a windy place so the castle blew
03:13
down
03:13
your blue castle blue they shouldn't
03:15
they should have made that straw
03:18
the cathedral blew down they built it
03:19
back it blew down again but they've got
03:20
this um
03:21
room of all the sort of bits they found
03:22
around the town and there's one bit this
03:24
statue that would be on top of a tomb
03:26
and they found that used to make
03:27
someone's windowsill on one of the
03:28
town's streets
03:30
and they found they're like hang on this
03:31
belongs to the cathedral and then take
03:32
it back so they didn't call the
03:33
colosseum the colosseum did they
03:35
no that's a medieval name for it they
03:37
called it the
03:38
flavian amphitheater and also the name
03:41
coliseum comes from
03:42
a word for big but it's not because
03:45
that's big it's because it's next to
03:46
another statue which happened to be big
03:48
really but there was a huge statue of
03:50
nero nearby
03:52
and that was so big that it the area
03:54
became known as the big
03:55
statue place that's great the pantheon
03:58
burnt down twice so the pantheon the
04:01
inscription on it reads
04:03
marcus agrippa son of lucius console for
04:05
the third time built this when actually
04:07
he died about 100 years before it was
04:09
built because he built the initial one
04:11
but it just kept burning down
04:12
he shouldn't have made it out of sticks
04:14
people are building materials
04:16
james harkin is available for
04:17
architectural consultancy
04:19
to any little pigs listening um
04:22
so in the coliseum itself when you're
04:24
having games there the person who
04:25
organized and paid for the games was
04:27
called the editor
04:28
which i did not know that's rather nice
04:31
so he was selecting who played or
04:33
was he well i think he definitely got to
04:35
choose who lived and who died
04:37
so obviously no it's fake if it's
04:39
someone who decides who like lives and
04:41
who dies that means it's kind of fixed a
04:43
bit like wwf wrestling
04:45
yeah doesn't it really same old stuff do
04:47
you think people complained about that a
04:48
lot and there was a genuine wrestling
04:50
place around the corner
04:53
yeah these guys are really injured well
04:56
greco-roman wrestling
04:57
um is not from greece or rome it's from
05:00
france
05:01
great france yeah it's invented in
05:03
france and they gave it the name because
05:04
they thought it was probably similar
05:06
to what they did in in classical times
05:08
that's
05:10
oh a couple hundred years ago oh okay
05:13
okay
05:13
it was based on um like uh there's a
05:16
french wrestling
05:17
um oh gosh i wish i could remember what
05:19
it's called i think it's called savat
05:20
or something and it's what happens is
05:23
you
05:24
kind of crouch down um like a crab
05:27
and then you kick people like that and
05:29
it was done on
05:30
ships and because the ships rock all the
05:32
time you had to hold on to like a bar so
05:34
you didn't fall over
05:35
and so you do all your wrestling with
05:37
your feet now this is all coming from
05:39
memory systems might
05:40
all be completely wrong it's like you're
05:41
shin kicking yeah
05:43
but that was they were in barrels they
05:44
couldn't fall over i don't understand
05:46
how big the barrel must be for you to
05:48
get two of you in it kicking each other
05:50
well if it's like once they make whiskey
05:52
in like for 40 years they're pretty big
05:54
aren't they yeah i suppose so yeah but
05:55
then also there's no fun for any
05:56
contestants unless you have a
05:57
see-through barrel
05:59
it's like having a football match where
06:00
you can't you can only see
06:02
the waist up of all the players well
06:04
maybe you're looking down into it well
06:06
diogenes lived in a barrel
06:08
so they must be quite big he didn't have
06:09
people around much
06:10
[Laughter]
06:12
barbecues your blades are mine i think
06:15
mine again
06:16
if that's okay
06:20
uh this is another thing i learned about
06:22
this week about
06:24
the greeks the ancient greeks used to
06:26
paint obscene pictures on the inside of
06:28
their drinking vessels of their wine
06:30
glasses and then they would reveal
06:31
themselves to you as you drunk
06:33
so there's you know pictures of a man
06:35
and then his willy is in the bottom of
06:36
the glass and as you drink it
06:40
[Laughter]
06:43
um wow that's that's amazing it's not
06:46
yeah so
06:46
i used to have a pen like that they made
06:49
those pens where you turn them upside
06:51
down and a picture is either rude or
06:52
normal depending on i'm just imagining
06:54
someone coming around going i'm going to
06:56
read your tea leaves
06:57
oh my god
06:58
[Laughter]
07:00
and also they used to paint um eyes on
07:03
the
07:04
bottom of the glasses like on the
07:05
outside on the bottom of their glasses
07:06
so that when you drank it look like you
07:07
were wearing a mask
07:09
see they're making a cumber i put my
07:10
brother um party cup so they got novelty
07:12
noses so when you drink you get like a
07:14
beak or a pig smell or
07:16
honestly two thousand years too late
07:17
that's right came from the greeks
07:19
um i read a thing about the colosseum as
07:21
well which is that in the 1500s
07:23
inspired by the previous people who
07:24
lived in the coliseum pope sixtus the
07:26
fifth wanted to turn it into a wool
07:27
factory so the factory be on the ground
07:29
floor and then living quarters on the
07:30
top
07:31
but he died and they ran out of money
07:32
and didn't get made i like sixth as the
07:34
fifth
07:35
yeah yeah was there a sixth of the sixth
07:38
i can't even say that it's too much of a
07:39
tongue twister that's why
07:41
he was actually the sixth he just had to
07:43
say he was the fifth because no one
07:44
could pronounce the sixth the sixth
07:46
fourth sixth the fifth sixth the seventh
07:49
roman concrete is quite interesting the
07:52
material that they made
07:53
the coliseum out of in that we don't
07:56
know how it's lasted so long and we've
07:58
sort of lost
07:59
the exact formula for roman concrete and
08:02
how they made it
08:02
so the concrete that we use now is
08:04
stronger than what the colosseum is made
08:05
out of
08:06
but it wouldn't last nearly as long it
08:07
erodes much faster and they think it's
08:09
because it uses a lot of volcanic ash
08:11
and that's much harder to erode
08:13
and then they also used animal fat and
08:15
milk and blood
08:16
to kind of adhere it together didn't
08:18
they i guess the colosseum had fur
08:19
supplies
08:21
scuba diving that's amazing yeah quite
08:24
cool
08:25
and oh this is cool in ancient china
08:28
they used to use sticky rice as a
08:29
building material
08:31
but to stick stuff together in their
08:33
their concrete equivalent
08:34
did it work yeah worked really well
08:35
they're still standing
08:37
still standing if you think about it
08:38
though if you have like a chinese
08:40
takeaway
08:41
and then the day after it's on a plate
08:43
and the rice is still on the plate it's
08:45
pretty hard to get off it sticks a lot
08:46
yeah
08:47
on the coliseum just a couple of things
08:49
i thought you might like
08:50
um so two american tourists chipped off
08:52
a bit of the colosseum in rome and they
08:54
later returned it
08:55
but they returned it 25 years later in
08:58
2009 they felt really bad about it every
09:00
time they looked at it in their
09:01
collection of
09:02
things things they've stolen from
09:04
landmarks yeah
09:05
do you know that um people often steal
09:08
uh bits of uluru
09:09
which is asrock oh yeah but they almost
09:12
always send it back
09:14
and they get these very often they get
09:15
these bits of uluru sent through the
09:17
post
09:18
to the um national park and the reason
09:20
is because people steal it and then they
09:22
have some bad luck and they always blame
09:24
it on the fact that they stole this from
09:26
um as rock and so they always send it
09:28
back um you know there's gladiator guys
09:29
who hang around outside it
09:31
asking tourists if they want to have
09:32
their photo wolf and shadow and
09:34
yeah um so i love this story
09:38
italian police arrested 20 of them
09:40
recently in an undercover operation
09:42
because they were intimidating all the
09:44
rival gladiators and being physically
09:46
aggressive with them
09:47
yes that was brilliant how did they
09:48
arrest them with like a net and a
09:50
sticker that's the thing some police
09:53
officers had to dress as gladiators
09:55
to get evidence of them being
09:56
intimidating and then they took down the
09:59
i just think it's the funniest story
10:00
it's an elaborate sting operation yeah
10:02
arresting them for being aggressive when
10:04
they are dressed as gladiators
10:06
arresting them for fighting each other
10:07
as well yeah yeah i think they get in
10:09
trouble because
10:10
they'd sort of say i'll pose for a
10:11
picture then like demand 30 euros or
10:12
something there's another story
10:14
some of the rogue ones would like take
10:15
your camera and wouldn't give it back
10:16
until you paid them a certain amount of
10:17
money
10:18
because they need to pay for their
10:19
freedom otherwise they'll be gladiators
10:21
for life
10:22
and that's no life they used to dye the
10:25
sand
10:26
in the colosseum red didn't they to make
10:27
it blend in with all the blood
10:29
no yeah how's the diet i'm not sure
10:34
yeah the hot the walls were made out of
10:35
blood and animal fats and whatever
10:37
yeah i think there's not enough blood in
10:39
this area
10:40
okay some what about some unusual places
10:43
to live
10:44
yeah yeah there was a guy in morocco
10:47
called
10:47
as a adinae old baja
10:50
and he and his family listed city
10:52
toilets as their official address
10:55
so they were living in in a toilet block
10:57
fed up with his situation he went to his
10:58
local newspaper to tell his story
11:00
um but then the local authorities read
11:02
the article and then blocked up the
11:04
toilet's entrance
11:05
with cement and concrete so he couldn't
11:07
live there anymore
11:09
wasn't that the saddest story you've
11:10
ever heard was he was he going from
11:12
stall to stall
11:14
did he have a a bedroom stall and a
11:16
living room stall
11:17
and a library store and a bathroom
11:22
does anyone have anything else oh i just
11:23
had that one just unused unusual housing
11:25
that store that did
11:26
the rounds a while ago about a woman he
11:28
was found living in a man's cupboard in
11:29
japan
11:30
and he only found out when food started
11:31
vanishing from his fridge and then he
11:33
set up cameras and she
11:34
yeah moved into his cupboard what yeah
11:36
japanese homes are quite small
11:38
yeah it's quite noticeable it's
11:39
described as a cubbyhole recovered area
11:41
and she said she's been there for a year
11:42
but only on and off
11:44
oh my god i know that's so creepy if you
11:46
have coverage you don't go into just
11:47
check them every now and again
11:48
to then cement her covered up
11:52
[Music]
11:54
okay guys let's move on to fact number
11:56
two which this week comes from
11:57
james okay my fact this week is that
12:00
you can be fined for swearing in
12:02
australia and in the last financial year
12:05
people in australia's northern territory
12:08
uh paid
12:09
forty eight thousand three hundred and
12:10
seventy two dollars in fines
12:13
off captain predictable
12:16
why are people being fined for swearing
12:18
yeah i mean it's actually been against
12:20
the law
12:20
in lots of different countries at
12:22
different times yeah it's
12:24
illegal in this country to use
12:26
threatening
12:27
insulting or abusive behavior um
12:30
especially against police but that's not
12:33
necessarily swearing you could still
12:35
swear and not be
12:36
abusive and you've got your tongue and
12:38
away with it yeah he said banana in a
12:40
really menacing way you probably get in
12:41
trouble
12:42
we told someone quite friendly when
12:45
australia
12:45
introduced this law there were lots of
12:47
uh sweary protests and one of them was
12:49
called
12:50
the walk um and i found a quotation
12:53
from it which was from a green mp in the
12:55
victoria state
12:56
parliament called colleen heartland she
12:58
said
12:59
is farty pooh bum a swear word is
13:03
windy bottom sweater yeah it's a very
13:05
valid point because you can just say
13:07
very very mild things but it's all about
13:09
the intent as you say
13:10
yeah the banana so i read this fact on
13:13
a website called nothing to do with our
13:15
growth it's a blog of
13:17
weird kind of news from around the world
13:19
uh and
13:20
in the article that i read um they had
13:22
an interview with local man jack bullon
13:24
who said i find those words slip into my
13:26
vocabulary even when they shouldn't
13:29
i think the heat contributes to people
13:30
being more aggressive but swearing
13:32
isn't really a sign of aggression it's
13:34
more of a communication tool
13:36
mr bullon has since lost his job at the
13:38
primary school
13:40
and then the um the article goes on some
13:42
residents said
13:43
they had no idea letting loose a
13:45
foul-mouthed tirade could cost them a
13:47
fine
13:47
others just didn't give a
13:52
it's been it's gone back for centuries
13:53
being fined for swearing oh yeah dates
13:55
back to the
13:56
18th century i think no 17th century
13:58
civil war yeah
14:00
um and this is quite interesting the
14:03
the fines that you got varied according
14:05
to your social class
14:06
so the profane oaths act of 1745 you got
14:09
fined
14:10
five shillings if you were a gentleman
14:12
or above
14:13
uh two shillings if you were below that
14:15
and only one shilling if you were
14:16
a day worker or a common soldier or a
14:18
sailor or something like that so really
14:20
so it was worse if you were well bred to
14:22
be
14:22
it's yeah that was the idea or it could
14:24
be just that you could afford
14:26
more so like um is it in sweden where
14:29
you're
14:30
driving fine depends on how much you
14:32
earn yeah
14:33
oh that's smart so it means tested
14:35
finding um in sydney
14:36
you can get the fine went up a couple of
14:38
years ago for swearing from 150
14:40
to 500 dollars wow but the worst thing
14:43
is
14:44
as soon as you get fined and they tell
14:45
you that you swear again
14:48
double fine um i was reading this
14:50
brilliant book um
14:51
except from a book online about um
14:53
history of swearing and said that so in
14:54
the original oed which is 1888
14:56
they described bloody as like the worst
14:58
most terrible word but being victoria
15:00
they didn't list the f and the seas
15:02
so bloody was the worst word they could
15:04
put in the oed
15:05
so this is just this is the worst of the
15:07
the ones that were the ones that we'll
15:08
list
15:09
but then it's better so there's another
15:10
book which is um in 1785 the classical
15:13
dictionary of the vulgar tongue
15:14
included the word huffle which was too
15:16
filthy for explanation
15:18
and in a later book there's another book
15:19
that wouldn't describe what bagpiping
15:21
was
15:21
what is bagpiping i think they were both
15:24
um for fallacious the victorians were
15:25
not impressed
15:26
but huffling and bagpiping huffles is
15:28
that where jake really got hufflepuff
15:30
from
15:30
i hope so they were originally called
15:33
house fellatio but
15:35
actually fellatio does sound like a
15:37
magic word
15:42
i don't know what would happen i think i
15:44
do
15:45
[Laughter]
15:49
so but bloody was was really bad wasn't
15:51
it yeah and
15:52
was when pygmalion came out and eliza
15:54
doolittle said the word bloody there was
15:56
like a big scandal about it and then
15:58
people so eliza do eliza did a little in
16:00
pygmalion uh
16:01
said walk not bloody likely in this posh
16:04
voice and there was
16:06
uh the quote is the first night's
16:07
audience greeted the word with a few
16:10
seconds of stunned
16:11
disbelieving silence and then hysterical
16:13
laughter for at least a minute and a
16:14
quarter
16:17
i think it's so nice these stories of
16:19
when swear words weren't as bad i think
16:21
we've kind of missed out on words of
16:24
really really uncommon unless you're a
16:25
soldier or a sailor or something
16:27
yeah yeah maybe there are words and we
16:28
just don't know them huffling
16:30
yeah the army has new top secret swear
16:33
words
16:34
yeah so yes swearing was the worst in
16:36
medieval times wasn't it
16:37
and because they were always blasphemous
16:40
oh yeah blasphemy was obviously a
16:41
terrible thing and you could
16:43
i think you could be killed for it yeah
16:45
probably
16:46
um but they used to think that swearing
16:48
would physically hurt like blasphemy
16:50
would physically hurt jesus christ
16:51
so the worst thing you could possibly
16:53
say was jesus christ nails
16:55
and that was absolutely horrific and
16:56
that's because you visit he's up in
16:57
heaven and you physically hurt him every
16:59
time you say that
17:00
um or if you say by christ's blood then
17:03
you know i don't know he bleeds
17:04
yeah i think that's where bloody comes
17:06
from isn't it from the blood of christ
17:07
probably i think so
17:09
sounds come from comes from the phrase
17:11
god's wounds sorry sorry what what's
17:13
this swear word that you're telling us
17:16
you must have heard it before oh yeah
17:17
we've heard it but you say it as though
17:19
it says
17:19
standard parliament so whatever the
17:21
zoinks yeah zones like in uh
17:23
in scooby-doo yeah yeah well that yeah
17:26
that's probably a palliative version of
17:28
um
17:28
of sounds so these are these what's
17:30
called minced oats yeah
17:32
um so all right good zucks
17:36
have you heard the word god's hooks no
17:38
yeah it's
17:39
okay it's another old school swear word
17:40
and it was yeah exactly by god's hooks
17:43
yeah
17:43
and that could be where zikes comes from
17:45
then godzilla's
17:46
yeah yeah yeah i think it might be and
17:48
so it's a minced oath of a minced oath
17:50
itself yeah
17:51
and there were things like uh slid which
17:53
was from the
17:54
late uh 16th century which was by god's
17:57
eyelid
17:58
really split by god's foot they're just
18:01
taking all his body parts right
18:03
about 0.7 of the words we use
18:06
are swear words which doesn't sound like
18:08
very much but apparently that's the same
18:10
as
18:10
pronouns so we swear on average as much
18:14
as we're saying like your or our or
18:16
ourselves
18:17
a lot it is quite seven percent i don't
18:19
even know if they're including sounds
18:23
[Applause]
18:23
[Music]
18:25
okay time for fact number three which is
18:27
my one this week and it is
18:29
that when the first transatlantic cable
18:31
was laid in 1858 the reception on it was
18:34
so bad that it took
18:34
17 hours to send the first message
18:37
across
18:38
wow yeah similar to our wi-fi
18:42
was it an urgent message there's a
18:43
message from queen victoria to president
18:45
buchanan urgent probably not but
18:48
it depends it was a 98 worder to be fair
18:51
so it was longer than your average text
18:52
are there any swear words in there
18:54
there were i mean there's fervently uh
18:56
reciprocal
18:58
and pleasure but thanks for you yes so
19:00
wait a minute
19:01
the queen sent a message to the
19:03
president about reciprocal pleasure
19:06
it was the first sext i think we believe
19:08
um
19:09
the the friendship is founded on their
19:11
common interests and reciprocal esteem
19:13
the queen has much pleasure in thus
19:14
directly communicating with the
19:15
president a lot of internationalist
19:16
flannels
19:17
the first time they could communicate
19:18
directly over 17 hours yeah but that is
19:20
i mean before that it would have taken
19:22
something like 12 days to get a message
19:23
across so it was an incredible
19:24
achievement yeah but
19:26
the story of how they installed the
19:27
first cable is just i mean it's
19:28
unbelievable
19:29
they had one across the english channel
19:31
that was the first one and this was
19:32
after
19:33
decades of people just testing it out in
19:35
ponds and things like that
19:37
so the first tests were just people with
19:38
their garden ponds they just put a load
19:40
of cable in the pond and see it saw if
19:41
they could get a message from one end to
19:42
the other
19:43
and they could i know that there was a
19:44
whale scare in that laying of the first
19:46
one
19:46
uh they wrote that they saw a whale
19:48
swimming over the cable and they thought
19:50
oh my god it's going to ruin it and then
19:52
it brushed up against it and so i'm on
19:53
its way
19:54
so wow but it was quite rubbish wasn't
19:56
it the reception wasn't good for the one
19:58
you're talking about the first one
19:59
because it just wasn't successful so it
20:00
was broken within
20:01
a month i think by this guy called wild
20:04
man white house
20:05
who applied excessive voltage to it
20:07
trying to get the signal better i guess
20:08
and trying to make it take less than 17
20:10
hours
20:10
his his full name is amazing it was
20:12
edward orange wildman white house
20:14
yeah and actually that the victoria one
20:16
wasn't the very first message
20:17
the very first ever transatlantic
20:19
message read laws
20:20
white house received five minutes signal
20:22
coil signal's too weak to relay
20:24
try drive slow and regular i have put
20:26
intermediate pulley reply by coils
20:30
it is always like the first telegraph
20:31
was supposedly what god hath wrought and
20:33
actually it wasn't it was telegraph test
20:35
yeah yeah exactly yeah and the first
20:37
words on the moon was supposed to be
20:39
uh one small step but actually it was
20:40
contact light yeah yeah
20:43
um oh but you know the alexander graham
20:44
bell thing oh yeah um
20:46
so 40 years after that first seminal
20:49
phone call that was the first ever
20:50
transcontinental
20:51
phone call which went from boston to
20:55
san francisco um and they tested it
20:57
several months before so it wasn't the
20:58
first actual contact but they did a
21:00
ceremony where alexander graham bell
21:02
and watson spoke by telephone to each
21:05
other over the same connection and they
21:06
did a reprise of the original
21:08
conversation
21:09
so he said mr watson come here i want
21:12
you
21:13
and then watson replied it would take me
21:15
a week to get to you this time
21:17
isn't that cool mr watson come here i
21:18
want you i think that was the first sex
21:20
thing
21:21
[Laughter]
21:23
that was the first booty call yeah so
21:26
the first time they used cables
21:27
in a telephone conversation um between
21:30
the us
21:31
and britain was in 1927
21:34
and the guardian has quite a funny
21:36
description of it so
21:38
it relays the conversation we don't know
21:39
who took part in this conversation but
21:41
the guardian says conversation
21:42
conversationalists quite unordered by
21:44
the marvel in which they were taking
21:46
part
21:46
fell back as we all do on the weather
21:48
which was quite bad enough on either
21:49
side to make a strong bond of sympathy
21:51
indeed a more pleasantly futile dialogue
21:53
could hardly have taken place over a
21:55
suburban party wall in dullich or
21:57
trulton come hardy
21:59
and that which so astonishingly bridged
22:01
the ocean this is quite interesting
22:02
though actually
22:03
only one unusual item of small talk
22:05
broke its commonplace flow
22:07
and we may take it that in trans-oceanic
22:09
gossiping
22:10
what's the time with you has come to
22:12
stay as an addition of conversation
22:14
suddenly the idea of a time difference
22:15
which had never been considered before
22:17
yeah became a thing it would be like
22:19
what is a different time of day
22:21
hadn't crossed my mind and people are
22:22
apparently astonished by this but still
22:24
now if you ring people up in another
22:25
country
22:26
it's like what time is it there exactly
22:27
so that was quite a good prediction
22:28
wasn't it
22:29
i've been out for ages i still find it
22:30
amazing that most of the internet is
22:32
going around the world in undersea
22:34
cables yeah yeah it's really odd
22:37
yeah there are nearly 300 communications
22:40
cables under the sea
22:41
around the world and they're these vast
22:43
things and
22:44
lots of them are not even on there are
22:46
20 which are not yet in use which are
22:47
called dark cables
22:49
and eventually they will be in use if
22:50
our bandwidth increases and they cost
22:52
hundreds of millions of dollars and
22:54
um when the first so the first message
22:56
that was sent over the arpanet
22:58
which was like the precursor to the
23:00
internet it was where the internet
23:01
started
23:02
um it was in 1969 do you know what the
23:04
message was what time is it with you
23:06
yeah it was not that was it
23:09
balls
23:13
was it login it wasn't even it was well
23:15
it wasn't logan it was supposed to be
23:16
because that was the first command they
23:18
were giving but the system broke down
23:19
after two letters so it was just
23:21
hello how do you know he was going to
23:23
say logan he might be trying to say lol
23:25
yeah first message well i don't think he
23:27
should have admitted that it was wrong
23:29
because low could have just been
23:30
low you know you you are familiar with
23:33
like really old-school words that no one
23:34
uses anymore godzilla
23:37
you say low all the time right no we're
23:39
out of tea
23:41
what do you mean what i'm like around
23:44
the office
23:45
what he means is the level of tea is
23:49
we need to get low supplies um um the
23:51
guy who sent the first email doesn't
23:53
remember what it says
23:54
oh no really i bet he does but he's
23:57
embarrassed
23:57
i think he wrote something embarrassing
23:59
about a colleague and accidentally sent
24:01
it to the colleague
24:02
and he doesn't want anybody to know i
24:04
think dave is an ass
24:06
but at that time there's only two email
24:07
addresses his days
24:10
dave's like come on the second email was
24:12
dear dave
24:13
i think there may have been a bit of a
24:15
mistake
24:17
uh i was talking of course about dave in
24:20
accounts
24:22
yeah i just i just think people should
24:23
plan this i was thinking about this
24:24
because we talk about the first text of
24:25
the phone calls and the cables and
24:27
you should plan if you're sending the
24:28
first email make sure it's something
24:30
funny
24:30
or weird or that people are going to be
24:32
writing down history books and repeating
24:34
on podcasts
24:35
with its equivalent of like you know if
24:37
you meet someone you become your best
24:38
friend or your
24:39
you know your other half and you don't
24:40
know so you don't you don't say
24:41
something profound you say like
24:43
i say something profound to every single
24:45
woman i meet
24:46
just in case they think about that story
24:48
for the wedding like well actually we
24:49
said something lovely
24:50
i am married so yeah it worked
24:53
eventually
24:56
okay time for fact number four which
24:58
comes from and yes
25:00
um last year to celebrate world vegan
25:02
day peter the animal charity
25:03
asked fry up in yorkshire to change its
25:05
name to vegan fry up
25:07
and did they do that no
25:10
it was a fair offer peter did say they
25:11
only had to do it for one day and if
25:12
they did so they provide the
25:14
whole town village um with a free vegan
25:16
breakfast vegan sausages and vegan bacon
25:18
which really pleasingly is called faken
25:20
uh town didn't go for the offer uh one
25:22
of the counsellors said first of all
25:24
there's not really anyone in charge of
25:25
the town's name so we're quite hard to
25:26
get everyone to agree
25:27
um and that they're not named after an
25:28
actual fry up after the goddess
25:30
figure whose anglo-saxon people yeah
25:32
yeah after whom friday is named yes
25:35
not the breakfast it really is an
25:36
indictment of veganism isn't it though
25:38
when an entire village
25:39
says they're not willing to change their
25:41
name for one day to all get a free vegan
25:44
fry up
25:45
people do not want vegan friends
25:48
no matter how much bacon you put in them
25:49
um yeah great fry up it's not a very
25:52
exciting place
25:53
i tried to find exciting place called
25:55
little fry up nearby
25:56
there is next to it that's even smaller
25:58
and i think and less exciting it has no
26:00
shops not even a pub according to
26:01
wikipedia it has a telephone box a post
26:03
box a village hall
26:05
and an outdoor center and it also has a
26:07
local cricket pitch and a coits pitch
26:09
and i think if you're having to claim
26:12
brag about your coits pitch
26:13
but i like the idea of there being a
26:15
great fry up and a little freya
26:17
because it's like an option for
26:18
breakfast isn't it
26:20
well you only get one sausage for this
26:21
one yeah all the health conscious people
26:24
live in little fry up
26:25
yeah um i do read about give you this
26:26
horrible thing as a cafe and great
26:28
yarmouth sells the kids breakfast okay i
26:30
d said
26:30
not for kids it weighs the same as a
26:32
child nine pounds of cut over
26:35
basically yeah six eggs twelve bacon
26:37
pieces twelve sausages
26:39
it weighs the same as a child but then
26:41
the worst thing is
26:42
that people who order the kids breakfast
26:45
might be kids if they
26:46
don't realize that until they get
26:47
breakfast which is the same sizes
26:50
um i can possibly beat that though for
26:51
terrible food ideas so this is again i'm
26:53
very proud to say this is my hometown
26:55
did this made the news last year
26:56
because the local hospital is selling a
26:58
fry up pie for 1.50 in the hospital
27:00
canteen
27:01
wow sounds delicious um that sounds
27:03
great
27:04
it sounds tasty well one in the bakery
27:05
said well we're already making a full
27:07
scottish breakfast in a wrap so we
27:08
thought why not try it
27:12
i've always thought when having a full
27:13
scottish breakfast there's not enough
27:15
carbohydrates
27:17
to keep me going until elevens bolton we
27:20
would have um
27:21
like pasty bombs it's quite common or a
27:24
pie bomb
27:24
oh yeah in wigan they'd have that what's
27:26
that that's something you rub on
27:27
yourself
27:31
smooth your cracked lips yeah smear
27:34
pastry into every orifice of your body
27:38
no a balm is a balm cake has in a bread
27:40
roll or whatever you would call that
27:42
so it's like a pie sandwich it's meat
27:45
and potatoes so you've got carbs there
27:46
with your potatoes
27:47
inside pastry which is more carbs inside
27:50
the bread which is more carbs
27:51
um in new hampshire you can buy a
27:53
scratch card where when you scratch it
27:55
it gives off the smell of bacon
27:56
great it's called that it's called the i
27:59
heart bacon scratch ticket
28:01
well that is a very imaginative name
28:04
what did we call it guys they could they
28:06
should have called it pork scratchings
28:08
oh come on people you're so right
28:12
it's really good there's bacon perfume
28:13
isn't there as well you can get bacon
28:15
centered perfume
28:16
my life wouldn't go well with my pie
28:18
balm
28:20
um peter have tried to change loads of
28:22
different places names haven't they
28:25
yeah a few years ago it might have been
28:26
even this year they tried to get
28:28
nottingham um city council to change the
28:30
name to not eating ham
28:32
oh my god christmas has this ever worked
28:35
it gets them a few headlines i think it
28:37
does work yeah it does work because it
28:39
gets them in the newspapers the mayor of
28:40
fishkill
28:41
was asked it's near new york city if
28:45
they change it to
28:46
fish save did they contact the mayor of
28:48
dead cow burger mead
28:52
there's a place called featherbed rocks
28:54
which is near siem
28:56
and they wanted to call it synthetic
28:58
feather bed rocks
29:02
and also the pet shop boys they asked
29:04
them to change their name to the rescue
29:06
shelter boys
29:08
oh yeah because they hate pets don't
29:09
they they're against pets did they ask
29:11
the
29:11
super furry animals to change their name
29:13
to the super synthetic fairy animals
29:14
they should have done shouldn't they
29:15
yeah um the other thing they tried to
29:17
change peter was
29:18
um i think we mentioned it on the tv
29:20
show which is they tried to change
29:22
fish into sea kittens in the hope that
29:25
people wouldn't eat them as much
29:27
well that's not an insane idea i mean
29:29
obviously it's an insane idea
29:31
but the name does severely alter your
29:34
perception of something doesn't it
29:35
yes so for instance there are other fish
29:37
there's a fish called
29:38
a slime head and if you eat that
29:41
actually it's called an orange ruffy
29:43
so if you eat orange roughy the original
29:46
name of that fish was a slime head fish
29:48
but you changed it so that people would
29:49
eat it
29:49
so what would it take to agree to change
29:51
your town's name would you go for
29:53
so there was uh the town of clark texas
29:55
renamed itself
29:56
dish um after the ecostar communications
30:00
dish network and they all got free
30:01
satellite dishes on their houses
30:02
that's good it's a shame that clark
30:04
isn't in kent
30:06
it i'd be able to change hackney into
30:09
sky sports if they gave me free sky
30:11
sports yeah
30:11
i think i'd sell my town's name
30:13
immediately for a bag of sweets
30:15
there was a place in texas which um the
30:18
mayor
30:19
and the members of the chamber of
30:20
commerce they wanted voters to approve
30:22
the name change they had in mind this
30:23
was in 2005.
30:24
the place is called white settlement
30:28
the measure was voted on and was
30:30
defeated by nine to one
30:32
um as one resident said why don't they
30:34
go ahead and change the name of the
30:35
white house
30:36
to the west house it's all a bunch of
30:37
poppycock the thing is the white
30:38
settlement is
30:39
named from the 1840s when a community of
30:42
white settlers occupied an area
30:44
surrounded by several native american
30:46
villages right so it's not an innocent
30:47
explosion
30:49
it's not like being called mr white
30:52
there is
30:52
a um there's a village in spain called
30:56
castrillo mata judios
30:59
which translates as fought kill the jews
31:03
wow and they voted last year to change
31:05
their name
31:06
uh and it went through it should go
31:08
through because it takes about a year
31:09
for the process to go through so by
31:11
around june or july this year
31:13
uh they should change their name uh
31:15
you've got one that's interesting i mean
31:16
i know it's
31:17
offensive but it is interesting it's
31:18
really interesting you've got to wonder
31:20
why it took them so long yeah
31:21
it was it dates back from uh the
31:23
expulsion of the jews in 1492 by king
31:26
ferdinand and queen isabella wow okay so
31:28
it's
31:29
a very long historical thing but they've
31:31
finally voted to do it yeah
31:32
you can get a map i wanted to get
31:34
something for christmas of all the
31:35
funny place names in the uk i mean it is
31:38
just riddled with them um it's really
31:40
good
31:40
yeah i mean there are so many what's the
31:42
best i like another song
31:44
i think that's my favorite i like brown
31:45
willy which is the highest point of
31:47
visit dorset or that bottom and more
31:49
the highest point and there is a
31:50
meteorological effect called the brown
31:52
woolly effect
31:54
which is where um banks of cloud hit
31:57
uh hill go high and then it leads to at
31:59
least rain uh at least a thin drizzle
32:01
all across
32:02
podman more brown woody effect someone
32:05

no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:30
brought to you from the qi offices in

00:38

00:40
special guest today historian and

00:45
who has a book to plug correct
00:48
yes plug plug plug bug it's called a
00:50
million years in a day and it's out like
00:52
now and it's quite good it's quite good
00:54
it is good some of us have read at least
00:56
bits of it it's amazing i wouldn't go
00:58
that far but it's all right it's above
01:00
average i would say it's definitely sort
01:02
of top 70 percentile you know like you
01:04
know it's a two one okay
01:07
a high two one book buy it um okay let's
01:10
get on with the show
01:15
and for fact number one let's go to you
01:18
greg okay so my fact is from my book
01:20
because i am that unimaginative and my
01:22
fact is in the 1960s in america there
01:26
was one particular bus route that was
01:28
only 35 miles long but during that time
01:31
passengers passed through seven
01:33
different time zones wow that's amazing
01:35
how does that work right so it's fairly
01:38
complicated so i'll have to give you
01:39
probably a bit of context okay um this
01:41
is all to do with daylight saving time
01:43
which is something we have here of
01:44
course in britain and it's a familiar
01:46
concept to all of us um but it was an
01:48
idea first put forward about a hundred
01:50
years ago by william willett who was a
01:53
mustachioed englishman uh he was also
01:55
the ancestor of chris martin from
01:56
coldplay you know
01:59
who wrote clocks
02:00
exactly there we go see um so he put
02:03
that forward in about 1909 i think and
02:05
he was arguing for try and get more
02:07
daylight into the time so everyone went
02:09
well this is a nice idea in principle
02:11
but it sounds very complicated we're not
02:12
going to do it
02:13
and then in 1915 he died and everyone
02:16
was sort of mocking him and the idea was
02:18
going nowhere and then germany picked up
02:20
the idea and said this is a brilliant
02:21
idea we will do this they did it during
02:22
the war then they did it during the and
02:24
it was like it saved them energy yeah
02:26
because
02:27
that extra hour of daylight meant you
02:28
didn't have to burn loads and loads of
02:30
gas and oil and that could then go to
02:32
the war effort when he died did everyone
02:34
miss his funeral by an hour
02:38
um so as soon as germany adopted it
02:40
britain very sheepishly went yeah maybe
02:42
we maybe we should do that as well and
02:43
it became known as will it time um which
02:45
is like hammer time but with a moustache
02:47
i think
02:49
and anyway it then spread around the
02:50
world and america adopted it and the
02:52
problem with america is it's a much
02:54
bigger nation than britain and so
02:56
america has loads of time zones and it's
02:59
too big and so the government says all
03:00
right come on let's let's be sensible
03:02
here we're a federal nation so each
03:03
state can decide if they're going to opt
03:05
in or opt out yeah and then the problem
03:07
is that each of the states then said to
03:09
the towns and cities okay you guys can
03:11
also decide if you're going to opt in or
03:12
opt out and so 28 of the states uh opted
03:16
in to dst and then the various cities
03:19
would then decide oh we can do it we're
03:21
not gonna do it and so what happened is
03:22
you ended up with this incredibly
03:24
chaotic system it's the point that in
03:26
idaho
03:28
uh shops that were next door to each
03:29
other might be on different times so in
03:32
the same building like you could
03:33
literally go that next door to the
03:34
corner shops again amazing yeah this was
03:36
in the 1950s and 1970s until 1966 this
03:38
was happening
03:40
i just want to say how did it work with
03:42
the two shops that were next to each
03:43
other it reminds me of a place i went to
03:45
called baal hertog on the border of the
03:47
netherlands and belgium right oh yeah
03:49
the exclave yeah so there's loads of
03:51
exclaves and the border between the two
03:53
countries is really really complicated
03:55
and they have the lines you can see on
03:57
the on the pavements you can see where
03:58
the lines are so you can like walk from
04:00
belgium to netherlands and back into
04:02
belgium then back into netherlands again
04:04
and there's something like the
04:05
netherlands rules on selling pornography
04:07
are supposed to be so much better than
04:09
belgium so all the pornographic shops
04:11
are in netherlands and all the fireworks
04:13
shops are in belgium even though they're
04:14
in the same town they're all put in
04:16
different buildings that's uh i mean i
04:17
think i mean that's a mad idea isn't it
04:18
but i think and certainly kids in
04:20
michigan go to canada to go drinking
04:23
canada i think he's 18 his legal agent
04:25
in america 21.
04:27
this is in fact there was a golf club
04:29
set up on the border of the us and
04:30
canada during prohibition as a way for
04:33
americans to be able to drink so the uh
04:35
drinking club within the golf club was
04:37
on the canadian side of the border so
04:38
you could enter the golf club in america
04:40
and then you kind of wander over to the
04:42
side which had a pub go drinking it's a
04:44
brilliant idea yeah but so i think
04:46
william willits
04:48
one of the reasons people thought he was
04:49
crazy because his system was quite
04:51
complicated so he was suggesting going
04:53
forward by 20 minutes of daylight a day
04:55
right yeah he just is very complicated i
04:57
think he suggested i can't remember
04:58
exactly details but he suggested
05:00
changing the clock something like six or
05:01
seven times a year yeah which is just a
05:03
bit too much faffing and also people had
05:05
only just got uniform time because until
05:08
the sort of the coming of the railways
05:10
every town in britain had its own time
05:13
um i think bath and bristol were i think
05:15
about seven or eight minutes behind
05:16
london and so when the trains arrived
05:18
that became chaotic because people
05:20
missed their trains obviously and then
05:21
william when it turned out went hey guys
05:22
what if we all changed our crosstalk
05:24
loads and loads of times you know a
05:26
really annoying date and we'd all get an
05:28
hour back it was the railways which
05:29
actually made the first time zone yeah
05:31
it's called railway time railway time
05:33
it's so cool and all the really
05:35
interesting legal implications over what
05:36
could happen so if babies were born
05:38
at the same time but in different places
05:41
that you know a whole inheritance could
05:43
be changed because technically
05:45
you know the child had been born earlier
05:46
therefore has got the will of the
05:48
inheritance or whatever so
05:51
all of this happened only because of um
05:53
fast speed communication so trains
05:56
telegraphs that kind of thing the
05:58
amazing thing is i mean so i've gone
05:59
back to my original fact this 35 mile
06:01
route you had to change your watch i
06:03
think every
06:05
eight minutes i mean did people actually
06:07
do no i don't think so i mean i think
06:09
you know maybe if you're like we're
06:10
really into timekeeping yeah i bet there
06:12
was one really nerdy school boy but it's
06:14
just this amazing idea that you'd get on
06:15
a bus and it was only 35 miles it's
06:17
between moundsville west virginia and
06:19
steubenville ohio
06:21
and during that time you would pass in
06:22
and out of time zones back and forth
06:24
back and forth back
06:25
what you guys were saying about
06:26
different towns having their own times
06:28
and that was in america as well and um
06:31
in the 1870s north america had 144
06:34
official times in all the different
06:36
towns and stuff 144 yeah and if you went
06:40
from washington to san francisco and you
06:42
wanted to be this nerdy schoolboy who
06:44
changed his watch all the time you'd
06:45
have to change it over 200 times no way
06:49
but in fairness it's a long journey and
06:51
you need to do something to take up the
06:53
title podcast has not been invented no
06:55
to be listened to there's no sudoku yet
06:56
it's just just watches but i mean the
06:58
problem of time keeping is a really
07:00
ancient one and this is something i sort
07:02
of tried to cover in the book of it is
07:03
the you know the ancient egyptians you
07:05
know were trying to work out what time
07:06
it was by the stars and via solar clocks
07:09
but um
07:10
back then
07:11
there was no standard 60 minute hour is
07:13
it true that in the middle ages they
07:14
used to um they would have say 12 hours
07:17
in a day and that would be from sunrise
07:19
to sunset and so if it was a longer day
07:22
in the summer then the hours would just
07:23
be longer yeah exactly right yeah they
07:25
basically i mean they're worth scholars
07:27
who kind of went hey guys i think we
07:28
should have actually equal hours but it
07:29
didn't really work there's no point
07:31
being smug if you're stumbling around in
07:32
the dark that's so interesting so when
07:34
it seemed like in the summer term the
07:36
hours were going really slowly because
07:38
you're waiting for the holidays it's
07:39
because they were yeah yeah because
07:41
until the invention of like gas lights
07:43
and stuff when people actually could
07:45
have artificial lighting
07:46
people just went to bed when it got dark
07:48
how much people know how long it was
07:49
like how did they know in advance sand
07:51
timers and water timers
07:53
the ancient chinese or the medieval
07:54
chinese had clocks that you could smell
07:57
so each hour was a different incense so
07:59
it burned down and so you'll be like oh
08:01
it must be lunch time because i can
08:02
smell ginger
08:05
ginger
08:06
so yeah the history time keeps really
08:08
really confusing it wasn't until i think
08:10
the 14th century that it was a muslim
08:11
scholar
08:12
um i think in syria
08:14
who came up with the first equal hours
08:15
clock before that would have played hell
08:17
but things like women's hour
08:20
welcome to women's 72 minutes
08:22
it still is really complicated time
08:24
zones and time keeping and everything
08:26
isn't it like some countries have the
08:27
most eccentric systems when i live in
08:29
australia they have various bits of
08:31
australia that are have it in half hour
08:33
increments rather than an hour
08:34
increments and some places have it in
08:36
quarter of an hour increments i think
08:37
there's a town of 200 people in
08:38
australia which is decided to be uh gmt
08:41
plus eight and three quarters brilliant
08:43
so the town of bloody awkwardsville
08:46
australia
08:47
i'm trying to work out so how many time
08:49
zones do we think there are in the world
08:50
so if you just count an hour they're
08:52
divided along 15 degrees across the
08:54
world since the 1880s i think it is so
08:56
there should only be 24 i think
08:58
basically except there are 26 because
09:00
there's a little group of islands which
09:01
decided to put themselves to because
09:03
they did more trading with america oh
09:05
really they decided to join america's
09:06
time so if you look down the um
09:08
international date line it's got a
09:10
really weird kink in it it's not a line
09:11
at all because it scoops these islands
09:13
in is that samoa or american samoa or
09:15
longer is different samoa is the one
09:17
that went in 2011 it decided to go uh
09:20
back a day didn't it so it missed out
09:22
the 30th of december 2011. i'm sorry it
09:24
went forward today
09:25
but i did get an extra day on the 4th of
09:28
july 1882
09:30
1892. use it wisely yeah
09:33
so i reckon what would happen is
09:34
everyone would celebrate the day before
09:36
because it's like a big event everyone
09:37
would be hungover to hell on that day
09:39
yeah and no one would do anything on
09:41
that day at all and then the next day
09:42
they go what do you do on your ex today
09:44
oh i just stayed in bed yeah
09:46
i'd love there to be like a doctor who
09:48
episode that's set in the lost days
09:51
oh yeah some sort of weird
09:53
quasi-universe where that's that that's
09:55
great yeah i don't actually watch doctor
09:56
who's i don't know how it would work but
09:58
it would it's like that like that
09:59
basically yeah that made a lot more
10:01
sense than a lot of the
10:02
doctors um
10:04
anyone else uh some things on buses oh
10:07
yeah buses soon as we were talking about
10:08
the start so there is a bus driver in
10:11
moscow called alexi volkov who is known
10:14
as the punisher because he deliberately
10:16
rams people who cut him up really well
10:19
when you say cut him up do you mean
10:20
people who stab him with a knife
10:23
i'm afraid not if you've driven in
10:25
moscow it's like that everyone's cutting
10:27
you up although that's a weirdly
10:28
visceral metaphor isn't it yeah for just
10:29
someone driving in front of you a bit
10:31
close yeah gonna cut you up cut me up
10:33
i wonder if there's ever been a
10:34
confusion in a police station on that if
10:37
anyone's ever got a really long prison
10:38
sentence unnecessarily for just slipping
10:40
in front of somebody
10:42
[Laughter]
10:44
[Applause]
10:44
[Music]
10:46
all right now it's time for fact number
10:47
two and that is andy my fact is that if
10:50
a predator gets too close to a limpet
10:52
the limpet will lift up its shell and
10:54
then stamp on the predator's foot
10:56
how cool is that
10:58
so how fast does it do that because i
11:00
think of olympus as being quite slow
11:02
moving they are slow they generally get
11:04
about a meter
11:05
away from their home before going back
11:07
brilliant that's a big outing yeah it's
11:09
a long weekend and they have to get back
11:11
before the tide comes in so you know why
11:12
did they leave their home then if
11:14
they're only going to meet her what are
11:15
they looking for they are looking for
11:16
food they are
11:18
hungry for algae
11:20
they they love analgus the other thing
11:22
is that
11:23
they'll stamp on your foot if you go to
11:25
near them but they only have one
11:27
don't they they're just a foot that's
11:28
all olympics they are the foot but
11:30
they're holding they've got the shell
11:31
all around them so that's the painful
11:33
bit so the muscle the foot muscle is in
11:35
the middle and then obviously the shell
11:38
you know crunching down between the
11:39
predator and the rock things like
11:40
starfish like to eat them yeah i don't
11:42
think i can do it very fast but it's
11:43
called mushrooming just uh why is it
11:45
called mushrooming mushrooms don't stamp
11:47
on you i suppose when they go up on
11:50
their foot and the shell is around them
11:51
they look like a mushroom if you from
11:53
the side
11:54
but that's just that's just a theory i
11:55
don't i don't know that's true yeah and
11:57
so yeah anyway they move across they go
11:59
commuting basically for algae and they
12:01
move across very very slowly um and they
12:04
have this tongue called a radula
12:07
which they scrape over the rock and it's
12:08
got
12:09
920 teeth on it whoa yeah um with
12:13
hardened with iron compounds basically
12:15
if these things ever decide to grow
12:16
bigger we are stuffed
12:18
um the compound is called girthite i
12:21
think is it named after gerta the um
12:24
yeah
12:25
well it's quite a long story so it's
12:27
named by a guy called um george lentz uh
12:30
who was a friend of goethe and if you
12:33
read any books it says that it was named
12:35
in his honor yeah but actually these two
12:38
guys fell out quite early he introduced
12:41
uh lentz to his sister and we don't know
12:43
his sister was married and we don't know
12:45
what happened but then a little bit
12:47
later uh lentz was kicked out of the
12:50
court of weimar and then later on uh
12:52
lentz then named this mineral after
12:54
gurtha
12:56
but
12:56
it says it's in his honor but these two
12:58
didn't get on and so i think that it was
13:00
named against him because he didn't like
13:02
him and it's this thing which is found
13:04
in the tongue of olympia but it's also
13:06
found in mud and i think he was like
13:08
literally making his name mud nice good
13:11
theory theory yeah it's olympics then
13:13
limpets
13:15
their commute sounds thrilling yeah it
13:18
is but doesn't algae come to them
13:21
no right well in a way yes i think they
13:24
filter water through their gills but
13:26
they do also definitely go across the
13:27
rocks in search of food um very very
13:30
slowly they also migrate
13:33
how far not very fast a few meters about
13:36
a meter yeah
13:37
but in the winter
13:39
do they go south for winter
13:44
they move up the shower so it depends
13:46
which direction the shark if you ever
13:47
see a flock of limpets in a v shape
13:52
it's for better aerodynamics
13:53
[Laughter]
13:55
so so when they and when they go they
13:57
leave a trail of mucus behind them right
13:59
um when they go across scraping the rock
14:01
with their tongue and getting all the
14:02
algae up off the rock but then the mucus
14:04
they leave behind them actually
14:05
encourages more algae to grow on it but
14:07
that's basically farming they are
14:09
encouraging more food to grow in the
14:11
path they have been in oh yeah yeah so
14:13
not only is quite advanced farming if
14:15
they're rotating are they enclosed
14:17
harvesters
14:19
but they do get subsidies from the eu
14:21
they have a butter mountain
14:24
an algae mountain
14:25
right here's a question and you may know
14:27
the answer to it i'm going off topic
14:29
here but how many bacteria would you
14:31
have to have before you could see them
14:33
in a lump what would a mountain of
14:35
bacteria look like it would look like a
14:37
lot of pus basically really how do you
14:39
know that just before we get on to that
14:41
how do you look like a mountain
14:44
i think i might have read that in one of
14:47
xkcd's things either in their book or on
14:51
their website
14:52
surely it would depend on the kind of
14:53
bacteria some of it yeah all of the same
14:56
i know it would look like a big shimmery
14:59
silvery greenish bluish so like the blob
15:02
from like the classic movies in the 60s
15:04
or whatever but i mean james sounds like
15:06
he's actually done some research i've
15:08
said this before the blob is based on a
15:10
real police report i might have said
15:11
this before actually yeah it was based
15:14
on a police report in america in the
15:15
1950s about a mysterious blob
15:18
which turned out to be a giant cluster
15:19
of bacteria if you haven't seen the blob
15:21
it's such a good film it's got steve
15:22
mcqueen yeah a really really young steve
15:24
mcqueen and um the blob eats everyone oh
15:27
spoiler alert
15:30
so just swallowed things up and digested
15:32
them yeah
15:33
that's a great bit where a farmer gets
15:34
angry with it and fires a gun into it
15:37
he's terrified doesn't work it doesn't
15:39
work it just eats the bullets it gets
15:40
attraction bigger again guys spoiler
15:42
alert sorry come on yeah
15:44
we were talking about bacteria yeah
15:45
there's a bacteria that you can see i
15:47
think
15:48
this bacterium i think might be
15:50
nicknamed conan the bacterium
15:56
i believe so that's amazing we've
15:58
mentioned in one of our books that
16:00
bacteria can get viruses
16:02
viruses can get the viruses can get
16:04
viruses big viruses can get small ones
16:06
they found the big virus it was in a
16:08
cooling tower somewhere in in the uk i
16:10
think and it was a massive massive virus
16:12
and then they found another one and it
16:13
was orbiting the original virus and it's
16:16
called sputnik they called it really
16:17
yeah wow again it might be a newspaper
16:19
nickname i don't know it's like a
16:21
satellite virus yeah just going round
16:23
and round if you dropped a load of
16:25
bacteria right out of a plane okay how
16:28
much a blobsworth yeah blobsworth say
16:31
would they fall
16:32
or would the air currents be enough to
16:34
just keep them up there forever oh
16:36
interesting that's what a cloud is andy
16:38
it's just a load of bacteria yeah well a
16:41
cloud needs something to for the water
16:44
droplets to nucleate around and
16:46
sometimes that would be bacteria really
16:48
yeah i imagine it would usually be like
16:50
dust or sand but i bet it could work
16:51
with bacteria they've just done a trial
16:53
of cloud seeding or they've done a study
16:55
of studies of cloud seeding which is
16:56
where you you drop a dividing crystals
16:59
from a plane and then that enco those
17:01
are the tiny tiny crystals which the
17:02
water droplets form around and then you
17:04
get rain or snow and they found that it
17:05
does have a small positive effect they
17:07
don't think that it's currently good
17:08
enough to deliberately do anything
17:10
together like you could probably make a
17:12
difference but it's not reliable enough
17:14
yeah you can't just wake up it's a sunny
17:15
day that was me
17:17
that was my cloud seating we did cloud
17:19
seeding just before summer this year and
17:20
we're very proud to report it's been a
17:22
bbq summer
17:25
can you tell we haven't done any limpet
17:26
research
17:27
i've got lots of olympia research okay
17:29
let's hear something
17:30
i'm keen to talk about olympics um
17:32
limpets are all there there's basically
17:34
no such thing as a limpet
17:36
which is good yeah so limpets uh don't
17:38
really exist um
17:40
i think they do andrew i think they
17:42
don't because it's just a name for
17:45
aquatic snails with basically conical
17:48
shells right that's all it is um
17:50
it's a very informal term
17:52
you know lots of different things that
17:53
we call limpets come from different uh
17:56
you know different files there's a thing
17:58
called a common limpet isn't there i
18:00
think
18:01
yes there is and that will be a specific
18:02
species that's very informative
18:06
it doesn't take its shoes off when it
18:07
comes in the word wikipedia describes
18:09
limpet it's exactly how i've just
18:10
described it because this is where i got
18:12
it you missed off the bit that it had so
18:14
olympia is a common implied aquatic
18:15
snails with shells broadly conical in
18:17
shape rather like the conical asian hat
18:20
which i've never well i've never seen
18:21
wikipedia open with a simile nor a
18:24
slightly racist similarity
18:26
what's the chronicles talking about you
18:27
know if you took a slightly racist
18:29
picture of someone from asia from the
18:32
1950s yeah and they'd be like a rice
18:34
farmer with their hats oh really yeah
18:37
broad like lots of shade because if
18:39
you're working outdoors as a as a rice
18:41
farmer then that's it keeps the sun off
18:42
your head yeah um so you're so starfish
18:45
eat limpets don't they or try to they do
18:46
and the way starfish sometimes eat
18:48
things is they sort of make their
18:49
stomach go to them i think rather than
18:51
them going to their stomach so i think
18:52
starfish expel their stomachs out of
18:54
themselves and then swallow them up into
18:56
their stomach so i guess like a limp it
18:58
when it's trying to defend itself might
19:01
stamp on a starfish stomach is that what
19:03
it does i think it seems that yes i
19:06
assume there are starfish stuck by the
19:08
stomach somewhere by olympiad have you
19:10
heard of starfish wasting disease
19:12
no
19:13
yeah it's very sad it's um a disease
19:16
which is kind of getting a bit bigger at
19:17
the moment and it basically gets
19:19
starfish to waste themselves by ripping
19:22
their own arms off yeah they rip their
19:25
arms off yeah how do they rip off the
19:27
last arm
19:30
the the arms continue to crawl around
19:32
for a while after after they've ripped
19:34
them off so that's pretty creepy maybe
19:35
they all gang up and rip the last one
19:37
off as well did i hear on was it a
19:39
podcast or maybe an episode of qa about
19:40
a plan that's so painful when you touch
19:42
it the guy tried to a guy shot himself
19:44
oh yeah oh it's a pig and it's so
19:47
painful you just can't even tolerate
19:49
living anymore yeah yeah maybe that's
19:51
how it works but didn't didn't he use it
19:52
accidentally as lou paper he did yeah it
19:54
was in australia this is a reporting
19:56
australian geographic uh and yeah this
19:59
it stings so much it's like being
20:00
electrocuted
20:02
on the bum yeah it's horrible he picked
20:04
it up wiped himself and
20:07
so much pain he shot himself
20:09
wow well speaking of people who've
20:10
electrocuted their bums that's reminded
20:12
me of one of my favorite ever stories
20:14
from history
20:15
and uh it was a fairly famous guy
20:18
actually so this is alexander von
20:19
humboldt oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
20:22
he was mega famous he was like a proper
20:24
famous polymath and exactly so
20:26
enlightenment scholar proper prussian
20:28
chap he has does he have more things
20:30
named after species named after him than
20:31
anyone else really i feel like maybe he
20:33
does i think he's got a lot darwin
20:34
sounds like it would be more but i'm not
20:36
sure he did loads of research in south
20:38
america and in his 20s he got really
20:40
obsessed with electricity because it was
20:42
kind of galvani had just been
20:43
electrocuting stuff and everyone was
20:44
going electricity is the new that's a
20:46
new thing and so one day he and his
20:49
assistant were sort of wondering i
20:50
wonder what electricity does to dead
20:52
things and they found i think a dead
20:53
bird and he reanimated it and with
20:56
electricity and it came back to life for
20:57
10 minutes and he went oh amazing
20:58
brilliant that's electricity can revive
21:00
the dead they probably died of heart
21:01
disease or something and it restarted
21:02
the heart and the heart was bleeding in
21:04
it or maybe it was asleep
21:07
i just woke it up
21:08
but having electrocuted the bird he then
21:11
thought well electricity is clearly
21:12
amazing i wonder what else i can
21:13
electrocute i know myself and so he put
21:16
one uh electrode in his mouth and then
21:18
he inserted the other one into his anus
21:21
and then electrocuted himself
21:23
and uh one of my favorite ever quotes
21:26
from history is his description of of
21:28
the outcome um he put it about four
21:30
inches into his rectum and he describes
21:32
it as this the introduction of a charge
21:34
into the armatures produced nauseating
21:36
cramps and discomforting stomach
21:37
contractions then abdominal pain the
21:39
severe magnitude followed by involuntary
21:42
evacuation of the bladder what struck me
21:44
more is that by inserting the silver
21:45
more deeply into the rectum
21:49
having evacuated my vowels i thought i'd
21:51
skip that further in uh more deeply into
21:52
the wrecks and a bright light appears
21:54
behind both eyes
21:56
so he basically went wow this is really
21:58
painful and i've pissed myself but what
21:59
if i keep going and then he just
22:01
basically had to sort of blindness
22:03
behind his eyes that is a scientist
22:05
and then what about when he went deeper
22:06
come on
22:08
you take it i see what you mean it's
22:10
like he saw a bright light yeah i was
22:13
kind of picturing lasers coming out of
22:14
his eyes
22:16
i think what he's describing is
22:17
basically just like flashes of
22:18
electricity
22:19
like you know wow blinding um and the
22:21
lovely thing is that that didn't put him
22:22
off electricity at all he then went to
22:24
south america and did various research
22:25
where he came across i think an electric
22:27
eel and the first thing he did shoving
22:29
up his ass he didn't thankfully he
22:31
didn't do that but he did pick it up and
22:32
go
22:33
all right you try gave it to his
22:34
assistant
22:35
and gave it back to it and they
22:36
electrocuted themselves all day long
22:38
just texting how painful
22:40
they used to put eels up horses bums
22:42
didn't they so you would go to market
22:44
and you would want to sell your house
22:46
but you want people to think it was
22:47
better than it was you put um either
22:49
some ginger or an eel up their buns and
22:51
it would make them more lively you
22:53
should never look at gift horse in the
22:54
mouth but you should look in the anus
22:56
just in case
22:58
um i think the romans also used electric
23:00
eels as a cure for headaches i think
23:02
memory serves i think would that work i
23:05
think well because they definitely had
23:06
eels and they were really interested in
23:07
eels they used to have man-eating eels
23:08
in their ponds and slaves used to be
23:10
thrown into the man eating eels
23:13
well really aggressive eels that would
23:15
just eat any flesh and if a roman
23:17
aristocrat didn't like a slave or a
23:18
slave had broken a nice cup or something
23:21
thrown to the eels and eat him did they
23:22
have cups i suppose they must have done
23:24
they they did it
23:26
i think they had an empire you're not
23:27
bothered about the man eating eels but
23:31
cops you say yeah no
23:33
they had aqua ducks yeah
23:37
we've got all this water all the way
23:39
here from the mountains right everyone
23:41
get your hands together it's time for
23:43
the tea
23:44
what i mean was
23:46
oh god
23:47
i don't think of them having cups with
23:49
handles i think of them having little
23:50
handleless goblets yeah things like that
23:53
but actually i mean that there was one
23:54
very famous roman and aristocrat who was
23:56
so in love with his eels his pet hills
23:58
actually that he put earrings on them
24:00
and painted their faces like like a lady
24:03
when the eel died he cried bitterly you
24:05
know more so than when his own sort of
24:07
slaves or family died but when the heels
24:09
snuffed it he was really cute roman
24:11
buzzfeed pictures but not dogs and
24:13
jumpers they were of eels with makeup on
24:18
that's creepy yeah really quickly yeah
24:21
animal defense mechanisms just have we
24:23
ever talked about the pygmy sperm whale
24:25
i know i'd remember we talked about all
24:27
those three things separately
24:32
okay
24:36
so it's really quite sweet it's tiny um
24:39
and b is a defense mechanism it's
24:41
another animal that shoots like syrupy
24:43
stuff out of its anus um which things
24:46
that they're trying to chase it kind of
24:47
gets stuck in and disoriented by um it's
24:50
a d it squirts a deep colored syrup into
24:52
the water and spreads it around with its
24:53
tail so it like mixes it around it's
24:55
species though isn't it right
24:57
is it feces well if it's dark and syrupy
25:00
and coming out of its anus i always say
25:02
if it looks like feces taste like feces
25:04
it's probably a feces i prefer to call
25:06
mine syrup
25:09
and yeah swishes it around in the water
25:10
like a painter mixing his paints um
25:14
like a really weird painter
25:17
like tracy
25:18
mixing her paints
25:20
[Applause]
25:23
um so time to fact number three and that
25:25
is my fact and my fact is that after
25:28
landing on the moon buzz aldrin worked
25:31
in a car dealership where he failed to
25:33
sell a single car i'm not surprised if
25:35
he's selling them on the moon yeah
25:36
exactly to be fair they would have had a
25:38
massive mileage on the clock as well
25:39
yeah
25:40
and they only sell one type which is a
25:41
rover
25:43
[Laughter]
25:45
he came home first right sorry after
25:47
returning from the moon possibly worked
25:50
in a car dealership and failed to sell a
25:52
car yeah so this is this so it was in
25:53
beverly hills um and he worked there for
25:55
six months i think it was a cadillac
25:56
dealership but i was reading this this
25:58
really interesting article about how
26:00
after barcelona and armstrong landed on
26:02
the moon a year later almost no
26:04
americans knew who they were they
26:05
completely slipped out of the public eye
26:07
yeah nationwide surveys done the new
26:09
york times around a lot of them and yeah
26:10
one in 12 or 1 in 10 people would be
26:12
able to name buzz aldrin or neil
26:13
armstrong that's unbelievable it's weird
26:15
isn't it yeah that's so weird yeah and
26:18
they think because at the time so one
26:19
theory is that at the time um because it
26:21
was like a race between the soviets in
26:22
america to get to the moon once they'd
26:24
got there it was like well we've done
26:25
that now we've won that race um tick box
26:28
moving on and another theory put forward
26:31
is that neither buzz aldrin or neil
26:33
armstrong are particularly good orators
26:35
and so this guy thinks that because they
26:37
weren't able to like maximize their
26:39
experiences and they just kept on saying
26:41
yeah it was really great how could
26:42
naruto do you need to be to say i've
26:43
been to the moon
26:47
a resting opening line yeah yeah friends
26:49
romans countrymen i've been to the moon
26:52
so he didn't sell a single car surely
26:54
like even crap salesmen sell like one
26:56
car a year he must have been really bad
26:58
yeah yeah people presumably came in
27:00
wanting to buy a car yeah go to a
27:01
cadillac dealership that's what you're
27:02
in the market for yeah well they just
27:04
talked about the moon the whole time
27:06
yeah and then they left forgotten what
27:08
they got him for
27:10
damn it what did i mean to get in that
27:11
cadillac dealership
27:13
i think it was an anecdote about the
27:14
moon
27:16
yes it was
27:17
but no i think he was quite depressed
27:18
after he landed on the moon for a while
27:20
wasn't him and neil armstrong both very
27:21
disappointed for a while at the fact
27:22
that they'd been forgotten if you google
27:25
buzz aldrin car
27:27
first thing that comes up is buzz aldrin
27:29
cardboard cutout
27:30
[Laughter]
27:31
and there are some great reviews of it
27:33
online i want to tell you about a couple
27:35
of them
27:36
um
27:37
great product i accidentally scared the
27:38
wife as i set it up in the living room
27:40
and was adjusting the support when she
27:41
walked in she actually thought it was a
27:43
real person for a few seconds
27:45
is this why people didn't think he was a
27:46
good orator
27:49
confusing them
27:51
yeah
27:51
um neil armstrong did you know that his
27:54
hairdresser sold a lock of his hair and
27:56
neil armstrong sued him for three
27:58
thousand dollars really yeah
28:00
he went back to his barber and found out
28:01
how barbara had just been selling locks
28:02
i would definitely sue her yeah i think
28:04
i think i had as well it's a bit weird i
28:06
think what was it um harry styles from
28:08
one direction vomited out the side of a
28:10
car and the vomit went on ebay for
28:11
thousands of pounds
28:13
you're not allowed to sell biological
28:15
stuff on ebay cost me a fortune in
28:17
delivery
28:19
but we've long since venerated like you
28:21
know the saints bones you know a little
28:22
the finger of you know some peter or
28:24
whatever like people have always wanted
28:25
little bits of body fat so it's just a
28:27
holy vomit it's a secular
28:29
britney spears chewing gum has gone on
28:30
ebay in the past and um elvis's cup of
28:33
water yeah they the guy sold the water
28:36
but not the cup genius so he he was
28:38
keeping he's from he was from ancient
28:40
rome there's not many of these around
28:44
who owns the hair when you go to the
28:45
hairdresser and then they cut it off and
28:47
then you leave the shop where does it i
28:49
mean i think if someone cuts your hair
28:51
without you on your permission that is
28:53
technically assault i believe really
28:56
yeah i think so i think so i'm not but
28:58
if it's your hairdresser then that's
28:59
what obviously you're giving away with
29:00
your yeah i mean if your hairdresser is
29:02
cutting your hair without your
29:02
permission then you need to have a good
29:04
odd look at your life
29:05
how is it at the back are you like i did
29:07
not give you permission for that
29:09
they used to sell hair from hairdressers
29:12
um to wig makers they still do yeah you
29:14
can sell your own hair there are nuns
29:15
who sell their hair
29:17
so that implies that it belongs to the
29:18
hairdresser yeah i mean in ancient rome
29:20
blonde slaves were very fashionable you
29:22
get german and british blonde slaves
29:24
they would be bought almost exclusively
29:26
to have their hair which you then cut
29:28
off and turn into a wig for fashionable
29:29
roman ladies who were maybe you know
29:30
brown haired wow that's so strange yeah
29:34
uh okay so um some people who've gone on
29:36
to do different things yeah um you know
29:38
the tv show gladiators yes so i went on
29:41
to i found a website of where are they
29:43
now of the gladiators and there's a few
29:47
people one of them was shadow
29:49
and he
29:50
had a bit of a bad time afterwards his
29:52
lowest point was he was arrested for
29:53
attempting to use an elderly person's
29:55
bus pass despite being 43 years old that
29:59
was his lowest moment
30:00
yeah he he sadly had like a drug
30:02
addiction but he's got through it now
30:04
and he's a rehabilitation counselor good
30:06
um there was three members of the
30:09
gladiators team in the 2000 movie
30:12
gladiator
30:13
really really yeah
30:15
but isn't that just amazing yeah
30:17
misunderstand the job application
30:20
they're getting the gang back together
30:23
coming up with a huge pugil sticks with
30:24
other pillows on either end
30:28
that's amazing yeah guys stop demanding
30:31
a travelator
30:32
didn't exist in ancient rome
30:35
rockets rio and rebel i don't even
30:37
remember any of those i remember rebel i
30:40
don't remember rocky who was rocket
30:41
isn't he a salad what
30:44
some stuff about salesmen because that's
30:46
what buzz became
30:48
there was a survey done in america um
30:51
they took a load of unpleasant things
30:53
and they asked people whether you
30:55
preferred this unpleasant thing or
30:57
congress
30:58
um you mean uh american congress not
31:00
sexual congress
31:02
yes okay cool it could be the same thing
31:04
in some cases i suppose i suppose so but
31:06
then you would probably be fired for
31:07
impropriety at work yeah unless you're
31:09
bill clinton
31:10
[Laughter]
31:12
so um they were given used car salesmen
31:15
or people in congress and 32 percent of
31:19
people preferred congress and 57 percent
31:21
of people preferred used car salesmen
31:24
wow but that's a bit of a strange thing
31:26
to ask because it's do you prefer them
31:27
in the abstract yeah it is would you
31:29
rather
31:30
you know have one
31:32
exactly i'll give you a list of some of
31:33
the other things that they gave when you
31:34
prefer
31:35
people preferred all of these things to
31:37
congress okay uh root canal surgery
31:41
head lice
31:42
the rock band nickelback
31:45
that was quite close that is extreme
31:46
that is a real colonoscopies traffic
31:49
jams cockroaches donald trump france
31:53
genghis khan and brussels sprouts
31:56
genghis khan is my favorite that's
31:57
amazing
31:59
what do you prefer congress or a 13th
32:00
century warlord for mongolia
32:03
people are really hating genghis khan
32:05
these days really
32:08
really loathe is that genghis khan you
32:10
know what i think we should let it lie
32:12
now with genghis
32:15
do they do any combos so did they say
32:17
would you rather have congress or a
32:18
colonoscopy from genghis khan
32:21
use car salesmen yeah i don't know
32:23
anything about them no not actually
32:25
they're generally unpopular yeah yeah
32:26
yeah that's just the trope isn't it
32:28
because matilda's dead as one isn't he
32:29
in the boat yeah yeah
32:31
um i was like yeah it was a used car
32:32
salesman was he are they new cars
32:35
i said buzz lightyear that's
32:37
fantastically weird i actually kept on
32:39
doing buzz lightyear yeah
32:54
as far as the moon i can totally
32:56
understand
32:58
[Applause]
33:00
all right moving on to our final facts
33:04
which is from you james
33:06
okay my fact this week is also from
33:09
greg's book great excellent book and it
33:11
is about the catholic sect called the
33:14
cathars and the cathars get their name
33:17
from the fact that they are thought to
33:19
be pure like catharsis but during the
33:22
middle ages some people thought that
33:24
they got their name cathars from the
33:26
fact that they like to kiss a cat's ass
33:29
if they did like to do that is
33:30
understandable that people assume that
33:32
was where the name came from i don't
33:33
think they did it
33:36
so just making that clear it was said
33:38
that they did but of course was that
33:40
just rumor mongering by a rival sex uh
33:42
it was rumored
33:44
amongst um the whole of the catholic
33:46
church really because everyone hated
33:48
them why did everyone hate them um they
33:50
were very popular in the south of france
33:52
um at the time um but they had um they
33:55
had different views to the rest of the
33:56
catholic church and one of the main ones
33:58
being that there were two gods one good
34:01
one and one evil one like a satan and a
34:03
normal god
34:05
and that was something that was
34:06
completely thought to be a terrible
34:08
thing by the vatican and so they um
34:10
tried to put them down in any way they
34:12
could and it wasn't just by killing them
34:13
it was also by saying that they like to
34:15
kiss cat's arses
34:17
would you rather be killed or would you
34:18
rather i told me you'd like to kiss
34:19
cat's asses
34:21
would you prefer congress or
34:23
congress
34:26
they were so it was also spread i think
34:28
that they were sodomites wasn't it which
34:30
was really unfair that was like the most
34:32
common accusation that was leveled at
34:34
them because they didn't like
34:37
i think sex from the front was how i
34:40
read it described somewhere because they
34:41
thought all sex to procreate was sinful
34:43
because i think they thought that
34:44
bringing anything into a world that was
34:45
so full of sin was was not a good thing
34:48
um so people just went well if you're
34:49
not having sex on the front you must be
34:50
doing it from the back and we're against
34:52
that
34:54
in fact i was wondering because i came
34:55
across this researching your fact where
34:57
the word bugger comes from it's in
34:58
bulgaria yes i think it was either
35:00
catholic or there was another sec that
35:01
was similar in bulgaria the bugger mills
35:04
was it yeah um and they were the same
35:05
they were like we're so pure we don't
35:07
believe in having sex to procreate and
35:08
so everyone went well that must mean
35:10
that you're having anal sex and that's
35:11
where we get bugger
35:13
yeah wow yeah i did not know this um
35:16
it's a it's a weird it's an interesting
35:18
time as well because
35:19
they're sort of around the 1200s 1300s
35:21
and so forth and so they are kind of
35:23
they're this hot new sex that's gaining
35:25
momentum hot sex hot sex
35:28
they seem to be quite an ancient sect as
35:30
well suddenly they gain momentum yeah
35:32
and i think they end up being a bit of a
35:34
right but bit too much of a threat to
35:35
the catholics yes and so the catholic
35:37
church use both violence horribly
35:40
murdering all of them and then also
35:42
propaganda because the best way yeah the
35:43
best way to you know destroy someone's
35:45
credibility is to yeah basically just
35:48
unless they really did just read an
35:49
advert that said hot new sex
35:51
and then it was next to an advert
35:53
advertising hot new sets and they got
35:55
confused between the two and one was an
35:57
anal sex i had one was uh
36:00
what magazines do you read
36:01
[Laughter]
36:03
um i read and i
36:05
so i don't know if this is true of the
36:06
catholics there was one blog that said
36:07
it was true of the cathars and it was
36:10
definitely true of the manichaeans which
36:12
were quite similar also dualistic sex
36:15
they believed that they were good
36:17
heavenly particles that were trapped in
36:19
plants and trees and uh they thought
36:21
that the way we could get the good
36:23
heavenly particles to go back up to
36:24
heaven it was our human duty to eat
36:27
plants and trees and then expel their
36:30
heavenly
36:31
air by farting and burping and by every
36:34
time you farted or you burped then that
36:36
was sending the good particles back up
36:38
to heaven where they belong so you were
36:39
doing your godly duty would you fart in
36:41
the direction of heaven
36:43
maybe you had to yeah stick your bum in
36:45
the air maybe that's where the other
36:46
rumors came around
36:49
our father who art in heaven
36:53
wow that sounded like an interesting
36:55
bunch yeah they were they had quite good
36:58
gender roles didn't they um they thought
37:01
that you would be reincarnated all the
37:03
time but they thought that men could be
37:04
reincarnated into women and women could
37:06
be reincarnated into men so they didn't
37:08
really see any differences between the
37:09
two sexes yeah because this is a period
37:11
in history where women get a
37:13
a bum deal
37:15
i think it was the cats that were
37:16
getting a bum deal exactly
37:18
it's eve who is responsible for the fall
37:20
adam was just like a slightly clumsy
37:22
human who were a bit taken in but eve is
37:24
the one who gets punished so she has a
37:26
menstrual cycle given to her and pain
37:28
and during childbirth yeah it's a kind
37:30
of a slightly misogynistic theology we
37:32
took a lot of flack
37:34
but the ultimate villain in the bible
37:36
story so yeah adam was okay eve was kind
37:38
of evil but the obviously the real bad
37:40
guy in genesis was a snake
37:42
according to most people but there was a
37:44
christian sect called the office and
37:46
they were snake worshippers and they
37:48
actually believed that the snake was a
37:50
good guy because god was trying to
37:52
withhold from adam and eve the truth and
37:55
wisdom about the world and the snake was
37:57
there and like offered the apple and
37:58
said look and revealed wisdom and truth
38:00
to them uh their equivalent of the
38:02
eucharist was they'd arranged bread on a
38:03
table and then they'd have to charm a
38:05
snake and lure it to the table and then
38:07
they'd kiss the snake and then they'd
38:09
eat the bread so that could be what we
38:10
were doing kissing the snake doesn't
38:12
sound well first of all it sounds like a
38:14
euphemism second of all it doesn't sound
38:16
like a very good thing to be doing
38:17
something just doesn't mean yeah
38:19
that's why the sec died out and didn't
38:20
make it just stick to this lovely eel
38:22
wearing mascara instead but in america
38:25
at the moment there are sort of i think
38:26
there are kind of cults or maybe not
38:28
cults but sort of like extreme christian
38:30
sex well they do do snake charming and
38:32
snake worship i think in the deep south
38:34
do you think for the same reason i think
38:36
that's where that comes from yeah um
38:38
there's definitely a similar place in
38:40
greece um if i can find it yeah it's
38:43
just south of macedonia
38:45
hey
38:47
that again sounds like a euphemism yeah
38:49
exactly
38:50
um there's this thing they do on a greek
38:52
on the greek island of kefalonia and
38:54
it's to celebrate the falling asleep of
38:56
the virgin mary which is apparently just
38:57
the death of the virgin mary and there's
38:59
this village where every year a whole
39:01
bunch of snakes enter the church and
39:03
slither up to the virgin mary whose
39:05
statue is at the front and then slither
39:07
onto her heart and the snakes and then
39:08
slither away and apparently it's bad
39:11
luck if they don't do this every year so
39:13
before world war ii broke out the snakes
39:15
didn't do it i've tried to find like a
39:17
journalist
39:20
because that is a massive turn up for
39:22
the history books
39:23
everyone thought it was the poland thing
39:25
but no it was snakes and things you
39:27
learned on this podcast in the
39:28
catalonian church but if anyone's been
39:30
there and seen the snakes do this thing
39:32
every year slithering into the church
39:34
then um i want to know about it because
39:36
i want pictures 15th of august i want to
39:38
go to that time cool um another sect
39:40
that i like is the carpo creations uh
39:43
second century religious sex who i just
39:45
like because they thought that um you
39:46
would be reborn constantly they believed
39:49
that man had to experience everything
39:51
that was possible to experience on earth
39:53
so had to pass through every condition
39:55
of earthly life before we could go up to
39:57
heaven and didn't have to be
39:57
reincarnated anymore so they decided
39:59
that they had to just do as much as they
40:01
could like commit as many sins as they
40:03
could in their lives you know sleep as
40:04
many people as they could it always
40:06
seemed to be good stuff actually so they
40:08
just lived this incredibly hedonistic
40:09
life saying the only way i'm going to
40:10
heaven
40:11
is if i tick off it's fun isn't it well
40:14
there are a lot of things that can be
40:15
done in a human life and not all in the
40:17
fun you know return that's quite boring
40:19
so i think they might have just sort of
40:20
sidestepped that yeah the argument i
40:22
think it's just drinking and sex
40:23
actually yeah
40:25
well the other thing is you have a list
40:27
of everything that there is possible to
40:29
do and of course you put the sex and the
40:30
drinking at the top and the tax return
40:32
at the end yeah it's the people who
40:33
lived to 120 years old who were going oh
40:36
i'm up to tax returns now
40:40
that's an amazing bucket list though
40:41
isn't it everything that could ever
40:42
happen ever yeah
40:45
okay um kissing cat's anuses yeah um one
40:49
group of things that do kiss cats anuses
40:51
are other cats
40:53
because when you have a newborn kitten
40:55
uh it must be stimulated to urinate and
40:57
defecate so its mother will lick its
40:59
anus to stimulate valley yeah
41:02
that's good isn't it i've forgotten that
41:04
that's really so they wouldn't know to
41:06
urinate if a mother forgot to lick its
41:08
kittens anus the kitten would just
41:10
explode with whales like tycho brahe
41:14
yeah that is a niche reference that's
41:16
very good
41:17
there'll be people listening to this who
41:18
got that reference we talked about him
41:21
talking about him he was a danish
41:22
astronomer and with a silver nose with a
41:25
silver nose he lost the tip of his nose
41:27
in a duel
41:28
that died falling downstairs drunk yeah
41:30
which is amazing and then one other
41:32
thing about uh kissing the anus of a cat
41:35
yeah um kiss the anus of a black cat is
41:38
the name of a band from ghent
41:41
yeah they sound good don't they wow but
41:43
that's a good name for a band kiss the
41:44
anus of a black cat yeah yeah i mean
41:47
it's not signing up to your label
41:50
maybe do you think that was a a nod to
41:52
the cathars do you think it's not to
41:54
witches i think yeah i was gonna say
41:55
because demonology and heresy at the
41:57
time it was believed that um satan would
41:59
take the form of a black cat that's
42:00
right which is why it was believed that
42:02
the the kissing of the bum hole that the
42:04
catholics were alleged to have done was
42:05
believed to be worshipping of satan i
42:07
think you know that you're worshiping
42:08
the wrong guy when he makes you kiss his
42:10
anus yeah it's like this other sect at
42:12
drinking and having sex all the time
42:20
well that is an obscene fact
42:24
speaking of anuses oh good i don't have
42:26
a link because i wanted to talk about
42:29
like etymology that we've got wrong um
42:31
and that we should start spelling things
42:33
like sovereign differently so we've
42:35
added the g into sovereign wrongly um
42:38
because that comes from the latin super
42:39
anus which means highest one and there's
42:42
no g anywhere in that and we've just
42:44
assumed at some point that it's related
42:45
to reigning and so we've called it um
42:48
we should be calling the queen the super
42:50
anus
42:51
yeah she's the super anus that we cannot
42:53
broadcast
42:55
i am in favor of free speech can i just
42:57
say as well that sounds like the best
42:58
superhero ever
43:01
anus
43:02
i don't know what he does he fires
43:05
lasers out of his eyes
43:11

no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
01:06
coming to you from the qi offices in
01:07
cover and garden my name is dan
01:09
schreiber i'm sitting here with andy
01:10
murray anna chiczynski and james harkin
01:13
once again we've gathered around the
01:14
microphone with our four favorite facts
01:16
from the last seven days
01:17
and in no particular order here we go
01:19
starting with fact number one
01:21
andy hunter murray my fact is that there
01:24
have been three
01:25
top 50 songs in the british charts which
01:27
have been sung exclusively in latin
01:30
wow i bet you on all three of them don't
01:31
yeah i do yeah just on
01:33
just a mixtape of three latin songs yeah
01:36
uh one of them actually made it into the
01:38
allen partridge movie last night oh
01:39
really
01:40
yeah yeah yeah which was uh gaudete by
01:42
steel iceman
01:43
which is a religious unfortunately
01:45
they're all a bit um religious rather
01:47
than
01:48
an abba song which they just happened to
01:49
fancy doing in latin so
01:51
i didn't know we got religious songs in
01:52
our chart in our pop chart and our top
01:54
40
01:54
pops yeah they're just choirs
01:57
constantly um anyway the other ones one
02:00
was from evita in 1976 which is
02:02
coral in latin another was a recording
02:04
of paju from andrew lloyd
02:06
webber's requiem that's a fantastic song
02:09
right so two of these are and
02:10
is the other one from avita you said yes
02:13
so two of them are andrew lloyd webber
02:14
songs two of the three latin songs at
02:16
andrew lloyd webber right
02:18
it visa being in android weather yeah
02:20
yeah
02:21
so there you go well well done well done
02:23
drew so yeah it's it's just
02:24
interesting the sort of the things that
02:26
get into the pop charts over the years
02:27
yeah yeah and it was it's easier now to
02:30
get things in the pop chats because you
02:31
can just
02:32
everyone can download something at the
02:34
same time and then it can get in the
02:35
chats whereas in the olden days you
02:37
actually had to release a
02:38
record or a cd or something for it to
02:40
get in the chats
02:41
because these days you could get a very
02:43
popular person on the radio saying
02:44
everyone download the latin song and it
02:46
would just yeah you're right it doesn't
02:48
need to be um
02:48
the taylor swift album that came out uh
02:51
last year
02:52
they accidentally on the itunes
02:54
downloads included
02:55
a track just of white noise and because
02:58
it just
02:58
went viral everyone bought it and it
03:00
went to the top of the charts in canada
03:05
[Laughter]
03:10
so you know that uh the mel gibson film
03:13
the passion
03:14
was in a mix of aramaic and latin yeah
03:17
it turns out that the latin that they
03:19
used in the passion of the christ is
03:21
church latin and not classical latin
03:23
which means the entire thing is
03:25
an anachronism that's funny i'm really
03:28
really pleased by that
03:29
they pronounce their v's as w's i don't
03:32
know i don't know how much we do know
03:33
about the pronunciation of
03:35
i think the general consensus is the um
03:37
classical latin it was pronounced as a w
03:39
and then um church latin it's a v and if
03:41
they screwed that up wow they fell at
03:43
the first hurdle yeah
03:45
so some chat trivia yeah uh which
03:48
day of the week has had the most um
03:51
songs written about it so it's in the
03:53
title oh okay
03:55
uh monday yeah monday that's the
03:59
oh well you're all wrong it's sunday
04:03
30 songs with the word sunday and so 30
04:06
songs with sunday and 23 was saturday
04:08
11 with friday which is a third and only
04:11
one song this is in the billboard charts
04:13

04:14
with the word thursday in the title you
04:15
won yeah
04:17
sweet thursday by johnny mathis in 1962
04:20
okay my this my favorite fact about the
04:22
charts
04:23
okay uh it is that paul mccartney
04:27
has had 200 songs in the charts so
04:30
either beetle songs wing song solo songs
04:32
songs that he's written for other people
04:34
um if you take the amount of time
04:38
and accumulate all the time that those
04:40
200 songs are spent in the charts they
04:41
add up to 32 years
04:43
right that's amazing oh he's had these
04:47
he's had songs in the charts that are
04:50
for a longer period than i've been alive
04:51
by two years
04:52
that's pretty good that's insane yeah
04:54
and you know who i found out that fact
04:56
from
04:56
president obama wow yeah well is
04:59
president obama just tweeting factoids
05:01
yeah he's going oh yeah he runs omg
05:03
they've just signed him up there
05:04
yeah yeah goodman no he paul mccartney
05:07
won the gershwin prize at the
05:09
white house where they do and he gave a
05:11
speech and he said here's an interesting
05:12
fact about paul
05:13
and then told that well i see do you
05:15
think that was original research from
05:18
research um i have a thing about lassen
05:21
which i wanted to tell you because i
05:22
really really like it
05:23
um when pope benedict the 16th
05:26
resigned one of the the journalists who
05:29
broke the story
05:31
only got it because she could understand
05:33
the latin in which he made the
05:35
announcement
05:36
right and as a result she got the scoop
05:38
before anybody else her name was
05:39
giovanna
05:40
chiri oh she must been very cheery about
05:43
that
05:43
it was a weird one wasn't it because
05:45
they would he was just doing a general
05:47
talk to about six or seven journalists
05:49
and they were just talking about basic
05:50
stuff
05:51
they all understood what he was saying
05:52
was being translated and then he spoke
05:53
that bit
05:54
in latin that particular bit she was the
05:57
only one who got it
05:58
and she kind of pre-announced it without
06:00
confirmation she was lucky she was right
06:02
because she yeah
06:02
she was a bit like i'm not sure if he
06:04
did i'm pretty sure he did just say that
06:06
did that word mean resign
06:07
or olive yeah
06:09
[Laughter]
06:12
i just wanted an olive guy but it's an
06:14
interesting thing they um because latin
06:16
in the vatican obviously is still a big
06:17
thing they're constantly updating
06:19
because of all the new words that we
06:20
have yeah that's so good have we spoken
06:22
about that particular thing
06:23
like words like dishwasher are now in
06:26
the new latin dictionary
06:27
and so are uh web there is worldwide
06:30
are they quite behind if they've only
06:32
just updated it with this roster i mean
06:34
about an iphone and rush hour which i
06:37
don't know
06:38
when that movie made it to the vatican
06:39
but that's only just got it and this one
06:42
that's been released
06:43
um speaking of pope benedict have we
06:44
spoken about the fact that he released a
06:46
top he released a christmas album didn't
06:49
he a christmas music album
06:50
and he so in 2009 before we resigned he
06:52
released a christmas music album uh it
06:54
was prayers set to classical music
06:56
and it was with snoop dogg's record
06:58
label that's it
06:59
wow geffen records snoop dogg
07:02
collaborates with a lot of people like
07:04
that
07:04
he did he did a song with puzzles a lot
07:06
of people like that though
07:11
no um buzz aldrin just like people who
07:14
are not in music
07:22
it was in the news a while ago that he
07:23
was going to be on carnation street but
07:24
i don't think he ever did
07:26
i think we would have heard yeah
07:30
um i was reading that jk rowling's
07:33
um obviously the philosopher's stone was
07:35
released in latin
07:37
oh yeah yeah so it's harrius potter uh
07:40
is what the book was called and it was
07:42
the philosopher's stone one
07:43
um they also translated it into ancient
07:45
greek and apparently
07:47
it's the longest ancient greek text to
07:49
have been produced since 3ad
07:52
wow oh yeah that's amazing that's
07:55
what i read wow and also
07:58
um this is interesting the book the
08:00
order of the phoenix when that came out
08:02
so just going from the idea that we had
08:04
three latin songs in a british chart in
08:06
france
08:07
when the book came out they did this
08:08
thing where they didn't pre-give the
08:10
book to different countries to translate
08:11
it they basically had to wait for the
08:13
english book to be released and then
08:14
they started translating the harry
08:15
potter books so it was a big rush to
08:17
sort of which country could get them
08:18
quicker for the demand
08:19
in france they couldn't wait for the
08:21
book to be translated
08:23
so order of the phoenix is the only
08:25
non-english sorry non-french book
08:27
to hit number one in the french
08:29
bestsellers list in france as a book
08:32
that's great just on the order of the
08:33
phoenix one as well there was this thing
08:35
in venezuela where
08:36
they knew the release date was going to
08:37
be about six months after five months
08:39
after the release of or the phoenix
08:41
they couldn't be bothered waiting and
08:42
some guy just translated it on his own
08:44
and released it and people bought it but
08:46
it by all accounts was the worst
08:48
translation
08:49
because it's packed with sentences this
08:51
is a genuine sentence from it
08:53
uh here comes something that i am unable
08:56
to translate
08:57
[Laughter]
08:59
sorry and then later on after another
09:02
sentence there's a bracket that said i'm
09:04
sorry
09:04
i don't understand what that means it's
09:07
just totally littered with the
09:09
translator
09:10
it makes it sound actually a bit more
09:11
terrifying if you're describing
09:13
something it's like this thing is
09:14
so awesome i can't even put it into
09:17
words it's it's like
09:18
another version of voldemort he cannot
09:20
be named
09:21
but literally i can't name it
09:24
sorry guys do you guys know the only new
09:27
york times bestseller
09:28
to be written in latin best-selling book
09:30
to be written in latin no
09:32
you give us a clue is it winnie the pooh
09:33
it's what yes because there was a
09:35
version of winnie the pooh and last year
09:38
yeah it was on the best seller list for
09:40
20 weeks
09:41
that's pretty good yeah it's very i
09:44
imagine there's
09:44
not much vocabulary in it so it's
09:46
probably quite good for teaching
09:47
children who are learning
09:48
yeah although the grinch um so the dr
09:51
zeus three
09:51
dr zeus books have also been translated
09:53
into latin which i would have thought
09:54
wait dr zeus or dr seuss
09:58
zeus because that would be for greek if
10:00
anything
10:01
i don't think his use was a doctor i
10:04
think he had bigger fish to fry
10:07
as well but if i said dr seuss people
10:11
would call me a [ __ ] yes i'll say dr
10:13
seuss then dr seuss i always say i say
10:16
dr
10:17
yeah anyway how the grinch stole
10:19
christmas and two others um have been
10:21
in fact okay i'll tell you the two
10:22
others and see if you know what they are
10:24
i assume some of you will catas peta
10:27
status
10:27
the cat in the hats correct and
10:30
we aren't aware exclamation mark we're
10:33
at purna oh
10:35
green eggs green ham green eggs and ham
10:39
yeah very good started it until the age
10:41
of 18 still didn't get the cat in that
10:43
one
10:51
um the latin wikipedia has 94 000
10:54
articles
10:55
is that which is amazing when you think
10:56
about it yeah i mean that's much more
10:58
than
10:59
many other languages in fact i wonder
11:00
what that features in wikipedia language
11:02
yeah and you can get facebook in latin
11:04
as well instead of the like button
11:06
there's a mihi placket
11:07
button it is
11:14
do you know the other languages that
11:16
latin almost
11:17
you know was the latin tribe was vying
11:19
with before they became the romans you
11:21
know when they were just a tiny tribe
11:23
in southern italy um they were really
11:26
cool names that volskian oscan
11:28
and phalliscan these are just other
11:30
languages doing the rounds in the area
11:32
sounds like it comes from phallus
11:34
doesn't it yeah does
11:35
penis language okay well i'm sure they
11:38
got a lot of that at school they don't
11:39
need any more of it from you guys
11:41
especially given that they lost to the
11:42
romans
11:44
embarrassing um anyway right germany i
11:46
think is the only country to have had a
11:47
number one song in elvish
11:50
um because of the rings yeah it was the
11:53
anya track
11:54
director producer promoter whatever this
11:56
is called in the business decided that
11:58
her her musical ideas were too complex
12:00
and interesting to get across
12:02
in any language that existed so they
12:04
wrote a new language for her in which
12:05
some of her other songs are sung
12:07
which is called amarantine that's enya's
12:10
language
12:11
got our own language um hey you know how
12:13
we were talking about dishwashers
12:14
earlier yeah
12:15
the latin for dishwasher um
12:18
and obviously we all know i'm terrible
12:19
with words but it's something like
12:21
eskara iorim as the first word something
12:24
like that it's not
12:25
correct lavatory oh yeah oh yeah
12:28
lavatory
12:30
larvae is it's to watch a lavatory was i
12:33
think an
12:34
ecclesiastical room for washing in in a
12:36
church or in a uh monastery or that kind
12:38
of thing a lavatory was a room where you
12:40
go have a wash
12:41
who do you think was the first person
12:43
who took a poo in there and
12:44
transformed it
12:48
father dave what have you done
12:53
it was time the room branched out
12:56
that's what happened with all the words
12:58
yeah someone just
13:00
like dave father dave this used to be a
13:02
place where we just had a bath
13:03
now the defacatorium is completely
13:05
ruined holiday
13:11
okay it's time for fact number two and
13:12
that is chozinski
13:14
my fact is that the way to recognize the
13:16
buddha is to look out for his webbed
13:18
feet
13:19
a tongue that can reach his ears and
13:21
withdrawn genitalia
13:23
that's a good excuse on a date no no
13:25
it's not small i'm just i'm the buddha
13:26
i'm the reincarnated buddha
13:28
oh yeah then show me your tongue
13:41
so yeah these are some of the
13:45
32 these are three of the 32 lakshanas
13:47
or special bodily features of the buddha
13:49
and they're what a proper representation
13:51
of the buddha must have that make him
13:53
the perfect
13:54
being so the perfect being has these
13:56
features as well as various other things
13:58
like uh 40 teeth rather than 32 and
14:01
ankle bones that are hardly noticeable
14:04
and an excellent sense of taste
14:06
it is an amazing list of characteristics
14:08
that the buddha had i mean this is
14:10
but original as well but a classic if
14:12
you will um
14:13
had thighs like a royal stag
14:17
a 10-foot aura and the area below
14:18
armpits well filled
14:22
with hair or yeah
14:25
so wait are there 32 of these there's 32
14:27
but then they're not well filled with i
14:28
think
14:30
there's an additional 80 extra little
14:32
tiny things if you wanted to look at
14:34
what's really weird is they point out
14:35
that the extra 80 things are just like
14:37
you know you've confirmed it's buddha
14:39
you know his tongue can wrap around his
14:41
ears he's got these web feet
14:43
it's definitely buddha yeah um but if
14:45
you just want to make doubly sure
14:46
that it's him there's these 80 extra
14:48
things and i read through the 80. and
14:49
they are quite simple but then one is
14:51
he can fly which
14:54
that feels like it should be the first
14:56
that'd be the first thing i'd ask him
14:57
yeah
14:58
they're so mixed as well like one of
15:00
them is he has a protruding nose number
15:02
28 of the extra 80. and the one before
15:04
it is he has the strength of a thousand
15:06
elephants
15:08
no no he doesn't he has a strength of a
15:10
thousand crore elephants and a craw
15:13
is 10 million um and so he has a
15:15
strength of 10
15:16
billion sorry that was my mistake but i
15:19
mean that the buddha
15:20
10 billion elephants that's the kind of
15:22
strength that he's wow
15:23
to be fair once you're strong enough
15:25
that you can pull 10 elephants the extra
15:27
just feels like showing off
15:28
yeah you're right number 75 in this list
15:30
of 80. so
15:32
he is either completely bald or has a
15:34
full crop of hair
15:42
[Laughter]
15:44
um so what i like about this list is
15:46
that uh it's not only just what he was
15:48
but if you're looking out for buddha as
15:50
a reincarnation
15:51
that is these are all the things that he
15:53
would have still
15:54
um and i was looking into reincarnation
15:57
just generally because we haven't had a
15:58
reincarnation of the buddha but we
15:59
obviously have the dalai lama
16:01
he's a reincarnation of so he's the 14th
16:04
i believe
16:04
he's threatening and i i don't know what
16:06
the latest update on this is he's saying
16:08
he might not
16:08
reincarnate anymore just to stick it to
16:11
the chinese yeah he's going to put it up
16:12
he's going to put it up as a vote he's
16:15
going to take a vote on it
16:16
well yeah this is the last you know that
16:19
may have changed in you know
16:20
he was speaking about it in september
16:22
last year yeah it's very recent yeah
16:23
yeah
16:24
he might not do it but um but it's so
16:26
interesting the way that they do
16:27
find the reincarnations do they not like
16:31
um give the give a child some of the old
16:33
dalai lama's
16:34
possessions and see if he likes them yes
16:36
so so there were a bunch of possessions
16:37
that were given to him
16:38
and he was picking them up saying oh
16:40
this is mine this is mine this is
16:42
it tends to be but that's if you give
16:44
children anything they say this is mine
16:46
this is mine
16:47
but they but there was a there's a bunch
16:49
of things on the uh
16:50
on the ground there was a there was a
16:52
kid um who was
16:54
told that he was a reincarnation of a
16:56
llama and
16:57
it was down to a few things like he was
16:59
able to identify the color of the
17:01
previous llama's car
17:06
and the mileage yeah what's in the glove
17:08
box then
17:09
uh some tic tacs and my gun the next
17:13
style alarm is the guy who stole my car
17:14
we did a deal
17:18
can i just ask a question about this
17:19
right yeah so this guy
17:22
is supposed to be the reincarnation of
17:24
the dalai lama
17:25
no no sorry of another there are lots of
17:27
llamas that you can be
17:28
so punch and llama yeah yeah um so uh
17:31
like for example
17:33
it's been confirmed that steven seagal
17:35
is the reincarnation of a 17th a 17th
17:38
century buddhist spirit called chong
17:40
drag
17:40
dorje when you say when you say is being
17:42
confirmed by the
17:44
by the community of like the dalai lama
17:46
by evidence people andy
17:49
right yeah so he's not obviously the
17:51
dalai lama but he is a
17:52
the um china tried to make their own
17:56
llama didn't they
17:57
um i thought it was their own dalai lama
17:58
um they they said right okay the guy
18:01
that you guys
18:02
have chosen in tibet isn't the real one
18:03
we're going to have a lottery to choose
18:05
which is the real one
18:06
and they've had a lottery like they put
18:08
a load of names in an urn and pulled one
18:09
out and it was a child
18:11
how did that go for them is
18:14
um could i just mention yogic flying yes
18:18
please because i like it
18:18
yeah uh so you know there was this big
18:20
1950s movement the transcendental
18:22
meditation movement and it was a group
18:24
of people who uh took on the idea of
18:26
the power of the frog i think it's
18:28
called in hinduism but it's philosophy
18:29
and it's the idea that you could reach a
18:31
state of meditation where you can fly
18:32
and the famously there was the natural
18:34
law party in the eighties
18:36
um where they tried to get into politics
18:38
and they would do this
18:39
flat thing yeah yeah so it's quite funny
18:42
when i think there's video footage of
18:44
the groups that tried to do it the
18:45
beatles were quite interested in it
18:46
and yogic flying has three stages um and
18:49
stage one is hopping
18:51
and stage two is floating and stage
18:53
three is flying
18:54
i can the key breach point is between
18:59
one and two though
19:00
so then you've got two your three is
19:02
probably going to be fine
19:03
so the transcendental movement itself
19:06
admits that no one in the modern era has
19:08
yet got beyond stage one
19:13
keep at it guys do you guys know have
19:16
you guys heard of druk parkunli
19:18
no he was a buddhist master in the 15th
19:21
century he was the guy who brought
19:22
buddhism to bhutan
19:24
um and he had pretty wacky methods of
19:26
like enlightening people and pretty
19:28
wacky buddhist practices um he mainly
19:31
tried his methods on women
19:32
and so he had the title the saint of the
19:34
5 000 women
19:35
among other things women would seek his
19:37
blessing in the form of sex
19:39
um he he's called the divine madman is
19:41
that the guy he's someone who's called
19:43
the divine madman his penis is called
19:44
the thunderbolt of flaming wisdom
19:46
yeah i've been anointed by it oh you
19:49
have haven't you
19:50
what what do you mean what i've um when
19:52
i've been to a
19:54
um a what do you call these like a
19:56
temple of his
19:57
and as you go in there's a priest with a
19:59
large wooden phallus and he sort of puts
20:01
it on your
20:02
each shoulder like knighting you like
20:03
the queen would well
20:06
between the queen but then it's supposed
20:09
to be like a fertility thing
20:11
god bolton's changed since i was last
20:13
there i must say
20:14
where is it okay cool that's amazing
20:18
that's what he does he's been anointed
20:20
by the phallus of the what is it called
20:21
the thunderbolt of
20:22
is the thunderbolt of flaming wisdom it
20:24
couldn't it had the power to turn
20:26
women into deities but i guess that was
20:28
the real thing i don't think james is a
20:29
god
20:30
but what happens is you walk into this
20:31
temple and the priest
20:33
approaches you with a giant phallus i i
20:36
imagine the first time that happened it
20:38
was probably brother dave again
20:41
well the houses around here they paint
20:43
palaces on their walls
20:44
as well around there around this area in
20:47
bolton
20:48
um this yeah if you go around there
20:50
there's like shops like that sell um
20:52
like local produce and they all have big
20:54
pictures of penises on the walls people
20:56
draw those on walls
20:57
right around near where i live as well
21:00
yeah
21:04
yeah what a devout place we are
21:09
maybe that's what the buddha meant when
21:10
it says withdrawn genitalia oh
21:15
my goodness
21:21

21:53
okay time for fact number three and
21:55
that's my fact and my fact this week is
21:57
that the whoopee cushion
21:58
was invented by a roman emperor called
22:01
basie anus
22:04
now that is just i've never heard of
22:05
this emperor so uh the roman emperor
22:07
ella gabilis
22:09
he is uh he's the famous that's his name
22:11
his birth name
22:12
was basianus now i'm sure it might be
22:15
pronounced
22:16
something like that but when you read it
22:18
and you find out you've invented the
22:19
whoopee cushion
22:21
i just don't know how you can't let that
22:22
go yeah basic anus
22:24
what what describe the whoopee cushion
22:27
uh well it was obviously a prototype to
22:29
what we have now
22:30
um uh he was in development hell for
22:34
nearly 2
22:34
000 years
22:38
he just used to bring a cushion that had
22:41
air in it and he would bring it to his
22:42
dinner parties
22:43
and he was only 14 or so at the time he
22:45
was a very young emperor
22:46
and uh and it just used to be his little
22:48
party trick his little
22:50
and it let let out uh while he was there
22:52
that's all we know about it really
22:54
isn't it yeah didn't it sink them yeah
22:55
it could make you rather it could be
22:57
rather that they were at a normal height
22:59
and then just got lower and more and
23:00
lower as it went on i don't know if it
23:01
made a
23:02
farting noise it might have done yeah i
23:05
think it's
23:05
i mean any you know any thing full of
23:08
air
23:08
where you've got something coming out of
23:10
a sphincter that's going to make a noise
23:12
especially because it had to come out
23:13
slowly i guess because they had to sink
23:14
gradually
23:15
it would be one of those squeaky farts
23:17
yeah that went on
23:18
forever yeah all dinner oh this is still
23:22
embarrassing
23:26
another thing ella gabilis did to dinner
23:28
guests apparently
23:29
uh is suffocated a bunch of dinner
23:30
guests under loads of rose petals
23:34
really he was a bit of a bastard but
23:35
yeah i think that's quite an imaginative
23:36
way to go about murdering your dinakes
23:38
if you do want to do that that's true
23:39
did he mean to or was that actually
23:41
he actually just wanted them to go home
23:43
it was kind of his way of hinting that
23:44
it was late
23:45
he was tired yeah he locked him in a
23:49
room didn't he and they had a fake
23:50
ceiling
23:51
and he dropped out all these um rose
23:53
petals but there were so many of them
23:54
that they all suffocated but he didn't
23:56
mean them to
23:57
i thought he was trying to kill them no
23:59
i don't know he was a total dick though
24:01
wasn't he
24:01
yeah like i don't know much about him
24:03
but from what i've read
24:05
he was a real bassy anus yeah he wasn't
24:07
a nice guy he'd
24:09
he had all these um i mean but it's one
24:11
of those ones where the stories are like
24:12
half funny as well as like the bad bits
24:15
like he kind of just used to go and
24:17
prostitute himself
24:18
in um in bars and dress as a woman and
24:20
and
24:21
and he purposely tried to piss off
24:23
people so that they would beat him up
24:25
because he had a bit of a fetish about
24:26
being beat up
24:27
and he's a very odd character the
24:29
weirdest thing i read is that
24:30
he wanted to have his dick chopped off
24:33
right and so he went to a doctor and the
24:35
doctor said
24:36
i don't want to do that and he said no
24:38
do it and they apparently they
24:40
really like thrashed out the
24:41
conversation and the compromise and this
24:43
from what i read they said they
24:44
compromised on he was circumcised
24:48
that's a hell of a compromise that's a
24:49
huge compromise
24:51
that is kind of level one of the three
24:53
hours of chopping
24:57
wait what's the third one
25:00
i think the third one is the full
25:02
absolutely total total lob off
25:04
the second one
25:06
[Laughter]
25:09
right yeah so interesting character yeah
25:12
and again it's another thing where just
25:14
even if it like for me the
25:16
enjoyable thing of the fact is that he
25:17
was called bassy anus but
25:19
actually the initial thing of the
25:20
whoopee cushion being invented as far
25:22
back as then
25:23
is like on a previous podcast when i
25:25
found out that yo-yos were being used
25:28
from that view as well it just it's so
25:29
out of place to me to think that a
25:31
whoopee cushion
25:32
was that far back in time as a practical
25:34
joke as well yeah
25:36
yeah you know the whoopee cushion when
25:37
it had its first 20th century
25:39
um origin wasn't actually called a
25:40
whoopee cushion it was
25:42
called a musical seat in 1926 and it
25:45
didn't really make a fart noise either
25:47
so it wasn't very good but
25:48
it didn't make music well in the
25:49
catalogue it says sounds like you sat on
25:51
a cat
25:52
it made this weird little scream um
25:55
it was quite upsetting to hear
25:57
apparently like a screeching cat or a
25:59
crying child um
26:00
and they it was invented and then then
26:02
initially it was called the poopoo
26:04
cushion
26:05
or the boop boop these are not good
26:08
names
26:08
but when they hit on the name whoopee
26:10
cushion which was only in 1932 that was
26:12
after the slang term whoopee
26:14
making whoopee as a slang term for
26:15
having sex so the whoopee cushion is
26:17
named after sex
26:18
so it was a sex cushion what so who made
26:20
that catch
26:21
yeah well there was a hit song in 1928
26:24
called making whoopee
26:25
yeah and i think who's called the
26:27
whoopee cushion a few years later
26:28
and i think whoopi then became just
26:30
having fun
26:31
yeah and then okay that makes more sense
26:35
so um soren sorensen adams who was a
26:38
very famous
26:39
joke developer the ss adams coat loads
26:42
of stuff like the the
26:44
insect in an ice cube and the the the
26:46
flower that squirts stuff out
26:48
yeah all of all of these really classic
26:49
jokes a lot of them were invented by him
26:51
and but he turned down the woodpecker
26:53
initially because he thought it was
26:54
indelicate
26:55
and then he realized his mistake soon
26:58
after it was you know to become a big
26:59
success and he made his own one which
27:00
was called the raspberry cushion
27:02
okay yeah yeah um but he also invented
27:05
the joy buzzer
27:06
which is the hand buzzer exactly yeah
27:08
okay i just wanna
27:09
you know when you shake hands with
27:10
someone and there's a buzzer in there
27:12
and it's a little electric shock or
27:13
something
27:14
it's actually just a vibration isn't it
27:16
yeah um
27:17
but i just want to read you this it was
27:18
modeled after another product the zapper
27:21
which was similar to the joy buzzer but
27:22
did not have a very effective buzz
27:24
and contained a button that had a blunt
27:26
point that would hurt the person whose
27:28
hand was shaken
27:31
just a mini knife basically that just
27:35
got you really good with that one
27:36
yeah i'll get the bandages yeah what a
27:38
funny prank i just stabbed you in the
27:39
chest
27:41
now just stand underneath all these rose
27:43
petals
27:44
hey smell my flower it's a gun
27:48
so sirens and adams he started off um
27:51
with
27:51
itching powder no sneezing powder
27:54
okay yeah and he worked for a company
27:57
that made this whatever product it was
28:00
and they had this dust
28:01
left over from the product and he
28:03
noticed that people were sneezing from
28:04
it
28:05
and so then he thought oh this is a
28:07
great prank i can make this and sell it
28:09
and he
28:09
started selling loads and loads of the
28:11
sneezing powder and became really big
28:13
um it was called kachoo and his first
28:16
year he sold fifteen thousand dollars
28:17
worth
28:18
um but 25 years later the fda banned it
28:21
as a toxic
28:22
substance so for all that time he'd been
28:24
poisoning people as well as making them
28:26
sneeze oh wow it was genuinely toxic
28:28
yeah
28:28
oh that's quite funny that is health and
28:30
safety got mad another thing they used
28:31
was itching powder wasn't it in world
28:33
war
28:33
ii and it came this is there was an idea
28:35
to plant itching powder on
28:37
nazis in various ways and um on the on
28:40
the like instructions that were given to
28:41
people who are trying to infiltrate and
28:42
plant this
28:43
it said the greatest effect is produced
28:45
by applying the powder to the inside of
28:47
the underclothing
28:48
so i don't know how it was intended to
28:50
get wow yeah exactly
28:51
i think when they were pitching that in
28:53
the meeting they said okay so let me
28:54
guess right you've made it right up
28:56
to a nazi
28:59
you got your gun on here okay so now i
29:02
want you to take out the gun and just
29:04
use it to apply a bit of the itching
29:05
powder
29:06
to his under clothes be careful
29:09
uh in world war one they had sneezing
29:11
powder the germans this is
29:13
uh and it didn't do you that much harm
29:15
apart from
29:16
it made you sneeze so it made you take
29:18
off your gas mask and then they'd be
29:19
able to get you with the other stuff
29:23
okay why did you take up your gas mask
29:25
when you sneeze
29:26
you don't want to get spit on anything
29:27
it was like it would kind of just get in
29:30
their eyes and
29:31
in the nose and stuff they just needed
29:32
fresh air okay okay
29:34
wow um the man who invented the fart
29:36
machine much later than
29:38
the whoopee cushion um he tried to
29:40
record the sounds with his friend his
29:41
name was fred jarrow
29:42
and uh he and his friend john blackman
29:44
who was developing it they tried to
29:45
recall it by going into a recording
29:47
studio
29:48
after having eaten lots of fart causing
29:50
food like cabbage and beans and things
29:51
and they said it didn't work
29:52
it didn't sound right yeah what did the
29:54
people around them say
29:56
you're never using this recording studio
29:58
again what did they use in the end for
30:00
the sound
30:00
synthesizer oh yeah wow okay oh yeah
30:04
like my old yamaha didn't have a fart
30:06
but
30:11
and also here's the thing a synthesizer
30:13
uses recordings
30:14
of sounds exactly so it must have got it
30:17
from somewhere else originally yeah
30:19
all right i don't know the full details
30:21
on this one i'm going to fess up
30:22
i think that i think they use i think
30:23
they used existing sounds and slowed
30:25
them down and sped them up
30:26
you know made them okay yeah yeah yeah
30:29
okay that makes sense
30:31
yeah um one more
30:34
prankster was jim morin in america who
30:36
was born in 1907. he lived until 1999.
30:38
he was called america's number one
30:40
prankster
30:41
and he did lots of you know fun crazy
30:44
pranks like he he
30:45
uh walked a bull through a china shop
30:47
once he did this kind of thing
30:49
he also looked for a needle in a
30:50
haystack in 1939 and it took him
30:52
82 hours before he found it but who's
30:55
that a gel comb
30:57
no yeah himself isn't it it was near the
30:59
bottom and slightly to the left of
31:00
center
31:01
um but this i love so much about it
31:03
pranksters tried to set fire to the
31:05
haystack five times while he was in it
31:08
uh out pranking the prankster joke's on
31:10
him
31:12
kinda try to how do you fail to light
31:16
hey
31:28
so if he put it there yeah that's a very
31:31
good point
31:32
well he must have thrown it in and then
31:33
it must have fallen through no i think
31:34
he would have got a friend to put it in
31:36
here yeah
31:37
i'm amazed he had friends
31:46
okay time for our final fact of the show
31:48
and that
31:49
is james okay my fact this week
31:53
is that the oldest known purse
31:56
is decorated with dog's teeth
32:00
okay so it's very old bling this is
32:04
um found in a grave uh dated to 2500 bc
32:09
and it was a leather pouch uh decorated
32:12
with dog's teeth uh in a nice little
32:14
pattern
32:15
uh but over the years the leather has
32:16
disappeared so that all was left was the
32:18
teeth
32:19
cool well they've kind of worked out
32:21
that it must have been uh
32:22
must have been a purse rather than a dog
32:26
it was decorated in the shape of a dog's
32:28
mouth
32:31
and next to it was like a bum bag whip
32:34
decorated with dogs
32:35
skeletons
32:39
yeah that's really interesting i guess
32:40
they use what they could find yeah
32:42
what were they carrying back then um i
32:45
don't know really you would carry
32:47
let's say you'd carry more dog's teeth
32:52
or some food or some you know a tool or
32:54
something
32:55
yeah um so this is according to harold
32:58
stauble the senior archaeologist at
33:01
germany's saxon state archaeology office
33:04
and he thinks that it was very
33:05
fashionable at the time to decorate um
33:07
these handbags with dog's teeth uh
33:10
because he says that not everyone was
33:11
buried with them it was only people of
33:12
high status
33:16
quite good high status people who are
33:18
catching dogs
33:19
yeah maybe that was a sign of your i
33:20
mean what meant high status
33:22
3000 years ago yeah where where what
33:25
like civilization are we talking about
33:26
uh what's happening
33:29
um i do like that we've humans have like
33:32
wanted to
33:33
adorn ourselves since as long as we know
33:35
they've existed
33:36
basically and we're just fine finding
33:38
underscores as well didn't they
33:40
they had like little trinkets and stuff
33:42
they were buried with yeah
33:44
like i think the oldest i think maybe
33:46
until 2006 the oldest jewelry we had
33:49
were snail shells weren't they from
33:50
about 75 yeah i want to say 75
33:53
000 years ago um and we found them in a
33:55
in a
33:56
cave in south africa um and it was just
33:58
like little holes drilled in snail
34:00
shells which they think they used to
34:01
hook them into their
34:02
some bit of their body um in the bible
34:04
judas is specifically identified as the
34:06
guy who was carrying the purse
34:08
see yeah well he was given money in the
34:11
purse wasn't he was given 30 pieces of
34:12
silver and that's true
34:14
i thought that was it what wasn't his
34:16
name
34:18
well he took if um if jesus was given
34:21
anything
34:21
um so it says in uh john's gospel judas
34:24
had the purse into which was put
34:25
whatsoever was ministered to christ
34:27
so it was the he was the he was the
34:29
banker as always when playing monopoly
34:31
as in the bible don't trust the banker
34:37
he's cheating that'd be a good actual
34:39
version of monopoly
34:40
where you have to betray one of them one
34:42
of the other players who's then
34:43
crucified
34:44
[Laughter]
34:46
um that must be why so judas iscariot
34:48
the name iscariot comes from the latin
34:50
scorpio
34:52
which is a purse or a bag used to carry
34:54
money yeah so maybe that do you think
34:55
that's where the word scrotum comes from
34:57
i wonder i bet it is so was he mr
35:00
moneybags
35:01
i guess it was mr moneybag
35:04
no wonder he was resentful guys it means
35:06
moneybags
35:09
and you'll see you'll see yeah yeah
35:11
judas
35:12
yes yeah yes crazy well scrotums have
35:15
been used
35:16
as purses um people they use them like
35:19
in australia you can buy like kangaroo
35:20
scrotums yeah that's right that's really
35:22
big at the moment yeah
35:24
yeah it is yeah apparently the best one
35:26
is a w-shaped
35:27
kangaroo scrotum purse and that is kind
35:30
of if you can imagine the two
35:32
bits where the testicles go uh rather
35:34
than being attached like
35:35
web toes might be they're kind of more
35:38
um like a w shape is that so you can
35:40
keep different things in the different
35:41
i think it's just because they're rare
35:42
it's like one in ten thousand
35:44
um kangaroo scrotum shaped like this
35:46
it's like a lucky four-leaf clover yeah
35:48
except for the kangaroo
35:52
speaking of designer um handbags and
35:54
stuff like that um
35:56
women's uh handbags are much women's
35:59
bags are much more expensive than men's
36:01
bags no matter what they look like or
36:02
anything
36:03
so there was um there's a purse blog run
36:06
by someone called amanda mull and she
36:08
looked at all the different things that
36:09
you could
36:10
the things that you could buy and she
36:11
found that for two bags which are
36:13
virtually identical one for women and
36:15
one for men
36:15
and the woman's one cost 2.96 a cubic
36:18
inch
36:19
and the men's one costs 1.54 a cubic
36:22
inch
36:22
and they're pretty much identical so the
36:24
idea is basically they just charge more
36:25
because it's aimed at a woman
36:27
um so on designer bags louis vuitton
36:30
apparently burns all of his bags that
36:33
he's made that year not him personally
36:35
gets someone to burn all the bags he's
36:37
made that year so they don't get
36:38
sold on the cheap the next year because
36:40
it devalues the items
36:42
wow so all the ones that haven't been
36:43
sold in the shop so first of all they
36:45
have an in-house private louis vuitton
36:47
sale for louis vuitton staff so people
36:49
can buy like slightly reduced price
36:50
and then but they keep tabs on who's
36:52
bought them so they can track them so if
36:54
one of them appears on ebay
36:55
louie is going to be like you put this
36:57
on ebay that's not cool
36:58
so you can give one as a gift i think
37:00
and then he burns all the rest make sure
37:01
doesn't devalue the brand
37:02
that is insane it's pretty mental yeah
37:05
that's why he's never made anything of
37:07
himself
37:09
are there any other careers in which he
37:10
would just set fire to all your stuff at
37:12
the end of the well it kind of reminds
37:14
me a bit not setting fire to it but a
37:15
bit like what the bears did with
37:17
diamonds in that they deliberately don't
37:19
sell them to keep the prices high yeah
37:21
they used to do
37:21
that and grain i mean it's the same
37:23
thing with grain isn't it to stop grain
37:24
prices from going nuts i'm not very good
37:26
at understanding this don't we have huge
37:28
stocks of grain that go rotten every
37:29
year i like butter mountains and all
37:31
that kind of thing
37:32
yeah there is a new year's ritual
37:34
somewhere where you uh
37:36
write down you make little pieces of
37:39
paper sculpture basically on which you
37:40
have already written
37:41
things that you didn't really enjoy
37:43
about last year and then you set fire to
37:44
them at midnight it's quite fun i tried
37:45
that one yeah
37:46
did you set a fire to the house it was
37:49
so much that you were unhappy with
37:51
yeah so the year always begins with a
37:53
big insurance claim
37:55
and then that's the first item in the
37:56
next year's list
37:58
that's a thing in china as well that you
38:00
write down a confession
38:02
and you do on three separate bits of
38:04
paper and then you light the confession
38:05
up and it's it's
38:06
it's a way of almost a priest saying
38:08
right that must be bad if your lighter
38:10
runs out
38:11
and you've written something really
38:12
dodgy like oh my god oh god
38:15
i'll go is there a reason why it's three
38:18
do you know
38:19
uh i'm not sure i saw it on the carl
38:20
pilkington idiot abroad
38:22
because you grew up in china
38:24
[Laughter]
38:26
you know that handbag originally meant a
38:28
bit of luggage for a man
38:30
the original handbags were for men yeah
38:33
and then it only became a women's
38:35
specific item in
38:36
1841 i think didn't it yes really
38:38
recently and do you know who
38:39
invented it the guy who invented the
38:41
handbag also invented butterscotch
38:44
samuel parkinson yeah wow that is two
38:47
cool things to invent
38:48
this isn't it yeah yeah it is cool so he
38:50
came donkat it's from doncaster well
38:52
done doncaster so
38:53
what's happening um
38:56
and yeah so he introduced handbags as uh
38:59
women's eye specific women's item
39:00
because before women only had those
39:01
reticules which are like those tiny
39:03
drawstring bags that you could basically
39:04
fit an earring in
39:05
and he said he wrote to a designer and
39:07
was like my wife needs to travel on a
39:08
train
39:09
uh my wife
39:13
so i looked up a few of the oldest
39:14
things that we that we know of in
39:16
particular different fields
39:17
okay um so the oldest copy of a gospel
39:20
was found inside the mask of a mummy
39:23
oh wasn't that really recent yeah really
39:26
recently that was discovered and it was
39:27
basically they made
39:28
all these things that it was made out of
39:30
papyrus which were then basically turned
39:31
into papier-mache
39:33
um and all kinds of different things
39:35
were used all kinds of texts we used to
39:36
make mummy's mask so
39:37
there were business papers and just
39:39
personal letters or biblical documents
39:41
like
39:42
the do you think it was something for
39:43
them to read
39:46
it was the google glass of its day
39:50
oh that would be awful i'm getting so
39:52
tired of this
39:53
yeah in the beginning [ __ ] will somebody
39:56
turn the page
40:00
sorry go away and um so greek text
40:02
things like homer's odyssey would be
40:04
used
40:05
as as the contents of a papier-mache
40:08
papyrus mask
40:09
wow so strange oh you never think of
40:11
that what what did they make it out of
40:13
yeah yeah that's really just any old
40:15
paper it seems they just they just use
40:17
it they can read it now by taking the
40:18
mask apart it's like
40:19
today's headlines are tomorrow's papier
40:22
mache
40:25
it's probably a saying in those days
40:26
yeah and when you go to the fish and
40:27
chip shop they give you a mummy's mask
40:29
[Laughter]
40:33
the world's oldest human footprints
40:34
outside africa does anyone get any
40:36
guesses on where they are yeah just on
40:38
the border leaving africa
40:44
um they're on a beach in england yeah
40:46
they're in norfolk
40:47
hang on they're on a beach what the thai
40:49
just never came in and washed them away
40:50
basically they are it's quite tricky
40:53
they were they were indentations
40:54
in the not in the rock but in the
40:58
it's it's sand yeah it's not in this
41:01
it's not like the beach the water is
41:03
just missing
41:04
millions um no it's really hard i read
41:08
an entire article about this and it's
41:10
kind of vague
41:10
but they were on the beach they have now
41:12
been washed away but they were
41:14
indentations in the beach somehow which
41:17
resembled footprints i have no idea how
41:18
they dated them as well but
41:20
they are eight hundred thousand years
41:21
old that's the amazing thing i thought
41:23
it was basically
41:24
the idea of mud and then the mud dried
41:26
kept them and then
41:27
a beach uh what they discovered was the
41:29
sand on the beach kind of disappeared
41:31
and revealed them
41:32
yes that is that's exactly yeah yeah
41:34
yeah eight hundred thousand
41:36
yes that is amazing but there are places
41:38
in the uk where you can see
41:40
um footprints of dinosaurs in the same
41:43
way which have been like where the
41:44
the mud's hardened it's amazing it's so
41:48
cool
41:48
and they they only had a very short
41:50
space of time to get to
41:52
get imprints of these before they were
41:53
washed away by rain and by the
41:55
the effects of the waves um and there
41:57
was one adult and five children with him
41:59
that's all we that's all we know about
42:01
these footprints or this this family or
42:02
whoever it was wow
42:04
yeah how cool is that it's good so um
42:07
dog's teeth were used as currency in
42:08
papua new guinea until as recently as
42:10
1960.
42:12
what yeah that's amazing
42:15
in 1876 um we know how what you could
42:18
get for so many teeth
42:20
uh you could get a bride for a hundred
42:22
dogs teeth
42:23
that was like the the price of a dowry
42:25
wow uh
42:26
dogs really like there's not many there
42:29
or
42:30
um don't know really i guess because
42:33
like
42:33
if you're like going out for dinner and
42:36
you're going oh we should probably pick
42:37
up the bill tonight
42:39
how much how many dog teeth should we
42:41
bring should we bring rover with us just
42:43
in case
42:44
like like could you is it was it special
42:46
type of teeth well i think it is
42:48
and i might be wrong about this but
42:49
teeth have been and animal bones
42:50
especially been used
42:52
forever as things to like cut or to
42:55
you know they they're useful tools
42:57
because they're hard and you can do
42:58
things
42:58
yeah so i reckon it's quite often
43:01
currencies are made out of things that
43:02
are useful
43:03
and then they trade them and then they
43:04
become a currency so i bet it's probably
43:06
something like that okay that's
43:07
interesting
43:07
although when you say 100 dogs teeth
43:10
that is ambiguous is it the teeth of a
43:12
hundred dogs
43:13
oh no it was a hundred teeth where's the
43:15
apostrophe in that there was a
43:16
philosophy
43:17
yeah no it's a hundred teeth a hundred
43:20
teeth come from dogs
43:21
so you don't wanna accidentally murder a
43:23
hundred dogs and realize you only needed
43:24
to do
43:25
three or something darling we're rich
43:31
that's great have we got any more shall
43:32
we wrap up i'm done
43:34
the oldest penis in the world
43:38
the oldest penis is a hundred million
43:40
years old what
43:41
is it dinosaurs it belonged
43:44
to an ostracod which is an early kind of
43:48
crustacean and it was found on a fossil
43:49
of that
43:50
and uh some scientists found it and they
43:52
analyzed it um one of them was professor
43:54
david sivita of the university of
43:56
leicester
43:56
and it was on a tiny marine creature
43:58
which was about one millimeter wide i'm
44:00
not sure whether that was the penis or
44:01
the whole animal
44:02
but the one millimeter penis
44:05
yeah oh my god
44:09
[Laughter]
44:11
um but he says that it doesn't have one
44:14
penis it has
44:15
two so the earliest ever penis that
44:17
we've got is from an animal which had
44:18
two of them
44:19
wow that's great that's cool yeah
44:23
nice i like it yeah me too sure wrap up

00:53
i love vegemite but i hate marmite when
00:56
you take the comparison higher so you
00:58
would would obviously love vegemite down
00:59
because you're australian but i'd
01:00
actually prefer vegemite to marmite and
01:02
i think i'm probably the only british
01:03
person who would admit to that
01:05
it's just better guys well i read an
01:07
extraordinary story that
01:09
ibm did a global survey of the most
01:11
talked about brands
01:12
online and they went through the
01:14
internet scouring it for the most brands
01:15
that were spoken about
01:16
and the top brand higher than uh
01:19
coke higher than nike was vegemite more
01:22
spoken about
01:23
because you don't need to speak about
01:26
coke because
01:27
it's always good yeah it could be that
01:29
and the weird thing is that they tracked
01:30
it down that
01:31
98 of vegemite eaters are all australian
01:35
how many what percent sorry 98 well that
01:38
sounds right
01:38
i don't think you can buy it anywhere
01:40
else you can get it overseas now you can
01:41
get it and the supermarket's here but so
01:43
what's even more interesting is that it
01:45
wasn't like they were tracking it to
01:46
australia they were tracking it globally
01:48
so they know where all the australians
01:50
are around the world
01:52
through vegemite consumption yeah that's
01:55
really great
01:56
i mean that's not obviously all the
01:57
australians but it's like it's just it
01:59
gives you a great map of how spread out
02:00
aussies are around the world
02:02
you could probably do the same with
02:03
british and baked beans yeah yes
02:05
yeah although vegemite is now really
02:07
popular in certain asian countries like
02:09
in hong kong it's
02:10
all sold out in hong kong from all
02:11
supermarkets suddenly and that was when
02:14
it was connected to umami flavor so
02:16
there was like a lot of press around at
02:18
some point which said that is the umami
02:19
flavor because that's
02:20
you know hailed as a brilliant flavor in
02:22
particular in japan and hong kong
02:25
um suddenly it's incredibly popular wow
02:27
right
02:28
hey guys are we talking about vegemite
02:30
on this podcast are we talking about
02:31
james's fact about marmite
02:32
live fights about marmite go bring your
02:37
um i didn't know it's got celery in it
02:39
has it yeah
02:41
my white is made with celery wow that
02:42
must mean it's so good for you
02:44
yes excellent it also has like remnants
02:47
of beer
02:48
in it doesn't it that's what it's made
02:49
of it's like extract from the beer
02:51
making
02:52
is it still well probably not anymore
02:54
but that's where it originally
02:55
if you've got yeast left over you may as
02:56
well use it for yeah i wonder why i was
02:58
not drunk after breakfast
03:00
that's because that's because you have a
03:01
serious problem
03:13
[Laughter]
03:15
speaking of drinking they released on
03:18
valentine's day in 2008
03:19
they released champagne flavored marmite
03:22
oh i don't know about that and it had
03:23
three percent champagne amid
03:25
now i would have thought that the
03:27
marmite would overpower the
03:29
the three percent of champagne and
03:31
vanilla is a famously mild flavor
03:33
um do you know what it means it means
03:37
is an old french cooking pot so you know
03:39
on the front of a marmite
03:41
jar there is the little picture of a
03:44
yeah
03:46
yeah it's because it was originally made
03:48
to add us like a little bit of extra to
03:50
casseroles that was the point of marmite
03:52
in the first place
03:53
oh really yeah i like flavour yeah it's
03:55
like a it's like a stock cube or
03:57
something like that
03:58
because it was invented by the same guy
04:00
who invented oxo cubes
04:02
who was called justice von liebig and he
04:05
he was the first person who realized
04:07
that you could um take like the yeast
04:09
extract and turn it into something you
04:11
could eat
04:11
but he's also known as the father of the
04:13
fertilizer industry
04:15
because he discovered that nitrogen is
04:17
essential for plants
04:18
and he also developed a breast milk
04:20
substitute for babies
04:22
wow wow yeah yeah
04:26
hang on archetypally british uh marmite
04:29
was invented by was he german
04:30
justice von liebig sounds yeah i think
04:32
he was actually
04:33
i think his um his main uh manufacturing
04:36
place was in frey bentos which is in
04:37
uruguay
04:38
as well yeah why do you call it marmite
04:40
he should have called it justice so he
04:41
could say justice will be served
04:43
at breakfast
04:49
so was his breast milk substitute
04:51
marmite
04:53
he just claimed
05:01
[Laughter]
05:05
there are a lot of articles online about
05:07
um marmite because it's something that
05:09
people like talking about
05:11
i i read this phrase marmite won two
05:13
world wars
05:15
okay that's not strictly true it's the
05:18
fastest climb down from the assertion of
05:20
a fact i've ever read
05:22
um and that was on a bbc article about
05:23
it but what they mean was it was in
05:25
soldiers rations in the first world war
05:27
yeah um because it was good for veterans
05:29
uh spam
05:30
condensed milk and marmite basically
05:33
that's a meal they had this kind of
05:35
corned beef stuff that no one liked uh
05:38
and
05:39
so few people wanted to eat it that they
05:40
ended up just using it to prop
05:42
up things in the trenches and the crates
05:44
and crates of this stuff that no one
05:45
would eat i
05:46
think they would over indulge in the
05:48
trenches if they were just using that
05:49
food as a building material
06:05
they were served which they could only
06:07
walk on
06:10
wow they were a little bit spoiled
06:14
um so the the thing about the uh the
06:17
actual slogan itself
06:19
was that it was just a genius slogan
06:21
yeah in that it
06:22
just created a whole world yeah it was
06:24
just fantastic
06:25
and um i was i was looking into a few
06:27
slogans and
06:28
i read the most popular slogan we
06:31
mentioned it slightly
06:32
by saying if british people were around
06:34
the world heinz makes beans or whatever
06:36
it is
06:36
means supposedly the most
06:40
how successful of all the slogans they
06:42
know on what metric
06:43
that's the most successful in terms of
06:45
the most people who remember it or
06:47
oh uh yeah i don't know actually no it
06:49
was just a poll to say which was your
06:50
favorite and
06:51
that is very good beans beans i said
06:54
this led me to a kind of little
06:56
snoop into the world of slogans which
06:59
i just i found i was i ended up looking
07:02
at basically the last brazil world cup
07:04
they all came in with country slogans
07:06
did you see the slogans
07:07
i don't remember that each country had
07:08
like a brand new slogan that they
07:10
brought with their country so give us a
07:12
country and we'll see if we can work out
07:13
what they were
07:14
okay argentina give us the falcons back
07:17
you bastards
07:20
is that it catchy
07:23
no that's a it's a rather boring one for
07:25
them it's not just a team
07:26
we are a country uh france this is my
07:29
favorite one actually the french one
07:31
total france though so it's uh
07:34
impossible
07:35
is not a french word which i love
07:38
because it literally is
07:40
that's amazing yeah um i think that that
07:44
french line
07:45
impossible is not a french word is as it
07:47
was originally a napoleon
07:49
quotation ah yeah okay just in case we
07:52
get so that's quite good man yeah yeah
07:54
he was also wrong this i really like
07:57
this story
07:58
um is from an article again sort of you
08:01
know
08:01
interesting facts about marmite i'm
08:03
quoting directly in 2009
08:05
a marmite obsessed thief targeted a
08:06
petrol station and stole 18 jars over a
08:09
month
08:09
ultimately the owners stopped stocking
08:12
it to prevent him striking again
08:17
i love that you go into like tesco's and
08:19
there's nothing there it's like
08:21
well we've had no robberies for the last
08:23
three years
08:25
but that's what they said wasn't it i
08:26
read that article and they were like
08:27
well what's the point of us putting it
08:28
on our shelves if this guy is just going
08:30
to nick them
08:31
there's no point i know but it's not a
08:32
capitulation
08:34
theft it does feel like that guy's won
08:37
[Laughter]
08:38
should
08:41
one more thing i read former chelsea
08:43
footballer nicholas anelka
08:45
is said to be scared by marmite
08:47
[Laughter]
08:49
why i don't know but he always goes to
08:51
that petrol station these days yeah
08:56
okay time for fact number two my fact
08:58
this week
08:59
is that the knights of the round table
09:01
included lancelot
09:02
gawain galahad and gareth
09:06
gareth the knight what was his job
09:09
he was well he was just like a classic
09:11
knight the weird thing though i was
09:12
looking he's not one of the famous ones
09:14
he's not but i was looking into him he's
09:15
actually arthur's nephew
09:17
which just seems like autism in the
09:19
workplace here we go
09:20
i can't believe there's a new seat at
09:22
the table yeah i think it was going to
09:24
be one of the great knights who's
09:25
finally made his way
09:26
because you know there were lesser
09:27
tables no really yeah
09:30
were there other shapes as well i'm not
09:31
sure
09:33
and then it was kind of like a main hall
09:35
where they had i mean
09:37
it obviously never happened but like uh
09:39
i was there's a novel that's come out
09:41
talking about the lesser knights
09:42
and i didn't realize that the novel
09:43
actually has a basis in what is closer
09:46
to the actual mythology there was a
09:47
there were lots of other tables where
09:48
there were like older knights who were
09:50
retired and there were
09:51
so it's like at a wedding where you've
09:52
got the head table and then you've got a
09:54
really crap one in the corner with
09:56
tedious people were there was there a
09:58
trapezium table
10:00
within the knights of the trapezium
10:01
table or the rhombus
10:04
just some of my favorite shapes i
10:05
thought i'd mention so they um
10:07
they have round tables at starbucks
10:09
apparently oh yeah and the reason
10:11
for that is that um people look less
10:13
alone
10:14
when seated alone at a round table
10:18
yeah that makes sense there's no obvious
10:20
place for other people to go whereas in
10:21
a square table i suppose you want other
10:23
people on the extra edges
10:24
yeah so gareth yeah so he was the nephew
10:27
um we don't know anything else about him
10:28
no no there's quite a lot i mean he's a
10:30
big part of the story
10:31
actually uh it's a bit unfair to say
10:33
that he's the nephew
10:34
and make that sound as a bad thing
10:35
because actually quite a number of the
10:37
other knights were nephews of arthur as
10:39
well
10:39
just because everyone got in on special
10:41
favors doesn't mean it's any better that
10:42
gareth did
10:44
the only thing i know about him is that
10:46
his nickname was bowman
10:47
which is beau matt as the french words
10:49
beautiful hands
10:51
which people teased him saying hey
10:53
pretty hands
10:54
right teased gareth yeah
10:57
but that that does imply that he's not
10:59
getting his hands dirty by killing
11:00
dragons and stuff
11:01
yeah it does yeah yeah i think he was a
11:03
kitchen assistant or something like that
11:05
yeah is that right
11:06
yeah for a while when he was sort of
11:07
undercover
11:09
that sort of period where a really rich
11:10
famous person goes into the slums
11:13
and sees what it's like to be a normal
11:14
person he was undercover with his
11:15
massive shield a massive sword yeah
11:18
yes exactly peter the great went
11:20
undercover all the time
11:22
he loved doing it yeah and he was about
11:24
seven feet tall and clearly
11:27
the tsar of russia so it was very hard
11:28
for him to do it and he had a big
11:30
group of people within the didn't he
11:32
like 30 people walking along
11:33
him and he's going nope no i got him
11:36
yeah but he went he got a job in the
11:37
shipbuilding yard
11:38
and he would only answer to the name
11:40
peter the shipbuilder
11:42
and people would bring him matters of
11:44
state in the evenings after he finished
11:45
building ships for the day
11:47
wow and then he would say he would sign
11:48
a few documents and things and then he'd
11:50
weigh a lot of time he's kind of got it
11:51
wrong if he calls himself peter
11:53
whatever old habits die hard basically
11:56
yeah he couldn't help it but i think
11:57
people like pretended to not
11:59
recognize him didn't they make him feel
12:01
like he was being successful
12:03
um i guess it was easy to go undercover
12:06
in in the olden days you know the
12:07
pre-photography days there's
12:09
uh was a rumor written down at the time
12:11
wasn't there that the way marie
12:12
antoinette was captured was because
12:14
someone recognized her from the coins
12:17
really and that's then reported her to
12:18
the authorities and that's why
12:21
that's a pretty funny idea someone
12:22
looking at the coin and then looking up
12:24
yeah looking back at the coin going wait
12:27
excuse me madam could you stand sideways
12:29
for a minute
12:33
um back to nights yeah what would you
12:36
guys say
12:37
at night tournaments in the middle ages
12:40
what was the main sport
12:42
no it wasn't jousting was always a side
12:44
sport the main sport was always the
12:46
malay
12:46
which was um the big group fight where
12:49
all the knights
12:50
like galloped in towards each other and
12:51
had a great point like a melee like uh
12:53
yeah where we get malay from chelsea was
12:56
always just a side effect
12:57
like a lot of um rulers and people
13:00
campaigned to get jousting banned
13:02
because they thought it distracted from
13:03
the main malay
13:05
um and they thought it wasn't wasn't a
13:07
necessary part and
13:08
count philip of flanders actually used
13:10
to turn up with a whole retinue
13:12
um and declined to join the malay and so
13:15
make sure everyone else got in the malay
13:17
and then when he was jousting he'd be
13:19
able to win the joust because everyone
13:20
was tired from the malay
13:21
um and so people wanted to ban the
13:23
jousting i think it's true that the only
13:24
reason more people didn't get killed in
13:26
the melee was because the main aim was
13:27
to capture other people
13:29
and then you would sell them their armor
13:30
back to them because it's very
13:31
embarrassing and that you they basically
13:33
rent some your armor
13:34
from you yeah what uh would they go in
13:36
with a lance
13:38
um
13:42
okay um a lancelot and there's a guy
13:44
called george lancelot he's in the news
13:46
quite recently
13:47
he's had 176 convictions for repeated
13:50
swerry outbursts
13:54
yes he's been arrested for abuse a few
13:56
times and
13:57
he claims to suffer from personality
13:59
disorder which makes him swear and run
14:01
whenever he is out in public and he's
14:02
been drinking
14:04
and recently he was sent to prison for a
14:06
short amount of time
14:08
as he was led from the dock in exeter
14:10
crown court he shouted
14:11
i get less for burglary [ __ ] off
14:16
in his defense he had been drinking
14:19
um have you guys heard of the game king
14:22
arthur
14:23
well played in fact no this was a game
14:26
that sailors played in the
14:28
16th and 17th centuries um so you'd like
14:31
one crew member to play
14:32
king arthur and he'd be dressed up in
14:34
ridiculous robes and apparently wear a
14:35
wig made of rope
14:37
and then everyone else of the crew would
14:38
have to be like formally introduced to
14:40
this king arthur and they'd have to
14:41
tip a bucket of freezing cold water over
14:44
his head
14:44
so it's like the ice bucket challenge
14:46
it's a bit like that but if you
14:48
when you tipped it over his head and
14:49
obviously i guess his reaction was quite
14:50
amusing if you cracked a smile or a
14:52
laugh
14:53
you had to swap places with him and you
14:54
had to become a character
14:56
wow that's great you only shouted you
14:58
said hail king arthur
15:00
chipped a buck over his head had to keep
15:01
a straight face i nominate
15:03
long john silva
15:07
so just back to the knights very quickly
15:09
uh because i'm not of
15:11
your country i didn't really get an
15:13
upbringing
15:14
totally with it obviously you guys might
15:16
have i'm guessing in school was a big
15:18
part of the united
15:19
states king arthur the whole mythology
15:22
all right not really yeah oh okay
15:25
okay we've all seen the sword in the
15:27
stone disney film yes
15:28
i haven't oh well it's the best disney
15:30
film oh yeah there we go it's a really
15:31
hot squirrel in it
15:34
that is true true right she's pretty fit
15:36
she is
15:37
sexy like the fox in robin hood for
15:39
example
15:40
that was robin hood and what
15:44
oh yeah yeah he's a very happy he's a
15:47
handsome fox
15:48
uh yeah um but so there's no basis of
15:51
truth in it whatsoever right there are
15:52
certainly claims
15:53
that there's a claim that a huge round
15:55
table that hangs in winchester hall
15:57
is the real round table basically what
16:00
happens is there's this mythology
16:02
which most people think isn't true but
16:03
there might be some kind of
16:05
historical basis to it probably not and
16:07
so when you have anything like that it
16:09
means that everyone can claim
16:10
part of it so okay um there's a i think
16:13
the latest theory is that so it's a bit
16:14
like robin hood i think is that people
16:16
often come up with theories of where the
16:17
arthurian legend might have come from
16:18
and the latest is that he was
16:19
kazakhstani
16:20
oh really nice modern interpretation
16:23
kazakhstani king
16:24
but he was a mythical kazakhstani king
16:25
as opposed to a mythical english king is
16:27
that right i think so yeah okay cool
16:28
there's another theory that he's
16:30
croatian
16:31
because his wife was called igrain and
16:34
there is a town called igrain
16:36
in croatia and they've decided well it
16:37
sounds the same so she must have been
16:39
from here
16:39
fair enough so we're just with the round
16:41
table and gareth specifically uh it
16:43
turns out
16:44
that um gareth's death is what led to
16:47
the sort of
16:48
breaking up of the round table of the
16:49
knights being there all the time
16:51
yeah so they really did care about the
16:53
little kitchen they loved gareth
16:54
yeah he was a big he wasn't just the
16:57
nepotistic
16:58
nephew coming in he was very much loved
17:01
so
17:01
gareth that was actually the first use
17:03
of the name gareth
17:04
in yeah i read one theory that um it was
17:07
a mistake by mallory
17:09
oh uh he was supposed to be called
17:11
harriet
17:12
but he misheard harriet and said gareth
17:16
i mean it's not that much
17:17
having the female name harriet as the
17:19
main part of your male name
17:21
to be fair so do you think we could say
17:23
that gareth in the same way that like
17:25
joe
17:25
anna is the female version of joseph or
17:28
whatever josephine probably
17:29
do you think we could say that gareth is
17:30
the male version of harriet i can think
17:32
of a better
17:33
male equivalent of harriet than
17:36
gareth it's taken me a while
17:43
it must be a really obscure name
17:48
let's move on to fact number three and
17:51
that is andrew hunter murray
17:53
my fact is that the ministry of defense
17:55
owns 15
17:56
golf courses this is the british
17:58
ministry of defense right
18:00
yeah why do we know why why not it's
18:03
it's hard work killing the enemies of
18:06
the crown
18:07
yes you can't relax and have a quick
18:09
nine you know
18:10
no no i think i think it's because you
18:12
know when you watch a james bond movie
18:14
and i know the ministry of defense is
18:15
different to mi6 but
18:17
they must have their spies as well right
18:19
ministry of defense whenever you see a
18:20
james bond movie
18:21
bond is brilliant at everything you
18:24
don't become brilliant at everything
18:25
without
18:25
training like crazy good at golf yeah
18:27
well golf would be one of the things
18:29
there will be a bonus
18:30
when he plays golf and he's playing
18:31
against gold goldfinger well there you
18:33
go
18:34
you resume down the ministry of defense
18:35
also owns like loads of tennis courts
18:37
they've got tennis courts
18:38
yeah well i think i read that they do
18:40
have like polo
18:42
uh poker tables poker tables uh ski
18:45
resorts
18:46
they've got a dart board board scrabble
18:49
bars
18:49
they've got it all they've got one spy
18:51
waiting for the evil villain who plays
18:53
shove hate me
18:56
[Laughter]
19:02
[Laughter]
19:14
another thing the ministry of defense
19:16
has is this is in their list of
19:18
achievements for 2014
19:20
um completed a rollout of internet
19:22
explorer 8 as its default browser
19:28
not bad impressive still on internet
19:31
explorer and not only that internet
19:32
explorer 8 came out in 2009
19:34
so have you heard of kabul golf club
19:38
no this is the only golf club in the
19:41
whole of afghanistan
19:42
right and um the the course rules
19:45
specifically call the greens
19:47
uh browns yeah because it's very very
19:49
dry and there's no grass
19:51
all basically it's all sand but they
19:52
make the greens more compact don't they
19:55
yeah i think um and it used to be an
19:58
area for training in the removal of
20:00
mines
20:00
and some pla some you have to carry out
20:02
artificial turf with you sometimes
20:04
put that on the ground where your ball
20:06
is and play off that
20:08
to the next and then carry your
20:09
artificial turf with you that happens to
20:11
put it under the ball
20:12
that happens in actual not like
20:13
professional golf but if you're a member
20:15
of a golf course
20:16
some golf courses in the uk right you'll
20:18
carry some artificial turf
20:20
really in the winter because they don't
20:22
want you hacking up the mud
20:24
bring your own bit of artificial stuff
20:26
put it down put the ball on and play it
20:27
off there that's fantastic
20:28
yeah i think that's really cool yeah so
20:30
what the first crazy golf course was
20:32
no um it was it's still around it's at
20:36
st
20:36
andrews and it's a putting green and
20:39
it's got loads of real big hills on it
20:41
so the ball goes in all sorts of
20:42
directions
20:43
and it was invented because uh ladies
20:45
weren't allowed to play on the golf
20:46
course so they gave them this little
20:49
like fake golf course to play and then
20:51
it became so popular because
20:53
actually it's a lot more fun than proper
20:55
golf if you're not good at golf
20:57
and that everyone started playing it and
20:59
then they kicked the women off that one
21:00
as well
21:01
no no you can you can play this tiny
21:03
golf you've just invented
21:05
with your fingers
21:08
little cocktail stick for a golf club
21:10
that's so funny is it true mary queen of
21:11
scots first
21:12
uh female golfer in records yeah that's
21:15
true
21:16
wow records though are tricky things but
21:18
yeah i think it is
21:19
and i think james the fourth of scotland
21:20
was the first recorded golf player again
21:23
he definitely wasn't the first ever golf
21:24
player but yeah he played in 1502
21:27
he uh lifted the band that had
21:30
previously been in place on playing golf
21:31
because
21:32
um it was encouraged to encourage
21:34
archery practice
21:35
golf was not allowed because you know if
21:37
you can't play golf yeah his grandfather
21:39
banned it didn't he yeah so apparently
21:41
part of the reason that he lifted the
21:43
ban was he realized that cannon would
21:44
probably replace archers in time so it
21:46
wasn't as important for everyone to be
21:47
doing archery practice
21:49
long-sighted yeah um quite a lot of
21:52
famous people
21:53
in history have have been known for
21:54
playing golf haven't they
21:56
like i think roger kipling was a big
21:58
golf fan and
21:59
it's claimed that rajid kepling i mean
22:01
it's true that ruddy kipling invented
22:03
snow golf
22:04
but it's often claimed like this is a
22:05
sport that now we're all playing and did
22:07
you know
22:09
roger kipling invented it i'm almost
22:11
constantly it's getting a bit out of
22:12
hand actually the amount of snow golf i
22:13
play
22:15
any archery anymore okay so there was a
22:18
golfer in benin
22:19
called matthew boyer okay this might be
22:22
a made up story but it's all over the
22:23
internet
22:25
one day he played a shot described as a
22:26
glorious slice
22:28
and the ball hit a bird which in turn
22:30
dropped onto the windshield of a trainer
22:32
jet
22:33
and that trainer jet pilot then swerved
22:36
out of the way
22:37
and took out four new mirage jets and
22:40
um in one go totally demolished the
22:43
entire air force of benin
22:45
wow through one golf shot that's what
22:47
happened that is impressive
22:49
and they worked out it would take him
22:50
145 000 years to pay off his debt
22:53
wow did he yell out on the court i would
22:55
have got less for burglary
22:56
[ __ ] off i could be a cool catcher if
22:59
you're leaving
23:00
every time okay
23:08
time for our final fact and that is
23:10
cecinski
23:11
my fact is that the rise in the use of
23:14
female contraceptive pills
23:16
is causing fish to become too effeminate
23:19
this is a genuine problem uh this is
23:20
about how the
23:22
a lot of women use a female
23:23
contraceptive pill understandably it's a
23:25
great thing but that does mean that we
23:27
end up
23:28
flushing out of our system a lot of
23:30
female hormones
23:32
that go into the drains and get into
23:33
rivers and the fish take them in
23:35
and it causes this thing called intersex
23:38
which means that like a male fish will
23:40
stop producing sperm it'll start
23:41
producing eggs
23:42
and then it damages fish populations
23:44
because they can't really breed as well
23:45
when they start doing that
23:47
um so yeah bit of an issue stuff being
23:50
flushed down the drain huge issue yeah
23:52
how can there be that much that's going
23:54
into the ocean the fish hanging out by
23:56
the source of the sewers it's a good
23:57
point so
23:58
yeah it does take this the tiniest
24:00
amount to have an effect on them so they
24:01
added um
24:02
its ee2 which is ethanol estradiol
24:06
which is the main active ingredient of
24:07
contraceptive pills which triggers the
24:09
condition
24:10
um in fish and so they added five parts
24:13
of that per trillion
24:14
to water to test it out and it still had
24:16
an effect on the fish
24:18
that's extraordinary so i was just other
24:22
things that go through
24:23
the drain systems and out in the ocean
24:26
um
24:26
i was talking to this lady from the
24:28
natural history museum sandy knapp
24:30
and she's actually it's not relevant
24:33
she's a
24:34
curator of potatoes and tomatoes but
24:36
what i'm talking about is facial
24:37
products
24:38
uh she was telling me she gave me this
24:39
little vial of these little blue beads
24:42
and she was saying these beads are from
24:43
when you wash your face
24:45
with face wash it's those micro beads
24:47
that they say they're inside the thing
24:48
and she was saying what do you think
24:49
these are made of and i assumed it's a
24:51
natural product and she said no it's
24:52
little bits of plastic
24:53
and the plastic is now apparently when
24:56
it goes through the drains that gets
24:57
forced out into the ocean
24:59
it makes it through the system fish are
25:00
eating it becoming toxic
25:02
it's actually poisoning the fish and
25:04
then when you eat the fish it's actually
25:05
harming us now apparently it knocks up
25:07
radiation levels or something i don't
25:09
yeah
25:09
i've probably got all pseudo-either at
25:11
the end and that's in moisturizer
25:12
it's in like a face sauce you know you
25:14
have those microbeads yeah if you buy
25:16
face washing it's kind of a bit rough
25:18
you know when you buy
25:20
face wash you know when you wash your
25:22
face
25:23
never done that humans are paying for
25:24
their vanity now aren't they
25:26
you said that like you weren't a human
25:29
you people
25:30
will suffer purely
25:34
so um industrial pollutants are
25:36
shrinking the genitals of polar bears in
25:38
greenland
25:39
that's their excuse they should just
25:42
play down the cold shouldn't they really
25:45
but apparently weakening their penis
25:47
bones and
25:48
wow industrial pollutants yeah and also
25:51
there's
25:52
a chemical used to paint boats on the
25:54
western coast of australia called tbt
25:57
and that causes female sea snails to
26:00
grow male sex organs on their heads
26:03
that is pretty comical that's an odd
26:06
mutation yeah yeah
26:07
it's a funny one the good news is that
26:09
the percentage of snails with the penis
26:11
on the foreheads
26:12
is going down uh and the size of the
26:15
penis is shrinking
26:17
uh thanks to a decreasing proportion of
26:19
chemical in the water
26:20
that is the good news i think we all
26:22
know what the most common insult is
26:24
in the snail population
26:27
[Laughter]
26:29
it's a really straightforward one so
26:32
another fish
26:32
that would change sex um
26:35
is nemo from the film finding nemo okay
26:39
did you know about this clown fish
26:41
um and i mean if if the cl if the story
26:44
went
26:45
as a proper clown fish life cycle does
26:47
um
26:48
nemo would hatch as a hermaphrodite
26:50
because all clown fish are born
26:52
and um when the female mate dies nemo's
26:55
father would have turned into a female
26:58
now sin and because nemo is the only
27:00
other clownfish around in this
27:02
setting of the film he would then become
27:04
a male and mate with his now female
27:06
father
27:07
unless his father dies in which case he
27:09
changes into a female
27:10
and goes off with another male uh i
27:12
haven't seen this maybe is that not what
27:13
happens
27:16
extended director's class i did read
27:19
that
27:19
the mother of nemo dies uh after four
27:22
minutes and three seconds of finding
27:24
finding nemo right yeah uh eaten by a
27:26
barracuda apparently yep
27:27
uh but this was in a story spoiler alert
27:31
for those who've only made it two
27:32
minutes in
27:35
but this was in an article that says
27:38
that two-thirds of children's animated
27:39
films contain
27:40
an on-screen death of an important
27:42
character compared with only half of
27:44
comparison films
27:46
so there are more deaths in children's
27:47
films than there are in the films yeah
27:49
so basically it's either a dead parent a
27:52
single parent
27:53
or a mother who turns into a father who
27:55
turns into a mother who has sex with a
27:57
child
27:58
it's usually one of those plot lines
28:01
that is a fully functioning fish family
28:02
that you've just described
28:04
yeah um so on finding nemo i there's a
28:07
book that's just come out i think which
28:08
is called
28:09
water the past present and future um
28:12
which is quite interesting and that
28:14
states that one of the reasons that
28:16
finding nemo was set in sydney is that
28:18
sydney is one of the only places in the
28:20
world so one of only three
28:21
english-speaking uh places in the world
28:24
where you could
28:24
flush a fish down a drain and it would
28:27
make it to the sea without dying
28:29
um because what would happen to the
28:30
others the others are going to get
28:32
ground up and crushed to death in
28:33
various sewage treatment plants
28:36
yeah in fact there was a there was panic
28:38
when finding nemo was released that kids
28:39
were going to start doing this their
28:40
fish to free them
28:42
and so they released a statement saying
28:44
actually a better title for this film
28:45
would have been
28:46
grinding nemo because actually if you do
28:49
this to a fish
28:49
it will end up crushing wait who
28:51
released that statement uh it was the
28:53
national pun
28:57
was it an animal rights group no it was
28:59
someone involved with the film
29:00
oh okay yeah that helpful though because
29:01
children don't normally read a lot of
29:03
statements
29:05
or appreciate a good partner because
29:07
apparently there was a rise in parents
29:09
calling plumbers going how do i get my
29:10
fish out we've flushed it down is it
29:12
going to be saved
29:13
really yeah yeah because children were
29:15
just doing it
29:16
and there was and also a lot of children
29:18
even though it doesn't exactly like hold
29:20
up the virtues of owning a clownfish
29:21
because he does just escape
29:22
um there was a problem with kids
29:25
suddenly wanting clownfish
29:27
and i think there was a certain sea that
29:29
they were just taken from where it was
29:30
emptied of all these clownfish
29:32
oh really okay yeah the damn selfish i
29:35
know
29:35
no that's actually the group of fish
29:37
that clownfish from they're called damn
29:38
selfish it's not a cool name
29:40
they're damn selfish selfish
29:44
one word oh damselfish
29:46
[Laughter]
29:53
um is question why do people flush
29:56
goldfish down the toilet and not eat
29:58
them
30:01
they have two options well i just care
30:02
for some reason that people bury their
30:04
dogs
30:05
and don't eat them yeah but we eat fish
30:08
we don't eat dogs
30:10
okay good point like there's fresh fish
30:11
in the house now there are so many
30:13
reasons yeah james are there right
30:14
here's one good reason yeah if your fish
30:17
has just died
30:18
you don't know what it died of it could
30:19
have died of a disease or something so
30:21
you won't want to eat it in that way
30:22
yeah that's
30:22
one extremely good reason not the reason
30:24
i didn't eat my
30:26
hamster for example also i don't i don't
30:29
ask for a certificate of death when i'm
30:31
in a restaurant i bought as a haddock
30:33
okay don't you that the restaurants have
30:35
asked for that
30:36
at some point the restaurants have to go
30:38
through a process where they make sure
30:39
their
30:40
fish are healthy to eat find dead
30:43
animals
30:45
you've seen those big ads in the
30:46
newspapers we buy dead fish
30:50
gosh for dead fish
30:54
cash for goldfish
31:00
it just seems you're throwing away food
31:01
um one story i like about finding nemo
31:03
is
31:04
that when andrew stanton who had the
31:05
pixar had the idea
31:07
and pitched it um to the head of pixar
31:09
john lasseter
31:10
he did it in a session that lasted over
31:12
an hour and he had lots of visual aids
31:14
and character voices and it really tied
31:15
him out he says
31:16
um and at the end of it he was like oh
31:18
lasseter what do you think and lasso
31:20
just went
31:20
you had me at fish
31:25
okay so um some stuff on contraceptives
31:28
maybe not um sponges were used
31:31
as contraceptives in the 1800s and 1900s
31:35
they would use with use them with
31:37
spermicides
31:39
okay what and put them into yeah so they
31:42
would be used with things like quinine
31:44
and olive oil
31:45
and that would supposedly be a
31:47
contraceptive yeah
31:49
and some even doubled as household
31:51
cleaners and one was advertised as a
31:53
dual treatment
31:55
for successful womanhood which means
31:57
contraception
31:58
and athlete's
32:10
but i have 20 children

00:31
thanks hello everyone james here i just
00:34
wanted to say that
00:35
today's installment of no such thing as
00:37
a fish was produced with the help of
00:39
squarespace
00:40
the award-winning website builder that
00:41
makes it easy to tell your story to the
00:43
world
00:44
so squarespace is a website where you
00:45
can build your own website it's got
00:47
lovely templates that you can use
00:49
and they provide a lot of support 24
00:50
hours a day if you need it and
00:52
you can basically make an extremely good
00:54
website and it is only eight dollars a
00:56
month
00:57
yes or if you live in the uk it'll be
00:59
about five pounds a month but that
01:00
depends on local exchange rates
01:02
obviously and we're not to be held
01:04
responsible of the currency changes
01:05
between recording this
01:06
and the podcast being broadcast oh you
01:08
can get it even cheaper than that though
01:09
because if you put the word
01:11
fish in that little box where you put
01:12
the offer codes
01:14
then they'll give you 10 off that's
01:15
about 50p a month
01:18
in english apart from if the exchange
01:20
rates change of course
01:21
yes and please note we cannot be held
01:23
responsible if they do
01:24
the markets are very volatile at the
01:26
moment but if you want to build a
01:28
website about your knowledge of the
01:29
markets then squarespace is a very good
01:30
place to do it with
01:31
on with the show
01:35
[Music]
01:38
hello and welcome to another episode of
01:40
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
01:43
coming to you from the qi offices in
01:44
covent garden my name is dan schreiber
01:46
i'm sitting
01:47
with james hurricane andy murray and
01:49
miller and a special guest today it's
01:51
victoria coron mitchell
01:53
who joins us because our three elves
01:55
have been on only connect
01:56
battling it out in the big competition
01:58
they've got their quarterfinal match
02:00
coming up this monday the 23rd of
02:02
february
02:03
and so we thought we'd get victoria in
02:05
to uh to reveal how little she knows
02:08
the elves possible exit from the series
02:10
i understand don't worry
02:12
it cuts both ways you can laugh at what
02:13
i don't know
02:15
yeah okay so uh once again we have
02:17
gathered round with our four favorite
02:18
facts from the last seven days and in no
02:20
particular order here we go
02:22
starting with victoria my fact is
02:25
that the actor charles hawtry
02:29
hoarded bedsteads in his house thinking
02:31
that one day he would make his fortune
02:33
from them
02:34
that's so good so okay uh charles world
02:36
tree massive british comedy actor
02:39
carry on films he that was a big thing
02:40
for him charles was particularly known
02:42
for the carry on
02:43
i don't know if he ever did anything
02:44
else he had a very particular
02:47
acting style let's just say it was good
02:49
news for him that the carry on films
02:50
came along
02:51
even though he was wonderful an
02:52
extremely talented very funny man
02:55
i don't know if people clamored to see
02:57
his hamlet
02:59
he and clint eastwood weren't vying
03:03
like the same roles but if people have
03:04
seen the carroll yes he's he's the sort
03:06
of
03:06
slender camp fellow in the glasses yeah
03:08
i wonder if he thought they
03:10
were they really expensive bed poles do
03:12
we think or
03:14
or what how the collection started i
03:16
don't know i mean i like to think maybe
03:18
he one day accidentally bought two bed
03:20
studs when he needed one
03:22
i might as well start a collection now
03:25
and he's come up with that he i mean he
03:27
did like a drink
03:28
that is the thing that's learned about
03:29
charles walker he did so it's possible
03:31
that the original
03:33
bedstead hoarding fortune wheeze
03:36
was hatched in a moment not entirely so
03:39
bright
03:40
but you sober up at some point don't you
03:41
yeah well i don't know if he did ever no
03:44
but probably he sobered up thought what
03:45
am i doing with all these better have a
03:47
drink and work out i'm going to get rid
03:48
of them
03:48
and then he gets drunk and i think this
03:49
is fantastic look at this collection i
03:51
need more
03:51
maybe that's what it was oh it's a
03:53
brilliant idea so i've got some money
03:54
i'll buy a drink no i'll buy a bedside
03:56
it's an investment for the future and i
03:57
can look at it in my house maybe that
03:58
was like
04:05
he was supposed to be quite miserly
04:06
wasn't he charles hartree i read
04:08
apparently he brought sacks of carrots
04:10
from yorkshire to kent because they were
04:12
cheaper to buy in yorkshire
04:14
and then he would bring them all down
04:15
south and he was not just
04:17
for his own person his own yeah to eat
04:19
and also he kept his money in the royal
04:21
bank of scotland because he thought that
04:22
scots were more likely to look after his
04:24
cash carefully
04:25
wow well had he lived a little longer he
04:27
would have been thoroughly disappeared
04:31
it's quite a good i like miserliness
04:34
though miseriness is quite a good
04:37
vice yeah there's something quite sweet
04:39
and old-fashioned and
04:40
funny about it of the things that can be
04:42
wrong with people
04:43
i read a sentence about charles autry
04:45
which i like so much
04:46
um he so the first half isn't fun but it
04:48
picks up a lot um
04:50
from there he spiraled into reclusion
04:51
and paranoid fantasies buying a cottage
04:53
on the south coast and filling it with
04:54
brass bed studs and rent boys
04:57
one of whom burnt it down after
04:59
hawthorne wanted to pay by check
05:00
[Laughter]
05:03
you see now that's where a brass
05:06
bedsteads are a better investment than
05:07
for example
05:08
first folios of shakespeare because if a
05:10
red boy is going to burn your house
05:12
and then an act of payment revenge it's
05:14
the it's the bedsteads that are going to
05:16
come out on skates
05:17
right it's just going to be ashes
05:18
everywhere and hundreds of days
05:22
in the remains his checkbook stub must
05:24
have been amazing because you have a
05:25
little stub don't need to write what
05:26
you've been spending the money on oh
05:28
yeah
05:28
no it just went bad bad stead read boy
05:32
he was quite macho though chelsea was
05:34
something i read about him i don't know
05:35
very much about him at all i was just a
05:37
big fan of him in the films but
05:38
that he used to get drunk and play cards
05:41
on set
05:42
i mean that does make you think of sort
05:44
of oliver reed
05:45
robert mitchum or something we think
05:47
about like a drunken
05:48
gambling card playing actor you don't
05:50
think of charles
05:51
do you think of him sorting out his kind
05:54
of butterfly collection
05:56
but no so i wonder if that you know that
05:58
his carry-on persona wasn't just
06:00
completely fabricated
06:02
yeah yeah okay some stuff on collections
06:05
and yeah and things like that there's a
06:07
guy called chevalier jackson
06:08
who collects things that he retrieves
06:10
from people's throats
06:12
see a surgeon actually he's dead now
06:14
he's an old surgeon
06:15
so he has nails and bolts and binoculars
06:19
and a medallion
06:20
that says carry me for good luck sorry
06:22
binoculars yeah
06:23
like miniature i reckon yeah they'd have
06:25
to be many wasn't they
06:27
why have you all got old miniature oh
06:28
yes
06:31
that you're always swallowing why would
06:32
you actually i've never seen a set of
06:34
binoculars so small that i thought to
06:36
myself
06:36
i could swallow that yeah i think you
06:39
get ones that you can fold up as well
06:40
can't you
06:41
yes i don't know just fold up and tuck
06:45
in your cheeks
06:46
what was the thing about cheeks and
06:48
hamsters that you felt oh um
06:49
that ham so they x-rayed a hamster while
06:51
i was eating so they stuffed their food
06:53
into these pouches
06:54
their pouches go all the way back to
06:55
their hips when they shoved the fruit
06:57
and they just shove it and shove it and
06:58
the hamster pouch goes
06:59
all the way back to their hips yeah
07:01
they're greedy things that's
07:02
extraordinary
07:03
like where their legs are yeah i think
07:06
that's where i assume they'd be but i
07:08
think they have hip bones i would say
07:11
yeah
07:11
whales have hip bones which i'm not sure
07:13
if we mentioned on this pocket no i
07:14
don't think we have
07:16
whales have got headbutts and also
07:17
sometimes they'll grow legs
07:19
like a kind of a vested vested your leg
07:21
from the side of the body
07:23
yeah is it was it wales yeah so we knew
07:25
they came on land at some point
07:26
didn't like it went back to the sea yeah
07:32
and so this guy's chevalier jackson um
07:34
he
07:35
says that parents who feed peanuts to
07:37
children without molars should be hung
07:39
drawn and quartered
07:41
uh he's very you know very serious about
07:43
not putting things down children's
07:45
throats basically he
07:46
says people could should chew their milk
07:48
by which meals
07:49
yeah you put it in your mouth and you
07:50
swish it around so saliva can get around
07:52
it and then you could
07:54
drink it do you do many people well i
07:57
suppose he would know
07:58
would people oh he wouldn't choke on
08:00
milk i don't think
08:01
if it's off milk yeah he refused to
08:04
cheer on his football team as he thought
08:05
it would damage his larynx
08:07
and he only ever at postage stamp size
08:10
sandwiches for lunch
08:11
how many did he have
08:15
the huge stamps that he had novelty
08:19
there's a tiny slice of bread with a
08:21
single lettuce leaf in between
08:23
there's another guy a librarian called
08:25
graham barker he has the um
08:27
world record for collecting belly button
08:29
fluff
08:30
how hotly contested is this record
08:33
i don't imagine there are many
08:34
submissions every year well it's true
08:36
does he turn up and defend his title
08:39
he's been doing it for 26 years so if
08:41
you want to start now it'll be a long
08:43
time before you catch up
08:44
is it all his own it's all his own yeah
08:46
oh it's
08:47
i mean i reckon you could beat the
08:48
record pretty quickly with the door to
08:50
door around wow
08:51
yeah you could um you could do a
08:52
kickstarter for it yeah so this guy
08:53
graham barker
08:54
who says he is not obsessive vows to
08:57
continue
08:58
until he is no longer capable
09:03
he says he harvests it every night and
09:04
places it in a clay pot
09:06
harvests because normally harvests
09:09
provide nice things like grain
09:14
that's an annual harvest festival people
09:17
sing
09:18
celebratory science i think probably the
09:21
latest the
09:21
new thing to collect is data about
09:23
yourself that's the thing
09:24
it's a huge trend isn't it people have
09:27
charts
09:28
you know you can wear smart watches and
09:29
things that measure your blood flow and
09:31
your
09:32
energy and your calories and your
09:33
expenditures every yeah your steps
09:35
everything
09:36
can be just laid out so neatly it's hard
09:38
to imagine anyone wanting to buy that
09:40
off you in the future though
09:42
yeah yeah but maybe that'll be instead
09:44
of the collected letters it'll be the
09:45
collected glucose expenditure of pg
09:47
woodhouse or whatever
09:49
in shops um do you have the last thing
09:52
charles autry did
09:53
no oh yeah he he threw he threw a vars
09:56
at his nurse who asked for an autograph
09:59
that was his last act
10:00
but if he's dying you shouldn't really
10:01
bother a pro-man i mean she said it was
10:03
an autograph it was an order of
10:05
the bottom of a piece paper that said i
10:06
leave my nurse
10:13
okay time for fact number two that is
10:15
james okay my fact this week is
10:17
that in 1937 you could visit
10:20
romford dog track and watch cheetahs
10:23
racing
10:24
you don't mean people who've been taking
10:25
dope
10:28
no and this was a guy an explorer called
10:30
kenneth gandardawa who brought
10:32
a dozen cheetahs from kenya to the uk so
10:35
that they could watch them race and bet
10:37
on the outcome
10:38
surely it's difficult to get a cheetah
10:39
to chase an electric rabbit
10:41
yeah that was a problem actually they
10:42
did find that was the problem yeah i
10:43
mean the thing would be to release
10:45
pray amazing yeah that was a problem
10:48
basically they weren't really interested
10:50
in racing
10:51
and so it only happened twice and they
10:52
just gave it up wow
10:54
the amazing thing about this fact which
10:56
you told me was that it was at this
10:58
point that they realized greyhounds
10:59
weren't the fastest animals yeah until
11:01
that it was thought in
11:02
britain at least that greyhounds were
11:03
the fastest animals in the world
11:05
but then they brought their cheetahs in
11:07
and they just shaved so much time off
11:08
their
11:09
records that they realized that their
11:10
cheetahs were faster well the cheetahs
11:12
they could hit
11:12
68 miles an hour sorry 65 miles an hour
11:15
and 43 for the
11:17
for the greyhound i think they can go up
11:18
to about 100 kilometers an hour
11:20
uh it was often thought that that was
11:23
impossible and maybe it was a myth
11:24
because it was only one ever
11:26
study that ever proved that but then
11:29
they've started putting tracking devices
11:30
on that on colors on cheetahs in the
11:32
wild and they found that it is true
11:33
after all oh they were saying as well
11:35
and i don't understand this but they're
11:36
saying that cheetahs when they
11:37
accelerate they change gears
11:39
like the like a car changing gears as
11:41
they're running they suddenly just yeah
11:42
yeah they go into a different stride a
11:44
different
11:44
different gate and yeah i just love that
11:47
they've changed
11:47
gears mid it's brilliant yeah they're
11:49
kind of like a horse like walking that
11:50
was they walked in a truck than a
11:52
gallops
11:52
counters but so they were saying with
11:54
greyhounds it's what they do is they
11:56
they then change the number of steps
11:58
that they take as they're running and
12:00
that picks up the speed whereas
12:01
greyhounds take exactly the same number
12:03
of steps
12:03
no matter how fast they're going so the
12:05
feet just get like crazy fast they don't
12:07
understand
12:08
like a cartoon yeah yeah exactly but
12:10
they sound incredibly glamorous
12:12
and i've been to a few dog tracks
12:13
there's not a glamorous night out
12:15
of cheetahs though yeah i think it's
12:18
quite james bond sounds very vegas
12:20
it is this this guy um kenneth gandaldo
12:23
was quite glamorous himself um he once
12:26
um brought a male cheater on a leash
12:28
into queen's club
12:29
whatever queen's club is i don't know
12:30
what that is not the tennis club oh yeah
12:33
it probably is yeah yeah
12:34
and it was rubbish it didn't return a
12:36
single serve
12:39
it was very fast but when it got to the
12:40
ball it killed three ball boys
12:43
the other thing is that they couldn't
12:45
negotiate tight bends the cheetahs
12:47
apparently
12:48
like greyhounds can i read that they
12:50
just cut the corners
12:52
yeah ironically making them cheaters in
12:54
the race
12:55
and they were marketed as cats v dogs
12:58
which is such a great
12:59
idea racing against greyhounds yeah yeah
13:02
sometimes so you don't see their races
13:04
you have five greyhounds and then one
13:06
cheetah and
13:07
um so the the greyhounds i think all
13:09
chased after that yeah and the cheetah
13:11
did it a couple of times but then it
13:12
quickly realized this is a mechanical
13:14
hair
13:14
yeah there's nothing else the
13:15
greyhound's not freaking out that there
13:17
was a cheater
13:21
but what happened the cheetah would
13:22
often kind of just stay at the back and
13:24
be like oh i'm not really bothered and
13:25
then something would catch its eye and
13:27
then it would
13:27
speed up and then go miles faster than
13:29
the greyhounds
13:30
so it'd be like a proper under underdog
13:33
victory you know like in a movie
13:35
right at the back this this would be
13:37
this would be the move if you were
13:38
having this but
13:39
if you knew that a race was going to be
13:41
you know five dogs and a cheater
13:43
the thing to do is in the car on the way
13:45
just to have a friendly vet with the
13:46
person with sailors now i'm going to
13:47
take trap seven i just i love it i just
13:49
i want traffic
13:51
and you have the person will be all
13:52
right because obviously they've got
13:54
if they've got six spots and you've got
13:56
one you're in great shows you'd have the
13:58
bet and then when you got there
14:00
and they saw it was a cheater they'd
14:01
feel tricked and then you'd sell the bet
14:03
back to them for a huge sum
14:04
oh yeah and then the dogs would all race
14:06
off and the cheetah would go well i
14:08
can't be bothered with it i mean that's
14:09
a win-win it's what they call going all
14:10
green
14:11
you're in your you're betting and laying
14:12
at the same time so every outcome is
14:14
successful
14:15
you could definitely negotiate a
14:16
position where you're winning whatever
14:18
just because you know there's a cheater
14:19
in your race um this is that thing about
14:21
um
14:21
winning both ways i write about this guy
14:23
called um brian zembic
14:24
who bet his friend friends over he bet
14:27
his pal a hundred thousand dollars that
14:29
he would get breast implants for a year
14:30
and he did it but he still has them this
14:33
was uh about eight years ago
14:34
but this was the moronic thing about
14:36
this is what i want to say to brian
14:37
zembits
14:39
exactly the kind of proposition bet you
14:41
have to never take prop bets
14:43
which is you know on on certain sort of
14:46
outcomes that might be under a person's
14:47
control you can take
14:48
a weight loss bet you know certainly
14:51
whether or not someone will get
14:53
breast implants he just will get them
14:58
you know i bet me i won't do that i
14:59
think this is a ridiculous because i
15:00
think what happened here basically is
15:02
they've paid him to do it haven't they
15:03
because like you say if you give him
15:04
enough money he will do it
15:06
and they've just found the price you
15:09
have a lot of that yes i want
15:10
a better guy but then he's not really a
15:12
bet james dempsey flushy they called him
15:14
a very good poker player
15:15
but i i had as it were a bet with him
15:16
that he wouldn't turn up to the world
15:17
series of poker
15:18
wearing an outfit that i'd selected for
15:21
him from the
15:22
mall and he accepted the things we both
15:24
knew i knew i couldn't remove
15:26
that 500 maybe i knew he would wear
15:28
anything yeah
15:29
for the money and he knew that i was
15:31
happy to pay firefighters see him walk
15:33
into the room
15:34
dressed in you know i just had a
15:35
fantastic afternoon going around
15:37
terrible glittering hats and i didn't go
15:40
for
15:41
something really outlandish like you
15:43
know a costume
15:44
i went for something that would make him
15:46
look like a real
15:47
tosser so i think it was like a t-shirt
15:51
with a straight flush on it
15:54
sort of vegas tourist hat but also i
15:57
mean he also had to factor in you know
15:58
it's a ten thousand dollar tournament
16:00
and he needs to have the the sort of
16:01
peace of mind just sit down dress like
16:03
that and have everyone think he's a real
16:04
idiot
16:05
and play anyway but that's a different
16:07
because there's problems
16:08
you know the the famous one the ones are
16:10
always great at the sort of the
16:11
trickster gamblers
16:13
like titanic thompson and uh you know
16:15
amarillo slim and people who
16:17
tricked people into bets that weren't
16:20
really
16:20
what they sounded like so the favor for
16:22
example titanic thompson
16:24
once you know he bet with the guy there
16:25
was a watermelon truck was going past
16:28
and he
16:28
bet how many oh i reckon there's you
16:30
know 40 watermelons on that truck the
16:32
other guy said you know 100. but of
16:34
course thompson
16:35
had paid the man to drive past at that
16:38
moment with the watermelons on the truck
16:40
or um amarillo still had a lot of them
16:41
he had a bet uh once you know he he bet
16:44
a golfer
16:45
that he could hit a golf ball further
16:48
than him and the guy he never met this
16:49
person he's like what kind of idiot is
16:51
this snippet
16:51
and slim city but you know i'm choosing
16:53
the golf course that's fine
16:55
and he and uh you know but they chose
16:56
their own course so the golfer picked
16:58
his favorite course he hit the ball and
16:59
then they went to slim's choice
17:00
and it was a frozen lake so
17:06
and that kind of thing that that's
17:07
rather beautiful yeah you know someone's
17:09
just been done they haven't looked at
17:10
the small prints
17:11
yeah okay that's enough facts
17:15
let's have an advert all right uh this
17:17
is to remind you that today's
17:18

17:43
percent
17:44
ten percent of people are left-handed
17:45
give or take oh yeah is that right yeah
17:48
well on with the show eh on that
17:51
bombshell
17:53
okay time for fact number three and that
17:56
is anne
17:57
in 2010 the us military built a super
18:00
computer out of 1
18:01
760 playstation 3's wow
18:04
how's that even possible um it's not
18:06
okay it's not possible anymore they
18:07
basically got really lucky so basically
18:09
sony did a um
18:10
an upgrade so you can't mess with the
18:11
places they got really lucky
18:24
so basically they wanted to build the
18:25
super computer and at the time
18:27
playstation 3's cost 400 but the
18:29
equivalent computing power would be ten
18:30
thousand dollars each and they needed
18:31
obviously 160 is quite a lot
18:34
so they got all these playstations wired
18:35
them up together and they hacked them
18:37
so they're all joined together and
18:38
they're running off linux which is
18:39
rather than running on playstation games
18:41
and then yeah it's using the us military
18:43
they're using it to track stuff and it
18:44
was
18:44
definitely was either that or
18:48
someone said to that department i see
18:50
you've ordered 1700
18:52
playstation 3. yeah no
18:59
but when they did it it was the 33rd
19:01
biggest computer in the world when they
19:02
completely
19:04
i saw a list of the 500 fastest
19:06
supercomputers
19:07
in the world um and there the number one
19:10
is called
19:11
tianae2 it's in china uh and that means
19:14
milky way
19:16
because it can do as many calculations
19:18
per second as there are stars in the
19:19
milky way
19:20
but the interesting thing i thought is
19:22
it's been number one for four years
19:25
it's a lot faster than the one below it
19:26
as well but you would kind of think
19:28
that because of mars law or whatever
19:30
that it would they would get faster and
19:31
faster but this one's been number one
19:33
for
19:33
all that time the other thing i love
19:35
about that lister is that a lot of super
19:36
computers sound like they belong on
19:37
gladiators
19:38
so there's like i went down so there's
19:40
titan vulcan lightning falcon shadow
19:42
crystal mac man
19:43
maverick and super computer system for
19:46
statistical science i
19:47
he was a great gladiator
19:50
also the 192nd most powerful
19:52
supercomputer is called gordon
19:55
good it's a good solid name the famous
19:58
one's watson isn't it who won
20:00
jeopardy um a few years ago if you
20:02
remember that
20:03
um he obviously doesn't do that anymore
20:05
and so he's now making
20:06
uh he's working as a chef coming up with
20:09
new dishes
20:10
so he takes all of the different um men
20:12
all the different dishes and all of
20:14
different ingredients
20:15
and he mixes them up and supposedly uses
20:17
his intelligence to make new dishes
20:23
how does that differ from a
20:24
seven-year-old
20:26
well it differs in that it can't do it
20:28
very well and a seven-year-old probably
20:29
can
20:30
there was an article a new scientist and
20:32
they tried to get some of the
20:34
um dishes they had one of them a creme
20:37
fraiche had been replaced by a glass of
20:39
milk
20:39
and another one the tuna bake could
20:41
replace the tuna with a kilo of goose
20:43
meat
20:46
no one ever wants even a small amount of
20:48
goose meat
20:50
i was watching watson's actually
20:51
appearance in jeopardy and everyone's
20:52
like oh he makes a graft two minutes in
20:54
because he
20:55
watson repeats the same answer someone
20:56
else had already given i was like we're
20:58
still being beaten by a machine i would
20:59
like that one slide
21:00
yeah yeah and they can presumably
21:03
commute computers can make a limited
21:04
number of gaffs at the moment they can't
21:06
be involved in a race scandal
21:07
and they can't keep it
21:10
that's when we'll know we'll have
21:11
artificial intelligence is when the
21:12
first computer is forced to resign
21:14
over an indiscrete late-night tweet
21:18
i read a real i started looking into
21:20
playstation so okay here's a really odd
21:22
thing i found out uh grand theft auto i
21:24
don't know if you guys know
21:26
yeah is it okay so grand theft auto 5
21:29

22:52
tyndall bible translation
22:55
and it's worked it's amazing i know i
22:57

22:59
around the corner in covent garden and
23:00
they have all the kind of you know just
23:02
classic movie merchandises and toys a
23:04
lot of action figures and
23:05
there's an apollo 13 toy there and
23:07
apollo 13 is my favorite movie
23:09
and it's a car that appears in the movie
23:11
i thought who
23:13
the hell is buying the car
23:17
apollo 13 the one with tom hanks goes to
23:19
space yes
23:20
is your favorite film yes yeah of all
23:22
the films that were ever made
23:24
wait wait don't ask him for his top five
23:26
because they it gets worse
23:27
i thought your favorite was grown-ups
23:29
too grown-ups too mean girls no apollo
23:31
13 because i love the story i just think
23:33
it's the greatest story but your
23:34
favorite
23:35
ever that's i remember a poll once
23:37
coming out about the greatest albums of
23:39
all time and number two
23:41
was the white album from the beatles
23:43
number one was stars by simply red
23:46
and maybe when people vote in these
23:47
things you literally have just
23:50
just written down the last album you
23:51
bought haven't you that yeah when's the
23:52
last time you heard stars but simply
23:54
because that's a fantastic app my
23:56
favorite album is just a recording of
23:58
martin luther
24:00
played every day it is it is maybe
24:02
they've looked at lego
24:04
with the playmobil thing and they've
24:05
thought because lego have diversified so
24:07
much into
24:07
robots and all these history you can buy
24:09
a lego un
24:11
building where you can just sort of have
24:12
meetings in it
24:14
in the 50s there was a barbie who came
24:16
with a book
24:18
which said don't eat on the cover
24:20
seriously yeah i
24:22
i think it was a dieting barbie or it
24:25
was a model barbie
24:26
i mean it was okay um super computers
24:29
um the world's fastest supercomputer who
24:31
i mentioned earlier
24:32
uses 99 of its volume to
24:35
cool to keep it cool correct i didn't go
24:38
to the museum of computing so
24:39
oh yes is that where you found this fact
24:41
yeah i went to the national museum
24:42
competing in bletchley last weekend and
24:44
it was
24:45
so so incredible if everyone's free it's
24:46
half an hour of london it's amazing and
24:48
they've got um
24:49
colossus which they which actually runs
24:51
they let it run and we watched it go
24:52
they've got um which was the oldest
24:54
computer that you could see being
24:55
programmed so as it does it's um
24:57
functions you see all different bits
24:58
lighting up and making wearing noises
24:59
they've got
25:00
this amazing like computer memory from
25:02
the 60s it's like whole like crates of
25:04
memory and it's worth like
25:05
20 bites yeah so it's amazing
25:08
i always think it's a bit sad the way
25:10
the first great thing
25:12
invented in some field is so rubbish i
25:15
i think it's sad it's like seeing old
25:16
all very old buildings which were
25:18
the absolute you know they were the best
25:20
thing in defense 500 years ago
25:23
isn't it anything at the time that's
25:27
someone so me a valentine's card and you
25:28
go wow but then you look at the later
25:30
upgrades yeah
25:31
yeah we had buzz aldrin on museum of
25:34
curiosity
25:35
and there was this amazing moment where
25:37
we gave him one of those singing
25:38
birthday cards
25:39
and he was you know as a wallace and
25:41
gromit one he just opened it and
25:43
the point that we had for him to hold
25:44
this and open it was that there was more
25:46
computing power
25:47
in that card than there was in the lunar
25:49
module you're just trying to make him
25:50
feel bad about himself well yeah
25:52
he was pretty pissed off with that he
25:54
threw the card up to the table he went
25:56
can this card land on the moon okay
25:59
sorry
26:00
i mean yeah yeah well that i mean it can
26:02
you just have you put it
26:05
and it can but not to make him feel
26:07
worse but
26:07
[Laughter]
26:09
uh my other favorite video game fact is
26:11
that in 2014 a goldfish played pokemon
26:14
what i'm totally going to train up the
26:15
office goldfish
26:16
i don't know what that sentence means so
26:18
pokemon's the video game where you
26:20
remember
26:20
like in the 90s
26:27
um and it had a web count if it swung
26:29
left the character went left if it went
26:31
right the character went right
26:32
and um apparently after the first few
26:34
hours it was reported that goldbridge
26:35
had chosen his first pokemon charmander
26:37
he'd named it a aaa bbk and one fight
26:39
against the squirtle
26:41
that doesn't mean it was playing pokemon
26:43
maybe it knew it was swimming about but
26:44
it's not got any hands
26:46
it would need some sort of motion
26:47
detection that's probably right inside
26:48
his head it was going
26:49
damn my lack of hands i would have
26:51
chosen a better name than aabbk
26:54
my name is terence i crave pokemon
27:01
okay time for our final fact and that is
27:03
andy
27:04
my fact is that in 1552 a man in england
27:07
managed to shoot himself to death with a
27:09
bow and arrow
27:10
which i think is a darwin award before
27:12
the fact how on earth is that even
27:14
possible
27:15
well his name was pert henry pert
27:19
and he was a gentleman he lived in
27:20
nottinghamshire and he was trying to
27:22
fire an arrow
27:23
straight up in the air history doesn't
27:25
record why
27:26
unfortunately but he drew the bow to its
27:29
full extent and then the arrow lodged
27:31
and while he was leaning over to look
27:34
it managed to unlodge itself and he died
27:36
the next day unfortunately for him
27:38
the next day i mean yeah i mean an hour
27:40
in his head
27:41
yeah but i just it's quite an
27:43
achievement because obviously with
27:45
handguns you know accidents happen but
27:46
with a bow and arrow you have to be
27:48
doing it quite badly wrong
27:50
um to kill yourself that way yeah yeah
27:52
but that's the thing
27:53
coroners in in the middle ages um have
27:56
recorded 56 ant
27:57
accidental deaths from people at archery
28:00
who were standing too close to the
28:02
targets or who just went and collected
28:04
arrows at the wrong time which had
28:05
already been fired i think it's a bit
28:07
unfair to say that the people were
28:08
standing too close to the target
28:10
it's more the guy who shot didn't hit
28:12
the target really
28:13
yeah yeah i mean it depends how bad the
28:15
archer was you're right yes remember the
28:16
olympics there was an archer who was
28:18
like a very famous celebrity gina davis
28:22
gina davis yeah she didn't quite make it
28:25
into the olympic team she placed 24th
28:27
out of 300 people that's you know i
28:29
didn't quite make it onto the internet
28:33
do you know i think if there's a linking
28:36
theme to this episode it's the sort of
28:38
tragedy
28:39
of the transience of an actor's life i
28:42
mean you've got
28:42
charles hawtry hoarding the bedsteads
28:45
gina davis
28:47
desperately trying and failing to make
28:48
the olympic archery team i mean
28:50
even the super computer has branched out
28:51
into cookery yeah that's true you do
28:53
realize
28:54
this isn't only connect we're not
28:55
looking for a link between all
28:58
[Laughter]
29:05
so some mortality things there was a um
29:09
greek philosopher called phylatus of cos
29:11
uh who studied erroneous word usage so
29:14
intensely that he wasted away and
29:16
starved to death
29:17
we but we all do know somebody like that
29:19
you know yeah
29:20
you get a sentence right somebody who's
29:21
such a pedant are you looking at me
29:25
captain panino yeah james won't let us
29:27
say panini because it's a plural you'd
29:28
say one penny no
29:29
if you order a panini he will make you
29:31
eat two of them yeah
29:34
you would say you order a panini
29:36
actually no i would say
29:37
i would i
29:51
james does i think here i would be
29:54
trapped between
29:55
not wanting to be grammatically
29:56
incorrect and not wanting to sound like
29:58
a wanker so
30:00
i think i'd have to find some middle
30:02
ground yeah see this is the kind of
30:03
argument we have today
30:04
james is wasting away at the moment
30:08
i found some stats in australia um
30:11
contact with a hot water tap is more
30:13
deadly than a venomous spider
30:15
in australia i'm sorry
30:18
but if you're a man that will go into a
30:20
sandwich shop and say i want a panino
30:22
i'm going to point out you that it isn't
30:23
okay more people might die as a result
30:26
but that doesn't make the hot water tap
30:28
more deadly than a poison you must have
30:29
seen the next
30:30
the latest series of i'm a celebrity get
30:32
me out of here but they have to be
30:33
locked in a cage with a hot water tap
30:35
it's the big series back home
30:37
australia's worst taps the most
30:39
dangerous tap
30:40
this week he's taking out superman yeah
30:43
wait so what
30:43
so they they would scold them to the
30:45
point of death yeah basically that wow
30:47
yeah being scalded is it only australia
30:50
australia is the only place i have
30:52
figures from i've not heard this this
30:53
isn't like a cultural thing that i was
30:55
called at school no i think it's more
30:57
that people this people think like bugs
30:59
and things and sharks are really deadly
31:00
but actually the amount of people they
31:01
kill
31:08
yeah but i mean isn't there a difference
31:09
between a kill and
31:11
stupidity isn't like the taps not trying
31:13
to kill like that's a good point
31:14
actually yeah
31:15
in the middle ages they would have put
31:16
the tap on trail as a deodorant as a
31:18
witch
31:19
yeah yeah as a satanic object if you
31:21
kill someone what was the word you said
31:23
a diode
31:24
what's that so it's like they would have
31:26
trials in the middle ages
31:27
if so like a bow of a tree had fallen on
31:29
someone they would put the power of the
31:31
tree on trial and
31:33
wow yeah i found a brilliant one on the
31:35
uh qa talk boards that between 1658 and
31:38
1663 there were four deaths recorded in
31:40
the parish of lamplow in cumbria for
31:42
um cause of death frightened to death by
31:44
fairies that is
31:46
that's an inexperienced coroner who
31:47
wants to cover cover his
31:49
back basically well they've changed the
31:51
rules now that you can't die
31:52
of natural causes in the uk so they have
31:55
to put something down on your death
31:56
certificate
32:01
this is quite a nice thing um the first
32:03
ever funeral flowers were thirteen
32:05
thousand years ago
32:06
which i find oh wow fascinating so
32:10
well they found stone age graves there's
32:12
a mediterranean culture called the
32:14
natufians
32:15
i'm sorry if i'm mispronouncing it
32:17
twenty twofen's listening
32:19
but they built the first cemeteries so
32:21
before that we there were only scattered
32:23
bodies
32:24
uh which had been buried but they were
32:26
the first people who where we found 100
32:27
bodies in the same place so we think
32:29
that's the cemetery
32:30
and archaeologists have found i think
32:32
the remains of flower beds
32:34
um which would have been around and
32:36
underneath the bodies as well so
32:38
that's the earliest evidence we have for
32:40
the use of flowers in a
32:42
funeral ritual if you like which i think
32:44
is amazing i think that's
32:45
rather nice actually um and they were
32:47
the first people who had a feast
32:49
first ever feast was the natufians and
32:52
it consisted of 71 turtles
32:53
no sorry 71 tortoises i when i was a kid
32:57
they so in hong kong they used to tell
32:59
us that you would it would be vertical
33:01
burials okay space have you guys heard
33:04
of that
33:05
i have heard of that yeah um a lot of
33:08
people live in cemeteries in cairo
33:10
and then they live in cemeteries there's
33:12
such a housing problem that thousands
33:14
upon thousands of people and they had
33:15
the city has these enormous cemeteries
33:17
it's where i i always blows like when we
33:20
found out
33:20
there's this thing about 30 million
33:22
people in china live in caves
33:25
they're just housed in caves when you
33:26
hear that i just always think i thought
33:28
i kind of thought i just knew where
33:29
everyone was
33:32
and then you discover there's just all
33:33
these people living in these
33:35
extreme locations i that's a big number
33:38
for a cemetery
33:39
yeah how many people would you expect
33:41
there to be well just none
33:42
i just saw that itself was already the
33:45
starting point
33:47
12. immediately yes he's about the right
33:50
number actually there is a fact
33:52
um about is it brookwood cemetery just
33:54
outside london
33:55
if all the bodies came back to life and
33:58
became zombies the population would be
34:00
higher than southampton
34:02
really yeah because so many people have
34:04
really gone a long way to come up with
34:06
that fact i'm sorry it was me
34:09
i mean given the unlikelihood of all of
34:11
the bodies coming to life here's my
34:12
favorite fact about southampton
34:13
southampton once and i
34:15
think this was in some time in the 80s
34:17
or early 90s southampton
34:19
came second in a poll of
34:22
the most boring towns in britain oh yeah
34:25
though what's brilliant about that is it
34:26
wasn't even interesting
34:28
i mean whatever one there's something
34:30
remarkable about that place yeah south
34:32
africa
34:32
so boring it's not even the most boring
34:37
that's brilliant okay that's it that's
34:40
all of our facts thanks so much for
34:41
listening if you want to get in contact
34:43

00:00
hi everybody it's andy here this is a
00:03
special bonus edition of no such thing
00:05
as a fish
00:06
which we have made to celebrate the fact
00:08
that we have just been nominated for a
00:09
chortle award
00:10
the churros are a very cool set of
00:12
comedy awards and we've been nominated
00:14
in the internet category which we think
00:17
means that we
00:18
are the best thing on the internet which
00:20
is pretty impressive because we are up
00:22
against quite a lot of pornography
00:24
so if you like the show and if you'd
00:26
like us to win the award we would be
00:28
hugely grateful if you could vote for us
00:30
you can do that by going to qi.com it's
00:34
really easy it takes about 20 seconds
00:36
and we would be
00:37
mega grateful if you could do that
00:39
voting closes at 9am on friday the 27th
00:41

00:47
the show bye
00:58
hello and welcome to another episode of
01:00
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
01:02
coming to you from the qi offices in
01:04
covent garden my name is dan schreiber
01:06
i'm sitting here with andy murray anna
01:08
chazinski and james harkin
01:09
and once again we have gathered around
01:11
the microphone with our four favorite
01:13
facts from the last seven days and
01:14
in no particular order here we go
01:17
starting with you
01:18
andrew hunter murray my fact is that
01:20
until the mid 2000s
01:22
the best method for finding out how many
01:24
pandas were alive was to sift through
01:25
their poo
01:26
was that where they were hidden
01:30
you just had to look for the white bits
01:34
yeah what does that mean well it's very
01:37
very hard to know how many pandas there
01:38
are we've got no idea how many
01:40
there are accurately and they do
01:41
censuses every so often
01:43
they can be very very they can be based
01:45
on a lot of guesswork
01:46
so the best method in the early 2000
01:48
census which came up with the total
01:50
number of
01:51
1596 which is very precise yeah
01:54
was to go around looking for panda
01:57
excrement
01:58
sift through it for undigested fragments
01:59
of bamboo and then find
02:01
tooth marks on that because tooth marks
02:03
have a particular
02:04
like fingerprints though they're
02:05
supposedly unique and that's
02:07
how you find out how many pandas so you
02:09
were looking for pandas inside the poo
02:11
yeah wow in a way yeah yeah yeah well
02:13
you're looking for the toothbrush it's a
02:14
different different tooth signature on
02:16
every bite
02:17
exactly every panda has its own
02:19
individual tooth marks so i guess with
02:20
pandas it must be particularly useful
02:22
because bamboo is like has such hard
02:24
cellulose doesn't it so it's very hard
02:25
to digest i think do they only digest
02:27
30 percent of it anyway or something and
02:29
the rest of it they're all wrong pandas
02:31
yeah they don't and they're carnivores
02:33
totally pandas are carnivals
02:35
they're meant to be they gave up eating
02:36
meat uh several million years ago but
02:39
they're still
02:39
built as carnivores uh they have a sixth
02:43
finger don't they they have an opposable
02:45
thumb or what acts effectively is an
02:46
opposable thumb
02:48
and uh there's a theory so it's for it's
02:50
actually just a protruding bit of bone
02:52
and it's mainly it's solely used to hold
02:54
bamboo for them to eat it
02:56
but i think now there's a theory that
02:57
that evolved back when they were
02:59
carnivores
03:00
um because it helped them i think it
03:02
helped them dig away at their prey to
03:03
try and kill each
03:04
other they do sometimes eat like insects
03:06
and stuff and little
03:08
um rodents if they can get their hands
03:10
on them but normally they can't because
03:11
they're pandas
03:12
and it's just very difficult for them to
03:13
do anything they're very slow moving
03:15
aren't they yeah
03:16
yeah sorry there's a theory that they're
03:18
only slow moving because they change
03:19
their diet
03:21
and because bamboo is so inefficient to
03:24
eat
03:25
they then had to slow down stop moving
03:26
around have less sex
03:28
become fat eat as much as you can all of
03:31
these behavioral changes
03:32
come from the evolutionary change which
03:34
is when there was bamboo everywhere and
03:35
it's basically like getting married
03:39
i don't know if there were ever thin
03:40
pandas it's kind of disgusting to think
03:42
of yeah just like really
03:44
buff pens walking sprinting incredibly
03:47
fast
03:49
and maybe they used to hyphenate because
03:50
that's the reason they didn't hibernate
03:51
isn't it it's because they can't bloody
03:53
take a pause from eating such
03:54
inefficient foods
03:56
people have said that huge amounts of
03:58
effort
03:59
focused on them and they're an
04:01
evolutionary
04:02
dead end which is not really fair
04:04
because we've removed all of their
04:06
habitat
04:07
um so for us to go around saying yeah
04:10
these guys are useless they've got
04:12
they eat bamboo and there's no bamboo
04:13
anywhere what the hell
04:15
um it's not really fair my buddy
04:19
uh simon what he's a scientist and he
04:21
does a lot of stand up he he knows and
04:23
he tells us great fact about
04:25
um the wwf and the panda logo do you
04:28
know why the panda is the logo for the
04:30
wwf
04:31
was it because they thought they would
04:32
die out no no it was a specific panda
04:35
because it's a specific panda isn't it
04:36
there's all the bases so this is so
04:38
peter scott who was the
04:40
co-founder of the wwf and who drew the
04:42
original logo he said
04:43
obviously they're furry and they're
04:44
beautiful and they're cute and people
04:45
respond to them but there's also
04:47
one major reason they're black and white
04:49
printing costumes it's a black and white
04:51
animal black and white printing that's
04:53
good yeah pandas
04:54
defecate 40 times a day
04:57
40 40 yeah i mean they eat a quarter of
05:00
their own weight in food every day
05:02
that's a lot of poo to sift through
05:03
though yeah yeah there's a lot of
05:05
evidence to
05:05
to gather your that's a lot of solid
05:07
bamboo to be coming out of you as well
05:09
no
05:10
and people people work it's so sad
05:12
people work for years
05:13
and never they go out to china as panda
05:15
researchers really excited and then they
05:17
just don't see any
05:18
i've read an article about the census
05:20
and uh there was a guy called daibo
05:22
who's a wildlife biologist in the
05:24
chinese forestry ministry and he said
05:26
to be honest i've been working in these
05:28
mountains for 20 years and i've never
05:29
seen a panda in the wild
05:33
because it's working at the wrong place
05:34
isn't it
05:37
but you just never see it and also when
05:39
you're doing a census you're not looking
05:40
up for them you're looking at the ground
05:42
desperately trying to spot their
05:43
excrement
05:43
yeah so it's entirely possible that
05:45
you'll miss one because it's so
05:47
[ __ ] lovely but also like these are
05:50
as you've said
05:50
fat lazy animals how slow is this guy
05:54
that he's able to find their excrement
05:56
but not find them they're obviously
05:58
close by
05:59
like for after 20 years if he's finding
06:01
it they're in the neighborhood they're
06:03
very shy they're very
06:06
each night did you see one today dear no
06:10
he's got his panda spotting notebook
06:13
with no entries in it
06:15
there's one guy every day who comes back
06:17
into the office while going i saw
06:18
nine today every day
06:22
um panda poo is well the world's most
06:26
expensive cup of tea
06:28
is made using panda poo it's this guy
06:30
called ann yanchi
06:32
and i think he started making it in 2013
06:35
and it costs 131 pounds for a cup and he
06:38
uses
06:39
10 tons of panda poo on his tea
06:41
plantation
06:42
to um to make his tea delicious
06:46
it
06:52
[Laughter]
06:55
apparently it gives it a rich a richer
06:58
taste
06:58
does it i bet it does yeah yeah i mean
07:01
we get a bit
07:02
sniffy about it but it's it's manure
07:04
it's using fertilizer yes yeah
07:06
no no i don't i thought it was in
07:07
because they they do sell dried out
07:09
panda poos
07:10
um you can buy as paper from certain
07:13
zoos in china so i just thought it might
07:14
be
07:15
you know why not they do flatten it
07:16
don't they they don't just tell you
07:18
just write on this
07:21
stick you get a really lumpy envelope i
07:24
think i know who it's from
07:27
just written on it still nothing
07:32
do you remember sorry speaking of doing
07:33
stuff to pandas we talked about that
07:35
story of the
07:36
italian circus no
07:40
an italian circus a couple of years ago
07:41
tried to pass off a pair of
07:43
chow chow dogs as pandas by painting
07:45
them um and they're in
07:46
they're in serious trouble now for
07:48
deceiving people and for animal cruelty
07:50
skeptical customers were told that the
07:52
two dogs a male and a female
07:54
were actually half panda half dog
07:56
hybrids so if you were skeptical
07:59
you said i think these look a bit weird
08:00
they expected you to believe imagine
08:03
that guy who works in china is
08:06
goes on holiday to italy and he's like
08:08
you know what
08:09
we're going to go to the zoo because
08:10
they've actually got packages you'll
08:11
finally get to see one
08:14
the first two lines in the panda
08:15
spotting notebook are then just crossed
08:17
out a few days later
08:21
[Laughter]
08:23
i like this actually in the article
08:25
about um in the article about the
08:27
disguised dogs
08:29
uh it finished with the line the owners
08:31
may be
08:32
facing additional charges for falsifying
08:34
the animal passports
08:35
the dogs from hungary also turned out to
08:37
be six months younger than the documents
08:47
the smithsonian got two pandas in 1976
08:50
or and i'm not sure if these were the
08:52
original panda diplomacy ones but they
08:54
were called
08:55
sing sing and lingling
08:58
and this was at the time when they
08:59
didn't really know how to encourage them
09:01
to breed properly
09:02
um and the sentence is just this is it's
09:04
a wonderful sentence
09:05
sing-sing failed at his early attempts
09:07
to inseminate lingling
09:08
not much of a surprise considering he
09:10
tried to mate with her ear
09:11
wrist and foot
09:15
how do you how do i mate with a wrist
09:23
okay time for fact number two and that's
09:25
my fact
09:26
my fact this week is that since 2007
09:29
the wikipedian brian henderson has made
09:32
more than 50
09:33
000 edits and all of them are exactly
09:35
the same
09:36
tracking down articles using the words
09:38
comprised of and changing them to
09:40
consists of that's dedication i love it
09:42
yeah what a great guy
09:44
who's definitely not wasting every
09:46
minute of his life doing something that
09:48
serves no
09:49
purpose he's not wasting every minute he
09:50
does have all his edits on a sunday
09:52
night
09:52
i believe yes yeah and he's really he's
09:55
a heathen as well
09:57
this guy makes all of his edits on a
09:58
sunday night he has a special
10:00
program he's written his own program
10:01
which identifies when people have newly
10:03
written
10:04
yeah comprises of or comprised of
10:07
he finds it and then he says and it
10:10
typically takes about 10 seconds
10:11
but that's because i've gotten really
10:13
really good at it
10:15
i've actually put a lot of thought into
10:16
those 10 seconds some of them take a lot
10:18
longer
10:18
some of them take minutes
10:21
the most edited entry on wikipedia is
10:25
what is the page for george w bush which
10:28
has been edited
10:29
45 000 times is it just do we put a
10:32
full stop after w or not yes it's all
10:35
that back and forth
10:36
it's been edited three times for every
10:38
word in the article
10:40
and i'm that says through to through
10:42
november 2013 i'm not sure if it's only
10:45
in that month it was edited three times
10:46
for everyone in the article or whether
10:47
that's
10:48
in total history but either way it's a
10:50
lot
10:51
here's a weird thing that guy brian
10:52
henderson so who does these 50 000 edits
10:54
i kind of thought that he must have the
10:56
record for most edits on wikipedia
10:58
and so i looked into a list of the most
11:00
edits ever actually
11:04
there's no dart in domain
11:07
um do you know uh what roughly what
11:10
number the most edits by single player
11:11
how many is this
11:12
50 000 okay so and he's been going every
11:15
sunday
11:15
since 2000. so times that by seven yes
11:18
so 350
11:20
000. what's the answer the answer is a
11:22
guy called his username is kowalf
11:24
koaf and he has done one million four
11:28
hundred and fifty five thousand
11:29
six hundred and ninety three edits wow
11:31
that's amazing
11:33
okay so i went on i went on to the
11:36
wikipedia page for pedant uh and that
11:39
has been
11:39
edited uh more than 500 times and i just
11:43
thought i'd read
11:44
i wonder if that was good
11:47
one of the things was there were some
11:48
quotes about pedantry on there
11:50
and one of the quotes is i am a pendant
11:53
when it comes to written english and
11:56
that's a quote by
11:57
garty vicksters it's like a jokey thing
11:59
because but someone in the edit page
12:01
wrote changed pedant back to pendant
12:05
yet again
12:08
so someone keeps changing that back that
12:10
must be really annoying
12:13
um i remember looking at the wikipedia
12:16
page
12:17
entitled the reliability of wikipedia
12:19
and finding the sentence
12:21
90 of articles on wikipedia exhibit
12:24
superior quality
12:26
and then in square brackets unreliable
12:28
source question mark
12:31
have you ever looked at the most popular
12:33
wikipedia pages for various countries
12:36
no no they're just quite bizarre so uh
12:39
in sweden in 2012 the
12:41
top wikipedia page that was searched
12:42
that was clicked on was we should guess
12:44
oh okay i think you'll guess this one
12:46
sweden william shakespeare
12:48
is that is there a clue where you're
12:49
saying will williams
12:58
[Laughter]
13:00
adult video actresses paige the best in
13:03
japan
13:04
um the second most clicked on wikipedia
13:05
page in spain in 2012 was for the app
13:08
symbol
13:08
wow and the most popular wikipedia page
13:11
in germany
13:12
that year was the page on cul-de-sacs
13:16
um you know that game that you do on
13:18
wikipedia where
13:20
you click on it and you're trying to get
13:22
through the whole of the
13:23
of the encyclopedia to get to a page
13:25
wiki race
13:26
yeah so you start you go from one word
13:28
to another yeah yeah
13:29
in germany they get to um cul-de-sac and
13:32
there's no links there
13:35
do you guys know what jimmy wales has
13:36
said his favorite wikipedia pages
13:38
was it was it wales no the country
13:43
was it's william shatner
13:46
sweden it's a very random one it's
13:49
it's a page called metal umlaut oh yeah
13:52
i know it's a yeah a page
13:54
devoted to heavy metal bands that put a
13:56
decorative umlaut
13:57
in their name oh yeah like the motley
14:00
crew
14:02
yeah yeah that's what he says and then
14:04
the other one is a um a page for
14:06
chocolate chip cookies
14:07
all right shall we one more you know uh
14:10
speaking of jimmy wales he
14:11
and the wikipedia foundation cracked
14:13
down a few years ago on u.s congress and
14:16
banned them
14:17
banned any ip address with any
14:18
association with u.s congress from
14:20
making any wikipedia edits
14:21
because they were it was during election
14:24
period and they were just constantly
14:25
vandalizing each other's pages
14:27
you do get that still from the house of
14:29
commons in the house of lords
14:30
lots of edits to wikipedia pages like
14:32
british politicians good use
14:34
dan and i went to a wikimania event
14:37
which is for lots of
14:38
wikipedians and lots of editors and
14:40
things like that and it was in london uh
14:42
last year yes and dan was doing a speech
14:45
about wikipedia and did you make a page
14:48
on the train yeah so yeah because one of
14:50
the speakers at it who's a comedian here
14:52
in london and a scientist called steve
14:54
cross who runs a thing called science
14:55
show off he came on
14:57
and he his whole talk was about how he
14:59
didn't have a wikipedia page
15:01
and you made one for him no i i knew
15:03
that he wasn't notable about enough
15:05
to make a wikipedia page that's what the
15:06
problem was that he was saying that he
15:08
can't get one
15:08
so what i made was one of those list
15:10
pages and the list
15:12
was called the title of the page was
15:13
people who don't have wikipedia pages
15:15
and i put him as the first name and they
15:18
deleted it within a minute
15:21
so can i read you just i have one more
15:23
thing about this which is that
15:25
what i really really like about the guy
15:27
uh mr henderson yeah um
15:29
and i think yeah i mean i i quite like
15:31
his mission i i wouldn't do it myself
15:33
but it's quite it's quite
15:34
sweet in a way i think it's sloppy
15:36
english i don't necessarily think it's
15:37
wrong but
15:38
the first edit he made was on the 14th
15:40
of august 2006
15:41
which was for the article central
15:44
processing unit
15:45
oh yeah right now the next one he made i
15:48
think he made some other wikipedia edits
15:49
in between but the next one he made for
15:51
comprised of was on the 4th of january
15:54
2007
15:55
so that's about that's about four months
15:57
difference
15:58
i just wonder what he did in that four
16:00
months he must have been thinking about
16:02
it
16:03
yeah i'm glad i did that and i'll just
16:06
do one more
16:08
just one i've done one i'll do another
16:10
one there probably aren't too many more
16:11
there was a point where he had dealt
16:13
with all of them yes every
16:14
single one on wikipedia and then of
16:16
course because people write more
16:18
articles and it gets
16:18
also people get a bit proprietorial
16:21
sometimes about
16:22
their articles or articles that they've
16:24
been editing a lot yeah and so
16:26
if he changes it and they change it back
16:28
he tries not to immediately
16:30
uh correct that again because he doesn't
16:31
want to get on his nerve so that i think
16:33
that was
16:33
quite a friendly and the other one the
16:35
other one that he has
16:36
is that obviously if you are quoting
16:39
someone and they've used the words
16:41
comprised of you can't change that that
16:43
just sits there
16:44
and so he gets frustrated he found like
16:45
150. my favorite thing about this fact
16:48
is that our show no such thing as a fish
16:51
has a wikipedia page in which all of our
16:53
facts are put up on wikipedia yeah
16:55
and now there's gonna be 151 because
16:57
this will now be a quote that he can't
16:58
change
17:00
we're putting comprised of into our wiki
17:02
page because it's a fact that we've just
17:04
said
17:04
oh that's so cool and it's so cool
17:06
because it's a fact that's going to have
17:07
his name in it as well
17:08
hi brian hey brian
17:13
okay time for fact number three and that
17:15
is james harkin
17:17
my fact is that the world's largest saw
17:19
is used to cut through mountains in
17:21
kazakhstan
17:22
why are they cutting through mountains
17:24
in kazakhstan mining they're just mining
17:26
yeah they're looking for coal it's a
17:29
very impressive looking machine it's
17:30
terrifying
17:31
it looks just like a circular saw only
17:34
lots bigger
17:35
do you know how big it is yeah it's 145
17:38
feet
17:38
uh in diameter and it weighs 45 000 tons
17:43
and it just basically anything in its
17:45
path
17:46
just gets sold out of the way can they
17:48
change the axis
17:49
of it so that it can cut at an angle i
17:52
don't know
17:52
i don't think they can because you'd be
17:54
very frustrated
17:55
if the thing you wanted was horizontal
17:58
and
17:59
you can only cut vertically you probably
18:01
can move it but it is really really
18:03
really heavy
18:04
well it takes like 27 people to operate
18:05
it right yeah yeah so you've got one
18:07
person sitting inside apparently that's
18:09
the prime position
18:10
26 people outside yeah yeah
18:16
you can dig out 4 500 tons of coal an
18:19
hour
18:20
and you say weighs 45 000 tons yup
18:22
bloody hell i know
18:24
that's really heavy yeah but i just love
18:26
this like the whole thing of big
18:28
machinery and stuff
18:29
yeah it's a nice subject so the world's
18:31
biggest boring machine
18:33
the tunneling as in boring yeah and it's
18:35
under they're using it to make a tunnel
18:37
in seattle at the moment
18:38
and it's got stuck so it's stuck
18:40
underneath seattle
18:42
oh no that's a that would be a great
18:44
sequel to sleepless in seattle
18:46
i read the other day that birmingham
18:48
university has a bunch of
18:50
uh disused tunnels under it which were
18:52
built in 1902
18:53
for mining students so they could
18:55
practice mining so they're fake mining
18:57
tunnels
18:57
i love it that cool do you think they
18:59
built it only a little bit underground
19:01
because obviously it would be a massive
19:02
amount of effort to build a fake mining
19:04
tunnel
19:04
yeah they were 200 feet down yeah i
19:06
think they only went about 20 feet down
19:08
or something
19:08
i have a cool fact about mines the very
19:11
deepest mines
19:12
you can't go down in just one lift
19:14
because the weight of the cable
19:16
is so much that it would snap uh when
19:19
you're in the the capsule at the bottom
19:21
of the cable
19:22
so you have to go down and then get
19:23
another lift even further down that's
19:25
how deep into the ground
19:26
is that also true of like super towers
19:28
as well
19:30
because i know i've been up some of the
19:32
tallest towers in the world and you
19:33
always are on more than one left there
19:35
definitely in the kuala lumpur um the
19:38
kl1
19:39
yeah but there are two towers there so
19:40
obviously you're gonna have two lifts
19:45
no sorry i have a thing about cables
19:47
which is that alaskan whales
19:50
use cables like fishing rods and
19:53
fishing lines to eat their fish which is
19:56
really interesting
19:57
i saw this in a documentary the other
19:58
day so these fishermen go out and they
20:00
throw these huge cables down into the
20:01
bottom of the ocean and they attach the
20:03
side of it on hooks all these big fish
20:05
and so bigger fish come and latch onto
20:07
and start eating it
20:08
and the whales have worked out that if
20:10
you slide down this cable with your
20:12
mouth open
20:13
you can eat all the fish so when they
20:14
come up it's half eaten and fish so they
20:16
go fishing now these alaskan whales are
20:18
deficient amazing yeah it's really it's
20:20
a very cool look they've got all this
20:21
documentary footage um back to swords
20:24
quickly
20:24
um do you guys know why the chainsaw was
20:26
first invented
20:27
for childbirth wasn't it yeah i think it
20:30
was all for
20:31
um so it was in 1783 i think and it was
20:34
just a little hand version of a chainsaw
20:36
handheld version of a chainsaw
20:38
um and yeah it was for symphysiotomy
20:41
which is a surgical procedure where
20:43
you cut the cartilage to widen the
20:45
pelvis when
20:46
a woman's giving birth yeah so that's
20:50
nice
20:50
and to cut bones generally so they were
20:52
really useful in surgery in the 19th
20:53
century weren't they they were mainly
20:54
used by
20:55
doctors to cut to amputate bones they
20:57
were called sore bones
21:00
i was looking at a list of different
21:01
saws and there is
21:04
i know it wasn't called once or two saw
21:06
three
21:08
um apparently there is a saw called a
21:10
cold saw
21:11
really yeah it's quite nice yeah do you
21:14
know what it
21:15
is it cooled down to cut through hot
21:17
things or is it it basically transfers
21:19
the heat to
21:20
the thing that it cuts so the actual saw
21:22
itself doesn't get too hot
21:25
it's very clever yeah but the thing
21:26
you've sold into is freaking boiling on
21:28
fire
21:30
hey so um i was i was looking into
21:32
mountains oh yeah can i bring it to
21:33
mountains very quickly please
21:34
uh i've found the smallest mountain in
21:37
the world
21:39
that's amazing yeah because i just
21:40
thought there must be one right there
21:42
must be
21:42
the smallest i thought you had to be a
21:44
certain number of feet to be a mountain
21:45
well okay so this one is officially
21:47
registered as a mountain okay it's in
21:50
australia and it's called mount witchy
21:53
proof
21:54
it's actually an aboriginal word which
21:56
is two words witchy and poor
21:58
and it means grass on a hill and it
21:59
totally makes sense because when you
22:00
look at
22:01
this it's the smallest mountain it's 141
22:05
feet high so why is it claiming to be a
22:07
mountain it's just
22:08
it's just registered as a mountain it
22:10
qualifies as a mountain
22:12
i mean i guess a mountain must start at
22:13
some height and yeah it's it does
22:15
the smallest that's where it starts oh
22:17
that's what it is a hundred forty one
22:19
feet
22:20
starts at something like 600 meters but
22:22
i think that it's one of those things
22:23
like the definition of a county which is
22:25
quite fluid
22:26
i think you can get registered as a
22:27
mountain by various dodgy
22:29
you know organization australia got an
22:31
internet
22:32
uh registry mountain circle i think it
22:34
was a black market you know i got my
22:36
license in an hour online
22:40
just 200 australian dollars either
22:43
yourself
22:46
uh this is my cat who is a mountain
22:51
mr tibbles many people have tried
22:53
scaling him but died in the attempt
22:56
yeah there is a rule about how high they
22:58
are in the uk which is why
23:00
that movie the man who went up a hill
23:02
and came down a mountain
23:03
the best hugh grant movie ever made is
23:05
that what it's about it's about the
23:06
registration of mountains
23:08
it's about him making the hill very
23:10
slightly bigger
23:14
i remember it's really sad you watch the
23:16
film and it's one of those films it
23:17
reminded me of rabbit proof fence
23:18
because
23:19
you follow hugh and this struggle to
23:20
turn this other mountain by adding a
23:22
pile of rocks to it or something i can't
23:23
remember
23:24
and then the little write up at the end
23:25
which tells you what happened afterwards
23:27
i think it's based on a true story says
23:28
a few years later it was then
23:30
reclassified as a hill again
23:32
sorry is that really what the film's
23:34
about yeah do you think i was making it
23:36
up
23:36
no i thought you were just running
23:38
because i knew the title of the film
23:40
but i just i just couldn't possibly
23:42
believe that that was what it was about
23:44
basically hugh grant goes up this hill
23:46
and then goes on the internet and buys
23:48
it
23:51
why does he have rocks because it's just
23:53
missing out on a high yeah it was like
23:54
it was like one meter shot of being a
23:56
mountain
23:56
why did he want to make it a mountain
23:58
because the village was all proud of it
23:59
you've got to watch the film it's a very
24:01
touching kind of local story film
24:03
okay and he's got weirdly floppy
24:05
straight hair sounds awful
24:09
i'm sure it's very weird
24:15
okay time for our final fact the show
24:17
and that is jazinski
24:19
my fact is that in the early days of
24:21
race walking or speed walking
24:23
uh the competitors were allowed to jog
24:25
as necessary to relieve cramp
24:28
as in could they jog forward or would
24:30
they have to jog on the spot
24:31
so it's unclear no i think they could
24:33
jog forward so it seems to have been
24:34
more of a gentlemanly
24:36
thing to do was to admit when you didn't
24:38
have cramp and therefore walk and
24:40
and the understood rule was uh fair heel
24:43
and toe
24:44
which as you can imagine is you have to
24:46
have your toe
24:47
on the ground at the same time as your
24:48
heel if the other foot hits the ground
24:50
right um there's one football team it
24:53
was the one that wc
24:54
grace played for and whenever they got a
24:57
penalty they always deliberately missed
24:59
the penalty because they couldn't
25:00
believe that the other team would
25:01
deliberately follow them in the area
25:02
very good
25:03
that's great so yeah race walking
25:07
yeah you were saying about the
25:08
pedestrianism uh yeah so pedestrianism
25:10
was where where we got the support of
25:12
speed walking and
25:14
it started with british footman in the
25:17
16th 17th centuries
25:18
and it became a kind of a thing that
25:20
gentlemen liked to do was compete over
25:22
how good their footmen were so a footman
25:23
obviously had to walk
25:24
next to a carriage well that's also a
25:26
good way that sport used to be where you
25:28
didn't have to do it yourself you could
25:29
get your slaves
25:31
instead exactly um and it was like a big
25:34
a big gambling thing as you can imagine
25:35
a lot of bets were placed on these
25:36
people
25:37
anyway um britain in the early 19th
25:39
century and the most popular in america
25:41
in the late 19th i think
25:42
and they were pretty easy going
25:44
rule-wise i really like the
25:46
the notion that because they they would
25:48
do these walks which lasted for six days
25:50
that's how the competitions were yeah
25:52
and they would start on sunday at
25:54
midnight
25:54
basically wait so this is the original
25:56
this is when it was returned
25:58
so just to put this in context as well
25:59
so this was in the late 1800s it
26:01
suddenly became
26:02
the big sport in america people were
26:05
dying to see people walk
26:07
the story that i read which is from a
26:09
book that you got this fact from right
26:10
which is
26:11
pedestrianism by matthew algo or al gayo
26:14
came out last year
26:15
yeah so from what i read it is that it
26:17
kind of started as a craze
26:18
when a person had a bet with someone
26:21
else about who was going to win the
26:22
presidential election
26:23
and the loser of the bet had to walk all
26:26
the way
26:27
to the inauguration and that was a
26:29
10-day walk i believe from boston
26:31
uh to washington d.c and lincoln won the
26:34
election
26:35
and this guy lost his bet he did the
26:37
walk and it got such press that all
26:38
these people came to watch it
26:40
and he had such a success that he kind
26:41
of just went and there was a line that i
26:43
read
26:43
it which i loved it said let's take this
26:45
indoors
26:46
and he started walking around a rink and
26:48
he started making money for it
26:50
and then it turned into this big sport
26:51
where everyone started competing and
26:53
they
26:53
ended up using the original madison
26:55
square garden and huge crowds came in so
26:57
what's the thing because
26:59
people they wouldn't have had cars in
27:00
those days presumably so people would
27:02
walk from miles around
27:04
to see other people walking but they
27:06
walked through from what i read in this
27:08
book
27:08
21 hours a day for six days it's amazing
27:11
it's insane and they had a cot on the
27:13
side
27:14
that they would take naps in which must
27:16
have been really hard with the thousands
27:17
of screaming
27:18
shoes but yeah and they would cover
27:21
about 600 miles i think in the six days
27:23
about 100 miles a day but if they were
27:25
racing as well i do love those naps as
27:27
the kind of like
27:28
the formula one so yeah yeah but you'd
27:30
go in and have a three hour nap and then
27:32
you'd wake up and be like
27:33
i'm still two laps ahead while you were
27:36
nothing people would come in and change
27:37
your things very
27:38
very slowly change your diapers
27:41
because presumably you'd have to go to
27:43
the bathroom at times yeah i wonder what
27:45
you do there presumably there was a
27:47
toilet they're like a potter lou and
27:48
they just happened maybe
27:49
yeah maybe in the middle of the in the
27:51
cart
27:54
that's why they only really stayed in
27:55
there for about three hours good
27:57
motivation to get out and get back
27:58
walking i think you should ever have
28:00
children
28:02
i very much admire marathon walkers and
28:04
runners for their ability to just
28:06
have a [ __ ] and a piss wherever they got
28:08
them like like what was paula
28:11
yeah i think that's not dedicated to the
28:13
sport i think you don't really care
28:14
about that kind of thing
28:15
that's what i mean it's true the newborn
28:17
babies are the most dedicated
28:19
sporting athletes i was just going to
28:21
say the guy that dan was talking about
28:23
is called edward payson weston and yeah
28:24
so they did have it before because it
28:25
was very popular in britain and in the
28:27
same kind of format in the early 19th
28:29
century but yeah he was the first big
28:31
star of it i think
28:32
and he i think might have been also the
28:34
first case or one of the first cases of
28:37
a doping scandal
28:38
uh because he got in trouble for winning
28:41
a race under the influence of coca
28:42
leaves
28:43
which was not actually against the rules
28:45
but it was thought to be again very
28:47
unsportsmanlike and people were really
28:48
upset at his outright
28:50
cheating um he admitted that he used the
28:52
coca leaves in the race in 1876 but he
28:54
said he it was under the advice of his
28:56
doctor
28:56
i'm so perfectly okay we've all used
28:58
that excuse when found with cocaine at
29:00
work
29:01
do you know what the first doping
29:03
offense in the olympics was
29:05
was it in ancient greece wasn't it was
29:09
it was it
29:09
alcohol yeah and the first one two beers
29:12
and it was a guy i think it was in
29:14
shooting it was in the shooting and he
29:16
had two beers to calm his nerves
29:18
yeah and they said that wasn't allowed
29:20
so that's great of all the sports to be
29:21
drunk
29:22
and do most dangerous for the spectators
29:25
so there's one more thing about that guy
29:26
weston who walked to the white house he
29:29
didn't make it in time for the
29:30
inauguration
29:31
he was several hours late and then
29:33
president and he met president lincoln
29:35
and
29:35
lincoln um he went to the first party at
29:38
the white house
29:39
and president lincoln offered to pay his
29:40
train fare back to boston and he said
29:43
no i didn't make it so i'll walk back
29:46
another 10 days yeah oh my god isn't
29:48
that fantastic
29:50
that's true do you know who popularized
29:52
or who was
29:53
the first recreational um
29:56
sort of climber rock climber mountain
29:58
climber in britain no
30:00
no i don't it was twiggy i was going to
30:02
say
30:03
that's so weird yeah genuinely was going
30:05
to say twiggy because you get trees or
30:06
mountains
30:07
it's a natural name christopher walken
30:10
oh very nice because he's climbing what
30:12
about
30:13
oh climbing rock hudson yeah that's good
30:15
baroque
30:16
drop you gotta get older though i think
30:18
okay stop being silly boys
30:27
actually there you go we should have
30:30
seen if we kept going we would have gone
30:31
to an event
30:33
you said it's silly okay the first
30:35
recorded recreational mountain climb in
30:37
the uk
30:37
um and he was like yeah he was the first
30:40
recorded person to climb up scarfell
30:42
pike which is the highest mountain in
30:43
england
30:44
and uh yeah and apparently he took an
30:46
extremely dangerous route down and
30:47
nearly died
30:49
he i i know some things about him he
30:53
uh liked eating fruit while it was still
30:55
on the tree
30:56
yeah okay and he wore this huge
31:00
gown which had stars and crescent moons
31:04
all over it it made him look like a
31:05
wizard
31:06
wow are you sure you're thinking of him
31:09
yeah
31:10
i think of dumbledore again
31:13
okay i want to do some faqs from the
31:15
race walking association's website go on
31:18
before we finish okay so the second
31:20
question on there is
31:22
why not simply run
31:25
fair it's a good question isn't it yeah
31:27
i can't think of an answer and their
31:29
answer is
31:29
running is certainly faster but one of
31:32
the interests of the spot is achieving
31:34
good performances within the
31:35
restrictions of the rules
31:38
that's true i mean that's like saying oh
31:39
netball why not just let them go all
31:41
over the court
31:42
because that's a different sport yes
31:44
very good why not let them play football
31:46
yeah why not just pick up the ball this
31:49
should have been the real answer to the
31:51
faq what you guys are saying right now
31:52
yeah
31:53
sure and why don't we just rob
31:54
everything wouldn't that be easier than
31:56
earning money to buy things
31:58
why is there anything rather than
31:59
nothing thanks einstein
32:02
you need rules idiot another question
32:05
yeah
32:05
just one more um do people
32:09
not make fun of you when you're race
32:11
walking
32:12
what's the answer the answer is it can't
32:14
be denied that there are some idiots
32:17
usually overweight people in cars who
32:19
think that rey's walking looks funny
32:21
[Laughter]
32:25
um don't take them on unless you're a
32:28
judo expert or a lawyer
32:30
they're usually driving too fast for you
32:31
to catch them anyway
32:35
don't try chaser but you'll be
32:37
disqualified
32:39
unless you've got cramped then you can
32:41
go yeah
32:43
there's your answer anyway i'm going to
32:44
go take a [ __ ] in the streets because
32:45
why not

00:17
a weekly podcast this week coming to you
00:19
from the soho theater in
00:21
central london my name is dan schreiber
00:23
i'm sitting here with
00:24
the three regular elves it's james
00:26
harkin andy murray and anna chazinski
00:28
and once again we've go around the
00:29
microphone
00:30
with our four favorite facts from the
00:31
last seven days and in no particular
00:33
order
00:33
here we go james
00:36
okay uh my fact this week is that the
00:39
2012 law prohibiting nudity in san
00:42
francisco
00:43
was proposed by a politician called
00:45
scott wiener
00:49
keeping it high brown yeah
00:52
yeah just like i just like funny names
00:54
really
00:55
yeah that's my favorite thing it's also
00:57
it's that nominative determinism thing
00:59
isn't it
00:59
yeah we've actually met the person who
01:01
coined nominative determinism
01:03
really yeah it's mr determinism
01:06
no it's a british guy called john
01:08
hoyland sadly he passed away last year
01:10
um but he used to write for new
01:12
scientists and he coined it and he
01:13
coined it because
01:14
he saw on the same day two things when
01:17
he was out in the shops the first thing
01:18
was he saw a book
01:20
that had come out on the arctic by a mr
01:22
snowman
01:24
and then that very same day he read a
01:25
scientific paper on incontinence
01:27
by j.w splatt and dee
01:31
weedon yeah
01:34
we done on splat it's quite a famous
01:36
paper that is it yeah
01:38
wait mr snowman yeah mr snowman is that
01:41
a name
01:41
does anyone here know anyone called
01:43
snowman i don't think it's
01:45
how can it be a name andy often denies
01:48
the existence of people introduced to
01:49
him if he doesn't agree with their name
01:51
[Laughter]
01:53
so um after finding this guy called uh
01:55
scott weiner i
01:56
try to look for other political names in
01:59
america uh funny ones
02:00
and good old buzzfeed has one it has a
02:03
list of the 31
02:04
weirdest political names and i want to
02:06
give you a few of those
02:07
so the former house representative from
02:09
new hampshire called dick sweat
02:13
uh pre precinct committeeman from
02:15
arizona frank schmuck
02:17
and this is my favorite one it's not
02:19
rude but butch otter
02:21
who was the current governor of idaho
02:24
but shutter is such a good name yeah
02:26
yeah i'd vote for a butch otter
02:29
and there was anthony weiner wasn't
02:30
there who was i mean you know who would
02:33
flash people by text or something a
02:34
couple of years ago
02:35
oh yeah that was right that was
02:37
scandalous it was yeah
02:38
i never thought about how technology has
02:40
sort of made the flashing
02:42
community way more just relaxing stay at
02:45
home
02:47
usually it was really hands-on wasn't it
02:48
you had to go out to the streets
02:51
was a whole different crime what do we
02:54
think of
02:55
so sort of the reverse thing which is
02:56
popular among celebrities now
02:58
naming your child after where they were
03:00
conceived or after something that's um
03:02
significant to them which goes back
03:03
longer than i thought so
03:05
brooklyn beckham brooklyn beckham yeah i
03:07
think um
03:08
and so in 1863 a boy was born and he was
03:12
named
03:13
leicester railway because he was
03:16
he was born at leicester train station
03:21
actually um rudyard kipling is named
03:24
after the place where
03:25
his parents either met or conceived him
03:29
which is in staffordshire i think yeah
03:31
someone recently went through all the
03:32
censuses from
03:33
1790 to 1930 finding all the funny names
03:37
there and there were some really good
03:38
ones
03:38
um some of the best ones so parents mr
03:41
and mrs day
03:42
in 1899 named their son time off
03:47
1899 yeah 1899 time of day yeah i didn't
03:50
think people had that kind of sense of
03:51
humor back then
03:52
i know no did i and yeah so also in the
03:54
19th century they found
03:56
i'm a hog i'm a pig i'm a nut and i'm a
03:59
hooker
04:02
after which i guess the name iron went
04:03
out of fashion eventually
04:07
i'm a snowman um so
04:10
okay so this guy where is he banned
04:12
nudity uh san francisco so was it not
04:14
banned there was that the first time
04:15
they've been banned
04:17
yeah because it's not banned in old
04:19
places it's not banned in the uk for
04:20
instance you're allowed to go around
04:21
naked as long as you don't
04:23
deliberately cause harassment or alarm
04:25
or distress
04:26
yeah i found out that so you can go to
04:29
um you know like youth camps in america
04:30
summer camps there's now a youth summer
04:32
camp that's a nudist camp um because it
04:33
was thought that i guess young teenagers
04:35
didn't have enough opportunity to
04:36
engage in nudism or whatever but there's
04:38
a rule at this summer camp so i think
04:39
there are three or four of them in like
04:41
florida texas arizona
04:42
there's a rule that on the occasions
04:44
that you do wear clothing so
04:45
occasionally there'll be scenarios where
04:47
you put on some clothes
04:48
it's not allowed to be sexually alluring
04:50
[Laughter]
04:54
one of the first other guys to be
04:56
arrested for
04:57
fine for indecent exposure was this was
05:00
in 1927
05:01
and can anyone guess the part of himself
05:03
he revealed
05:05
okay um his bottom no it was his chest
05:08
all right sunbathing just took his shirt
05:10
off and that was it
05:11
he was he was fined and arrested yeah
05:13
the magistrate said
05:15
i'm going to hold rightly or wrongly
05:16
that to expose the upper part of your
05:18
body is indecent
05:19
i think it is highly likely to shock
05:21
persons of ordinary sensibility
05:25
i in summer in london i'm actually in
05:27
agreement
05:29
there was speaking of topless there's a
05:31
really weird story in 1842
05:34
where there was uproar because um so
05:36
this was reported in a
05:38
northern newspaper and it was that women
05:40
who worked our minds were being
05:41
photographed topless
05:43
and it was all over the newspapers and
05:45
it turned out that women were working
05:46
top of standards because it was really
05:47
really hot
05:48
um and i think it turned out i was only
05:50
in one mine it was a hopwood mine in
05:52
barnsley
05:53
but um and there was suddenly this big
05:55
campaign saying women shouldn't be
05:56
working down nines because it was seen
05:58
as indecent
05:59
that they were apparently being forced
06:00
to be topless
06:03
wow that's weird i was just reading
06:05
today actually in
06:06
mongolia they have a an annual sporting
06:09
event
06:10
called the three manly sports uh
06:13
and one of them's wrestling and one of
06:15
them's throwing something
06:16
and the the wrestling one it's only men
06:19
and the way that they find that out is
06:20
they make sure that they wrestle topless
06:22
so that you could tell the difference if
06:23
there's a woman
06:24
uh wrestling because a very obvious
06:27
other way of finding it
06:29
not like during a wrestling match though
06:31
oh yeah what about that fact about
06:33
princess anne was the only person not to
06:35
be gender tested in
06:37
in 1997 some olympics are about the
06:40
olympics yeah
06:42
she could be a man nobody knows for sure
06:44
we are not saying that princess anne
06:46
is a man we're just saying we can't
06:50
rule it out um i was so i was looking
06:53
into
06:54
nudity which is extremely hard to do
06:58
the distractions available but i i
07:00
started
07:01
looking into striptease because i
07:02
suddenly thought oh i don't know the
07:03
history of strip teasing
07:06
it was research every week
07:09
but i i'm surprised how far it goes back
07:12
i mean it goes back to like i think it
07:13
was the 1700s
07:15
and what's really weird is is that they
07:17
used to strip tease
07:18
in front of they would be in a courts
07:20
and you would be just having a fun night
07:21
and then the striptease would start
07:23
and i always said that striptease was
07:24
accompanied by music i was thinking the
07:26
music back then
07:28
wasn't exactly the same yeah when you
07:31
got your harpsichord out there's not
07:32
really
07:33
a kind of sexy song to go with the
07:36
striptease and then i read that a big
07:38
thing that actually put strip teasing
07:39
around the world is
07:40
more of an art form there was uh um
07:42
gustav flouber
07:44
flubber he saw um an arab custom that he
07:47
saw
07:47
in egypt which was this dance it was the
07:49
dance of the bee
07:51
uh oh is it the one where she takes off
07:53
her clothes because she thinks she's
07:54
gotta be inside her clothes yeah again
07:56
not very sexy
07:59
it's just like it seems like strip
08:00
teasing like slowly introduced
08:02
the idea of sexuality much later in the
08:04
day
08:05
i think stripsies must go back further
08:07
than that though
08:10
if you google
08:14
oh dear um nudity right and
08:17
obviously for this you have to be quite
08:19
careful but um
08:21
the results that came up for me you know
08:22
the auto complete options on google
08:24
um nudity in far cry 4 which is a
08:27
computer game
08:30
nudity crossword clue
08:33
third one is nudity in dragon age
08:35
inquisition another computer game
08:37
um but then i realized these are
08:39
tailored to me
08:45
i don't own either of those games
08:50
until now you ordered them presumably i
08:53
wanted to um
08:54
i wanted to see if there was any
08:55
political parties who were up for
08:57
nudity and and so i googled the national
08:59
nudity party
09:00
oh yeah uh and i found only one hit it
09:02
was a facebook page
09:04
uh and it had one like the national
09:06
peace party and it was a guy called
09:08
nenad filopovich from serbia oh yeah
09:11
he's the only member of the facebook
09:13
national nudity party it's not much of a
09:15
party isn't it i mean
09:17
i've held some pretty dead parties in my
09:18
time but that's bad
09:20
the first ever knew this the first ever
09:22
organized nudes movement was set up by
09:24
just three
09:24
people they were englishmen living in
09:26
bombay in 1890 and they just like the
09:28
dress codes of the british raj
09:30
which are very you know you had where so
09:31
much and uh it was very hot
09:33
and so they established a group called
09:35
the fellowship of the naked trust
09:37
and they began to meet together in the
09:38
nude and they were the only three
09:40
members
09:41
and it lasted for just two years and
09:44
then they stopped
09:45
and i just i want to know what happened
09:47
at least
09:49
i presume nothing much happened at these
09:50
meetings just three months something
09:52
happened for it to stop didn't it
09:54
someone someone stepped over a boundary
09:57
[Laughter]
09:59
i was i was looking into the history of
10:00
clothing because i thought
10:02
apparently for the majority of our time
10:05
on earth we have been naked
10:06
string apparently is what changed
10:08
everything the invention of string
10:09
because it meant you could harness
10:11
all you know that could be harnessed so
10:13
string was really hard to make so they
10:15
ended up
10:15
starting they used hemp hemp was the big
10:17
thing that would you know you could put
10:18
into small strips you could wear it
10:20
in larger patches and the thing about
10:23
hemp was it was going really well
10:24
and everyone was using it and then
10:26
suddenly they discovered that you could
10:28
smoke hemp
10:28
and get really high and then they all
10:31
got naked again yeah exactly
10:33
stoned off their asses yeah so
10:36
hemp turned into a high as a result of
10:38
clothing the other thing is that
10:39
in the early american times they used
10:41
the hemp for their ships as well and
10:43
they needed the hemp and no one really
10:45
wanted to grow it there i wanted to grow
10:46
food because you got more money
10:47
um but so one of the first in fact it
10:49
was the first ever
10:51
drug law in america was to make it that
10:53
you had to grow hemp
10:55
yeah that's right
10:58
i just i just read in my notes i've
11:00
actually misspelled this
11:02
when i was writing about nudity and a
11:04
surge in nude crises
11:06
and i actually meant to write cruises
11:07
which there have been a surge
11:10
which is not a crisis um but there have
11:12
been a certain news cruises and also the
11:14
first new chartered flight
11:16
by a german air com uh german tourist
11:18
company
11:20
you know in germany apparent so i
11:21
haven't been to beaches in germany so
11:23
this is just what i've read but most
11:24
beaches are named
11:26
you'll have signs on the beaches fkk is
11:28
one sign and that points to
11:30
fry corpora coffer which is uh free body
11:32
culture
11:33
and that's the naked part and then you
11:34
have the one that's called the textile
11:36
beach
11:37
which really does sound like the losers
11:39
beat
11:41
the knitting beach do you know about
11:44
german agricultural nudist traditions
11:46
[Laughter]
11:50
they're good try me okay
11:53
so lots of different bits of germany
11:54
have um nudity related customs to
11:56
encourage the crops and the harvest
11:58
so for example um in salfeld a women
12:02
would
12:02
walk around the flax fields naked on a
12:05
particular night of the year
12:06
and in the eight this went until the
12:08
19th century where women in redlin would
12:10
walk naked and urinate in the flax
12:12
fields
12:12
urging the crops to grow as high as
12:14
their breasts
12:16
and men did the same thing as well men
12:17
would walk around the sorbs
12:19
they would walk naked in the fields
12:20
chanting flax flax
12:22
grow as high as the scrotum
12:24
[Laughter]
12:26
so the men's crops weren't growing as
12:27
height
12:32
all right let's we've got to move on to
12:34
our second fact um
12:35
so time for fact number two fact number
12:37
two is my fact
12:39
my fact this week is that charles
12:41
darwin's grandfather
12:42
erasmus darwin got so large that he
12:45
couldn't fit at his dinner table anymore
12:47
rather than going on an exercise regime
12:49
he decided to cut a semi circle in
12:52
the table so he could fit his stomach in
12:55
and continue eating it's just wonderful
12:58
decision making that's an example of why
13:02
he was such a genius though right
13:03
absolutely yeah so he i mean this is the
13:05
thing i've never heard of erasmus darwin
13:07
uh because obviously his grandson
13:09
charles really is dominating
13:11
the column inches yeah but he was
13:13
extraordinary yeah yeah
13:15
someone was awesome he was a serious
13:17
polymath wasn't he
13:18
he's like the epitome of polymath and he
13:21
came up with loads of inventions really
13:22
cool inventions
13:24
some of which actually did work so the
13:25
steam car very early person to
13:27
experiment with steam and create a steam
13:29
operated
13:30
vehicle a wire drawn ferry a horizontal
13:32
windmill
13:33
don't know what that's useful for but
13:34
whatever
13:38
hey i know how windmills work and
13:40
there's more
13:41
all right go on i will
13:44
um an artificial bird and a magnetically
13:47
operated fake spider
13:49
also really cool like like an early joke
13:51
toy oh that's good
13:53
yeah he also invented um he came up with
13:55
an idea of using hydrogen balloons
13:57
to increase the amount that could be
13:59
carried in wheelbarrows
14:02
wow that's a good idea yeah yeah yeah he
14:05
sounds really clever but then i also
14:06
read that he once
14:07
tried to cure a five-year-old boy's
14:09
problem with squinting
14:11
by fixing a ginormous fake nose
14:14
to his face and that was his solution he
14:16
was like this would definitely work just
14:18
walk around
14:19
this will be fine do we know if it
14:20
worked um well no one noticed he's
14:22
squinting anymore
14:24
the thing about the balloons i just
14:26
remembered actually um benjamin franklin
14:28
he had a
14:29
number of other ideas for hydrogen
14:31
balloons and one of them was
14:32
that he would put his food attach his
14:34
food to a hydrogen balloon
14:36
and then he would let it go miles into
14:37
the air to keep it cool so you wouldn't
14:39
need a refrigerator
14:40
and they would keep the food cool up
14:41
then then when you wanted it you just
14:43
shoot it down the food would come down
14:44
you could eat it and it'd be cold
14:46
that is much more convenient than
14:49
i'm amazed we're not all doing it
14:52
apparently he was really attracted to
14:53
women though despite being so corpulent
14:55
he
14:55
sounds like a really charismatic guy
14:58
women fancied him he was a bit of a bit
15:00
of a
15:00
female i think you have sex with 14
15:02
children yeah
15:03
12 of them legitimate to not yes
15:06
should have invented the condom
15:10
um but um one of the cool things about
15:13
him is he
15:14
kind of inspired mary shelley to write
15:16
frankenstein
15:17
yeah so when they were all mary shelley
15:20
and byron
15:20
and percy shelly they were all staying
15:22
in uh lake geneva
15:24
and they were telling each other ghost
15:25
stories and mary shelley writes in her
15:26
diary she says
15:28
byron and cheney had a load of
15:29
conversations to which i was a devout
15:31
but nearly silent listener i.e they were
15:33
going on about it
15:34
um they talked to the experiments of dr
15:36
darwin who
15:37
supposedly preserved a piece of
15:39
vermicelli in a glass case
15:40
what is vermicelli
15:43
but it means little worm it was a small
15:46
one well
15:46
i think it's pasta because
15:50
and then he brought the pasta to life
15:51
yeah he brought
15:56
[Laughter]
16:06
frankenstein you just have to get him
16:09
lots of hot water over him and then he
16:11
just fell like this
16:13
i think it was a worm but whatever
16:17
and he meant what he kind of came up
16:18
with the theory of evolution for which
16:20
um charles gets all the credit now but
16:22
he came up with lots of early iterations
16:24
of the theory yeah he didn't do natural
16:25
selection did he but he thought that
16:28
that everything came from something
16:29
smaller or something very very like a
16:31
very tiny piece of pasta yeah
16:34
everything grew from there but he didn't
16:36
realize survival of the fittest he
16:38
didn't really help him
16:39
just speaking of charles darwin um i
16:41
read a thing about him which i really
16:43
thought was extraordinary about the
16:44
times so when he went on the beagle trip
16:46
uh he he wasn't the naturalist on the
16:49
beagle trip
16:50
and actually we we went to uh three of
16:52
us i think went to the welcome institute
16:55
that you can go to in london and they
16:57
have this kind of there's this behind
16:58
the scenes area where they have all
16:59
these amazing documents that no one
17:01
sees in the public one of which is the
17:03
diaries of the naturalist from the
17:05
beagle
17:06
and what's amazing about it is the
17:08
naturalist spent more time
17:09
just going who the [ __ ] is this darwin
17:11
guy
17:13
and it's literally a [ __ ] diary the
17:15
whole of him going
17:16
he's tortoises and this theory of them
17:19
like it was
17:20
it was so [ __ ] and they've never
17:21
published it they really need to but
17:22
darwin
17:23
almost didn't make it on to the beagle
17:25
because fitzroy who was the captain
17:27
didn't like the shape of his nose he
17:30
thought he wasn't a
17:30
he believed in uh what's what was the
17:32
theory that was the physiognomy yeah
17:35
um which meant that you could tell
17:36
someone's personality by their physical
17:37
traits and he thought it meant darwin
17:38
was arrogant
17:39
and stubborn it was just a theory in
17:40
those days that you could tell if
17:42
someone you could tell someone's
17:43
personality by the shape of their face
17:44
so you would have
17:45
people who looked a bit like criminals
17:47
or and actually it's dated back
17:48
all the way back to roman times and also
17:51
i mean remain we say their eyes are too
17:52
close together i mean it remains today
17:54
we do make judgments based on people
17:56
characteristics i do never trusted you
18:02
i this is quite funny about everything
18:04
about darwin's family so
18:05
darwin married his cousin which is quite
18:07
quite well known um but i like the fact
18:09
that one of his sons
18:11
called george became an academic and one
18:12
of the only academic papers that we know
18:14
about that existed
18:16
that was published was published in the
18:17
journal of the statistical society
18:19
and it was titled marriages between
18:21
first cousins in england and their
18:23
effects
18:26
so he was both the author and the
18:28
subject of that
18:30
he wanted parliament to add charles
18:32
darwin this is wanted parliament to add
18:33
a question to the census they did
18:34
saying are you married to your first
18:36
cousin have you noticed anything going
18:38
wrong
18:39
and they wouldn't do it they would they
18:41
wouldn't allow him to add that question
18:42
to the census they said it was too
18:44
personal
18:44
um i read it i read a sentence about
18:46
charles darwin and i know nothing more
18:47
about it because i just thought i don't
18:49
want to go further than this
18:50
the sentence was charles darwin hated
18:52
religious controversy because it
18:54
exacerbated his bowel problems
18:56
[Laughter]
18:58
plays hell with mine well erasmus darwin
19:02
just going back to him he got in a lot
19:04
of trouble because
19:05
he didn't believe in the judo
19:08
christianity god he still believed in
19:10
god but just not the the main one
19:13
and he believed in like some kind of
19:14
distant entity and he
19:16
i think he changed his uh because he
19:18
believed in um evolution he changed his
19:20
family crest to
19:21
everything from shells or something like
19:23
that he put those words on it yeah
19:26
he was wrong he was wrong well
19:29
in the specifics yes but in the general
19:31
trust no
19:34
just going back to his inventions as
19:35
well he invented a circulating swing to
19:38
cure madness
19:39
it's a spinning thing you put a person
19:41
who's got
19:42
mental issues back in the day they have
19:44
on a bedlam
19:45
um you would put them in this machine it
19:47
would spin them around make them feel
19:49
nauseous
19:49
they would vomit lose control of their
19:52
bladder and bowels
19:53
some bled from the nose and ears some
19:55
had convulsions and many passed out
19:58
then he stopped the machine as suddenly
19:59
as he could and this
20:01
invariably had a calming effect subduing
20:03
even the most violent patients
20:06
so what do you still feel angry see
20:10
he's saying nothing
20:13
um your fact was about tables right yes
20:16
yes
20:17
it feels like a long time ago now yeah
20:18
okay so my favorite table i think is
20:21
a table we've all got one we've all got
20:24
one welcome to
20:25
my favorite table it's my
20:28
spin-off show one episode
20:32
it was louis the 16th um and it was in
20:36
his chateau
20:36
at schwazi which i'm guessing is
20:38
somewhere in france and it was his table
20:39
of volunt
20:40
um and it was because he got annoyed at
20:42
the fact that between courses the
20:43
servants would have to come and bring
20:45
you your food so they have to take away
20:46
your plates and like bringing your main
20:47
course up to your starter and he thought
20:49
this is really disruptive
20:50
so what he made happen was he cut a huge
20:52
hole around the dining room table
20:53
and he had it lowered into the servants
20:55
quarters between courses so that the
20:57
servants down below could stock it up
20:59
and then raise it back up to their level
21:00
but apparently it was less disruptive
21:03
was he friends with benjamin franklin by
21:05
any choice
21:08
that's a good table there's a good one
21:09
to start the series i think
21:11
i think it is yeah a few copulent people
21:15
yeah uh daniel lambert he was the
21:18
fattest man
21:19
ever when he was alive weighed 318
21:22
kilograms
21:23
he was the heaviest man in history but
21:25
john brower who died in 1983
21:28
he weighed over 635 kilograms
21:31
um so even though this guy was the
21:33
biggest at the time we've gone twice as
21:35
big now
21:36
um and lambert was so fat apparently
21:38
that he couldn't sink
21:40
um he was now i'm not sure how that
21:43
works
21:44
there's something there and that he was
21:46
from leicester and he would float along
21:48
the river tower
21:49
allowing children to hitch a lift on
21:50
himself
21:55
seriously it was a more innocent time it
21:57
was important
22:01
he was really strong he once fought a
22:03
bear in the streets of leicester
22:05
why was the bear in the streets of
22:06
leicester
22:08
i don't know but you've got to be glad
22:09
that he's there gets
22:12
out of the water get down
22:15
sorry kids gotta find a bear
22:18
um and then he got so famous and he
22:21
exhibited himself in a house in
22:22
piccadilly in london
22:24
and people would go and pay to chat to
22:27
him because apparently he's quite a
22:28
raccoon to her as well
22:29
uh and at the same time as he was
22:31
exhibiting himself in piccadilly
22:33
uh down the road on sackville street
22:35
there was a fat
22:36
baby known as known as master y brantz
22:40
uh mr lambert in miniature and people
22:43
would go to see this fat baby
22:46
well just while they were there it's
22:48
like if they couldn't get a ticket for
22:49
lambert they'd go and see
22:50
there like the french it was a fringe
22:52
event yeah exactly
22:54
yeah surely they did a double act
22:57
yeah they should have done shouldn't
22:58
they do my theory why
23:00
um humans have put on weight in the last
23:02
couple of centuries as well as all the
23:04
dietary change well yeah
23:05
um but another theory is that humans all
23:08
used to weigh less and this is
23:09
you know hundreds and thousands of years
23:10
ago because they were constantly exposed
23:13
to infections
23:14
and infected with stuff and when you're
23:15
infected when you're fighting an
23:17
infection
23:17
your body warms up and you burn calories
23:20
so that's the answer is to just
23:22
constantly be ill
23:24
well people think that though
23:28
obesity might be infectious and i like
23:31
this because it's a good excuse for
23:32
obesity but yeah there's this theory
23:34
they've tried it on mice
23:35
where they've implanted bacteria from
23:37
obese humans
23:39
into a mouse guts and then they took
23:41
another bunch of mice and implanted
23:42
bacteria from
23:43
like normal weight humans into different
23:44
mascots and the mouse guts with the
23:46
bacteria from the fat humans got fat
23:49
and then and the mouse got mice with the
23:51
bacteria from the
23:52
not fat humans didn't get fat and then
23:54
when they put all the mice together
23:56
the thin mice were infected with the fat
23:58
mouse bacteria and
24:00
they all got fat so they think that
24:01
fatness might be infectious caused by
24:03
bacteria in your stomach
24:04
which i don't believe but i would like
24:07
to
24:09
um guys we've got to move on to our next
24:11
fact time is against us
24:13
um okay time for fact number three and
24:16
that
24:16
is andy my fact is that spotify's
24:19
random function is not random
24:23
it used to be random he used to play any
24:26
random song
24:27
but then human listeners kept inferring
24:29
order
24:30
and seeing patterns where there weren't
24:32
any patterns so now they've had to
24:33
change the algorithm
24:34
so it's structured but in such a way
24:36
that human listeners
24:38
think that it's random
24:39
[Laughter]
24:41
can i just ask quickly who are the
24:43
non-human listeners
24:49
that's amazing so we see patterns in the
24:52
algorithm
24:53
everything yeah it's not there yeah and
24:55
so they had to create a fake one
24:57
yeah so it plays so if you've got say
24:59
five different genres of music in a
25:00
normal completely random pattern
25:02
occasionally you get clumps or clusters
25:03
where it will play two or three jazz
25:05
songs in the same in the
25:06
same you know consecutively and they've
25:09
had to change it so it now
25:10
completely mixes up the genres so yeah
25:12
they've had to abandon or doesn't
25:14
completely mix up the genres even
25:15
spreads them out
25:16
at proper intervals yeah exactly yeah
25:19
because people don't believe
25:20
yeah because people just can't kind of
25:23
figure out randomness humans can't
25:24
really can they if you ask everyone in
25:26
this room to stand randomly somewhere in
25:28
the room then they'll all spread out
25:29
pretty much equally
25:30
yeah when actually in real life there'll
25:32
be clumps everywhere yeah yeah
25:34
but don't don't do that guys no
25:38
it's the gambler's fallacy isn't it it's
25:40
the thing that makes gamblers think that
25:42
if there have been
25:43
20 reds in a row on a roulette machine
25:45
that's good the 21st is going to be
25:47
um not a red and it's just not true i
25:50
think the first
25:50
instance of the first time it was
25:52
reported and studied was in 1913
25:54
when a roulette ball fell on black 26
25:57
times in a row
25:57
and all gamblers are going come on it's
25:59
not possible it can't do it again
26:01
yeah i also think that's not possible
26:02
that's amazing isn't it one thing they
26:04
didn't say is that on that roulette
26:05
wheel that'd been a mistake with the
26:07
order the work experience boy painted
26:08
them all black
26:10
eventually so if you get someone to um
26:13
put a random list of 30 coin flips say
26:17
and i um actually flip the coin 30 times
26:20
and you do a random number
26:22
like h t h t whatever you'll be able to
26:24
tell which
26:25
is the man-made one just by looking at
26:27
it and that's because
26:29
yeah because most if you do 30 you're
26:32
likely to get about five in a row which
26:33
are either heads or tails but
26:35
no human would do that yeah it seems
26:37
implausible yeah so there used to be a
26:38
machine you could get called an out
26:40
guessing machine
26:41
and they had those in america i think it
26:43
was in the 50s and you would have to
26:45
choose either left or right
26:46
you would say left and the machine would
26:48
have to guess whether you said left or
26:49
right
26:50
and then you would keep doing that and
26:51
eventually it would guess
26:53
almost every time because humans just go
26:55
into a pattern yeah
26:56
it's like paper scissors on the new york
26:58
times you can play rock paper scissors
26:59
can't you and it's the same thing um
27:01
and it look the game learns as it plays
27:03
against you what your patterns are so
27:04
the more you play it the less likely you
27:06
are to
27:07
win it because it becomes better at
27:08
predicting what you're going to do
27:10
yep i love counter-intuitive um that's
27:12
terrifying
27:13
yeah we've already ended that it's such
27:16
a simple game
27:18
i remember how chickens could beat you
27:19
in knots and crosses yeah
27:21
so everyone not just me
27:26
um so you would be able to get these
27:28
machines they have one at coney island
27:30
in america and they're in other places
27:32
as well and uh basically in knots and
27:34
crosses as long as you
27:36
don't make any mistakes no one can beat
27:38
you it's been sold the game's been
27:39
solved
27:40
and so they just uh taught these
27:42
chickens to peck into the right places
27:43
so if there was a
27:44
knot there they taught it to put across
27:46
in the next place and whatever
27:48
and it became impossible to beat them so
27:50
it became impossible to beat chickens at
27:52
knots and crosses
27:53
it's so annoying i can beat the chicken
27:55
in so much
27:59
name it chess boggle
28:03
can i just quickly mention something
28:05
about spotify because yeah spotify
28:07
is obviously a really amongst musicians
28:09
they hate spotify because the royalty
28:11
system that spotify give are
28:13
is just terrible and and i think it's
28:15
actually changed now i think money is
28:17
getting better
28:18
with royalty payments with spotify um
28:20
but there was this great case i read
28:22
about a band that decided to beat the
28:24
spotify system
28:25
to make money off them they released an
28:27
album this was in march 2014 it was a
28:30
funk band called
28:31
wolfpack and they put up an album called
28:33
sleepify
28:34
and sleepify was a completely silent
28:36
album it was about
28:38
ten tracks first one was called zed
28:40
second was zedze
28:41
said all silent tracks and they
28:43
encouraged people to just stream it on a
28:45
loop
28:46
while they were going to sleep so that
28:48
they would get their numbers accounts
28:49
and they ended up raising 20 000
28:52
uh for their tour and the best bit about
28:54
it was everyone's like did spotify
28:55
actually pay it out to them because
28:57
spotify took the album down
28:58
after a while saying that you're
29:00
cheating the system here so they
29:02
released a statement saying they did in
29:03
fact pay us but the statement they
29:05
released
29:05
was an audio track on spotify
29:09
for people who listened that's great um
29:12
cool
29:12
i i was going to talk about um
29:14
improbable maths and probability does
29:16
that sound fun
29:17
yes from the people who brought you my
29:20
favorite table
29:26
[Applause]
29:28
so that was my favorite physical table
29:30
on my mathematical table
29:38
so why yeah because this fact is kind of
29:41
about things that don't seem like they
29:42
should be right to the human brain but
29:43
they are so the fact that like if there
29:45
are 23 people in a room what's the
29:46
probability that two people have the
29:47
same birthday
29:48
and what is it 50 yeah which is really
29:51
unlikely right you don't think that's
29:52
going to be the case
29:53
and um so the monty hall problem is
29:56
quite a good example of like a really
29:58
like
29:58
counter-intuitive probability so in
30:00
short it's basically
30:02
where probably some of you know it if
30:03
you're given you're given three doors
30:05
and there's stuff behind each door and
30:06
there's a goat behind two of the doors
30:08
and behind the third door there's a car
30:09
imagine that you want the car not to go
30:11
which i've always thought was a serious
30:12
problem with the monitor
30:14
how do you do i've got the car
30:18
one and three then i blew it
30:22
so the monty your problem presumes that
30:25
you want the car
30:26
and it's that you pick a door i might
30:29
try this sometime
30:30
so you've got three doors you've picked
30:31
a door um you haven't opened it
30:33
and then i opened one of the doors that
30:35
you didn't pick and there's a goat
30:36
behind it
30:37
and i said there's a go behind this door
30:38
do you want to switch your choice or do
30:40
you want the thing that's behind your
30:41
original choice
30:41
of door okay so the idea is that you
30:43
switch that height exactly you switch
30:45
because there's a two-thirds chance that
30:47
you're gonna
30:47
get that if you switch you'll be right
30:49
with us there's a one third chance that
30:50
you'll be right if you don't switch
30:52
and it feels counterintuitive because it
30:53
really feels like there must be the same
30:54
probability
30:55
that mida will be right as there was at
30:57
the start it feels like it should be 50
30:59
50 right yeah
31:00
um but when this was uh like popularized
31:02
this theory by this woman marilyn savant
31:05
who had i think she
31:06
had the guinness world record for the
31:07
highest iq and bizarrely she had the
31:09
name savant
31:10
in both of her her mom and her dad's
31:13
family line as in
31:14
know it all no yeah isn't that weird
31:18
so she someone wrote into her column
31:20
saying can you tell me which is the
31:22
right door to pick and she
31:23
wrote the answer saying you should
31:24
switch your choice because there's the
31:25
two-thirds chance that you'll be right
31:26
if you switch your choice
31:27
and she got something like 10 000
31:30
letters from a thousand of which are
31:32
from phd students or people with phd
31:34
saying you're wrong you're completely
31:35
wrong you're an idiot how dare you say
31:37
this
31:37
and she was just inundated with letters
31:39
saying and it's quite a basic she should
31:41
have given three addresses
31:46
anyway i think sorry i think my whole
31:47
point was pigeons are better than we are
31:49
at solving that problem
31:50
so they tried the monty hall problem on
31:52
pigeons and they got them to like peck a
31:55
certain door and then each day that it
31:56
was done over a month
31:57
and each day they were told to peck a
31:59
certain door and they would learn
32:00
gradually
32:01
how do we know whether the pigeons
32:02
prefer goats or cars
32:07
um we need to move on to our final fact
32:09
very quickly just on
32:10
seeing patterns where you shouldn't see
32:13
them so things like spotting faces
32:14
uh which is called paradolia where you
32:16
see a face in a cloud or a wall
32:18
um this goes back centuries and just a
32:20
couple of examples of this
32:21
thing paradolia uh in 2012 somebody sold
32:25
for i think eight thousand dollars a
32:27
chicken nugget shaped like george
32:28
washington
32:29
[Laughter]
32:31
and it's a bit like george washington
32:33
but only because it preys on the ability
32:34
to see patterns
32:35
yeah but there's only so much like
32:37
george washington that a chicken nugget
32:38
can get
32:40
it's never going to be a great
32:42
commander-in-chief
32:44
the president's very quiet today
32:48
okay this is oh yeah we do need to move
32:50
on so okay let's uh
32:51
one very last thing yeah in 2013 a us
32:54
department store
32:55
sold out of a kettle after people
32:57
noticed that it looked like hitler
33:00
it had a handle which was a black candle
33:02
and it had a little extra bumpy bit and
33:03
it looked like his hairstyle and it just
33:05
it's uncanny but the company denied
33:07
knowledge of it and they
33:08
wrote a public statement saying if we
33:10
had designed it to look like something
33:12
we would have gone with a snowman or
33:13
something fun
33:14
[Laughter]
33:17
all right time to move on to our final
33:19
fact of the show and that
33:21
is cecinski my fact is that um the
33:24
animal kingdom
33:25
forgot how to have sex for 40 million
33:28
years
33:30
so justify that claim
33:33
the first known creature to have sex was
33:35
microbrachius dicky
33:37
which was a nice bit of nominative
33:38
determinism there and
33:40
that was 385 million years ago it was a
33:42
kind of fish it was the first thing to
33:43
copulate
33:44
internally so before that people were
33:46
just leaving eggs and sperm
33:49
we've had this problem quite a few times
33:51
is my catch-all term for all creatures
33:54
animals undersea prehistoric fish we're
33:57
leaving eggs and sperm around which
33:58
we're just getting fertilized like that
33:59
microbracket sticky did it 385 million
34:02
years ago
34:03
and just didn't really catch on 40
34:05
million years
34:06
animals decided they were going to stick
34:08
with the whole egg sperm leaving them in
34:09
the water thing
34:10
and then 40 million years later they
34:12
weren't like okay let's try this
34:13
right after all yeah but i've got a
34:16
theory so the way dickie did it was it's
34:18
like bony protrusions on his side so
34:20
they had sideways sex like uh
34:22
one one of the um paleontologists who
34:24
discovered it called it like square
34:26
dancing sex
34:27
um and so the bony protrusions of the
34:29
male fish locked into the bony
34:31
um holes in the female fish's side can i
34:34
read
34:34
uh um exactly how they did it if you
34:37
know that one
34:38
please okay um so the male had a large
34:41
l-shaped sexual order nothing wrong with
34:44
that
34:47
which he had to get into position to
34:49
dock with the females genital plates
34:51
which were very rough like cheese
34:53
graters
34:55
they acted like velcro locking the male
34:57
organ into position so he could transfer
34:59
sperm
35:01
very familiar very familiar
35:06
andy when you have sex you should say
35:07
this shag is brought to you by the
35:09
letter
35:09
l
35:10
[Laughter]
35:13
so yeah maybe sideways isn't the way to
35:15
do it um and then they started doing it
35:18
differently and it got more popular
35:24
that's like that's there's a um there's
35:25
one dinosaur called the
35:27
kentrosaurus oh yeah and it's it's very
35:30
it's it's a dinosaur that we know how
35:32
it's made up we know how it looks
35:34
and the only thing we can't work out is
35:36
how it had sex
35:37
they have no idea because every move
35:39
that would be a normal
35:40
dinosaur sex move would end up in
35:42
castration for the dinosaur
35:45
so no matter what position and i imagine
35:46
they sat there with toys going how about
35:47
this one
35:48
he's lost his balls again and we still
35:51
don't know it's a mystery we have no
35:52
idea
35:53
how they had sex and it's weird calling
35:55
it doggy style because that's what they
35:56
were saying
35:57
when they predate dogs yeah i chose that
36:00
we call it dinosaurs yeah dinosaur style
36:04
okay my favorite thing about sexual
36:06
positions sorry about this
36:07
but it is it is funny um the gold swift
36:11
moth
36:12
it has lots of different positions for
36:14
having sex but they all involve staying
36:16
completely still
36:18
so as to avoid being noticed by bats
36:22
again i can't constantly the number of
36:25
times
36:26
a bat has ruined an otherwise lovely
36:27
evening just wait
36:31
their vision is based on movement
36:35
so just on a complete tangent i found
36:36
out a thing about bats the other day
36:37
which is some
36:38
um mexican free-tailed bats there's a
36:41
particular species of them they
36:43
use their sonar to jam other bats sona
36:46
so
36:46
that's going in for to to bite an insect
36:49
or to see some prey
36:50
and another bat from the side will
36:51
deliver this huge blast of sonar which
36:53
completely knocks out the other ones
36:54
systems the insect gets away and this
36:56
second one
36:57
has a bigger chance of getting it wow
36:58
how cool is that anyway sorry
37:00
in 2013 we found the fossil of two bugs
37:03
it's stuck in the it's the oldest
37:05
copulating fossil we've ever found
37:06
um it's 160 million years old now in the
37:08
missionary position so the oldest
37:10
sexual position we have is actually
37:12
missionary there was one really recent
37:13
one
37:13
um it was two turtles that were
37:16
fossilized in the
37:17
in coitus um that's this was 47 million
37:20
years ago when they were
37:22
when they were caught that way and they
37:23
were having sex near a lake
37:25
when they were overcome by volcanic
37:27
gasses
37:28
and they died and then they sunk down
37:30
sunk down and turned into fossils
37:32
and one of the researchers said many
37:34
animals enter a trance-like state
37:36
when mating or laying eggs and it's
37:38
possible these turtles simply did not
37:40
notice
37:41
that they were entering poisonous waters
37:43
before it was too late
37:44
yeah so what a way to go yeah i always
37:46
wondered how that happens how you can
37:47
get fossils of animals that
37:49
are emit biting each other or having sex
37:52
and in the sex one it seems like they
37:53
might just be in a trance and they don't
37:55
notice
37:55
they're just so into it um another thing
37:58
that animals have forgotten how to do
38:00
is stick insects keep forgetting how to
38:02
fly so
38:04
stick insects developed wings hundreds
38:06
of million years ago or 100 million
38:08
years ago and
38:08
four times they've lost their wings
38:10
again and have had to re-evolve their
38:11
wings
38:12
they keep just like not measuring isn't
38:14
that weird
38:15
yeah that's cool uh the closest
38:17
non-human ancestor of
38:19
ours uh was called australopithecus
38:22
sediba and according to the uh skeletons
38:25
that we have what it looks like is about
38:27
two million years ago
38:28
um they evolved how to walk on the
38:31
ground and then evolved back to go back
38:33
into the trees again
38:35
wow yeah wait hold on so they came down
38:38
from the trees they came down
38:39
and they became like a primate that
38:41
walked on the on the ground
38:42
and then they went back into the trees
38:44
and then lived back up in the trees for
38:46
another
38:47
you know hundred thousand years that's
38:48
like like the ground i read a
38:50
douglas adams book called last chance to
38:53
see
38:53
and he talks about the what's the what's
38:56
the kakapo
38:57
in new zealand kakapo basically was a
38:59
bird that flew
39:00
yeah and then new zealand lost all of
39:03
its land predators so it just came down
39:04
to the ground and hung out
39:06
and and it and just like spent time on
39:08
the ground it basically eventually
39:10
lost the ability to fly yeah but it
39:12
didn't know that
39:14
so they there was a big thing where they
39:16
were going extinct because kakapo's kept
39:17
climbing trees just and just going for a
39:19
quick fly and they'd jump off and they
39:22
would just plummet to the ground
39:24
then they didn't know and they didn't
39:26
like say to each other maybe we can't do
39:28
this anymore they just kept doing it
39:30
yeah well they're the ones who i might
39:32
be wrong about this but were they the
39:33
ones who were like quite naive when
39:35
humans came
39:36
and they didn't realize that we were
39:37
just going to kill them like we do with
39:39
all animals
39:40
and so they would just walk along and if
39:42
a human came up to him they wouldn't run
39:44
away
39:44
they'd just sort of stand there and then
39:46
people just bumped them on the head and
39:47
they'd die yeah
39:48
and then they were also quite curious
39:50
birds and so the next one would come
39:51
along going no what happened to jeff and
39:52
he'd walk around
39:53
and then just walk up to jeff and then
39:55
he'd get bunked on the head and then the
39:57
next one would come and they just died
39:58
out and the next one was like no [ __ ]
40:00
that let's fly out of here
40:01
[Laughter]
40:03
another thing about them that douglas
40:05
adams said is that they have a mating
40:07
call
40:07
which um the mail does which is really
40:10
boomy and bassy
40:11
and they're just i just i don't know if
40:13
that's it
40:15
and but so the the thing is is that he
40:17
describes it as like being a subwoofer
40:19
like a like a real
40:20
in the back of a car and the problem
40:22
with that is that
40:24
that sound doesn't appear from a
40:26
location and appears all around you
40:27
that's yeah
40:28
the base kind of just appears everywhere
40:30
so the females going where the hell is
40:31
this guy
40:32
they can never find the male and so they
40:34
not they ended up not having a lot of
40:35
sex because the females
40:39
yeah that's not good evolving that's
40:42
yeah they've evolved very badly
40:43
um speaking of um a long time ago of
40:46
things coming down from the trees oh
40:48
yeah australopithecus
40:49
um there is a theory that we developed
40:51
by federalism to allow men to show off
40:53
their larger
40:54
penises because men okay
40:58
everyone listening to this has a very
40:59
large penis
41:01
everyone oh man
41:05
i've always wondered what that was
41:09
compared with all other primates um
41:11
human penises are large so the the
41:13
erect gorilla penis is three centimeters
41:15
long the chimpanzee is eight centimeters
41:17
so there is a theory that i mean it's
41:20
not a widely subscribed to theory
41:22
that we developed walking upright so men
41:24
could uh show off
41:25
so um just so you know we are we're
41:27
gonna have to wrap up so
41:28
okay any last comments i'll have um
41:32
an odd um animal mating weird thing
41:35
uh so the green spoon worm do you know
41:38
about this guy
41:39
okay when a green spoon woman is born it
41:41
doesn't have sex
41:42
swims around the sea looking for a
41:45
roving tongue of a female so
41:49
it's it's an organism right it might be
41:51
it's not neither male nor female
41:53
and it swims around looking for the
41:55
tongue of a female if it doesn't find it
41:57
he becomes female
41:58
and then has the tongue thing and if he
42:01
does he becomes
42:02
male crawls through the female's mouth
42:04
into her
42:05
ovary and becomes a sperm-producing
42:07
machine
42:10
and he feeds through his skin because
42:12
his mouth is constantly spewing out
42:14
sperm
42:17
i mean i think sperm producing machine
42:19
is a valid description of the male of
42:20
most species right
42:23
i love that when i was like we need to
42:24
wrap up james is like no not yet
42:28
we do need a rapper okay i like so the
42:30
there's a kind of strider bug or jesus
42:32
bug which is one of those ones that uh
42:33
runs along water
42:34
which uh the women don't really like
42:37
females
42:37
females the females the female people
42:41
[Laughter]
42:43
don't really like copulating because
42:45
they are usually fertilized the first
42:46
time they copulate and so they only want
42:47
to do every couple of months whereas the
42:48
men want to do it constantly and it's
42:50
like often attention in the animal
42:51
kingdom is that men want to have sex
42:52
lows to like give you their sperm but
42:54
women once they're fertilized they don't
42:55
want to have sex
42:56
so anyway the men or the male strider
42:59
bugs
43:00
as they're sometimes known have
43:03
developed um
43:04
these like protrusions on their legs
43:06
where they can grab a woman's eyeball
43:09
so he grabs the female's eyeball and
43:11
like clutches and they're specially
43:13
designed now the front
43:14
legs of this strider bug to get around
43:16
the eyeball pull her to you and that's
43:18
like
43:18
i really caught her eye
43:21
not quite as romantic anymore guys
43:25
okay that's it that's all of our facts
43:29

[Applause]
00:16
and welcome to another episode of no
00:18
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:21
this week coming to you from the soho
00:22
theater in central london my name is dan
00:24
schreiber i'm sitting here with andy
00:26
murray
00:27
james harkin and anna chazinski and once
00:29
again we have gathered around the
00:30
microphones with our four favorite facts
00:32
from the last seven days
00:33
and in no particular order here we go
00:36
anna
00:37
my fact this week is that the son of the
00:39
man who invented shredded wheat
00:41
was also an inventor he invented round
00:45
shredded wheat
00:46
[Laughter]
00:51
that was what he did was he an inventor
00:55
he actually he actually called himself
00:57
an inventor it's not even a
00:59
so he wrote a letter to time magazine i
01:01
think in um
01:02
the 1920s about his father and growing
01:05
up onto his father's influence
01:06
saying i grew up under the influence of
01:07
my father's enthusiasm worked in every
01:09
department of his shredded wheat factory
01:11
and i actually became an inventor myself
01:13
made some adventures of my own
01:15
in 1920 i invented muffets and if you
01:17
look at muffets they are shredded wheat
01:19
but round do you think all the time he
01:22
was working in this um
01:23
in this factory he was just tutting
01:25
every time he saw a square or a
01:27
rectangle and he's like oh for god's
01:29
sake got it all wrong
01:30
he had an ideas book which was just
01:32
shapes
01:34
triangle no dodecahedron
01:39
too complicated
01:46
one other thing he invented was
01:47
symmetrical text or a symmetrical font
01:50
do you know about this no this is
01:52
amazing it's a great idea so you have
01:54
all the letters from a to z
01:56
and but you can read them all back to
01:58
front as well so a is easy because that
02:00
always looks that way
02:00
but then b he kind of had a line on both
02:03
sides so you could read it from left to
02:04
right and left and right to left
02:06
and that was his idea he thought it was
02:07
too much of trouble
02:09
to read from left to right and then go
02:10
to the next line and read from left to
02:12
right again
02:13
and he thought you could write that way
02:15
and then just go down and right that way
02:17
and then go down and right that way
02:18
that's awesome i've seen the text
02:23
and it is terrible it's a horrible idea
02:26
but there was actually an old way of
02:27
writing um that monks did
02:29
back in the day back in the middle ages
02:31
it was called bustofadon
02:33
and it meant as oxen turn when plowing
02:36
and the idea
02:37
is you write from left to right and then
02:39
you rotate the page
02:40
and so then you read from left from
02:42
right to left but you've turned it
02:44
upside down and so you're reading it the
02:45
right way again
02:46
and they used to write like that loads
02:47
of there are manuscripts written like
02:49
that why
02:50
sorry to ask silly questions i think
02:53
again it's kind of cutting corners
02:55
because then you don't have to lift your
02:56
pen from the page
02:57
have we said the name of the shreddies
02:59
father and son yet
03:01
no no um the son was called scott h
03:03
perky
03:04
and the father was called henry druschel
03:06
perky yes
03:07
good names yeah and henry
03:11
invented shredded wheats to cure his
03:13
dummy
03:14
either diarrhea or constipation very on
03:17
that but um yeah he had sir he was a
03:19
dyspeptic
03:20
and he decided that there needed to be
03:21
something he could eat that wasn't it
03:23
was a bread replacement shredded queen
03:25
uh at the beginning you were supposed to
03:26
eat it with a poached egg on top or
03:28
with like fruit it was to be spread on
03:30
it was like a break
03:31
the family actually put out cookbooks
03:33
which had different recipes
03:35
for shredded wheat and a lot of them
03:37
were savory not just for breakfast and
03:38
they also had a cereal restaurant
03:40
they had loads of dishes and they
03:42
weren't all just shredded wheat they had
03:44
other things as well
03:45
one of them was shredded meat inside
03:48
shredded wheat
03:52
that is so horrible
03:56
there was shredded wheat ice cream
03:57
wasn't there at his restaurant and the
03:59
restaurant was over
04:00
niagara falls it sounds amazing how this
04:01
roof garden his first shredded wheat
04:02
restaurant
04:03
um shadowy ice cream and a shredded
04:05
wheat drink which sounds terrible
04:07
it's just i mean it's pulverized wheat i
04:09
guess they also
04:10
have roast turkey stuffed with shredded
04:12
wheat yeah yeah
04:14
i'm really into the idea of just
04:17
relative combos where they do the same
04:18
career
04:19
i i feel like we definitely live in an
04:21
age where actors and musicians were
04:22
seeing their children come up and doing
04:24
the same thing but when you get
04:25
inventors
04:26
it's it's so much better um my favorite
04:29
my favorite family of all time i have to
04:31
say in terms of
04:33
what they've done the picard family do
04:35
you know the picard family
04:37
yeah but it kind of it's putting down
04:39
your own family a little bit when you
04:40
say this is my favorite family
04:44
is that what you say over christmas
04:45
dinner it's like you guys are great but
04:47
you know
04:48
but uh sorry mom dad uh yeah no and the
04:51
picard's incredible so
04:52
auguste picard was the first person to
04:55
travel basically to the
04:56
the closest point of space in a in a
04:58
balloon and then his son was jacques
05:00
picard
05:01
who went to the bottom of the ocean to
05:03
the marianas trench well and then his
05:05
son was john luke picard
05:06
and he went boldly into the yeah no his
05:10
son was bertrand picard
05:11
who was the first person to go non-stop
05:14
in a balloon completely around the
05:15
planet
05:16
so in three generations they went up
05:18
down and around
05:19
there's a picard right now at a dinner
05:21
table who's like 18 going what the [ __ ]
05:23
am i going to do
05:25
i like um so i like father-son
05:28
combinations as well do you know what
05:29
einstein's einstein's son was quite high
05:31
achieving
05:32
uh yeah yeah he was uh do you know what
05:34
he was most famous for
05:36
einstein let's be honest
05:41
and in second okay in second place he
05:44
was a leading figure in the field of
05:46
sediment transport
05:50
in these i think that's why most people
05:54
know of him hands
05:55
i have read that they've said he wrote
05:57
the defining paper
05:58
on sediment transformers he did it was a
06:00
defining paper off three
06:02
[Laughter]
06:04
sorry i'm just i'm i'm not leading in
06:06
any field so i'm putting this guy down
06:08
what was it what was it called
06:09
it was called bed load transport as a
06:11
probability problem
06:12
he was very successful um but yeah not
06:15
not as widely known i guess
06:17
and then there was randolph churchill
06:18
who before winston his dad became prime
06:20
minister
06:21
announced to his parents i'm going to be
06:23
prime minister one day
06:24
and then his dad was instead and he was
06:27
rubbish
06:29
tried to join parliament eventually did
06:31
even his own dad wouldn't have him in
06:32
his war cabin i don't think
06:34
would he i know rough it's not it's not
06:37
a father and son but my favorite
06:39
grandfather grandson combo
06:42
it's you and your own grandfather no
06:44
it's pickard and pickard
06:49
no it's uh it's dick van dyke oh yeah
06:52
and his grandson shane van dyke because
06:55
dick van dyke did everything to make his
06:57
fan then he has a whole family who got
06:58
into movies and tv as well and they did
07:00
everything they could to bring them into
07:02
whatever they wanted to do
07:03
silver spoon kind of thing and they said
07:04
to shane van dyke you want to be a
07:06
director you want to be a writer and
07:07
actor
07:08
what would you like to do and he said i
07:10
have a project that i would like to make
07:12
it's called titanic 2.
07:16
has anyone seen titanic too basically
07:19
the story behind titanic too and bear in
07:21
mind that shane van dyke wrote this
07:22
titanic 2 is set 100 years after the
07:25
launch of the original titanic
07:26
they decide that they're going to take
07:28
the exact same course but this
07:30
time no icebergs but like if we see them
07:32
we're going to move that's like they say
07:33
that in the movie right that's good
07:34
thinking
07:35
yeah they're like definitely we're
07:36
steering clear of those i don't think so
07:38
when the titanic launched it wasn't like
07:39
you see an iceberg
07:40
you make a beeline you have to you have
07:43
to face
07:44
icebergs doubt they're more afraid of
07:48
you than you are over there
07:49
90 of iceberg charges are bluffs
07:52
[Laughter]
07:55
so titanic 2 is making its way through
07:57
the ocean
07:58
and they get word from back home that an
08:00
ice shelf in the distance has collapsed
08:03
and it sends a tsunami towards titanic
08:05
too
08:06
but here's the thing they radio titanic
08:08
too and they say good news guys the
08:09
tsunami's not big enough to take you
08:11
down you're fine but what they didn't
08:12
count on
08:13
is the fact that the tsunami was big
08:15
enough to carry on it like
08:16
surfers icebergs which it then slams
08:20
into titanic too
08:22
titanic two then goes down one person
08:24
survives spoiler alert
08:26
yeah best line ever in a movie as well
08:28
the captain who was like this will never
08:29
happen again
08:31
leaves the cabin he turns to his entire
08:32
crew after it's been hit and it's going
08:34
down and goes
08:34
looks like history just repeated itself
08:40
but yeah shane van dyke what a dude
08:42
that's amazing
08:43
um i think we should talk about
08:44
breakfast oh yes so do i
08:46
have you got something well i think you
08:48
have as well yeah i do um so
08:50
there was a study at tel aviv university
08:52
that found that eating chocolate cake
08:54
for breakfast was good for losing weight
08:56
which is good
08:57
um they looked at 193 obese people
09:01
over 32 weeks and they all had different
09:05
diets and some of them had a 600 calorie
09:08
breakfast
09:08
including a chocolate cake and these
09:10
people lost more weight than those who
09:12
didn't have the chocolate cake
09:14
really yeah that's good isn't it and the
09:16
idea is that if you have sweet things at
09:17
breakfast you're less likely to want
09:19
them throughout the rest of the day
09:21
it's not just because there's no
09:22
chocolate cake left
09:27
on sugary breakfast cereal oh yeah so
09:30
the
09:30
the first ever sugared cereal um was
09:33
called it was called ranger joe popped
09:35
wheat honeys
09:36
fine um and the man who designed it
09:38
designed it to actually lower children's
09:40
sugar consumption
09:41
because he said if i make a very
09:43
slightly sugary breakfast cereal
09:45
then um children won't put lots of sugar
09:47
on their own breakfast cereal
09:49
that's not gonna work well no it didn't
09:50
work
09:52
i think the highest ever was sugar
09:53
smacks has anyone ever heard of these
09:55
does anyone ever have one really cool
09:57
they contain sugar and smack
09:59
exactly that was the worst
10:04
that was a test the police are in and i
10:06
have been taking notes
10:08
but it meant you put less smack on
10:09
yourself
10:11
no no it didn't that was the theory and
10:13
it didn't work
10:15
people just ended up having more smack
10:18
um sugar smacks are 56 percent sugar
10:24
so i was looking at cereals anyway
10:25
breakfast stuff and there was one serial
10:27
kicks
10:28
cereal which might exist on america kix
10:30
which in 1947 when atomic bombs and
10:33
atomic energy were quite fashionable
10:35
um it released an atomic it released an
10:38
atomic bomb ring as one of the free
10:41
gifts that came with the cereal packet
10:43
it was atomic bomb ring
10:44
it contained polonium that glows
10:48
your own little atomic bomber when you
10:51
got it yeah wow
10:52
it contained polonium it it made it very
10:55
clear on the packaging i should be clear
10:56
in case
10:57
um they sue me that it was perfectly
10:59
safe capital letters on the packaging
11:04
i think you've got a problem when you
11:05
have to put perfectly safe in massive
11:07
letters
11:08
i will check this out there was there
11:10
was a chocolate that you could get in
11:11
germany in the 1930s and this is what it
11:13
was called
11:14
radium chocolate that quickly went off
11:17
the market
11:19
highly radioactive chocolate which came
11:21
with the slogan
11:22
eat this and feel great
11:26
um you know uh uh great the the
11:30
tiger the frosties thing this is really
11:31
cool the man who voiced tony the tiger
11:33
for 50 years he wasn't the first one but
11:35
he was
11:35
by a long way the longest to do it it's
11:37
called thurl ravenscroft
11:39
he flew winston churchill as a pilot
11:42
really because he was a civilian pilot
11:45
uh navigator during the whole second
11:46
world war and he uh
11:47
he flew winston churchill bob hope he
11:49
flew to meet the troops and uh he was
11:51
great and he was the one who said great
11:52
yeah
11:53
and when you when you look it up this is
11:55
genuinely on the wikipedia on frosty's
11:57
um
11:58
totally that promise tony the tiger has
12:01
been the mascot of frosted flakes since
12:03
its introduction
12:04
tony is known for uttering the serial
12:05
slogan they're great
12:08
brackets pronounced as one elongated
12:10
word not
12:11
a stutter
12:18
i saw a wikipedia page on snap crackle
12:20
and pop you know these guys
12:22
um from there what are they from rice
12:24
krispies that's it
12:26
and they explained what they do they
12:27
said snap is always portrayed with a
12:29
baker's hat
12:30
pop with a military cap and uniform of a
12:33
marching band leader
12:35
okay crackles red or striped stocking
12:37
cap
12:38
leaves his occupation ambiguous
12:41
[Laughter]
12:45
we've said before i think that kellogg
12:47
john harvey kellogg invented cornflakes
12:49
as
12:50
part of a health drive which and a big
12:52
bit of that was an anti-masturbation
12:54
drive because he believed that
12:55
he actually spent his wedding night
12:56
right writing an anti-masturbation tract
12:59
amazing sure if he doesn't need it
13:01
anymore
13:03
the most not on that wedding he wrote of
13:07
[ __ ]
13:08
chronic or otherwise he said it killed
13:10
you he said such a victim dies
13:11
literally by his own hand
13:18
and guys we need to move on to our next
13:19
fact by the way should we do that you
13:20
got anything else you want to add
13:22
okay uh okay time for fact number two
13:25
and that
13:26
is andrew hunter murray my fact is that
13:29
in the 1960s a canadian psychologist
13:31
visited cafes across the world counting
13:33
how much couples touched each other
13:36
in puerto rico it was 180 times in an
13:39
hour
13:40
in paris it was 110 in london
13:43
it was zero
13:49
i haven't i've worked out whether it was
13:51
romantic couples i think it was just
13:52
people who were in pairs and cafes so it
13:54
could be
13:54
friends or family or anything you know
13:58
yeah but also i'm not british is that
14:01
seen as a very
14:02
this time i see a lot of touching well
14:04
this is the 1960s so things were things
14:06
were different
14:07
yeah they messed up tight in the 1960s
14:12
the brutish 60s as they were called
14:19
i like do you guys know about uh
14:21
knutsford in cheshire
14:22
with the campaign that it ran at the end
14:24
of last year i think to widen its
14:25
pavements
14:26
because um so it's it's finally been
14:30
agreed that knutsfield and cheshire is
14:31
going to widen its pavements so that two
14:32
people can walk along it and the reason
14:34
two people can't walk along is because
14:35
there was this spinster
14:36
called lady james stanley um who in the
14:39
19th century she lived in knutsford
14:41
and she dictated that couples shouldn't
14:43
be allowed to walk along the pavements
14:45
hand in hand
14:45
and so she funded the building of all
14:47
the pavements in knutsford and made sure
14:49
that only one person at a time
14:55
her epitaph reads a maid i lived in a
14:58
maid i died i never was asked and never
15:00
denied
15:01
oh she sounds horrible
15:05
why do you think she was never asked why
15:07
why did she not like people walking side
15:09
by side was it because she couldn't get
15:10
around them or she just didn't like the
15:12
effects she was offended by the idea she
15:13
just like
15:14
things she liked she liked the conga she
15:16
got a kick
15:18
she got a kick on a single file um no
15:20
she didn't she objected because she was
15:21
a single file
15:24
sorry um so yeah touching social
15:27
touching and all kinds of touching
15:28
touching is amazing
15:29
i should say this fact comes from a book
15:31
called touch the science of
15:32
hand heart and mind by david j linden
15:35
and um
15:36
i think it's a very interesting book
15:37
there are so many cool things so
15:39
there are some people who don't feel
15:40
pain oh so
15:42
there are people in a place called
15:44
norbotten probably pronouncing that
15:46
wrong which is in sweden
15:47
and um it's genetic the the reason that
15:49
some people don't feel pain so
15:51
um some people are born without that
15:52
ability and one of those
15:54
people studied in this book is a girl
15:56
called camilla at the age of nine
15:58
i'm quoting here she would entertain her
16:00
friends by jumping off her bed and
16:02
landing directly on her knees
16:05
she said she'd like to hear the
16:06
crunching sound they made
16:08
just like popcorn
16:11
well i think the problem with people who
16:13
have this genetic problem
16:14
uh is that they can they would die early
16:17
wouldn't they
16:17
yes because you don't know you don't
16:18
yeah you put your hand in the fire and
16:20
you just wouldn't know that it's yeah
16:22
um so basically touch is vital and um
16:24
for babies as well if they don't uh
16:26
experience a parent touching them then
16:29
it's extremely bad for them and you can
16:30
get all kinds of
16:31
conditions that way not sort of we're
16:34
not sure how but um
16:36
um adolf hitler
16:40
didn't like touching that as well
16:43
[Laughter]
16:45
do you like anything
16:46
[Laughter]
16:58
this is martin amos has claimed recently
17:00
that adolf hitler and eva braun
17:02
had sex without touching each other or
17:05
removing their clothes
17:06
how does that even work well i assume
17:09
you like the necessary parts touch but
17:11
it kept it to an absolute minimum
17:13
he hated going to the tailor because
17:15
taylor's you know they have to touch you
17:17
and um a badge of being adolf hitler's
17:19
taylor oh my god
17:21
i did like this this is i read about
17:22
this in the international business times
17:24
and the way it reported it was it was
17:26
saying about the recent claims that have
17:28
come out that he had sex without
17:29
touching eva braun
17:30
um i said while hitler's already
17:32
tarnished reputation
17:37
was further questioned wow
17:40
so if you touch someone uh they're going
17:42
to trust you mark apparently
17:43
that's a thing isn't it don't do it yeah
17:47
richard wiseman did a study on this and
17:49
found that um
17:50
when you asked someone on a date and you
17:52
were touching them at the same time
17:54
they were 20 more likely to offer a
17:57
dance in a nightclub
17:58
20 more likely to accept that and 10
18:01
increase on people giving their
18:03
telephone number to a stranger in the
18:05
street
18:06
just from touching them does it make any
18:07
difference where you touch them
18:12
i think further research is required
18:17
apparently i just struggle to believe
18:18
this because i cannot empathize with it
18:20
but as a salesperson if you touch people
18:22
you're about twenty percent more likely
18:23
to make a sale if you touch somebody on
18:24
which i find incredibly creepy yeah just
18:26
a light touch on the arm but
18:27
it's culturally specific so they've
18:29
tried these experiments and
18:30
getting people to sign a petition in the
18:32
street it goes from 55
18:33
to 80 of people signing it however
18:37
not in poland where you're like a polish
18:39
man
18:40
anna because polish men react very very
18:43
badly to being touched lightly on the
18:44
arm
18:45
a study in poland found this they found
18:47
that people are less likely to sign the
18:49
petition because like
18:50
i'm a quarter polish and i've never been
18:51
able to access the polish part of myself
18:53
and maybe that's what it is
18:54
it's
18:55
[Laughter]
19:01
um there seems to be a lot of
19:02
controversy in the papers that i've
19:04
when i was putting in um i was i just
19:06
wanted to see with britain and
19:07
touching certain people in britain and
19:09
apparently the queen is someone you
19:11
definitely should not touch
19:12
you've got the queen haven't you done i
19:14
i've touched the queen yes i met the
19:16
queen
19:17
no i did i'm not meant to
19:20
it sounds like you knew and you did it
19:22
anyway
19:25
back to her face as i touched her
19:27
[Laughter]
19:29
where did you touch her her hand we
19:30
shook hands oh yeah but yeah they um
19:32
because i'm i'm
19:33
an australian and labor pm paul keating
19:36
um he was uh not current yeah yeah he um
19:40
he touched the queen on her lower back
19:42
which a number of people have done
19:43
and it's always led to massive
19:45
controversy and the tabloids went insane
19:48
and they called him the lizard of oz the
19:50
tabloids then recommended that all
19:52
australian expats be sent back to
19:55
australia clive james included
19:57
um because they they ruined their chance
20:01
it is a peculiarly sleazy feeling
20:03
someone touching your lower back i mean
20:05
i can understand
20:06
trying to extradite every member of the
20:07
nationality
20:10
um other people you're not allowed to
20:12
touch the thai royal family you weren't
20:14
allowed to touch them traditionally
20:16
and there was a thai queen who drowned
20:18
after falling from a boat
20:20
uh this was in 1880 because onlookers
20:22
were too scared to touch her
20:24
and so she drowned no way yeah that's
20:26
bad i mean they probably
20:27
probably didn't like it very much either
20:29
yeah because if even if i was supposed
20:31
to
20:31
you know not touch someone if they were
20:33
drowning i think it'd help yeah
20:35
well if the law says that you'd be put
20:37
to death if you did touch them to death
20:38
yeah oh okay
20:39
yeah in um in tonga
20:42
uh the undertakers who look after the
20:44
king are not supposed to use their hands
20:45
for three months
20:47
after touching the dead body of the king
20:50
but that's better than it used to be
20:51
because 300 years ago they would have
20:53
their hands chopped off
20:54
wow and i bet undertaking courses were
20:56
not popular in the country
20:58
were they um so wait you can't use your
21:00
hands for three months you have to
21:01
explain this uh but these days um you
21:03
would be put into a nice um house and
21:05
looked after for three months so it's
21:07
actually quite good these days
21:09
uh we're gonna have to we're gonna have
21:10
to move on um i've just got one more
21:12
thing which i think is really
21:13
interesting uh
21:14
things you can touch something you can't
21:16
touch is the papers of marie curie
21:19
they're still so radioactive that you
21:22
have to put on a
21:23
full body suit in order to look at the
21:25
papers
21:26
that's that are talking about the
21:27
subject itself that's insane
21:30
i'm on touching in the us there's
21:33
there's been a campaign in
21:34
us schools recently to limit touching
21:37
between people
21:38
but just between pupils because girls
21:39
often hug each other i think so there
21:41
was a complaint by a head teacher saying
21:42
that
21:43
girls having been separated for 40
21:44
minutes gone to different lessons we'll
21:46
have to all hug each other in the
21:47
corridors and it was clogging up the
21:48
corridors
21:49
um so there was a campaign in a school
21:51
in iowa i think it was which was the
21:53
hands-off or handshake campaign which
21:56
apparently was genuinely successful
21:57
which was saying to girls you cannot
21:59
have to hug each other every 40 minutes
22:00
maybe just a handshake
22:01
and now girls in this school go down the
22:03
corridors to their mate give them a
22:04
handshake
22:05
and that's that done wow that's good
22:08
it's very much like 1960s britain
22:12
hello how do you do it oh i shook so
22:14
many people's hands last night
22:20
um we really need to move on okay time
22:23
to move on to fact number three and that
22:24
is james
22:25
okay my fact this week is that in a very
22:28
particular time and place in history
22:30
you could avoid castration by shouting
22:32
the word
22:33
soho but just to be safe always do it
22:39
everywhere is the time and place here
22:42
and now
22:45
we've asked the stars yeah what do you
22:46
mean time and place yeah it's not in
22:48
soho itself which is where we are today
22:49
and this
22:50
is an ashanti law from the 18th and 19th
22:52
century and that said that if someone
22:54
saw a member of the chief's harem naked
22:57
then he'd be castrated
22:58
um and so if one of his attendants
23:00
needed to go into the harim he would
23:02
shout out soho soho and the ladies would
23:05
get dressed and so he wouldn't be
23:06
he wouldn't see them naked and he won't
23:08
get castrated this is a shanti ashanti
23:10
yeah
23:10
which is where they are ghanaian and
23:13
they're part of the
23:14
acan kind of group of tribes so if you
23:17
really had a grudge against a guy and
23:19
you're a woman you just leave your
23:20
clothes off he's seen you naked he gets
23:22
castrated that'll do it
23:24
wow tough yeah
23:27
[Laughter]
23:31
so um the ashanti law was it would
23:33
punish acts that were hateful to the
23:35
tribe
23:35
because they believed that their their
23:37
ancestors would come back and punish the
23:39
whole tribe
23:40
if they did anything that was bad and
23:42
also they
23:43
um they thought that one of the most
23:45
severe punishments that they had was
23:47
ridicule
23:48
and there was a proverb that was if it
23:50
was a choice between disgrace and death
23:52
then take death so ridicule was the
23:54
worst thing that could happen to you
23:56
although castration sounds a bit worse
23:58
um they always shook counts because we
23:59
were talking about handshaking they wish
24:01
i counted the left hand didn't they
24:02
because that was the hand that you had
24:04
held your shield in and so it signifies
24:06
the fact that you don't feel the need to
24:07
defend yourself against them that's true
24:08
and baden powell was a big fan of the
24:10
ashanti and
24:11
that's why uh boy scouts were
24:12
traditionally supposed to shake with
24:14
their left hand because he
24:15
liked the ashanti so much i saw some
24:18
amazing footage
24:18
eight years and years ago of um david
24:21
attenborough when he was making a series
24:23
called zooquest
24:24
um i think it was the zooquest series
24:25
and there was this one episode where
24:27
he was going into a territory so that he
24:29
had a group of people
24:31
guiding him around of a certain tribe
24:33
and they stopped at this hill and they
24:34
said we're not going any further because
24:35
the tribe that are over there are quite
24:37
war-like and we don't
24:38
want to get into this territory and adam
24:41
was like okay you guys stay back me and
24:43
the camera guys are going to go forward
24:44
and they have this on camera
24:45
attenborough is walking over this hill
24:47
when suddenly this warring tribe
24:49
comes running over the hill towards him
24:52
and they just come like
24:53
they're yelling and they're going like
24:55
just the war yells basically running
24:57
towards him
24:58
and he's has no idea what to do he's
25:00
panicked into
25:01
a standstill silence and literally as
25:04
they approach him the only thing he can
25:06
think to do
25:07
is to walk forward put his hand out to
25:09
shake and says
25:10
how do you do yes yeah
25:13
yes and then it turned out that that was
25:15
their way of greeting you by
25:16
intimidating you it's like a great
25:18
practical joke on that and they came and
25:20
you see the guy going oh
25:21
and then shakes adam his hand and it's
25:23
the most british thing i've ever seen in
25:25
my life
25:26
literally on the brink of death how do
25:28
you do it
25:30
extraordinary this is completely
25:32
unrelated to the subject matter but on
25:33
david attenborough you know he's the
25:35
only person who's won a bafta
25:37
in black and white color 3d
25:40
um and hd and some other weird thing
25:44
called
25:44
4x or something that i did there's five
25:46
that's when he's literally massaging it
25:48
[Laughter]
25:50
five formats he's got wow that's very
25:52
cool it's impressive yeah he's old
25:54
so the ascension that's what i'm telling
25:58
you
26:00
honest fact is so the ashanti are famous
26:03
for the golden stool
26:05
yes this was the throne of the ashanti
26:07
people
26:08
it's quite a small stool and it's so
26:11
important to them that it's never
26:12
allowed to touch the ground so it has
26:13
its own chair
26:16
so it's like a stool on top of the
26:17
throne which is pretty cool is that what
26:19
because
26:19
sorry i read that the legend comes from
26:22
the fact that the golden the golden
26:24
stool started in the 17th century
26:26
in um modern-day ghana when it came down
26:29
from the heavens and landed on the
26:30
king's lap which seems like such a
26:32
strange place it's sitting on him
26:34
yeah that's how good it is
26:39
but it caused the war of the golden
26:41
stool didn't it that's right
26:43
a week i think we caused the war of the
26:44
golden stool well some blame the stool
26:46
some blame negotiations broke down
26:50
this was when our it was classic british
26:53
colonialism
26:54
um when the governor of the gold coast
26:56
as it was at the time who was called
26:58
frederick hodgson heard about this
26:59
golden stool thing and demanded to be
27:01
allowed to sit on it
27:02
um because he said you know the queen is
27:05
your ruler where is the golden stall why
27:07
am i not sitting on the golden stall at
27:09
this moment
27:09
i'm the representative of the paramount
27:11
power in this country why have you
27:13
relegated me to a non-golden stool chair
27:15
and so then the quote i read was um the
27:18
chiefs listened in silence and then went
27:20
home to prepare for war
27:22
[Laughter]
27:27
quite right too i think yeah
27:30
the uh the current king of the ashanti
27:32
is a man called atom
27:34
tutu ii and he is qualified in
27:36
accountancy and public administration
27:40
which actually is a really good thing
27:41
for a king to be qualified
27:45
he studied at kilburn polytechnic
27:50
yeah yeah and he has a doctorate from
27:52
london metropolitan
27:53
university which is where he did the
27:54
public administration but
27:57
um i've got some soho facts but like
27:59
soho is in
28:00
where we're recording tonight yeah um
28:03
well i say i've got some i've got one
28:04
it's uh it's gonna be good
28:08
but it's on the very street that we're
28:09
on dean street uh where there's a pizza
28:11
express up the road and before there was
28:13
the pizza express there
28:14
there used to be an ear hospital and it
28:16
was the very first air hospital
28:18
in the uk some think in all of europe uh
28:20
no one had done it before
28:21
it was run by a guy called john curtis
28:23
he was a bit of a charlatan
28:25
um he used to do this thing where he
28:28
would try to convince the patient that
28:29
he'd cured them and made their hearing
28:31
better
28:32
so they'd come and go i'm having trouble
28:33
hearing and then he would go okay we'll
28:36
listen to this clock and he'd have a
28:38
silent clock
28:40
and they'd be like i can't hear anything
28:41
and he was and then he'd get some hot
28:43
water in a syringe and he would put it
28:44
in their ear
28:45
and while they were like doing that to
28:47
their ear he'd get his other clogs which
28:49
made a noise
28:50
he went what about now and they go i can
28:52
hear anyone i killed you
28:54
they'd go off yeah but that only works
28:56
for people who can actually hear
28:58
who don't have hearing problems in the
29:00
first place right yeah yeah
29:01
yeah but apparently this this one ear
29:03
hospital has now expanded into
29:05
what become great ear hospitals so it
29:07
actually turned into a great house yeah
29:09
so deliver
29:09
his dubiousness a little bit south of
29:11
here there's a nose hospital and then
29:13
way further down there's a throat
29:14
hospital in surrey
29:16
so we're on um the soho theatre is 21
29:20
dean street
29:20
and apparently um mozart played in this
29:24
building
29:24
or what this building was uh a
29:26
seven-year-old mozart played the
29:28
harpsichord accompanied by his
29:30
four-year-old sister wait
29:31
a seven-year-old mozart how many of how
29:32
many
29:33
[Laughter]
29:35
really he did that's about apparently
29:36
yeah wow yeah
29:38
according to the website of this very
29:40
company right
29:42
uh apparently um moldbridge cigarettes
29:44
as well they started selling and
29:46
manufacturing cigarettes on great
29:48
mulberry street
29:50
and mulberry no no it was it was the
29:53
name and then they removed the uh
29:55
at the end because they thought that's
29:56
not as sexy a look as a thing
29:59
and on top of it they were lady
30:00
cigarettes they weren't for men
30:02
wow yeah they were it's not for men
30:06
so genuinely when they started up they
30:08
were for women and because it was at a
30:10
point where
30:10
women were encouraged to start smoking
30:12
cigarettes which if you've ever seen an
30:14
adam curtis documentary what was it
30:16
called the power of nightmares
30:17
it's where he shows where one person who
30:19
is a grandson i think of sigmund freud
30:21
convinced the entire world because at
30:23
that point only men smoke cigarettes
30:25
and they called them flame with it was
30:27
it um i don't know
30:28
sticks of liberty flames of awesomeness
30:32
liberty tortures or some liberty torches
30:34
but so marlboro was a and that was just
30:35
down the road
30:36
and he is the man who invented eggs and
30:39
bacon for breakfast
30:41
that's true he was the father of pr yeah
30:43
i'm the father of good health
30:48
yeah and his son invented round
30:50
exhibitions
30:52
so arthur
30:56
um i think a theater
31:00
at the great women's theater in soho was
31:02
the only fit and not to close down
31:04
during world war
31:05
ii to support the war effort wasn't it
31:06
because it was an exotic dancing
31:08
slash uh naked what do you call these
31:10
places where they're naked women
31:15
it was that and it was decided that it
31:17
was too important to sacrifice
31:19
for the cause of war so the greater more
31:21
theater yeah it is no longer a strip
31:23
club if you're going there
31:24
pretty sure i think it's just a theater
31:25
now
31:27
i think it is you think is it still a
31:30
strip club
31:30
i think so look at him i think
31:36
otherwise that was a very avant-garde
31:38
play
31:42
i mean there was no plot whatsoever
31:50
so uh the start of this fact was about
31:52
safe words because it's something i say
31:54
to make sure you don't get castrated
31:55
and i went on which is what a safe word
31:59
is right yeah well to be honest i wasn't
32:00
sure so i went on wikipedia
32:02
safe words and uh they said in theory a
32:05
safe word is usually a word that the
32:06
person would not ordinarily say during
32:09
sex
32:09
such as pineapple velociraptor
32:13
[Laughter]
32:23
and then another one this is really
32:24
great it's the next paragraph it says
32:26
since the scene may become too intense
32:28
for a submissive partner
32:29
to remember what a safe word is in
32:32
practice
32:32
commonly the word safe word is used as a
32:34
safe word
32:37
um i'm gonna have to move us on we've
32:39
gotta press on i
32:42
um okay uh time for our final facts of
32:44
the evening that's my fact
32:46
my fact is that matthew rickard the man
32:48
who is labeled the happiest man in the
32:50
world
32:51
is unhappy people call him that
32:53
[Laughter]
32:56
this was by science they said you were
32:58
the happiest man
32:59
alive he's a buddhist but he's by
33:00
science sorry
33:02
i'm misdesired by captain science he
33:05
uh basically they were doing this
33:07
massive survey on trying to find out
33:08
about happiness
33:09
and um he was one of the people that
33:11
they did these experiments on they did
33:13
it on hundreds of people
33:14
and he literally they could register no
33:16
negativity
33:18
in him whatsoever he just loved
33:20
everything until they said you're the
33:22
happiest man in the world he's like
33:23
[ __ ] sake well it's me yeah apparently
33:26
according i mean i've not read it in a
33:28
proper interview with him that he is
33:30
unhappy about it
33:31
except for this book called talk like
33:33
ted it's a new book that's out
33:34
and in it she says that he's really
33:36
unhappy about it um
33:38
yeah well they did okay they did this
33:40
test which and they tested the happiness
33:42
biometric thing uh so
33:43
plus 0.3 was the most miserable on this
33:46
scale they had
33:47
minus 0.3 was meant to be extremely
33:49
happy people
33:50
and he scored minus 0.45
33:54
which isn't that cool he's off the
33:56
charts yeah
33:57
he said he sounds like the most annoying
33:58
person on the planet um
34:02
that is anna plus notepad
34:09
he said when he was asked if he ever
34:11
gets annoyed he said
34:13
of course i sometimes get irritated but
34:15
i usually start laughing quite quickly
34:17
at the irritation because it's so silly
34:19
which sounds like an incredibly annoying
34:20
response
34:22
he's surrounded by the unhappiest people
34:24
in the world
34:25
i also saw an interview with him um when
34:28
someone asked him about a laptop that he
34:30
had stolen
34:31
and they said did that not make you
34:32
unhappy at least he said i didn't feel
34:34
aggrieved at all my only regret was that
34:36
he hadn't been able to send the
34:38
thief the power lead [ __ ]
34:41
no one can be that happy it's impossible
34:45
but he's like a buddhist guy right he's
34:47
like he's he says meditation is the main
34:49
thing he's the
34:50
dalai lama's right-hand man oh yeah
34:52
really yeah i saw an interview where
34:53
they talked about the dalai lama and
34:55
someone asked him
34:56
does he watch the marx brothers this
34:58
does the dalai lama
34:59
watch the marx brothers and this guy
35:01
riccar said he doesn't have to
35:03
his life is so full of humor although i
35:06
think he used to watch bash
35:10
best tv show ever yeah well obviously
35:12
the dalai lama doesn't think it's that
35:14
funny
35:16
so as we say buddhism is a thing that
35:17
really focuses on a thing
35:19
a religion that really focuses on trying
35:20
to achieve happiness and in bhutan
35:22
obviously a buddhist country all new
35:25
government policies have to have a gross
35:27
national happiness assessment
35:29
so every policy that's made has to be
35:31
run through the is this gonna cause

35:41
the global happiness index
35:43
they're number eight i think they're

37:15
they put the traffic lights there and
37:16
everyone got so upset by the traffic
37:18
lights they got rid of them and now
37:19
there's just a guy there the whole time
37:21
who's doing the job of the traffic
37:22
lights because they thought it was too
37:23
impersonal yeah
37:24
because they're so happy clappy they
37:26
need like a human
37:27
to be doing their traffic lighting for
37:29
them i've done karaoke in bhutan as well
37:31
actually with a lot of monks
37:33
no wow that's another story
37:35
[Laughter]
37:37
no you don't get off the hook that
37:39
easily here
37:40
what did you sing i can't remember it
37:42
was some like i think i sang some
37:44
bhutanese because i'm happy
37:48
yeah that's all they sing pharrell
37:49
williams
37:52
keep the points up it's going down
37:56
costa rica's ahead come on
38:04
um supposedly in buddhist teaching there
38:06
are 84 000 negative emotions
38:10
really yeah and there are also there are
38:11
87 000
38:13
drinks combinations at starbucks
38:15
[Laughter]
38:17
coincidence can't be
38:22
perfect that's like there was how many
38:24
different types of smile are there
38:26
something like 18 different types of
38:27
smile on there and there's only one of
38:29
those 18
38:30
that makes that is a genuine smile of
38:33
happiness
38:34
smile right yeah the mouth smile
38:38
i'm out there's a pan american smile
38:41
yeah
38:41
yeah and that was um air hostesses from
38:44
back in the 50s
38:46
just fake fake mouth only yeah but it
38:49
became it was such a big thing wasn't it
38:50
it was the classic
38:51
you on the side of planes they would
38:53
have um the classic air hostess of the
38:55
50s look and it was the fake smile
38:58
yeah i don't know if that's one of the
38:59
19 or 18. they almost certainly i think
39:01
it is and the best one is the duchenne
39:03
smile and that's one you can tell by the
39:04
eyes because it's the wrinkles around
39:06
the eyes let you know that it's a real
39:07
smile
39:08
and that's probably why so there are a
39:10
lot there's lots of data about how the
39:11
older you get the happier you get
39:12
and it's just because people have got
39:14
wrinkled eyes when they're older
39:16
because it is the happiness index goes
39:18
up and like right into your 80s
39:20
but it goes down until your mid-40s yes
39:22
it does that's the least happy
39:24
and then but from then on it's all
39:26
upwards which means the graph looks a
39:28
bit like a smile
39:30
[Laughter]
39:35
all right mateo rico
39:38
oh by the way matteo ricard has on his
39:40
website look did you guys look on his
39:41
website
39:42
his website has a few features my
39:45
favorite feature is
39:46
smile of the week and it's just a
39:49
different monk
39:50
every week just having a good old smile
39:54
it's actually really nice to look at if
39:56
he's unhappy about the happy thing he's
39:57
bringing on himself if he's doing a
39:59
smile of the week website i think
40:01
yeah he's been celibate since he was 30.
40:05
[Laughter]
40:08
he has a little counter on his website
40:10
[Laughter]
40:15
um duchenne used to as well as
40:17
discovering the one smile that is a true
40:19
smile used to electrocute different bits
40:20
of people's faces to create different
40:22
expressions didn't he to work out what
40:23
different expressions meant
40:24
and it's so funny and because it was in
40:26
it was the mid to late 19th century
40:28
because it was the age of photography as
40:29
well he combined the two and he just
40:31
took loads of photos of these patients
40:33
making mental expressions because he was
40:35
electrocuting them these people getting
40:37
like
40:39
yeah it's kind of mean yeah um i just
40:42
got i got a
40:43
flash uh we're gonna have to wrap up
40:45
what that meant yeah that's what that
40:46
was
40:47
um do we have any final facts do you
40:49
want to check in
40:50
um okay well hitachi has come up with a
40:53
happiness algorithm
40:54
um you put a badge on your on your shirt
40:57
and
40:58
there's an accelerometer on there which
40:59
measures your activity
41:01
and it means that the boss of a company
41:03
can tell how happy everyone is in the
41:05
company
41:06
and can adjust things accordingly
41:10
oh brave new world yeah um i got one
41:13
last thing which is that i
41:14
uh i was looking into just when i was
41:16
doing the research i thought
41:18
science has labeled this person the
41:20
something in the world oh yes and i only
41:22
had one thing come up which is the man
41:23
with the
41:24
largest penis and oh yeah i know him i
41:27
don't know him
41:31
it was just one night
41:34
james your eyes are watering
41:38
no he works as a data entry clerk in
41:41
america doesn't he
41:42
i think yeah yeah what's he using to
41:44
enter the data
41:50
all right we don't even have time for
41:51
the fact that's it that's all of our
41:53
facts
41:54

=52
00:00
hi everyone james here i just wanted to
00:03
start with an apology
00:04
unfortunately the audio is very bad in
00:06
this episode
00:07
um some of our microphones failed so we
00:09
only had one mic
00:10
and you'll be hearing it from that so
00:12
it's going to be a bit tinny a little
00:14
bit like we recorded in a toilet
00:15
but that's kind of back to our roots
00:17
because that's what most of our early
00:18
ones were like
00:19
but enjoy the show anyway we think it's
00:21
a good one
00:23
get through the audio next week will be
00:24
much better
00:36
[Applause]
00:47
another episode of no such thing as
00:49
official weekly podcast this week coming
00:52
to you from the soho theater in central
00:54
london my name is dan schreiber
00:55
i'm sitting here with anna chazinski
00:57
james harkin and andy murray
00:59
this is our one year special it's our
01:01
birthday we've once again
01:03
sat around the microphones with our four
01:05
favorite facts from the last seven days
01:06
and in no particular order here we go
01:09
starting with you
01:10
andrew hunter murray hello my fact is
01:13
that the route for the hong kong ultra
01:15
marathon
01:16
is to run up and down the same stretch
01:17
of road 25 times
01:24
um this has been in the news a bit
01:26
recently it's uh because it's just
01:28
happened
01:28
the first ever marathon they've had on
01:30
this route for one of a better word
01:32
um and it's 31 miles long because
01:34
apparently anything longer than the
01:36
standard
01:36
26.2 is an ultra marathon which i think
01:40
is cheating because i think it should be
01:41
at least
01:41
double and i say that as someone who's
01:44
never run more than 200 meters
01:46
and i was at sports day i came forth
01:50
out of four so
01:54
yeah that's it um so how far do you say
01:56
it was
01:57
31 miles oh yeah because normally ultra
01:59
marathons are more like 100 miles uh 100
02:01
miles 200 miles whatever but if they had
02:03
done that here they probably would have
02:04
been suicidal
02:07
actually sorry i read that if you run
02:09
200 miles it's less tiring than if you
02:11
run one hundred miles
02:13
right have you talked he's actually
02:16
tried it
02:16
that can't be true yeah apparently what
02:18
happens is um
02:20
when you know it's going to be much
02:21
longer your intensity is much lower and
02:23
so you take
02:24
take your time a lot more and they found
02:25
that people who do the longer ones feel
02:27
better at the end so you're just saying
02:28
you do it much more slowly
02:30
you're saying it takes you conserve your
02:31
energy better
02:33
you walk it
02:40
so the thing about this marathon is that
02:41
everyone's been describing that
02:42
particularly people doing it as the most
02:44
boring marathon
02:46
possible because of the repetitions and
02:48
i was looking into boring marathons
02:50
and there is an annual boring marathon
02:52
what yeah there's an annual boring
02:53
marathon there's an
02:54
ultra boring marathon and it's actually
02:58
apparently quite exciting it's just it
02:59
happens to take place in a
03:01
town boring oregon city
03:05
yeah which is an actual place and their
03:07
motto is the most exciting place to live
03:11
they're twins with a town called dol in
03:12
scotland yeah
03:14
yeah yeah they have an annual dull and
03:16
boring day uh which is i think it was
03:18
august 9th
03:19
someone worked out recently the most
03:21
boring day in modern history
03:23
um and it was april the 11th 1954 oh
03:26
yeah
03:26
so a bad time it was a scientist
03:29
developed a computer program to work out
03:31
the day where the least
03:32
interesting stuff happened it included a
03:33
general election in belgium
03:35
so sorry sorry belgians the the
03:38
front page of the new york post was two
03:40
cops attending a conference on juvenile
03:42
delinquency
03:44
from page news so they put that into a
03:47
machine right and it's
03:48
general so it was like three million
03:50
bits of information 300 million
03:52
three was it 300 million it was wow so
03:55
they said fine was the most boring day
03:56
they came up with this date april 11
03:58
1954.
04:00
uh i i read this as well side note to it
04:02
which actually caught my eye more than
04:04
the fact itself
04:05
is that the guy who's a cambridge
04:07
scientist he's a computer programmer
04:09
his name uh his name is william tunstall
04:13
pedo he changed his ceremony
04:19
i was trying to research the fact i got
04:20
so sidelined
04:22
but you're keeping that even charles
04:25
dickens came up with
04:26
boredom as in he invented the word yeah
04:28
i've read his books
04:34
um yeah it's in the bleak house he says
04:36
someone is bored to death
04:37
by marriage so yeah
04:41
people just assumed that's what it meant
04:42
maybe it meant thrilled i'm bored and
04:44
means brilliant
04:45
so what people say to me when i'm
04:47
talking to them in the pub and they're
04:48
saying i'm so bored yeah
04:49
they're actually saying they're thrilled
04:51
is that why you keep going on and on
04:54
there's um there's a tribe in papua new
04:56
guinea called the baning
04:58
and they value work as the highest ideal
05:00
the best thing you do is work
05:02
and they have been called unstudyable
05:05
because of their failure to do anything
05:08
interesting
05:14
there was an anthropologist called
05:15
gregory bateson who said
05:17
who spent 14 months attempting to study
05:19
them in the 1920s before giving up
05:22
entirely
05:25
they don't even like sex is that right
05:27
yeah they don't like it very much
05:29
no they don't like it but they do have
05:30
kids but often a lot of adoption because
05:32
they don't really want to have kids
05:34
wait where do they go from
05:39
but they also don't like play because
05:41
it's a natural state of children and
05:42
they don't like children
05:44
and then sometimes they will punish
05:46
their children who are playing by
05:47
putting their hands in the fire
05:51
that's not boring that's an exciting
05:54
thing to do as a kid
05:56
um i think the most boring sport
05:59
ever the most boring sporting event ever
06:01
was the cycling event of the 1964 tokyo
06:04
olympics
06:05
okay where it involves people watching
06:07
two people who are cycling head to head
06:10
sitting still on bicycles for more than
06:12
an hour
06:13
what were they exercise bikes no it was
06:15
that you know
06:16
it's the sprint cycle when it goes head
06:17
to head and you know they often like
06:18
hover at the start of it
06:20
because i think is it a slipstream thing
06:22
so because they want
06:23
the other person to start cycling first
06:25
so they can get in their set stream
06:26
and these two guys just had this
06:28
standoff
06:30
he's still on the bike on the
06:46
um
06:49
[Laughter]
06:54
the way they induce boredom scientists
06:57
want to test board and obviously there
06:58
are definite ways of doing it so to do
07:00
pain
07:00
they put your hand in a bucket of icy
07:02
water and to be bored and they make you
07:03
copy out
07:04
the phone book that's the official
07:07
that's the official way of doing it but
07:09
if they want to really test you
07:11
they just make you read the phone book
07:13
so you have to focus on it and really
07:15
concentrate
07:15
and it but it improves uh your uh
07:18
creativity
07:20
so being in the phone doctors what being
07:22
bored
07:23
as in by induced by this and the
07:24
experiment they did so they tested uh
07:27
they had people who could uh just copy
07:29
numbers out of a phone book
07:30
or not do that and um at the end of that
07:34
everyone who'd been in it was asked to
07:36
this is the test think of
07:37
as many uses as they could for a pair of
07:39
plastic cups
07:42
which is apparently a test of divergent
07:44
thinking and how crazy and creative you
07:46
are
07:47
yeah and uh people who've been uh
07:49
reading the phone book or copying it out
07:50
were much more creative
07:52
yeah they're like throw them at the
07:54
person who told me to read them
07:58
and there's a scientific test uh the
08:00
boredom proneness scale
08:01
has come up with by two psychologists
08:03
and it's 28 statements which you have to
08:05
agree or disagree with
08:06
uh and it consists of statements
08:08
including i have projects in mind all
08:10
the time
08:10
things to do or much of the time i just
08:13
sit around doing nothing
08:16
if you can do that successfully i don't
08:18
think you're easily bored but i i
08:20
sometimes i sometimes read my own phone
08:21
book and test myself on
08:23
with like people i've forgotten who they
08:24
are
08:26
who is rose who is that does anyone else
08:30
do that
08:32
one yes one yes
08:35
i did a terrible thing the other day i
08:37
got a um i got a message
08:38
on my phone from someone saying hey
08:40
how's it going and you know that
08:41
terrible moment when you haven't got
08:43
their number
08:44
and you're like oh my god the message is
08:46
so familiar i definitely know who this
08:48
is they're gonna hate
08:49
so i have to do the old classic sorry
08:51
it's a new phone
08:52
uh i haven't got your number who is it
08:55
and the person wrote back going it's
08:56
sheila
09:00
so i did the lamest thing that i've done
09:03
to you is i wrote back a
09:05
sorry uh i'm australian there's a lot of
09:08
sheilas
09:11
which one i do
09:12
[Laughter]
09:18
um i found the uh the most boring
09:22
it's very unfortunate there's a resort
09:24
in switzerland and i was a bit confused
09:26
because it's described as a village and
09:27
a resort so i have a feeling
09:28
the villagers like to ski yourself yeah
09:30
um and it's been described as the most
09:32
boring resort in switzerland and
09:34
there you know when it's like oh i had a
09:35
nice time they're all of their things
09:37
it's just this
09:38
is so dull it's the most dark place and
09:40
the tourist board there
09:41
released this statement they said that
09:43
they think they got this title
09:44
because their quiet village has nothing
09:48
does nothing and offers nothing
09:53
and then they added we think that's a
09:54
positive
09:57
but so they've combated it now by going
09:58
they had a meeting and they're like how
10:00
do we sort out the boredom levels of our
10:01
of our
10:02
town how do we make it exciting and
10:03
vibrant and um they started
10:05
a um a stone skipping competition
10:09
which they're now trying to make a
10:11
worldwide thing but then they found out
10:12
that another similarly dull town
10:14
also decided the way to combat boredom
10:16
was to set up a skipping stones
10:18
competition
10:19
so they had to call them and say could
10:20
we do the qualifying round before they
10:22
get together
10:24
so you can't even go and see the finals
10:26
yeah
10:27
amazing okay some stuff on
10:28
ultramarathons yeah yeah
10:30
okay so ultra marathon athletes
10:32
sometimes have all their toenails
10:34
removed
10:35
before or after before i'm not touring
10:38
but like you know between cases
10:42
so you'll end up you'll run and you'll
10:44
have real problems with your toenails
10:45
and they'll get worse and worse and then
10:47
they get better
10:48
and then once they've been a problem
10:50
once they get worse and worse all the
10:51
time
10:52
uh and so yeah quite often they'll have
10:54
them taken off completely
10:56
what it reminds me of
11:10
i think it's a yank the other thing that
11:14
happens in ultra
11:15
american people is their body gets in
11:17
such uh trouble because they're really
11:19
really pushing it
11:20
that they are insatiable and want to
11:22
have lots and lots of sex
11:24
apparently this is according to one of
11:26
the athletes
11:29
[Laughter]
11:31
yes he was boring but i couldn't help
11:33
myself
11:35
no he said
11:36
[Laughter]
11:41
he says that when is when a person is in
11:43
dire straits like that
11:44
sex becomes a priority because naturally
11:46
we want to perpetuate the species
11:49
we want to procreate so it's like we're
11:51
in such trouble we're about to die we
11:52
need to have kids quickly
11:55
that's what he said
11:58
wow okay um marathons were
12:01
considered so dangerous that they
12:03
weren't supposed to happen again weren't
12:04
they in 1990
12:06
the 1902 olympics was the 1994
12:10
um it was decided because it was so
12:12
badly done
12:13
um that one guy so the doctors drove in
12:16
front of them along this dust track and
12:18
like
12:20
asphyxiated one of them did one of them
12:22
collapsed had like a pulmonary failure
12:23
or something collapsed very nearly died
12:25
because he'd inhaled so much dust
12:27
um another one the guy who won in the
12:28
end collapsed and had to be picked up
12:30
and was given strychnine which is that
12:31
um pesticide that we now use on
12:34
crops um to try and stimulate him and
12:35
then some brownies was a
12:37
at that time it was a useful singing and
12:39
it didn't do anything except slowly kill
12:40
you
12:41
um and then there was a guy who won
12:44
initially who was called someone laws
12:46
who decided he couldn't hack it after
12:48
about nine kilometers and jumped in a
12:50
car
12:50
passed by waved all the other athletes
12:52
jumped out at the other end sprint to
12:54
the finish line the 50 yards
12:55
um and won 50 yards and then there was
12:58
no one nearby presumably because i would
13:01
stop a mile back you know
13:04
well what he claimed was when he was
13:06
taking his trophy and someone did say
13:07
by the way i did see you cry most of the
13:11
way
13:13
he did say he'd always been meaning to
13:14
give it back it was just a joke but that
13:16
is the kind of thing
13:17
you think i'll claim this and if no one
13:19
says anything five one
13:20
and if they do i'll just say i was
13:22
kidding um
13:24
anyway yeah sam strong was gonna do that
13:26
wasn't he
13:28
just a joke guys
13:31
have you heard of rosa ruiz
13:34
she won the 1980 boston marathon she's
13:38
23 year old new yorker
13:40
and she was very very fast she was the
13:42
third fastest time
13:43
ever recorded for a female runner and
13:46
she was completely
13:47
sweat free and composed when she crossed
13:50
the finishing line
13:51
um obviously no one saw her during the
13:53
race
13:54
um no none of the checkpoints none of
13:56
the other runners
13:58
photographs of the race she was nowhere
14:00
um she was so fast they couldn't get
14:02
another photo
14:04
um she not car subway she just
14:09
just got subway straight across and um
14:12
does it count though
14:13
if you're still running while you take
14:14
all these jojos
14:16
when you ran to the subway it just
14:17
happened that should count just on the
14:19
spot
14:21
i was running i just got creative with
14:23
it but again she just jumped back in
14:25
half a mile before the end
14:27
which seems very cocky yeah why don't
14:30
you open in some ways you have to run up
14:31
a lot upstairs i reckon that's more
14:32
tiring
14:35
we've got to move on very soon to the
14:37
next bag can i can i just quickly give a
14:38
few hong kong things yeah
14:40
so because i'm born and raised in hong
14:42
kong and can i bet money on a hong kong
14:45
fact that you will say in the next
14:47
20 seconds oh okay yeah i'm just
14:49
wondering if there's a hong kong fact
14:50
about bruce lee to follow
14:52
no there's not oh my god although there
14:54
is a good bruce lee facts
15:09
um yeah so one thing i discovered was
15:11
that after the handover happened
15:13
there were a lot of things that the
15:14
chinese admitted to doing that they were
15:16
sort of tripping the british
15:18
colonialists about uh when they first
15:20
arrived and one thing was the names of
15:22
places in hong kong
15:23
and i've been to a lot of these places
15:25
and i had no idea that their
15:26
translations meant
15:27
what they are so for example there's a
15:29
place called uh
15:31
he see one so when the british were like
15:32
oh what's this called they went up
15:34
pc1 that translates as vagina
15:37
discharge bay vaginal discharge today
15:42
uh there's new shi wu which is cowshit
15:44
lake
15:46
uh and dao tao which is penis head rock
15:50
and these have been on signs in hong
15:51
kong for ages and they've they've
15:53
started changing some
15:54
so foreign devil's sex organ is now
15:56
changed
15:58
that's become pyramid rock and oral sex
16:00
corner is now swimming dragon cape
16:02
oh that's really cool i have no idea
16:04
when i was there
16:06
um we did you guys have any more that we
16:09
yeah okay time for fact number two and
16:11
that is
16:12
josinski yeah my fact is that the meter
16:16
is wrong
16:19
typical anna everyone everything's wrong
16:21
because yeah
16:23
i hate it what what on earth could that
16:25
mean so the
16:27
meter it was determined that the uh
16:29
meter so
16:30
in a guy called pierre mesha was a
16:32
french astronomer
16:33
in the 1790s he determined that he would
16:36
create a
16:37
they decided to go to a decimal system
16:38
and the meter would be the unit of the
16:39
system
16:40
and it would be exactly one ten
16:41
millionth of the distance between the
16:43
equator
16:44
and the north pole and so he went on
16:46
this big tour to
16:48
measure our arcs of the earth and stuff
16:50
and do calculations to work out what a
16:51
meter was
16:51
and there was a slight error in his
16:53
calculations a slight problem with one
16:54
of his bits of equipment
16:55
and he was 0.16 of a millimeter out
16:58
for every meter the meter we use now he
17:01
realized that he's gone wrong
17:03
um and so we tried to draw people's
17:04
attention to it but at that point they
17:06
were like we've made all these like
17:07
metal
17:08
sticks uh we can't just go and un-make
17:11
them
17:12
um and so it just stayed that way so
17:16
i mean but that's so unscientific for
17:17
how science usually works well we've
17:19
made them now
17:22
it's just gonna have to be it sorry i
17:24
hope that he went back to where he had
17:25
made the original mistake later in his
17:27
life
17:28
and he wanted to correct it he was on
17:29
this campaign to get it corrected
17:31
uh and he got to where he made the
17:32
mistake where he caught malaria and died
17:37
never check not working
17:42
he kept getting arrested didn't he when
17:43
he was doing all this stuff because
17:45
it was during the revolution and people
17:47
thought that his um
17:48
his uh what do you call these things
17:50
some instruments were weapons didn't
17:52
they
17:52
yeah so just kept him at prison all the
17:54
time yeah
17:55
and it was but that was actually a good
17:57
thing well was it good was it nice it
17:58
was when he was in prison that he
17:59
realized he'd got it wrong
18:00
i've got nothing else to do except
18:02
recheck my calculations and when he did
18:04
that he realized it was wrong
18:05
um but then it didn't do much good so in
18:08
fact there was in 1875 there was the
18:11
treaty de la metro or the treaty of the
18:13
meter
18:14
thank you
18:20
save me 10 valuable minutes
18:26
i'm just was gonna leave it and i
18:28
remember here
18:31
and um that decided to consecrate his
18:33
wrong meter
18:34
into like being the actual meter so to
18:36
say actually
18:37
meshan's meter is the proper meter the
18:39
meter is now going to be one meter and
18:40
0.616
18:42
millimeter long and so they created the
18:44
standard meter
18:45
um at this conference so they had to
18:46
create an exact replica
18:48
of the wrong meter but this time say
18:50
this is now the right meter
18:53
but they couldn't just take his wrong
18:54
one and say this is the standard meter
18:56
because that had been wrong
18:58
does that make sense it didn't
19:01
um but yeah
19:06
i'm still on trotting did i met
19:10
so before this happened in 18th century
19:12
france there were more than 250 000
19:14
different types of measurements in
19:16
france what
19:17
i know how many people were there was it
19:20
just
19:21
just different weights and measurements
19:23
and 250 000 yeah
19:26
[Laughter]
19:28
yeah they were told they were really
19:29
arrogant weren't they when they wanted
19:30
to go to the decimal system and there
19:32
are a lot of people saying i can't
19:33
believe you think you can just like make
19:35
the whole world abide by your ridiculous
19:37
system
19:37
but obviously they did japan went metric
19:40
in 1924
19:41
and no one noticed or did anything about
19:44
it and they had to do it again oh my god
19:52
well i think the u.s has tried to a few
19:54
times in the 1960s they were saying
19:56
let's do it and they've just never got
19:58
around to it and now because there are
19:59
three countries that are metric aren't
20:01
there
20:01
um so burma liberia and the us but
20:03
burma's about to go imperial now so
20:06
it's about to just be you and somebody
20:08
else yeah that's geometric sorry
20:10
sorry what's it just be liberia yeah
20:13
wasn't there that
20:14
great i don't know the full fact i hope
20:16
you guys do which is that
20:18
um
20:21
um mount everest uh when that was
20:23
originally measured
20:25
uh what was it 29 000 uh
20:28
feet yeah so well
20:31
yeah yeah go for it so they worked out
20:33
exactly how tall it was it was 29 000
20:35
feet uh but they thought that if they
20:37
put that as the actual number people
20:39
won't believe them and think that
20:40
they would think they just rounded them
20:41
up and so they put an extra two feet on
20:44
top so they call it twenty nine thousand
20:45
and two feet
20:46
yeah can you imagine you've just done
20:48
this incredible thing you've
20:50
measured the greatest mountain the
20:52
highest tallest mountain in the world
20:53
and it's a perfect number and you can't
20:56
tell them that it's sad
20:58
because no one will believe you poor guy
21:01
you must be like i can't [ __ ] believe
21:03
my life
21:06
um i really i really like mistakes i
21:08
think history uh
21:09
definitely some of the things that we
21:11
find as an everyday thing like the meter
21:12
is as a result
21:13
of a mistake um one of the things that
21:16
almost seems to have come out of being a
21:17
mistake
21:18
is um phosphorus uh matches the head of
21:21
matches
21:21
the only reason i mean we may have got
21:23
to it eventually but the actual reason
21:25
that we did end up getting to it is
21:26
because a guy in 1675 called hennig
21:28
brand um
21:30
got obsessed with the idea that he could
21:32
make gold uh by converting buckets of
21:34
urine
21:36
into gold so in his basement he had 50
21:38
buckets of urine
21:39
going on to a winner here and it went up
21:42
soupy
21:43
and it went all waxy and it just didn't
21:45
at all go goldy
21:47
if he had a cleaner he must have had to
21:49
have a note on every single bucket
21:51
please leave
21:55
but so far the weird um byproduct of him
21:58
doing this is that it actually led to
22:01
tubs of urine yeah no the tubs of urine
22:04
did this waxy substance that he ended up
22:06
having
22:06
um sort of lit up when light was making
22:09
contact with it and they were going what
22:10
is this and they realized this was a way
22:12
of making fire and so um actually
22:15
each bucket became way more worth than
22:17
gold so he actually exceeded the amount
22:19
of money that he would have made from
22:20
turning that into gold
22:22
exactly if i shine a light no no it's
22:25
like setting light setting light to it
22:27
oh right okay yeah yeah yeah um okay do
22:29
you know the first matches were a yard
22:31
long
22:32
seriously the first sold matches the guy
22:35
who invented them sold 168 in something
22:37
like three years
22:40
and they were a toy for the from rich
22:41
people and um they were also incredibly
22:44
dangerous because once you'd lit it
22:46
um it was more like a home science kit
22:48
almost it wasn't a practical thing
22:49
but once you lit it the globular flaming
22:51
stuff had this amazing tendency to just
22:53
fall to the ground
22:55
and set fire to whatever you were
22:56
standing on at the time
23:00
i guess because they weren't very
23:01
practical at lighting matches so once
23:02
you know well not on their yard log as
23:04
well
23:06
yes yeah good for bonding maybe that's
23:09
why they did it
23:10
[Music]
23:14
before the 19th century there was a unit
23:16
of measurement which was called
23:17
a lot
23:32
that's great the word acre used to mean
23:34
an open field of no particular
23:36
measurement
23:40
and yard comes from saxons used to wear
23:42
like a girl that comes from the same
23:43
origin as good doesn't it because it's a
23:45
belt that people used to wear and then
23:46
they take it off to measure something
23:48
when they needed to
23:49
know speculating as to what and
23:57
i'm nice some people understood how big
24:00
is this chord
24:02
um so there's another good unit for
24:04
measurement the garn
24:05
you'll know the garn no is a unit of
24:09
measurement that measures
24:10
space sickness and it's named after he
24:12
was the first u.s politician to go into
24:14
space actually
24:15
um it was named after senator jake garn
24:18
who was so sick during his space mission
24:19
but now it's meant one gone is
24:21
considered very spacic
24:23
that's great that's like the uh the mini
24:25
helen
24:27
the mini helen is the amount of beauty
24:30
you need to launch one ship
24:34
it's weird lots of uh units of
24:36
measurement that we have quite similar
24:37
so there's a japanese measurement called
24:39
uh i'll mispronounce this but kane jaku
24:41
it's an obscure one
24:43
as in it's not used anymore but it's
24:45
about the same as an english foot and
24:47
both of those things are about the same
24:49
length as the average man's foot so it's
24:52
sort of
24:52
you know common origin for lots of these
24:54
things which is quite cool
24:56
like the cubit is the distance from it
24:58
what is it your elbow to
25:00
to to the beginning of your hand so you
25:02
would send out someone with a big
25:04
arm to buy cloth in egypt
25:07
because they would be able to get more
25:09
cloth for their money because they have
25:10
bigger arms
25:10
just one guy with a really massive arm
25:13
yeah
25:15
one more that one huge yeah it's amazing
25:18
that we took so long to get to grips
25:19
with the fact that all humans are
25:21
different sizes and we can't
25:22
base a measurement system
25:24
[Music]
25:26
there's
25:30
uh charlemagne introduced it was
25:31
supposedly you know the size of his foot
25:33
it wasn't it was it was uh he was just
25:35
trying to stand in those things
25:36
but so it was bigger than his spots how
25:38
small it is but i don't know
25:50
you know what they say about them with
25:51
indeterminate sized feet
25:58
can i just say very quickly just as a
26:00
side note um every time that we've said
26:02
oh what's that called someone from the
26:04
crowd who's gone it's called that
26:07
you're gonna get this in any other
26:08
comedy gig but the audience are treating
26:10
it like a pop quiz
26:13
are you hearing that yeah can you not
26:14
hear it every time every time
26:17
listen the cat just could be the carrot
26:19
i just it's kind of interesting the
26:21
carrot measurement for
26:22
um diamonds is from carob seeds because
26:25
they thought people used to think that
26:26
all carrot seeds were exactly the same
26:28
amounts so
26:29
they don't same amount yeah like um who
26:32
was it was it bark who weighed out 60
26:34
coffee beans for each cup of coffee you
26:36
drank oh yeah
26:46
who was it
26:55
[Applause]
27:05
and um next fact comes from that lady in
27:07
the audience
27:10
okay sign for fact number three and that
27:12
is
27:13
james okay my fact this week is that
27:15
saints andrews aquarium
27:17
has three meerkats called churchill
27:20
admiral and sheila's wheels
27:25
i love that sheila's wheels america they
27:28
also had
27:28
aviva and direct line but they both died
27:37
um but yeah meerkats and funny names
27:41
first of all do does an aquarium have
27:44
meerkats because they've realized
27:45
there's no such thing as a fish
27:49
[Applause]
27:54
it's a brilliant aquarium by the way but
27:55
they had this little bit um of
27:57
rock where they didn't have anything to
27:59
put there and they got offered some
28:01
a catchment they said yeah great
28:03
meerkats
28:04
why not everyone must be here so you um
28:08
just you you actually i was there this
28:10
weekend yeah that's how you found this
28:11
out yeah
28:13
yeah did you know the meerkats i did
28:14
meet the mere cats and
28:16
fed the uh what do you call these things
28:18
penguins
28:20
and saw all the different fish yeah it
28:22
was great really really good definitely
28:24
recommend it so why are they why they're
28:25
named
28:26
um oh so they were named uh by someone
28:28
on facebook and they thought they were
28:29
such great names that would name them
28:31
that they have wait
28:32
they know their existing names don't
28:33
they yeah
28:35
yeah no they were allowed to name them
28:36
when they they were born there and
28:38
they were last night in my head admiral
28:40
has a tiny jacket with effortless
28:43
and the main two are called kate and
28:44
wills and the others are named after
28:46
members of the um
28:48
of the royal family as well and they
28:50
have a penguin who is called andy murray
28:54
yeah they do and it's a female
28:58
all the other penguins are named after
28:59
the murray family uh not your family
29:02
a tennis player yeah um interestingly
29:05
that the meerkats are named after
29:07
caitlyn wills because
29:08
meerkats two are threatened by
29:10
inbreeding
29:17
so meerkats and when they're fighting
29:19
they line up in a line
29:21
and then just charge at each other
29:23
really yeah like a horizontal line like
29:25
a key
29:26
like a horizontal line and so it's like
29:28
one against the other one and they just
29:30
charge into each other
29:31
and that is how naval warships work in
29:34
the elbow so presumably admiral
29:40
[Laughter]
29:42
um and one way they stop from fighting
29:45
each other is because they get a lot of
29:46
their
29:47
thing from scent they rub vic's vapor
29:49
rugs
29:50
on the meerkats because then they can't
29:52
smell each other and they don't get
29:53
angry with each other
29:54
but they also come i know who's related
29:56
to them
29:58
no but that's that's a good thing they
30:00
because they recently had one meerkat
30:02
who was
30:03
completely segregated they just like we
30:05
don't want you and they named the
30:06
meerkat oliver twist because he was
30:08
orphaned and one of the guys there had
30:09
to look after oliver twist and
30:11
that was the sentence he said we're
30:12
going to we're going to completely cover
30:14
them and fix
30:14
uh what's this and um
30:18
we're going to cover him as well and
30:19
that will allow him back into the group
30:21
because they won't know that he wasn't
30:22
smelling the same as us just reminded me
30:24
of a brilliant thing that i read this
30:26
week
30:26
you'll have already i'm sure a new
30:27
scientist which is that when you shake
30:30
someone's hand you smell your hand
30:31
afterwards because you're trying to get
30:32
the scent of the person who you shook
30:34
hands with
30:34
and all humans have been doing this
30:36
forever and no one's ever noticed
30:40
not me i can assure you i don't do that
30:42
and
30:43
they videoed a load of people um in the
30:45
room shaking hands and counted how often
30:47
they were touching their faces around
30:49
their
30:49
nose and mouth and it was a certain
30:51
number and when they shook hands it
30:53
always went up
30:54
it's amazing i've been watching
30:57
um my boyfriend over the weekend we
31:00
found various instances we've like
31:01
played on a board game shake hands after
31:10
[Laughter]
31:12
um on meerkats they're the only animal
31:16
we've observed aside cyber past two
31:17
we've seen
31:18
like employing proper teaching methods
31:20
to teach their young
31:21
how to hunt so because they hunt
31:23
individually you can't the young can't
31:24
just follow their parents around to see
31:26
how they hunt so the parents bring back
31:27
dead animals and then
31:29
explain to their kids how to dismember
31:31
them um another thing their cat mothers
31:33
do
31:34
is they kill the children of other mere
31:36
cat mothers
31:37
so that those mothers will breastfeed
31:39
their own children so that they can go
31:40
out and have fun
31:43
nice guys so they turn that mother into
31:47
a babysitter because she's lactating
31:48
anyway so she'll be like okay you can
31:49
look after my kids and i've killed yours
31:50
i'm gonna go on the house
31:52
they are they're horrible
31:55
not good pets apparently according to
31:57
some websites
31:58
because they can be very cruel to each
32:00
other aggressive to the people they
32:02
don't know
32:02
and they smell quite ferrity
32:06
like you to meet hannah
32:07
[Laughter]
32:10
i was reading about aquariums and i read
32:13
about london's very first aquarium which
32:15
was the royal
32:16
aquarium right has heard about the royal
32:18
aquarium uh it was basically
32:19
1903. uh sorry just before 1903
32:23
um because it was pulled down in 1903.
32:25
it had
32:26
huge tanks it was ginormous uh central
32:28
london and
32:29
uh the reason it was pulled down and
32:31
didn't do so well is that all these
32:32
giant tanks contained
32:33
no fish they were completely empty
32:37
because they because they marketed it as
32:38
having um sea life
32:40
so they needed salt water and they
32:42
realized how expensive that was and they
32:44
couldn't afford to
32:44
actually put the right amount of water
32:48
in there with the relevant fish
32:49
so people used to come and just look at
32:51
tanks of water
32:52
with the promise that one day that there
32:54
would be fish in them
32:56
but i don't think that was the first one
32:57
because the first one i think was at
32:58
london's zoo
32:59
which would have been where did you say
33:01
yours was 1903 it was
33:02
taken down london zoos opened in the
33:04
mid-19th century and it was called the
33:06
aquarium but it used to be called aqua
33:08
vivarium which is a cool name
33:10
um and an aquarium was originally a
33:12
watering place for cattle
33:13
so you see sometimes troughs where
33:15
people used to let their horses and cows
33:17
drink and it has aquarium written on it
33:19
and it looks like the worst aquarium in
33:20
the world but it's not
33:22
so did they call it aquavarium so it's
33:24
not to be confused and have cattle turn
33:26
up
33:27
hoping for a drink um
33:30
and then they have this thing called
33:32
aquarium mania
33:34
have you heard of this this is so cool
33:36
sounds great
33:37
um so there was a guy called philip
33:40
henry goss
33:40
or gosser we can edit that as
33:42
appropriate um
33:44
and he was one of the pioneers of
33:46
basically allowing fish to survive
33:48
whether you know
33:56
[Laughter]
34:03
he came up with a system whereby you
34:05
could keep fishing a tank
34:06
and they would get enough oxygen and you
34:07
need plants in there and you need to
34:09
get oxygen but then suddenly everyone
34:11
started getting aquariums so people got
34:13
them uh set into their windows
34:15
some people or put into chandeliers just
34:18
hanging out from the ceiling
34:19
some people um built a bird cage into
34:23
an aquarium so there would be a bird
34:24
living in there surrounded by fish which
34:26
it could never eat
34:30
torture yeah they've made a night
34:32
trainer
34:33
into an aquarium like designers now um
34:36
is they transformed into i don't know
34:38
how functional it is as a trainer
34:39
anymore but it looks really cool if you
34:40
look it up there's
34:42
the base of the shoe do you mean the
34:44
whole shoe is an aquarium so it's around
34:45
the edges of the shoe they fill it with
34:47
water and personal fission
34:48
that's incredible wow
34:51
that's weird also there's the world's
34:53
smallest aquarium isn't there
34:54
that's uh yeah
34:58
it's not even a full shoe um i think
35:01
this one is 24 millimeters high
35:03
so it's for several fish um it's this
35:06
guy
35:07
anatoly konenko who just designed like
35:09
he's a designer his job is designing
35:10
tiny things
35:11
um and so he's created the world's
35:14
smallest book
35:15
and that's the width of the human hair
35:17
is it advice on how to keep your new
35:19
zebra fish
35:25
um just if you think oh god i was just
35:27
gonna say did anyone see the
35:29
giant male octopus this week that was
35:31
trying to escape from its
35:32
aquarius oh yeah did anyone read what
35:34
the aquarium was in the room in seattle
35:36
the aquarium and
35:36
the owners said um so there was so this
35:39
octopus has crawled up the sides of its
35:40
aquarium and it's clutched at the
35:42
outside and it's got some of its centers
35:43
on the outside and it's trying to get
35:44
over
35:45
and aquarium officials say the octopus
35:48
named inc was not attempting a jailbreak
35:50
but simply learning to embrace his new
35:52
home with all eight
35:54
arms it was not an escape attempt they
35:56
said um
35:57
while putting the lid back on
35:59
[Laughter]
36:03
so some things about name changes and
36:05
product placements and stuff like that
36:06
oh yeah
36:07
so um aussie rules footballer gary
36:09
hocking
36:10
changed his name by depaul to whiskers
36:12
one year
36:13
because he was paid a lot of money by
36:14
that there was a ton and rugby star epi
36:17
taiyoni
36:18
who changed his name to paddy power and
36:21
you can
36:22
you can change the name of your your
36:24
stadium and stuff
36:25
but it doesn't always work out the mls
36:27
side colorado rapids
36:29
has changed their stadium to dick's
36:31
sporting goods park
36:33
but everyone calls it the dick
36:37
i like changing your name by people as
36:39
well i like all that kind of stuff so
36:40
there was a guy called gary brett from
36:42
potter's bra
36:43
uh potter's bath
36:46
mother's brother thank you
36:50
he changed his name to mr hong kong
36:54
and he said i've loved hong kong fury
36:56
since i was a boy and always wanted to
36:58
be named after him
37:00
i'm serious
37:03
i'm quite serious about being known as
37:05
mr my wife was a bit upset
37:08
but she should be honored to be married
37:09
to a number one super guy
37:11
who's quicker than the human eye
37:16
and then there was a guy called nigel
37:18
doyle who changed his name to mr toasted
37:22
tea cake and he said
37:25
some people can't believe it especially
37:27
because i don't even like tea cakes that
37:29
much
37:34
i thought it was a nice name it must be
37:36
so hard that if you love stupid names
37:38
that you've got to go
37:39

38:01
hard if you love a name
38:03
at least you're now married to a number
38:04
one super guy
38:07
there's a guy called sean hennessy who
38:09
changed his name to nigel bottom face to
38:11

you oh want to
38:31
some quite funny stuff on advertising
38:33
okay so the churchill dog with the uh
38:35
one of the official school churchill
38:36
let's start this back the churchill dog
38:37
was initially a real bulldog uh called
38:39
lucas who had to be sacked after one
38:41
advert because he refused to hold a
38:42
phone in his mouth
38:51
[Applause]
38:59
uh so we move on to our final fact of
39:02
the evening and that is my fact uh my
39:04
fact this week is that
39:05
the only ancient egyptian socks that we
39:07
know of
39:08
all belonged to tutankhamun is that
39:11
awesome
39:12
when they when he was when howard carter
39:14
went into the tomb
39:15
he found a lot of stuff a lot of gold uh
39:18
a lot of walking sticks
39:20
uh and he found three pairs of socks and
39:22
what's amazing
39:23
is that up until finding these socks
39:25
there had been no
39:27
depiction of socks in ancient egypt
39:30
whatsoever and i can't believe that that
39:32
wasn't the headline
39:34
they wore socks also because he wore
39:37
sandals it means that
39:38
he was assaulted
39:42
which is very exciting do you normally
39:44
have painted on the bottom of his
39:46
sandals
39:47
this is cool he had the faces of his
39:49
enemies painted on the bottom so that
39:51
wherever he walked he would be crushing
39:53
them
39:53
into the dust yeah so except there was a
39:56
lot of sand so that would just be great
39:57
branding because you'd see the guy
39:59
everywhere that's like the ultimate
40:01
marketing driver
40:06
um yeah they have but um so there were
40:08
some socks that i think those weren't
40:09
found intact were they they were
40:10
reconstructed from the evidence that
40:12
they had but the all this stuff come
40:13
intact no no no they sorry
40:15
in his tomb they found three that were
40:16
completely intact and then they found
40:18
three that weren't but they think that
40:21
they must have been socks they were the
40:22
other pairs
40:23
yeah but so he actually had six pairs
40:25
but three didn't make
40:26
the three thousand year period of time
40:29
that's since passed
40:30
there's in fact they've also found a
40:32
bottle of perfume speaking of the
40:34
3000 year period of time um which still
40:36
when they took the lid off it still
40:37
smelled
40:38
um i think it smelled like um something
40:41
rotten
40:42
oh no it smelled nice it smelled like
40:43
something like chamomile or vanilla or
40:45
something
40:46
after 3 000 years um he was also buried
40:49
with his own baby clothes which i think
40:50
is quite sweet
41:08
[Laughter]
41:11
yeah wow and he was buried with 413
41:15
what were called shabti figures and
41:17
these were little
41:18
slaves that you would take um into the
41:20
next life because often people think
41:22
that if you were the slave of a pharaoh
41:23
and your pharaoh died then you'd have to
41:25
kill yourself and be buried with him or
41:27
be buried alive with him which is even
41:28
worse but that never happened it was
41:30
actually little models of you that you
41:31
would um
41:33
he was also buried with james was
41:34
telling me an erection
41:36
[Laughter]
41:42
yeah he uh he had a 90 degree erection
41:48
and he's the only um known pharaoh as
41:50
far as i know who was buried that way
41:53
and no one really knows and james has
41:55
studied the field extensively
41:58
there was a guy called george glidden
42:00
who was going to unwrap uh mummy
42:02
in front of a lot of people he was a bit
42:03
of a charlatan but he did have a mummy
42:05
and he was gonna unwrap them and he said
42:07
it was a princess
42:08
uh princess mummy and he claimed that he
42:10
knew that he knew her identity he was
42:12
that she was the daughter of egyptian
42:14
priest
42:14
he knew that because he deciphered the
42:16
hieroglyphics on her sarcophagus
42:18
and then he wrapped her rapture rapture
42:20
in front of a load of people
42:22
and then they they realized actually
42:23
that it was a man and the princess had a
42:26
rather large penis
42:28
that's where we get the fairytale from
42:29
the princess and the penis
42:34
and he they he was embossed in this and
42:37
he explained that his error
42:38
was due to the poor handwriting of the
42:41
staff
42:43
a bad egyptologist always blames the
42:45
hieroglyphs
42:47
that's funny um have you heard of mummy
42:49
pettigrew no
42:50
mommy pedigree was a guy called thomas
42:52
pettigrew and he
42:53
uh he was he just unrolled loads of
42:55
mummies all the time he was an
42:56
egyptologist and
42:58
he unrolled 14 of them and he would do a
43:01
six part lecture series and he would
43:02
always save the unrolling for the very
43:04
last
43:04
lecture in the series to build up to it
43:06
throughout it and i just
43:08
found one sentence about it which i
43:09
wanted to share which is that
43:11
pettigrew's dramatic
43:12
erotically tinged unrollings became so
43:15
popular that at one gathering
43:16
the archbishop of canterbury himself got
43:19
squeezed out of the room
43:27
and then later on he was asked to turn a
43:29
victorian uh
43:30
duke into a mummy there was a the duke
43:33
of hamilton was obsessed with mummies
43:34
and he said will you mummify me after i
43:36
died he died yeah
43:39
and he did it but unfortunately he
43:40
didn't fit in the sarcophagus he's had
43:42
built so they had to take off his feet
43:47
um when they were excavating cummings um
43:50
clothes no actually this was later on
43:51
when they decided to recreate all his
43:52
clothes
43:53
then the person who was recreating them
43:55
decided to tell her students so the only
43:57
way that they could work out exactly how
43:58
he wore them
43:59
was by trying them all on himself
44:01
themselves so the students of this
44:03
archaeologist got to just try and all
44:04
student communities
44:05
and they worked out that something they
44:06
thought was a headdress was actually
44:09
um a pair of uh these things to be worn
44:11
on the arms to form the wings of a
44:13
falcon
44:14
that's what he went around with well i
44:16
don't know how you worked that out and
44:17
it sounds a bit like they were just
44:18
pissing about
44:19
the heavens on their own
44:27
um they think he had a congenital
44:29
disease or something because his
44:31
his hip measurements were extremely low
44:32
they were sort of out of proportion with
44:33
the rest of his body
44:34
and we don't know why well much like
44:36
kate and will's it was inbreeding
44:38
i'm talking about the beer cats mere
44:40
cat's katie wills yeah no his um
44:42
his parents were brother and sister
44:44
right yeah um i really like
44:46
the so when you were saying the thing of
44:48
unwrapping the mummies
44:49
that was a massive craze that the
44:51
victorians went through where
44:52
they suddenly were just digging up with
44:54
lots of mummies and using them
44:56
for virtually everything railroads used
44:58
to use them as fuel they're not just
44:59
that's not true i promise there's
45:00
nothing in america
45:02
mark twain said that they did and um we
45:05
think he was taking the mickey oh okay
45:07
yeah he is sorry
45:08
wait so how about the time traveler guy
45:09
when chicken arthur's court that's not
45:11
oh
45:11
man i've got some terrible news for you
45:14
about bill and ted's focus journey
45:20
how about mummy brown is that true mummy
45:23
brown is amazing mommy brown
45:25
was if you haven't heard of it is a um
45:27
it was a it was a paint
45:28
that that artist would use it was ground
45:30
up mummy that would lead to a brown
45:32
and they would use them on uh on their
45:34
paintings and a lot of people didn't
45:35
they just thought it was a cute name and
45:37
then someone explained
45:38
no it's an actual mummy and a lot of
45:40
famous artists actually
45:41
got quite disturbed by that and and
45:43
buried the rest of the paint um
45:46
giving it an honorable burial because
45:48
they just thought well there's a lot of
45:49
stuff about curses going on back then
45:51
and they didn't want that
45:52
but yeah you paint i can't believe that
45:54
it's extraordinary and they used it as
45:55
like a panacea as well that they they
45:57
would um
45:57
use this mummy and then they would take
45:59
it as a medicine for any illness yeah
46:02
i think they used it uh people in uh
46:04
thieves used it until the 20th century
46:06
to heal
46:06
bruises which is amazingly cavalier
46:08
considering
46:10
it's just a bruise yeah why do you need
46:13
to hit you don't need to heal a bruise
46:16
you could get an imitation mummy as well
46:18
if you didn't have the real thing
46:20
and so you would here's the ingredients
46:23
take the carcass of a young man
46:25
some say red head not dying of the
46:28
disease
46:29
let it lie for 24 hours in clean water
46:31
cut the flesh into pieces and add mare a
46:33
little aloe
46:34
and imbibe for 24 hours in the spirit of
46:37
wine and turpentine
46:38
it doesn't sound artificial to me
46:42
it sounds real yeah it's real but not
46:44
old
46:45
okay yeah um i was looking at burial
46:48
interesting burial sites
46:49
um and burial rituals but so the vikings
46:52
um
46:52
they were buried on ships obviously but
46:54
not at sea and
46:56
i read a really interesting theory that
46:57
because they were often very decapitated
46:59
animals so the
46:59
um ozberg osbourg viking ship which is
47:01
one of the most famous viking ships it's
47:03
been on earth
47:04
uh it was this woman she was buried with
47:06
ten decapitated horses
47:07
and i think a couple of decapitated dogs
47:09
and they think this is because
47:11
they because they have the ships on land
47:13
but to get to the underworld you have to
47:14
sail
47:15
it was in order to create a river a
47:17
convenient river of blood
47:19
from your decapitated horses on which
47:21
you could sail
47:22
um to the underworld yeah grotesque um
47:26
and also
47:26
so the first evidence of a ritual burial
47:29
is from 28 000
47:30
years ago of like a burial where people
47:32
were sort of buried with items and it
47:34
seemed like they believed in an afro
47:36
afterlife and it was two young
47:39
boys and they were buried with mammoth
47:41
tusks over two yards long but they've
47:43
been straightened
47:44
and we don't know how they straightened
47:45
them so they were we think they boiled
47:47
them and then straightened the mammoth
47:48
tusks into
47:49
they were four feet long and just
47:57
[Music]
48:01
i wrote a thing that i want as well for
48:03
death um which was that um
48:05
i was reading about but it's weird when
48:07
you read like someone's death you're
48:08
like whoa i want that
48:09
they sounded really cool um who was the
48:11
um
48:12
the oldest iceman that we found was made
48:15
by
48:17
i don't know what period he was from but
48:18
um he was complete and they found
48:20
everything on him they found a bag which
48:21
had magic mushrooms in it they found he
48:24
had shoes
48:24
he had stuff he had socks but what's
48:26
amazing is is that they found them
48:28
complete
48:28
and what they don't point out is that
48:30
they have found other people
48:32
who are complete but utz is a rare case
48:35
because he was just a hawking sorry
48:37

was found as a full a full body but then
49:00
i read about these other deaths where
49:01
they found
49:02
other people and basically because of
49:03
the way that um that tectonics and just
49:06
the way that things shift
49:07
they found full bodies but people have
49:09

49:10
and cartoonified you know at the end of
49:12
roger rabbit where he splats and he goes
49:14
into one form
49:15

49:16
fully like huge humans
49:19
in a huge world like a little crest
