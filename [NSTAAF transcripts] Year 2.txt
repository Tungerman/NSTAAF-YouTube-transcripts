00:18
hello
00:20
and welcome to another episode of no
00:22
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:24
this week coming to you from the soho
00:26
theater in central london my name is dan
00:28
schreiber i'm sitting with the three
00:30
regular elves it's james harkin andy
00:32
murray and anna chazinski and once again
00:34
we've got around the microphone with our
00:36
four favorite facts from the last seven
00:38
days and in no particular order here we
00:40
go uh starting with you andy my fact
00:43
this week is that finnish budget
00:44
meatballs have so little meat in them
00:46
that they have had to be renamed balls
00:48
[Laughter]
00:56
uh in finnish peoria
00:59
probably pronouncing that wrong which
01:00
translates as balls
01:04
but the thing is this is a this is not
01:06
entirely fair it's due to um european
01:08
labeling requirements basically all the
01:10
meat has already been cut off the animal
01:12
and the stuff i use to make the cheap
01:13
meatballs is uh
01:15
you know reconstituted yeah mechanically
01:17
reclaimed meat
01:20
but they are 50
01:21
animal um they're just not 50 stuff
01:24
which you can genuinely call meat
01:27
like a chop
01:29
so so they have had to rename them i
01:31
didn't realize meat stopped being actual
01:33
meat i thought as soon as it's come from
01:34
an animal that's it you'll meet for life
01:36
i know
01:37
yeah and so finland has the world's
01:39
oldest piece of chewing gum as well
01:40
isn't it or it had uh that was where it
01:42
was found it's a 5 000 year old piece of
01:45
chewing gum wow um it's made from a tar
01:48
made of birch bark and it was found by a
01:51
23 year old archaeology student sad
01:53
teeth marks in it wow yeah
01:56
did they say where it was found
01:58
in finland
02:00
i was hoping it would be on the bottom
02:01
of the world's oldest chew or something
02:03
like that
02:05
um
02:06
did you guys know that in weird
02:08
ingredients in food sand is in a lot of
02:11
what you eat
02:12
and it's just if you look at sandwiches
02:23
not them no
02:25
soup if you have a soup sandwich sure oh
02:28
yeah um are they in soup if anything
02:30
that so it's it's down on silicon
02:32
dioxide which i guess we kind of all
02:33
know is sand but you never really think
02:35
about it so it's it's put on ingredients
02:38
lists i checked my soup in my cupboard
02:39
as anti-caking agent brackets silicon
02:42
dioxide and it's just sand and they put
02:44
it in like yeah be like in um grated
02:47
cheese so it doesn't stick together yeah
02:48
exactly yeah and there was a a guy an
02:51
artist from chile called marco evaristi
02:54
and he mixed fat removed from his body
02:57
by liposuction with ground meat to make
03:00
meatballs
03:01
did he what
03:03
i bet trading standards got involved
03:06
did he eat them or did he send them to
03:08
someone else i believe he definitely
03:10
displayed them in a gallery uh because
03:12
he's an artist i'm a feeling he might
03:14
have fed them to his friends oh wow yeah
03:16
did he tell his friends yeah i think
03:18
they knew right yeah otherwise that
03:20
would be a bit of a bad trick yeah well
03:22
that's end of friendship why have we had
03:23
no christmas card this year from the
03:24
jacksons
03:28
we haven't seen them since may when i
03:30
fed them my own body
03:32
ground up with meat that i found
03:35
um i found a few things on when you said
03:38
this fact i just i love whenever someone
03:40
is forced into having to rename
03:42
themselves something new because the
03:43
thing they were saying was not true or
03:45
was just they were stuck in a thing
03:47
there's a great one it's actually in one
03:48
of the qi books of the fact books which
03:50
is that um there's a there's a place in
03:52
australia called shark bay but it was
03:54
renamed
03:56
safety beach
03:59
to attract more tourists
04:01
first first they changed their name from
04:03
shark uh bay to shark beach and they
04:06
still weren't getting many people in
04:08
guys maybe it wasn't the bay beach thing
04:10
that was
04:10
just putting people up what else could
04:12
it be frank i was reading an interview
04:15
with a greek brewer a greek beer brewer
04:18
who was complaining about the fact that
04:20
his beer that he's trying to brew keeps
04:21
it being pushed out of the market by
04:23
heineken which basically dominates the
04:24
greek beer market
04:25
and his beer only has 5.5 percent of the
04:28
market increase at the moment and it's
04:29
called vagina beer and i just keep
04:32
thinking is this interview gonna mention
04:34
at any point in the fact that perhaps a
04:37
bit of rebranding might work yeah
04:39
another one that's a favorite of mine
04:40
there was a uh there's a sushi bar in
04:42
montreal that got forced to change its
04:44
name by by a judge a high court judge um
04:47
because
04:48
so the name that they gave it was a
04:50
yo sushi
04:53
f-u-k-y-o sushi and it looked like there
04:56
was a moment where they were going to
04:57
try and defend it because it's a genuine
04:59
japanese word and you know it means good
05:01
fortune in japanese it's also in a
05:03
karate stance apparently it's also the
05:05
main complaint that people give at the
05:06
restaurant when they haven't like their
05:08
food
05:09
but they yeah so their downfall was the
05:11
fact that they have a facebook page and
05:13
they started saying we have other ideas
05:15
for bits on the menu that we want to put
05:16
up and this really was their downfall
05:18
because the other bits on the menu were
05:20
a you two role
05:24
me role
05:25
you all role
05:27
and my favorite the your mama role
05:32
wow it's uh they've changed i like that
05:33
so they were embracing it trying to
05:35
embrace it i think it was a joke from
05:37
the beginning yeah
05:38
okay back to bowls okay in the early
05:40
twenties there was a uh a law case
05:43
between uncle luke's mint bowls um these
05:46
guys who made these these little
05:47
confectionary things uh and uncle jack's
05:50
mint balls
05:51
and uncle luke was saying uncle jack
05:53
should be making mint bowls etc etc
05:56
and the judge decided that the term
05:58
uncle could not be copyrighted as there
05:59
are millions of uncles around the world
06:03
and he said uncle jack is just as
06:05
entitled to offer his bowls to the
06:07
public as uncle luke
06:10
wow
06:12
my parents are in tonight
06:17
so some facts about finland oh why not
06:19
uh finland is a brilliant place um they
06:22
have the fact that's my fault
06:24
damn and i had that one too
06:27
they like uh strange competitions in
06:29
finland so they have the mobile phone
06:32
throwing world championships
06:34
the world air guitar championships the
06:36
wife carrying world championships um
06:39
swamp soccer and the finals of that are
06:41
called the ss world championships
06:44
and i think it's too late for that one
06:46
actually there was um just speaking of
06:48
ss do you remember south end on c um
06:51
their traffic wardens i think had a
06:53
uniform which had ss on i had to change
06:56
it because i have too many complaints
06:58
yeah
06:58
yeah they could have had sos very easily
07:02
that's true um finland's also got an ant
07:05
nest sitting
07:06
competition that you do
07:08
it's basically the idea behind it is
07:10
there's a bunch of ant nests and you
07:11
take your trousers down you sit on it
07:13
and
07:15
and then you wait
07:17
the last person to leave is the winner
07:20
wow wow
07:21
there's one of the champions of the
07:23
mobile phone
07:24
phone throwing competition is also a
07:27
hammer thrower which i quite like as if
07:29
you're hammer throwing you don't know
07:30
what to do in your offseason
07:33
championships but also in the wife
07:35
carrying championships then uh there are
07:36
various different positions in which you
07:38
can carry your wife um and people debate
07:40
over which one is the most efficient and
07:42
there's one which is estonian style
07:44
which is if you have the wife's legs
07:46
over your shoulders and hanging down
07:47
which makes you wonder what kind of
07:48
weird racism was happening
07:51
estonia's sexual practices whatever that
07:54
was named i think it was because the
07:56
first people to do it where estonian
07:58
but it is the most populous
08:00
it is the most popular style and it's
08:02
the one that the winners always use
08:03
these days it's the best one
08:05
flop of yeah
08:07
yeah it must be every year someone comes
08:09
in with a rogue new position they've got
08:10
their wine and everyone gets nervous
08:13
going what does he know that we don't
08:15
and then they fail every single year
08:17
estonia's going oh yes
08:20
that was a good estonian impression by
08:21
the way
08:23
there's a boot throwing world
08:24
championships also held in in finland um
08:27
and for an interview they asked the
08:29
two-time organizer not the two-time
08:31
winner the two-time organizer
08:34
of the championships and they have their
08:36
own official throwing boot
08:38
so you can't use another boot you can't
08:40
use a non-regulation boot
08:42
and they have all kinds of they have
08:44
anti-doping regulations and people have
08:45
been kicked out of a boot throwing
08:47
competition
08:48
for drugs infractions
08:52
boot it out
08:54
they also have a mosquito killing
08:56
championships
08:58
that is how many mosquitoes you can kill
09:00
in five minutes using only your hand
09:03
wow
09:04
are you allowed to use your other hand
09:06
what is
09:10
i think you have to go and find them
09:10
because it's like there's a lot of
09:12
mosquitoes in the archer come there
09:14
yeah do you have a tiny tiny gun dog to
09:16
go and retrieve the corpses when you've
09:17
killed them
09:20
now you're being silly
09:22
they must have so many gold medals like
09:24
potential gold medalists in finland who
09:26
are like have the olympics brought up
09:28
the wife cat no damn it like finland
09:30
would wipe the olympics clean if these
09:32
were allowed in and if they didn't just
09:34
have normal spots at the olympics
09:36
well there's always in the news reports
09:38
of like whoever's won the mobile phone
09:39
carrying or the wifi or whatever it's
09:40
always it was won by a finnish man this
09:42
year as if anyone else is really going
09:45
there yeah
09:47
also you can't call your friends to tell
09:48
them you've won which is a bit of a
09:50
nightmare
09:53
oh we met james and i met a guy just
09:55
speaking of throwing things we met a guy
09:57
two days ago
09:58
who um he's a scientist who
10:01
part of his major study and he published
10:03
a paper on this and he's really proud of
10:04
it is that he throws snails for a living
10:06
yeah yeah um
10:08
he so he chucks them over his his garden
10:10
fence and then he waits two years to see
10:13
if they come back
10:15
and he knows if they've come back
10:16
because he puts tip x dots all over them
10:19
and then he chucks them he puts one tip
10:21
x on if one uh whenever he gets one in
10:23
his garden he throws it over into
10:25
there's like a railway that goes next to
10:26
him so he throws them over onto the
10:27
rails
10:30
but then every time they come back he
10:32
puts another dot and another dot and i
10:33
think there was like one with 17 dots on
10:35
it in the end because he just kept
10:36
coming back and coming back and he
10:38
doesn't use slugs because the tip x
10:40
doesn't hold on there
10:42
so he has no way of doing it um sorry
10:44
we're gonna have to move on but yeah do
10:45
you want to another cool thing they have
10:46
in finland is fines all of their fines
10:49
are dependent on your salary or your
10:51
income and so there was a nokia
10:53
executive in 2002 for instance who has
10:56
fined 116 000 euros for going at about
10:59
40 miles an hour and a 30 mile an hour
11:01
speed limit on something
11:02
it feels like the mobile phone throwing
11:04
was invented by nokia don't you think
11:06
because he's like thrown away oh you're
11:07
gonna have to buy another phone now i
11:09
know
11:10
do you know what nokia used to make
11:12
i used to make gas masks really yeah the
11:14
finnish army used nokia gas masks until
11:17
1995.
11:18
not cool that is good can imagine you've
11:21
got your gas mask on
11:22
it
11:26
um we need we need to move on um i just
11:28
got one last thing which is that um the
11:30
movie just going back to meatballs the
11:32
movie cloudy with a chance of meatballs
11:34
in israel was retitled it's raining
11:36
falafel
11:40
it would be good
11:42
in finland they've renamed it cloudy
11:44
with a chance of bowls
11:49
okay time for fact number two and that
11:52
is jazinski uh yeah my fact is that uh
11:56
queen victoria's acquaintance once had
11:58
to apologize to her after her pet jaguar
12:01
killed three of the queen's pet deer
12:03
[Laughter]
12:05
which i just think would have been a
12:06
really awkward moment and
12:08
it's bad planning though isn't it where
12:10
can i leave the jaguar just put him in
12:12
with a deer
12:14
you're not gonna believe what happened
12:17
yeah i do it's an amazing sentence that
12:19
is the closest sentence to the kind of
12:22
other worldliness of royalty when you're
12:24
having to apologize that you're jaguar
12:27
but this woman wasn't she wasn't a royal
12:29
was she no she was by a weird
12:31
coincidence she was bosey's aunt do you
12:34
guys know bose like oscars
12:37
um so
12:38
and she was an amazing character she's
12:39
called lady florence dixie she was an
12:42
explorer she was a raging 19th century
12:44
feminist um she picked up the jaguar in
12:47
patagonia when she was chased up a tree
12:49
by a jaguar mother and she was in this
12:52
tree and she had to shoot the jaguar
12:53
mother dead and then she felt bad for
12:54
the the baby jaguar and so she brought
12:56
it home and she recounted all this in a
12:58
letter to charles darwin in fact wow
13:01
they were correspondents she did
13:03
correctly this is such a name drop of a
13:05
story
13:07
i was at queen victoria's uh because my
13:10
son is dating oscar wilde and um anyway
13:14
darwin the thing is that is
13:16
could you put any more
13:19
she was well connected yeah wow what i
13:22
love about her is the guy who she
13:23
married you know this guy he was called
13:25
sir alexander beaumont churchill dixie
13:29
and his nickname was abcd
13:33
[Laughter]
13:37
actually so they were known in court
13:39
circles apparently as sir sometimes and
13:42
lady always drunk
13:48
i think she enjoyed a good time i
13:50
actually don't think queen victoria
13:51
would have liked her very much because a
13:52
her jaguar killed queen victoria's
13:54
beloved pet dear and was then sent to a
13:56
zoo but also her you know john brown
13:59
queen victoria's lover of her later
14:01
years lady florence dixie claimed that
14:03
she'd been attacked by irish
14:05
transvestites in the grounds of windsor
14:07
palace and demanded that that be
14:10
investigated and so john brown was sent
14:12
out into the wet cold and he died about
14:14
six months later of the colt he caught
14:16
out doing that no really six months
14:18
later of a cold he caught wow that is a
14:20
bit cold not good
14:22
mega man yeah
14:25
i wrote so i've never looked into queen
14:27
victoria before um she was such a badass
14:30
she was so cool yeah she wore crotchless
14:33
underwear she was she did she wore quite
14:35
a lot you might be googling the wrong
14:37
person
14:39
are you googling victoria's secret
14:42
no she she how is that badass that's
14:45
only badass if you're horse riding or
14:46
something
14:48
it's not like harder
14:54
playing fast and loose without yeah i
14:56
was building up to the more badass all
14:58
right
15:00
hey i saw that fiona bruce on antiques
15:02
roadshow they were showing that uh they
15:04
were selling them and they were like
15:05
this is a crotchless bit of underwear
15:07
actually what happened was when she died
15:08
her underwear was auctioned off to
15:10
people i think and she had enormous
15:12
bloomers like she was very big by the
15:14
end of her life in fact the
15:16
circumference of queen victoria's waist
15:18
by the time she died was larger than her
15:20
height wow which is quite impressive so
15:22
she was technically the wrong way up for
15:24
the last years of her life
15:31
very sad very sad
15:34
um you know the first thing she did
15:36
after her fight exhausting five-hour
15:38
coronation ceremony she ran upstairs to
15:41
wash her spaniel
15:45
she had a spaniel called dash or dashi
15:47
and she loved it so much she loved all
15:49
her animals a huge amount actually she
15:51
was when one of her dogs died she had to
15:53
be sedated she was so upset and she had
15:55
a parrot called coco which could sing
15:57
god save the queen which was a fun fun
15:59
trick
16:00
um yeah that is the most arrogant thing
16:02
i've ever heard of anyone doing with
16:04
their pet i think no i think her family
16:05
taught it to sing god save the queen and
16:07
then they they
16:08
you know they revealed that her and she
16:10
was delighted you know okay
16:12
she and she and i had huge arguments as
16:14
well they had they had not
16:16
they painted us having had a very very
16:17
rosy marriage but actually she was very
16:19
angry with him she was having children
16:21
all the time she at one point had nine
16:23
children under 15 years old which is a
16:25
lot and she was just constantly busy
16:27
having children and so albert had a lot
16:29
of the responsibilities of state farmed
16:31
out to him so he did a lot of dealing
16:32
with parliament in his life but she was
16:34
very angry about that he had to go and
16:36
put notes under the door apologizing
16:37
when he'd wielded too much power but so
16:40
like i because she has the reputation of
16:42
the famous quote of we are not amused um
16:45
and so it's attributed to her but there
16:47
is no direct evidence that she ever said
16:49
it and the thing that we have from her
16:51
staff and family they are on record as
16:53
saying that she didn't say it and that
16:54
she was in fact immensely amused
16:57
[Laughter]
16:58
that's such a lovely pr push
17:01
actually she was immensely
17:04
so no further questions
17:07
okay some things on pets maybe okay yeah
17:09
okay so um
17:11
rudolf ii the habsburg emperor and king
17:14
of hungary he had a pet lion
17:16
and he had his horoscope read by tycho
17:18
brahe uh a friend of the show
17:22
who told him that the king and the lion
17:23
had the same star sign
17:25
uh and so when the lion died rudolf shut
17:28
himself in his room was convinced he was
17:30
gonna die as well and he died three days
17:32
later
17:33
wow because tycho bright we've talked
17:35
about him before but um he was a serious
17:38
scientist who understood that astrology
17:40
was all complete bollocks but it was how
17:42
he made all his money wasn't it so he
17:43
had
17:44
his whole kept on
17:45
to feed these guys lies he should have
17:47
got a pet tortoise or something
17:49
but it would have you can't throw
17:50
someone to the tortoise can you
17:52
[Laughter]
17:54
during the civil war another friend of
17:55
the show prince rupert of the rhine
17:59
we're very popular with
18:01
dead people uh no he had a poodle called
18:03
boy uh who he trained to his leg
18:06
and urinate on cue whenever the name of
18:08
his enemy um commander pym was spoken so
18:11
whenever he said his enemy the dog would
18:13
urinate
18:14
and the people thought that he was satan
18:16
in disguise this dog the enemy thought
18:18
that and they thought he was immune to
18:20
bullets and could catch bullets fired at
18:22
rupert in his mouth
18:25
that's why rupert's had some he's had
18:26
some good pr really good pr people did
18:29
believe amazing nonsense didn't they
18:30
back in the day
18:32
yeah it wasn't true
18:34
now um
18:35
i'm sorry darling used to have a pet
18:37
ocelot who he took everywhere with him
18:39
and if the ocelot urinated on one of his
18:41
paintings when he was painting it he
18:43
would charge the buyer more for it
18:46
he would charge them
18:47
charge the buyer more oh right when he
18:49
sold a painting he'd be like my
18:50
at miles a lot of weed on this so
18:52
yeah that's 10 increase on the price
18:54
joint work wow
18:56
um the first budgies cost as much as a
18:58
house
19:01
budget your house budget
19:03
darling i really think we need to go for
19:05
the house
19:06
come on we gotta get on the budgie
19:08
ladder
19:16
in the 19th century in 1845 so they cost
19:18
about 50 quid which for a working man
19:20
was an annual salary and there was a
19:22
budgie boom as well when that value shot
19:24
up because demand outstrips supply so
19:27
much because they had to be brought over
19:28
from australia do you know where i found
19:30
out the budgie costing as much as a
19:31
house thing jeff capes
19:33
former britain's strongest man
19:35
competitor jeff capes now keeps budgies
19:37
he's the president of the budgie society
19:39
oh wow yeah um i was i was looking into
19:42
royals with pets because i just i just
19:44
say it's so bizarre because they do get
19:46
given a lot of presents which end up
19:49
being exotic animals and stuff and henry
19:51
iii of france he had this thing where he
19:54
used to carry so he had pets he had
19:56
three dogs and he used to carry them in
19:57
a basket around his neck like a big bit
20:00
of bling and they used to bark at people
20:02
they didn't trust and he'd be like get
20:03
away from me if they didn't like the
20:05
person the dogs would bark them away but
20:07
i was so i looked into the tower of
20:08
london because i've met through stand-up
20:11
uh a guy who is the raven master of the
20:14
tower of london who does stand up as
20:16
well
20:18
it's crazy he looks after the ravens he
20:19
lives there he's that's his job he does
20:22
stand up he has dick jokes it's amazing
20:23
right and but basically the tower of
20:25
london has extraordinary animals or at
20:27
least did back in the day they had a
20:29
polar bear apparently it was a white
20:30
bear no one knows for sure i can't see
20:33
anyone yeah and it used to um swim in
20:35
the thames right yeah yeah it was kept
20:36
on a long that was henry the third of
20:38
england yeah wasn't it it was kept on a
20:39
deliberately long lead so it could go
20:41
for a swim
20:42
i went to the not many visitors to the
20:44
tower in those days
20:46
it's very confusing because it sounds
20:48
like the animals had a lot of liberties
20:49
they i went to the tower of london's
20:51
website and they have a whole page on
20:53
the animals that used to live there and
20:54
they included they had monkeys which um
20:57
the monkeys were actually they lived in
20:59
a furnished room so you could go and
21:00
visit these monkeys and it says be
21:02
amused by their antics and human-like
21:04
behavior um but they were removed
21:06
eventually because uh one of them tore a
21:08
boy's leg off in a day in a dangerous
21:11
manner
21:14
which makes it sound like the first time
21:16
they did it it was kind of quite working
21:19
you did it safely this time so we're
21:21
gonna we're gonna keep the boys coming
21:22
into the room
21:24
but you are on a warning now
21:27
we're gonna have to move on uh but any
21:30
any last minute i just have a pet fact
21:34
in 2004 a man called jake perry owned
21:37
the guinness world record holder for the
21:39
world's oldest cat
21:41
in 2005 that record was broken by
21:43
another one of jake perry's cats
21:46
this man has owned the two oldest cats
21:48
by chance oh he's lying about how old
21:51
they are or he painted the first one a
21:53
different color
21:54
[Laughter]
21:56
the other one it died
21:58
the other one died
21:59
they counted the number of rings they
22:01
were old
22:03
terribly sad they have to chop the cats
22:05
down
22:06
to find out how old the first one died
22:09
um and yeah he said he feeds his cats
22:11
bacon eggs asparagus broccoli and a cup
22:14
of coffee every morning and
22:16
they smoke 40 a day and
22:18
they just they're long lived it's just
22:20
full of spirit
22:22
um we're gonna have to move on to uh
22:25
fact number three
22:26
and that's my fact my fact this week is
22:28
that the statue of liberty originally
22:30
wore a headscarf so the statue of
22:33
liberty was originally designed for
22:34
egypt and it was originally meant to be
22:36
at the mouth of the suez canal it was
22:39
going to be standing there with a torch
22:40
and hand it was going to be a peasant
22:41
lady and it was going to it was all
22:43
designed it was all ready and then egypt
22:46
had a financial situation where they
22:47
couldn't afford it anymore and the guy
22:49
who was called by foldy he was an
22:51
architect he was so distressed that he
22:54
had this colossal thing that was going
22:56
to be built that was no longer built he
22:57
went back to france he was french and he
22:59
then said why don't we make a new
23:02
similar very similar looking thing
23:05
for america and that became the statue
23:06
of liberty so originally it was meant to
23:08
be a peasant woman yeah standing at the
23:10
sewers you said torch in hand actually
23:11
the head of egypt when he agreed to it
23:13
wanted the charge on the head rather
23:15
than the hand which would have looked a
23:16
bit weird wouldn't it it's it's
23:18
interesting because it was um it it's it
23:21
represents so much for america and this
23:23
guy obviously when he was trying to get
23:25
it made in america as well he had to
23:27
deny so much about the fact that it was
23:29
originally meant to be all right for
23:31
egypt and everyone was like but it feels
23:33
like you were definitely pitching this
23:34
in either oh
23:36
totally different yeah and so they kept
23:38
bringing up stuff like well okay how
23:40
about the fact that when you've now
23:42
re-pitched it to us you still want the
23:44
statue of liberty not on what we now
23:46
know is the classic stan that the statue
23:48
of liberty's on he wanted it on a
23:49
pyramid
23:51
i just did a really bad job of losing
23:53
the egypt connection and then they said
23:56
um they said but it's literally the same
23:58
design you've got a torch being held up
24:00
and he was like oh okay sure so how the
24:03
hell am i meant to design a lighthouse
24:05
effectively without a torch being up
24:07
there for the light forgetting to point
24:09
out that in both of the designs the
24:11
lighthouse element of it was in the head
24:14
so again he just kept shooting himself
24:16
uh in the foot yeah you talked about the
24:18
um you talked about the kind of plinth
24:20
that it's on yes that was paid for by
24:22
america right yeah so france paid for
24:25
the statue and america paid for the
24:26
plinth but america couldn't get any
24:28
money for the plinth and so they had a
24:30
big sort of campaign to try and get it
24:32
and there was a company called castoria
24:35
who made laxatives who offered to give
24:37
all the money if the name of the
24:38
laxative would be displayed on the top
24:40
of the statue
24:42
wow
24:43
a very different kind of liberty isn't
24:44
it
24:47
free and easy movements
24:48
[Laughter]
24:51
so the the the the original sort of
24:53
garment the peasant garment she was
24:54
designed to be a slave but the slave was
24:56
called
24:57
the word for it is a fella right
24:59
f-e-l-a-h and one of the main conspiracy
25:02
theories about the statue of liberty i'm
25:03
straying into your territory here dan
25:05
is the the model for it was a man
25:07
and we don't really know a lot of people
25:09
say that the model was um either
25:11
bartholdi's mother uh or or the face of
25:14
model on his mother we don't but we
25:16
don't know and what you're saying is
25:17
that they heard that it was a fella and
25:19
they thought yes that's where i think
25:21
it's come from wow
25:23
there was a really good book written
25:25
last year i think about the statue of
25:26
liberty and i can't know what it's
25:27
called but um the woman who wrote that
25:29
did hypothesize that he based the face
25:31
on his brother who committed suicide i
25:33
think um whom he really loved and it
25:36
does look like a very masculine face if
25:37
you look at it it's a man i wouldn't say
25:39
that so but not in a dress
25:42
the only uh evidence actually as far as
25:45
i could find that it was based on his
25:47
mother is the fact that um someone later
25:50
on after it had been built went to the
25:52
opera or went to a big sort of arts
25:54
event with him and his mother and when
25:57
his mother came in this guy was like and
25:58
i turned around and i was like whoa it's
26:00
the statue of liberty
26:01
[Laughter]
26:02
and then he said that to people and
26:03
they're like oh that must be it so i
26:05
don't know how credible he is the idea
26:07
of the statue of liberty was actually by
26:08
a guy called la boulais who was a friend
26:11
of bertoldi and he said in a dinner and
26:14
this was in a newspaper article of
26:15
someone who was at that dinner that it
26:17
should be a statue that can be seen from
26:19
the shores of america to the coast of
26:21
france
26:22
yes that's
26:25
so um some of the guys at qi.com
26:28
talk um posital and ziggy worked out how
26:32
how it would have to be in order that
26:34
you'd be able to see it from france and
26:35
it would have to be more than 3 000
26:37
kilometers high
26:41
how high
26:42
i'm an idiot so the international space
26:44
station
26:46
yeah the iss goes around what like three
26:48
or four hundred kilometers high so it's
26:49
like another 10 times that much
26:53
that's massive
26:57
yeah
26:58
wow
27:01
yeah
27:02
thomas edison of uh
27:04
of electricity fame
27:06
[Laughter]
27:07
wanted
27:09
he suggested putting a massive uh disc
27:12
inside the statue so it could deliver
27:14
speeches from inside it all across new
27:16
york
27:17
yeah
27:17
so like it's talking to you yeah exactly
27:19
yeah and no one took him up on it
27:21
thankfully it's weird to think of her as
27:23
it as originally brown or kind of golden
27:27
yellowish brown for the first 25 years
27:29
obviously being made of copper it was
27:31
supposed to be this shining golden
27:33
statue um because we so obviously picked
27:35
our green and bottledy wanted her to be
27:37
guilded in solid gold i think at first
27:39
he tried to petition the american people
27:41
to raise loads of money to do that and i
27:42
think they said we've already raised
27:44
quite a lot of money thanks very much um
27:46
he had real trouble funding it he tried
27:48
to get her image copyrighted so that
27:51
every single image of her that appeared
27:52
he'd get money for it which was quite in
27:54
the 1880s was quite a modern
27:57
thing to try and do and he failed you
27:59
used to be able to they had fundraising
28:01
dinners as well where they would try
28:02
desperately try and raise money because
28:03
all they need they had the statute all
28:05
they needed was the pedestal and you
28:06
could buy a meter tall version made of
28:09
ice cream at these dinners
28:11
fun
28:14
he sold his signature
28:16
and
28:17
bartholdi sold it three thousand times
28:19
to to raise money for it um and the only
28:21
way they eventually got the money was by
28:22
crowdfunding basically they printed in
28:24
um joseph pulitzer printed in his paper
28:26
the name of everyone who gave even if
28:29
you gave a penny to it they would print
28:31
your name in the paper so a it raised a
28:33
huge amount of money and b
28:34
people bought the paper because they
28:35
wanted to see their name in it so
28:36
circulation rocketed as well so it's
28:38
quite clever this guy sounds amazing it
28:39
sounds like he started copyright laws
28:43
kickstarter
28:45
this is really advanced thinking um so i
28:47
went on to trip advisor to see what
28:49
people thought of the statue of liberty
28:51
and there was one guy called h jammer
28:54
and he didn't like it very much actually
28:57
he said
28:58
it was bad because i don't like the
29:00
sight it's just a statue nothing else
29:03
the tour was bad and i ordered food at
29:05
the court and the person sneezed on my
29:07
burger
29:10
i really don't get it this was the worst
29:12
trip ever one star
29:17
um we're going to have to move on uh to
29:19
our final fact you guys got anything
29:21
more that you want to add to that no
29:23
let's get it okay time for a final fact
29:25
of the evening and that is james harkin
29:28
okay my fact this week is that a polo
29:31
mint takes 42.5 minutes to dissolve if
29:35
you stick it up your nose
29:38
and first-hand qi research is the best
29:41
kind of
29:42
own research i actually when i read that
29:44
i stopped on the way to get parliaments
29:46
um so for the rest of the show i might
29:48
have one we've only got 15 minutes left
29:49
so just have half
29:52
while he's doing that i'll explain the
29:53
points of this fact so this it was a
29:56
fact given to me by my mum actually
29:58
which is quite nice and she found this
29:59
study uh it was by a guy called dan
30:01
leopard and he's an ent specialist at
30:04
the university hospital of wales and he
30:06
wanted to see how long it took
30:09
for people at home dan is inserting
30:12
candy into his nose i'm being put off
30:14
here um no that he studied five
30:16
different popular sweets favored by
30:18
children and saw how long it took to
30:20
dissolve in the nose and the idea is he
30:22
put them up his own nose and the idea is
30:24
that when children get things stuck up
30:26
their noses it's kind of hard to get it
30:28
out and it's quite
30:29
you know not very nice thing but he
30:30
thought if they dissolve quickly then
30:32
maybe you don't have to go through that
30:33
whole thing you just let nature do its
30:35
thing so actually it's quite an
30:37
important study even though it's a bit
30:38
dumb i like that that sounds like going
30:40
over there
30:41
everything smells great
30:45
actually it's uh it's actually quite um
30:48
like i know that's not the point of it
30:50
but actually it's it's making my nose
30:52
feel like i'm getting more air okay so
30:54
other sweets uh skittles take 37.5
30:57
minutes to dissolve in your nose
30:59
smarties 32.5 and tic tacs 27.5
31:03
i'm now extremely skeptical about this
31:05
study because one of my friends is here
31:07
who stuck a sour skittle up her nose
31:11
once on a date
31:13
not for a day actually just for fun i
31:14
think um and apparently it was extremely
31:17
painful started exploding in her nose
31:19
she tried to like push it out and it
31:20
ended up in her eye socket
31:25
all the weird sour acid was streaming
31:27
out of her nose and like bits of her eye
31:29
socket were falling out of her face and
31:31
stuff and she managed to get to a e i
31:33
think which implies that it does take
31:35
longer than that maybe sour skittles
31:37
have a different dessert might be right
31:38
i don't think this is really important
31:40
to say at this point but don't try this
31:42
at home
31:42
[Laughter]
31:43
although quick update it feels smaller
31:47
and actually i can feel it tight it's
31:49
smaller yeah so about polos do you know
31:52
that if you snap a polo in open in the
31:54
dark then it glows i didn't know this
31:57
and i couldn't try it at home because it
31:58
was daytime when i read this but um and
32:01
nobody knows why so it's this thing
32:02
called triboluminescence uh that if you
32:04
turn all the lights out snap a polo it
32:06
uh they think it's about electrons
32:07
suddenly rushing to a certain point of
32:10
the polo and
32:11
it happens with polos it also happens
32:13
with sellotape if you whip sellotape off
32:15
its roll really fast in the dark then it
32:17
will glow at the point where it's being
32:19
whipped off and it also emits x-rays and
32:21
they did an experiment last year where
32:24
they managed to get an x-ray of a
32:26
researcher's finger by just the x-rays
32:29
emitted by cellotape petersburg
32:31
sellotape and he managed to get an x-ray
32:33
through that off his own finger blimey
32:35
how cool is that
32:36
yeah very cool so when you go to
32:38
hospital in future they'll just have a
32:39
massive role of sellotape
32:41
just stand in front of the cello
32:45
i have something about uh smelling
32:46
things and i know this yeah so uh when
32:49
people who are asthmatic smell something
32:51
that they think is going to cause them
32:52
an allergic reaction they will have an
32:55
allergic reaction even if the thing
32:56
they're smelling doesn't cause an
32:58
allergic reaction right yeah and it's
33:00
because you from when you smell
33:02
something it goes to your brain before
33:03
it goes to your lungs as it were the
33:05
signals of what you smelled and they
33:07
they tested 17 asthmatics uh exposing
33:10
them to a rose smelling chemical for a
33:11
quarter of an hour and nine of them were
33:13
told it was it would irritate their uh
33:15
asthma and the rest were told they would
33:17
calm them down and that's exactly what
33:18
happened even though it was the same
33:20
stuff
33:21
how cool is that yeah
33:23
[Laughter]
33:36
it's the opposite of that
33:39
it isn't the mind but the mind is also a
33:41
real thing basically
33:43
in some people yeah
33:46
there's they have um my another one of
33:48
my friends is a pediatric nurse and she
33:50
recently changed hospitals and as part
33:52
of the showing her around the new walk
33:53
she works in a e part of showing her on
33:55
the new ward they were like and this is
33:56
where we keep the metal detector and
33:57
they have now in a lot of pediatric a e
34:00
wards metal detectors because it's a
34:01
much easier way and less expensive way
34:02
than an x-ray of if a kid comes in and
34:04
says i've eaten like 17 marbles not
34:07
marbles things made of metal
34:09
that's for the barbie
34:11
detector
34:13
you just go down their body oh that's
34:15
clever because this in this paper of the
34:17
polo thing they did say that if a child
34:20
states they have inserted a sweet into
34:21
their nose and it cannot be visualized
34:24
one must believe that there is indeed a
34:25
sweet and not an inorganic or corrosive
34:28
object in other words you have to trust
34:29
a kid otherwise if he says it's a sweet
34:32
and actually it's something bad yeah but
34:34
i also want to know what these mystery
34:35
sweets are that no one can visualize
34:37
well when they're in your nose this kind
34:38
of sweet before
34:41
can you describe it no
34:46
so um i i read a report that there was
34:50
originally we thought that the nose had
34:52
about 10 000
34:54
uh ways of smelling we could smell 10
34:56
000 different things and that recently
34:58
they they looked into it again and like
34:59
oh we got the number a bit wrong it's
35:01
actually a trillion
35:05
bit of a description we've got board
35:07
counting
35:09
at the moment all of us accept mike
35:14
how do how can we how can we know that
35:15
it seems like such a high number i have
35:17
no idea okay i have no idea dan can only
35:20
smell mint at the moment
35:22
uh second update definitely getting
35:23
smaller
35:24
wondering if it might just fall out on
35:26
its own accord
35:27
[Laughter]
35:28
stay tuned um
35:30
all right so but i i was so it got me uh
35:33
thinking about how because i've always
35:35
thought like you know you they test
35:37
people for how good their hearing is and
35:40
an eyesight you can see
35:42
quite well and i thought smell that must
35:43
be we must have humans who have amazing
35:45
smell yeah and there's a guy actually
35:47
who his job and it's one of the most
35:49
important jobs in the world i think uh
35:51
this is his job title he's nasa's
35:53
sniffer
35:55
right okay nasa has a sniffer who smells
35:58
everything before it goes into space
36:00
this is how powerful his nostrils are if
36:02
he doesn't like the smell it doesn't go
36:05
literally his nostrils are the gateway
36:06
to
36:07
planet activity because because uh if
36:10
you put something up into the
36:10
international space station and it
36:12
starts to smell after a few months
36:14
then that can be you can't open a window
36:16
you can't open a window you can't get it
36:18
out yeah so his nose has the ability to
36:20
smell the tiniest of smells so he can
36:22
see if that smell exists and if it's
36:23
there
36:24
it can then eventually uh turn into
36:27
something bigger but so his job he's
36:28
tested every four months to see with
36:31
with a bunch of tiny little test tubes
36:33
and one some of them have no smell and
36:35
some have the tiniest amount and if he
36:36
fails he loses his job and he still has
36:38
a job he's got the best nostrils on
36:41
earth do you think he can smell all
36:42
trillion things in the world
36:44
yeah
36:45
i just don't know how you i mean maybe
36:47
they can try very very similar things
36:49
and you can tell the difference between
36:50
them i have some things about um things
36:52
that get stuck up the rectum oh god
36:55
which dan you're lucky this wasn't my
36:57
actual fact otherwise
37:00
that would have been a very different
37:01
experiment
37:02
um in the 1995 ig nobel prize in
37:05
literature was given to two surgeons who
37:08
made a study called rectal foreign
37:09
bodies case reports and a comprehensive
37:12
review of the world's literature
37:14
and here are some of the things that
37:15
they found that people would put up
37:16
their bottoms i might i'll stop halfway
37:19
through this i think when it gets too
37:20
much but seven light bulbs a knife
37:23
sharpener two flashlights a wire spring
37:26
a snuffbox was the second flashlight to
37:28
try and find the first
37:33
we've just got dozens up there now this
37:36
is not the same
37:39
he's a different rector so um 11 11
37:42
different forms of fruits vegetables and
37:44
other food stuff a jeweler's saw
37:47
a frozen pig's tail
37:50
and then one patient's remarkable
37:51
ensemble collection including spectacles
37:54
a suitcase key a tobacco pouch and a
37:57
magazine
37:59
a magazine if you forget your handbag
38:04
it does sound like he was going on a
38:06
journey
38:07
he's got everything he needs
38:09
mike where's your bag i don't need a bag
38:12
why does he need a suitcase key if his
38:14
rectum is acting as his suitcase
38:18
[Laughter]
38:22
wouldn't that be the best day of your
38:23
life if you're one of those immigration
38:25
officers who puts the glove on and heads
38:26
in to fight some drugs
38:28
it's like
38:29
mary poppins
38:32
that's no version of mary poppins i've
38:34
seen
38:36
goodness me um we're gonna have to wrap
38:37
up very oh no very quickly james give us
38:40
more what have you got okay um one way
38:42
that you could get out of being in the
38:44
army was to pretend that you had polyps
38:46
of the nose
38:47
and this is like a little tumor inside
38:49
your nose and if you had it you wouldn't
38:50
get in the army and so people pretended
38:53
and here's a quote attempts have been
38:55
made to simulate this effect
38:57
affection of the nose by inducing by
39:00
introducing the testes of a
39:02
or the kidneys of a rabbit into the
39:04
nostril and retaining them there by
39:06
means of a small piece of sponge which
39:08
is sometimes impregnated with fetid
39:10
juices
39:12
but if it's that old war
39:14
you know i'll fight in the war
39:18
frontline murray i'm not a violent man
39:20
but i'll take the wall please
39:22
uh and another thing um i uh we talked
39:25
about the ignoble prizes before and
39:27
we're currently doing a bit of a tour
39:29
with mark aren't we mark abrahams who's
39:30
in charge of those and so i asked him
39:32
about this and he sent me a paper um
39:35
from the journal of medical hypotheses
39:37
called ejaculation as a potential
39:39
treatment of nasal congestion in mature
39:42
males
39:44
where are you ejaculating
39:47
well apparently um
39:52
according to the abstract its emission
39:54
phase provides vasoconstriction and
39:56
nasal decongestion
39:58
which i must say i've never noticed
40:00
myself
40:02
your nose clears up when you're having
40:04
sex and that's what this is saying yeah
40:06
you do have erectile tissue in your nose
40:08
so maybe it's that speak for yourself
40:11
i have a normal nose
40:13
maybe this but adolescence listening
40:15
that's good excuse for when the mum
40:17
walks in i think i would just had a
40:18
blocked up nose
40:20
we've already established that andy's
40:22
mom is here tonight
40:25
it's like i have a blocked up nose oh
40:26
that's what all the tissues are for
40:31
um okay we're gonna have to wrap up uh
40:33
should we quickly find out
40:35
how my polo is doing in my nose all
40:38
right so oh my god
40:41
talk amongst yourselves
40:42
it's still here it's still massive
40:44
ugh
40:53
okay
40:55
that's all of our facts thanks so much
40:56
for listening everyone uh if you want to
40:58
find out more about the things that
41:00
we've said over the course of this
41:01
podcast you can get us all on our
41:03
twitter handles i'm on at schreiberland

=54
00:00
[Music]
00:03
oh
00:10
[Applause]
00:19
hello
00:20
and welcome to another episode of no
00:24
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:26
this week coming to you from the soho
00:28
theater in central london my name is dan
00:30
schreiber i'm sitting here with james
00:32
harkin andy murray and anna chazinski
00:34
and once again we have gathered around
00:35
the microphones with our four favorite
00:37
facts from the last seven days and in no
00:39
particular order here we go starting
00:42
with you andy murray
00:44
my fact this week is that when you have
00:46
a tattoo lasered off you end up pooing
00:48
it out
00:54
so what happens
00:56
does it does it still have the same
00:58
design
01:00
so yeah this is this happens so when you
01:03
have a tattoo it goes into the middle
01:04
layer of the skin which is called the
01:05
dermis and um
01:07
when it's lasered off um the the beams
01:10
of light they heat up the ink and it
01:11
breaks down into tiny particles and
01:13
those go into the bloodstream and then
01:15
they are excreted via the liver and the
01:17
digestive system and that's how they get
01:19
out of you um oh i just think that's
01:22
that's amazing yeah i mean that says
01:24
something about how little you want the
01:25
tattoo anymore doesn't it
01:27
it's a statement so do you know what
01:28
tattoos are made out of like the ink do
01:30
you know where that comes from
01:32
okay well um there was a lady on
01:34
facebook who got a tattoo of vegan on
01:37
her inner lip
01:38
and then her friends pointed out that
01:40
actually most black ink of tattoos is
01:42
made from burnt animal bones
01:44
[Laughter]
01:46
oh
01:47
god she's going to see that every time
01:49
she looks in the mirror every time she
01:50
eats anything she's going to get a
01:52
little oh that's
01:55
yeah you can get vegan tattoos but
01:57
they're very rare indeed right yeah the
02:00
oldest tattoo we know of is on a lip
02:02
isn't it it's a tattoo of a thin pencil
02:04
moustache
02:05
[Laughter]
02:06
tattooed onto the upper lip of a 7 000
02:10
year old mummy from chili wow
02:13
what like a little french kind of i'm
02:15
not sure if it has the gap down the
02:17
middle that a pencil moustache is
02:18
supposed to have but i didn't do they
02:20
have to have a gap down there don't they
02:22
no
02:23
yeah all right yeah
02:25
think of someone who's never been able
02:27
to grow a moustache
02:28
i don't know dan
02:30
um
02:32
yeah my grandmother has tattooed
02:33
eyebrows
02:37
does she like permanently look surprised
02:40
um i don't know where her original
02:42
eyebrows went though that's what i don't
02:44
know did she poo them out
02:45
[Laughter]
02:48
i do think you're gonna say your
02:48
grandmother had a thin pencil moustache
02:51
kind of a cruel thing to share yeah
02:53
so the thing on tattoos being quite uh
02:55
sort of the stereotype of them being for
02:57
for sailors or for criminals or whatever
03:00
it is um the headline tattoos are not
03:02
just for sailors anymore has appeared in
03:04
print every decade since the mid-19th
03:06
century every every decade there's a
03:09
rash of articles saying they've entered
03:11
the mainstream here they are so today
03:13
more teachers have them they're members
03:14
of the armed forces really yeah by 14 to
03:17
9 but it used to be like 90 percent of
03:20
sailors had tattoos wasn't it something
03:21
like that in the 19th century probably
03:23
like yeah and um one thing that it was
03:26
good for was it meant that you could um
03:27
identify a sailor who had drowned
03:29
because you'd be able to identify them
03:31
by the tattoos and they were actually
03:33
used in that way
03:35
so you could tell that he he had a
03:36
tattoo that said i have drowned
03:39
[Laughter]
03:41
he gets that he has a lot of tattoos the
03:42
first one says help second one
03:48
and the other thing that they thought
03:49
the sailors is if you had hold tattooed
03:51
on your knuckles on one hand and fast on
03:54
the other hand then it would help you
03:55
hold on to ropes better one way you
03:58
could stop drowning as a sailor
03:59
apparently was to have a pig tattooed on
04:02
your knee and then a
04:04
as in a rooster tattooed on your right
04:06
leg somewhere and they had a saying that
04:07
was pig on the knee safety at sea a
04:09
on the right never lose a fight
04:11
um which is weird neither those animals
04:13
can swim
04:14
yeah yeah fight very well speaking of um
04:17
and tattoos oh god um
04:21
sometimes sometimes when i want to find
04:23
out some facts for this show i'll go
04:25
back to the old qi talk boards and see
04:27
what i wrote in the past and i searched
04:29
for tattoos and i found something that
04:31
dan posted in 2005. really and this is
04:33
what he said he said i was told today
04:36
that if a man was to have a tattoo done
04:38
on his penis then he was entitled to
04:41
free tattoos for the rest of his life
04:43
from anywhere in the world in any tattoo
04:45
palace
04:47
no questions asked
04:50
this is what used to pass for qi
04:52
research back in the day
04:54
so i have a confession uh
04:56
it's not just my grandmother with a
04:57
tattoo um well i had a look and there
05:00
are one or two tattoo parlors that will
05:02
claim that they will do that whether
05:04
they will or not i don't know but it's
05:05
not everyone in the world all the time
05:07
it's a very difficult thing at google by
05:08
the way um it's very easy to google it's
05:11
very difficult to forget
05:15
i shouldn't have gotten google images
05:16
really today um but i found a story
05:19
about a 21 year old from iran who paid a
05:21
tattoo artist to put the letter m for
05:23
his girlfriend's last name and the
05:25
persian phrase for good luck with your
05:27
journeys on his penis
05:30
and he felt pain for eight days and then
05:33
his uh his penis became permanently
05:35
semi-erect so he couldn't get it to go
05:37
down he lived with it for three months
05:38
before getting medical help and doctors
05:41
tried shunting the penis to drain excess
05:44
blood i'm not sure what she's doing
05:48
and then it didn't work and so the
05:49
patient decided he was fine with the
05:51
condition and declined further treatment
05:54
wow
05:56
wow
05:58
at the turn of the so they were quite a
06:00
high society thing weren't they in the
06:01
19th century and at the turn so um in
06:04
about 1900 a new york newspaper
06:07
estimated that 75
06:09
of society ladies in new york had
06:11
tattoos 75
06:13
yep but what kind what kind of tattoos
06:15
like practical ones or
06:18
practical tattoos yeah i'm gonna i'm
06:20
backing away from that no no no no you
06:22
do don't back away step up okay you get
06:24
you get medical tattoos and we get some
06:26
of the oldest tattoos ever yeah which
06:28
are 5 000 years old the 3000 bc we found
06:31
bodies where there's a body in the alps
06:32
which has tattoos over his joints and
06:35
they looked at the skeleton and he had
06:36
osteoarthritis in those joints so it's
06:38
like a kind of um this is the iceman in
06:41
fact
06:42
yeah yeah that's what i meant by it
06:44
actually because the mercury astronauts
06:46
apparently as well yeah no no but i i
06:49
looked into whether or not astronauts
06:51
had any tattoos because i just thought
06:52
that they seemed like the type of people
06:54
that would and majority
06:58
i feel like i'm saying a lot of things
06:59
that
07:00
it's just me agreeing with
07:03
uh mercury astronauts uh they would have
07:05
them uh in just like sensor locations
07:07
basically for whenever they had to
07:09
monitor their health so they knew where
07:11
they were they would kind of like
07:12
putting a bit of tape on the ground
07:13
there's a mark for an actor yeah there
07:16
was a guy who was arrested by canada's
07:18
border services agency um with the
07:20
letters h-a-t-e on his knuckles and he
07:23
claimed that it stood for happiness all
07:25
through eternity
07:31
that's very good quick thinker um one
07:33
woman used an internet translation to um
07:36
translate i love david into hebrew
07:39
she later discovered she inadvertently
07:41
had the phrase babylon is the world's
07:43
leading dictionary and translation
07:45
software
07:47
on her back
07:48
forever
07:55
but she doesn't have a free account with
07:56
babylon forever so
08:00
david beckham has victoria beckham's
08:02
name miss spelt tattooed onto his body
08:04
in hindi yeah oh dear and samantha
08:07
cameron has a tattoo does she yeah she's
08:10
cooler than all of us
08:12
hello dan's grandmother sorry
08:15
yeah is it a practical tattoo
08:18
it's a dolphin on her ankle is that
08:20
practical that's practical no that's
08:22
cool why did she was that just a holiday
08:24
that she took once or
08:26
so
08:28
to a dolphinarium no just you go on
08:30
holiday you get a tattoo oh no i don't
08:32
meant as like oh is anyone got a camera
08:34
no okay quick tattoo that dolphin so i
08:36
can
08:37
live this memory forever
08:40
yeah sorry
08:42
there's an american guy who has over a
08:45
thousand tattoos based on disney
08:47
characters including all 101 of 101
08:49
dalmatians
08:49
[Laughter]
08:51
which i don't and he
09:01
you know the area of a body by a
09:03
thousand it's not much room you've got
09:04
yeah so i mean i think it is to scale
09:06
but it is scaled down um and he has a
09:09
system so he has all the bat all the
09:11
evil characters are below his knees and
09:13
all the undersea characters are below
09:15
his belly so i don't know but then all
09:18
the evil characters aren't under the sea
09:20
so i don't know how he worked that out
09:22
wow um anyway he's get he gets some
09:24
copyright copyrighted by disney like
09:26
disney's allowed him to do it oh really
09:28
he's the only person why is it illegal
09:30
to do a disney tattoo i think when
09:33
you've got that
09:34
what would they do make you pull it out
09:35
oh yeah
09:38
um we're gonna have to move on to our
09:39
next fact so if anyone has anything more
09:41
that they want to add
09:42
on them on mistakes in tattoos um
09:45
john kerry who's a footballer yeah
09:47
jungkook jonkeroo um he got a tattoo
09:50
saying um he wanted to say my life my
09:52
rules so he got mavi
09:55
regular um but he got the accent wrong
09:57
on regular he made he got an acute
09:59
accent instead of a grave one which
10:01
translates as my life my menstruation
10:04
[Laughter]
10:10
um okay it's time for our second fact of
10:13
the evening and that fact is jaczynski's
10:16
yeah my fact is that the man who
10:18
invented the airship used to hold dinner
10:20
parties with 10-foot high chairs so that
10:23
his guests could experience the joy of
10:25
flight
10:28
this guy is amazing brazilian guy called
10:30
alberto santos dumour and first of all
10:32
he decided to have him hanging from the
10:33
ceiling which you could understand was
10:35
more reminiscent of flight but on one of
10:37
his first dinner parties he put all his
10:38
guests hanging from the ceiling and the
10:39
ceiling collapsed so
10:43
after all
10:44
the funerals of the previous guests
10:46
weirdly no one wanted to come to the
10:47
next party and the ceiling was fine yeah
10:50
so the wake will be at mine i've
10:51
organized a nice dinner um
10:55
wow um yeah he was great he was an
10:58
inventor he grew up on a plantation in
11:01
brazil and he invented a toy motor
11:03
powered functioning airplane which was
11:05
quite a long time before the first
11:07
airplanes were invented in the late 19th
11:09
century and then he moved to paris and
11:11
became a celebrity because he invented
11:13
the airship which attracted attention
11:15
and used to yeah invite celebrities and
11:16
royalty to his house and have these
11:18
wacky dinner parties and they'd have to
11:20
mount their seats on ladders and
11:23
yeah he was so famous in his time at the
11:25
time said when the names of all those
11:27
who have occupied outstanding positions
11:29
in the world have been forgotten there
11:31
will be a name which will remain in our
11:33
memory that of santos dumont what was
11:35
the name again
11:38
he does sound like an amazing guy he
11:40
sounds unbelievable actually as in he
11:42
had his own airship in paris when no one
11:45
else had any means of flight he was just
11:47
flying around the streets of paris he
11:49
would just stop at a cafe
11:51
tether it and then go down to the cafe
11:53
then say well so you later and fly off
11:56
this is in the late 19th century early
11:58
20th century he just did it what was he
12:00
tethering to
12:02
rooftops and lamp posts and things like
12:04
that it wasn't huge when you look at
12:05
photos of it it's not a massive airship
12:07
it's not the size of the r101 over there
12:09
no it's a one-man airship i think a
12:10
personal it's unbelievable he would go
12:12
past ladies bedrooms and they would
12:14
throw their underwear out of the window
12:16
at him no that's how famous he was
12:19
yeah yeah he was also super generous so
12:22
he was responsible for the first woman
12:24
ever to take flight because there was a
12:26
princess i can't she was a princess of
12:29
some foreign country who came to visit
12:30
paris took an interest in his airship
12:32
said i wouldn't mind going up one of
12:33
those and he taught her to fly one and
12:35
then he had her flying one through the
12:37
streets of paris and he cycled below
12:39
shouting her instructions as she did
12:42
and this was the first woman to fly wow
12:44
i actually it sounds way worse to think
12:46
of men throwing their underwear at her
12:48
yeah
12:52
he invented other things as well i know
12:54
the 10 foot chair no one talks about it
12:56
no one mentions the 10 foot chair we've
12:58
all got one um no he invented a set of
13:00
motorized skis to get him back up and
13:02
mounted
13:03
really and he invented a slingshot which
13:05
would throw life belts out from sinking
13:07
ships so that everyone could have a
13:08
lifebelt he also invented a racing guy
13:10
ship which was similar to his airship
13:12
but he never raced it because he had no
13:13
one to race
13:16
against so
13:19
he sad
13:19
have just made two couldn't he
13:21
yeah can i can i bring it to dinner
13:23
parties very quickly i just want to talk
13:24
about my favorite dinner party host uh
13:26
from history which is william buckland
13:28
he's a very exciting character he um he
13:31
studied fossils and he was a geologist
13:33
um but he also went on this massive
13:35
mission to eat every single thing in the
13:37
animal kingdom he was just like i need
13:39
to have everything his favorite so if
13:40
you went to his house for dinner you
13:41
would end up having things like
13:42
elephants trunk or mice on toast was his
13:44
favorite thing
13:46
and he knew he knew food so like he knew
13:48
animal food everything about them so
13:50
well that he was once invited uh to go
13:52
to this church where they thought a
13:54
saint's blood was on the ground of this
13:56
church and he came over there and he had
13:58
a look at it he was like because it was
14:00
just this patch on the ground of the
14:01
hearts the saints blood he leaned down
14:03
he licked it and he came back up and
14:05
went now it's bat urine
14:08
he just knew but also the worst guest to
14:10
have at a dinner party in that respect
14:12
because he went to this party which was
14:13
lord harcourt he's the archbishop of
14:15
york and at the dinner harcourt was like
14:18
i've got this amazing relic that i want
14:19
to show you all he brought out what was
14:21
the heart of louis the 16th in a box and
14:24
within seconds buckland just grabbed it
14:26
and he ate it
14:27
but you say worse than a guest ever very
14:28
few dinner hosts bring the heart of a
14:31
dead king
14:33
to the table i would say worst dinner
14:35
host ever okay here's another dinner
14:36
party thing they were christening of
14:38
louis the
14:39
14th grandson i created a cake sorry
14:43
there was a great um a great uh chef
14:45
called antoine karem who created a cake
14:48
and the cake was made out of almond
14:50
paste pastry and clockwork
14:52
and i love clockwork i love it so much
14:54
and it's so hard to get these days
14:57
in pastries yeah every greg's i go into
15:01
and they had clockwork because this cake
15:03
on top of it had a baby duke entering
15:06
the world through a marzipan
15:10
vagina that is quite a centerpiece isn't
15:14
it
15:15
so it was it sorry it was him it was
15:17
celebrating him a child it was a model
15:19
of his mother giving birth to him yes
15:22
through marzipan with clockwork
15:25
don't get like greg's do you no no
15:28
wow i was i was reading that back in the
15:29
day when furniture was just suddenly
15:31
being introduced to the idea of us
15:34
having it in our homes and stuff
15:36
wait wait i know it's nice
15:39
when furniture was being introduced to
15:41
the idea
15:43
of having it
15:44
in our arms it was quite a shock for
15:46
furniture it wasn't domesticated until
15:48
the 1500s
15:50
the beautiful days when you know
15:52
freestanding chases would just roam the
15:54
belt
15:55
[Laughter]
15:58
[Music]
16:00
chair these days
16:03
there are only four hundred louis tables
16:05
left in the wild
16:10
sorry sorry i know that was my fact
16:14
no they apparently when we when we
16:16
started introducing photo shirts we like
16:18
cupboards would just be put in the
16:19
middle of the room as opposed to against
16:21
the wall now and dinner tables we didn't
16:24
used to have legs to dinner tables you
16:26
would have people come and sit if you
16:28
were having a party there would be a big
16:29
board like this that you would bring out
16:31
and you would put it on your legs so
16:33
they'd just be sat on your legs and
16:35
that's why apparently there were boards
16:36
and you would be a border and apparently
16:37
borders who stay in your house that's
16:38
why they're called borders because you
16:40
would they would be part of the legs
16:42
that would hold the table up hold the
16:44
table up yeah you hold the table up with
16:45
your legs i read this in bill bryson's
16:47
book at home and he used to say that
16:48
carpets um before we used to walk on
16:50
them you just have them on your wall and
16:52
you go it's my carpet
16:54
and if you had a special guest and you
16:56
take it down from the wall and you'd put
16:57
it for them to walk on and and chairs
16:59
used to be against the walls you would
17:01
have chairs against the walls because at
17:03
night when you didn't have electricity
17:04
you would not trip over stuff in the
17:06
middle of your room but if you had
17:07
chairs all over the shop then you might
17:08
hurt yourself where are you going
17:12
you should be asleep they would get up
17:14
halfway through the night wouldn't they
17:15
because people used to sleep in two two
17:17
different sections and then get up and
17:19
have sex or
17:21
do the crosstalk very confident
17:23
[Laughter]
17:27
um oh we're gonna have to move on um
17:30
should we move on has anyone got
17:31
anything else
17:32
i quite like the inactivity chair which
17:34
has recently been invented which is a
17:36
chair with only two legs
17:38
and it is basically so that you live in
17:40
fear while you sit on it and
17:43
have to constantly be doing a balancing
17:45
act
17:46
and i think the idea is that you can
17:47
exercise while also being seated but it
17:49
sounds awful anyway invest in one if
17:52
you're looking to improve your health i
17:52
always think i'm not afraid enough when
17:54
i'm sitting down
17:55
[Music]
17:59
um okay time for fact number three that
18:01
is my fact my fact this week is that a
18:04
new scientific study has concluded that
18:07
there are too many scientific studies
18:10
[Laughter]
18:12
it's basically the study was saying that
18:14
it's doing a thing now where so many
18:15
studies are coming out in science that
18:17
it's diminishing the attention that gets
18:20
um given to an actual good study because
18:23
it's it's drawing headlines away from
18:25
them and and studies are going so sort
18:27
of minute into these little i don't know
18:29
like
18:30
there's there's great ones that we've
18:32
read in the past uh that we've talked
18:33
about in the office and stuff a study
18:35
that showed that the fish herring that
18:37
they fart
18:38
to communicate with each other that's
18:40
how they talk and that's a study and
18:41
that might get in the way of say yeah
18:43
but that that could be a good study
18:45
because like you might want to know if
18:47
there's a low so in i think it was in
18:49
scandinavia somewhere they heard a load
18:51
of like bubbles underneath the sea and
18:53
they thought it might have been like a
18:55
russian submarine or something like that
18:56
but it turned out to be herring's
18:58
communicating by farting to each other
19:00
and if you hadn't done the study you
19:01
wouldn't know that that was a thing
19:03
so probably saved world war russia
19:07
okay so that's a bad example right
19:09
there are lots of studies that are uh
19:11
that seem to be taking attention away
19:13
yeah so it's the idea that we forget as
19:15
well yes so we might have sold we might
19:16
have cracked everything five years ago
19:18
but just not noticed at the time and now
19:20
we're carrying on and on with more
19:22
studies
19:22
and we do so do some irrelevance not we
19:25
personally but the royal society of
19:27
chemistry last year published 11 steps
19:29
on how to make the perfect cup of tea
19:31
which definitively determined after
19:34
releasing this paper that you are
19:35
supposed to put the milk in first to
19:38
avoid denaturation of the milk we
19:41
actually have big arguments in the q.i
19:42
office about how to make seedlings and i
19:45
can sense a lot of angry
19:47
oh my god that was the most british
19:49
thing ever
19:50
that was a there was a palpable it
19:52
wasn't a hiss but it was it was a it was
19:55
an intake of breath isn't it
19:57
i think we all felt that
20:00
so i'm i am with the breath intake
20:02
because i obviously think it was a
20:03
travesty to suggest you put the milk in
20:05
first but that is what they say that's
20:06
the safer way to do it um it's also
20:08
explained in this study safer
20:10
[Music]
20:11
three more tea deaths in wolfenstein
20:15
so the single most downloaded uh paper
20:18
in the history of the journal uh is it
20:19
plos medicine plos is the 2005 paper why
20:23
most published research findings are
20:25
false
20:27
it's quite good isn't it
20:28
so there's a guy who's written a lot of
20:30
studies about falsehoods in science and
20:32
his name is john yeo anidis and as a boy
20:35
he was already doing research on
20:37
research as it were he's doing meta
20:39
research and when he was a child he came
20:41
up with a love numbers system to work
20:44
out how affectionate he was about his
20:45
own family
20:46
he said my mother was getting a thousand
20:48
and twenty four point four two my
20:50
grandmother 173.73
20:54
yeah he said basically that all the
20:56
statistics in all these papers are a bit
20:58
dubious etc but then a lot of people
21:00
have said actually his statistics are a
21:01
bit dubious as well so
21:03
yeah all right controversial yeah um it
21:06
is certainly sorry
21:08
oh it was i assume he was talking about
21:10
like um
21:12
publication bias or so the publication
21:14
advice is a major problem in scientific
21:17
studies isn't it because only positive
21:18
results tend to be published and about
21:20
90 of
21:21
studies that are done actually yield
21:23
negative results which aren't as
21:24
headline grabbing and there are journals
21:26
now which are like the journal of
21:27
negative results which is just people
21:28
who have done experiments and gone we
21:30
found nothing
21:31
[Laughter]
21:33
nothing has been achieved here
21:37
and there's also a guy called mark
21:38
schreim at harvard who wanted to see how
21:40
easy it would be to get something
21:42
published and so he published an article
21:44
and he made one up using
21:46
randomtextgenerator.com
21:48
and the article was called cuckoo for
21:50
coco puffs
21:52
and it was by pinkerton a la brain and
21:55
orson welles
21:58
uh and he submitted it to 37 journals
22:00
over two weeks and it was accepted by 17
22:03
of them wow wow
22:06
pinkerton a la brave
22:09
it's a nominative determinism isn't it
22:11
because you know you have a name like la
22:12
brain you're going to be a scientist
22:15
there's a journal called brain isn't
22:16
that do you remember that
22:18
there's a journal called brain and
22:19
there's a guy who used to be the head of
22:21
brain who was cold head
22:24
henry head it was and then he left brain
22:26
and then when he left being the head of
22:29
brain head was replaced as a head of
22:30
brain by a guy called brain
22:32
[Music]
22:34
um does that mean there's a website
22:36
called retraction watch which is fun
22:38
because they pay attention to uh people
22:41
quietly retracting their research when
22:42
it turns out to be wrong oh wow and um
22:45
that is fun yeah it was set up by these
22:47
two uh journalists called ivan orrensky
22:49
and adam marcus and they're absolute
22:51
heroes and um the top one or two
22:54
retraction holders are both uh
22:55
anesthesiologists for what it's worth uh
22:57
and there is one scientist in japan
23:00
who has had to retract uh 183 papers out
23:03
of 212.
23:06
wow
23:10
but his name is captain awesome so they
23:12
assume
23:13
it must be right
23:15
yeah so i went on to
23:17
dailymail.com.uk and searched for
23:19
according to a recent study
23:21
just to see
23:22
if there were too many really
23:25
and here were the first five things i
23:27
found um
23:29
even sharks could be shy according to a
23:31
new study
23:33
we have covered on the podcast that
23:34
sharks can have friends so
23:36
let's not uh
23:38
it's not going to be a shy shirt um
23:40
study reveals the tactics we use to
23:42
avoid being head on the loo oh
23:45
that's great what
23:46
any any
23:48
any any
23:54
another one was bump in the night
23:56
sending the wife one in five men pretend
23:58
to be asleep when hearing a possible
24:00
intruder according to a recent
24:04
fortunately fortunately it's almost
24:06
always furniture
24:09
they haven't placed safely by the wall
24:13
um we're gonna have to move on okay one
24:15
more thing i looked at other things that
24:18
there's too many of yeah and there was a
24:20
study done uh that said
24:22
it said three quarters of viewers of
24:24
television have cited confusion over the
24:26
proliferation of choice as the reason
24:29
they miss shows as in the so many
24:31
channels they always miss tv shows okay
24:33
they're just flicking desperately
24:34
between them yeah they can't find the
24:36
right one uh so i had a look at all the
24:38
different channels on my um on my tv
24:40
system on sky uh and i found one which
24:43
i'd never seen before it's pavershoes.tv
24:47
and it's sky channel 669
24:50
and their programs include sensational
24:53
sandals
24:55
pretty in pumps
24:56
and classic clogs
25:00
sounds like the best shuttle ever you
25:02
know eyes on this sounds great
25:04
that's 669.
25:07
uh but in the uk is 667
25:11
it's a shoe size joke
25:16
[Applause]
25:18
all right we're gonna have to move on to
25:19
our final fact
25:23
how did the shoe material go
25:29
time for a final fact of the evening and
25:31
that is james okay my fact is that you
25:34
should never pick up a desert tart ice
25:37
if you do it can pee itself to death
25:44
yes so what they do is they store urine
25:46
in their bladder which they can then
25:47
draw upon because they live in the
25:49
desert so they need as much water as
25:50
they can get and if you pick them up
25:52
they can get so scared that they will
25:54
evacuate their bladder as in wet
25:56
themselves and then they can die of
25:58
dehydration station
26:00
because they keep um something like 40
26:02
percent of their body mass is kept as
26:04
the urine that then translates into a
26:06
sort of like rehydrated water not
26:09
it's really really diluted i think yeah
26:10
so it's not too uh acidic or you know it
26:13
doesn't damage them yeah but it's just a
26:15
way that something can live in the
26:16
desert but obviously then they don't
26:18
expect people to just come and pick them
26:19
up and then
26:20
and then they die but yeah um desert
26:23
tortoises pretty cool and they live
26:24
around the las vegas area around nevada
26:27
around there um they dig basins to catch
26:30
rain water into the way they get water
26:32
and they always know where they are and
26:34
whenever it looks like it's gonna rain
26:35
they're always found next to these
26:37
places that they've dug waiting for the
26:38
water to come so they can immediately
26:40
drink it and weirdly this is really
26:42
strange humans um are
26:45
not so likely to die when they're in the
26:47
you know children or teenagers or
26:49
whatever and you get more likely to die
26:51
as you get older but weirdly desert
26:53
tortoises they uh i'm less likely to die
26:56
as the time goes on the older they get
26:58
the less likely they are yeah yeah so
26:59
that's why they live for so long and
27:00
that's like tosses do live for a long
27:02
time yeah and that's true
27:05
one was so old i read this in um
27:07
uh and apparently there's a bit of
27:09
contention about whether or not this is
27:11
true or not but one of diary
27:12
[Laughter]
27:15
i'm ready what we'll do is we'll cut
27:16
that out and put it at the start of
27:18
everything
27:20
basically there was a tortoise called
27:21
harriet which belonged to charles darwin
27:23
so the the contentious bit is did that
27:25
belong to charles darwin they're not
27:26
fully sure but harriet had a bit of a
27:29
travelled life after darwin or whoever
27:30
got her ended up in australia zoo and
27:33
ended up being looked after by steve
27:34
irwin
27:36
so steve irwin and charles darwin are
27:38
connected within one lifetime wow yeah
27:41
that was really cool there was a
27:42
tortoise called uh
27:45
there was a tortoise called adwaita who
27:47
lived to the age of 255
27:50
and that meant that this tortoise was
27:51
born before the usa existed
27:54
and their death was announced on cnn
27:57
wow
27:58
so there's some quite good footage of a
28:00
taught assistant of each other's bums
28:01
like dogs because they secrete
28:03
pheromones from like the cloaca or from
28:05
that area and there's quite good footage
28:08
of a
28:09
uh female tortoise crawling over a
28:11
lettuce and then secreting her scent as
28:14
she goes and then a male tortoise really
28:15
enthusiastically trying to have sex with
28:17
the lettuce because
28:19
i see wow
28:22
lettuce was used to they did think it
28:23
was an aphrodisiac didn't they in
28:25
ancient egypt they didn't
28:27
people did yeah
28:29
it's because it they used to grow quite
28:31
tall they used to have wild lettuce
28:32
which was really tall and it wasn't like
28:34
a normal boring modern lettuce it was
28:36
quite exciting and it secreted a white
28:38
sap it secreted a white sap and it
28:40
tasted peppery and it was yeah
28:42
and it was it was a stem and it's
28:44
secreting you know letters used to be
28:45
better yeah
28:48
um apparently tortoises can use
28:50
touchscreen technology now
28:52
they can touch touch things
28:54
no so so uh they because no because they
28:56
found they found that tortoises are
28:57
actually a lot more clever than they
28:59
believe them to be originally for
29:00
example in mazes they're fantastic in
29:02
mazes they can remember multiple
29:04
destinations in one single route which
29:06
often rats can't do and now they're
29:08
teaching them to use touchscreen
29:09
technology to
29:13
to create spotify lists of great music
29:16
um
29:18
because they've got great tastes of
29:19
music which um
29:20
captain awesome published in his recent
29:22
paper uh
29:24
i've seen the retraction list i don't
29:25
know if it wasn't that but he uh so if
29:27
they need more food um and they give
29:30
them grapes and apples and stuff they
29:31
they press the right button that
29:33
highlights itself
29:34
they go into a cardo
29:36
and just
29:37
more letters more letters more letters
29:41
oh by the way apparently so i've always
29:44
been confused between what a tortoise
29:45
and a turtle is oh yeah and so i'm just
29:47
gonna say in case everyone here doesn't
29:49
know the difference but a tortoise has
29:51
feet and a turtle has flippers okay so
29:55
now we know that's a very good wave and
29:58
so i thought they should have been
29:59
called ninja tortoises because they have
30:01
feet oh yeah oh yeah
30:05
dad i think you've redeemed yourself
30:12
what was amazing about that was it took
30:14
ages for everyone to go that wasn't as
30:16
dumb as it
30:18
definitely sounded
30:20
so on uh on ways of uh staying hydrated
30:24
in the desert where there's no water and
30:25
no rain um there are lots of very cool
30:28
ways of doing it so there are some
30:29
beetles which um when
30:32
night is just telling you today they
30:34
stand very still and they let fog
30:36
condense on their bodies and then they
30:38
can drink it because they it slowly
30:40
coalesces onto them and then they have
30:41
enough water to get them through the day
30:43
the name for these beetles is fog stand
30:46
beetles
30:48
someone thought that was the best name
30:50
on that day that they could come up with
30:52
that like every time you see animals and
30:54
their names it's always like who gave
30:56
there's a tortoise called the big headed
30:58
tortoise
31:00
like that was a very creative
31:03
well he told me he was the best artist
31:08
uh some other tata's names while we're
31:10
here the pancake taught us
31:13
uh the geometric tortoise
31:15
the impressed
31:16
tortoise who hangs around with a big
31:18
head tortoise i guess
31:23
and this guy i really like him um the
31:25
wolf volcano giants tartus
31:28
it just sounds like the four best things
31:30
yeah
31:32
yeah he's got a really good pr manager
31:36
other ways of so other desert animals
31:38
that have like good ways of storing
31:39
their water are so road runners urinate
31:41
out their eyes
31:44
like
31:46
[Music]
31:48
it's how they excrete their salt because
31:50
you use a lot uh you use up a lot of
31:52
water you lose a lot of water when you
31:53
urinate so they just lose it through
31:54
their eyes also mountain goats you've
31:56
got to be really careful now apparently
31:57
in aries the mountain goats like in
31:58
north america because they really like
32:00
human urine because they've realized
32:02
they don't have a natural salt um a
32:04
natural thing they eat that provides
32:05
them with their salt but they have
32:07
worked out that mountaineers we and that
32:09
has salt in it and so they will spot
32:11
human mountaineers and follow them until
32:14
they go to take it away and then they
32:16
will sometimes mold them and attempt to
32:20
hit drink there oh god excretion yeah
32:23
you've got to look out where do they
32:24
move no i don't want to know where they
32:27
don't turtles pee through their mouths
32:29
some species
32:30
some of them do yeah and there are some
32:32
uh the fit story river turtle breezed
32:34
through its anus oh
32:36
yep it's a really cool turtle it's
32:38
australian i think and um yeah it is
32:40
it's in the fitzroy river and it it
32:42
lives in
32:43
water which has a lot of oxygen in it
32:45
and um it's uh its cloacal orifice goes
32:48
two-thirds of the way along it and it
32:50
gets 68 of his oxygen through its bottom
32:53
wow a lot did you know that tart ice was
32:55
once the fastest animal in the world
32:58
no it wasn't
33:00
it really was but no are you talking i
33:02
can i guess what you're talking about
33:05
no is it the space thing it is the
33:06
spacing so smart okay go on you can tell
33:16
this was in 1968 and the
33:19
soviets sent out a spaceship with
33:22
from kazakhstan with a tortoise on it
33:24
and it was the first animal in deep
33:26
space and it traveled round the moon
33:28
before returning to earth seven days
33:30
later so for that short amount of time
33:31
it was the fastest animal in the world
33:33
um there were also wine flies mealworms
33:36
and a few other things but that was a
33:37
that was a main one that was the
33:38
headline grabber wasn't it the poor
33:40
mealworms going i was there too
33:44
but that was they were the first life
33:46
forms as well to get around to the moon
33:49
yeah um so your fact was about things
33:52
wetting themselves in a way and we don't
33:55
know why there's no evolutionary reason
33:57
why a lot of animals work themselves
33:58
when they're afraid and it's really
33:59
weird so gazelles wet themselves when
34:01
they're being chased by lions not very
34:02
useful well one theory is that it might
34:04
like send the lions off because they
34:06
have the scent somewhere else right i
34:08
think that's one theory don't they
34:09
surely they chase the scent until they
34:10
reach the best yeah so you pee and then
34:12
the lion will stop and go oh there's
34:14
there's a smell of gazelle p there and
34:15
then i mean that's just one theory yeah
34:17
what is with humans when you get shocked
34:19
i think is like somehow your brain gets
34:22
overridden by the shock and normally
34:24
your brain is like you always want to
34:26
pee and your brain's saying no don't pee
34:28
you're on stage
34:31
but yeah you're shocked so much that you
34:33
end up wetting yourself yeah
34:35
it's weird there's a bit of the brain
34:36
called the pontine micturition center
34:38
which is constantly saying let's go
34:40
let's do it
34:43
really yeah when your bladder is full it
34:44
makes the decision to to empty the
34:46
bladder and then but the prefrontal
34:48
cortex always overrides the desire but
34:51
when you get really really really
34:52
stressed um the limbic system overrides
34:54
the prefrontal cortex and so you the
34:56
signals get confused and then you know
34:58
it's all cold and you're ashamed but we
35:00
don't know why but it's one to start off
35:02
with
35:04
and we're gonna have to wrap up okay one
35:05
more thing
35:06
okay so there was a guy who's um taught
35:09
us had a swollen penis and he
35:12
he didn't have the money to pay for the
35:14
operation and so he went on to one of
35:16
these kickstarter style things and he
35:18
needed 200 pounds and he reached his
35:20
target in less than 24 hours
35:22
and he went over he went up to 555
35:26
pounds in the end people like really
35:28
clubbed together and paid for it and
35:30
when you um when you gave your money you
35:32
could put a little note about what you
35:33
wanted to say
35:35
uh one person said i hope he gets the
35:37
repair done soon i know what it's like
35:39
having an enlarged penis
35:46
that is not so nice
35:48
but at least he gave some money so
35:52
we hope that turtle's doing well and um
35:54
we're gonna have to wrap up uh so that's
35:56
it that's all of our facts thanks so
35:58
much for being here um if you want to
35:59

36:01
things we've said you can get us all on

[Applause]
00:22
hello
00:24
and welcome to another episode of no
00:27
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:30
this week coming to you from the soho
00:31
theater in central london my name is dan
00:33
schreiber i am sitting with james harkin
00:36
andy murray anna chazinski and once
00:38
again we have our four favorite facts
00:40
we're sat around our microphones and in
00:42
no particular order here we go starting
00:44
with you james harkin okay my fact this
00:47
week is that firefighters use wetter
00:50
water than we do
00:56
is that in everyday life as well just
00:58
cleaning their teeth and having a shower
01:00
no just for putting out fires so what do
01:03
you mean by wet water well it's just
01:05
about how weird water is really um
01:07
apparently if you put certain polymers
01:09
into water and there is less friction in
01:12
the pipe so it shoots out the pipe
01:14
quicker
01:15
so and it's called a wetting agent and
01:17
it's to make water wetter
01:21
did did someone notice that it was going
01:23
really slowly out of the pipe
01:26
how much faster does it go uh well there
01:28
is they use it in oil as well and in the
01:31
alaskan pipeline they put this stuff in
01:33
and it reduces pumping costs by up to 50
01:35
percent
01:36
because it just pumps up more it pumps
01:38
up
01:39
you don't want to mix up the oil in the
01:41
water if you're a firefighter as well
01:45
this is terrible it doesn't you can mix
01:46
oil and water isn't that the whole point
01:54
um that's it's amazing yeah so when it
01:57
the first time they used this stuff
01:59
there were puddles of it around and the
02:00
firefighters were complaining they were
02:02
slipping on the puddles
02:03
because it was so wet
02:06
quick step in one of those puddles of
02:07
water for stability
02:11
so do you know how long they've been
02:13
using it um this was i'm not sure
02:15
exactly when it came out when they found
02:16
it out but i think it was in the 60s or
02:18
70s and it was a guy called b.a thomas
02:21
and it's called the tom's effect this
02:23
thing that makes it slippier right on
02:25
supreme water no one knows why ice is
02:28
slippery do they or no one knows why so
02:30
well the reason is slippery is that
02:32
there's a tiny film of water forms on
02:34
top of water when it freezes and
02:36
scientists don't know why water does
02:38
that why this tiny film of water forms
02:40
and why it's slippery and that's just
02:42
another weird thing about water and the
02:44
other thing is that it's sticky and
02:46
slippery ice like if you put your tongue
02:48
in it you stick to it but also it's
02:49
slippery and that's just a weird thing
02:51
to happen
02:52
um just on water being wetter my dad
02:55
uses scissors that are sharper
02:58
than my scissors
03:00
what are you talking about
03:02
i was trying to i was trying to think
03:04
when when i found out this fact i was i
03:05
was just like oh what else is more than
03:07
what it's meant to be and my dad
03:09
actually my dad's a hairdresser and he
03:11
has a pair of scissors that were forged
03:14
by samurai
03:19
in japan
03:25
i'm starting to understand why you
03:26
believe all this crap about yes
03:29
your dad's been spinning you absurd lies
03:32
since you're a child
03:36
so sorry they were forcing them
03:38
they weren't no honestly he so they were
03:40
forged in the fire of some murder yeah
03:44
there are a pair of scissors that were
03:46
forged by samurai and they are the
03:49
sharpest pair of scissors that you can
03:50
buy in the world and he's had them for
03:52
35 coming up to 40 so it's in between
03:54
that bracket one day they'll be given to
03:56
you i know
03:58
no but he he's consistently as a
04:00
hairdresser you're meant to get your
04:01
scissors sharpened every few years he
04:03
goes every few years to get them
04:04
sharpened and the people at the
04:06
sharpening place go we can do nothing
04:07
for you these are as sharp as they have
04:09
ever been as they ever will be
04:13
and they were just
04:15
samurai scissors so this is a what kind
04:17
of samurai blacksmith makes scissors
04:19
blow
04:20
is it someone who's been kicked out of
04:22
the swords bit of the blacksmith
04:24
no but if you're a samurai you're not
04:26
gonna like imagine when they're clipping
04:27
their nails and stuff they probably have
04:28
samurais nail clippers probably like
04:31
if you're used to that kind of
04:33
excellence you're just gonna create
04:35
more products that are gonna help you
04:36
out right yeah that sounds implausible i
04:39
promise you everyone google it samurai
04:40
scissors existing i didn't know you had
04:42
to have your scissors sharpened every
04:43
few years as a hairdresser that
04:45
surprises me yeah oh well there's a fact
04:47
all right
04:49
that's good
04:50
um so on uh on fire oh yeah the very
04:53
earliest fire fighting organizations in
04:55
the usa they were all volunteer ones and
04:57
normally they couldn't do very much
04:58
because they didn't have much suction
05:00
through the fire hoses and uh so what
05:02
they would do instead they took one of
05:03
the most important things was called a
05:04
bed key and this was to break down a bed
05:07
frame a wooden bed frame
05:09
because that was often the most valuable
05:10
thing in a house and so they said well
05:12
we can't really do much for the house
05:13
but we did at least get your bed frame
05:15
out and that was the thing
05:17
in those days it wouldn't have made any
05:18
sense to ask what would you save in a
05:20
fire because everyone's at my bed frame
05:22
is that because it was made out of iron
05:24
uh no there were wooden so important to
05:26
get out if there's iron you just leave
05:27
it there come back with the fire because
05:28
what they used to do when they moved
05:30
house in the old days in america is they
05:31
would burn down the old house
05:33
and they would take the nails out of
05:35
their burning gashes because nails were
05:37
so expensive to make you just talking
05:39
about firefighters the very first
05:41
firefighting brigade was from ancient
05:43
roman times and it was a guy called
05:45
crassus which james and i always talk
05:47
about we've never said it on this
05:48
podcast i love this guy he basically
05:51
realized that when fires were happening
05:52
you could make a lot of money uh by
05:54
setting up a thing to put them out and
05:56
so he used to do this thing where he
05:58
announced he had like a 500 person fleet
06:00
for his uh his first fire brigade and a
06:02
fire would start and they'd all race to
06:05
it and as soon as they got there they
06:06
wouldn't put the fire out they'd
06:07
negotiate how much the guy was willing
06:09
to pay for them to put the fire down
06:11
and if they didn't reach an agreement
06:13
they'd just let it burn and they'd all
06:15
just watch it burn to the ground
06:16
and then crassus would buy the house
06:18
back cheaper he'd be like are you doing
06:19
anything with this plot no cheaper
06:21
yeah
06:23
this house is depreciated in value
06:24
somewhat
06:26
since turning into a pile of ash yeah
06:28
that was the first ever fire brigade
06:30
the first ever fire hose was in ancient
06:32
greece i think and i think this is
06:33
another example of inventions which i
06:35
love which are inventions which then
06:36
disappear people forget about them and
06:38
don't make them again for ages so i
06:39
think this vanished for 1700 years but
06:42
um fire hose invented an ancient grease
06:45
and it was made out of an ox's intestine
06:48
and i think so it was you put water in a
06:50
bag and then you attach a bag to an ox's
06:52
intestine and then you remove the
06:54
testing from the ox first
06:56
i think it depends what you want to be
06:57
spraying out
07:00
but yeah conventionally yeah if you're
07:02
trying to make yogurt however
07:06
and yeah the for the force at which
07:07
water kicks was expelled from the ox
07:09
guts that's amazing yeah wow that's so
07:11
good it's very cool um i read about a
07:13
guy who invented a helmet that you would
07:15
so one of the big problems obviously
07:17
when you're going into a fire was that
07:19
you would smother yourself with the
07:20
smoke you would pass out so everyone's
07:22
trying to work out in 1823 a guy called
07:24
charles dean invented a helmet that had
07:26
a hose attached to it so you would go in
07:28
and you'd have air pushed in through the
07:30
hose so you could breathe no one ended
07:31
up using it though because it was made
07:33
of metal and while people were inside
07:36
they were suddenly going
07:39
and dashing back out
07:41
in this kettle of a mask yeah
07:44
but then he transferred the design to a
07:46
diving helmet and those were the very
07:48
first diving helmets that we yeah it's
07:50
the same guys and that's what it became
07:51
good thank you yeah that's very cool a
07:53
hundred years before that which was in
07:55
1723 the first automatic fire
07:57
extinguisher was painted in england and
08:00
this was a guy called ambrose godfrey
08:02
and it consisted of a cask of fire
08:04
extinguishing fluid and a load of
08:06
gunpowder and you would set fire to the
08:09
gun platter it would explode and then
08:11
the water would go everywhere and then
08:12
it would put it out
08:14
uh idea did they used to have fire
08:16
extinguishing grenades as well yeah they
08:19
they were called fox balls weren't they
08:22
sorry careful yes they were invented by
08:24
a german guy called fox yeah and they
08:26
were little glass bowls with water or a
08:29
liquid inside and you would throw them
08:30
at the fire and it was like
08:31
really terrifying oh thank god the fire
08:34
department here grenade
08:39
have you guys heard of smoke jumpers i
08:41
have not no these are the coolest people
08:43
in the world they jump out of planes to
08:45
put out fires
08:46
they just they parachute down onto fires
08:49
and put them out what what how how
08:52
because i guess from that height it
08:54
looks really small but once you get
08:55
close
08:57
you put it down there
09:00
with your bucket
09:03
um no they they genuinely do this this
09:05
happens in uh whether a forest fire so
09:07
in places in the usa where you can get
09:09
fires and it's much faster to get there
09:12
basically with and obviously it's not a
09:14
it's not for a mass response you can't
09:15
have hundreds of people doing it but
09:17
these people do exist and they are and
09:19
i've read uh frequently asked questions
09:21
i've written a little interview with a
09:22
guy who is a smoke jumper and they just
09:24
sound like the hardest people in the
09:25
world so isn't it dangerous landing in a
09:27
fire we land close to not in the fire
09:32
and then he went on at least that's the
09:34
plan
09:37
it's not uncommon to land in smoldering
09:38
areas
09:40
so cool yeah they're the most hardcore
09:42
men in the world yeah and the things
09:43
they take as well they take backpacks
09:45
which have little pumping power supplies
09:47
on them sometimes they take chainsaws
09:48
which i think is to
09:50
cut trees which are at risk of being
09:52
close to the fire i haven't researched
09:53
that bit enough but sometimes they would
09:55
have like a crocodile
09:58
we're gonna have to move on to the next
09:59
fact
10:00
yeah if you've got something more can i
10:01
just tell people because we're on water
10:03
uh you could go the rest of your life
10:05
without drinking water again
10:07
this is just a big piece of propaganda
10:09
from water merchants big big water yeah
10:13
big water companies thinking of your
10:14
life so the whole thing about um you
10:16
have to drink eight cups of water a day
10:18
no scientists know where that comes from
10:19
there's no scientific basis for it you
10:21
can drink you can replace water if you
10:23
like with like coffee tea is not gonna
10:25
dehydrate coffee does have water in it
10:26
though yeah okay so when i say water i
10:29
mean you could dilute it with it doesn't
10:30
need to be water you mean you can have
10:32
rye bean or instead i mean you have
10:33
ribena but coffee tea don't dehydrate
10:36
you massively rehydrate you and drinking
10:38
eight cups of water a day is too much
10:40
you shouldn't drink water unless you
10:41
feel thirsty and also it doesn't help
10:43
you if you're an athlete it doesn't help
10:45
you drinking more water so they tested
10:47
cyclists and they had some dehydrated
10:50
cyclists compete against some
10:51
non-dehydrated cyclists didn't make a
10:53
difference wow totally fine i mean it
10:55
would make a difference eventually yeah
10:58
yeah so they didn't dehydrate them to
10:59
death
11:01
god ethics committees these days are a
11:02
nightmare
11:04
so anna chazinski says you do not need
11:06
to drink water and yet i'm the
11:09
for saying my dad has samurai scissors
11:13
sure
11:16
uh okay it is time for fact number two
11:18
and that is cecinski uh yes my fact is
11:21
that plants have their own internet and
11:24
it's made of fungus so not only this
11:27
they've got their internet which
11:28
precedes ours by hundreds of years by
11:30
the way um and 80 of them are signed up
11:33
to it
11:36
but wait to the ones which don't have it
11:38
are they in urban areas
11:42
developing countries and
11:44
rural places they have this they have
11:47
cyber crime online they have uh they
11:49
have social media they're gonna have
11:50
social media
11:52
they have online shopping
11:54
i'm just to go on like this like i've
11:56
lost the plot they've got myspace
11:58
they've got ebay they've got it all they
12:00
do you got tree bay
12:05
so i hate myself for that
12:08
um so they have this network of fungus
12:11
attached so you know when you pick up a
12:12
plant and you see those little white
12:13
strands coming off plants roots um
12:15
that's a kind of fungus and this system
12:16
is called mycorrhizae and it's a way of
12:20
them communicating with each other so
12:21
this fungus will link a whole garden of
12:23
plants together or a whole forest of
12:25
trees together and if one tree is
12:27
lacking in nutrients or water then it
12:29
will send out a signal and then another
12:31
tree will be able to send it nutrients
12:33
or water via the
12:35
fungus um
12:36
they have news updates this is my
12:38
version of news updates so if they're
12:40
under attack uh let's say for instance a
12:43
plant is being attacked by an aphid then
12:45
they'll be able to emit signals via the
12:47
mycorrhizae network and other plants
12:50
around will know that the aphids are
12:51
coming and they will put up their
12:53
defenses yeah but how much defense does
12:55
a tree have because i remember reading a
12:57
few years ago that um when giraffes eat
13:00
acacia trees they will give out some
13:02
kind of signal to the other trees to say
13:04
there are giraffes coming you're going
13:06
to get eaten but how do you stop
13:08
yourself from being
13:09
basically there's just a lot of other
13:10
messages going well
13:13
now i'm going to get eaten and spend the
13:15
last hour of my life afraid
13:17
um no actually that's a really
13:19
interesting question thanks for asking
13:21
and
13:22
this is so many ways so they can pump
13:23
out chemicals to make themselves less
13:25
tasty to attacking insects one really
13:28
clever thing that some beans bean plants
13:30
do is so they are preyed upon by aphids
13:33
and when they get preyed upon by aphids
13:35
they send out a perfume which is
13:36
delicious to wasps and wasps come so
13:39
they use wasps as their bodyguards and
13:41
the wasps come kill the aphids so they
13:44
just cool on their bodyguards worse
13:45
bodyguards i think that's so cool that
13:47
actually is what uh the smell of cut
13:49
grasses is partly the grass screaming
13:52
apparently
13:53
what
13:54
the smell of the lovely smell of cut
13:56
grass um is partly the plants screaming
13:59
it's partly summoning creatures to stop
14:01
the predator because it thinks it's
14:02
being eaten by other insects so it calls
14:05
over it that's yeah do you know you can
14:07
actually this is so weird they because
14:09
it does sound like plants have a slight
14:11
intelligence it seems so dubious i was
14:13
reading this this paper and it was
14:14
saying that you could you know
14:16
anesthetic works on plants they go down
14:18
like what does that mean and this other
14:20
one was that um
14:21
basically uh if you play a recording of
14:24
a caterpillar munching on a leaf
14:26
next to a certain plant the plant will
14:29
respond to it and let off a defense
14:31
mechanism as well so it's not even like
14:33
a real thing going on it's just
14:34
listening to a record of like uh
14:36
this happening and but how it doesn't
14:38
have ears what is it they think it might
14:40
be acoustic vibe like vibrations air
14:42
vibrations but the same thing if there's
14:44
a water pipe which is enclosed in a pipe
14:46
which couldn't possibly be emitting any
14:47
water into the soil roots will grow
14:49
towards it because it's assumed they can
14:51
hear the sound
14:53
is that normal water sorry or is it
14:57
is it james's super water
14:59
there was a study in 2009 by the royal
15:01
horticultural society um about how
15:04
quickly plants grow if you talk to them
15:06
because obviously you know the whole
15:07
thing prince charles did that and he
15:08
talked to his plants and stuff they
15:10
found that tomato plants grew up to two
15:12
inches taller if they were serenaded by
15:14
a female rather than a male uh and the
15:16
most effective talker came from a lady
15:18
called sarah darwin who was a great
15:20
great granddaughter of charles no yeah
15:24
and what only me
15:27
the most effective plant talker in the
15:29
world is a relative of charles darwin
15:31
uh and the things that she
15:34
i'll tell you what it does it gets
15:36
better she read out an excerpt from
15:38
darwin's on the origin of the species
15:42
they're so hot
15:43
[Laughter]
15:45
literally the hottest sentence i've ever
15:46
heard has just got two inches bigger
15:51
that is
15:52
that is amazing um i looked up uh so
15:55
while we're on the fungal network that
15:57
connects all uh plants i looked up some
15:58
british fungi names british fungi
16:01
include the jelly ear the bearded tooth
16:04
the weeping tooth crust
16:06
the slimy earth tongue the fetid
16:09
parachute
16:10
the brain fold truffle and my favorite
16:13
the hairy nuts disco
16:21
but that's the thing plant so i was
16:23
looking for this as well not fungus but
16:24
just plants they all used to have really
16:26
rude names dandelions trying to be known
16:28
as dandelions were originally called
16:30
pissabed oh yeah and they were called
16:32
pissabed because in french they're
16:34
called piss only which is the same right
16:36
and it's because they would make you
16:37
weak right yeah yeah that's that was the
16:39
idea so everyone's like well let's just
16:41
call it piss a bed because
16:43
listen to these other names mayor's fart
16:45
naked ladies open arse
16:50
piss and bum towel
16:53
um so
16:54
insects can talk to each other using a
16:56
plant as a kind of telephone
16:59
wow yeah too fast this is before they
17:01
got the internet they did
17:06
so if you've got an insect that's
17:07
feeding on the roots he doesn't want
17:08
another insect feeding on the leaves
17:10
because it could kill the plant too
17:12
quickly and so they'll send up a kind of
17:14
a signal to the leaves saying we don't
17:17
want anyone eating these leaves and it's
17:19
like a no vacancies kind of sign oh yeah
17:21
that's really cool and there was a guy
17:23
called clive baxter he was a lie
17:25
detector expert working for the fbi and
17:27
he claimed that if you wind up a plant
17:29
to a polygraph machine you'll be able to
17:30
detect what they're thinking
17:34
okay so here was this was his experiment
17:37
where were you on the night
17:41
what have you done with the soil
17:44
so he had a room with two plants in it
17:46
six students took it in turns to enter
17:48
the room and then one of them stamped on
17:51
and killed a plant in front of another
17:53
plant
17:57
okay but then they had a lineup
18:00
oh no pretty much
18:03
um when the five innocent students later
18:06
walked into the room there was little to
18:07
no response from the plant
18:10
however when the murderer came in the
18:13
plant went wild
18:16
um the study has never been able to be
18:18
replicated
18:23
uh we're gonna have to move on to our
18:24
next fact uh anyone else got anything i
18:27
i lost it all on the hairy nuts disco
18:29
i'm afraid
18:31
um okay it's time for fact number three
18:34
and that is andrew hunter murray my fact
18:36
is that in 1710 the boys of winchester
18:39
college rioted over insufficient beer
18:42
rations
18:42
[Laughter]
18:44
i think it was the sixth form to be fair
18:46
but still this is from a book called the
18:48
old boys the decline in rise of the
18:49
public school by a guy called david
18:51
turner and it's just incredible there
18:53
were loads of public school riots during
18:55
the 17th and 18th and 19th centuries um
18:57
so in 1690 the boys at manchester
19:00
grammar disagreed with their teachers
19:02
about the christmas holiday timings and
19:04
responded by locking themselves in with
19:06
guns
19:07
and firing warning shots that anyone who
19:09
came near the school
19:11
for a fortnight for a fortnight a
19:13
fortnight yeah
19:15
what was their objection don't lock
19:16
yourself in the school if you want more
19:18
politicians
19:20
that's very true yeah but these these
19:22
things happen they were in 70 years at
19:24
just at eaton there were six full-scale
19:27
riots and so how much beer did they get
19:29
do we know i don't know all right okay
19:31
because actually in the olden days
19:33
people used to drink a lot of beer
19:34
didn't they because it was safer than
19:36
drinking water and you know it would be
19:38
quite weak beer but you would still have
19:40
it nonetheless like kids as well kids
19:41
would just be downing pines going to see
19:44
the uh you don't actually need to drink
19:46
water that's the thing as long as you
19:47
drink lots of lots of beer
19:49
that's a very wise lesson in fact the
19:51
first children's picture book that is
19:54
known to man has instructions for
19:56
brewing your own beer
19:58
it has instructions for home brewing
19:59
beer and making your own wine yeah
20:00
amongst other things but it's an
20:02
important life lesson i think in the
20:03
workhouses men would have two pints of
20:06
beer a day according to their official
20:07
diet that they were allowed and children
20:09
who had one pint and women had a pint of
20:12
beer and a pint of tea
20:13
that was the official rules that they
20:15
were supposed to have they didn't all
20:16
get it but so is is it healthy for kids
20:19
to drink beer yes
20:25
and yet the bureaucrats in brussels
20:29
have decided it isn't no we're saying
20:30
it's not but like in the olden days
20:32
people it was better to drink beer which
20:34
had been brewed than to drink water
20:35
which hadn't been boiled um because it
20:37
was really bad for you uh women in labor
20:39
in the 16th century were given groaning
20:41
beer which was
20:43
consumed during labor and it was
20:44
supposed to help you rather than
20:46
anesthetics i guess yeah there was
20:47
actually a whole range of groaning foods
20:49
this is true yeah the um you had
20:51
groaning pie it sounds like a straight
20:53
out of harry potter a growing pie and
20:55
the in the navy of course they would
20:57
have lots of alcohol the daily ration up
21:00
until 1740 was half a pint of neat rum
21:03
twice a day
21:05
that's good right
21:06
yeah the navy were pissed the whole time
21:08
weren't they how do we win any battles
21:10
honestly they would go drunk into war
21:12
that was their big thing actually i did
21:14
find uh speaking of this um some lyrics
21:16
from um the original lyrics of what
21:19
should we do with the drunken sailor oh
21:21
wow you want to hear those yeah yeah
21:22
here are a few uh put him in the hole
21:24
with an angry weasel
21:26
[Laughter]
21:28
stick him in a bag and beat him
21:30
senseless there's another one and the
21:32
other one is uh put him in the hold with
21:34
the captain's daughter
21:36
wow yeah wow but actually a cat isn't
21:38
that punishing the daughter
21:41
well the captain's daughter was a
21:42
nickname for the catanal ninetales hey
21:44
just very quickly an update from a very
21:46
old fact that we did on the show just
21:48
going from you saying put them in a bag
21:50
and beat them there was that fact that
21:52
you said about how you used to get
21:54
thrown into okay so there was a pun an
21:56
old punishment in the olden days it was
21:58
capsule punishment i guess what you
21:59
would be put into a bag with a
22:03
cockerel a cat and a snake right but in
22:05
britain you couldn't get snakes very
22:07
easily and so they would just make do
22:09
with a picture of a snake
22:12
[Laughter]
22:17
there were a couple of other a little
22:19
riot variety no there were massive riots
22:21
um
22:22
so
22:22
for the the 1793 winchester college riot
22:25
which i think we all remember um
22:28
but basically the the headmaster they're
22:30
called wardens in those days had uh had
22:32
ordered the whole school to be punished
22:34
because of one boy's misdemeanor and the
22:36
the boys wrote to him saying that's
22:38
unfair you've broken the rules um and he
22:41
wrote back
22:42
not answering them satisfactorily so
22:44
they perceived the school again armed
22:45
with guns swords and clubs this is just
22:48
a common response the nice thing about
22:49
it is the whole correspondence between
22:50
them was in latin
22:53
pretty cool
22:56
i was looking up stuff about how alcohol
22:58
might be good for children
23:03
yep and we are a small but growing
23:05
political body
23:07
we're standing in five constituencies
23:09
this election quite a few people think
23:11
that it's that it's actually good for
23:12
you so for example do you guys know
23:13
about beer and belgium the schools in
23:15
belgium there there was a big push to
23:17
introduce
23:18
back into schools yeah and they actually
23:19
tested it out on a school um and they
23:22
all failed their exams
23:29
so the alcohol had only between 1.5 and
23:32
2.5 percent of alcohol in it um this was
23:35
it was set up in one particular school
23:37
where they wanted to test out do a test
23:38
run to see if it actually worked and
23:40
they found that 75 of the students that
23:42
they surveyed said oh we really like it
23:47
and unfortunately no other school was
23:49
willing to do the test but um so that
23:51
shouldn't be the way you judge whether
23:53
it's a good thing asking the drunk
23:54
peoples did you like that
23:57
obviously they really like it yeah but
23:59
the heroine trial at the same school is
24:00
going great
24:03
good stuff did you have some stuff about
24:04
riots
24:05
i did you want to hear some yeah okay uh
24:08
let me think okay well you only need
24:09
three people to cause a riot in the uk
24:11
and we've got four
24:15
uh you only need two people in nevada to
24:17
cause a riot
24:19
which is pretty good
24:20
is there any way we can have a
24:21
one-person riot i've never found it
24:23
anywhere in the world and i have looked
24:27
and just one other thing about beer in
24:29
1883 there was a competition organized
24:31
by the church of england temperance
24:33
society and they wanted to see how good
24:35
beer was compared to water and the game
24:37
was simple two men would cut down as
24:39
much corn as possible in a field one was
24:41
only allowed to drink water and the
24:43
other was only allowed to drink beer and
24:45
the winner was beer
24:49
mr terrell playing for beer cleared just
24:52
over 20 acres in 12 hours versus mr
24:55
abbey's 19 acres so he got an extra acre
24:58
and they were going to give the winner a
25:00
gold medal but he collapsed before they
25:02
could do something
25:02
[Laughter]
25:05
and so they dragged him into a wood and
25:07
anointed him with whiskey
25:11
um
25:12
um we're gonna have to move on by the
25:13
way so this is very very closely related
25:15
i think that your rioters uh public
25:18
schools who are writing about beard then
25:19
went on obviously to continue to do the
25:21
same thing because a famous rite that
25:22
happened in oxford in 1355 was the
25:26
scholastica day riot and this was when
25:28
this happened in the swindle stock
25:30
tavern and it was when walter springhoes
25:34
and roger de chesterfield who are two
25:36
university students surprisingly enough
25:38
argue with the taverna john croydon
25:40
about the quality of the beer though
25:41
about the quality of the drinks in his
25:42
pub they ended up assaulting him and in
25:45
the end 200 students started writing uh
25:48
it lasted two days 63 scholars and 30
25:50
locals were left dead but it ended up
25:53
being blamed on sorry it's the 14th
25:55
century um it's too soon anna it's too
25:58
soon some intake of breath over there
26:01
come on
26:02
there are more chesterfields in tonight
26:04
actually
26:06
sorry to the springters family
26:09
um and so the dispute was settled and it
26:11
turned out that the mayor had been
26:13
arguing on the side of the town's people
26:15
the non-students who've been saying this
26:16
is unfair we've been attacked for the
26:17
quality of the beer we're serving by
26:19
these past students and the mayor was
26:21
found in the wrong and his councils were
26:22
found in the wrong and they had to march
26:25
bare-headed through the streets and pay
26:26
the university a fine of one penny for
26:29
every scholar killed for 470 years and
26:33
they did that until 1825 when the mayor
26:35
decided this is getting ridiculous and
26:38
the currency was changing so many times
26:40
anyway it was very hard to know what to
26:41
pay and it stopped but yeah the
26:43
scholastica day riot can i just say i
26:46
think we've done very well so far have
26:47
hardly been rude at all in this podcast
26:50
because it's been penis penis penis
26:51
until now of this last five episodes so
26:54
yes there's been no filth whatsoever
26:56
this podcast so far in all of these
26:58
first three facts
27:00
should we can we move on there yeah sure
27:02
okay okay uh time for our final fact of
27:05
the show and that is my fact my fact
27:07
this week is that the first man to
27:09
discover the clitoris
27:15
was colombo
27:21
so uh colombo uh
27:23
not the detective uh
27:26
well i know what a shame um i just love
27:28
that so this is this is a guy who
27:30
suddenly it was 1559 i believe he
27:32
suddenly said guess what guys i found
27:34
the clitoris and everyone was like oh we
27:37
knew where it was anyway but he was the
27:39
first person to properly say this is
27:41
where the clitoris is um
27:43
and he was an amazing physician he was
27:45
working with michelangelo on a book that
27:48
was about the anatomy which michelangelo
27:50
was going to illustrate we don't know
27:52
what happened we don't know how it never
27:53
came out but that would have been the
27:54
most seminal book of medical history
27:57
michelangelo said well i like drawing
27:58
the occasional penis but this is
28:00
ridiculous
28:01
seminal seemed like an unfortunate
28:03
choice of word there didn't it
28:06
i looked on atom online um to find out
28:09
the etymology of um clitoris and they're
28:12
not really sure it either comes from the
28:14
greek for to shut or a key or the side
28:18
of a hill or the tickler
28:21
i guess it depends on the woman
28:22
presumably
28:24
and then they go on and say the
28:26
anatomist matteo colombo who you were
28:28
talking about professor at padua claimed
28:30
to have discovered it he called it amor
28:32
veneris vel ducedo or whatever which is
28:36
the love or sweetness of venus but then
28:39
it says it had been known earlier to
28:40
women
28:44
[Applause]
28:47
so yeah i think that's the problem
28:48
really for him just for you to say he
28:50
discovered it he was the first person to
28:52
proclaim to have discovered it well yeah
28:54
so you say there's another arrival
28:56
doctor also male gabriel fallopias who
29:00
when
29:01
this guy came out with this announcement
29:03
said i've discovered the clitoris i've
29:05
written about it in my book and they had
29:06
a proper um so he tried to sue him for
29:08
plagiarism i think um
29:12
[Laughter]
29:15
there was another um there was another
29:17
doctor as well he was called vesselius
29:19
and i think he taught fellopio so i
29:22
think the grudge match was originally
29:23
between um vessels and colombo and
29:26
versailles said that it was he described
29:28
it as a new and useless part so
29:30
presumably he was just throwing shade at
29:32
the clitoris because he was angry not to
29:33
have discovered it i think was he his
29:36
teacher or he might have been his
29:37
student but anyway i do know that once
29:38
this started coming about one of them
29:40
was dead and so one of them tried to sue
29:42
the other and it was completely useless
29:44
because
29:45
the dead person was fallopian the guy
29:46
who invented not invented
29:49
discovered velophian james philippio
29:51
actually built the first woman
29:55
yeah
29:56
16th century uh yeah he was so a really
29:59
cool thing about fellow gabriel
30:01
fallopian he did find and describe the
30:04
fallopian tubes and he named them for
30:07
the fallopian tubes um fallopian after
30:10
his own name fallopius and tubes after
30:13
the fact that they look like tubers the
30:16
instrument nothing to do with the fact
30:17
that they're tubes
30:20
really yeah that's a mistranslation so
30:22
the fallopian tubes were supposed to be
30:24
the fallopian tubers and it's because
30:25
the shape of them is like a brass tuber
30:28
if everyone if everyone listening to
30:30
this starts only calling them fallopian
30:32
tubers
30:34
we can change the world
30:37
how often in conversation andy
30:40
i'll say once a day for the rest of the
30:41
year i'll say fallopian tubers if you do
30:44
so fallopias invented the first condom
30:46
as well didn't he um it was covered in
30:49
salt and had to be
30:51
like in like a cocktail or something
30:53
i suppose literally like a cocktail in a
30:55
way
30:58
don't forget to put a bit of salt around
30:59
the rim
31:01
sorry
31:07
that's a line from an episode of bottom
31:08
i watched the other day
31:12
oh dear
31:14
so his condom was covered in salt and it
31:16
had to be tucked under the foreskin so
31:18
it was uncomfortable
31:20
so much as it was unusable uh and it was
31:23
it was to kind of stop syphilis rather
31:25
than
31:25
through um contraception but also it was
31:28
held on by a pink ribbon so that it
31:30
would appeal to women
31:32
[Laughter]
31:39
let's be honest guys we know she's not
31:41
gonna like the main event
31:46
but we can at least dollar it up a bit
31:51
so he was doing this because there was a
31:52
massive rise in stis stds was the big
31:56
one this is the sentence that confused
31:58
me i didn't actually read anymore i
31:59
should have but um it said
32:01
he tested these condoms in one thousand
32:03
one hundred men now
32:05
did he test that
32:08
and there were no pregnancies not one
32:10
now
32:12
defy me to say it doesn't work
32:15
just speaking of fallopia who's there's
32:16
a body part so obviously named after him
32:18
i was looking at other body parts that
32:20
are named after people and the pedant
32:23
pudendal canal is also called the alcock
32:26
canal or the allcock canal because it
32:28
was discovered by benjamin alcock and
32:30
it's where blood is carried to the
32:32
genitalia so benjamin alcock discovered
32:35
the little tube that carries blood to
32:36
your willy that's so good it's good that
32:38
he didn't it's that way because i'm
32:39
always getting that in conversation
32:42
that's good to now know um again we were
32:44
talking about names earlier for plants
32:46
and this is the same thing so fallopian
32:48
tube uh i was looking through just a
32:50
list of people who've discovered a bit
32:52
of the body and had it named after them
32:54
there's so many bits of the body that i
32:56
didn't know about and it sounds like the
32:57
most awesome fantasy novel if someone
33:01
was on a trip
33:02
like they would like imagine okay
33:03
they're passing the pouch of douglas
33:06
they make their way through to the crypt
33:08
of liberkun that's a place on our body
33:11
the crypt of libricum the sphincter of
33:14
audi
33:14
[Laughter]
33:16
the zonule of zinn
33:18
well the zonule of zen sounds like where
33:20
your dad had his scissors made
33:24
[Applause]
33:28
uh i thought we'd i knew you were going
33:30
to have a look at some things named
33:31
after people's um so in 2004 there was a
33:34
group of scientists who discovered a new
33:36
species of cockroach that they described
33:38
as dirty ugly smelly and in need of a
33:41
name
33:42
and this cockroach extrudes urine out of
33:45
its back and deposits it on his genital
33:47
region for the female to eat
33:50
and they uh made it so that you could
33:52
bid to name it after your enemy
33:55
isn't that cool it's such a good idea
33:57
and so whoever bid the most i don't know
33:59
who won unfortunately because they
34:00
haven't sure you don't even know when
34:01
it's released it's dan schreiber next
34:03
week it's gonna become perfectly clear
34:06
well that's such a good idea isn't it
34:08
naming something horrible and disgusting
34:09
after y'all yeah yeah because linnaeus
34:12
he he um named an ugly insignificant
34:15
weed after one of his critics
34:17
it's called six beckya wow that's great
34:21
is it true so linnaeus can you just
34:23
quickly explain who he is he is the
34:24
father of taxonomy so he came up with
34:26
the idea of naming things in this latin
34:28
system that we use yeah and he was
34:30
obsessed with um i mean he was really
34:32
egotistical he thought he was the god's
34:34
gift to to the planet
34:36
god makes linnaeus names
34:39
right so is is this true that he had a
34:42
garden that he could tell the time of
34:44
the day by because he knew plants so
34:46
well that when they when they opened
34:48
he'd be like oh it's three yeah i think
34:50
this time of the year as well maybe oh
34:51
wow yeah well i mean i can tell the time
34:53
of the year
34:55
um the thing i really like about this
34:56
back though is that it's it is that man
34:59
thing of going i've discovered the
35:00
clitoris and everyone's going no we knew
35:02
about it like we women knew about this
35:04
and just the way that medical journals
35:07
used to talk about the anatomy of a
35:09
woman back in the day
35:11
was just so absurd and so it was like i
35:14
found one in the british medical journal
35:16
from 1878 they ran a correspondence
35:19
between people where they were
35:20
discussing on whether menstruating
35:21
women's touches like so a menstruating
35:23
woman if she touched a bit of ham
35:26
whether it would ruin the ham and that
35:27
was like a serious thing they're like
35:29
maybe they shouldn't they shouldn't be
35:30
touching ham
35:32
was that a massive problem before that
35:35
we're menstruating women constantly
35:36
touching ham okay i guess you get this
35:38
urge it's impossible to explain
35:42
obviously i'm in every butcher in london
35:48
yeah i mean they were thinking some
35:49
extraordinary things at the time uh at
35:51
the time that the clitoris was
35:53
discovered so it was still thought at
35:55
the time that there was one sex and a
35:56
woman was just a less developed version
35:58
of a man and that in the womb the fetus
36:01
hadn't received enough heat so hadn't
36:02
been able to spurt its clitoris into a
36:05
penis in time and so a clitoris was just
36:07
a less developed version of a penis
36:09
people thought and there was a belief
36:11
that galen who was the uh ancient doctor
36:14
wrote down and he had evidence of and
36:16
people still believed in the 16th
36:18
century that women if they overheated
36:21
could spontaneously grow a penis and
36:22
turn into a man
36:28
calm down barbara
36:30
you'll get a penis again
36:33
and i really gallard is really amazing
36:35
because he uh he believed that they
36:38
didn't know where sperm came from when
36:39
he was around and his big idea which
36:41
everyone was like oh that makes total
36:43
sense uh is that sperm was in your brain
36:46
and it traveled through your spinal cord
36:49
and then it came out so when you were
36:50
having sex you would be like oh
36:58
[Applause]
37:05
something we hope we never see again
37:09
um so the truth is of course the
37:11
opposite to what galen thought is that
37:13
every penis was once a clitoris right oh
37:16
what um so and you still have the
37:18
remnants of it because when a fetus is
37:20
first developing in the womb it starts
37:22
as that your genitalia starts as a
37:24
clitoris before the male hormones start
37:26
getting involved and growing your own
37:27
penis and there's still a i'm just going
37:29
to read this out so i don't have to
37:30
actually say it myself
37:32
anyway
37:33
there's a dark underskin and a thin
37:35
ridge or seam known as the raf which
37:37
runs from scrotum to anus and that's the
37:39
remnants of your clitoris so
37:42
that's a that's a
37:44
wow
37:46
or your vagina that's a little bit
37:51
wow and actually dad and andy you have a
37:54
vagina thank you thank you very much um
37:57
that you finally noticed
38:03
uh it's called the vagina masculina and
38:06
it is the remnant of the time as a fetus
38:08
when it was neither male nor female
38:10
and the body could have grown into
38:12
either sex at that time and it can be
38:14
found at the opening of your prostate
38:16
and it's like a vestigial
38:18
thing well next time i'm around there
38:22
i'll check in andy
38:24
after the show
38:27
did you like that face you made
38:29
you can see it again
38:34
we're gonna have to wrap up i think we
38:36

00:10
[Music]
00:14
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:16
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:19
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:20
covent garden my name is dan schreiber
00:22
i'm sitting here with anna chazinski
00:24
james harkin and andy murray
00:26
and once again we have gathered around
00:27
the microphone with our four favorite
00:29
facts from the last seven days
00:30
and in no particular order here we go
00:33
starting with you
00:33
zyzinski uh yeah my fact is that for 200
00:36
years after tomatoes made it to england
00:39
they were grown almost entirely for
00:41
ornamental reasons because they didn't
00:42
want to eat them
00:44
because they were just waiting for them
00:45
to be ripe not ready
00:47
it's still red wait for it to be green
00:51
i think what they killed i think the
00:52
first tomatoes that we brought over were
00:53
yellow and that's why they're called
00:55
pomodore
00:56
in italian i think it's like yellow
00:59
apples or something um anyway yeah
01:01
people thought they were poisonous and
01:02
this was for well there were a number of
01:04
explanations for why people thought that
01:06
i think the most likely one is that they
01:08
were
01:08
botanically identified as being
01:10
belonging to the nightshade family
01:12
and people knew that other members of
01:13
the nightshade family deadly nightshade
01:14
were poisonous
01:15
so they were botanically advanced enough
01:17
to work out what family tomatoes belong
01:19
to
01:19
but not botanically advanced enough to
01:21
say these things are obviously harmless
01:23
you can eat them
01:24
so there's another theory that they were
01:25
actually poisoning people isn't there
01:27
and the idea behind that is that um they
01:30
have pewter plates which contains lead
01:32
and the um tomatoes have acid in them
01:35
and the acid would
01:36
release the lead out of the pewter
01:38
plates and would give people lead
01:39
poisoning so that was one theory
01:40
yes that is definitely another theory
01:42
although i think pewter plates mainly
01:44
belong to wealthy people but
01:45
yeah i reckon if they thought they were
01:46
part of the nightshade family then maybe
01:48
a few rich people got ill from that
01:50
that would have meant can i can i say my
01:52
favorite theory
01:55
no no this was this was a big one during
01:56
the day they thought someone noticed
01:58
um i believe it was ralph waldo emerson
02:01
in fact noticed that there was a worm
02:03
that was going into his tomato and he
02:04
thought that it was the worm that was
02:06
poisonous that it was poisoning
02:08
the actual uh tomato and so it was a
02:10
green tomato worm wasn't it
02:12
yes yeah exactly and it's just great
02:14
because a bit of hysteria was created
02:16
out of people thinking that it was
02:18
this thing there's uh someone who
02:19
described it as poisonous as a
02:21
rattlesnake
02:22
they were saying you know stay away from
02:23
this thing and there's a wonderful quote
02:26
dr fuller who was the man who described
02:28
it as poisonous as a rattlesnake
02:29
said that there is a new enemy to human
02:33
existence
02:35
and then he said that if you if you were
02:36
bitten uh that you would swell
02:38
if even a bit of spittle came onto you
02:40
you would die and then someone else
02:42
pointed out that
02:42
wouldn't hurt a flea so it wasn't
02:44
actually as dangerous but for a while
02:45
they thought it was this worm
02:46
which is pretty cool yeah i think
02:47
tomatoes were just starting to get over
02:49
their bad reputation and suddenly these
02:51
worms were locked up
02:52
and there was such hysteria there's this
02:54
story that's told it's so brilliant and
02:56
there's no first-hand record of it but
02:58
it was reported in newspapers in the
02:59
19th century and it's that
03:01
it was in salem it was the old county
03:04
courthouse in salem it was 1820
03:06
and this guy called colonel johnson had
03:08
decided it was getting ridiculous that
03:10
everyone thought tomatoes were poisonous
03:12
and he was going to prove to people that
03:13
they weren't and so he stood on the
03:15
steps of salem courthouse
03:16
and he ate this whole bowl of tomatoes
03:18
in front of this huge crowd
03:20
and the witness reports apparently
03:22
according to newspapers that reported
03:23
later said that women were screaming and
03:25
fainting as they watched him do what
03:26
they thought was suicide
03:28
in public do you know the latin name for
03:30
tomatoes is
03:31
it's lycopercicon which means wolf peach
03:35
how cool is that yeah why do we know why
03:38
no well i don't
03:41
maybe it's because when they go moldy
03:42
they get a grey fur yes
03:44
and they also start hunting in packs and
03:48
a few of them can bring down a fully
03:49
grown moose it's actually no wonder
03:51
people were afraid of them for so long
03:53
yeah well there was the attack of the
03:55
killer tomatoes movie wasn't there there
03:57
was that factual documentary yes
04:00
um the return of the killer tomatoes was
04:02
george clooney's first movie
04:05
he'd been in a few things before but
04:06
that was his first main break
04:08
wow well done george and the first uh
04:11
attack of the killer tomatoes um
04:13
there was a helicopter crash uh which is
04:15
in there at the start and it was a real
04:16
crash
04:17
and um it was a rented helicopter and
04:20
it went down unfortunately no one was
04:22
killed um but the crash cost them 60
04:25
000 which used up more of the budget
04:27
than all other aspects of the film
04:29
combined
04:30
wow whoa at least they got the footage
04:32
did you guys know that george clooney
04:34
10 years exactly 10 years before he
04:36
started being the star of er
04:38
was the star of a hospital drama called
04:41
er with dots after the e and the r
04:44
really yeah
04:45
what yeah the problem here is the dots
04:47
let's get rid of the dots and remake it
04:49
the first one was actually about
04:50
elizabeth regina
04:51
it was uh it was a thing about the queen
04:52
yeah he played he played her
04:54
very sensitively and magnificently
04:56
actually it does kind of feel like there
04:57
was um
04:58
some kind of admin mix-up doesn't it it
05:00
really just got the cast list and got
05:02
the wrong castle it's the old one it's
05:04
like
05:04
yeah yeah someone robert de niro was
05:06
meant to get the part in here
05:08
i have a news story which i also wanted
05:10
to share with you yeah um this is from
05:12
2013 from the bbc
05:14
a man caught with a prostitute in his
05:16
cart told police she was there to show
05:17
him where to buy tomatoes
05:20
is that euphemism it's in the west
05:23
midlands and um
05:25
i could have told him where to get
05:26
tomatoes in the west midlands
05:28
where there's a nice big morrisons in
05:30
wolverhampton yep
05:31
well he could have saved 20 quid and a
05:33
400 pound fine from
05:35
walsall magistrates court uh so yeah i
05:37
don't know that as well
05:38
police reaction was amazing pc uh one of
05:40
the police from walsall police said
05:43
um i've heard some excuses before but in
05:45
the 10 years i've been a police officer
05:47
i've never heard a curb crawler covering
05:48
up his crimes by claiming to be buying
05:50
tomatoes
05:51
our officers in the court saw through
05:52
his lies
05:53
[Laughter]
05:56
well done scooby that's another crime
05:59
solved
05:59
um i've uh over the last few years
06:02
developed a new taste for
06:03
tomato juice on planes it is supposed to
06:05
taste better
06:06
yeah than like other things that you
06:08
would try on the
06:09
aeroplanes would taste worse but
06:11
actually tomato juice like bloody mary's
06:13
and stuff are supposed to be
06:14
still okay yeah why is that well your
06:16
taste buds um obviously go down
06:18
so tomato juice because of the thickness
06:20
kind of and for other reasons i'm sure
06:22
retains the full taste okay but they did
06:24
a massive test of it that in a
06:26
simulation where they had
06:28
passengers come on to a simulated flight
06:31
to drink tomato juice because surely
06:34
it's the altitude that makes a
06:36
difference
06:36
yes exactly so actually the uh whole
06:38
study
06:39
brought no conclusive results but they
06:42
but the reasonings they asked all the
06:43
passengers why did you go for it and
06:45
one of the main results which is exactly
06:48
what i did
06:49
is that you see the person ahead of you
06:51
or two people ahead of you going uh
06:53
tomato juice and you go
06:54
oh i might have a tomato juice and that
06:56
was genuinely one of the main results
06:57
that they got hang on
06:58
so they think that it just happens that
07:00
the people in the front row tend to
07:01
order tomato juice
07:03
someone orders it and it spills down
07:04
surely we have to work out why that
07:06
first person always ordered because they
07:07
were at the back of a previous flight
07:08
when someone offered them tomatoes
07:10
one person once happened to order tomato
07:12
juice and since then it's been a
07:14
constant dominance hang on sometimes the
07:16
trolley comes from behind you on a plane
07:17
yeah
07:18
oh you don't want an economy right i
07:19
didn't know they had trolleys back there
07:23
another theory about the tomato juice
07:24
thing is that i can't believe this but
07:27
is that the noise of the
07:28
plane affects how you perceive flavor
07:32
wow but you've genuinely experienced the
07:34
tomato juice thing on planes it's my
07:35
main topic of conversation if there's
07:37
someone i don't know next to me like oh
07:38
my god
07:39
yeah with the tomato juice excuse me are
07:41
there any spare seats
07:43
i don't mind going back to economy
07:46
tomatoes um are they a fruit or
07:49
vegetable
07:49
they are a fruit they are so botanically
07:52
they are a fruit but legally
07:53
they are a vegetable and that was a
07:55
precedent set in
07:57
1887 because some guy called john nix
07:59
was trying to import a bunch of tomatoes
08:02
and he was saying these are botanically
08:03
a fruit and so i shouldn't have to pay
08:05
the vegetable
08:06
tariff on them because there wasn't the
08:07
same tariff for fruits and
08:09
the courts decided that they wanted him
08:10
to pay that tariff so they declared that
08:11
tomatoes were a vegetable and he had to
08:13
pay up
08:13
and that's it the judge said in the
08:16
common language of the people
08:17
whether sellers or consumers of
08:19
provisions all these are vegetables
08:21
which are grown in kitchen gardens and
08:23
which
08:24
whether eaten cold or raw are like
08:26
potatoes carrots parsnips turnips
08:29
beets cauliflower cabbage celery and
08:33
lettuce
08:34
usually served at dinner in
08:37
with or after the soup fish are meat
08:40
which constitute the principal part of
08:42
the repast and not
08:44
like fruits generally as a dessert
08:47
and i must admit i didn't realize how
08:48
long that was going to be
08:51
i cannot think of that guy got turned
08:53
down in his job as a chef
08:54
and went on so um other things that were
08:58
not used
08:59
uh for eating originally um the romans
09:02
didn't really eat butter
09:03
they did have it but they didn't really
09:05
eat it what did they do with it they
09:07
would rub it on themselves
09:09
if they had a burn for instance they
09:12
would use it for medical reasons
09:14
um the germans had it and they did kind
09:16
of eat it more
09:17
but they didn't eat it all the time they
09:19
used it for hair dressing
09:21
um herodotus says that the thracian's at
09:24
it but the greeks thought that they were
09:25
weird for eating it
09:26
so like back in the old days hardly
09:28
anyone at butter was it did it happen
09:29
with
09:30
the first roman who got a burn on his
09:32
lips
09:33
put it on there well this is delicious
09:37
wait a second or when they burnt their
09:39
toast presumably
09:40
[Laughter]
09:44
[Applause]
09:47
[Music]
09:49
okay time for fact number two and that's
09:51
my fact my fact this week
09:53
is that nasa is planning on giving the
09:55
moon
09:56
a moon which is very exciting
09:59
explain yourself okay so so basically
10:02
nasa is
10:03
going to it's quite an ambitious idea
10:05
and
10:06
in theory no kidding but but they are
10:07
they are going for it so it's not
10:09
you know it is nasa it's not like some
10:12
college kids
10:12
they've they've got it planned is it
10:14
going to be a smaller moon than the
10:15
current sized moon oh
10:16
yes yeah yeah so the idea is that in
10:18
2020 they're going to launch
10:21
a probe that's going to go to a passing
10:23
asteroid they're going to land on the
10:25
asteroid
10:25
and lasso around it or using a kind of
10:28
knapsack bag
10:29
of a sort of gigantic scale take a
10:31
boulder off it
10:32
then head back to our moon and then
10:35
leave that boulder
10:36
at a point where it can orbit the moon
10:38
and then they can
10:40
mine the asteroid for everything learn
10:43
more about what asteroids are made up of
10:44
and so on
10:45
it's hugely ambitious but it's it's in
10:47
the slot yeah so i don't think moons can
10:49
really have
10:50
moons um well our moon can't really it
10:53
could have one for a short amount of
10:54
time but
10:55
eventually the orbit would decay and
10:57
that's because
10:58
the um movement of the earth and the
11:00
movement of the sun
11:01
would kind of give tidal forces that
11:03
would kind of decay the orbit and how
11:05
long do you think they could have it for
11:06
i think they could have it for a fair
11:08
amount of time good few years but it
11:09
wouldn't last forever
11:10
that's quite cool though we're going to
11:12
live in a period where the moon has an
11:13
orbiting
11:14
moon but it is weird like if you look at
11:16
nasa's schedule for you know
11:18
its upcoming seasons um it does have a
11:20
few planned
11:21
projects that you just go have i read an
11:24
april fool's
11:24
page and i checked the date this time
11:26
and i haven't uh because
11:28
they're doing the planning of going to
11:30
venus with these balloons that are going
11:32
to sit and kind of create a little
11:33
balloon city that they can
11:35
do observations from it's really weird
11:37
they're working on a city made out of
11:38
huge balloons in the clouds of venus
11:40
which will allow astronauts to explore
11:41
the planet without venturing onto the
11:43
hostile surface
11:45
that's from a science website
11:48
it's amazing yeah i read another one
11:50
from 2020
11:51
this is a mission called the asteroid
11:53
impact mission
11:55
and they're going to send a probe up to
11:56
an asteroid called didimus
11:59
and the asteroid didymus has a moon
12:01
called
12:02
diddy moon
12:03
[Laughter]
12:07
just like those names yeah the naming
12:09
conventions are great and they
12:10
officially
12:11
encourage you not to name them after
12:13
your pets
12:14
but i don't know how strictly the rules
12:16
are enforced basically we talk about
12:17
asteroids
12:18
yes asteroids are actually lots lots of
12:20
planetary bodies but they um
12:22
instituted the rule relatively recently
12:24
but the first one that came to their
12:25
attention which they didn't like was a
12:27
guy who named
12:28
an asteroid spock or he named it mr
12:30
spock
12:31
but it wasn't after mr spock it was
12:33
after his cat
12:34
who was called mr spock presumably the
12:36
cat was called mr spock after mr spock
12:38
yes but it was the asteroid was
12:40
technically being named after a cat
12:41
that's so good and then in the 19th
12:43
century people would name them after
12:44
their mistresses and racy things like
12:46
that and they said yeah we don't want
12:47
that either
12:48
well my mistress was called missed spot
12:53
that's why i called her anyway um just
12:56
like with with the idea of names being
12:58
odd this check out the name for this
12:59
venus one
13:00
it's called the high altitude venus
13:02
operational concept
13:04
that's not a very good name but it
13:05
actually breaks down into havoc
13:07
is that what you want to be naming a
13:08
serious nasa mission exactly is that a
13:10
balloon
13:11
yeah yeah this is a proposal stage at
13:13
the moment but it is being proposed by
13:15
nasa to nasa
13:16
they know well surely nasa's going to
13:18
accept it
13:20
guys i think this is a brilliant idea
13:23
oh thank you nasa no problem nasser
13:27
um just the idea of naming something
13:29
havoc though yes we're doing a central
13:31
high altitude
13:32
operational system the project chaos
13:34
yeah or mayhem
13:36
or certain death
13:37
[Laughter]
13:39
i found something really nice about just
13:41
speaking of asteroids and things
13:42
orbiting each other
13:44
so um you all know that pluto was
13:46
downgraded from being a planet
13:48
in 2006 to being a planet
13:51
the decision could have gone another way
13:53
because the international
13:54
astronomical union met up and according
13:56
to a draft definition of planets
13:58
it's moon uh charon or sharon
14:02
could have been upgraded to being a
14:03
planet so then you're saron is just a
14:05
pretentious sharon isn't it
14:07
let's be honest sorry it's moon sharon
14:09
it's moonshine
14:10
sharon is someone's named after the
14:12
mistress haven't they
14:14
yeah and pluto presumably after that pet
14:21
he must have that must have been a good
14:22
day's work
14:24
the guys will never work it out um but
14:26
yeah there would have been
14:27
a binary pair of planets because they
14:29
orbit a centre of gravity which is
14:30
outside both of them it's a point of
14:32
space between the two of them
14:33
so they're both constantly orbiting that
14:34
point there's a great moon that i saw
14:37
called mimaz and it looks exactly like
14:39
the death star
14:41
from star wars it looks exactly like it
14:43
it's so cool yeah or it looks like a
14:45
like a 3d squeezable boob that's the
14:47
other thing it looks like
14:48
i'm sorry aren't boobs just 3d
14:51
squeezable boots
14:54
normally you have to specify if a boob
14:56
is 2d or not squeezable
15:00
um nasa is looking so is looking to
15:03
employ people i suppose it's looking for
15:05
people who are willing to stay
15:06
in bed for 70 days and it'll pay them
15:09
18 000 but yeah this is to see what
15:13
effects long periods of having to stay
15:15
still like you often would have to in a
15:16
spaceship or something has on the body
15:17
and has on a loss of
15:19
muscle and bone and cardiovascular
15:20
function like hypersleep
15:22
it's like hypersleep except you'd be
15:23
awake and bored but earning good money
15:26
um well that's it's a new thing called
15:28
terror naughts where
15:29
you can you can have a whole career at
15:32
nasa
15:33
as an earth astronaut a terror knot so
15:35
you just hang here and you do all the
15:37
things that they're prepping astronauts
15:38
to do including
15:39
laying in bed i can just see the husband
15:41
at a party going i'm an astronaut and
15:43
the wife next i'm going you're
15:44
you're an earth astronaut
15:45
[Laughter]
15:48
i i i looked up a list of things that
15:49
are on the moon yeah okay that we have
15:51
left there okay because
15:52
lots of things have crashed into there
15:54
over the years it's a huge amount it's
15:55
about the weight of a blue whale so golf
15:56
balls is famously up there golf balls
15:58
there's also a javelin is there yeah
16:00
ah when alan shepard made his golf shot
16:03
uh his colleague
16:04
threw a it was an improvised javelin
16:06
that was apparently a staff from a solar
16:08
wind experiment
16:09
but he threw it as a javelin and i have
16:10
a theory that it might be the longest
16:12
javelin
16:13
throw ever it was made on the moon i
16:15
when there how far did it go
16:17
well there isn't data but well the world
16:19
record of javelin's probably just over
16:21
100 meters
16:22
probably 106 meters or something like
16:23
that yeah but you do need data
16:25
andy i don't like with world records the
16:27
way it works is i mean you have to
16:28
provide an
16:29
actual number rather than saying i
16:32
reckon
16:33
it's just my theory i can't prove it but
16:35
i do believe it
16:37
also on the moon there are they call
16:39
them defecation collection devices
16:41
and there are five of those and there is
16:43
a jazz dot worth for a toilet attendant
16:45
isn't it
16:47
but on the way back he's like oh god has
16:49
anyone got two quid i could leave this
16:52
that's the terrible thing they live on
16:53
tips and there's very little to come by
16:55
on the moon
16:56
um and there are 10 urine bags which are
16:58
divided into urine collection assembly
17:00
small
17:01
and urine collection assembly large and
17:04
there are also six pegs which are just
17:05
called emesis
17:06
which actually means vomit yeah but they
17:08
were too polite to say
17:10
vomit bags wow yeah i read the other day
17:13
that um
17:13
buzz aldrin actually brought a book to
17:15
the moon which
17:23
yeah he brought a book to the moon what
17:25
was the book it was a biography of a
17:27
um pioneer of rockets so someone who was
17:30
building rockets and i can't remember
17:31
his name but
17:32
yeah um speaking of emesis in space
17:34
they've been
17:35
nasa has been developing ways of getting
17:37
alcohol into space
17:39
or tentatively smuggling it up
17:42
at the moment you're not allowed um yeah
17:44
well at the moment you're not allowed
17:46
alcohol in
17:46
the russians take it up don't they yes
17:49
do they secretly they were bringing up
17:50
vodka um the weird thing is they only
17:53
actually took vodka up because it went
17:54
so well with the tomato juice
17:56
which just tastes so much better in
17:58
space
18:00
only because someone said could i have
18:01
the uh vodka tomato juice
18:03
astronaut behind it yeah it was kind of
18:05
odd it was uh john glenn
18:06
said fancy tomato juice everyone's
18:09
copying him ever since
18:12
um yeah so sorry they've developed like
18:14
a powdered sherry nasa
18:15
um tried out and they decided to test
18:18
this out by recreating
18:20
a zero gravity test and putting people
18:21
on the test flight and as soon as the
18:23
astronauts who are in this test fight
18:25
smelt the sherry they all vomited
18:26
so they haven't perfected it yet i
18:28
actually think that the australians
18:30
have developed a beard to take to space
18:32
and so far as i know it's the only
18:34
contribution of space that
18:36
the aussies have made the italians are
18:38
taking a
18:39
espresso machine up aren't they and
18:42
the south koreans came up with their
18:45
space kimchi
18:46
oh yeah so like a lot of different
18:49
countries like
18:50
do their specialism and i guess
18:51
australia's this beer
18:53
yeah america has spacex australia has 4x
18:58
[Applause]
19:01
[Music]
19:02
okay time for fact number three andrew
19:05
hunter murray
19:06
my fact is that the man who played
19:07
sherlock holmes spent the first world
19:09
war dressed as a tree
19:12
which man what exactly benedict
19:14
cumberbatch no
19:15
not benedict cumberbatch was not as far
19:17
as i know intimately involved in the
19:19
first world war
19:20
you're saying is a coward yes giraffe
19:22
dodger and
19:23
i can say that all i like because i know
19:24
that he won't fight me over it um
19:27
this was basil rathbone who was one of
19:30
the first
19:30
people to become extremely famous
19:32
playing sherlock holmes who played him
19:33
in a lot of films
19:34
yeah he's kind of he's one of those guys
19:35
who i know about and i remember his face
19:37
but until his name is said out loud
19:40
if you just said name the sherlock
19:41
holmes guy i wouldn't be able to name
19:43
him but he did he did like 16 movies
19:45
yeah
19:45
200 radio plays yeah yeah and he was
19:48
also in the first world war
19:49
playing a tree yeah
19:52
um he was fought on the on the western
19:55
front and his brother was killed in 1918
19:57
and he did these incredibly dangerous
20:00
patrols where during daylight he and
20:02
other men would
20:04
basically camouflage themselves as trees
20:06
and walk
20:07
very very slowly or crawl towards the
20:09
german trenches
20:10
oh if you're crawling are you going as a
20:12
tree that's fallen down i guess yeah i
20:14
suppose so yeah
20:15
it's such an interesting concept the
20:17
idea of the tree being a um
20:19
a spying mechanism for war yeah because
20:21
this did happen the germans built a 25
20:23
foot tall tree
20:25
out of metal they cut down a real tree
20:27
put up a fake tree put a man in it
20:29
and later on the british overtook the
20:30
same area and they didn't notice for
20:32
seven months that the tree was not real
20:36
unless you went up inside it yeah i mean
20:38
they were designed they were
20:39
photographed and sketched by like
20:41
botanical experts weren't they
20:43
so that then they'd bring they'd go and
20:44
photograph the correct tree
20:46
and then they'd bring the sketches and
20:47
photographs back to base and they'd be
20:49
designed to look exactly like the tree
20:51
that they'd replaced
20:52
in the autumn did you have to kind of
20:54
drop your fake leaves
20:55
do you think yeah you would have to
20:58
wouldn't you you would have to well
20:59
you'd have to have someone climb up and
21:01
paint them
21:01
painstakingly brown over a period of
21:04
weeks
21:05
and then remove them one by one to seem
21:08
natural
21:10
but these so these are two different
21:11
types of tree disguise we're talking
21:12
about right so
21:14
these trees we're talking about were
21:15
more common i think which were trees
21:16
that you'd put
21:17
snipers or like observational posts up
21:19
inside whereas basil rapping i think was
21:20
a moving tree dressed as a tree really
21:22
was he he was just a one he was a tiny
21:24
tree like there's a charlie famous
21:26
charlie chaplin movie where he's dressed
21:28
as a tree
21:29
and he hits soldiers as they come by um
21:31
he was i think he was charlie chaplin's
21:33
mentor so maybe that's where charlie
21:35
chaplin got the idea so you're saying
21:36
chinese i've been dressed as a tree in
21:37
one of his films yeah he did it's a very
21:39
famous one
21:39
wow he was very laconic about it he just
21:41
said we brought back an awful lot of
21:43
information and a few prisoners too
21:45
that was it he did a few of these
21:46
patrols he didn't spend the whole war
21:47
dressed as a tree i imagine being
21:49
captured by a tree
21:50
yeah so he as i think dan said
21:54
he sort of volunteered to do this
21:56
because his brother had died and i think
21:58
it seems like maybe he lost respect for
21:59
his own life he was devastated at his
22:01
brother's death
22:02
but he had or thought we had a
22:03
premonition of his brother's death
22:05
because he wrote in his journal
22:06
one night that he'd woken up at one
22:08
o'clock in the morning it was june the
22:09
4th 1918
22:10
and suddenly he woke up in bed and
22:12
thought of his brother and started
22:13
crying and he didn't know why and then
22:15
he later found out that exactly that
22:16
time
22:17
um was when his brother had been killed
22:19
he wrote a fantastic letter to his
22:21
family um
22:22
if i could read it i'll read a little
22:23
bit of it to you um uh
22:26
it's dear all um bees letter arrived
22:28
this morning along with some other
22:30
things
22:30
and a parcel from aunt elfrida which
22:32
looked very promising but proved to
22:34
contain nothing but woolen underwear
22:35
of such gigantic proportions i am at a
22:37
loss for words
22:38
we have managed to fit three men inside
22:40
a single pair i wonder if this is the
22:42
intention
22:43
you must inquire and discover if aunty
22:45
made them herself i think they will make
22:46
excellent tense
22:47
do not tell her that
22:52
just a bit of nice uh so these these
22:55
huge giant tree structures
22:56
um they actually had almost i guess like
22:59
foxholes that you would enter them
23:00
through you'd go underneath them
23:02
and yeah and go into them they're really
23:03
tall they're very very tall trees
23:05
um i really like just on a bit of
23:07
nominative determinism
23:08
uh that one of the guys who sketched one
23:10
of the trees that's held in the
23:11
imperial war museum uh his name was leon
23:14
underwood
23:15
oh that's isn't that great underwood
23:17
yeah fantastic and basil rathbone's
23:19
second wife was called branch
23:21
that was her that was her surname really
23:23
yeah and so you get
23:25
fake trees around these days um which
23:27
are mobile phone masts don't you have
23:29
you seen these
23:30
right um so in probably in the 90s or
23:32
something they built a load of mobile
23:34
phone masts
23:35
around the uk and to make them look
23:38
better they decided to disguise them as
23:39
trees
23:40
but what they had to do at the same time
23:42
was build other trees around them so it
23:44
made it look more like a little cotton
23:46
forest or whatever now the problem is
23:48
what they didn't realize is that the
23:49
mobile masts that looked like trees
23:51
of course didn't grow but the trees did
23:54
grow
23:54
and so now you have loads and loads of
23:56
masts with just trees all around them
23:58
and you can't get a signal out of them
24:00
and apparently there's about 10 000
24:02
masts in the uk around with
24:04
trees completely around them that you
24:06
can hardly get any signals
24:09
in 2007 a man tried to rob a bank in new
24:11
hampshire
24:12
uh dressed as a tree
24:15
the article about this said that it was
24:17
despite the lack of other trees with
24:19
which to blend in
24:21
a bank he was in a branch oh nice
24:25
and it was on elm street as well the
24:26
true the branch of the bank oh that's
24:28
perfect
24:29
the police later found someone who
24:30
recognized him from cctv
24:32
do you think that there might be cctv
24:34
footage of say half an hour before
24:36
the actual robbery of him in a fancy
24:38
dress shop going do you have any
24:39
balaclavas
24:41
sorry we're all out mate we do have a
24:43
tree costume
24:45
damn it all right yeah yeah if you're
24:46
going to rob a bank dress up with
24:48
something that you'd find
24:49
in a bank like a person yeah that seems
24:52
like the smartest
24:53
or a biro on a little stand because then
24:55
you can get really close to the counter
24:57
without anyone noticing it but then
24:58
you'll chain to the counter forever
24:59
that's true yeah
25:00
don't go two method on it
25:02
[Laughter]
25:05
so rathbone he was um the archetypal um
25:08
sherlock holmes yes and he was also
25:10
often a villain in other movies that he
25:12
did
25:12
and he apparently is a really really
25:14
great swordsman he might be the best
25:16
ever swordsman that hollywood ever
25:18
like brought out right uh but he would
25:20
always lose because he was always the
25:21
villain
25:22
yeah and there was only one time he won
25:24
a duel
25:25
on screen in his whole career and it was
25:27
when he played tibolt in romeo and
25:29
juliet
25:30
and he got an oscar nomination for it oh
25:32
really
25:33
was that just kind of a sort of pity
25:35
thing because he had to lose so many
25:36
jewels
25:37
yeah maybe the first sherlock holmes
25:39
film was in 1900
25:41
and it was called sherlock holmes
25:43
baffled basically this guy who's
25:44
supposedly sherlock holmes walks into
25:46
his drawing room
25:47
to find that he's been burgled and then
25:49
he sees the villain
25:50
and he's about to shoot him and then the
25:52
villain just disappears and it was like
25:53
just a way of showing trick photography
25:55
at the time oh cool
25:56
in the um wikipedia thing of what
25:58
happens in the movie it says
26:00
at the very end at this point the movie
26:02
ends abruptly with holmes looking
26:04
baffled do you think it was only at that
26:07
point that the audience went oh the
26:09
title that makes sense
26:11
good reveal yeah um just one more thing
26:14
that we used for camouflage in the
26:16
first world war yeah the french used a
26:18
horse carcass disguise
26:20
okay so there was a real horse which was
26:23
dead on the battlefield
26:24
and they replaced it with i think a
26:26
papier-mache one but possibly something
26:28
a bit more robust than that but they
26:29
made a fake horse carcass left it on the
26:30
battlefield and a man crawled inside
26:32
under cover of darkness
26:33
and was able to observe any german troop
26:36
movements and he had a telephone wire in
26:37
there so he could report back
26:39
they also used uh camel dung um as
26:42
camouflage
26:42
uh this was jasper masculine who was a
26:45
magician
26:46
and according to his memoirs which were
26:47
not 100 sure we believe but according to
26:49
his memoirs
26:50
they had to mask a load of tanks which
26:52
had been painted green
26:53
because they were going to be used in
26:55
europe but actually they were being used
26:57
in egypt so they needed to be sand
26:58
coloured and in order to make them sound
27:01
colored they painted them in putrid
27:02
worcester sauce
27:04
flour and camel dung wow
27:07
wait his name was masculine yeah and he
27:08
had to mask a line of tanks
27:11
wow no it's a determinism gets
27:13
everywhere it gets
27:14
everywhere we also used to use paper
27:16
mache heads didn't we during trench
27:18
warfare
27:18
so uh they'd make a whole bunch of paper
27:20
mache heads it sounds like possibly the
27:21
most fun part of what wasn't a very fun
27:23
thing to do which was fight in the
27:24
trenches and then you just like stick
27:26
the paper mache heads up above the
27:27
parapet
27:28
and hope that they all got shot and then
27:31
you would see where the snipers were
27:32
firing from is that the idea
27:33
or where their guns were yeah or you
27:35
just it would just be like misdirection
27:36
it would just be like they'll think now
27:38
that they've defeated us because they've
27:39
just shot all our heads off um
27:41
i i was reading during world war ii uh
27:44
as part of
27:44
ways of disguising um one of the big
27:47
problems obviously german u-boats they
27:49
didn't know when they were going to come
27:50
up and if you bought a u-boat saw a
27:51
battleship
27:52
they'd be inclined not to come up
27:54
because they know the battleship had the
27:55
capability to just mow them down yeah so
27:58
uh
27:59
what they used to do was they used to
28:01
disguise their battleships as
28:03
cruisers as public members cruisers
28:06
and they would all dress up all the
28:07
soldiers the sailors would dress up as
28:10
just people who were just on a holiday
28:11
and
28:12
guys were dressed as girls and they'd be
28:13
hugging on the on the so the u-boat
28:15
would see them come up come towards them
28:17
and suddenly all the guns would come out
28:18
and then they would take down the u-boat
28:20
so once they had seen a u-boat as in
28:22
they were trying to lure it a bit closer
28:24
they had a whole rigmarole
28:25
of what to do so they would start
28:26
running around the deck as like panicked
28:28
civilians basically
28:30
and some of them would fall over and
28:31
some of them would jump into a lifeboat
28:33
and then leave someone behind by mistake
28:35
and he would be
28:35
screaming at the road saying come back
28:37
come back like all the sailors who
28:39
wanted to be an amdram but had nev
28:41
didn't have the chance because they were
28:42
at sea yeah applied for this particular
28:45
mission yeah
28:47
and what's my motivation for this
28:49
sinking i just want to know
28:51
it apparently works apparently 14
28:52
u-boats uh was sunk
28:54
as a result of this uh it's amazing this
28:56
ploy do you know that some u-boats uh
28:58
came fitted with planes
29:00
so there were genuinely u-boats which um
29:03
had little aircraft hangers on top of
29:04
them which could be sealed obviously
29:06
but when they surfaced um they had they
29:08
would open the hangar
29:10
and send up a little plane like
29:11
thunderbird yeah and it would observe
29:13
the sea all around because obviously
29:14
it's really good for observation
29:15
and then um it would land ideally near
29:18
the submarine because they'd have to
29:20
sort of tug it back in
29:21
and then put it in the hangar so it
29:22
lands on skis or something yeah exactly
29:24
yeah
29:25
it can land on water and then you yeah
29:26
how cool is that that's very cool yeah
29:28
yeah i love those things um i got one
29:30
last thing before we move on basil
29:31
rathbone didn't actually like playing
29:33
sherlock holmes
29:34
um it became the bane of his life
29:36
because everyone just it was total
29:37
typecasting everyone wanted him to be
29:39
sherlock a bit like conan doyle how he
29:41
wanted to exactly
29:42
exactly like conan doyle and he even
29:44
talked about it saying conan doyle
29:45
killed him off but i can't you know
29:47
and um at the end of his career though
29:49
he said to his wife why don't you write
29:50
a sherlock holmes play and she did and
29:53
it closed after three nights
29:55
apparently it wasn't that good but if
29:56
you look at his imdb among his last
29:58
movies ever made
29:59
uh are two that i really like called
30:01
hillbillies in a haunted house
30:04
and the ghost in the invisible bikini
30:07
wow
30:09
[Applause]
30:12
[Music]
30:13
okay time for our final fact of the show
30:16
and that
30:17
is james harkin my fact this week is
30:19
that abraham lincoln
30:21
used his stealth pipe hat to keep
30:23
important documents hidden
30:26
was this before the invention of the
30:27
briefcase i imagine it was i don't know
30:29
when was the briefcase invented yeah i
30:31
don't know but why was he using his hat
30:32
that feels like they would fall out do
30:34
you know how it works
30:35
um yeah i think there was it was in the
30:36
lining i think he had a little pocket in
30:38
there that you'd be able to keep things
30:39
so these were his top hats yeah the top
30:41
hat thing that he's really famous for
30:43
wearing yeah
30:43
it seemed like he used the top hat as a
30:45
bit of a gimmick because he was six foot
30:47
four anyway
30:48
and this top hat would give him an extra
30:49
like seven eight inches
30:51
so he would be by far and away the
30:53
tallest person in any room
30:54
yeah um and also it was always slightly
30:57
shabby which
30:58
apparently was supposed to like uh suit
31:01
his frontier image
31:03
and there was a story that um he was
31:05
shot um
31:06
by someone and it hit his hat and it
31:08
knocked his hat off but he survived and
31:10
everyone thought oh well the hat saved
31:12
his life
31:13
but actually what it meant was that he
31:15
was always much easier to spot because
31:17
he had a big
31:18
hat and it was easier for people to see
31:19
him if they wanted to shoot him they'll
31:21
just
31:21
aim for that right yeah and he because
31:23
this was the year before he was actually
31:25
assassinated he was riding on his horse
31:27
um his hat just gets knocked off the
31:29
horse goes insane rides off
31:31
one of his people go back to find the
31:33
hat and they find this big
31:35
you know gun hole through it and he's he
31:38
didn't
31:38
believe that it was someone trying to
31:40
kill him he just thought it was a
31:42
mistake
31:42
yeah he thought it was a mistake he
31:43
thought someone had let off a gun in a
31:45
distance
31:45
shooting attempting to shoot some wild
31:48
animals a wild hat a wild hat yeah
31:51
the day that he was assassinated he
31:55
there was found on his desk the
31:57
documents which
31:59
uh proposed to put the secret service
32:01
into being
32:02
which proposed to make the secret
32:03
service be a thing and the secret
32:05
service obviously now the purpose of the
32:06
secret service is
32:07
to protect the president and to try and
32:09
save his life and stop them from being
32:10
so he started it or he started the
32:12
secret service yeah actually weirdly at
32:13
the time the secret service was to solve
32:15
a fraud and you know money launches and
32:18
stuff like that
32:18
because you can imagine the day after
32:20
they're going okay bad first day
32:24
um the man who shot lincoln was john
32:28
wilkes booth
32:29
but the man who shot him was a guy
32:32
called boston corbett have you heard of
32:33
him
32:34
yeah he was the most strange and
32:37
interesting person he was a hatter
32:39
and he was genuinely a mad hatter um
32:42
did he was the reason that he shot him
32:45
because
32:45
he had shot at the wearer of one of his
32:48
precious hats
32:49
it feels like it's some kind of hat
32:51
related vengeance
32:52
it does doesn't it i don't think it was
32:55
um he had previously castrated himself
32:57
with a pair of scissors oh well they
32:59
samurai scissors
33:02
history i hope so for his sake but um
33:04
yeah and he then went for a walk before
33:06
going to hospital to think about what
33:07
he'd just done
33:08
um so just let's go to the assassination
33:10
scene for a second john wilkes booth
33:12
you're mentioning um so an interesting
33:14
connection is that
33:16
tony blair's wife cherie blair
33:19
was originally sheree booth yeah she is
33:22
directly related to john wilkes
33:24
booth really yeah she's a she's a fourth
33:26
removed cousin i believe
33:27
um and so she has a connection there
33:30
more interestingly
33:31
i think for the purpose of this podcast
33:33
on the night that abraham lincoln
33:34
was shot by john wilkes booth another
33:36
person was injured
33:38
in the commotion that followed and it
33:39
was a guy called major henry rathbone
33:42
who is related directly to basil wrath
33:46
wow
33:46
really yeah and he later died of the
33:48
wounds that he suffered from that night
33:50
from a stabbing
33:51
uh and that was basil rathbone's distant
33:55
relative oh wow
33:56
yeah the other thing is you know the um
33:58
assassination of jfk
34:00
the grassy null yeah that was basil
34:02
rathbone dressed as a grassy knot
34:07
and on the night he was assassinated
34:10
lincoln had been drinking tomato juice
34:12
because he was very high up in the
34:13
theater and at that altitude
34:15
tomato juice tastes better well he was
34:17
six foot far so he probably did taste
34:19
better
34:20
there were some hats in the georgian
34:22
period i think this is according to lucy
34:23
worsley who's just um written a book
34:26
about that period
34:27
um that were never intended to be worn
34:28
on the head uh they
34:30
look like i think that kind of
34:32
disqualifies them from being a hat
34:35
they were referred to as hats they would
34:37
bite those bicorn hats which are like
34:38
the
34:39
they've got a lot too long pointy sides
34:41
their hats at sailors where
34:42
they were made to be held under the arm
34:44
on occasions they were
34:46
impossible to wear on the head um there
34:48
were other types of bicone hat that were
34:49
designed to be collapsible in the 19th
34:51
century which i quite like
34:52
and there was one hat design which is
34:53
called the opera hat which was
34:55
collapsible so that when you went to the
34:56
opera you wouldn't
34:57
be obscuring people's vision so that was
34:59
when there were big top hats and they
35:01
were spring
35:02
loaded so that you could just collapse
35:03
them and then you'd sit on them you'd
35:05
sit on this flat collapsed hat on your
35:06
opportunity
35:09
they're very dangerous yeah what if the
35:11
spring went off while you're sitting on
35:12
it
35:14
everyone's bouncing around in a theater
35:17
jack in a box my date's just been lobbed
35:19
over the balcony
35:20
president mabuto of zaia uh banned all
35:23
leopard print hats from his country
35:25
except for his own as it wasn't on
35:26
animal rights grounds no he was the only
35:28
one allowed to
35:29
wear it and he also made a law saying
35:31
that television in zaire could not
35:33
mention anybody but him
35:34
by name that must have made a lot of
35:39
dramas very difficult or the weakest
35:41
link
35:42
so who do you think is the weakest link
35:44
i think it was that guy
35:47
which guy that guy
35:50
our university challenge
35:53
second along on the top deck
35:59
that is unbelievable how long was that
36:02
uh
36:02
he when did he die he must have died
36:04
about 10 years ago how would he be
36:05
introduced to people
36:07
look mabuto this is um this is a guy on
36:10
television
36:14
[Laughter]
36:20
what should we call this asteroid
36:23
leave it after my mistress mabuto
36:28
just other famous hats i really like
36:31
john wayne's hat
36:32
oh yeah he had a stetson yeah wore it
36:34
all the time everyone thought it was to
36:35
cultivate this constant
36:37
image of a wild western kind of cowboy
36:39
um
36:40
loved his hat so much not wanting to
36:42
take it off that he actually had his
36:44
car which was a pontiac station wagon he
36:46
had the roof
36:47
raised so that he could fit his stetson
36:49
in when he's sitting
36:50
and they still have that car i saw an
36:51
image of it it looks really cool i went
36:53
to the hat museum in stockpot
36:55
and they reckon that one of the reasons
36:58
that
36:58
hats went out of fashion is because of
37:00
the motor car because you couldn't wear
37:01
it
37:02
inside the car because all right yeah
37:03
the roof was too low
37:05
but when they went out of fashion no one
37:07
could really believe it
37:08
newspaper reports of 1948 like bemoaned
37:11
the fact that there was a new fashion of
37:13
bare-headedness
37:14
and the hat industry did some research
37:18
and they found that 84 of women
37:21
preferred men
37:22
in hats so they couldn't believe that
37:24
people had stopped wearing them because
37:26
they were so attractive
37:27
yeah i think they still i'd like to see
37:28
a poll of women now what they think of
37:30
memoring hats i reckon still most women
37:32
would say they prefer men wearing hats
37:33
we kind of fetishize that mr darcy top
37:35
hat look don't we
37:37
uh yeah but not like a backwards cap in
37:39
the context of being in
37:41
1814 or whatever do you think if someone
37:43
actually walked into the bar wearing a
37:44
mr darcy hat you think i think
37:46
yeah i'm not so into this as i thought
37:49
it's very hard to wear
37:50
any hat other than a beanie hat or a
37:51
baseball cap non-ironically without
37:55
seeming like you're trying to dress up
37:56
like you're in the 40s i'm not sure you
37:57
could get away with a baseball cap
37:59
no you're absolutely right you're
38:00
absolutely right um babe ruth always
38:02
kept a cabbage leaf
38:04
in his hat underneath his cap to keep
38:06
him cool
38:07
uh and there was a south korean uh
38:10
baseballer
38:10
called park myung kwan who also kept
38:14
frozen cabbage leaves under his cap to
38:17
keep him cold
38:18
um but he wasn't really supposed to
38:20
there wasn't really a rule but it was
38:21
kind of seen as
38:22
not very good because it was performance
38:24
enhancing cabbage
38:25
yes exactly that after
38:28
leaves fell out twice live on television
38:31
and they came up with a new rule
38:33
and now players may only wear cabbage
38:35
leaves by presenting a doctor's note in
38:37
advance
38:38
and which doctor are you gonna which
38:39
serious doctor is gonna sign something
38:41
to that effect
38:44
only doctors are in the pocket of big
38:45
cabbage will do that
38:53

00:11
hello
00:11
and welcome to another episode of no
00:13
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:15
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:17
covent garden my name is dan schreiber
00:19
i'm sitting with anna chazinski james
00:21
harkin and andy murray and once again we
00:24
have gathered around the microphones
00:25
with our four
00:26
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:28
and in no particular order
00:29
here we go starting with fact number one
00:32
that's my fact
00:33
my fact this week is that monorails were
00:36
originally
00:37
horse drawn that's really great it's
00:40
like they're ultra modern
00:41
with the not very modern at all yeah
00:44
exactly it's the future but there's a
00:45
horse attack it's like
00:47
it's everything i always wonder
00:49
spaceships are the same thing i think
00:50
yeah
00:51
exactly i've always wanted to know if
00:52
like back in that period there were
00:54
books that were just called like when
00:56
will i get my hover horse
00:57
like if they hadn't yet known about the
01:00
next bit of technology
01:01
um yeah i do and the thing i really love
01:04
about it is
01:05
all the main new inventions coming out
01:07
of that time even household stuff that
01:09
was run on qi that vacuum cleaners used
01:11
to be horse drawn as well
01:12
just everything was horse drawed we
01:14
should say why because that sounds
01:15
insane oh yes
01:16
they were yeah they were really really
01:17
really big is the idea and the
01:20
the vacuum cleaner would pull up outside
01:21
your house and they would send in tubes
01:23
yeah hoover inside the house and it
01:25
would it would suck all the dust
01:27
and the tubes were see-through so you
01:28
could see all of the crap coming out of
01:30
the house
01:31
which is quite cool because then yeah
01:32
it's like see what your neighbors
01:34
all the crap that's in yeah you don't
01:35
want to drop embarrassing stuff on your
01:37
floor
01:37
so you might end up doing that thing of
01:39
making sure all the stuff that's
01:40
vacuumed looks really expensive and nice
01:42
you know just for nosy
01:46
i've got a few more doesn't matter i
01:49
don't know if you've seen but the
01:50
jacksons have some very expensive
01:51
looking dust
01:54
so when are we talking what era this was
01:57
in 1820 and it was a guy called ivan
02:00
elmanov and this was in russia because
02:02
with the 1800s
02:04
uh like when you think about all of
02:06
these horsepowered
02:07
things it just feels like it was such a
02:09
productive time for horses
02:11
they had a lot of jobs that they they
02:13
seemed to have gone through like a job
02:14
recession recently they
02:15
because they were doing monorails they
02:17
were doing uh
02:18
obviously fire engines they were doing
02:20
trains they were they were i mean they
02:22
were everywhere and there was this
02:24
amazing
02:24
actually before i mentioned this bit
02:26
they were used in plays the first ben
02:28
hur play that they did on broadway
02:30
was done using real horses on treadmills
02:33
on the stage
02:35
yeah on these treadmills and they were
02:37
attached to these poles so that the
02:38
horses couldn't get loose and go into
02:40
the crowd but they wanted to make it a
02:41
spectacle when the audience was watching
02:43
the chariot races it's quite a spectacle
02:45
yeah it's incredible so all these horses
02:46
were lying bolting like crazy
02:49
on a movable floor so they weren't
02:50
making any ground and
02:52
and it toured the world it was it was a
02:54
huge huge play so they were in plays as
02:56
well
02:57
do you think the grand national will
02:58
ever just be on treadmills
03:00
wow it's not a bad idea yeah well it's
03:03
not a great idea
03:04
is it what's wrong with it one
03:05
disadvantage for instance is
03:07
you only have a very small amount of
03:08
place where people can watch
03:11
but on the other hand everyone there
03:13
gets a really good view of the whole
03:14
race you don't see the horses go by in a
03:16
flash
03:20
no jumps that's a problem um not with my
03:24
revolutionary moving hedge treadmill
03:27
it'd be like an okay go video
03:33
um monorail is a very old-fashioned in a
03:35
way so the official monorail well i
03:37
don't know how official it is but the
03:39
monorails website i looked at what was
03:41
the website it's monorails.org
03:43
i think on monreals.com it's one of the
03:45
two
03:46
um but there are lots of theories that
03:49
the guys who are on that website have
03:50
about why monorails are not
03:51
more popular why we're not all on a
03:53
monorail all the time
03:55
and they've said that like there is one
03:57
theory that
03:58
they espouse that people actually make a
04:00
lot more money
04:01
out of railways or that more groups of
04:03
people uh stand to make a profit out of
04:06
railways so that's why they've been
04:08
keeping monorails down it's the same
04:09
reason we don't have those
04:10
everlasting light bulbs right yeah yeah
04:14
light bulb manufacturers will go out of
04:15
business or the idea that gillette
04:17
supposedly have come up with a
04:19
blade that never dullons but they won't
04:21
sell it because then people
04:22
stop buying blades yeah i don't buy it
04:24
myself but they also say that another
04:26
problem is that people think of
04:27
monorails as being a bit
04:28
uh eccentric or quaint so it's the
04:30
disney problem
04:31
is what you've got you know that they go
04:32
around disney world or chessington world
04:34
of adventures and you know
04:35
they're not serious they aren't that
04:37
serious so are they really
04:38
i like them though but it's like someone
04:41
who rides
04:42
a unicycle just going uh i don't know
04:44
why they
04:45
everyone's not riding unicycles it's
04:47
because they make money out of that
04:48
extra wheel
04:49
[Laughter]
04:51
it's also because it's much easier to
04:52
ride a bicycle mate and it's much easier
04:54
to make a train it is monorails are
04:56
really unbalanced it's like unicycles
04:57
aren't well and they were very hard to
04:59
balance
04:59
they're not because they have saddlebags
05:01
kind of below the
05:02
level of the track and you have to admit
05:05
that it's more complicated and difficult
05:07
than just having two reasons the trains
05:09
people have got to you
05:10
know
05:10
[Laughter]
05:14
winston churchill once drove a monorail
05:17
did he yeah
05:18
for a job um in 1910
05:22
before he was prime minister it was at a
05:23
japan british exhibition
05:26
and uh the daily mail wrote it up and
05:27
said it was as interesting to him as a
05:29
new toy would be to a child
05:31
and he liked it so much that he then
05:32
persuaded the prime minister and the
05:33
chancellor to come and have a go
05:36
um and he put loads of money into
05:37
developing it and he was hugely enthused
05:39
now the money ran out eventually um that
05:41
was a nice simile
05:43
um as interesting as a tie to a child
05:45
and i have some other similes here
05:47
as useful as a coal man on a maglev
05:49
monorail
05:50
means like as useful as a chocolate
05:52
teapot or something like that
05:54
on a maglev monorail yeah because you
05:56
don't need to put coal into a monorail
05:58
because they run on
05:59
magnets or whatever there's a list of
06:01
some other as useful as
06:02
a which i found online so um these all
06:05
are things that are useless
06:07
as useful as a warm bucket of spit like
06:10
one of those really handy cold buckets
06:12
of spit
06:13
tons of use and another one this is my
06:15
favorite as useful as a hat full of
06:17
busted [ __ ]
06:19
so that's a little hat full of busted
06:21
ass a little phrase that you could use
06:23
wow wow have you guys heard of tumor
06:26
monorails
06:27
these are really there's a medical
06:28
innovation they've come up with so it's
06:30
still in the very early days but the
06:32
very tiny nanofibers which scientists
06:34
want to use to put
06:36
into the body to persuade cancer cells
06:38
to move along them
06:39
because it mimics the past that cancers
06:42
use to get
06:43
around inside the body so they latch on
06:45
the cancerous cells they get them to
06:46
other bits of the body which is either
06:48
where scientists
06:49
can cut them out more safely as where
06:51
it's less dangerous to operate
06:53
or they can even they've tried
06:54
experiments actually moving them out of
06:56
the body
06:56
and this is just on rats they've tried
06:58
and into a toxic gel
07:03
rail comics coming out of your face and
07:05
you just watch the little train
07:07
tootle out wow how do they persuade the
07:10
cancer cells to get on board they have
07:11
very cheap fares
07:15
it just looks like it looks to the
07:16
cancer cells i think like the the way
07:18
that they get around so they just assume
07:20
oh this is the route that we're going to
07:21
go on isn't that unbelievable
07:22
that's so cool and you thought monorails
07:24
were bad
07:27
they take it back that's awesome all
07:29
right uh anyone got anything else um
07:31
san diego world animal park opened in
07:33
1972
07:34
with um a monorail around the park like
07:37
a lot of things do
07:39
uh the railway was called the wagasa
07:41
bush line
07:42
uh everyone thought what gasser was like
07:43
an african name or whatever
07:45
but it actually stood for who gives a
07:47
[ __ ] anyway
07:49
because they couldn't think of a name oh
07:51
wow that feels like the end of a long
07:56
meeting
07:58
okay time for fact number two andy
08:00
murray
08:02
my fact is that the great smog of 1952
08:05
was so bad
08:06
that blind people led sighted people
08:08
home from the train station
08:10
the sighted people just could not see
08:11
where they were going it was completely
08:13
impossible
08:13
yeah that's amazing so uh the great smog
08:16
is the most extraordinary i think it was
08:18
a five-day stretch in london
08:19
specifically but it later spread across
08:21
the whole of the uk so what was it like
08:22
people burning things in their houses or
08:24
factories or
08:25
yeah a bit of a mix so people were using
08:27
coal but they were using very dirty coal
08:29
which had lots of sulfur in it and
08:30
factories were also belching out lots of
08:32
sulfur dioxide which then turned into
08:34
sulfuric acid in the air
08:36
so and all the dirty cold normally the
08:39
coal fumes would have just
08:40
gone into the atmosphere and spread out
08:41
but there was this um
08:43
layer of cold air above london which
08:44
sort of formed this
08:46
uh bubble if you like of warmer air
08:48
inside and everything just turned back
08:49
towards the ground and mixed with
08:51
moisture
08:51
so we've been um hazardous to your
08:53
health to breathe in this yes
08:56
right i think they think now that 12 000
08:59
people
09:00
died and a hundred thousand became ill
09:02
wow yeah oh my god
09:04
um there were 19 people i'm not sure if
09:06
this was the same great smug it might
09:08
have been 19 people were drowned after
09:09
unwittingly walking into the thames
09:12
yeah because they couldn't see where
09:13
they were going yeah you say you
09:15
couldn't see your feet could you
09:16
at the end of it and um bus conductors
09:18
had to get out of buses and have
09:19
flames in front of buses to guide them
09:21
down the street because it was some i
09:23
mean it was about
09:24
three feet of visibility yeah and
09:26
librarians i find this a really funny
09:28
image a
09:28
library so it got inside buildings and
09:31
library workers reported walking through
09:32
stacks of libraries
09:34
and turning a corner along the library
09:35
corridor and suddenly bumping into a
09:37
huge waft of smog
09:38
that was just sitting in their library
09:40
yeah just hanging in as a column it's
09:42
just hanging out it sounds like
09:43
something yeah
09:44
trying to check out a book yeah yeah
09:46
because like i read the sadler's wells
09:48
they had to stop a play midway through
09:49
because so much smog entered but i love
09:51
that idea
09:52
that suddenly being like whoa the
09:53
production levels of this place
09:55
phenomenal look at this and they had to
09:57
abandon dog racing
09:58
because the dogs couldn't see the hair
10:00
so they just presumably the people
10:02
couldn't see which
10:03
wanted everyone to watch
10:06
anything and they had to cancel football
10:08
matches because nobody could see the
10:10
ball
10:10
you just kick the ball and you that's it
10:12
everyone's looking for the ball and then
10:13
you know for half an hour i've been to
10:15
football matches where
10:16
they had to be cancelled for fog really
10:18
yeah and it's interesting when you're
10:20
like a fan because often you're behind
10:22
the goal and
10:23
you just can't see anything on the other
10:24
side of the pitch and you just hear a
10:26
massive cheer from the other side
10:28
you've got no idea whether it's a goal
10:29
or a table
10:31
um i like this as well so obviously very
10:34
dangerous on the railway lines because
10:35
you know there are workers on the
10:36
roadways and if you can't see a train
10:38
so train engineers what they would do
10:40
they put little explosives
10:42
on the line itself which would go off as
10:44
the train went over them like a cap gun
10:45
basically i like to make things that
10:47
kids throw on the floor
10:48
exactly yeah and then that would make a
10:50
noise so then they would notify the
10:52
workers that there was a train coming
10:53
slowly along the tracks and they could
10:54
get out of the way oh wow
10:55
yeah but that must have been because a
10:57
smog like that
10:58
wouldn't this this must have been a
11:00
really productive time of people going
11:02
okay
11:03
um blind people are now offering their
11:05
services to walk people home
11:06
at tube stations the train people are
11:08
going okay we're going to lay down like
11:11
it's very home alone isn't it like
11:12
everyone's like trying to reinvent how
11:14
you can get by
11:15
yeah in a city everything's like a 1980s
11:17
movie to you isn't it
11:20
well just think about it like no one
11:21
would have been prepared for an entire
11:23
city to be
11:24
yeah totally just actually there was
11:27
it was kind of semi-common wasn't it
11:29
that they would have these kind of
11:30
things this was the worst by miles but
11:32
yeah p supers were kind of common at the
11:34
time
11:34
yeah p super just being the nickname for
11:37
the for the fog
11:38
uh because it was as thick as pea soup
11:40
and it was greenish
11:41
apparently the greenish yellow it had
11:43
lumps of ham in it
11:44
[Laughter]
11:46
licking the air yeah no you're right it
11:48
would have been a time of ingenuity but
11:50
also like the roads were covered in
11:51
abandoned cars
11:52
because people just could not see to
11:55
drive so well
11:56
speaking of ingenuity they have quite
11:58
bagged um smog in china at the moment
12:00
especially in beijing
12:01
and the chinese state media came up with
12:03
a number of benefits
12:05
of smog in china has anyone seen these
12:07
yeah
12:08
they're really good um so one it unifies
12:10
the chinese people
12:12
which is kind of what you were saying
12:13
dan about you know everyone gets
12:15
together and has to it's like against a
12:17
common enemy yeah if you excuse the 12
12:19
000 or so deaths it's kind of a party
12:21
yeah you think about it like big massive
12:24
smoke machine yeah
12:26
it's like the beginning of matthew
12:28
kelly's stars in their eyes
12:30
that's what it is tonight matthew i'm
12:32
going to be falling in the thames
12:34
[Laughter]
12:35
another one was it makes people more
12:37
knowledgeable
12:38
brackets of things like fog
12:41
sure and also apparently it makes people
12:44
funnier oh it's because of the
12:45
the dark humor that comes with it but
12:47
obviously if you do come up with any
12:49
jokes don't put them online because the
12:50
party will find you yes
12:52
even in the smog yeah actually there was
12:54
a fire in beijing in 2013 at a furniture
12:57
factory
12:58
and no one noticed it was on fire
12:59
because the smog in the city was so bad
13:03
that's terrible i know well the thing in
13:05
china as well in beijing particularly
13:07
is that the gobi is kind of really
13:09
encroaching on china at the moment so
13:11
not only so smog and fog must be a
13:13
massive one but they get huge sandstorms
13:15
now like they have sandstorm
13:16
warnings on the weather now and they
13:19
started this plan
13:20
do you know about the great green wall
13:21
of china i do not
13:23
yeah they've been building this huge
13:24
wall of of
13:26
effectively a forest wall yeah where
13:28
they're going to try and stop the desert
13:30
from encroaching and capture all the
13:31
sand as it comes in
13:32
so it's like sand versus smog at the
13:34
moment like an alien versus predator
13:37
for 21st century china yeah they're
13:39
taking each other on
13:40
yeah you compare everything to bad 2018
13:44
films yeah like shark to puss versus
13:48
yeah um in china uh in 2013 alone
13:51
chinese consumers spent the equivalent
13:53
of 140 million dollars
13:55
on anti-smog devices which is
13:58
not great because i think aren't they
13:59
fancy they're oh they're sorry
14:02
a lot of people in china where only
14:04
about a fifth of them work so
14:06
which is kind of a shame but it's been
14:07
adopted into their fashions because
14:09
uh a couple of years ago on the catwalk
14:11
the people on the catwalk had to wear
14:13
smog masks just because
14:15
and and a designer decided to make smog
14:17
masks suddenly fashionable so
14:19
he's called yin peng and his 2015
14:22
collection includes fashionable smog
14:23
marks and they look so
14:24
cool one of them looks like the shredder
14:26
is it the shredder whoever yeah from
14:27
teenage mutant
14:28
yeah one of them looks a bit like darth
14:29
vader are they all films from the 70s
14:32
and 80s
14:33
yeah that's the theme he's going for
14:35
yeah
14:36
this is the thing um hong kong and china
14:39
are very good at doing that kind of
14:40
thing where they try and convince the
14:41
public
14:42
that it's now fashionable and and when
14:44
stars came out very similar
14:46
when stars remember when stars came out
14:49
that was first was that another 90s film
14:51
yeah so everyone was wearing the the
14:53
masks to stop themselves from
14:55
having the cops and there were like huge
14:57
rappers singing about
14:58
stars and stuff they tried to make it a
15:00
pop culture thing so that people
15:02
felt comfortable and cool wearing sounds
15:05
in your eyes
15:08
better than dancing with the tsars
15:11
um on can i say anything about sight yes
15:13
yes vision
15:14
do you guys know about forbidden colors
15:16
no i can't believe i didn't know this so
15:18
we can't see all the colors that are
15:20
available for us to see
15:21
for instance reddish green you can't see
15:24
reddish green
15:25
with your eyes but that does exist and
15:27
you also can't see
15:28
yellowish blue so that means that you
15:30
can't see a color which is
15:32
in equal parts getting more red and more
15:34
light
15:36
because our cones which are our
15:38
receptors which uh see these colours
15:40
will if they're exposing themselves to
15:42
let's say the red part of reddish green
15:44
then they will shut down the green bits
15:46
of the receptor
15:47
to allow you to properly see the red and
15:49
vice versa but we could have eyes that
15:51
could allow us to see both
15:52
and some people think there was an
15:53
experiment done in 1983 which tried to
15:55
make people see both
15:56
yeah and there is a test you can do and
15:58
some people claim that they can
16:00
see these never before seen never before
16:02
described colors
16:03
so if you just if you look up forbidden
16:05
colors or impossible colors
16:06
test you'll see it online and it's a
16:09
yellow square next to a blue square and
16:10
there are two white crosses in the
16:12
middle of each one
16:13
and if you stare at that for long enough
16:14
apparently you'll see a color that has
16:16
never before
16:17
been seen beside you i read it i read a
16:20
great thing about tiger beetles which
16:22
apparently is that they can run
16:23
so fast that they go blind is that one
16:26
world
16:27
yeah is that like exceeding the speed of
16:29
light
16:31
they exceed the speed of information i
16:32
guess to their brain that's really funny
16:34
yeah
16:35
they uh they don't gather enough photons
16:36
to make a picture of their prey
16:38
so they end up having to stop to let
16:40
their brain catch up so they're like in
16:42
pursuit running and then they'd have to
16:44
just pause
16:44
so their brain can suddenly bring the
16:46
visuals amazing yeah
16:48
they have to like sometimes they'll stop
16:49
three to four times before they actually
16:51
catch their prey
16:53
they're like the opposite of pigeons
16:54
because pigeons could see a huge number
16:56
of
16:57
as it were frames per second yeah so we
16:59
did that thing ages ago on qi that
17:01
a film in a cinema to them would look
17:03
like a slideshow they would find it
17:04
incredibly boring
17:05
yeah and this has been used by some
17:07
people to explain why pigeons don't get
17:09
out of the way as fast as we think they
17:10
should if we're driving towards them or
17:11
cycling towards them it's because
17:12
they're seeing stuff more frames per
17:14
second
17:14
so they can wait for longer um because
17:17
we slide they're in before
17:19
yeah but that's not true i crash into
17:21
them all the time
17:23
whatever this amazing sense is which
17:25
means they can escape
17:26
quicker it's not working i cycle into
17:30
pigeons
17:33
okay time for fact number three and that
17:36
is
17:37
james okay my fact this week is that
17:40
on the 24th of march 2015 the
17:43
temperature in antarctica
17:45
was higher than in malta madrid and
17:47
marrakech
17:48
so book your flights now
17:52
no that is extraordinary it was the
17:55
record temperature in antarctica so far
17:57
and it was 17.5 degrees celsius
18:00
and in all those three places it was
18:02
around 16 degrees wow
18:04
yeah so does that mean you could go out
18:06
in a t-shirt
18:07
yeah you could that is this was on the
18:09
corner it's not like in the absolute
18:10
south pole
18:11
it was on antarctica but not right down
18:14
in the center where it probably was
18:15
pretty cold
18:16
you can always go out and t-shirt that's
18:18
true you know no one's stopping no one
18:19
stopped but
18:20
yeah it's true they have that thing
18:22
called the 300 club don't they do you
18:24
know that you sit in a sauna at 200
18:26
degrees fahrenheit for as long as you
18:27
can stand
18:28
and then you go out and run around the
18:30
pole naked
18:32
and the idea is that the difference in
18:34
temperature is 300 degrees fahrenheit
18:36
and also that you pass through all 24
18:39
time zones
18:40
uh in your in the net do you need to do
18:43
passport checks at all of those
18:44
different
18:46
borders no obviously not you don't get
18:48
passport checks at time zones
18:50
no but the parts of antarctica are
18:52
claimed by different countries so
18:54
theoretically they could pull up
18:56
barriers no one respects that though
18:58
like no country they'll be like this is
19:00
ours and everyone's going it's not
19:02
it's but that's true it's like britain's
19:04
saying oh this bit's ours
19:06
and then everyone else is going no it's
19:07
not but this is ours yeah you're always
19:09
like no this bit's out it's
19:10
like no not really but this is ours
19:12
there is a i thought there was a treaty
19:14
of the antarctic which said no one owns
19:16
it but only about 50 countries have
19:17
signed it and it's probably countries
19:18
which don't have
19:19
large claims stakes equatorial guinea
19:22
yeah
19:22
that's cool we'll sign it with that
19:25
we'll be the bigger person here
19:27
in order to bolster their claim to the
19:29
antarctic uh argentina
19:30
sent a seven-month pregnant woman to
19:33
antarctica to give birth
19:35
yeah so the first baby oh
19:38
in antarctica uh was an argentinian baby
19:41
called
19:41
emil marco palmer and that was in 78 or
19:44
possibly 79.
19:45
yeah yeah i remember it was 78 i think
19:47
because it was the same year i was born
19:49
i mean i don't remember it from when i
19:51
was born even then
19:53
james was finding facts i remember
19:55
reading it and thinking that could have
19:56
been me
19:58
because the first test tube baby was in
19:59
the same year louise brown it's a big
20:01
year for celebrity babies
20:03
oh you could have been so special james
20:05
well yeah people say i am
20:07
your mom she's a good woman so it's um
20:10
that this idea that it's hotter in
20:12
antarctica isn't to say
20:14
that it's um always hotter in antarctica
20:16
um
20:17
they logged their record cold
20:19
temperature
20:20
last year as well so it's it's not to
20:22
say that everything's warming up
20:24
exactly by that amount it's a lot more
20:26
complicated than that but of course this
20:27
is
20:27
all probably down to climate change
20:30
right now though big year frank doctor
20:31
together breaking its own records
20:33
constantly and there's a guy online
20:35
um he's called maximiliano herrera and
20:38
he's a climatologist
20:40
and he has a list of all the extreme
20:42
temperature records for every nation on
20:44
earth
20:45
it's a brilliant website you know if you
20:47
like data go there
20:48
and he's found that in 2015 so far five
20:51
nations or territories have set or tied
20:54
all-time records for the hottest
20:55
temperature
20:56
wow and they are antarctica equatorial
20:59
guinea
21:00
ghana wallace and fortuna territory and
21:02
samoa
21:03
have you seen the hottest temperature
21:05
ever recorded was in
21:06
america i think it was somewhere called
21:09
furnace creek ranch
21:10
uh but on the wikipedia itself is that
21:12
just a coincidence that name
21:14
well on the wikipedia it says in
21:15
brackets after it formerly greenland
21:17
ranch
21:18
[Laughter]
21:19
i assume that they changed it after that
21:21
but i'm not sure i've been there is that
21:23
not in uh death valley
21:24
yeah yeah i've been there yeah yeah
21:28
yeah there's a sign saying you must not
21:30
go out of your cars after
21:32
10 a.m or something because it was so
21:33
hot everyone was ignoring it of course
21:35
and um the people were like throwing
21:37
eggs on the floor and stuff like that
21:39
not hygienic that's something people
21:40
never talk about when you talk about
21:41
frying eggs on a car bonnet
21:43
it may work but it's not hygienic at all
21:45
no they i don't think they generally eat
21:47
them straight afterwards
21:48
oh do they not know what do they do with
21:49
the eggs throw them away what's the
21:51
point of that i know that's
21:52
awesome i mean you could you could eat
21:55
something in a wrapper like a microwave
21:57
meal for
21:58
example on the bonnet of your car and
22:00
then at least it would be hygienic
22:01
that's dealing with anna's problem
22:02
dan please tell us the microwave fact
22:04
that you told me yesterday
22:05
oh yeah i i saw this online on national
22:08
geographic there's been
22:09
a pulse that's been detected a microwave
22:12
uh from space supposedly it could be a
22:14
pulsar or aliens even
22:16
since the 90s they've been thinking what
22:19
the hell is this thing it's been a big
22:20
mystery and it would come by every so
22:22
often they'd log it and no one would
22:24
know what it was and they've dealt with
22:25
this kind of thing with space before
22:26
mysterious signals that they eventually
22:28
find out so they've continued the search
22:29
to find out what it was and they've had
22:31
a breakthrough they now know what it is
22:33
the microwave signals were coming from a
22:35
microwave
22:37
basically on premise anytime someone
22:40
used it it would send out microwave
22:41
signals
22:42
it would register it and that was
22:43
mystery solved they would always send
22:45
the same pulses that were two minutes
22:47
long
22:47
and then a 30 second gap and then
22:49
another two minutes
22:51
a mysterious
22:55
is that did you say since the 90s yeah
22:57
and i think it's i think it's
22:58
neighboring microwaves as well
23:00
and houses around it was at parks
23:01
observatory that's where it was wow um
23:06
um so there has been some really weird
23:08
weather this year in america especially
23:09
so they've had
23:10
um down the west coast for instance san
23:12
francisco has recorded its first ever
23:14
january without rain i think and then on
23:16
the east coast it's been ridiculously
23:18
snowy this everlasting snow in places
23:20
like boston
23:21
um and they've realized scientists have
23:23
realized it's because of
23:24
the blob which is it's this warm mass of
23:27
water it's a thousand miles long and
23:29
it's sitting
23:30
off the coast of off the west coast of
23:31
america in the pacific ocean it's 300
23:33
feet deep
23:34
and it's not cooling off and it's been
23:36
there for about a year and a half and
23:37
it's just sitting there
23:38
like hot not hot it's about seven
23:40
degrees fahrenheit above
23:42
the water around it and not cooling like
23:45
um
23:45
it usually would and so this is causing
23:47
these crazy weather phenomena all across
23:49
america because of
23:50
the blob that's amazing i've never heard
23:52
that that's amazing yeah that's cool
23:53
so here's a weather thing for you go on
23:56
what
23:56
killed a third of napoleon's army on his
23:59
way to moscow in 1812
24:01
yes it was the cold snap wasn't it it
24:03
wasn't it was heat stroke
24:05
what no yeah that's not what i learned
24:08
in school
24:09
it was just as much of a problem don't
24:11
get me wrong cold was also a big problem
24:13
later on but no there was an enormous
24:15
heat wave
24:15
which killed a lot of the soldiers who
24:17
died was this going for an antarctic
24:19
style let's break two records in one
24:21
year
24:23
how do you know what to wear in the
24:25
morning
24:25
[Laughter]
24:28
nightmare you you go invading russia in
24:31
layers always that's what they're saying
24:32
so you can take them off if you have to
24:34
i've got a fleece but there's a cropped
24:35
up underneath here don't worry i'll be
24:37
fine
24:38
there's an incredible image of the
24:39
journey to and from moscow and he starts
24:41
out with 400 000 men a very very thick
24:43
line and it shows where he goes
24:44
geographically what the temperature
24:46
is along the way by the time he gets
24:47
there he's got a hundred thousand men
24:49
by the time he gets back he has ten
24:50
thousand men yeah that's incredible it's
24:52
one of the
24:52
one of the best uh infographics they
24:54
would call them these days but it's a
24:56
very very classic chart i'll try and put
24:57
it up on my twitter
24:58
yeah um because it looks unbelievably
25:00
cool wow yeah um oh sorry
25:02
no i was just gonna say i do love how
25:04
weather
25:05
in places that you antarctica is the one
25:07
place that on this podcast is constantly
25:09
mentioned
25:10
that blows me away in terms of the facts
25:12
yeah like the fact that uh
25:14
fires um fire's a problem there yes it's
25:16
a huge problem
25:17
so they have a fire service there
25:19
interesting you say blows me away it's
25:20
got a serious wind problem at the moment
25:22
because of um global issues
25:23
who does it yeah i read that it that it
25:26
suffers from horizontal avalanches but i
25:28
think that's a kind of a description
25:30
that people who are out there
25:32
it's not as dangerous or as crazy as it
25:34
sounds but they describe the idea of a
25:35
horizontal avalanche i'm guessing it
25:37
must be wind
25:38
smashing um that's weird that's so this
25:41
is another thing that's happened in
25:41
america i think that's called an ice
25:43
shove and that's it's an or it's also
25:46
known
25:46
as an ice tsunami and it is where wind
25:49
will uh for instance in a frozen lake
25:51
wind or weird water movements cause the
25:54
ice to just move like a very
25:56
slow tsunami onto the land but um it
25:59
happened last year in minnesota
26:01
and it's so weird people just woke up
26:03
and this huge wall of ice was just
26:05
creeping into their houses and creeping
26:07
up
26:07
if you watch it it moves at about a
26:09
centimeter every couple of seconds
26:11
that is still scarier than smog though
26:14
isn't it yeah like imagine walking
26:15
through a library and there's a big load
26:17
of ideas
26:18
yeah um have you heard of spontaneous
26:21
snowballs
26:22
no this is a very similar thing right
26:24
basically it's when snow rolls up and
26:25
forms a snowball on the ground
26:27
spontaneously because of the wind um and
26:29
they have a hollow center and there it
26:31
can be it could be huge there can be up
26:32
to
26:32
a foot in diameter and it's when you
26:35
have a crust of old snow which is
26:37
covered by a thin
26:38
layer of new snow on top and um if the
26:40
conditions are right a small bit of snow
26:42
gets rolled along by the wind and it
26:43
gathers more as it goes
26:45
and they have a hollow center yeah
26:47
that's amazing very cool
26:48
um i was looking at places in antarctica
26:51
there are some quite good place names oh
26:53
i was literally just about to say this
26:55
take it and tell us do one each okay
26:57
let's see who runs out first okay
26:58
okay all right yeah yeah let's go so
27:00
gotta pick my favorites now
27:02
nipple peek okay uh that's gonna be hard
27:05
to beat
27:06
yep uh knob head wait a minute are we
27:09
doing names or just insults here
27:13
knob heads good i will raise you dick
27:14
peeks similar theme
27:16
ass's ears nice uh
27:20
the office girls no one knows why
27:23
shag nasty island football mountain uh
27:26
shapeless mountain which is really
27:28
interesting because it was
27:30
like what was named that because of the
27:32
inability of the discovering team to
27:34
agree on
27:34
what its actual shape was so much so
27:37
that
27:38
shapeless mountain was a confusing thing
27:40
that when they went to climb shapeless
27:41
mountain
27:42
they climbed the wrong mountain because
27:44
they assumed it was shapeless mountain
27:46
and they ended up naming that mountain
27:47
that they mistakenly climbed mistake
27:49
peak
27:50
yeah i think i've only got mount cox
27:53
left and then i'm out
27:55
guys these names are about as much users
27:56
a hat full of busted [ __ ]
28:03
okay time for our final fact of the show
28:05
and that is chozinski
28:08
my fact is that tonga's official finance
28:10
minister
28:11
was also its official court jester
28:15
this is this guy jesse bogdanov who was
28:18
employed as a financial advisor in 1994
28:20
uh financial advisor to the government
28:22
of tonga and he was i guess he got a
28:24
promotion
28:25
actually he decided he should be court
28:26
jester it was at his own suggestion as
28:29
financial advisor he said why don't you
28:30
make me your court jester because my
28:31
birthday's april the 1st
28:33
so it seems like the obvious thing to do
28:35
it's not much of a cv that is it
28:37
why should you get this job well my
28:38
birthday's on april the 1st
28:40
it would have been better if it turned
28:41
out his birthday wasn't on april the
28:43
first it was a trick
28:44
[Laughter]
28:46
maybe it was he wasn't a very
28:48
trustworthy character slanderous i hope
28:50
he's not listening
28:51
um he did lose the country about 25
28:52
million dollars as their financial
28:54
advisor wow
28:55
yeah there was the tonga trust fund
28:57
which he was given to manage and he
28:59
invested it all in
29:00
squirty flowers
29:04
massive shoes yeah and the big shoe
29:06
index fell off a cliff a few months
29:07
later so
29:08
all those little cars
29:11
it was basically that he invested it in
29:13
questionable places and it disappeared
29:16
lost all their money and he had to flee
29:17
the country so he fled the country
29:19
uh he loves the country and he can't
29:20
return now because he says he fears for
29:22
his life i think some tongans who put
29:23
their money into
29:24
this fund were pretty angry when he lost
29:26
it all right
29:27
as cool just he was quite fun he used to
29:29
play saxophone at
29:31
um royal events and he wrote a poem
29:34
about the king
29:35
and yeah he was generally an
29:37
entertaining chap in that part
29:40
[Laughter]
29:46
so where is this guy now he's in america
29:48
he's changed his name to jesse dean
29:50
he's the founder and sole practitioner
29:52
of a company called the open window
29:54
institute of emotional freedom
29:56
in california and he does offer hypnosis
29:58
as part of it so
30:00
he can't go back because he's terrified
30:02
for his life but is he a wanted man
30:03
there or
30:04
is he um i didn't not openly i thought
30:07
he was
30:07
forced to pay back a million dollars he
30:10
was supposed to pay back a lot of money
30:12
and he still has to pay part of his
30:13
income to tonga but he never admitted
30:15
any liability right it was very nice for
30:17
him to pay it back then isn't it
30:19
nice the goodness of
30:24
because a lot of people won't know much
30:25
about tonga yeah uh tonga is 171
30:28
different islands
30:29
okay right and they're spread over 700
30:31
000 square kilometers of ocean
30:33
it's hugely spread out but only 36 of
30:35
the islands have
30:36
actually got permanent inhabitants on
30:38
them right okay yeah so lots and lots of
30:40
them are empty they used to be called
30:41
the friendly islands didn't they
30:44
they originally called that because um
30:46
james cook was given such a friendly
30:48
welcome
30:48
when he arrived there in 1773 but legend
30:52
tells
30:52
that unbeknownst to him when they were
30:54
having a big feast the only reason he
30:56
departed unscathed was because the
30:58
chiefs could not agree a plan
30:59
on how to kill him so i've been to
31:02
parties like that
31:04
they must have been kicking themselves
31:06
after he left yeah they must have been
31:07
so close okay so we're five to four
31:09
in favor of decapitation please can we
31:13
yeah it's amazing that there isn't just
31:14
okay if we don't decide on anything
31:15
here's our fallback
31:16
like how do you not have a plan b of
31:19
basic death
31:20
um between 1918 and 2006 tonga had only
31:22
two
31:23
monarchs very long reigns do we know who
31:25
the current one is no nobody knows
31:29
people have been looking into it the the
31:32
current one is george toupo the sixth
31:33
what do we know about georgetown
31:35
almost nothing no but i believe we know
31:38
some interesting stuff about george
31:39
toupee the fifth
31:40
who was quite a fun character he used to
31:43
own the island's only
31:44
power company brewery and mobile phone
31:47
company
31:50
he got he got rid of them eventually
31:51
that sounds like he was having a fun
31:52
time he sounds like an entrepreneur
31:54
was he just making drunken phone calls
31:56
all the time is that his life
32:00
he also i think it was him wasn't it who
32:02
insisted on being driven around in a
32:04
london black cab
32:05
everywhere and the reason that he gave
32:07
with this was because a london taxi has
32:09
the right proportions to make it easy
32:11
for you to get in and out whilst wearing
32:12
spurs and a sword
32:15
which i think is why we all ride around
32:16
in themselves that's why i never use
32:18
uber
32:20
i can't get my sword out of there i've
32:23
got a couple things on gestures
32:25
i don't know i don't know if anyone does
32:26
um so one thing that surprised me
32:29
is that uh i just probably very stupidly
32:32
assumed that all gestures were male
32:34
back in you know the 1500s okay
32:37
the old times uh but gestures was a
32:40
an occupation as well that's cool can i
32:43
just say that is definitely not the
32:45
stupidest thing you've ever assumed dan
32:48
okay good keep getting keep going
32:52
uh served as mary stewart's gestures wow
32:56
in 1543
32:57
and um she was there for a very long
32:59
time and she got paid very well she even
33:02
got paid
33:03
four pounds of snow every summer you're
33:05
getting paid very well i
33:07
i reckon you believe the pr i think
33:12
because if it's cocaine then four pounds
33:13
is a lot i believe i think that was
33:15
bonus
33:16
money four pounds of snow three pounds
33:18
of skag
33:19
yeah it was seen as a refrigeration yeah
33:22
you would i can see that that's useful
33:24
especially in the spring like having a
33:26
bit of
33:27
you know a bit of snow in your in your
33:30
under houses
33:31
yeah to keep things cold yeah i was
33:32
supposed so yeah tycho brahi we've
33:34
mentioned him before he had his own
33:35
jester
33:36
um who was a little person um
33:40
a dwarf um and it was his
33:43
uh own personal jester who brah he
33:45
thought possessed psychic powers and he
33:46
used to make him sit under the dinner
33:47
table while he ate dinner
33:49
and in the source i read i think it was
33:50
an i o nine which i do like the sauce
33:52
but it said
33:52
he's just had to sit under the table
33:54
while he ate dinner probably best not to
33:56
speculate why he had him do this
33:58
oh i don't think that was a necessary
34:00
comment yeah
34:02
didn't take abraha die because he
34:04
refused to leave the table
34:06
does she yeah oh my god when he needed
34:08
to pee and he never left
34:10
so maybe the um jester had enough of him
34:14
and then kind of held on to him and
34:15
stopped him from leaving and made him
34:17
die
34:18
speculating a little here but um my
34:21
other
34:21
my favorite chester that i've learned
34:23
about recently perchio of heidelberg
34:26
have you heard of him of heidelberg 18th
34:28
century in germany
34:29
his name actually was a shortening of an
34:31
italian for why not so pacquiao
34:34
so he was he was a dwarf and he was
34:36
famous for his ability to drink
34:38
and anytime he was offered a drink he
34:40
would say
34:43
why not and he would keep drinking that
34:45
was basically his main entertainment
34:47
he would just be drunk the whole time
34:49
and he supposedly lived into his 80s so
34:51
it didn't
34:51
it didn't kill him but yeah that was his
34:54
that was his one main thing there must
34:55
have been times where
34:56
his name was and where his catchphrase
34:59
was quite annoying to him
35:02
hey do you want to put this snake on
35:03
your leg [ __ ] you
35:08
do you want a punch in the face perky oh
35:11
because
35:12
saint chrysostom defined a fool as he
35:15
who gets slapped
35:16
really yeah it's a good definition isn't
35:18
it that is a good definition it's also
35:20
kind of misleading because for the role
35:22
of fools in let's say tudor courts and
35:24
late medieval courts
35:25
was to be the person who could insult
35:27
the monarch but get away with it wasn't
35:29
it
35:30
i like the trick that king james is
35:31
sixth of scotland's jester george
35:33
buchanan played on him so james vi
35:35
was really lazy about signing official
35:37
documents and he just signed them
35:38
without reading them and you know
35:39
george kept nagging him like some
35:41
annoying wife to actually read the
35:42
documents
35:43
and he wouldn't learn so george the
35:45
jester eventually went to james and made
35:47
him sign this document
35:48
which had tricked him into abdicating
35:49
the throne and giving it up to his
35:51
jester
35:51
and then he took the document away he
35:53
walked back into the room uh said to the
35:55
king oh could you just get up off your
35:56
throne for a second and then he the
35:58
gesture sat down on it
35:59
and said i'm king now by the way showed
36:01
him the document and apparently king
36:03
james vi
36:04
always read his official documents after
36:06
that but the jester was brutally
36:10
decapitated
36:11

[Music]
00:14
hello
00:15
and welcome to another episode of no
00:16
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:18
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:20
covent garden
00:21
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
00:22
here with anna chazinski james harkin
00:24
and andy murray and once again we have
00:26
gathered around the microphones with our
00:28
four favorite facts from the last seven
00:30
days and in no particular order here we
00:32
go
00:33
starting with you chozinski my fact is
00:36
that kaiser wilhelm
00:37
once lost a valuable arms contract for
00:39
germany because he slapped the king of
00:41
bulgaria on the bottom
00:44
this was a thing he did he liked to slap
00:46
people on the ass
00:47
and uh the so the king of bulgaria was
00:49
ferdinand at the time and he visited
00:51
and apparently he was wearing his
00:53
colonel's uniform which had been made
00:55
when he was a bit slimmer
00:56
so he'd put on some extra weight and he
00:58
was leaning out of the palace window in
01:00
germany
01:01
and kaiser wilhelm noticed that his
01:03
unmentionables weren't
01:05
tight and so he slapped him on there so
01:07
his unmentionables are another word for
01:09
trousers aren't they
01:10
well i think it was so the historian
01:12
says
01:13
he noticed that his unmentionables were
01:15
tight so when he leaned out of the
01:16
window he presented a mark
01:18
so tempting that the emperor
01:19
administered a resounding spank on the
01:21
sacred sea to the king anyway he was
01:22
very
01:23
very angry and he then awarded an arms
01:26
contract to someone else that had been
01:28
going to go to germany
01:29
as a result so prank kind of backfired
01:31
yeah but he did so he was a big bottom
01:33
slapper wasn't he he loved to slap
01:34
bottoms
01:35
yeah i read that he had a secret society
01:37
the white stag dining club so the idea
01:40
behind that is that when you were trying
01:41
to gain admission you'd have to tell a
01:43
vulgar joke
01:44
and then present your butt to the kaiser
01:46
who would then slap it
01:47
and then you were allowed in i already
01:49
smacked you on the bum with the flat of
01:51
his sword oh yeah oh
01:52
which is a bit important to get the flat
01:55
yeah absolutely
01:56
another death tonight of the white stag
01:58
dining club
01:59
where the king cut yet another man into
02:01
[Laughter]
02:03
was with ferdinand was that with his
02:05
hand or was it that was with his hand so
02:06
the flat of the sword was the white stag
02:08
dining club but just casually with
02:10
acquaintances it was the flap of the
02:11
hand
02:11
so just explain anna who kaiser philhelm
02:14
was so cut yeah kaiser wilhelm as you
02:16
correctly
02:17
pronounce it kaiser wilhelm the second
02:20
uh
02:20
was kaiser of germany was king of
02:23
germany until
02:25
1918 um when
02:27
there was a revolution that eventually
02:29
led to the rise of the nazis etc
02:31
yeah kaiser wilhelm ii was also the
02:34
colonel in chief of the royal dragoons
02:36
at the start of the first world war and
02:38
didn't turn up
02:39
obviously yeah for duty because he was
02:42
the kaiser of germany so there were lots
02:43
of there were lots of things like that
02:44
because the royal families were so mixed
02:46
up so he was the cousin of george v the
02:47
king
02:48
was neither cousin of this guy who he
02:49
slapped on the ass as well or they were
02:51
related
02:52
yeah yeah ferdinand yeah
02:55
oh he was the cousin of nicholas ii the
02:57
tsar of russia
02:58
it was this incredible time when
02:59
everyone was related to each other yeah
03:01
in those thoughts it's always been royal
03:03
families in europe doesn't it
03:05
they love the old incest he was
03:11
he kept some weird company and he was
03:12
into some quite camp
03:14
activities there was quite a famous
03:16
incident when he was being entertained
03:18
so he liked
03:19
to dress up he had like 400 different
03:20
military uniforms that he liked to dress
03:22
up and he changed
03:23
outfits four or five times a day he
03:24
redesigned the german military uniform
03:27
something like 37 times in 17 years
03:29
he was just obsessed with it love
03:31
dressing up i love that idea that
03:33
you know you get armies who don't really
03:35
know if they're all on the same side
03:36
yeah because they've had a redesign yeah
03:38
wait are we supposed to be killing you
03:40
yeah are you wearing march's collection
03:42
we're now in june
03:44
apparently he um whenever he had plum
03:46
pudding he always wore the uniform of a
03:48
british admiral
03:49
he was insane he was totally insane he
03:52
and
03:52
he hit other people as well in public so
03:55
he hit um the grand duke vladimir who
03:57
was a russian grand duke
03:59
on the back with the field marshal's
04:00
baton in 1904
04:02
wow i mean he he was quite wild
04:05
he didn't really respect anything um
04:09
on bomb snapping they so for chinese
04:12
lunar new year
04:13
then taoists visit this temple where
04:15
they go to get
04:16
uh ritually slapped or whipped so men
04:19
are slapped and women are whipped by the
04:21
temple staff and that means good luck
04:23
all year round
04:23
and thousands of people go to this
04:25
temple to get slapped every year wow on
04:26
the bum
04:27
on the bottom um according to the church
04:30
it is an okay thing to slap your child's
04:32
bot is it
04:34
bob as long as you call it come here
04:37
give us your bob wait is this um this is
04:40
the pope this is the yeah it's always
04:41
the
04:42
but the pope has also said if you make
04:43
fun of my mum i'll punch you in the face
04:45
what yeah he did didn't you see that no
04:47
he said this was after the charlie hebdo
04:49
thing he said um
04:50
if you make fun of my mum you can expect
04:52
a punch and then he sort of joshed with
04:53
a cardinal standing next to him
04:55
sort of miming hitting him on the face
04:58
was it a metaphor for if you
04:59
make fun of religion then people will
05:01
attack you uh yeah
05:03
so um as does buttock slap has been
05:06
copyrighted they're trademarked
05:08
so you know the adverts where they go um
05:11
they have a little jingle and then
05:12
someone slept
05:15
like that yeah um so for the purposes of
05:18
advertising meat
05:19
fish poultry game coffee tea bread
05:22
agricultural horticultural and forestry
05:24
products
05:25
and other items um you can't use a
05:28
buttock slap
05:29
unless you're asda did you say forest
05:30
tree forestry products you can't sell a
05:33
tree
05:33
with that have you never been we all
05:36
know that's the
05:39
[Laughter]
05:43
is the slap suggesting you're hitting
05:44
your wallet yeah it's like um i've got
05:46
i've spent not that much money so i
05:47
still have some money left in my back
05:49
pocket
05:49
i know i'm gonna slap it but also i
05:51
don't keep my money
05:52
safely in a purse or wallet i keep it in
05:54
loose change in my pocket
05:56
yeah that's the other implication so it
05:57
implies you're a bit fun as well
05:59
and you've got see i never read into
06:01
that second meaning i have to say i
06:02
thought dan asking about the first
06:03
meaning was quite obvious
06:07
like a dad everyone at asda has a fun
06:09
ass
06:10
yeah a thing i don't know i just thought
06:12
it was everyone needs a thing you can't
06:13
explain it sometimes you know you ask a
06:15
band why they called their band name
06:16
that they don't know i thought maybe as
06:18
they were like we don't know why we're
06:19
hitting
06:21
but it's working get complete rights on
06:23
that those [ __ ] trying to sell
06:24
trees
06:25
get them away this is ours
06:28
gotta stop buying woodland from asda
06:30
yeah okay here's the thing about the
06:32
kaiser so he had
06:33
like an intimate circle of friends and
06:35
and confidants
06:36
and apparently one account um
06:39
they were quite sycophantic and so one
06:42
count allowed himself to be led before
06:43
the kaiser
06:44
imitating a poodle with a marked rectal
06:47
opening
06:50
i don't know what that doesn't mean i
06:52
don't really know and i actually i don't
06:53
really want to know
06:54
well is that that he's he's imitating
06:56
the marks or actual opening of a poozle
06:58
or is it is the rectal opening separate
07:00
to the poodle imitation there are some
07:02
dogs where that you can see their bums
07:05
yes you know is that what it is do you
07:07
think so the ones with their tails up
07:09
yes yes but i wouldn't build that into a
07:11
fancy dress costume
07:14
it just in case someone else comes back
07:17
also there wasn't really a mention of a
07:19
costume was there
07:20
it just says he was imitating
07:24
and that's a very broad spectrum of
07:26
behavior
07:27
he also liked to sit on his horse behind
07:30
his desk because it
07:31
made him feel like yeah like a warrior
07:34
when he was doing his
07:36
his homework or his tax return or
07:38
whatever how could he have it yeah did
07:40
he have a high desk
07:41
or did he have a tiny horse
07:44
pony or did he just have a long pen
07:48
those are the only options i can think
07:50
of
07:52
he um he led military exercises so he
07:54
you know which is just
07:56
training exercises for the whole army
07:57
but obviously whenever he did that
07:59
he was so hyper masculine and so in
08:01
charge that the commander on the other
08:02
side
08:03
had to basically throw the military
08:06
exercise
08:06
and say oh you've won again kaiser
08:08
wilhelm well done
08:10
yeah you know the um really awesome
08:13
character from history annie oakley do
08:15
you know the story about annie oakley so
08:16
she was
08:17
she was part of the buffalo bill uh
08:19
touring group and she had the amazing
08:20
shot
08:22
and she was asked to shoot off the ash
08:25
of a cigarette
08:26
that was being held in the hands of
08:28
kaiser wilhelm
08:30
and she did it so from a distance she
08:32
took a shot and she managed to knock the
08:34
cigarettes
08:35
in half in his hands and people say that
08:37
had she had killed him
08:38
that may have prevented world war one
08:41
and she actually wrote to him much later
08:43
uh requesting a second shot when she
08:44
found that out
08:46
but he didn't respond when did this guy
08:48
die uh 1941 i
08:51
think okay yeah it's kind of amazing
08:53
that he got away he managed to live
08:54
through
08:55
the rise of fascism and he lived in what
08:57
country did he live in
08:58
he lived in the netherlands in exile for
09:00
a while and he kept writing to hitler at
09:01
first he started writing to hitler
09:02
congratulating him on
09:04
winning various battles with my armies
09:06
in a sort of
09:07
look we're on the same team you're using
09:08
my military and hitler was kind of like
09:10
what are you talking about you've been
09:11
missing for 20 years i overthrew you and
09:13
eventually you got quite angry so it's a
09:14
bit like i loosened the top of this jam
09:16
jar lid and
09:17
all you had to do was just yeah it was a
09:19
lot of that but he ended up hating
09:21
hitler in the nazis he did and there was
09:23
a thing about his funeral
09:24
in which he he wanted no swastikas at
09:26
his funeral but apparently his funeral
09:28
was just completely surrounded i think i
09:30
might ask for that at my future
09:34
is that a box you can take when you're
09:36
uh but surely that's a surefire way of
09:38
ensuring your funeral is stuffed with
09:40
swastikas so you wouldn't ask for no
09:42
swastikas unless you
09:43
wanted them to change the truth what are
09:45
you doing guys
09:46
no birthday this year i don't want a
09:48
birthday no birthday presents please
09:50
okay
09:51
especially no swastika wrapping paper
09:59
okay time for fact number two and that
10:01
is andrew hunter murray
10:03
my fact is that beware of pickpocket
10:05
signs attract pickpockets
10:07
they shouldn't make them so pretty no i
10:10
shouldn't festoon them with wallets and
10:12
purses
10:14
so why would that happen this is because
10:16
they have them in public places you've
10:17
probably seen them wherever you live
10:19
is that they have big signs saying
10:20
beware thieves operate in this area or
10:21
beware there are pickpockets nearby
10:23
and pickpockets like to hang out near
10:25
those signs because as soon as
10:26
someone sees that sign they will
10:28
immediately pat their pocket
10:30
or their trousers or wherever they're
10:32
keeping their personality is that
10:33
because they're just filming asda
10:34
adverts
10:37
don't steer my stuff
10:42
um and so then the thief knows exactly
10:43
where your stuff is and he can follow
10:45
you
10:45
yeah and um so if you see one of those
10:47
signs the thing to do is not go
10:48
hey let me just check my wallet still
10:50
where it was yeah so the pickpockets
10:52
one of the things they do is this has
10:54
been studied by a neuroscientist who
10:55
says basically what they do is totally
10:57
overload you with information it's not
10:58
just about where the hands are
11:00
they they're up close to you and they're
11:01
distracting you they're talking loudly
11:03
to you they're arguing with you
11:04
they're they're touching bits of your
11:06
body you're slapping a bum
11:08
um they just completely overload you
11:10
this is particularly with stage
11:11
pickpockets but the same principle
11:13
applies and it's basically because our
11:14
brains can't do more than one thing at
11:15
once
11:16
so they yeah they so if they're like
11:19
touching your bum you're like why is he
11:20
touching my bum and when you turn around
11:21
they've taken your hat
11:22
off yeah he's already in your jacket
11:24
pocket or something yeah yeah
11:26
um in 2009 a russian bank employee
11:29
gave over 80 000 of cash to a woman who
11:32
had hypnotized her
11:34
uh in the bank wow i think that i am not
11:37
sure about that
11:38
it feels like she might be the
11:40
accomplice do you think
11:42
no i just think that i was hypnotized is
11:44
often a very easy excuse for
11:45
mistakes that one has made for website i
11:48
was in the pub at the time yeah
11:50
i left the whole bank unattended
11:53
she hypnotized me to go to the pub and
11:55
stay there all day
11:57
no i don't know how she did it either
11:58
[Laughter]
12:00
i read a great robbery story uh that was
12:02
in the news i think a couple of days ago
12:04
which was a guy he uh he robbed a local
12:07
grocery
12:08
outlet and managed to get away they kind
12:10
of knew who he was though
12:11
straight away so they they were chasing
12:13
him but when he was caught the kind of
12:15
defense of going it wasn't me was
12:17
totally
12:18
knocked out by the fact that he was
12:19
carrying the money that he stole
12:21
in a canvas bag that he drawed a massive
12:23
dollar bill
12:25
the huge classic like what are you the
12:27
riddler for like 1960s batman
12:30
who carries bags like that like a double
12:32
bluff
12:33
yeah this is the last place the police
12:35
will think to look
12:38
i hope in prison that they gave him a
12:39
special outfit with arrows all over it
12:43
um there's apparently a school of the
12:45
seven bells have you guys heard of this
12:47
no for which there's um no actual
12:49
verification because people don't admit
12:51
to attending it but it's rumored to
12:52
exist in colombia and the final it's
12:54
called the school of the seven bells
12:55
because the final exam
12:56
tests the ability to noiselessly remove
12:58
items from the pockets of a jacket
12:59
rigged with bells
13:01
to make sure that you can do it without
13:02
distracting anyone's attention
13:04
how how do they know when it's time for
13:05
another lesson
13:07
[Laughter]
13:12
can i tell you briefly about this guy
13:14
called apollo robbins
13:16
yeah okay so he was the subject of this
13:18
new yorker piece and um i'll put it up
13:19
on my twitter which is
13:21
andrew hunter m which is it's and he is
13:23
a stage pickpocket
13:25
and he can steal anything basically so
13:28
he met penn of penn teller
13:30
and penn said okay go on steal something
13:32
from me and he wasn't wearing
13:34
at the time penn was wearing a sort of
13:35
sleeveless outfit and some shorts so
13:37
that's quite hard obviously there's less
13:39
to less clothing to steal from there
13:40
were fewer pockets
13:42
so he asked pen okay take off your
13:44
wedding ring put it on a bit of paper
13:45
and trace the outline with it
13:46
right so pen takes off his ring he puts
13:49
it on the paper he gets his pen out of
13:51
his pocket
13:52
and it won't write anything the reason
13:54
being apollo robbins is holding the
13:56
cartridge
13:57
from inside the pen wow yeah okay
14:00
i have an even better pickpocket than
14:02
that guy go on
14:03
are you ready so this guy is called wang
14:06
hongbo
14:07
uh and he's from zhengzhu and he has
14:09
been caught well he's been caught so not
14:11
that good but he's been caught using
14:13
chopsticks to pick pocket people
14:15
okay and he was photographed lifting the
14:18
phone from a woman's pocket
14:20
with chopsticks while she was cycling
14:28
that is skillful isn't it do you know um
14:31
cool uh pickpocket slang no so they have
14:34
a whole range of terms and exciting ways
14:36
to describe it so and some of those
14:38
mentioned in this new yorker piece
14:39
actually
14:39
um so kissing the dog is making a
14:42
mistake
14:43
not in a kaiser wilhelm poodle way
14:47
that's a mistake where you're letting
14:48
the victim see you it's always a mistake
14:53
and the skinning the poke which is
14:55
taking all the cash out of a wallet
14:56
you've nicked and then you
14:57
get rid of the fingerprints and you
14:58
throw it away um and there's the
15:00
teams are called wizmobs a team of
15:02
pickpockets it's called
15:03
whismur whiz mob yeah that sounds sounds
15:06
like sonic the hedgehog or something
15:08
it doesn't sound like a serious criminal
15:10
organization yeah it's all quite
15:11
victorian though
15:12
yeah there was some old victorian or
15:14
maybe edwardian names for
15:16
um criminals um
15:19
swaddlers was one which was people who
15:21
were methodist preachers
15:23
whose accomplices pickpocketed the
15:24
congregation they were known as
15:26
swaddlers
15:27
what a few others um bully huffs
15:31
would hang around brothels surprising
15:33
and threatening the customers by
15:34
claiming that the woman they were in bed
15:36
with was their wife
15:37
that's very clever and then extract
15:39
money from them that way
15:41
tatmungas were card sharps and body
15:44
baskets were women
15:45
posing as sellers of pornographic books
15:47
to disguise their real game which was
15:49
stealing linen off washing lines
15:52
it's
15:57
would you like to buy some erotic
15:58
literature no okay do you mind if i
16:00
leave through your garden
16:01
[Laughter]
16:06
in the 15th century ambrose paare who
16:08
was a famous doctor in the 15th century
16:11
saw a beggar in paris who was uh begging
16:13
him for money and who did so by
16:15
i don't actually know if we can put this
16:17
out it's so gross who did so by
16:19
uh she begged by lifting her skirts to
16:21
reveal a prolapsed rectum
16:24
it was a horrid sight he says it was
16:26
over half a foot long leaking past light
16:28
fluid over her legs and garments
16:30
but his companion then attacked the
16:32
woman and said
16:34
you're a big faker you don't look sick
16:36
enough to have a proliferation
16:37
you have to be pretty confident that
16:38
you're right in that situation
16:40
i know prolacts and that madame
16:45
beat this woman to the ground and
16:47
eventually she was forced to reveal that
16:49
it was actually
16:50
the pro-life rectum of an ox that she
16:52
put inside her
16:53
so he was essentially a prolapse
16:54
director it was
16:56
he felt pretty silly then didn't he
17:01
that's not a human prolapse director
17:06
it was the prelate direction of an ox
17:08
yeah that she'd put up her own bum
17:09
though
17:13
you've gone to the trouble of doing that
17:15
i really think you've earned your 50
17:16
cents or whatever definitely
17:20
but the lifting of her skirts as well
17:23
she could just have a sign saying
17:26
abstraction please help
17:28
wait so if you saw someone with a side
17:32
that's probably how she started she's
17:34
like no one is buying this at all
17:37
except andy i can show it to you no need
17:41
i absolutely believe you the thing is
17:44
though i would pay
17:46
i would pay 50p not to see a pronounced
17:50
director
17:50
that's a fair point she should have done
17:53
that
17:56
we should move on i've just got a couple
17:58
of police things um policemen in
18:01
grenada are now wearing um their twitter
18:03
handles
18:04
on their uniforms now which is not very
18:06
good protection if that's
18:08
weirdly it's it's a kind of way of
18:09
saying to the community that you
18:11
you are not going to allow us get away
18:12
with anything as much as we're not yeah
18:14
so it's like a policeman having their
18:16
own name or their number on
18:17
on a badge or something like that yeah
18:19
so you can tweet them and you can tweet
18:21
um because everyone in the town now the
18:23
police cars now have their twitter
18:24
handles they're starting to do this in
18:26
america now police cars with twitter
18:27
handles
18:28
so that people can make direct contacts
18:30
and just
18:31
let it be they're all on twitter though
18:33
like maybe there's like get constable
18:35
harris on twitter
18:38
maybe that's true and you can add them
18:40
in so you can say
18:41
i'm currently being beaten up by
18:43
constable harris
18:47
yeah is there like a really old-school
18:50
cop called nigel or something who has
18:51
his fax number on his arm
18:53
or maybe a full postal address
18:57
um one other thing is that scotland's
18:59
police force have had to ban a lot of
19:01
words
19:01
from their facebook page so this is
19:03
where social media has gone against them
19:05
slightly
19:06
so they have over 139 words that you
19:09
know
19:09
they don't appear now on their page they
19:11
swear words mostly a lot of swear words
19:13
but then they include
19:14
pigs um so if you have an issue with a
19:16
pig
19:17
that actually won't make it onto the
19:19
page stolen my
19:21
bacon yeah um
19:24
if your name is fanny you can't write to
19:26
them yeah because fatty is now a banned
19:29
word
19:29
teabag blend word is this in scotland
19:32
yeah lots of people are called fannie
19:33
and scotty i know it's a big issue so
19:35
basically the way to be a criminal in
19:37
scotland is to steal pigs off people
19:39
called funny
19:39
yeah there's nothing they can do
19:43
uh a cab is also banned sorry because
19:46
all cops are bastards
19:48
and so is bacon [ __ ]
19:52
god they're so sensitive what about mr
19:55
john bacon [ __ ] though
19:56
what about his wife funny bacon
20:00
and their son teabag
20:06
okay time for fact number three and
20:08
that's my fact my fact this week
20:10
is that no one is quite sure how to say
20:13
the name
20:14
louis armstrong or lewis armstrong no
20:17
one knows
20:18
oh right so it's either louis or lewis
20:20
yeah we're sure and armstrong though
20:21
right
20:21
we're sure and armstrong yeah but i mean
20:23
it's an insane thing that we don't know
20:25
i only found this out because i was on
20:27
louis louis armstrong's house.org it's
20:30
like a major website for him
20:32
and someone asked how do you pronounce
20:34
the name louis or lewis
20:36
and they give they go into this whole
20:37
reasoning where they say that he in
20:39
songs used to say louis
20:41
in interviews they would say louis his
20:43
friends would claim that he was called
20:45
lewis
20:46
but then his wife used to call him louie
20:48
and then things got really confused
20:49
because i think he then got called
20:50
satchmo and pops
20:51
no one knows there's no agreed opinion
20:54
despite the fact that we have
20:55
so much footage of this guy we have so
20:58
many audio recordings
20:59
no one knows but he never says he never
21:01
breaks off from a solo does he
21:04
by the way it's louis exactly
21:07
but there's a famous song called hello
21:09
dolly and he sings the line this is
21:11
lewis so everyone was like ah so it's
21:12
louis that makes sense
21:14
but then later in the song a waiter says
21:16
this is louis
21:17
so suddenly everyone's louis in the song
21:19
so
21:20
that was the one bit that sort of in
21:21
america you would normally pronounce it
21:23
lewis wouldn't you like st louis
21:25
in town and stuff like that so it feels
21:27
like it should be louis to me oh yeah i
21:29
don't know
21:29
i think one of his biographers said that
21:31
he told him
21:32
that only white people call him louie
21:35
right uh
21:36
and well his wife his wife called him
21:39
louie
21:40
was she white don't think so no oh well
21:42
was this the wife he married a
21:43
prostitute didn't he he did yes
21:45
well because he had a couple of wives i
21:46
think yeah four oh right
21:48
yeah but he had a couple of wives like
21:49
twice
21:50
[Laughter]
21:51
there's another thing just with his name
21:53
not being decided on um
21:55
they also later found out that he wasn't
21:56
born when he thought he was born
21:58
and so he thought he was born wait a
22:00
minute wait a minute he thought he'd
22:02
been born he'd just come out of the
22:03
womb yeah and he was like they're like
22:05
no you've not been born you're not being
22:06
alright
22:07
because he thought he was born on the
22:08
4th of july 1900 but it turns out he was
22:10
born august 4th
22:12
1901. now all of his kind of big fan
22:15
groups celebrate both birthdays so he's
22:17
a bit like the queen now he's got
22:18
more than one birthday per year are they
22:20
just two different people one of them's
22:22
lewis one of them
22:23
what is august they were both fantastic
22:26
jazz players
22:28
so he did only get married a couple of
22:29
times it's just the other guy who worked
22:31
a couple of times as well
22:33
um he was uh he was obsessed with a
22:36
particular laxative
22:38
louis armstrong it was cool it's called
22:40
swiss chris
22:41
and um it got sold by uh this american
22:44
dietitian called gaylord hauser
22:46
and louis armstrong would give whole
22:48
interviews about his diet and about how
22:50
fantastic this laxative was
22:51
and he said the first time i tried it it
22:53
sounded like applause
22:56
he said i had to crawl back to bed um he
22:59
wouldn't know what applause sounds like
23:00
as well
23:01
yeah and he he would post fans
23:04
um cards he had he had his diet device
23:07
printed on cards to post back to any
23:09
fans who wrote to him asking about it
23:10
and then he had specially printed cards
23:12
which had him on a toilet on the front
23:14
of it
23:14
a picture of him on the toilet and then
23:16
holding holding the bottle of swiss
23:17
christmas
23:18
in his hand he would send it back with a
23:19
free sample of swiss chris
23:21
yeah this is how devoting i think there
23:23
was a slogan on the cards wasn't there
23:24
and he had
23:25
he had this slogan printed saying satch
23:27
says leave it all behind you
23:29
yeah that's right and he never
23:33
accepted a penny from endorsing them
23:35
ever
23:36
really he was never paid he just loved
23:38
it he loved it so much he did it i love
23:40
him diarrhea
23:41
yeah every day he took it every day okay
23:43
so um
23:44
the voyager probes um which they sent up
23:47
with a record on which contains sounds
23:49
and images about earth that includes
23:52
louis armstrong music does it yep it
23:54
also has some bach
23:56
beethoven stravinsky and it has a
23:58
peruvian wedding song
24:00
which sounds good an address by un
24:02
secretary general
24:04
kurt valdhelm and uh recording
24:07
of the azerbaijani bagpipe orchestra wow
24:12
i hope they start with the bach and the
24:14
beethoven yeah
24:15
hey you've you haven't heard the
24:16
azerbaijani thing have you
24:18
i've heard bagpipes it was meant to as
24:22
well have a beatles song and all the
24:23
beatles said yes to it going on but the
24:25
record label said no
24:27
and the rumor is they said no because
24:29
they thought if suddenly there is life
24:31
out there we don't have rights to these
24:32
planets that will then be
24:34
using the song which is nuts yeah i've
24:37
signed contracts that say
24:38
like in all universes
24:42
do you think maybe when the aliens come
24:44
down to invade the first thing they're
24:46
going to do is go
24:47
um yeah can you take us to your bagpipe
24:49
orchestra please
24:51
we are massive fans
24:53
[Laughter]
24:56
um so on mispronunciation of names oh
25:00
yeah um
25:00
samuel taylor coleridge great poet
25:03
obviously
25:03
um he said the following of his name and
25:06
i can't tell whether he was taking the
25:07
mickey or not i'm not sure
25:08
but he said i think that the word cole
25:12
ridge and he brackets amphi macron long
25:15
on both sides has a noble verbal
25:17
physiognomy
25:18
it is one of the vilest beelzebub cries
25:20
of detraction to pronounce it coleridge
25:22
or coal urge or even coleridge
25:26
and in his own poems he rhymes it with
25:28
polar ridge scolarage and
25:30
the whole ridge so
25:33
that's a great nickname that sounds like
25:35
his wrestling name yeah
25:37
so he's saying anything yeah he rhymes
25:40
with everything anything goes but
25:42
he round up with anything but he also
25:43
said to say to sit long on both sides
25:45
which
25:45
coleridge no but that's the third way he
25:48
said don't pronounce it
25:50
cool ridge i have no idea how he wanted
25:52
can i just say as well why is he putting
25:53
his own name in his own poems
25:55
over you know for fun yes it's like a
25:57
rap artist yeah
26:00
so you know the word um ask or you might
26:03
say ask
26:04
and then yeah some people in london say
26:07
ox
26:08
did you ask me apparently people have
26:10
been making that mispronunciation for
26:12
more than a thousand years
26:13
what it's not a modern thing at all
26:16
that's fantastic
26:17
it is what was there to ask people about
26:20
back then what was that two arcs
26:22
it would be like can i borrow your arcs
26:25
noah's arks
26:26
[Laughter]
26:30
um can i mention something about
26:32
trumpets very quickly please do
26:34
okay so obviously louis armstrong just a
26:36
rapid background played trumpet very
26:37
famously
26:38
uh they found a trumpet in tutankhamun's
26:41
grave
26:42
so not only just his socks that we've
26:44
already got
26:45
in his name
26:49
but yeah they found a trumpet into the
26:50
carvings grave i really like that
26:52
was it from that age or was it just
26:54
something that was left there by the
26:55
original
26:57
how much harder would he break in oh we
27:00
got to go back i like my trumpet
27:02
why'd you bring a trumpet i was actually
27:04
just coming to do a gig
27:05
i went to the wrong venue it turned out
27:08
i was on the pyramid stage at
27:09
glastonbury
27:13
you know who else was a jazz star uh
27:16
romano mussolini
27:18
which i think we might have mentioned on
27:19
the show mussolini's son that is right
27:21
yeah
27:22
yeah he was a jazz pianist and he
27:23
started under an assumed name
27:25
as you would because it's such a drag
27:27
that your dad's the square fascist
27:29
dictator
27:30
um but then in the 1960s his ensemble
27:33
got
27:33
a claim and he reverted to his real name
27:35
and um
27:37
because the mussolini name had been
27:38
rehabilitated
27:41
that's a terrible time to thrust out on
27:43
your band members as well
27:44
you'll notice on the banner i've brought
27:48
[Laughter]
27:51
the article i read about him i mean he
27:53
played with dizzy gillespie and duke
27:54
ellington
27:55
and the the article i read said although
27:57
he shied away from his heritage
28:02
he wrote a memoir called in 2004 called
28:05
il ducey my father yeah
28:08
he says that mussolini was a caring
28:10
father oh really
28:12
not that that makes a difference i'd
28:13
like to stress
28:15
i don't know it's changed my opinion
28:16
about him
28:23
okay time for a final fact of the show
28:25
and that is james
28:26
okay my fact this week is the man who
28:29
holds the guinness world record
28:30
for the lowest voice can hit notes that
28:33
are so low
28:34
only elephants can hear them
28:39
how do we know how do we do that we can
28:42
well computers can hear them as well as
28:45
elephants
28:46
but yeah actually other large animals
28:47
would be able to hear them as well but
28:48
uh yeah
28:49
below human hearing range he can hit a
28:52
note which is eight
28:53
octaves below the lowest g on a piano oh
28:56
my god oh my god
28:58
i know and he did he say that he can't
29:00
really hear them
29:01
he would he can kind of you can't hear
29:02
them at all no he can't but he can kind
29:04
of feel a vibration through his body
29:06
when he when he doesn't
29:07
that's amazing wow yeah how can he sing
29:10
so low
29:11
uh he has vocal cords which are about
29:14
twice as long as a normal person
29:16
so there's a normal person sort of like
29:20
12 feet long
29:26
[Laughter]
29:35
[Laughter]
29:39
uh yeah so yeah he can he can feel it
29:42
coming through his body
29:42
which actually um you will get that with
29:45
astronauts in space
29:46
um we can pick up sounds uh from people
29:49
on the moon but it's usually the
29:50
vibrations going through the body of the
29:52
of the astronaut because there's not
29:54
enough atmosphere for the waves to
29:56
propagate
29:58
so the vibration of the helmet is brings
30:00
the sound through
30:01
wow so they they they talk by touching
30:03
helmets if they couldn't talk to each
30:04
other via
30:05
i don't know if they do that but i guess
30:06
they could do that yeah yeah no i don't
30:08
think they have done that but i think
30:09
yeah
30:09
they could yeah that's something well
30:11
the other thing is why you hear your
30:12
voice differently
30:13
from a recording to what you hear in
30:15
real life because you hear it through
30:17
your body you're not hearing it
30:18
as other people hear it which is through
30:20
the air you're hearing it through
30:22
your face so does it sound deeper to you
30:24
uh
30:25
it does sound a bit deeper to you
30:26
because it's the vibration i think so
30:28
yeah yeah
30:29
yeah cause we do [ __ ] we do fancy um
30:31
like
30:32
we're attracted to people with deeper
30:33
voices aren't well women are attracted
30:34
to men with deeper voices apparently
30:36
because it signifies a larger body size
30:38
and apparently
30:39
a study has shown men are attracted to
30:41
women with higher voices but i'm very
30:43
skeptical about that
30:44
well there are a lot of women with very
30:46
husky voices yeah and people love that
30:48
yeah so well there was a study that
30:50
found that
30:51
um people men with lower pitched voices
30:54
um had higher numbers of sexual partners
30:57
um but people with more attractive
30:59
voices actually also have lower sperm
31:01
quality
31:02
ah really is that because they're
31:04
putting all their effort into their
31:06
voice
31:06
[Laughter]
31:08
inside the body there's a guy going yeah
31:10
don't worry about the sperm let's let's
31:12
turn
31:12
all our attention to the voice yeah did
31:14
you just do it like slight italian
31:16
accent
31:16
the thing inside your body that controls
31:19
you
31:20
she's an italian guy he feels like he
31:22
has an italian inside
31:23
breaking out i'd like to stress it's not
31:27
a mussolini
31:27
[Laughter]
31:30
so elephants can tell the difference
31:31
between different human languages
31:34
so they could tell which language this
31:36
guy was singing in
31:37
at his incredibly low yeah how do we
31:40
know they
31:41
can tell they've tested two different
31:43
african ethnic groups on elephants and
31:45
those are the canberra
31:46
who are basically farmers they don't
31:48
really hunt elephants and the masse
31:50
who often had elephants they're afraid
31:52
of yeah they're afraid
31:54
of um and they were recorded saying the
31:55
same phrase uh look look over there a
31:57
group of elephants is coming and then
31:58
that was played to elephants
32:00
and when the maasai said it in their
32:01
language the elephants got spooked
32:03
um but only uh maasai men who are the
32:06
guys who do the hunting because women
32:08
and children
32:08
of either group it could be the way that
32:10
they're saying it though right because
32:12
if you're a hunter of elephants you're
32:13
going to say
32:14
look over there there's some elephants
32:16
we can hunt them whereas if you're a
32:17
farmer you're like oh my god look
32:19
there's some elephants
32:20
they're going to trample our crops yeah
32:21
look the smell is coming
32:24
i hadn't thought of that i think
32:28
i think it's evidence though it sounds
32:30
like a pretty good study but that is a
32:31
good point but that also suggests that
32:33
they understand
32:34
the words that are being said as opposed
32:35
to the tone right
32:37
what they heard the word elephants that
32:38
go oh that's us
32:40
sorry
32:48
they can also elephants they've recently
32:51
discovered can point can't they and
32:52
they're the first
32:53
uh animal that's not the top or with the
32:56
feet they can recognize pointing of
32:58
humans um so if a human points to a
33:01
bucket that has food in it then they'll
33:02
go to that one rather than the other one
33:03
and they're the only animal who aren't
33:05
apes who can do it and lots of apes
33:07
can't but they think elephants might
33:08
point with their trunks so they thought
33:10
that
33:10
they're moving their trunks around is
33:11
just you know for gags shits and giggles
33:13
but actually it's thought that they
33:14
might be pointing
33:15
at each other with that fantastic yeah
33:16
that's cool elephants can also recognize
33:18
themselves in the mirror can't they and
33:20
in fact i think sorry this is what
33:21
um we don't think anything else can do
33:23
that's not from the ape family so i
33:25
retract the last ape thing but they can
33:26
recognize themselves in a mirror and if
33:28
you put a dot on their forehead then
33:30
they will and they see themselves in the
33:31
mirror of their reflection
33:32
they will like try and get the dot of
33:34
their own forehead rather than like an
33:35
idiot like all other animals trying to
33:36
get the dot of the forehead of the
33:38
reflection in the mirror
33:39
oh okay so well done them yeah that's
33:40
quite cool also do you remember that um
33:43
because they paint don't they uh and
33:45
that was an incredible
33:46
i think it was an elephant no that's why
33:50
that's why he sold so few paintings of
33:51
his own in his lifetime
33:54
it was very messy when he cut off his
33:55
ear
33:59
sent in that huge package
34:04
um there was this amazing footage that
34:06
came out years ago of
34:08
an elephant using a paintbrush painting
34:10
an elephant
34:11
and basically everyone was going what
34:12
the hell is this and it turns out that
34:13
they were being trained
34:14
in very cruel ways to be able to do it
34:17
but they can do it and they can memorize
34:19
every single movement that they need to
34:20
do in order to paint this thing
34:22
everyone thought this was a hoax and i
34:23
think it was richard dawkins who went
34:25
out to find out about it because he
34:26
thought this is impossible and it's
34:28
absolutely true they've trained these
34:29
elephants to hold a paintbrush and paint
34:31
canvas drawings and you can buy elephant
34:33
paintings online now
34:35
that they do and they're extraordinary
34:38
don't buy them sounds like you'd be
34:39
confused yeah yeah it's massive cruelty
34:41
but like the video footage is
34:43
extraordinary to watch an elephant doing
34:44
something with
34:45
such precision as well amazing yeah
34:48
um on i've got something about voices
34:51
please
34:52
so you know the biggest hearing range of
34:54
any uh creature
34:56
can you guess a bat it's not a bat it's
34:59
um it's a bat's prey creature though
35:01
it's a moth it's a moth
35:02
is it the greater wax moth it is the
35:04
greater wax moth how on earth
35:06
did you know that i just know stuff like
35:08
that
35:10
yeah it's like it can hear something
35:12
really a noise that bats can't make or
35:13
something that's it the
35:15
in the course of evolution it has
35:17
evolved
35:18
a greater hearing range than the noises
35:20
bats make so most of bat's prey
35:22
creatures can't hear them
35:23
because they they they just get eaten
35:26
out of the air and they
35:26
have they have no defense against it but
35:28
the moth has evolved such a massive
35:30
hearing range
35:31
that um it not only not only can it hear
35:34
everything the bat does it can talk
35:36
to other wax moths in higher than uh
35:39
bats uh range it's very cool
35:40
that's so good that also that feels like
35:43
quite a good
35:44
insult for some reason saying i can hear
35:46
noises you can't even make
35:49
it's true in humans that you're hearing
35:52
of high noises decreases as you get
35:54
older
35:54
yeah which is why they had those
35:56
mosquito sounds outside shops which were
35:58
to
35:59
disperse teenagers very very high
36:00
pitched sounds um but people
36:02
my age wouldn't be able to hear them
36:04
because my little silly in my
36:06
ears have died out it's also useful if
36:08
you want to talk about sex in front of
36:09
your grandparents you could just do it
36:11
like this
36:13
would you like to go for a quick shag
36:14
right now it's a writing card here
36:18
koala voices are really low aren't they
36:21
they're 20 times lower than you'd expect
36:22
from their body size they're about as
36:24
low as an elephant's voice
36:25
and that's because the organs that make
36:27
the sound is an organ that no other
36:28
animals have it's got um
36:30
i think they've got two uh vocal pouches
36:33
instead of one which most
36:35
most creatures have two vocal folds
36:36
they're weird don't they koalas
36:38
they're just yeah like they have
36:41
the longest cecum of any animal which is
36:44
a the small intestine
36:46
called the large intestine and like
36:48
their brain is really tiny and
36:50
well the brain is not it's not
36:52
incredibly small but it is very unfolded
36:55
so it doesn't have much intricacy in it
36:57
and as a result it's got a very very low
36:58
surface area they are so stupid
37:00
it feels like they were made by a kind
37:02
of trainee
37:03
yeah because i think it sounds like the
37:05
brain and the vocal cords got confused
37:06
because
37:07
the vocal cords are very folded and the
37:09
brain is very unfolding so we obviously
37:11
thought one was the brain in its neck
37:12
the little italian inside the koalas
37:16
was drunk when he made them
37:23
there is a black hole which does the
37:25
deepest noise of
37:26
anything in nature and it does a b
37:30
flat which is 57 octaves below middle c
37:33
so this guy that we were talking about
37:35
before was eight octaves and the black
37:37
hole is 57 octaves
37:39
and if you wanted to play that on a
37:40
keyboard you'd need a keyboard more than
37:42
15 meters long
37:45
and it's only for that one note as well
37:47
really can elephants even hear that who
37:49
are you playing elephants cannot hear
37:50
that wow
37:51
yeah who is the black hole playing to
37:53
yeah and you wouldn't you would need to
37:55
something to reach it with like kaiser
37:56
wilhelm's pencil
37:59
oh an elephant's trunk maybe that's why
38:02
they have such long trunks they can play
38:04
the wider pianos that are necessary
38:06
um have you got do you guys know about
38:08
or do any of you do
38:09
this uh vocal fry do you engage in vocal
38:13
fry
38:13
i have not even heard of it not
38:14
knowingly well you might do
38:16
um so vocal fry is the lowest human
38:18
register so the guy with the highest
38:20
pitch voice on earth for instance is
38:21
singing in his whistle register
38:23
um which is the highest register which
38:24
actually the person who has the highest
38:27
pitch of singing in the world goes much
38:28
higher than the highest whistle in the
38:30
world
38:30
and anyway the vocal fry register is
38:32
your lowest register
38:34
but um it's become really fashionable
38:36
and people have started doing vocal fry
38:38
and it's that thing
38:38
66 percent of college women do it for
38:41
instance
38:42
and it's this thing where people dark
38:44
like this
38:45
you know like american girls the parents
38:47
talking like
38:48
yeah exactly paris hilton does it i
38:49
think and keisha with a dollar sign in
38:51
her name
38:53
um and apparently it's really bad for
38:55
your vocal cords it sounds like a strain
38:57
uh yeah it's about your vocal cords and
38:59
also it's bad for you
39:00
in job interviews something like 85 no
39:04
kidding i just thought you had some kind
39:06
of horrible
39:07
disease or something i want a jar i
39:10
don't understand
39:11
wait so it's not a low because it
39:12
doesn't sound is it lower it is lower
39:14
yeah and apparently this is everyone's
39:17
doing now in america
39:18
yeah interviewers are saying we don't
39:20
like this stop
39:21
stop it mid interview
39:24
i do not like this but that's how i just
39:27
thought
39:29
mr spielberg just stopped okay we're
39:32
coming to the end of the interview now
39:33
is there anything you'd like to ask me
39:38

00:09
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:11
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:14
coming to you from the q offices in
00:15
covent garden my name is dan schreiber
00:17
i'm sitting here with anna chazinski
00:19
james harkin and andy murray and this is
00:21
our uk general election special podcast
00:24
the only uk general election special
00:26
podcast out there that makes absolutely
00:28
no mention whatsoever of the uk general
00:30
election
00:31
so once again we've gathered around the
00:33
microphone with our four favorite facts
00:34
from the last seven days and in no
00:36
particular order here we go
00:39
starting with fact number one
00:41
james harkin okay my fact this week is
00:44
that the first thing
00:47
was a parliament
00:49
so the first thing called the thing the
00:51
first thing called a thing was a
00:52
paralysis of parliament
00:54
this is an etymology thing
00:57
um an etymology i think you mean
01:01
okay so let me get this right uh the
01:03
oldest known parliament which is still
01:04
going is the el thing uh which is in
01:07
iceland it's been going since the 10th
01:09
century
01:10
and that was called alfing from the
01:12
icelandic um which they used for
01:14
parliament and then in old english they
01:17
used this word thing to mean a
01:19
parliament as well
01:20
and then they used thing to mean a place
01:23
where people got together and decided on
01:24
laws and stuff like that and then a
01:26
thing was something you brought to the
01:28
parliament if you had a problem like it
01:29
was your you know my thing is that my
01:32
neighbor is stealing my goats and then a
01:34
thing became any old thing and then it
01:36
became what it is today
01:39
yes yeah make total sense for you
01:41
the journey of the scheme yeah so uh
01:44
basically i thought we'd just talk about
01:46
the history of parliaments and icelandic
01:47
parliaments in particular uh because
01:50
iceland like i said was the oldest ever
01:52
parliament it was 9 30
01:54
and it was basically everyone would turn
01:57
up to this particular part of iceland
01:59
it's actually the place where the north
02:00
american and the european continent
02:02
continents are right next to each other
02:04
you can jump from one to the other i've
02:06
been there it's quite cool oh wow uh and
02:08
that place is called thing bellia
02:12
and
02:13
and yeah it was um it was going from 9
02:16
30 to 1799 and then it was abolished for
02:19
a few years and then reinstated in 1844.
02:23
and it's been continuous ever since i
02:25
like the simplicity of the icelandic
02:27
terms like having it in thing field and
02:29
didn't they used to make their decisions
02:31
on law rock
02:33
i think which is in the middle of thing
02:34
fields when they met originally yeah oh
02:37
that's so good
02:39
um i do really like icelandic politics
02:41
mainly because of one character i've
02:42
come across and looking at this so
02:44
andy's shaking his head john gnar right
02:46
yeah yeah i don't know if i'm
02:47
pronouncing his surname right did you
02:48
read about john gennaro no jumping
02:50
hearts fantastic he basically he set up
02:52
a satirical party called the best party
02:55
and uh yeah the idea of the best party
02:57
was that he was just going to challenge
02:59
all of the things that he thought was
03:00
wrong that politicians were doing um so
03:02
part of his political promises was that
03:04
he said that everyone would get free
03:06
towels and swimming pools that's good
03:08
yeah um a polar bear for reykjavik zoo
03:11
okay all kinds of things for weaklings
03:15
what do you think that means i don't
03:16
know but i'm voting for it yeah
03:18
and he wanted a disneyland there as well
03:20
um but he um he actually got in which is
03:23
really exciting he's like a post punk
03:24
guy as well it when it's um gay pride
03:27
day he dresses up in drag um one of the
03:30
problems was with the free um towels um
03:33
he did it just as a joke but then when
03:35
he got in he realized that actually they
03:36
had to make a lot of cuts because
03:38
they've been really bad economic
03:40
problems in iceland all right so he
03:41
couldn't give free tells to people after
03:43
all so he couldn't keep much yeah he
03:45
actually doubled the price of towels
03:48
they asked him about it and he said yeah
03:50
i had to raise everything that could be
03:51
raised all service fees and no free
03:54
towels in fact double the price wow
03:57
my favorite thing of all about him is
03:59
that upon being elected he said that he
04:01
would not enter a coalition government
04:03
with anyone who hadn't watched the
04:05
series the wire on hbo
04:07
[Laughter]
04:10
so another good thing about icelandic
04:12
politics um they had the world's first
04:15
openly gay head of state
04:17
and that was joanna sigurda
04:21
and she was a lesbian and she was head
04:24
of government from the 1st of february
04:26
2009.
04:27
is pretty cool oh yeah a few other
04:29
things that iceland's really good at
04:31
they've had more nobel prizes per capita
04:34
uh than anywhere else apart from there's
04:36
a few very very very small places that
04:38
have a few more if there's only one guy
04:40
in the country
04:41
that's what i want a country where a
04:42
hundred percent of people have a nobel
04:44
prize
04:46
they have the most expensive big macs in
04:48
the world
04:49
why are they so expensive uh just
04:51
because you've got to get all the food
04:52
over there and also it's to do with the
04:54
um their currency being very very strong
04:57
yeah everything's quite expensive in
04:58
iceland how much are we talking we're
05:00
talking 510 uh well last time i got the
05:02
figures which was a few years ago now
05:04
and they've had a few troubles since
05:05
then um it was 6.67
05:07
each for a big mac and that was compared
05:09
to uh the equivalent of 3.32 in the uk
05:13
oh wow so it's twice as expensive is
05:16
that with fries
05:17
[Laughter]
05:19
meal
05:20
okay
05:22
do you know about icelandic horses
05:24
no no they're very cool are they yes and
05:27
they're very lonely it's the most
05:29
isolated breed in the world so you're
05:31
not allowed to import a horse into
05:33
iceland
05:34
ever okay um you can leave if you're a
05:37
horse but once you leave you can't go
05:38
back no way yeah because they they are
05:41
worried about the icelandic horses
05:43
getting diseases or um foreign horses
05:46
infecting them this is supposedly one of
05:47
the oldest laws in the world it was
05:50
supposedly decreed by the al thing in
05:53
982 982 which i mean no one's quite sure
05:56
because the records are obviously quite
05:58
scammed but um
06:00
it's quite it's quite difficult because
06:01
they lost about 70 of their horses in
06:04
1782 because of uh volcanic ash
06:07
poisoning oh yeah yeah so there were
06:09
slim pickings there but they've uh they
06:11
have recovered since 1782.
06:14
yeah it's difficult with icelandic
06:15
history because it kind of morphs into
06:17
the sagas quite a lot right so um until
06:20
uh 1980s the icelandic sagas were taught
06:24
as history well a lot of them are a lot
06:27
of them are historical though so they
06:28
found for instance um the history of the
06:31
fact that it was icelandic people who
06:33
first got to america there's
06:34
archaeological evidence which exactly
06:36
backs up what was in the sagas which
06:38
said that i think it's kind of half true
06:40
and half made yuppy stuff yeah that's
06:42
kind of like um sweden have we ever
06:44
mentioned the fact that swedish kings
06:46
about it was eight or nine of them are
06:48
fictional because they come from their
06:49
legends don't they so king swedish king
06:51
charles the i want to say 16th or 17th
06:54
is actually only the 11th
06:58
um here's another old old law speaking
07:00
of parliaments and laws as you were uh
07:03
since 1313 it's been illegal to wear a
07:05
suit of armor in the houses of
07:06
parliament and it still is illegal is it
07:08
so you can't do that yeah why not um i
07:11
guess because it would have seemed like
07:13
a declarat like maybe a declaration of
07:15
wall like you were going into although
07:17
weirdly it's illegal to have a suit of
07:20
armor there but they do have still on
07:22
the in the cloak room for the mps and
07:25
also in the lifts they have hooks for
07:26
your sword
07:28
apparently there was a guy who went to
07:29
the house fire recently in the list
07:32
for the tour remember in the 14th
07:34
century they had those lifts that people
07:35
used to put their socks on yeah the
07:38
invention of the lift post dates swords
07:40
going out of fashion you would have saw
07:46
you don't know what's fashionable in the
07:47
houses of parliament they're still very
07:50
in and also how long is the journey of
07:51
the lift yeah they're like i'm just
07:53
going to take the sword after the
07:55
duration
07:56
well it's a very old lift so they were
07:57
slower in those days how old is it in
07:59
the 14th century
08:02
no i don't know i think it's just must
08:04
be a customary thing apparently quite a
08:05
lot of plastic swords are
08:08
hooked onto the hangers in the
08:10
cloakrooms
08:13
um there is the uh the idea that you
08:15
have we mentioned this before that
08:16
you're not allowed to die or that it's
08:19
illegal to die in the house of commons
08:20
yes yeah that's not this is not true
08:22
isn't it so you can die there of course
08:24
you can who's going to stop you
08:27
most of the it's illegal to die no no no
08:30
sorry not illegal but it's not
08:32
recognized but it it is it is you can
08:34
die in parliament yeah no one actually
08:36
knows where that myth even comes from oh
08:38
really okay um the oh you're fighting by
08:41
etymology speaking of the english houses
08:43
of parliament the um origin of the
08:45
phrase in the bag i think one of the
08:47
best estimates of where that comes from
08:50
is from the partition bag which is the
08:52
bag that is hung on the back of the
08:53
speaker's chair is this not true i don't
08:56
know
08:57
you're looking at me really weirdly i
08:58
don't reckon it's true because i just
09:00
think it comes from there being bags
09:03
where's that pig it's in the bag
09:09
i don't mean i mean maybe it's true
09:11
maybe it's true where's that pig i can't
09:12
tell you because there's just no phrase
09:17
wait so what's it so so
09:19
parliamentary i should clarify i mean
09:21
the metaphorical meaning of in the bag
09:22
to mean um this thing that i wanted to
09:24
happen is gonna happen is from a po in
09:27
parliament there's a bag a velvet bag
09:28
that hangs at the back of the speaker's
09:29
chair it was if you wanted to lodge a
09:31
petition in parliament and you were too
09:33
shy to announce it out loud then you
09:36
dropped a little petition paper into the
09:39
in the bank
09:40
it's in the bag wow
09:43
that's very cool just a theory just an
09:44
etymological theory where's your
09:46
petition in the bag
09:48
no that's the big bag
09:55
okay time for fact number two and that
09:57
is chazinski yeah my fact is that one of
10:00
the largest majorities in a brazilian
10:02
local election was won by a rhino
10:04
so rhino got elected
10:06
well annoyingly she didn't get elected
10:09
so this was a rhinoceros called kakariko
10:11
who was a rhino at sao paulo zoo and
10:13
this was in 1958 at the council
10:15
elections and she just got this massive
10:18
majority so this campaign was started by
10:19
a bunch of students a few days earlier
10:21
um who managed to get her added to the
10:23
ballot paper and 100 000 people voted
10:27
for kakareko and the second highest vote
10:30
number of votes anyone got in that
10:31
election was ten thousand but she didn't
10:33
get elected into office in the end why
10:35
not oh because she's a writer
10:38
some little detail of bureaucracy which
10:41
bans ryan person who came second got in
10:44
yeah doesn't kakareko mean rubbish as
10:46
well yeah it means like pile of rubbish
10:48
and that's because she was mean is
10:49
because she was a really formless baby
10:52
when she was born which does seem kind
10:53
of harsh apparently she was really ugly
10:55
though the zookeeper was really harsh
10:56
about her in fact um so the idea was
10:59
that um some we're voting something so
11:01
hideous and ugly and stupid and yet
11:04
it's probably going to be better this
11:06
job than um
11:08
than a politician well i hope she had a
11:10
very scathing acceptance speech
11:12
to everyone who doubted me along the way
11:14
i'm coming for you
11:15
[Laughter]
11:17
so on animals being elected to things
11:19
okay um i can highly recommend the
11:22
wikipedia page list of non-human
11:24
electoral candidates which is very
11:26
strong um
11:28
some examples please well uh there's
11:31
and i'm quoting directly here there's
11:32
new zealand's mcgillicuddy sirius party
11:35
is the name of the party that entered a
11:37
goat in a local election uh and then it
11:39
says but their attempt to have a
11:40
hedgehog stand for parliament was
11:42
unsuccessful
11:45
also in 2001 a dachshund called saucisse
11:48
or sausage was a candidate thanks for
11:51
that by the way
11:52
in uh
11:54
in the in the municipal elections there
11:56
and he got four percent of the votes
11:57
which is a lot more than quite a lot of
11:59
fringe candidates
12:01
and then he a few years later he went on
12:02
their equivalent of big brother which is
12:04
called secret story oh i remember that
12:06
yeah and
12:07
um because the the point is that when
12:09
you enter you have to have a secret and
12:11
his secret was that he was a candidate
12:12
in an election
12:14
he had to enter under an assumed name so
12:16
he ended the house with the nickname
12:18
secret
12:20
that was his nickname yeah but if the
12:22
whole house was about every single
12:23
candidate having a secret didn't they
12:25
all have the nickname secrets
12:28
exactly
12:30
uh what else was on that list
12:32
i've got one if you want yeah and there
12:34
was a sock puppet called ed the sock who
12:37
uh attempted to run for the fed up party
12:40
during the canadian federal election of
12:42
2011. how did he fare
12:44
uh he attempted to run so i don't think
12:46
they allowed him to
12:48
it's a shame actually um one of the
12:50
people who's running against ed miliband
12:52
in this election uh for the official
12:54
monster raving looney party is called
12:56
nick the flying brick
12:59
but he's not a brick he's a human
13:01
oh okay imagine the disappointment when
13:03
you thought he was a brick you voted for
13:05
him and then it turns out to be a human
13:06
oh maybe it's a pleasant surprise it was
13:08
like i voted for a brick because it was
13:10
the lesser of two evils he turned out to
13:12
be a person it was great news yeah i
13:14
only voted for you because of the
13:15
housing crisis
13:19
um since you mentioned the monster
13:20
ravioli party so uh going back to the
13:23
kakareko rhino fact canada's equivalent
13:25
of the monster raving looney party was
13:26
called the rhinoceros party um all right
13:29
canada's equivalent of the
13:31
coincidence
13:32
no it's not it was named after kakareko
13:34
um so they had some quite funny policies
13:37
in the 80s and 90s they determined to
13:39
repeal the law of gravity to provide
13:41
higher yep uh didn't succeed as far as i
13:44
know
13:45
although we are doing this on the
13:46
ceiling which maybe
13:50
provide they said they'd provide higher
13:51
education by building taller schools
13:54
they said they'd count the thousand
13:56
islands to make sure america didn't
13:57
steal any and then they had this
13:59
platform this election platform in 1984
14:01
the rhino party of canada uh where they
14:03
declared war on belgium they said they
14:05
declare war on belgium because in an
14:07
episode of tintin a rhino had been blown
14:09
up and it turned out that rhino was
14:11
cornelius the rhino's grand mother and
14:15
cornelius the rhino was the um nominal
14:17
leader of the rhino party of canada okay
14:20
so this fictional
14:21
rhino was the cornelius sorry was a real
14:24
rhino
14:25
his grandmother was a fictional writer
14:27
yeah i don't know how that happened um
14:30
so yeah they said they declare war and
14:32
then the ambassador to canada from
14:34
belgium um decided so he made an
14:37
announcement saying i saw i had a crisis
14:38
on my hands and
14:40
the they declared war saying the only
14:42
the only way they wouldn't actually go
14:44
to war with belgium was if um the if
14:47
belgium handed over a case of mussels
14:49
and a case of belgian beer to the
14:51
rhinoceros uh delivered to the
14:52
rhinoceros hind quarters as they said
14:55
and the belgian ambassador to canada
14:56
actually you know made an announcement
14:58
saying i will hand this over i don't
15:00
want to create an international crisis
15:01
and they turned up in montreal and they
15:03
all met and they had a really great day
15:05
eating mussels and drinking beer and you
15:07
know war was averted wow yeah wow thank
15:10
you so we should really declare war on
15:13
anyone who we want free beer for
15:15
everyone the champagne region yeah yeah
15:18
they've been pissing me off for a while
15:22
um just about brazil which is where the
15:24
rhino was elected and funny people
15:26
getting themselves elected i find this
15:28
so extraordinary that recently i think
15:31
this year last year the highest number
15:33
of votes ever recorded in a
15:35
congressional election in brazil has
15:36
been recorded and won and this was won
15:39
by a clown called tiririka and so he's
15:43
just been elected to congress um for sao
15:45
paulo and yeah he's got the highest
15:47
number of votes ever received by anyone
15:48
in sao paulo his election platforms
15:50
included all his slogans including
15:52
things like if it can't get any worse
15:54
vote tirorica
15:56
what does a federal congressman do i
15:58
really don't know but vote for me and
16:00
i'll let you know if elected i promise
16:01
i'll help all brazilian families
16:03
especially mine um and he's just a
16:05
complete joke and got more votes than
16:07
anyone else in sao paulo has ever sounds
16:10
amazing yeah they're really like jibbing
16:11
at the proper election candidates don't
16:13
they yeah yeah i'm presumably quite hard
16:16
canvassing as a clown because you're
16:17
constantly saying to people shake my
16:18
hand
16:21
you don't want to be holding babies too
16:23
much
16:24
i was really surprised by the fact that
16:27
as someone who i've read tons of comedy
16:29
biographies comedians are largely my
16:31
heroes and so many comedians go into
16:33
politics there's a lot of
16:35
in america at the moment um al franken
16:37
uh he was a saturday night live writer
16:39
he's now uh he's now a politician eddie
16:41
izzard has said that he wants to run
16:43
yeah um russell brand seems to be al
16:45
murray currently in the in the election
16:48
we're not talking about he uh
16:51
um i was surprised though there's an old
16:53
comedian in america called gracie allen
16:55
gracie allen uh was one of the top
16:57
comedians of her day in america
16:59
household name and she ran she went on a
17:01
34 city tour she was running for
17:03
president
17:04
um she uh she ran as a candidate of the
17:06
surprise party
17:08
[Laughter]
17:10
kangaroo as her mascot i love that the
17:12
surprise party yeah yeah i also know the
17:14
way you delivered that really deadpan so
17:16
that's just a normal party name
17:19
yeah you could have other ones couldn't
17:20
you like um the
17:21
sex party no
17:23
why was that the first thing that came
17:24
from
17:25
the fancy dress party oh yeah the house
17:28
party yeah which is actually about
17:30
housing very important yeah but this is
17:32
what my favorite thing uh just relevant
17:34
to a conversation we had earlier so she
17:35
had a kangaroo as a mascot and her
17:37
slogan was it's in the bag isn't that
17:40
great oh yeah so speaking of famous
17:42
people becoming uh going into politics
17:45
uh of course ronald reagan was a famous
17:48
actor before he became um president um
17:50
but when he was running and the tv
17:52
stations couldn't show his films because
17:55
if they did they would have to allow
17:56
equal time to the other candidates so if
17:59
he has a movie which is like
18:01
90 minutes long or 100 minutes long the
18:03
other guy has the whole 100 minute party
18:05
election broadcast
18:07
i think they should they should have
18:08
forced one of the other guys to make a
18:10
film yes to be in a western yeah
18:14
that's a great idea
18:16
ronald reagan's secretary of state was
18:18
called donald reagan wasn't he yeah yes
18:22
that's kind of weird okay
18:23
one
18:24
similar thing which is
18:26
some animals
18:28
vote in their own elections
18:30
so they're not getting votes in our
18:32
elections they're doing their own things
18:33
so um monkeys have police
18:36
[Laughter]
18:39
well they have their equivalent let's
18:41
say and so they have peacemakers who
18:44
when there's a trouble will kind of come
18:45
in and sort it out well it sounds like
18:47
they're more like um un peacekeepers
18:50
yeah they are a bit like that but unlike
18:52
the un peacekeepers they're
18:53
democratically elected
18:55
and inferior monkeys bear their teeth to
18:57
a more dominant member of the group uh
18:59
to get elected
19:01
wow and once you're elected they have
19:02
responsibilities such as breaking up
19:04
fights
19:05
and if you remove the peacekeeper from
19:07
the group then all sorts of nonsense
19:10
happens and everyone goes crazy that's
19:11
amazing another animal who votes
19:13
sometimes is buffalo um so if you have a
19:17
load of buffalo in an area and they need
19:19
to decide which way to go they'll all
19:21
kind of stand up in turn and like do a
19:22
little stretch thing and then they'll
19:24
sit down and then put their head in a
19:26
certain direction and then once
19:28
everyone's done that whichever direction
19:30
is the most common uh the most
19:32
democratically chosen is the direction
19:34
they'll go
19:36
how do they
19:37
can they see
19:38
they can see yeah they have no but i
19:40
mean how do they see how everyone else
19:41
is voting because normally you have
19:42
someone looking over yeah you're right i
19:44
don't know if they have like a person
19:46
like collating the votes
19:48
yeah
19:49
can you spoil your ballot by shoving
19:52
your head in the ground or something
19:53
yeah
19:54
okay has anyone got anything else before
19:56
we move on um just speaking about
19:59
political animals uh like you know
20:01
non-humans um
20:03
there so i was i got really into reading
20:06
about
20:06
david cameron and george osborne's pets
20:09
and their relationships with each other
20:11
um and there's they really do have a
20:13
fascinating relationship so basically
20:15
there's the official mauser isn't there
20:16
traditionally um who is the prime
20:18
minister's cat who's supposed to keep
20:20
the mouse out might out of downing
20:21
street um so that was cameron's cat who
20:24
is called larry it was reported last
20:26
year that david cameron has rebuffed
20:27
calls for larry to resign because he's
20:29
too lazy
20:31
there was a prime ministerial dinner
20:33
recently and a mouse appeared at it um
20:35
so larry's obviously not doing his job
20:37
there were photographs taken of larry he
20:39
was just lying asleep in the corner for
20:40
the entire duration of that dinner so
20:43
larry fat cats in government
20:49
but
20:50
george osborne's cat freya um was a
20:53
stray and is an awesome mouser so ended
20:55
up sort of taking over from larry and
20:57
larry and freya became joint mouses i
20:59
think larry was sort of you know the
21:00
face of cabinet mousing but freya was
21:03
doing all the hard work and catching all
21:04
the mice and freya used to appear all
21:06
over london and used to have to be
21:10
hang on
21:11
why did freya used to appear all over
21:12
london she just liked to wander she used
21:14
to be a straight all right sorry i think
21:15
you meant election events and things
21:17
like that
21:18
it does kind of sound like the cheshire
21:20
cat as well
21:23
it also sounds like you know when a
21:24
president or a prime minister is
21:25
visiting your house the the sort of
21:27
secret service come into a sweep of the
21:29
house
21:32
that's good cameron you're good to go
21:34
mate no mine's here larry useless you
21:36
see me in the boot of the car again yep
21:37
classic larry
21:40
so
21:41
frey was once found wandering the
21:43
streets of vauxhall by a woman at about
21:45
five in the morning who was working for
21:46
a homeless charity who was trying to um
21:48
help out homeless people who were
21:49
sleeping rough so she found freya and uh
21:52
she called up the number on freya's
21:54
little collar i was like oh it's a
21:56
chance of the extractor um come and pick
21:58
up your cat please and she was quoted as
22:00
saying i did find it slightly ironic
22:02
that i've been up at 5am trying to help
22:04
24 people who've been sleeping rough in
22:06
newham and we couldn't find anywhere to
22:07
send them and then this cat gets
22:09
chauffeur driven home
22:10
um and she did use it for some strong
22:13
political satire as well she tweeted
22:15
found on the streets of vauxhall not
22:17
everyone is as lucky as freya george
22:19
please stop cutting homeless services
22:21
so if you want to make a heart hitting
22:22
political point i think find an mp's cat
22:27
and then also it sounds like freya needs
22:29
a twitter account to rebuttal and say oh
22:31
what so i'm not worth going back into
22:33
her house because she kind of sounds
22:35
like she's pissed off at freya
22:37
you're right she's taking out on freya
22:38
who's really the victim so freya's right
22:40
now been sent away to the countryside
22:41
because they got a dog
22:43
i think that means freya is dead
22:46
that's another euphemism oh my god i bet
22:49
that's true all the news reports say
22:50
that she's been sent away and looked
22:52
after really carefully by
23:04
okay time to move on to fact number
23:06
three that's my fact my fact this week
23:09
is finland's parliament sometimes makes
23:11
decisions in their sauna
23:13
oh political decisions political
23:16
decisions or just decisions like should
23:17
we get out now
23:20
no they love saunas they love saunas so
23:23
they have a sauna in the parliament yeah
23:26
they do their parliament has a sauna
23:28
they just absolutely love saunas i found
23:30
this amazing speech by a guy called mr
23:32
perti tostilla he's a secretary of state
23:35
um and he gave this speech at the
23:37
international sauna congress which oh
23:39
yeah they have and this was in 2010 and
23:42
it was actually in tokyo that he gave
23:43
this so i'm just going to read you a bit
23:45
of his speech okay ladies and gentlemen
23:47
there are about three million saunas in
23:49
finland more than one for every two of
23:52
the 5.3 million finns and did you know
23:54
that finland is a country where there
23:56
are more saunas than cars practically
23:58
all the houses in the rural areas have
24:01
saunas of their own it's hard to imagine
24:03
a finnish summer cottage by a lake
24:04
without a sauna and he goes on into
24:07
talking about how nokia has built uh
24:10
saunas for their employees in their
24:12
company's gyms uh he said finns carry
24:15
their saunas with them wherever they go
24:16
all the 98 yeah they all the 98 finished
24:19
diplomatic and consular missions in
24:21
different parts of the world have their
24:22
own saunas oh okay so yeah
24:27
our representatives here in tokyo take
24:29
pride in their two saunas the embassy
24:31
sauna in tokyo was the first finnish
24:33
sauna built in japan but certainly not
24:34
the last one i'm sure there are many
24:36
finnish saunas in today's japan and the
24:38
japanese guests and friends keep queuing
24:40
to them
24:41
they love saunas yeah i gathered them
24:44
actually although um apparently this was
24:48
a
24:49
uh statement made by an a statement a
24:51
comment made by ollie rayne who's a
24:53
finnish politician who's serving as a
24:54
european commissioner for financial
24:56
affairs and he said that with increased
24:59
emphasis on gender equality it's
25:01
becoming harder and harder to have
25:02
political discussions and meetings in
25:04
saunas because they are naked saunas so
25:06
finns don't gender mix their saunas men
25:08
or sauna in a different sort of women i
25:10
guess there is something nice about
25:11
doing a debate
25:13
with all your clothes off because it's
25:15
like you're naked you're you're kind of
25:17
letting yourself
25:18
be shown as you don't have anything else
25:20
around you you know yeah there's a story
25:22
about it i mean i don't want to see it
25:24
in the british paladin particularly yeah
25:26
let's not introduce it to podcasts or
25:27
anything
25:30
what do you mean
25:32
um there's a story about caesar doing
25:34
that in the roman senate i think it was
25:37
he someone said he's got a knife i'd
25:40
like in um crocodile dundee
25:42
and he lifted up his toga uh to show his
25:45
thigh where you would apparently keep a
25:46
knife and there was no knife there so
25:48
that was the point
25:50
but that's pretty salty
25:54
um he could have done with the knife
25:55
considering what happened later to be
25:56
honest
25:58
um
25:58
christian
26:02
that is you know ancient roman satire
26:04
just doesn't cut it
26:08
what were you gonna say oh i was going
26:10
to say that during the cold war um
26:12
khrushchev visited finland for the
26:14
president of finland's 60th birthday and
26:16
the two of them stayed in assault until
26:18
five in the morning and they came out
26:20
and they'd resolved a whole bunch of
26:22
international issues um so
26:24
um chris jeff came out and expressed his
26:26
preparedness to support finland's desire
26:28
to integrate and cooperate with the west
26:29
which is obviously quite a radical thing
26:30
for finland to want to do it at that
26:32
stage so yeah stay up till 5 a.m and a
26:34
sauna with a soviet and they will give
26:36
you concessions that's a long time to be
26:38
in a sauna i mean they might have gone
26:40
at 4 30 a.m i actually don't know the
26:41
start time
26:42
okay so that prime minister would have
26:44
been uh
26:46
right yes so the good thing about keknon
26:48
is in the 78 elections uh he won
26:51
obviously uh and they had a thing where
26:54
they read out the vote count on the
26:56
radio
26:58
as in they read out who everyone in the
26:59
country voted
27:01
and they did it in groups of five and so
27:04
there's like this long-standing kind of
27:06
joke in finland which is like kekkaden
27:08
kecking and kecking and kicking and
27:10
kicking and
27:11
kicking it
27:14
can you imagine that that has been the
27:15
best radio well not the best but
27:18
you know
27:18
that is mental did they just not have
27:20
any creative programming ideas for a few
27:23
weeks i think it was to show like show
27:25
that there wasn't any dubiousness or
27:27
anything they were saying right but here
27:28
are all the votes we're going to count
27:29
them all
27:31
all right yeah because you can't line
27:32
out an extra
27:36
it must be very hard to read out as well
27:38
because presumably if you lost count
27:40
halfway through
27:41
yeah oh my god imagine i'm sorry we're
27:43
gonna have to start again
27:46
or if this time this time definitely
27:48
definitely you know what they say ninth
27:50
time's the charm
27:56
um so
27:57
when uh this is true about them taking
27:59
them overseas so
28:00
when finnish troops have peacekeeping
28:02
jobs overseas they take a sauna with
28:05
them even if the country they're going
28:07
to is boiling hot so when they got to
28:09
the sinai desert in the 1950s they took
28:12
they built 35 saunas with including one
28:16
which had wheels and in the golan
28:17
heights they made sure that both the
28:18
israeli and syrian ambassadors had
28:20
access
28:21
to maybe though you could use it if
28:24
you're in the desert you could kind of
28:25
go in there to cool down
28:27
maybe
28:30
[Laughter]
28:36
yeah no i just think it's kind of like
28:38
the fact that um people in the north
28:41
pole use refrigerators to keep things
28:43
warm to stop things from freezing it's
28:44
amazing so it's kind of like that isn't
28:46
it yeah that is very cool there's
28:48
actually a hot tub in the south pole a
28:50
natural one a natural yes yeah it's
28:52
basically there's a volcanic-y sort of
28:55
area on one of the islands of the south
28:57
pole and um the water is it's naturally
29:00
heated and so people actually go people
29:03
who are stationed that go and actually
29:04
sit in this
29:06
natural hot tub and the italians over
29:08
there bring their own jacuzzi anyway
29:10
because it's like well we'd rather have
29:12
our own one
29:13
um the jacuzzi brothers oh yeah used to
29:17
make planes and propellers did they that
29:19
was their original line of work i guess
29:21
it's jacuzzi really isn't it yeah yeah
29:23
yeah exactly and um yeah then one of
29:26
them had a son who was very ill and um
29:28
needed i think the the sort of massage
29:30
qualities that a jacuzzi would have and
29:32
so they rigged up a very very basic
29:34
jacuzzi
29:35
just kind of a length of pipe bubbling
29:36
through some water to help his son and
29:39
it kind of took off
29:41
unlike their planes
29:45
um so in austria there's a town called
29:48
linds in austria and there's a health
29:51
and fitness center there that has had to
29:53
deploy undercover naked security guards
29:56
to infiltrate its sauna not under much
29:57
cover are they
29:59
you know
30:00
they've got to stop like hanky-panky
30:01
going on in the saunas so they're
30:02
employed to sit there naked in the
30:04
saunas and then if people start fondling
30:06
each other you have
30:12
women traditionally gave birth in saunas
30:15
did they yeah can you stop saying i know
30:17
it's the way we're supposed to say it no
30:19
i can't i never will
30:26
women traditionally gave birth in them
30:28
because the walls of a traditional smoke
30:30
sauna were lined with soot and that had
30:33
kind of bacteria resistant properties
30:35
supposedly
30:36
which made them a bit more hygienic than
30:38
uh could just line the walls of a room
30:40
that's a comfortable temperature with
30:41
such
30:45
um
30:46
so in moscow earlier on this year a man
30:49
got his testicles stolen while he was in
30:52
sauna
30:56
yeah
30:58
wow he was you put him down you put you
31:00
put him in the little lockers and you
31:01
think you're gonna be safe
31:11
[Laughter]
31:17
their own testicles
31:18
and he just picked up the wrong pair
31:21
later i'm walking down the street these
31:23
aren't mine
31:24
i please feel a bit
31:26
should i hand them in
31:30
it might have been can you describe them
31:32
any better oh they're testicles
31:36
um
31:37
so look it actually sounds like a really
31:39
horrible night for this guy he was
31:41
he started out in a bar and this woman
31:43
approached him aside talking to him and
31:45
he explained to the news station that
31:47
was interviewing him we drank a beer
31:48
together and then she suggested we go to
31:50
a sauna they went to a sauna and the
31:52
next thing he remembers is waking up
31:53
early the next morning at first the only
31:55
items he noticed were missing
32:01
[Laughter]
32:04
or his towel
32:07
seriously at first the only items he
32:10
noticed were missing were his cell phone
32:12
tablet computer and some money
32:14
it was only later when he undressed at
32:16
home that he noticed
32:18
oh my god the incision is crying oh my
32:22
god
32:23
do you ever get the feeling you're
32:24
missing something i'm sure i've got my
32:27
phone i've got my keys i've got my
32:29
wallet
32:32
oh my god
32:34
i know that's a terrible story it is
32:36
really terrible the news station did
32:38
report though do remember that he chose
32:40
to go into a snowden with this woman he
32:41
met at a bar and then you said that's
32:43
not a crime
32:47
oh god i do feel bad for making jokes
32:48
about that now that poor man i know i
32:50
really hope he's not listening i think
32:52
he's laughing wherever he is
32:53
[Laughter]
33:02
no no these guys haven't heard it come
33:04
on
33:05
how did he not noticed they said that it
33:07
had been done by a medical expert the
33:10
doctor said that it had been done very
33:11
professionally yes wow
33:14
you can get apps that tell you how to do
33:16
that anyway these days so probably
33:17
whoever stole his phone this is why it
33:19
is they were about to just leave with
33:21
the phone in the wallet and then they
33:22
were like what's this oh wow you can
33:25
this is why those ads always tell you to
33:26
check your testicles every few months
33:31
[Applause]
33:34
okay time for our final fact of the show
33:36
and that is andrew hunter murray my fact
33:39
is that in british electoral history
33:42
eight candidates have been awarded no
33:45
votes at all in a general election
33:47
competition competition
33:50
and the whistles blown
33:52
the gates are up
33:54
um so this fact comes from a book which
33:56
i don't know if you guys have heard of
33:57
it's called the book of heroic failures
33:59
by stephen pyle and it's such a classic
34:01
comedy book um it's the official
34:03
handbook of the not terribly good club
34:05
of great britain
34:06
and when it was first published it
34:08
contained an application form to join
34:10
the club and you had to give your main
34:11
area of incompetence and then a
34:13
subsidiary area of incompetence
34:15
and the club was shut down after it
34:17
received 30 000 applications for
34:19
membership and was therefore too
34:20
successful to exist
34:23
and before that stephen pyle the author
34:24
of the book was himself expelled from
34:27
the club for publishing a best-selling
34:29
book
34:30
um so this uh the first hero to achieve
34:33
this was a guy called lord gava and he
34:36
was standing as a liberal candidate in
34:37
rugget in 1832 okay and um turnout was
34:40
about 66 percent which was about 151
34:43
people in that constituency at the time
34:45
and of the 101 people who voted everyone
34:48
voted for the other guy
34:50
but there's a note in the electoral
34:51
records as i look this up and it says uh
34:53
lord governor was proposed without his
34:55
knowledge i haven't been able to find
34:57
any more so he didn't really have a
34:58
chance to campaign if he didn't know
35:00
that he was a candidate
35:03
um in ghana in 1992 there were
35:05
candidates who got zero votes quite a
35:07
few of them even though they'd voted for
35:09
themselves
35:10
and so they didn't know how obviously it
35:12
was the allegations were of electoral
35:14
fraud but yeah yeah well so they
35:17
so they actually went up and said i've
35:19
got zero votes and yet i voted for
35:20
myself how is this possible were you
35:21
allowed to vote for yourself yeah you
35:23
were alive okay supposedly in old uh
35:25
american elections in the 19th century
35:27
you weren't actually allowed to enter
35:28
the polling building
35:30
does that ring a bell with anyone did
35:31
you just have to make a paper airplane
35:33
out of your things you have to pass it
35:34
through the bars into the building and
35:37
there'll be all kinds of crowds gathered
35:38
outside isn't that busy
35:40
i need to check it you say bars and
35:42
that's just reminding me of you do have
35:44
pubs that are polling booths on you
35:47
in the uk
35:48
because anything can kind of be a
35:49
polling booth normally it's schools or
35:52
churches
35:53
did you say there was a bedroom yeah
35:55
there's one person who it's there's a
35:57
polling booth in their son's bedroom and
35:59
they get take the bed out and take all
36:01
the furniture out amazing it's just like
36:03
a loca because they don't have a local
36:05
pub or whatever i think that's amazing
36:08
or somewhere it's kind of selfish isn't
36:10
it if you're gonna do that put it in
36:11
your own bedroom
36:14
are you going to bother voting
36:19
my six-year-olds really got energized
36:21
about this election though
36:22
um that reminds me of the fact that the
36:25
division bill still rings in a couple of
36:26
pubs in the red line and another pub
36:28
near westminster doesn't it um and the
36:31
division we should say what the division
36:32
yeah so the division bell which um in
36:34
the houses of parliament calls mps to
36:36
the house to vote um so that's still
36:39
traditionally rings and still does ring
36:40
in pubs near the houses of parliament so
36:42
that mps who are drinking pints can be
36:44
like oh whoopsie daisy's got to be at
36:45
the in the house of commons and cast my
36:47
vote in five minutes apparently when the
36:49
division bell rings in the pubs tourists
36:51
in the pubs think that it's fire alarms
36:53
and frequently evacuate the building
36:55
which is another advantage of going to
36:56
those pubs yeah yeah
36:59
yeah great way of getting a seat
37:01
this is quite a weird thing control of
37:03
so if there's a dead heat in an election
37:06
then it gets just in a um general
37:08
election in a constituency then it gets
37:10
decided by either the toss of a coin or
37:12
drawing straws i think or um cutting a
37:15
deck of cards yeah so twice running in
37:17
1988 and 1992 the local council has been
37:20
decided by cutting a deck of cards how
37:22
weird is that that's so cool i really
37:24
hope it was the same person who lost
37:25
both times
37:26
[Laughter]
37:28
this time i'm going to do it oh
37:32
someone's breaking this deck
37:34
that's that's like hong kong i got this
37:36
from uh i have a feeling this is james's
37:37
fact i got it from our squire database
37:39
uh political candidates in hong kong if
37:41
they finish in a dead heat the election
37:43
is decided by luck of the draw from a
37:45
bag of numbered ping pong balls
37:47
yeah i think they have ping pong balls
37:49
in where do we have that i think in like
37:51
the national glory
37:54
bad news you've lost the election good
37:56
news you're a millionaire
37:58
i think they have it in florida and in
38:00
it's either texas or new mexico there's
38:02
one place where they do it from a hand
38:04
of poker
38:06
it must be texas
38:08
yeah texas held them yeah
38:11
um
38:12
but that's a game with skill
38:14
it's they deal one hand and it's new
38:16
mexico
38:19
yeah because you couldn't have it would
38:20
be good if you could have games of skill
38:22
like whoever's best to boggle
38:23
[Laughter]
38:26
probably should be an mp actually yeah
38:28
it's drip chess
38:29
[Laughter]
38:31
plastic sword fight
38:34
that's how we do it okay so just on some
38:36
bad candidates in elections oh yes
38:38
please have you heard of bill boakes
38:42
he was a lieutenant commander uh in the
38:44
navy and he was also the worst election
38:46
candidate ever
38:48
um he campaigned in 28 elections
38:51
and got 7 700 votes in total
38:55
wow which is not very many he lost his
38:57
deposit all 28 times
38:59
in 1951 he tried to stand against the
39:01
prime minister clement hatley but he
39:03
accidentally stood in walthamstow east
39:06
instead of walthamstow west
39:08
[Laughter]
39:12
his party was called the land sea air
39:14
road and public safety democratic
39:16
monarchist white resident and women's
39:18
party oh yeah that was quite racist
39:20
unfortunately but he um
39:22
he was he campaigned against mostly
39:24
against uh traffic accidents and in
39:26
favor of road safety and he bought an
39:28
old vauxhall which he painted black and
39:29
white to make it a mobile zebra crossing
39:33
which i love that's how people would
39:34
climb over the top of his cars across
39:36
the road so yeah
39:38
um and in 1952 his election campaign
39:40
involved fitting his car with a mast and
39:42
a mainsail
39:43
at which point he was arrested and fined
39:45
for using a vehicle for advertising
39:47
purposes in the center of town which you
39:49
weren't allowed to do then why
39:51
yeah and he said once i am nominated i
39:54
don't go back to the constituency for
39:56
one thing i can't afford to
39:59
uh he sounds great he's i mean brilliant
40:02
you know very funny there's a great
40:04
story i really like about a um a guy
40:06
called john wilkes he was running uh he
40:08
stood for parliament in barrack upon
40:10
tweed
40:11
but people bunch of people who heard
40:13
this uh when they were the opposition
40:15
they were like no way are we gonna allow
40:16
this guy to get in so they sailed up the
40:18
east coast to scuppers plans they
40:20
basically charted a boat got into it and
40:22
headed up to to ruin his chances they
40:24
were going to vote against him or yeah
40:26
they were going to vote against him but
40:27
he found out about this and he bribed
40:29
the captain of the ship so instead the
40:31
ship took them to norway
40:34
but he still lost anyway he lasted
40:40
so
40:41
here's something else from the book of
40:42
heroic failures would you like to hear
40:44
about uh mad jack mitten oh yes let's
40:46
hear about him you don't hear the other
40:48
option no no all right
40:51
um so john mitten was a 19th century
40:54
aristocrat and he was extremely
40:55
eccentric in a lot of ways but one of
40:58
the things that he wanted to do everyone
40:59
in his family got elected mp for a
41:01
shrewsbury i was just thinking just the
41:03
thing you did
41:12
so his campaigning seems to have mostly
41:14
consisted of him walking around his
41:15
constituency with ten pound notes stuck
41:18
on his hat
41:19
and people could just come up and pick
41:21
them off and someone else would replace
41:23
you know he had an assistant to replace
41:24
any notes that were taken off he spent
41:26
ten thousand pounds doing that which was
41:28
a fortune yeah an absolute fortune he
41:31
won the seat by 384 votes to 287
41:35
all these people are going cheapskate
41:37
yeah
41:39
and then on the first day he attended
41:40
parliament it was hot and he found it
41:42
boring so he left and he never went back
41:46
not nearly as interesting as walking
41:47
about town covered in ten pound notes
41:50
that's a weird job isn't it for his
41:51
assistant what do you do i'm the ten
41:54
pound note replacer yeah in my boss's
41:56
hat we don't really have any vacancies
41:57
for that at the moment
41:59
that's literally the only thing i can do
42:03
so
42:03
another 19th century
42:05
mp who i like uh is well he was from
42:09
1784 to 1830 the mp for devon was a tory
42:13
called john bastard who was then then
42:16
followed as an mp for devon by his
42:18
nephew edmund bastard
42:20
but what i like about john bastard uh is
42:23
that his name
42:26
i hadn't thought about that it is quite
42:27
a funny name
42:29
um yeah
42:30
no edmund bastard sorry inspired the
42:32
nursery rhyme old mother hubbard
42:35
so why do they call it hubbard
42:38
because you can't see children a song
42:40
old mother bastard
42:44
um
42:45
how did he inspire it so yeah his
42:47
sister-in-law was someone called sarah
42:49
catherine martin um who he instructed to
42:52
run away and write one of your stupid
42:53
little rhymes when she was um behaving
42:56
badly in the town or something she was
42:58
going out with a floundering with a man
42:59
she shouldn't have been right so he told
43:00
her to go away right stupid little
43:02
rhymes oh mother hubbard and that was
43:04
that
43:05
is that inspiring someone to write
43:07
something it was her muse
43:10
uh who's the mysterious other person on
43:13
your list oh that's the earl of
43:14
leicester who the fifth earl of
43:15
leicester who was a member of the house
43:17
of lords he didn't say anything for 22
43:19
years
43:20
he was going to speak about capital
43:22
punishment and then he changed his mind
43:31
[Applause]

00:52
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:54
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:57
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:58
covent garden my name is dan schreiber
01:00
i'm sitting here with james harkin anna
01:02
chazinski andy murray and we have a
01:05
special guest today it's the founder
01:06
creator of qi it's commander john lloyd
01:09
and once again we have gathered around
01:11
our microphones with our four favorite
01:12
facts from the last seven days and in no
01:14
particular order here we go
01:17
starting with you
01:19
james harkin
01:20
okay my fact this week is that the final
01:24
mcdonald's burger ever sold in iceland
01:26
can currently be watched decomposing on
01:29
a webcam
01:30
is that
01:32
in accordance with a statement that
01:33
might have been made last week i don't
01:36
know what you're talking about
01:38
yes last week i may well have said that
01:40
iceland has the most expensive
01:42
mcdonald's burgers and but there has
01:44
been no mcdonald's in iceland since 2009
01:47
a fact that everyone has been very
01:48
willing to point out and that doesn't
01:50
explain why they're so expensive because
01:51
of scarcity value
01:54
no more mcdonald's in iceland and the
01:56
last one they kept put it in a museum
01:58
and now it's in a hostel under a webcam
02:00
how's it looking
02:02
it's looking fine because burgers tend
02:03
to not decompose very much i yeah so i
02:06
read that because there's some father
02:08
who's got really outraged didn't he he
02:10
put one of his kids mcdonald's burgers
02:12
in a jar or something and filmed it over
02:15
the course of weeks and weeks and months
02:16
and months and said isn't this
02:17
outrageous this hasn't rotted at all and
02:19
mcdonald's i think ended up i assume
02:21
having to be the first franchise ever to
02:23
protest our food does rot honestly
02:27
please believe us but yeah they don't
02:28
rot and it's like if it doesn't have
02:30
access to the fluids that allow the
02:31
bacteria to thrive then they just go on
02:33
for years if you keep it dry and you
02:34
keep no animals near it or bacteria in
02:37
there or whatever then it'll be fine i
02:38
like the fact that it's on a webcam as
02:40
well 24 hours a day yeah that's good do
02:42
you know there are webcams where you can
02:43
actually watch paint dry have you seen
02:45
that paint paint here there's one a
02:47
paint peeling website and there's a
02:49
grass growing website
02:51
and there's uh one we can or you could
02:53
see a cheddar cheese mature
02:55
[Laughter]
02:56
and it was on for a year which you know
02:58
how long this cheese takes to mature and
03:00
the cheese was known as reginald
03:02
apparently
03:04
and it got used to get valentine's cards
03:06
from america and a signed rugby ball
03:08
from the british rugby team the cheese
03:11
the cheese yeah they had a million fans
03:13
did they possibly read mature and think
03:15
it was some other kind of online thing
03:18
adult cheese
03:20
x-rated
03:21
cheddar
03:23
i had uh breakfast by cancer days when a
03:25
guy used to work on the mcdonald's
03:27
advertising account oh really and he
03:29
said that when they launched their i'm
03:31
loving it which i think is a terrible
03:33
slogan i'm loving that campaign
03:35
they had 30 000 parties all over the
03:38
world simultaneously it's a world record
03:40
for a number of simultaneously held
03:42
parties because they've got 34 000
03:44
uh restaurants as they call them in the
03:46
world always his wrong restaurants
03:47
doesn't it yeah what would you call them
03:50
joints
03:51
and i looked up some i looked up some of
03:53
these 34 000 outlets
03:56
and here they are number one
04:01
the mcdonald's in roswell new mexico is
04:04
the only one in the world shaped like a
04:05
ufo really actually just think about
04:07
ufos look a bit like burgers anyway
04:10
perhaps it's an accident
04:13
and there's a ski through mcdonald's in
04:15
sweden in linvallen and sweden
04:18
is there a hundred yards between the
04:20
order microphone and the bit where you
04:22
pick it up
04:23
to give them time to prepare it
04:27
did you also see about the uh the
04:29
world's most expensive burger which i
04:30
think came out this month
04:32
it's called the glam burger and it's
04:34
available at honky tonk restaurant
04:36
chelsea which is not an ad
04:38
and it uses in the burger is canadian
04:41
lobster new zealand venison kobe beef
04:43
breakfast black truffle breeze champagne
04:45
iranian saffron himalayan salt beluga
04:48
caviar and hickory smoked duck egg
04:50
covered in edible gold leaf
04:53
the bun is also covered in gold leaf and
04:55
it costs 1
04:56
100 pounds is that with fries
05:00
fries are extra it's 1 100 299
05:04
for the meal
05:06
okay so you were saying about expensive
05:08
burgers i read an article saying that
05:11
burgers couldn't have existed a hundred
05:13
years ago
05:14
oh i love this theory yeah yeah yes and
05:17
so it's um apparently they didn't really
05:19
exist back then but the thing is you if
05:22
you have tomatoes they have to be made
05:24
at a certain time of year in a certain
05:25
place on the in the planet the same with
05:28
beef has to be you know you in the olden
05:31
days you would kill the cow at a certain
05:32
time and the bread would have to be
05:36
farmed at a certain time the wheat would
05:37
have to be and so it would be impossible
05:39
until we had modern farming um
05:42
techniques to actually have a burger
05:44
wait
05:45
you could have had some burgers right
05:47
you just couldn't have mass-produced
05:48
them or you couldn't have made you'd
05:50
have to take the cow to the wheat field
05:52
yeah kill it there
05:54
yeah
05:55
you're not saying that you couldn't get
05:56
beef on bread at the same time of yeah
05:59
but for instance um tomatoes would only
06:01
come through in this summer yeah and so
06:03
you'd have to pick those in the summer
06:04
if you wanted to have tomatoes on your
06:06
burger and gherkins hadn't been invented
06:08
yet
06:11
does the burger include the bun i've
06:12
never really understood that yes it is
06:14
it does include the bun have you been to
06:16
mcdonald's
06:17
can i get some buns with my
06:21
yeah i'll play extra i don't mind it
06:23
does not necessarily include tomatoes
06:25
because mcdonald's don't have tomatoes
06:27
by and large yeah that's not true a
06:29
cheeseburger doesn't oh you know where
06:30
you learn all this stuff i had no idea
06:32
this place existed hamburger university
06:36
mcdonald's has hamburger universe is it
06:38
in hamburg uh no it's in harvard uh
06:40
sorry it's not in harvard it's
06:41
considered to be the harvard of it it's
06:43
in elk grove village illinois and
06:45
everyone says it's the harvard of the
06:47
fast food universities
06:49
and there are how many other fosters
06:52
they have 5 000 students they have um 12
06:55
interactive educational teams they have
06:57
in-house professors ray kroc taught
06:59
there the original mcdonald's genius i
07:02
guess harvard of the harvard does
07:05
harvard university do we know harvard
07:06
university ever calls itself the elk
07:08
grove illinois hamburger of the academic
07:11
world
07:12
do you know what is the harvard of the
07:14
lock-making world
07:16
no surprisingly is it yale
07:20
[Laughter]
07:24
so this is quite fun um before 2012 this
07:27
is uh i found this on npr
07:30
before 2012 pizza hut was the usa's
07:33
biggest buyer of kale but they did not
07:35
serve any of it
07:37
they used it as a decoration in their
07:38
salad bars
07:41
npr checked us out and they they said
07:43
they never heard back from pizza hut so
07:44
they did try to fact check it but they
07:45
haven't they haven't got it cast iron
07:47
that's about amazing it is quite
07:48
interesting and that was before kale
07:50
yeah because
07:52
yeah it's taken off now hasn't it yeah
07:53
really you know the queen technically
07:55
owns a mcdonald's
07:57
you she works in it doesn't she on
07:59
alternate tuesdays yeah
08:01
she studied at that university
08:03
she went to hamburger university
08:05
no she um she basically the crown estate
08:07
bought up um a big shopping center
08:10
effectively and she's the landlord of it
08:12
now and mcdonald's is in there as a
08:14
drive-through mcdonald's all right so
08:16
she's a landlord of that she's also know
08:17
what shopping center is yeah it's the um
08:20
uh it's visible from windsor castle and
08:22
it's
08:23
now maybe yeah it's in slam yeah
08:28
do you know the great wall of china is
08:30
visible from winter castle
08:32
no i think that's been debunked hasn't
08:34
it
08:36
but yeah so she also owns a bnq
08:38
superstore
08:40
uh some branches of comet jjb sports and
08:43
mother care is she like one of those
08:45
hands-on owners a micro manager do we
08:48
know she's just always in there
08:50
inspecting the staff she turns up and
08:51
demands the rent with a sledgehammer
08:53
every month
09:00
okay time for fact number two and that
09:03
is john lloyd
09:04
my fact that i offer you elves is that
09:08
in 1851 prince albert commissioned a
09:11
ballroom for belmoral castle made
09:13
entirely of corrugated iron
09:17
now you think of corrugated bananas
09:19
being like a really cheesy cheap
09:21
materials you know garden sheds and you
09:23
know tin shacks in australia but from
09:26
the time that it was invented in 1829
09:30
um it was an absolutely amazing wonder
09:33
material it's cheap it's light it's
09:35
fireproof corrosion proof
09:37
biodegradable and earthquake resistance
09:40
and it can survive monsoons heavy snow
09:42
loads immense heat it can be erected by
09:45
unskilled labor it really is
09:46
amazing actually bought a book on
09:48
corrugated and massive it's about the
09:51
size of a corrugated sheet because i got
09:52
so fascinated by it
09:54
wow
09:55
these days most corrugated iron is
09:58
not iron
10:00
that's true is it currently aluminium
10:02
zinc and steel yeah generally since the
10:04
1890s it has been that and language just
10:06
has not caught up
10:08
yeah so it's been not ironed for a lot
10:10
longer than it was iron
10:12
yeah by now yeah do you know where the
10:13
word comes from
10:15
the word
10:16
corrugated
10:16
it's ruger latin for a wrinkle yeah
10:19
that's why you say testicles are rugos
10:21
don't you do you well i do
10:24
always constantly yeah i read that
10:26
there's a
10:27
theory and it's not it's very very hard
10:29
to prove but there's a theory that more
10:30
people have been sheltered by corrugated
10:33
in the 20th century than by any other
10:35
material in the world
10:37
isn't that incredible i think that's
10:38
probably true because i'd say something
10:40
like 60 of uh nairobi's population live
10:43
in corrugated iron houses to this day
10:46
so isn't that amazing
10:48
yeah well it's yeah and it's amazing as
10:51
i guess as john's pointing out
10:52
i just didn't know the first thing about
10:54
korea this is what i found about
10:56
corrugated is i never thought about it
10:58
in my whole life before
11:00
but then suddenly you think this is a
11:02
really really important thing because
11:04
in uh for example the first war the
11:06
nissan hut invented by captain peter
11:08
nissen who was a canadian mining
11:10
engineer serving the royal engineers in
11:12
britain he invented this thing again you
11:14
just need this it because as i said it
11:16
bends in one direction perfectly and
11:18
it's perfectly rigid in the other so
11:19
they built a hundred thousand nissan
11:21
huts in the first world war house two
11:23
and a half million men in the you know
11:25
around the trenches uh in the second
11:27
world war in new zealand they came up
11:29
with a thing called a bob semple tank
11:31
which was um
11:33
it wasn't invented by bob semple but it
11:35
was his idea i think he was a politician
11:37
or something and the idea is they would
11:39
take a tractor and put corrugated iron
11:41
around it and turn it into a tank
11:44
but unfortunately
11:46
due to functional failures tractor gear
11:49
problems public ridicule and
11:52
impracticality
11:53
um the tanks were rejected
11:55
so they didn't work and everyone thought
11:57
they were stupid
11:58
so the reason that um corrugated is so
12:00
strong is if you it's a bit like if you
12:03
have a pizza slice and you just hold the
12:05
end of the pizza and it kind of flops
12:06
over but if you bend it into like a
12:08
u-shape then it kind of stays stiff and
12:10
that's the mass behind that right yeah
12:12
and it was um first discovered by carl
12:14
friedrich gauss and he named it the
12:16
fiorima egregium which was latin for the
12:20
excellent theorem he thought it was one
12:22
of the best things i mean he was one of
12:23
the great mathematicians but he thought
12:24
this was one of the best things that he
12:25
ever came up with
12:27
he's his own hype man there isn't he
12:28
yeah
12:30
you like the excellent theorem wait till
12:31
we hear the outstanding theorem do you
12:34
know that the milky way is supposedly
12:35
corrugated
12:37
it's like a disc of of mata and stars
12:39
but it has ridges in it
12:41
whoa that's great yeah
12:43
corrugated universe yeah yeah
12:45
is that for strength
12:47
well it might be like because obviously
12:49
in nature just if you think about the
12:51
hexagons in a in a bee's nest then they
12:55
they come because they're so strong or
12:56
so simple maybe it is maybe it's wait
12:59
but so is there anything else that's
13:00
natural outside of the milky way that's
13:02
corrugated yes i know something um so
13:04
woodpeckers they have this cartilage in
13:07
between their beak and the rest of their
13:08
skull because obviously they had a tree
13:10
at 50 miles an hour every time and they
13:12
had this cartilage is corrugated and it
13:14
absorbs the
13:16
shock of the impact and it stops them
13:18
from
13:19
killing themselves every time they hit a
13:21
tree that's clever that's that
13:23
corrugation someone is using it at the
13:24
moment to develop a safer bike helmet by
13:27
using a layer of corrugation inside to
13:30
absorb impacts that's cool that's really
13:32
cool yeah just going back to belmoral
13:35
for a minute um the actual ballroom in
13:37
belmoral now is the largest room in the
13:39
castle it's the only one that's open to
13:41
the public
13:43
and um prince albert because prince
13:45
albert bought balmoral with his own
13:47
money
13:48
unlike all the other royal residences
13:50
it's actually private properties
13:52
actually owned by the royal family
13:54
whereas all the other ones are owned by
13:56
the crown which is the the legal
13:58
personage which you know manages the
14:00
things they can do with it as they wish
14:02
you put a mcdonald's in it
14:06
the um they also in the balmoral uh
14:09
ballroom the castle ballroom as it's
14:10
called um every year
14:13
they hold a gillies ball because there's
14:16
fifty thousand acres of bomber also
14:17
they've probably got quite a few gillies
14:19
i think it's 150 staff full-time
14:21
part-time
14:22
and holding a gilly's ball
14:25
this is my father's favorite joke
14:28
i used to say he used to repeat this
14:30
joke a lot which is um
14:31
he said when he was in america they have
14:33
these people called the mooses uh uh the
14:36
moose in the order of the moose yeah in
14:38
canada
14:39
uh which is a kind of mate they're like
14:41
the masons
14:42
and then this guy my father used to say
14:44
um he's trying to get to sleep in this
14:46
hotel there's a terrible racket from
14:48
downstairs and he brings up the manager
14:50
and he says uh
14:52
would you please keep the noise down uh
14:54
and the manager says but sir they're
14:56
holding a moose's ball
15:00
and the guy says well for god's sake
15:01
tell him to let it go
15:05
never tired of that
15:07
i was reading over christmas um a book
15:10
by uh it was a biography on robin
15:12
williams and robin williams's mother
15:14
used to read so lori williams used to
15:16
read him this book which she said was
15:18
her favorite book which was supposedly
15:20
written by 19th century english society
15:23
hostess
15:24
and it was called balls i have held
15:30
that's very good
15:32
there was a guide to ballroom etiquette
15:34
written in 1880 i think which i it has
15:38
like various good advice for attending a
15:40
ball so like every gentleman without
15:42
proper introduction asks a lady who he's
15:44
not acquainted with to dance she should
15:46
positively refuse and things like that
15:48
but i like the fact that um
15:51
during a ball in a ballroom no lady
15:53
should be left unattended which i just
15:55
quite like
15:56
because they may be removed and
15:57
destroyed without warning
16:04
okay time for fact number three and that
16:07
is josinski
16:09
my fact is that during the 19th century
16:11
sadler's world's theater in london was
16:13
routinely flooded to stage fake naval
16:15
battles
16:17
this is amazing which i think is really
16:19
cool so if people aren't familiar with
16:21
as well like these days it's more of a
16:22
ballet dancing theater um but it's had
16:25
about five or six iterations i think
16:27
over the past few hundred years and yeah
16:30
at the turn of the so between about 1800
16:33
and 1820s
16:35
this guy decided that in celebration of
16:38
uh britain's naval prowess that he would
16:42
fill it with gallons and gallons of
16:43
water and use it to stage fake naval
16:44
battles and they weren't a huge amount
16:46
of trouble for it
16:47
so they employed it was in 1804 that uh
16:51
this um
16:52
this was begun um and it was the
16:55
brainchild of someone called charles
16:56
dibiden jr and he employed all these
16:59
shipwrights and riggers to exactly
17:01
replicate the ships that have been used
17:03
in the british navy the scale was one
17:05
inch per foot so they weren't the actual
17:07
size of ships otherwise that wouldn't
17:09
have fitted in theater
17:11
um and
17:13
yeah it was filled with 8 000 cubic feet
17:15
of as it was announced in the newspaper
17:17
in capital letters real water
17:20
not just fake water and 117 model ships
17:24
and they employed little children so
17:25
they they put out adverts asking for
17:26
children who were able to swim so that
17:28
during performances they could have when
17:29
they were staging all these fake naval
17:31
battles they could have kids who could
17:32
swim in the water that had to be rescued
17:34
by the actors and it was commonplace at
17:36
the end of performances for the audience
17:37
to jump into the water at the end to all
17:39
flood forward as it were and jump in and
17:42
start swimming in it sounds great that
17:43
sounds amazing the reason do you know
17:45
why the reason for these battles that
17:47
but between the licensing act of 1737
17:50
and the theaters act of 1843 for 100
17:52
years
17:53
only two theaters in the country were
17:55
allowed to do theater with dialogue the
17:58
two theaters wrong one in covent garden
17:59
one in drury lane
18:01
everyone else could do music but they
18:03
couldn't have speech as well wow
18:05
so what happened was that they basically
18:08
became dependent on stuff that didn't
18:10
involve any sort of proper acting so
18:12
they had to have spectacles of various
18:14
kinds and and sea battles were just one
18:16
of the main things
18:18
but in 1784 to five the the top of the
18:22
bill at sadler's wells were a play by
18:25
scaglioni's troop of thespian dogs
18:29
starring moustache
18:32
the canine matinee idol of his day
18:34
apparently two horses dancing a minuet a
18:37
singing duck and a pig that could tell
18:39
the time
18:42
like the children's game what's the time
18:44
mr pig
18:44
[Laughter]
18:46
so there was this and hence clowning and
18:48
the so you could have dancing and so on
18:50
but you couldn't have proper theater for
18:51
over 100 years yeah because i was
18:53
reading uh grimaldi the the great
18:55
original clown uh he used to perform
18:57
there a lot and indeed he made his first
19:00
appearance there
19:02
age three as a dancer and an easter
19:04
entertainment and his last in 1828
19:08
to do with his whole life he was a he
19:10
was a big fan of sun as well and i just
19:12
want to mention this thing that
19:14
one of the highlights of grimaldi's
19:15
career
19:17
was in 1807 he was at sadler's wells and
19:20
he caused so much hilarity that a deaf
19:23
and dumb man in the audience recovered
19:26
his lost powers of speech
19:28
and cried out what a damned funny fellow
19:31
[Laughter]
19:35
is that just brilliant
19:38
amazing i don't want to sound like a
19:40
spoilsporter darren brown but i think
19:41
that guy was a plant
19:44
it's even more impressive if he was a
19:46
plant
19:48
could he tell the time as well
19:51
um so i read that this this genre there
19:53
was an actual genre of as you say these
19:55
spectacles which specifically involved
19:56
naval scenes and it was called aqua
19:58
drama
19:59
all the pages referred to it as aqua
20:01
drama
20:02
and one of the one of the shows of
20:03
saddle as well was called was called
20:05
philip and his dog or where's the child
20:11
and the climax of that show was a dog
20:13
actor jumping into the water and saving
20:15
a child from drowning
20:17
yeah they had yeah these huge dog
20:19
celebrities
20:20
a well-trained dog
20:22
i know
20:23
did they have actors on the boats do
20:25
they stand on the ships they're big
20:26
enough to do that yes they did and
20:28
there's one quite funny article which
20:29
points out that everyone's so um
20:32
involved in the show and it's so
20:33
captivating that no one notices the
20:34
problem with perspective whereby the
20:36
boats are about a tenth the size of but
20:38
the people obviously are just
20:39
people-sized
20:41
i was going to say because if you had i
20:42
think they had 117 mini ships on the
20:44
stage
20:45
yeah i do were they all on stage at once
20:47
they can't have been i don't know
20:49
why would you not have them all on stage
20:51
at once
20:53
there was i think the biggest number so
20:55
these are called now macchia um sea
20:57
battles and they date right back to
20:58
classical times but the largest one we
20:59
had in that era was in 1814 and i came
21:02
across this by accident it was all any
21:04
newspapers reporting on that day in 1814
21:07
and it was in hyde park on the
21:09
serpentine lake and it was to follow uh
21:12
it was to celebrate the peace in the
21:13
napoleonic wars so the um peace treaty
21:16
with napoleon and the end of that
21:18
fighting and to celebrate that
21:19
apparently they saved a huge naval
21:20
battle but newspaper said the whole
21:22
metropolis seemed depopulated everyone
21:24
was centered in the parks and the whole
21:26
of london flocked to hyde park and
21:27
watched this huge naval battle on the on
21:29
the serpent
21:30
um we have to move on i've just got one
21:32
last thing to mention before we do um
21:35
which is it's a bit of a it's a it's a
21:37
bit of a famous rock myth um which i
21:39
think is really interesting
21:41
you know that great rock myth about the
21:42
idea of van halen saying that if they
21:44
had brown m m's inside there so they
21:48
would have their this was in the writer
21:49
this was in their rider the idea was
21:50
that they said this is what we want in
21:52
the green room but we don't want any
21:54
brown m m's i thought that was true that
21:57
they did that it is true that they did
21:59
that but so the idea is that they um
22:02
they would come back and one time uh
22:04
david lee roth found brown m m's and he
22:06
got furious and he trashed the whole
22:08
room and that's what became a very
22:10
famous rock myth and i say myth the myth
22:13
bit is the fact about why he got angry
22:15
he wasn't angry because there were brown
22:16
eminem's because he hates them he was
22:18
angry because they were a tiny thing in
22:20
a very big contract that he sent over
22:22
because the van halen show was such a
22:24
spectacle it was such a massive event
22:26
that most venues in america couldn't
22:28
accommodate the kind of show that they
22:30
were going to do and so he would put in
22:32
precise detail this has to be like this
22:34
otherwise people may die stages could
22:37
collapse all that sort of stuff and if
22:38
he found brown m m's inside that bowl he
22:40
knew that they hadn't read the contract
22:42
that's really interesting yeah of course
22:44
that's one reading that the contract
22:45
hasn't been read properly or
22:47
the other reading is that the person
22:49
who's in charge of setting up the stage
22:50
so it doesn't collapse and kill people
22:51
isn't also on eminem scouting duty
22:55
that's true
22:57
that's just possible
22:59
that's that's one of the great rock sort
23:00
of stories and it's it's interesting
23:02
that there was actually a guy concerned
23:03
with health and safety
23:05
behind pudding yeah he's been unfairly
23:07
maligned if that's the case yeah exactly
23:09
douglas adams told me this great story
23:12
about pythons the pythons when they were
23:14
their first live tour and they went to
23:16
america i think and they were having a
23:18
storm out
23:20
live tour and they went to this hotel
23:22
and the manager said
23:23
gentlemen as soon as you want to trash
23:25
the hotel room and go right ahead
23:27
because they loved it you know because
23:28
having the hotel room trash you got
23:30
massive publicity and of course it was
23:31
all insured anyway but you've got the
23:34
papers
23:35
and so the pythons being very polite and
23:37
british and this that's quite necessary
23:38
we don't need to trash i think we're
23:40
very happy no please sir please trash
23:43
trash the room so look let me try with
23:44
that you know like start with this chair
23:47
and all that stuff
23:48
so eventually after
23:50
not wanting to do this michael palin
23:52
kindly went into the bathroom and broke
23:54
a toothbrush
23:55
[Laughter]
24:02
okay time for a final fact and that is
24:05
andrew hunter murray my fact is that the
24:08
practice of dog owners pretending that
24:09
they haven't seen their dog having a
24:11
crap is technically known as strategic
24:13
non-knowledge
24:16
and it's conducted by
24:17
someone who's genuinely called dr gross
24:20
uh his old grasp of matthew gross he's a
24:24
german sociology professor he spent 10
24:26
years following dog owners around at all
24:28
different times of day observing them
24:30
and seeing how they play
24:33
and so and so he he just he decided that
24:35
this is a new sort of aspect to what we
24:38
do we kind of yeah it's that there's a
24:40
specific way of not knowing about
24:42
something or deciding that you're not
24:44
going to know about something happening
24:46
because you think it's disgusting so and
24:48
he found out a lot of other things so
24:50
often before people actually do pick up
24:51
their dog's poo they will look over
24:53
their shoulder and they will try and
24:54
make sure that other people can see them
24:56
doing the right thing
24:58
basically um or um
25:01
or sometimes
25:02
if they
25:03
if there's no one around or if they they
25:05
really don't want to they'll start to
25:07
put their hand in their pocket for a
25:08
plastic bag or something and then
25:09
they'll take it out again they just
25:11
they'll decide at the last minute not
25:13
wow andy what is the thing about people
25:16
doing the pooper scuba putting it in the
25:18
bag and then hanging it on a tree what's
25:19
that for
25:21
well he has a theory
25:22
[Laughter]
25:24
which is that it's a form of passive
25:26
resistance
25:27
um
25:28
that people are saying i don't
25:30
people are saying i know it's the right
25:32
thing to pick this up but i resent
25:33
having to do it therefore i'm going to
25:35
leave it anonymously because he said he
25:37
followed people for years he never saw
25:38
anyone leave him on a tree therefore
25:41
people must be leaving it when there's
25:42
no one else around and making sure that
25:44
no one sees them doing it is there a
25:46
form of decoration maybe
25:48
maybe it's making a double mark for
25:49
their dog so the dog pisses on the tree
25:51
below he sticks the poo up it's just a
25:53
total that's my dog's treat
25:56
no matter how high your dog is they do
25:58
they do this thing now because obviously
25:59
it's a big problem everyone hates the
26:00
idea of seeing poo in the street uh
26:03
dna dog testing is a new thing now where
26:06
they sample the poo
26:08
and they can identify now whose dog it
26:10
is so you can no longer they're doing
26:12
this in london london is where it kind
26:14
of started feels like it would really
26:15
give you the dna of whatever the dog's
26:17
eaten rather than the dog itself
26:20
yeah that's true
26:22
a
26:26
a tin of pedigree chum has been defining
26:28
the streets again
26:31
that's true but no so they so they now
26:33
have 18 000 dogs when this article was
26:35
published um
26:36
in the borough of barking
26:39
and dagenham uh and they've registered
26:42
their dna so if you find poo on the
26:43
street now you can take it in and they
26:45
can go okay that's mike's dog i think i
26:48
might just still leave it rather than
26:49
take it in well you get a big time also
26:51
the fatal flaw in this is that because i
26:53
think it's all voluntary uh whether you
26:55
submit your dog's dna to this dna
26:57
database so it relies on the people who
26:59
decided to go and submit their dog's dna
27:02
then also being the kind of people who
27:04
aren't going to pick up poo there's a
27:05
serious selection by this kind of
27:07
problem here that is tricky why don't uh
27:10
policemen have to get off their police
27:11
horses and you know yeah with a shovel
27:14
get a sack
27:16
a giant bin liner next to an enormous
27:19
tree
27:22
um the guy who did this matthew cross he
27:24
wanted
27:25
you asked about leaving things by a tree
27:26
he wanted to ask owners about the
27:28
practice and um very bravely he
27:31
approached them and started asking them
27:33
about it and um apparently in his own
27:35
words some of the friendlier comments
27:37
included mind your own business and
27:39
don't you have anything else to do
27:43
that reminds me of the study of the guy
27:45
who
27:46
cycled around a town on a unicycle and
27:50
made a list of all the different
27:51
comments that he got and something like
27:53
two-thirds of them were something to the
27:55
effect of was your of the wheel
27:56
[Laughter]
27:59
so i'm pretending not to know things um
28:02
yeah this is from a book called why
28:04
everyone else is a hypocrite which deals
28:06
with some of these questions like anna
28:07
was saying of self-deception um so i
28:09
just wanted to quote a bit of it um
28:11
so there are lots of situations where if
28:13
you don't know something you can avoid a
28:15
situation right which is a lose-lose
28:17
situation just by pretending not to know
28:19
or not to understand something um so
28:21
this is the line if you see a building
28:23
on fire and a small boy comes to tell
28:25
you that a cat is caught in the window
28:26
your options are either to risk yourself
28:29
to save the cat or take the reputational
28:31
hit of neglecting a socially perceived
28:33
duty to rescue the cat and then there's
28:35
a footnote in the book which says you
28:37
could kill the boy but then you've got
28:38
other problems
28:44
something to consider though yeah um so
28:46
so whereas if you simply pretend that
28:48
you don't understand the language the
28:49
boy is speaking then you don't have to
28:52
rescue the cat
28:53
you don't have to risk your life yeah or
28:55
kill the boy or kill the boy
28:57
according to a survey commissioned by
28:58
samaritans quite recently three times
29:01
more men than women would pretend not to
29:03
notice if a friend broke down in tears
29:05
in front of them
29:07
bloody hell that takes a lot of not
29:09
noticing this broke down in tears not
29:11
even just a little dribble a proper
29:13
hysterical crying fit three times more
29:16
yeah you want to say whether that's
29:17
positive or negative though because is
29:19
it thoughtfulness for the person i might
29:20
well do that because you don't want to
29:22
make the person feel uncomfortable it's
29:23
true you could go up to them and say
29:25
they're there yeah you could walk off or
29:27
you could kill them
29:29
all of those would stop the crime i'll
29:31
shut them up but i i have noticed with
29:33
british people generally this is one
29:35
observation i picked up from being here
29:37
is that uh if people are talking in a
29:38
room and someone farts loudly
29:41
just people just continue talking they
29:43
just walk over it like it's this is
29:45
their own research
29:48
you may have been noticing i've been
29:49
conducting my study in the office for
29:51
the last few years
29:59
um yeah look pretending not to know
30:01
stuff is is is huge
30:03
especially in britain yeah so
30:04
interestingly because there are a lot
30:06
scientists don't understand why we do
30:08
lie though and i don't think it's as
30:09
simple as we think so that's what they
30:11
say
30:11
[Laughter]
30:15
so there's this um
30:17
thing called smork which is the simple
30:19
model of rational crime which says that
30:20
we lie for rational reasons so we lie
30:22
when it's going to benefit us so if i've
30:24
stolen something and then someone asked
30:25
me if i stole something i'll lie so i
30:27
don't get in trouble but actually and
30:28
i've
30:29
basically started the podcast just as i
30:31
was in the middle of reading this so i
30:32
didn't see examples but there's this guy
30:33
called dan ariely who tested the smoke
30:36
principle and it's not true we don't lie
30:38
instinctively in a way that benefits us
30:40
at all we lie in a way that says we want
30:42
to present ourselves as a certain as
30:44
something or something that's to do with
30:46
our own self-image it's not to save
30:47
ourselves from something so we don't i
30:49
don't think we really know where we lie
30:51
yeah i think my favorite thing about
30:52
lying is that very small children under
30:54
the age of about four never lie because
30:57
they think you can read their minds
31:00
because they think that that voice we
31:02
all have in our head that we've got used
31:04
to small children just hear this as a
31:06
kind of constant thing they think well
31:07
everybody i can hear it everyone else
31:09
must be able to hear it i can sort it
31:10
can't you remember i can sort of
31:11
remember thinking that i can remember
31:12
being convinced that i just say which
31:14
voice
31:18
and if you're a manipulative parent you
31:20
could really use that to your advantage
31:22
yeah ensure that the child never stole a
31:24
biscuit again
31:26
or you could kill the boy but then
31:30
um so chimpanzees can um do this thing
31:33
um sometimes if chimpanzee is foraging
31:35
for food uh he'll see something really
31:37
tasty and then just kind of walk past it
31:40
pretending he didn't see it just so that
31:42
no other chimpanzee can see him kind of
31:44
getting an eye on him
31:47
apparently sometimes a competitor chimp
31:49
will kind of notice what he's doing and
31:51
then walk past the pretending chimp hide
31:54
behind a tree and then peep out to see
31:56
if the pretending chimp really does have
31:58
some food after all they're geniuses
32:01
yeah i love it
32:02
and then another animal apart from us
32:04
has evolved nonchalance
32:09
that's great
32:11
not a banana guy not me
32:17
we should wrap up very very quickly
32:18
because we should we should wrap it up
32:20
indeed i think that's the message of
32:21
this podcast who should be wrapped up
32:22
and disposed of responsibility i think
32:24
we really need to wrap up and tie this
32:26
podcast around the tree
32:30
um actually have you guys ever
32:32
um enjoyed your bowel movements love
32:34
them girl just yes or no do you enjoy
32:36
your bowel movements um yeah yes on
32:38
occasion
32:39
okay so this is a study done actually to
32:41
test whether liars were more successful
32:43
and it found that they are and the way
32:45
they did the study with these two
32:46
scientists stayed up really late had a
32:48
few drinks um this is in the 90s i think
32:51
had a few drinks and said okay we need
32:52
to ask people questions that we
32:53
definitely know the answers yes but i
32:55
bet people will lie about it and so one
32:57
of their questions was do you enjoy your
32:59
bowel movements and it was just they
33:00
were like well obviously everyone does
33:02
so if they say no they're liars and
33:04
other questions in this study include it
33:06
i win
33:08
have you ever doubted your sexual
33:10
adequacy
33:11
apparently anyone who said no to that
33:12
they're going obviously a liar and have
33:15
you ever thought about committing
33:16
suicide to get back at somebody
33:19
anyone who just knows that
33:21
they've got to be a liar that's how you
33:23
tell then you do the study
33:25
so
33:26
apparently these scientists concluded
33:28
we've all wanted to do this they're
33:29
called reuben gur and harold sakhin wow
33:32
wow i'm gonna kill myself to get back at
33:34
him i'll just have a nice poo first
33:40
okay that's it that's all of our facts
33:42
thank you so much for listening high
33:44
five to anna for asking her boss if he
33:46
enjoys his bowel movement

00:10
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:12
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:15
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:16
covent garden my name is dan shriver i'm
00:18
sitting here with anna chazinski andy
00:21
murray and james harkin and once again
00:23
we have gathered around the microphone
00:24
with our four favorite facts from the
00:26
last seven days and in no particular
00:28
order here we go
00:30
starting with you shizinsky
00:33
my fact is that instead of being one of
00:35
the founders of the usa benjamin
00:38
franklin almost stayed in britain to
00:39
found a swimming school on the thames
00:42
this was his big idea in his early 20s
00:44
so he lived in london he was working for
00:46
a printer as the printer's apprentice
00:49
and he liked to swim and he nobleman
00:52
used to queue up along the sides of the
00:53
thames and be like what is this guy
00:55
doing he's swimming which bit of the
00:56
thames is this sort of london
00:59
so he used to swim from black prize to
01:00
chelsea which was three miles i think or
01:02
roughly three miles so that bit of the
01:03
thames how long was he here for he came
01:05
back and forth i think so he was here
01:06
initially for a few years and then he
01:08
considered setting up a swimming school
01:10
because he was teaching all these
01:11
nobleman's kids to swim and he asked a
01:13
friend for advice as to whether he
01:15
should and his friend said i don't think
01:16
that's a very good idea why didn't you
01:17
come and work for me in america again so
01:19
he left britain in about 1726 i think he
01:22
also one of his lesser spoken about
01:24
inventions uh is that he invented
01:27
basically flippers for the hands this is
01:30
how much he loves swimming he invented
01:32
hand flippers for while you were
01:33
swimming i think he was a child in fact
01:35
when he did that wasn't he he was about
01:37
11. yeah another crazy invention of his
01:40
which i just love his lesser ones
01:41
basically he invented a method for
01:43
getting a book down from a bookshelf
01:46
it was way too high he invented what
01:48
it's called
01:50
no it was called a book arm and it was
01:52
basically an extended stick that you
01:54
would reach up and grip onto books and
01:56
take them down off the shelf yeah
01:58
have you heard his uh pseudonyms
02:01
because he had a load of female ones
02:02
didn't he yes he did so he when he was a
02:05
boy he wanted to write in his brother's
02:06
newspaper and his brother didn't let him
02:08
so he wrote in the guise of a
02:10
middle-aged widow silence do good that
02:12
was the widow's name
02:13
the later one was uh polly baker who was
02:15
a fictional woman who had had children
02:17
out of wedlock and being punished for it
02:18
and there was alice adatung there's
02:20
another widow celia short face
02:22
martha careful and miss busy body
02:26
also the one of the women you mentioned
02:27
and i can't remember which one uh maybe
02:29
the first one i hope it's celia's short
02:31
face it's not serious
02:33
it was he created her quite ahead of his
02:35
time in order to show the one who had um
02:38
illegitimate children and stuff oh uh
02:39
polly baker yeah polly baker was created
02:42
to comment on society's prejudice
02:44
towards women and their attitudes to
02:45
women who had been mistreated
02:48
amazingly thank you i think you have
02:49
more female pseudonyms than the male
02:50
ones i certainly found a lot more female
02:52
ones i don't like polly baker because
02:53
it's not like a funny one like the
02:55
others is it that is a typical man's
02:57
response
02:58
would have been all over that
02:59
[Laughter]
03:02
he um when it was hot he said you should
03:05
you should sleep in two beds uh what at
03:07
the same time uh you said you should
03:09
sleep in one until you're uncomfortable
03:10
then you just go to the other one
03:12
he's obviously not discovered the flip
03:13
the pillow over to get the cold side no
03:16
it's been attributed to him but i don't
03:17
think he invented that
03:19
invented a claw to turn it yeah
03:22
um but he also said it's okay if you
03:24
just have a very large bed you can just
03:25
get up and go to a different bit of the
03:27
bed i don't i'm sorry i don't see why
03:28
you have a large boat you don't have to
03:30
get up and go to another part of the bed
03:31
how large a bed was here actually really
03:34
large
03:35
you're gonna get a taxi to the other
03:37
part you get up you pack a snack and a
03:39
few toiletries yeah and your head off
03:41
top left corner please
03:42
[Laughter]
03:44
um but he also invented uh this isn't
03:46
really an invention um he invented a
03:49
device by which he could unlock and lock
03:50
his bedroom door from his bed without
03:52
having to get up really so maybe that
03:54
was also a cooling device i invented one
03:56
of those as well
03:57
did he
03:58
oh well they're probably having a big
04:00
fight up in heaven right now over of a
04:02
right to the property yes to the
04:04
incredibly successful invention that
04:06
they both came up with that everyone
04:07
can't do without these days
04:10
do you know until the 1930s there were
04:12
water slides along the thames
04:16
floating baths temporary lido's pontoons
04:18
and water slides all the way along the
04:20
thames because people used to swim in it
04:22
so much my god that's amazing now it's
04:24
illegal the so the first ever swimming
04:26
book uh was written in 1539 by a german
04:29
guy called nicolaus weinman or vinman
04:31
and it recommended various different
04:33
swimming aids for buoyancy which
04:34
included belts made of cork which they
04:36
used in life preservers for centuries
04:38
bundles of reeds and my favorite
04:40
air-filled cow bladders oh that's good
04:42
nice yeah they had i think people used
04:44
pig splatters in in england in the 16th
04:46
century for it because the first guy did
04:47
swimming in britain um it was written in
04:49
response to that because it was thought
04:51
that that didn't really tell you how to
04:52
swim it more just sort of describes
04:54
swimming i mean all i've got is how to
04:56
float from it so you know i've got the
04:57
whole thing it is in latin but
05:00
if you don't have bovine bladders then
05:01
you're you're buggered so this guy the
05:04
first guardsman was written by a guy
05:06
called everard digby in 1587. he is not
05:09
to be confused with everyone digby who
05:13
was involved in the gunpowder plot or in
05:15
fact the father of evereld did be of the
05:17
gunpowder plot who's also called everett
05:19
digby but also don't confuse this guy
05:21
who wrote the swimming book with the guy
05:23
who replaced him as a clergyman who was
05:25
also called everard digby
05:28
wait the guy what one of the gunpowder
05:30
plotters wrote a swimming guide no
05:32
that's why i said don't consider you're
05:34
confusing
05:36
i'm ready there was one thing that
05:37
they're asking you to do and you've just
05:39
got i sort of didn't hear the bit where
05:40
she said don't and i just heard confuse
05:42
him with
05:43
was ever our digby just like the john
05:45
smith of its day like everything he must
05:47
have been
05:48
what a great world to live in everyone's
05:54
has been coming in here
05:57
can i just say the first person to get a
05:59
call back to everrad digby
06:03
so ever on digby the swimmer he was a
06:06
clergyman who wrote a guide to swimming
06:08
and where he comes out most strongly as
06:11
i think uh bbc history was reporting on
06:13
this is in exhibitionist swimming um so
06:15
he describes what you should do is that
06:17
like synchronized swimming well yeah i
06:18
think um he's sort of like the
06:20
grandfather of synchronized swimming
06:21
really because he explains how you can
06:22
look good in the water um so he advises
06:25
things to do while swimming uh he shows
06:27
you how to sit on the water while
06:28
keeping a float carry things in both
06:30
hands across the water swimming holding
06:32
one foot with one hand useful he says
06:35
useful
06:36
if you happen to get cramped
06:39
before you ridicule that's great
06:41
swimming while dancing with both legs in
06:43
the air
06:45
also maybe use a cramp and this is the
06:47
best one uh he also explains how to swim
06:50
whilst cutting your toenails in the
06:51
water by lying on your back bringing
06:53
your knee up to your chest and using a
06:55
knife
06:57
using a knife to cut your toenails in
06:59
the water whilst floating on your back
07:00
that's really cool yeah it sounds great
07:02
uh i was reading about strokes because
07:06
um breaststroke seems to be the oldest
07:08
stroke that we know about there's in
07:09
fact cave paintings in egypt where they
07:12
show people doing breaststroke
07:14
absolutely yeah
07:18
how do they know that it's breaststroke
07:20
i guess it just looks like it the motion
07:21
looked like it but there's no motion in
07:22
cave paintings i don't know i haven't
07:24
got one of those peelable books but in
07:26
stone so yeah you flip the book can you
07:28
see it move yeah you flip the rock yeah
07:30
you've got to run really fast from one
07:31
cave to the other and that's very untrue
07:33
to say there's no flip paintings have
07:35
you seen the documentary
07:38
so good extraordinary and did you know
07:40
about this is it called cave of
07:41
forgotten yeah
07:43
they have there's one drawing of a of a
07:45
horse they would draw horses and they
07:47
would draw them with like five legs in
07:49
motion and you kind of think why are
07:51
they doing that why does it look like
07:52
that and they realize that if you had a
07:53
fire inside this cave and you were
07:55
looking at it the flames would create
07:57
the motion
07:59
exactly so it would give it like flip
08:01
book kind of artistic running horse on
08:03
the inside of a cave stroking yeah yeah
08:06
so anyway breaststroke really old thing
08:08
um this is a story that i read which i
08:10
really like 1844
08:12
breaststroke was the big stroke for
08:14
swimming in england
08:16
two guys came over
08:17
native americans had a race and they
08:20
used front crawl
08:21
totally whipped
08:23
ass like they just killed this race
08:25
right but no one liked it because they
08:27
thought it looked uneuropean this is how
08:29
british british people are they did not
08:31
take on that stroke until 1873.
08:34
that was in 1844 that that happened so
08:36
it's another generation yeah holding it
08:38
thousands of hours wasted um
08:41
get this in the 1900 olympics there was
08:43
a 200 meter obstacle swimming course
08:45
[Laughter]
08:48
you were able to swim with the current
08:49
because it was in moving water but you
08:51
had to make it past three obstacles you
08:53
had to climb over two of them one was a
08:55
pole and one was a row of boats and then
08:57
you had to swim under the other one
08:58
which was another row of boats sounds
08:59
great why have we not kept this yeah
09:01
that sounds amazing yeah i've got
09:03
another olympic one that i just want to
09:04
flag up uh
09:06
1896 summer olympics athens athens these
09:10
were all of the sporting events for
09:12
swimming okay 100 meter freestyle yep
09:14
500 meter freestyle yeah 1 200 meter
09:17
freestyle yeah sailors 100 meter
09:19
freestyle
09:21
in which only sailors from greece who
09:23
happened to be sailors who could enter
09:25
the competition oh yeah um which country
09:27
won gold yep uh so greece won gold
09:30
silver bronze well done and no one lost
09:33
because only three people entered the
09:34
race
09:36
um we were talking about races and stuff
09:38
like that in swimming in 1791 three men
09:41
swam from westminster bridge to london
09:43
bridge for an eight guinea wager the
09:45
winner was carried to a pub to celebrate
09:48
where he drank so much gin he expired
09:51
oh
09:52
presumably the
09:53
the other two just split the four
09:55
guineas each
09:57
i think second place would get it though
10:00
yeah
10:01
the people used to swim loads in the
10:02
thames didn't they i read that in 1880
10:04
there was a man
10:05
dog race in the thames and the dog won
10:08
really really um in a so i think windsor
10:11
baths were they used to have little bits
10:12
of the thames as james said at the start
10:14
i think like lido's um set apart so you
10:16
could summon them and they had to move
10:17
windsor baths in 1870 because it allowed
10:21
queen victoria a view of the naked men
10:23
no it was inappropriate oh what they
10:26
moved it so that she couldn't see it
10:28
yeah sorry
10:29
no the way you said it
10:32
it's like in the olympics how they moved
10:33
the end of the marathon so that the
10:35
queen could see the end the end of the
10:37
race victoria's like i really would like
10:39
to see those things
10:41
i read this in a book called queen
10:42
victoria the hidden pervert
10:46
did you guys see the giant swastika
10:47
that's been spotted in a swimming pool
10:49
so there was a helicopter on a
10:50
kidnapping mission
10:51
[Laughter]
10:54
when you're you're doing a kidnapping
10:56
mission
10:57
but you're like but we have to tell
10:58
someone about this pool
11:01
oh i'm so torn here they're like i've
11:03
got this letter from someone saying
11:05
they've taken my child and also
11:07
apparently there's a sweet sticker
11:11
police said the unnamed homeowner would
11:12
not be charged as the swastika is on
11:14
private land and was not on display to
11:16
promote nazism which you do wonder why
11:18
it was on display
11:20
it could have been just a hindu sign of
11:22
peace which those clumsy clumsy tylers
11:25
put in the wrong way round
11:26
if i wasn't a hindu and so peaceful i'd
11:28
be furious
11:35
okay time for fact number two that's my
11:38
fact my fact this week is that sumo
11:40
wrestling referees carry a knife on them
11:43
so that in the event that they make a
11:44
bad decision during a match they can
11:47
kill themselves
11:49
um how often does that happen
11:51
do you know it hasn't actually happened
11:53
uh traditionally the idea is they've
11:55
always made brilliant decisions or
11:57
they've thought actually it was bad but
11:58
it wasn't that bad
12:00
well okay
12:02
sumo wrestler referees is it's a very
12:05
high ranking they actually have rankings
12:06
you become the sort of the head
12:08
of sumo wrestling referees they are the
12:11
ones who carry the knife traditionally
12:12
the idea was that they would kill
12:14
themselves because it was such an honor
12:15
to be that height if they do make a bad
12:17
decision these days they'll hand in
12:19
their papers and say i'm retiring so
12:21
it's seen as yeah but the knife is there
12:23
to remind them that you should kill
12:24
yourself so if like the best football
12:26
referee like howard webb or someone
12:28
would carry it but all the others
12:29
wouldn't yes exactly
12:31
i love the idea of a player going oh
12:33
referee the referee thinking you're
12:34
going no you're right you are right
12:39
so the reason i found this fact is uh
12:40
anna and i were having a drink with her
12:42
friend meg meg was telling us that sumo
12:44
wrestlers are incredibly flexible and
12:46
they can all do the splits so i went
12:48
home and googled that straight away and
12:49
they can if you google sumo sumo
12:51
wrestlers splits on the internet have a
12:54
field day it's wonderful easier because
12:56
it's the weight of your torso just jams
12:57
you right there
12:59
so they're incredibly flexible i assume
13:01
they have to be athletic because it's
13:03
it's a weird double thing isn't it
13:04
because they're really really heavy but
13:06
also they're very very athletic yeah
13:08
yeah
13:09
it is extremely hardcore the training
13:11
isn't in the stables which is for the
13:13
schools that they kind of train in and i
13:14
think one of the bits of training is you
13:16
get your tutor you have to do the splits
13:18
and then your tutor forces your chest
13:19
down onto the ground yeah wow
13:21
it's amazing so anna's just said stables
13:23
that's what they call it it's sumos have
13:26
a kind of hogwarts where you get you go
13:28
you're like uh you're like you've been
13:29
picked as a sumo wrestler and you go and
13:31
you do you put on you're like on the
13:32
sorting
13:34
[Laughter]
13:39
yeah and they they live their lives in
13:41
there they they have to uh
13:43
they do sit in class um wearing uh
13:46
nothing except the nappy when you see
13:48
their lessons they're just sitting in a
13:49
class taking notes from the blackboard
13:50
and you just got all these huge topless
13:52
men what's it called it has got a proper
13:54
name it's an m word i think it's the
13:57
mawashi
13:58
and if you if your muwashi comes off
14:00
during a fight then you have to forfeit
14:02
the fight there was a thing because
14:04
obviously people think that it's a bit
14:06
strange if they haven't seen sumo before
14:08
that they're wearing what looked like
14:10
nappies yeah um so there was a few years
14:12
ago they
14:13
the a few years ago the japanese amateur
14:16
sumo association announced this plan to
14:18
let young players compete in shorts
14:20
and uh because normally you only fight
14:21
wearing the mawashi yeah and um it was
14:23
thought it would get more young people
14:24
involved in it because they have a
14:25
problem with this is it shots as well as
14:27
them no it's just shorts
14:29
like you don't have anything to grab
14:31
onto surely that's an issue like because
14:33
they kind of grab on to those yeah i
14:35
suppose so well anyway it didn't happen
14:36
because the professional body said over
14:38
our dead body and that nobody in shorts
14:40
would be allowed into youth tournaments
14:41
so it just completely died of death the
14:43
idea
14:44
they i mean it's it's incredible the
14:46
respect that they have for all of the
14:48
traditions including that and even the
14:51
audience there are no heckles whatsoever
14:54
and this goes back to the referee thing
14:56
if the referee makes a call regardless
14:58
of what an audience member thinks and
15:00
regardless what the sumo wrestler thinks
15:02
they just accept it there's no yelling
15:04
there's no contending it's okay he
15:06
called it that's his job it must be
15:08
right that's good wow yeah it's a total
15:10
respect and you have to be a good loser
15:12
don't you and yeah never betray
15:13
dissatisfaction with the result yeah and
15:15
yeah it's like it's sort of like the
15:16
polar opposite of a football match
15:18
basically it really so the crowd is
15:19
singing the rare for reason excellent
15:21
arbiter
15:23
yeah
15:24
and well he's got a knife
15:27
the most popular referee in the 19th
15:29
century was called um
15:32
bigby
15:32
[Laughter]
15:36
damn it carl i held that up for you
15:42
the most prominent referee in the 19th
15:44
century was called uh seaguar bastard
15:47
and
15:48
[Laughter]
15:50
so that's why referee's a bastard
15:52
i think there was a suggestion of that
15:54
but that actually came about about six
15:55
years after he died um but yeah and he
15:57
became no he was so good he became known
15:59
as knight of the whistle so i like to
16:00
think they may be called him sir bastard
16:02
after that the knight of the whistle
16:06
do you want to hear something about the
16:07
uk sumo scene
16:09
this is from the uk sumo website and
16:11
it's it's also sad um
16:14
at present the sport of sumo in the uk
16:16
has a very limited following
16:18
regrettably behind dover's white cliffs
16:20
there are no known organizations or
16:22
individuals with any recent training
16:24
experience at any japanese sumo clubs or
16:27
establishments although one englishman
16:29
did once joined the sport in japan the
16:31
uk is something of a sumo desert
16:35
it is sad but it's not true for everyone
16:37
because loads of top sumo wrestlers are
16:38
eastern european yeah czech republic is
16:41
quite popular there isn't it's amazing
16:42
yeah and um of the yokozunas which is a
16:45
top kind of thing um there's not any
16:48
japanese ones at the moment i think
16:49
they're all mongolian wow really yeah or
16:51
i think something like the last 36
16:53
competitions have all been won by yeah
16:55
non-japanese people mainly monk this is
16:56
like the england cricket team isn't it
16:58
we invent it everyone else beats us
17:00
actually it's like that because if you
17:02
look it up it's exa the articles are
17:04
exactly like english people writing
17:05
about cricket articles are like what has
17:07
happened to japanese sumo wrestling
17:08
we're being thrashed by foreigners and
17:10
it's a real problem i think and it's
17:11
because it's really unpopular now
17:12
amongst the youth isn't it so the
17:14
average age of like a sumo audience is
17:16
over 60. um and yeah
17:19
so not a lot of young because young
17:20
people
17:21
as a country the uk we're we're never
17:24
going to get cricket back or football
17:25
back we should maybe go into um sumo
17:29
and the standard sumo
17:30
diet is ten thousand calories a day i
17:32
think in their schools and they get
17:34
force fed um in a thousand calories a
17:36
day yes a lot isn't it it's a good
17:38
amount that's a lot um a blue whale can
17:40
eat a million calories in one mouthful
17:43
so that is what
17:45
how many more it's a thousand times that
17:47
is it it's not a competition between
17:49
sumo wrestlers and blues 100 times 100
17:52
times that so yeah 100 sumo wrestlers
17:54
equals one blue whale wow who could miss
17:57
a day in a mouthful one blue whale
17:59
mouthful so a blue whale could eat a
18:00
hundred sumo wrestles in one mouthful
18:02
that's not quite what i said and they do
18:04
they often do that's why the sport is
18:05
unpopular in japan at the moment it's
18:07
very hard to get people to sign up
18:08
that's why the police go after the
18:10
whales all the time
18:11
it's revenge
18:15
um
18:16
so ex-sumo wrestlers yeah again as with
18:19
you know we have footballers over here
18:21
who go into weird and wacky things after
18:23
they leave football oh yeah um one of
18:25
the most famous ones uh konishiki
18:27
yasukichi became a hip-hop artist and
18:29
hosted a children's tv show one of my
18:31
favorites uh yasuyuki hirosei
18:35
i got this on an article about ex-summer
18:37
esther's from the guardian he can drink
18:38
a two-liter bottle of orange fanta in 10
18:40
seconds
18:43
that's his trick he's also in a comedy
18:44
group and i quote directly his
18:46
obesity-related difficulties are often
18:48
the topic of the group's jokes
18:51
i think an alternative comedy revolution
18:53
might be required
18:56
that's amazing yeah ten seconds two
18:59
liters of orange fanta i can't drink two
19:00
liters in a day i think i could drink
19:02
two liters of water in that much time
19:04
but orange fanta is pretty fizzy two
19:06
liters how many pints is that um it's
19:09
about four isn't it no i can't do that i
19:10
once drank uh i think i had to drink
19:13
four pints for a bet
19:14
uh in ten minutes
19:16
and i did that and i was violently sick
19:22
this was and i was working as a waiter
19:26
excuse me we asked for some water ages
19:28
ago it hasn't arrived
19:32
harkins throwing up in the corner
19:36
speaking of so they're overweight as i
19:38
think you mentioned they have to eat a
19:40
lot and i was looking at overweight
19:41
people in other sports and in the 1952
19:45
olympics there was no weight so there's
19:47
usually a weight restriction on the
19:48
bobsley and there was no weight
19:50
restriction and only the german team i
19:53
think it was realized that the way to go
19:55
fast in bob says i was able to put
19:56
really heavy people on and so the
19:58
average weight of a german bob state
20:00
entry in the 1952 olympics was 260
20:02
pounds which is almost 20 stone isn't it
20:05
whoa
20:06
i reckon they learn their lesson from
20:07
that olympics and weight restrictions
20:09
everywhere now what a shame
20:11
um
20:11
so on uh referees oh yeah
20:14
i did not know because i know nothing of
20:16
sport
20:17
that uh one man invented yellow cards
20:19
and he was called ken aston and he was a
20:21
really tough referee he was really good
20:24
he was involved in football he was a
20:25
football referee he was british and he
20:27
was um i think this was in around the
20:29
50s or 60s but he'd just seen an england
20:31
argentina match which was so rough that
20:34
afterwards the argentinian team tried to
20:35
break into the english dressing room
20:37
like that's how bad it got wow and one
20:38
argentinian player had been pleading
20:40
with the ref and just being very
20:41
passionate about saying that was not a
20:43
foul that wasn't offside whatever it was
20:45
and he got sent off for violence of the
20:47
tongue was the phrase that was used and
20:49
as ken aston was driving home
20:51
he thought there must be a way of
20:53
punishing someone without just sending
20:55
them off because there must be an
20:57
intermediate stage and he said as i
20:58
drove down kensington high street the
21:00
traffic light turned red i thought
21:01
yellow take it easy red stop you're off
21:05
so it's based on traffic lights yeah
21:06
which is i mean it's what you do number
21:08
card
21:10
it should be an amber cast that's what
21:11
i'm going to call it from now on oh god
21:13
you're going to be even less popular at
21:14
football matches
21:17
that was never an amber
21:20
on his uh ideas list was there carrier
21:22
dagger in order to commit suicide
21:24
anywhere did that feature in his
21:26
brainstorm i once went to a party where
21:29
the host of the party employed the
21:31
yellow card red card system did he yeah
21:34
the idea was if you got too drunk too
21:35
rowdy you'd get a yellow card if you
21:37
then repeated an offense you'd get a red
21:39
card and what happened when you got a
21:40
record you had to go home yeah i had to
21:41
go
21:50
what level are you qualified could you
21:52
do a premiership match
21:53
i did yeah i did um arsenal versus
21:55
swansea this week that explains it but
21:57
he's not allowed on the pitch anymore
21:58
because of his new amber card system
22:00
which has
22:01
met some resistance
22:03
james was actually a very successful
22:05
referee for a long time but he was fired
22:06
after drinking all the halftime water
22:09
four players died at first
22:17
okay time for fact number three and that
22:19
is harken uh my fact this week is a
22:22
trailer for the longest movie ever made
22:24
has just been released and it's 72
22:26
minutes long
22:28
wow is i like to think that the film is
22:30
just 73 minutes and they had a terrible
22:32
editor is that the game
22:35
there's a lot of spoilers in this
22:36
trailer
22:40
no sadly the movie is 30 days long
22:44
is it the guy who's making this film i
22:46
looked him up a bit he's called anders
22:48
weiberg is that right that's right yeah
22:49
and he said it would be an abstract
22:51
non-linear narrative summary of the
22:53
artist time spent with the moving image
22:55
sounds great and that it will show how
22:57
space and time is intertwined into a
22:58
surreal dreamlike journey beyond places
23:01
are there any action scenes i don't know
23:02
if there's a chase
23:05
isn't it going to be screened just once
23:07
yeah um i think that's the plan yeah
23:09
although you know due to popular demand
23:12
roll it out dvd sales might be huge you
23:14
get 10 dvds in the post it's supposedly
23:17
it's going to be screened once on every
23:18
continent from the 31st of december 2020
23:21
onwards so it's not hit out for a while
23:22
yeah and then it's going to be destroyed
23:26
by the audiences
23:26
[Laughter]
23:28
sounds terrible has anyone watched the
23:30
trailer no no
23:32
basically there's not enough time to
23:34
watch your 72-minute trailer is there
23:35
really you can imagine going into the
23:37
cinema to watch another film and this
23:38
trailer comes on and for the first
23:40
couple of minutes you're really into it
23:42
like by 45 minutes in you're thinking
23:45
god the trailers they're going for ages
23:47
these days don't they
23:49
i really like in um in trailers now they
23:51
do this they've been doing it for a long
23:53
time actually they show bits of movie
23:54
that never make it to the final movie oh
23:56
really yeah so many movies though
23:58
because they'll release a trailer while
23:59
they're still cutting the movie and then
24:01
a decision will be made when the final
24:02
movie edit is happening we don't need
24:04
that scene
24:05
and then they just go that's fine
24:07
it doesn't matter that it's in the
24:08
trailer yeah so like famously a lot of
24:10
people know this about this particular
24:12
movie but there's a movie called the
24:13
transporter or transporter
24:16
yeah jason statham that's right
24:18
in the movie they did not include a
24:20
classic scene in the trailer and it is a
24:22
classic scene in the trailer where a
24:23
missile is launched to jason statham and
24:26
he deflects it using a tea tray using a
24:29
tennis oh your teacher yeah
24:31
he just smacks it out of the way like
24:33
not interested that's amazing
24:35
why was that not put in the final film
24:37
because jason statham i think said no
24:39
one's going to believe this
24:40
and so but it made they filmed it like
24:42
he didn't point that out before shooting
24:44
it he saw it in the script that's
24:46
fantastic
24:47
um but i i continued reading i found
24:49
this on imdb i continued reading uh just
24:52
movie trivia for that particular movie
24:54
can i give you a couple yes please okay
24:56
so um
24:57
one of them is that uh in the garage
25:00
scene what was thought to be
25:02
transmission oil was in fact molasses
25:04
syrup
25:05
jason statham reported to be a very
25:07
sticky situation
25:09
oh my god
25:11
and then uh underneath the t tray
25:14
knocking the missiles away uh two facts
25:16
below it says that jason statham did
25:18
most of his own stunts
25:20
[Laughter]
25:23
um weirdly there's an inventor of
25:24
trailers didn't know that is that yeah
25:26
very famously a guy called nilsgrenlund
25:29
and he made the first trailer and it was
25:31
for a play called the pleasure secrets
25:32
and it was in 1913. so he wanted people
25:35
to come to the place so he thought he
25:36
would shoot incidents from the play and
25:38
they and they showed it and then they
25:40
realized that this was a fantastic idea
25:42
so they applied it to movies and he
25:43
meant he then made the first ever
25:45
trailer for a movie which was for
25:46
charlie chaplin movie really yeah so
25:48
chaplin had the first ever trailer is it
25:50
right that they're called trailers
25:51
because they used to go after the movie
25:53
yes they used to trail the movie exactly
25:55
they would trail the movie and get you
25:56
excited about the next thing you could
25:58
go and see and then presumably they
26:00
stopped doing that because people just
26:01
left one of the things i find weird is
26:03
that the director who's doing the film
26:05
you're talking about um
26:06
[Music]
26:08
is he's only ever done short films so
26:10
this is quite a big step isn't it
26:12
for my next role
26:14
in between steps he really has i have
26:16
attached all the short films to each
26:18
other
26:20
to make a mega film um but the runner-up
26:22
so the longest film ever um until
26:26
well the longer the current longest film
26:27
ever because it's not released yet yeah
26:28
this one will be in the future yeah is
26:30
um modern times forever and it's a
26:34
finnish film it's 240 hours long and
26:37
imdb describes its plotline as the ever
26:39
slow decay of helsinki's store enzo
26:42
headquarters building so that's what
26:44
modern times forever is about it sounds
26:46
a really good film get a 6.4 on imdb
26:50
it's how the um headquarters are going
26:52
to decay over the next few thousand
26:54
years i think they projected it onto the
26:56
building itself didn't they how did they
26:58
so so you could kind of watch it happen
27:00
as if it's happened oh wow that's harsh
27:03
as well that's harsh for the building
27:04
well the building didn't mind yeah like
27:06
someone projecting your own gruesome
27:07
death onto you or something yeah as you
27:09
just hanging out in the street that's
27:11
true okay so have you heard of don
27:14
lafontaine
27:16
no okay he is the man he's dead now
27:18
unfortunately but he was the one who's
27:20
very famous for doing trailer voices
27:23
oh
27:24
he's done more than 5 000 film trailers
27:27
and his famous catch phrases in a world
27:30
in the world yeah because there was a
27:32
film that satirized that wasn't there oh
27:34
yeah yeah yeah with lake bell yes yeah
27:36
yeah in the world yeah that's so cool
27:39
yeah he was a really really amazing guy
27:41
um his voice cracked at the age of 13
27:44
mid-sentence his final role on
27:46
television was in the phineas and ferb
27:49
episode the chronicles of meep
27:51
and he says the final line he ever said
27:53
which was
27:54
in a world
27:56
there i said it happy
27:58
oh really
28:01
this is really cool this is a thing that
28:02
almost predates in fact it definitely
28:04
predates film it's a kind of early
28:07
version of a movie okay this is so
28:09
fantastic it was a 19th century showman
28:11
right his name was john banverd
28:14
and he invented this show which
28:15
consisted of a 1
28:18
320 foot long painting of the
28:21
mississippi
28:22
right
28:23
it was a mural and it was on two
28:24
spindles like a vhs cassette right so as
28:27
the course so at the start of the show
28:29
it was all on one spindle and then you
28:30
pull it across to the other spindle and
28:32
you start winding the other one round
28:33
and it pulls it across like a tape like
28:34
a videotape but it shows this moving
28:36
panorama of the river
28:38
and he
28:39
would do a show for about you know for
28:42
two hours telling stories about what was
28:44
on the river and his wife played music
28:45
as it went and he was telling you know
28:47
adventure stories and all the things
28:48
that were happening was there stuff on
28:49
the river like pictures of boats and
28:51
fish i think so yeah yeah exactly it
28:53
wasn't i think it wasn't just
28:55
muddy i think it wasn't just water for
28:57
two hours and one thousand feet but
28:58
isn't that amazing it was yeah that is
29:00
this incredible long panorama and it was
29:02
basically a very very early proto film
29:04
yeah when was that did you say that was
29:06
in the 19th that was in the mid-19th
29:07
century so you know 50 years before
29:09
bloomier and melissa yeah yeah i
29:10
remember reading about him in a book
29:11
called banvard's folly have you heard of
29:13
that no uh not much more to say about it
29:16
apart from everyone should read it
29:17
because it is a brilliant book okay it's
29:19
just about famous people from history
29:21
who are famous at the time but then have
29:23
been completely forgotten oh wow
29:25
brilliant yeah that sounds awesome such
29:26
a great bug
29:28
that's really cool yeah who was ben ford
29:30
uh he was he was this guy
29:32
i've been talking about him for a minute
29:33
have you also yeah how'd it go
29:36
not great
29:38
okay so before they had the talkies they
29:40
had the silent films and there was one
29:42
patent that i found um for the idea of
29:45
getting the dialogue across without
29:47
being able to have the sound yep and
29:49
that was to have speech bubbles that
29:51
came out of actors mouths like a party
29:54
blower
29:55
wow
29:57
if you wanted to say good evening mr
29:59
schreiber then i would blow this party
30:01
bubble and it you'd be able to see the
30:02
words and then it would come back and
30:04
then you'd say oh nice to meet you miss
30:05
dargan that is so i've
30:07
that's fantastic that's amazing
30:10
they never did it but it was a patent
30:12
that i love that i in in a somewhere in
30:15
some alternative universe that is still
30:17
how we're doing it yeah that's the only
30:19
difference between this universe and
30:21
that one because it was tried and it was
30:23
just so good it's so much fun to watch
30:25
that's how all news reading is done yeah
30:28
because it lightens bad news doesn't it
30:30
so no one took it seriously so the
30:31
actors and the actors would have to
30:33
pause pull it out of their pocket and
30:34
put it in them make sure they get the
30:36
right one and also you run out of puff
30:39
very fast yeah i think after a while
30:41
you'd be
30:42
yeah
30:43
for a monologue that was the winter of
30:45
our discontent
30:48
one of the great asylum film directors
30:50
of the 1920s was this guy called eric
30:53
von stroheim and i really like him
30:55
because have you guys seen sunset
30:56
boulevard yes
30:58
love it so he's yeah me too so he is the
31:00
main character in that he wasn't really
31:02
an actor but he was a director in the
31:03
silent film generation and sunset
31:04
boulevard is all about the decline of
31:06
silent films about this woman who's you
31:08
know as big in the silent film age and
31:09
her downfall and her servant is played
31:11
by this huge director and it always
31:13
feels really poignant when you watch it
31:16
because it's actually about his decline
31:18
in his demise but what i also quite like
31:20
about eric von strohm is that he
31:22
created the best film ever made
31:24
apparently in 1924 in 1924 so not that
31:28
many films but it's called greed and it
31:30
was another long one so it was eight
31:32
hours long and it was only watched by 12
31:35
people in the end and most of those
31:38
twelve people
31:39
yeah because i was watched by 12 people
31:41
and then people decided people aren't
31:42
going to go and see this so it was
31:43
edited down by his producers and he was
31:46
really angry about that and they've lost
31:47
the original eight-hour film reel but
31:50
apparently this is the holy grail of
31:52
like movie really reals this is the
31:54
greatest film ever made according to
31:56
those 12 people wow that's great so
31:58
where has it gone like literally no one
32:00
knows if we knew that then it wouldn't
32:02
be the other series is what i mean are
32:03
there other theories about so where is
32:05
the holy grail
32:10
i have a weird um
32:12
sort of this isn't really related but it
32:14
has to do with missing film as well yeah
32:16
which is a holy grail of missing film as
32:18
well um
32:20
when mallory was found on everest
32:21
because they found his body oh yeah the
32:23
big hope was that they were going to
32:24
find on him his camera yeah didn't have
32:26
his camera because that would prove what
32:28
he'd been to the top or not the idea of
32:30
is if they made it there they would have
32:32
just taken a photo that was the hope and
32:33
they could have seen on the camera they
32:34
might have found there were no photos
32:36
but the idea is maybe it was he didn't
32:37
have the camera on him which means that
32:40
irvin who's the other missing
32:42
one of the two of mallory and irving was
32:44
up there he must have the camera on him
32:46
and kodak have said because of the way
32:48
and the nature of the height and the
32:49
coldness that's going on that if that
32:51
film is still out there it can still be
32:53
developed but only for a few more years
32:56
so they're desperately trying to find it
32:58
because it may hold the answer to
32:59
whether or not they got up there we've
33:01
got to get out there but it's amazing
33:02
because that's from the 20s like built
33:04
in obsolescence in technology these days
33:06
where they say it'll definitely run out
33:08
after 90 years i'm really sick of it
33:10
yeah if anyone's ever been up to the top
33:12
of everest and not taking a photo
33:14
i reckon i bet it's so cold and
33:16
uncomfortable and you've got to take
33:17
your gloves off i would take a photo of
33:19
my thumb that's what i'd do
33:22
this is my thumb at the top of everest
33:23
it's nice yeah
33:25
thumbs up or thumbs down
33:26
[Laughter]
33:28
not what it's cranked up to be guys
33:30
trip advisor two stars
33:33
uh hillary when he got up there he took
33:35
a piss so i'm just saying he got
33:36
something out straight away
33:38
okay despite the cold you didn't take a
33:40
photo of it
33:43
it wasn't that sort of trip
33:50
okay time for our final fact of the show
33:52
and that is andrew hunter murray my fact
33:55
uh actually this comes from we did a
33:57
live show in brussels a while ago and uh
33:59
someone from the audience volunteered
34:00
this fact and it was so fantastic that i
34:02
wrote it in my files and have only just
34:03
rediscovered it so this is the fact it's
34:06
that in the middle ages lots of churches
34:09
had statues of jesus which had moving
34:11
arms so that he could be taken down from
34:13
the cross and carried around the church
34:15
and there were other statues which had
34:17
the virgin mary with a working belly and
34:19
you could take out a model of the infant
34:20
christ so these were for these were four
34:23
ceremonies in churches so things like
34:25
easter good friday you'd have the model
34:27
of the christ on the cross yeah and
34:29
you'd take it down and you carry it to
34:31
a version of his tomb for example so the
34:34
arms had to be fold downable so that you
34:36
could move him and carry him and there
34:38
is an incredible
34:39
i think it's a book on this is about 300
34:41
pages long it's huge it's called
34:42
animated sculptures of the crucified
34:44
christ and it's incredible scholarly
34:47
work which denotes every single one all
34:49
across the world there are 126 which
34:52
exist still
34:54
the vast majority were made between 1490
34:56
and 1530 it's as though they became huge
34:58
and then immediately
35:00
disappeared wow yeah most of woods like
35:03
pogs
35:05
like when pogs are used in easter to
35:07
represent the crucified christ yes
35:09
there's that really gruesome statue in
35:11
mexico isn't there which is a
35:13
statue of jesus and he's covered in
35:16
blood and stuff and that's when he's
35:18
just been crucified and they recently
35:19
did an x-ray of it and they realized
35:21
that his teeth are real human teeth whoa
35:23
and we don't know why it's really
35:25
disgusting is it like human sized or
35:27
does he have a massive mouth
35:30
what do you mean is he like a tiny tall
35:31
jesus
35:33
yeah he's life-sized humans he probably
35:35
is life-size he's life-sized yeah he's
35:36
normal human size and he's yeah it's a
35:38
grotesque statue but why are there human
35:41
incisors
35:42
i read about that and supposedly it was
35:44
a custom a few centuries ago to donate
35:47
body parts of yours not for science but
35:49
for religion
35:51
you donate them to the church so you
35:52
could have like a statue of jesus with
35:55
lots of different body parts from
35:56
different people i don't think that was
35:58
ever done because that's incredibly
36:00
gruesome
36:01
although this teeth one is real
36:03
yeah and it was yeah it was 18th century
36:04
and i think they were donated by people
36:06
as a way of showing their gratitude to
36:07
christ yeah so what other ways could you
36:09
give your body to so people would give
36:12
their own hair and that could be used as
36:14
sort of wigs and things like that um
36:16
another statue of the baby jesus has
36:18
rabbit's teeth in it it's really
36:21
peculiar so jesus has got these two
36:23
bucktooth
36:23
[Laughter]
36:29
um so some of these other ones that were
36:31
in churches in the middle ages uh some
36:33
of them had movable arms as i say some
36:35
of them had mechanisms to open and close
36:37
uh christ's eyes wow yeah and they were
36:39
some of them were quite
36:41
detailed and sort of advanced in terms
36:43
of modeling and puppetry just out of
36:44
curiosity is this like an early action
36:46
man like is that would that have
36:47
inspired
36:49
how toys move well okay is is not as
36:52
silly as it sounds because early
36:54
marionettes were based on the virgin
36:57
mary is that why they're called
36:58
marionettes yes
36:59
the marionette comes from
37:01
little mary because it was a model of
37:03
the virgin mary which was used in
37:04
devotional plays
37:06
to show
37:07
to to teach children about religion
37:08
basically and some grow perhaps yeah so
37:11
depictions of jesus yes early depictions
37:13
of jesus quite interesting because um
37:15
in the very early days people were very
37:17
iffy about depicting him as a person
37:18
because it was thought of being
37:19
idolatrous and that was a no-no uh so he
37:22
was shown as a fifth uh he was shown as
37:25
a fish as a sith
37:27
he was shown as a fish because you know
37:29
um ichthus was the the uh acronym that
37:32
they used is that right it was an old
37:34
way of
37:35
catholics talking to each other about
37:37
catholicism yeah supposedly you draw a
37:39
fish and that was the sign that you were
37:40
okay if someone else dotted the eye that
37:42
was the sign they were a christian and
37:43
then you could talk properly you know
37:44
right um and in some depictions of jesus
37:47
these are about fifth century a.d he has
37:50
a magic wand
37:52
which he uses is that all his miracles
37:54
no no it's not he uses it to turn the
37:56
water to wine and to raise lazarus from
37:58
the dead and to create the loaves and
37:59
the fishes wow that's so cool incredible
38:01
do you know years ago james was telling
38:03
me that there were lost gospels and
38:05
within those um one of them jesus fights
38:08
a dragon yeah they're called their
38:10
infancy gospels uh and they're like
38:12
gospels which were written around the
38:15
site around the time of today's gospels
38:17
but they were never used in the official
38:20
matthew mark luke and john kind of thing
38:22
and there is one where he kills dragons
38:25
another one where he explodes snakes
38:29
where he kills a boy who accidentally
38:31
brushed against him
38:33
wow whoa
38:35
these are much more exciting why weren't
38:36
these the guys that were being published
38:37
i bet they were disappointed they sound
38:39
a bit like young jesus adventures yeah
38:42
you get young indiana jones and young
38:43
james bond things yeah sound a bit like
38:45
the adventures of fan fiction
38:49
yeah the idea i think is that he does
38:51
like slightly that with the child
38:53
brushing against him i think the idea is
38:55
that he started and he was quite angry
38:57
but then eventually he turned into a
38:59
good peaceful person i think that's the
39:01
transformation but you can see why those
39:03
were not sort of turned into proper
39:05
gospel doctrine i can see why they left
39:07
the dragon ones out yeah censorship is
39:09
what that was really wasn't it um i
39:12
think this is cool speaking of statues
39:14
um the statue of david michelangelo
39:16
statue of david three of the four
39:17
turtles were involved in the making of
39:20
it leonardo michelangelo donatello yes
39:24
so raphael wasn't raphael wasn't
39:26
involved um where was splinter for all
39:28
of this
39:29
it's such a good question he was
39:30
masterminding the whole thing um so the
39:32
statue of david was commissioned about
39:34
100 years before it was actually built
39:35
and donatello was one on the sort of
39:37
committee that decided it had to be
39:38
built and his students had some attempts
39:40
and they cocked it up and eventually uh
39:42
there was a sort of people applied to uh
39:44
be the one who got to design the statue
39:46
of david and leonardo da vinci was
39:48
considered but rejected and michelangelo
39:51
was accepted and he made it in two years
39:54
and everyone agreed it was this
39:54
masterpiece but i quite enjoy that that
39:58
is totally awesome dude
40:01
except leonardo wasn't like that because
40:03
there was a committee that had to decide
40:05
where to put it so at the moment it's
40:07
outside the huge entrance of the duomo
40:08
cathedral in florence um really
40:10
prominent place um and the committee
40:12
decided to put it there but leonardo da
40:13
vinci was on that committee and he
40:16
suggested that they put it in a little
40:18
niche on the side of a much less
40:19
well-known building where it would be
40:21
completely obscured
40:22
wow because i'm guessing a little bit of
40:24
professional jealousy yeah it must be
40:25
right yeah that's yeah that's great
40:28
um i was looking into a statue that i've
40:30
known since childhood which has been a
40:32
famous one for me do you remember when
40:34
michael jackson released his his story
40:37
album and he made that there was huge
40:39
giant statues of himself do you remember
40:41
right i don't know but okay yeah yeah
40:42
they so they made 10 massive statues of
40:46
michael jackson
40:48
yeah became the cover and it was on the
40:49
thames they they floated it through the
40:51
thames and yeah it was i mean it was
40:54
anyone except you know well i hope they
40:56
got permission from the port of london
40:57
authority
40:58
[Laughter]
41:01
so um i was just going down water slides
41:05
i was just looking into it like where
41:07
because those were huge i think they
41:08
were like 30 feet high where have they
41:10
gone and
41:12
nine of them
41:13
we don't know where they've gone
41:15
which is really interesting wow yeah
41:18
exactly um we do know where one is it's
41:21
at the best mcdonald's
41:23
um
41:24
which is is that a personal opinion no
41:27
it's actually a town called best um
41:30
that bought it and so excellent um the
41:37
yeah so it stands currently at
41:39
mcdonald's best parking lot and uh it's
41:42
become a big gathering place for michael
41:44
jackson fans and actually i've got
41:46
slightly wrong there are two that are
41:47
known of that still exist the other one
41:49
the pedestal that they made to put
41:50
michael jackson on was using all of the
41:53
statue stones from a very famous stalin
41:55
monument called the queue from meat do
41:57
you remember that it was an
41:58
extraordinary famous stalin monument i
42:01
think i know the one you mean yeah it's
42:02
it's if if you if you google stalin
42:05
monument it's incredibly famous and they
42:07
use that to make a thing for michael
42:08
jackson to stand on um did you guys read
42:10
about the ultraman statue of taking a
42:11
selfie what
42:13
who was there was a statue that was
42:16
recently erected it was in the city of
42:18
amassia
42:19
amasia i don't know i pronounced that
42:20
anyway it's on the black sea um and it
42:23
was a statue of an old ottoman prince
42:25
and he's taking a selfie of himself with
42:27
a smartphone and i guess it's supposed
42:29
to represent the glory of ottoman
42:30
princes and also meant to be a bit hip
42:33
and down with the times it's not that
42:35
great because people were really angry
42:36
about it and thought that it kind of
42:38
demeaned um
42:40
ottoman
42:41
[Laughter]
42:43
so they within 24 hours of the statue
42:45
being put up um they've broken off his
42:48
smartphone and most of his sword it's
42:50
been destroyed no there was a thing
42:52
though there was a there was a trend of
42:54
taking photos because you know how
42:55
ancient statues often stretching out a
42:57
hand
42:58
there's a trend for taking photos in
43:00
that position to show what the selfie of
43:02
the statue looks like yeah great yeah
43:04
that's a good chance it's a great trend
43:06
well done the people did you guys read
43:08
about the 45-foot statue of pope john
43:10
paul that was commissioned by
43:12
uh
43:13
this guy called lesek lyson and
43:16
basically he this guy saved the life of
43:18
his own son who was who fell into a lake
43:20
when they were on holiday in croatia i
43:21
think or fell into the sea and he
43:23
decided that that was thanks to the pope
43:25
and so he commissioned and paid for a
43:27
45-foot tall fiberglass bright white
43:30
statue of pope john paul ii to be
43:32
erected um and
43:35
disgusting
43:36
why did he think it was thanks to the
43:38
pope uh because i guess it's god and the
43:40
pope is the power of the pope
43:42
came to him in his hour of need and gave
43:44
him the courage to save his life yeah i
43:45
guess so cool i mean i think he should
43:47
give himself more credit but i like it
43:48
so another
43:50
yeah but you can imagine the headlines
43:51
local [ __ ] builds a statue of
43:53
himself after saving sun from drowning
43:58
they should do that more in local paper
44:00
[ __ ]

hello and welcome to another episode of
00:13
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:15
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:17
covent garden my name is dan schreiber
00:19
i'm sitting here with annachis and speed
00:21
james harkin and andy murray we're also
00:23
joined by special guest rufus hound and
00:25
once again we have gathered around the
00:26
microphones with our four favorite facts
00:28
from the last seven days and in no
00:30
particular order here we go
00:32
starting with you mr hound well done
00:36
twice in its history america has been
00:39
run by a
00:42
shepherd so we got that fact through and
00:45
i have no idea what that means yeah
00:48
uh twice the resident of the white house
00:50
has also been a keeper of sheep
00:53
the first of them was thomas jefferson
00:56
who when he lived on uh his plantation
00:59
had corn and wheat and tried to uh
01:02
rotate them but found that the soil was
01:04
rapidly uh blitzed essentially um and
01:07
then realized that sheep were the way
01:09
forward that they fertilized the soil
01:11
they were super animals and so when he
01:14
was president he actually bought sheep
01:16
with him to the white house
01:19
and the the ram that he was most pleased
01:21
with in terms of the the sheep that he
01:23
thought would become america's sheep was
01:25
a shetland ram
01:27
now in the early days of america when we
01:30
think of the white house we're obviously
01:32
thinking of something behind layers and
01:34
layers and layers of security but it
01:36
used to be a house and you could walk on
01:38
those grounds
01:39
so the sheep were
01:41
in the white house grounds in the lawn
01:43
and whatever but this ram was incredibly
01:45
violent
01:46
um
01:47
there are official letters from william
01:49
keough
01:50
who states that he was left black and
01:52
blue by this ram and in another letter
01:54
it transpires that actually a small boy
01:57
was killed by one of jefferson's oh yeah
02:00
oh
02:01
man it's very hard to imagine that
02:03
happening today today with the white
02:05
house but that's true because i was
02:06
looking into when george washington
02:08
because obviously he was the first
02:10
resident in the white house and it was
02:11
exactly like that like people could just
02:13
come and go however they wanted and he
02:15
had to put a law and that stopped people
02:16
just wandering in off the street to go
02:18
hey how's it going he said that just
02:19
you'd be doing work and people would
02:20
walk in just going hey i was just
02:22
passing
02:23
are you going good it seems to be going
02:24
great um bill clinton was attacked by a
02:26
sheep wasn't he remember that andy we
02:28
were talking about that earlier weren't
02:29
we yes and i can't remember what i can't
02:31
remember when he was as a child and he's
02:33
ever since been scared of sheep really
02:35
yeah apparently
02:37
he said it was the awfulest beating i
02:38
ever took but i don't know if that was
02:40
before or after the whole moniker affair
02:46
the other president was woodrow wilson
02:49
oh who
02:51
when he declared war on germany in 1917
02:54
the ground stuff by this point they were
02:56
ground star for the white house
02:58
and uh because it was you know we are
03:01
one nation he he freed them to all join
03:04
the american
03:05
military
03:07
and uh bought sheep instead
03:10
because the sheep would nibble the grass
03:12
and and it would be a sort of cheap
03:14
upkeep i mean they can't sculpt hedges
03:17
as beautifully as some expensive white
03:19
house ground staff can they i like yeah
03:21
i read that they were as a replacement
03:23
for all of his garden stuff
03:27
a nice bed of roses yeah yeah but to be
03:29
fair they are definitely much worse in a
03:32
war
03:34
[Laughter]
03:37
very hard spies
03:40
did you hear something
03:43
did anyone call him woodrow wilson
03:45
whatever time they should have done they
03:46
were known as uh wilson's woolies oh
03:49
nice
03:51
and um the ram of this flock was
03:54
incredibly well
03:55
uh known
03:57
um
03:58
he was known as that old ike old mike
04:01
yeah yes um
04:03
who smoked so well who loved tobacco and
04:06
anybody who dropped cigar butts
04:08
um in the white house grounds he would
04:11
make a beeline i don't think he smoked
04:13
really no that was an exaggeration
04:15
you're right he was chewing the tobacco
04:16
wasn't he yeah one interesting thing
04:18
about woodrow wilson is he had a stroke
04:20
uh in after the war i think it's in 1919
04:23
or 1920 and his wife took over the de
04:27
facto running of the country uh and she
04:29
was in charge when the 19th amendment
04:31
was passed which was votes for women
04:33
really yeah she wasn't officially the
04:35
president but she was like a de facto
04:37
president that's amazing because that
04:38
sort of invalidates the whole vote for
04:40
women thing doesn't it there wasn't even
04:42
a man in charge
04:43
and recount all the votes
04:50
who was the president who
04:52
basically died post his inauguration
04:54
because he did an hour and forty william
04:56
henry harrison yeah yeah i hadn't heard
04:59
of that until i read this presidency
05:00
yeah do you know about this rufus well
05:02
yes it was that he was already ill at
05:04
his inauguration but he stood outside
05:06
for so long
05:07
that it exacerbated the symptom and he
05:10
should have had a nice woolen jumper
05:11
shouldn't he yeah
05:13
he didn't he didn't wear a coat or a hat
05:15
did he not he was being
05:17
i don't know no gloves he was trying to
05:18
show because there were all these
05:19
reports that he wasn't strong enough
05:21
that he wasn't interesting enough that
05:22
he didn't do long enough speeches
05:24
i'll show that i'll show them with my
05:26
naked 10 hour speech
05:27
[Laughter]
05:30
i read as well because i've just been
05:32
looking into presidents at the white
05:33
house and sort of interesting things
05:34
that they did while they're there so
05:36
keeping sheep um one and this this isn't
05:38
properly confirmed but a lot of people
05:40
seem to think it's true grover cleveland
05:42
used to piss out the window in the oval
05:44
office
05:48
it's a rumor that wouldn't be good when
05:50
the public were just walking through the
05:52
grounds all the time
05:54
when you say it's a rumor why are the
05:55
sheep yellow what's going on
05:57
well you know that you can find uh
05:59
bright yellow sheep in devon
06:02
yes
06:03
um
06:04
this is one of the things i uh looked up
06:06
was
06:07
about sheep rustling that actually it's
06:10
going through the roof over the last ten
06:12
years sheep rustling and uh what they
06:14
call it rural crime
06:16
has um gone up something like 125
06:19
percent um and whole flocks have been
06:22
going missing but one of the things is
06:23
if you take a flock of any kind of size
06:25
you actually need a field to put them in
06:28
yeah you know what i mean you can't just
06:29
leave them in a lock up yeah
06:32
so there must be farms that are
06:34
basically
06:35
hiding these sheep and there's so much
06:37
open green space you know where are they
06:40
so farmers have taken to dyeing their
06:42
sheep neon yellow neon blue neon pink
06:45
that way if their flock ever goes
06:48
missing and then you know five hills
06:50
aware or whatever something's like i
06:51
just saw a bright pink
06:54
in the van yes
06:56
this was a news article in turkey
06:58
earlier this year um there was some
07:00
turkish shepherds who were in a field
07:02
and they said shepherds
07:07
wow they were in a field and the field
07:09
was next to a cliff and one of the sheep
07:11
there were 1500 sheep in this field one
07:13
of them walked off a cliff and all the
07:15
other sheep followed
07:17
so all 1500 sheep in this village
07:19
claimed uh fell off a cliff and the
07:21
first 400 died um but then the next 1100
07:26
survived because they landed on the dead
07:27
bodies
07:31
that i know that sheep are quite fluffy
07:33
but i didn't think they were that fluffy
07:35
i don't think if you landed at speed on
07:37
a sheet yeah you're really badly hurt i
07:39
think so they don't like clouds
07:42
but define fluffing like 400 of them had
07:45
to die first yeah surely if you pile 400
07:48
hedgehogs on the cliff
07:51
the 400 first one is gonna basically be
07:53
landing on meaty squelched
07:56
[Laughter]
07:59
meaty squelch does make it sound like a
08:00
less appealing prospect than the big
08:02
ball of fluff
08:05
have we ever mentioned on the podcast
08:07
the idea that sheep just used to shear
08:08
themselves
08:09
[Music]
08:10
what they just used to just what and
08:12
then got like they used to
08:14
hear each other is what you mean
08:16
yeah they used to shed their their
08:19
wall on their own and we've bred it out
08:21
of them because we've wanted to make it
08:23
a thing where we could do it when we
08:24
want well sheep healing is going to be a
08:26
thing in the future where you you kind
08:28
of put a protein into the sheep and it
08:30
makes the wool kind of detach itself
08:33
and then instead of shearing it you just
08:34
kind of peel it off is that like an
08:36
apple and if you peel it off can you
08:38
throw it in the air and whatever letter
08:39
shape it lands in is the initial of who
08:42
you're going to marry
08:44
but for trial
08:47
i mean i know e-harmony isn't working
08:49
before
08:51
i've been through so many
08:55
do you peel it in one big chunk or yeah
08:58
i think that's the idea yeah or maybe
09:00
you just make a tunnel out of the
09:02
scratchy side of velcro and run the
09:05
sheet
09:06
and the other
09:15
instead of getting your hair cut you
09:16
just inject something into your skin and
09:18
then
09:20
you just peel your whole hair off and
09:21
then it saves time i mean middle-aged
09:23
men around the world are spending
09:25
billions of pounds trying to do the
09:26
exact opposite of the thing you've just
09:28
described yeah that's the most redundant
09:30
invention
09:32
something to make men bold yeah order
09:34
now and get these three impotent pills
09:43
okay time for fact number two and that
09:45
is harken okay my fact this week is that
09:48
there is a village in russia where every
09:50
single person knows how to tight rope
09:52
walk
09:53
[Laughter]
09:55
is it just a coincidence like they in a
09:57
pub one day someone was like do you know
09:59
i can do this really weird thing
10:01
oh my god me too yeah like they could
10:03
all wiggle their ears or something yeah
10:04
that would be good no um this is a
10:07
village called sofkala edin and it's in
10:09
dagestan so it's in the south of russia
10:12
and the population is about 400 and
10:14
everyone knows how to titrate walk and
10:16
the most popular story of how it
10:17
happened is that 100 years ago the young
10:19
men had to go to another village to find
10:22
girls and to do that they had to go up
10:24
and down a mountain and instead of doing
10:27
that they would set up a tightrope walk
10:29
and then they would do it but the most
10:31
common most likely explanation is it was
10:33
just bad weather in the area and they
10:35
needed a fix to get over rivers and
10:36
things like that and so um they did it
10:39
when the footbridges would get washed
10:40
away they would use tightrope
10:42
but what's what's interesting so you say
10:44
400 people there um that it's i've read
10:47
the article as well and it's quite
10:48
depressing because this guy's saying we
10:51
used to have seven thousand well they
10:53
all got off
10:56
actually only the first two thousand
10:58
died
11:02
though but yeah he's he's really upset
11:03
because this is a this was the place for
11:05
typewrite walking and now it's it's
11:07
endangered it's an endangered tightrope
11:09
walking village and he's saying we have
11:11
no funding so if anyone wants to start a
11:13
kickstarter for them uh they need money
11:15
actually all the villages in russia are
11:17
pretty much empty these days everybody's
11:19
gone to the cities and
11:20
i think there's like i don't know
11:22
hundreds of thousands of villages with
11:23
fewer than the dozen people in them now
11:25
um russia i have a fact on that which is
11:28
that there are 23 villages in the
11:29
krasnoyarsk region with only men in them
11:32
really yeah and the article about this
11:34
from a russian website says that several
11:36
have only one resident
11:38
which i
11:39
don't know if that makes it a village or
11:41
not i think that's almost been demoted
11:43
to a hamlet by that point just a house
11:45
isn't it
11:47
but weirdly in all of those villages top
11:50
gear
11:55
but to the opposite of that you said
11:57
that's a town full of men yeah right
11:58
there's a town of only ladies in uh in
12:02
brazil called nueva de cordell i can't
12:05
say it properly but um right there's
12:06
about 600 women in this town and the
12:08
reason it's only women is that the men
12:10
go away during the weekdays and they
12:12
work and they only come back on the
12:13
weekends and as soon as you hit 18 as a
12:15
boy and you become a man you have to
12:17
leave the village so it's an entire town
12:19
full of ladies and it's been advertised
12:21
as like singles ladies looking so are
12:23
you suggesting we maybe build a
12:25
tightrope between andy's all-male
12:27
village and you're all female figures
12:29
that's a long one
12:32
you've really earned your woman at the
12:33
end of it
12:35
i mean it's a long way but it isn't a
12:37
straight line
12:41
there's this is just a village fact
12:43
there's this little village in
12:44
kazakhstan called kalachi where um this
12:48
sickness has just like afflicted the a
12:50
quarter of the population which is a
12:51
sleeping sickness where people keep
12:53
inexplicably falling into brief comas um
12:56
so people keep on just falling asleep
12:57
they have complete memory loss um
12:59
they're left with kind of dizziness
13:01
nausea headaches and no one knows what
13:03
it is they just keep passing out it's
13:05
near a uranium plant so people are
13:06
interested
13:08
but apart from that it's a completely
13:10
normal little village
13:12
no explanation for these very sleepy
13:14
people and these very bright yellow
13:15
sheep
13:16
[Laughter]
13:18
i was looking into uh because i love
13:21
that idea of everyone in the te in the
13:23
village uh does a thing so i started
13:25
looking into
13:26
villages where and towns where everyone
13:28
does that one thing okay uh and i found
13:30
a couple so wow one is that this is
13:33
quite nice there's a town in spain
13:36
which is there's only 318 residents and
13:39
they've all been scanned as 3d models
13:41
every resident is a 3d toy now and you
13:44
can so you can go and look at the town
13:45
of all the people living there just as
13:47
3d models which is quite cool yeah um
13:49
there's a really good one which was in
13:50
jakarta an entire town um basically the
13:54
police took and uh decided to burn 3.3
13:58
tons of marijuana because they're like
14:00
we're taking this away they got an
14:02
entire village high
14:03
the wind blew the smoke and so this
14:06
entire village were just off their heads
14:08
for ages have you seen that video of the
14:11
bbc reporter trying to do the link next
14:13
to the pile of burning heroin
14:22
he literally cannot hold it together
14:24
past the first fall
14:27
the exceptional reporting
14:31
uh some stuff on tight ropes yes yeah
14:33
why not uh in fifth century france um
14:36
the tightrope walkers were forbidden to
14:39
go near churches
14:41
for some reason was it in case they set
14:43
up a line because some people did go
14:45
from notre dame's to
14:46
towers to each between them that was a
14:48
big thing in france no it was mostly
14:50
like the church used to look down on um
14:52
actors as well
14:54
you know you can't look down on a
14:55
tightrope walker
14:56
well they're doing it wrong
15:00
but the thing is is that all the fairs
15:02
were held near churches and the fairs
15:04
were the places where the tightrope
15:05
walkers did their thing so basically it
15:07
was a ban on all of tightrope walking in
15:10
the fifth century france
15:11
didn't work did it we've still got it
15:13
today yes uh does anyone else find it
15:15
really surprising that it was only was
15:17
it last year or the year before um that
15:19
someone walked on a tightrope across the
15:21
grand canyon seems like the most obvious
15:23
thing you do
15:31
i like the fact that they had to put a
15:32
10 second delay that was shown like live
15:35
except that there was a 10 second delay
15:36
on the footage wasn't there just in case
15:38
something happened so i i mean i don't
15:40
know what they would have done i guess
15:41
they just black out the program and go
15:42
well that's done
15:45
to the next yeah
15:46
and so nick wallenda is a very very
15:48
famous titan walker but you know he's
15:49
from a family
15:51
uh dating back generations of tightrope
15:53
walkers so the wallindus um carl
15:55
wellender was one of the most famous but
15:57
he was going in the 1920s and he set up
16:00
the one of the hardest things to do is a
16:02
human pyramid on a tightrope
16:03
unsurprisingly
16:05
so you have two walkers on a rope one in
16:07
front of the other they have a bar on
16:09
their shoulders and you have a third
16:11
walker on the bar
16:13
wow
16:14
it gets even better
16:15
the welinda family um did a
16:18
seven person pyramid right so you have
16:21
four men at the bottom going in pairs
16:23
there are two lines so you've got a
16:24
square they both have a
16:27
um a bar on each of them and there are
16:29
two men on the next level up on each of
16:31
those bars those two men have a chair
16:34
between them on their shoulders and a
16:36
woman is standing on the chair or
16:37
sitting on the chair right and they did
16:39
this for decades without incident and
16:40
then in 1962 they did have an accident
16:43
and two of them uh fell and died and one
16:45
of them fell and was paralyzed and the
16:46
other four managed to cling on
16:48
yeah of the lenders they lost two
16:50
landers and yeah they were in fact they
16:52
were family yeah yeah
16:53
what i like about tightropes is how
16:55
basically they they just make it as
16:56
difficult as possible like doing this
16:58
human pyramid or or going over a lion
17:01
cage it's just like it's not enough that
17:02
you're walking from one place to another
17:04
you have to do something dumb on the
17:06
lions oh yeah uh blondin who was one of
17:09
the great tightrope walkers ever he once
17:11
did a tiger walk with a lion cub in a
17:13
wheelbarrow
17:15
so he combined the lion and the
17:16
tightrope wow but that was very
17:18
dangerous and he very nearly fell and
17:20
died because it was line cubs are not
17:22
light yeah and neither are wheelbarrows
17:25
and it
17:26
obviously the line you know will will
17:28
bend a bit or it'll dip in the middle
17:30
because you've got a wheelbarrow and a
17:31
light you want to have is a wheelbarrow
17:32
with two giraffes in it with the neck
17:34
sticking out either way
17:39
okay i found someone called william
17:41
leonard hunt who performed under the
17:43
stage named the great farini
17:45
one of his best ever tricks this was in
17:46
1860 was crossing niagara falls with a
17:49
washing machine tied to his back
17:52
and he's and i don't i don't know what
17:53
that would have looked like because in
17:55
1860 they didn't have modern washing
17:56
which it wouldn't have been a massive
17:57
one like we have but in the middle he
17:59
stopped to wash several handkerchiefs
18:01
and then when he got to the other side
18:03
he gave them to you know his admirers i
18:05
don't know it feels like washing
18:06
machines would have been bigger in those
18:07
days like those yeah those massive ones
18:09
which you open at the top and you shove
18:11
all your stuff yeah
18:13
surely it was just like a bucket with a
18:15
mango
18:17
yeah i think your your idea what these
18:19
watching
18:21
it's like they're only one step up from
18:23
the
18:24
[Laughter]
18:27
it's flintstones
18:28
with a mouthful of soda
18:30
is is this the same guy or is it blondin
18:34
who did the tightrope walk over niagara
18:36
where that was blondie is it blonde so
18:38
he he went over with his son strapped to
18:40
him at one point with his manager and
18:42
giving his manager a piggy back
18:44
yeah
18:45
i read a report where they said that
18:47
they didn't like the safety side of that
18:48
because someone else could get hurt so
18:50
could he instead cook an omelette when
18:52
he goes out he died
18:54
but how did he cook it how did he make
18:56
that he suggested he had a little um
18:58
stove he had a miniature stove and he
19:00
had a pan and to be fair he didn't just
19:02
fry an egg or something he made an
19:03
omelette
19:04
that's right
19:05
yeah
19:07
chopped a few chunks
19:12
[Laughter]
19:14
yeah so it's only a little stove it's
19:16
not like an argo he was carrying on his
19:18
back he took a full kitchen on his back
19:21
so nick willendez says he he refuses to
19:24
use a safety net says he never has done
19:27
he sat to once because he had to buy
19:28
laws when he was going over niagara
19:29
falls i think um and he says my great
19:32
grandfather taught that safety nets
19:33
offer a false sense of security so i
19:35
never used them
19:36
i mean how false is that sense of
19:38
security are they just are they just an
19:41
illusion but i i met philip petit once
19:44
uh
19:44
years ago philip petite was the guy who
19:46
walked the twin towers however you've
19:49
seen yeah man on wire that documentary
19:51
and we so he came the qi used to have a
19:55
building in oxford and he came and did a
19:56
book signing there how did he arrive
19:59
you know what he starts all of his
20:00
speeches on the top of the ladder
20:02
so he brings he came in he was like do
20:04
you have a ladder and so we got him a
20:05
ladder and so as everyone came in he was
20:08
just perched at the top of the ladder
20:10
and someone asked him in the q a section
20:12
at any point when you were walking
20:13
between the twin towers did you think oh
20:15
my god i'm gonna fall and he got furious
20:17
at them he said he doesn't acknowledge
20:19
the idea of falling he said that just
20:21
you would never do it if that was even
20:23
thought to be a possibility and then he
20:25
said and if i did fall i would fly i
20:27
thought
20:30
okay
20:31
between confidence and mental insurance
20:39
time for fact number three and that is
20:42
chozinski
20:43
my fact is that in britain pedestrians
20:45
step to the right to avoid each other
20:47
and in japan they step to the left and
20:49
nobody knows why it's just weird so it's
20:52
totally yeah um so it actually is like
20:55
every country has pedestrians tend to
20:57
like have a strong preference for
20:59
stepping to a certain side when they're
21:00
about to walk into another pedestrian
21:02
but it bears no relation to like what
21:03
side of the road they drive on or what
21:06
side of the um like what side of the
21:08
road you're supposed to walk on
21:09
yeah because in japan they drive on the
21:10
left as well yeah so you would expect it
21:12
to be the same way yeah yeah so you can
21:14
get really obsessed as i did with
21:16
pedestrian behavior and i really do
21:18
recommend reading the thousands of
21:20
reports that have been put out mainly by
21:21
the two two same guys um so for instance
21:24
we act react differently if we are going
21:26
to collide with someone on a staircase
21:28
so when we're walking along a pavement
21:30
we tend to only uh put into action
21:32
avoidance behavior when we're about a
21:33
meter away but if people meet on a
21:35
staircase they do it right at the start
21:37
of the staircase so you see someone
21:39
right at the bottom and you decide there
21:41
okay i'm going to step to the right now
21:42
to avoid them so richard wiseman did a
21:44
study about how quickly people walk in
21:47
cities uh and he asked people to send
21:49
him data and whatever and he found that
21:51
the fastest city in the world for people
21:53
walking 20 yards is singapore and they
21:56
on average walk at 10 seconds and fit
21:58
10.55 seconds to what 20 yards
22:01
uh copenhagen was next london was about
22:04
halfway down it takes about
22:06
12.17 seconds to walk 20 yards and
22:09
everyone's between about 10 and 17
22:11
seconds apart from one place called
22:13
blantire in malawi i've been there have
22:15
you yeah no they work at
22:18
31.6 seconds per 20 yards which is more
22:21
than twice as much as anyone else oh my
22:24
god it's just like really like very
22:26
pedestrian did you notice this when you
22:28
were there what is that so i went on
22:29
wikipedia to see what reason there could
22:31
be behind that and it says the most
22:33
conspicuous and dominant physical
22:35
feature of the city is in numerous hills
22:38
so it could be that oh yeah hey they're
22:40
all walking up for you surely that would
22:42
average out there must be people walking
22:44
back down here
22:48
um just with things going right and left
22:50
um i read a thing and actually rufus you
22:51
might be able you might know more about
22:53
this because you've done a lot of stage
22:54
acting um villains exit stage left yes
22:58
is that a true thing it's uh in
22:59
pantomime okay more than uh in sort of
23:02
all theater but yeah um obviously the
23:05
latin
23:06
uh for left was sinister
23:08
and so that's where we get things on the
23:10
left being sinister
23:12
oh really okay yeah all pantomime
23:14
villains exit stage left and the goodies
23:16
exit stays right or enter an exit stage
23:18
left and right so is that how you spot
23:20
the villain in a pantomime because i've
23:21
never been quite sure though
23:24
yeah it's a fine point those are the
23:27
clues you're looking for you're always
23:28
leaving phantom lines going i liked it i
23:30
thought it was very powerful and
23:31
ambiguous
23:34
but yeah so i read that um even her jay
23:37
with tintin he used to do that as well
23:39
if uh you would face a certain way so
23:41
you would face right if you were
23:43
progressing as a character and then you
23:45
would face left if things were suddenly
23:47
going against you yeah didn't we do
23:48
something about um cowboy films
23:51
yeah we did that the good guys go from
23:53
left to right
23:55
i think on the screen and really this is
23:56
in really early cowboy films which is
23:58
mostly you know it's yeah and also
24:00
usually the bad guy dresses in black i
24:02
think and that's dressing like yeah yeah
24:05
that would have been a technical thing
24:07
wouldn't it um like a cultural thing
24:10
yeah that in black and white have you
24:11
seen the old
24:13
uh makeup that film actresses used to
24:15
wear in black and white oh i think so
24:18
they had like
24:19
green paint on their faces and then the
24:22
lips were like bright blue because the
24:25
way it registered on old chromatic black
24:27
and white film was that it looked most
24:30
likely to be like red and
24:34
and things were registered in that way
24:35
it's been so hard to act is that why
24:38
they're all a little bit less believable
24:40
in black and white films because
24:41
laurence olivier is looking at some like
24:43
fluorescent faces
24:46
darling i love you very much
24:48
you look ridiculous
24:51
i read horses apparently are better at
24:53
running if you if you have a race horse
24:54
than the humans yeah
24:58
it depends over the distance yeah there
25:00
is an annual manvi horse race in wales
25:03
isn't it yeah and uh we kill it over the
25:05
10-yard dash
25:06
but um we kill it well then obviously we
25:08
win
25:12
the way that that works is it's over
25:13
it's around lots of tight corners isn't
25:15
it and so yeah struggles to get around
25:17
those and there are bits of up and down
25:18
and sort of it's quite it's it's done in
25:20
a way that makes it almost equal between
25:22
human and horse it's quite exciting so
25:24
who is it always been
25:26
no the human won it for the first time
25:28
quite about four or five years ago yeah
25:30
i think it's generally the horse that
25:31
wins yeah right um but yeah apparently
25:33
if they go one way around the racetrack
25:35
is an advantage to most horses if you
25:38
suddenly sent them around the other way
25:39
oh really because yeah there's something
25:41
about being right-footed
25:42
so you learn like anyone knows if you've
25:44
ridden that you when you go into a
25:46
canter you have to get it on its right
25:47
leg so you have to when you're trotting
25:49
and you go into a canter you have to sit
25:51
down at the right moment otherwise
25:52
you're on its wrong leg because they're
25:54
right
25:55
right so and you can tell it feels wrong
25:57
if you sit down at the wrong time you
25:58
can feel that it's really awkward very
26:00
weirdly looking into
26:02
pedestrian behavior for this i found an
26:04
article on the chicago tribune website
26:05
which said in britain simply stepping
26:07
off a curb means pedestrians walk a
26:09
tightrope
26:12
not very interesting but true good link
26:14
yeah well if we're if we're doing
26:16
because of pavement style behavior do
26:19
you know why french actors say mailed to
26:21
each other
26:23
ah so we say break a leg do you know
26:25
what breaker leg means
26:26
uh no so
26:28
the um levers that lift the front
26:30
curtain up and down they're actually
26:32
called legs
26:34
and so if you've got lots and lots of
26:35
standing ovations and the curtain had to
26:37
come up and down
26:38
he would break a leg so when you when
26:40
actors wish each other break a leg
26:42
that's where that comes from
26:43
but french actors say meld
26:46
um because if your run was going to be
26:49
incredibly long if the play was going to
26:51
be a huge success then you would have
26:53
lots of people coming into the theater
26:56
and before there were papers the reason
26:58
that we have pavements was that the
27:00
horses would go in the road and that's
27:02
where all the poo would go and the
27:03
pedestrians could walk on the pavement
27:05
and that was a raised thing to absent
27:08
yourself from the poo but before that
27:10
you were just trampling in poo all the
27:11
time so if your play ran for a long time
27:14
people would be treading poo into the
27:16
theater so french actors wished each
27:19
other's mailed meaning
27:20
drag a lot of you know hopefully your
27:22
character is full of [ __ ] yeah
27:25
it's so great who came up with like they
27:27
must have had an actors meeting that
27:29
lasted about three hours going well the
27:31
process is the horses are outside for
27:32
ages and so they poo and then we'll so
27:34
probably i doubt there was a veto there
27:36
wasn't a meeting
27:37
someone came and said okay there's news
27:38
from england they've got this new
27:39
breaker leg thing
27:41
we need to get onto this now
27:44
so they did they did experiments on um
27:46
again on pedestrians and seeing what
27:48
distracts people
27:49
and um they gathered up uh people test
27:52
walkers as they called them into a
27:54
virtual street crossing simulator which
27:56
i really like and they pumped in the
27:58
noise of traffic uh through speakers and
28:00
they measured how well these people
28:02
crossed a virtual road while having a
28:03
phone conversation because obviously you
28:05
don't want to test it in the real world
28:07
with actual traffic so fair enough
28:09
but it was a real phone call so they
28:10
were speaking to one of the scientists
28:12
and they did look both ways when they
28:14
were crossing this fertile road but um
28:17
they still were walking much more
28:19
dangerously so they had less time to
28:20
spare they missed more chances to cross
28:23
safely and they they had more close
28:24
calls and this is i love this some even
28:27
got hit by a virtual car the researchers
28:29
reported
28:30
which is kind of the best car to be hit
28:32
by but still
28:33
and it basically they compared it with
28:34
uh doing other things so listening to
28:36
music seems to distract people much less
28:39
maybe because it's a song you know i
28:40
don't know or maybe just because you
28:41
don't know what the other person will
28:42
say but also it's it's as distracting to
28:45
talk on your mobile phone as it is to do
28:47
complicated mental arithmetic while
28:50
you're crossing the road right they have
28:52
the same effect on your cognitive
28:53
ability but this is why they banned
28:56
being on the phone while you're driving
28:57
like holding the phone to your ear and
29:00
things like that wasn't it because yeah
29:02
largely it seems that your brain
29:04
processes language like the
29:06
the way in which your brain processes
29:09
language
29:10
interferes with your other processes in
29:14
a way that listening to music doesn't
29:15
which is why
29:17
if you're studying
29:18
but you want music on at the same time
29:20
you should listen to classical music or
29:22
dance music without a
29:24
vocal yes because the moment there's a
29:26
vocal your brain
29:28
yeah processes getting confused um in
29:30
chongqing in china they've now got a
29:32
cell phone lane on pavements so that
29:35
people who are using their phones go in
29:36
that lane so i guess at least they just
29:38
bump into each other wow some theaters
29:40
in broadway now have a cell phone
29:43
section of seating so you can tweet and
29:45
look at facebook while the show is on
29:48
that makes so much sense no it doesn't
29:50
terrible no it does not work i mean it's
29:52
it's abort if you're a sort of pure
29:54
theater
29:55
if you're on stage yeah actually
29:58
there are some suggestions that
29:59
producers are quite keen on this
30:01
because people
30:02
do spend time it turns out tweeting
30:04
about how much they're enjoying the show
30:06
and it's bars and things like that so
30:08
they've got roped off sort of sections
30:09
that you know have amazing i won't do
30:11
this
30:12
i've done this on archaic and with andy
30:14
on this but that is
30:17
the last thing anybody would want to be
30:18
with andy
30:22
[Music]
30:26
okay time for our final fact of the show
30:28
and that is andrew hunter murray my fact
30:31
is that half of all california condors
30:33
were raised by glove puppets
30:39
so
30:39
condoles are massive uh birds and uh
30:42
sort of ten feet wingspans and they they
30:44
evolved you know millions and millions
30:46
of years ago they're fantastic things
30:48
they can fly a hundred miles a day
30:49
looking for food
30:50
but
30:51
they were not very well suited to the
30:53
20th century they were shot a lot and
30:55
they would fly into power lines and
30:56
things like that and in 1987 there were
30:58
just 22 left of these birds and they
31:01
were all taken into captivity they were
31:03
rounded up because they just weren't
31:05
safe it couldn't be guaranteed that
31:07
they'd survive
31:08
and they were bred in zoos and they were
31:10
bred by puppets
31:12
so why
31:14
um
31:14
well the good thing about condors is
31:16
that when they lay an egg if you take
31:18
the egg away they assume that the egg
31:20
has smashed on the ground or that it's
31:21
not survived somehow and so they will be
31:23
able to lay another one within that
31:24
breeding season and if you if you do
31:26
that again they'll lay another one the
31:27
next breeding season quite quickly so
31:30
basically you can quadruple the number
31:31
of eggs that they lay
31:32
oh that's pretty really pissed them off
31:34
in the process
31:35
but three you then have three eggs that
31:38
humans can raise and you'll have the
31:39
fourth egg which the condor parents can
31:41
raise
31:42
so that's what they did they took the
31:44
three eggs they incubated them and when
31:46
they were born they
31:47
made leather glove puppets and you have
31:49
to look them up the pictures are
31:50
incredible i'll put them on my twitter
31:52
and it's really weird seeing them
31:54
interacting with also
31:56
puppet looking baby condors which don't
31:58
they look really rubbery and strange or
31:59
not so yeah yeah and they they drowned
32:02
out the noise by playing the sounds of
32:04
rivers and streams and they poked the
32:06
puppets through a one-way screen so you
32:08
couldn't see
32:10
you know the human behind yeah one of
32:12
the people who cares for them this guy i
32:14
think
32:15
a quote from a guy called ron webb who's
32:17
a senior condole keeper explained that
32:19
he raises these baby condors with the
32:21
help of a condor hand puppet and then he
32:23
goes on to say the puppet is like a
32:25
fancy glove
32:28
whoever needs an explanation
32:30
of what a hand puppet is
32:34
and that's not a good one
32:35
it is a fancy glove isn't it it's not
32:37
like i go to the ball wearing this
32:42
contessa your [ __ ] is looking
32:43
especially delightful this evening
32:45
hey speaking of [ __ ] i was i looked
32:48
into city because i was just going into
32:49
glove puppet territory do you know how
32:51
city came about does anyone know the
32:53
origin story it was a harry written by a
32:55
radio actor
32:58
wasn't it a gift no so a reality show on
33:01
the bbc called bbc's talent night
33:04
effectively britain's got talent back in
33:06
the 1950s and on that show stood a man
33:10
with a [ __ ] puppet and he just i don't
33:12
even know what he did wouldn't that have
33:13
been um harry carvin harry cooper very
33:16
cool yeah so harry corbett went on he
33:17
had [ __ ] and he made it through the
33:19
heat yeah he made it to the final [ __ ]
33:21
is a reality tv star he's effectively
33:23
the susan boyle of his time he's like
33:25
he's a reaction he got voted that was
33:26
his act it was city singing i dreamed a
33:28
dream
33:29
yeah but into my it's harry corbett's
33:31
here yeah
33:33
i have i've met matthew corbett the uh
33:36
matthew carpet son
33:42
yeah ironically given his family trade
33:44
he was involved in helping to amplify
33:46
people
33:47
well that's arguably what the parent is
33:49
what's that you say oh yeah yeah
33:52
yeah so it's just carrying oh that's i
33:54
like that and he listens by the way oh
33:57
hello ben hey ben no way that's so cool
34:00
um
34:01
so uh condors um
34:03
the thing is all the pup all the
34:05
condoles which have been raised by these
34:07
puppets they started behaving really
34:09
weirdly so instead of uh staying in the
34:11
wild and doing condor stuff they started
34:13
posing for photos with i mean not posing
34:15
but you know they started compliantly
34:17
being in photos of people they started
34:19
attacking hikers shoelaces and they also
34:22
uh started experimenting with group sex
34:24
which is not normal
34:26
condor behavior i believe hey who are
34:28
you to judge
34:30
oh yeah normal sure
34:32
geez get over yourself granddad
34:36
so
34:36
the theory was because they hadn't been
34:38
raised wild by wild birds that they
34:40
didn't have proper role models for how
34:42
to behave like a condor but the the
34:44
puppets
34:45
the cranes because they've also done it
34:47
with cranes and when they did the puppet
34:49
rearing with cranes the puppetry of
34:50
cranes would often abandon their eggs
34:52
days before they were due to hatch but
34:54
really really not long before so we they
34:56
just didn't have any idea of how to
34:58
bring up
34:59
uh a chick uh the same way so to fix the
35:03
situation the humans had to start
35:04
behaving like combos with these glove
35:06
puppets
35:08
um so that's when they showed them the
35:10
screens but also they would sort of uh
35:12
they would this isn't nice but they had
35:14
to sort of hit the child condos a bit
35:16
the chicks when they misbehave that must
35:18
be the weirdest thing slapping a condor
35:20
and being paid being paid to do that
35:21
because that's not a voluntary job you
35:23
know
35:24
um can i explain a rabbit hole that i
35:27
went down looking at those
35:30
was that the california condor went
35:31
extinct in the world in 1987. so i was
35:34
like oh let's see what else went extinct
35:35
in 1987. of course and that led me to
35:38
discover that there's this thing called
35:39
de-extinction which is the attempt to
35:42
bring
35:43
like jurassic park essentially to bring
35:46
back extinct species
35:48
and um this year was the fifth
35:51
generation of the quagga
35:53
and the uh the quagga is a specifically
35:56
patterned zebra
35:58
which had gone extinct and and
36:01
quagga became a slang term just to mean
36:02
all zebras so the last quagga that
36:06
genuine quagga died in 1883 in a zoo but
36:10
nobody realized she was the last of her
36:12
kind and then it was realized that it
36:15
wasn't a specific species as much as a
36:16
subspecies so you could
36:19
selectively breed
36:21
plain zebras to have the same
36:24
markings and uh
36:26
elements as a quagga and they've done
36:29
that successfully and now the fifth
36:30
generation of quagga has been reborn
36:33
and then i found a list of likely
36:35
candidates for de-extinction
36:38
so there's the carolina parakeet the
36:40
passenger pigeon which apparently was
36:42
the most common pigeon in america and
36:45
was largely just like if they saw one
36:47
they'd shoot it for a long time yeah
36:49
that went um the woolly mammoth i think
36:52
we've all been expecting that for a
36:53
while now and the thing that i had no
36:56
idea even ever existed went extinct 10
36:58
000 years ago the woolly rhino
37:01
oh that sounds really cool doesn't it
37:03
yeah um
37:10
yeah
37:11
it would have been very hot though
37:12
wouldn't it
37:13
right it must have been just is that
37:15
what made it extinct it's just too hot
37:22
so one thing about surrogates is for
37:24
giant pandas they sometimes use rabbits
37:27
so they'll they'll put the like the
37:29
giant panda clone eggs inside a rabbit
37:31
so the rabbit could give birth to a
37:33
panda and there you go that's
37:35
that's gonna be one braggy rabbit mum at
37:36
the school gates isn't it
37:38
and also that's my boy
37:42
because they look they're tiny and gross
37:44
at first aren't they so it'll give birth
37:45
at first and it's like a two millimeter
37:47
tall lump of skin and the other rabbits
37:49
are going to take the tissue it's like a
37:50
new version of the ugly the ugly
37:51
duckling
37:52
the giant panda yeah speaking of uh once
37:55
was a hideous rabbit
37:57
with ears all stubby and short
38:00
and all the other bunnies and so many
38:02
words said bloody oh you're eating a lot
38:04
of bamboo
38:04
[Laughter]
38:09
oh my god
38:11
i'm just back to condors very quickly
38:13
they don't eat for days because they fly
38:14
and they obviously go for huge meals so
38:16
they'll look for the carcass of a deer
38:18
or whatever and
38:19
when they do eat sometimes they go
38:20
overboard on it eat too much that they
38:23
can't actually take off again yeah so
38:25
that's true that's how they used to
38:26
catch them in like um south america and
38:28
stuff they would um put like a dead
38:31
horse or something on the on the ground
38:32
or a dead animal and then the condors
38:34
would come down and they'd eat so much
38:37
that they couldn't eat anymore and then
38:38
they won't be able to fly because they
38:39
were so heavy and then you just sort of
38:42
run after them and hear the noose and
38:44
then pull them off and often like they
38:46
try and fly and they throw up uh because
38:48
they were so exhausted and so full is
38:50
that an evolutionary response because
38:53
the reason that we want to we when we
38:55
get nervous is supposedly because
38:58
there's a
39:00
i think a reptile you know so the
39:02
evolution of the brain is that we start
39:04
off with a very simple brain and then we
39:06
get a bit of the brain that becomes like
39:07
reptilian and then it becomes mammalian
39:10
and it's basically layer on layer
39:13
and the reason we want to we when we get
39:14
nervous is you want to make yourself as
39:16
light as possible so that when you start
39:18
to run away
39:20
you you can get further with that i
39:22
would think that would probably be same
39:23
with the condor wouldn't it but you you
39:24
throw up because you want to then you'd
39:26
be lighter and then you could arguably
39:28
get away oh there's some animals that
39:29
throw up so that something chasing them
39:31
will eat whatever they've thrown up
39:33
instead of eating them
39:34
diversionary a diversionary vomit yeah
39:37
um so when eating corpses um condors
39:40
always start with the eyes and tongue
39:42
which is a favorite part
39:45
you don't know that it might be their
39:46
least favorite part they're just getting
39:47
it over with
39:49
that's so you eat your eyes and tongue
39:50
young lady
40:00
um there is a reddit thread
40:02
do you prefer sex with or without a
40:04
condor
40:05
which is a typo
40:10
anyone reply lots of people have replied
40:12
yeah yeah
40:13
love it
40:18
okay that's it that's all of our facts
40:20

=63
00:00
um
00:10
[Applause]
00:20
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:23
no such thing as a fish this week coming
00:25
to you from the hay festival in hay
00:30
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
00:31
here with three other qi elves it's anna
00:33
chazinski james harkin and andy murray
00:35
and once again we have gathered round
00:37
the microphones with our four favorite
00:38
facts from the last seven days and in no
00:40
particular order here we go
00:42
starting with you chozinski
00:45
yes did you mention that these are
00:46
specifically literary facts absolutely
00:51
yeah because it's a literary festival
00:53
yeah and that's why i said it yeah
00:56
that's why i thought you said it
00:58
so my literary fact is that uh the first
01:01
ever novel ended mid-sentence
01:04
um
01:05
and this is a japanese novel called the
01:08
tale of genji it was written in the
01:10
early 11th century so probably 1008 i
01:14
think and yeah ended in the middle of a
01:16
sentence
01:17
was it like a cliffhanger ending kind of
01:19
i mean not as melodramatic but she's in
01:21
the characters introducing another
01:22
character to someone and it ends saying
01:24
karu introduces him to the
01:27
you never find out who
01:29
um and people don't know if that was
01:30
intentional or if she just died in the
01:32
middle of gabriel
01:35
i think most most uh critics think that
01:37
it was intentional i had another version
01:39
which is like they just she just carried
01:41
on she was going to carry on and carry
01:43
on until she couldn't do it anymore
01:44
because it's quite a long book isn't it
01:46
yeah i think it's about 1100 pages yeah
01:48
1100 pages yeah apparently there's like
01:50
400 characters in there yeah and none of
01:53
them have names no none of them have
01:55
names and i read in one
01:57
how do you do that though well yeah it
01:59
must have been so confusing so there are
02:00
400 characters and apparently at the
02:02
time it was rude in japanese it's all
02:04
about japanese aristocratic society in
02:05
the 12th century and it was rude to
02:07
refer to someone by name because um it
02:09
was thought as being like unnecessarily
02:11
familiar so for 400 characters none of
02:13
them are allowed to be referred to by
02:14
name so they're all like your excellency
02:16
your majesty his highness so they still
02:18
had titles okay yeah but i mean there
02:20
are 75 his highnesses
02:24
so i saw it people like oh what's he
02:25
doing here said him
02:28
i didn't she knew what he meant about
02:30
him
02:31
that's a very cool uh way to end it i
02:33
like it
02:34
yeah it is so she's so she's a bit like
02:36
a precursor to tristan chandi she seemed
02:38
to have interesting things she did with
02:40
the form of the novel um
02:45
it's a really bold new kind of novel
02:47
actually
02:50
so
02:52
she divided the convention that she
02:54
created 400 pages earlier
02:59
but
03:00
there's one bit so two-thirds of the way
03:02
through she kills off the main character
03:03
about whom the whole thing is written
03:04
the tale of kenji just dies and also
03:06
doesn't really explain he's been killed
03:07
off it's just that there's a blank
03:09
chapter called vanished into the clouds
03:11
with no text in it and then in the next
03:13
chapter it becomes apparent that the
03:14
protagonist has died wow
03:17
yeah does anyone know what the first
03:19
ebook was
03:20
no that's the thing where it's like
03:21
there's a few different claims but um
03:23
probably the most likely uh it was a
03:25
book called uncle roger by judy malloy
03:29
and you can still see it online it's
03:30
like all hyperlinked and you go in there
03:33
and it's like there's been a party and
03:34
it has all the characters you can click
03:36
on a character and it gives you their
03:37
little story and then you click on the
03:38
next character and you do that it's like
03:40
a you know choose your own adventure
03:42
books those things that you have
03:44
they were amazing those books were made
03:46
yeah so good um and so
03:48
reading that this was like choose their
03:49
own advents adventure i thought i'd look
03:51
into those and apparently you can get
03:53
adults to choose your own adventure
03:54
books oh god yeah um
03:58
the two best sellers i could find are
04:00
called beer women and bad decisions
04:05
[Applause]
04:05
[Laughter]
04:07
that's great sounds good though doesn't
04:09
it it sounds like you're gonna try and
04:10
get the bad decisions yeah it's like
04:12
another point or a prostitute tonight
04:17
is that how it works that's how most
04:19
nights work
04:21
and the other best-selling one i found
04:23
is called night of a thousand boyfriends
04:26
[Laughter]
04:38
so the first novel in the english
04:39
language is obviously a different thing
04:41
because this uh the tale of genji is not
04:43
in english um people often say it's
04:45
thomas mallory's la morte d'arthur which
04:47
i like the idea that the first novel
04:49
written in english has a french title
04:53
couldn't so i think it's actually this
04:54
novel written in 1561 called bewear the
04:57
cat
04:58
which
05:00
is i think the main contender for first
05:01
novel written in english is just by a
05:03
prince's assistant called william
05:04
baldwin it's kind of a horror novel
05:06
about like evil cats really um it's
05:09
about this so this guy eavesdrops on a
05:11
cat and he overhears a female cat on
05:14
trial um and the female cat's called
05:16
mouse slayer for obvious reasons and
05:20
she's having to explain to this court of
05:22
other cats that um she hasn't broken the
05:24
cat's code of sexual conduct which
05:27
dictates that a female cat is not
05:29
allowed to say no to any fewer than ten
05:31
male cats a night so
05:33
if you reject you know the tenth guy
05:36
you're up in court on trial um anyway
05:38
here's over here's this um another point
05:41
in this story this first first novel
05:42
ever written a priest slips on a cat and
05:45
falls into a crowd
05:48
wait wait wait wait wait does he does he
05:50
slip on a hat or does he slip on a hat
05:54
sorry
05:56
sorry
05:57
andy's going to be googling a book
05:59
called beware of the hat playdough
06:01
oh wait
06:02
what needs to do because it's on trial
06:07
this priest does slip on it and he uh he
06:10
ends up with his face in the bare ass of
06:12
a boy who out of fear
06:16
what kind of an excuse is that
06:18
i slept
06:23
uh ends up with his face in the bare ass
06:25
of a boy who out of fear had to be
06:27
himself
06:32
first novel well
06:35
wow
06:36
that's the first novel
06:39
so first novel in english wow yeah so i
06:41
always think seeing what was happening
06:43
in europe at the same time as this book
06:45
was being written and this japanese one
06:47
and in 1008 bishop birchard of worms was
06:51
writing books on canon law
06:53
a book that he called correct or at
06:55
medicus and the idea was he would give
06:58
it to the bishops and give it to the
06:59
priests and it would give them the rules
07:00
of the penance that they would give out
07:02
to people so if you did something wrong
07:04
it would be like five hail marys or
07:06
whatever but quite a lot of it seems to
07:08
be
07:09
very strange um
07:11
one of the things was if a woman had
07:14
smothered a live fish inside her vagina
07:18
and then
07:19
and then served it to men
07:22
a classic prank
07:26
i really got him with the old vagina
07:28
fish
07:30
he won't put cling film under my toilet
07:31
again
07:32
[Laughter]
07:36
either that or needing bread on her
07:38
naked buttocks um then she would get a
07:41
penance of two to five years fasting on
07:43
feast days according to this book um so
07:46
we were on endings of books earlier yeah
07:48
so uh the first uh version of hamlet has
07:51
a happy ending ah which is nice uh and
07:54
it's called amleth which is hamlet with
07:56
the h at the other end that's the sole
07:58
change it doesn't move some kind of like
08:00
copyright
08:03
bad news william we can't do anything
08:05
with amla wait a minute um but
08:09
and it's the same and
08:10
it's right down to stabbing someone
08:12
who's hiding behind an aris all of that
08:13
stuff um
08:15
but then at the end of it he kills the
08:16
usurper so uh his father's uh brother
08:20
his uncle um
08:22
kill the usurper goes to england marries
08:24
the sexy queen of scots returns with an
08:26
army and then becomes king and then he
08:28
has two queens one is his wife and one
08:30
is his mother who was queen before wow
08:32
yeah that's how it ends originally i
08:34
think they should redo it like that
08:37
do we have it or we've just heard that
08:39
it exists i don't know um just about uh
08:42
uh authors who uh who sort of came up
08:45
with something and then flipped it into
08:46
something else uh do you know how fear
08:49
and loathing in las vegas started hunter
08:50
s thompson's book
08:52
it was meant to be and this is what he
08:54
handed in when he handed in the majority
08:56
of the book it was actually originally
08:58
meant to be a 250 word photo caption for
09:01
sports illustration
09:04
they wanted him to go cover a derby and
09:06
he started writing and they were like
09:08
it's great but
09:09
we kind of needed to fit in here
09:12
can you say the same stuff but in there
09:16
wow that's amazing well so they said bad
09:18
news we can't put that below as a
09:20
caption so we've had to just give you a
09:22
book deal instead no no no they didn't
09:24
like it at all and he had to take it
09:25
elsewhere and of course they didn't like
09:27
it so
09:28
you read the mail online articles and
09:30
there's a one-line description of the
09:31
photo you know so-and-so turned up at a
09:33
party looking nice you don't want a 60
09:35
000 word novel there yeah
09:37
um okay why don't we move on to our
09:39
second fact and that is
09:42
james okay my fact this week is that
09:46
j.r.r tolkien and c.s lewis went to a
09:49
party dressed as polar bears it was not
09:51
a fancy dress party
09:53
[Laughter]
09:58
it's the added shame of turning up in
09:59
the same thing as somebody else
10:02
so tolkien and louise they were um
10:04
really good friends of course um
10:07
well not always uh no not always you'll
10:09
probably get on to that in a few seconds
10:10
please
10:11
wait sorry do we know the circumstances
10:12
of the fancy dress party or is that just
10:15
no not really it seems to i read it in a
10:17
book it was a biography of talking and
10:19
it was like here's one of the funny
10:21
things that he used to do he used to do
10:23
tantalizing yeah i know but he used to
10:25
like dressing up a lot
10:27
yeah he and not even when it wasn't a
10:29
fancy dress party just in day-to-day
10:30
life really yeah yeah like he apparently
10:32
very famously dressed up as an
10:34
axe-wielding anglo-saxon warrior and
10:36
chased his neighbor down the road
10:37
[Laughter]
10:39
um so after they met for the very first
10:41
time uh c.s lewis wrote in his diary
10:44
about tolkien no harm in him only needs
10:46
a smack or so
10:47
[Laughter]
10:49
so they did they were very good friends
10:51
for a long time and then they had a
10:53
rivalry later um
10:56
uh tolkien eventually they had their
10:58
meetings
10:59
of a group called the inklings which is
11:00
a sort of famous literary salon in a pub
11:03
in oxford and they would read out their
11:05
stuff to each other and eventually
11:06
tolkien didn't even go along to meetings
11:09
when he knew that c.s lewis was going to
11:11
read out narnia's stuff that's how bad
11:13
it got he really didn't like the
11:14
allegory and narnia he said that writing
11:17
an allegory which narnia a lot of people
11:19
say is yeah i think it is um
11:22
he said that allegory was a very lazy
11:24
form of writing and he didn't really
11:25
approve of it so that's what it was one
11:27
of the things that the inklings did um
11:29
would they is they would hold
11:30
competitions to see who could read um a
11:32
particular lady's work without laughing
11:35
because she was the worst writer what in
11:37
the world was this a particular writer
11:39
or just did they find any woman author
11:43
oh right because the way you said it it
11:44
just sounded like they were all massive
11:45
sexist yeah it's true
11:47
it still sounds pretty sexy
11:50
and so this lady was called amanda
11:52
mckittrick ross she um wrote lots of um
11:55
lots of fiction and here's some examples
11:58
of things that she said and she refers
11:59
to eyes as globes of glare
12:02
she refers to legs as bony supports
12:06
and she
12:07
refers to pants as southern necessity
12:10
okay
12:11
well that one's got assonance the first
12:13
one had alliteration i mean this is like
12:15
ticking all the literary boxes as far as
12:17
i can tell okay she called sweat
12:19
globules of liquid lava lovely
12:23
that's great this is a damn good simile
12:25
okay
12:29
um one of the
12:31
main reasons i think the main reason
12:33
actually that tolkien objected to cs
12:34
versus allegory and i just think this is
12:37
quite interesting it's not funny at all
12:39
but um tolkien was a strict catholic and
12:43
um he so for instance he uh when they
12:45
started to start the 20th century even
12:47
in catholic mass they would start saying
12:48
that in english he would say the mass
12:50
very loudly in latin in the middle of
12:52
church
12:53
while they were saying in english to
12:54
make clear his thoughts but he didn't
12:57
object so cs laws was an anglican so um
13:00
tolkien so he didn't really believe that
13:02
um the word of god should only be spoken
13:04
through like priests and members of the
13:05
clergy whereas tolkien did so tolkien
13:07
thought that it wasn't cs lewis's place
13:09
to be telling people about religion uh
13:12
because he wasn't a member of the clergy
13:13
it was just you know it was
13:15
quite interesting
13:18
also lewis um nominated tokyo for the
13:21
nobel prize for literature in 1961 and
13:24
the committee rejected him
13:26
and they only recently have released the
13:28
papers which because they have a 50-year
13:30
rule on the committee's decisions um and
13:33
they rejected tolkien saying that he was
13:35
a bad storyteller
13:37
no
13:38
they said the storytelling here is just
13:40
not up to scratch
13:42
wow
13:45
you know that um lord of the rings i
13:47
don't know if this is really common
13:48
knowledge but the beatles tried to
13:50
option it to make it into a movie and
13:53
they approached stanley kubrick to make
13:56
it and what
13:57
i think everyone decided it was a bad
13:59
idea
14:01
once they all saw yeah but um yeah that
14:03
would have been amazing
14:05
they were going to play all the
14:05
characters
14:06
the beatles lord of the rings it would
14:08
have been amazing
14:10
i think i've read like there are so many
14:12
theories about why i was rejected and i
14:13
don't even know why there needs to be a
14:14
theory it's quite obvious but
14:17
well we're gonna do it and then they
14:18
were like no he's such a terrible writer
14:22
we love the beatles we love kubrick and
14:24
the beatles but you know the talking
14:27
thing
14:28
um i read one theory that it was because
14:31
paul and john were fighting over who got
14:32
to play gandalf
14:36
that was what tore it apart
14:39
that's great some things on fancy
14:42
here dress
14:43
there's a lady called shani christie who
14:45
lives in kent and she has a phobia of
14:48
people in costumes
14:50
um which the newspaper article called
14:52
metamphisomyophobia
14:55
and she works in theater
15:00
so um she said people think it's quite
15:03
funny that i'm that i'm working in
15:04
something that means i'm around people
15:06
in costume all the time i have to watch
15:08
people get dressed in costume in order
15:10
to reassure myself that i know who they
15:12
are
15:14
she has to watch them get changed just
15:15
so she knows it's not a fantastic excuse
15:18
for being a pervert
15:21
but also so she's not only got a fear of
15:23
people in costume she suddenly
15:25
recognizes them as the character that
15:26
they're playing yes so she's like at the
15:28
lion king she'll be like hey mike have a
15:30
good symbol
15:32
evacuate the fish there's a lion
15:36
is that the zoo it's me yes me again
15:43
there are a load of cats everywhere
15:46
you say hats
15:50
[Applause]
15:57
i want to know when people started
15:59
dressing as really crazy things because
16:01
they used to dress as um
16:05
you know aristocracy or people from
16:07
different ancient greeks who were
16:08
dressed up as ancient greeks or trojans
16:11
and i think i've pinned down one early
16:13
date in terms of dressing as crazy
16:14
things which was
16:16
1745 king louis the 15th of france had a
16:18
masked ball at versailles
16:20
and there were 15 000 guests
16:23
and um everyone was in nice dresses and
16:25
with masks but he and several of his
16:27
courtiers turned up dressed as clipped
16:29
uh you hedges
16:34
is that you
16:37
and i think that's the year zero for
16:39
dressing as stupid stuff and speaking
16:41
sorry just speaking of um french fancy
16:44
dress do you know the um charles the
16:46
fourth of france um the story of the
16:48
dance of the burning man
16:50
burning men actually this was a fancy
16:52
dress party and uh charles iv and the
16:55
lord of his courtiers came dressed as
16:56
savages
16:58
which meant they blacked up
17:00
and they covered themselves in pitch tar
17:03
and they chained themselves together
17:05
and then when they arrived the party one
17:07
of the other guests wanted to see
17:10
have a good look at their uh costumes so
17:12
i went up to them with a naked flame and
17:14
they were all wearing pitched hearts
17:16
and they and they were all chained
17:17
together and they all went up
17:20
and um i think two people were burned
17:22
alive two people died within days of
17:25
their injuries and it really uh like he
17:27
was pretty mad to start off with but
17:29
that really tips him over
17:32
fancy dress is a dangerous game you
17:34
shouldn't do it
17:35
um
17:36
they got americans got really into fancy
17:38
dress in the 19th century didn't they
17:40
and they would dress up as uh european
17:42
aristocracy and where so it was like
17:45
i think the general consensus because
17:47
people weren't really doing it in europe
17:48
that america didn't really have at that
17:50
time an aristocracy or a history of its
17:52
own um in terms of you know it didn't
17:55
have a great nobility it didn't have all
17:56
these big families and so it kind of uh
17:59
what was that the quote is it bought its
18:00
own history and so people would buy like
18:03
marry antoinette's genuine jewels and
18:05
costumes and then go wearing them to
18:06
parties and you'd go to a party with
18:08
like 1200 guests like the vanderbilts
18:10
used to hold these amazing parts of the
18:11
19th century and it would be a
18:13
competition as to who had the most
18:14
genuine artifacts that used to belong to
18:17
a great british king or a great french
18:20
ruler
18:21
yeah so it used to be a bigger deal than
18:22
just buying a 10-pound plastic which is
18:25
costly
18:26
from the local scotland
18:28
that's great um polar bears oh yeah
18:31
polar bears were in the original fact
18:33
yes they were yeah they dressed up as
18:35
polar bears this is just because i
18:37
discovered coincidentally last week that
18:40
pollution in uh the sea and then in the
18:43
um seas at the poles is contaminating
18:48
various wildlife there and polar bears
18:50
penises are getting weaker their penis
18:52
bones are being shrunken well they say
18:55
that but it is cold up there
18:57
yeah they really don't need that extra
18:59
excuse
19:00
[Laughter]
19:02
it's getting warmer though
19:05
so the female polar bears are going it's
19:07
getting warmer
19:10
[Laughter]
19:19
that's what they claim they don't know
19:20
why politics have penis bones but they
19:22
are getting smaller and they think it's
19:24
going to do some kind of damage most of
19:26
most animals have penis bones done
19:31
most of us on this panel
19:32
um
19:33
lots of animals have penis buttons
19:35
yes
19:36
like in the victorian times they were
19:38
badger penis bones as typhoons
19:41
yeah
19:42
have you seen a walrus penis bone
19:46
i've held one they're extraordinary
19:50
[Laughter]
19:50
[Music]
19:56
[Laughter]
19:57
[Music]
20:02
[Laughter]
20:05
hey very quickly this is uh just to
20:06
bring it back to tolkien and c.s lewis
20:09
um c.s lewis died
20:12
the same day
20:13
as aldous huxley
20:15
we lost two literary juggernauts that
20:18
day and it kind of really didn't
20:21
register with anyone because someone
20:22
else died that day jfk
20:25
and they just completely
20:27
no one actually knows they're dead yet
20:28
as a result yeah
20:31
the guinness book of records for oldest
20:32
writers
20:36
um we need to move on because we're
20:38
really running
20:39
past our time here okay time for fact
20:42
number three and that is andrew hunter
20:45
murray my fact is uh about agatha
20:48
christie and it's that agatha christie
20:51
thought that hercule her most famous
20:53
creation was a quotes detestable
20:56
bombastic tiresome egocentric little
20:59
creep
21:00
she hated him
21:02
uh from quite early on as well in her
21:04
career and she wrote an essay called why
21:06
i got fed up with fyro and she really
21:09
really didn't like him and she um
21:11
she wrote his death story in 1945 which
21:14
was 30 years before she died so she
21:16
wanted to write it quite early and she
21:18
left instructions that when she died
21:20
that story should be published so she
21:21
would take him down with her
21:23
um
21:25
genuinely and she even kept the
21:27
manuscripts in a bankroll that's how
21:29
much she disliked farrow's character um
21:31
and then when she was 85 with her own
21:33
health failing she decided to publish it
21:36
so that she would outlive him i think is
21:38
that's what i think she wanted to do but
21:40
when she did publish the story um foir
21:43
got a front page obituary in the new
21:45
york times
21:46
which i think is might be even more than
21:48
she got
21:49
and so really yeah i'm not sure i don't
21:52
know whether it is
21:54
it's the only fictional obituary they've
21:56
ever published yeah yeah and so even
21:59
even in death he was really really
22:01
famous and she you know couldn't get
22:03
away to properly knock him on the head
22:05
was it front page of the obituary
22:07
section nope it was fun
22:09
of the paper yeah jesus oh we say
22:12
they're dumbing down today
22:15
it is weird when you hear authors hating
22:18
their central characters like when you
22:20
win no don't they like um who was um
22:23
sherlock holmes yeah conan doyle killed
22:25
off sherlock and then
22:27
had to do did you hear what chaos that
22:29
created when he killed off charlotte
22:31
homes i've got yeah i found a bunch of
22:33
stuff um basically he just got he so he
22:35
killed him off uh and then all these
22:37
letters came in which one began you
22:40
brute like they just treated it as if it
22:43
was real it's like the trolling of its
22:44
day yeah exactly to write a letter to
22:47
someone saying you brute yeah
22:49
a lady picketed his house fans wore
22:52
black armbands twenty 000 people
22:54
cancelled their subscriptions to the
22:55
strand magazine which it was being
22:57
published as a periodical um and yeah
23:00
and then i guess he eventually brought
23:01
it back but that must have been a
23:03
confusing time for him
23:06
so a.a milne really hated winnie the
23:08
pooh yeah
23:10
that's so cruel everyone hated winnie
23:12
the pooh he didn't today
23:14
all of his creators a.a milne hated
23:17
winning the pick of robin yeah he like
23:19
was so i mean his life was kind of
23:21
ruined by the fact that he was
23:21
christopher robin and he always resented
23:23
uh i think that's it
23:25
was christopher robin aml's son yes yeah
23:28
resented that and the guy who did the
23:29
illustrations uh who was kind of his
23:32
name but he said it uh e h shepherd
23:35
ruined his life as well ruined his
23:36
career everyone defined it by winning
23:37
the food did they all have meetings
23:39
where they're going not this again
23:42
if only we could stop doing it somehow
23:46
another thing that mill hated about it
23:48
was that um it made people think that he
23:50
liked children
23:53
and he said i have never felt in the
23:55
least sentimental about them
23:58
so
23:59
and he but he did have a son yeah who
24:01
was taking dictation
24:09
you know it seems to be explained by
24:10
this conversation um so one thing you
24:12
can do if you really dislike your
24:14
character this is something agatha
24:15
christie did i love this
24:17
she put a version of herself in her own
24:20
books
24:21
a mystery novelist called ariely oliver
24:25
and in the novels that agatha christie
24:27
wrote this fictional novelist ariadne
24:29
oliver hates her most famous creation
24:32
who is a vegetarian finnish detective
24:35
called sven hereson
24:37
who and she appears in six novels this
24:40
character who hates her her main
24:42
character um and she oliver says if i
24:45
ever met that bony gangling vegetable
24:47
eating finn in real life i'd do a better
24:50
murder than any i've ever invented
24:52
that's a really good how much you just
24:54
like this really good idea of putting
24:56
yourself in novels and then like and
24:58
then the guy said oh easyjet are idiots
25:03
everything that you're annoyed with you
25:04
could put in your pocket another person
25:05
who hates your own creation now is annie
25:07
prue who wrote brokeback mountain oh
25:09
yeah because of fanfiction so she hates
25:13
the fact now so she was like nominated
25:14
for pulitzer prize she wrote this
25:16
brilliant short story and she says she
25:18
wish she'd never done it she's played by
25:20
fan fiction now by people writing either
25:22
sequels to break that mountain or
25:24
alternative endings to break that
25:25
mountain and she said the vast majority
25:27
of them are people who so the majority
25:29
of them are people who start their
25:30
letters with i'm not gay but
25:34
and then go on to give an alternative
25:36
ending two male characters end up
25:38
together i've written an intense searing
25:40
homoerotic
25:41
yeah yeah and i've never written
25:43
anything before in my life and that's
25:44
not the point yeah yeah
25:46
it's not weird oh yeah it's just every
25:48
day a more homoerotic literature from
25:50
people saying they're not gay
25:52
but it does it yeah
25:55
um there are i think more than 100
25:56
sequels to pride and prejudice and
25:58
obviously it's been 200 years so you
26:00
know there's a lot but in one of them
26:02
elizabeth elizabeth darcy as she becomes
26:05
uh is widowed darcy is dead and then she
26:08
has to defend
26:09
england from invasion by napoleon in a
26:12
fleet of hot air balloons
26:14
wow i've never tracked down this book
26:16
but if i do i am reading the hell out of
26:18
it it sounds so good
26:21
and we need to move on guys by the way
26:23
but if anyone does anyone have anything
26:24
else
26:25
uh nothing that's short enough i've got
26:28
just one last thing which is i really
26:30
like when as you're saying poirot goes
26:32
on the front page of newspapers i love
26:33
it when these characters seep into the
26:35
real world and uh there's a thing i read
26:38
that which is the met uh and all crime
26:41
departments uh in britain all the police
26:43
they use a national computer system
26:45
which is developed basically for major
26:47
crime inquiries all the british forces
26:49
use it and it's called the home office
26:51
large major inquiry system but everyone
26:54
refers to it by its acronym homes
26:57
is that quite nice and and there as well
26:59
is a training program for it called
27:00
elementary
27:04
um
27:05
should we move on to our final yeah
27:07
okay
27:08
time for our final fact of the show and
27:10
that is my fact uh so we've been talking
27:12
about books this whole time so i thought
27:14
i'd find a fact which was about the
27:16
enemy of the books the television so my
27:19
fact is that before he invented the
27:21
television john logie baird invented a
27:24
pair of socks to wear underneath your
27:27
socks
27:30
and who who can say which history will
27:32
judge the greater invention
27:35
i'm not calling it
27:36
i just i love that fact because i just
27:38
think that's you know
27:40
because if you look at the history of
27:42
his inventions as well prior to the
27:44
television he invented as well a um a
27:47
razor which was rust proof you could
27:50
never make it rust but it never ended up
27:52
selling because it was made of glass and
27:54
it shattered on people's faces and ended
27:56
up passing it
27:57
okay
27:58
he made a glass razor it doesn't rust
28:01
but yeah but it slices your face
28:04
off yeah
28:05
he made some pneumatic shoes that had
28:07
balloons in them that he thought they'd
28:08
pull your feet off
28:11
but just that's that's his history and
28:12
then suddenly
28:13
the television it just makes no sense
28:15
but the socks were actually quite good
28:17
weren't they they're amazing yeah how do
28:18
they work
28:19
so so they have um
28:21
they're not designed to protect against
28:23
moisture from the outside that it's uh
28:25
the moisture that your feet create when
28:26
you're walking around all day so they
28:28
were for soldiers in the first world war
28:30
and they're sprinkled with a chemical
28:31
called borax which uh
28:34
absorbs the moisture from your foot so
28:36
you put it under your foot facing
28:37
upwards as well you put it on that way
28:39
then you put your sock over that then
28:40
your shoe over there and soldiers in the
28:42
trenches swore by it and it made him a
28:44
huge amount of money is what let him
28:46
resign his job as an electrical engineer
28:49
one soldier said i find the bird under
28:52
socks keep my feet in splendid condition
28:54
out here in france
28:56
foot trouble is one of our worst enemies
28:58
but thanks to the bird under sock mine
29:00
are in the pink
29:02
i hope he could just make an anti-german
29:04
sock
29:05
that might have the worst enemies
29:17
[Laughter]
29:24
um but he advertised them in the
29:27
newspaper and managed to sell one pair
29:29
doing that so initially it was a
29:31
complete failure right and then he built
29:33
a plywood tank
29:35
and carried it around the streets of
29:36
glasgow with the the bed under sock
29:39
written on the side and then he sold
29:40
loads
29:41
yeah this was during the war though
29:43
wasn't it yeah so like a big tank going
29:45
through the streets
29:47
people look scary um
29:49
so he he made these socks and then he
29:51
got ill for a while didn't he and then
29:53
when he got better he suddenly realized
29:54
he had loads of money in his account
29:56
because people have bought all these
29:57
socks will he win
29:59
didn't he go away oh got away yeah but
30:01
when he when he um got all this money he
30:03
went to trinidad
30:05
and he started up a jam factory uh
30:08
unfortunately um
30:10
the local insect life either ran off
30:12
with the sugar or landed in the hot
30:14
that's a boiling preserve
30:16
wow i think i read and so it never took
30:19
off because it was just insects
30:21
just full of insects
30:23
and so he lost a bit of money from that
30:25
and then came back and then it was when
30:26
he invented the television but when it
30:29
when he came back before inventing the
30:31
television
30:32
i think he had the sock business and the
30:34
razor the jam and the razor yeah he then
30:38
he then he had 200 quid left he was
30:40
really broke so he decided to buy two
30:43
tons of australian honey
30:45
cheap and starts and selling it uh for p
30:48
to people and then he bought a ton of
30:49
soap and he sold that wow then
30:51
television
30:53
completely out of nowhere
30:54
to be fair the television thing was
30:56
something that he he really dreamed
30:58
about making quite early on and he
31:00
couldn't do it so he had all these other
31:02
businesses that went along the way um so
31:04
they were just kind of maybe a smoke
31:05
screen there's other inventions to throw
31:07
people off ascend they absolutely were
31:09
uh in that as well as uh when he would
31:12
just make these other things uh when he
31:14
was making the tv anytime he had a photo
31:16
where he was showing how he was making
31:18
the tv he would put in fake objects so
31:21
that no one who saw the photo could go
31:22
okay so he's got that and got that so he
31:24
would he would misplace so yeah yeah he
31:27
waited so you need okay so it looks like
31:28
he needs two tons of cheap australian
31:30
honey
31:32
to get the tv to work
31:37
where did the socks go
31:39
[Laughter]
31:40
you were saying about the electricity
31:42
when he was working in glasgow
31:45
he decided to try and make artificial
31:47
diamonds by passing electricity through
31:49
a stick of graphite and he put so much
31:52
electricity through the stick of
31:53
graphite that he caused a blackout over
31:55
the whole of glasgow
31:57
wow
31:58
there's a weird coincidence in his life
32:00
as well just one of those tiny things
32:02
that's actually it's quite nice when you
32:04
discover it um
32:06
he went to school with a guy
32:08
who was called so this and this was his
32:11
classmates his actual classmate he went
32:13
to school with a guy called jcw reef
32:16
who we now know is lord wreath
32:19
so basically the inventor of the
32:20
television went to school with the man
32:23
who defined television for the bbc
32:25
in england it's an absolutely insane
32:27
coincidence and he got bullied by lord
32:29
reid
32:30
all the time he just bullied the hell
32:32
out of him and lord reid's parents had
32:34
to pull him out of school because he was
32:35
just too much of a menace in that school
32:37
wow really yeah lord wreath was a bit of
32:40
a he was a bully yeah yeah that's
32:42
amazing and did john lagerberg think
32:44
i'll get back at him i'll invent
32:46
something that's so good he won't ever
32:47
be able to take part in it
32:50
he'll have nothing
32:52
i've read
32:53
i don't i cannot believe this is true
32:55
that originally uh when the bbc sent out
32:58
experimental uh transmissions which was
33:01
in 1929 that john logan beard had to pay
33:04
the bbc to transmit his images
33:07
right she's just so topsy-turvy yeah but
33:09
like lord reef um for as much as he's
33:11
done for tv and if you haven't heard the
33:13
name lord wreath in this country most
33:16
people have i'm assuming he's the guy
33:18
who absolutely defined how the bbc
33:19
became the thing that it is he hated
33:21
television yeah of course you did yeah
33:23
because you know because
33:25
invented it
33:28
his salary was 5 000 pounds and a mean
33:30
wedgie
33:34
just on um authors early inventions and
33:36
early careers before they did the thing
33:37
that we know them for can i tell you
33:38
very quickly about daniel defoe yes
33:40
please okay his early jobs and obviously
33:43
robinson crusoe and the dire journal of
33:45
the plague year all these incredible
33:47
works um before that his early jobs
33:49
included selling hosiery dealing wine
33:53
investing in a diving bell to recover
33:55
sunken treasure and harvesting musk from
33:58
the anal glands of cats
34:00
did you say
34:04
[Laughter]
34:13
in 1692 he bought 70 civic cats for 850
34:17
quid because they the dutch made perfume
34:19
using the musk which they secrete as the
34:21
base ingredient and he hated them and
34:24
then to get the musk an attendant had to
34:26
put them in a special cage so they could
34:28
only face one way they couldn't turn
34:30
around and then i'm quoting here um
34:33
use a spatula to scrape out the
34:35
butter-like secretion that gathered in a
34:37
pouch between the tail and the anus
34:39
and then he lost the cats because he
34:41
didn't even own them
34:43
he didn't pay for them properly he got
34:44
the money by borrowing it and then to
34:47
keep them he defrauded his own
34:49
mother-in-law who then sued him like he
34:51
was a disaster
34:53
but that was yeah so who's they were
34:55
just wandering cats no they were owned
34:58
by someone else and he bought them with
34:59
money and then someone else said no i
35:01
want my cats back you can use them but
35:03
you don't own them and also where's
35:04
their anal butter
35:08
i'm stealing that i can't believe it's
35:10
not civic
35:11
[Laughter]
35:21
uh we're gonna have to wrap up um
35:25
okay that's it that's all of our facts
35:27
thank you so much for listening if you
35:29
would like to get in contact with any of
35:30
us about the things that we've said over
35:32
the course of this podcast we can all be
35:33
gone on twitter i'm on schreiberland
35:36
andy at andrew hunter m james at
35:38
eggshake anna you can email podcast
35:41
ui.com and we will be back again next
35:44
week by the way thank you so much for
35:46
being here tonight guys this has been
35:47
really fun um for those listening at
35:49
home we'll be back again next week with
35:50
another episode we'll see you then
35:52
goodbye
35:53
[Applause]
36:04

00:00
[Music]
00:09
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:11
no such thing as a fish or weekly
00:13
podcast coming to you from the qi
00:15
offices in covent garden my name is dan
00:17
schreiber i'm sitting here with james
00:19
harkin anna chazinski and andy murray
00:21
and once again we have gathered around
00:22
the microphones with our four favorite
00:24
facts from the last seven days and in no
00:26
particular order here we go starting
00:29
with you james
00:31
okay my fact this week is that bananas
00:33
emit antimatter
00:36
that's not so i've had to get my head
00:38
round anti-matter uh which uh i just
00:41
researched
00:43
i bananas have gone down that road what
00:45
am i doing so anti-letter is just like
00:47
the opposite of mata so if you have an
00:48
electron with a negative charge then the
00:50
antimatter version of that is a positron
00:52
which has a positive charge i know see
00:54
what's weird is i just i for me i still
00:56
don't understand what that means so yeah
00:57
it means that when you say you had to
00:59
get your head round it if you'd actually
01:00
had to put your head around andy mata
01:02
your head would no longer exist wait
01:04
andy mata antimatter
01:06
some kind of freudian slip the presence
01:08
of andy in a room eliminates everything
01:09
else
01:10
but so wait so because what i read was
01:12
the beginning of the universe big
01:13
explosion and what should have happened
01:15
is the universe created enough matter
01:18
which is why we're here yeah but it also
01:20
should have created an equal amount of
01:22
antimatter which in theory should have
01:24
wiped out the matter and we shouldn't be
01:26
here at all if you get to a mata
01:28
particle and an antimatter particle and
01:30
they come together they just explode
01:32
into energy
01:33
put my hand up i still don't fully
01:35
understand it well that's why you
01:36
research bananas like yes so quick
01:38
question about the bananas if banana
01:41
emits antimatter but it is matter why
01:44
doesn't it cancel itself out it doesn't
01:46
matter it's very good answer yeah it's a
01:48
very good it's not very satisfying
01:50
answer though
01:51
so what happens is bananas contain
01:53
potassium yeah and some of the potassium
01:55
uh decays because it's slightly
01:57
radioactive i think
01:59
you might have already known that yes
02:00
the bananas are radioactive
02:02
and what it does is it when it decays it
02:05
emits a positron and turns into argon
02:07
from potassium and a positron is an
02:09
antimatter particle it is and then the
02:12
um positron will then meet an electron
02:14
and then we'll just turn into a little
02:16
bit of energy so there's a tiny reaction
02:18
happening in a banana it will be on the
02:21
outside of banana yeah it's about every
02:22
75 minutes i believe i i read that with
02:25
humans that we're trying to
02:27
create antimatter we've got a tiny
02:29
amount but if we created a lot you it
02:32
would be the equivalent of like an
02:33
atomic bomb explosion yeah i mean but
02:35
much bigger so if we created a giant
02:38
banana
02:40
not only would it explode but it would
02:41
have the radioactive fallout as well
02:43
there is someone on wired um who has
02:45
worked this out and they said to turn
02:48
bananas into a power station um by
02:51
utilizing this fact that they create
02:53
positrons to get 200 watts you would
02:56
need a banana generator with um 2.2
02:58
times 10 to the 20 bananas
03:01
and it would be a sphere full of bananas
03:04
uh 200 kilometers in radius
03:07
and that would create 200 watts do we so
03:09
we don't think big supermarkets should
03:11
be on the lookout for someone ordering a
03:12
suspicious number of bananas
03:16
there isn't uh there isn't a button for
03:18
times ten to the on the automatic
03:20
checkouts is there do you guys know when
03:22
bananas reach the uk
03:25
because
03:26
they think it dates to the mid-15th
03:28
century really they found a banana peel
03:30
in a tudor rubbish tip
03:32
and
03:33
the first you know the first were they
03:35
doing like a charlie chaplin style
03:36
comedy sketch who knows
03:38
we have no idea how it got there and
03:40
it's really freaked everyone out because
03:41
previously archaeologists and historians
03:43
thought that they got to england in the
03:45
19th century um but there's a theory
03:47
this is just a theory that they were
03:49
really common in tudor england but
03:50
obviously by the time they got here
03:51
they'd all be completely black and
03:53
unrecognizable as bananas
03:55
and therefore that's why we have no
03:56
depictions of bananas
03:58
you just picture henry viii eating a
04:00
banana it's so weird
04:02
that's kind of dirty actually that image
04:04
isn't it yeah
04:06
i don't like it
04:09
i read in the uh the qi archives uh the
04:12
victorian guy called lord agramont do
04:15
you know this fact no no okay so lord
04:17
egremont um he spent 3000 pounds
04:20
building a greenhouse where he kept a
04:21
single banana tree because he wanted to
04:23
grow his own bananas and so he managed
04:26
to grow them and the day came where he
04:28
was having his first taste of it at
04:30
which he exclaimed oh god it tastes just
04:32
like every other damn banana
04:36
and had the tree immediately destroyed
04:39
have you heard the story of oberon war
04:41
and the bananas
04:43
this is so good so um
04:45
the banana imports were banned between
04:47
1940 and 1945
04:49
and um soon after that the first
04:51
delivery arrived since the ban which was
04:53
10 million bananas and the new labour
04:55
government said let's have a national
04:57
banana day where every child should have
04:58
a banana great auburn war was a writer
05:02
he was the son of evil in war and as a
05:04
child he and his two sisters they got
05:06
three bananas and they had heard all
05:09
about bananas they were so excited
05:11
and he wrote later on in his memoirs
05:13
they were put on my father's plate and
05:15
before the anguished eyes of his
05:16
children he poured on cream which was
05:18
almost unprocurable and sugar which was
05:20
heavily rationed and ate all three
05:24
from that moment i never treated
05:26
anything he had to say on faith or
05:27
morals very seriously
05:30
isn't that incredible
05:32
um have you heard of banana peelers
05:34
oh i don't think so these are such
05:36
interesting people they were fraudsters
05:38
in the late 19th century and they made
05:40
their living from it was on railways
05:42
they were they would take an old banana
05:43
peel out of their pocket put it on the
05:45
ground slip over on it and sue the
05:46
railway for compensation
05:48
one woman uh called banana anna she did
05:51
that 17 times over the course of her
05:53
career she got huge compensation for it
05:55
it's weird she called herself banana
05:56
anna when she could just be called
05:58
you would have thought wouldn't you you
06:00
thought this already doesn't make any
06:01
sense
06:03
there was this relatedly to banana
06:05
slipping in 1941 in texas first of all
06:08
in the newspaper article where i read
06:09
this there was a ship that was described
06:11
as the first ocean-going cargo ship
06:14
built since the world war this is in
06:15
1941 so paroled america
06:18
hadn't quite predicted what was
06:19
happening around them as in the other
06:21
world war anyway the newspaper reported
06:24
that the first ocean-going cargo ship
06:26
built since the world war was launched
06:27
on a bed of half a ton of bananas
06:30
because it was cheaper than greece
06:31
apparently so the bed it slid into the
06:33
water
06:34
on a ton of bananas
06:37
in 1923 the song yes we have no bananas
06:41
was released it was a massive hit it
06:43
sold 25 000 copies a day
06:46
but this was in sheet music
06:48
uh because they didn't have the
06:49
recordings back then uh and it was so
06:51
popular it spurred a new craze dancing
06:54
the charleston on banana peel covered
06:56
flaws
06:58
no that sounds great doesn't it do you
07:00
know who wrote that uh it was leon
07:02
trotsky's nephew
07:04
yeah
07:05
he followed a very different career path
07:06
yeah
07:07
to his uncle yeah well here's a here's a
07:09
slightly weird link uh the bananas in
07:11
pyjamas the tv show yeah australian big
07:14
tv show it was big here right karl
07:15
marx's grandson i believe
07:17
i played the banana yeah
07:21
so
07:22
uh it started off as a song it was
07:24
called bananas in pyjamas and that's
07:25
what the whole series was based on the
07:27
song was written by carrie blyton who
07:30
was the nephew of enid blyton really oh
07:33
so two nephews involved in
07:36
songs there we go what about bananas
07:37
about bananas so when when i started
07:39
researching this fact on bananas i
07:41
thought i hit a jackpot moment because i
07:43
discovered on twitter there was a an
07:45
account called at true banana facts oh
07:48
yeah unfortunately really disappointing
07:50
let me give you a few examples of the
07:52
facts bananas are actually very bad and
07:54
not good just kidding bananas are yellow
07:56
and healthy
07:58
420 retweets they had me for a second
08:00
there actually yeah
08:02
don't like what someone is saying pop a
08:04
nice banana in their mouth and shut them
08:06
up
08:07
1628 retweets all right
08:10
what do you what's your problem dan
08:11
these are true they are fact and they
08:12
are about bananas bananas are not good
08:14
at soccer because they don't really have
08:16
legs
08:17
really they don't really have legs
08:20
they've sort of got legs
08:23
um you mentioned the bananas are yellow
08:25
[Laughter]
08:27
and i think they're healthy and good for
08:28
you aren't they
08:31
not entirely true
08:33
um
08:34
they are not yellow if you see in the uv
08:37
spectrum
08:38
[Laughter]
08:40
i don't think they'll hold up export
08:44
so yeah they've recently discovered this
08:45
only recently discovered that if you
08:46
shine a black light on a yellow banana
08:50
it glows blue which other plants don't
08:52
do and they don't know why but they
08:53
think it might be to help things like
08:55
fruit bats which prey on bananas uh they
08:57
do see in the uv spectrum and so that
08:59
makes the bananas show up more do you
09:00
say they prey on bananas
09:02
with those little legs things get away
09:05
faster than anything
09:06
actually they don't really have legs
09:10
um
09:10
i read a thing psychologically that if
09:12
you've shown a black and white photo of
09:13
the banana you see yellow your brain
09:15
just projects yellow onto it
09:19
just tinges of yellow you kind of your
09:21
brain just naturally finds
09:23
little tinges of it that is really
09:25
interesting if you so bananas are
09:27
slightly radioactive um
09:29
i read that eating 600 bananas is the
09:32
equivalent of having a single chest
09:33
x-ray i just like the idea of being
09:35
presented with that option in hospital
09:37
how many bananas was it 600 600 well we
09:40
can x-ray the foot of course or
09:43
you could just eat these bananas just
09:45
i'm going to give you 600 bananas um the
09:47
nurse and i are going to stand behind
09:48
the screen
09:51
that would kill you wouldn't it that was
09:52
there's too much potassium more yeah
09:54
what's too much of eating food
09:58
depends on the time span i mean you
10:00
probably over a lifetime but that's a
10:02
long wait for your chest accident
10:06
there was a guy in a hospital he'd
10:09
stolen the necklace and he um at the
10:11
necklace
10:12
and they wanted to get it back off him
10:14
and so to get it back they needed him to
10:17
pass stool and in order to do that they
10:19
fed him bananas but then it came in the
10:22
news and some doctors said this is
10:23
stupid because bananas do not really
10:25
work as laxatives and the only thing
10:27
bananas will do is add bulk to his store
10:32
maybe that was a way of protecting the
10:33
necklace though or the yeah
10:35
uh stomach like bubble wrapping the
10:37
goods i read that they fed him 60
10:39
bananas yeah and um the article just
10:41
finished by saying meanwhile the owner
10:43
of the necklace has said she will not
10:44
wear it again
10:48
[Music]
10:52
okay time for fact number two and that
10:55
is josinski
10:57
my fact this week is that slovenia's
10:59
largest lake blake cirque nietzer
11:02
disappears every year where does it go
11:04
this is so it's a lake called lake
11:06
kirknicker and when it exists it has a
11:09
surface area of 30 kilometers squared so
11:11
it's not volume it's surface area that
11:12
makes it the biggest lake in slovenia so
11:14
there are two terms here polye which is
11:16
a field above a cast and a cast is
11:19
basically a landscape that's got loads
11:21
of kind of soft rock in it and it means
11:23
that waters eroded the soft rock in
11:24
various places and created holes in it
11:25
like a swiss cheese and it basically
11:28
means that the lay gets filled up in in
11:30
rainy season and then it gets sucked
11:32
through these swallow holes or these
11:34
sink holes when it gets dry and the
11:35
water stops coming through and it
11:37
vanishes so wow it'll be a lake one day
11:39
and there's imagine if you were camping
11:41
in like the um in this nice big field
11:43
yeah and then you just wake up and
11:45
suddenly you're in the middle of a lake
11:46
yep be like glastonbury how long does it
11:48
disappear for so it generally has
11:50
disappears between i think june and
11:52
september yeah it's amazing that this is
11:54
the biggest lake in slovenia yeah it is
11:57
a natural wonder it disappears every
11:58
every year but we still haven't heard of
12:00
it isn't it yeah that's truly bizarre so
12:02
you you just went you just got back from
12:04
sylvia i've just gone back from seville
12:05
did you go and visit this lake i didn't
12:07
how bad is that i was maybe
12:09
[Laughter]
12:12
do you guys did you happen to hear about
12:14
while you were there the religion the
12:16
fifth biggest religion that's the video
12:18
yeah i love this company okay so the
12:20
fifth biggest religion in slovenia is
12:22
called the trans-universal zombie church
12:24
of blissful ringing
12:26
and it's um
12:27
yeah it's become the fifth biggest
12:28
religion in less than a year what do
12:30
they do
12:31
they ring bells
12:33
and eat brains
12:35
they have a holy book which says so uh
12:37
it's rules written down it's holy book
12:39
include the fact that it's zombies
12:42
resurrect daily it's holy drinks a beer
12:44
and pina coladas and holy pina coladas
12:48
holy pina coladas and it worships cows
12:51
and it recommends eating the super
12:52
succulent japanese kobe beef and also i
12:55
like this they're sermons instead of
12:56
ending with an r men and with bong
12:59
[Music]
13:01
which i think is cool
13:03
but it's actually i mean it's actually
13:04
really good so it's an anti-corruption
13:05
party and it was set up as a serious
13:07
opposition to rampant corruption in
13:08
slovenia wow and it was cooled by the
13:11
prime minister of slovenia i think it
13:12
was referred to as a bunch of zombies
13:14
and so they embraced the zombie tag that
13:16
is very cool yeah good guys you were
13:19
talking about holy pina colada here's
13:21
another um slovenian drink salamander
13:23
brandy you tried that when you were in
13:25
slovenia damn it well i'm glad you
13:27
didn't try it because it's not a very
13:28
nice way of making it um they take a
13:31
salamander hang it by its back legs and
13:34
pour brandy over its body and so it
13:36
drips into a cup and then you drink it
13:38
and the idea is you infuse the alcohol
13:40
with the poison that the salamander
13:42
makes on its back and this slight bit of
13:44
poison and the brandy apparently gives
13:46
you more of a kick than normal
13:49
uh i was looking up oldest things in
13:51
slovenia slovenia has the oldest wheel
13:55
ever found oh really all this wheel and
13:57
it was found in and i can't pronounce it
13:59
but lujana lubliada yep i think dance
14:03
was right actually
14:05
yeah marshes oh also they have
14:08
you about to say this they have the
14:09
oldest vine it's a grapevine it still
14:11
bears grapes um it's over 400 years old
14:13
the guinness world records book went
14:15
over there put it in their book and so
14:16
they came over and said we'll put it now
14:17
do you know what it's called oh no it's
14:19
called old vine
14:22
so they also like the london tree which
14:24
is that tree that kind of smells of
14:25
semen um and sorry
14:28
have we just spoken about this if i miss
14:30
us no everyone knows about the linden
14:31
tree it smells like semen there's a
14:32
famous michelin web sketch
14:34
anyway the london tree smells of semen
14:36
right they're proud of their linden
14:37
trees and there's a 780 year old linden
14:40
tree in slovenia which is the oldest one
14:42
and every year in the summer the
14:43
government has a political meeting
14:45
underneath it does it smell like very
14:46
very old scenery
14:49
yes
14:50
a long abandoned condom
14:52
[Laughter]
14:54
the government gathers around
14:58
does anyone got anything else something
14:59
slovenia also has yeah
15:01
um the hitler beetle oh yeah if you
15:04
haven't oh yes yes yeah and i think i'm
15:06
not sure
15:08
in my head i thought you meant the
15:08
beatles is in the band and i was like
15:10
who is
15:15
[Laughter]
15:17
it's a cave beetle it's blind and it
15:20
lives in five caves in slovenia it's
15:22
very very rare and it was named in 1933
15:26
by someone who really liked hitler he
15:27
was a guy called oscar schaible and
15:29
hitler wrote him a thank you letter and
15:30
they're now critically endangered
15:31
because hitler fans are still
15:35
uh in the market for them and they sell
15:36
for a thousand pounds each well that's
15:37
why i went to slovenia this year
15:40
also just one more thing just on
15:43
taxonomy i know this is a complete
15:44
tangent but there was a fly
15:46
in 1994 a fossil fly which was named i
15:49
just the letter i right it was named
15:51
that until a researcher said he didn't
15:53
want to have to keep writing i have
15:55
small male genitalia
15:59
it got changed she got changed
16:07
okay time for fact number three and that
16:09
is andy my fact is that half the world's
16:12
tigers have died in the last month and
16:14
nobody knows why what is a saga they
16:16
look like antelopes that are in star
16:19
wars they they look like a dr seuss
16:21
character yes they do yeah yeah they're
16:23
their faces it's an incredibly strange
16:25
proboscis on the front of their face and
16:28
they live in mongolia and kazakhstan i
16:31
believe and bits of china
16:33
and for some reason we don't know why
16:35
but in the last month half of all saiga
16:39
have died wow i think the dying has
16:41
stopped now um you mentioned mongolia
16:43
and china i actually think they're
16:45
extinct there now
16:46
and i think they were driven to
16:47
extinction
16:48
by the fact that they were being used
16:49
for medicine so you could you could buy
16:52
bits of them for quite a lot of money
16:54
and it's their horns isn't it yeah they
16:56
put their uh their ground-up horns
16:57
that's what that's one of the reasons
16:58
they're so endangered in the early 90s i
17:00
think there were millions of them and
17:02
yeah they were hunted partly because
17:04
conservationists were trying to conserve
17:06
rhinos because rhino horn was being used
17:08
as a traditional medicine and so sort of
17:09
encouraged people to revert to yeah
17:12
cyber horns instead as traditional
17:14
medicine and it's thought to be like an
17:15
aphrodisiac in its thought so for
17:16
instance in singapore you can buy
17:18
cooling water which is it looks like a
17:20
normal bottle of water which says that
17:22
this can reduce a fever or just really
17:24
cool you off and if you look at the
17:25
ingredients it's got saiger horn as one
17:27
of the ingredients yeah terrible whoa
17:30
they are really delightful creatures
17:32
they have um there's a website
17:33
ultimateungulate.com
17:35
which has good stuff about them and it
17:38
also says only one word can describe the
17:40
face of the saga bulging
17:44
they have if you look at them straight
17:45
on it looks like their eyes are sticking
17:47
out on little stalks they have really
17:50
really odd faces and they're tiny aren't
17:51
they they're about two foot tall i think
17:53
yeah they're not very big really small
17:54
deer but those noses that they have
17:56
they're pretty extraordinary they can
17:57
heat air in them in the winter yeah yeah
18:00
so if it's too cold they'll take air in
18:02
and they'll just do a quick sort of
18:03
microwave on it
18:05
and then take it into their lungs
18:08
do they sometimes suck in like a little
18:10
jinsters burger at the same time quickly
18:13
i was looking up other animals with
18:15
mental noses basically for this i really
18:18
like the hammerhead bat which looks just
18:20
like a moose it's quite a huge nose and
18:23
its larynx takes up half of its body and
18:26
the way they attract female mates is by
18:29
a big honking ceremony so all the bats
18:31
line up on hang off various trees and
18:34
they all perform this honking ceremony
18:35
through their gigantic larynxes and then
18:37
the female bats will fly past and listen
18:39
and if they like the sound of someone's
18:40
honking then they pop onto the branch
18:42
next to him yeah that's so cool one more
18:45
thing that sagas do with their trunks
18:46
yeah
18:47
they use them to lure
18:49
females male tigers do they make sounds
18:52
through that proboscis
18:54
if they make lower sounds they can make
18:56
themselves seem larger than they are and
18:58
that's more attractive yeah and this is
19:00
important for saigers because most
19:02
matings occur mainly at nights when the
19:04
real sizes of callers are not visible
19:06
so all the female sagas are thinking
19:09
that there's these really beefy kind of
19:11
male tigers around and then during the
19:13
daytime they're like weren't they all
19:14
gone there's just this little weedy guy
19:16
around is it like that thing where you
19:18
wake up in the morning after a one night
19:19
stand and go oh
19:21
you said you know what i was you said
19:26
this is probably the most interesting
19:28
taxonomy thing about antelopes generally
19:30
they are even toad ungulates so that
19:33
group is called rteodaktilla it's
19:35
recently been discovered that these
19:36
share a common ancestor with cartations
19:38
i.e whales and they're all part of the
19:40
same group as quotations and this is
19:42
partly why we believe now that wales
19:45
evolved from being on land to going back
19:47
in the water because there's this tiny
19:49
two kilogram mouse deer which really
19:52
likes being in the water and so we just
19:55
wants to be a whale yeah it wants to be
19:57
a whale and that's kind of the link
19:59
between whales now and millions of years
20:01
ago when these little deer kind of
20:03
evolved to creep back into the water and
20:04
turn this out you have a little deer you
20:07
have a little deer who wants to be a
20:08
whale yeah at night time probably
20:10
telling the ladies he is a whale
20:12
[Laughter]
20:16
and it's because we found ankle bones in
20:17
certain quotations haven't we yeah and
20:19
also they sometimes grow hips well they
20:21
have hip bones and sometimes grow little
20:23
legs on the side of whales they don't
20:24
really have legs not like bananas
20:27
[Laughter]
20:28
i was reading this book
20:30
it was like a book of biology from 1800
20:32
and apparently to say a woman had eyes
20:34
like an antelope was the highest praise
20:36
you could possibly give her because they
20:38
have the most beautiful eyes you have
20:39
eyes like an antelope and nose like a
20:41
saigon
20:42
[Laughter]
20:44
legs like a whale
20:48
also on attractive women being compared
20:50
to antelopes um the word for an arabic
20:52
love poem is a gazelle
20:54
and that is thought to can't be
20:56
connected to the word gazelle because
20:58
often women were compared to gazelles in
21:00
arabic love poetry um so for instance
21:02
there's one poem i think from the year
21:04
to about 650 a.d
21:07
where the caliph abd al-malik frees a
21:10
gazelle he's captured because he
21:11
suddenly realizes it looks like the
21:12
woman he's in love with so he captures
21:14
this gazelle and he's like
21:16
on extinctions uh just one more thing um
21:18
the voluntary human extinction movement
21:20
do you know about these guys
21:22
um so there is the v-h-e-m-t uh they
21:25
call themselves vehement
21:27
and their idea is that humans should die
21:30
out because it would save all the other
21:31
animals on the planet uh he doesn't
21:34
think the people who are in charge don't
21:36
think that everyone should just be
21:37
killed uh they think we should just not
21:40
have children
21:41
that's the idea okay
21:42
[Music]
21:43
and they think that the need for
21:44
children is cultural conditioning and
21:47
actually people don't really want to
21:48
have children and they could take such
21:51
desires and channel them into perhaps
21:53
gardening or adopting a stream
21:56
adopting a
22:08
okay time for a final fact of the show
22:10
and that is my fact my fact this week is
22:12
that barbara streisand had a shopping
22:14
mall built for her soul use and it's
22:16
under her house
22:18
it's got a cobblestone paved street and
22:21
then it's a collection of just old last
22:23
century style shops sounds like diagon
22:25
alley it kind of looks like it when you
22:27
see it i mean it's got a sweet shop it
22:28
has um it has an antique doll shop are
22:32
they all stuffed no
22:34
there's no cash registers what she does
22:35
is she buys it rather than putting stuff
22:37
in her actual house she's just set up
22:38
shops underneath her house to put the
22:40
things that she's bought into so they're
22:42
like cupboards really yeah but they're
22:44
but
22:45
what you're saying is she's got a
22:46
massive cupboard
22:49
but she now like she's taking it so
22:50
seriously that when she's on the sets of
22:52
movies like famously on meet the [ __ ]
22:53
the movie that she was in um when they
22:55
were dismantling the sets she started
22:57
collecting the doors and bringing them
22:58
back when you say collecting do you mean
23:00
stealing
23:01
i think she asked i don't think barbra
23:03
streisand could steal i think she just
23:05
takes it and you go well i must have
23:06
given that that kind of thought that
23:08
gets people in trouble
23:12
a lot of
23:13
money
23:15
but yeah so she has an antique shop she
23:17
has things like benches out the front
23:18
for men to sit on i'm i think she sounds
23:21
tiresome i'm sorry dan yeah i'm not
23:23
defending her i'm just saying this is
23:24
this is what she's doing she doesn't
23:26
know what a shop is
23:28
that's not a mall you don't you have
23:30
there has to be some kind of exchange of
23:31
money for goods in a mall does she does
23:33
she walk around it yeah she walks around
23:36
it if she's going to a party and she
23:38
needs to bring a present she'll go down
23:40
into her mall and she'll pick out an
23:42
item does she do all the voices does she
23:44
does she run around behind the counter
23:46
and say oh that will be 86. mrison oh
23:49
well that's very expensive but i'm sure
23:52
well it looks like it's worth the money
23:53
thank you would you like it wrapped oh
23:55
yes please i'd love it that's an
23:56
excellent barber strike and depression
23:58
thank you very much
24:00
so my favorite thing about barbra
24:01
streisand is that her real name is
24:03
barbara streisand originally but she got
24:05
rid of an a in the name barbara so it's
24:07
now
24:09
b-a-r-b-r-a i think she said she did
24:11
that she wanted to be a bit special but
24:12
like changing her name fully was too
24:14
showy yeah and that seems to be a part
24:16
of herself she's left behind
24:18
designed not to be too showy do you
24:20
think she goes to her starbucks in her
24:22
mole and then
24:25
excuse me what is the name please
24:27
oh well it's barbara okay is that
24:30
b-a-r-b-a
24:32
not actually
24:33
[Laughter]
24:36
in 2006 she donated 11 million 750 000
24:41
to the barbra streisand foundation which
24:45
i'm sure that that money goes somewhere
24:46
but i like that idea because towards the
24:48
construction of vast underground palaces
24:51
so the main thing that i know barbra
24:54
streisand for is the barbra streisand
24:55
effect yes okay okay so this is on the
24:58
internet you try and stop people from
25:00
doing it and it just makes them want to
25:01
do it even more and it started off when
25:04
um some guy took a photo of her house
25:06
and she wasn't very happy and she tried
25:07
to sue him to stop people from being
25:10
able to see it on the internet and 420
25:13
000 people uh went to the website to
25:15
look at this house because of the
25:17
lawsuit and before they'd done the
25:18
lawsuit it had only been down loaded six
25:21
times wow
25:23
so just by starting off the lawsuit it
25:25
meant that everyone then saw what she
25:27
was trying to do did you also recently
25:28
do a lawsuit about no one's allowed to
25:30
release a podcast referring to my
25:31
ridiculously extravagant basement yeah
25:34
and doing and doing a series of amusing
25:36
but also startlingly accurate
25:38
impressions of me
25:42
oh actually relatedly i read this most
25:44
fascinating article in the new yorker
25:45
recently and on extravagant houses the
25:48
second biggest mansion in london after
25:50
buckingham palace is in highgate nobody
25:53
knows who owns it people have been
25:54
trying to find out for years and it's
25:56
this like so it's called wittenhurst it
25:58
also has a ridiculous basement so it has
26:02
a 70 foot long swimming pool in the
26:04
basement a cinema with the mezzanine
26:05
massage rooms a sauna gym staff quarters
26:09
so just just a normal house then this is
26:11
the standard basement yeah it's more
26:12
than 40 000 square feet and the family's
26:15
lawyer the family of the uh that owns
26:17
its lawyer said that he would take the
26:19
secret of whittenhurst ownership to the
26:21
grave the journalist in the new yorker
26:23
who went to talk to the estate agent
26:24
about it the estate agent made the
26:26
journalist leave her phone in her bag in
26:27
a different room while he just discussed
26:29
the house with her i mean it's a second
26:31
it's the only thing bigger than it in
26:33
london is buckingham palace it's insane
26:35
yeah that's incredible the idea of um
26:38
digging downwards now to make house
26:40
extensions is massive and stuff that
26:42
they're building is insane people are
26:44
putting in two-floor
26:45
rock climbing walls and ferrari museums
26:48
and it's
26:50
insane that's what the guy the guy who
26:52
he hasn't been able to build it just yet
26:53
but the foxton's owner
26:55
is trying to get a uh extension below
26:58
his garden where he wants to keep his
26:59
ferraris as a ferrari museum as a museum
27:02
though will the museum be open to the
27:03
public or will it be one of these
27:07
oh what a lovely ferrari you enormously
27:10
wealthy man
27:12
have you guys read about this guy who
27:14
posted on reddit earlier on this year i
27:16
think but he moved into a studio
27:17
apartment somewhere somewhere in england
27:19
and he found a trap door and he saw a
27:21
trapdoor on the floor that hadn't been
27:22
the estate agents haven't mentioned it
27:24
opened it turns out it's an old english
27:26
monastery conversion underground so he
27:28
bought a studio apartment he now has 30
27:30
rooms fantastic quite exciting
27:36
[Laughter]
27:38
i would do the same thing but i live on
27:39
the first floor
27:41
there's a mirror kingdom underneath mine
27:45
um the white house
27:47
has an amazing bunker and they're
27:49
currently building in fact they're going
27:50
to be moving barack obama and the oval
27:52
office this year away to another
27:54
location in the white house because they
27:56
now need to add all the extensions
27:58
because he has a trap door underneath
28:00
desk trap just burns there's a trapdoor
28:00
oh yes the
28:03
for the president underneath the desk
28:04
that's what it says the exact the
28:06
existing trap door under the president's
28:07
desk leading down to the secret service
28:09
command post will be modified so this is
28:11
what's currently going on uh to allow
28:13
presidential passage directly to the new
28:15
underground command bunker now what's
28:17
interesting is now this is from this is
28:18
from the white house's website in 2010
28:21
they started building a new underground
28:23
command center and it was just this
28:25
building that was sitting there that in
28:26
the bush administration the building
28:28
officially didn't exist
28:30
so despite being there they just said
28:32
what we don't know what you're talking
28:33
about it did notoriously have a problem
28:35
that administration with whether or not
28:36
things existed
28:40
[Applause]
28:43

00:13
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:15
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:18
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:20
cover and garden my name is dan
00:21
schreiber i'm sitting here with andy
00:23
murray james harkin and anna chazinski
00:26
and once again we have gathered around
00:27
the microphone with our four favorite
00:29
facts from the last seven days and in no
00:31
particular order here we go starting
00:33
with andy
00:35
my fact is that fish who work as
00:37
cleaners can cheat their bosses and
00:39
their bosses can punish them
00:42
um so this is incredible there are there
00:45
are fish as i'm sure you know who um
00:47
clean other fishes and they eat
00:49
parasites from the skin right so you get
00:50
cleaner fish and client fish is what
00:52
they're technically known as and there
00:54
have been lots of studies of this
00:56
especially by this amazing sounding
00:57
ecologist uh called redund bucherie i
01:00
hope i'm pronouncing his name right who
01:02
has studied these guys so much and
01:04
basically the trade is for food versus
01:06
clean skin yeah but the cleaner fish
01:09
they sometimes cheat because they
01:10
actually like eating the thick mucus
01:12
that covers the client fish as a
01:14
protective layer and they often have a
01:15
cheeky bite of it instead of eating a
01:17
parasite
01:19
and that makes the client fish jump i
01:21
guess in pain
01:22
so that's them cheating it and then
01:23
their bosses the clientfish punish them
01:25
by chasing them around
01:27
and the cleaner fish which have been
01:29
chased around them behave better in
01:30
future
01:31
they stop misbehaving as much right when
01:33
they've been chased about what are they
01:35
threatening to do when they chase them
01:36
around because in the end they want to
01:38
be
01:38
making contact with
01:40
it's like being chased around by someone
01:42
you really fancy
01:43
it's like you don't run that fast it's
01:45
like being chased by your boss
01:47
you know
01:48
because they're often bigger fish or
01:49
they're often predatory like when you're
01:51
being chased by your boss
01:53
secrets of qr exposed
01:57
um so yeah if there are lots of uh
01:59
client fish then the cleaners have the
02:00
upper hand because they're more on
02:02
demand and so they try and take more
02:04
bites of mucus because they know that
02:05
they've got a captive market right yeah
02:08
because the client fish have to get
02:09
cleaned somewhere yeah genius so they
02:11
propagate the problem in order that they
02:13
can solve it which is kind of exactly
02:14
what a lot of human industry does right
02:17
uh i guess so yeah what how do they
02:19
propagate the problem aren't they making
02:21
it making it worse they're tricking that
02:23
not really no because they're not
02:25
they're not lowering the number of
02:26
client fish available okay
02:28
but client fish no actually they're sort
02:30
of up because
02:31
client fish remove their custom if they
02:33
get bad
02:35
and they kind of keep going back to the
02:37
same species or the same fish that they
02:40
really like and have good service from
02:41
don't you yeah really yeah okay that's
02:43
really cool and they set up do they have
02:45
this like service huge service stations
02:47
yeah there are hundreds of them or
02:48
something yeah they have they're all
02:50
over the ocean especially on uh reefs
02:52
that's where you get them just a big
02:53
welcome break of cleaners
02:56
basically
02:58
yeah
02:58
[Music]
03:01
um yeah a single cleaner fish inspects
03:04
more than 200 2 300 fish a day
03:07
wow and it eats about 1200 parasites
03:10
that's an impressive rate of work
03:12
and some client fish had themselves
03:13
cleaned every five minutes
03:15
[Laughter]
03:20
so this is quite a recent discovery
03:22
right yeah this is a scuba diver who was
03:24
yeah um
03:26
which is really cool because it just
03:27
makes me wonder what are the mysteries
03:29
of fish you know there's so many things
03:31
that we don't like i was reading as well
03:33
there's a i can't remember what the fish
03:34
is called now but it's a fish that
03:35
basically sunbathes it goes to the
03:37
surface of the water and it just laser
03:39
for half the day they've had no idea why
03:40
it does that until recently uh they just
03:42
put a camera on it and worked out that
03:44
it was going really deep and it was and
03:46
it was finding all these other little
03:48
things to eat and the coldness meant
03:50
that it needed to get up there to get
03:51
the heat back down like just to regulate
03:53
their body temperature yeah but they
03:55
didn't know that up until recently so
03:56
we've just had floating sunbathing fish
03:58
up until a year or so ago well so
04:00
they're just warming themselves up so
04:01
that they can conserve heat to go back
04:03
down to the cold water yeah i think
04:05
they're called sunfish yes
04:06
yes here's a cool thing they get cleaned
04:09
themselves by albatrosses
04:12
that doesn't sound like cleaning that
04:14
sounds like the albatross is trying to
04:15
eat them but no it wouldn't quite get a
04:17
great because they're huge as well the
04:18
biggest ever found weighed 2.3
04:21
they're massive um and when they get
04:23
infested with these parasites which
04:25
obviously they suck their blood and
04:26
they're horrible albatrosses land nearby
04:28
as they sunbathe and pick the parasites
04:30
off them wow wow isn't that incredible
04:32
yeah that's pretty cool that reminds me
04:34
of um for some reason it reminds me of
04:36
humpback whales get parasites on them
04:38
don't they they get lice on them and
04:40
that's when you see a whale breaching
04:42
and then hit like jumping out of the
04:43
water and then splashing back down again
04:45
it's often trying to dislodge the
04:46
parasites is that the equivalent of a
04:48
dog dragging itself along the ground
04:51
[Music]
04:53
it's slightly more romantic than that
04:55
but yeah because you don't get couples
04:57
going on special holidays to watch dogs
04:59
dragging themselves
05:04
i don't know if i've seen that
05:06
do you have a sick dog
05:10
[Music]
05:15
i mean i've never seen it in real life
05:16
but i've seen it in cartoons and stuff
05:21
tom and jerry's change isn't it
05:24
um the so this is another parasite so
05:27
oxpeckers um have a similar relationship
05:29
to things like rhinos and buffalos
05:31
what's that ox pekka it's a kind of bird
05:33
um so and also
05:35
it sure does ah it pecks oxen and zebras
05:39
and rhinos it's a fitting name um and so
05:42
it sits on them and eats ticks and
05:43
parasites that live on them but they
05:46
also trick their hosts because they
05:48
obviously they've got a vested interest
05:50
in getting more ticks and parasites to
05:51
come and you know land on these animals
05:53
and so they exacerbate their wounds or
05:55
if they've got a bit of blood bloodied
05:57
wound exposed then the icebergs will
05:59
come and peck it make it a bit worse to
06:01
make sure that more parasites come and
06:03
then they can eat the parasites
06:08
who makes your house more dirty just
06:10
some more cleaners
06:11
[Laughter]
06:13
i think i'm gonna need to hire another
06:14
cleaner before you know it you've just
06:15
got hundreds of cleaners
06:18
and a dirty dirty dirty house yeah um
06:21
so there is there are really cool photos
06:23
on the mail of there's a 13 year old who
06:24
went snorkeling in indonesia and he
06:26
persuaded a shrimp to clean his teeth
06:28
wow
06:31
come on yeah
06:32
i'm not going to tell anyone and you're
06:34
probably going to enjoy it he snorkeled
06:35
down to whether it because he's he found
06:37
a cleaning station one of these garages
06:39
basically where they they and
06:41
there it's not fish it's shrimp it just
06:43
happens to be owned and operated by
06:44
shrimp and um
06:46
he opened his mouth and it went into his
06:48
mouth and it removed bits of food from
06:49
between his teeth wow yeah i've seen
06:51
that it's pretty gross unbelievably cool
06:53
i'll put up pictures of it on twitter if
06:55
you've just been eating shrimp though
06:56
that wouldn't be very nice oh my god
06:58
that's true
06:59
such a good point jeff
07:03
that's like having a car made of
07:05
mechanics
07:08
um quite an expensive dental treatment i
07:10
think flying to bali every time you have
07:12
to
07:12
clean your
07:15
their teeth
07:16
but they're also they're mimic fish so
07:18
cleaner fish have a bright blue stripe
07:20
along them often or they're really
07:21
brightly covered they're kind of to
07:22
advertise themselves and say hey look
07:24
i'm here i'm bright and i'm happy to
07:25
clean your teeth um or eat the parasites
07:27
or whatever but there are mimic fish
07:29
which have evolved the same kind of
07:30
stripe hang around near cleaner fish and
07:32
just go around
07:33
taking chunks out of just eating the
07:35
mucus only yeah eating the mucus exactly
07:37
and that that damages trade
07:40
because it makes fish at the station
07:41
more nervy and these stations they're
07:43
like um um what's a good they're like
07:46
neutral territory in the ocean so you
07:48
get even sharks turning up to the
07:49
parasites cleaned up and they don't eat
07:51
fish that they would normally be hunting
07:53
and killing and eating because it's kind
07:55
of safe it's a safe zone for all fish
07:58
okay so if you fall out of a boat in the
08:01
middle of the ocean yeah what you need
08:03
to do is find one of these areas and
08:05
then no sharks will eat you because
08:07
you're safe and then you're in the
08:08
neutral zone exactly and you get a good
08:10
floss
08:14
my favorite mutualism like mutualistic
08:17
relationship underwater is actually
08:19
shrimp based it's the relationship
08:21
between shrimps and gobi fish have you
08:23
seen this so shrimps and gobi fish have
08:25
this really sweet relationship where the
08:27
gobi fish gets the shrimp to build it
08:29
the gobi fish lives in um little dugouts
08:31
in the sand at the bottom of the ocean
08:33
and it get employs the shrimp to build
08:35
its little dugout
08:37
and then it keeps the shrimp on as a
08:39
permanent cleaner to clean its house so
08:41
they both live together in this house
08:42
and the gobi shim is employing the gobi
08:45
fish is employing the shrimp to clean
08:46
his house and to build it but what's he
08:48
playing and in exchange because the
08:51
shrimp doesn't have very good eyesight
08:52
so can't really spot when predators are
08:54
coming so the gobi fish sits at the top
08:56
of the burrow and looks out for
08:57
predators and they're always in contact
08:58
so the gobi fish always has a little fin
09:00
touching the shrimp and if there's a
09:02
predator he'll like wave his fin at the
09:03
shrimp right back in the hole sounds
09:05
like a great sitcom doesn't it yeah but
09:08
also the
09:10
the other shark or fish whatever must
09:12
know that the gobi is hiding so you got
09:14
any shrimp at home today oh no
09:16
no i fired him he was he wasn't doing a
09:18
good job what are you holding on to down
09:20
there no nothing
09:22
show me your fin the other one
09:26
yeah so some of these cleaner fish um if
09:28
they eat too much
09:30
if you're a female cleaner fish if you
09:32
eat too much you turn into a male so you
09:34
get bigger and bigger and you turn into
09:35
a male right it's i don't quite know how
09:38
that works but it does work and
09:40
apparently uh there's some very new
09:41
research that says that male cleaner
09:43
fish will aggressively nudge their mates
09:46
uh to watch their diet so if they're
09:48
eating too much mucus they're like stop
09:50
it you'll turn into a mum
09:55
that is so good
09:59
okay time for fact number two my fact
10:02
this week is that al qaeda's job
10:04
application form includes a question
10:05
asking who should be contacted in the
10:08
event that the applicant becomes a
10:10
martyr
10:11
now
10:12
i have a lot of questions about that
10:14
yeah there's where is the job
10:15
application form available okay so they
10:17
found this as a part of basically when
10:19
they raided bin laden's house and when
10:21
bin laden was taken down they took all
10:23
the stuff from israel he was applying
10:25
for a job so
10:26
now all you have to do is go to bin
10:28
laden's house and then pick up a form
10:29
there
10:30
it's very easy
10:32
but so they they they found a lot of
10:34
books they found a lot of papers
10:35
obviously and the government haven't
10:37
released it for a long time and it's
10:38
just been released and part of the
10:39
papers that were found in his house was
10:41
the al qaeda job applicant form there
10:43
are lots of questions like um what
10:45
objectives would you like to accomplish
10:46
on your jihad path
10:48
which i think is such a nice i guess
10:50
they don't ask where will you be in the
10:51
next five years
10:52
[Laughter]
10:56
and hobbies they want to know hobbies
10:58
really yeah hobbies and pastimes is
11:00
another question do you know that bin
11:01
laden was a really good volleyball
11:03
player no did he yeah he was whenever
11:06
they used to have um volleyball
11:07
competitions in al-qaeda um he and
11:10
mohammad atef had to be on different
11:12
teams because they were both by far the
11:14
best players wow he was really tall
11:16
wasn't he yeah he was but was he really
11:18
good in the way that we've often said
11:19
kim jong-un is great at golf you know
11:21
like were people just letting him win
11:24
every shot kind of thing maybe i wonder
11:26
i thought he was on dialysis
11:29
this might have been earlier before the
11:31
um okay because a lot of the best
11:33
volleyball players are not on dialysis
11:35
it's true that's a good fact it's
11:36
possibly nintendo wii that he was on
11:38
volleyball on as well i suppose if you
11:40
have to stay indoors all the time
11:42
exactly
11:43
didn't was was he found with some kind
11:44
of games console oh no he had loads of
11:46
dvds loads of dvds lots of pornography
11:49
lots of pornography but yeah they've not
11:50
released the titles of but they said
11:52
they had he had a big
11:54
yeah yeah because they they've they've
11:56
said that he had a lot of books and they
11:58
released the titles of the books that he
11:59
had which included gnome chomsky books
12:01
and really oddly um conspiracy theory
12:03
books about 911 which is really
12:05
interesting oh really yeah yeah he had a
12:07
lot of them and a huge stash of
12:09
pornography they've not told us what
12:11
they are one thing that's said though is
12:12
that um apparently
12:14
uh extremists often have pornography as
12:17
a way of communicating so they'll have
12:18
coded messages within it that is true
12:20
yeah steganography it's called
12:22
um when you put messages in pictures
12:25
okay and um terrorists usually use
12:27
pornography what so they set up a pawn
12:29
shoot in order they can plant a message
12:32
into the scene somewhere i think they
12:34
use existing photos
12:38
that is the most convoluted excuse for
12:40
seeing naked women i'm looking for a
12:43
message
12:45
i have to look really closely at this
12:47
one i'm afraid probably for hours
12:49
i probably gotta take it with me
12:50
actually guys
12:52
um
12:53
i'd like to thank you for uh this fact
12:54
dan because now in the course of
12:56
researching application forms for
12:58
terrorism i have in my google record the
13:00
phrase apply to join isis
13:05
and i am as i speak on the un terror
13:08
watch list
13:10
you probably are that's weird to think
13:12
that yeah that will have a lot of google
13:13
something like that five minutes ago and
13:15
now that's never leaving me isn't there
13:17
um a like a removals company in the uk
13:20
called isis or used to be called isis
13:22
and then they had to change their name
13:23
or as a building company or something
13:24
there are lots of there are lots of
13:26
firms actually so there's um ann summers
13:28
they were bringing out a line called
13:30
isis i think we've mentioned this on the
13:31
podcast before right and they they they
13:33
said well it's too late to change it now
13:36
we've been working on this for six
13:37
months
13:39
the best one was about that is um the
13:41
people who had a 21st birthday party do
13:44
you remember that no so it's a 21st
13:46
birthday party they had two balloons
13:48
that said 21st to a two and a one but
13:50
from the other side of the room it
13:51
looked like i s so from outside it
13:54
looked like i s and people called the
13:56
police and said we think there's a you
13:58
know
13:59
as if the nicest birthday party exactly
14:01
as if they'd advertise where they were
14:02
with you i don't know if they have isis
14:04
balloons they don't seem like the kind
14:06
of party balloon sort of guys yeah
14:08
i was in oxford a few weeks ago and
14:10
there was an nhs
14:12
sort of small building that was called
14:14
isis out on the front of it as well and
14:16
right next to the sign isis there was
14:18
another sign that they put outside in
14:19
paper that said um please do not lean
14:22
your bicycle against our wall and you're
14:24
like that i am definitely i'm not going
14:25
to leave no bicycles on that wall
14:28
this is fantastic um you know the
14:31
questions that you get asked on forms so
14:33
the us visa form oh he has some very
14:35
very weird questions like um are you
14:37
coming to the us to engage in
14:38
prostitution
14:40
do you belong to a clan or tribe and
14:43
have you ever been responsible for
14:44
quotes particularly severe violations of
14:47
religious freedom so presumably
14:50
trivial violations of religious freedom
14:52
are okay but the re you know the reason
14:54
they do this no you have to answer all
14:55
these is it because then if you uh
14:58
answer it um and you lie then they can
15:00
kick you out because you've lied on a
15:02
farm yes so it's so that they have a
15:04
reason to say you've um you've obtained
15:06
a visa by fraud or misrepresentation and
15:08
that in itself is enough of a reason to
15:10
ask you to leave the country so that's
15:11
why they do it did you see the mexican
15:13
visa application one no no no so this is
15:15
one of the questions on it since been
15:17
taken off
15:18
describe your mustache beard
15:20
[Laughter]
15:23
that cannot be true
15:27
it was in either the independent or the
15:29
telegraph um it was in the telegraph
15:30
they did a survey of questions you've
15:32
been asked on a visa form this is what i
15:34
checked the date on that because that
15:35
does sound very i was suspect it was one
15:38
respondent and he said the options were
15:40
scant bushy or clipped
15:44
i have to say i wasn't going to read
15:45
this out either
15:46
[Laughter]
15:48
too much of a risk
15:49
hey one guy claimed it i believe it did
15:52
you see that job application in um the
15:55
isles of silly which was for an air
15:57
traffic controller and it was in braille
16:00
oh really yeah
16:02
and they were like well all of our job
16:03
applications have to come in all the
16:05
different you know in braille as well as
16:07
in yeah yeah writing so scary stuff
16:10
that's good though isn't it yeah in uh
16:12
in russia to get your dry cleaning done
16:14
you have to sign your signature five
16:17
times and fill in a large number of
16:20
forms there's a really good essay on the
16:21
guardian website about
16:22
bureaucracy in russia
16:24
and um
16:25
how
16:26
lots of soviet bureaucracy has basically
16:28
survived
16:30
okay that doesn't sound like it would be
16:31
true in all um
16:33
no dry cleaners maybe it's an especially
16:35
bureaucratic dry cleaning
16:37
is it just one form and there's five
16:39
signature lines at the bottom it sounds
16:41
like dry cleaners as a euphemism for
16:42
something like cleaning the streets of
16:44
london a bit treacherous
16:48
i was at a hotel once and the uh
16:49
president reception asked me for my two
16:51
signatures and i said i've only got one
16:54
and i think it's the funniest thing i've
16:55
ever said in my life
16:57
she didn't have anything funny yet
17:06
okay time for fact number three and that
17:09
is
17:10
james okay my fact this week is that the
17:13
single biggest expense in the computer
17:16
game lego universe was to hire human
17:19
moderators to make sure that people
17:21
weren't making lego penises
17:25
so penis monitoring what it was it's one
17:27
of those games like minecraft where you
17:29
can build things and whatever and a lot
17:31
of people of course when you can build
17:32
anything you want if you can draw
17:33
anything you want a lot of people draw
17:35
penises uh and they wanted to come up
17:38
with a way of stopping people from doing
17:39
this because they wanted other people to
17:41
go into your world
17:42
and they didn't want children like
17:44
stumbling into the world of someone who
17:46
built a penis
17:48
and so they tried to get a computer to
17:50
be able to work out when their penis is
17:52
around but the computer couldn't do it
17:54
and they just it was impossible to come
17:56
up with a program that would definitely
17:58
recognize a lego penis above anything
18:00
else like sometimes they'd say something
18:02
was a penis when actually it's a
18:04
building and sometimes they would miss
18:05
one or whatever so the only way to get
18:07
around it was to get a moderation team
18:10
who would check every single erection to
18:12
check that it wasn't um a penis oh my
18:15
god and it cost him a fortune and that
18:17
was uh probably why it went off and this
18:20
was tweeted by a lady called megan fox
18:22
who was a developer who worked on the
18:24
project and it was picked up by a
18:26
website called fusion.net who wrote an
18:28
article about it last week see i didn't
18:29
know that megan fox had been branching
18:31
out yeah
18:34
just for the sake of it uh you can
18:35
actually reach her on glassbottommag
18:38
that's her actual twitter handle so if
18:40
anyone has any questions following this
18:41
podcast yeah don't ask me yeah go
18:43
straight to megan wow
18:45
penises stop the lego universe game yeah
18:47
that's such a shame it's such a victory
18:48
for you know
18:50
it's not a victory for innocence and
18:52
joyfulness and play yeah victory for
18:54
people building enormous penises yeah
18:57
but can't they like on most websites you
18:58
have the ability to have a parent lock
19:00
can they just do a kind of parent lock
19:01
and stop children from playing the lego
19:03
computer game maybe maybe no no maybe a
19:06
few mornings
19:07
penises only maybe as an adult if you
19:09
register your penis in it like you say
19:12
i have built a penis uh in my universe
19:17
is something you have to do when you've
19:18
done something much worse than playing a
19:20
lego game
19:22
well the point is it's people like
19:24
they're not worried about the people who
19:26
are going to register it's the people
19:27
who nefariously build these penises and
19:30
their computers can't stop them because
19:32
penises look a lot like other stuff yeah
19:33
they look like buildings snakes
19:38
other penises
19:40
other penises
19:42
should we ban this it could be a penis
19:44
but also it could just be another penis
19:46
in which case
19:47
we should leave it i was reading today
19:49
just on lego uh that cambridge
19:52
is thinking of creating a new post for a
19:55
professor the professor of lego
19:58
not just thinking i think they are doing
19:59
it are you going to be made of lego with
20:01
loads of lego undergraduates as well
20:03
yeah
20:04
that'd be really cool they basically
20:06
lego lego provided them supposedly with
20:09
2.5 mil to create the post so
20:11
and it's going to be about play in
20:13
education and stuff like that but yeah
20:14
there might be a professor of lego now
20:16
okay so things that computers can't do
20:18
maybe um so the u.s is spending a lot of
20:21
money to try and get um facial
20:24
recognition on people when they're going
20:25
through airports to kind of see if they
20:28
look like a terrorist and supposedly
20:30
there might be some little micro
20:31
expressions that people give off like if
20:34
they're worried by the fact that they
20:35
have to go through security
20:37
but apparently the face of a man about
20:39
to detonate a suicide belt has the same
20:42
expression as a man who realizes he has
20:44
left the stove on
20:46
wow that's why they can't tell no and i
20:48
left the suicide belt in the stone
20:50
oh this is a disaster
20:52
um it's not a because that's what the
20:54
human face is there's not a specific
20:56
expression for a specific situation it's
20:59
an emotion
21:01
so yeah um did you see that play-doh a
21:04
couple of years ago had to withdraw this
21:06
um
21:07
had to withdraw this product that it was
21:08
releasing called the icing extruder uh
21:12
after
21:13
complaints from parents that look like a
21:14
penis and
21:16
it's extruding icing it was extruding
21:18
icing it was to help them make cakes so
21:20
i think it was it was like a shaping
21:22
tool but if you look at it it is a penis
21:23
and testicles um and yeah i think the
21:26
news report said
21:27
unfortunately it looks more like a sex
21:29
toy albeit a three-incher than a child's
21:31
toy which is true
21:33
i think that's surely that's all in the
21:35
mind of
21:36
um the parents it's not looking up it's
21:38
andy's just showing us the play-doh
21:40
picture on his computer now i know oh
21:42
yeah i'm amazed that safe search is
21:44
letting it through to be honest
21:46
but that's fine when you see it actually
21:48
lock on your own laptop yeah of course
21:51
every day andy's mum gives him his back
21:53
lunch puts the parent lock on his
21:54
computer and sends him off to work have
21:58
you heard about the oldest penis ever
22:00
discovered um is it not microbrachio
22:03
sticky yes sorry that is the very very
22:05
oldest penis this is the oldest uh
22:07
man-made
22:08
representation of a penis oh okay this
22:10
is a physical object not just a drawing
22:11
so um it's 28 000 years old
22:15
which is amazing and it was found at uh
22:17
the hauler fells cave in switzerland
22:19
which um is a cave where they found lots
22:21
and lots of really ancient stuff and
22:24
um i just love this sentence about it it
22:26
it it might have been used either as a
22:28
sex toy or to do flint knapping where
22:30
you know you sharpen flints to use those
22:32
tools um and the bbc report said um the
22:35
two being team working holofells already
22:37
had 13 fractured parts of the phallus in
22:39
storage but it was only with the
22:40
discovery of a 14th fragment last year
22:42
that the team was able finally to put
22:44
the jigsaw together
22:47
what do they think were they making up
22:48
some shapes with it before that
22:50
is it an elephant is it an airplane is
22:53
it another penis
22:58
well so that's the oldest man-made penis
23:00
but the oldest graffiti penis [ __ ] and
23:02
balls that someone sketched out the
23:04
oldest known one was discovered last
23:06
year is 2500 years old and it's in this
23:08
aegean island caused called asti pelaya
23:11
or asti palaya um and it was discovered
23:14
when a princeton professor was taking a
23:15
bunch of archaeology students there to
23:17
show them the wonders of the island the
23:19
islands archaeology and they uncovered
23:21
just hundreds of obscene pictures and
23:23
obscene graffiti so uh things like uh
23:27
nicosimos was here mounting timiona and
23:30
various bits of abuse against people and
23:33
um yeah the first picture of a [ __ ] and
23:34
bulls a very clear penis and two
23:36
testicles and the princeton professor
23:38
said dr vlakopoulos who was who found it
23:42
said what we have found is evidence that
23:44
even then people were using a coded
23:46
language of symbols and imagery that was
23:48
quite sophisticated i mean it's not the
23:50
da vinci code
23:51
[Laughter]
23:54
yeah can i just mention this one last
23:55
thing um i think this has been said on
23:57
qi before but i just really like it uh
23:59
which is the small penis rule and i'd
24:01
never heard of it before and it's the
24:02
idea that if you are in a novel trying
24:05
to base a character of someone in real
24:07
life they can usually make an argument
24:10
that you've used them as the inspiration
24:12
they can sue you so michael crichton did
24:13
this thing where he totally took down
24:15
someone in real life in his book but
24:16
then he added this little extra detail
24:18
which was the character has a small
24:20
penis and the guy wasn't able to sue him
24:22
because he had to admit
24:24
that he has a small penis if it was him
24:27
i would just do that and i'd say okay
24:29
fine but whatever you want you can say
24:31
he has added he has drawn a malicious
24:33
portrait of me and then he has given him
24:35
another characteristic yeah i mean you
24:37
would think but it turns out it worked
24:39
and it's now known as the small penis
24:40
rule which is
24:42
something that gets you out of being
24:43
libelous yeah because you could say that
24:45
couldn't you but it's whether or not
24:46
people are going to believe it once
24:48
they've seen the word small penis near a
24:50
representation of you i mean no one's
24:52
going to not say that that was a lie i
24:54
think also the idea is not that it will
24:56
get thrown out of court it's that you
24:57
won't bring it too because there'll be a
24:59
whole cross-examination on the length of
25:01
your yeah like the barbershop effect
25:03
which we discovered which we discussed
25:05
last time that's where
25:06
you don't you just don't want to draw
25:08
attention to this because then it'll
25:09
probably get into the papers yeah it'll
25:11
be very amusing for everyone and you'll
25:12
feel i read the other day um about
25:14
characters um this is a bit off topic
25:16
but you know uh goldfinger yeah
25:19
this was named after erno goldfinger
25:21
who's an architect who did trellic tower
25:23
and a few other things elephant and
25:24
castle and stuff
25:26
and
25:27
he apparently was furious that um
25:29
alexander fleming know that ian fleming
25:33
he was apparently furious that alexander
25:34
fleming had invented penicillin
25:36
uh which really made the plot more
25:38
difficult to
25:40
yeah do you expect me to talk no mr bond
25:44
i expect you to recover
25:48
anyway
25:50
no so um yeah he was apparently furious
25:52
that let's just call him fleming who's
25:54
furious that fleming had um used his
25:56
name and uh threatened to sue and the
25:59
publishers sort of like paid him off and
26:01
also said that they were going to put an
26:03
a thing at the start of the book saying
26:04
it's not based on anyone and it's just a
26:06
coincidence right and they all agree to
26:08
that but fleming wasn't very happy with
26:10
that at all and he was so unhappy that
26:12
he went to his publishers and told them
26:14
that he wanted to rename goldfinger gold
26:17
prick
26:25
okay time for our final fact of the show
26:28
and that is jaczynski
26:30
my fact is that the man who inspired the
26:32
main character in jurassic park is now
26:35
building a chicken asaurus
26:37
which character in jurassic park is the
26:39
main character t-rex i would have said
26:40
the t-rex
26:42
who wants a friend
26:44
no this is jack horner uh who is the
26:46
paleontologist on whom sam neil's
26:47
character is based
26:49
in the film um but yeah he's a really
26:51
famous paleontologist and he is now
26:54
building what he calls either a chicken
26:56
a sauce a chicken sauce or a dino
26:58
chicken
26:59
which gives a general idea of what it is
27:02
how far has he got if he's still on name
27:04
points right there he's been wrangling
27:06
with that for a good decade also but no
27:08
he's got quite a long way so it's about
27:10
genetically back engineering a chicken
27:12
into being a dinosaur or into giving it
27:15
dinosaur characteristics and the three
27:16
main things you need to change are the
27:18
tails so you've got to give the chicken
27:20
a tail because at the moment chickens
27:21
have uh this thing called a pidger style
27:24
which is the thing that doesn't make
27:25
their tail for this move but it's not a
27:26
tail so give them a tail give them claws
27:28
like a dinosaur instead of wings and
27:30
give them a snout not a beak and they
27:32
make
27:39
and yeah they've done the beak i think
27:41
so the tail's the hardest apparently
27:43
getting a tail on the thing
27:44
i've seen a picture of what the beak
27:46
would look like it's pretty dinosaur
27:48
it's like a snout rather than the beak
27:50
isn't it yeah exactly yeah oh well
27:51
that's interesting because but birds had
27:53
snouts for 50 million years so the beak
27:56
is a relatively recent innovation and is
27:58
it better i think they are better in
28:00
lots of ways yeah yeah must be more
28:01
suited to whatever environment yeah
28:03
because if it feels like maybe it's
28:04
getting into small holes and stuff yeah
28:06
right i would becca would be rubbish
28:08
with a snout yeah just bruise his nose
28:10
constantly
28:11
it seems with dinosaurs so they're now
28:13
saying that they had feathers uh that's
28:15
that's a theory coming up i read one the
28:17
other day that the diplodocus we all
28:18
have this impression that the long necks
28:21
is that they go out on a sort of uh 45
28:24
degree angle yeah but actually they were
28:25
right up that's the new theory yeah the
28:27
new theories are gonna go right
28:28
vertically up like a giraffe yeah it was
28:30
it was i thought they were supposed to
28:31
balance each other because it was like
28:33
the tail going out one way and the neck
28:35
going out the other way i think the tail
28:36
goes right up as well
28:37
so
28:38
that's just what it's trying to get for
28:39
a really tight look
28:42
or the goal posts for
28:44
american football
28:46
but i do we know what kind of dinosaurs
28:48
would have had feathers or is the
28:49
prevailing theory that all of them have
28:50
feathers well i think t-rex's they're
28:51
saying yeah t-rex has had feathers yeah
28:53
and they may not have had penises
28:55
any of them take it back to penises i
28:57
think that's something that we're
28:59
confident about isn't it well no no i
29:00
mean we have we don't know that any
29:02
dinosaurs had penises okay and actually
29:04
we're not sure with a lot of them how
29:05
mechanically they had sex um one of the
29:08
things in looking to this because jack
29:09
horners has a number of dinosaurs named
29:11
after him aye
29:13
soros yeah maybe i don't know actually
29:15
do you do you have the names on you by
29:17
any chance pterodactyl yeah oh
29:21
pterodactyl um i thought i knew all the
29:23
dinosaurs i thought i thought they were
29:25
like the classic yeah i thought i knew
29:27
them all
29:28
no is this like when you thought you
29:29
knew all the roman numerals
29:33
no it turns out there's like there's so
29:34
many dinosaurs out there that like
29:36
celebrities have dinosaurs named after
29:38
them right that's how many there are
29:40
like atombra has a dinosaur named after
29:43
attenborosaurus
29:44
nice there's also mark noffler from uh
29:46
dire straits the reason it's named after
29:48
him is that when they were digging this
29:49
quarry they seemed to find this new
29:52
species any time dire straits was
29:53
pumping out over the sound system so
29:56
they were just like get dire straits
29:57
back on and they kept finding more so
29:58
they gave that species to him and
30:00
there's also an elvis one uh called the
30:03
elvasaurus and it was the first dinosaur
30:05
to be discovered in antarctica which i
30:07
always loved you know where i was
30:09
wherever i spent a lot of time as a boy
30:11
where elvis now lives
30:15
i found out really cool thing about
30:16
chickens this week which is that we have
30:18
just found a new state of matter in the
30:21
eyeball of a chicken
30:23
how cool is that i thought i knew all
30:24
the states of mata not anymore james
30:27
yeah no you're falling into my trap
30:28
there
30:30
yeah so there were a few states of mata
30:32
aside from the standard for and uh this
30:34
one is called disordered hyper
30:36
uniformity which is kind of cool and
30:37
it's an arrangement of molecules which
30:39
is really chaotic if you look at it
30:40
close up and then over large spaces it's
30:42
got a kind of uniformity and it
30:44
apparently acts somewhere between a
30:45
liquid and a crystal i think but yeah
30:47
just rocked up in the eye of a chicken
30:48
as they were studying it that's cool
30:50
that's like when um there was you know
30:52
we have phylums so every animal fits
30:54
into a phylum and uh they found a whole
30:57
new phylum and it was on a lobster's lip
31:00
and it was just this total new type of
31:02
life that they'd not seen before how do
31:04
they notice that i don't know how did
31:05
they notice the chicken eye yeah oh this
31:07
doesn't look like a state of matter i've
31:09
seen anyone's eye before yeah like how
31:11
would you even begin to do that so the
31:13
industrial farming of chickens was kind
31:14
of a mistake the way it started oh yeah
31:17
yeah
31:18
um explain well before 1923 when hens
31:21
were raised for meat it was they were
31:23
more or less a byproduct of um egg
31:25
laying birds at the end of an egg laying
31:28
bird's life um it would be killed uh for
31:30
meat but there wasn't quite the same
31:32
tradition of raising lots and lots and
31:35
lots of birds so traditional farming
31:37
favored birds which were good for eggs
31:38
and for meat basically and then in 1923
31:41
a woman from delaware uh called mrs
31:43
cecile steele it's pleasing um she
31:46
accidentally ordered far too many birds
31:48
she meant to order 50 and she got 500.
31:50
is it was it like when you're doing your
31:52
online shopping and she accidentally put
31:54
a thousand yeah exactly yeah yeah um and
31:57
so she sold them and then the next year
31:58
she produced a thousand and her
31:59
neighbors started catching on thinking
32:01
oh wait this is really good and there's
32:02
more of a market for this than we
32:04
thought there was
32:05
so people like chicken yeah in 1925
32:08
delaware farmers made 50 000 birds they
32:10
grew 50 000 in 1929 it was 3 million
32:13
wow yeah election uh herbert hoover he
32:15
promised a chicken in every pot and that
32:17
was the kind of start of this incredible
32:20
expansion of uh battery farming uh when
32:22
people used to cook chickens they used
32:23
to make want to make them sing for some
32:25
reason like it or when it's just come
32:27
out the oven they used to want to make
32:28
it sing and what they used to do is put
32:30
mercury inside the chicken and then kind
32:33
of sew it up and then um that would kind
32:36
of expand and make air inside the
32:38
chicken and then they make a tiny hole i
32:40
think and then it would kind of tweet
32:42
wow wow
32:43
so close it's amazing it's clever apart
32:46
from the fact that it's highly poisonous
32:49
it's worth it though for that so it's
32:50
like taking out on the chicken going
32:53
[Laughter]
32:55
the not everyone is happy with the
32:56
chicken asaurus idea of making a chicken
32:59
asaurus so one of the colleagues of uh
33:02
doctor horner
33:03
has said this it was in a bbc report
33:05
because he said get back in your corner
33:07
jack no he hasn't
33:09
we should have done he should have
33:11
because he gets that a lot
33:13
he said technically you're going to have
33:14
a messed up chicken it's not a dinosaur
33:16
it's never going to be a dinosaur it's
33:18
just going to be a really awful
33:19
monstrosity i would agree with that
33:21
actually i think what you're making is
33:22
not a dinosaur you're making a chicken
33:24
with dinosaur characteristics right but
33:26
if all the genes survive somewhere i
33:29
find that really interesting so the idea
33:31
is that chickens somewhere will have dna
33:33
that was inside dinosaurs right
33:36
well some of it will be inactive or some
33:37
of it would have been thrown away or
33:39
just evolved away what is true is that
33:41
the chicken that you had for dinner
33:42
yesterday its parents were a chicken
33:44
that chicken's parents were a chicken
33:46
and they were a chicken and they were a
33:47
chicken and they were chicken and then
33:48
if you go far enough their parents would
33:50
have been a dinosaur i think that's so
33:51
cool i think one of the main things is
33:53
say for instance the tail um a chicken
33:56
embryo has a tail but then it kind of
33:57
gets reabsorbed back into the embryo
34:00
and there's a gene that does that if you
34:02
can turn that gene off then your tail
34:04
will continue to grow and then you'll
34:05
have a chicken with a tail yeah and
34:07
actually human embryos also have tails
34:09
so really yeah we reabsorb them as well
34:11
theoretically if you could find the gene
34:12
in humans
34:14
and turn that off then you could have
34:15
humans with tails would it be a hairy
34:17
tail like a monkey's tail
34:21
yeah but then again because it hasn't
34:23
evolved with the rest of us
34:25
humans aren't hairy all over like that
34:27
by them
34:28
[Laughter]
34:31
they think getting the tail reabsorption
34:33
gene to stop turning off um is something
34:36
they think they might have cracked
34:36
because they've worked out how to turn
34:39
on a gecko's tail reabsorption so
34:42
scientists have learned how to make a
34:43
gecko embryo reabsorb its own tail this
34:46
is so exciting yeah i think in the
34:47
future when you're having a baby you'll
34:49
be able to tick all the boxes for you
34:51
know yeah
34:53
will it be
34:54
pushed clipped
34:57
straggly
35:00
okay that's it that's all of our facts
35:02
thank you so much for listening if you
35:03

00:13
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:16
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:18
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:20
covent garden my name is dan schreiber
00:22
i'm sitting here with andy murray james
00:24
harkin and ann miller and once again we
00:26
have gathered around the microphone with
00:27
our four favorite facts from the last
00:29
seven days and in no particular order
00:31
here we go
00:33
starting with you
00:34
harken
00:35
my fact this week is that in the 1840s
00:38
london buses had straps attached to the
00:41
driver's arms that you would yank if you
00:43
wanted to stop
00:45
this just seems like the worst idea in
00:46
the world in 1839 they invented the bell
00:50
on um buses and then they decided to go
00:52
to the strap version afterwards oh wow
00:55
so these are horse buses of course
00:58
and in those days you didn't have to go
01:00
on the left-hand side of the right-hand
01:01
side of the road and there were no bus
01:03
stops or anything like that and so when
01:05
you wanted to stop you needed to tell
01:07
the driver which direction you wanted to
01:09
go to the right-hand side of the road or
01:10
the left-hand side so if you wanted to
01:12
stop on the right-hand side you would
01:13
yank his right strap and that would move
01:16
his right arm which would move the horse
01:17
to the side of the road and then he
01:18
would stop um
01:20
i read that they didn't have to even
01:22
pull over to stop for 40 years after the
01:24
horse-drawn bus was invented so 1829 i
01:27
think was the first one and there was a
01:29
new law passed in 1867 which said um
01:32
really you should probably pull over to
01:33
the side of the street before you just
01:34
stop the bus
01:35
yeah until then they would just stop
01:37
dead i think the first buses in london
01:39
they just did the route and they would
01:40
let you on wherever 70 people could get
01:42
on and you just would hail it there
01:43
weren't stops and things i guess they
01:44
just thought well if we let you on
01:46
anywhere you can get off yeah that
01:47
sounds really good actually how did you
01:49
used to park when you had a horse
01:51
attached to your car with parallel
01:53
parking yeah parallel parking
01:54
three-point turns how does the hill work
01:57
you would pull your horses off and they
01:58
would feed or drink water i beg your
02:00
pardon
02:01
if you're a caring horse owner you would
02:03
pull him off to the right if you wanted
02:05
to
02:06
the horse had two straps attached to it
02:08
actually
02:09
okay that reminds me of um another thing
02:11
about people with straps attached to
02:13
them the um huichol indians of central
02:16
mexico uh during childbirth the father
02:19
would sit above his wife who's giving
02:21
birth and have um a strap attached to
02:23
his testicles and whenever she had labor
02:25
pains she would yank on the strap and um
02:29
his testicles so that he would have the
02:30
same pain as her
02:32
great idea my god that is so is that
02:35
when did that stop
02:36
it's a traditional thing i don't think
02:38
it's happened for hundreds of years i
02:40
don't know why that died out so another
02:41
thing about buses is that driving buses
02:43
wasn't actually legal until 1832 for the
02:46
first three years it hadn't been
02:47
properly regulated or anything and um
02:49
drivers would chain themselves to their
02:51
seats but they were still arrested
02:52
anyway they were training themselves to
02:54
stop being you know stopped from driving
02:56
by the authorities yeah
02:58
that's amazing isn't that insane so
03:00
after world war one there weren't that
03:01
many bosses in london keeping repurposed
03:02
during the war so uh mr a partridge
03:05
realized that he could um make some
03:07
money by running his own buses on the
03:08
same route so he'd go alongside the
03:10
official buses but he would sort of take
03:12
shortcuts to avoid traffic and make his
03:14
bosses better
03:15
you often see races between the official
03:16
bus and then the pirates that's great
03:18
when he thought of that idea he must
03:19
have gone aha
03:22
back at the net
03:23
they do that in some other countries i
03:25
think in moscow they have like
03:26
unofficial buses that you can kind of
03:28
get on and they're a little bit cheaper
03:30
than the official ones it's like
03:31
hustling for mini cabs
03:32
driving fast i mean like sun lucia has
03:34
those as well i think they have they
03:35
have sort of well they have a range of
03:37
buses of different levels of
03:38
officialness essentially um do you guys
03:41
remember the bendy buses yeah
03:43
do you know where they are now australia
03:45
i mean we have a lot of them in
03:46
australia i hadn't noticed that they
03:47
weren't there anymore yeah
03:49
ken livingston brought them in then
03:50
boris got rid of them saying they were a
03:51
monstrosity and we didn't want them so
03:53
they went to malta malta has very narrow
03:56
tight roads and they are very difficult
03:58
to maneuver through traffic so they were
04:00
a complete disaster not least because on
04:01
the day all the drivers went on strike
04:03
so they shipped and drivers from the uk
04:04
who didn't know the route or the
04:06
language they caused complete chaos um
04:08
and they're called arriva which is
04:10
arriving in italian and they got
04:12
nicknamed bespeter which means waiting
04:14
because they were just rubbish so malta
04:16
have now passed them on and they're now
04:18
in sudan
04:21
that's unbelievable
04:23
that is really interesting
04:25
do they drive the buses to these places
04:27
or do they fly them
04:28
um i think it's a plane with two straps
04:30
on and then they steer from the ground
04:32
so there's one person who was in malta
04:34
and wanted to go to sudan and like
04:36
finally the bus has turned up
04:38
you wait ages for a bus to sudan and
04:40
then all of london's bendy busters come
04:42
at once
04:44
just back in the day where everything
04:45
was horse-drawn something that hadn't
04:47
occurred to me and i read in a book the
04:48
other day is that if you had an
04:50
emergency and you needed a doctor
04:51
doctors just used to leap on a horse and
04:54
ride to the scene i don't know why
04:56
that's such an amazing image of just
04:58
like a doctor speeding down the road on
05:00
a horse and he had to shout the word
05:02
ambulance backwards as he rode
05:06
i really like this the double decker bus
05:08
was introduced maybe i think about 20
05:10
years after the original holster on bus
05:12
and supposedly it was introduced for the
05:14
great exhibition before they had a
05:15
proper staircase they just had kind of
05:17
an iron ladder which was quite you know
05:18
three or four quite high iron steps but
05:21
there were also seats available on
05:23
either side of the driver
05:24
and there's one book it's called
05:25
transport in britain from canal lock to
05:27
gridlock and it says that the seats were
05:29
hard to get but they were highly prized
05:32
by younger passengers because of the
05:33
driver's great reputation for jokes and
05:35
witty repartee
05:37
so nothing changes does it you know it's
05:38
the original banter bus yeah
05:42
um oh okay here's the thing here's the
05:44
best thing i found this week oh yeah who
05:46
invented the bus
05:47
a jack bus the earliest known public bus
05:50
line it was called the carriage was
05:52
launched by blaise pascal the
05:54
mathematician the mathematician and
05:56
philosopher
05:57
boss company in his spare time no it's
05:59
unbelievable isn't it
06:01
how can that even be true it was on
06:02
wikipedia and i checked it out and
06:04
there's some books um some philosophy
06:05
books about him and apparently it's true
06:08
i know that is incredible i wish i knew
06:10
more about blaise pascal so i could put
06:11
that in context yeah give us a bit more
06:13
then okay so he um in mathematics he did
06:16
pascal's triangle which is a famous um
06:18
load of numbers in a triangle where the
06:20
two above add to the one below uh he has
06:23
the si unit of uh pressure named after
06:26
him he wrote a famous book called the
06:28
ponce
06:30
which was a philosophy
06:31
book
06:32
and he was a great french kind of
06:34
transport enthusiast yeah but yeah i
06:36
mean he was one of the great 17th
06:38
century french thinkers and he also
06:40
invented the bus
06:42
how did the bus fall off from his list
06:44
of achievements
06:45
like well it's the one that no one ever
06:47
talks about these days really yeah i
06:50
read a theory and i'm still trying to
06:51
get to the bottom of this because it
06:52
sounds like there is some truth to it
06:53
but not as much as uh as most articles
06:56
would suggest um do you know why um
06:59
the railroads in this country are the
07:01
width that they are yes it's the stride
07:03
of a yeti isn't it
07:07
no uh it's the idea that um obviously
07:11
when trains were horse-drawn you had two
07:13
horses pulling the train
07:15
and the width of the railroads now are
07:17
the widths of what two horses standing
07:19
next to each other would be now that's a
07:22
theory that that apparently in america
07:24
as well that with all the railroads
07:25
that's how it became but then different
07:27
countries have different gauges exactly
07:29
yeah and in fact britain had two
07:30
different gauges yeah america had 20.
07:32
this is where the theory falls down
07:33
slightly but maybe the horses got like
07:35
fatter in certain states yeah that's
07:37
true that's possible to put diets there
07:39
was a there was a way it could have gone
07:41
um oh god there was an amazing program
07:42
about this ages and ages ago on the beep
07:44
and it was basically saying that there
07:45
were two gauges a narrow gauge and a
07:47
broad gauge for trains and the whole of
07:49
the country eventually went with the
07:51
narrow gauge simply because it had
07:52
spread further and faster like basically
07:55
vhs over betamax if you'd like and so
07:59
now these days we could have these
08:00
incredible lavish huge trains but we
08:03
don't
08:04
have to kind of squeeze through the
08:06
aisle yeah coffees exactly um i have a
08:09
thing about there was a guide to bus
08:10
etiquette printed in the times in 1834.
08:13
i just love this so much um so they're
08:15
quite similar like uh number one keep
08:17
your feet off the seats two do not get
08:19
into a snug corner yourself and then
08:21
open the windows to admit a northwester
08:23
upon the neck of your neighbor
08:39
yeah no because it's summer
08:42
i get really pissed off by people open
08:43
windows you know how you keep learning a
08:45
few things about yourself as the years
08:46
go on it's a new thing i've learned very
08:47
recently if people are opening opening
08:49
windows whenever you walk into a room
08:51
you might be the problem
08:53
else is saying you know what i've
08:54
recently found out i hate people who
08:56
smell bad
08:58
um
08:59
what can you do what can you do
09:01
this bus static then starts to go
09:03
slightly off the rails of where we know
09:04
so number six is do not spit upon the
09:06
straw you are not in a hog sty
09:09
um number seven behave respect relief to
09:11
females and put not on an unprotected
09:13
last the blush because she cannot escape
09:15
from your brutality which is very good
09:17
advice
09:18
number eight if you bring a dog let him
09:20
be small and confined by a string let
09:22
him be small it's like old big dogs are
09:25
going please let me be smart yeah that's
09:27
like on the underground there's like a
09:29
rule that you can have a thing it's
09:30
something like you can have a dog on
09:31
this good if you can hold it so once
09:33
those women hold your absolutely mega
09:38
um so there is a bus that goes from
09:40
bristol to bath which is powered by poo
09:44
oh yeah the bio bus
09:46
and it's powered by biomethane gas
09:48
actually which comes from okay from
09:51
excrement
09:52
and it can travel up to 186 miles on one
09:55
tank of gas you're going to say on one
09:57
pool
09:59
just the driver gets out every 160 six
10:02
miles
10:10
no it can go 186 miles on one tank of
10:12
gas which
10:14
takes the annual waste of around five
10:16
people to produce so five people have to
10:18
poo for one year to get one tank of gas
10:21
yeah that's not so bad yeah cause i i
10:24
mean i just i do that every day not a
10:26
year's worth but like it's not like i'd
10:27
have to be like better
10:29
better like all you'd have to do is just
10:31
bag what you're doing right i see what
10:32
you mean i don't think
10:34
i'm just saying it's not bag what you're
10:36
doing and post it off to bristol
10:38
they'll be thrilled the council
10:39
buildings will be fine
10:46
okay time for fact number two and that
10:48
is miller
10:50
my fact is that standing like superman
10:52
can make you more successful
10:54
i love that which is why i'm doing it
10:56
right now so explain how can that work
10:58
do we know okay so it's a thing called
11:01
power posing which is basically about
11:02
body language and giving off the right
11:04
impression and it's in the work of amy
11:06
cuddy who's a social psychologist at
11:07
harvard who reckons we should all spend
11:09
two minutes a day power posing so
11:10
there's a lot of various possesses you
11:12
can do but the best one is superheroes
11:13
so hands on hips chest out head up in
11:15
sort of classic superhero and people who
11:18
do this will have increased levels of
11:19
testosterone a decrease in cortisol
11:21
which is the stress hormone and feel
11:22
both more powerful and more open to risk
11:25
people who take low posture poses have
11:26
the opposite what are low posture poses
11:28
things like slumping in on yourself it's
11:30
basically making yourself small so this
11:31
thing if you go to a meeting and you
11:33
sort of you know bend your knees you
11:35
tuck your arms and your heads down being
11:37
naked and crying in the corner that also
11:39
sends off bad bad impressions in job
11:41
interviews people they found that people
11:42
if they're with someone who's doing a
11:44
powerful pose in a powerful position and
11:45
rather than copying them you're more
11:46
likely even if you are relatively
11:47
powerful to then adopt a weaker stance
11:49
by presenting as more confidence you
11:51
become more confident so by being
11:52
superman you will become not quite
11:54
superman but with superman like well
11:56
here's the thing it also works if you
11:58
were superman outfits apparently
12:01
um you had less effort so they put
12:03
students in
12:04
various different items of clothing and
12:06
got them to do mental ability tests and
12:08
they found that generally people gain
12:09
about 64
12:11
but people in superman t-shirts were
12:13
getting 72 percent legends uh and also
12:15
people wearing like white coats uh did
12:18
better as well oh this one's interesting
12:19
because yeah wearing a lav coat makes
12:21
you better but they're taking lab coats
12:22
away for doctors so they'll have them
12:24
doing superman poses to counter-balance
12:26
this otherwise it's gonna be yeah the
12:27
doctors will perform early because
12:29
they're wearing the wrong outfit the
12:30
costume thing also actually works for um
12:33
christopher reeve there's a story in
12:35
roger moore's autobiography where while
12:38
they were filming the movie christopher
12:40
reeve during breaks where he can get out
12:41
of his clothes it was lunchtime we'd go
12:43
to the pinewood studios canteen which is
12:45
where they were filming and if he went
12:47
out in his superman costume he was just
12:49
swarmed girls coming around swimming
12:51
around him just totally in love with him
12:53
if he came out during the clark kent
12:54
scenes just no one came near him he was
12:56
just left alone he probably didn't
12:58
recognize him yeah
13:01
i think this is really good i really
13:02
like this i'm going to start doing this
13:03
power posing we should do it all the
13:05
time well you don't you don't have to do
13:06
it in front of people you can do it for
13:07
two minutes when you get up in the
13:08
morning yeah with your day and you're
13:09
wondering those benefits with you there
13:11
is one um bad thing about um wearing
13:13
superman costumes and that is if you're
13:15
a child because apparently um superhero
13:18
costumes cause children to hurt
13:19
themselves
13:20
because they start doing playing which
13:22
is a bit like like they try and fly oh
13:24
no stuff like that um do you guys know
13:26
that superman was originally evil
13:28
no no he wasn't yeah he was no i don't
13:30
believe that well you can take out with
13:32
jerry siegel and joel schuster who came
13:34
up with superman yeah in 1932 they did a
13:36
story called the reign of the superman
13:38
about a homeless man called bill dunn
13:40
who was transformed by a mad scientist
13:42
who uses a secret chemical to help him
13:43
be able to read and control minds
13:45
the superman with these new powers kills
13:47
his creator and starts playing the stock
13:49
market and winning races to get rich
13:50
enough to take over the world and then
13:52
loses it all is that because he likes
13:53
risk because he's been doing these power
13:55
poses that he's playing the stock market
13:57
yeah i think that's what happened um and
13:59
then obviously they rewrote him and he
14:00
was nicer different a second time
14:03
wrapper and an alien
14:05
an insane murderer gambler wow i always
14:07
thought by the way uh that any time i
14:09
saw a portrait of henry viii that he was
14:11
adopting a superman pose yeah yeah he
14:13
does make himself look big that's true i
14:15
wonder how many people from history is
14:16
that where that pose
14:19
yeah superhero history yes superman
14:21
poses in history
14:23
okay there's a guy
14:25
there was a newspaper article i read
14:27
about superman and it said something
14:29
like this when clark kent wanted to
14:31
transform into superman it was a fairly
14:33
simple task he would step into a phone
14:35
box spin around and the switch would be
14:37
complete
14:38
for herbert chavez his change into the
14:41
comic book word
14:43
has taken a bit longer through 16 years
14:45
of plastic surgery
14:48
and yeah he's um had plastic surgery to
14:51
make him look like superman oh her but
14:53
you're beautiful as you are
14:55
just do the posture that's enough he
14:57
doesn't really look that much like
14:58
superman to be honest yeah do you mean
15:00
before or after he doesn't look like in
15:01
neither case did he oh herbert
15:05
with superman
15:06
it is largely the outfit that marks him
15:08
out yeah yes that's why crystal reeve
15:10
when you know not in costume was not
15:12
mobbed because yeah
15:13
yeah you look over and you see a bloke
15:15
just in certain trousers and you don't
15:16
think oh my god i must mob him you look
15:18
over and you see superman you know
15:19
that's very exciting herbert chavez just
15:21
keeps walking into the pinewood canteen
15:23
waiting for people to mob him and go
15:25
another operation then
15:28
oh dear oh okay oh that's so sad
15:32
um i've got one more fact which is that
15:35
uh superman was trained
15:38
to get fit uh by darth vader right okay
15:42
what do you mean christopher reeve when
15:44
he was getting fit for the movie was
15:46
trained by david prouse who was darth
15:48
vader all the star wars was good dave is
15:51
the west country
15:52
it lines in the west country accent
15:52
of one isn't
15:55
which is the best thing possibly on the
15:56
internet yes yeah because we all know so
15:58
a famous star wars thing is that james
16:00
earl jones became the voice um but there
16:02
is you're right footage where you can
16:04
actually hear the west country accent
16:05
coming out of vader's costume throw the
16:07
rebels out the airlock
16:09
is so good it's just not a sinister
16:11
really
16:17
okay time for fact number three and that
16:19
is my fact my fact is that this year
16:22
margaret atwood submitted her latest
16:25
novel and it's going to hit the
16:26
bookshops in the year 2114.
16:30
god bloody publishers
16:31
[Laughter]
16:33
i bet she really rushed for that
16:34
deadline as well
16:38
yeah this is so margaret atwood she's
16:39
the first author who's uh part of a very
16:42
new project called the future library
16:44
project and the idea is that a bunch of
16:46
novelists for the next 100 years are
16:48
going to submit a novel and in a hundred
16:51
years time starting from 2014
16:54
uh the first novel hit the shops it was
16:56
started by a um a scottish artist called
16:59
katie katie patterson she had this idea
17:02
that it would be nice to do a long-term
17:04
project and also the way they're going
17:06
to publish it is they're growing a
17:07
forest out in oslo in 100 years time
17:10
they'll chop the trees down and they
17:12
will be turned into the books it's so
17:14
cool yeah it's the big project going on
17:15
i read that they're putting a printing
17:17
press in the library as well so make
17:18
sure that if in 100 years we don't have
17:20
the printing technology we have today
17:21
they can still turn the trees into paper
17:22
and make sure those books definitely get
17:24
read in a hundred years good idea can
17:25
you imagine if 100 years from now we
17:27
really mess up this planet and we're
17:28
really low on trees and suddenly they're
17:30
like well we're just going to take this
17:31
forest down but then the magra atwood
17:34
robot with her brain inside it a massive
17:36
robot comes along and stops people and
17:38
she pushes that says no these are my
17:40
trees that's a very cool idea the
17:42
margaret atwood robot i love that i
17:44
think she would like it yeah she would
17:45
she's a sci-fi writer
17:47
it's such a
17:48
good and strange idea but you're right
17:50
because it's like it's like people 150
17:53
years ago saying well we're going to
17:54
have this extraordinary telegram
17:56
competition in 100 years time and
17:58
telegrams will be sent all over the
18:00
world and we we have no idea what's
18:02
going to happen in the next hundred
18:03
years so i like it's optimal i like that
18:04
the printing press is a really good idea
18:06
it's lasted quite a long time though
18:07
haven't they yeah so there's a
18:08
reasonable chance they will again
18:09
because when you say it it sounds very
18:11
futuristic but i think actually a
18:12
hundred years ago we still read novels
18:13
from 100 years ago like
18:15
older than that obviously but yeah it it
18:17
it could be reading could be the same or
18:19
it could be completely different but
18:20
they'll say that you know if the world
18:22
changes like language could be different
18:24
or there's a thing that people think
18:25
that handwriting might start dying out
18:26
so just what will people in 100 years be
18:28
doing and reading and writing yeah none
18:30
of us will know but it's actually it's
18:32
100 it's you're right it's not that long
18:34
like this year has gone really quick
18:38
from a personal
18:41
i just perspective a few more of those
18:42
and then you're there so they said in
18:44
this project you you can submit anything
18:46
it can be like one word it can be a poem
18:48
it can be another one
18:50
that's a very dangerous idea for authors
18:51
because they will submit one word
18:54
you'd spend about three weeks on that
18:55
one word
18:56
at the end of it you've got nine percent
18:57
of the forest left
18:59
the picture is fine it's i think it's
19:01
nice that in a hundred years time some
19:03
people somewhere will definitely be
19:04
reading books as we know them well we'll
19:06
still be there i read that in 2115
19:09
which is 100 years in the future people
19:12
have predicted that they'll only be 600
19:13
languages left on earth as opposed to
19:15
today's six thousand oh god so whatever
19:18
language margaret atwood's written and
19:19
you better hope that's one of them yeah
19:21
if that's usually english presumably
19:22
english yeah that's awful yeah there
19:25
must have come a tipping point where the
19:26
world stopped gaining languages and
19:27
started losing them i don't know we've
19:29
got the avatar language now we've got
19:32
klingon we've got we i mean as dumb as
19:34
that sounds that is a language that's
19:35
not how that's not how papua new guinea
19:37
got its 800 languages by authors of
19:40
fantasy novels making up novels which
19:42
people could quote to each other at
19:43
sci-fi conventions papi nick in it is
19:45
just one massive sci-fi convention
19:49
that's all that's made it through yeah
19:51
like in klingon they teach klingon they
19:53
cling on schools now like it's
19:55
it's a language though but it's a
19:56
language i know it's a language but it's
19:58
not a language that has developed over
19:59
thousands of years klingon is not a
20:01
replacement for the hundreds of
20:02
beautiful strangers because we're not
20:03
going to go over to papua new guinea and
20:05
go sorry to hear that you're losing your
20:06
languages we've got a new one for you
20:08
we've got dothraki for you yeah
20:10
i'm not suggesting we replace them right
20:13
i'm just saying there are new languages
20:16
papua new guinea is famously the place
20:18
with the most languages i think
20:20
one in 10 of the earth's languages have
20:22
spoken there or something yeah they've
20:23
got at least 800 and if you say there
20:25
were six thousand things yeah but
20:26
apparently there are a few more in new
20:29
york city or at least it's very close
20:31
the number in papua new guinea compared
20:33
to the number in new york city but the
20:34
papua new guinea ones are native
20:35
personally and new yorkers
20:37
sort of everywhere yeah yeah that's cool
20:39
wow that's very cool i had to look for
20:41
things that haven't been read at the
20:42
time and i found out that so the world
20:44
bank released a lot of their release all
20:45
their reports as pdfs
20:47
and they found out that nearly a third
20:48
of them are never read
20:50
never
20:51
never downloaded never read but the
20:53
reason i love this story is the report
20:55
that said no one reads them was released
20:56
as a pdf and because
20:59
and because the story sort of did quite
21:00
well and got a lot of coverage their
21:02
most read pdf could be the pdf saying
21:04
somebody reads their pdf that's very
21:06
good that's brilliant
21:07
that's great so the second author who's
21:09
going to be contributing to this project
21:11
is david mitchell the novelist and
21:14
i there's something about this idea of
21:16
submitting something that no one's going
21:17
to be able to give you feedback on if
21:19
you're an author and incredibly tempting
21:21
no reviews yeah yeah difficult sales for
21:23
the paperback edition
21:26
i'd still like the advance obviously
21:28
the audience is going to love it
21:30
well that's what kind of what happened
21:32
with uh mark twain's autobiography
21:34
wasn't it yeah did he kind of say that
21:36
no one was allowed to read it for a
21:37
hundred years or something yeah he did i
21:38
mean he put a he put it into that was
21:41
the deal it could be published a hundred
21:42
years after his death and that is what
21:44
happened it's the first two volumes have
21:46
come out they're ginormous and they uh
21:48
it was only about two years ago three
21:50
years ago they finally got published
21:51
there's currently one spike milligan
21:53
book that yet remains to be published
21:55
spike milligan can't find a publisher
21:57
right
22:00
it's basically um spike milligan did a
22:02
bunch of books called um according to
22:06
so black beauty according to spike
22:08
milligan treasure island he handled the
22:10
basquills he rewrote the classics yeah
22:12
mark twain's autobiography according to
22:15
yeah but um
22:17
this one book isn't out of copyright yet
22:19
and the copyright holders have refused
22:20
to let him do that so his agent norma
22:22
farns is just holding on to it and the
22:24
copyright is going to come up in about
22:26
10 years or so right then we'll get one
22:29
more spike milligan book yeah that's the
22:30
other thing about margaret atwood's
22:32
thing
22:33
doesn't copyright run out 70 years after
22:35
you die so she's not going to see any
22:36
royalties well she hasn't exactly like
22:39
her um her estate won't see anything
22:41
unless she lives for another 30 years
22:43
right and she's what 75 at the moment is
22:46
she yes she's in her 70s i guess she's
22:48
invented
22:50
a thing called the long pen have you
22:52
read about this yeah it's just a really
22:53
long pen it's ginormous
22:54
[Laughter]
22:56
no a long pen very different this is
22:58
this is kind of like a futuristic
23:00
invention it's the idea that you can
23:02
sign on a tablet but it can appear
23:04
it was basically designed for book tours
23:06
and so on if she couldn't physically be
23:08
in a place so they'll have like a robot
23:10
arm
23:11
um and you'll go and sit next to the
23:13
robot arm and then she'll do a skype
23:15
chat with you and you'll say my name's
23:17
you know herbert chavez or whatever i've
23:19
had dozens of operations to look like
23:21
you margaret
23:23
but no one's mobbing me
23:24
[Laughter]
23:25
and then she'll say okay um herbert i'll
23:28
sign your book for you and then she'll
23:30
sign it on a tablet and then the robot
23:31
arm will come down onto your book and
23:33
sign exactly as she signed it wow so
23:36
rather than just being like they have
23:37
they also ones where they just like do
23:39
like a present signature this is
23:40
actually her doing it in real time yeah
23:41
so so if she can't be in the room in
23:43
australia for a book signing she could
23:44
do a live skype chat and then you can go
23:46
to a desk where there's a robot arm and
23:48
you can watch her signing it on skype
23:50
and the robot's doing it i think we've
23:51
got to be very careful with that kind of
23:52
thing and i think the voice of the
23:55
author whoever it is should immediately
23:57
be converted into a metallic robot voice
23:59
thank you for coming to my signing
24:02
especially well for like dystopian novel
24:03
signings so you're like welcome to the
24:05
future
24:06
is your book yeah i would i did well
24:09
robotic margo atwood as you were saying
24:11
earlier there is a good story in that
24:13
um i had a look for authors whose books
24:15
haven't been um i've had delays or have
24:17
been lost um dr zoice and they when they
24:19
cleared out his attic i approve of that
24:21
pronunciation just so we're clear is
24:23
that dr seuss to the rest of us doctor
24:25
s-e-u-s-s yeah dr seuss but dr zoice is
24:28
probably the perfect pronunciation yeah
24:30
um they when he died his basically a box
24:33
of sort of things got put to one side
24:34
and then they found it in 2013 in uh
24:36
three books one of which is what pet
24:38
should i get which i think it's like a
24:40
fabulous book
24:41
[Laughter]
24:43
is it a dog is it a frog
24:45
i mean it's a shame the doctor has
24:46
already written this books otherwise we
24:48
should
24:48
christmas 2015 by the elves watch out
24:51
for it
24:52
[Music]
24:56
okay time for our final fact and that is
25:00
murray my fact is that japan is
25:02
considering installing toilets in its
25:04
lifts sounds like a plan to me yeah um
25:08
does it have very long lift journeys or
25:10
what well it doesn't but it does have
25:13
earthquakes lots of japan and when
25:15
earthquakes happen and let's get stuck
25:17
um there are already some little seats
25:19
in left so that uh elderly or infirm
25:21
people can sit down because the last
25:23
time it happened people were stuck for
25:24
you know hours in the lifts and there
25:27
has been a recent proposal and they
25:28
haven't completed it yet but they might
25:30
do which is to fit the seats with little
25:32
uh toilets just inside sort of
25:34
discreetly so that if they have an
25:36
enormous earthquake soon in japan
25:38
they've calculated that up to 17 000
25:40
people could be trapped in lifts for
25:42
some time while they just get everyone
25:43
out and clear the buildings and so on so
25:45
um that is that would be quite good
25:48
and then they could collect it all and
25:50
power a bus
25:53
absolutely that's true but so i was
25:55
reading uh the story that talks about
25:57
this and they kept referring to the
25:59
earthquakes as going
26:01
we're expecting the big one yeah they
26:04
really think it's imminently coming this
26:06
big ginormous earthquake but it's
26:08
definitely better to be thinking that
26:10
than thinking it'll be fine there'll be
26:12
no earthquakes around here any time yeah
26:14
their lifts actually already have
26:15
sensors in them that can detect the
26:16
beginnings of earthquakes so the lifts
26:18
detect earthquakes coming they sort of
26:19
try and stop at the floor and get people
26:20
out they won't carry on that's clever
26:22
that is so amazing safety mechanisms
26:25
imagine if there's like just about to
26:27
start an earthquake and then it stops on
26:30
the floor to let you out but you're
26:31
halfway through having to poop
26:34
you're not meant to use it unless
26:35
there's an earthquake oh all right
26:39
people will start using it for that
26:41
reason though right
26:42
surely
26:43
you should prove responsibly imagine if
26:45
you're about to get into a lift if
26:47
someone walks out and goes i'll give it
26:48
a few minutes
26:55
oh my gosh um
26:57
so the really uh
26:58
cool thing about lifts is they go back
27:01
really fast so the coliseum had lifts as
27:03
i'm not sure if we've mentioned that
27:04
before actually but they were hand
27:05
powered yeah and they were to get the
27:07
animals up into the arena right yeah
27:10
um
27:11
but um
27:12
the invention of the lift or the lift
27:14
becoming popular completely changed what
27:16
people think of as the best room in a
27:18
building so the best rooms in the
27:19
building used to be on the first floor
27:21
right uh because if you were wealthy you
27:23
didn't want to have to climb loads of
27:24
stairs and then suddenly the lift is
27:26
invented and people think oh it's high
27:28
up here and there's the sort of extra
27:30
privilege of traveling in a lift you
27:31
know
27:32
you've got a view and it's sort of it's
27:34
more naturally exclusive but in ancient
27:36
roman apartment blocks the top floor was
27:38
the port for the poorest if you go to
27:40
the big buildings in america like the
27:42
the richest people would always be on
27:44
the top floor but then after 9 11 they
27:46
all moved down to the bottom floors did
27:47
they yeah wow i believe that's true will
27:50
that change again over time i i was only
27:52
told by people at the time that that was
27:54
happening i don't know okay
27:56
the first generation of skyscrapers were
27:58
known as elevator buildings were they
28:00
really
28:06
the first lift in london was at the
28:07
grove in our hotel and it was called the
28:08
ascending room
28:10
that's good
28:12
it sounds amazing yeah it sounds really
28:14
cool
28:15
um ancient leicester often so you know
28:16
ropes and simple mechanisms and i read
28:18
that um in the greek meteora mountains
28:21
there were people in baskets and hooked
28:22
them up on ropes and the story that a
28:24
minister asked them how often they
28:25
changed the rope and the reply was each
28:27
time that it breaks
28:32
fill you with confidence
28:35
um have you heard of paternoster lifts
28:37
yeah they have one in the um arts tower
28:39
in sheffield university really yeah it's
28:41
basically two lift shafts open to you
28:44
without a door
28:45
and then there's a chain of compartments
28:48
which one is always going up and one is
28:49
always going down right and um they move
28:52
on a continuous belt and you just step
28:55
in as a compartment passes you by and it
28:57
carries wow i know and there are still
28:59
apparently loads of them in prague
29:01
because they didn't have quite the same
29:03
safety standards basically during
29:04
communist times as they said no we don't
29:06
need your safety same in sheffield
29:10
yeah and there are some in germany and
29:11
they're called paternosters after our
29:13
father which is the lord's prayer right
29:15
because of the way you move rosary beads
29:17
oh yeah how cool is that they sort of
29:19
click through up and down yeah i didn't
29:21
know that that's very cool uh
29:23
my favorite thing actually about this
29:24
fact is that it does kind of fit into
29:26
that thing of japan just consistently
29:28
when you hear stories of japan and
29:29
technology just feels like they're
29:31
really cool and they've got just great
29:32
innovations and stuff yeah and bathroom
29:34
stuff seems to be like there's an
29:36
invention which is toilet slippers the
29:38
idea that you would change your house
29:40
slippers into toilet slippers and you
29:41
could go in and then you'd leave them at
29:43
the toilet so it's just a quite nice
29:45
idea but just a little inside fact for
29:47
our show
29:48
if you listen to our theme tune right at
29:50
the beginning of our show there's a
29:52
japanese voice at the top of our theme
29:53
tune
29:54
that is the voice of a bathtub in japan
29:58
telling the person in the flat that
30:01
their bathtub is ready that their bath
30:02
is right and it's ready
30:04
so ashgardner who who's been on the show
30:07
and does emperor yes
30:09
that's he took that recording sitting in
30:10
his kitchen of his bath telling him it's
30:12
ready for him to come that's so cool
30:13
yeah that's very cool and i also read
30:15
the in japanese public toilets like in
30:17
train stations and stuff i have these
30:18
really cool things that they'll have
30:19
like a seat so you've got a baby you can
30:21
put your baby in a seat so you want to
30:22
sort of balance your child and go to the
30:23
toilet they have like a sort of flip
30:25
down board you can stand on you want to
30:26
change your socks or your shoes you have
30:27
to stand on the floor everyone stands on
30:28
their feet that's a good idea i've just
30:30
have to really smart ideas japan is so
30:32
clever in so many ways it's so good
30:34
they'll be horrified when they come over
30:35
here and like go to like waterloo
30:36
station i know it's yeah yeah and the
30:38
thing about removing your shoes is
30:40
enormous isn't it in your own home you
30:41
would just never wear shoes there's a
30:43
tiny bit in the entrance hallway where
30:45
you come in take your shoes off and you
30:47
put on your slippers and then you're in
30:48
your home that makes sense yeah it does
30:50
it absolutely does do the fuji tech um
30:52
this is japanese company claimed to make
30:53
the world's smoothest lift and they have
30:55
a thing called the nickel test where
30:56
they put a nickel or a coin place it so
30:58
it's facing up on uh the lift and then
31:00
they ride it from the top to the bottom
31:02
if the coin is still there it passes the
31:03
test wait do you mean on his edge
31:08
that reminds me i'm just going back to
31:09
buses from all that time ago um in china
31:12
they had this drive safely campaign of
31:14
bus drivers and the way that they did it
31:16
is they'd
31:17
put like hang from the ceiling next to
31:19
the driver like a wok full of water
31:23
and the idea was you couldn't jerk the
31:24
bus because then you'd spill the water
31:26
and that really happened that's very
31:28
good quite recently i think that
31:29
happened that's quite smart yeah that's
31:30
very clever the first department store
31:32
in new york city um to have a lift uh it
31:36
promised customers it would take them to
31:38
the second floor in 26 seconds okay
31:41
um today the lift in the burgeo khalifa
31:44
goes
31:45
2038 feet in 35 seconds
31:49
that's how far we've come in that time
31:51
you know in 1989 a guy called nicholas
31:53
white got trapped in his office for 41
31:55
hours after there's a power cut and he
31:57
got stuck between two floors and no one
31:58
noticed him so he ends up having to pee
32:01
down the lift shaft which he hoped would
32:02
attract attention but it didn't
32:04
i don't know what i don't know where he
32:06
was looking for attention from because
32:08
no one lives at the bottom of the left
32:09
shaft it won't be inconvenienced by
32:11
urine his story is really sad though
32:13
because it ruined his life what he wrote
32:15
an article about it um saying because
32:17
this happened in 1999 and he sought
32:20
compensation basically lots of lawyers
32:22
came waggling you know million figure
32:24
sums in front of him he spent about five
32:25
years trying to get compensation and in
32:27
the end he got sort of you know some
32:29
compensation but nothing like the
32:30
millions that he'd been led to only 41
32:32
hours of overtime yeah well and but then
32:35
his relationship broke down and he said
32:37
this has basically ruined my life and i
32:39
did this to myself i i shouldn't have
32:41
gone looking for that and i sort of gave
32:44
in to the temptation
32:45
oh yeah really really sad do you know
32:47
the person who's got the world record
32:49
for the longest time stuck in the lift
32:51
was it nicholas white no it was a
32:53
cypriot lady called kivali papa john
32:58
papa john of the papa john family
33:02
was she delivery
33:03
[Laughter]
33:04
no she was going to get her groceries
33:07
was she going to get tomatoes mozzarella
33:11
sweet corn pepperoni maybe some
33:13
pineapple and ham if she was feeling fun
33:16
[Laughter]
33:18
well it's a full name in and of itself
33:20
which is why it's not really a surname
33:21
as far as i know um but yeah she went
33:24
out to get her groceries in december
33:25
1987. um
33:32
but people keep laughing at her about
33:33
her surname it's not fair
33:35
i think it's a hoax call so so what
33:38
happened um she was stuck in her lift in
33:41
her apartment block for six days wow but
33:44
luckily she'd just been shopping so she
33:46
had loads of food yeah
33:47
perfect but when you say she holds the
33:49
world record
33:50
was that like she was five days in and
33:52
there we go listen mrs papa john's
33:55
we've got guinness coming
33:57
hold on for a bit longer we reckon we
33:58
could get a really good record out of
34:00
this is she holding the doors shut when
34:01
they're trying to come on i need one
34:03
more hour in here and i get the record
34:06

00:12
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:15
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:17
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:19
covent garden my name is dan schreiber
00:21
i'm sitting here with andy murray james
00:23
harkin and anna chazinski and once again
00:25
we have gathered around the microphones
00:27
with our four favorite facts from the
00:28
last seven days and in no particular
00:30
order here we go
00:33
starting with fact number one and that's
00:35
my fact my fact this week is that
00:37
guantanamo bay has a gift shop pretty
00:40
inappropriate yeah can do we know if the
00:42
prisoners can buy gifts is it like they
00:45
get let out once a week and they sell
00:46
files and they sell
00:49
wire cutters and things like that now
00:50
i've got a list of some of the things i
00:52
do sell so fidel castro's standing on a
00:54
boom box uh with tax reading rocking in
00:56
fidel's backyard uh you can get golf
00:59
balls you can get candles you can get a
01:01
plush banana rat which is a type of rat
01:04
that they have on guantanamo bay so
01:05
there's banana wraps everywhere on
01:07
guantanamo bay either and otherwise
01:09
known as hutia you would normally call
01:11
them hootie but they call them banana
01:13
rats but you know why they're called
01:14
banana rats no they're shaped like a
01:16
banana
01:18
they eat bananas no they're radioactive
01:20
they're very easy to peel they emit what
01:22
is it yeah
01:24
no they don't really have legs
01:30
no the reason is um that they are called
01:32
banana rats because their feces look
01:34
like small versions of the fruit
01:38
wow that's cool it's very interesting
01:41
named after the shape of my poo
01:45
i'm not up for that well you'd just be
01:46
called poo wouldn't you
01:49
no you could be like raisins or
01:52
skyscrapers
01:57
it could be anything couldn't it um so
01:59
uh oh well that's a cool fact i really
02:01
like that um
02:02
they're uh they also they have uh teddy
02:04
bears uh that you have cropped t-shirts
02:07
and they read it don't get mo better
02:09
than this gitmo being the abbreviation
02:12
yeah it's pretty crazy they got things
02:13
like baskin robbins there the ice cream
02:15
shop they got mcdonald's there's a
02:16
subway kfc pizza hut yeah i just i
02:19
really like when you hear about military
02:21
compounds or places when you hear
02:23
something out of place andy has a great
02:24
fact about the cia it's the starbucks oh
02:27
yeah yeah that is that um the starbucks
02:30
in langley virginia the headquarters of
02:33
the cia
02:34
the baristas are not allowed to write
02:36
customers names on the cups imagine if
02:37
you went to starbucks and they said what
02:39
name is it and you said skyscraper
02:43
that's unusual name where do you get
02:44
that
02:45
um
02:46
so guantanamo bay is on um cuba
02:49
obviously it is but um
02:52
it's rented from the cuban government
02:55
okay except that uh fidel castro says
02:58
that
02:58
uh he never cashes the cheques he says
03:00
he's cashed one of them once and it was
03:02
by mistake as four thousand dollars a
03:05
month do you reckon he's holding them
03:07
all up and then one day he's going to
03:09
cash them all and hopefully bankrupt him
03:11
[Laughter]
03:12
he has isn't there a rumor that he
03:14
stores them all in a draw in his office
03:16
desk yes he showed them off in a tv
03:18
interview once yeah and he says that the
03:21
only one that got cashed was in 1959
03:23
during the actual cuban revolution when
03:24
it was a bit confusing and you know
03:27
um a mistake in the payroll department
03:29
or something like that why was he doing
03:30
the banking why is fidel
03:33
i got really confused on my bank run
03:35
that time
03:37
but he also he also claims that the
03:38
checks are made out to the treasurer
03:40
general of the republic which is
03:41
apparently a position that ceased to
03:42
exist after the revolution in 1959. so
03:45
this is a pre-revolutionary arrangement
03:47
that clearly they haven't updated them
03:49
on um guantanamo also has an irish bar
03:52
does it yeah it has an irish bar called
03:54
o'kelly's irish bar
03:56
which claims to be the only irish bar on
03:58
communist soil and so i thought i'd see
04:00
if i could find any other irish bars on
04:02
communist soil and there is um huli's
04:04
irish bar in guangzhou china gary's
04:07
irish pub in vientiane in lao
04:11
and bernie's irish bar and restaurant in
04:13
saigon oh well done so it's lying
04:16
they're lying yeah a lie coming out of
04:17
guantanamo
04:19
i would have thought it imagine if
04:21
that's what takes them down
04:24
um
04:24
you know there's a version of guantanamo
04:26
bay on second life
04:28
really yeah yeah a couple of activists
04:29
built it to show people what it is like
04:31
there basically so it's because
04:32
obviously you're not normally allowed to
04:34
go there you it's forbidden for people
04:36
who are not in the military or you know
04:37
with very few exceptions so
04:40
they have they have constructed one
04:41
people can volunteer to experience
04:43
virtual prison there see what it's like
04:45
wow yeah is that do you see what it's
04:47
like do you think no obviously it's
04:49
there's only so much you can really
04:50
experience from your home but it's it
04:52
shows you sort of the layout and it
04:53
shows you what exactly kind of what
04:55
happens yeah um can i tell you one more
04:56
thing about second life yeah yeah
04:58
there's an actual prison on second life
05:00
for people who uh you know hacking into
05:02
the the world itself or sort of into the
05:04
game or being other you know digitally
05:06
naughty basically um and supposedly it
05:08
consists of just a moonlit field full of
05:11
corn which goes on forever and the only
05:13
things you can do in it you could
05:14
there's a tractor that you can ride
05:16
slowly or there's a black and white tv
05:18
playing a film from 1940 as the only
05:20
things you can do in second life prison
05:22
wow how cool is that that sounds great
05:25
jimmy carr um so for any overseas
05:28
listeners a big comedian in britain he
05:30
did a gig in second life wow yeah and it
05:32
was a live gig and during it he's just
05:34
standing there as a second life jimmy
05:36
carr yeah and you know when you play
05:38
those games like golden eye and you end
05:41
up just running into the wall and
05:42
bashing against the wall a lot of his
05:43
audience members don't quite know how to
05:45
stay still
05:46
so while he's telling jokes they're just
05:48
walking past him smashing into walls
05:51
flipping over in front of it that's very
05:53
funny um i was looking into because i
05:55
was just thinking of famous gift shops i
05:57
know of and um one that i went to not
05:59
too long ago and i think you can qualify
06:01
it as a gift shop it's the sherlock
06:03
holmes shop and it's in uh in baker
06:05
street and i didn't realize that it's
06:07
not at 221 b baker street when conan
06:09
doyle wrote the sherlock stories that
06:11
didn't exist that the road didn't go
06:13
that far up right and so they've since
06:15
built this bigger road
06:18
it was abby national so abby national
06:20
was situated at 221b baker street um and
06:22
as a result they hired someone to answer
06:25
all mail to sherlock holmes however they
06:28
just wrote back offering them very good
06:34
i'm afraid i can't help you find your
06:35
wife but i can't help you find a great
06:37
deal on your insurance
06:40
but so what ended up happening was uh in
06:42
1990 a blue plaque went up outside the
06:45
museum saying that that was now 221b and
06:48
so mail started going there and that
06:49
started a 15-year dispute between abbey
06:51
national and the sherlock holmes museum
06:53
about who was 221b
06:55
and now abbey national was closed and
06:57
now 221b technically is the museum
06:59
despite the fact it's at 9.
07:02
yeah so are we 2 2 1 b or not 2 2 1 b
07:09
have you heard the thing about the
07:10
souvenir coins they've just done for
07:11
waterloo no it is so cool um so
07:14
belgium wanted to do these special
07:16
commemorative coins for the battle of
07:17
waterloo right with this the st there's
07:19
a famous statue of a lion yeah and they
07:22
wanted to have that on it
07:24
and they made 180 000 of these but
07:26
france forced them to stop because
07:28
basically other eu countries get a veto
07:30
over it and france is a bit sensitive
07:31
about waterloo so the french said it
07:34
will create a bad reaction in france and
07:35
you shouldn't do this but the belgians
07:38
found a rule a tiny tiny rule in the
07:39
book saying that any country can issue
07:41
its own coins if they're in a regular
07:43
denomination
07:45
and so they have just made 70 000 2.5
07:48
euro coins
07:51
with the design they wanted oh cool yeah
07:53
and you can spend them across belgium
07:55
can you actually yeah they have monetary
07:57
value that's so cool so when the duke of
07:59
wellington died um all of his locks of
08:02
hair were cut off to make souvenirs for
08:04
people including the queen and you know
08:06
like loads and loads of people
08:09
because people did used to just take
08:11
weird souvenirs from all sorts of things
08:13
didn't they it wasn't like in the olden
08:15
days you wouldn't have gift shops people
08:16
just go and nick stuff
08:18
basically but mark twain wrote that when
08:20
he went to egypt all he could hear was
08:22
the tinkling sound of tack hammers as
08:24
people chipped away at the monuments wow
08:27
so you just go to the
08:28
pyramids and people just be taking bits
08:30
off all the time that's all you could
08:31
hear really yeah do you know what would
08:34
be amazing is if the pyramids were
08:35
actually square
08:40
this is just what's left yeah exactly
08:42
it's amazing i bet that's true is it
08:44
true that they were covered in marble
08:46
that is true yeah wow that's astonishing
08:48
i did seeing them back then yeah so what
08:49
we see now that used to have a marble
08:51
casing around it yeah they used to be
08:52
really shiny so it was like being
08:54
pebble-dashed
08:57
but more classy
09:00
i have a thing about souvenirs that are
09:01
being taken that shouldn't be taken oh
09:03
yeah so lots of people when they go to
09:05
uluru formerly airs rock in australia
09:08
will chip off a bit to take home as with
09:10
stonehenge or as with other places
09:11
whereas with the pyramids but there's an
09:13
increasing trend of people posting them
09:15
back because they feel really apologetic
09:16
oh they suffer bad luck in their life
09:18
and they think well it must be because i
09:20
took that rock from uluru and so they
09:21
post it back and they get about one
09:23
every day um but the thing is they
09:25
return to the national park but they
09:27
before they get back to the national
09:28
park they are quarantined
09:30
somewhere in australia there is a rock
09:32
quarantine in case they've caught a
09:34
disease while they've been abroad
09:36
basically in case they have as they say
09:37
on the website they say the threat of
09:39
micro pathogens being introduced by
09:40
contaminated rocks from elsewhere
09:42
bacteria can um affect rocks certainly
09:45
yeah definitely yeah you can change the
09:47
chemical composition of rocks definitely
09:49
okay but what what are the
09:50
like what's the fallout if you
09:52
introduced a rock to australia i don't
09:55
know maybe there's a a spore or
09:57
something which could wipe out a native
09:59
plant wow exactly right i mean they're
10:00
just being ultra careful but i just
10:02
think that's the funniest thing i mean
10:03
it's a barren desert where uluru is
10:05
always safe because they don't like um
10:07
non-native species coming in do they say
10:09
what if there's like a fox on the
10:10
underside of the crowd no one's seen
10:12
that's true
10:16
gotta be careful with these kind of
10:17
things i'm just imagining they put the
10:19
rock back on uluru and then um go home
10:22
and then the next day they come it's
10:23
disappeared
10:25
there's just a note saying suckers
10:28
yours mr fox
10:34
time for fact number two and that is
10:36
chesinski
10:38
oh yeah my fact is that the natural
10:39
history museum is turning moss gay to
10:42
stop them destroying the exhibits
10:46
yeah what um well they've got a moth
10:49
problem um they are destroying exhibits
10:51
in the natural history museum so they in
10:53
the natural history museum a lot of like
10:54
things that have fur or feathers or
10:56
things like that on it i think most are
10:57
using it so it's not a lot of these
10:58
things they can't eat but they
11:00
like destroy it and then make little
11:02
nests out of it and yeah so it's a
11:04
problem it's destroying the exhibits and
11:06
so they are using female hormones
11:09
they're covering male moths and female
11:11
hormones to try and make other male mods
11:13
attracted to them so that they waste all
11:14
their shagging time trying to shag
11:16
another male and
11:18
they fail
11:19
you've only got a certain amount of
11:20
shagging time with you
11:22
sorry i've just spent an hour and a half
11:24
on that other male so
11:27
i am i was reading about uh because it's
11:30
not just a natural history museum that's
11:31
had this problem lots of other museums
11:33
have this problem and it turns out that
11:35
there's one man who they call in
11:38
to sort out all of their issues and he's
11:40
known as bug man
11:42
and his name is david pinnager and i
11:44
don't know if he's being brought in for
11:46
the natural history museum in this case
11:48
but he is the man who you bring in when
11:49
there's a moth problem when there's any
11:51
kind of insect problem and he's been
11:53
giving talks for years the vna he gave a
11:56
talk a few years ago which was called
11:57
bug uh which stood for beating unwanted
12:01
guests so this is this goes back as far
12:03
as it sounds like a talk for the
12:04
security guards in the museum
12:08
that was a talk given in 1993 at the vna
12:10
so this has been a problem since 1993
12:12
and they've been trying to combat it in
12:14
so many different ways there are lots of
12:16
um fruit fruit growing places um
12:19
possibly orchards actually now i think
12:20
about it
12:21
which have had the same problem with
12:22
moss and they've used the same solution
12:24
they've also tried uh telling them games
12:25
have they all sort of because it's not
12:27
quite telling them gay is it they're
12:28
still straight but it's yeah disguising
12:30
materials females they at the pit rivers
12:32
museum they did a thing where they had a
12:34
glue board um and they put the
12:36
pheromones of an equivalent a thousand
12:39
female moths onto this glue board so all
12:42
these moths were just going whoa
12:45
ladies and then they were flying that
12:47
way and he's getting stuck to a thousand
12:48
ladies because it kind of looks a bit
12:50
like a glue bottle you smell them oh my
12:53
god
12:55
it's so it's such a it's really funny as
12:58
an idea yeah it is i can't believe it
12:59
dover castle as well sorry oh yeah dover
13:02
castle as well had a thing uh which was
13:04
they realized that all these insects all
13:06
these malts were being attracted to
13:07
certain um uh wall hangings because the
13:11
dye that was used in the paintings were
13:12
mainly crushed insects and weirdly that
13:15
was an attraction to them
13:17
yeah they smelt dead insect basically
13:20
and so they were attracted to that so
13:21
they had an issue with that at dover
13:22
castle apparently 85 of male insects
13:24
engage in homosexual acts but mostly
13:26
it's accidental um they just mate in the
13:29
hope that they're mating with a female
13:31
but it doesn't really matter no and
13:33
there are loads of theories as to why um
13:35
so some people think that it's to
13:37
practice mating or some people think
13:39
it's to dominate other males um but
13:41
flower beetles uh they found that they
13:43
do this a lot and they found that it
13:45
doesn't improve their success rate with
13:47
females but if a male leaks semen on
13:50
another male and then that other male
13:52
later breeds with a female the females
13:54
eggs can be fertilized by the sperm of
13:56
the male that she never encountered and
13:58
it's called sex by proxy isn't it yeah
14:00
exactly and it's the article about it so
14:02
that males can inseminate females quotes
14:04
without expending time or energy having
14:06
sex with them
14:07
result
14:09
but it does imply that the males just
14:11
really want to have sex with the other
14:13
males and so they'd
14:14
rather i were them i thought they're
14:16
spending time and energy mating with a
14:17
male yeah surely you might as well just
14:19
do it directly
14:22
it seems a bit of a roundabout way of
14:23
doing it
14:24
do you guys know the only other animal
14:26
where a percentage chooses exclusively
14:28
to have homosexual sex even though there
14:30
are members of the opposite sex
14:32
available to them um and that's domestic
14:34
sheep oh and i think it is eight percent
14:38
of male domestic sheep how will choose
14:41
to have sex with another male sheep
14:42
rather than a female which is weird
14:44
isn't it what is weird about um sheep is
14:47
that if you're a female sheep and you're
14:49
you're gonna have sex what you do is
14:51
basically stand perfectly still and then
14:53
the ram comes and and mounts you but if
14:56
you have two lesbian sheep and they both
14:58
want to have sex with each other they
15:00
naturally will just stand perfectly
15:01
still so they're just kind of stood
15:03
there kind of looking at each other
15:04
going well are you going to do something
15:06
or am i that makes it very difficult to
15:08
spot lesbian sheep just she's just not
15:10
making the first move i don't know what
15:11
i'm doing wrong
15:12
do they have to get a friend in the end
15:14
to just lift them up and force them
15:16
together like
15:17
oh guys enough of this [ __ ] fitting
15:19
around
15:21
i was reading about uh moths obviously
15:24
they prayed on by bats that's a that's a
15:26
thing you have to watch out for if you
15:27
come off they've learned to create a
15:29
sound
15:30
which says that they're a different much
15:32
more disgusting tasting moth really yeah
15:34
so they pretend to be the disgusting
15:36
tasting moth that they know bats don't
15:38
go for and then the bats don't go for
15:40
them as a result so they mimic the sound
15:43
and as a result uh yeah it would be
15:44
safer to mimic the sound of like a lion
15:46
or something wouldn't it just because if
15:48
you do get a really hungry bat but then
15:50
taking that bit further that means every
15:52
animal in the whole world should sound
15:54
like a lion yes
15:55
why don't they okay but apart from a
15:57
lion which should disguise itself as you
15:59
know an inoffensive clump of grass
16:02
or a bit of
16:04
rock
16:05
um here's here's the thing though
16:07
you've hit on something which is that uh
16:09
there is an actual moth called the asian
16:12
corn borer who mimics the sound of a bat
16:15
to freak out females
16:17
and when they hear it they freeze in
16:19
fear and because the asian corn borer is
16:21
terrible at sex it uses this sound to
16:24
freeze the female so that he can use the
16:25
opportunity to mate with her hmm it's
16:28
for a hypno in the in the it's the hypno
16:30
of the world yeah yeah wow
16:32
so here's the thing um you know the word
16:35
gadarobe
16:36
it's like an old french word for a
16:39
toilet okay
16:41
that's where the word wardrobe comes
16:42
from
16:44
and one theory as to why that
16:46
why that change happened is because you
16:48
would keep your clothes in a toilet and
16:51
because the smell was so bad it would
16:52
keep moths away
16:54
really also
16:55
all your clothes would smell like a
16:57
toilet
16:59
really i mean i think it's the theory
17:01
i'm not sure it's true you know how
17:02
james you insist on ordering a panino
17:04
when you go into a cafe rather than
17:06
panini i do indeed right in the same
17:08
vein do you also use the guardaro
17:10
wardrobe thing to excuse the fact that
17:11
you piss in the wardrobe all the time
17:16
i like etymologically speaking it's fine
17:20
nothing wrong
17:25
okay time for fact number three and that
17:27
is james
17:29
okay my fact this week is that the word
17:31
marvelous
17:32
has fallen in use from 155 times per
17:35
million 20 years ago to only two times
17:38
per million today
17:40
so every 500 000 words you say one of
17:43
them will be marvelous
17:45
wow anyone says society isn't in decline
17:48
then i think we've disproved them here
17:50
um yeah so um just about language
17:53
changing and stuff and it's a bit of a
17:55
shame i think the word marvelous is
17:56
quite a good word and i think it's a
17:57
shame we're not using it anymore yeah
17:59
yeah
18:00
with that kind of um disappearance that
18:03
it's like achieving right now are we
18:05
going to lose it uh i don't think we'll
18:06
lose it but it's just become
18:07
old-fashioned really but it i think
18:09
there is hope for marvellous because
18:11
words go go up and down don't they so
18:13
the use of the word marvelous had its p
18:15
so it had its peak in 1886 and it's been
18:18
declining pretty steadily since then i
18:20
think except 1918 to 1925 was looking at
18:23
a graph had a big peak suddenly
18:29
things are a bit more marvelous than
18:31
they were and then suddenly oh this
18:33
hitler guy is looking a little bit uh a
18:34
little bit rowdy for my liking he's not
18:36
looking very marvelous is he
18:39
yeah so marvelous used to be a lot
18:40
stronger it used to mean something that
18:42
caused wonder
18:43
so it was a lot stronger than marvel i
18:45
mean yes yeah exactly yeah yeah yeah
18:48
yeah don't steal the meaning of the word
18:49
wonderful and attribute it to another
18:52
civil war between the words wonderful
18:54
used to mean marvelous actually causing
18:56
marvel yeah
18:58
so this all comes from um a thing called
19:00
the spoken british national corpus of
19:03
2014 and that's done by cambridge
19:06
university press and lancaster
19:07
university and they take a whole load of
19:09
um kind of conversations and all that
19:11
kind of thing and they work out how
19:13
often words are are used and then
19:15
there's a load of press releases um one
19:17
of which i saw this week
19:19
i'm really suspicious about this um
19:20
project that they're on because they've
19:23
uh they're asking for people to donate
19:26
recorded tapes of their conversations
19:27
every day and stuff so they said we're
19:28
calling for people to send us mp3 files
19:30
of their everyday informal conversations
19:32
in exchange for a small payment and i is
19:34
this just mi5 kind of being more obvious
19:37
can you record yourself talking about
19:38
threats to britain's national security
19:40
because a lot of that vocabulary is very
19:42
specialized and we really need it
19:46
send it in we'll give you a fiver and a
19:48
short stint in guantanamo bay there's a
19:49
lovely gift shop
19:51
so the the other uh conclusions that
19:53
they came to are the words that they
19:54
said were going in and out of fashion
19:55
they said that the word cheerio
19:57
uh has yet to appear in conversations
19:59
from this decade which is a bit sad i
20:01
said that old people still use it but
20:03
not young ones
20:04
um so i was looking you know google does
20:07
has this amazing tool which i've just
20:09
wasted so many hours of my life on where
20:10
uh i can't even remember what the url is
20:12
but look up um google word tracker and
20:15
it tracks the use of words over the last
20:17
200 years in all google books um and
20:19
when when they've you know how often
20:21
words are mentioned so
20:23
so the word loser reached its peak in
20:25
1807. whatever made you think of looking
20:28
that way
20:29
you knew you're gonna be hanging out
20:30
with us
20:34
a couple of other good good spikes so
20:36
the word happy has been in constant
20:38
decline since the year 1800 until the
20:40
year 2000 and then it's been increasing
20:42
since then and then the pharrell song
20:44
came out
20:45
ah that might have spiked it right up
20:47
and happy feet the movie i reckon it
20:49
must bring words back just by popular
20:52
movies and songs must be right um penis
20:55
has been in steep decline since 1996.
20:57
tell me about it
21:03
[Laughter]
21:08
is it just that people are using other
21:09
words i assume so it's probably that
21:11
yeah maybe we've diversified and i you
21:13
know in our synonyms although actually
21:15
we probably haven't because we've always
21:16
used countless synonyms for that yeah
21:18
true um vagina had a huge spike in 1880
21:22
but in when it went 1880 there was so
21:25
literally that one year it was used four
21:27
times as much as sort of before or since
21:29
in the headlines
21:34
oh mr johnson wears my vagina i think it
21:36
was cold pretty much the pharrell's
21:38
happy of its time
21:41
does it say does it say why it's spicy
21:42
it does it can't say why it's literally
21:44
just a stat site that tracks users in
21:46
google books okay so i have no idea why
21:47
but you know if anyone's got any
21:49
theories in google books yeah that's
21:50
interesting okay um the atlantic beach
21:53
theater and comedy club a couple of
21:55
years ago and was putting on the vagina
21:57
monologues
21:58
but got complaints about using the word
22:00
vagina and so renamed it the hoo-ha
22:03
monologues
22:09
is there one word that you guys use that
22:11
is not just used in day-to-day language
22:14
that you wish would come back but you do
22:16
actually use
22:17
andy most of the words andy uses i think
22:21
well i there is a word which is i do
22:23
really like and it's you know
22:25
megalomania is sort of it being it's
22:27
insanely thinking you're all powerful
22:28
and you're not getting it there is a
22:30
corresponding word called micromania
22:32
which is a tendency to constantly
22:34
belittle oneself
22:36
isn't that an incredible word yeah
22:38
because it's a very common thing a lot
22:40
of people you know especially sort of
22:41
supposedly english people are very very
22:43
self-deprecating there is a word for it
22:45
micromania i really like that um there
22:47
are really i've got some good words if
22:48
you like
22:50
from the m section of the dictionary
22:52
actually one related to moths so macro
22:54
lepidoptera and this is in the oed uh
22:56
they are defined as the butterflies and
22:58
moths which are large enough to be of
22:59
interest to collectors
23:01
and there's also micro lepidoptera which
23:04
is the numerous moths which are mostly
23:06
smaller than those of interest to
23:07
collectors i didn't know the collectors
23:09
were so sizes
23:11
yeah you would have thought that the
23:12
small ones might be more precious yeah
23:15
they're all an 18th of an inch long
23:16
though it's a bit tiresome having to
23:18
collect them and you lose them in your
23:19
pocket yeah
23:21
you could lie about your collection look
23:22
at my incredibles
23:24
i know you can't see them but
23:25
[Laughter]
23:28
the the mile high club in the oed is
23:30
defined as an imaginary association of
23:33
people who have had sexual intercourse
23:35
on an aircraft
23:38
that's great that is really good
23:41
that's written by someone who's tried
23:43
and failed
23:44
[Laughter]
23:46
i've only got one more word that i
23:48
really like yes uh babel levant and it
23:51
means one who makes feeble jokes
23:55
yeah that's good why'd you bring that up
23:57
yeah just thought you knew you would be
23:58
talking to us
24:01
[Music]
24:05
okay time for our final fact and that is
24:08
andrew hunter murray my fact is that to
24:10
prepare for china's national day a
24:12
hundred thousand pigeons have anal
24:13
security checks to make sure they're not
24:15
carrying anything suspicious
24:17
[Laughter]
24:19
like rocks from australia
24:22
um
24:22
so china's national day is the first of
24:25
october and last year with a celebration
24:28
involved releasing 100 000 pigeons in
24:30
tiananmen square and they all fly up and
24:31
fly around it's very beautiful
24:33
and this is according to uh i think the
24:36
people's daily uh the sort of government
24:38
sponsored newspaper and a security
24:40
officer said that they all have to be
24:42
checked and under their wings and their
24:43
tail feathers and even their bottoms and
24:46
they are then loaded into sealed
24:48
vehicles and delivered to the square but
24:49
they're unchecked a second time
24:52
wow and then sealed in the cages before
24:54
the release and supposedly they were all
24:56
checked at the yuetan city sports center
24:59
in beijing and the whole process was
25:00
videotaped so someone has a tape of this
25:02
event wow
25:04
yeah a pigeon's a big worry are they
25:06
prone to treachery in china
25:09
no idea what we have covered on the
25:10
podcast before that they were used to
25:12
smuggle messages and wasn't it to steal
25:14
grain as well yes and to steal the use
25:16
of steel grain from the imperial granary
25:18
yeah you fly them in they eat the grain
25:20
you fly them out and then you squeeze
25:21
them and they have to throw up i think
25:22
you feed them like alum or something and
25:25
they throw it up
25:26
okay squeeze them
25:29
um
25:30
yeah
25:31
so this is this is something that
25:32
happens is this so how many pigeons are
25:34
they releasing on their national day a
25:35
hundred thousand
25:37
okay wow
25:39
i know that china is the military has
25:41
been training up pigeons it's been
25:42
training up ten thousand pigeons uh to
25:45
use as a reserve pigeon army so that
25:46
would
25:47
provide military communications in the
25:49
event of an attack and in the event of
25:51
an invasion apparently they want pigeons
25:53
to carry stuff back and forth they can
25:54
only carry 100 grams of stuff i think so
25:57
but if you put if you put a u something
25:58
on a usb you can communicate a lot of
26:00
stuff oh yeah
26:02
yeah
26:03
really good point um so yeah i wonder if
26:05
those positions they were releasing were
26:07
was that part of the training
26:09
yeah but the interesting thing is you
26:10
know when you release
26:12
pigeons and doves at weddings and things
26:13
like that they're homing pigeons
26:15
normally
26:16
so they fly around and when they're
26:18
fluttering around beautifully around the
26:20
venue or whatever they're actually just
26:21
getting their bearings i said where the
26:23
hell am i and then they shoot off in one
26:24
particular direction that is them
26:25
heading home that's a good like business
26:28
model isn't it it's a really good
26:29
business model because it's like they're
26:30
reusable yeah exactly yeah yeah
26:33
and you don't need to transport them
26:35
home no exactly yeah um someone who
26:38
released a hundred white pigeons very
26:40
recently turns out as a massive pigeon
26:42
lover mike tyson
26:44
oh yeah
26:45
no idea mike tyson loves pigeons he
26:48
actually says that the reason he became
26:49
a boxer was as a result of one of his
26:51
pigeons because his pigeon was killed by
26:54
a local uh bully
26:56
and the local bully really like mauled
26:58
one of his favorite pigeons and so he
27:00
got into a fight with him and that's
27:02
where he discovered he was a great
27:03
fighter imagine killing a pigeon and
27:05
finding out it belonged to mike tyson oh
27:07
my god
27:09
by the time he didn't know that he was
27:11
mike tyson mike tyson didn't even know
27:12
he was mike tyson imagine that discovery
27:14
he's only the one he discovers
27:17
pablo picasso as well he was a uh he was
27:20
a pigeon fancier what's he yeah and he
27:22
named yeah named his daughter paloma and
27:25
paloma is the spanish for pidgeon oh
27:27
really wow so named his daughter pidgeon
27:29
but he also named one of his pigeons
27:30
daughter and then it got very confusing
27:32
when his will was red
27:35
so
27:36
pigeons are so good at getting home and
27:38
we don't know how really but we do know
27:40
they have a mount they have a little bit
27:41
of magnetic iron ore in their beaks
27:44
and that helps them to sense the earth's
27:46
magnetic field and they also use their
27:49
eyesight for the final stages of a
27:50
journey and we know this because of a
27:51
guy called charlie wolcott who he has
27:54
spent 40 years attaching radio
27:57
transmitters to pigeons and then
27:58
following them in a single engine plane
28:00
to see them navigate and to see them go
28:03
you can imagine this terrified pigeon
28:04
saying he's still coming up
28:06
wow it sounds like that old cartoon with
28:09
dastardly and motley in it
28:12
and he puts frosted contact lenses on
28:14
pigeons
28:15
and then lets them fly home just to test
28:18
whether they use their eyesight and they
28:19
get most of the way towards home using
28:21
the magnetic field and other things that
28:22
we don't know about but then they
28:24
towards the end they got confused
28:25
because and that's how we know that they
28:27
need visual landmarks just for the end
28:29
like having an autopilot on for the main
28:31
flight and then for the landing yeah
28:33
basically but they're also using um some
28:35
pigeons have been found to be observing
28:37
the use of roads
28:39
and roundabouts
28:41
it's amazing yeah so cool so a pigeon
28:43
will be flying above a road it'll hit a
28:45
roundabout and if it was going to go
28:46
left it won't go left until it's gone
28:48
around the roundabout and then takes the
28:50
takes the appropriate how does it know
28:52
which way to go around the roundabout
28:53
because i struggle if i'm driving in
28:55
italy for instance
29:00
but what i mean is they must be
29:02
following the cars right yeah the cars
29:04
go wrong maybe maybe it's the heat of
29:05
the cars or something like that yeah
29:07
yeah um but the dove releases they date
29:10
back to the middle ages because they
29:11
used to have religious plays and um noah
29:14
would release a dove
29:15
from the ark
29:16
yeah and suppose i read this in a book
29:19
about medieval theater to stage the bit
29:21
where the dove comes back they'd either
29:22
use a dummy bird or they'd just attach a
29:24
string to the real bird just sort of put
29:26
it down oh my god
29:28
it's not going to look that natural is
29:29
it when you're pulling this flapping
29:31
frantically dove and it naturally
29:34
returns
29:36
and it's called the olive branch
29:37
sellotape to it
29:41
um pigeons are one of only three birds
29:44
aren't they that produce milk for their
29:46
offspring um wow so pigeons emperor
29:50
penguins i think and flamingos um and
29:51
they produce it in the uh is it the cro
29:54
it's called crop milk and the crop is
29:56
like this pouch in the back of their
29:57
throat i think where they a few days
29:59
before they give birth they start making
30:01
this milk and they sometimes stop eating
30:02
to make sure that there's not
30:03
indigestible grain stuck in the milk
30:05
that the the baby can't digest but i
30:07
really like the fact that they sort of
30:08
adjust the milk and turn it into baby
30:10
food as the scrub gets a little bit
30:12
older is it actual milk i don't think it
30:14
is i'm not sure if it even contains
30:16
lactose it might do but could you get
30:18
pigeon cheese is what i'm saying all
30:20
right i read that the milk in in
30:22
quotation marks uh from pigeons contains
30:25
more protein and fat than both human and
30:28
cows oh yeah it does so if we did get a
30:30
cheese unhealthy cheese maybe that's why
30:33
we haven't done it
30:34
it's just you can think of a whole range
30:35
of reasons why we haven't made cheese
30:37
from pigeons
30:40
i get a better feel about goat's cheese
30:42
never mind pigeon cheese
30:44
the
30:45
pope has had to because he often
30:47
releases doves he's had to replace them
30:48
now with balloons
30:50
because birds kept attacking the doves
30:53
yeah so in 2014 he did it and um a
30:57
seagull and a crow attacks the doves
30:59
very fiercely and his children letting
31:00
them go so it's immensely traumatizing
31:02
for the children as well um and then
31:04
also in 2013 this is when we have pope
31:07
benedict that release uh was also ruined
31:09
when a seagull attacked up and pinned it
31:11
against a window pane oh my god and then
31:14
the year before that he was releasing
31:15
two doves and one of them pushed beside
31:18
the pope and didn't move and then the
31:20
second dove immediately flew back into
31:21
his apartment and the article i was
31:23
reading about it just said to his credit
31:25
pope benedict seemed to shout mamma mia
31:27
in surprise
31:29
so this was pope benedict because pope
31:31
benedict was german right it's like he's
31:33
moved to the vatican and picked up the
31:35
lingo well you know what they say when
31:37
in rome
31:39
you know
31:40
all raf bomber planes used to carry a
31:42
pigeon as standard
31:44
how come they crashed in the sea they
31:46
would release a pigeon and they would
31:48
attach the coordinates of where they had
31:49
crashed into the sea and loads and loads
31:52
of pilots and and other you know uh crew
31:54
on the planes were saved well they
31:56
really yeah actually that's really cool
31:59
i can't believe this they were on
32:00
submarines wow and some paratroopers had
32:02
a pigeon in a sling on their chest wow
32:05
yeah a lot of these pigeons were given
32:07
the dicken medal um which is an award
32:09
for like brave animals
32:11
by the pdsa uh and i think more pigeons
32:14
have had that award than anyone yeah i
32:16
have a list of metal winning pigeons in
32:17
the second world war okay they included
32:19
tyke gustav paddy billy mary princess
32:24
commando scotch lass and william of
32:27
orange was commando the naked one
32:30
it also sounds like william of orange
32:32
has gotten the wrong list of your things
32:37
i also have a list of kings of england
32:40
which is henry the 8th james ii then

00:12
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:15
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:17
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:19
cover and garden my name is dan
00:21
schreiber i'm sitting here with james
00:22
harkin andy murray and anna jaczynski
00:25
and once again we have gathered around
00:26
the microphones with our four favorite
00:28
facts from the last seven days and in no
00:30
particular order here we go
00:32
starting with you jaczynski
00:35
my fact is that only 28 of people know
00:38
when they're being flirted with i never
00:40
know
00:41
ever do you think you you think people
00:43
are flirting or they aren't with you
00:45
aren't they aren't yeah so this is the
00:47
interesting thing people never assume so
00:48
they've done this study recently which
00:50
um looked at 52 heterosexual women 52
00:52
heterosexual men and they put them in
00:55
pairs together and made them have a
00:56
conversation and then afterwards they
00:57
asked them if they'd flirted with the
00:59
other person and then they asked them if
01:00
they thought the other person had been
01:01
flirting with them and you know lots of
01:04
people flirted and only 28 of people
01:06
realized they were doing it and in women
01:08
it was 18
01:10
so wow who knew that they were flirting
01:12
with someone else or that someone else
01:13
was flirting with them no ev when when
01:15
people flirted with other people they
01:17
were aware of it well sometimes they're
01:19
not i think sometimes you accidentally
01:21
yeah sometimes people are just so
01:22
flirtatious i get accused of that of
01:24
flirting when i'm not yeah james always
01:27
says
01:28
i do say that to you a lot and by the
01:30
way get your hand off my leg
01:32
oh this is an interesting thing about
01:33
flirting so men are perceived as being
01:35
better at flirting when these are some
01:37
of the behaviors that they engage in
01:38
when women think oh he's flirting and
01:40
he's good at it so for a start actually
01:43
looking at the person that you want to
01:44
flirt with that is a solid gold winner
01:46
that's really good okay also positioning
01:48
your body that it takes up more space
01:50
and
01:51
i'm doing what's called non-reciprocated
01:53
touching to surrounding men
01:56
so
01:56
this includes playfully shoving touching
01:58
or elbowing the ribs of other men around
02:00
you supposedly helps you flirt with a
02:03
woman that you're interested in on the
02:04
other side of a bar or something really
02:06
yeah you probably should know the person
02:08
when you're shoving them right yeah yeah
02:10
what happens is there's a massive bar
02:11
fight going on at the other side of the
02:13
bar and they go wow stop flirting with
02:15
me guys
02:16
well here's the last thing that this
02:17
study identified as supposedly a really
02:18
good sign is the men who were good at it
02:21
change their location in the bar more
02:22
frequently
02:23
[Laughter]
02:26
oh where's he gone
02:27
so he's not just literally playing hard
02:29
to get i suppose so he tried to walk
02:31
over to him and he's suddenly in a
02:32
different place playing hard to find
02:33
he's technically owners yeah
02:36
um you know how you'd think you're not
02:37
floating and you are dan yeah some
02:39
people think that they're flirting when
02:40
they're not what this is called um
02:43
signal amplification bias and it's where
02:45
you think that your gestures are making
02:47
it really clear that you're doing some
02:48
pretty duty flourishing but obviously
02:50
you're um the other person has no idea
02:53
so it's like when i'm in a bar and i'm
02:54
running around into lots of different
02:56
positions
02:58
the other person just hasn't noticed
03:00
punching random men in the face
03:02
yeah well i mean that's why the study
03:04
has ended up showing that people don't
03:05
know if they're being flirted with
03:06
because people don't flirt properly
03:08
because because the whole it's kind of
03:09
self-defeating flirting because the
03:11
whole point of it really is to be subtle
03:12
isn't it the whole point of flirting is
03:14
to kind of conceal and protect conceal
03:16
what you're trying to do and protect
03:17
yourself because you don't just walk up
03:19
to someone and go i fancy you do you
03:20
want to have sex so evolutionarily the
03:22
idea i think is that it could be
03:24
socially costly to kind of just go up to
03:27
someone and say you want to have sex
03:28
with them because if they say no then
03:29
you could get excluded from the group or
03:31
whatever yeah and it seems to be like a
03:32
uniquely human thing wow other animals
03:35
don't seem to do it really but i read
03:37
one article about the idea that other
03:38
animals don't really flirt and it said
03:40
um if other animals were to flirt would
03:42
we even be able to detect
03:44
it we can't detect when we're doing it
03:47
let's not get ahead of ourselves oh is
03:48
this mouse flirting i mean
03:50
focus on that woman over there
03:54
running around all over the floor so it
03:55
looks like it's flirting
03:57
but there was a natural history museum
03:59
uh exhibition that went on where their
04:01
whole premise was that animals do flirt
04:03
and obviously they must have just been
04:05
putting a nice little spin on it but
04:06
there are examples of sort of romantic
04:08
gestures it seems the idea with flirting
04:11
is it's something which you wouldn't
04:13
really be able to tell unless you can
04:15
just about kind of pick up on it oh i
04:17
disagree i think flirting can be
04:18
absolutely outright no it is it's a
04:20
defense mechanism rather than saying
04:22
because animals just go up to each other
04:23
and say let's sleep together that's what
04:25
all of their flowers
04:26
the amazonian river dolphin it brings a
04:29
bouquet of water weeds yeah that's not
04:31
subtle if someone brought you a bouquet
04:33
of water weeds do you know what they
04:34
wanted okay okay uh the how about
04:36
there's a haddock that hums
04:39
again that's not really flirting well if
04:41
you're going over again yeah i think
04:43
that could be
04:44
if she says
04:45
were you just no i was just humming i
04:47
was just tired
04:48
it's just a subtle that's a subtle
04:49
signal yeah i'm with you dan flirting's
04:51
quite a good way of trying to suss out
04:53
whether someone's gonna be worthwhile
04:55
without like in actually inviting them
04:58
to jump into bed with you because you
05:00
might decide halfway through the
05:01
flirting encounter that actually no this
05:02
guy's not right not sure how this fits
05:04
with your stats um but men
05:06
over perceive flirting and women
05:09
perceived flirting and the reason is um
05:11
because men if they over perceive and
05:14
they they don't get it right then they
05:15
just move on to the next woman it
05:17
doesn't really matter whereas if women
05:19
um overperceive then they might um have
05:21
sex with an undesirable man and end up
05:23
with weedy children and
05:25
yeah
05:26
yeah yeah i think that's very plausible
05:28
and that's definitely what this study
05:28
showed 16 of women recognized when
05:31
people were flirting but way more men
05:32
did so the because it is quite costly
05:35
for humans if you sleep with the wrong
05:36
person who turns out to be a bit of a
05:37
weed and doesn't give you good offspring
05:39
because that's like a nine month
05:40
gestation period and then you've got to
05:41
raise this kid who's weedy and [ __ ] like
05:44
the dad so they still under
05:46
underestimated it but right the word
05:49
flirting uh the word flirting used to
05:51
actually mean hitting somebody
05:53
did it yeah it also meant to turn up
05:55
one's nose or sneer at
05:57
least that's the verb anyway it's really
05:59
changed yeah yeah but since the fifth i
06:02
think in the 1560s samuel johnson
06:04
described the noun flirt as uh it's
06:06
always a female and it's a pert young
06:08
hussy i also like there were
06:10
alternatives to flirting uh which were
06:12
when it came to mean being uh it meant
06:15
being nimble often and i think that came
06:16
to be nimble conversationally and you
06:18
could also say someone was a flirty gig
06:20
or a flirt gillian
06:22
which i quite like to mean an unconstant
06:24
woman wow
06:25
they have a flirty gig um
06:27
this is weird scientists found that men
06:29
find happiness very attractive in a
06:31
woman but women find it one of the less
06:34
attractive things in a man what
06:35
happiness yeah apparently and shame sort
06:38
of doing what's called shameful displays
06:40
or displays of shame was more attractive
06:43
to women than happiness
06:45
what's a shameful display oh i'm so
06:47
embarrassed oh i can't do this okay you
06:49
know which explains hugh grant in a way
06:51
it's not dropping your trousers and
06:52
going no that's a penis
06:54
[Laughter]
07:00
i like this uh there was i think this is
07:02
in scientific american saying research
07:04
has split types of touching into three
07:06
categories so there's merely friendly
07:08
there's plausible deniability
07:10
which is what we were talking about like
07:12
if someone's like are you flirting with
07:13
me you can go no obviously not um and
07:15
then there's going nuclear and plausible
07:18
deniability includes an arm touch or a
07:20
shoulder or waist touch what's the going
07:22
nuclear kind of flip face touch
07:24
which would be a bit weird wouldn't it
07:26
if you were just in a pub with someone
07:27
and they leaned over and touched you on
07:28
the face
07:29
yeah
07:30
mid chat though it's not weird
07:32
dan if you ever do that to me
07:35
you're gonna be in serious trouble
07:37
no if you had like a thing on your head
07:39
i'd be like oh you got a thing on your
07:40
head i can't just touch people's faces
07:43
mid-conversation i'm constantly touching
07:45
faces
07:47
you can't i don't even ask i go right in
07:49
i don't why
07:51
because it's a very personal bit of the
07:52
body they've got a thing on their face
07:54
what's this thing you keep going on
07:56
about that yeah they've got the thing on
07:58
their face i think that's okay well i'm
07:59
i'm not
08:01
leaving this until we ascertain what the
08:02
thing is it might be like uh sometimes
08:05
people get glitter on their face or a
08:07
bit of um fluff why do i get the feeling
08:10
down that you go around with the bit of
08:11
glitter in your pockets
08:13
faces
08:15
i don't think it's weird to touch a face
08:17
i'm just putting that there i'd touch a
08:18
bus driver's face i would touch
08:21
that's why they've had to put the
08:22
screens in these
08:28
okay time for fact number two and that
08:30
is james okay my fact this week is that
08:33
ancient sumerian beer was as thick as
08:36
porridge and was drunk through a straw
08:40
that's so good it's good although it was
08:42
as thick as porridge what kind of a you
08:43
know heavy-duty straw is it like a
08:45
mcdonald's milk shake yeah yeah right um
08:48
the
08:49
oldest uh straw that they've ever found
08:51
was sumerian it was found in a tomb
08:53
dated 3000 bce and it was a gold tube
08:57
inlaid with lapis lazuli gold wow wow
09:01
and the thing is this um beer was it was
09:04
kind of fermented bread so it's a bit
09:07
like vass that they have in russia and
09:10
it was really really thick but you
09:11
wanted to drink mostly the liquid bit
09:13
and so you had the straw to stop the
09:15
bread from kind of going into your mouth
09:17
so so you just got the liquid bit and
09:19
they reckon that that's why the straw
09:20
was invented in general probably for
09:22
drinking beer that's cool and i think
09:24
pretty cool wasn't that first one it was
09:26
two men sharing a drink wasn't it in the
09:28
sumerian tomb which is nice
09:30
you can't share a straw though i think
09:32
they had a straw each okay cool well it
09:34
wasn't because they found the oldest
09:36
depiction of a straw and they also found
09:37
the oldest straw
09:39
and the depiction had a picture of two
09:40
men sharing a bit um yeah so this is
09:43
probably not the first beer in the world
09:45
that we know of because that was
09:46
probably ancient chinese
09:48
that was called kui uh but this is in
09:50
the in the let's say
09:52
near west
09:54
um
09:54
and it was sumerian and they had um a
09:57
few different words for beer it was
09:58
sikaru dida or a beer
10:02
no way
10:09
that's pretty cool isn't it that also
10:10
meant be a mug
10:11
and um they thought that beer was a gift
10:14
from the gods to promote human happiness
10:16
and well-being
10:19
and the first brewers were um they were
10:21
priestesses so the ancient egyptians
10:23
used to say to each other uh to greet
10:25
each other day to day they'd say bread
10:26
and beer and that basically meant
10:28
everything that is good in life
10:30
how cool is that yeah we should start
10:32
doing that again bread and beer isn't
10:34
that quite a long-running debate i mean
10:36
i think there is quite a long-running
10:37
debate about whether bread came first or
10:39
beer came first and a lot of
10:41
archaeologists think that we have
10:43
evidence to suggest that beer was brewed
10:45
before bread was made and one one
10:47
followed on from the other actually the
10:49
oldest bread maker was actually found
10:51
in a tomb which contained the oldest
10:53
depiction of a bread maker
10:57
there are loads of guys who try and
10:58
recreate very ancient beers oh yeah and
11:01
they have they find you know the right
11:04
sort of chemicals in tombs and things
11:05
like that and they they speculate that
11:07
this might have been beer or that this
11:09
contained the sort of flavorings that
11:10
were added to beer that they know around
11:12
the area so they try and remake all
11:13
these things they even do things like
11:15
killing goats to make fresh wine skins
11:17
yeah at the time that's so cool yeah
11:19
well not for the goat not for the goat
11:21
no
11:22
but they add things like
11:23
genuinely beer used to have things in it
11:25
like olive oil or cheese or carrot or
11:27
hemp all kinds of stuff will be added to
11:29
it i don't want to go to a party that
11:30
these guys are throwing through i'm
11:32
going to get a cheesy olive oily beer
11:34
there is one guy in oregon who's a
11:36
brewer and he made beer with yeast
11:38
harvested from his own beard
11:40
cool yeah how did that taste is that the
11:42
bottle was just it's just yeast you know
11:45
most used in the rest of the world is
11:46
found on animals and insects and rotting
11:48
fruits so it's not necessarily any
11:50
grosser even though it seems like it is
11:53
yeah it does
11:54
um there was some 170 year old beer
11:56
found in a shipwreck just off the coast
11:58
of finland either this year or last year
12:00
wasn't there and um the divers who went
12:02
down and they uncovered it i think there
12:04
were six bottles of beer and they
12:05
decided to taste it and uh it was pretty
12:07
disgusting i think
12:09
it's always disgusting whenever they do
12:10
this
12:11
you never learn we found some five
12:13
thousand year old honey should we give
12:14
it oh it's disgusting
12:15
[Laughter]
12:17
you say that but it could have been
12:19
disgusting in the first place indeed and
12:21
it probably was
12:23
they did when they analyzed it they said
12:25
that um it would have had hints of
12:26
soured milk and burnt rubber with some
12:29
rose-like notes and a goatee taste
12:32
a goatee as in a beard goatee
12:33
[Laughter]
12:36
um i'm one of those people that i love a
12:38
novelty beer i love the variety of new
12:40
beers that we have i don't know if i go
12:42
to an off license and i see you know
12:43
that iron maiden has a as a beer or ac
12:46
dc i'm going to buy that one did you
12:47
know that hanson the band released a
12:49
beer
12:50
no they
12:52
yes
12:54
yes it was how good was that yeah i was
12:56
gonna say they should have done a soft
12:57
drink called um pop oh yeah they could
13:00
see they've missed there's a whole range
13:01
of drinks that they could have done or a
13:03
range of cleaning items called mops
13:06
this could go on for a while
13:08
so um also uh one that i'd love to get
13:11
my hands on because it's a bit of a bit
13:12
of a historical or historically it will
13:14
be a bit of a famous beer um do you know
13:16
that david cameron
13:18
gave the coalition cabinet a beer well
13:21
you put them around no no he they
13:23
there's one beer between them that's
13:24
austerity
13:27
no um after it's after the final session
13:29
of the coalition cabinet um they got
13:31
goodie bags as they left and inside one
13:34
of the goodie bags was a coalition beer
13:37
which was called co-ale-ishen
13:40
beer
13:42
and it had on it on the back it said an
13:44
unconventional pairing this experimental
13:46
beer has astonished doubters and
13:48
exceeded expectations time for some
13:50
creative thinking with this carefully
13:52
crafted beer hints of oak and zesty
13:54
lemon deliver truly distinctive
13:55
refreshing flavor that lasts the
13:57
distance makes you feel sick after a
13:58
very short time yeah
14:01
um i was trying to look for which
14:03
country drinks most beer was just having
14:06
a few little people say it's czech
14:07
republic yep that's true so do you know
14:10
so as i was looking into this i also
14:12
found out what country drinks most wine
14:15
the vatican
14:16
oh yeah of course the vatican yeah yeah
14:19
but they are really the biggest
14:20
consumers of jesus's blood
14:22
oh that's they are also that yeah that's
14:24
true i forgot about that but they also
14:25
the vatican have their own vatican beer
14:27
they have a brewery that's um not too
14:29
far away from them uh and they have they
14:32
bring in cases and they love beer
14:35
apparently and it's only slightly a
14:37
rumor but when the uh when they were
14:38
deciding on the last pope there was
14:40
enough bottles for each of the people
14:43
who were uh deciding what would you call
14:45
them are they cardinals who do it but
14:46
they're there
14:47
yeah the electors basically there was
14:49
enough beer for one of them each the
14:50
electors
14:51
oh
14:53
my goodness
14:54
i just wanted to kill that because i
14:56
felt really bad for dan there and this
14:57
is why puns ruin all conversations yeah
14:59
because just for anyone listening james
15:01
and andy were looking into the sky not
15:03
listening to a word that dan was saying
15:04
desperately grappling for some pathetic
15:07
pun
15:08
relating to popes and beer
15:10
i think it's really inconsiderate to the
15:12
speaker
15:15
andy's still doing it
15:18
huh
15:26
time for fact number three and that is
15:28
andrew hunter murray my fact is that
15:30
baby turtles coordinate when they're
15:32
going to hatch from within their
15:33
eggshells
15:35
that is incredible it's so amazing so
15:38
they talk to each other yeah scientists
15:40
listen to the eggs to see if they made
15:42
any noise from within the shells and
15:43
they do and they actually found more
15:45
than 300 different noises coming from
15:47
them and i don't know if all of those
15:48
mean anything or have particular
15:50
meanings but there was one sound which
15:51
came only from nests which had only eggs
15:54
in so there were some which had only
15:56
eggs and there was some which had a
15:56
mixture of eggs and already hatched uh
15:58
babies and they believed that the babies
16:00
were communicating so that they could
16:02
coordinate when they all hatch together
16:04
because yeah when they hatch there's a
16:06
great advantage to having strength in
16:08
numbers
16:09
because the journey from what the point
16:12
where they hatch to the sea is so
16:13
dangerous and there are so many
16:14
predators who just hang around waiting
16:16
as the article i read put it while some
16:18
babies will be picked off by predators a
16:20
bird can only eat so many sea turtles at
16:22
a time
16:24
how do they coordinate the hatching is
16:26
is there a leader is there one leading
16:27
turtle
16:29
all right guys come on we can do this
16:31
leonardo
16:35
i saw a really good um i can't remember
16:37
where this was but uh four really good
16:40
pie charts which was the teenage mutant
16:43
ninja turtles proportion that they're
16:45
famous for being artists compared to
16:47
proportion that they're famous for being
16:48
turtles this is quite cool with
16:50
donatello obviously a tiny sliver of
16:52
famous artist
16:54
huge pie
16:56
so on communicating with things before
16:58
they hatch this is so-called birds do
17:00
the same thing wow and
17:02
some birds called superb fairy wrens
17:05
which we must have mentioned before
17:08
the mothers sing to the eggs to teach
17:10
them a password
17:12
which they have to use when they hatch
17:14
if they want food
17:16
wow and it's because loads of cuckoos
17:18
lay their eggs in superb ferry red nests
17:21
and
17:22
what's the password
17:23
[Laughter]
17:27
um and it's normally a single unique
17:29
note that they that the chicks know and
17:31
it what it means is that the cuckoos are
17:33
laid later on and they hatch earlier as
17:35
well so they only get about two days to
17:37
learn the password which is normally not
17:39
enough for them to actually process it
17:40
and learn it and ren embryos have about
17:42
five days
17:43
so if the cuckoo hatches and pushes out
17:45
the other eggs the parents can test it
17:47
with the password cuckoo doesn't know
17:49
the password and the parents can just
17:50
abandon it and fly off and make a new
17:51
nest and a new life um just one more
17:53
quite cool thing about eggs that i like
17:55
yeah uh so a sand gobi fish which you'd
17:58
recognize that you see them in europe um
18:01
the ma it's the responsibility of the
18:02
male goby fish to guard the eggs when
18:04
they've been laid by the female but he
18:06
gets really impatient because he wants
18:08
to have sex with as many females as he
18:10
can and like spread his seed as often as
18:11
he can so the female goby fish is like
18:13
i've laid the eggs now can you guard
18:15
these until they hatch and he knows that
18:17
the bigger the egg is the longer it
18:19
takes to hatch so he just eats all the
18:21
big ones oh
18:23
can't be bothered to wait for them it's
18:25
bad isn't it and usually like big you
18:26
know the bigger ones are going to be the
18:28
stronger healthier
18:30
yeah but he munches them right up
18:32
there's an octopus who's that's recently
18:34
been discovered um just stating its egg
18:36
or protecting its egg for um four and a
18:38
half years
18:40
yeah and supposedly they get so hungry
18:42
that they nearly starve and they have to
18:43
eat their own arms to survive while
18:45
they're protecting their offspring from
18:47
predators wow yeah and very often they
18:50
they're so knackered at the end of this
18:51
that when their offspring have
18:52
eventually gone swam away independently
18:54
they just they're pretty easy prey and
18:56
they yeah i think they've wasted away
18:58
didn't they die isn't that amazing yeah
19:00
this is really off topic but um i read
19:02
the other day that there's some um
19:04
jellyfish and if they lose an arm then
19:07
it's like some animals can grow arms
19:09
back but they can't do that but what
19:11
they can do is shuffle around all the
19:13
other arms so they're now symmetrical
19:15
again so they can go off like swim
19:16
properly what not look stupid
19:19
that is amazing i know
19:21
um so can i just say quickly my favorite
19:24
discovery about turtles this week yeah
19:26
uh scientists haven't yet properly
19:29
decided
19:30
on whether or not totals have a penis or
19:33
a phallus
19:34
what it's the same thing no apparently
19:36
it's not because penis uh should be
19:38
restricted to mammals
19:41
yet
19:42
they want to call it a penis
19:44
i read this in an article called
19:45
terrifying sex organs of male turtles
19:49
i think i've seen the film of that
19:54
um i do to be honest i asked anna to
19:57
read this article because i couldn't
19:58
understand all the big words and
20:01
so i don't know the answer to that uh no
20:03
one could it's not a
20:20
it's fine it's just very dense about how
20:21
like their organs work and there are a
20:23
couple of good things in that article
20:24
though um so i like the fact that they
20:26
they're referred to as the intermittent
20:28
organ when they're having this debate as
20:29
to whether it's the phallus or the penis
20:30
it's called the intermittent organ as in
20:32
the organ that sends something in um in
20:35
latin uh which is quite cool the other
20:38
thing that i think there was a spin-off
20:40
article from this that it uncovered is
20:42
if you google a cross-section of a
20:44
turtle penis
20:45
it looks exactly like a teenage mutant
20:47
ninja turtle head
20:49
doing it now doing it now
20:52
with the bandana and everything it's got
20:54
the bandana oh my god donatello
20:58
oh it does oh my god with the bandana
21:02
we'll have to put this up on the twitter
21:03
feed definitely i don't probably do it
21:07
i'll be on the qi podcast i guess yeah
21:09
qa podcast um so we were saying before
21:12
about how turtles kind of hatch and all
21:14
go down to the sea at the same time well
21:16
one problem that they have in florida is
21:18
people are accidentally drowning baby
21:20
tortoises
21:21
um because gopher tortoises nest in sand
21:24
dunes near to the sea
21:26
and people keep finding these little
21:28
tortoises and think they're turtles and
21:29
so put them back in the scene and they
21:31
just drown because they can't swim oh my
21:34
god that's so frustrating horrible in
21:37
the town of hilton head island i'm not
21:39
quite sure what this is i think it's in
21:40
america somewhere um there was a man who
21:43
was proposing to his um future wife and
21:46
lit a load of candles uh on the edge of
21:48
the beach uh and she said yes and they
21:51
retired to the room uh and they killed
21:54
60 baby sea
21:56
turtles why because they were attracted
21:59
to the light they were disoriented by
22:01
the light
22:02
and some tracks repeatedly encircled the
22:05
lanterns uh where the hatchlings
22:06
eventually succumbed to ghost crabs oh
22:09
my god what are they moths
22:11
what's this light thing i've never heard
22:13
this before any other animal getting
22:15
attracted to light well the thing is
22:16
there is one species of sea turtle who
22:18
hatched during the day and that's really
22:20
problematic obviously because
22:22
[Laughter]
22:28
yeah
22:28
um is that a bad omen like do you think
22:30
you'd cancel the cancel the wedding the
22:32
next day when you emerge from your tent
22:34
and see just dozens of tortoise
22:36
carcasses i know i don't normally
22:37
believe in omens or anything like that
22:39
but that is a bad sign sorry darling i
22:43
know we have been dating for 10 years
22:46
finally you've said yes but there's a
22:47
couple of dead centers
22:50
i wouldn't be willing to take the risk
22:52
just saying um another
22:54
quite funny turtle story um is
22:58
god how many died in this one
23:01
they're already really endangered all
23:03
seven species of sea turtle and here we
23:05
are casually making light of the death
23:07
of more
23:08
well include me out
23:10
go on okay we've included andy out but
23:12
for everyone else
23:14
uh so there's uh in somewhere in china i
23:16
remember where there was a drunk guy
23:18
known only as wang the article says so i
23:21
don't think he wanted to identify
23:22
himself in full um he got really drunk
23:25
ran into the seafood section of a
23:27
restaurant dunked his head in the fish
23:29
tank and tried to kiss a turtle at which
23:32
point
23:33
the turtle clamped onto
23:39
uh he had to go to hospital i think oh
23:41
no he had to be freed by having the
23:42
turtle decapitated what
23:46
oh
23:47
that was going so well
23:53
okay time to move on to our final fact
23:56
of the show and that's my fact my fact
23:58
this week is that the playwright henrik
23:59
ibsen's last words were to his nurse she
24:02
said to him that she thought he seemed
24:03
to be looking better and he replied on
24:05
the contrary and died
24:08
uh
24:09
it's it turns out that that's not as
24:12
exciting as i want it to be in that he
24:14
uh he actually died the next day but
24:15
those were the last words he said so i
24:17
think he must have lapsed into a coma or
24:19
oh he thought they were pretty good
24:21
words just gonna i'm gonna sit on those
24:23
yeah
24:24
i think i should collect a series of
24:26
last words just so that you know i've
24:28
got 20 or 30 things to say on my
24:30
deathbed and if i say one i can just
24:31
cross it off the list and then you know
24:33
i'll go on with the next one oh yeah yes
24:35
if everything you ever say is extremely
24:37
pithy and witty then it doesn't matter
24:39
when you die okay but we're dealing with
24:41
the real world here and i have to make
24:43
allowances his last words were a
24:45
terrible story about dead turtles his
24:47
last words were a long pause where he
24:49
was trying to come up with a pun
24:51
relating the pope to fear in some way
24:54
i think if you constantly pepper your
24:56
conversations with desperate attempts at
24:57
last words your death might come sooner
24:59
than you expect
25:04
so the thing about last words as you
25:06
when you suddenly put a sort of
25:08
researcher's eye onto it you realize
25:09
that no one ever said any of the things
25:12
that everyone thinks they said on their
25:14
deathbed oscar wilde either this
25:16
wallpaper goes or i do uh he's and the
25:18
actual thing he said was this wallpaper
25:20
and i are fighting a jewel to the death
25:22
either it goes or i do not the last
25:24
thing he said
25:25
not even close i mean that was that was
25:26
i think in the days preceding his death
25:28
um
25:29
dylan thomas was said to have said i've
25:31
had 18 straight whiskeys i believe
25:33
that's the record and that's those were
25:35
his last words such a good last line
25:37
it's an amazing last line
25:39
it's i think wasn't that there's some
25:40
controversy now because dylan thomas was
25:42
often assumed to have died of alcohol
25:44
poisoning and his family and other
25:46
people say quite strongly that he didn't
25:48
he just died of pneumonia and his agent
25:50
spread about this kind of falsehood
25:53
because his agent was actually a bit
25:54
lacks in looking after dylan thomas um
25:57
in the days preceding his death so
25:58
wanted to make it seem like he was a
25:59
hopeless drunkard his agent should have
26:01
made it what a magnificent agent i've
26:02
got i've always thought that
26:06
and now that he's freed up to work with
26:08
other people you should all apply
26:12
i think probably my favorite last words
26:15
and again who knows if these were
26:16
genuinely said but it was by french poet
26:19
uh slash
26:20
diplomat um died in 1955 called paul
26:23
claudel
26:24
and his last words were
26:26
doctor
26:27
do you think it was the sausage
26:28
[Laughter]
26:31
i looked up paul claudel just to see who
26:34
he was here's the opening line from his
26:36
obituary
26:37
poor cladel was a misogynist and
26:39
anti-semite and it is lavaphobe
26:42
it's just that's the opening sentence
26:44
opening sentence of what of his obituary
26:46
it wasn't written by his agent was it
26:48
exactly
26:49
this is going could you put and a poet
26:51
in there
26:55
one time when we do know people's last
26:57
words and when it's going to be
26:58
something quite pithy is when people
27:00
know they're going to die so people on
27:02
death row yeah yes
27:03
so there's a few famous ones of that
27:05
there was a murderer called james french
27:08
when he was on the electric chair he
27:09
shouted hey fellas how about this for a
27:11
headline for tomorrow's paper french
27:14
fries
27:15
it's a cracking one and another one who
27:17
did pretty much the same joke was called
27:19
george apple and when he was being
27:21
executed he said well gentlemen you are
27:23
about to see a baked apple
27:26
that is sort of copying well i don't
27:27
know who came first actually yeah
27:30
he was in the line behind them
27:32
that's pretty good
27:34
that's this is what happened if andy
27:35
heard some last slides that he was up
27:37
next
27:38
well my name isn't at all food related
27:40
so i'd be third in line going oh my god
27:42
what am i going to do
27:44
murray meant
27:45
[Laughter]
27:58
i just have one more last words thing
27:59
which actually is just
28:01
i just wanted to mention nero's last
28:03
words only because i read something else
28:04
about nero this week which i loved and
28:06
didn't know so uh nero quite famously
28:08
was supposed to have said i can't
28:10
remember who claimed it uh but someone
28:12
who was with him when he died so the
28:13
nero's last words were what an artist
28:15
the world is losing in me
28:17
um but something else cassius dio who
28:20
was with him when he died um but another
28:21
thing i learned about nero this week was
28:23
he was kind of a like
28:25
some people say it was the words for the
28:26
world's first known s m um propagator
28:30
and he liked to have himself dressed up
28:32
in animal skins like exotic animal furs
28:35
and he'd have people lock him in an
28:37
enclosure in a cage and then he'd like
28:39
get himself all worked up and then he'd
28:41
like to be released from this enclosure
28:43
and he'd gallop around like a wild beast
28:46
and there'd be a bunch of men hung up in
28:48
stocks around him and he'd attack their
28:50
genitals and bite them off for fun oh
28:52
wow yeah still not as weird as someone
28:54
touching your face
29:01
okay that's it that's all of our facts
29:03

00:10
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:13
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:15
coming to you from the qi offices my
00:17
name is dan schreiber i'm sitting here
00:19
with alex bell andy murray and anna
00:21
chazinski and once again we have
00:23
gathered around the microphones with our
00:24
four favorite facts from the last seven
00:26
days and in no particular order here we
00:28
go starting with you
00:31
andy murray my fact is that in peru
00:33
depictions of the last supper show jesus
00:36
and his disciples eating a guinea pig
00:39
that's what they do that's what is there
00:41
um
00:42
this is well there's one particular
00:44
famous painting by a guy called marcos
00:46
zapata who painted in 1755 a very large
00:50
painting fresco whatever it is of the
00:52
last supper and jesus and his disciples
00:54
are all sitting around a guinea pig
00:56
which has been char grilled and
00:57
barbecued is there any chance that they
00:59
would have eaten a guinea pig back then
01:01
was that food back then yeah
01:03
well not in the middle east i didn't
01:05
think did they come from the middle oh
01:06
sorry in the middle east sorry i thought
01:07
you meant were they taking it to south
01:09
america and because they getting pigs in
01:10
south america which they did which they
01:12
did okay yeah and they still do they're
01:14
really popular yes they're huge yeah
01:16
they 65 million every year
01:18
wow there's a lot each
01:20
and
01:21
they get um they get roasted and impaled
01:24
on skewers and then they're normally
01:26
brought to your table hole and then cut
01:27
into five pieces so they're quartered
01:29
and then they remove the head as well
01:32
what apparently the cheeks are really
01:33
nice because they're crispy and
01:35
presumably because they keep food in
01:36
them as well so they come free
01:39
just got some extra seeds
01:43
yeah um i was reading that more rabbits
01:45
and chickens are used as guinea pigs
01:48
than guinea pigs are yeah
01:50
for science research
01:51
and obviously uh mice and rats are the
01:54
big ones but um guinea pigs just are not
01:57
ever really used much for uh for science
02:00
however i then also read uh and i read
02:02
this in this was in squire uh the qi
02:05
database 23 nobel prizes in medicine
02:07
have been won thanks to guinea pigs wow
02:09
yeah so why did we call why why did the
02:11
term being used as a guinea pig was
02:13
there a time when there were there were
02:14
a few i mean 23 nobel prizes
02:18
it's from the 1800s and it's when the it
02:20
was robert [ __ ] wasn't it who was a
02:23
leading germ scientist in the 1800s and
02:25
he did a lot of his experiments on
02:26
guinea pigs i think in the 1880s ish um
02:29
and so he coined the term or someone
02:31
coined the term about him and people
02:33
just started using it
02:34
but yeah it's very uncommon to use
02:36
guinea pigs i think at a ratio of about
02:38
one to
02:39
a thousand in favor of using mice and
02:41
rats instead um guinea pigs yes are i
02:44
think the only other animals the only
02:46
other mammals except for humans that can
02:48
get scurvy and that was one thing we use
02:50
them for is um finding out the cause of
02:53
scurvy is transferring our scurvy into
02:55
the guinea pigs no finding out the cause
02:57
of scurvy um which we did but yeah they
02:59
can get it so all other animals are able
03:00
to um create vitamin c internally but we
03:03
can't guinea pigs can't wow we're
03:05
together in that and also
03:08
guinea pigs unrelatedly were the first
03:11
creatures to have a pap smear done on
03:12
them what you know a cervical smears
03:15
yeah i know all right okay cool yeah so
03:17
mr pap papanopoulos whatever he was
03:20
called yeah when he went to america
03:21
wasn't allowed to experiment on any
03:22
humans and so he just took lots of
03:24
guinea pigs and had to work out their
03:25
menstrual cycles which he found quite
03:27
difficult i think but did he have tiny
03:29
stirrups for their legs
03:33
and he'd leave them alone in the room to
03:35
set themselves up and come in
03:36
the gloves
03:38
have you ever seen a guinea pig hobbling
03:40
a little bit that's what they've just
03:41
been doing awkward conversation about oh
03:44
yeah plans for the weekend
03:47
um in pre-spanish south america in peru
03:50
in a city called cuthco i think is how
03:52
it's pronounced um a thousand white
03:54
guinea pigs were sacrificed every year
03:56
in the square to appease the gods
03:58
and to stop them you know harming the
04:00
crops and things like that yeah wow um
04:03
but there is a ceremony today where you
04:05
go house to house and you collect loads
04:06
of guinea pigs from people it's called
04:08
jacka sari i think and then you release
04:11
them and apparently a mock bull fight
04:13
which i think sounds brilliant in a tiny
04:16
ring you put tiny horns on them
04:18
i mean is it a bullfight in that people
04:20
oppose them
04:21
oh yeah
04:22
getting flipped over into the crowd
04:25
just a matador versus a guinea pig i've
04:27
blown a guinea figure on
04:31
all the headlines the next day three
04:32
more gourd in guinea pig accidents
04:36
um just quickly back to the original
04:38
fact
04:39
so this picture of the last supper was
04:41
this the cusco cathedral one it was the
04:44
cusco cathedral okay because there's a
04:45
lot more items on that table as well
04:48
that they seem to have identified as
04:50
part of the last supper
04:52
so to represent the 12 disciples they
04:54
had 12 dishes on the table so it that
04:56
includes prawn soup
04:59
very nice polenta
05:01
salad corn cake
05:03
uh there was rice with milk cake yellow
05:05
bread it's quite cool it's quite a
05:07
variety it sounds like they've cooked in
05:08
they didn't order out from somewhere
05:10
yeah yeah i'm also so skeptical that
05:12
peop when people claim to be able to
05:13
identify very specific types of foods oh
05:15
it's prawn soup there yeah
05:18
one of them is handing the menu back to
05:20
the waiter he's pointing with his finger
05:22
at the prawn suit there's a specials
05:24
menu in the background if you look very
05:26
closely
05:27
speaking of items on the table in da
05:28
vinci's last supper yeah there's lots of
05:30
stuff again strewn over the table the
05:32
first thing is that there's um there are
05:33
oranges there which is a you know a
05:35
mistake as it were because oranges
05:37
weren't around in the middle east until
05:38
centuries after jesus was supposed to
05:40
been around and the other thing is that
05:41
in 2007 an italian computer technician
05:44
announced that he had discovered a
05:45
secret song that was hidden in in the da
05:48
vinci's last supper so all this bread
05:50
and stuff strewn over the table if you
05:52
superimpose us onto a stave
05:55
all different things are musical notes
05:56
and he says he says that if you play it
05:58
it sounds a bit like a requiem
06:01
but crucially not enough like correctly
06:03
the museum said the theory was plausible
06:06
that's very that's a very polite very
06:08
accommodating thing
06:11
there's another theory by this uh
06:12
historian called john variano who thinks
06:15
that the he says there is orange on the
06:17
table but he thinks that they're eating
06:19
eel in da vinci's last supper because
06:21
apparently that was a popular meal in
06:23
the 15th century in italy when da vinci
06:25
was painting so yeah eel and orange
06:27
slices um there was this thing that he
06:29
was so he was obviously commissioned to
06:30
do this uh da vinci this this portrait
06:33
and it was done in uh what was
06:34
effectively a monks canteen which i
06:36
didn't know uh but it wasn't a canteen
06:38
when it was painted it got it it wasn't
06:40
it was it was it just looked so
06:42
delicious on the wall
06:44
you know it would be great in this room
06:47
um it's very uh dilapidated and
06:50
basically rubbish isn't it and in fact i
06:52
think basically rubbish but basically i
06:54
could do better um
06:56
i think if you asked who painted da
06:58
vinci's
07:00
last supper the answer would not be da
07:02
vinci i don't think there's a single bit
07:04
of paint left now on it that is
07:06
paint because it was so badly done
07:08
because it was essentially a failure he
07:10
had never really painted murals before
07:11
didn't know the right equipment to use
07:13
or the right um substances and so they
07:15
eroded really quickly within his
07:16
lifetime and it kept on having to be
07:18
redone and touched up and it didn't work
07:20
very well and for centuries it was kind
07:22
of neglected because it was just like
07:23
broken bits of stone and also the jesus
07:27
in the middle used to have feet didn't
07:29
he yes and then they just plowed a door
07:32
through the middle of that painting
07:35
and so the feet are gone and that's why
07:38
there's that weird arch in the middle of
07:39
the painting that looks a bit out of
07:40
place and you can't see jesus legs um
07:43
did you know that van gogh painted a
07:45
version of the last supper no didn't ah
07:48
yeah he did it was uh you know his cafe
07:51
terrace most famous van gogh painting
07:53
probably one of the very most famous
07:55
cafe terrace lots of people sitting out
07:56
anyway there was this academic paper
07:58
written about how van gogh had written a
08:00
letter to his brother while he was
08:01
painting that saying i really need some
08:02
religion in my life and then he's drawn
08:04
this picture with 12 diners with a guy
08:06
walking away as in the judas character
08:08
who's often shown to be walking away in
08:10
the last supper depictions um with
08:12
there's if you look at the window in the
08:14
back it's got a crossed window pane
08:16
which isn't just a cross window pane
08:18
it's a crucifix that's hanging behind
08:21
everyone in the picture that's the
08:23
latest theories there are some other
08:25
versions of there are so many versions
08:26
of like the last supper in pain in
08:28
painting and yeah my favorite is juan de
08:30
juanes which is the spanish painter who
08:32
painted his version and it's really easy
08:34
to decide to um to identify which
08:37
disciple is is each person because
08:39
inside the halos he's written their name
08:41
suspended
08:43
because if you all go in somewhere
08:44
you'll hang up your halos at the door
08:46
and then if you leave you don't want to
08:47
get someone else's which is the wrong
08:48
thing you look like an idiot
08:50
it looks like when when you look at the
08:52
tags on a facebook photo and everyone's
08:54
names come up there's exactly that's
08:56
brilliant he was tagging he was tagging
08:58
him
08:59
it's the best thing literally just
09:00
written them in it's hilarious
09:06
okay time for fact number two and that
09:09
is alex okay my fact is that there is a
09:11
skyscraper in new york with a 400 ton
09:14
weight in the top which moves around to
09:16
stop the building from falling over
09:18
that's so cool okay so this is actually
09:20
one of loads of buildings this was just
09:21
the first one to have this technology in
09:22
the u.s it's the city group center i
09:24
mean everyone has probably heard about
09:25
how tour buildings often are built on
09:27
flexible foundations they've got um
09:29
they're basically sitting on big springs
09:31
so um it insulates them from earthquakes
09:33
and it makes them sway slightly but
09:35
another problem with really tall
09:36
buildings is not just earthquakes it's
09:38
that the wind might blow them over
09:39
because they're so big so there's this
09:41
technology called tuned mass damping
09:43
which is basically a really heavy weight
09:45
usually several hundred tons heavy
09:47
that's installed in the top floors of
09:49
the skyscraper and the weight is
09:51
attached to pneumatic supports or cables
09:52
or something and the building has a
09:54
computer system which works out which
09:56
direction the wind is coming from and it
09:59
shifts the weight into that direction so
10:00
that the building leans into the wind
10:02
slightly and it can reduce the amount
10:03
that the building is swayed by the wind
10:04
by about 50 or sometimes more wow so i'm
10:07
never going into any building which has
10:08
the stairs
10:10
but this is the thing when you start
10:11
looking into how these buildings stay up
10:13
and technology we use you don't want to
10:14
go in any of these skyscrapers because
10:15
they just don't seem that you just you
10:17
wonder how any building stays up even a
10:19
couple of stories high because it's just
10:20
so sort of scary have you seen how they
10:23
demolish skyscrapers in japan no it is
10:26
so cool they start with the ground floor
10:29
and they work their way up
10:30
sorry yes they've also mattered
10:33
yeah does it just drop down one floor
10:35
and then they get to what do you mean
10:37
genuinely they do this so what they do
10:38
is they take the ground floor and they
10:40
replace all the building supports with
10:41
hydraulic jacks right so really really
10:44
enormous you know steel pillars to the
10:46
height of the first floor um and they
10:48
put those in place of the proper
10:50
supports and then they remove all the
10:51
internal walls and support and then very
10:53
slowly and carefully they lower the
10:55
hydraulic jacks over a period of a
10:56
couple of hours and then boom you have
10:59
now a building which is one story
11:01
shorter and then you do it again and you
11:03
do it again and you do it again and it's
11:04
a way of very slowly dissolving it isn't
11:07
it amazing that's a bit like how cranes
11:09
big cranes um put themselves together
11:11
and dismantle themselves you build the
11:12
top bit and then you you you know
11:15
they're all built in segments like bit
11:16
like lego and um it slides in the bottom
11:19
segment and shifts itself up and slides
11:21
in and obviously you're using the actual
11:23
you know the cables in the crane to move
11:24
this stuff around so it's literally
11:25
building itself i've been asking that
11:27
question for years without ever thinking
11:29
to google it i've always wanted to know
11:30
how a crane gets there yeah it's amazing
11:32
that's awesome um
11:35
sorry go on i was gonna say uh talking
11:36
of cranes i was i was looking at the
11:38
difference between building in different
11:39
places and one of which is these this
11:42
local protected view laws and it's
11:44
basically the idea that that there are
11:46
lots of views from one place to another
11:47
in london which you can't obstruct do
11:49
you know the cheese grater skyscraper
11:51
it's basically it looks like a giant
11:52
cheese grater because it just it just
11:53
looks like it has a huge slice chopped
11:55
off it the reason it's that shape is
11:57
because there's a pub on uh fleet street
11:59
from which you can see some paul's
12:00
cathedral and
12:02
when they tried to build a building they
12:03
were told they weren't allowed to impose
12:04
on the views they've had this huge
12:05
skyscraper now sort of leans one way wow
12:08
isn't that ridiculous there are 13 of
12:10
the main protected view laws from one
12:12
park to another landmark which you can't
12:14
put anything in front of anna and i went
12:15
to greenwich very recently to um the
12:19
museums there and we saw greenwich
12:21
meantime the meridian line and the laser
12:24
there's this big green laser that shoots
12:27
out and so at night that's what you see
12:29
it's the it shows you time it's the line
12:31
of time and basically um what happened
12:34
was a new building structure had gone up
12:37
across the river and the laser went
12:39
directly into one of the rooms of this
12:41
apartment block and they complained and
12:44
so they've had to change the line of
12:45
time it's just pointing a bit higher now
12:47
because that's so funny yeah residents
12:49
were getting slightly
12:50
nervous going into someone's bedroom
12:52
right and just hitting his bedroom so
12:53
he's trying to sleep with his enormous
12:54
laser coming through his laser every
12:55
time he's made of time
12:58
um and related to that twenty fence fen
13:00
church street which is the huge bulbous
13:02
skyscraper the walkie-talkie in london
13:03
yeah it hit the headlines in 2013
13:05
because it was it has a big curved front
13:07
and it was focusing all the sun's rays
13:09
and melting um a bit of the pavement
13:11
some cars on it
13:12
as the architect who's called rafael
13:14
vinoli he's done it before he designed a
13:16
massive hotel called the hotel uh vadara
13:18
in las vegas which also has a massive
13:20
curved front and would heat up the
13:21
swimming pool and melt people's plastic
13:22
cups so knowing that he'd done that
13:24
several years before they a hired him at
13:26
all and then b he came up with this
13:27
design for a new massive curve boom like
13:29
yeah that's probably going to be fine i
13:30
read that that's called the vadara death
13:32
threat yeah ridiculous so yeah he keeps
13:34
designing buildings that end up being
13:36
called the death something yeah maybe
13:37
the death ray is it no okay
13:40
um just speaking of things being on one
13:42
side or another of a line yes um this is
13:45
kind of not relevant to the fact but i
13:46
found out recently and i like it so much
13:48
there's a hotel in europe which is half
13:49
in france and a half in switzerland
13:52
genuinely uh it's called the hotel abez
13:54
and uh it was france and switzerland
13:56
were trying to swap a bit of land
13:57
because the french wanted a particular
13:59
bit so they had to concede a bit and
14:00
they just conceded a bit of land in 1862
14:03
and yeah the border shifted but the
14:05
building stayed where it was
14:06
so the international border goes across
14:08
the dining room and supposedly across
14:11
the bed in the honeymoon suite
14:13
so it's like a passport guard right in
14:15
the middle you can have a honeymoon in
14:16
two different countries yeah yeah which
14:18
countries france and sweden switzerland
14:21
i love the idea of a passport a border
14:23
control yeah
14:24
there's a massive fence going through
14:25
sweden well you know how like you name
14:27
your child sometimes after where they
14:28
were conceived
14:33
um so i was reading uh those kind of
14:36
classic things that you hear about
14:37
skyscrapers and one of the things is if
14:39
you throw a penny off the empire state
14:41
building it'll drill through your head
14:42
is the myth
14:44
and it is a myth um and so it won't
14:47
actually do any harm to you it will kind
14:49
of float down like a leaf is what they
14:50
say in a guy a guy actually didn't
14:52
expect well not obviously he basically
14:54
said if it hit you it would feel like a
14:56
flick on your head right um because it's
14:58
a flat surface it kind of catches the
15:00
air and like a leaf it kind of just
15:01
oscillates in that way um and he did
15:04
tests in in wind tunnels where he was
15:06
having coins pelted at his head and he
15:08
said oh a few hit but it felt fine but
15:10
so this is interesting i think most
15:12
people do know now that a penny falling
15:14
off will do nothing to you yeah however
15:16
if you throw a pen off the empire state
15:19
building that can definitely kill you
15:21
because that ends heaviest yeah and it
15:23
shoots down like an arrow streamlined
15:25
yeah yeah yeah so if it went into the
15:27
ground it would absolutely just chip the
15:29
sidewalk um that's how much force it
15:32
comes down to wow 200 miles per hour is
15:34
what it would travel down as like an
15:35
arrow
15:36
um did you know that fish live in
15:38
skyscrapers in a way
15:41
is this the one that's been accidentally
15:43
overwhelmed by fish
15:45
they live in towers basically beneath
15:47
oil rigs
15:48
so you get floating oil rigs and
15:51
marine biologists have studied the
15:53
effect it has on sea life and they live
15:55
in a huge column stretching all the way
15:57
from the oil rig right to the bottom of
15:58
the sea floor that life is so much more
16:00
abundant but only in this one column wow
16:03
isn't that cool yes that's really cool
16:05
because i suppose you get lots of things
16:07
falling down from above
16:09
so lots of bottom feeders and things we
16:11
use sediment from animals which have
16:12
been living closer above there and then
16:13
at the top there must be more things
16:14
growing there which is for fish to eat
16:17
which live near the surface yeah so it
16:18
has a whole effect all the way down i
16:20
love it i wonder which in it would it be
16:22
the opposite that in a normal skyscraper
16:25
you want to be on the top floor because
16:26
of the view in their one do you want to
16:27
be closer to the bottom is there a
16:29
better view down there there's not much
16:30
light i suppose and there's loads of
16:31
pressure depending on how deep it gets
16:33
yeah
16:33
there's no view at all basically where
16:36
was it
16:38
because there's no light yeah not sort
16:40
after real estate if you've already
16:42
invested you've made what have you
16:44
bought
16:45
what did the estate agent say
16:47
my fish are gonna hate me speaking of
16:50
fish and buildings um the
16:52
national fisheries development board
16:55
which is a branch of government and
16:56
hyderabad and hyderabad in india is
16:58
shaped like a huge fish
17:00
and i think that for all government
17:02
departments we should have the buildings
17:04
shaped like what they are wouldn't that
17:07
be cool oh right so like the department
17:09
of defense would be a machine gun or
17:11
something
17:14
do we use machine guns in war uh
17:16
probably not but department of housing
17:17
would just be a really small shitty
17:19
house yeah
17:22
this is a country where lots and lots of
17:23
the government buildings like this and i
17:25
think it's it's one of the stands and i
17:26
think it might be turkmenistan
17:29
um but that's also a very awful
17:31
dictatorship in lots of ways still don't
17:33
think it is still is it um it used to be
17:35
what's his face um crazy guy who named
17:37
his bread after his wife and stuff
17:39
sapamura niyazov i think was his name
17:41
yeah yeah you're so right and um
17:44
the the building that's shaped it is in
17:46
turkmenistan the building that's shaped
17:47
like a book is called the house of free
17:49
creativity in ashgabat and um it was
17:52
opened in 2006 under the previous rule
17:54
of stephan murray niazov and uh all the
17:57
journalists who worked in it worked for
17:58
the state-run media there are no foreign
18:00
media allowed or there weren't at the
18:02
time and there was also almost no free
18:05
internet access
18:07
so that was the house of free creativity
18:10
that is one of the most orwellian
18:12
[Laughter]
18:20
okay time for fact number three and that
18:23
is jaczynski
18:25
my fact is that one of canada's leading
18:27
crime writers lost the ability to read
18:29
without losing the ability to write
18:31
um so it's this guy called howard engel
18:34
um he's really famous crime writer in
18:36
canada he's created this detective
18:37
called benny cooperman who is the
18:39
private eye with the hard head and the
18:41
tender heart
18:42
and um he was one of the founders of
18:44
crime writers of canada he's been the
18:46
first person to be awarded the grand
18:48
master award for crime writing wow by
18:50
the crime writers of canada and he in
18:53
july 2001 he woke up uh felt fine went
18:58
down made himself some breakfast went to
19:00
pick up the newspaper off his doorstep
19:02
looked at the newspaper and it looked
19:04
like it was written in complete
19:05
gibberish so he couldn't read any of it
19:07
he said it looked like it was written in
19:09
cyrillic one moment in korean the next
19:11
uh he said he was remained totally calm
19:12
thought i've probably had a stroke went
19:14
and woke his son up said i can't read
19:16
anymore can you take me to hospital um
19:17
he went to hustle had lots of tests they
19:19
confirmed he had a stroke but it turned
19:20
out he realized after a while of nurses
19:23
looking into what had happened that he
19:25
could still write absolutely perfectly
19:27
so
19:28
what isn't this mental so he's a quite
19:31
an amazing case he's worked incredibly
19:33
hard and oliver sacks has written an
19:34
amazing piece on him he's worked really
19:36
hard to teach himself to read again so
19:39
basically he's lost the
19:41
visual ability to read um but he so he's
19:44
turned into a sensory ability instead so
19:46
when he's trying to read he'll shape out
19:48
the shape of letters either with his
19:50
hand in the air or actually he reads
19:52
with his tongue so he makes the shapes
19:54
of letters on the top of his mouth as
19:55
he's reading them because he recognizes
19:57
the shapes like the touch of them oh wow
19:59
because he can't recognize it like with
20:00
his eyes like the visual cortex part has
20:02
died yeah um and so he said that he bit
20:04
his tongue recently and he said that
20:06
rendered him illiterate for weeks and
20:08
weeks
20:08
but um he's taught himself to read again
20:11
very slowly but he does go now back over
20:13
his books and properly try and edit them
20:15
as much as he can
20:16
he's doing it fast enough that he can he
20:18
can almost keep up with subtitles on a
20:19
foreign film like that's how fast he
20:21
could write with his tongue on top he
20:23
can read half the subtitles
20:25
he said almost i can always follow the
20:27
film i read that yeah
20:29
um just quickly oliver sacks so oliver
20:31
sacks wrote about him in his book the
20:33
mind's eye he also wrote an afterwards
20:35
to engel's book which was called the man
20:37
who forgot how to read so oliver sacks
20:40
um who's very sadly uh very ill at the
20:42
moment you know him as the man who wrote
20:44
all those great books like awakenings
20:46
and the man who mistook his wife for a
20:49
hat
20:50
all these people with these amazing
20:51
psychological uh i guess a disability
20:54
yeah he has one himself and i had no
20:56
idea i think that's why he started is
20:58
that how he started he's got face
21:00
blindness yeah yeah he can't remember
21:02
faces yeah including his own and he says
21:05
that he will often be looking into a
21:07
mirror apologizing to this man who's on
21:09
the in front of him going sorry who are
21:12
you and you realize oh no what that's a
21:13
mirror that's my own face he just
21:15
doesn't recognize his own face wait but
21:17
surely he recognizes a mirror yeah he
21:19
should have
21:20
if he's got like wall-length mirrors but
21:22
he thinks there's someone should get
21:23
smaller mirrors don't live in a house of
21:25
mirrors you can't recognize your own
21:26
face yeah maybe he's maybe he's um
21:29
exaggerating
21:31
um just one more thing on oliver sacks
21:33
quickly before we go away from him um
21:35
his mother
21:36
uh was a surgeon and she studied under
21:39
mary curie really yeah wow that's quite
21:42
cool um have some other weird stroke
21:44
effects oh yeah uh malcolm maya who's a
21:46
retired lorry driver he had a stroke he
21:48
lost the ability to feel sad he said i'm
21:50
never depressed being sad wouldn't help
21:52
anything anyway i would definitely
21:53
rather be happy all the time than the
21:55
other way around it's an advantage
21:56
really but i mean he would say that
21:58
exactly yeah
22:00
i was thinking it's the only it's the
22:01
only time when you go to the doctor and
22:02
they'll be like how are you feeling
22:03
we're like oh can't complain and that's
22:05
actually like i literally caught you no
22:07
you don't understand um there was a
22:09
swiss woman in geneva who had a stroke
22:10
and it gave her a phantom third arm
22:12
which her body completely thought was
22:14
real so if she was asked to move it her
22:17
brain would look like it was moving if
22:18
she was asked to scratch herself if she
22:20
had an itch her body would think it had
22:21
been scratched so that's actually quite
22:23
useful if you you know if you have an
22:25
itch and you're doing something with
22:26
your hands yeah the third arm you can
22:27
scratch or you can give people the
22:28
finger and they won't know on
22:30
amazing brain stuff you know you can
22:33
have like acquired savant so you know
22:37
there are all these savants in the world
22:38
who like have an extraordinary ability
22:41
to uh retain knowledge or some
22:42
extraordinary mental ability that goes
22:44
beyond what the brain can normally
22:46
achieve and there are actually only 330
22:48
of them in the world that we know of 30
22:50
of them acquired their abilities after a
22:52
head injury so you can have a head
22:54
injury and it's thought that in these
22:55
cases it unleashes a bit of the brain
22:58
that a lot of us don't have access to
23:00
and that's what causes people um for
23:02
instance there's this guy called derek
23:03
amato who hit his head on the bottom of
23:05
a pool and now he's a master pianist um
23:08
there's another guy called orlando cyril
23:11
who was hit with a baseball when he was
23:12
10 and he's been able to remember the
23:15
weather for every single day following
23:16
that accident
23:19
so it just knocks a bit of the brain
23:21
that like allows these pathways to
23:23
connect which couldn't before but is
23:24
there any concomitant damage that means
23:26
he can't remember other things or does
23:28
it not seem to have a i think there
23:29
might often be yeah yeah yeah
23:32
uh there's a this is an interesting
23:34
thing there's a british journalist
23:35
called a.a gill if you don't know him
23:37
he's massive in britain um he is
23:40
completely dyslexic to the point where
23:41
he can't actually write he has to
23:44
dictate every single bit of journalism
23:45
he's written to someone and i i never
23:48
heard that before easy it's very
23:50
pleasing to think that a a gill and
23:51
barbara cutland have something in common
23:53
yeah
23:56
um
23:58
she did sort of one sentence paragraphs
24:00
really that was you know robert
24:02
carlton's style was it yeah but i mean
24:04
prousted that as well
24:06
again i think there's a web of talent
24:08
here
24:09
and i'm not yeah i don't want to
24:10
criticize barbara carter shall we set
24:11
them all up barbara cartland a a gill
24:13
and marcel prus
24:15
what do you say i smell a sitcom
24:24
okay time for the final fact of the show
24:26
and that is my fact my fact this week is
24:28
that steve wozniak the co-founder of
24:31
apple and the inventor of the personal
24:33
computer met his wife on a dial-a-joke
24:36
call
24:37
now dialer joke calls used to be
24:39
massively popular they were effectively
24:41
you called up a phone line and the phone
24:44
just told you a joke so it would just it
24:46
would just have a recording amazing yeah
24:49
and then it got a bit more advanced so
24:51
initially it was just a bunch of jokes
24:53
that were spoken into a tape recorder
24:55
and the tape recorder was the answering
24:57
machine so the answering machine was
24:58
just playing over and over so i would
25:00
tell you a knock-knock joke and then it
25:01
would tell you three men walk into a bar
25:02
joke and then it got to the point where
25:04
someone physically picked up the phone
25:07
and started telling you jokes and that's
25:09
so steve wozniak before he got into
25:12
working and
25:13
creating personal computers yeah he's
25:15
one of the apple founders he is the
25:17
co-founder of apple with steve jobs he's
25:19
he's the other he's the other guy and
25:21
actually he's the guy who created the
25:22
personal computer steve jobs was the
25:24
genius who marketed it and helped get it
25:26
out there but was as he's known is the
25:28
guy who actually invented it so he's
25:30
he's a big name in our in our uh modern
25:33
time um
25:34
so speaking of people talking
25:36
robotically on the phone things like
25:37
this uh recently there was a guy at the
25:40
new york city health department and he
25:42
was suspended for 20 days for answering
25:43
the phone in a robotic voice
25:47
and he was
25:49
he sued them over it or they sued him
25:50
possibly but he basically during the
25:52
trial he told the judge he wasn't a
25:53
people person and he was doing it to
25:55
avoid banter with people because people
25:58
talk very differently to a robotic
25:59
service if you can give options and
26:01
answers you just do it quite quickly and
26:02
you get through it so yeah that's the
26:04
reason he did it was interesting the
26:06
people who voiced siri so there's a guy
26:08
in the uk who voices the male the male
26:10
voice and a woman called susan bennett
26:11
in the u.s um and they were specifically
26:14
chosen to get to read out and record all
26:16
the words for siri because they have
26:17
very monotonous voices
26:19
so they might have trouble anytime they
26:21
ring someone up they'd get hung up
26:22
because they've seen their ppi one of
26:24
those guys is called john briggs and um
26:26
his voice is everywhere he's been a
26:27
voice artist for 30 years so his voice
26:29
is really everywhere by now so once a
26:30
friend of his uh was walking past his
26:32
daughter's bedroom and heard john
26:34
briggs's voice coming from inside it
26:35
turned out that tribal was playing a
26:37
game with animated penguins who all had
26:38
the voice of
26:40
their friend john
26:41
at one point briggs himself got a phone
26:43
call from himself trying to sell payment
26:45
protection insurance
26:48
can you imagine um so on steve wozniak
26:51
so he sounds like the most annoying
26:53
college student um he built this little
26:55
circuit i don't even know how the
26:57
technology would work at all but he
26:58
built a circuit that would jam tv
26:59
signals and then when they were in
27:01
college and all watching tv with friends
27:03
then he would like trigger the circuit
27:05
that he built in his pocket so that the
27:07
tv signal would jam and then someone
27:08
would go up to try and fix it and as
27:10
they fiddled about with the aerial then
27:12
he'd stop it from jamming so the tv
27:14
would be okay then the person would go
27:15
back and sit down he'd put the circuit
27:17
on again so they'd go and fix it and
27:19
eventually it got to the stage where
27:21
whenever him and his friends got
27:22
together and were watching tv they'd
27:24
have to have one person all the time
27:26
holding the aerial because he had
27:27
convinced his friends that that was what
27:29
was required yeah
27:31
how annoying is that
27:32
i saw steve wozniak talk in edinburgh a
27:35
few years ago and i thought i'm
27:38
listening to one of the greatest
27:39
happiest most enthusiastic he was a
27:41
prankster he did a lot of pranks and
27:43
there was
27:44
i don't there's nothing sinister about
27:46
what he was doing obsessed with pranking
27:48
didn't he wasn't he one of the people
27:49
who developed one of the first universal
27:50
remotes or was yes yeah that is him that
27:52
sounds like he was kind of basing it off
27:54
yeah yeah he i mean that's he he
27:57
absolutely loved pranking that's kind of
27:59
the thing that when steve jobs and him
28:00
were introduced to each other that was
28:01
one of the sentences that said you guys
28:03
will love each other because you're
28:04
pranksters because they did freaking
28:06
didn't they they did do freaking yeah
28:07
which is basically pranking yeah so just
28:10
with the dialer joke thing he was the
28:12
first person to set that up in the san
28:14
francisco bay area so he ran dial a joke
28:16
in the place um and then he eventually
28:18
went to the phone calls when his wife
28:20
called him um or his future wife rather
28:23
uh his opening words were i bet i can
28:25
hang up faster than you and hung up on
28:27
her straight away that was her phone
28:28
call she called back immediately and
28:30
then they started talking hard to get
28:31
yeah exactly
28:33
hard to get straight away
28:34
it was like the opposite of you hang out
28:36
you hang up yeah
28:39
me hang up
28:40
hello
28:43
so was the apple computer just a massive
28:44
prank then the battery life certainly is
28:48
[Laughter]
28:49
speaking of apple computer have you
28:51
heard about the san francisco recycling
28:54
center that's had to put a big call out
28:56
asking for the owner of an apple
28:57
computer because this elderly woman um
29:00
so i think 70 something year old woman
29:02
her husband had recently died and she
29:04
got a bunch of stuff out of his attic
29:05
and she handed it to the recycling
29:06
center to sell on and it turned out that
29:09
one of the things that she handed in was
29:10
an apple one computer which is made by
29:12
steve wozniak himself there are about
29:14
200 made i think there are about 60 left
29:17
in the world um it's worth 200 000
29:20
for which they've sold it and now they
29:21
owe this woman as part of the you give
29:23
things into the recycling center
29:24
agreement they owe this woman a hundred
29:26
thousand dollars and they don't know
29:28
where she is so facebook and google and
29:30
loads of different company like internet
29:32
companies she's giving away a computer
29:36
maybe have you put a sign up somewhere
29:49
but one of the reasons all the apple one
29:50
computer is so scarce is because when
29:52
apple ii came out steve jobs and steve
29:54
wozniak gave all the apple one owners
29:56
incentives to give them back you know
29:57
they would give them money off the apple
29:58
too because steve wozniak was the
30:00
customer support and when anything went
30:01
wrong they wanted it back to find out
30:02
what was going on wrong so they
30:04
destroyed them afterwards so um just on
30:07
robots yeah just going back to robots
30:09
very briefly
30:10
um did you know that samsung has a robot
30:13
shaped like a bottom
30:16
and it's i have seen it it repeatedly
30:17
sits on phones to test them
30:27
when someone sits on their phone you can
30:28
see videos of it working and it's just
30:31
it will be cheaper to hire someone to do
30:33
that rather than spend millions
30:34
developing an artificial last well this
30:37
is progress it's so funny no i haven't
30:39
seen that that's amazing what i've seen
30:41
is um what i thought you were talking
30:43
about was someone has you know how like
30:45
uh in video games if you're playing a
30:47
car racing game you can now obviously
30:49
buy the wheel you could have years ago
30:51
or you buy a gun to shoot at the screen
30:52
right there's a there's one which is for
30:54
trainee doctors which is for giving
30:57
rectal exams and it's just a pair of
30:59
butt cheeks that you're meant to put
31:01
your hand inside to simulate and on the
31:03
screen you can see the patient's room
31:05
and the patient's reaction that's really
31:07
cool if you don't mind showing up on
31:09
your like amazon history
31:11
that's for work i swear
31:13
yeah i wonder if you have to show your
31:15
medical id before they actually sell it
31:17
to you yeah just to prove
31:19
um i was looking into how uh certain
31:22
people met what i wanted to look into
31:24
was the kind of tech giants and see how
31:26
because that's steve wozniak that's how
31:27
he met his wife i suddenly thought
31:29
zuckerberg bill gates steve jobs so
31:32
steve jobs met his wife when she came to
31:34
a talk that he was doing and at the talk
31:37
she was trying to get in but it was
31:38
completely packed up so she started
31:40
sitting in the aisles and then she got
31:41
told she couldn't see there she saw that
31:42
there was a row of empty seats in the
31:44
front row so she thought let's just go
31:46
sit there and they were obviously
31:47
reserved so she um she went she sat down
31:50
in these seats and then in comes steve
31:52
jobs to sit in the seat to get ready to
31:53
go up on stage so she sat right next to
31:55
him
31:56
and she said that she'd want a
31:58
competition to go out on a date with him
32:01
and he said oh really and um and they
32:04
kind of just got chatting a bit more and
32:06
at the end of the evening he was off to
32:07
go to a dinner and he thought you know
32:08
what i'd rather go to dinner with her so
32:10
he went back and found her and said uh
32:12
how about that competition date and
32:14
that's how they met and they they ended
32:16
up going out yeah um did you ever come
32:18
clean as to the whole look the
32:19
competition thing was a ruse by the way
32:22
we immediately divorced
32:23
this whole thing
32:25
um with bill gates this is how it
32:27
happened bill gates um was working with
32:29
his uh with with this lady called
32:32
melinda who became his wife and um he
32:35
basically she was at microsoft he
32:37
eventually built the courage up to ask
32:38
her out uh so he went up and he said
32:41
could we go out two weeks from this
32:44
coming saturday
32:46
not the most romantic
32:49
and she said what
32:51
so she said um like just you know why
32:54
don't you ask me closer to the day so it
32:55
seems a bit more spontaneous um
32:58
but then that night late that night he
33:00
called her and said how about late
33:01
tonight and she went ah now that's no
33:03
that's too soon
33:04
[Laughter]
33:06
just sort of say three days from now
33:08
that's nice so yeah so uh but then she
33:11
did go out on the date and they got
33:12
together yeah it's very nice hence bill
33:15
and melinda gates exactly there you go
33:18
um we should wrap up very soon because
33:19
we've been going on way too long does
33:21
anyone have anything before we wrap up
33:23
no i've got one last thing just very
33:24
quickly um steve wozniak is part of a uh
33:28
sports team
33:30
and he's part of the silicon valley
33:31
aftershocks
33:33
can you guys guess what that team is
33:35
what sport he's playing so it sounds
33:36
like an earthquake it does sound like an
33:38
earthquake but it has no
33:40
bearing on what the actual sport is
33:41
quidditch then
33:42
no apple bobbing for apples oh that
33:44
would be very cool but no it's a segway
33:47
polo team
33:50
yeah that's so silicon valley yeah i
33:54
thought my segue polo team you just
33:55
meant you had to subtly skip the
33:57
conversation
33:59
that you wanted to play
34:02
[Applause]

00:12
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:14
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:16
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:18
covent garden my name is dan schreiber
00:20
i'm sitting here with anna chazinski
00:22
james harkin and andy murray and once
00:24
again we have gathered around the
00:25
microphones with our four favorite facts
00:27
from the last seven days and in no
00:29
particular order here we go starting
00:31
with you andrew hunter murray my fact is
00:34
that babies practice their first words
00:36
before saying them out loud
00:38
which is very sweet i love that wait how
00:40
do we know
00:41
well uh this is from a study at the
00:43
university of washington where
00:44
scientists scanned babies brains and
00:47
observed what happened when they were
00:48
being spoken to
00:49
and bits of their brains light up
00:51
different parts of the brain light up
00:53
and some of the bits are associated just
00:54
with listening and taking in information
00:56
and other bits are associated with
00:58
actually planning the motor movements
00:59
that you need to say words
01:02
so even when they are listening they are
01:03
trying to figure out how to make that
01:05
sound basically so that's what it is it
01:08
suggests that they're figuring out how
01:09
to make sounds but don't they all
01:11
finally reach the same word is it all
01:13
mama no is it no no
01:17
george orwell's first word was
01:18
supposedly beastly
01:20
yeah
01:22
good guess is more about his mother than
01:24
about him
01:25
considering you're at animal farm though
01:26
that's true um dada is the most common
01:29
15 percent of babies apparently
01:33
followed by daddy 13
01:35
mama 10
01:36
dad 10
01:38
mummy eight
01:39
mum seven percent
01:41
cat two percent dog one percent
01:45
i found a survey from 2014 where more
01:47
than one in eight parents claimed their
01:49
child's first word was tablet as in a
01:51
tablet computer yeah although this was a
01:53
technology firm who make device
01:55
protection cases
01:57
uh who sponsored the research yeah and
01:59
it also found that babies break tablets
02:00
a lot so they sponsored the research and
02:02
by coincidence that's the word
02:07
babies i think might be a lot cleverer
02:08
than we give them credit for um there
02:10
was a study done where they tested
02:12
whether hundred hour old babies so a
02:15
bunch of babies who are only a few days
02:16
old could count and they'd show them a
02:20
series of images with a certain number
02:22
of shapes on them so they'd show them
02:24
like a bunch of circles and one picture
02:26
would have three circles in it one
02:27
picture would have four circles one
02:28
would have five circles etc and then at
02:30
the same time they would play them
02:32
recordings with a certain number of like
02:34
bleeps on them right and when they
02:35
played a recording of let's say three
02:37
bleeps then the babies would look
02:39
towards the picture with three circles
02:42
on it and it was like they were
02:43
connecting the
02:44
you know they were counting the number
02:46
of bleeps and then associating it with
02:47
the vision isn't that incredible like
02:49
four days old they can count up to 27
02:52
ipads though
02:53
[Laughter]
02:55
um i read anything about swearing in
02:57
children and it took children from one
02:58
to twelve and um it just measured a host
03:01
of different swear words so how
03:02
frequently they use them and so for one
03:04
and two year olds the most frequent
03:06
swear word that they use is poopy is
03:08
this pre-curfew because if so i don't
03:09
think we're allowed to say that
03:13
um that falls off very rapidly by the
03:14
age of seven or eight okay jerk is big
03:18
around for three and four year olds then
03:19
tails off it has a huge dip in the graph
03:21
do you know that uh newborn babies
03:23
recognize the theme song from their
03:24
mum's favorite soap opera
03:26
do they they tested this uh an old study
03:28
in 1988 um yeah they tested it they also
03:31
tested them on made-up words
03:33
oh yeah so they made up a word like i
03:36
don't know titu or something and they
03:37
played it to them more than 25 000 times
03:40
while the mother was pregnant oh my god
03:43
and after birth unsurprisingly the baby
03:45
recognized the word
03:46
and its variations and other babies
03:48
didn't recognize it have you heard about
03:49
the babies the way babies grip newborn
03:52
babies they're the strength of their
03:53
grip um they can grip strongly enough to
03:55
support their own weight wow yeah and i
03:57
they think that this is a hangover from
03:59
i was just gonna say from being a chimp
04:01
and having to pull yourself up the hairs
04:02
or something so does that mean if you
04:04
put your finger in a ch in a baby's hand
04:07
and they grab hold of it you could lift
04:09
it up yeah do you know how i know that
04:11
with such confidence in 1891 back in the
04:14
good old days
04:15
the researcher dangled 60 newborns from
04:17
a walking stick
04:19
to see how long they could last
04:23
wow and the the longest lasted two
04:26
minutes 35 right and the short has
04:29
lasted 10 seconds
04:31
2 minutes 35 yeah
04:33
how long was this stick that he could
04:35
get the 16 infants dangling
04:39
60 60. 60. 60. there must be one at a
04:43
time i think it was sadly i think it was
04:45
one at a time right another thing babies
04:47
can do which i think is quite exciting
04:49
is they have they seem to have an innate
04:51
awareness of organs and how bodies work
04:54
so there was a study done where um there
04:56
were like moving toys given to a bunch
04:59
of toddlers
05:00
and then they split the dolls in half
05:03
and they showed them to the babies and
05:04
they made it so the doors were
05:05
completely hollow on the inside and the
05:07
babies were really confused so when they
05:08
split a dollar in half and there was
05:09
nothing on the inside the babies would
05:11
like show obvious signs of bewilderment
05:13
and like look inside properly as if to
05:15
say where the hell are his organs it's
05:17
alive i don't think that shows detailed
05:19
knowledge
05:21
i wouldn't trust them to do an operation
05:23
i'd still go for doctor a
05:26
the adult doctor
05:28
dr b the baby in the coat yeah
05:32
do you know that um
05:34
babies can't taste salt until they're
05:36
four months old um they can also taste
05:38
with their cheeks which we can't do
05:41
it's not cool if they could just hold
05:42
the thing
05:44
oh that is delicious
05:46
it needs more basil
05:48
more salt i mean i don't know actually
05:51
it has to be the inside of their cheeks
05:53
sadly but even so quite cool taste buds
05:56
all over their cheeks they've got
05:56
tastebuds on their cheeks that's very
05:58
cool that'd be really fun it's a weird
05:59
idea being able to taste with your
06:00
cheeks we could once do it
06:02
so i was reading a story in um the
06:05
british newspaper archive in the
06:08
daily gazette for middlesbrough in 1887
06:11
and a man's written this letter into the
06:13
newspaper
06:14
this man got on a train in 1887 a man in
06:18
his early twenties got on the train
06:20
carriage with him and was holding a baby
06:22
even though the man looked very young to
06:24
be engaged in such a manner so you know
06:26
early twenties bit young to have a baby
06:28
um the baby started crying and the man
06:29
pinched the baby quite hard and it
06:31
started crying a lot more um and so a
06:34
couple of women nearby said oh if you do
06:36
if you keep doing that you shouldn't do
06:37
that to a baby if you keep doing that
06:38
we're gonna call security and the young
06:41
man said i'll do what i like and taking
06:43
the baby by its long robe began to swing
06:45
it around and around so that its head
06:47
came into contact with the door frame
06:49
after each revolution and the shrieking
06:51
became terrific and then bang the train
06:53
stops the man gets out leaving on the
06:55
sea a broken yankee rubber baby which is
06:57
a prank doll they used to have in the
07:00
1880s that apparently young men would
07:02
take on the trains in order to terrify
07:04
the living [ __ ] out of everyone else
07:07
i think you mean the living poopy
07:10
isn't that weird it sounded like it was
07:11
going to be a really traumatic story
07:13
and then it was just a doll though andy
07:15
it's still awful though it's still
07:17
traumatic i haven't recovered from the
07:18
awfulness before
07:20
which i guess is the whole point of the
07:21
prank yeah what a good prank that it's
07:24
still affecting people even just hearing
07:27
about it 30 years later i'm upset
07:30
bastard on this right man should be so
07:32
happy my god he must be happy in his
07:34
grave right now isn't that glad he's
07:36
dead
07:38
[Music]
07:42
okay time for fact number two and that
07:44
is cecinski
07:45
my fact is the first pair of nike
07:48
trainers were made in a waffle iron
07:50
who's gonna quibble with my
07:51
pronunciation of nike nobody nobody no
07:53
ma'am nobody and i reckon i reckon
07:56
you're asking for a reason right you i
07:58
mean technically i guess we should say
07:59
nikkei because that's how you pronounce
08:01
it ancient greek well that's how you
08:02
pronounce the name
08:03
you definitely shouldn't say no we have
08:05
got some very exciting news two people
08:08
wrote to the founder the co-founder of
08:10
nike to ask and he wrote back to them
08:12
it's nike uh they wrote to philip knight
08:14
uh he's the chairman and i believe he's
08:16
the co-founder he should change his name
08:18
uh philip knight tonight a nike yeah i
08:22
should change it to 90.
08:26
but he they sent him and they wrote the
08:28
phonetic pronunciation of both he just
08:30
all he did was just circle and send it
08:32
back to them and he circled ny hyphen
08:35
key as in a key opening a door so it's
08:37
nike it was named nike was named by the
08:39
first ever nike employee who was called
08:41
jeff johnson um but it means victory in
08:44
greek which you would pronounce in
08:46
ancient greek kneecare
08:48
so i mean maybe they're wrong about the
08:50
pronunciation of their own brand but
08:52
nike was the goddess or nikkei it was
08:54
the goddess of victory yeah but i read
08:57
that the thing she did was to fly around
08:58
the battlefield lifting people up and
09:00
bestowing honours on them and things
09:01
like that so she wouldn't ever have
09:02
needed shoes
09:04
no way
09:06
um sorry waffle iron yeah sorry so we
09:08
should go back to the uh so the first
09:09
row of nike trainers um were made by
09:12
bill bowerman who was the nike
09:13
co-founder and he'd worked for this
09:14
company making shoes um for a few years
09:17
but in 1971 they released the first line
09:20
of like completely nike trainers with
09:24
the nike label on them and the way he
09:25
designed them was so they had a special
09:27
way of gripping the ground he wanted to
09:28
design like a better pair of running
09:30
shoes revolutionized running shoes that
09:31
could work on a whole bunch of surfaces
09:33
and design them with better grip but not
09:35
with like spikes like football spikes
09:36
which would dig into the ground and he
09:39
was discussing this conundrum like how
09:41
to develop trainers with good grip with
09:43
his wife over breakfast and she got some
09:46
waffles out of the oven and she was
09:48
brainstorming at the time and saying why
09:49
didn't you try attaching some bits of my
09:51
jewelry or something to the bottom of
09:52
shoes and seeing if that works or
09:53
something like that he was like yeah you
09:55
know that waffle you're holding what if
09:57
we turned that upside down and put it on
09:59
the bottom of a trainer and then he
10:01
disappeared um went back to his lab got
10:04
two cans of like this liquid plastic
10:06
that you use to make trainers came back
10:08
seized the waffle iron off his wife
10:10
poured the liquid plastic into the
10:11
waffle iron and there was born the first
10:14
soul of uh nike trainers which is that
10:16
waffle soul so i i think this resurfaced
10:19
recently because they found the waffle
10:21
iron yeah they did
10:23
and i i read that when they found this
10:25
old waffle line which had just been in a
10:26
rubbish tip at the back of the the
10:28
founder's garden for ages and ages wow
10:30
do you know why it was in a rubbish tip
10:32
no it was because he so it wasn't even a
10:34
rubbish tip it was buried because bill
10:36
bauman in the place that he lived in
10:37
america it was like up a hill or
10:39
something and it was too far for um like
10:41
rubbish truck drivers to come and so
10:44
he'd just bury it all in the garden and
10:46
his granddaughter or daughter i think
10:47
was his daughter wasn't it was just like
10:49
found this a few years ago it was like
10:50
there's this huge pile of stuff buried
10:52
in our garden just rubbish he didn't
10:54
live on a hill at first he just kept on
10:56
burying all of his household waste and
10:57
eventually he did
10:59
but when they discovered this thing i i
11:01
read this line um
11:03
it truly is the headwaters of our
11:05
innovation nike historian scott reem
11:07
said from a historian's standpoint it's
11:10
like finding the titanic
11:12
which it's not
11:15
and also historians do kind of like the
11:17
titanic as well don't they yeah
11:20
it's not like the history equivalent of
11:22
finding the titanic because the titanic
11:24
is the history equivalent of the fight
11:26
but
11:27
but nike has a um nike has a historian
11:30
yeah that makes sense it must it must be
11:32
a really easy job up until the mid 20th
11:34
century
11:37
1875 still nothing
11:40
i don't know like 400 bc goddess of
11:43
victory 1912 titanic sinks don't really
11:46
give a [ __ ] about that
11:49
from a historian's point of view this
11:51
would be like finding the first ever
11:53
nike shoe
11:56
the waffle line that was used to make
11:57
this first pair of trainers had been in
11:58
use in the barramundi family since 1936.
12:01
i thought it was quite impressive well
12:02
they must be pissed off when he broke it
12:04
yeah it's so casual just ruining it
12:07
did he he broke it it was not usable
12:09
after that
12:10
yeah i think it tasted of like hot
12:12
plastic
12:12
[Laughter]
12:14
um do you know where waffles come from
12:16
the they're actually derived from
12:18
religious wafers
12:19
oh used for communion yeah as well as
12:22
just to make food but uh that you used
12:24
to have wafer irons which in french were
12:26
called moola ahubli
12:28
and they had biblical scenes on them
12:30
that was the first waffle design and
12:32
communion wafers normally had a picture
12:34
of jesus and his crucifixion on them
12:35
because they were for holy use
12:37
interesting thing about communion wafers
12:39
is catholics at least do this um you
12:42
would go up and they would put the
12:44
wafer directly into your mouth and the
12:46
reason that they did that is to stop
12:47
people from stealing them because people
12:49
used to get them in their hands pretend
12:50
to put them in their mouths and then
12:52
take them home and they would do like
12:54
magic incantations with them or sprinkle
12:57
them on the crops to make them grow
12:58
better or something pour golden syrup
13:00
and bacon over them and enjoy canadian
13:02
breakfast
13:04
well speaking of untrustworthiness which
13:06
i guess that speaks to wafers which are
13:09
people who sold waffles um or wafers in
13:12
the 16th 17th century were apparently
13:13
notoriously untrustworthy so they were
13:16
described in the literature at the time
13:17
as designing persons thieves etc who
13:20
took up wafering as a cloak for
13:21
dishonest practices and they appear in
13:23
various literature
13:25
in the 15th 16th centuries like chaucer
13:27
as typically bad people and they had to
13:30
be abolished in 1826 the practice of
13:33
being a wafer
13:34
because they were so untrustworthy also
13:36
i like this quote i can't remember where
13:38
i read this um in some history magazine
13:40
but it was charles ix who enacted the
13:42
first ever waffle legislation in 1560.
13:45
so as well as being untrustworthy i
13:47
think they were quite violent wafers or
13:49
oublies as they were as you said they
13:51
were called in france and they kept on
13:53
getting into fights with each other when
13:54
they were selling too close to one
13:55
another so the first waffle legislation
13:57
was to say exactly how much space there
13:59
had to be between two wafer sellers
14:01
because otherwise they couldn't be
14:02
trusted not to beat the crap out of each
14:04
other that's why they had a picture of
14:06
the crucifixion on them it was jesus
14:07
saying you have to be this far apart
14:08
guys
14:10
no fighting
14:10
[Laughter]
14:12
um you were saying about how waffle guys
14:14
were untrustworthy well these days they
14:17
are quite trustworthy uh the waffle
14:19
house in america um they are famous for
14:22
staying open no matter what if there's a
14:23
disaster they'll stay open and they they
14:25
pride themselves on you always be able
14:27
to go there and get a waffle if there's
14:29
a problem
14:30
and that means that the federal
14:32
emergency management agency uh if ever
14:35
they see that a waffle house is closed
14:37
they know that that's the kind of place
14:38
they need to go and give aid to because
14:40
that must be the worst if the waffle
14:42
house closed then it must be pretty no
14:43
way then that's the apocalypse yeah
14:45
that's amazing so they always so when
14:47
disaster strikes they still when
14:49
disaster strikes if there's loads of
14:51
different counties that are obviously
14:52
all kind of in trouble yeah if the
14:54
waffle house is closed in one of them
14:55
they'll go wow it's quite a good tip
14:57
though actually if you own a waffle
14:59
house in a disaster struck area to close
15:01
it and that's going to bring help yeah
15:03
or if you're the mayor of a disaster
15:05
shark area blow up the waffle house
15:07
yes yeah
15:09
also a good tip
15:11
there are 60 000 nikes um which fell off
15:14
a ship and they are followed by um
15:18
meteorologists and oceanographers to see
15:20
with the um the currents of the oceans
15:23
in the same way that those rubber ducks
15:25
were that time yeah do they say things
15:26
like we've been running some experiments
15:30
no
15:32
i would have thought they would say that
15:33
all the time
15:35
i would love it if you went into that
15:37
office you said that and it was the
15:39
first time they heard that
15:41
and you were the hero of the office
15:43
andy is amazing hi i'm here for my
15:46
training are there any trainers about
15:50
i don't want to waffle on that's too far
15:53
that's too far they won't get that one
15:56
the card of the nike historian's pissing
15:58
himself
16:03
these shoes that fell off the ship
16:05
they're still wearable if you find them
16:07
on a beach you can still wear them and
16:09
which means that people collect them and
16:11
they have impromptu swap meets where
16:14
people who have two lefts like swap one
16:16
right or if they have two different
16:18
sizes they try and swap them that's
16:20
amazing that is really incredible
16:22
there's a charity called because
16:23
international which has developed a shoe
16:25
that grows with your foot um so that
16:27
because it's a one a major problem in
16:28
developing countries is that people
16:30
can't afford shoes and so they're
16:31
barefoot all the time they grow out
16:32
their shoes and it can grow up to seven
16:34
sizes i think um so it grows by sort of
16:36
curving outwards as your foot grows so
16:38
as a kid you can have it when you're you
16:40
know
16:41
and still have it when you're 12. isn't
16:42
that so cool that is cool so there's a
16:45
theory that shoes emerged 40 000 years
16:47
ago which is way earlier than our
16:50
original estimate we thought that we'd
16:51
had them for maybe five or ten thousand
16:52
years okay but there's a scientist from
16:54
washington university called eric
16:56
trinkus and he found the time in history
16:59
where toe bones began to get smaller
17:01
because for most of our history we've
17:03
had really really big toe bones because
17:05
we were doing lots of walking and
17:06
climbing and carrying things around but
17:08
then forty thousand years ago we kept
17:10
our big leg bones they stayed the same
17:12
size but our toe bones started we all
17:13
used to have like big clown feet
17:16
yes
17:17
let's say that yeah
17:19
and he was trying to work out what would
17:20
remove stress on toes but not on legs
17:23
and he says that's shoes yeah but they
17:25
couldn't just make bigger shoes
17:28
to fit our tailbones in i'm not sure how
17:30
much our toes shrank but
17:32
in my imagination they've shrunk quite a
17:34
lot
17:36
it's conundrum what are we going to do
17:38
our feet won't fit into these tiny shoes
17:39
we keep making
17:41
i guess we'll just have to wait for our
17:42
feet to evolve into smaller feet
17:49
okay time for fact number three and that
17:51
is my fact my fact is rats dream of
17:54
places they want to visit
17:56
hmm well like the taj mahal yeah
18:00
maybe if they if they basically whenever
18:02
a rat uh gets shown something while
18:04
they're conscious they found this in
18:06
mazes um and they'd see somewhere that
18:08
they couldn't go to
18:10
then when they went for a nap
18:11
rats have naps
18:14
scientists found that they were dreaming
18:15
about what it'd be like to actually get
18:16
into that place and then get the thing
18:18
that they think might be in there so
18:20
they start dreaming about all these
18:21
unattained places that they'd like to
18:23
visit because either they've seen a bit
18:25
of cheese in it or yeah and we know that
18:27
by because they look at inside their
18:29
brains which neurons are firing when
18:31
they go around the maze when they're
18:32
awake don't they and then when they fall
18:33
asleep you look at the same neurons are
18:35
firing so they're obviously reliving
18:37
going around the maze and it's really
18:38
sad that we've decided that means the
18:40
only place a rat wants to visit above
18:42
and beyond anything else is the bit of
18:43
food in the maze that we planted there
18:46
in the experiment they did yesterday the
18:47
interesting thing here is that we can
18:49
tell what rats are dreaming about it's
18:50
extraordinary isn't it from what i've
18:52
read and i
18:54
do find it very hard to break through
18:56
scientific jargon sometimes but it
18:58
sounds like as anna was saying they look
19:00
at these neurons that are firing off and
19:01
they can see that they're making similar
19:03
connections um i think there was a tiny
19:05
thing about their actual like physical
19:07
movements of their body as well kind of
19:09
suggesting i'm going left i'm going
19:10
right i think but i i might be wrong
19:13
about that
19:14
um 80 of dreams are about normal things
19:17
like doing the washing up or being at
19:18
work yeah that makes sense
19:20
100 of mine
19:24
but then again um 5.2 percent of men
19:27
have kissed a monster in their dreams uh
19:30
3.4 have had foreplay with an animal
19:33
and 1.7 have had sex with an object
19:36
plant a rock
19:39
an object
19:41
because plants and rocks aren't objects
19:44
kiss the monster do you think a monster
19:46
as in like a mermaid or a
19:49
mermaid a monster i i think it'd be
19:51
classified as a monster yeah okay a
19:53
monster truck would come under objects
19:57
what about some monster munch object
20:00
there's actually a term for people who
20:03
study dreams in science and it's o
20:04
neurology and it's not what the
20:06
interpretation is it's why we dream and
20:08
and so it's not you know if your teeth
20:10
fall out you're stressed that kind of
20:13
stuff there's a really good book by
20:14
richard wiseman called night school
20:16
which has a lot of stuff about dreaming
20:18
it says the guy who came up with the
20:19
term rapid eye movement uh i think his
20:21
name was aserinsky or aserinki
20:24
he nearly called it jerky eye movement
20:26
oh yeah which is quite a nice thing but
20:28
then i had negative connotations the
20:30
word jerk because a lot of three and
20:31
four-year-olds were using it
20:36
yeah but it could have been called that
20:37
so humans get erections in dreams male
20:40
male ones that is male humans i think uh
20:43
and it's during rem sleep which is
20:46
usually where dreams happen a lot of
20:48
other animals uh rats as well they get
20:50
them uh get erections during rem sleep
20:52
but apparently the armadillo is the only
20:55
animal to get erections in non-rem sleep
20:58
wow wow
21:00
what
21:01
it's just a fact that is so weird it's a
21:03
great fact yeah is it embarrassing for a
21:05
rat when it gets an erection do you
21:07
think the rat yeah because it's never
21:08
wearing a jacket so you can't cover it
21:10
up
21:13
i always wonder why you always came into
21:14
work in a jacket i think
21:17
summer here and andy has
21:19
got this long trench coat
21:23
i've got another jacket under this one
21:24
[Laughter]
21:27
you know rats feel regret after they
21:29
make a poor choice in life do they yep
21:32
they did an experiment where they gave
21:34
them the chance to eat food now after
21:36
waiting for a bit or just move on to the
21:38
next thing and if they chose to move on
21:40
then the next food offering was worse
21:43
and they they paused and they looked at
21:45
the good reward that they now couldn't
21:46
have and then later on they changed
21:48
their decision when they were run
21:49
through it again
21:50
so
21:51
they think that that is them showing
21:52
regret and they didn't do it when they
21:54
encounter bad food without having chosen
21:56
accidentally the bad food we do seem to
21:58
anthropomorphize rats a lot or science
22:01
does at the moment like there are a lot
22:02
of studies that come out saying yeah
22:04
rats feel regret there's one that claims
22:06
rats feel empathy which is also very
22:08
plausible so this study got two rats to
22:10
live together for two weeks or something
22:12
so they bonded learn to be mates
22:14
and then researchers locked one of them
22:16
in a cage which could only be opened by
22:18
the other rat from the outside and they
22:20
found that the other rat would always
22:22
open the cage even when there was no
22:23
apparent benefit for the other rat so
22:25
even if opening the cage released the
22:27
rat into a separate room so there wasn't
22:29
even the social advantage of having that
22:31
rat hang out with you now the rat would
22:32
still go and open the cage first thing i
22:34
think they even put food in there and
22:35
the rat would open the cage before it
22:36
went and ate the food because they
22:37
wanted to free it because
22:39
apparently that's what we've decided oh
22:41
that's nice isn't it that's good they
22:43
also um they also um they piss on food
22:46
that they want to mark as edible
22:48
nothing wrong with that
22:50
have you seen the fridge recently in the
22:52
office
22:53
i think they're marking it as formally
22:55
edible really
22:57
you had some cake at my last birthday
22:58
didn't you
23:01
everyone complained but it was edible
23:02
cake
23:04
very moist this cake
23:08
[Laughter]
23:11
is it irony that in the act of
23:13
signposting something that's edible you
23:14
make it no longer editable like is that
23:16
that's like a catch-22 isn't it
23:19
no one came to my following birthday
23:22
um so on rats brains uh they've we've
23:26
managed to get rats to communicate with
23:28
each other mentally across oceans so
23:32
scientists again experimenting on rats
23:34
willy-nilly to their heart's content but
23:36
they've connected the brains of a pair
23:37
of rats and uh so one rack can be in the
23:40
u.s one right can be in britain and
23:42
they've connected their brains up so
23:44
they can share sensory information with
23:45
each other and they've trained the rats
23:48
so that if they press a lever in a
23:50
certain box that they're in then they'll
23:51
get some food but they've trained them
23:53
to communicate mentally with each other
23:55
so um they'll
23:57
so let's say there's the rat in the u.s
23:59
has got a lever but the rat in the uk
24:01
has not got a lever and the rat in the
24:03
uk will send a sensory signal to the rat
24:05
in the u.s saying press that lever now
24:07
and we'll both get food and then the rat
24:09
in the u.s presses the lever based on
24:11
signals it's receiving in its brain from
24:13
the rat in the uk and then they both get
24:15
the food reward isn't that insane and
24:17
the scientists who did this one of the
24:18
scientists said um i prefer of nothing
24:21
this was written up on in new scientists
24:22
or something and the scientists in
24:24
charge said i don't think there's any
24:26
risk of super smart rats from this i'm
24:28
not worried about an imminent invasion
24:29
of rat multi-boards
24:32
[Laughter]
24:43
okay time for our final fact of the show
24:46
and that is james okay my fact this week
24:48
is that humans used milk as paint for 40
24:52
000 years before anyone thought to drink
24:55
it
24:57
it's amazing
24:59
uh yeah so very basically um the first
25:02
use of milk based paints is about 49 000
25:06
years ago uh and the first use of milk
25:10
as a drink as in the first time humans
25:12
could even digest cow's milk was around
25:14
seven or eight thousand years ago that's
25:16
so weird i like the idea that 40 000
25:18
years from now somebody will be doing a
25:20
podcast saying did you know that uh
25:22
humans used to use paint as paint for
25:25
thousands of years before they worked
25:27
out we could drink it
25:28
that's true
25:30
it's very optimistic for the medium of
25:32
podcast
25:34
it's a young medium
25:37
there is a woman who paints with milk at
25:38
the moment she's called millie brown she
25:40
drinks colored milk and then she
25:41
regurgitates it onto canvas oh i read an
25:44
article about her and it said and i
25:46
quote she has mastered the art of
25:48
regurgitation right the art of
25:51
regurgitation all babies also are sort
25:54
of novices in the art of regurgitation
25:55
but she has got it down
25:58
um there are a few artists who use
25:59
bodily um fluids for
26:02
for painting
26:04
um so one is
26:05
rose lynn fisher who made a series of
26:08
landscapes using a hundred different
26:10
varieties of tia varieties yeah so i
26:13
think the way she sees it is you could
26:14
have a really really upset tear or you
26:17
could have a cutting onions tear or 98
26:20
other types of tea that's why you fall
26:22
down isn't it that's the only two
26:23
examples she ever has to use before
26:25
someone interrupts and go oh we get the
26:26
idea do you think phew because i did not
26:28
have a third
26:31
um oh there are loads
26:33
okay we don't need to go through the
26:34
various different ways in which you cry
26:36
andy
26:38
when anna says hurtful things like that
26:41
no one eats his urine cake
26:46
here's something
26:47
before world war ii
26:50
skimmed milk was just thrown away
26:53
it was just discarded nobody drank
26:54
skimmed milk it was discarded it was fed
26:56
to pigs um because because you cream off
26:59
the top stuff yeah so much of it was
27:01
just poured into rivers
27:03
wow yeah
27:04
it was only sold when marketers realized
27:06
because a lot of it's creamed off to
27:07
make butter the top bit um and loads of
27:09
it was just chucked away and then
27:11
marketers realized a that people were
27:13
getting really annoyed saying this
27:14
stream is full of discarded milk
27:16
and secondly they realized it could be
27:18
marketed as a weight loss device wow
27:20
that's really interesting um another
27:22
thing that they did during the war with
27:24
milk was make plastic out of it
27:27
you can the casein casein is a protein
27:31
which you get in milk
27:33
and that can be somehow by adding acid
27:36
can be turned into a very brittle but
27:38
still usable plastic and apparently they
27:40
used it even for aeroplanes i read it
27:42
was to glue them together that was it
27:43
yeah okay oh my god i don't trust that
27:45
really the wings are glued on with milk
27:48
yeah yeah basically the wings are glued
27:50
on at all
27:52
i'm definitely not getting it i've made
27:53
a model plane haven't you yeah just
27:55
think bigger
27:58
sink cuthbert chopped his own leg off in
28:00
remorse after speaking angrily to his
28:02
parents
28:03
and it was then repaired with a cast
28:05
made of milk
28:07
the story of saint cuthbert i just want
28:09
to say this there is a really fantastic
28:10
book called milk a local and global
28:12
history by deborah valenzuela which is
28:14
where i got lots of my stuff from i
28:15
don't know it's really good if you like
28:17
milk it's an absolute rip-roaring treat
28:21
do you know what animal exclusively
28:23
drinks milk ooh
28:25
the only thing they ever drink yeah
28:27
dolphins yes
28:28
no yeah because they don't drink when
28:31
they're adults they don't drink the only
28:33
thing they drink is their mother's milk
28:35
so they all they've ever known is the
28:36
sweet taste of milk
28:38
i was reading something about dolphins
28:40
today um
28:41
it was someone's done some research on
28:43
dolphin vaginas
28:45
and to see some pervert
28:48
let's hastily come up with a reason why
28:49
they're
28:50
in the lab with squeaky
28:54
squeaky
28:56
he certainly was after that experiment
29:01
um anyway part of that um that article
29:04
one of the things they said is that if a
29:06
female dolphin doesn't want to have sex
29:09
then one of the ways that she does it is
29:11
by putting her vagina out of the water
29:13
so the male can't get out
29:18
presumably some people have gone
29:21
dolphins watching they've just spotted a
29:24
lot of females poking vaginas out of the
29:26
water
29:27
it's not exactly jars with
29:29
something
29:30
it's not exactly flippery either
29:34
i think it's the same person who did the
29:36
famous work on
29:38
duck vaginas um duck penises how they
29:40
don't kind of fit together
29:42
right yeah you got just sort of vagina
29:44
scientists yeah
29:46
amazing um dolphin milk is almost 50 fat
29:49
that's it and cow's milk is four percent
29:50
by way of comparison so it is really
29:52
really thick and it's isn't we've said i
29:54
think before it's like toothpaste it's
29:55
so thick also it's really hard for baby
29:58
dolphins to
29:59
uh drink
30:00
while they are
30:02
in fluid themselves they can roll their
30:04
tongues up so they're like straws and
30:06
their tongues form this watertight seal
30:08
which keeps the milk in and keeps salt
30:10
water out so they don't drink any of the
30:12
salt water so it has to be you know
30:14
fluid transfer within another liquid
30:16
it's very very very difficult right
30:18
another milk that used to be very
30:20
popular is ass milk
30:22
in the 18th century uh donkey milk you
30:25
mean
30:26
yeah yeah just checking
30:28
that that's rude
30:29
[Laughter]
30:31
call it poopy milk please
30:33
ass milk was so popular in the 18th
30:35
century that um there was even a mrs
30:38
dawkins of bolsover street who was the
30:40
ass milk provider for beat
30:45
i'm just wondering if i can change the
30:46
job title
30:49
just a donkey milk actually
30:52
we've had the uh the name label printed
30:54
now
30:57
she was the ass milk salesperson to the
30:59
royal family
31:03
um wow they had because it was it
31:04
expensive or was it it was expensive it
31:06
was used as like a cure all for anything
31:08
that was wrong with you you would take
31:10
ass milk
31:11
it was even used as a face wash and to
31:13
shine shoes
31:15
so it's used for everything yeah that's
31:18
amazing okay was it expensive because
31:20
donkeys are fewer than cows that is true
31:23
and also they produce a lot less milk so
31:25
in ancient greek times
31:27
one remedy for women who had trouble
31:29
conceiving was to pour milk into their
31:30
vagina oh yeah did it work
31:33
i don't think so no
31:35
why what was the logic behind that did
31:36
they have magic
31:38
was there
31:39
did anyone ask for logic back then they
31:41
just said that
31:42
well they supposedly invented logic
31:44
didn't know the ancient greeks okay i
31:45
don't think well it sounds like they had
31:46
to because eventually
31:48
questions started being asked
31:50
i'm sorry why are we putting the milk in
31:51
my vagina
31:53
what do you mean why
31:54
[Laughter]
31:56
so you guys could try producing milk and
31:59
i would like one of you to do this okay
32:01
so you because you obviously have the um
32:04
the glands which allow you to produce
32:05
milk but you just don't have enough
32:06
prolactin but apparently if men massage
32:08
their nipples you can stimulate um you
32:11
can get a spike of prolactin which means
32:13
that you're able to produce milk from
32:15
your nipples um how long do you have to
32:16
massage for
32:17
i'll just try it and tell me oh okay i
32:19
know because i don't know i've been
32:21
unwittingly preparing for this
32:22
experiment for years
32:25
that's why i've got the holes in my
32:26
raincoat
32:29
[Applause]
32:33
okay that's it that's all of our facts
32:35

00:14
uh hello
00:18
and
00:19
welcome to another episode of no such
00:22
thing as a fish this week coming to you
00:24
from the literary arena in the latitude
00:28
festival my name is dan schreiber i'm
00:30
sitting here with three other qilbs it's
00:31
anna chazinski andy murray and james
00:34
harkin and once again we've gathered
00:36
around the microphones with our four
00:37
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:39
and in a particular order here we go
00:42
and we're going to start with my fact
00:43
this week my fact this week is that the
00:46
world record for horse long jump is
00:49
shorter than the world record for human
00:51
long jump
00:54
that just can't even be true that just
00:56
is so obviously not true it's
00:57
unbelievable no it's it's absolutely
00:59
true but but here's the weird thing uh
01:01
horse long jump did anyone know that
01:03
existed
01:04
it was an olympic sport for one year i
01:07
have a question about the horse long
01:08
jump yeah did they have to do it with a
01:09
human on their back yes well then of
01:12
course they're gonna like if you put a
01:13
if you put a horse on a humans
01:16
that's not a fair comparison though you
01:18
need to put so it'd be like strapping a
01:20
child to your back maybe or okay
01:23
which wouldn't be allowed i guess no but
01:25
listen horses okay how many how many
01:26
people here just by show of hands are
01:28
surprised that humans can jump further
01:30
than horses
01:31
yeah pretty much everyone yeah and when
01:33
you say surprised none of them believe
01:35
you
01:36
okay so this is absolutely true you can
01:38
go online to uh wikipedia
01:43
so this was in the 1900s
01:45
your niche sources for these things
01:48
so 1900 at the olympics they did the
01:50
horse trump uh
01:52
the the guy riding the horse was called
01:54
constant van lang hendonk
01:56
and his horse was called extra dry and
01:59
uh he jumped as far as he jumped about
02:02
six meters and that's not actually the
02:04
horse record so that was just their
02:06
first ever attempt at the olympics
02:08
everyone said let's not do that again
02:09
let's move on let's never speak about
02:11
this but the world record as it stands
02:12
was set in 1975 by a horse the horse uh
02:16
was called something and what was it
02:18
called
02:19
something the horse was actually called
02:21
something that was the actual name of
02:22
the horse uh by mr andre ferreira and
02:25
they jumped 8.4 meters so that's the
02:27
horse record the human record is 8.95
02:31
meters oh yeah and that was set in 1991
02:34
by a guy called mike powell it's still
02:35
holding to this day as the longest human
02:38
jump what about heights can they jump
02:40
can we jump higher than horses or can
02:41
they jump worse than us
02:43
our horses can go higher
02:45
well i've looked it up
02:48
oh really and there is an official high
02:50
jump record for horses and it's two
02:52
meters 47 and the official high jump
02:55
record for humans is two meters 45.
02:59
so they can beat us by two centimeters
03:01
wow but do they know that we're asking
03:04
them to jump really high yeah there's
03:06
the problem there's a big fence in the
03:07
way that gives a bit of a clue yeah
03:11
they just don't have the like
03:12
competitive urge you know they don't
03:14
know that they need to win that's true
03:16
that we do but the thing is with human
03:18
high jump is it there was a massive
03:20
difference was that when dick fosbery
03:21
came in and did his fosbe flop which is
03:23
going over backwards uh and until then
03:26
um the record was a certain amount and
03:28
it went massively up in a really short
03:30
amount of time what's interesting with
03:31
him is he was the in the america he won
03:34
gold in the um olympics in 1968 but by
03:38
1970 he wasn't even in the olympic team
03:40
anymore because everyone else had seen
03:42
his tactic and gone that's amazing and
03:44
he wasn't even that good a high jumper
03:46
really it's just the technique yeah just
03:48
the technique that was the only thing
03:49
that did it he wasn't even that good so
03:51
long john was almost the opposite right
03:53
because the long jump record until it
03:55
was broken by mike powell in 1991 was
03:57
held for i think a record length of time
03:59
in the olympics so it was broken in 1968
04:02
by robert beaumont and he just did this
04:05
incredible long jump so the record up
04:07
until then had been 21 feet and three
04:09
quarters of an inch and then in 1968 he
04:12
jumped 29 feet and 2.5 inches and he
04:16
jumped so far that they couldn't record
04:18
it properly because they didn't have the
04:19
equipment to stretch that far they
04:20
didn't have the equipment to stretch
04:22
them yeah how i don't know how advanced
04:23
the equipment has to be in order for you
04:25
to buy another one meter ruler to
04:29
so i think he jumped 29 feet i think
04:31
this with long jump says they reckon
04:33
some people reckon i don't know if it's
04:34
true some people reckon you could go
04:36
further if you do a somersault while
04:37
you're jumping that makes sense but
04:39
there's a rule that says you're not
04:40
allowed the rule is very clear it says
04:42
the jumper's head has to stay in a
04:44
superior position during the jump so
04:46
your head has to be always the highest
04:48
point but why has someone done it and
04:50
they've gone further well they said that
04:52
it was maybe due to it being dangerous
04:54
but the actual reason that they said
04:56
they jumped uh banned it when they did
04:57
is that nobody would jump a puddle in
04:59
this way
05:02
so apparently that's what we're doing
05:03
with the long jump it's just a way of
05:04
jumping a puddle good
05:06
and then big reasoning uh do you wanna
05:08
hear something else that happened at the
05:09
1900 olympics yes please uh men's
05:12
underwater swimming
05:14
so
05:15
start underwater and you just keep going
05:17
until you have to come up and you get a
05:19
point for every second you're under
05:20
water and you get a point for every
05:21
meter you swim underwater it was never
05:23
held again because of and i quote a lack
05:26
of spectator appeal
05:29
actually they're kind of bringing that
05:31
back you know because they've found that
05:33
swimming underwater is quicker than
05:35
swimming freestyle yeah it's called the
05:36
fish kick yeah yeah and it's the first
05:39
time they found a new uh swimming stroke
05:41
which is faster than freestyle the first
05:43
time it's happened in hundreds of years
05:47
literally moving your hips really really
05:49
far and you know moving your arms around
05:50
you look like a fish when you're doing
05:51
it yeah yeah um there's another so horse
05:54
long jump has been abandoned as a as an
05:58
olympic sport there's a list of other
06:00
olympic sports that we no longer do this
06:02
is my favorite one
06:03
solo synchronized swimming
06:07
and that was for three olympics
06:09
just one person in a pool with music
06:12
loving it and
06:13
eventually they thought it just not
06:15
working for us
06:17
amazing that's so
06:19
another thing they had at the 1900
06:21
olympics was so they were really into
06:22
horse events at the olympics i think and
06:25
they had the mail coach
06:27
event which was basically who can
06:29
deliver post the fastest and was so it
06:33
was a four-in-hand mail coach event and
06:35
it was four horses on a male coach and
06:37
you know you've got your letters and it
06:39
was a race and the guy who won it
06:41
actually was the guy who then went on to
06:43
found the orion express company weirdly
06:46
so he was the guy behind orion express
06:48
strange you'll have seen some of my work
06:49
in the olympics
06:51
that's very cool have you heard of uh
06:52
margaret abbott no she was an art
06:54
student from america right she won in
06:56
the 1900 olympics she won a nine-hole
06:58
golf tournament
06:59
but she didn't know it was an olympic
07:01
event
07:02
she died 55 years later still not
07:06
knowing that she was america's first
07:08
female olympic champion
07:10
wow i know no one told her at any point
07:13
how did she get into the olympics then i
07:15
don't know
07:16
there are all these sort of weird half
07:17
olympic events so the male coach i think
07:19
they've decided now it wasn't uh it was
07:21
technically an olympic event and all of
07:22
this stuff there's all this sort of kind
07:23
of shadow olympics and the whole time
07:25
jump i think at that same event was
07:26
decided it didn't count as an olympic
07:28
event but the horse long jump did yeah
07:30
because horses jumped i think they
07:31
jumped over six foot at that well did
07:33
they which yeah so the modern olympics
07:36
uh you know it disappeared for a long
07:38
time obviously someone brought it back
07:39
and the person who brought it back one
07:40
of the main people was a guy called
07:42
baron d kuberton so baron de cuberton uh
07:45
decided when he set it up uh that he was
07:48
gonna award an olympic gold so someone
07:50
won this in the olympics for literature
07:53
right so there was a whole arts category
07:55
that happened with the olympics uh which
07:57
they've since dropped um but so they did
08:00
it in all different things they did it
08:01
in sculpture architecture in poetry um
08:04
but do you know who won the poetry award
08:07
no he did
08:08
did he did it
08:10
he wouldn't he was no good at um sports
08:12
but he set up the olympics and he's like
08:14
well how am i going to win a gold medal
08:15
then and so he sets up poetry and then
08:17
he did a poem himself and he won he won
08:19
a gold medal guys i really really think
08:21
we should have a poetry competition in
08:23
the olympia i know it's kind of sporty
08:25
but you know yeah it was meant to be the
08:26
whole thing 1948 was the last uh that
08:28
was the last london olympics before
08:30
2012. that was the last time they had
08:32
architecture and
08:34
was it yeah sculpting
08:36
running town planning i've got the i've
08:38
got the uh town planning yeah there was
08:41
an olympic medal for town planning yeah
08:43
but it was solo town planning it was
08:45
very important
08:47
there so they also had it for painting
08:49
and graphic art
08:51
so i've got the gold silver and bronze
08:54
winners of the 1948 painting and graphic
08:57
art uh competition so in at bronze was a
09:01
guy called alex diggleman from uh
09:03
switzerland who won it for his graphic
09:06
art world championship for ice hockey
09:08
poster
09:09
silver was alex diggleman from
09:12
switzerland for world championship for
09:14
cycling poster
09:16
gold medal
09:17
to no-one
09:26
can you imagine losing to nobody so the
09:29
art the olympic art had to be art that
09:31
was about olympic sports yes presumably
09:34
everything had to be about the olympics
09:35
imagine having to tell him that he won
09:37
silver and he'd be really excited and he
09:39
said oh that's great i'm so made up to
09:40
one silver who got gold uh yeah a little
09:43
thing alex
09:45
there is an interesting thing they did a
09:46
study of um
09:48
faces of
09:49
people who are doing races who do
09:51
running races in the olympics and they
09:53
could tell how happy people were
09:55
by how smiley they were on the podium
09:58
and anyone who came second was much more
10:00
miserable than whoever came third they
10:02
found that out because the people who
10:03
came second presumably are really upset
10:05
because they just just missed out on
10:07
gold yeah and the people who came third
10:08
and well i got something at least
10:10
yeah wow you told us okay james told us
10:13
this great thing the other day about um
10:15
usain bolt what was that quiz question
10:17
that you said about him breaking the
10:18
hundred meters oh yeah um
10:20
well his fastest ever 100 meters is a
10:23
lot faster than world record and that's
10:25
because the second half of his 200
10:27
meters uh he'd already had a running
10:29
start and so i think he beat nine
10:31
seconds for a hundred meters usain bolt
10:33
but he was already running he was
10:34
already started he had a really good
10:35
start yeah but when he broke their 100
10:37
meters world record he had one of his
10:39
shoes untied one of his shoelaces on top
10:41
no way that's how good he is yeah that
10:43
would be so distracting
10:46
how did he not stop i'm sure he wasn't
10:47
looking at it the whole time
10:49
should i deal with this did he stop and
10:51
tie it up
10:52
yeah he still broke the record in spite
10:54
of stopping to tie it up through double
10:56
knot or
10:58
he when he did his 100 when he does 100
11:00
meters his feet are touching the ground
11:01
for i think two seconds
11:03
and in the whole race wow yeah
11:06
really yeah wow yeah do you want to know
11:08
um something else about the the long
11:10
jump in ancient greece this was so hard
11:13
that you were allowed to have weights so
11:14
you held these weights and you sort of
11:16
threw them behind yourself as you jump
11:17
forward also the ancient greek long jump
11:20
was so tricky that you were allowed to
11:21
have a flute playing so you could keep
11:23
time with it as you did your jump that
11:25
was their concession we know this is
11:27
really hard so we'll give you a flute
11:28
player to make it a bit easier
11:31
so the flute played a rhythm and then
11:32
yeah exactly yeah yeah yeah the flute
11:34
would play in time so that you could
11:35
make your jump i do feel like between
11:37
flute playing and steroids you'd
11:39
probably go for the latter one of you we
11:41
understand this is hard you can have an
11:42
orchestra accompanying you awesome
11:44
performance
11:46
tested for flutes obviously for liars uh
11:48
yeah all kinds of stuff um we're gonna
11:50
have to move on to our second fact does
11:52
anyone have anything else before we do
11:54
no okay uh time for our second fact and
11:57
that is chezinski yeah my fact is that
11:59
every time alfred hitchcock had a cup of
12:02
tea he always smashed the teacup
12:05
that was what he did always
12:07
well apparently every morning he'd have
12:09
his cup of tea before he went off to
12:11
work and he'd drink the tea smash the
12:13
teacup go to work he'd drink tea in the
12:15
studio throw teacups at the wall and it
12:18
was just his tea drinking habit
12:22
he sounds very difficult doesn't he he's
12:23
a madman he was a madman uh someone
12:26
wrote a biography recently about him
12:27
saying he was doing it to remind himself
12:29
of the frailty of human life um so he
12:31
throws a teague up against the wall and
12:33
thinks oh that's like me dying um but he
12:35
just did it
12:37
he used to smash he used to punch light
12:38
bulbs out quite a lot as well yeah yeah
12:41
that's how he turned off lights yeah he
12:44
turned the light on and then he just
12:45
punch it until it stopped giving out
12:46
light yeah and actually speaking of
12:49
horses he wants he was really good
12:51
friends with gerald de mourier who was
12:53
daphne tomorrow's dad uh and
12:56
he gerald maria was an actor and at one
12:59
point alfred hitchcock while gerald
13:01
demario was out on stage performing a
13:03
play alfred hitchcock somehow nobody
13:05
knows how had a horse delivered to his
13:07
dressing room so gerald came came back
13:10
you know at the interval or whatever
13:11
while he was performing went into his
13:13
dressing room and there was a huge horse
13:15
there and he didn't know what to do with
13:17
it and no one knows how i got there and
13:19
i don't know how he removed it he was a
13:21
bit of a prankster wasn't he he loved
13:23
practical jokes yeah
13:25
one of the things he used to do was he
13:26
would get into a lift with a friend of
13:29
his who told amazing stories and then he
13:31
would start to tell this incredible
13:33
incredible story and then as soon as the
13:35
doors opened he would get he's just
13:37
about to the punch line and then walk
13:39
out so everyone else in the left is like
13:41
no what happens but he also stopped the
13:43
lift just by jamming his arm into the
13:45
doors and levering them open and getting
13:47
out even if it was between floors
13:50
classic hitch pranks
13:53
so i think the most impressive prank i
13:55
don't know if this is impressive or if
13:56
it makes him a bad person but um
14:00
i know what i think already yeah but
14:02
you're a bit of a prude um
14:04
so
14:05
he was one of his employees on set uh
14:08
one night he said i bet you a certain
14:10
amount of money i think it was just i
14:11
bet you a pound that you won't agree to
14:14
be handcuffed to a part of this set
14:16
overnight you don't have the balls i'm
14:18
going to turn all the lights off and so
14:20
the stage i was like oh a pound yeah
14:22
maybe it was more than a pound it was
14:23
still only the 60s um yeah yeah i can do
14:26
that sure and so alfred would like was
14:28
like yeah great fine have a drink to
14:30
celebrate gave him a brandy spiked his
14:32
brandy with a lot of laxatives
14:34
handcuffed him to the set they all went
14:37
home they came back the next day there
14:39
was a man there in tears covered in [ __ ]
14:42
having soiled himself all over the set
14:45
now do you think that makes it fun
14:48
or do you think it maybe makes him a bad
14:49
person
14:52
call me captain prudi
14:56
i'm on the fence he did then give him a
14:58
bonus oh great
15:01
yeah but this this is a good sort of bar
15:03
of what his comedy was like uh the bbc
15:06
uncovered some archive interviews that
15:08
they did with him recently uh from a
15:10
while ago uh when he was live and uh
15:13
he really all the interviews after he
15:15
died are so boring
15:17
so it turns out that psycho the the
15:20
great horror uh when he made it he
15:22
thought he was making a really good
15:23
comedy
15:25
absolutely true he thought he was making
15:26
a comedy and he thought people he was
15:28
parodying the genre but he did it so
15:31
well and he took it so into such an
15:33
obscene territory that it got taken as a
15:35
problem he did it so well that it wasn't
15:37
funny is that what a stand-up comedian
15:39
could say yeah uh so good knowing no
15:42
according to hitchcock that's that's
15:44
what he said psycho was intended to be a
15:46
comedy you know when he um released when
15:48
he first released psycho he bought up or
15:50
he got his pa to buy up all the copies
15:52
of the novel psycho that he could find
15:54
in america because he didn't want anyone
15:56
to give away the ending yeah he would do
15:58
that with all of his films he bought up
15:59
the right so you couldn't see them in
16:00
the cinema after the cinema run had
16:02
ended because he only wanted people to
16:03
see them in the cinema so he would stop
16:05
them from being broadcast after that so
16:08
for about 30 years nobody saw psycho in
16:10
the cinema after you know until after he
16:12
died really um psycho is the first film
16:14
to feature a
16:16
actual shot of a toilet flushing
16:18
oh yeah yeah 1960 was when it was made
16:21
and still before then so taboo and it
16:23
got all these terrible reviews which
16:25
were partly based on all the murders and
16:26
partly based on i can't believe they
16:28
showed a toilet flashing this is
16:29
outrageous
16:30
they had never it had never been seen on
16:32
screen before i like the way you say so
16:34
taboo it never happened before as though
16:36
obviously if they had been able so it
16:38
had been socially appropriate to do a
16:39
toilet flushing they would have included
16:41
it in all the films they just aren't
16:43
that many scenes in films but that's an
16:45
appropriate thing to show
16:46
yeah you're right you're right
16:49
something else fun he did if you went on
16:51
holiday and you're friends with alfred
16:52
he would he would murder you hilariously
16:56
and then give you a bonus
16:57
[Laughter]
17:00
if you went on holiday he was actually
17:02
completely harmless he would just leave
17:04
some extra large furniture in your house
17:06
for when you returned he sounds pretty
17:08
so so mad
17:10
speaking of things that were only used
17:13
once justin bieber never wears
17:15
underpants twice does he not i googled
17:17
sort of famous people who may not use
17:20
things twice and
17:22
i oh were you googling justin bieber no
17:24
underwear
17:26
i i discovered that the queen is not
17:28
allowed to appear in a public uh i guess
17:32
if she's going to open a library or or
17:35
like you know launch a new starbucks
17:37
latte she can't appear in her underwear
17:40
but it can't be seen in the same
17:42
costume that she's worn previously so
17:44
otherwise what happens well i think it's
17:47
just they don't want it to happen and
17:48
she has a she has a stylist who has a
17:50
spreadsheet of every single bit of
17:52
clothing that she's worn to an
17:54
appearance and she make they make sure
17:56
that nothing matches up and they've
17:57
given every bit of
17:58
clothing code name like buttercup for a
18:02
yellow dress uh well she's been going a
18:04
long time like the queen so there must
18:06
be
18:07
not many clothes left she's going to be
18:09
just turning up in a romper suit but
18:11
that's the the headline is always if uh
18:13
kate middleton wears an outfit twice
18:15
they say oh she's recycling her outfits
18:17
exactly so you never see that with a
18:19
queen because of the great spreadsheet
18:20
that they've made and so this guy stuart
18:23
parvin he's the guy who for 11 years was
18:25
the queen's personal um uh he dressed
18:28
her he picked all the clothing he said
18:30
in this interview that she has someone
18:32
employed specifically to wear her shoes
18:34
before she wears them no way yeah so
18:36
someone just wears the queen's shoes and
18:38
she breaks them nice and sweaty so
18:39
they're comfy yeah so they're comfy for
18:41
when she has to wear them for the first
18:42
time that she goes to uh so the only
18:44
person who can have that job is someone
18:45
who has exactly the same size and shape
18:47
feet as the queen i guess yeah i read
18:50
the other day i don't even know if it's
18:51
true i read that prince charles has his
18:53
shoelaces ironed
18:57
it might not be true but i did read it
18:59
only if he buys curly shoelaces like fun
19:01
ones which you can get as a kid
19:04
they're slightly more expensive
19:07
so smashing things should have gone to
19:08
that smashing crockery the greeks do
19:10
that don't they yeah yeah well actually
19:12
they don't really do it it's kind of dis
19:14
uh discouraged in greece these days um
19:16
they prefer people not to do it so much
19:17
not just for the austerity reasons
19:20
um no they don't really think it's a
19:22
good idea but when they do do it the
19:24
what they do often is i believe this is
19:26
true they'll buy lots of kind of
19:28
semi-broken plates like they've already
19:30
got little cracks in them and they'll
19:32
have like 19 of those and then one real
19:34
plate and they'll kind of run the real
19:36
place along the slightly broken ones to
19:39
make it look this is real this is real
19:40
and then they'll smash them all on the
19:42
floor so often one of them won't
19:43
properly smash because that's the real
19:45
plate and the other ones aren't really
19:46
real hang on sorry what qualifies a
19:48
plate as real as in it's got like cracks
19:51
it's like um like a stunt plate
19:54
you can still put food on it presumably
19:57
you only put food on it i'm afraid stunt
19:59
food
20:00
but apparently before they smash plates
20:02
they used to throw knives at the feet of
20:04
dancers i'm gonna have to move us on to
20:06
the next fact but if you have anything
20:07
more go for it um just one thing like
20:10
it's quite famous that turing used to
20:12
chain his um teacup to a radiator alan
20:16
turing alan turing yeah so the great um
20:18
the great computer scientist uh during
20:21
in bletchley park he used to chain his
20:23
cup to a radiator so that no one would
20:25
steal it
20:26
i'm not like not like to mess with his
20:28
teacup or anything like alfred hitchcock
20:29
torturing his teacups okay cool
20:32
but everyone like thinks of this as a
20:33
kind of a weird sort of way that he's
20:35
quite eccentric but a few years ago they
20:37
went round to bletchley park and they
20:39
were draining the um lake to try and
20:42
find some enigma enigma machines and
20:44
when they drained the lake they found a
20:46
load of cups in there and apparently um
20:48
turing's assistant um used to just go
20:51
around with his cup and then just wander
20:53
around and throw it in the in the water
20:55
so actually he was quite right to chain
20:56
it to because people just used to steal
20:58
it all the time yeah wow maybe that's
21:00
why hitchcock did it to prevent theft
21:04
okay time for fact number three
21:06
and that is andy my fact is the romanian
21:11
equivalent of comparing apples and
21:12
oranges is
21:14
you're comparing grandmothers and
21:15
machine guns
21:16
[Laughter]
21:18
because
21:20
those are much more different than
21:21
apples and oranges are yeah apples and
21:23
oranges are really similar and there
21:25
have been studies done on apples and
21:27
oranges what did see how similar they
21:29
are
21:30
the difference there was one study in
21:32
the british medical journal in 2000 and
21:33
it's kind of a joke study but still and
21:35
you did this whole table of similarities
21:37
and differences between apples and
21:38
oranges around both round yes uh both
21:41
fruit yeah yeah i can keep going no no
21:45
um so in the color table it says oranges
21:49
orange
21:50
apples depends on variety
21:53
um can be juiced oranges yes
21:56
apples yes
21:58
and it goes through this whole list of
21:59
similarities between them yeah wow and
22:02
they are really similar it turns out and
22:03
so why is it grandma's and grandmothers
22:06
don't know just i think they've picked
22:07
two very very different things okay yeah
22:10
they've just done better than we did
22:11
it's slightly more imaginative than we
22:13
are another thing they say in romania is
22:16
it's like comparing cows and long johns
22:19
hmm yeah my favorite one when i was
22:21
trying to find sort of interesting
22:23
sayings there's a spanish proverb and
22:25
this is the spanish proverb there are no
22:27
ugly 15 year olds
22:29
[Laughter]
22:31
i don't know what context you would ever
22:33
say well in prison as they say
22:37
well your
22:38
honor i think the court and the jury
22:41
will agree
22:41
[Laughter]
22:44
wow all children are attractive hear
22:45
some more romanian phrases and guess
22:47
what they mean oh yeah please um
22:49
you take me out of the watermelons
22:54
is it like something you say to a lady
22:56
who really kind of blows your mind yeah
22:58
you give me butterflies no it's the
22:59
opposite it's uh you're making me really
23:01
angry
23:02
because obviously where do we all want
23:03
to be among the watermelons yeah you
23:06
take me out of the melons stop this
23:08
that explains the problems i had in that
23:10
romanian nightclub
23:13
um
23:14
my face has fallen off
23:16
is it literal that one no no
23:19
i'm surprised i'm
23:22
um and you've put snot in the beans
23:26
is that something you might say to
23:27
alfred hitchcock
23:28
[Laughter]
23:30
it just means you've made a mistake just
23:31
a fun way of saying you made a mistake
23:32
but it's not in the beans yeah i have i
23:35
have made a whip out of [ __ ]
23:39
it means i've done a lot with a little
23:41
i've made a really good effort
23:42
considering i've got limited resources
23:45
like making a purse from a salzia yeah
23:47
i've met a person from a cells here and
23:48
a whip out of [ __ ] a whip isn't a
23:51
spaceship i mean it's
23:53
not the most complicated thing you could
23:55
manufacture okay you try making a whip
23:58
out of [ __ ] i have a friend who lived in
24:00
south america who powered electrically
24:03
his entire home out of a huge pile of
24:05
manure in his back garden and you're
24:07
saying making a whip
24:09
squidging poo into something that could
24:11
hit someone
24:13
is like turning something tiny into
24:15
something fantastic
24:16
i just i would question the logic of
24:18
that one all right
24:20
they are quite illogical in germany they
24:22
say you have tomatoes on your eyes uh to
24:25
me and you're not seeing what everyone
24:27
else can see but why tomatoes
24:29
it's always fruits and apples especially
24:32
so in spanish i think they say when you
24:34
say you're going to walk around the
24:35
block in spain you'd say let's walk
24:37
around the apple take a walk around the
24:39
apple wow i don't know why that's great
24:42
it's weird in colombia to confuse two
24:45
things it's a bit like um been like were
24:47
you saying before but you would say um
24:49
he confused [ __ ] with face cream
24:54
that is a mistake it is a mistake here
24:55
or one of alfred hitchcock's hilarious
24:57
pranks
25:02
and if you're in sweden if you um
25:06
if you're talking about someone who
25:07
hasn't really had to put in much effort
25:08
to achieve what they've achieved do you
25:10
say he slid in on a shrimp sandwich and
25:14
that means he got here really easily
25:16
which actually not that easy to slide on
25:19
a shrimp sandwich you have some
25:20
priorities about what's easy and what's
25:21
hard
25:23
it's easy to slip on a shrimp sandwich
25:25
it's very hard to compress turds
25:26
together to make a working whip indiana
25:29
jones's whip wasn't made of poo
25:33
we don't know that i think we think we
25:35
have very different skill sets
25:36
slipping is very different to sliding so
25:38
you can slip on it but sliding in that
25:40
implies like you're skiing into the into
25:43
the piece i will concede that skiing on
25:44
a shrimp sandwich would be hard that
25:46
would be quite difficult
25:48
are any of these uh are the are any of
25:50
these actually said in these countries
25:52
it's a weird one that because we
25:54
occasionally do this kind of thing on qi
25:56
and when we ever say it we will say okay
25:58
in thailand they say um the hen sees a
26:02
snake's feet and the snake sees the hens
26:04
boobs and that means two people who know
26:06
each other secret we'll say something
26:08
like that on qi and then everyone in
26:10
thailand will email us and say no we
26:11
don't say that at all yeah well i think
26:13
i think it will be said and i think it's
26:15
just people like i haven't heard every
26:17
phrase that gets used in britain yeah
26:19
yeah i think that's right if there are
26:21
people from sweden or spain or germany
26:24
who know that we're wrong please do
26:25
heckle so just like we were talking
26:27
about grandmothers and um
26:29
machine guns right at the start so maybe
26:30
a few things about guns yeah yeah um you
26:34
know how old you have to be to get a
26:35
firearms license in the uk
26:38
is it 12. it's 14 okay do you know how
26:41
old you have to be to get a shotgun
26:43
license
26:44
no you have to be two
26:46
no way and the reason you have to be two
26:49
is because an adult needs to sign for
26:51
you saying they've known you for at
26:52
least two years
26:53
[Laughter]
26:58
and i can confirm you as a fit and
27:00
proper person you are in a shock
27:02
really so good that is that yeah there's
27:04
loads of people like under 10 in the uk
27:06
who have shotgun licenses but you can't
27:08
buy a shotgun until you're a certain age
27:09
although an adult could buy you a
27:11
shotgun does anyone here have a shotgun
27:12
license
27:13
or just that child on the front
27:16
how old are you
27:18
19. so you've had it for 17 years you
27:21
must be very good the person who
27:23
invented the first portable automatic
27:25
machine gun was a guy called hiram maxim
27:27
he's kind of a bit famous and um he was
27:29
arrested an old age he also invented the
27:32
traditional mousetrap that people use he
27:34
was arrested in old age in 1913 for
27:37
harassing salvation army workers with a
27:40
pea shooter
27:43
but better that than the machine gun
27:45
i read a story about him which was that
27:47
when he invented the machine gun but was
27:49
testing it out um in his neighborhood he
27:51
went to all his neighbors saying um
27:53
sorry to bother at 3 pm today or
27:55
whatever time he said i'm going to be
27:57
testing out my new machine gun
27:59
if you could open your windows the noise
28:01
is so great in this vicinity it will
28:03
smash all the glass in your house if the
28:05
windows are shut could you really
28:06
consider it yeah he sounds like a nice
28:08
guy i think he showed off the gun there
28:09
was an early demonstration of the
28:10
machine gun and he was because it was
28:12
queen victoria who was the queen at the
28:14
time and one of the things he did to
28:15
demonstrate how cool it was was he
28:17
blasted with the machine gun the letters
28:18
v
28:19
r for victoria regina into a brick wall
28:23
yeah
28:24
yeah yeah that was the thing
28:26
would you trust a man who said i'm going
28:28
to be practicing with my machine gun
28:30
this morning can i ask that you open
28:31
your windows for me
28:35
i mean it doesn't really make any
28:36
difference whether you do or not
28:41
we're going to have to move on so
28:43
time for our final fact and that is
28:45
james harkin okay my fact this week is
28:48
that replacement eyelids can be made
28:50
from foreskins
28:55
i told you i told you they would groan i
28:57
told you wait has this actually been
28:59
done it's been done yeah it has been
29:00
done um you might lose your eyelid for
29:03
you might get a disease or you might it
29:04
might be burned someone might be
29:06
practicing with a machine gun next door
29:09
exactly and then the problem is your
29:10
eyelid is kind of really thin kind of
29:13
skin and so it's really hard to find
29:14
replacement skin from around the body
29:16
and there are a few different places to
29:17
get it um but the foreskin works
29:19
particularly well and people have had
29:21
their eyelids replaced with foreskins
29:25
do they what
29:28
what what do they get to replace their
29:30
foreskin
29:32
so they get another foreskin from
29:33
somewhere else it's like a pyramid
29:35
scheme of foreskins
29:39
if your foreskin is on your eyelid are
29:41
you circumcised or is that does a
29:43
foreskin have to be fully removed or
29:45
does it just have to be removed from its
29:46
original position that's a very good
29:48
question
29:51
i feel like i'm going to let you down i
29:52
don't know the the correct answer you
29:54
should re-read the torah because it must
29:56
be in there somewhere um just quickly
29:58
before we get into foreskin valley um
30:01
if you don't have a this is really
30:02
really cool if you don't have uh if your
30:03
eyelids don't work um so the eyelid is
30:06
there and it's intact but it knee it
30:08
doesn't operate the muscles don't work
30:09
to move it um one way that doctors can
30:12
fix it is they take gold thread and
30:14
because they use gold in the body
30:16
because it doesn't react with anything
30:17
it's inert chemically and it's the
30:19
thread they use is a hundred times
30:20
thinner than a human hair
30:22
and they thread it through the eyelid
30:24
which gives it a bit of stability and it
30:26
stiffens it and what that means is it's
30:28
stiff enough to open and close the eye
30:29
but you have to do it by hand so you
30:31
just do this you just put your hand up
30:33
and they go yep i'm awake or whatever it
30:36
is that you do isn't that incredible
30:37
yeah yeah so you can wink at someone by
30:39
just going
30:41
[Laughter]
30:43
it's amazing i read this thing uh this
30:45
isn't really related but one of the
30:47
early buttock augmentation uh surgeries
30:50
though the guy who invented
30:51
buttercaugmentation basically took um a
30:54
breast um kind of uh silicon thing from
30:57
a breast and just put it in someone's
30:58
butt that's basically the way he did it
31:00
but the problem was it didn't really
31:02
look like a look like a bottom so uh
31:05
is that what it did
31:08
and so what they did instead is they
31:09
managed to get like something that was
31:11
better sculpted and put it in between
31:13
the gluteus maximus and i think the
31:15
gluteus minimus and so it actually looks
31:17
a bit like a buttock and this was the
31:19
first proper real butter augmentation
31:21
surgery and but the problem was that it
31:23
kept slipping
31:26
and so what you could do is someone
31:27
would go oh your buttocks slipped and
31:29
then you could actually lift it up and
31:30
put it back in place
31:32
how far down did it slip
31:34
out of your trousers or something
31:36
oh sorry
31:38
it could go quite far down the thigh i
31:39
think
31:40
oh my god
31:42
interesting that isn't it yeah it's
31:43
amazing i wonder if you still say
31:45
someone had a nice ass if it was just
31:47
halfway down their calf
31:49
i read about the first penis transplant
31:51
the other day
31:52
which they've successfully done have
31:54
they yeah and uh they knew they could do
31:56
it for a long time and this guy wanted
31:57
to have it done and the only issue was
31:59
is that for four to five years it was i
32:01
guess to the tail end of four years um
32:03
they couldn't find a donor
32:06
that's very reasonable
32:07
[Laughter]
32:09
i heard
32:10
[Laughter]
32:12
that they used a middle finger once for
32:14
a penis transfer no i've read this and
32:17
they're all looking and i've got no
32:18
evidence either i've forgotten all the
32:19
sources and i read it five or six years
32:21
ago anyway it's already quite bad when
32:23
someone gives you the finger in the
32:25
street
32:26
it was also attached to the groin it
32:28
would be ten times worse uh no some
32:30
stuff on let's say some stuff on eyelids
32:33
shall we um pioneering french surgeon
32:36
ambrose parray uh if you had itching
32:39
eyelids he suggested washing your
32:41
eyelids in urine
32:44
um but only if the urine had been kept
32:46
all night in a barber's basin
32:49
okay it's very specific isn't it
32:52
do you have to have the consent of the
32:53
barber presumably you can't just wee in
32:56
a barber's basin yeah and then go in the
32:57
next day oh yes sir i've been using
32:59
basin for hope you don't mind my eyelids
33:00
are itchy
33:01
do you wanna hear another really
33:02
interesting body part replacement thing
33:04
yes this guy is great okay there's a
33:06
finnish computer programmer his name is
33:08
jerry jalava and in 2008 he lost a
33:11
finger he lost his third finger in a
33:13
motorbike accident so he replaced it
33:16
with his penis
33:20
yeah his typing has not improved um
33:23
no but everyone was saying oh it's so
33:24
annoying for you because you type for a
33:26
living don't you because you're a
33:27
computer programmer you're going to be
33:28
really it's going to be really annoying
33:29
for you and he said yes yes it is going
33:31
to be really annoying and eventually he
33:32
decided to do something about it and he
33:34
built himself a prosthetic finger not
33:36
only that it doubles up as a usb drive
33:39
[Laughter]
33:40
so all he has to do he just peels back
33:42
his prosthetic fingernail and there's a
33:44
there's a he and he can just plug into a
33:46
computer no no no one can ever just plug
33:48
in a usb into a computer
33:50
yeah he turns upside
33:52
and so he uh he can store two gigabytes
33:55
of data in his finger and he can even
33:57
remove the whole finger and give it to
33:58
someone else if they need to store a
33:59
file or something
34:01
how cool is that amazing yeah what a
34:02
great guy i don't know if i'd accept
34:04
that if you ask somebody they had a
34:06
spare usb
34:08
oh yeah
34:10
that's a great idea um another on eyes
34:12
and yeah like um replacement surgery you
34:14
know if so in 2009 i think was the first
34:17
instance of this a woman who'd been
34:18
blind for nine years had her eye
34:21
replaced with her tooth
34:23
um and she could see again
34:26
so this sometimes people are having
34:27
surgery to get their cornea replaced
34:30
with their tooth and they make so
34:32
they drill a hole in the tooth and they
34:34
make a little lens in it and then they
34:36
have to implant it in a different part
34:38
of your body because the lens needs to
34:40
properly fuse i think with the tooth
34:41
first of all so they implanted it in her
34:43
shoulder for a while um
34:46
and then they can put it in the eye if
34:48
you google image it's very weird um but
34:51
there are people who've had their teeth
34:52
in their eyes and they can see properly
34:54
and they just line it up with the retina
34:56
and there's people who've got corneal
34:57
problems where it's gone blurry that's
34:59
amazing
35:00
so you
35:06
that is so incredible that's the main
35:07
benefit that's what they say they're all
35:09
pleased about we're going to have to
35:10
wrap up soon so should we
35:12
james um okay well um just on what you
35:14
were saying um you can get um stem cells
35:18
these days can do all sorts of things
35:20
and people there was a lady who kind of
35:21
injected some stem cells into her
35:23
wrinkles around her eyes uh because she
35:25
wanted to get rid of the wrinkles and it
35:26
was hope that it would grow back and
35:28
then suddenly whenever she kind of
35:30
winked her eyes she heard this bony
35:32
clicking
35:33
uh and it turned out that um no yeah it
35:37
turned out that a bone had grown in her
35:39
eyelid
35:40
[Music]
35:42
i know
35:44
i've got some light entertaining stuff
35:45
about four skins if anyone wants it
35:49
oh hang on
35:50
eyelids quickly because i've always
35:52
wanted to know this you know that thing
35:52
when your eyelid involuntarily twitches
35:54
yeah like you have a twitching eyelid so
35:56
that's called um
35:59
blepharosplasm or blepharospasm um and
36:02
so it's usually it's usually fine and
36:04
harmless some people have it so badly
36:06
that their eyelids get locked shut um
36:08
and a cure that was proposed for that in
36:10
the late 1700s by a doctor gerald and it
36:14
was he suggested he certainly doesn't
36:15
sound like a real doctor if any doctor
36:17
only gives you their first name that's a
36:19
real dangerous sign like doctor nick in
36:21
the simpsons
36:22
so dr jez advised that people who had
36:25
this problem with their eyes were
36:26
clamped shut because their blepharospasm
36:28
was so bad um don't try and cure the
36:30
spasm drill a hole in their eyelid so
36:33
that they can see through it
36:36
i actually don't know if anyone had that
36:38
done but
36:39
it's natural thinking hope not also
36:41
blepharospasm are playing on the obelisk
36:43
stage
36:44
at 9pm tonight secret gig so check them
36:46
out they're very good
36:48
four skins humorous full skins
36:51
all right there's a bit bit pg-13 but
36:54
um some cosmetics are tested on
36:57
foreskins yeah but ones that have been
36:59
removed if someone is circumcised when
37:00
they're born the hospital normally sells
37:02
the foreskin there is a man out there
37:04
who's been circumcised and his cells
37:06
have been used and grown and grown and
37:08
grown and grown and grown to make an
37:10
entire face cream company
37:12
but here's the thing it um there was a
37:14
whole antique because when people found
37:15
out that foreskins were being used for
37:17
cosmetics there was a huge
37:19
anti-foreskin movement that try to stop
37:21
it
37:22
and it turns out oprah winfrey has
37:24
released foreskin products um not for
37:26
your foreskin like foreskin face
37:28
products and
37:30
that's a great product name for skin
37:32
that's brilliant yes
37:35
so obvious yeah
37:36
but so that's the amazing thing about it
37:38
it's not as if they're carting off lots
37:40
of foreskins to turn into face cream
37:42
it's one singular foreskin that they've
37:44
been using for 20 years well they can't
37:47
get there are lots of foreskins but yeah
37:48
you can use them for up to yeah i think
37:50
40 years because the cell it's just the
37:52
cells in there are very unusual there's
37:53
a did you say are they they're like stem
37:55
cells and they can be grown and used in
37:57
lots of different ways and they're yeah
37:58
yeah they're incredible medically yeah
38:00
yeah it's insane um we're gonna have to
38:01
wrap up in a sec so if anyone's got
38:03
anything a final fact they want to throw
38:05
in no no we're good uh okay all right
38:08
that's it that's all of our thanks
38:09
thanks so much for thank you
38:12
if you want to get in contact with any
38:14
of us about the things we've said on our
38:16
podcast we can be found on twitter i'm
38:18
on tribal and andy and andrew hunter m
38:20
james at egg shaped anna you can email
38:23
podcast ui.com yeah you go to no such
38:25
thing as a fish.com we've got 70
38:27
episodes up there thank you so much for
38:29
being here guys that was fun as hell

00:00
[Music]
00:06
[Music]
00:11
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:14
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:16
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:18
covent garden my name is dan shriver i'm
00:20
sitting here with anna chazinski james
00:22
harkin and andy murray and once again we
00:25
have gathered around the microphones
00:26
with our four favorite facts from the
00:27
last seven days and in no particular
00:29
order here we go
00:32
starting with you jacinsky
00:34
my fact is that the first item to be
00:36
sent via new york's pneumatic tube
00:39
postal system was an artificial peach
00:42
and the second was a live black cat yeah
00:45
that's an artificial peach that's the
00:46
interesting thing it was it was a huge
00:48
oversized one as well it's quite a leap
00:50
really because you would think you'd go
00:51
from artificial peach to real peach to
00:53
artificial cat to real cat but they just
00:55
missed out a few stairs yeah they got
00:57
overconfident yeah but the cat did
00:59
survive did it bizarrely uh this story
01:02
comes from the reminiscences of a postal
01:04
worker called howard wallace connolly
01:06
he self-published an autobiography in
01:08
1931 and he worked for the postal
01:11
service where new york was building its
01:13
pneumatic postal delivery system which
01:15
is a system of pneumatic tubes
01:17
underneath new york and so he recounted
01:19
the big launch of this pneumatic tube
01:21
which was an exciting event so there's a
01:23
guy demonstrating the pneumatic tube
01:24
going look how great this is this is
01:26
coming from the other side of town and
01:27
there's this opening of the pneumatic
01:28
tube and something shoots out from it he
01:30
opens it up it's an artificial peach and
01:32
then a second thing shoots out of it he
01:34
opens it up and a cat jumped out and
01:36
looked really scared and tried to get
01:37
away and then they grabbed it i read
01:39
though that they had a basket waiting
01:41
for the cat so
01:42
someone knew this was pre-planned it
01:44
wasn't like a cat the cat had a leptin
01:46
of its own accord
01:48
cats get into places that they shouldn't
01:50
get into i read just this morning um you
01:53
know the famous scene in the godfather
01:54
marlon brando stroking a cat that comes
01:56
up onto the table that was a stray cat
01:58
that just jumped on and brando
02:00
improvised with it yeah it's one of the
02:01
most famous scenes in cinematic history
02:03
what about that one in james bond where
02:05
he's stroking the camera the villain was
02:06
meant to be the cat and then blowfelt
02:08
just walked on yeah the cat started
02:09
improvising it was a straight villain
02:11
awesome 101 dalmatians was just called
02:13
one dalmatian 100 strays just walked in
02:17
and by the way though london
02:19
40 years before
02:21
uh new york had this pneumatic tubing
02:23
london had pneumatic tubing do you know
02:24
what the first thing they sent
02:27
on their trip was it was a novelty
02:30
foam strawberry
02:32
followed by a live
02:34
bear no it was the duke of buckingham
02:39
was he just a stray duke of buckingham
02:41
who just wandered in
02:43
pneumatic tube sounds amazing they are
02:45
unbelievable the best thing ever so
02:47
basically the way they work just to
02:48
quickly explain although i'm sure people
02:50
mostly know is that it's a big pipe and
02:54
you have to put a cylindrical tube in it
02:57
and this and you put whatever you want
02:59
to send inside the cylindrical tube and
03:01
the cylindrical tube is propelled down
03:02
the big pipe by the force of compressed
03:04
air or by a vacuum so that it's sucked
03:07
into the vacuum and people thought this
03:09
is how they were going to deliver post
03:10
so there was a time in the late 19th
03:12
century in new york where i think a
03:15
third of all post was delivered by
03:16
pneumatic tube it kind of still feels
03:18
like the future doesn't it it's so
03:20
futuristic i think well it is sounds
03:22
like it is going to be a part of the
03:24
future now because elon musk the
03:26
billionaire of paypal and who's been
03:27
doing spacex and so on he's now building
03:30
a pneumatic
03:31
ride to get people um from san francisco
03:33
to l.a whoa yeah it's gonna take half an
03:36
hour i think he suggested it is he
03:37
actually building it so this was from an
03:39
article two years ago so actually yes i
03:40
don't know fully if he's if he's stuck
03:42
with it um his idea is that it'll take
03:44
35 minutes to go from san francisco to
03:47
la right
03:48
but the current designs there's no
03:50
bathrooms in there so you just kind of
03:52
strap yourself in and if you want to go
03:53
it's tough and let's face it i've read
03:55
that it would you travel at 800 miles an
03:57
hour that's really so you would be
03:59
wetting yourself wouldn't you
04:00
that's true have you heard of william
04:02
murdoch he was the guy who invented this
04:04
in the uk and he is unbelievably cool so
04:07
um he invented pneumatic tubes uh he
04:10
invented gas lighting basically when he
04:13
was 23 years old he walked 300 miles to
04:16
birmingham to ask for a job with james
04:17
watt for the steam engine pioneer he got
04:20
the job partly because he had an
04:21
interview with uh what's business
04:22
partner matthew bilton the reason he got
04:24
the job was because bulton was
04:25
fascinated by murdoch's wooden hat
04:28
he had a hat he'd made himself out of
04:30
wood
04:31
and he wore it 300 miles as he walked to
04:34
birmingham and then he said can i have a
04:35
drop
04:36
because it's a talking point in an
04:37
interview clearly he also invented a
04:38
steam gun which fired lead bullets and
04:41
he invented a steam cannon and this is
04:43
this is on his wikipedia it just says
04:44
steam cannon which he attempted to use
04:46
in 1803 to knock down a wall in soho
04:49
that's all it says
04:51
it seems to me and i don't want to put
04:53
this guy down but he's just adding steam
04:55
to lots of other inventions
04:57
you're a luddite i think this guy's
04:59
amazing i want to add steam to
05:01
everything so there are some modern day
05:02
applications of pneumatic tubes right
05:04
which are also quite fun go on well
05:06
they're really common in hospitals
05:07
that's one of the few places i think
05:08
where they're still used regularly for
05:09
quickly transporting um medications up
05:12
and down floors and around hospitals so
05:14
that's quite interesting also a salmon
05:15
cannon so that's quite handy pneumatic
05:17
tubes are used to propel salmon um in
05:20
america now over waterfalls because
05:22
sometimes there's a problem with salmon
05:24
because we've built a lot of dams and so
05:26
they can no longer get up the river to
05:28
lay their eggs at the top of the river
05:30
so we shoot salmon yeah through the air
05:33
do you know how bears kind of sit by the
05:35
river and they wait for a salmon to jump
05:37
out and then kind of grab it they must
05:39
be going what the [ __ ] was that
05:42
but if you work out where the counter
05:44
where it's going to land or the other
05:45
end you just sit there with your mouth
05:46
open waiting for you to land on it
05:48
and there is a restaurant in new zealand
05:50
called c1 which has food delivery pipes
05:54
and they fire out burgers to tables in
05:57
pipes i went to in abu dhabi there's a
05:59
restaurant which is a roller coaster
06:01
restaurant and you sit and your food
06:02
gets rollercoastered to you so the food
06:04
gets to do a really fun roller coaster
06:06
ride yeah well no it's it's a time
06:08
because it's attached to ferrari world
06:10
in abu dhabi which has the fastest
06:12
roller coaster in the world so it's just
06:13
a little does only food get to enjoy
06:15
that as well
06:17
only vegetables allowed
06:21
that restaurant in new zealand the owner
06:23
said that the tubes would be locked
06:25
until it had delivered the actual
06:27
canister to the table and he said and i
06:29
quote a canister at that speed could
06:30
take someone's hand off we certainly
06:32
don't want to be known for that
06:36
there is also a restaurant in bangkok
06:38
called cartron and they send their food
06:40
by catapult
06:42
to the table
06:44
so
06:45
the chickens are cooked in the kitchen
06:47
loaded into a catapult fired across the
06:50
restaurant and caught on a spike by a
06:52
waiter riding the unicycle no
06:55
no no the health and safety required to
06:57
have a man on a unicycle holding a spike
06:59
riding around a restaurant with chickens
07:01
being fired at him
07:03
what if he doesn't catch it
07:04
he always does he always does james is
07:07
the pr man for this company
07:09
somehow got decapitated by a chicken we
07:11
don't want to be known for that
07:14
um i did i looked into cats a slight bit
07:17
um just off the back of it being a black
07:19
cat it was the first read something
07:20
crazy this morning uh
07:22
cats are lactose intolerant
07:25
no yeah
07:27
i had no idea but they drink milk yeah
07:29
well no we give them milk and they drink
07:31
it they don't know not to drink it but
07:32
they they technically majority are
07:34
lactose intolerant so but they do keep
07:36
lapping it up yeah yeah but they're so
07:38
they're quite stupid then because most
07:40
animals or something makes them sick
07:41
they avoid it yeah weird hey that's like
07:43
finding out dogs are allergic to dog
07:45
food yeah i don't
07:47
cats can be allergic to humans as well
07:49
can they yeah in the same way that
07:51
humans can like cat fur can make you
07:53
sneeze and make you make your eyes water
07:55
cats can get allergic to their owners my
07:57
god i have definitely been feeding our
07:59
cats the wrong things then chopped up
08:01
human
08:03
with a side of milk no i really feel
08:05
terrible yeah
08:07
i read as well that so whiskers
08:09
obviously very important to cats i
08:10
didn't realize they had whiskers on
08:12
other bits of their body that were just
08:14
important so they have whiskers on the
08:16
back of their legs
08:17
yeah so they use it for if their sight
08:19
is bad at night that's the so for their
08:21
for hunting prey that might be below
08:23
them they have it on the back of their
08:24
legs that's really cool no i found that
08:26
out on pussington post
08:28
which is like
08:29
it's a cat news
08:31
yeah cat news website i thought
08:33
pussington post was a magazine that was
08:35
banned in the 90s
08:37
okay
08:39
i've just clicked on the pussington post
08:41
and the headlines are unbelievably good
08:43
cat interrupts cross-stitching
08:46
irish police take care of exceptionally
08:48
cute kitten found by roadside
08:50
marmalade's epic birthday party
08:54
this is amazing there was an inventor
08:56
called joseph sturtzel in 1908 uh and he
09:00
proposed a system of larger pneumatic
09:02
tubes to transport freight i know andy's
09:04
still laughing at the pussington post
09:05
but i think we're just gonna ride on
09:06
past that cat man from japan walks nine
09:09
cats in a stroller
09:14
sorry
09:15
sorry go on
09:17
we gotta stop letting andy have a laptop
09:19
during these
09:21
it's becoming yeah
09:22
child here this is why i feed my cat's
09:24
milk
09:24
[Laughter]
09:26
so they stopped ruining the podcasts
09:28
um yeah so this guy decided that people
09:30
could be transported in pneumatic tubes
09:32
uh in in chicago so in 1908 he erected
09:35
these pneumatic tubes and then to prove
09:36
it to people like shoot that you could
09:38
shoot people underground um
09:41
he said i will demonstrate for you
09:43
uh and here's my young son robert to do
09:46
that and he laid his little son down and
09:49
there's a really good picture of it if
09:50
you look up um chicago daily news
09:52
pneumatic carrier there is a terrified
09:54
looking 10 year old boy lying down in a
09:57
cylinder about to be shot extremely fast
10:00
through a tube
10:01
and it was okay not sure actually
10:05
[Music]
10:11
okay time for fact number two and that
10:13
is james okay my fact this week is that
10:16
scientists have made algae that taste
10:18
like bacon
10:20
i did that did you yep have they made it
10:22
for fish to make their lives a bit more
10:24
enjoyable
10:26
that'd be good that would be so nice
10:28
yeah why did they make it they've made
10:29
it because it's a possible new kind of
10:32
superfood it's a kind of algae called
10:35
dulce it's a bit like seaweed and it
10:37
tastes like bacon but it's high in
10:38
protein and it has twice the nutritional
10:41
value of kale
10:43
so it means that if you're a vegetarian
10:45
or maybe we'll all be vegetarians in the
10:46
future we'll be able to eat this stuff
10:48
and still have the delicious delicious
10:50
taste of bacon but the texture of algae
10:55
what is the texture of algae slimy i
10:57
reckon yeah
10:58
slimy squishy well seaweed is a kind of
11:01
algae um and that you know that tastes
11:04
good sometimes yeah yeah i mean it
11:06
tastes like crunchy salt but yeah
11:09
it's delicious oh yeah it's delicious
11:10
yeah i love it bacon flavoured seaweed
11:13
yeah yeah that's really nice yeah but i
11:14
just like this kind of idea of like
11:17
food science and creating weird flavors
11:20
and you know yeah and i think probably
11:22
it's the future isn't it definitely i
11:24
mean we definitely are going to need to
11:25
spend a lot of attention on turning
11:27
vegetables into things that taste like
11:28
meat in the next hundred years i think
11:30
because i think we will be vegetarian
11:32
quite soon
11:33
fortunately i won't be alive then
11:36
you'll have died of cholesterol
11:37
overdoses
11:39
i was looking at what algae actually is
11:41
oh yeah what is it well there's no
11:43
generally accepted definition of algae
11:45
because it comes from lots of different
11:46
violet and they're just biologically
11:48
there's it's loads of different things i
11:50
think
11:50
but i had no idea how cool it is so 70
11:53
or 80 percent of the oxygen in the
11:55
atmosphere comes from marine plants and
11:57
those are almost all algae wow yeah so
11:59
people think that a lot of the oxygen
12:00
comes from plants photosynthesizing but
12:02
it's actually blue-green algae
12:05
yeah it's amazing uh you can even make
12:06
algae into oil they found a way of doing
12:08
that yeah a new kind of technology and
12:11
they think that might be the future of
12:12
biofuels yeah i think they've found that
12:14
it's
12:15
twice as efficient as um you know
12:17
biofuels that they make on land i think
12:19
it's about twice as efficient as that um
12:21
or you can use half as much always say
12:23
i'm not using up the land which you can
12:25
then use for making delicious bacon
12:30
um another cool thing that you can do
12:31
with algae is uh they've recently
12:33
discovered that uh it absorbs light in a
12:36
really unusual way and blind people can
12:38
have their sight restored by
12:40
uh introducing an algae gene into them
12:44
so basically you introduce to these
12:46
people a gene that encodes this light
12:48
sensitive protein which is one that only
12:50
algae has um and then you introduce that
12:53
gene into the retinal cells of a blind
12:55
person and their site can be restored
12:57
it's amazing yeah it's cool also do you
12:59
know the animal whose eyes are the best
13:01
to transplant into a human face
13:04
cats
13:06
that'd be awesome
13:08
yeah all like goats which have
13:09
rectangular pupils that would be really
13:11
fun it's sharks um because they have a
13:14
surprisingly similar eyes to ours no way
13:17
yeah they happen now yeah it does isn't
13:18
that incredible people are going around
13:19
with sharks eyes and their face i would
13:21
like to have shark nose transplant so i
13:23
could smell blood from 500 miles and you
13:26
would look so great as well
13:29
but here's another thing that they're
13:30
using algae for they've worked out that
13:32
algae might be perfect for making
13:34
batteries so i just can't see how you
13:36
would squish algae into the back of a tv
13:39
remote no there's probably more science
13:40
behind it than just taking the seaweed
13:42
yeah the same way that you can't just
13:43
shove algae in someone's face to stop
13:45
them from being blind
13:48
and there is a there is a sea slug um
13:52
that eats algae and then it can steal
13:55
the genes from the algae and it can then
13:58
photosynthesize
13:59
and it can run on solar power rather
14:01
than eating stuff is clever
14:04
so if we ate that sea slug would we be
14:06
able to photosynthesize shoved it in
14:08
your face
14:10
no is there any way that we could steal
14:12
that technology from the sea slug so
14:13
that we could photosynthesize um you
14:15
couldn't do it just by eating the sea
14:17
slug but theoretically i suppose you
14:19
could kind of splice some jeans do you
14:21
want to have you always wanted to be
14:23
able to photosynthesize andy imagine if
14:25
everyone photosynthesized so that we
14:27
were all producing oxygen
14:28
yeah it would be useful
14:30
you only need half of us wouldn't you i
14:32
could photosynthesize and my wife could
14:34
just respire in the normal way and then
14:36
we'd have a net no gain or no loss yeah
14:39
wow
14:40
um i was looking into food science
14:42
should we talk about that as well please
14:43
so um food science-wise one thing i
14:45
really liked is dog food is tested on
14:49
humans
14:50
really yeah i had no idea so you can
14:52
have this is a job anyone who makes dog
14:54
food uh that is a job and i found the
14:56
salary range is between 34 000 american
14:58
and 117 000 american per year it's not
15:01
just the money though it's the shiny
15:02
shiny coats that you get
15:03
[Laughter]
15:08
what you'll be doing is not only testing
15:09
it you're developing it as well so
15:11
here's the thing that they said salt
15:13
mussels like that kind of thing their
15:14
thing is that they say dogs will eat
15:16
anything what dogs will like though is
15:18
what humans will quite like so when
15:19
humans eat dog food they'll go um would
15:21
i feed that to myself no so i won't feed
15:23
it to the dog so that's that's kind of
15:24
the mentality that's a very strange bit
15:26
of reasoning to assume that humans and
15:27
dogs have the same sense of taste
15:29
their their point is you can't reliably
15:31
ask a dog to go no that's that's no use
15:33
because dogs will just eat it
15:36
yeah so who cares what their food tastes
15:37
like because they take all those adverts
15:38
where they say nine out of ten dogs
15:40
prefer pedigree trump you should
15:41
actually say nine out of ten humans
15:43
prefer pedigree
15:44
yeah
15:45
do they have them on all fours on the
15:47
floor in the lab
15:49
they don't wear name tags they've got
15:50
dog collars
15:52
why don't you check the whoopington post
15:54
see what they say
15:56
i bet that's awesome that must be real
15:58
check it out
16:01
i have a serious quibble with this fact
16:03
yeah dog food is not manufactured to be
16:05
something that humans want to eat
16:06
otherwise we just give them human food
16:08
have you ever tasted dog food i have
16:10
smelt it and i do think you can tell a
16:12
lot from a smell yeah absolutely
16:15
but people ate dog food during the
16:16
second world war when food human food
16:18
was in very short supply right yeah so
16:20
you're using that as evidence that
16:22
humans do enjoy it well no maybe it's
16:24
evidence that these guys actually know
16:25
of an imminent war that's coming and
16:27
that we're gonna have to be returning to
16:28
dog food
16:34
okay time for fact number three and that
16:37
is andrew hunter murray my fact is that
16:39
telescopes have a new telescope smell
16:41
that can break them
16:44
so you know new car smell yeah where you
16:46
have the lovely smell of a new car you
16:48
get the same with a telescope in space
16:50
you can smell things in space yeah
16:53
because there's not many molecules not
16:54
many molecules but i imagine that they
16:56
they give off the molecules if i was in
16:57
space with my massive shark nose
17:00
yeah exactly yeah yeah so this is
17:02
something called outgassing
17:04
which is where if you've built something
17:06
using particular chemicals they give off
17:08
uh volatile chemicals they're called
17:10
vocs volatile organic compounds
17:12
unfortunately telescopes are so
17:14
sensitive these days
17:15
that if they give off the chemicals um
17:17
it can literally break them
17:19
and all the the vocs get stuck on the
17:23
optical surfaces of the telescope and
17:24
that ruins what you're seeing through it
17:26
so yeah what are you saying they're
17:28
called vocs what's that stand for
17:30
volatile organic compounds oh right
17:32
bacon has them as well really yeah
17:34
there's 150 volatile organic compounds
17:37
that contribute to bacon's meaty aroma
17:40
and these compounds are um given off by
17:43
bacon but they're not really given off
17:44
by harm or gammon or whatever and that's
17:46
kind of why bacon is so much tastier not
17:48
sure why but yeah it's also why you
17:50
don't get any space telescopes made of
17:51
bacon
17:55
so about smell okay um you can smell
17:57
danger
17:59
okay uh everyone has this ability or
18:01
most people do
18:03
um volunteers um who couldn't tell the
18:05
difference between two similar smells so
18:07
it's like bacon and bacony smell fake
18:10
bacon yeah bacon and faken um then if
18:13
they were given an electric shock from
18:15
one of them
18:16
and then not the other one then later
18:18
they could distinguish the two different
18:19
smells because they remembered the
18:21
electric shock that they had that is
18:23
really cool yeah right
18:25
but wait what does that have to do with
18:26
smelling danger i thought you meant if
18:28
i'm walking on the street and there was
18:29
a mugging going on behind the alley
18:31
i couldn't see it i could smell danger
18:33
yeah it's not quite so it's not quite ah
18:36
whereas if you had been approached by
18:38
two people who smelled very very similar
18:41
and one of them had mugged you yeah
18:43
later later on you'd be able to tell
18:45
which of the muggers there was actually
18:47
don't they say that when they do lineups
18:49
with police um you know when they do a
18:51
police lineup and they bring someone who
18:52
is at the scene at the crime
18:54
something new that they've started
18:55
trying out is to get them to close their
18:57
eyes and go purely by the smell because
18:59
smells actually a really big thing wow i
19:01
was going to ask if there had been any
19:02
police lineups which only used smell and
19:04
completely dispensed with the visual
19:06
element of it if you were blind and you
19:08
were mugged maybe that maybe that would
19:09
be a thing maybe they smelled of oak you
19:11
know something like that
19:14
were you mug are you being mugged by a
19:15
tree
19:18
that'd be a great lineup five men one
19:20
tree yeah i know who it was immediately
19:23
no i don't need to do the smell test
19:25
honestly
19:26
smells of oak like a wine as well
19:29
the man who mugged me i'd say he was
19:30
five foot nine with notes of citrus
19:34
he was fruity full-bodied
19:40
uh i was going to say that the only
19:42
scent to win an eu trademark is the
19:44
smell of freshly cut grass and that was
19:47
registered by a dutch perfume company
19:49
and it uses it to give tennis balls
19:51
their aroma when we did this fact i was
19:53
like i'm desperate to know what that
19:54
amazing smell is when you click open on
19:56
youtube of tennis balls and it smells so
19:58
delicious it's the best part of a game
19:59
of tennis
20:00
and i couldn't how good are you at
20:02
tennis
20:06
anyway the company that sprays these
20:07
balls for the smell of freshly cut grass
20:09
has trademarked that smell with the eu
20:11
that's very cool yeah
20:12
um
20:14
smells in space we're talking about
20:16
because of this
20:17
telescope there's an artist called
20:19
carrie patterson uh who wants to send
20:22
messages to aliens but include smells in
20:25
them as well
20:26
um so the idea is you know we would send
20:28
like these uh messages with pictures of
20:30
humans or which planet we're from and
20:32
stuff like this she thinks that we
20:33
should send smells as well in case the
20:34
aliens are particularly good with smells
20:37
like a dog or a or a shark or whatever
20:40
and she wants to send smells of animal
20:42
blood and feces
20:45
that's a good welcoming message visit
20:47
any time
20:49
i see you've moved into the neighborhood
20:52
but even if we send nice smells how do
20:54
we know that their excrement doesn't
20:55
smell like freshly opened tennis balls
20:57
and therefore this would be a huge
20:59
insult yeah
21:02
so also also benzene to show our global
21:04
dependence on the car and the blood and
21:07
feces is to show that we have like um
21:09
carbon based life forms this explains
21:12
why that got left on my doorstep the
21:13
other day someone was trying to explain
21:14
to me that we're carbon-based life forms
21:17
oh that's great
21:18
[Laughter]
21:22
um telescopes yeah yeah there is a
21:25
telescope called the ice cube telescope
21:28
um i don't know if you guys know about
21:29
this which is buried a mile under the
21:31
ice in antarctica and yeah that's cool
21:34
it's the other one that's looking for
21:35
gravity waves it's looking for neutrinos
21:39
it actually has so i think the only
21:40
place that we had um detected neutrinos
21:43
was from the sun until a couple of years
21:44
ago and then they used this telescope to
21:46
find detect 28 neutrinos under the ice
21:49
in antarctica 28. built a telescope and
21:51
buried at a mile deep for 28 neutrinos
21:53
that's right yeah uh what are neutrinos
21:56
uh they're totally neutral particles
21:58
that
21:59
were theoretical for ages and they fired
22:02
out from the sun and there's billions of
22:04
them passing through your body every
22:05
second wow yeah and also they don't
22:07
really react with anything yes wow wow
22:10
just very quickly we should say how they
22:12
fixed the uh new telescope smell
22:14
breaking it problem oh yeah yeah um they
22:16
use a
22:18
spray paint made of this chemical called
22:20
zeolite which i'd never heard of before
22:22
it doesn't absorb the chemicals given
22:24
off it adsorbs them which means it
22:26
reacts chemically and binds to them so
22:28
yeah they they clean telescopes or they
22:30
clean telescope mirrors using snow spray
22:32
don't they um firing a spray of very
22:35
fine snow particles all right so not
22:37
that stuff that you spray on your window
22:38
to make it look festive no not the stuff
22:40
he's been on the christmas tree that
22:42
would ruin the telescope ghastly mix up
22:44
and that has been another 500 million
22:45
dollars
22:48
because the intern in the office heard a
22:50
qi factoid on the podcast
22:53
just do these guys a favor and polish
22:54
this um no they spray
22:57
special uh snow which is made of carbon
23:00
dioxide at the mirror and then it
23:01
freezes and creates little snowflakes
23:03
and then when the snowflakes slide down
23:04
it takes any little tiny particles of
23:06
dust and dirt with it that is amazing
23:08
that's very cool that is very cool um
23:10
you know the um you know uh jean
23:13
shoemaker the very famous spotted a lot
23:16
of comets i think famously the one that
23:18
impacted on jupiter so also there was
23:21
one called schumacher levy which went
23:23
past the earth a few years ago yes
23:24
exactly yeah so
23:26
he he worked a lot with his wife um
23:28
carolyn shoemaker to um to find um all
23:32
of these comments out in space do you
23:33
know how they found all these comments
23:35
using what
23:37
uh telescope no
23:39
microscope
23:40
really so they would take all the images
23:42
from the telescope but they were so
23:44
grainy and so small that they would use
23:46
a microscope and using the microscope
23:48
that's how they would eventually spot
23:50
all of the comets wow that's pretty cool
23:52
yeah
23:53
mirrors are obviously a really vital
23:54
part of telescopes now and i read
23:57
that if you put a mirror
24:00
half a light year away from earth and
24:03
then you looked at it through a
24:04
telescope you can see a year into the
24:07
earth's past how cool is that we should
24:09
plant a mirror half a light year away
24:11
the great thing about that is whenever i
24:13
look in the mirror in the morning i
24:14
always look so old there you go so you
24:17
would like a year younger yeah maybe put
24:18
it even further away james for you i
24:20
would say maybe a few light years away
24:28
okay time for a final fact of the show
24:30
and that's my fact my fact this week is
24:32
that there is a museum in north korea
24:34
that has a scaled down replica of the
24:36
world's largest table
24:38
what from what i'm told it's been scaled
24:40
down to the size of a normal table
24:42
so this fact actually got sent in to us
24:45
via our email a podcast at qi.com and it
24:48
was sent to us by a guy called ian
24:49
kimball
24:50
and he said in episode 50 we started
24:52
talking about my favorite table which
24:55
was going to be a side podcast anna
24:57
chazinski's favorite tables
24:59
um and he was in north korea and he went
25:02
to a thing called the national
25:02
friendship exhibition and that's
25:04
basically an exhibition where they show
25:07
all the presents that have been given to
25:08
north korea by countries around the
25:10
world to show to the north koreans how
25:11
loved they are by the rest of the world
25:14
and he wrote a blog about it and in this
25:16
blog he included amongst the other
25:18
things in his list the table and it's
25:20
one of those things where i've been
25:21
googling it and i can't actually find
25:24
verification that the table exists um so
25:27
i'm taking his word for it here
25:29
which is a bit dangerous but um
25:31
i don't think first first-hand research
25:33
sounds about right yeah exactly
25:35
i tried to find out what the largest
25:36
table in the world is
25:38
and there are a few different records
25:40
okay so
25:41
there's the longest table in the world
25:43
which was broken this month it was
25:45
broken in july 2015. um sorry the table
25:48
was broken no sorry the record the
25:50
record was broken right um it was 1500
25:54
meters long there's an iftar table which
25:56
is the meal uh for when muslims break
25:58
ramadan they're fast it's a very very
26:00
very very long table excuse me can you
26:03
pass the salt
26:06
um and there's also the largest desk in
26:08
the world which is in a new york
26:09
marketing firm's office and which can
26:10
seat 125 employees wow yeah and it goes
26:14
through the entire office and it ramps
26:15
up and it's sort of made from a single
26:17
piece of resin that was poured into the
26:19
cast or however wow so you know there's
26:22
a bit here where a certain department
26:23
sits but then it banks up to the floor
26:25
above and then swoops around and it's
26:27
very very cool so cool yeah it's really
26:28
cool um so there's you can get an app
26:31
now which is a tourist guide to north
26:33
korea so it's a north korea travel app
26:35
it's not condoned by north korea it's
26:36
built in britain and it contains
26:38
genuinely quite useful advice about
26:40
traveling there
26:42
so they for instance talk about the
26:43
rajin zoo
26:45
saying best known as world's worst zoo
26:47
where the attractions are three ducks a
26:48
turkey some elusive foxes and a drawing
26:50
of a monkey they've also actually
26:52
drawing of a monkey
26:56
that's a great great zoo
26:59
it saves on feed doesn't it it
27:01
definitely does it's got a drawing of a
27:02
monkey you just need to give it a you
27:04
know a drawing of a banana
27:09
um just on this north korea app it just
27:11
has some other good travel advice you
27:13
can get um it suggests that you bribe
27:15
your guide by bringing him really good
27:16
quality alcohol um and then he'll be
27:18
more likely to uh give you a better tour
27:21
but it does say don't ask your guide any
27:23
difficult questions because guides will
27:25
be blamed for tourists who cause trouble
27:27
so if you've been guided around north
27:28
korea yeah don't start a fight or
27:30
anything and it acknowledges it says um
27:32
most of the guides will be aware of the
27:34
inaccuracies of their government's line
27:35
on things but try not to embarrass them
27:37
by challenging them i think that's fair
27:39
it's just polite isn't it yeah yeah nod
27:41
and smile um it describes the people's
27:44
army circus as a circus that you can
27:47
visit they've got a drawing of a clown
27:50
it says this circus very rarely features
27:52
any animals but does almost always
27:54
feature an anti-american clown show
27:58
american club what if that's your bag
28:00
yeah well i mean i would be interested
28:01
to see what that involves yeah something
28:04
about weird uh museums yeah you're
28:06
saying uh in kansas you can find a place
28:10
called the world's largest collection of
28:12
the world's smallest versions of the
28:13
world's largest things
28:16
which is a traveling museum wow what
28:19
happens is they find out about a world's
28:21
largest thing
28:23
and then they document it usually by
28:25
going to visit it and then they make a
28:26
tiny version of it damn it i thought you
28:29
were gonna say then they make the
28:30
machine from honey i shrunk the kids and
28:31
fire it at the thing
28:33
and take it away with them god those
28:35
were great films they were fantastic
28:37
rick moranis yes
28:39
so to make these smaller versions they
28:41
they say that they have to find
28:43
materials that are most appropriate but
28:46
that they can find
28:47
so the world's smallest version of the
28:49
world's largest ball of rubber bands is
28:52
made of miniature rubber bands
28:53
[Laughter]
28:55
and weirdly the world's smallest version
28:57
of the world's largest otter is made
29:00
from a dash and figurine cut in two
29:02
filled in with modelling clay wow
29:05
sounds great very creative
29:09
another museum and i've mentioned this
29:11
previously on the podcast that in
29:13
georgia that there was a museum
29:14
dedicated to elvis in which one of the
29:16
displays was maybe elvis's toenail uh
29:20
this lady um
29:21
found it uh in a carpet when she was at
29:25
graceland
29:26
uh in the jungle room and she got to the
29:28
ground because she wanted to feel where
29:30
elvis would have walked and she came
29:31
across this toenail and thought it must
29:32
be his but she can't verify it but she
29:35
put it into her own elvis museum that
29:37
she's opened which is called the louder
29:38
milk boarding house museum
29:40
uh it contains 30 000 elvis presley
29:43
artifacts possibly 29 999
29:47
i mean how many others were maybe this
29:49
belonged to elvis it appeared slightly
29:51
near him on one occasion well she has a
29:53
vial of sweat
29:54
um she has a wart and actually a lot of
29:57
people she says come to her and say
30:00
could you donate the wart to science so
30:02
that they could clone elvis and she says
30:05
it wouldn't be right he wouldn't be he
30:07
wouldn't be happy
30:09
which is rich coming from someone who's
30:11
collecting body parts i believe actually
30:13
um elvis himself is in that museum well
30:16
a drawing of him
30:18
yeah
30:18
potato potato but if you cloned him from
30:20
a war wouldn't he just be an enormous
30:22
ward
30:26
with funny hair i don't think that's
30:27
quite how clothing works when they
30:30
um cloned dolly the sheep which came
30:32
from a bit of a mammary gland it wasn't
30:33
just an enormous sheep lovely yeah
30:36
exactly oh big willy breast
30:39
she also has a elvis hair button which
30:42
has the hair of elves in it donated to
30:44
her by elvis's barber next to it she
30:46
also has a cease and desist letter from
30:48
selling elvis presley hair buttons
30:51
because she started manufacturing and
30:53
selling them and uh legal action was
30:55
threatened again what did she put sort
30:57
of one hair in each button or something
30:58
exactly oh come on yeah the old boat
31:02
store cafe in cornwall has the museum of
31:04
celebrity leftovers
31:07
and their exhibits include an actress
31:10
called mia vasikovska
31:12
i've never heard of um a courgette from
31:14
her soup is on display there and there
31:17
is a piece of prince charles's bread
31:20
pudding which he chose to leave
31:21
unfinished one time
31:23
and a few other exhibits wow oh god i
31:26
think i i really like these little
31:28
museums i think they all serve an
31:30
interesting unneeded purpose but yeah
31:32
i'm happy they exist i'm i'm not sure
31:34
they're all museums
31:37
well one day because like you know for
31:39
example um they have bits of hair from
31:42
in the smithsonian i think it is from 14
31:44
presidents and you know at the time that
31:46
was are they bitter or they just hair
31:48
that was found in a carpet vaguely near
31:50
someone where they gave each one all
31:52
belong to elvis
31:53
so yeah yeah well it's interesting what
31:55
is a museum and what isn't because
31:58
museum is just a collection of
31:59
interesting artifacts or culturally
32:00
significant artifacts or historical
32:02
artifacts so yeah these are definitely
32:03
museums but there's a museum in it's
32:06
either in tasmania yeah it's in tasmania
32:08
and i can't remember what it's called
32:09
but it's a museum that's made up
32:11
entirely of stolen tiny little bits from
32:14
other famous bits of museum exhibits so
32:17
it's really a british museum
32:24

00:06
[Music]
00:10
[Applause]
00:12
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:15
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:18
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:20
coverent garden my name is dan schreiber
00:22
i'm sitting here with anna chazinski and
00:24
miller and james harkin and once again
00:26
we have gathered around the microphones
00:28
with our four favorite facts from the
00:29
last seven days and in no particular
00:31
order here we go starting with you
00:34
chozinski
00:35
my fact this week is that as part of the
00:38
preparation for the d-day landings the
00:40
allies used condoms to collect soil and
00:42
sand from the normandy beaches why
00:46
because they just felt like it so this
00:48
was called operation postage able which
00:50
was the operation that preceded the
00:52
d-day landings to check that they they
00:53
were going to work and it involved
00:56
sending allied forces out under the
00:58
cover of night in mini submarines uh and
01:01
then getting them to swim to the beach
01:02
with a bunch of condoms and scoop up
01:05
lots of sand in them because i guess
01:06
condoms are just a useful receptacle i
01:07
think they ran out of buck i think they
01:09
started off with you know some sort of
01:10
tupperware and ran out um and ended up
01:13
using condoms and it was to check that
01:14
the sand wasn't gonna be difficult to
01:17
walk on was to check that it wasn't the
01:19
wrong kind of sand yeah i think they
01:21
suspected that it was kind of a sort of
01:22
sinking sand oh okay right so they ran
01:25
out of buckets so they use condoms
01:26
obviously yeah that doesn't work so much
01:28
if you're building sand castles
01:30
just a tough tip
01:32
that's true it also doesn't work the
01:34
other way around you can't supply in a
01:35
bucket for a condom
01:37
exactly
01:38
so um why condoms i mean like there must
01:42
have been other things we could have
01:43
used i honestly think they are just a
01:45
useful yeah receptacle i don't really
01:48
know why we don't use them for more
01:49
stuff yeah i mean they squish up so
01:51
small and then they expand so huge so a
01:53
lot of survival
01:54
um advisors say you should use them to
01:57
as a water receptacle and you should put
01:58
it inside a sock because it's not that
02:00
strong so it can get quite easily
02:01
pricked i'm not going shopping with you
02:03
if you think that condoms can be used
02:05
for any kind of receptacle
02:07
the weekly shot would you like a bag no
02:09
i brought my own
02:12
they have been making counterfeit
02:13
condoms in china and um it's so weird
02:15
because you how do you counterfeit a
02:16
condom but i think they're not
02:18
regulations
02:19
they're just
02:20
yep um
02:22
and they've put vegetable oil in them to
02:24
make it seem like they've got spermicide
02:25
in them to give it that same slippery
02:27
quality
02:29
about the spray-on condom
02:31
no
02:32
i heard the spray-on t-shirt it was like
02:34
a aerosol but it made a fabric so you
02:36
sprayed it on and it made the fabric as
02:38
it sprayed you couldn't make a spray on
02:40
anything if you'd i mean no but this was
02:43
this was it was in 2006 um the institute
02:45
for condom consultancy who created it
02:49
and it was inspired by the mechanics of
02:50
a drive-through car wash
02:52
so the idea is that
02:54
a gentleman's member would be uh
02:57
inserted into a chair into a car wash
02:58
yeah it's kind of like a little chamber
03:00
it's like a mini car wash and nozzles
03:02
would apply a coat of fast drying liquid
03:04
no that's latex and that would go all
03:07
around the guy comes out to clean the
03:08
windscreens
03:09
[Laughter]
03:10
so the prototype meant that you could
03:12
change sizes and everything which so
03:14
they thought it would appeal to men who
03:16
find difficulty finding it would appeal
03:18
to men mostly
03:20
exactly but they had several problems
03:21
with it one was that it had a two to
03:23
three minute drawing process which they
03:25
thought kind of killed the mood
03:28
the other mood killer was the loud
03:29
hitting voice
03:31
of latex being burnt and also having to
03:34
buy tokens in the garage before you
03:36
start
03:36
[Laughter]
03:38
exactly
03:39
what's the point so is that sort of a
03:42
green and uh recycling friendly thing i
03:44
think it was just an innovation for how
03:46
you could sort of have
03:48
you can make your own condoms diy
03:50
condoms i think it shows not all
03:52
innovation is helpful
03:53
[Laughter]
03:55
um
03:56
other
03:57
uses for condoms in other wartime uses
04:00
for condoms they were used in the second
04:02
world war to protect rifles from water
04:05
so you cover the barrel of your rifle
04:06
with a condom okay useful um they're
04:09
often used by engineers apparently i
04:11
must ask my engineer friend about this
04:12
to keep soil dry and they're commonly
04:15
used apparently in the film industry if
04:17
you're doing underwater filming to keep
04:18
microphones dry yes i've heard of this
04:21
yeah really yeah yeah only 25 of condoms
04:24
in india are used for the correct use
04:27
really yeah the rest to collect sand uh
04:29
no other uses include giving a smooth
04:32
finish and shine to silk saris
04:35
and also cutting and spreading them on
04:38
roads mixing them with tar concrete to
04:40
make more waterproof tar wow you need a
04:43
lot of condoms to cover a road well
04:45
that's why 25 are only used for the
04:47
proper way because that so many are used
04:49
for roads and also in other construction
04:50
they use it
04:51
wow wow
04:54
and pensioners in south africa have
04:56
started to rub condoms on their knees to
04:58
ease arthritic pain oh my god if i ever
05:01
go on desert island discs that will be
05:02
my luxury item now
05:05
this seems like the most practical thing
05:06
you could bring anyway it's quite funny
05:07
because you're left alone
05:12
it's going to sound like real wishful
05:13
thinking
05:15
it'd be the weirdest moment if a woman
05:17
did wash up after 10 years
05:19
i'm sorry i don't have any left i've
05:21
been using them for soil samples and my
05:23
arthritic knees
05:24
i'm carrying my wardrobe like i'm gonna
05:26
waste what i'm having sex with you
05:29
what are you talking about
05:31
um do you guys know there's a restaurant
05:32
called cabbages and condoms that hands
05:34
out condoms that instead of after dinner
05:36
mints
05:37
wow quite an interesting approach and
05:39
also i had to read it read about um
05:41
options people who are too embarrassed
05:42
to buy condoms and there's a company i
05:43
just like its name it's called johnny's
05:45
in a jiffy and they sell condoms over
05:47
the internet
05:48
their tagline is we come before you
05:50
do oh
05:52
that's very good it's um just those
05:54
little nice little taglines that they
05:56
like to constantly use um
05:58
celebrity condoms is a thing which is
06:01
very surprising there was a daft punk
06:03
celebrity condom no jls had them didn't
06:05
jls had them dark punks was called uh
06:08
get lucky condoms oh yeah makes a lot of
06:10
sense um
06:11
jls they had each member on a separate
06:14
box of condoms when you say member
06:16
[Laughter]
06:18
so you could decide which favorite jls
06:21
person you'd want to use right from the
06:22
shop i think we should do our own
06:25
no such thing as a fish no such thing as
06:26
an unwanted pregnancy
06:30
that's a serious
06:31
serious act
06:33
is darf punk's condom is that um opaque
06:36
so that you can't identify the penis it
06:38
belongs to yes it's a big helmet sorry
06:41
it's back to buckets again
06:43
so a few years ago five thousand happy
06:45
meals from mcdonald's
06:47
were accidentally sent out with colored
06:49
condoms instead of a plastic toy from
06:51
the movie the last airbender and
06:53
basically there was just a huge
06:54
misunderstanding so five thousand
06:57
children were opening up their happy
06:58
meals and was there a kind of confusion
07:01
imagine you're in the bedroom
07:04
you're condom there's the last airbender
07:09
let's just play with this it's much more
07:10
fun
07:12
this is the best contraceptive ever
07:14
but having any sex though
07:18
um so we've got evidence of condoms that
07:19
goes back to 13 000 bc
07:22
in a cave painting which is quite cool i
07:25
think it's in a cave painting in france
07:27
uh in the grot de
07:30
and it shows a man who looks like he's
07:32
standing there with a condom over
07:33
himself probably made of animal skin
07:35
over himself over his whole body they
07:36
hadn't quite mastered
07:40
wow really wow yeah is it it's
07:43
definitely
07:44
what it what we think it is well i mean
07:46
all we have is that picture that looks
07:47
like he's got a covering over his willy
07:48
but why else would you do that could be
07:50
a last airbender tie we're not quite
07:52
sure
07:55
um some stuff about d-day sure um did
07:58
you know that in 1943 when so we started
08:01
planning the d-day invasions very very
08:03
early on which obviously were in june
08:04
1944. in 1943 an early copy of the plans
08:07
for them blew out of the window of
08:09
norfolk house in london and was found on
08:12
the street by a short-sighted old man
08:14
who went and handed it in and said i
08:15
don't know what these are i can't really
08:16
read them because my eyesight's not very
08:18
good yeah
08:19
i said my eyes are just good enough so i
08:21
can see the bits of paper but not quite
08:23
good enough that i can take anything
08:25
that's on there yeah i can see the
08:26
address on the top of the paper that
08:29
tells me it's this building okay i
08:31
always think it must have been so
08:32
exciting you know in so code words were
08:35
transmitted over the radio as a signals
08:38
to very like your various allies in the
08:40
war that you were going to launch an
08:41
attack for instance so on radio london i
08:44
think a code word was transmitted to
08:47
uh make the resistance fighters aware
08:49
that d-day was about to happen in the
08:50
next 24 hours and i just think that must
08:52
have been the coolest thing so i think
08:53
the code for that was a poem the first
08:55
stanza of paul verland's poem chancellor
08:58
d'ortom as in the song of autumn and
09:00
that was the signal that the dj landings
09:01
were going to happen within the next 24
09:02
hours wow that must have been the
09:03
coolest thing yeah you're listening to
09:05
the radio and you'll go oh my god it's
09:06
happening uh shall we talk about soil
09:09
and mud and stuff because um according
09:12
to britain's leading earth sciences
09:14
organization the geological society 2015
09:17
is the year of mud
09:19
isn't it yeah didn't know that what are
09:21
we supposed to do uh i think it's to
09:23
celebrate what an important and
09:25
ubiquitous substance mud is
09:28
is mud important
09:29
yeah it makes you happy do you know that
09:32
playing in the mud as a microscopic
09:34
bacteria called mycobacterium vase um
09:37
and they increase serotonin which makes
09:39
you relaxed and calm
09:42
that explains a lot of glastonbury
09:44
photos i've seen over the years all the
09:46
mud but they don't matter
09:47
you thought it was the
09:48
drugs just the mind just the mud
09:52
one tablespoon of soil contains more
09:54
organisms than there are people on earth
09:57
which is wow extraordinary right
10:01
more living things in that than there
10:02
are human beings and 15 tons of soil
10:05
passes through an earthworm each year
10:08
they eat and pull out yeah oh okay
10:10
wow that's cool i once read and i'm not
10:13
sure if it's even true that if you get a
10:15
field full of cows then the weight of
10:17
earthworms underneath the ground will be
10:20
heavier than the weight of cows above
10:22
the ground no matter how many cows you
10:23
have really yeah because you couldn't
10:25
fit enough cows next to each other i
10:27
don't know if it's true but yeah well
10:29
1.4 million earthworms is the average
10:31
number of earthworms you get an acre of
10:33
land okay and what's the average way to
10:34
do it
10:36
let's all work this out guys i think
10:37
this is going to be fun um while you're
10:39
working it you know acres from an old
10:41
english word that meant an open field of
10:42
no particular measurements
10:44
so you could just be like yeah i've got
10:46
acres of land around my house
10:48
um scientists have invented transparent
10:50
soil oh yeah i saw that it's really
10:52
really really really cool yeah it's so
10:54
that you can plant a plant in there and
10:56
you can see the roots grow that's the
10:58
coolest it's a good idea that's
10:59
incredible really cool that's a thing
11:01
called uh nafion which they are poly
11:03
synthetic polymer also used for
11:04
batteries
11:05
right so it's not really soil it's it's
11:07
plants brewer potato potato
11:11
both of which are grown in soil
11:16
yes okay there we go
11:18
should we move on i have one last thing
11:20
i just want to quickly mention before we
11:21
move on just a movie recommendation i
11:23
haven't seen it yet but it sounds
11:24
fantastic a movie called killer condom
11:28
uh the tagline the rubber that rubs you
11:31
out set in the cd parts of new york city
11:33
killer condom follows gay detective
11:35
luigi macaroni who has been hired to
11:37
investigate a series of bizarre attacks
11:39
at the hotel quickie in which male
11:41
guests have all had their penises
11:43
mysteriously bitten off well i'm just
11:45
going out on a limb here but is luigi
11:47
macaroni an italian character i think
11:49
he's an italian
11:51
detective so we don't know if they catch
11:53
the condom you should watch that spoiler
11:55
alert i haven't seen this movie yet guys
11:57
i'm gonna give that away
12:00
[Applause]
12:01
okay time for fact number two and that
12:03
is my fact my fact this week is that
12:06
every second a star in the universe
12:09
explodes
12:10
every second every second oh my god by
12:12
the time you told this fact how many yep
12:14
uh right now we've lost
12:16
there star somewhere in the universe has
12:19
exploded i read a different article as
12:21
well that suggested that up to 30 stars
12:23
in the universe explode every second but
12:26
i think it's safer to say at least one
12:28
yeah
12:29
this kind of so actually just
12:31
researching this whole fact i found
12:32
really unpleasant because i just it just
12:34
terrifies the life out of me you know
12:36
whenever you read any of the facts
12:38
related to this kind of stuff the
12:39
massiveness of it all is horrifying the
12:42
reason i like this fact so much just as
12:44
a thought experiment is
12:46
we can fit a million of our earths into
12:49
our sun size-wise that's the equivalent
12:52
uh our sun is quite a small sun in
12:55
comparison to the majority of suns out
12:57
there and so just the idea of one of
13:00
these things exploding there's a lot of
13:01
damage when a star explodes the idea
13:03
that that's happening every second of
13:05
every day yeah i mean that's over 46 000
13:08
stars a day yeah exploding but but
13:10
they're really rare i mean comparatively
13:13
rare even though there's one a second
13:14
yeah
13:15
the last one in our galaxy was 1604 but
13:18
it was almost as bright as jupiter i
13:19
think that's the last one we could see
13:20
yeah the lesson we observed wow so they
13:22
think that in every galaxy you get one
13:24
or two a century don't they yeah but i i
13:27
find this extraordinary as well that the
13:28
last one that we saw was yeah 1604 and
13:31
kepler saw that and the last one that
13:32
was seen in our galaxy before that was
13:34
tycho by tycho brahi who you know was
13:36
kepler's tutor and no one's seen one in
13:38
our galaxy since wow that's i find that
13:41
bizarre if you didn't know better you'd
13:43
say they were making it up wouldn't you
13:44
they could be but we've investigated
13:46
their claims and we have evidence that
13:48
they weren't and we're still using the
13:50
remnants of kepler's supernova that he
13:52
witnessed in 1604 so he wrote it down
13:54
very clearly what he was seeing over a
13:56
period of time and we can still use his
13:58
observations to study it now because we
13:59
can still see the remnants of that
14:01
supernova now and we know exactly what
14:03
kind of supernova it was and we can
14:05
actually use that his observations to
14:07
work out how fast the universe is
14:09
expanding it's like a time marker in the
14:11
universe that tells us how fast the
14:12
universe is expanding did he actually
14:14
see the
14:15
supernova explode uh well a new star
14:18
appears doesn't it they saw the
14:19
brightness it was a supernova in 1006
14:21
that was so bright people could read
14:22
their manuscripts at midnight
14:24
no wow that sounds isn't that cool that
14:26
sounds that sounds like a me fact
14:29
i read that there's certain patches of
14:30
the ocean that is so
14:32
at the surface filled with um little
14:35
algae and animals that are
14:37
bioluminescent that you could actually
14:38
read a newspaper on your boat it's so
14:41
bright the surrounding supposedly during
14:43
world war ii when they had blackouts in
14:45
japan they would take bioluminescent
14:47
creatures out of the sea and put them in
14:48
like jam jars and use them as like
14:51
lights and read things from them which
14:52
is so romantic or condoms when the jam
14:54
jars
14:58
wow that's amazing is that true that's
15:00
definitely true a supernova allowed us
15:02
to read in the middle of the night yeah
15:04
they really they burn really bright so
15:06
one day we might be in the middle of the
15:08
night and it will just light up yeah
15:09
yeah that's a supernova there are 16
15:12
candidates i read that for future
15:13
supernovas and our galaxy juice is the
15:15
nearest would be apparently spectacular
15:17
if that one goes and excitingly it's
15:20
definitely going to explode sometime
15:22
within the next
15:23
100 million years oh
15:28
i think if you say beetlejuice three
15:30
times it explodes
15:31
no more times guys um yeah because you
15:33
can see uh beetlejuice anyway like just
15:36
with your naked eye so imagine how light
15:38
it will be when it
15:39
oh my goodness you'll be reading all
15:42
night yeah yeah they can be far away and
15:44
you cannot notice so there was a um
15:46
brilliant thing in january 2011 a 10
15:48
year old canadian girl discovered a
15:49
supernova she was looking at pictures on
15:50
her computer and spotted one did she say
15:52
that's a supernova what did you say
15:55
what's that
15:56
yeah well there's a guy in australia so
15:58
bill bryson's book short history nearly
16:00
everything and they call him the
16:01
supernova spotter because
16:03
bill bryson basically says that throw a
16:05
bunch of sand onto a table have him
16:07
stare at it and stir it and stir it take
16:09
him away remove a single grain let him
16:12
turn back and he'll tell you that that
16:14
grain is gone like he can have just and
16:16
he spots supernova by just looking at
16:18
the night sky with the telescope it
16:19
would have gone nuts in tennessee this
16:22
is james doesn't believe this i mean so
16:24
that's a down fact
16:26
the difference
16:28
i can imagine walking onto the d-day
16:30
beaches
16:32
wait a minute there's a condoms worth of
16:33
sand missing here that grain that grain
16:36
that grain
16:39
yeah maybe i've uh sexed that story up a
16:41
bit
16:43
i mean maybe it's true i don't know yeah
16:45
i'm sure i'm sure he claims it sounds
16:47
like the kind of thing a wacky guy in
16:48
australia might play right
16:51
so do you know how far away you know
16:52
people say you can see like millions and
16:54
millions of stars i think you know i
16:56
think it's like four roughly four
16:57
thousand stars is pretty much the
16:59
maximum number of stars you'll ever see
17:00
in the sky right do you know how far
17:01
away we're seeing when we look up to the
17:03
sky no
17:04
we are seeing
17:06
19
17:07
i think that is quadrillion whoa miles
17:10
away okay well then why am i wearing
17:11
glasses to see i know two views away tv
17:15
screen when i'm on a couch and i can see
17:17
a star
17:18
19 quadrillion miles away no i don't
17:20
really understand it
17:23
you should ask that next time you go to
17:24
the opticians you should say i can't
17:25
read that but would you mind placing
17:26
that 19 quadrillion miles from me
17:28
because
17:29
i appear to be extremely extremely
17:31
extremely long-sighted
17:32
[Laughter]
17:35
that is amazing though
17:37
isn't it
17:38
our tiny little eyes are taking in light
17:39
from that far away yeah
17:41
so good thing about supernovas is that
17:44
is the only place where um sort of more
17:47
complicated elements than hydrogen and
17:49
helium can be born
17:51
and so the human body is mostly made of
17:53
like carbon nitrogen oxygen a few other
17:55
things and they will all have been made
17:57
in supernovas so basically your whole
17:59
body was created in a supernova yeah so
18:02
this is something that was freaking me
18:03
out on the bus to work this morning when
18:04
i just been reading this and i was
18:05
looking at a boris bike stop and i was
18:07
staring this metal and this broke boris
18:09
bike stuff i was like
18:11
you came from a star that doesn't make
18:13
any sense it terrifies me everything
18:16
you're looking at was born inside a star
18:18
yep
18:19
mental um explosions in space different
18:22
kind of stars
18:24
sometimes really absolutely stunned
18:26
scientists they have no idea what to
18:28
make of it so
18:29
for example in 1979
18:32
they found an explosion that was 50
18:34
times more intense than anything
18:36
previously recorded it was a 180 000
18:38
light years away and no one knew what it
18:41
was and the people at nasa and other
18:43
leading scientists said that the odd
18:45
thing about it was that its source was
18:47
an area of only 187 miles in diameter
18:49
with a whole lot of energy erupting in
18:51
fairly small sector it resembled a
18:53
high-energy bomb blast and they
18:55
basically said it was unlike anything
18:57
we've seen in space star wars exactly
18:59
they thought that what they they were
19:00
saying basically like we know it won't
19:02
be this but what it looked like was we
19:04
were witnessing an intergalactic battle
19:06
between giant ships right and this has
19:09
led to star wars theory which has been
19:11
going since the late 70s i mean it turns
19:14
out we know what it was now it's a new
19:15
kind of star that they hadn't yet
19:16
previously detected but since 1979
19:19
there's a great conspiracy theory that
19:21
has been running you can still see
19:22
online star wars theory that we
19:24
witnessed an intergalactic battle and
19:26
the government's been covering it up
19:27
ever since it's very exciting this is
19:30
like i think that's on the same level as
19:31
which is fictional in harry potter when
19:33
they have uh say they're following a
19:35
fight in the sky and there's a line
19:37
about oh they think of the muggles down
19:38
below thinking of fireworks so we see
19:40
fireworks yeah
19:41
see just voldemort what do you mean see
19:45
i think that's proved my point i forgot
19:46
for a second she was talking fiction
19:50
[Applause]
19:50
[Music]
19:52
okay time for fact number three and that
19:55
is james my fact this week is that the
19:58
tlattle camila cannibals of ancient
20:00
mexico at their human flesh with chili
20:03
sauce
20:04
yum hmm yeah how do we know that so
20:08
um we found some bones of humans uh and
20:11
the bones have kind of been chipped with
20:13
tools and and nod on a little bit so we
20:15
know that well we think that they were
20:17
eaten by humans
20:18
and they're also stained with uh chili
20:20
sauce they have the stains of the spices
20:22
on the bones wow so they assumed that
20:25
they were marinated before eaten well
20:27
you would wouldn't you yeah it made
20:28
sense yeah this is a study um from two
20:31
universities one in madrid and one in
20:33
mexico and these um cannibals were
20:36
living about 2 500 years ago
20:39
wow
20:40
yeah it's good that yeah i like that
20:42
yeah it is because you never think about
20:44
condiments or anything when it comes to
20:47
eating humans no yeah and i think it's
20:49
prejudice of us against cannibals to
20:51
think that they don't have you know the
20:52
sensitivity of taste yeah exactly like
20:55
there's no gourmet
20:56
version like they're just gorging on
20:58
stuff no they want to have a nice meal
21:00
like some people don't even think
21:01
cannibalism properly exists like they
21:03
think okay yeah well people do eat uh
21:06
each other after war after battle or
21:08
something or they might do a real real
21:10
hardship but they they don't think that
21:12
humans would do it just naturally
21:14
because they're hungry yeah but then i
21:16
think there are a few examples of of
21:18
cultures that did so i think that does
21:20
happen yeah yeah i was reading about
21:22
survival cannibalism which is seen as
21:24
slightly more acceptable you know if
21:25
you're in a disaster and you have no
21:27
choice right or you're going to die
21:28
in the 18th and 19th century it was seen
21:30
as something that basically is an
21:31
occupational hazard of life at scene
21:33
that's just something that happens from
21:34
time to time and the customer of the sea
21:36
involved drawing straws if you drew the
21:38
second shortest straw you had to do the
21:39
killing you drew the shortest straw you
21:41
got eaten
21:42
wow that's democratic john lloyd told us
21:46
a story once which john lloyd of uh head
21:48
of qi uh he was at sea yeah he wasn't
21:51
seen
21:53
it's an occupational hazard when you
21:54
work at qi you'll accept it
21:56
now do you remember that story told us
21:57
about how um there used to be a guy that
22:00
went around towns and i don't know which
22:02
country this is but his his act was
22:05
buy tickets and he will eat a person
22:08
on stage and so yeah
22:11
he would go around to all these towns
22:12
people would pay all the money he would
22:14
sell out all these places and he'd get
22:16
on stage and they're all going what are
22:17
we going to expect what's going to
22:18
happen here and then the man said i will
22:20
now eat a person
22:22
who would like to be eaten
22:24
and of course everyone would go oh oh
22:26
god no
22:27
and so he would go well i can't do my
22:29
show unless anyone
22:31
is ready to be eaten yeah and then so no
22:33
one could return their money because he
22:35
couldn't do his act because no one was
22:37
providing could venues not specify
22:39
before you came um like you know you
22:41
need to bring your own person mate
22:42
that's true i think it was his
22:44
responsibility to provide the person
22:47
yeah it puts me in mind of um there was
22:49
a uh there was a movie in america and
22:52
they did as a publicity stunt that they
22:54
were going to give away a baby
22:56
and there was a massive massive uproar
22:58
and they they sold tickets to this baby
23:00
giveaway blah blah blah blah blah blah
23:01
and then in the end they gave away a
23:03
baby pig
23:04
oh yeah so it was all fine
23:06
it's not fine for the baby pig's mother
23:08
is it james
23:09
no is that her child ripped from her
23:11
teeth sorry adam yeah was captain cook
23:13
um he was eaten by cannibals right i
23:15
don't think so oh you don't no it's
23:17
often said that he was but i think
23:19
generally speaking now that we think
23:20
that he wasn't um they think that the
23:24
people who at him believed in the power
23:25
of human bones yeah and not to eat but
23:27
they just thought they were powerful
23:28
objects and so they boiled down his body
23:30
to get the bones and that's people saw
23:33
that happening and assumed that he was
23:34
being eaten but actually uh okay
23:37
do you know that um we got the word
23:38
cannibal from columbus do we take it
23:40
from a spanish word it was described
23:42
indigenous people in the caribbean
23:43
islands even though he didn't actually
23:44
believe the rumors that they ate people
23:46
so as you say james i don't think i've
23:48
read in the course of this research like
23:50
people eating people for sustenance
23:52
anyway it was always a ritual thing so i
23:54
think in ancient mexico you'd only eat
23:55
your enemy wouldn't you if you
23:56
slaughtered your enemy you'd eat it all
23:58
right some people would do it funeral
24:00
rights yeah it wouldn't be to live off
24:02
it's always what the neighbors do isn't
24:03
it it's always what the guys down the
24:05
road are the guys
24:08
but we also ate them here as medicine so
24:10
people you would consume bits of
24:11
egyptian mummies try and heal oh yeah
24:13
expanded to being pieces from local
24:15
cadavers
24:16
so
24:17
we were eating really bodies yeah is it
24:20
bad to eat human just i just curious
24:22
generally i know it's frowned upon but
24:24
is it bad probably the same as red meat
24:27
right yeah so uh well there are bad
24:28
things supposedly it's more likely to
24:30
give you something like variant cjd or
24:33
some kind of spongy form brain illness
24:36
okay in um papua new guinea i think they
24:39
were suffered from a disease called kuru
24:42
which is a bit like cjd
24:44
and that was thought to be because they
24:46
were eating human human brains mostly
24:48
actually yeah um
24:50
dan if you'd like to know more you might
24:52
be interested in the annual cannibal
24:53
conference for academics our papers
24:55
include guess who's coming to dinner
24:57
inside the mind of the cannibal serial
24:58
killer and bon appetit a concise defense
25:01
of cannibalism wow where does that take
25:03
place the one was in manchester that i
25:04
read about but i don't know if it's
25:05
there every year oh okay i wonder what
25:07
the catering is like yeah
25:10
when you're queuing up in the canteen
25:12
and all they have is a load of straws
25:13
then you know you're in trouble
25:15
um i was reading about animal
25:16
cannibalism because it happens a lot in
25:18
animals and uh there's an interesting
25:21
thing with salamanders so salamander
25:23
larvae um have this amazing thing where
25:25
they get very crowded and so they've
25:28
developed what's called the cannibal
25:30
morph they have wider mouths broader
25:32
heads uh lower jutting jaws and their
25:35
teeth can be three times as longer and
25:36
they eat the other ones that don't have
25:39
the cannibal more so you know how we get
25:41
paranoid during puberty you know if
25:42
someone doesn't develop their breasts
25:44
early enough or whatever these guys must
25:45
be terrified when they're going through
25:47
adolescence and they're not one of the
25:48
ones who's developing the special
25:49
cannibalistic draw yeah and your best
25:52
mate is and you're looking at him going
25:54
oh this is
25:56
um they did a study of cane toads um i
25:59
really like the title of this study it's
26:01
called deceptive digits the functional
26:04
significance of toe waving by
26:06
cannibalistic cane toads
26:08
and anyway it's about the fact that so
26:09
cane toast they uh practice cannibalism
26:11
a lot so there was one study that found
26:13
that 64 of the cane toad diet is made up
26:15
of other cane toads
26:17
yeah 64 yeah wow and they found that the
26:20
bigger ones who have decided to
26:21
cannibalize lure the smaller ones to
26:23
them by wiggling their middle toe and
26:26
make it look like a little bit of prey i
26:28
think or something about that seems to
26:29
attract smaller cane toads to them of
26:32
their own species who come and approach
26:34
them to say hey man nice wiggle and then
26:36
they eat them wow yeah and hippos hippos
26:39
practice cannibalism do they yeah which
26:41
is weird because they're vegetarians
26:44
well
26:45
i'm a vegetarian except for
26:48
i did just eat my best name
26:51
um i read an article in the from the
26:53
lancashire evening post in 1921 and it
26:57
was you know how old newspapers used to
26:58
just have rather than have them like big
27:00
long articles they just have quick
27:02
reports so they just have a quick
27:03
paragraph of update um this is just
27:04
somewhere in the middle of the newspaper
27:06
lancaster reading post 1921
27:08
brigadier general barnet in a report on
27:10
conditions in haiti declares that the
27:12
natives ate the bodies of several u.s
27:14
marines including lieutenant lawrence
27:15
smith
27:16
end of article right i just seemed like
27:18
such a throwaway tiny little oh by the
27:21
way some soldiers have been eaten in
27:22
haiti yeah uh and the weather
27:27
um can i say anything about chiles
27:29
yes so it's like
27:32
there was a study that found that uh
27:34
women like to eat chili for the spicy
27:35
feeling yeah there's men do it for
27:37
social reward linked to this um nando's
27:40
tweeted that they often get men on dates
27:41
ordering plain chicken but asking for
27:43
extra hot flags on their food
27:53
if waitresses bring it to the table they
27:56
say and we've got one plain chicken with
27:58
extra hot flags here
28:00
the mild mild with extra hot flags
28:03
anyone who used it
28:06
um there were some hot sauces names just
28:09
for fun uh pain is good sauce is a good
28:12
one great ring of fire hot
28:14
sauce another one you get in america and
28:16
the um winner of the hot sauce awards
28:19
2015 crazy bastard sauce
28:22
that's good
28:24
nice yeah could have a beneficial effect
28:26
though eating hot sauce because this guy
28:28
called randy schmitz took part in a hot
28:30
sauce chili eating competition he was
28:32
rushed to hospital because he collapsed
28:34
immediately after dabbing just a drop of
28:35
this chili called flashbang onto his
28:38
tongue one total had an mri scan had a
28:40
tumor turned out which they removed and
28:42
he's fine
28:43
great yeah in january 2013 dr ian
28:46
rothwell at the world's hottest curry
28:49
uh it took him over an hour to finish
28:51
the dish which included a 10 minute walk
28:53
down the high street weeping
28:58
no just pure chili coming out of his
29:00
eyes oh my god uh the indian army
29:02
supposedly are testing out chili
29:04
grenades as a form of non-lethal weapon
29:08
these are on elephants do they
29:10
but then they got um cancelled because
29:11
they were prone to fungal rot oh no oh
29:14
don't use it on hippos because they'll
29:16
go wow even more delicious
29:19
[Applause]
29:19
[Music]
29:20
okay time for our final fact of the show
29:23
and that is anne
29:25
my fact is that dogs aren't allowed at
29:27
selwyn college in cambridge so the
29:29
master's bassett hound has been
29:30
reclassified as a very large cat
29:34
it's really good
29:36
so basically uh this guy
29:39
so they've just got this law no dogs
29:41
but there's a sort of present that you
29:42
can have a cat they were quite knowing
29:43
about it apparently it was a jokey
29:45
minute but nevertheless the minute hit
29:46
the internet and the minute says college
29:48
animal noting precedent under the
29:50
mastership of professor chadwick council
29:52
approved the master's request we dropped
29:54
a very large cat in the master's lodge
29:56
and then everyone's sort of
29:58
taken it to heart and people thought it
29:59
was just a quirky cambridge customer
30:01
you'd go out and tell everyone would
30:02
yell hey i love your cat after his
30:04
basset hound
30:05
but the story went viral it was on the
30:07
official chinese news agency on websites
30:08
in south america and he had certain
30:10
interview in america about what you're
30:12
the dog thought of the situation and
30:14
he was up and down about it
30:16
[Laughter]
30:18
but amazona said he played along gamely
30:21
and resisted the irish to shout she has
30:22
no idea she's a sodding dog
30:25
but i've been seeing you quite a lot of
30:27
dogs passing off with other things um
30:28
there was a new story a few months ago
30:30
about a guy who had two puppies had them
30:32
for two years turned out they were black
30:34
bears and he only found out when someone
30:37
for at least looked through his house
30:38
about um people trading in illegal
30:40
animals and was like hang on a minute
30:42
but his puppies weighed 50 kilos each he
30:44
only found out he didn't realize he only
30:46
found out when it clawed off his face
30:49
i think he only found out when he
30:51
discovered that you can be punished for
30:52
only the wrong time
30:55
some other loopholes maybe yeah
30:58
the 1862 homestead act in america
31:01
allowed people to go through america and
31:03
grab a bit of land so any u.s citizen
31:06
could go along find some land um but in
31:08
order to claim it they had to build a 12
31:10
by 14 dwelling on it
31:12
and but the law didn't say what units
31:15
the 12 by 14 was in and apparently some
31:17
people built 12 by 14 inches houses
31:21
so that they could claim the land
31:24
you couldn't live in the house though
31:25
yeah
31:26
um there was in 2007 in 2007 smoking was
31:30
banned in bars in minnesota and
31:33
there was a bar called barnacles bar
31:34
which found out was losing a lot of
31:35
custom on account of that and found a
31:38
loophole in the law which said that
31:40
smoking's banned in indoor places unless
31:42
you are an actor in a play who's playing
31:45
a character that smokes and so the
31:47
minnesota bar said that they were
31:49
staging a continuous live performance
31:50
and that everyone in the bar was an
31:51
actor
31:53
very good
31:55
um this is not a loophole but i just
31:57
like in the idea of bands that have
31:59
happened in 2013 florida accidentally
32:02
banned computers
32:04
what yeah it was a very badly worded
32:07
bill um they were cracking down on
32:09
online gambling in internet cafes
32:11
particularly in florida and um it banned
32:14
i guess slot machines and and so on and
32:16
said any machine or device or system or
32:19
network of devices
32:21
um which meant that that's exactly what
32:24
a computer is and so
32:26
and in 2011 they actually made it
32:27
illegal for anyone to have sex as well
32:29
so this is two types
32:30
of living yeah
32:32
it was basically they were banning
32:34
bestiality they outlawed and this is the
32:36
quotes here knowing sexual conduct or
32:38
sexual contact with an animal uh
32:40
forgetting that that's what we are
32:45
um there was a loophole in christchurch
32:48
uh in new zealand where
32:50
you if you wanted to register your
32:51
diesel car um you needed to pay 260
32:54
dollars
32:55
but if you wanted to register
32:58
a hearse you could register it for 58
33:01
and so a lady registered her diesel car
33:04
as a non-commercial hearse by arguing
33:07
that whenever she went to the
33:08
supermarket she was bringing back dead
33:10
chickens
33:13
how much did she say by doing that she
33:15
saved 200 200
33:18
can i bring us back to cambridge very
33:20
quickly
33:21
because i used this opportunity of
33:24
looking into something that i've always
33:26
wondered about and i read about it in a
33:27
stephen fry novel years ago so there's
33:30
always been a rumor that the library of
33:32
cambridge for the university contained a
33:35
secret stash of victorian porno and
33:38
stephen fry talks about it in his novel
33:40
the liar so obviously it's a novel but
33:42
it's it's a real rumor that's existed
33:44
and everyone uh seems to talk about it
33:46
um recently they had to put all of their
33:48
books online because they've upgraded
33:50
into the new world and
33:52
it has been revealed that there is no
33:54
porno stash
33:55
and what they do have are a couple of
33:57
victorian books and the only titles
34:00
really that get close to it are the
34:02
lovers guide to courtship flirting made
34:04
easy what i mean yeah
34:07
but if you had a secret collection you
34:09
wouldn't put it on the website well this
34:11
is true but so you'd rename it floating
34:13
made easy so no one knew what it was did
34:16
you hear floating then flirting
34:19
i wondered why james gave me such a
34:21
weirdo i'll tell you what that's why
34:22
i've been going wrong all these years
34:25
floating in bars
34:27
so good at levitating though i'm
34:29
impressed
34:32
but yeah um they had this article
34:34
vanessa lacy who's the manager of the
34:36
cambridge university library tower
34:38
project uh said that unfortunately uh
34:40
it's not true however she did say good
34:42
news there are plenty of pornography
34:44
from the modern world
34:47
yeah exactly yeah but so they do have a
34:50
lot of modern porn in there but no so
34:52
far unless you're right unless they're
34:53
still hiding the secret stash
34:55
yeah they did have something very
34:57
recently and it's a shame that it's been
34:59
busted so quickly there was a book in
35:00
the cambridge library
35:02
where when you opened it
35:04
it was hollowed out on the inside and it
35:05
had chocolate bars you're not allowed to
35:06
eat inside the library and so the idea
35:09
was that you would eat these chocolate
35:11
bars when if you were starving and stuck
35:13
in the library researching
35:15
and then there's a message underneath
35:17
the chocolate bars which said your job
35:18
is to now return the book with more
35:20
chocolate inside for the next person who
35:22
finds it but unfortunately it's been
35:24
busted so now that's no longer a thing
35:26
although at the end of the day you are
35:28
bringing chocolate into the library and
35:30
you are eating chocolate it's an odd
35:31
system isn't it because you might as
35:32
well just eat your own chocolate yeah
35:34
yeah exactly very odd they're only doing
35:36
for the sake of the fun systems if
35:38
you're working late you think i'm really
35:39
hungry there's no snack machine in here
35:41
i'll talk about the book i'll check
35:42
every bucket
35:45
[Laughter]
35:49
[Music]
35:51
okay that's it that's all of our facts
35:53
thank you so much for listening if you
35:55
want to get in contact with any of us
35:56
about the things we've said over the

00:12
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:15
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:18
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:20
covent garden my name is dan schreiber
00:22
i'm sitting here with james harkin andy
00:24
murray and alex bell and once again we
00:26
have gathered around the microphones
00:27
with our four favorite facts from the
00:29
last seven days and in no particular
00:31
order here we go starting with my facts
00:34
and my fact this week is that according
00:37
to the diary of the first chief of mi6
00:40
this is how the first day went went to
00:42
the office saw no one nor was there
00:45
anything to do there
00:47
and that was the first day of proper
00:49
spying in britain yeah was that because
00:51
the spies were so good he couldn't fight
00:52
yeah
00:53
i went in and there were seven lamp
00:55
stands
00:58
so who who was who was this mansfield
01:00
[ __ ] he's the founding chief of mi6
01:03
this was in the year 1909 i believe and
01:06
uh he's someone we've mentioned very
01:09
briefly ages ago on this podcast he's
01:11
the guy who used to when he was
01:12
recruiting people in mi6 would stab a
01:15
knife into his leg in order to see what
01:18
the reaction of the person he was
01:19
interviewing would be you've missed out
01:21
a very important bit exactly which is
01:23
that he had a wooden leg
01:26
very good point and it's a trick you
01:27
really have to get right isn't it you
01:29
can't make a mistake he had a wooden leg
01:31
because he lost his first leg having
01:33
stabbed himself so many times
01:35
yeah he said uh to have gone because it
01:38
was quite hard to walk around with a
01:39
wooden leg uh and he wasn't born with it
01:41
it was later in life but he used to go
01:42
around
01:44
[Laughter]
01:47
tragically pinocchio was born with a
01:49
wooden
01:52
everything he's an amazing character man
01:55
coming he's he's everything that you
01:57
would hope for in a in the founder of
01:59
it's so british eccentricity he's he's
02:01
like inspector clue so all the stories
02:03
famous british eccentric inspectors
02:08
[Laughter]
02:14
before he joined he was in boom defense
02:17
yes yeah which is um defense of the sea
02:20
or the coastline um sort of putting huge
02:23
piles into youtube
02:24
and all sorts of traps and you know
02:27
spotting devices and things like this
02:28
and the man who
02:30
was setting up the secret service called
02:32
a.e bethel wrote to him saying my dear
02:34
you're coming boom defense must be
02:36
getting a bit stale with you uh you may
02:38
therefore perhaps like a new billet if
02:40
so i have something good i can offer you
02:42
what a cool way of saying do you want to
02:43
be
02:44
the spy master and he was really
02:45
reluctant he was living on a narrow boat
02:47
at the time he was coming up to
02:49
retirement age anyway and he kept sort
02:51
of going i really like making these boom
02:54
nets
02:55
and he just keeps asking he's like could
02:56
i do the boom netting thing at the same
02:58
time is that a possibility do you think
03:00
that he would spend all his days in my
03:01
six day dreaming of being not a spy
03:04
whereas what everyone else would
03:05
daydream about being a spy oh right
03:06
you're dreaming of getting a tap on the
03:07
shoulder and saying
03:09
would you like to not be a spy
03:11
what's really weird is that he lives on
03:12
a narrow boat before then he was in the
03:13
navy and he had to leave because he got
03:15
really seasick but then he went to live
03:17
on a boat oh right wow not many waves
03:20
and tides on a canal though is there so
03:22
even fewer on the land though that's
03:24
true yeah an interesting thing about
03:26
spies in the first correspondence where
03:28
they're talking about the spies they're
03:30
not referred to by the word spies are
03:32
referred to by the word scallywags
03:34
because they used to recruit people it
03:36
was different to the romantic notion we
03:38
have of this james bond character it was
03:39
all about any kind of common criminal
03:42
that you might be able to find overseas
03:44
who would be up for doing some spying
03:46
for you the word scallywags was used in
03:48
the war um to refer to people who would
03:51
kind of do very very small things to put
03:53
off any invaders so like turning signs
03:56
around or all that kind of thing i know
03:58
something about them we i think we did
03:59
this on the show actually is that
04:00
private godfrey from dad's army was in a
04:02
group called the scallywags in the
04:04
second world war which was devoted to
04:06
sabotage of any potential german
04:08
invasion and they were given uh arms
04:10
they were given the ingredients to make
04:12
bombs they were given instructions for
04:13
how to set up razor wire traps across
04:15
roads it really was pretty unpleasant
04:17
the stuff that they were prepared to do
04:18
in the event of an invasion yeah of
04:20
course wow so did you guys know about
04:22
all the other mis because there are 19
04:24
of them well
04:25
yeah yeah it's amazing okay so uh there
04:27
was for example mi1 was codes and
04:29
ciphers and that's now gchq so some of
04:30
them still exist but they're under
04:32
different names they've been subsumed
04:34
you know equations like that my favorite
04:35
ones are mi4 which was the geographical
04:38
section so maps they just dealt with
04:40
maps um mi7 which was press and
04:42
propaganda which is quite interesting
04:44
and mi-16 which is scientific
04:46
intelligence that was formed in 1945
04:48
during the scottish independence debate
04:50
it was revealed that there's still money
04:51
going into my 16. so it still exists how
04:54
cool
04:55
but then it is just scientists i reckon
04:57
you go to a party and go yeah actually i
04:58
work for mi-16
05:00
[Laughter]
05:03
there's no mi 13 though
05:05
not because it's paddling well i don't
05:07
know there are a couple that never
05:08
existed so for some reason i mean mi18
05:10
was only used in fiction apparently but
05:12
then why why would you not just use all
05:13
the numbers it's really odd that they
05:14
missed out a couple yeah yeah so the
05:17
correct name for mi6 is the sis which is
05:20
a secret intelligence service yes
05:22
it was originally known as the secret
05:24
service bureau
05:26
uh and that was known as either the
05:28
ssbro or sometimes just the ss
05:32
[Music]
05:34
do you want to know something else
05:34
that's really cool about mansfield
05:36
coming i think that he invented the
05:38
method of spies driving up to someone
05:40
and saying get in so before that people
05:42
would just stand there when the car got
05:44
there and go well what do you want me to
05:45
do
05:47
so basically he would drive to meet
05:49
people right but he thought that they
05:50
would have associates who'd be waiting
05:52
to photograph you or that they would be
05:53
waiting to you know cost you or whatever
05:55
so he said drive past the rendezvous on
05:58
the opposite side and once you've
05:59
spotted the target and i'm quoting here
06:01
drive up close to him open the door and
06:03
invite him in i lean back the moment
06:05
i've caught his eye and from then
06:06
onwards i do not show myself at all this
06:08
is another bit from his diary um surely
06:11
we cannot be expected to sit in the
06:13
office month by month doing absolutely
06:15
nothing it was just nothing to do and
06:17
then uh on the 14th and 15th of october
06:21
his diary then again reads office all
06:24
day no one appeared
06:26
i heard it was just an office rented in
06:28
the name of a private detective called
06:29
mr drew yes victoria street and then the
06:31
next office as well or one of the later
06:33
offices was
06:34
under another pseudonym there was one um
06:37
that was 54 broadway
06:39
they had that between 1926 and 1964. but
06:42
the sign outside said it was the mini
06:44
max fire extinguisher company
06:46
wow that was actually mi6 and um that
06:49
when they eventually sold that um
06:52
property to buy a new one they realized
06:54
that people were coming around to view
06:55
it and one of the people who came to
06:57
view was a russian trade delegation
07:03
that's amazing um there's also a very
07:06
another exciting character who was
07:08
recruited by
07:09
mansfield [ __ ] which was a man called
07:11
thomas merton he was the original q he
07:15
was the gadget man yeah he worked out
07:17
how they could create an invisible ink
07:19
for writing because up until then they'd
07:21
been experimenting with using semen
07:23
which i think is quite well known right
07:25
yeah mansfield cummings said that he
07:27
thought the best invisible ink was semen
07:29
yeah the advantage of using bodily
07:31
fluids is that if you were found in
07:32
possession of them they weren't
07:34
incriminating if they're in a bottle i
07:36
think it's more incriminating
07:40
the idea is that spice had been
07:42
convicted uh and sentenced to death
07:44
because they've been found with like
07:46
lemon juice and stuff like that because
07:47
they're saying why would you have lemon
07:48
juice on you i think why do you have
07:50
semen on you is still a good question
07:54
is this anything to do with cummings
08:00
um the agent who discovered that you can
08:01
use siemen as invisible ink apparently
08:03
had to transfer to another department
08:05
after he was teased so much by other
08:07
staff members
08:10
that's so bad isn't it uh and apparently
08:12
there was one officer uh in copenhagen
08:15
who took the discovery so seriously that
08:17
he stocked a whole load of um invisible
08:19
ink in his office and it began to smell
08:22
so badly that other agents said to him
08:24
you should use fresh every time you want
08:26
to write a letter rather than saving it
08:29
oh my god you have to really take
08:31
someone aside to a quiet corner of the
08:32
room to tell them that don't you
08:34
um so i um i'm surprised that
08:38
in all the stuff that i read of
08:39
mansfield coming i've only read this in
08:40
one spot probably but um
08:42
rasputin's death was off the back of
08:45
mansfield coming supposedly yeah yeah i
08:48
think there were british spies involved
08:50
somehow in his death definitely um they
08:52
poisoned him and he sort of ate all the
08:54
poison then he laughed and he had us
08:56
having a great time and then they beat
08:57
him up you know and then they shot him a
08:58
couple of times he still didn't die the
09:00
thing i read was they smashed his
09:01
testicles flat
09:04
terrible
09:06
you won't be writing any more invisible
09:07
link letters after this
09:11
[Applause]
09:11
[Music]
09:13
okay time for fact number two and that
09:16
is james okay my fact this week is that
09:19
there is a distillery in kentucky that
09:21
claims that playing bruce springsteen to
09:23
the whiskey improves the aging process
09:26
is that because of bruce springsteen
09:28
going through the aging process himself
09:31
he knows what it's like therefore he can
09:32
teach the whiskey uh it'd be nice to be
09:34
that but no sadly not it is the
09:36
vibrations they think
09:38
but specifically a bruce springsteen no
09:40
it's just any old music but i think
09:42
being in kentucky that's just the kind
09:44
of rock they like plus it being dad rock
09:47
it just naturally ages anything that
09:48
listens to it
09:52
so this will be bobbum because it's in
09:54
kentucky um but when you make any kind
09:56
of whiskey like this the way that it
09:57
ages is they put it in barrels and then
10:00
the liquor inside the barrel will go in
10:03
and out of the pores of the wood and
10:05
that will give it its kind of woody
10:07
taste and it will age it in that way
10:09
and they think that vibrating it'll
10:11
slosh the
10:12
liquid around a bit more which will make
10:14
it age quicker but it seems like it
10:16
probably does work to a certain extent
10:18
it's really cool the way that whiskey
10:19
distilleries make drinks that might not
10:21
actually hit the market until after the
10:23
founders are either retired or dead yeah
10:25
so there are still you know there are 70
10:26
year old whiskies which go on sale yeah
10:29
and
10:29
you know this is something that they
10:31
made 70 years ago what was that 70 years
10:33
ago from now that's 1945.
10:36
um i don't know how much whiskey they
10:37
were making in 1945
10:38
other things on the mind but yeah it's
10:40
just incredible yeah it's it's really
10:43
interesting as well the relationship
10:44
between the whiskey and the barrel
10:45
because
10:47
obviously the the like you say the kind
10:48
of the essence of the barrel goes into
10:49
the whiskey but it happens the other way
10:50
around as well so the barrels in which
10:52
jack daniel's tennessee whiskey is aged
10:55
are reused afterwards to age tabasco
10:58
sauce i think they um also sell the
11:00
barrels over to scotch companies as well
11:02
in scotland i do i've been to the jack
11:03
daniels distillery
11:05
in tennessee and a fact about it is that
11:07
it's a dry county you're not allowed to
11:09
buy
11:10
uh alcohol there wow there's a special
11:13
sort of dispensation so you can i think
11:14
you can buy a souvenir bottle but you're
11:17
not allowed to actually drink it until
11:18
you're over the border out of that
11:20
particular county or it's amazing the
11:23
relationship of music and alcohol so
11:25
there was a report done a research
11:27
report by a guy called professor north
11:29
who found that people were five times
11:31
more likely to buy french wine than
11:32
german wine if accordion music was
11:34
playing in the background
11:36
what about if there was umpire music
11:39
no way an umpa band was played the
11:41
german product outsold the french by two
11:43
to one
11:44
wow i can't believe that the effect is
11:46
that substantial people are so
11:48
impressionable uh there was a study done
11:50
quite recently about the best
11:52
environment to um to drink whiskey uh
11:55
they had people drinking it in
11:57
it's on your own isn't it
11:59
right
12:01
you just stare at the wall yeah in your
12:02
underpants
12:07
sorry
12:08
they had a grassy room with a turf floor
12:11
and the bar in the sheep
12:12
and the smell of freshly cut grass just
12:14
do it outside
12:17
oh that's the best environment for
12:18
unfortunately there's no other room in
12:19
existence that anyone can drink that in
12:22
that's one that's one the other one is a
12:24
sweet room which was filled with a sweet
12:26
fragrance rounded red objects and a
12:28
high-pitched tinkling sound
12:31
and then the last one was a woody room
12:33
with wood paneling and floorboards the
12:35
sounds of leaves crunching and log fires
12:38
and the smell of cedar wood and the
12:40
wooden one was by far what people
12:41
enjoyed it the most in the wooden room
12:44
wow the woody room the woody room yeah
12:46
cool
12:47
um this you know this report i was just
12:48
talking about about different tastes of
12:50
wine matched to music they actually
12:52
released a playlist of uh the types of
12:54
music you should listen to to the
12:56
different wines so when you're drinking
13:00
[Laughter]
13:03
just i'll repeat 500 times
13:08
uh if you're drinking a merlot sitting
13:10
on the dock of the bay by otis redding
13:12
uh easy by lionel richie over the
13:14
rainbow by eva cassidy none of those are
13:16
french songs uh no these are these are
13:19
this was the french and german wine
13:22
tasting was about what you buy in a
13:24
supermarket this is about how it
13:26
actually what tastes better
13:28
how does it affect the taste okay so
13:30
what he says is that uh they did a study
13:33
with over 250 university students they
13:36
played them various different bits of
13:37
music and they all reported back that a
13:39
certain type of music absolutely tasted
13:41
way better than if they heard it with
13:43
more imagine if you have kind of a more
13:45
smooth tasting wine then you want more
13:47
smooth kind of music yeah that kind of
13:49
makes sense i can imagine students just
13:50
trying to find some correlation to play
13:52
on so that they just get given more free
13:54
wine i think i'm gonna need to hear
13:56
another one
13:57
right here let's try it again
13:59
i think i'm spotting a pattern i think
14:00
we should continue guys chardonnay had
14:02
what's got uh what's love got to do with
14:04
it tina turner spinning around by kylie
14:05
minnow and rock dj by robbie williams
14:08
that's what chardonnay tastes best with
14:11
this this research by the way was
14:12
carried out by a winemaker from chile uh
14:15
who himself plays monastic chants to his
14:19
maturing wines
14:21
does he yeah okay so that's his choice
14:23
no springsteen
14:25
okay so there was a whiskey uh bob and
14:27
whiskey in america um where the
14:29
warehouse where it was held was hit by a
14:31
tornado and basically the whole of the
14:33
house was almost ripped to smithereens
14:35
but the barrels were kind of left more
14:37
or less where they were apparently when
14:39
they tried the whiskey it was absolutely
14:41
amazing and it's called tornado
14:43
surviving whiskey and it's superior to
14:45
the usual product they say i would say
14:48
that too if i had an enormous bill of
14:50
damage to me
14:53
this whiskey is suddenly quadrupled in
14:54
value
14:55
wow oh god well i mean that's something
14:58
i suppose yeah and there's another
14:59
company um called ocean aged bobbin who
15:03
take their whiskey and then put it on a
15:05
boat
15:06
send it out to sea for four years and
15:08
when it comes back apparently it tastes
15:10
a lot better i think this is all
15:11
monsters i know it sounds like it sounds
15:14
like it's not true but there is a little
15:15
bit of science behind it and the more
15:17
that it kind of sloshes against the
15:18
woods the more it will react to it they
15:20
really do believe it like the whiskey
15:22
makers really believe it
15:24
if you go on the internet you can find a
15:25
nice advert for whiskey toothpaste
15:28
wow don't even know if it's real but the
15:30
advert seems to be there um it's six
15:32
percent proof uh scotch bourbon whiskey
15:35
and the advert says why fight oral
15:37
hygiene enjoy it
15:39
here's real he-man toothpaste best
15:42
argument yet for brushing three times a
15:44
day it's also a fantastic excuse for
15:46
turning up a work smelling of whiskey
15:52
[Applause]
15:52
[Music]
15:54
okay time for fact number three and that
15:57
is alex bell okay my fact is that there
16:00
is a statue of nicola tesla in silicon
16:02
valley that radiates free wi-fi
16:05
cool it's cool that is what he would
16:06
have wanted it is yeah it's it's him
16:08
holding a sort of giant wireless light
16:10
bulb and the light bulb sort of yeah
16:13
it's a kickstarter project i've seen the
16:15
drawings of it i have to say in the
16:16
drawings they don't quite get the light
16:18
bulb right in his hand it looks like a
16:19
big ping-pong bat yeah yeah it does look
16:21
a bit weird yeah and it's like yeah it's
16:23
it's a it's quite an odd thing for him
16:24
to be holding as well but we should tell
16:26
you tesla was yeah yeah he was known as
16:29
the man who invented the 20th century
16:31
yeah as in before tesla it was the 19th
16:33
century
16:37
yeah he was born 1856. okay he was born
16:40
into a lightning storm a fierce
16:42
lightning storm according to this is his
16:44
family legend uh and midway through the
16:46
birth the midwife said that the
16:48
lightning was a bad omen and she said
16:50
that he'll be a child of darkness and
16:51
the mother said no he will be a child of
16:53
light
16:54
that definitely sounds like attractive
16:56
writing there and so
16:58
tesla was this fantastic scientist and
17:00
very very eccentric man we talked about
17:02
him a bit on the podcast and q i uh he
17:04
was
17:05
he
17:06
invented among other things you talked
17:07
about the death rate that he invented on
17:08
the on the podcast the main thing he
17:10
invented was the ac polyphase system
17:12
which does not sound sexy but it was
17:14
unbelievable so
17:16
before tesla you could pump you could
17:18
transport electricity one mile before
17:20
tesla and even then you could only use
17:21
it for lighting up light bulbs and
17:23
things
17:24
thanks to his system you can transmit it
17:26
hundreds of miles and use it for
17:27
industrial machinery i mean it it made
17:30
electricity into a viable technology
17:32
which could span the world ironic that
17:34
he's now a wife i think that probably
17:35
goes about two meters yeah yeah
17:39
yeah he was a he was a big whiskey
17:41
aficionado
17:42
yeah he thought that he drank it every
17:44
day and he thought that he would live to
17:45
150 before drinking it worth and try
17:47
prohibition came along and he was not a
17:49
fan of prohibition at all because of
17:50
this but he went along with it anyway
17:52
and decided that he was now only going
17:54
to live to 130 because he was no longer
17:56
drinking whiskey he little 86 i think
17:58
yeah that's pretty good
18:00
yeah but he's a long way off his
18:01
prediction isn't he yeah it's true well
18:03
prohibition he probably couldn't factor
18:05
in how many years that actually was a
18:06
mathematician i think it was um cardano
18:09
but it might not have been him but it
18:10
was one of the people around at the same
18:12
time as him around the renaissance
18:14
that um predicted exactly the day he was
18:16
going to die and told everyone this was
18:19
the day he was going to die and he was
18:20
exactly right but a lot of people think
18:22
he probably killed himself to prove
18:24
himself right ah yeah
18:26
i was looking some other statues as well
18:27
oh yeah statues the statue of winston
18:29
churchill in parliament square there's a
18:31
myth that it's electrified to um so the
18:35
pigeons don't announce on it but i
18:36
looked it up and i found a new scientist
18:38
article that says that they thought
18:39
about it they didn't do it yeah yeah
18:41
they also thought about inserting pins
18:44
that would stand out at the top of his
18:46
head uh intending to stop the birds as
18:48
well so that's the standard way of
18:49
stopping pigs yeah but they just thought
18:50
that would look really weird like he had
18:51
a punk hairdo
18:54
really subtle then there's a risk you'll
18:55
just end up with a dead pigeon kebab
18:58
yeah
18:59
churchill's head but also the the
19:00
location of where the statue stands is
19:03
located in a spot that in the 50s used
19:06
to be referred to by churchill as where
19:08
my statue will go in the exact spot yeah
19:11
so that's he would constantly say that
19:12
if ever they passed he would say that's
19:14
where my statue would go and that's
19:16
where it did he was successful in his
19:18
life but i mean that's quite a
19:19
presumption to make for anyone yeah just
19:21
to walk through the park loudly
19:23
proclaiming that's where my stature as
19:24
long as you don't say it everywhere you
19:26
go and you help to win the second world
19:27
war i don't know i'd be inclined to give
19:29
him this touch well towards the end
19:30
though they didn't he got voted out and
19:32
people weren't particularly happy with
19:33
him i know he got voted out immediately
19:34
afterwards then he got voted back in at
19:36
the age of 80. he was elected prime
19:37
minister yeah that's amazing um there's
19:39
a mysterious statue in budapest of
19:42
colombo
19:44
i'm a detective peter folk yeah
19:46
not the guy who uh discovered the
19:48
clitoris no no
19:50
that's a callback it's a call back to a
19:52
episode between 15 and 55. if anyone
19:54
wants to have a listen uh yeah there's a
19:57
slightly mysterious peter folk statue
19:59
sitting in a street in budapest no one's
20:02
quite sure why it's there it was built
20:04
about three years after his death it
20:06
just suddenly was there they think uh it
20:08
was a hungarian politician do you think
20:10
maybe you went there on holiday once and
20:11
went that's where my statue's gonna go
20:14
yes exactly
20:16
so he did he's known to have had
20:17
hungarian roots through his grandparents
20:19
side um but yeah there's no actual link
20:22
no one's quite sure why it's there
20:24
there's the world's smallest sculpture
20:26
by a guy called jonty herwitz it was
20:27
unveiled earlier this year and it was
20:29
almost it was less than it was less than
20:31
one millimeter tall and was almost
20:32
immediately destroyed when the
20:34
photographer accidentally crushed it
20:35
with his finger no yeah really yeah yeah
20:38
it was you it was being photographed in
20:40
standing inside the eye of a needle
20:42
there was a museum in bath called the
20:43
impossible micro world which was the
20:45
most fantastic museum and it closed down
20:47
but it's amazing this amazing guy called
20:49
willard wigan who makes these things and
20:50
he's done um so as a sculpture of a
20:53
horse dancing on the head of an actual
20:55
ant
20:56
all the exhibits in the museum you had
20:58
to go through i went when i was a museum
21:00
normal size museum
21:06
every exhibit you had to look at through
21:08
a magnifier basically and he um this guy
21:11
he has to slow down his heartbeat
21:14
in order to um to make the cuts
21:17
necessary on the thingy sculpting so he
21:19
slows it right down look through the
21:20
binoculars or the magnifier the
21:22
microscope whatever he's using waits for
21:24
a heartbeat makes the cut on the thing
21:26
then the next heartbeat happens that's
21:28
just incredible that his hands were so
21:29
unshaky that his heartbeat could have
21:31
affected how shaky they were i mean i if
21:33
i try to do something quite small my
21:34
hands are way shakier than what is being
21:36
affected by my heartbeat yes but you
21:37
drink very heavily too today
21:39
yeah
21:40
um do you wanna hear some facts about
21:41
wi-fi yes please andy okay
21:44
so this is cool um there's an israeli
21:47
theme park called
21:48
kedem right and it's a traditional theme
21:50
park for people who want to experience
21:53
life as it was in galilee 2000 years ago
21:55
right if people get bored i presume or
21:57
want to check their phones um they have
21:59
donkeys walking around with wi-fi
22:01
hotspots on them oh wow but the thing is
22:03
they have 30 donkeys and only five of
22:04
the donkeys are actually carrying wi-fi
22:06
hot spots there's only a one in six
22:07
chance
22:08
that your donkey do you spend ages
22:10
trying to connect to that one
22:12
donkey and then you say no not this one
22:15
it's hard to imagine anyone getting
22:17
bored at a theme park which recreates 2
22:19
000 years old
22:20
israel
22:21
it's just really difficult when you were
22:23
talking about running around finding
22:25
donkeys yeah uh this just reminded me of
22:27
something that alex told us just before
22:29
we walked in about the um
22:31
is like a children's playground
22:34
following you around oh yeah i just saw
22:35
this news this video on bbc news some
22:38
some you know these like random science
22:39
projects that get made for seemingly no
22:41
reason um a guy has created a climbing
22:44
frame that could wanders around parks
22:47
looking for children to play on it it
22:49
just sounds like the most ridiculous and
22:51
also predatory thing what they've done
22:53
is they've spliced the genes of a
22:55
climbing frame in a pedophile
23:00
it's absolutely horrendous the idea
23:01
isn't to get children used to the idea
23:03
of robotics in real life does it move if
23:05
you're climbing on it or does it stop
23:06
don't know i mean it sounds incredibly
23:08
dangerous it doesn't matter it's an
23:10
academic question because no child will
23:11
ever climb on this thing
23:13
i don't think they have any choice i
23:15
mean i mean it's very slow it doesn't
23:17
like gallop around or anything like that
23:19
can i talk about the sort of invention
23:21
of wi-fi because i want to talk about
23:23
ages and i've never had a chance okay um
23:24
no it's god you can't say this at home
23:26
but there are slides coming out
23:30
um hedy lamarr which is very glamorous
23:31
films done in america 30s and 40s she
23:33
was one time dubbed the world's most
23:35
beautiful woman but she was also this
23:36
fantastic scientist as well when the war
23:38
broke out she applied to the national
23:39
inventors guild but was rejected mainly
23:42
because she was a woman and people
23:43
didn't take it seriously and that she
23:44
was encouraged to use her celebrity and
23:45
beauty to sell war bonds which she did a
23:47
little bit but she got started inventing
23:50
things herself she got together with her
23:51
neighbor who was a composer called
23:52
george antil and they built a machine
23:55
called a frequency hopping spread
23:57
spectrum basically the problem with
23:58
torpedoes at that time was that they
24:00
were remote controlled so they were kept
24:01
on course using a radio signal
24:03
transmitted from the ship
24:04
but that signal could be easily blocked
24:06
and lamar and antel developed this
24:08
improved system that allowed the radio
24:09
signal to jump up and down frequencies
24:11
randomly so that it couldn't be jammed
24:12
but what's really brilliant is how they
24:13
did it you guys know what player pianos
24:15
are right they're pianos that play
24:17
themselves they have this big roll of
24:18
paper music which has lots of holes in
24:20
and they correspond to which note should
24:21
play and when the frequency hopping
24:23
spread spectrum used the mechanism from
24:25
the player piano but instead of playing
24:26
88 keys of the piano it switched the
24:29
torpedo signal between 88 radio
24:30
frequencies the principle of modern
24:32
wireless technology is based on that
24:34
wi-fi gps bluetooth everything like that
24:36
wow isn't that amazing that's so cool so
24:39
sri lanka the island of sri lanka is
24:41
about to provide wi-fi to the entire
24:43
island using a network of floating
24:46
balloons
24:47
which are going to be 12 miles up in the
24:49
sky they're all solar powered and the
24:51
solar power that the balloons get is
24:52
going to be used to transmit internet
24:54
signals the spot of land beneath it how
24:57
insane is that 25 000 square miles
24:59
that's amazing the area of the country
25:01
you know one place that i'm still trying
25:03
to
25:03
find this out for certain and i can't
25:05
properly find anywhere online yet that
25:08
will tell me the right answer but
25:10
certainly up until 2012 you can't get
25:12
wi-fi in the white house wow yeah the
25:14
white house has no wi-fi and um like for
25:17
example the oval office doesn't have a
25:19
computer in it and if you want to use a
25:21
computer in it you have to bring in a
25:23
laptop and plug in clinton famously
25:25
apparently only sent two emails during
25:27
his time as president one was as a test
25:30
uh and then the second one was delete
25:32
everything
25:35
what's the second one two spaced yeah
25:36
iss yeah it was to
25:38
john glenn yeah so i don't know if he
25:40
was in the yeah he was he in the iss on
25:42
the second trip
25:43
you'll be hearing a lot of crazy stuff
25:45
[Laughter]
25:47
none of it's true
25:48
mr clinton we've gone through your
25:50
entire five million emails and we think
25:52
there's two of them we can save
25:57
yes good news about the invisible egg
25:59
you were asking about
26:05
[Applause]
26:05
[Music]
26:06
okay time for a final fact of the show
26:09
and that is andrew hunter murray my fact
26:12
is that a third of people in britain
26:14
have written almost nothing by hand in
26:15
the last six months
26:17
this makes so much sense when you think
26:18
about it but it sounds crazy when you
26:20
first it sounds terrifying yeah so this
26:22
was this was a survey admittedly by a
26:24
printing a mailing company called called
26:26
doc mail but what they said was that one
26:28
in three people had not written anything
26:29
by hand for six months and on average
26:31
people hadn't written something for 41
26:33
days and i think when they say written
26:35
anything by hand i mean anything that's
26:36
not a shopping list a poster signature
26:39
signature yeah yeah yeah what do you
26:41
think about it what is there that you
26:43
need to write at length letters to
26:44
people most people don't write many
26:46
letters these days if any you know i
26:49
mean i presume at school still
26:51
you might be writing all the time well
26:53
one thing about that is um apparently if
26:55
you write things down it helps you
26:57
remember them yep you know that makes
26:58
kind of intuitive i do definitely
27:00
believe that yeah but actually there's
27:01
like a neurological reason for it like
27:03
there are certain um there are certain
27:05
neural circuits that are activated
27:07
whenever you write things down and so
27:09
children who write tend to learn more
27:11
quickly and so if you have schools where
27:13
children aren't really writing things
27:14
down then it can hamper their um their
27:17
improvement right
27:18
wow
27:19
the other the other downside that we're
27:20
sort of going to have in in in years to
27:22
come is that
27:24
all these great works of literature and
27:25
everything else we're not going to have
27:26
the original handwritten notes of people
27:28
doing drafts because so much but now is
27:29
on computers so the american museum of
27:31
natural history on their website i'll
27:33
tweet a link it's if they've got all of
27:35
darwin's papers and all his works and
27:36
it's amazing because you can see all of
27:37
his handwriting which is really bad and
27:39
he's got little doodles of drawings his
27:41
kids drew pictures on the back there's
27:43
an amazing one of a fish walking on the
27:45
land we're holding an umbrella which i
27:47
really like so they obviously subscribe
27:49
to his theory
27:51
the opposite of calligraphy is
27:52
carcography bad handwriting bad
27:54
handwriting that's great
27:56
yeah they reckon that in like 100 years
27:59
time
27:59
the in fact even neatly written hand
28:02
writing will be completely illegible to
28:04
people because um it's like if you look
28:07
at very very old calligraphy now you
28:08
can't understand any of it yeah
28:10
definitely and then in 100 years time it
28:12
might be only that you can recognize
28:13
times new roman or looking at say jane
28:16
austen's letters or something quite
28:18
actually quite difficult to decipher
28:19
yeah some of the words the guy who is
28:21
credited with pretty much
28:21
single-handedly reviving modern
28:23
calligraphy and um and penmanship is
28:25
edward johnston who also is very very
28:28
big in fonts
28:31
[Laughter]
28:32
i mean he created johnston and new
28:34
johnson is now the london underground um
28:37
and he mentored the sculptor eric gill
28:39
he came up with girl sounds which is the
28:41
bbc's official form there's two massive
28:43
institutions here's another incredibly
28:45
creepy company
28:48
just off the back of the playgrounds
28:49
which follow children
28:51
um there's a company which has made a
28:52
robot to write handwritten letters
28:55
so basically you write a lot of
28:56
handwriting samples and then a robot
28:58
reads your handwriting samples and can
28:59
perfectly replicate your handwriting
29:02
and they basically say that they want to
29:03
retain the delight of giving and
29:05
receiving notes without the hassle of
29:07
heading to the stationery store writing
29:08
out a letter finding stamps and locating
29:10
a mailbox which is the whole point of
29:12
writing a letter to someone is that it's
29:13
a nice thing to do because it is a bit
29:15
of trouble have you guys heard of the
29:16
musclemen it's the it's an urdu language
29:19
newspaper it's probably the world's only
29:21
remaining newspaper that's completely
29:23
handwritten
29:24
it's daily in daily newspapers it's only
29:26
about like four pages it's four pages
29:28
long
29:29
three hours
29:30
circulation remains a difficult matter
29:32
for them
29:34
celebration twenty two thousand
29:35
subscribers in 2008 but yeah four pages
29:37
long but they leave a blank space on the
29:39
front page in case there's any breaking
29:40
news it's great so there's an editor in
29:42
america called harris greeley and he
29:44
once sent a note to the iowa press
29:46
association how the start of it went i
29:48
have waited till longer waiting would be
29:50
discourteous only to find that i cannot
29:52
attend your press meeting next june as i
29:54
would like to do
29:56
but his handwriting was so bad that they
29:58
thought it said i have wondered all
30:00
along whether any squirt had denied the
30:02
scandal about the president meeting jane
30:04
in the woods on saturday
30:07
that's pretty bad driving isn't it at
30:09
the end of this letter when i feel
30:10
obliged to decline any invitation that
30:13
takes me away a day's journey from home
30:15
but they thought it said any insinuation
30:17
that brick ovens are dangerous to hams
30:20
gives me the horrors
30:23
yeah so that's why it's important to
30:24
have very good handwriting yeah this is
30:26
like when i'm in asia i speak mandarin
30:28
from school but obviously in asia every
30:30
word has four different tones and if you
30:32
get the tones wrong you might be saying
30:34
what's the way to the shops down the
30:35
road but it comes out as the cow eats
30:37
the grass in the way of meringue looks
30:39
like a banana like
30:41
something completely different does that
30:43
mean that you have a completely
30:44
different system of puns though yeah
30:46
totally chinese puns are extraordinary
30:48
there was a story that they'd been
30:49
banned wasn't there that the chinese
30:50
government sort of cracked down on puns
30:53
yeah can you do that i don't know i
30:55
don't know cows had been banned from
30:56
eating meringues
31:00
fountain pens
31:02
they're quite interesting um you're not
31:03
supposed to share fountain pens with
31:05
people just like just like needles um
31:07
because you um because um you have wrong
31:10
you have
31:13
is it because of the bodily fluids
31:15
you've been writing
31:18
um uh it's it's because every person
31:21
writes in a unique way as you'd imagine
31:22
a bit like a fingerprint and specific um
31:25
angle that you write at and the amount
31:26
of force you use means that the nib um
31:29
gets sort of shaved down in a very
31:30
specific way and so if you're properly
31:31
using a founding pen and you want to be
31:33
writing into the nicest way possible
31:35
don't lend your pen to someone else
31:36
because then they'll shave it down in
31:38
their way and you'll just end up with a
31:39
horrible nib actually that's true i have
31:40
lent fountain pens to people in the past
31:42
and i've watched them writing and i
31:43
thought oh my god
31:45
he's absolutely murdering it really i
31:47
really have thought that i can imagine
31:48
you have andy yeah yeah i haven't said
31:50
anything at the time obviously
31:53
should we wrap up just a cool thing yeah
31:55
so in medieval times you would use a
31:57
script or you would write in a
31:58
scriptorium as in monks were copying out
32:01
books
32:02
um and some texts we only know their
32:05
history because of mistakes that got in
32:08
somewhere along the chain of being
32:10
repeated you know you make a text yeah
32:11
yeah yeah from that and that is similar
32:13
to the way the enigma codes were broken
32:15
because when people made mistakes in
32:18
text that allowed the guys at bletchley
32:20
some way in
32:22
yeah when there was some difference
32:23
isn't that amazing yeah the difference
32:25
between medieval and you know am i
32:27
whatever it was in the war
32:29
um just on mistakes actually cephatora's
32:32
a special type of copy of the torah
32:34
which is handwritten with a quill um
32:36
you're not allowed to make mistakes in
32:38
any of them if you make a mistake on
32:40
most words then if you're able to
32:41
scratch it out and carry on that's okay
32:43
but if you misspell god's name or make a
32:44
mistake in writing god's name you have
32:46
to cut out the entire page and bury it
32:48
and then sew in a new page and start
32:49
again it's pretty hard to misspell god
32:52
it's not in english obviously and then
32:54
dog set off
32:57
[Applause]
32:58
[Music]
32:59

=75
00:00
the following show you're about to
00:02
listen to is slightly different to the
00:03
ones we normally do uh this show was a
00:06
live one recorded at the aces and eights
00:08
bar in toughnell park a couple of months
00:10
ago and rather than being our four
00:12
favorite facts it was the favorite facts
00:14
of the audience so we did no prep for
00:17
this at all it was the first time we'd
00:18
heard a lot of these facts so it's a bit
00:20
ropey around the edges but stick with it
00:23
because we think it's a really funny one
00:24
and i hope you will enjoy it we're
00:26
putting that out this week in
00:28
preparation for our edinburgh festival
00:29
shows which begin next week
00:38
[Music]
00:44
[Applause]
00:50
hello
00:52
and welcome to another episode of no
00:55
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:57
this week coming to you live from the
00:58
aces and eights bar in toughnell park my
01:00
name is dan schreiber i am sitting here
01:02
with anna chazinski james harkin and
01:04
andy murray and once again we've
01:06
gathered around the microphone but this
01:07
time it's not with our four favorite
01:09
facts from the last seven days it's your
01:11
favorite facts and in no particular
01:13
order
01:14
here we go
01:15
starting with
01:17
okay you're told to put your name this
01:18
person's not put their name
01:20
that's an absolute disaster why don't we
01:23
i reckon people are gonna remember what
01:24
their facts were that's true max max
01:26
walker
01:27
wicked okay max so my fact is about the
01:30
scrooge effect
01:32
which is if you make somebody think
01:34
about death
01:36
they then increase
01:37
how charitable they are and also when
01:40
they do donations they then get more
01:43
satisfaction from it as well
01:45
oh wow that's good okay do we assume
01:48
because they're thinking i really hope
01:50
someone gives money to charity when i
01:51
die so that it's not as bad
01:55
i think that's what people suspect yeah
01:57
yeah it also makes people spend more on
01:59
material goods in general yeah okay what
02:01
is this famous effect called where you
02:03
um buy something green are you you're so
02:06
you're doing something really good for
02:07
the environment and then because you've
02:09
done that then you do something really
02:10
not very nice afterwards it's called
02:12
moral licensing okay it's where you let
02:14
yourself do something bad so this sounds
02:15
a bit like the opposite of that i
02:17
suppose you're reminded of something bad
02:18
that's going to happen to you so you
02:19
then do something good yeah what's moral
02:21
licensing um what's a good example
02:23
if you don't have a shower to save water
02:26
later on you'll leave the hob on longer
02:29
yeah
02:29
[Laughter]
02:31
yeah
02:32
or you'll fill up the kettle slightly
02:34
less than normal so it uses less energy
02:36
and then you'll go out and brutally
02:38
murder three people
02:40
moral licensing
02:42
weirdly today i read a um a story about
02:45
a show that has been named the worst
02:48
show of all time
02:51
in which the prizes were all charity
02:53
prizes and the idea was that it was four
02:55
celebrities and it was a show hosted by
02:57
a comedian back in the day called jackie
02:58
gleason and the idea was that if the
03:01
celebrity got the question right a bunch
03:03
of care packages would go to their
03:04
choice of charity if they got it wrong
03:07
it would go in jackie gleason's name so
03:08
it looked like he was this amazing donor
03:11
he was just like wow this jackie gleason
03:12
guy's incredible he cares so much so
03:15
here's the thing the show was terrible
03:17
it was absolutely terrible and it got
03:19
cancelled after two shows but the second
03:21
show and as far as i know it's the only
03:23
time in history this has happened the
03:24
second show was jackie gleason sitting
03:26
on a stripped-down set and it was half
03:28
an hour of him apologizing to the
03:30
audience at home the entire second show
03:33
was him going we totally messed up that
03:35
was horrible we can't believe we did
03:37
that to you we can't believe we spent so
03:38
much money on it and then they canceled
03:40
the show but it's known as the worst
03:41
show of all time yeah that sounds
03:43
tedious
03:45
it's really interesting the stuff that
03:46
has a psychological effect on you that
03:47
you're not realizing and they're always
03:49
doing studies sometimes quite dubious
03:51
about it but there's that study that
03:52
says that if there's pop music playing
03:54
in a shop i think you're more likely to
03:56
spend more money um and also the fact
03:59
that they start playing classical music
04:00
in places that are high crime
04:02
haven't they because then it stops
04:04
people it deters people from committing
04:05
crimes apparently
04:06
tube stations yeah and dodgy parts of
04:08
town play classical musical people okay
04:11
should we go on to the next fact yeah
04:12
yeah go for it cool um so i think it's
04:14
from someone called coralie or corali
04:18
ah yes so if you could pass that over
04:20
i'll also read a tweet at the same time
04:22
yeah go for it um so we have a tweet by
04:25
someone called at olly granger and they
04:27
said my fact is that if you like grilled
04:30
cheese you'll have 32 percent more sex
04:33
ollie's in tonight
04:36
was this um an experiment you did
04:37
yourself or
04:39
it was on bbc news oh is it amazing and
04:42
is that going to turn into a sexy food
04:44
now when you're sort of like bringing a
04:46
date home and going grilled cheese
04:48
champagne oysters rabbit
04:56
okay uh let's move on to cara is it
04:58
coralie or coralie
05:00
carly what was your fact in 1567
05:04
um
05:05
the man with the longest beard um
05:09
died when he
05:11
tripped over it running away from a fire
05:16
okay
05:16
when you trip it's quite easy to get
05:18
back up straight away right like depends
05:21
where you trip it was a fire next to the
05:22
grand canyon
05:27
i think this guy with the beard i think
05:28
i've heard about him and i think he used
05:30
to tuck his beard in a pocket didn't he
05:32
he had a little pocket he used to tuck
05:33
it in there so that he didn't trip over
05:35
and presumably this time the fire was on
05:37
and he sort of put his hands in the air
05:39
knocked his beard out of his pocket
05:42
and then tripped up wow i'm speculating
05:47
and i accepted that as truth
05:49
anytime james tells me something i'm
05:51
like wow okay that's cool that's
05:53
knowledge now um abraham lincoln
05:55
had a beard famously yeah not for most
05:58
of his life though did he the reason he
06:00
grew a beard i don't know if people know
06:02
about this is because a young girl wrote
06:04
him a letter saying that if he grew a
06:06
beard then some of her brothers would
06:08
vote for him um because he'd he'd made a
06:10
speech or he'd made a statement in some
06:11
way saying i think it's so like
06:14
reminiscent of kind of shoreditch trendy
06:17
people today he said a thing saying do
06:19
you think people might think i'm a bit
06:20
pretentious if i grow this beard now
06:21
this whole whiskery thing and this girl
06:23
wrote in saying look i've got this
06:24
brother he's saying he won't vote for
06:26
you unless you have facial hair and so
06:28
he did it and then he met her a few
06:29
years later a station didn't he and said
06:31
this beer's for you wow
06:35
it was a different time wasn't it
06:37
it's a more innocent time
06:39
the 1860s
06:45
um i got i just to move on quickly
06:47
there's a really good tweet here that i
06:48
got from at finneyland which is that in
06:50
2009
06:52
two french mayors declared the same
06:54
street one way but in different
06:56
directions
07:00
that is such
07:02
a fantastic moment in history i remember
07:05
that happening actually do you yeah was
07:06
it in it's like near paris yeah it was
07:08
in paris yeah yeah and it was like a big
07:10
argument between these two tumors and
07:12
they just decided right we're gonna do
07:14
it
07:15
my uncle used to be on there in bolton
07:18
okay yeah what what what what did he
07:20
declare well he defiance of his
07:23
counterpart
07:25
he declared that this was actually when
07:27
he was a counselor rather than the mayor
07:28
but
07:29
they wanted to build some houses in
07:31
bolton
07:32
and um the no one wanted them to build
07:34
these houses and they tried to stop them
07:36
but they couldn't stop them because they
07:37
had the law on their side and my uncle
07:39
thought well we can't stop them but what
07:41
we can do
07:43
is we can rename the streets
07:46
things that they don't want to put
07:47
houses on and so they came up with the
07:49
idea of making a diarrhea drive
07:52
and hitler grove
07:55
and they were genuinely they actually
07:57
had plans that they were going to make
07:58
these streets but then um in the end i
08:00
think what someone backed out
08:02
just on the uh the subject of um of of
08:05
things being named hitler um there used
08:08
to be a guy who lived in ohio in um he
08:11
was living around world war ii his name
08:12
was adolf hitler right and he was living
08:14
in america in ohio refused to change his
08:16
name and when the guy asked him why have
08:18
you not changed your name he said uh i'm
08:21
not gonna let one guy
08:25
ruined the good name
08:27
of adolf hitler
08:29
and so he kept the name and i i always
08:31
for years i've known this as a kind of
08:32
qi-ish kind of thing and i've never kind
08:35
of thought to think of whatever happened
08:36
to his dream did it work i looked into
08:38
it ohio and america is the only place
08:41
now that has hitler named landmarks
08:43
they've got a hitler lake they've got a
08:45
hitler church they have a hitler park it
08:47
worked it worked hitler brought the name
08:49
background wow because what was he was
08:51
he like give me two months i'll bring
08:52
this back this will be a fine name again
08:55
like hitler did have um nephews in
08:57
liverpool didn't he yeah and one of them
09:00
uh
09:01
one of his nephews um
09:03
wrote an article in 1939 with the
09:05
headline why i hate my uncle
09:12
he gives you really bad presents at
09:13
christmas
09:15
shall we move on yeah let's move on to
09:17
our next fact
09:18
okay our next fact is from
09:22
ott
09:23
no oh sorry no uh diane
09:27
they are similar to be fair diane dupont
09:30
is that a name that yeah that's you okay
09:33
oh can you pass the microphone over okay
09:35
so while you pass that on i'll read one
09:37
of these um facts that we have from
09:40
at apatoo
09:42
and they said that canadian one dollar
09:45
coins are called loonies
09:47
and two dollar coins are called toonies
09:51
that's really cool
09:53
i'll tell you something about canada um
09:55
margarine was illegal in canada um from
09:58
around 1880 to around 1930 something
10:02
like that what was the reason um it was
10:03
a very powerful lobbying from the dairy
10:06
manufacturers they wanted it to be bank
10:08
because they thought that they would
10:09
bring taking away the butter business
10:11
and they banned it and then they brought
10:12
it back for a little time during first
10:14
world war because they needed something
10:16
yeah on the bread but yeah for a long
10:18
time and actually in some parts of
10:19
america as well in maine it was i think
10:20
there were seven states where my dream
10:22
was illegal at the start of the 20th
10:23
century yeah wisconsin
10:25
yeah
10:26
and um people would smuggle it over the
10:28
border
10:30
they had a diet blue they had to die of
10:32
blue yeah what's a blue pink what are
10:34
they good
10:35
in bags little dye packets so as not to
10:37
be confused with butter oh wow
10:41
so once again this is just an example of
10:43
the type of audience that we have when
10:44
we do a comedy game
10:46
most other gigs it's just people going
10:48
you suck get off we have corrections in
10:50
a in a told off sort of matter i wrote a
10:53
tweet earlier and i got corrected on it
10:54
in four different ways
10:57
within 10 minutes two mathematical one
10:59
uh simple counting thing which i hadn't
11:01
done and one scriptural
11:04
pretty good that's great does um this
11:07
lady diane stroke auto stroke whatever
11:10
your name is uh have you got a mic yeah
11:12
i do what was your fact the danish word
11:14
for 58 is actually short for eight and a
11:17
half 320s
11:19
58 is
11:21
eight eight and a half three twenties it
11:23
falls like a roman logical numeral logic
11:26
that's quite it's semi-similar but much
11:28
more complicated to french isn't it
11:30
which does you know um
11:33
yeah whatever this is much better i need
11:35
brackets to understand that yeah
11:37
i'm going to put it out there i
11:38
literally don't understand what that
11:39
means i'm not
11:41
even going to attempt to try and
11:42
comprehend it
11:44
did anyone try that maths quiz that was
11:46
all over the news yesterday that logic
11:48
quiz it was good wasn't it it was um was
11:50
it in sweden uh no
11:52
singapore
11:53
s countries
11:57
we could do this whole thing in call and
11:58
response like
12:00
like a queen gig
12:02
so what was it was a logic it was a
12:04
logic puzzle it was where a girl and her
12:06
two friends were she was trying to make
12:07
them guess when her birthday was and she
12:09
told one friend a date of her birthday
12:11
and the other friend the month of her
12:12
birthday and then there's a conversation
12:14
where i mean you look at that yeah
12:17
do you want to hear a really lame logic
12:19
joke
12:20
no
12:21
tough
12:23
uh it goes it's not mine uh three
12:25
logicians walk into a bar and the batman
12:27
says do you all want to drink and the
12:29
first guy says i don't know and the
12:31
second guy says i don't know and the
12:32
third guy goes yes
12:37
i don't think it's that type of crowd
12:39
james
12:39
[Laughter]
12:41
i'm not going to go for that kind of
12:42
stuff tonight
12:44
yeah the logic material didn't quite
12:46
work
12:48
it's a good one
12:51
okay i have another fact here and it
12:53
doesn't have a name oh it has a name on
12:55
the back from josephine josephine all
12:57
right so while that's making it over uh
12:59
here's another fact we got from twitter
13:01
uh from at i tim pilgrim jelly babies
13:04
were originally marketed under the name
13:06
unwanted babies
13:10
[Music]
13:15
okay josephine have you got a microphone
13:18
yes what would you like to tell us um
13:21
a rhinoceros beetle its towing capacity
13:23
is the same as um a man lifting nine
13:27
male elephants over his head
13:29
apparently wow wow yeah are they doing
13:32
it to show off or is it like uh
13:34
because i've i've i've not even lifted
13:36
one elephant
13:39
i could
13:41
i've just never felt the need
13:43
wow that's yeah i mean the idea with
13:45
this with um with insects is actually
13:48
it's because um
13:50
if you're a lot smaller it's a lot
13:51
easier to do stronger things and that's
13:53
because your muscle strength depends on
13:55
the cross-section of your muscle
13:58
which is a two-dimensional thing and
13:59
your side is a three-dimensional thing
14:01
and so it goes up quicker because you're
14:03
multiplying it three times rather than
14:04
two times i'm not explaining that very
14:06
well no no that's good i've always felt
14:07
inferior to ants because of this kind of
14:09
thing and that's
14:10
it's not because of that kind of thing
14:13
they work in a team
14:19
[Laughter]
14:24
there is one thing which is and it's i
14:26
think the strongest uh organism in
14:28
nature and it's a lot it's even smaller
14:30
than the rhinoceros beetle but uh it's
14:32
gonorrhea
14:34
gonorrhea can tow
14:35
something like a hundred thousand times
14:37
its own weight
14:39
which is um
14:40
which is probably why it's so successful
14:44
not from our perspective but it has
14:46
these uh filaments all around it called
14:48
pilli which it sort of crawls along
14:50
things with them and it has this huge
14:52
huge pulling capacity it's very cool
14:54
wouldn't andy make the most fantastic
14:55
sti doctor just as you're getting the
14:58
news so you got gone a really
15:00
interesting fact actually
15:04
do you know which dan which is your
15:06
strongest muscle in your body um
15:09
what would you say
15:11
my
15:13
tongue
15:14
oh muscle it's a reasonable guess but
15:16
it's wrong
15:17
and so the strongest absolutely will be
15:19
your ass your gluteus maximus and that's
15:21
pretty much because it's the biggest got
15:22
the biggest cross section
15:26
but the biggest by um by actual like not
15:29
my size but the biggest by like square
15:31
centimeter is not in your body but it
15:34
isn't anna's body it's the uterus
15:36
it's really strong
15:37
your uterus is actually very weak
15:41
sounds like a challenge let's
15:44
get your uterus out let's do this
15:46
every live show every live show he does
15:49
this
15:52
and a uterus has the strength equivalent
15:54
of a crossbow now i don't understand
15:56
what that means
15:58
i mean medieval castles when besieged
16:03
did not go to the uterus cabinet
16:07
does that so it's not saying if we like
16:09
rigged up an arrow uh somehow to our
16:11
uterus then we could propel it further
16:13
than a crossbow or not really crossbows
16:15
are much bigger so it's like per square
16:17
area
16:19
okay
16:20
that is a good fact just while we're
16:22
talking about the body quickly i've
16:23
developed a new thing on oh dear
16:25
[Laughter]
16:27
dan i have to tell you from the
16:28
disease's perspective it's doing great
16:35
no it's just it's an odd do you think
16:37
i've just in the last six months every
16:39
time i wake up i'm woken up by the sound
16:42
of my own body
16:44
from my face going
16:46
every time i wake up now like i swear to
16:48
god every morning every morning i've
16:50
woken up
16:52
what's happening to me
16:55
that's my question
16:57
i don't know what's happening to you but
16:58
have you considered donating to charity
17:03
swearing
17:04
there was a man in america i don't know
17:06
what made me think of this who was i
17:07
think he was executed uh and what
17:10
happened was they thought that he'd had
17:12
sex with a pig
17:13
and the reason that they thought they'd
17:15
had he'd had sex with a pig is because
17:16
the pig had given birth to a piglet that
17:19
looked a bit like him
17:27
even though he knows it's not true
17:29
that's the most insulting thing
17:31
there's no win in that whatsoever
17:34
that really reminds me of a story that i
17:36
remember richard madeley off richard and
17:38
julie telling years ago he went up to a
17:41
woman in a bus stop and he went bill hi
17:45
and this woman turned round and then
17:47
what are you talking about he said bill
17:49
right he was like we knew each other at
17:50
school and she was like no i'm jane and
17:52
he said oh sorry you just look so much
17:53
like bill i assumed you'd had a sex
17:54
change and it was you
17:58
bizarre thing to do say what you like
18:00
about richard madeley he's confident
18:04
oh should we move on to our next fact
18:06
okay this fact uh is from chris r who is
18:09
at maxfish do we have it do we have
18:10
chris uh hello
18:12
in the meantime shall i share my
18:14
favorite fact that i got via email
18:15
because i assume it's from someone who
18:16
wasn't on twitter lauren gilbert in 1958
18:20
khrushchev went to beijing to meet with
18:22
mao
18:23
mao proceeded to suggest a meeting while
18:25
swimming knowing full well that
18:27
khrushchev couldn't swim
18:29
aids instantly appeared with water wings
18:31
for chris chef and the meeting took
18:32
place with mao swimming up and down and
18:33
khrushchev flailing around in his
18:35
armbands
18:40
okay who has the microphone
18:42
hey hello hello
18:44
governor right um
18:47
the police department in cambridge
18:49
massachusetts requested that when the
18:51
harvard bridge between cambridge and
18:53
boston was refurbished in the 1980s that
18:55
the graffiti on it was maintained by the
18:58
people who created it because it became
19:00
useful in identifying where accidents
19:02
were on the bridge
19:04
so they would say by the penis
19:07
it was quite nerdy graffiti to be honest
19:09
okay oh yeah of course
19:12
got it okay um my favorite fact about
19:14
graffito
19:16
or graffiti is
19:18
which is it james which is it this is
19:20
about graffiti okay and it is that there
19:23
was um a christian group i think it was
19:25
in the south of france i think and they
19:28
were um clear cleaning up graffiti uh
19:32
and they were doing it because they were
19:34
very nice people and they started
19:35
cleaning and cleaning the cleaning and
19:36
then only afterwards did they found out
19:38
they'd actually cleaned off a load of
19:40
prehistoric cave paintings oh
19:45
my god how did i mean surely there's a
19:47
difference that you can tell between
19:49
that is true although they think that a
19:51
lot of prehistoric cave paintings were
19:53
done by teenage boys actually and a lot
19:56
of french graffiti is of buffalo's being
19:58
killed
20:01
can i read out because we got sent in so
20:03
we got an email when we said we need fax
20:05
for tonight and we got an email from a
20:06
lady called lauren gilbert who we just
20:08
had this fact from anna about khrushchev
20:10
uh which is that um so she gave us 10
20:12
and this was my favorite one i'm going
20:14
to read it out exactly word for word
20:16
what she's written f scott fitzgerald
20:18
bitched to hemingway that his dick was
20:20
too small
20:22
then went to the bathroom and hemingway
20:24
looked at it and pronounced it fine
20:29
he had a terrible injury didn't read to
20:30
his up i'm going off memory here
20:31
hemingway had a very bad shrapnel wound
20:33
possibly in the first world war which
20:35
sort of which uh dealt with severe
20:37
damage to that region the top of his
20:39
size and and his uh
20:41
parts and private parts and um that
20:44
there is a theory that that's why he was
20:45
so
20:46
about the big game hunting and fishing
20:48
so when so when fitzgerald showed him it
20:50
was sort of like
20:51
half hanging off and bleeding a bit
20:53
everywhere he went looks absolutely
20:55
normal to me
20:58
you're doing fine mate look at that
21:04
okay let's move on um steve akroyd where
21:07
are you okay can someone give the
21:08
microphone to steve there we are steve
21:10
what is your fact
21:12
so um the name garrett is now as of 2013
21:16
uh less popular in the uk that's by
21:19
people born within that year than both
21:21
the name thor and loki
21:24
wow what that is incredible wow but gary
21:28
actually isn't like an it isn't an old
21:30
name is it the first gary was a country
21:32
singer wasn't he someone's going to
21:34
shout out who it was gary cooper gary
21:36
cooper yeah that's very cooper he was
21:38
the first person pretty much i think
21:39
called gary and i think he might have
21:40
been named after a place called gary in
21:43
america
21:44
in indiana have you seen it
21:46
that the world expert on gary's is in
21:48
the audience
21:50
so
21:51
what other name knowledge do you have
21:52
then it's kind of limited to basically
21:54
that and i definitely learned it from a
21:56
different podcast i apologize
21:58
you brought someone else's fact from
21:59
another podcast to our show good do that
22:01
more
22:04
i thought i needed to raise the bar
22:05
[Laughter]
22:08
how many people in north korea do you
22:10
think are called kim jong-un uh do you
22:13
know the answer in french
22:16
is correct yeah there's only one person
22:18
called kim jong-un because he made it
22:22
uh no he made it the law that everyone
22:24
else who had the name had to change
22:25
their name to something else to gary
22:28
to be fair i don't reckon there are many
22:30
queen elizabeth ii
22:31
in britain
22:33
yeah but she did i guess it would be
22:34
elizabeth windsor would all the
22:36
elizabeth windsors would have to change
22:37
the name yeah does anyone here know
22:39
anyone called elizabeth windsor
22:41
there we are the seat nobody see nobody
22:43
knows anyone called elizabeth windsor
22:44
and that is a scientific experiment that
22:46
just happened right in front of your
22:47
eyes i got sent a fact by someone for
22:49
tonight and it was a fantastic fact it
22:52
was really good but i got so distracted
22:54
by his name that i forgot to write his
22:55
back down so
22:57
i don't have his fact now but i do have
22:58
his name and his name is andrew his
23:01
surname go to bed
23:04
as one word he's called andrew go to bed
23:07
and he goes by andy and he has a middle
23:09
name which is william but he goes by
23:10
will so andy will go to bed is his full
23:12
name
23:14
isn't that great
23:15
i found something about names the other
23:16
day this is just completely random now
23:18
but
23:19
the first
23:20
english the first teacher of the english
23:22
language in japan was called ronald
23:25
mcdonald
23:28
wow why did why did he move to japan
23:34
such a good thing that's great uh okay
23:36
another another one let's keep going
23:37
yeah let's pick another fact sent to us
23:39
by twitter this is from at 83 underscore
23:41
biss when the tooth of a mastodon was
23:44
found in north america it was identified
23:46
as the tooth of a giant
23:49
now that's very exciting to me because
23:51
if you've listened to this podcast uh we
23:53
talk i talk a lot about yetis and so on
23:56
i've worked out that's the period i
23:58
should have been born in
23:59
when someone's finding a big thing and
24:01
going well it's obviously the tooth of a
24:02
giant that's that's right there that's
24:04
when i should have been born
24:07
i would have been the man who was
24:08
clearly a giant and there we go mr
24:10
schreiber you are
24:12
well there was the other thing the first
24:14
dinosaur bone which they thought was a
24:16
scrotum of a giant and they called it
24:18
scrotum humanum
24:20
and it turned out to be a megalosaur i
24:21
think but by the strict rules of
24:24
nomenclature they should still call it
24:26
scrotum humanum because you're supposed
24:27
to call it the first thing that you
24:28
called it are you yeah wow so neglect i
24:32
still call it a scrotum human actually
24:34
but you as we've ascertained call it
24:36
graffito
24:39
that is true um sharks teeth when they
24:41
were just fossilized uh sharks t sharks
24:43
obviously go really many many millions
24:45
of years back and um often their teeth
24:48
are the only bit of them which survives
24:49
because they are all cartilage they
24:51
don't have any bone so we know we only
24:53
really know about fossil fossil sharks
24:55
or ancient sharks from their teeth but
24:57
they were thought to be
24:58
dragon's teeth
25:00
unsurprisingly and they were crushed
25:02
into powder and sold as a medicine wow
25:05
yeah and people still take bits of shark
25:07
as medicine to this day but they
25:08
shouldn't please uh don't do it because
25:10
it doesn't work
25:12
you just got a dead shark then and
25:14
you're not any better
25:16
uh okay another another one um esther
25:18
clark i really like the fact that people
25:21
say alcohol is not a solution but
25:23
according to chemistry alcohol is a
25:25
solution
25:29
that's very good
25:31
all right so you like the chemistry
25:33
jokes but you don't like the logic jokes
25:35
what's going on
25:37
i hope you don't work at an aaa center
25:40
all right alcohol is not the solution
25:42
except of course that it is the solution
25:44
okay
25:45
okay something's dissolved in something
25:47
to make it alcohol
25:48
yes you could have pure alcohol but it's
25:50
really hard to get hold of most about
25:52
most alcohol is in water so alcoholic
25:55
drinks are the solution
25:58
pure alcohol is not pure alcohol is
26:00
poisonous well that's very responsible
26:02
so you're not advocating pure alcohol no
26:04
i think that's okay
26:06
so i think if you put water and alcohol
26:08
together like 40 is about the the best
26:11
kind of solution for alcohol and and
26:13
water and the person who found that out
26:15
was mendeleev who did the um periodic
26:17
table and i think he did it for his
26:19
dissertation or something like that and
26:20
he worked that out so he was the first
26:22
person to do it how did mendelev work
26:24
out that 40 was the best he was a
26:26
chemist and he tried lots out and now
26:28
yeah so there's no his notebooks
26:30
increasingly spidery and slurs towards
26:33
the
26:34
55 to 45. that's okay if the giant ages
26:38
that age you should have been in i
26:39
should have lived in the age where you
26:40
could just drink loads of alcohol and
26:41
claim you're a chemist
26:46
and this also reminds me of another
26:48
brilliant fact that was sent in by email
26:50
by lauren i think um which was that the
26:52
first icbms the ballistic missiles um
26:55
placed by the ussr outside of the ussr
26:58
which were placed in east germany could
27:00
never have been used because the
27:01
soldiers in charge of them drank the
27:03
rocket fuel because it was made of
27:04
alcohol oh
27:06
no
27:08
that's like with the uh when um
27:10
it was uh they sent up a bit of bark
27:13
from the tree that newton uh was
27:15
apparently sitting under when he had the
27:17
apple when he realized the idea of
27:19
gravity they sent that up into space
27:21
with an apple and the idea was that they
27:23
were going to drop the apple and they
27:24
were going to drop the bit of bark
27:25
together so that they could experience a
27:27
lack of gravity so it was a very
27:28
exciting moment but they forgot to tell
27:30
some of the astronauts why the apple was
27:32
up there and so they ate it and then
27:34
they were like okay time to do the
27:35
experiments and they would go what
27:38
experiment
27:39
so they ended up doing the experiment
27:41
with a bit of bark and a pear that they
27:43
had
27:44
no one likes paris or the international
27:46
space station
27:48
um uh shall we move on to another fact
27:50
yeah you've got one i think yes i have
27:52
uh this is from adam hey adam hey so
27:55
pastor mike and while we're doing that i
27:56
got a um a tweet from someone called
27:59
olivia annie at olivia annie and she
28:02
sent me this fact that uh bucharest and
28:05
budapest are the fifth most mixed up
28:08
places in the world and she didn't say
28:10
what the first four were yeah
28:12
okay so surely slovenia and slovakia
28:15
yeah he was going to sleep in the top
28:16
yeah i don't know what the others are
28:18
but so i googled it and i found there
28:20
was a site called bucharest not
28:22
budapest.com
28:25
which collects all the different times
28:26
when people have mixed it up and um iron
28:29
maiden more chiba metallica and lenny
28:32
kravitz have all mistaken bucharest for
28:34
budapest on stage
28:37
cool okay where's the microphone
28:40
um the wages in chelsea and fulham are
28:43
so high that it's the only constituency
28:45
in the uk
28:46
where the average wage is higher than
28:48
the wage of their mp
28:50
wow
28:52
so their mp is like the working man
28:55
i know something about um i think it's
28:57
the constituency of kensington which is
29:00
nearby it's not not a million miles away
29:02
and um it has the highest proportion of
29:05
miners
29:06
as in m-i-n-e-r-s
29:09
in any constituency
29:11
in the country
29:12
and it's wow
29:15
what because it's a lot of people who
29:17
own mines basically
29:20
they say
29:21
occupation mining
29:26
okay let's move on let's try and get
29:27
some more in before we finish so um
29:28
chris who where is chris okay so apollo
29:31
13
29:33
nearly ended in disaster before it even
29:35
got to space because of a malfunction
29:37
that happened
29:38
but a second malfunction occurred that
29:40
saved the ship from being destroyed so
29:42
what did it fix the first malfunction
29:44
yeah pretty much what
29:47
that's very rare
29:51
good thing we have an astrophysicist on
29:53
the panel today
29:55
that's when i should have been born the
29:57
age of space
30:02
that's incredible that's amazing so okay
30:04
so because there's uh apollo 13 my
30:06
favorite movie of all time uh they're
30:09
genuinely is it a real thing that
30:10
happened as well as the movie yeah yeah
30:12
yeah yeah yeah
30:14
is it it's not your favorite event of
30:15
all time is it
30:16
it kind of is actually no because it's
30:18
uh to me apollo 13 is the greatest story
30:21
ever told you have a tin heading out
30:23
into deep space an explosion happens
30:26
they're told they have something like an
30:27
hour left of oxygen and they're gonna
30:29
die and everyone on the earth and three
30:31
men in a tin can have to solve it and
30:33
the only way that they can get back home
30:35
is to go that way towards the moon it's
30:37
insane that is and they made it home at
30:39
spoiler alert they made it home
30:42
alive and that is incredible and and
30:45
then obviously there's a big line in the
30:46
movie where as they're going up there is
30:48
a malfunction and they say there was a
30:50
glitch what was the line it was
30:51
something like uh yeah so they said
30:53
we've just had our glitch for this
30:54
mission we just had our glitch for this
30:55
mission not knowing that there was going
30:57
to be this explosion obviously why would
30:59
they have known
31:01
but so but this is an interesting fact
31:03
as well about about glitches and things
31:05
going wrong when you go into space there
31:07
was a book called moon dust and in it
31:08
someone from nasa was saying that on a
31:10
good successful space flight 99.99
31:14
of things work which means a typical
31:17
ship is six million parts that means on
31:19
a good flight they expect six thousand
31:21
things to break as they're going up did
31:23
you just do that in your head right then
31:25
no
31:26
[Applause]
31:27
i was trying to style that out and my
31:29
mouth didn't let me
31:31
six thousand yeah that's incredible six
31:33
thousand things can you imagine any
31:35
other job on the first time you use
31:36
something
31:37
six thousand things break if i was
31:39
running it i would take six thousand
31:41
very tiny very breakable glass plates
31:44
i'd smash all of them as we set off
31:47
and then presumably everything else
31:48
would work
31:48
[Laughter]
31:50
don't think you understand probability
31:51
at all all right
31:55
just another fact about um things going
31:56
wrong
31:57
in space my wife told me this um today
32:00
in fact and and that is that the two
32:03
biggest disasters in um rockets in uh
32:06
russian history both happened on the
32:08
24th of october on different years but
32:11
they happened on the same day and so to
32:12
this day in all the rocket fields and
32:14
stuff in russia they always turn all the
32:17
electricity off and close everything
32:18
down on that day just so it doesn't
32:20
happen again really
32:22
wow
32:23
um there are lots of uh russian
32:26
cosmonauts and astronaut superstitions
32:28
so
32:29
lots of things have built up over the
32:31
the years of the russian space program
32:32
so i think on the final drive to the um
32:36
what is it the liftoff point the to the
32:38
rocket ship to the rocket ship thank you
32:41
on the final drive the um the astronauts
32:43
will get out they'll stop the car
32:45
they'll get out and they'll have a wii
32:47
against the right back wheel i think it
32:50
is of the truck or that's because
32:53
that the first time
32:55
did it the first time what if you get
32:56
performance anxiety
32:58
and you can't go i'm pretty like yo we
33:00
need a launch i'm trying i'm trying
33:03
but f scott fitzgerald's going what the
33:05
is that
33:08
hemingway lied to me
33:15
okay should we keep going yeah let's see
33:17
well um this one is from sophie s
33:20
where are you sophia so right in the
33:21
corner so let's find another fact while
33:24
we're doing that
33:25
okay so here is the fact from at the
33:28
underscore imagesmith and that is if you
33:31
wanted to recreate the entire lego movie
33:33
with actual lego you would need 15
33:36
million 80
33:38
330 lego pieces
33:43
i mean yeah but why would you want to do
33:45
that
33:46
we've got the lego movie and it's the
33:47
best thing that's ever been done
33:50
yeah exactly have we got the microphone
33:52
so the uh yes
33:54
so my fact is when a dog enters a room
33:57
it knows what's happened two hours
33:59
before
34:02
what are you talking about
34:05
did you learn this back from me because
34:07
i don't think
34:08
so he knows what food was on the floor
34:10
and who wasn't in the room before and
34:13
is it through smell or through
34:15
oh it's through smell
34:17
but i can't tell anyone that's so nuts
34:22
mike was here
34:24
uh what are you saying buddy my
34:26
christmas
34:27
i think he's hungry
34:29
oh no what a curse what a curse
34:32
the idea is that um once we got uh dogs
34:35
our brains shrunk isn't it oh yeah and
34:37
that is because when we were hunting we
34:40
needed to be really good at picking up
34:41
scents and really good at hearing things
34:43
et cetera et cetera and so then we got
34:44
dogs and domesticated them and then we
34:47
didn't need to smell those things
34:49
anymore so that smell bit of our brain
34:50
shrunk and then we didn't need to hear
34:52
things and so they're hearing bit of our
34:53
brain shrunk and it's been shown that
34:55
humans that were around before dogs were
34:57
domesticated did have bigger brains yeah
35:00
wow i was bastard just a fact
35:03
there is a thing about uh anteaters
35:05
which is that um
35:07
when anteaters eat ants they don't
35:09
digest the ants that they eat the ants
35:12
digest themselves
35:14
because the ant anteaters they they
35:16
don't have um the proper acid in their
35:18
stomach but ants obviously have lots of
35:20
formic acid inside them so they just uh
35:23
digest themselves wait so they do that
35:25
as a kind of like
35:27
harry carry kind of thing
35:35
the whole load of ants down so anteaters
35:37
have now again got rid of that
35:38
unnecessary bit of their digestive
35:40
system which they don't need anymore
35:42
that is actually a bit like and actually
35:43
i think someone also wrote this fact
35:44
down today that um baby pandas can't
35:46
digest eucalyptus can they but it's
35:48
koalas sorry sorry
35:50
potato
35:52
whose fact was that come up here quickly
35:54
and sad uh was that baby koala's kinda
35:57
just eucalyptus when they're first born
35:58
so they have to get the bacteria from
36:00
their mother's kind of poo
36:02
to be able to digest eucalyptus i don't
36:04
reckon humans would be able to digest
36:05
stuff without the bacteria in their
36:07
stomachs and you get the bacteria from
36:09
your mother through the breast milk yeah
36:11
so like a baby probably wouldn't be able
36:13
to digest you know ben and jerry's ice
36:16
cream or
36:18
damn it
36:19
it's not weird that that's the most
36:20
indigestible thing i could think of yeah
36:22
yeah
36:24
you think what's the thing that's least
36:26
like baby food in the world
36:29
colder milk
36:31
you could have said steak or salmon on
36:33
crude
36:34
we we actually put out on twitter we
36:36
said you could win two tickets tonight
36:37
if you come up with a fact which is uh
36:40
was who was that
36:42
was that you can you just yell out your
36:43
fat because it's about ben and jerry's
36:45
isn't it
36:46
lemon jerry's milk comes from massaged
36:48
cows what
36:50
so and i read into it basically ben and
36:52
jerry's they have a big farm and they
36:53
really look after their cows including
36:55
before they milk them they're just like
36:56
how are you today sir
36:59
ma'am i guess
37:02
that's not milk
37:03
[Laughter]
37:07
and that's why i was kicked out of the
37:08
bull ranch
37:13
um who's got the microphone we had
37:14
another fact uh coming out didn't we oh
37:16
no we don't let's oh no okay uh anna
37:20
no i think i think it's another runner
37:22
is that right oh there's another owner
37:24
at the front okay let's find another
37:25
fight from our
37:26
twitter list
37:28
okay so i got one here
37:30
at timothee underscore johnson the motto
37:33
of the salvation army is blood and fire
37:39
they were very unpopular for a while
37:42
people really didn't like the salvation
37:43
army maybe that was the branding issue
37:47
no they were i mean they're a christian
37:49
organization and i think it was william
37:51
booth who set up the salvation army and
37:53
he was known as the general he was an
37:54
incredibly organized and strict man and
37:56
there was another uh army which was set
37:58
up in opposition to the salvation army
38:01
called i think the skeleton army oh yeah
38:04
and they made it their business to
38:05
disrupt the salvation army in all their
38:07
good works and they were bastards they
38:09
were yeah they were really unpleasant
38:11
people and they threw rocks at them and
38:12
they threw you know burning stuff at the
38:14
salvation whenever they turned up trying
38:16
to help
38:17
um yeah wow not funny but you know but
38:19
with their motto flowers and candy
38:25
um should we go i know what was your
38:27
fact actually thomas is better
38:29
well why don't you tell us both and
38:30
we'll decide which is the better fact
38:32
okay
38:33
um so since uh 1945 all british tanks
38:36
must come equipped with team making
38:38
supplies
38:40
that's fantastic
38:42
that's how i imagine you exist in life
38:45
andy you you're in a tank and there's
38:47
tea in there yep that's that's bad weak
38:50
milky tea by the way if it's sandy but
38:52
anyway that's an officer this is office
38:54
stuff this is why i say you can't work
38:56
in a team
38:58
you're constantly throwing shade on my
39:00
teeth
39:02
the worst thing is the milk came from
39:04
dan
39:04
[Laughter]
39:12
should we let's hear the second fact
39:14
okay no also i've read that all um that
39:16
uh is it jcbs are so popular as a
39:19
digging machines because they all have
39:20
kettles inside them that was the main
39:22
feature it wasn't they dug better when
39:23
they could carry more stuff they just
39:25
have a kettle on board so you can make a
39:27
cup of tea yeah absolutely
39:29
so what's the rival fact yeah
39:32
i didn't know it was a rival effect
39:34
it is now
39:35
um okay so uh joseph stalin had um
39:40
some russian scientists attempt to
39:42
create an ape human hybrid because he
39:45
thought it would be useful uh in russian
39:47
industry and we'll be able to battle
39:48
with stan payne and how are you getting
39:50
on them
39:54
whoa
39:56
i call her foul
39:58
how far down the process did he get well
40:01
i i don't know but they enjoyed the
40:03
dinner but the bedroom was a complete
40:04
disaster
40:06
well it was ultimately a failure and
40:08
anyhow
40:10
no
40:13
i mean he had the uh the scientist who
40:15
was leading the project exiled to
40:17
kazakhstan for failing
40:20
wow that's tough because he probably
40:22
didn't want that project in the first
40:23
place
40:24
[Laughter]
40:26
there was a there was a prediction you
40:27
know these cool old predictions they
40:29
have of how life is going to be in the
40:30
21st century from 100 years ago and
40:32
they're always either spookily right or
40:34
ridiculous and one of them said that we
40:36
won't have to drive our cars anymore
40:38
this is from i think the 20s but i'm
40:40
going off memory we won't have to drive
40:41
our cars anymore because we will have a
40:43
race of hyper-intelligent monkey butler
40:46
creatures which will do the driving for
40:49
us that's the only thing we'll have
40:50
taught them to do this ties in nicely
40:51
with the twitter fact that we got sent
40:53
by a guy called ewan taylor uh which is
40:55
sorry this is facebook in 1953 nascar
40:58
driver tim flock raced for eight races
41:01
with a rhesus monkey named jocko flocco
41:04
as his co-driver
41:08
so maybe he was trying to start the
41:09
revolution there or the evolution i
41:12
don't know whatever
41:13
um we should let's do one more and we
41:15
should wrap up because
41:17
anna yeah anna go for it yeah sorry i i
41:19
think i forgot about the whole
41:20
fact-choosing thing
41:20
[Laughter]
41:22
okay
41:23
it's from steve steve yeah yeah it's
41:25
about particle accelerators yes this is
41:28
the kind of crowd in which we could have
41:29
two steves who both brought a fact about
41:32
very true okay let's read something out
41:35
uh i've got one um this is from uh at
41:38
tbuk2buck2
41:42
it's a twitter name
41:44
you may have already done this one a
41:45
consultant urologist at musgrove park
41:47
hospital in taunton somerset
41:50
is named nicholas burns cox
41:53
he's my friend's dad no
41:56
really
41:58
hello did you send us that fact no oh my
42:02
god cool
42:04
very cool i'm from taunton he's really
42:06
nice wow my mum's from the taunton vale
42:09
yeah it's a nice place
42:13
can i just say we're focusing on the
42:15
wrong bit of the fact here
42:16
[Laughter]
42:19
[Applause]
42:20
um
42:21
taunton's nice isn't it yeah
42:23
yeah
42:25
lovely in the summer oh yeah yeah yeah
42:27
yeah um bridgewater said more all less
42:29
oh no
42:31
who is a urologist's granddaughter or
42:33
daughter owns napoleon's penis now
42:34
doesn't she what
42:36
uh i think
42:38
penis has been bought and rebought over
42:39
the years and disappeared and then it
42:41
was left with a urologist who died and
42:42
he left it in his will to his daughter
42:44
yeah there's a lot so there's a lot of
42:45
famous um historical male penises that
42:48
have been passed down through families
42:51
male penises yeah just just words um any
42:54
male uteruses there
42:57
napoleon was described at auction as a
42:58
mummified tendon which is quite a
43:00
delicate way of putting it
43:01
but it was it was an
43:03
inch long but it was described by scott
43:05
fitzgerald as a very very good size
43:11
okay okay last fact final fact is from
43:14
steve
43:15
so
43:16
the only man to ever stick his head in
43:18
the path of a particle accelerator
43:21
not only lived to complete his phd
43:24
but also seems to have not aged since
43:26
the accident
43:27
what whoa
43:29
wait what's the accident this week
43:32
it was in 1978. what so
43:35
uh anatoly bukowski uh was a researcher
43:38
at
43:39
something that i can't remember the name
43:41
of because i'm in a basement and my
43:43
notes have vanished up there with the
43:44
wi-fi yeah i think how we feel yeah i
43:46
know basically he was a researcher at a
43:49
an institute
43:50
trying to complete his phd
43:52
and um it was time to fix the particle
43:55
accelerator he stuck his head in it
43:58
yeah and the safety was apparently not
44:01
working as well as it should have and
44:03
all of a sudden the particle accelerator
44:05
fired and a beam passed through his head
44:09
and he according to his own words he
44:11
didn't feel any pain but he did see a
44:13
light brighter than a thousand suns yeah
44:16
wow um and the left side of his face is
44:19
pretty much
44:20
no wrinkles is he begging to shove the
44:23
other side of his head into there
44:25
because presumably that's he's actually
44:27
been interested for like uh western
44:30
scientists to come over and
44:32
say and hang out with him and say what's
44:33
going on in my brain
44:35
but he can't afford it wow
44:38
yeah this is crying out for a
44:39
kickstarter we'll go
44:43
spacey dino man and the logician
44:45
[Laughter]
44:48
all right well let's wrap up the show
44:49
and and visit him um
44:52
thank you so much guys for coming to
44:53

44:56
know it was going to be chaotic but
44:57
actually i'm just putting this out there
44:59
as a as someone who edits stuff uh

[Applause]
00:06
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:09
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:12
this week coming to you from the
00:13
edinburgh fringe festival my name is dan
00:15
schreiber please welcome to the stage
00:17
the other three elves it's anna
00:19
chazinski james harkin and andy murray
00:30
and once again we have gathered around
00:31
the microphones with our four favorite
00:33
facts from the last seven days and in no
00:35
particular order here we go starting
00:37
with you andy murray my fact this week
00:40
is that the first man to swim the
00:41
english channel later had a show where
00:43
he floated in a tank for two hours
00:46
that was his show uh his name was
00:48
matthew webb and um to get extra funding
00:51
he would do a special endurance show
00:52
where he floated in the tank for 128
00:55
hours
00:56
whoa that's one hour better than the guy
00:58
stuck in the rock yeah
01:01
probably as interesting as well in terms
01:03
of a feature-length movie yeah
01:05
i mean without a floatation device
01:07
without a floatation device that's
01:09
really impressive it's very impressive
01:10
yeah in a boat it's not quite as
01:11
impressive
01:14
it's just basically a big swimming pool
01:15
right where he's just paddling around
01:18
yeah i'm treading water i guess is what
01:19
he was doing yeah okay yeah um
01:21
so he wasn't lying on his back that's
01:23
not floating i think that's just
01:24
swimming like a child he got very
01:26
philosophical very early on
01:29
the first time he ever did this kind of
01:30
floating for as long as possible it was
01:32
against a newfoundland dog
01:34
he had a bet that he'd be able to float
01:36
for longer than a dog and he won his bet
01:38
did the dog die
01:40
as they fished the dog out
01:42
victory for webb
01:44
i mean did the dog even know it was
01:45
taking part in a bed
01:49
captain webb won a year's supply of
01:50
pedigree chum
01:52
so this this is captain webb this is who
01:54
we're talking about british hero yeah
01:56
and he was he was he was amazing he this
01:57
was 1875 when he did this and uh when he
02:00
swam the channel that is and after that
02:02
he tried he didn't really stay famous he
02:05
tried to keep himself famous by doing
02:06
these endurance events and things like
02:08
that but he found it quite hard but i
02:10
read that he was so famous that when he
02:11
came back from the channel swimming and
02:13
he went back to his hometown with a band
02:15
procession going on he was so loved that
02:17
even a pig got up on its trotters to
02:19
look at him as he went by
02:22
did the pig know that it was taking part
02:23
in a procession
02:26
in 1883 just eight years after he was
02:28
the hero of the nation he tried to swim
02:31
across a particular bit of the river uh
02:33
down from niagara falls and it was
02:35
extremely dangerous and more than 10 000
02:38
people turned up to watch him and he
02:39
drowned there uh he was dragged under a
02:41
current and his body was found a few
02:43
days later and he was doing it to try
02:44
and provide for his family so i was
02:46
going through the newspaper archives and
02:48
before he did it every single headline
02:50
about what he was about to do said you
02:52
know webb engages in suicidal endeavor
02:55
every headline went a fool's errand
02:57
totally mad everyone predicts he will
02:59
die there's a whirlpool about you know
03:01
20 yards down the river into which he
03:03
will definitely be sucked and perish and
03:05
he went on and did it anyway i just
03:06
wonder if he read any of that
03:09
he didn't like to read his own press he
03:11
was a very modest man but actually
03:13
everyone thought that he would die when
03:14
he swam the channel as well it was it
03:16
was 34 kilometers but it actually took
03:18
him 64 kilometers to swim it because of
03:20
all the currents and he just went in a
03:22
real zigzag i refused to ask for
03:24
directions
03:27
and he smothered himself in poor poised
03:29
fat to keep oh yeah which is quite good
03:32
and um towards the end he got really
03:34
tired but then a boat went past and
03:36
everyone on the boat started singing raw
03:38
britannia to keep him going
03:40
and i don't know if this would have been
03:42
an encouragement or put him off but
03:43
apparently his coach arthur payne used
03:45
to jump in occasionally and swim
03:47
alongside him which i would find really
03:49
irritating
03:50
hey man this is easy
03:53
i read also at one stage that he had a
03:55
run-in with a pop ice
03:58
why are you covered in poor boys fat
03:59
what have you done with my friends
04:02
i think that might have been it they
04:03
might have confused him smells like a
04:05
porpoise looks like a poor place
04:08
but there was actually someone who went
04:10
across the channel before him he was
04:11
called paul the fearless frogman boynton
04:15
and then
04:16
he did manage to get across but he was
04:18
wearing a rubber suit with a paddle and
04:20
a sail
04:24
he towed a boat behind him i think which
04:26
had his
04:26
supplies in it
04:28
he towed a boat and it's much more
04:29
impressive than matthew
04:31
i mean he had a sale i think he had some
04:33
kind of a small like makeshift clockwork
04:35
motor thing i'm i'm not sure where we
04:37
draw the line at swimming but i think
04:39
that is not sweaty the suit sounds
04:41
amazing it could support you so help you
04:42
float in the water and also you could
04:44
store nine days worth of food in the
04:46
pockets
04:49
basically it was a publicity stunt to
04:50
sell this suit um because he called it
04:52
the lifesaving suit he was actually the
04:54
guy he um set up the first ever theme
04:56
park in america and then he set up what
04:58
became coney island
05:00
and then he befriended sea lions and
05:02
used to appear in silent films with them
05:04
all the time hang on
05:06
you just they were who we are sea lions
05:09
yeah he performed in films with sea
05:10
lions these sea lions know they were
05:12
being befriended
05:15
um
05:16
even cooler than there was someone who
05:18
swam across before even um what was it
05:21
paul the amazing frogman boy fearless
05:23
frogman um
05:25
it was a guy called uh william hoskins
05:28
and this was in 1862 and he kick-paddled
05:30
his way across on a bale of straw
05:34
i was the first man to go across the
05:36
channel not in a boat do you guys know
05:38
who the best living swimmer alive today
05:41
is
05:42
um michael phelps uh no so this is for
05:45
long distance um i'm talking it's a guy
05:47
called uh martin strell okay he had a
05:50
lot of tv shows so actually might be a
05:51
name familiar to those listening and
05:52
those here tonight um he's uh he's an
05:55
amazing guy he's a slovenian uh long
05:56
distance swimmer he swam the entire
05:58
amazon river first person ever to do
06:00
that the danube the yangtze um he did
06:03
that he did the danube in one go he swam
06:06
for 84 hours straight he lost 40 pounds
06:08
by the time he got out he was 40 pounds
06:10
lighter and along the way and along
06:12
every single swim that he does he drinks
06:14
two bottles of wine he has just a
06:16
favorite white wine i think it is that
06:18
he drinks but they're sort of like um
06:20
thresher shops along the way
06:24
the amazon is much better provided for
06:26
than i realized
06:27
that's where thresher sharks get their
06:28
name actually oh really then
06:31
[Laughter]
06:34
this is this is how hardcore he is with
06:35
his swimming um he hasn't swam the nile
06:37
yet and he's been asked why have you not
06:39
swam the nile and he said that it's
06:41
neither long or challenging enough well
06:43
it is like the second longest river in
06:44
the world i know he said it's just like
06:46
a small creek this guy is a liar i see
06:49
that when people say why have you never
06:50
fought a lion they are neither large nor
06:52
fierce enough for me so
06:54
it's not worth me wasting my time
06:58
um we're gonna have to move on in about
06:59
two minutes can i can i tell you one
07:01
more guy who i found out about in terms
07:03
of the annals of cross channel swimming
07:04
history this is one of my favorite ever
07:06
people his name is bob platten i don't
07:08
know much about him but he crossed the
07:10
channel on an iron bedstead in 1961
07:13
which he had attached floating barrels
07:15
to um then in 1963 he surpassed himself
07:18
he went over on a barrel with an
07:19
outboard motor
07:21
[Laughter]
07:22
eventually commercialism crept in in
07:24
1969 he went across again in a shoe
07:27
sponsored by british leather
07:31
um and then in 1965 he crossed in a gin
07:33
bottle sponsored by gilbee's gin
07:36
hang on where do we get these oversized
07:38
gin bottles
07:41
what a guy uh okay it's time for fact
07:44
number two and that is my fact my fact
07:46
this week is that the first item sold on
07:49
ebay was a broken laser pointer yeah and
07:53
it was bought by a man who collects
07:55
broken laser pointers
07:58
it genuinely was do you think he ever
08:00
buys working laser pointers and then
08:02
breaks them so that they can go in his
08:04
collection
08:06
yeah that's a good question because he
08:07
would have thought a working laser
08:08
pointer is actually easier to come
08:09
across than a broken laser pointer yeah
08:12
hmm the guy who sold it did he know that
08:14
someone might want a broken laser
08:16
pointer or was he like just scamming
08:18
people it was the creator of of ebay so
08:20
prior to ebay being called ebay it was
08:22
called auction web and auction web was
08:24
his little sideline there's a bit of a
08:26
mythology that he set it up he set ebay
08:28
up because his wife had a huge
08:30
collection of pez dispensers she wanted
08:32
to get rid of and he thought let's do it
08:34
that way and that was actually marketed
08:36
i think through ebay themselves saying
08:37
that was the case turns out it's not
08:39
true but so it was the guy who set up
08:41
ebay so this guy who um started ebay
08:43
yeah it was called auction web but it
08:44
was on ebay.com i think and he had some
08:47
other sites on ebay.com as well and one
08:49
of them was an ebola information site
08:52
that was the first thing on ebay.com a
08:54
place to find out where ebola's
08:55
happening yeah he was weirdly obsessed
08:57
with ebola right yeah in the 90s before
08:59
it was kind of fashionable
09:02
and
09:03
he employed a marketing guy who was like
09:05
you really have to down no one
09:06
wants it people just want to buy stuff
09:09
another thing sold on ebay um or well
09:11
they tried to sell this and actually got
09:13
taken off uh iceland the country
09:15
[Music]
09:16
and this was this part of the
09:18
description bjork not included
09:23
there was did you read about the
09:24
musician who sold what he claimed was
09:26
the world's longest hula hoop
09:28
so it was three inches um and this was
09:29
last year i think and uh
09:31
[Laughter]
09:33
whoa andy you missed out
09:35
how much did it go for it went well
09:37
someone bid 712 pounds for it if i had
09:40
known about this at the time i'm so
09:42
sorry i would cheerfully have three
09:44
inches of hula hoop but you know what's
09:45
really sad about this guy or um kind of
09:48
nice he said he was going to use any
09:49
funds he raised of selling stuff on ebay
09:51
to fund his commune that he wanted to
09:53
set up and uh one of the things he first
09:55
tried to sell was his love on ebay
09:59
he put that up there he said he was
10:01
willing to sit quietly somewhere and
10:02
send you good vibes and love for five
10:04
pounds five pounds was the maximum he
10:06
got for that and then he got 712 for an
10:08
oversized hulu yeah looking at andy i
10:10
think you'd rather have the hulu
10:11
definitely rather
10:13
can you imagine opening the packet and
10:15
finding that
10:16
it would be so exciting i mean the
10:18
packets are barely four inches long
10:21
you know
10:21
sorry yes but love andy love
10:24
i want a massive hula hoop
10:27
that was actually i know this seems
10:28
implausible but this was last year and
10:30
then there was a 26 year old woman in
10:32
march this year who found a bigger hula
10:33
hoop which she then fell on ebay
10:36
did she get more for it that was five
10:37
inches long i don't think she actually
10:39
got offered as much because the craze
10:40
was kind of over by that point i feel
10:42
there isn't enough astonishment in the
10:43
room about this
10:46
the normal hula hoop is about a tenth as
10:48
long as that
10:50
um so in 2004
10:53
there was a sale on ebay of some water
10:56
that elvis had left in a cup
10:58
it went for 237 quid all the equivalent
11:01
in dollars and it was from a plastic cup
11:03
that he'd sipped from in north carolina
11:05
in 1977. but isn't it true that the
11:07
person who sold it kept the cup he kept
11:09
the cup yes
11:11
so he said he would he sent out the
11:12
water but the cup was yeah and he said
11:15
he said at the time i promise this thing
11:16
is 100 legitimate
11:18
[Laughter]
11:20
did i have a certificate that went with
11:21
it with him just writing seriously i
11:23
promise
11:24
um can i mention a few things about
11:26
lasers very quickly because so he broke
11:28
this uh the fact was a broken laser
11:30
pointer um i read that the the sort of
11:34
founding father of laser technology died
11:37
just this year charles towns he he
11:40
originally came up not with the laser he
11:42
sort of had the one just before it was
11:43
called the mazer um
11:45
but i mean how amazing that that
11:48
he was able to see how far it's coming
11:50
you know he made it into a bond movie
11:51
with his invention bond's crotch was
11:53
almost burnt off wasn't it by his
11:54
invention in the novel apparently it was
11:57
a circular saw that he was attacked by
11:59
rather than the laser really apparently
12:01
but they put the laser in the movie to
12:03
make it a bit more exciting the way that
12:05
they worked it is they had a special
12:07
effects man underneath the table and he
12:09
was burning um cutting through the table
12:11
from beneath with a kind of a torch and
12:15
apparently because he was doing that it
12:17
meant that sean connery was sweating and
12:20
worried in the same way that he would
12:21
have been if a laser was coming from
12:22
above because not only was this kind of
12:24
being cut from below the guy below
12:26
couldn't see where he was cutting to
12:29
and also when the director wants the
12:31
shot to end he'll shout cut
12:33
[Laughter]
12:37
um this this guy charles towns uh when
12:40
he invented the laser uh everyone or as
12:43
he was proposing it he needed funding
12:45
and he asked for funding and everyone in
12:47
the scientific community thought that he
12:48
was insane that it wouldn't work it was
12:50
going against certain laws that were in
12:52
place about physics and and the world
12:55
and they said that this is yeah why dr
12:57
schreiber please can't understand the
12:59
word you're saying
13:01
we have a lay audience here
13:04
yeah so science uh said that it couldn't
13:07
work and so he he still went along with
13:10
it and niels bohr who's you know very
13:11
famous physicist said this is not gonna
13:13
work to the point where eventually a few
13:15
scientists said we need to write to him
13:17
we that we actually know the letter that
13:19
was sent to him which was by isidor
13:20
isaac rabbi and this is genuine look
13:23
you should stop the work you were doing
13:25
it isn't gonna work
13:27
you know it's not gonna work
13:28
we know it's not gonna work
13:30
you're wasting money
13:32
just stop
13:35
and then three months later was the
13:36
first successful experiment of the laser
13:38
wow
13:40
amazing that's so cool someone's used a
13:42
laser cutter to imprint a song onto a
13:44
tortilla
13:48
it should be for it to work best it
13:50
should be an uncooked tortilla if you
13:52
wanted to try it and they printed a
13:54
mexican dance onto it it didn't sound
13:56
very good actually but you can watch on
13:57
youtube charles townes would i think be
13:59
glad to know
14:02
um okay we're gonna have to move on to
14:04
our next fact and that is cecinski uh
14:07
yes my fact is that uh when alexander
14:11
fleming's neighbors foiled a burglary at
14:13
his house as a thank you gift he gave
14:16
them some mold
14:18
[Laughter]
14:19
uh this is kind of predictable possibly
14:22
for everyone who knows who alexander
14:23
fleming is he gave them the mold not
14:25
just some mold so he gave them the like
14:27
first penicillin culture so this guy
14:29
that was really short before he died
14:30
actually and his neighbors saw burglars
14:32
uh trying to burgle his house and they
14:34
stopped them and they called the police
14:36
and then they received a letter shortly
14:38
afterwards from alexander fleming and
14:40
mrs montgomery his housekeeper
14:42
saying look enclosed is some mold and
14:45
then mrs montgomery clarified she wrote
14:47
something along the lines of as though
14:48
you didn't know but just in case this
14:50
said affair is a blob of the original
14:52
mould of penicillin not to be confused
14:54
with gorgonzola cheese
14:56
now i was going to say how did they know
14:58
it was the original mold it's a bit like
15:00
elvis's water isn't it it's just a
15:01
letter saying no it really is the
15:03
original mold and they kept the petri
15:05
dish that it had grown in actually it
15:06
just gave them the mold
15:10
fleming had a very high star rating on
15:11
ebay so i think it was a it was a
15:14
trustworthy seller by that point so this
15:16
just went up for auction didn't it it
15:17
sure did yeah yeah do you know how much
15:19
it sold for was it 712 pounds in a hotly
15:22
contested race with a three inch long
15:23
hula
15:24
hoop and you don't know how ebay works
15:28
which one will i get the hula people the
15:30
mold
15:32
andy just bids for everything on ebay
15:33
and the hope that one day
15:35
[Laughter]
15:38
it's sold for 4
15:41
720 pounds
15:43
are you thinking that's not much i'm
15:44
pissed off that's such an achievable
15:46
amount to buy i'm so glad you said this
15:47
is exactly i wanted to call you up and
15:49
say why didn't we get together and buy
15:51
this yeah
15:52
[Laughter]
15:57
but he discovered it really far before
16:00
it was used uh medicine didn't he he
16:01
discovered it in about 1928 and then he
16:04
wrote a paper on it saying this has
16:05
antibiotic properties this could be very
16:06
useful you couldn't quite get it working
16:08
that was yeah and nobody paid any
16:09
attention for another 10 years there was
16:11
this huge argument over who had really
16:13
invented it or made it useful for
16:15
mankind oh did they argue over it
16:16
because they shared the nobel prize uh
16:18
florian chain and fleming there was a
16:20
guy called uh elm roth wright who worked
16:22
with fleming who wrote a letter to the
16:24
time saying actually it was me who came
16:26
up with that not him wow and then the
16:28
press all went down to speak to both of
16:30
them fleming worked for this big company
16:31
actually and he was you know he did find
16:33
it but he worked for this big company
16:34
and he was just like a small cog in it
16:36
really but the press went down to speak
16:38
to them but the reason that we all kind
16:39
of know fleming today is because he had
16:41
such a good story he came from a humble
16:43
background he supposedly came up with it
16:45
serendipitously like there was a little
16:47
petri dish on his desk and it just
16:49
accidentally grew and it was just a
16:50
better story and the other story was
16:52
like basically a group of international
16:54
researchers working in the states
16:59
snore
17:01
there was the accidental discovery he
17:02
went away for a trip and then he came
17:04
back and he found that he had a load of
17:06
bacterial cultures and one of them
17:08
the bacteria weren't growing and it was
17:09
because the mold had supposedly drifted
17:11
in through the window i i read a really
17:13
interesting set of articles about the
17:15
idea that they think that um that he got
17:18
to his to to noticing what was going on
17:21
because he was an artist
17:23
he painted he painted a lot but he
17:25
didn't use
17:26
actual colors that you would buy in
17:27
shops and so on he grew his colors in
17:30
petri dishes he would like have this
17:31
petri dish with different microbes in
17:33
them and some of them would grow green
17:35
and that would be grass some would grow
17:36
blue that would be the the sky and it
17:38
would just make these beautiful little
17:40
images and the great thing was is they
17:41
would only last for a few like days and
17:44
then they would all grow into each other
17:45
so it's really a trend that's amazing
17:46
isn't that crazy so he used to paint
17:48
things like ballerinas horses mothers
17:50
feeding children stick figures fighting
17:53
i mean that's that's pretty cool
17:55
conveniently they didn't last long so
17:57
after a few days they disappeared so we
17:58
have no evidence they were any good at
18:00
all well he used to show them to people
18:02
and people wrote about them and one day
18:03
he showed them to queen mary who said i
18:06
don't see the point of these
18:07
[Laughter]
18:09
apparently he was alexander fleming was
18:11
very bad at conversation
18:13
and his on his entry on the oxford
18:15
dictionary of national biography um this
18:17
was how someone put it as one visitor
18:20
put it talking with him was like playing
18:21
tennis with a man who whenever you
18:23
knocked the ball over to his side put it
18:25
in his pocket
18:31
that is such a good description of so
18:33
many conversations we've all had
18:36
with james
18:43
he did say i really like this quote from
18:45
him uh when he was interviewed about
18:46
discovering penicillin he said when i
18:48
woke up just after dawn on september 28
18:50
1928 i certainly didn't plan to
18:52
revolutionize all medicine by
18:54
discovering the world's first antibiotic
18:57
but i suppose that was exactly what i
18:59
did
19:00
wow i reckon whenever you had a
19:01
conversation with him that was always
19:03
his reply to no matter what you said
19:06
um here's something cool about
19:08
penicillin so uh after they so in about
19:11
the late 30s 38 39 um it was really
19:14
really costly and very very labor
19:15
intensive to make more of it and you
19:17
needed 2 000 liters of mold culture
19:20
fluid to get enough pure penicillin to
19:22
treat a single patient
19:24
um so obviously that was you know
19:26
incredibly time consuming and difficult
19:27
and laborious so to make up the
19:29
shortfall the researchers extracted it
19:31
from the urine of patients who had
19:33
already taken it
19:34
so
19:35
when you take penicillin 40 to 99
19:38
of it is excreted about four hours later
19:40
because your kidney's very good at
19:41
getting rid of it um so you could take
19:43
the urine crystallize it extract the
19:45
penicillin and give it to the patient in
19:47
the next bed how weird is that wow that
19:49
is strange so you're literally taking
19:51
the piss yes
19:51
[Laughter]
19:56
um this confused me about so the
19:57
original fact about the penicillin being
19:59
sold on ebay in the scientific american
20:02
article where i initially read this the
20:03
title was fleming's original penicillin
20:06
culture sold at auction and there was a
20:08
little note at the bottom a correction
20:09
saying in tiny writing this article was
20:12
originally published with the title old
20:14
mold sold
20:17
why did you change that
20:20
um so penicillin camemberty is the mold
20:23
which is used to make camembert and it's
20:26
naturally green and so camabear always
20:28
used to be green and then suddenly it
20:30
started to get a bit whiter and then
20:32
humans selected it to get whiter and
20:34
whiter and whiter and now it's white but
20:36
only a few hundred years ago camembert
20:38
was all green wow is it good for you if
20:41
you take
20:42
camembert i hate sir three times a day
20:45
i would say it's worth a try yeah in
20:48
asian egypt and they used to whack moldy
20:50
bread onto their wounds i think they did
20:52
and i thought that was one of the first
20:54
uses of the effects of penicillin
20:56
and the way that they used to make
20:57
camember is they used to get bread and
20:59
put it in a cave and then the bread
21:01
would get moldy and moldy and moldy and
21:02
then they get the bread out and then
21:04
kind of turn it into a dust and then
21:05
they put the dust into the cheese and
21:07
that's how they got cumber
21:09
we're gonna have to move on i got one
21:11
last thing um penicillin the name itself
21:14
penicillin he didn't come up with for
21:16
quite a few months
21:18
so he had a working title i think they
21:20
should have kept it mold juice
21:22
[Laughter]
21:27
that's very good
21:28
okay time for our final fact of the
21:31
evening and that is james harkin okay my
21:34
fact this week is that the earliest
21:36
known ice cream recipe suggests
21:38
flavoring with poo
21:40
[Laughter]
21:43
if this is what haagen-dazs belgian
21:44
chocolate is i'm gonna be very upset
21:48
uh no they offered lots of different
21:49
things orange flower water was one of
21:51
the things and the other one was
21:52
ambergris which is whale poo
21:54
ah so not human everyone's so
21:56
disappointed
21:58
so yeah ambergris is um sperm whale poo
22:01
uh it's when a sperm whale eats a squid
22:03
and the beak is indigestible and so its
22:06
body creates mucus and vomiting covering
22:08
of the squid speak
22:09
and then it expels it almost always
22:11
through the anus and people in the olden
22:14
days really like the taste of it and
22:15
they described it as earthy and mildly
22:18
fecal wow and apparently this was the
22:21
kind of thing you flavoured ice cream
22:22
with back in the day
22:25
it floats around doesn't it on the sea
22:26
for months or sometimes years um because
22:28
only about one percent of sperm whales
22:30
produce ambergris and there aren't there
22:32
aren't that many spam wheels
22:33
and so as it as it floats it hardens and
22:36
it changes and it takes on a much more
22:38
perfumey aroma than you would think it
22:41
would have apparently it's amazing and
22:42
it's worth a fortune if you find it on
22:44
the shore because it's what they use
22:46
although in some countries you're not
22:47
allowed to sell it and a lot of places
22:49
use fake hamburger now but um yeah if
22:51
you can find the buyer you can sell it
22:52
for a lot of money because it's used in
22:54
perfume right so yeah it used to be at
22:56
least well a lot of perfume companies so
22:58
there's actually a really good book on
22:59
this called floating gold
23:01
but
23:02
perfume companies tend to deny that they
23:05
use it but this guy found a lot of
23:07
people who sell ambergris to a lot of
23:09
companies like chanel etc um so yeah
23:11
they still use and apparently it does
23:12
smell delicious and incredible the worst
23:14
thing about it is to make it to put the
23:16
stuff into the food you would make
23:18
tincture of ambergris and to make that
23:20
you had to warm it very slowly and the
23:22
way that they would do that is either
23:23
put it in the sun
23:25
but if it wasn't sunny you would put it
23:27
in hot dunk
23:29
wow so if it wasn't fecal enough you had
23:32
to make it a little bit more fecal
23:33
before putting it in your ice cream
23:35
i have a story about on the the finding
23:37
it thing oh yeah finding it um on the
23:39
beach so uh in 2013 there was a dog
23:41
water on a beach in lancashire and he
23:43
found a three kilo lump and that is huge
23:46
i mean you get as small as 15 grams the
23:48
lumps of evergreen and reports said it
23:50
could be worth up to a hundred thousand
23:51
pounds and uh one french expert offered
23:54
him 50 000 euros if it checked out and
23:57
he said it smelled horrible i left it
24:00
came back home and looked it up on the
24:01
internet when i saw how much it could be
24:03
worth i went back and grabbed it
24:05
and then there was another story in the
24:06
same newspaper two months later which
24:08
revealed it wasn't ambergris yeah
24:11
and he said if i had my time again i
24:13
would kick the rock to one side and walk
24:15
away
24:16
i wish i'd never found it
24:18
i read the article as well and it said
24:20
it turned out to be just a smelly rock
24:25
um can we can we talk about poo very
24:28
quickly yes please okay cool um there's
24:31
a museum in tasmania called mona if you
24:33
don't know mona it's is very famous very
24:34
good museum it's incredible the best
24:36
gallery i've ever been in my life so
24:39
there's an art exhibition in the mona
24:40
museum uh that takes a poo at 2 pm every
24:44
day
24:45
sorry the exhibition itself takes
24:47
actually a very sick museum employee
24:50
they've erected a little plaque next to
24:52
him he's there going he's been trying to
24:54
pass it off as no it must have been the
24:55
museum
24:58
they have an installation which uh has
25:00
been designed by someone which
25:02
replicates the actions of a human
25:03
digestive system so it starts it gets
25:05
fed twice a day and at 2pm every day it
25:07
produces a poo and lets out the poo
25:10
great yeah they did it because they had
25:11
a really successful exhibit just before
25:13
it called the vomit room
25:16
sounds like an amazing museum they call
25:17
it the adults disneyland
25:22
i mean is it still a poo
25:25
again we've gone philosophical but i
25:27
think
25:28
that's worth sort of
25:31
all right
25:31
some stuff on ice cream maybe yeah uh in
25:34
uttar pradesh in 2007 you could buy
25:36
something called hitler ice cream
25:39
and this was basically ice cream with a
25:41
big picture of hitler on it it wasn't it
25:43
wasn't flavored right
25:45
yeah
25:46
and apparently the people there didn't
25:48
really realize the problem with doing
25:49
such a thing the guy who was selling it
25:51
when interviewed said one of my uncles
25:53
is a short-tempered and strict man so we
25:56
nicknamed him hitler and we called it
25:58
after him
26:00
it's a good excuse
26:02
but they have form actually in india in
26:04
2000 in the same year actually in mumbai
26:06
there was a whole furnishing firm who
26:09
did bed sheets called the nazi
26:11
collection which were full of swastikas
26:13
but when they were asked about it they
26:15
said that nazi stood for new arrival
26:18
zone for india
26:20
wow
26:22
very quick thinking actually
26:24
um did you guys know that ben jerry's
26:26
has an ice cream flavor graveyard
26:29
no really it's so cool so it's for every
26:33
ice cream flavor that has died over the
26:34
years which is actually quite a lot very
26:36
sad um and they it's a real graveyard
26:38
they've got tombstones in there and
26:41
they've got the name of the ice cream on
26:42
the tombstones and then they've all
26:43
they've written a little individual poem
26:45
for each ice cream that's died a
26:47
terrible death um and it's brilliant so
26:50
some examples are the ice cream uh
26:52
sweaty balls
26:53
[Laughter]
26:55
why on earth did they get rid of that
26:57
it's so impossible to know
26:59
it seems like what did it taste like
27:02
i don't think we need to answer that
27:04
no apparently that was based on a
27:06
saturday night live sketch from the 90s
27:07
where like bolden baldwin talks about
27:09
sweaty balls ice cream i don't know but
27:11
um yeah that that did not last very long
27:13
there's a ver monty python ice cream
27:16
which also died oh yeah and the poem
27:18
there is right then is it dead or isn't
27:21
it no it isn't yes it is no it isn't
27:24
rubbish you're a loony no i'm not
27:27
quite good
27:29
makes sense right isn't it yeah great
27:32
i didn't know that i i feel like i might
27:33
be the only person that didn't know this
27:35
but um i didn't realize that haagen-dazs
27:38
wasn't a real name in terms of i thought
27:40
haagen-dazs the ice cream was called
27:42
haagen-dazs because either there were
27:44
two people one called hagen one called
27:45
does yeah that sounds reasonable
27:47
so what it was was a polish guy lived in
27:49
new york and he wanted just a nice
27:51
danish sounding name and his daughter
27:53
said they would sit around the table and
27:54
he'd be like splunk and mars pigeon bars
27:57
bergen does haagen-dazs and they went
27:58
that sounds good that's why they called
28:00
it it was him around the dinner table
28:01
going haagen-dazs
28:03
and they named it there same for uh
28:05
rolex there are lots of very vexed
28:07
etymologies we don't really know where
28:08
it comes from there are a few theories
28:09
about it but they all contradict each
28:11
other they think they just made it up
28:12
because it sounded nice maybe yeah
28:14
that's one of the theories uncle ben's
28:15
rice is made don't tell me uncle ben
28:17
doesn't exist james i'm really sorry
28:19
come on it was made by a german guy
28:21
german company and they called it uncle
28:23
ben's to make it sound more american
28:26
wow
28:27
um mr whippy uh do you know where that
28:30
came from you know mr whippy or soft
28:31
scoop if you're american um ice cream
28:34
it's not a story that it came from
28:36
margaret thatcher yeah there's a theory
28:38
there's a story that margaret thatcher
28:39
was on the original team which developed
28:41
mr whippy ice cream but i think it's not
28:44
really true is it it's she was i think
28:45
she was a chemist for the company at the
28:47
time yeah she did work on ice cream but
28:49
not specifically on that but the time
28:51
that we came up with the idea of like
28:53
softer ice cream as a concept a
28:55
revolutionary idea as everyone agrees
28:57
this guy called tom carville who is an
28:58
american and he just sold ice cream and
29:01
his truck broke down in some really hot
29:04
american state he got a flat tire and so
29:06
he had to pull over and his ice cream
29:07
will start melting and he was like
29:08
bugger what do i do with this and
29:10
someone came up and said oh can i buy
29:11
that and he realized that he had a just
29:14
moving ice cream stool and people wanted
29:16
to buy melting ice cream and so he
29:18
stayed there he set up shop next to a
29:19
pottery shop i think um and that's how
29:23
where mr whippy came it was melting ice
29:24
cream accidentally another accidental
29:27
invention much like penicillin i didn't
29:29
mean to revolutionize ice cream when i
29:30
got up today
29:35
um okay i think we need to wrap up we've
29:37

[Music]
00:10
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:13
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:15
this week coming to you from the
00:16
edinburgh fringe festival my name is dan
00:19
schreiber i'm joined by three other qi
00:21
elves please welcome the stage it's andy
00:23
murray anna chazinski and james harkin
00:31
and once again we have gathered around
00:33
the microphones with our four favorite
00:34
facts from the last seven days and in a
00:36
particular order here we go starting
00:39
with you james harkin okay my fact this
00:41
week is that dog p makes street lights
00:45
collapse
00:48
you always hurt the ones you love
00:50
[Laughter]
00:52
how does it do that well it's urea that
00:54
you get in dog pee and it's corrosive
00:57
and um all over the world street lights
00:59
are falling down
01:01
due to dog pee there was a report that
01:02
came out in san francisco they were just
01:04
keeling over these lampposts the p was
01:06
really ruining them and this is a quote
01:08
from them we encourage people and dogs
01:10
alike to do their business in other
01:11
places like a proper restroom or on one
01:14
of our fire hydrants
01:16
the idea of the fire hydrants is they're
01:18
made out of cast iron so they won't
01:19
corrode okay but i didn't know that the
01:22
people pissing on lamp posts was a thing
01:26
i've only ever been doing
01:28
i don't know i've been clearly wasting
01:29
my time um
01:31
yeah because dogs like to urinate on
01:33
things in order to market as their
01:35
territory don't they whereas humans
01:36
don't really have that so we could just
01:38
we anyway that's a really good point
01:40
[Laughter]
01:42
um they did some tests on dogs as well
01:44
they tested um
01:46
how they how they do it in terms of
01:47
status so they took 48 labradors through
01:50
a course which was full of the urine of
01:52
other dogs you know that's because
01:53
that's what scientists do and um they
01:56
found out that animals with higher uh
01:58
tail bases and tail positions so if the
02:00
tail was higher up uh they did more
02:02
urine marking so they think that that is
02:04
the sign of status you do more
02:05
euromarking and you are higher status if
02:07
your tail is higher wow that's the
02:09
equivalent of a mansion
02:11
yeah yeah and there are some some very
02:13
submissive low status animals they just
02:15
fake it they lift a leg and then they
02:17
don't spray anything it's i'm doing it
02:18
but i'm not i'm shy i'm sorry or maybe
02:21
they just really like street lights and
02:22
they don't want to wreck them well that
02:24
would be a nice thought they're like
02:25
environmentally friendly dogs
02:28
but so have we other than just
02:30
encouraging people not to piss lampposts
02:32
to death are we
02:34
are we doing something about physically
02:36
yes making uh we are okay cool um
02:38
there's a dog urinal in the spanish town
02:41
of el vandrel
02:44
so they have a pole and the pole has a
02:46
grid underneath it and the idea is that
02:48
the dogs will pee on this pole so is it
02:50
law there in where was it uh el van der
02:53
elle is there law there that you have to
02:54
train your dog to recognize a dog urinal
02:57
and only urinate into that it isn't but
02:59
there is a law in piecenza in italy
03:01
which says that someone can be fined 500
03:04
euros for not cleaning up after your dog
03:06
urinates
03:07
wow
03:09
people have to walk around with a bottle
03:10
of water
03:12
wash it away awesome kitchen towel and
03:13
you just snap on it and let it absorb
03:17
wow good it's also happening to a museum
03:20
in dorset they're very worried about it
03:22
it's the bridgeport museum and it uh it
03:25
has a really extensive archive of the
03:27
town's 800 year old rope and netting
03:29
industry and this museum is now being
03:32
eroded by dog urine and they've had a
03:34
release statement
03:36
for the entire museum so they just
03:38
attack the wall right around yeah and
03:40
then
03:41
i mean this is a great way of taking
03:42
over somewhere eventually with war
03:44
just weighing on it could just we on it
03:46
enough and it will collapse
03:47
yeah it's a long-term strategy isn't it
03:49
it's it's not a blitzkrieg
03:51
[Laughter]
03:53
almost not worth having the place once
03:55
you've weed it today
03:57
but do you know why do you know do we
03:58
know why the dogs are so attracted to
04:00
this rope and netting museum or is it a
04:02
mystery they're very interested in yeah
04:04
early fishing industries
04:06
anyway anyway we're going off topic here
04:10
innovative types are using dog feces as
04:12
a solution to some problems so
04:16
what possible problem could you have i
04:18
sort of presented that quite cryptically
04:20
uh
04:21
so if you put your dog waste in a bin
04:23
then it goes to a site and then it gets
04:25
burnt up and it releases lots of bad
04:26
stuff into the atmosphere but in
04:28
massachusetts they've created a methane
04:30
digester so that you put your dog feces
04:33
into this methane digester
04:35
and it powers electricity at the moment
04:37
it only powers one lamp i think but
04:40
which has collapsed
04:45
but they aren't working on it wow okay
04:48
there is a feces-powered lamp in london
04:50
a street light a human feces powered
04:53
um yeah and it's uh right it's really
04:55
near the qa offices in common garden
04:56
it's by the savoy hotel how many people
04:58
notice me doing that embarrassing
05:02
um
05:03
and um they used to have them they used
05:05
they used to be streetlights which
05:06
burned off the uh the gas from the
05:08
sewers so the the gases would would come
05:11
up these pipes and into the just be
05:13
burned off at the top and there's only
05:14
one still working but it's called the or
05:16
what's it called the karting lane uh
05:19
patent sewer ventilating lamp that's
05:21
what it's called it still works wow um
05:24
so lamps in london speaking of which uh
05:27
there are 1500 gas lamps in london that
05:30
are still powered by gas and there's a
05:32
team of five people who work for british
05:34
gas apparently and they are employed to
05:36
go around london every night and wind up
05:39
these gas lamps so they don't actually
05:40
light the fire they wind up a clock
05:42
thing um which ignites the gas lamp on
05:45
the inside and they climb ladders and go
05:47
up there and do that every single night
05:48
you'll see them
05:49
never seen them you aren't looking up

and uh no spilling no mess no fuss uh
07:04

07:12
into your house using your sofa yeah
07:14
right yeah my sofa at home is full of
07:16
coyotes all the time
07:18
we've got a new sponsor by the way for
07:19
this week's podcast guys it's uh it's
07:22
p mart and people have feed gel but also
07:24
so you can also go down the list of all
07:26
the things that they sell and there's
07:28
lots of animals it's really it's really
07:29
cool and they bottle them in those kind
07:31
of you know when you go past those
07:32
health shops where they have up your
07:33
mass you know all those big huge bottles
07:36
like your protein shake yeah protein
07:38
shake yeah
07:41
let's say there's lots of different
07:42
animals my favorite one that i saw is
07:44
that you can buy uh one gallon of pure
07:46
black bear urine a gallon a gallon
07:49
that's what i thought how long must it
07:50
take a bear to produce a gallon of urine
07:53
and straight into the thing as well
07:56
must be a nightmare that could take down
07:58
a building
07:59
yes
08:00
yeah
08:02
um have you heard of white-footed
08:04
sportive lemurs
08:05
i haven't no neither had i until until i
08:08
found this out um so they're they're a
08:10
kind of lemur and they're really
08:11
anti-social in fact they actively avoid
08:13
each other and um they go to great
08:15
lengths to not see their mates or their
08:17
family members or anyone else um and
08:20
they only communicate using their
08:21
communal toilets
08:23
that's what they do
08:25
so they do they go they leave a scent
08:26
mark is it like writing little comments
08:28
on the toilet yeah basically yeah yeah
08:30
and they just go and they say oh good
08:32
good um you know mum was here or
08:33
whatever and then that's what i've seen
08:35
your mom was here
08:41
it's been nearly 80 episodes before we
08:42
had our first your mum joke on air
08:46
but we we stood out very well um yeah
08:50
other uses good uses for urine um which
08:53
is backfired in this case actually but a
08:55
family in bristol who tried to lure back
08:57
a lost dog by leaving a trail of their
08:59
own urine on the streets near their home
09:02
have been criticized by the local
09:04
council
09:06
criticized the such a nice word
09:10
what did they they insist it's the best
09:12
way they went on forums online and said
09:15
our dog is lost and the people on the
09:16
forum said well you should pee all over
09:18
your town
09:19
and it'll come back and find you
09:21
apparently it's quite a normal way of
09:22
doing it said the owner
09:25
because i would just put up a sign silly
09:27
me
09:28
there was a vet who was interviewed
09:30
about it who said he would be pleasantly
09:31
surprised if it works but um probably uh
09:34
it would be better if they could like
09:36
place jumpers and items of owner's
09:37
clothing because they really recognize
09:39
things that the owners smell of so he
09:40
said the only way the urine thing would
09:42
work was if the owner had an
09:43
incontinence problem
09:47
and we're gonna have to move on to the
09:48
next fact in a few minutes okay there
09:50
was a book called pharmacopia betiana
09:53
from 1706 by george bate and he had a
09:56
gargle for mouth ulcers which included a
09:59
white dog turd
10:01
wow
10:03
yeah how do you gargle a solid thing i
10:05
think you then dilute it in some water
10:08
oh i would say wine actually yeah yeah
10:11
why not take the edge of it
10:16
some other uses for dogs according to
10:18
old medical dictionaries um here's one
10:20
from robert james in 1743 he said
10:23
keeping a warm puppy next to one's upset
10:26
belly will give a kindly and cherishing
10:28
heat
10:29
it's nice isn't it yeah and not quite as
10:32
nice dog dung being hot and acrid might
10:35
treat toothache
10:38
might
10:40
might as well give it a try
10:43
um anything else so there was an
10:44
experiment in 1955 which i really like
10:47
where
10:48
the urine of schizophrenics was fed to
10:51
spiders to find out if they made webs
10:54
any differently
10:56
compared to when they drunk the urine it
10:58
really sounds like they're just getting
11:00
words out of a hat and going
11:01
schizophrenics spiders urine what are we
11:04
gonna do
11:06
inject okay
11:09
you can imagine that they thought i bet
11:10
they make really wacky webs with some
11:12
crazy they didn't there was no mark
11:14
difference in the webs of the spiders
11:15
who drunk the schizophrenics urine are
11:17
the only thing they could conclude from
11:18
it the scientists said was that urine
11:20
must taste extremely unpleasant after
11:22
taking just a sip the spiders exhibited
11:25
marked
11:26
apparance if i was a spider i would have
11:28
made a web which just said screw you in
11:31
the middle of it
11:35
okay let's move on to our next fact time
11:36
for pack number two and that is my fact
11:39
my fact this week is that after the
11:41
button was invented it took more than 1
11:44
000 years for someone to invent the
11:46
buttonhole
11:47
[Laughter]
11:49
what do we do with these what do we do
11:51
where do they go
11:52
who keeps making them
11:54
and they were doing things like well i
11:55
guess we'll just uh we'll just latch a
11:57
bit of string around it that might be
11:59
the way just no one thought to have
12:00
created the buttonhole and eventually
12:02
and i love that that must have been the
12:04
biggest innovation of its day
12:06
just a little slit in the bit of
12:07
clothing
12:08
it's kind of i mean because the loops do
12:10
work so i think the buttonhole came
12:12
about in uh the it was the mid 13th
12:14
century um in europe when the buttonhole
12:17
came to being but you can understand so
12:18
if you have a loop that works perfectly
12:20
well i don't really see why we'd bother
12:21
to invent the buttonhole to be
12:22
honest true and they have to be
12:24
reinforced as well because you can't
12:25
just cut a hole in your clothing because
12:27
then that'll that'll widen and
12:28
eventually it'll be no go for a button
12:30
so they do have to be reinforced guys
12:33
and that public service announcement was
12:35
brought to you
12:37
um yeah and they were used for
12:38
decoration as well weren't they because
12:39
they were really ornate and and whatever
12:41
um there was apparently really expensive
12:44
as well according to franco jocassee who
12:46
is the world's biggest button collector
12:49
wait wait wait does he have the world's
12:50
largest collection of buttons or is he
12:52
the world's biggest
12:53
button collector he has three buttons
12:55
but he's eight foot six
12:56
[Laughter]
13:00
he said that there was a time when the
13:01
buttons were so expensive you could pay
13:03
off a debt by plucking a precious button
13:06
from your suit and giving it to someone
13:08
wow that's great isn't it that's really
13:10
cool yeah there's a really really good
13:12
article about buttons on slate.com if
13:14
you want to go there afterwards for more
13:16
button stuff um go on the the quote is a
13:19
button packs an extraordinary amount of
13:20
information about a given time and place
13:22
its provenance onto a crowded little
13:24
canvas children learn to button and
13:26
unbutton early in life and they keep
13:28
doing it until they're dead
13:34
um
13:35
here's a great little thing uh anyone in
13:37
the audience here anyone listening at
13:40
home all of us on this stage most likely
13:42
the one thing that unites us is that we
13:44
all if you have a button on you are
13:46
wearing a button that comes from the
13:48
same town in china
13:50
there is button city in china uh it's
13:53
called chaoto and chalto produces 15
13:56
billion buttons a year
13:58
and it started because three i think was
14:00
three brothers they just found a few
14:02
buttons on the ground and they started
14:04
collecting buttons and then it turned
14:05
into an industry and it became this
14:07
massive thing
14:08
but now they make them rather than find
14:10
them yeah yeah yeah
14:11
that's the amazing thing they find 15
14:13
billion buses a year
14:15
and nobody knows where they come from
14:17
yeah but it's not it's not every single
14:19
button in the world but i think it's
14:20
something like three out of five people
14:21
if they're wearing buttons wear buttons
14:23
from button city and button city
14:25
apparently is amazing and it's situated
14:26
very near toothbrush city which produces
14:30
a lot of the toothbrushes next to
14:31
buttonhole city
14:32
[Laughter]
14:35
something about something else about
14:36
buttons lots of birmingham is built on
14:38
buttons so
14:41
stay with me um
14:43
so uh shell buttons used to be extremely
14:45
popular buttons made from uh from mother
14:46
of pearl rochelle and um in the 18th
14:48
century the world's busted the button
14:50
town of the 18th century was uh
14:52
birmingham they made a huge amount of
14:54
the world's shell buttons and the best
14:56
ones apparently required 80 different
14:58
processes in order to just make a button
15:01
and there was so much waste shell which
15:03
they produced that they dug enormous
15:04
pits to bury it all and
15:07
lots of buildings in birmingham today
15:08
especially in the jewellery quarter have
15:10
their foundations on mother of pearl so
15:12
they're all on on sort of buttons and
15:13
buttons how cool is that i did not know
15:15
that that's really interesting did you
15:17
know that cloth buttons were illegal in
15:19
17th century friends
15:21
no cloth buttons cloth buttons were
15:23
illegal in 17th century france yeah they
15:25
sound totally useless i would ban them
15:28
like buttons made of cloth that wasn't
15:30
the reason they banned them basically it
15:31
was due to big button oh yeah it was the
15:35
handicraft industry who said that
15:37
basically by making these cloth buttons
15:38
it was going to make our other buttons
15:40
made out of pearl or whatever they were
15:42
going to make them obsolete and it was
15:44
so bad that people that officials would
15:46
go to houses and search them looking for
15:48
buttons and you could be arrested for
15:51
enjoying a button in the privacy of your
15:52
own home according to this article i
15:55
read wow when we say enjoying a button i
15:58
mean
15:59
if you're enjoying your button i think
16:00
you might have to be arrested
16:04
there was a button alternative since we
16:06
didn't really figure out the button
16:07
buttonhole thing in uh ancient greece in
16:10
ancient rome was the fibula which was a
16:12
foreign of the safety pin it essentially
16:14
worked exactly like a safety pin and
16:16
they had these in ancient greece and
16:17
rome and that's an example of one of
16:18
these things which i love which is an
16:20
invention that vanished for about two
16:21
thousand years um and the safety pin
16:23
resurfaced in so they had safety pins in
16:27
ancient greece yeah yeah yeah that's
16:29
what they did up there tunics the guy
16:31
who invented the modern um safety pin
16:33
was called walter hunt i think and he
16:35
sold his patent for four hundred dollars
16:37
because he had um he had like a gambling
16:39
debt or something so he sold his patent
16:41
so that he could pay off his debt
16:42
because he thought i say to pin it's
16:43
nothing it's not really important
16:46
that is how i feel about safety pins to
16:48
be honest but actually as a commercial
16:50
also he invented i think like um a
16:53
sewing machine like similar to elias
16:55
howe invented the actual sewing machine
16:57
but he did a precursor to it and he
16:58
didn't patent that because he thought it
17:00
would put a lot of seamstresses out of
17:02
work
17:03
oh no
17:05
it did the opposite of that
17:08
created a massive global industry
17:10
oh my friend
17:13
one thing that button so when the
17:15
buttonhole did come into being one thing
17:17
that they were used for in fashion
17:18
between the 13th and 15th centuries was
17:20
detachable sleeves so that was a really
17:23
fashionable thing is that you would have
17:26
you know you could swap between outfits
17:27
they were like you're wearing a
17:28
different outfit every time you had lots
17:30
you had a sleeve drawer which was just
17:31
leaves
17:32
and you probably they did i don't know
17:34
they had lots of different sleeves
17:36
where else are you going to keep the
17:37
sleeves that's really cool that is
17:39
really cool that's amazing
17:41
yeah
17:42
but then one day you might accidentally
17:43
leave the house with odd sleeves on oh
17:46
disaster yeah and then some people say
17:48
he's just doing it on purpose to be
17:50
pretentious
17:51
um so basically before the buttonhole
17:54
was invented buttons did become very
17:56
popular everyone was wearing them uh
17:57
ornamentally and one of the hangovers of
18:00
that time which we rarely think about i
18:02
was reading this in bill bryson's book
18:04
at home if you think about a suit coat
18:06
and the buttons by the cuff they they're
18:08
not practical buttons they're just
18:10
ornamental three ornamental on each side
18:13
yeah that is weird yeah so that's a
18:14
hangover from back in the day
18:16
pre-buttonhole well so another hangover
18:18
which we are wearing every day every
18:21
female in the audience symbols of sexism
18:22
of the olden days is the fact that
18:24
buttons on women's clothes are on the
18:26
opposite side to buttons on men's
18:27
clothes so there are loads of theories
18:29
about why that is the main theory i've
18:30
heard is that women were dressed by
18:32
maids yeah and so the maids who were
18:34
mostly right-handed would kind of be it
18:36
would be easier for them because it was
18:37
on the left-hand side whereas men dress
18:39
themselves i thought it was because all
18:40
women are left-handed
18:44
i've heard so yeah i think that is the
18:46
main theory although to like
18:48
talk about my one theory is the main
18:50
theory miners no no the all that
18:51
foundation
18:52
yeah it's true um
18:54
but but another theory is that so men
18:57
have them on the right-hand side uh
18:59
because they would have their weapons in
19:01
their right hand when they were carrying
19:02
their weapons so
19:04
when you're trying to get undressed and
19:06
kill someone at the same time exactly
19:08
it's much easier one-handed
19:11
i will deal to the death but
19:17
um jillian lincoln's can't stand to be
19:20
in the same room as friends and family
19:22
who word buttons who
19:24
she's called jillian lincoln's and she
19:26
has something called kumpoon a phobia
19:29
which is the fear of buttons
19:32
she's had it since she was age seven and
19:34
her boyfriend nate dorrington can only
19:36
wear clothes with zips
19:38
wow but her name is lincoln's which is
19:40
nicely ironic
19:42
considering the function of a button do
19:44
you know who else had that yeah yeah we
19:46
must have read the same thing yeah let's
19:47
say it together okay ready one two three
19:50
steve jobs yeah yeah steve jobs was
19:53
scared of buttons and and partially
19:55
there's a theory that that's why it led
19:57
to the buttonless iphone because he was
19:59
so
20:02
yeah so steve jobs he actually was he
20:03
had a fear of buttons yeah he did say
20:06
that in yeah 2007 i think another person
20:08
who had a fear of buttons was uh
20:10
napoleon's i think great granddaughter
20:13
marie bonaparte oh really really yep
20:16
wow that's true is she the one who had a
20:18
clitoris moved you moved
20:21
i don't want to become
20:23
just to a holiday house
20:28
very very quickly she was she did some
20:30
studies where she looked at the distance
20:32
between the clitoris and the vagina of
20:34
lots of women and found out that those
20:36
where it was closer had more orgasms and
20:38
she wanted to have more orgasms so moved
20:40
her clitoris surgically closer to her
20:42
movement she had to move twice and it
20:43
didn't work it's very sad it's extremely
20:45
sad yeah yeah how mighty families have
20:48
fallen
20:50
uh napoleon's army actually had a
20:52
situation with buttons which was that
20:54
their buttons were made out of tin and
20:57
i've read i don't know if this is
20:58
actually a solid theory but apparently
20:59
when they were marching into russia it
21:00
was so cold that the tin crumbled and so
21:03
their uniforms opened wide up and
21:05
suddenly they were exposed to the cold
21:06
and that's what led to a lot of deaths
21:08
so so as they were invading it was kind
21:10
of like watching the full monty coming
21:14
um i've read that theory i'm i've read
21:17
different things about it though i've
21:18
heard people contradicting it and people
21:19
saying yes no it's definitely it so yeah
21:21
i'm not sure i'm gonna have to move this
21:22
on worries anyone else got something um
21:25
just that the
21:26
uh button replacement is the zip in the
21:29
modern era
21:30
and you've got to be aware of the zip
21:31
because it is by far and away the most
21:34
common cause of penis injury
21:38
so between 2002 and 2010 there were
21:41
almost 18 000 people in the u.s alone
21:43
who were hospitalized because of penile
21:46
injury imagine if they all arrived on
21:47
the same day
21:49
imagine the coincidence
21:51
it was after a big charity pull your
21:53
flies up
21:55
and also possibly not interestingly for
21:57
men but it is almost only ever the penis
22:00
and not the testicles so good news of
22:01
the testicles very hard to get them
22:02
caught in the zip but
22:04
it's more like it's not like no news for
22:06
the testicles of very very bad news for
22:08
the penis
22:09
when they invented the zip it was
22:11
marketed as a better way to do up your
22:12
trousers as you were less likely to
22:14
forget to do up a zipper as you were to
22:16
forget to do up buttons
22:19
but also less likely to chop your [ __ ]
22:21
off
22:26
okay
22:27
time for fact number three and that is
22:30
andy murray oh good um okay my fact is
22:33
that as a baby saint nicholas refused to
22:36
drink his mother's breast milk on fast
22:38
days
22:41
so on wednesdays and fridays
22:44
say nicholas would refuse to suckle um
22:47
because he was so holy so young
22:49
except in the evening when it was
22:50
allowed because the day was over so
22:52
there are other saints where this
22:54
happened so um there's a biography of
22:56
the fifth century saint candid which
22:57
says that as a baby he completely
22:59
refused to suckle at his mother's right
23:01
breast but if she had eaten a delicious
23:03
meal he also refused to suckle at her
23:05
left breast
23:06
wow what
23:08
so he wasn't allowed to enjoy it too
23:10
much so if she didn't have a delicious
23:11
meal then breast milk is more exactly it
23:13
was like an abstinence thing babies are
23:15
so much more advanced than we give them
23:17
credit for absolutely do you know who
23:19
the patron saints are breastfeeding is
23:21
it's not to nicholas no it's saint giles
23:23
and before he became a saint he withdrew
23:25
deep into the forest near neem where he
23:28
lived on his own uh and his sole
23:30
companion was a deer who sustained him
23:32
with her milk
23:34
oh a weird person to nominate a patron
23:36
saint of breastfeeding because it is not
23:37
a conventional way to breastfeed yeah
23:41
but he is also the patron saint of
23:42
edinburgh saint giles and the patron
23:45
saint of people who are afraid of the
23:46
dark
23:47
wow
23:48
that's very good knowledge and the
23:50
patriot saint of uh glasgow is saint
23:52
mungo and st mungo died of shock after
23:55
getting into a very hot bath
24:01
yeah guys i think i can handle above
24:04
it is really hot some mungo please why
24:07
are you calling me saint
24:10
um so one what just one more saint uh
24:12
saint gwen the white uh was the mother
24:15
of two young sons and then she gave
24:16
birth to her third son and in order to
24:19
help her nursing her third infant god
24:21
miraculously gave her a third breast
24:24
and she became known as gwen of the
24:26
three paps
24:32
um
24:33
nicholas um about
24:35
this fact is uh so one of his miracles
24:37
which is particularly impressive i think
24:39
so there was someone who was selling
24:41
pickled ham
24:42
in a street market and so nicholas
24:44
realized that he was not selling pickled
24:46
ham as the sign suggested he was selling
24:48
the pickled chopped up bodies of three
24:50
small children and he pieced them
24:52
together but it's not it's not sad
24:54
because he pieced them together and he
24:55
brought the children back to life again
24:57
so wow that is impressive the gherkin
25:00
triplets
25:02
my god yeah we should clarify that like
25:04
stories about what saints do we're not
25:05
necessarily presenting is i know i don't
25:07
know what to write down as interesting
25:09
because it sounds like wherever he
25:10
walked he would be in a situation and he
25:12
would pray it away so be like oh we're
25:14
at the ocean and we're in the ocean and
25:16
sailors are vomiting and there's a
25:18
whirlpool i'll just do a quick prayer
25:19
what is true about him actually is that
25:20
he slapped somebody once um he slapped a
25:23
fellow bishop
25:25
yes because it's the great aryan
25:28
controversy which is the controversy
25:29
about whether jesus is actually fully
25:32
divine or whether he's sort of half
25:33
divine because he was also a human and
25:35
basically it's a nicolas strongly
25:37
believe that jesus is is god um and
25:39
someone suggested that jesus wasn't
25:42
quite either divine or human and he got
25:44
up it was at some cyanide um in the year
25:46
325 a.d and seniors got up crossed the
25:49
room and gave him a big slap around the
25:51
face wow
25:52
and that is where we get the phrase
25:53
bashing the bishop
25:58
[Applause]
26:01
so yeah i'm not sure like you're saying
26:03
that saints didn't do these things is
26:05
that sacrilegious in any way for
26:07
instance
26:08
there are a few saints who um were
26:10
decapitated and carried their own heads
26:12
so you're saying that that didn't happen
26:14
as well i definitely am not saying that
26:16
saint gene of legera who carried his own
26:19
severed head and threw it into the roan
26:22
or
26:22
paul of tarsus um who had his head
26:25
chopped off and then said jesus christ
26:28
50 times after it had been chopped up
26:31
you might not have said it in that way
26:33
but 50 times
26:35
50 times as a mate well the first time
26:36
it would be amazing and then the tenth
26:37
time it would be yeah okay
26:41
okay can you just shut up
26:43
there's actually a real problem with uh
26:45
saints who are beheaded and then carry
26:47
their heads around where to put the halo
26:49
so i think there's some controversy as
26:51
to whether you put it over their severed
26:53
neck when you're
26:55
painting them or whether you put it
26:56
above the head here and there's mixed
26:58
views and we'll see both you'll see
27:00
you'll see that yeah yeah okay so
27:02
everyone can have their own view on that
27:05
um can i bring it back to breast milk
27:07
very quickly yeah yeah okay is this
27:09
another website so
27:13
so i found a great place to buy breast
27:14
milk online
27:16
so onlythebreast.com
27:18
and
27:19
it's genuinely
27:20
simply the best i know we should have
27:21
been right
27:23
what
27:24
think out there guys
27:27
and this is uh this is a genuine place
27:29
where people trade breast milk online
27:31
and you have all sorts of categories
27:33
subcategories of types of breast milk
27:35
that you can buy and have shipped to
27:36
your house you can have zero to two
27:38
months uh there was fresh breast milk on
27:40
demand uh special diet brackets vegan
27:43
etc and then the final one is willing to
27:46
sell to men
27:48
yeah pretty disgusting right i have
27:50
heard i don't know if this is true that
27:51
bodybuilders like to have breast milk
27:53
because their theory and apparently this
27:56
is complete rubbish but their theory is
27:58
a baby goes from really small to quite
28:01
big in a really small amount of time
28:03
so surely the same will happen to my
28:05
muscles
28:08
do you want to combining marrying the
28:10
two together saints and breast milk oh
28:12
yeah uh have you heard of the miracle of
28:13
the lactation of saint bernard um
28:16
this is where saint bernard was uh
28:18
praying and the virgin mary virgin mary
28:21
uh while he was praying sprinkled some
28:22
milk uh on his lips as in her own breast
28:25
milk um and there are other depictions
28:27
of it which are quite impressive so i'm
28:29
quoting directly from the the wikipedia
28:31
article about the lactation of saint
28:32
bernard in art he usually kneels before
28:34
a madonna lactane's breastfeeding
28:36
madonna and as jesus takes a break from
28:38
feeding the virgin squeezes her breast
28:40
and he is hit with a squirt of milk
28:42
often shown traveling an impressive
28:43
distance
28:45
it's true it is across a room that uh
28:47
it's depicted it's medieval artworks
28:49
that you get this in yeah yeah well men
28:52
can lactate can't they because you can i
28:54
think we've discussed this before if you
28:55
massage your nipples enough as a man
28:58
then you can bring it on did you ever do
29:00
that experiment andy oh was it dan who
29:02
was going to do it i did have a go yes
29:06
and was it successful not a dribble
29:08
nothing
29:10
furious it's been weeks
29:13
looks so weird on the train
29:15
[Laughter]
29:17
research just doing some research
29:19
[Laughter]
29:20
yeah no i no no not a drop yet
29:23
keep trying oh yeah i'm not giving up
29:26
do you want to hear about saint philip
29:28
neary um who's known as the humorous
29:30
saint
29:32
is this like oh i've got a really funny
29:34
mate yeah yeah you got to meet him funny
29:36
mike it really is like that it's so sad
29:39
um his basically all he did that was
29:41
funny is he once shaved off half his
29:43
beard as a way of poking fun at himself
29:47
and he also liked to wear a cushion on
29:49
his head
29:52
and he's doing his debut solo hour
29:55
at sea venues um
29:58
so he was sainted for that is that
30:00
he must have done some other stuff i
30:02
don't know
30:03
it was very much easier back then wasn't
30:04
it
30:06
we're gonna have to move on very soon
30:07
can i just tell you very quickly about
30:09
the infancy gospels of jesus because as
30:11
a another young uh more than a saint he
30:13
was a jesus wasn't he um so
30:19
but
30:20
um there are lots of uh there are some
30:22
second century sources which describe
30:23
what jesus did as a very very small boy
30:25
when he was about five years old and
30:27
they're really amazing because uh
30:29
they're very different to the gospels um
30:31
so when he was five years old he
30:33
gathered together separate rivers uh
30:34
which had all been desperate pools of
30:36
water and he gathered him into a single
30:37
pond and he cleaned it up and then a boy
30:40
ruined them by um sort of sweeping them
30:42
apart with a broom so jesus made
30:44
immediately just made the boy withered
30:46
and then then there was another time
30:48
when a boy bumped into him and he jesus
30:50
immediately kills him
30:53
the parents of the boy who jesus has
30:55
killed go to joseph saying um your sons
30:57
killed our son
30:59
so jesus simply struck blind all of his
31:01
accusers
31:04
and then joseph sort of boxes his ear
31:06
and tells him off
31:08
wow
31:09
yeah infantry gospels look them up
31:11
they're really good
31:13
um okay it's time for our final fact and
31:16
that is jazinski
31:18
uh yeah my fact is that uh when ronald
31:20
reagan left office he left a note on the
31:23
white house lawn for the squirrels
31:25
warning them to beware of george bush's
31:27
dogs
31:30
yeah it's quite sweet isn't it yeah but
31:32
also he's assuming that squirrels can
31:34
read is he yeah i mean he wasn't the
31:36
sharpest door in the shed but uh he was
31:38
very fond of the squirrels and sadly
31:40
george bush recounted later that uh it
31:43
did absolutely no good because their dog
31:45
really beat the heck out of those
31:46
squirrels whenever he could she could oh
31:48
wow yeah you should have left also a
31:49
sign for the dog saying don't get the
31:51
squirrels why didn't they do that
31:53
yeah there's um they currently have and
31:56
this is like hot off the press uh the
31:59
white house is having squirrel issues at
32:00
the moment are they with michelle
32:02
obama's garden oh well they because they
32:04
always dig up my friend spent an entire
32:06
weekend planting lots of bulbs in her
32:08
garden and came back and like a hundred
32:10
bulbs and dug up so it's probably that
32:12
there's a silly little legal issue that
32:15
the gardeners are not allowed to touch
32:17
the bit of garden that she's created but
32:18
she's away so much that she's actually
32:20
not able to maintain it they can't mow
32:21
it they can't weed it they can't do
32:23
anything to it but water it and it's
32:25
just so they're allowed to go near the
32:26
first lady's garden
32:29
[Music]
32:30
uh yeah i cannot really so that she's
32:33
saying to them please do go near it and
32:35
they're like we want to but there's this
32:37
clause somewhere in our legislation that
32:39
says we're not allowed to touch your bit
32:41
of garden i genuinely didn't read the
32:42
article i have no idea why
32:45
but they are so squirrels are prolific
32:47
on the white house lawn and reagan was
32:48
really fond of them and it's kind of
32:50
touching so every time he went to camp
32:52
david he'd bring lots of acorns back
32:53
from there to feed the squirrels uh i
32:55
was reading at trans
32:56
what yeah he loved to feed the squirrels
32:59
um i was reading a transcript from an
33:01
interview
33:02
that he was having i think it was with
33:04
the new york times where basically he uh
33:07
there was a in the transcript there's a
33:09
pause at one point and he says oh sorry
33:11
if i look out the window and look
33:12
distracted i'm just seeing if the
33:13
squirrels are still eating the acorns
33:15
that i brought them this morning oh my
33:16
god it's a good thing there wasn't
33:17
anything going on at the time like the
33:19
cold war
33:19
[Laughter]
33:22
wow
33:23
come on it's cute um
33:25
i read it i read a thing about reagan
33:27
because reagan was obviously he was an
33:29
actor in b movies um he was started in
33:31
films with amazing titles um accidents
33:33
will happen girls on probation
33:36
the angels wash their faces uh brother
33:38
rat and a baby
33:40
but his um
33:41
um but his imdb page begins with this
33:44
quotation ronald reagan is arguably the
33:46
most successful actor in history
33:48
and they based that on the fact that he
33:50
became president of america
33:52
but it's not that's not a success as an
33:54
actor
33:56
i really like the
33:57
pedantic nature of that comment because
33:59
he is the most successful person who has
34:01
also been an actor you can't fault it
34:03
that's true that is true that's true
34:05
did you guys know that uh it is because
34:07
of him that we have blue jelly beans no
34:10
no
34:12
i don't even know we have blue jelly
34:13
beans i feel the skepticism emanating i
34:16
know the whole room goes it's not true
34:18
is it um it's true uh he uh it was for
34:22
his inauguration so basically he was a
34:24
massive jelly bean lover the reason he
34:26
was a massive jelly bean lover uh is
34:27
because he had a huge pipe smoking habit
34:30
and he hated it and he didn't want to
34:31
smoke anymore the only thing that would
34:33
stop him from uh having any nicotine
34:36
would be to have a jar of jelly beans
34:39
and often if you look at photos of
34:40
ronald reagan in all the meetings that
34:42
he's in there's a big jar of jelly beans
34:44
next to him wow and so he loved licorice
34:46
that was his favorite uh type of jelly
34:48
bean but for the inauguration because
34:50
jelly bean caught on to it they thought
34:51
we're gonna create one we don't have a
34:52
blue one for the red white and blue and
34:54
so they created it and so yeah ronald
34:56
reagan wow that is really interesting
35:00
thank you one thing he didn't like was
35:01
brussels sprouts uh he once did a trip
35:04
to england and he was fed so many
35:06
brussels sprouts during his trip that he
35:08
swore off them for the rest of his life
35:11
but they told him they were green jelly
35:12
beans which they created in his honor
35:14
yeah you know when he was an actor as i
35:17
was reading he actually wrote two um
35:19
autobiographies but his later one after
35:21
he was president he talked about when he
35:22
was an actor and the fact that there was
35:25
a lot of talk backstage about how small
35:27
his head was um and so he was there with
35:29
this casting director who was saying
35:31
what are we going to do about ronald's
35:32
head you could stand the actors slightly
35:35
further away from him and then it would
35:37
match the size of their heads from back
35:38
there but then his body looks weird
35:41
really large so it was neither to be a
35:43
successful actor he had to have very
35:44
wide collars to minimize his uh shoulder
35:47
width and have collars that were sort of
35:48
open a little bit lower so it looked
35:50
like his head was a bit bigger i guess
35:51
to you know increase the amount of skin
35:53
exposure in the head area so
35:57
that's amazing yeah poor guy imagine he
36:00
is the most successful actor of all time
36:03
that is true who can forget watching
36:05
brother rat and a baby every christmas
36:07
[Laughter]
36:10
you know he wrote his first
36:11
autobiography 16 years before he became
36:14
president wow in 1965 saying and it was
36:16
called where's the rest of me
36:19
does he talk about his head
36:23
what's his next autobiography called
36:24
here it is
36:27
very forward-thinking
36:32
he was once threatened by a guy who was
36:34
going to attack him and the way he was
36:36
known as the catman and the reason was
36:38
because he would send threatening
36:40
letters
36:41
uh but also pictures of cats
36:44
to the president yeah that is the
36:46
precursor to the internet i think
36:48
lots of purposeless abuse and then
36:50
pictures of cats
36:52
and the other thing that reagan started
36:54
was the idea that whenever a president
36:56
leaves he always leaves a note for the
36:58
next president uh and he uh wrote a note
37:01
saying don't let the turkeys get you
37:03
down to george bush sorry
37:05
what is the relevance of the turkeys the
37:07
turkeys is in the like the the press the
37:09
other countries the the don't let the
37:11
turkeys get you down it's not about
37:12
turkey is it
37:15
because that's a very specifically
37:16
racist thing to say
37:18
when you're taking over the most
37:19
powerful nation now this so this was
37:20
discovered by brad meltzer um not the
37:23
not the uh the fact that that note was
37:25
left um for bush but that bush then said
37:28
i left a note for clinton and brad
37:31
meltzer he's a crime writer political
37:32
thrillers um he then said this is
37:35
apparently he thinks this is true
37:37
wherever ronald reagan went he had a
37:38
briefcase with him and always carried a
37:40
handheld gun on him okay
37:43
what's the opposite of a handheld gun
37:55
a foot-propelled bow and arrow
37:58
he was i i just always think this is
38:00
amazing his chief of staff
38:03
do people know what his chief of staff
38:04
was called
38:06
ronald reagan's yeah no he was called
38:08
donald reagan
38:13
i don't understand why this isn't the
38:14
most well known fact on the basis of the
38:16
earth and the chief of staff who
38:18
preceded him was called baker so the
38:19
chiefs have proceeded proceeded donald
38:21
reagan was called howard baker and the
38:22
guy who came after him was called james
38:24
baker so people say ronald reagan was a
38:26
bit confused in the 80s but i definitely
38:28
see where he's coming from
38:32
um annoyingly we've uh we're running out
38:34
of time in fact we're on the time runout
38:36
moment so any last facts um very quick
38:38
what about squirrels
38:39
um it used to be illegal not to report a
38:42
grey squirrel in your garden really
38:45
i think that grey swirls were brought to
38:46
the uk by benjamin franklin uh he
38:49
brought squirrels over to the uk uh
38:51
according to news for
38:54
squirrels.com the blog
38:56
how many hits does it get
38:58
it's had a lot this week for me
39:01
uh male cape ground squirrels have very
39:04
big genitalia uh the penises can be 40
39:07
the length of their body and they can
39:09
and do autofollate
39:12
yeah and according to researcher jane
39:14
waterman they do it to clean their
39:16
genitals
39:17

00:13
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:16

00:17

00:19

00:22
qi elves please welcome to the stage is
00:24
andy murray anna chazinski and james
00:26
harkin
00:33
and once again we have gathered around
00:35
the microphones with our four favorite
00:37
facts from the last seven days and in no
00:39
particular order here we go starting
00:41
with you james harkin okay my fact this
00:44
week is that las vegas hosts an awards
00:47
ceremony for people who make awards
00:53
what do they what do they get they get a
00:55
gold obelisk
00:59
it's the awards and personalization
01:00
association and they celebrate things
01:02
like best trophy that gets an award um
01:06
best plaque that gets one that's black
01:08
best plaque and uh best sand blasting
01:11
that's one
01:12
um what is that i didn't lock it up
01:17
um yeah the us and canada industry for
01:20
awards is three billion dollars a year
01:22
that's how much people spend on awards
01:24
and that i worked it out is enough to
01:26
give every person in the country a three
01:29
to five inch resin trophy in the sport
01:31
of their choice
01:32
[Laughter]
01:37
that seems a much better way of doing it
01:38
just do away with all the games and
01:40
sports just give everyone a trophy yeah
01:42
be great that's amazing that's because
01:44
well they are hugely money don't they
01:46
the oscars we've talked about this
01:47
before the oscars the party bag that you
01:49
get if you're attending the oscars is
01:51
extraordinary it's worth something like
01:52
120 grand per bag last year's or the
01:54
year befores came with uh every female
01:57
who'd attended uh got in their party bag
01:59
uh
02:00
genital stimulator i think no it was it
02:03
was surgery that can be performed on you
02:05
in order that you have better orgasms
02:07
and every woman who attended the oscar's
02:09
got a little voucher for one of these
02:11
surgeries
02:14
so yeah it's good it's better than the
02:15
party bags of youth
02:19
yeah it's not a balloon and a bit of
02:20
cake wrapped in tissue isn't it
02:23
mind you i think you'd be in trouble at
02:24
a child birthday party
02:29
um
02:30
i i started looking up some other awards
02:32
ceremonies that the uk has based on this
02:33
fact and
02:35
you might like to know that there is a
02:36
british kebab awards
02:38
where categories include best newcomer
02:41
kebab restaurant
02:43
and outstanding contribution to the
02:45
kebab industry
02:45
[Laughter]
02:47
which this year i'm sure we all know was
02:49
one by edmonton meat
02:54
how are the acceptance speeches for that
02:56
you just have to slowly turn around as
02:57
you make a speech
03:02
another award uh ceremony that they have
03:04
which i think the prize for this is
03:06
enormous given the nature of it so the
03:09
um
03:10
smelly foot contest uh the reiki
03:12
competition for which is called the
03:14
sneaker contest the sneaker contest and
03:16
you the winner every year gets two
03:18
thousand five hundred dollars as well as
03:20
two nights day in new york and a trip to
03:22
a broadway show which just for proving
03:24
that you're having smelly feet yeah
03:26
how's it judged uh it it's the panel of
03:29
judges i can tell you how it's judged
03:31
because i actually coincidentally
03:32
googled this as well
03:35
they they check the condition of your
03:37
heel of your shoe um the sole the tongue
03:40
the shoelaces the odour of the shoe
03:43
which is um tested by a group of people
03:44
one of whom is nasa's sniffer no yeah
03:48
the guy who smells everything before it
03:50
goes up in space oh this guy's yeah this
03:52
guy's incredible he literally he has the
03:53
most sensitive nostrils on our planet
03:55
nothing goes into space unless he goes
03:57
under his nose and he goes yep that's
03:59
that's the only way it goes into space
04:01
if he doesn't like the smell it does not
04:03
go to space this is the most powerful
04:05
set of nostrils on our planet
04:07
and he gets test four times every year
04:09
where they put beakers of different
04:10
smells under his nose some contain no
04:13
smells some contain a tiny trays and if
04:15
he fails he loses his job he has never
04:18
failed he's got the best nostrils on the
04:20
planet even if he did fail he's got a
04:21
lucrative uh sneaker judging career to
04:23
fall back on
04:24
and so the other thing that these guys
04:25
do in the competition is that the
04:28
entrant has to give a verbal response to
04:30
the question why he stroke she feels
04:32
that he strokes she has rotten sneakers
04:35
and how they got that way
04:37
and last year's winner kan young hiss
04:40
answered the question with i bike and
04:42
high coffin
04:43
i've worn them through mud and also
04:45
through chicken pigeon goose and dove
04:48
poop
04:49
and i also don't wear socks
04:53
so that was her answer oh the sock bit
04:55
got you that was the
04:58
yeah again you get into the the hall of
05:00
fumes don't you the odoritas hall of
05:02
fumes if you win it it's like clever
05:04
contest no that's actually true that
05:06
wasn't me making a really bad show
05:09
there you go uh supposedly the original
05:11
trophy uh was an ancient greek word and
05:14
it comes trophene is what it was
05:15
originally and it was when you hung your
05:18
dead enemies armor on a tree after a
05:21
battle so everyone could see that you
05:22
had won
05:23
yeah amazing
05:24
have you guys heard of the golden color
05:26
awards no which are a really big deal
05:29
apparently every year there's an award
05:31
ceremony that follows the oscars for the
05:33
best dogs in films really um yeah yeah
05:36
and you get the same category so you get
05:37
a best dog in a theatrical film um which
05:40
i think the dog in the dog and the
05:41
artist won it in the year i was reading
05:44
about r.i.p just passed away oh yeah
05:47
no
05:47
sorry it's not breaking news it happened
05:49
ages ago just no one knows because no
05:50
one cares it's not like uh
05:53
well after his death he might have taken
05:55
part in the uk's good funeral awards
05:59
which is a real thing
06:02
categories include cemetery of the year
06:05
uh embalmer of the year
06:08
uh major contribution to the
06:10
understanding of death whoa
06:12
wow
06:14
and uh the final cat my favorite is
06:16
gravedigger of the year
06:20
that's real
06:21
what is it to dig a good grave yeah what
06:23
are the qualifications is it like
06:24
quantity or quality strength or speed or
06:27
um yeah depth
06:29
depth i mean because there's a famous
06:31
term that sort of gives it a sort of
06:32
bottom ceiling as it were
06:34
six deep i don't like the phrase bottom
06:36
ceiling at all
06:37
[Laughter]
06:40
[Music]
06:42
[Laughter]
06:44
okay we always lose that at some stage
06:46
but it's a bit early today not very
06:48
early tonight yeah
06:49
so speaking of bottoms uh
06:53
something you could do with your bottom
06:55
yeah relating to awards ceremonies is be
06:57
a seat filler at the oscars right and i
06:58
think we should try and do that but um
07:01
so i think you can only get the job if
07:02
you work for pwc which sponsors the
07:04
oscars or if you know someone involved
07:06
but it's because if the camera pans out
07:08
to the audience and like um you know
07:10
live tyler or whoever's famous these
07:11
days goes to the toilet then it looks
07:13
like there's an empty seat and so you've
07:14
got to wait there in the wings and as
07:16
soon as a famous person stands up then
07:17
you've got to run into their seat sit
07:18
next to george clooney for a bit but
07:19
you're under strict instructions not to
07:21
interact with any of the actual invitees
07:23
this isn't funny but i had that at the
07:25
national television awards we went on
07:27
stage and then people came in our seat
07:29
and then afterwards we had to
07:35
i used to do that job weirdly
07:38
that's how i met everyone at qi i was
07:44
you told because i would have thought if
07:45
i'd gone and got an oscar and gone back
07:47
and someone had stolen my seat i'd just
07:48
be like what the [ __ ] are you doing in
07:50
my seat
07:52
i was reading an article about the
07:53
oscars and they make about uh i think
07:55
it's about 50 every year yeah yeah and
07:57
you're not allowed to sell them either
07:58
are you i thought you had to offer them
08:00
back to the academy awards first for a
08:02
dollar yeah and then at the academy
08:04
awards are like oh we can't really
08:05
afford that then
08:07
then you can put your oscar on ebay
08:10
we'd love to afford it but unfortunately
08:11
we blew all the budget for this year on
08:12
buying every woman who attends magic
08:14
vagina surgery
08:18
and i have a few recursive things can i
08:21
say those so this is an award ceremony
08:22
for awards there's a village um called
08:25
barton on the water in gloucestershire
08:27
and it has a one-ninth scale exact
08:29
replica of the village inside the
08:31
village but that replica also has a
08:34
village inside of it and that replica
08:37
has a village inside of it and the
08:39
recursion stops after level four well
08:41
five if you include the original village
08:43
yeah yeah it's got five villages inside
08:45
a village inside a village inside a
08:46
village have you guys heard of um alice
08:49
brady no who won an oscar in 1938 she
08:52
won the best actress oscar in best
08:53
supporting actress in a film called in
08:55
old chicago and she was unable to make
08:58
it so i think she was either on holiday
08:59
or she was sick everyone knew she was
09:00
unable to make it so someone went and
09:02
picked up the oscar in her place at the
09:03
ceremony um turns out no one knows who
09:06
that person was she hadn't sanctioned
09:08
that at all and someone just walked off
09:09
with her oscar no one's ever found out
09:11
where that is wow i don't know who that
09:12
guy was they just need to search for a
09:14
person with vaginal surgery
09:17
check it against all the records quite
09:19
hard to search for that claim
09:21
oh you guys are not googling hard enough
09:25
um should we move on to our next fact
09:27
okay time for fact number two and that
09:29
is andrew hunter murray my fact is that
09:32
napoleon loved roast chicken so much
09:34
that his household chefs were constantly
09:36
cooking some in case he decided he
09:37
wanted any
09:40
which is my personal aim for my life
09:43
i think that's when you know you've made
09:44
it but so is this i mean is there a lot
09:46
of is is chicken sort of really if you
09:49
read a napoleon biography is it just
09:51
everywhere it's just constant mentions
09:52
of chicken
09:53
barely a page goes by in the seminal 700
09:56
page napoleon biography
09:58
he was more chicken than man by the end
10:04
um i don't know just something there was
10:05
an article about it recently which i
10:07
spotted this was at his uh palace in
10:09
paris uh the tuilery and um just chicken
10:11
was constantly being cooked on a spit
10:13
because he was very erratic in the way
10:14
he ate he was he would have meals at odd
10:16
times of day and he you know wasn't not
10:18
a breakfast lunch and dinner sort of man
10:21
um once when he went on a journey from
10:22
cairo to uh to a website i think suez um
10:26
he just took three roast chickens
10:27
wrapped in paper as his provisions with
10:29
him so yeah he loved it found a uh quite
10:31
a cool mussolini had a code word that he
10:34
used to tell his wife whenever he was
10:35
doing something in at the table and he
10:38
didn't want his mother-in-law to know
10:39
what he was doing
10:41
um what was he doing at the table is it
10:43
the same same as what these people were
10:45
doing at my award ceremony
10:48
sorry i should clarify yeah it was once
10:49
he left the table that he started doing
10:51
the thing which was so he loved dueling
10:53
uh with swords he was really obsessed
10:55
with dueling with swords and so he got
10:57
into fights all the time with people
10:59
over just minor little things and he
11:01
would say at the at the breakfast table
11:03
to his wife this was the line today we
11:06
are making spaghetti
11:08
and that was code to say today i'm going
11:10
outside to fight another man with swords
11:12
um and
11:14
like what happened if he actually was
11:15
eating spaghetti one day and then some
11:17
guy just came at him with a sword
11:18
because he thought it was a coke yeah i
11:20
know it's a confusing code i agree and
11:21
also i bet like at the same time the
11:23
mother-in-law because she was living
11:24
with them would probably be going oh
11:26
spaghetti tonight then and
11:28
no matter what was the plans for dinner
11:29
would suddenly be changed because
11:31
mussolini wanted a fight you've just got
11:32
a cooked man's hand here what happened
11:34
today with the spaghetti
11:36
how many secrets did he keep from his
11:37
mother did he have a code for i'm going
11:39
to enslave a nation and then go to war
11:41
with various other nations was that and
11:44
now i'm going to feed the cat
11:46
yeah um just as a side note to this fact
11:49
i found a website all about rabbits
11:51
during the course of my research called
11:52
napoleon bunny part
11:57
just
11:58
just so you knew was napoleon once not
12:00
attacked by rabbits there is this story
12:02
yeah and it's hard to know what's um
12:04
propaganda it's been explained as his
12:06
like biggest ever defeat that he was
12:08
attacked by bunnies on a on a
12:10
battlefield and had to run away or
12:11
something yeah i thought it was when he
12:12
was visiting egypt possibly um but yeah
12:15
he was he was mobbed by rabbits uh when
12:16
he was out uh hunting or shooting and
12:18
people always think he's afraid of cats
12:20
don't they which i don't think is true
12:21
but i think they're confusing him with
12:23
napoleon in the third his nephew who
12:25
used to have to jump onto a table if a
12:27
cat entered the room or like climb up
12:30
the curtains to avoid it that's the one
12:32
thing cats can do
12:36
that's weird not a smart man that's why
12:37
he doesn't have the uh yeah the kudos to
12:39
his uncle and josephine's dog really
12:42
hated napoleon yeah and apparently
12:44
during their wedding night it bit him on
12:46
the leg while he was asleep not during
12:48
the yeah so they had a problem with
12:49
animals didn't they i wonder if his
12:51
actual the rest of his life has actually
12:53
distracted us from the fact that he was
12:55
the one human on earth who animals all
12:57
hated unanimously and that we've been
12:59
blinded to that actual real
13:00
extraordinary fact about a man
13:02
there was another napoleon i think one
13:04
of the very last napoleon members of the
13:06
napoleon family uh jerome bonaparte
13:09
jerome bonaparte
13:11
they moved to new york uh or the fact no
13:14
they did guys
13:16
now stop it
13:17
they escaped after the after the um the
13:20
fall of napoleon lots of his family
13:21
members with lots and lots of money um
13:23
and one of them died jerome bonaparte i
13:25
think it was died after tripping over
13:27
two entangled dog leads while out on a
13:30
walk oh my god
13:33
[Music]
13:35
well also he had problems with horse
13:37
right i'm loving this theory i really
13:39
think he might be right
13:40
so some historians speculate that the
13:42
reason that he lost waterloo is because
13:45
he had incredibly bad hemorrhoids uh
13:47
which was a serious problem for him that
13:48
repeated throughout his life and that he
13:50
couldn't sit on his horse throughout
13:52
that day which is true so i think we
13:53
don't have any evidence that he rode his
13:54
horse and so he couldn't survey the
13:56
battlefield properly and he couldn't
13:58
like ride his forces into battle he had
14:00
to stay backstage because he couldn't
14:01
sit in a saddle it was too painful and
14:03
there we go that was the end of
14:05
everything so you just can't get high
14:06
enough i mean you can get that short
14:08
this is a sort of myth that he was short
14:10
wasn't it yeah he was a li he was kind
14:12
of short he was um i think he was an
14:14
inch taller than sarkozy
14:16
okay but at the time he was taller than
14:18
the average frenchman and he was taller
14:19
than nelson i'm sorry to say but it is
14:21
weird how often i was reading a uh thing
14:23
of first first-hand sources about
14:25
napoleon and it's weird how often people
14:27
point out his small stature given that
14:28
we say that he was above average height
14:30
maybe he just seems you know when he
14:32
sees someone who like seems like there's
14:33
more but actually they're six foot maybe
14:35
he's just had a very small
14:37
demeanor
14:38
i don't know why were people always
14:40
going on about it
14:41
can i um can i tell you someone else who
14:43
likes chicken yeah yeah yeah
14:46
is it is it i james like chicken
14:50
uh no it's stacey irving from birmingham
14:52
of course
14:53
she eats chicken nuggets it's the only
14:55
thing she eats chicken nuggets all the
14:56
time she has 20 a day that she shares
15:00
with her boyfriend and doctors have worn
15:02
that it's very very very bad for her
15:04
health just eating chicken nuggets i
15:06
mean that's if she shares them she's not
15:08
having 20 a day then that's like
15:11
i mean she is kind of like it is really
15:13
bad for her health but the newspaper
15:14
article said a less serious consequence
15:16
of her craving is that she's struggling
15:18
to store all of the free toys that come
15:20
with the fast food meals
15:23
so she might be dying but yeah where's
15:25
she gonna keep those toys
15:27
what is it the world's largest chicken
15:29
nugget is twice the size of the world's
15:31
largest chicken
15:32
[Music]
15:33
whoa really yeah but imagine finding
15:37
that in the box
15:41
and someone else actually um you'll
15:43
probably know this gary watkinson from
15:45
huddersfield um of course
15:47
he only eats beans on toast
15:50
that's the only thing he ever ever eats
15:52
and it's from ever since he can remember
15:54
but he actually said the beans on toast
15:56
thing is only more recent uh before that
15:58
it was just beans and toast separately
16:05
[Applause]
16:07
and then like a second einstein one day
16:09
a moment of inspiration
16:15
yeah ivan wake from the nutrition
16:17
society said gary is probably not
16:19
constipated
16:29
so just on the subject of leaders and
16:32
and and food so a lot of leaders get
16:34
given international gifts all the time
16:36
i'm thinking in particular the american
16:38
presidents two pandas were given to
16:40
nixon that kind of thing
16:42
i discovered that lbj lyndon b johnson
16:46
was given by an unnamed source a chinese
16:50
chef called mr wong
16:52
who just rocked up to the white house
16:54
door and he used to there's all these
16:56
reports no one really knew what he was
16:58
doing there mr wong just lived with them
17:00
during his term they were trying to go
17:02
to the holiday retreat that they go to
17:04
and they couldn't find mr wong because
17:05
they were bringing him because he
17:06
decided to play hide and seek with the
17:08
president and they eventually found him
17:10
behind some curtains um after like a
17:13
good long search and he was hiding from
17:15
a cat to be there
17:18
presidents aren't allowed to accept
17:19
gifts that are worth more than something
17:20
like five dollars so it must have been
17:22
an extremely cheap man
17:24
i don't know
17:26
did you know that fittingly um a someone
17:29
bought so napoleon has two of those hats
17:31
that survived the napoleonic hats and
17:33
one of them was bought for 1.5 million
17:35
pounds last year and it was bought by a
17:37
chicken mogul
17:39
it was a bought by this korean guy who
17:42
owns a chain of chicken fried chicken
17:44
restaurants the har rim group which i
17:46
think provides fried chicken to the
17:48
people of korea on things of napoleon's
17:50
being sold um
17:52
in 2006 one of napoleon's teeth was sold
17:55
for 11 000 pounds
17:58
um in june this year a couple of months
18:00
ago a single one of napoleon's hairs was
18:02
sold at auction for 130 pounds and i
18:04
think we've said before on this podcast
18:05
that um after he died napoleon's penis
18:08
was removed and mummified and has passed
18:10
through several hands and has been
18:11
auctioned several times but i have a
18:13
theory that someone out there is
18:14
reassembling napoleon
18:19
i think the hair thing is a small
18:21
victory for napoleon against wellington
18:24
because um so later on the hair's
18:26
obviously depreciated in value because
18:27
in the 90s a lock of napoleon's hair
18:29
sold for 3 680 pounds at auction and i
18:32
think in the same year wellington's hair
18:34
only got 598. so that's quite a nice
18:36
it's like balances out the record
18:39
between those guys
18:41
a penguin named napoleon boulder parts
18:43
has fallen in love with a wellington
18:45
boot
18:45
[Laughter]
18:50
can you imagine if we don't know really
18:53
what reincarnation is but everything is
18:55
conscious and that's them actually just
18:57
having a sorry about that past life i
18:59
hope you're well
19:01
they never met did they did they not
19:03
never met but um so once uh the english
19:07
had defeated the french wellington had
19:09
an idea that he presented the british
19:10
government that was discussed that
19:12
rather than sent him into exile they
19:14
build him a house really near
19:15
wellington's house somewhere on the
19:17
british coastline and they live near
19:19
each other and they just hang out and
19:21
exchange
19:22
tips like strategic
19:24
i mean what a great idea who ki boshed
19:27
that plan because that sounds fantastic
19:29
we've said on the show that wellington
19:31
was obsessed with napoleon he bought all
19:32
of napoleon's stuff after waterloo and
19:34
he hired napoleon's ex cook
19:36
the mysterious and everlasting mr wong
19:43
i'm gonna have to move us on in a second
19:45
um has anyone got anything else i got
19:47
one last thing this is it's not
19:49
particularly interesting or anything but
19:51
um it's just hard sell down please
19:54
sometimes you read a sentence you think
19:55
that's the best sentence i've read today
19:57
uh so it's just this stalin loved
19:59
bananas and would be furious if you
20:01
served him a substandard banana
20:06
okay it's time for fact number three and
20:08
that is my fact my fact this week is
20:10
that imdb was originally just a list of
20:14
actresses with beautiful eyes
20:17
it just started as a as this little list
20:20
that the guy created and he just thought
20:22
i need to put together a list of all the
20:24
actresses that i think people need to
20:26
know have beautiful eyes and then people
20:28
started going to and adding other lists
20:30
and then imdb grew out of it and they
20:31
were it was called those eyes to begin
20:33
with that's the original name
20:35
wow the words reported is cole nebula
20:36
brought together two things to turn them
20:38
into imdb and people often say imdb grew
20:40
out of this list of women with beautiful
20:42
eyes and what we brought together was
20:44
one of those things was the list of
20:46
actresses with beautiful eyes and then
20:47
the other thing he brought in just a
20:49
little add-on was a list that someone
20:51
else had created which was a movie
20:52
ratings report where participants were
20:54
asked to rate movies on a one-to-ten
20:56
scale but it was mainly based imdb on
20:59
the actresses of beautiful eyes i mean
21:01
it sounds like the actress with
21:02
beautiful eyes was kind of a random
21:03
irrelevant list that just you know
21:06
happened
21:06
he sort of put them all together he
21:08
recalls the details of every film that
21:09
he sees and he has done since he was 13
21:11
years old col needham and he has seen
21:14
this was 18 months ago so he's seen more
21:15
since then but at the la at that count
21:18
it was 8505.
21:20
that's one film for every 48 hours since
21:22
he was born wow
21:25
his favorite film is vertigo really and
21:27
that's why it always tops the charts yes
21:30
because i he's rigging it isn't he yeah
21:32
because it's a good film but
21:34
you know i read an article that said
21:36
that um he and his it was a quote by him
21:38
he said that he and his wife love going
21:40
to the cinema and they watch a film
21:42
together every tuesday lunchtime but
21:45
what it sounds like is they do do that
21:46
but the rest of the time it's just him
21:48
watching loads of other movies yeah so
21:50
it's more like my wife has begrudgingly
21:52
agreed to come to the cinema with me
21:53
once a week otherwise we would never see
21:55
each other
21:58
when he was a boy he rented out the film
22:00
alien and he watched it every single day
22:01
for a fortnight wow that's a waste of
22:03
his time he needs to be getting through
22:04
these films yeah he can't well he said
22:07
that recently there are so many more
22:08
good films being made these days it was
22:10
just that at the time that was one of
22:11
the best films ever made and it was so
22:13
huge it is it is a fantastic place i do
22:15
i actually do a fair bit of qi research
22:18
by looking at the imdb did you know
22:20
section i love reading the user reviews
22:22
because the honesty of it is just here's
22:25
my favorite one i haven't even read
22:27
further than the title of this review
22:29
but it was for the movie batman and
22:31
robin and the headline was i lost faith
22:33
in humanity
22:38
signed the joker
22:41
do you know what is the bottom ranked
22:43
movie on all of imdb no uh it's called
22:46
jurassic shark
22:49
it's from 2012. it's got a rating of 1.5
22:53
and here's what it is it's when an oil
22:55
company unwittingly unleashes a
22:57
prehistoric shark from its icy prison
23:00
the jurassic killer maroons a group of
23:02
thieves and a beautiful young female
23:05
college student on an abandoned piece of
23:07
land
23:09
how did they manage to screw that up
23:11
though because that sounds like such a
23:12
winning this one okay i'll give you some
23:14
others in the bottom like 20 or
23:16
something um the hottie and the naughty
23:19
um from 2008. oh there's paris hilton
23:21
movie uh oh is it
23:23
apparently apparently i
23:27
apparently i think we found out why it's
23:29
not at the absolute bottom
23:30
[Laughter]
23:32
do you know the uh so there's one film
23:34
on imdb which isn't uh marked out of 10
23:37
which is spinal tap and the imdb page
23:40
marks that its rating is marked out of
23:41
11. so i guess 8 out of 11. which and
23:44
then which actually really affects how
23:46
good a movie it is in the overall rating
23:47
yeah because that's really annoying
23:49
because i worry that people haven't
23:49
noticed and they're giving you an eight
23:51
thinking that's out of 10 and that's 80
23:52
but it's not it's obviously x percent
23:54
that i'm not going to patronize you by
23:56
working out here myself right now
24:00
but
24:01
it's a lower percent yeah it should be
24:04
higher than 8 out of 11. i read um a
24:06
cracked.com article about the most
24:09
depressing imdb pages and their top one
24:12
was someone called leslie bremmer and
24:14
she's only had nine roles in her whole
24:16
career
24:17
they include girl in bikini shower girl
24:20
party girl and girl leaving room
24:23
[Laughter]
24:25
she's only had one named part in her
24:28
entire career and it was she played
24:30
sandy in a movie called school spirit
24:32
but on mdb it says in several scenes
24:35
actress leslie can be seen wearing a
24:37
necklace with the letter l on it despite
24:40
the fact that her character's name is
24:42
sandy
24:42
[Laughter]
24:45
um i'm gonna have to move us on in a sec
24:47
we're gonna power through to the last
24:48
one anyone got anything else i looked up
24:50
imdb's current poll of actresses with
24:53
beautiful eyes and it's just a list it's
24:55
really weird so there are lots of people
24:57
who submitted their own list but like
24:59
their own curator ones but this one's a
25:00
poll which takes other users into
25:02
account so the top 20 is all people like
25:04
cameron diaz rachel vice natalie portman
25:07
other people like that and then joan
25:09
planright is in there who i don't if you
25:11
know who that is but i mean she's 85
25:12
years old she is a kind of famous stage
25:15
actress she's often in things like
25:16
inspector moore's playing a servant
25:18
woman um and but does she have really
25:21
nice acts i looked really hard and to be
25:23
honest i found it hard to see what
25:24
they're talking about
25:27
everyone's got nice eyes i mean just
25:29
eyes are nice aren't they yeah
25:33
you know you can say someone's got nice
25:35
hair or not very nice hair but you look
25:36
eyes are eyes are just nice to look at
25:39
everyone likes looking at an eye
25:41
i've i've seen some bad eyes i've have
25:43
you there's some really bad eyes
25:45
um i have a couple of facts about eyes
25:47
if you want them yeah absolutely fact
25:48
number one eyes are lovely
25:50
[Laughter]
25:54
um fact number two um
25:56
the first person known to have had blue
25:58
eyes was we know who it was so it was 7
26:00
000 years ago it was a caveman living in
26:02
spain because it's a mutation so
26:04
everyone who's got blue eyes can trace
26:06
their ancestry back to that particular
26:08
um and i wonder if everyone just went to
26:10
that caveman and went you have beautiful
26:13
eyes
26:14
and then andy went everyone has a
26:16
beautiful eyes
26:18
okay it's time for our final fact of the
26:20
show and that is cecinski uh yes my fact
26:24
is that uh the word fascinate
26:27
literally means the embodiment of the
26:29
divine phallus
26:32
certainly the sense in which i use it
26:34
all the time
26:37
so this is the etymology of fascinating
26:39
it comes from the latin word fascanum
26:41
which was either fascinus the phallic
26:44
god which we who we know very little
26:45
about or it was a fascinating was
26:48
a phallic object that you carry around
26:50
for good luck uh which they did a lot of
26:52
the time because i just like to ward off
26:53
the evil eye or something like that yeah
26:54
exactly so the verb fascinary in latin
26:57
um was to use the power of the phallus
27:00
to either ward off the evil eye or to
27:02
hypnotize someone in an evil manner so
27:04
if you're if you're fascinating somebody
27:06
you are using the power of the phallus
27:09
in order to cast a spell on them this is
27:11
what dan was doing at that award
27:12
ceremony yeah
27:14
so i i spent most of today googling
27:16
penises are fascinating and
27:22
it's a lot out there all penises are
27:23
beautiful
27:29
[Music]
27:30
back in back may last year james and i
27:33
were in the office alone together and
27:37
we we kind of ran out of conversation
27:39
and this is kind of
27:42
this is really not the time not the
27:43
place for this people need to know
27:47
so we kind of just ran out of
27:48
conversation and james just in a way to
27:50
sort of just spark up conversation just
27:52
looked up to me and said hey do you know
27:54
that there was over 600 guys in the
27:56
world with two dicks
27:58
like as if that was like oh good we're
27:59
back in we have a conversation going
28:01
again and i googled it and there were
28:03
yeah there were 600 men in the world who
28:05
have two penises and on reddit there's
28:08
that website reddit they have that thing
28:10
ama uh and ama asked me anything one of
28:13
the most successful things i ever had
28:14
was someone coming on saying i have two
28:16
penises ask me anything uh it is one bit
28:19
where in an interview who's talking
28:20
about it says the most upsetting moment
28:22
for him was a girl he dated uh seriously
28:25
he got he got he was over one night
28:27
stands um and they dated for three
28:28
months they were just kissing and
28:29
cuddling she finally was ready i'd put
28:32
it off for another month after that uh
28:34
but when it came down to it i told her
28:36
that i was built different from other
28:38
guys so sort of slightly built different
28:41
uh she said she didn't care i revealed
28:43
them to her and she said she definitely
28:45
cared
28:49
if only she had known that all penises
28:51
are beautiful
28:53
there was a guy
28:55
that used to freak shows in the 19th
28:57
century and there was one guy called um
28:58
i think he's called like dos santos or
29:01
something like that and he was known as
29:03
the man with two swords
29:05
and he used to show himself off as a man
29:07
with two penises and he married a woman
29:10
called blanche
29:11
dumas or something like that she called
29:13
two scabbards or something
29:14
[Laughter]
29:22
no she but she did have two vaginas yeah
29:24
what
29:26
there's someone out there for everybody
29:29
okay this was a this was a fact about
29:31
etymology oh yeah yes sorry sorry yeah
29:34
back to roman penises at least because
29:36
that's more highbrow i think they were
29:38
more then um so they used to at the age
29:41
of nine days roman boys would be given
29:44
an amulet with a phallus inside it um
29:47
and that was to ward off the evil eye
29:50
that was the point of it and they'd have
29:51
to go around wearing this amulet with a
29:52
phallus inside it until they came of age
29:55
so they weren't really they weren't as
29:56
obscene as they are now they weren't
29:57
seen as being obscene because of this
29:59
whole good luck thing yeah and also
30:00
getting rid of this evil eye it was
30:02
really thought to be a really serious
30:04
thing yeah um there's a roman mosaic of
30:07
a phallus ejaculating into a disembodied
30:09
eye
30:11
wikipedia
30:12
described it as a relief
30:14
[Laughter]
30:19
[Applause]
30:20
so that have you seen the relief
30:24
i've seen it so it's uh it's pretty it's
30:26
so weird the phallus has its own penis
30:28
which is doing the ejaculating so it's a
30:31
lovely stone carved relief as james says
30:33
and uh i think it's in turkey and it's a
30:37
phallus with back legs and then there's
30:39
a smaller penis coming down from it and
30:41
that it's shoot ejaculating into an eye
30:42
with a scorpion on top of it amazing but
30:45
i like the penis with a little penis
30:47
it's like that village in
30:48
gloucestershire
30:52
i mean not exactly like that
30:55
yeah um
30:56
roman prostitutes sold things called
30:58
colifier which were little bread rolls
31:00
shaped like penises
31:02
did they yeah
31:05
you don't get that in greg's do you
31:06
[Music]
31:06
[Laughter]
31:10
maybe we should clarify that greg's is
31:12
not staffed exclusively
31:14
by prostitutes
31:16
[Laughter]
31:19
yes i would like to close that's why you
31:20
keep getting injected from greg's james
31:26
so there's a theory that the reason we
31:27
don't know very much about fascinous um
31:30
is that christians tried to eradicate
31:32
from our collective memory all the weird
31:35
stuff that the romans were interested in
31:36
like this because they thought it was a
31:37
they're a bit prudish but there's
31:39
another god called has a really good
31:40
name called mutunus to tunis and he
31:46
sorry
31:47
i was made sip and then that's the best
31:50
name i've ever heard yeah yeah what was
31:52
it
31:55
mooty tooty nobody ever called him um
31:58
and he was sort of a god of fertility
32:01
and so there was a tradition in which
32:04
there would be sculptures of mutunus to
32:05
tunis and he had a large phallus because
32:08
that was what he represented and it has
32:11
been written that roman brides to
32:14
prepare themselves for marriage would
32:16
have to straddle the phallus of motunus
32:19
to prepare themselves for the upcoming
32:21
intercourse he was a dildo
32:26
moody
32:29
if that's not in the goody bags that
32:31
next year's oscar is i
32:34
you're going to turn down your award
32:39
this person is called faskinos and
32:41
another word that comes from this guy um
32:44
whose name means penis is fascist
32:48
ah
32:50
because originally it came from faski
32:52
siciliani dei levotori and the word
32:55
fasci came from meaning a group
32:58
and that originally was like a bundle
33:00
but it also had the same kind of
33:01
connotations as something large and
33:03
whatever and that was where the um word
33:06
rods of office literally that roman
33:08
officials are carried to show their
33:10
authority so basically all fascists are
33:13
dicks
33:14
[Laughter]
33:15
[Music]
33:18
the rest of you didn't really get into
33:19
that
33:21
audience of fascists here tonight i feel
33:24
like i'm going to be making a lot of
33:25
spaghetti this evening
33:30
i i read um i discovered a new martial
33:34
art discipline today um
33:36
it's it's called 99 power chi gong so
33:39
it's part of qi gong it's one of the
33:40
rarer practiced uh bits of chi gong and
33:43
martial arts uh its other name is iron
33:46
crotch
33:47
men of a certain age suddenly need to
33:50
start attaching lots of really heavy
33:51
things to their dick and
33:53
allow it to just um get some exercise i
33:56
think that's the kind of thing
33:57
there's a guy called master ii he goes
33:59
around the world teaching people how to
34:00
do this he's described on his website as
34:02
a graceful man who moves like a swimming
34:04
dragon with sudden bursts of thunderous
34:06
gestures but what he's mainly known for
34:08
is that he can tow trucks with his penis
34:11
um what's wrong with the tow rope
34:15
well i'm just only mentioning it in case
34:17
uh anyone's looking for an interesting
34:18
christmas gift to give to someone
34:20
because you can buy iron crotch the dvd
34:22
which is like those exercise dvds that
34:25
you get and it comes with a rope and a
34:28
hook to look like

hello and welcome to another episode of
00:14
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:16
this week coming to you from the
00:17
edinburgh fringe festival my name is dan
00:20

00:22

anna chazinski
00:34
and once again we have gathered round
00:37
with our four favorite facts from the
00:39
last seven days and in no particular
00:41
order here we go starting with my fact
00:43
this week uh my fact this week is that
00:46
the current french scrabble champion
00:48
doesn't speak a word of french
00:51
this this was in the news not too long
00:53
ago so i feel like some people know it
00:55
but i just found that absolutely amazing
00:57
did he just randomly play letters which
00:58
all turned out to be accepted
01:01
he memorized the french scrabble
01:03
dictionary and then he just used that
01:05
and even in the finals he told the
01:08
french guy that's not a word
01:12
yeah it's an amazing character yeah his
01:14
name is nigel richards he's from new
01:15
zealand
01:18
[Laughter]
01:20
i read an article about him on
01:21
shortlist.com
01:22
entitled why nigel richards is better
01:25
than lionel messi
01:29
well they do call him the tiger woods at
01:30
scrabble don't they
01:32
because we should stress he is not known
01:34
to be an adulterer
01:38
i've read a thing a guy um a guy who's
01:40
written a book about scrabble he's a
01:41
sort of scrabble expert he's called uh
01:43
stefan fatsis and he said
01:45
right now richards is i'm quoting here
01:47
like tiger woods at his peak and then
01:49
tiger's saying i think i'll also take up
01:51
tennis and then winning wimbledon the
01:52
next year wow yeah do you think in golf
01:56
people call tiger woods the nigel
01:58
richards of golf yes
02:00
then what happens i saw an interview
02:02
with him on youtube and they asked what
02:04
the secret is and he said i'm not sure
02:06
there is a secret it's just a matter of
02:08
learning all the words
02:11
it's not secret anymore
02:13
and apparently he's read the 1953-page
02:17
chambers dictionary five times and
02:19
memorized every single word in the
02:21
dictionary wow
02:23
apparently you're at more of an
02:24
advantage scrabble players say when you
02:26
don't speak the language that you're
02:28
playing in i bet it's the french who
02:30
said that
02:30
[Laughter]
02:32
no it's um apparently it's more about
02:34
memorizing the coding of it the
02:35
mathematics of it you you look at it
02:37
like you look at a
02:38
i don't know a big i mean certainly what
02:40
you do need to do is know all the two
02:42
letter words because they're the most
02:43
useful ones and most of them aren't
02:44
really real words they're just like two
02:47
letters put together like real common
02:49
two-letter word i think it's the most
02:50
common two-letter word yeah it's the
02:51
most commonly used word in all of
02:53
scrabble is uh chi which is spelled q-i
02:58
um
02:59
do you want to hear a move that richards
03:01
made in
03:02
1998 yeah you do
03:06
right it's 1998
03:10
i've set the scene
03:11
[Laughter]
03:13
so he was he was pretty new at the time
03:14
to competitive scrabble and um he had c
03:17
d h l r n and then a blank tile children
03:21
there was an e on the board and he could
03:22
have played that and used up all seven
03:24
uh letters and got a 50 point bonus yeah
03:26
that's like an idiot oh
03:29
instead he found two o's and an e which
03:33
were all in a line on the board not
03:34
connected to each other and played all
03:36
of his letters to make the ten-letter
03:38
chloradine
03:39
oh my god
03:41
yeah that is like a dream because you
03:43
always want to connect all of those
03:45
vertical columns but it never works yeah
03:47
wow and he only learned the game at the
03:49
age of 28 and his mother introduced it
03:51
to him and she said
03:53
this is her words i said i know a game
03:55
you're not going to be very good at
03:59
because you can't spell very well and
04:01
you weren't very good at english at
04:02
school
04:04
unfortunately he is a mathematical
04:05
genius so you can see all the he just
04:07
sees it yeah but another scrabble move
04:09
that's been made was in the first ever
04:11
world scrabble championships in the
04:12
early 90s uh there was a winner but the
04:15
person who was runner-up the reason he
04:17
lost was because one of the last words
04:19
he played and sometimes you know you've
04:21
only got a few letters left you take a
04:22
pun on a word that you hope exists there
04:24
are lots of weird words and the first
04:25
word he play the last word he played was
04:27
the word smail as in snail with an m in
04:30
uh in the hope that that could get him
04:33
some points um and it couldn't but
04:37
now that smail is an anagram of another
04:39
word which gets points
04:42
yeah so he could have played males and
04:44
he lost the scrabble championship
04:45
because he played smail instead
04:49
what a dick what an idiot
04:53
that's awful he's very much the today's
04:55
tiger woods of scrabble
04:56
[Laughter]
04:58
um do you guys know about the inventor
04:59
of scrabble
05:01
um he was cut butts yes alfred butts
05:04
which is just a lovely surname i've read
05:07
moshe butts was his middle name not his
05:09
nickname right
05:11
yeah and he um he only revealed a few
05:13
days before he died um he lived until
05:15
quite old he was 93 i think um he said
05:18
that he was he was a bad speller and
05:20
everyone was like that's hilarious
05:22
and then he died it was less hilarious
05:24
but he um on his tombstone it said rpi
05:32
yeah he um he so he invented scrabble he
05:34
called it it originally i had another
05:37
name for it and then someone bought it
05:38
off him and turned it into scrabble said
05:40
mom we use this word and so he had that
05:42
whole thing of the difficult second
05:44
album you know and he actually released
05:46
the game and it was called uh
05:49
oh sorry i've lost it now i know what it
05:50
was yeah what's it called alfred's other
05:52
game that's it
05:54
this follow-up to scrabble was called
05:55
alfred's other game
05:57
no one knew who alfred was i don't know
05:59
anything about it because no one's ever
06:01
bought it as far as i can tell except
06:02
for reviewers who reviewed it online all
06:04
of whom say it's like solitaire but it
06:06
involves two players but the two players
06:08
don't interact with each other at all so
06:10
i think it's basically two solitaire
06:12
sets
06:13
and you're just supposed to sit next to
06:14
someone while you do them right yeah he
06:16
wasted a lot of his talent on the first
06:18
one i think
06:19
so he decided the points for scrabble uh
06:21
based on he studied the front page of
06:23
the new york times over a series of
06:24
months didn't he and then uh
06:26
logged the frequency of certain letters
06:28
in the new york times appeared and
06:30
decided the point scores based on that
06:31
so a lot of people now think we should
06:33
change it i wonder if he counted the
06:34
letters in new york times which appeared
06:36
every single day
06:37
that is such a good point yeah and
06:40
that's why why isn't worth as much as it
06:42
should be yeah yeah that's probably why
06:44
i'm so bad at scrabble
06:48
yeah and actually like if you're playing
06:50
it in another language it's not just the
06:51
words it's also the letters are worth
06:53
different amounts so that must be pretty
06:54
hard
06:56
in polish a zed is worth one point
07:01
yeah although a zed with an accent on it
07:03
is worth 10 points
07:05
really yeah that's weird in ukrainian an
07:07
apostrophe is worth 10 points
07:09
[Laughter]
07:12
but in armenian the board is 17 by 17
07:14
instead of 15 by 15 because they have
07:16
longer words
07:17
and they also have loads of letters that
07:19
i've never heard of um so for one point
07:22
the letters yek and ken
07:25
um for two points the letter men
07:28
for three points the letter ben
07:30
and for four points the letter
07:35
i assume that's how you pronounce it
07:38
well did you see the um gur has been
07:40
added to the official scrabble
07:41
dictionary in the last update which was
07:43
made in 2011 um the words gr thang and
07:47
blingy have been added
07:50
to this gravel dictionary you can now
07:52
play those
07:53
um there's this huge war between the
07:55
americans and everyone else because
07:57
classic classic wall there lovely
08:01
so
08:02
we'll as you guys know use the the ospd
08:05
um the official scrabble players
08:06
dictionary when we're playing scrabble
08:08
and we've actually combined that with
08:09
the osw the official scrabble word list
08:11
but the u.s refuses to do that and keeps
08:14
on using its own dictionary the
08:15
tournament word list which is a
08:17
completely different list of what i mean
08:18
there's probably some overlap
08:21
but
08:22
i mean as long as both have fang i'm
08:24
happy
08:26
but yeah people get very angry about
08:28
this well they don't like swear words in
08:30
the american one
08:31
that's a big thing yeah they've banned
08:33
all swear words and espn decided to put
08:36
the scrabble championships uh onto their
08:38
channel but they had a thing where they
08:41
said um these are the lists i think it
08:42
was about 170 words they said you can't
08:45
say this on television you can do this
08:46
in normal scrabble competition but you
08:48
can't do this on television but so what
08:50
they did was the first 30 rounds of the
08:52
competition they could use all the rude
08:54
words that were banned and then when it
08:56
got to the televised bit they couldn't
08:57
do it anymore that's pretty bad that
08:59
they were allowed it for half of the
09:00
tournament and then not afterwards yeah
09:02
because what about someone like me who
09:03
only ever plays rude words in scrabble
09:05
yeah
09:06
i'm going to be nailing it halfway
09:08
through and then i'm going to be
09:08
absolutely useless as on tv as well i
09:11
will be using a lot of those words but
09:13
not on the board
09:14
i'm going to have to move this on in a
09:16
few minutes so if anyone's got anything
09:17
else um there's a very cool thing about
09:19
scrabble in senegal uh where it's an
09:21
official sport and they take it so
09:23
seriously and that senegal hosted the
09:25
french scrabble world championship in
09:27
2008. so this was before richard's one
09:30
um but the senegalese government
09:31
composed an official song to mark the
09:33
occasion
09:34
and i read this in an article about it
09:36
that in senegal you can buy a set of
09:38
scrabble on most street corners
09:41
which i can't quite believe but i want
09:43
to believe and i'm never going to go to
09:44
senegal in case it turns out not to be
09:45
true
09:47
comes free with your bag of
09:48
crap just
09:49
some scrabble tiles
09:51
i was on some uh some online chat forums
09:55
um just separate to work and
09:59
it was one of those i was just taking a
10:00
break and it was you know it was like a
10:02
yahoo answers thing or something and it
10:04
was a parent who said this is literally
10:06
what it read hmm my seven-year-old just
10:09
swallowed a scrabble tile
10:10
no
10:11
wait it's a bananagrams tile he tells me
10:14
anyone have any experience with
10:19
i mean it is exactly the same a banana
10:20
graham's title to a scrabble tile i
10:22
guess she meant to specifically probably
10:23
just like make another tile out of
10:25
cardboard and use that
10:31
[Applause]
10:32
okay it's time for fact number two and
10:35
that is james harkin okay my fact this
10:38
week is that the world's only venomous
10:40
frogs head-butt their enemies to death
10:47
very little known species from millwall
10:49
[Laughter]
10:51
and you googled violent football team
10:53
didn't you you've got no idea what you
10:55
just said
11:00
i'll never go in case it turns out to be
11:01
true
11:03
i think that's very safe
11:06
so yeah you get a lot of um frogs which
11:09
are poisonous which means if you eat
11:10
them you would be sick but these are
11:13
venomous so they stick the poison into
11:14
the into the body of their prey uh and
11:17
they are called a parasphenodon bruno
11:19
eye and corythomantis greening eye and
11:23
they have really flexible necks and
11:25
really pointy skulls and they have
11:27
poison on their skulls actually a single
11:29
gram of venom from the first one of
11:31
those frogs would be enough to kill 80
11:33
people wow
11:35
so they're proper hardcore and they're
11:37
only little guys as well
11:39
wow wow yeah have you heard of the hairy
11:41
frog no so the hairy frog does this
11:43
thing that when it's getting into a
11:44
fight
11:45
it will break its toe bones just snap
11:48
them which is always intimidating to see
11:50
someone doing that when you're in a
11:51
fight with them when they start breaking
11:53
themselves before they go for you so
11:55
they'll just snap their toes off
11:58
and then they push their toe bones
12:00
through their skin
12:02
like wolverine and they just come out
12:05
and they go do you want some and then
12:08
that's the most aggressive fighting i've
12:10
ever heard of
12:12
andy i don't know if you know this is
12:13
exactly what they do in milwaukee
12:14
[Laughter]
12:16
also
12:18
sea cucumbers just while we're on the
12:19
kind of fighting defense thing um they
12:21
shoot their internal organs out through
12:24
their [ __ ] so
12:26
sorry andy hates when they say words
12:28
like that
12:29
i don't know that's why you two never
12:31
play scrabble together
12:34
um yeah that's that imagine that
12:35
shooting bits of your body out through
12:37
your ass that's quite crazy
12:38
afterwards they can regrow them and the
12:40
idea is that the predators will eat the
12:42
the stuff that's come out and they won't
12:44
eat their cucumber themselves but
12:46
actually they also have fish that live
12:48
inside the rain asses called slender
12:49
pearl fish so that must be pretty bad
12:51
for those fish who are just sitting in a
12:53
nice little home and suddenly everything
12:55
gets ejected out
12:58
a nice little home oh we've got it great
13:00
haven't we
13:01
the um
13:02
look at our anus
13:04
we've got a nice chew up two down anus
13:08
we're really hoping to move to a bigger
13:10
anus in the country
13:14
so uh there's zoologists were in ecuador
13:17
recently and they spotted this frog
13:18
there was obviously a new species
13:19
because it was like covered in spikes so
13:21
they'd never seen before so they're like
13:22
this is really exciting um and they
13:24
spotted it ran away so they spent years
13:26
and years in ecuador looking for this
13:28
frog again and they've eventually found
13:29
it i think this year or last year and
13:30
they got it they put it in a jar
13:32
overnight we'll deal with that tomorrow
13:33
you know classified or whatever came
13:35
downstairs in the morning and all of its
13:36
spikes had gone and so the zoologist the
13:38
female zoologist um said i thought i
13:41
must have just picked up the wrong frog
13:43
um and so i was very disappointed but i
13:46
just you know she said i laid down some
13:47
moss so it would be comfortable in there
13:49
and then i decided to take it back out
13:50
into the wild the next day and then the
13:52
next day the spikes were back and it
13:53
became apparent that this is a
13:54
shape-shifting frog the first known
13:57
shape-shifting amphibian wow do we know
13:58
if they can turn into princess
14:03
[Laughter]
14:06
when disney released the princess and
14:08
the frog and more than 50 children were
14:10
hospitalized with salmonella from trying
14:12
to kiss frogs wow
14:16
just play bananagrams with them like
14:17
normal much better um
14:20
so in 2008 uh some scientists found a
14:23
frog with no lungs so this is really
14:25
really cool uh it's called
14:28
barbarous don't write in and
14:31
they it hadn't been dissected before
14:32
because they only had two specimens of
14:34
it and they didn't want to destroy the
14:35
only two specimens they had so no one
14:37
nobody suspected that it wouldn't have
14:39
lungs and then they found another one
14:40
and they thought well let's dissect it
14:42
and
14:43
sucks to be the third frag
14:46
the early bird catches the worm the
14:47
second mouse gets the cheese and the
14:49
third frog is dissected
14:51
um
14:52
but it gets all its oxygen through its
14:53
skin it's so cool and the really really
14:56
cool thing is that it actively threw
14:59
away its own lungs
15:01
as then it used to have lungs and then
15:03
it thought i don't need these
15:06
and because it's because it saves space
15:08
on lungs in its body
15:10
it's a bit slimmer and flatter so it has
15:12
a bigger surface area so it can absorb
15:14
more oxygen proportional to its size
15:16
well that's like there's the scrotum
15:17
frog which does quite a similar thing um
15:20
yeah the scrotum frog is called that
15:22
because it just has incredibly floppy
15:24
skin so it's got these really tiny lungs
15:26
that can't really take much but you've
15:27
got way too much skin and so it's loads
15:29
of surface area and so it looks like a
15:30
scrotum because obviously far too much
15:32
skin is kind of gross um
15:34
yeah but it does help it respire can i
15:36
do some stuff on headbutting yes yeah
15:38
yeah um so um a welsh police force has
15:42
trained its dogs to disable their
15:43
targets by leaping at them and
15:45
delivering a flying headbutt rather than
15:48
biting them
15:50
and this is because people were being
15:51
bitten by police dogs and kind of
15:54
getting compensation or whatever and
15:56
they thought well a better way of doing
15:57
it is just having them attacking the
15:59
people with their heads i read that if
16:01
cats uh headbutt you uh this is what the
16:04
scientists report i saw said um
16:08
that when cats headbutt you uh it's the
16:11
equivalent of them giving you a high
16:12
five
16:14
what
16:15
and that's so like that's science you
16:17
say yeah
16:19
that's probably in my way
16:21
they just come over and they're just
16:22
going yeah man you're all right that's a
16:24
loose definition of the equivalent of a
16:26
high five i mean so they rub against you
16:28
to express affection because they can
16:30
take it up with science
16:33
high fives can signify so much joy
16:36
sorrow affection
16:38
sorrowful high five
16:40
that's the last time i take you to a
16:42
funeral
16:45
just one more thing about head butts um
16:47
bedfordshire council apparently
16:49
according to this newspaper article i
16:51
read they banned local artists from
16:53
displaying paintings behind glass
16:56
and there are a few different reasons
16:57
they gave but one of them was that
16:59
someone might headbutt a picture and cut
17:01
themselves who's going around the art
17:03
gallery's head putting pictures
17:05
the millwall fans day out national
17:07
gallery
17:08
oh my god i'm sorry i even mentioned
17:10
milwaukee
17:14
um actually have you read that the
17:16
head-butting record world record has
17:18
recently been set recently been reset
17:20
and beaten and by quite some way um wait
17:23
wait what to do what oh so this is what
17:24
you have to do you have to crack walnuts
17:26
with your head and so the record
17:28
previously was 44 walnuts so you lay
17:30
walnuts out on a table and you just bash
17:32
bash bash um 44 walnuts held by an
17:34
american and then this pakistani guy
17:36
called mohammed rasheed has reset the
17:38
record and he cracked 155 walnuts within
17:40
the space of a minute
17:42
a minute one one minute yeah he's the
17:44
tiger woods of
17:47
competitive headbutting
17:50
i'd just like to say that mr rasheed is
17:52
not an adulterer
17:54
that's what two and a half a second is
17:56
that right can that be right but is he
17:58
smashing a big bunch of them or are they
17:59
all in the line no they're in a line you
18:01
gotta do one at a time wow yeah i
18:03
couldn't do that with a hammer
18:05
no i know that's why you're not even
18:06
anywhere near the competition
18:09
that's why i failed to place
18:11
a i turned up with a hammer
18:14
did not break record
18:18
we're gonna have to move on in a minute
18:20
any last uh before we go um just did you
18:23
hear do you remember reading in 2005
18:25
about the exploding frog freak out in
18:28
hamburg
18:29
which is amazing it's so weird so there
18:32
was suddenly this started happening in
18:34
hamburg um thousands of frogs started
18:36
exploding and you know spattering their
18:39
entrails all over the streets and the
18:40
entrails would spat up to like a meter
18:42
wide and people didn't know why they
18:44
were doing this and there were these
18:45
weird theories flying around about what
18:46
was going on so some people thought
18:48
frogs were deciding to commit mass
18:50
suicide for no apparent reason um
18:52
someone else thought they'd caught a
18:53
virus from race
18:55
uh go on james um just wondering where
18:58
the horse racing theory came from yeah
19:00
yeah the horse exploding scandal in
19:02
hamburg the week before was
19:04
i can't believe i didn't mention that
19:07
so what actually happened um so what
19:09
happened was it turned out it was
19:10
cruised so crows had figured out that
19:12
you can't eat the whole toad because its
19:14
skin is poisonous and so you know you
19:16
die um but you can pierce the skin and
19:18
the only good bit of a frog any you know
19:20
food connoisseur knows is the liver
19:21
anyway you suck the liver out and then
19:23
what happens is the liver of these toes
19:25
is what's keeping all the other organs
19:26
in um and so they end up like they puff
19:29
up in defense and all their organs start
19:31
exploding out of their body wow yeah but
19:34
the crows have a nice bit of foie gras
19:36
and aren't poisoned so it depends whose
19:38
side you're on
19:42
um okay we're going to move on to our
19:44
next fact uh time for fact number three
19:46
and that is chozinski uh yeah my fact is
19:49
that when the film all quiet on the
19:51
western front was released in germany
19:54
goebbels went to see it at the cinema
19:56
and within 10 minutes he'd released
19:58
stink bombs itching powder and white
20:00
mice
20:01
in order to scare everyone out of the
20:03
cinema
20:04
so this was fun guy goebbels
20:08
everyone's favorite clown
20:09
and
20:11
so he did it 10 minutes in uh he started
20:14
doing it at the start but he wrote in
20:15
his diary he kept 10 000 pages of diary
20:17
entries which my god and one of his
20:20
pages related how he started doing it
20:22
and within 10 minutes the whole cinema
20:23
was in chaos people were running away
20:26
itching themselves you know fainting
20:28
with the smell uh yeah they really
20:30
didn't like that movie did they because
20:31
it was um it was the fact that the
20:34
german soldiers died in a not brave way
20:36
and the french soldiers did die in a
20:38
more brave way yeah so he got banned but
20:40
then ironically in poland it also got
20:43
banned because it was pro-german yeah so
20:45
germany banned it for being anti-german
20:47
and poland being pro-german what's
20:49
pretty crazy as well as i was reading
20:50
the imdb page for it today and in the in
20:53
the little trivia bit um they were
20:56
saying that a lot of the extras in the
20:57
movie were actual german soldiers from
21:00
world war one who had moved over to
21:01
america who they said we're doing this
21:03
thing and we just want to know about how
21:05
you would march and so on in the
21:06
uniforms can we have a better look and
21:08
they all said i'd love to be in the film
21:10
and so a lot of the german soldiers in
21:12
it are actual german soldiers from world
21:14
war one pretty crazy yeah pretty
21:16
podcasting um so the intervention that
21:18
was kind of i think he had a lot of um
21:20
brown shirts or the essays with the
21:22
brown shirt
21:23
to disrupt the yeah to freak people out
21:26
yeah and then it was i think it was
21:27
banned shortly afterwards in germany it
21:29
was banned before the nazis came to
21:30
power i think it was 19 yeah it was uh
21:32
it was 1930
21:34
30. um but you know they were already a
21:36
thing yeah yeah um so yeah he brought
21:38
the brown shirts in and it was banned
21:40
and the writer of the original book who
21:41
was called
21:42
uh remarks remark had to leave the
21:44
country and then he was invited so he
21:46
was told he had to leave because he
21:47
wrote this unpatriotic book and turned
21:49
it into an unpatriotic film and then
21:51
goebbels obviously rethought that and
21:53
wrote him a few months later and said
21:54
actually no no honestly come back do
21:56
come back but at this point you know
21:58
people were starting to get the hang of
21:59
the whole nazis not being good guys idea
22:01
and so remark wrote back and said what
22:03
65 million people want to get out of the
22:05
country and i'm supposed to come back of
22:07
my own free will not on your life and he
22:09
never returned which is probably good
22:12
um he was nominated for a nobel peace
22:14
prize for that who was um remark oh wow
22:16
for the film um so it's quite cool you
22:19
can go on the nobel peace prize website
22:22
and look at all the nominations that
22:22
were more than 50 years ago when they've
22:24
been released and that same year 1931 he
22:26
was nominated for writing or quite on
22:28
the western front also the government of
22:31
finland was nominated
22:33
i don't know why yeah
22:35
just really peace-loving guys back then
22:38
yeah not not like now when we're all
22:40
living under the finished jack boot
22:46
i have a few things about uh censorship
22:48
and stuff
22:50
there was a british council who banned
22:52
the life of brian even though they had
22:54
no cinemas in their boundaries
22:59
and in 1999 the censors in bournemouth
23:02
asked to see a sexually explicit french
23:04
film with a view to banning it even
23:07
though no cinema had expressed any
23:08
interest in showing it
23:12
[Applause]
23:14
wasn't the first everything um not
23:17
banned but censored in in the film
23:19
industry in this country was a
23:21
it was the cheese board who sorry that
23:24
it's not an actual cheese board it's
23:25
like a group of people who talk about
23:27
cheese a lot and there was a movie that
23:29
came out where they showed i think it
23:30
was a close-up on cheese and all the
23:32
bacteria and stuff so they asked for it
23:33
to be censored and it was censored it
23:35
was the first ask and get of censorship
23:38
on in cinemas yeah what a movie though
23:40
it sounds great hey
23:42
can you imagine ordering the cheese
23:43
board at a restaurant and you get 12
23:45
blokes who just love cheese delivered to
23:47
your table
23:50
wish i had had the pudding
23:53
um
23:54
on monty python's life of brian oh yeah
23:57
um because it was banned in lots of sort
23:59
of different local boroughs in the uk as
24:01
james says and
24:03
in thanet in kent the band was
24:05
overturned and there were local uh
24:07
adverts placed in the newspaper saying
24:09
have you seen monty python's life of
24:11
brian thanat district council have
24:14
because they'd had to see it in order to
24:15
overturn the ban
24:19
i think every film should be appetizing
24:23
i was looking at pranking and in the
24:26
19th century
24:27
electricity-based pranks were really
24:30
fashionable because they just discovered
24:31
how to how to sort of wield electricity
24:33
there were things on sale like electric
24:35
hammocks uh you could buy you lie in a
24:38
hammock it electrocutes someone that's
24:39
quite fun
24:42
electric carpets so someone's walking
24:44
over your carpet and then you could it's
24:45
the same idea yeah
24:48
i read one that was called the uh it was
24:50
called the wireless trick telephone did
24:52
you hear about this one okay the
24:53
wireless trick telephone this is the
24:55
description for it when the candidate
24:56
attempts to answer this phone a 32
24:59
caliber blank cartridge will explode
25:02
with a loud report and at the same time
25:04
white powder will be blown with a strong
25:06
blast from the transmitter into his face
25:09
that's a full-on prank and then
25:12
check this one out the pledge alter
25:14
right this if you bought it is an altar
25:17
it's the size of like we've all got
25:18
altars
25:21
a very practical prank uh that you would
25:23
almost do daily use it for vicars making
25:25
pranks you must be right who's who's
25:27
using the pledge alter
25:28
[Laughter]
25:30
okay well let's let's picture it as
25:31
there that it is in the church this is
25:33
what happens this is the description the
25:34
candidate kneels before the altar in a
25:36
darkened room when low up before him
25:39
jumps a skeleton with large illuminated
25:41
glaring eyes a blank cartridge is
25:43
exploded
25:46
a stream of water hits him in the face
25:48
an electric shock is shot through his
25:50
knees
25:51
[Laughter]
25:53
april fool's day pretty wild in the
25:55
1800s that's amazing the original thing
25:58
was about um itching powder wasn't it
26:00
yeah yeah and um in world war ii the uh
26:03
british put itching powder into german
26:05
uniforms um to try and you know i think
26:08
this is in the early days when we
26:09
weren't sure we wanted to go all out
26:12
we're not sure we wanted to pull the
26:13
full pledge alter trick on the germans
26:16
um
26:17
yeah they called it itch creek i believe
26:19
in the business
26:21
no they did call it that way
26:24
that's amazing but how did we get access
26:26
to german uniforms to predicting powder
26:28
in them they infiltrated laundries so
26:30
they had members of the resistance in
26:31
germany he would go into laundries and
26:33
then you know then well it's obvious
26:35
from there
26:37
but another thing that happened so in
26:39
norway um the norwegian resistance when
26:41
uh noi was taken by the nazis uh their
26:44
resistance coated condoms in itching
26:46
powder and sold them to the nazis wow
26:49
which i think caused problems yeah
26:53
be very stimulating for a second
26:58
you're so positive about everything
27:03
the you know the seven year rich it's a
27:05
saying for after seven years in a
27:07
relationship it all goes sour or
27:08
whatever um it seems to be a thing that
27:10
a lot of scientists do studies on to see
27:12
when the actual time is it's not seven
27:15
years it's another time
27:16
and obviously the newspapers pick up on
27:18
it there was an article in the daily
27:20
telegraph a couple of years ago that
27:22
said it's actually a four year rich not
27:23
a seven year rich and the daily mail
27:25
seems to go for this almost weekly
27:28
and they have had various articles over
27:30
the last few years that say actually
27:32
rather than a seven year rich humans
27:34
have either a 12 year rich a five year
27:36
itch an 11 year rich a 25 year age a
27:40
three year rich an 11 month itch or the
27:43
most recent one i found was a two year
27:45
six month and 25 day itch
27:49
i think someone has been supplying the
27:50
male hq with these condoms
27:52
[Laughter]
27:54
it's been a very exciting few years for
27:57
itch science i think um
27:59
i've seen
28:00
number of headlights we've cracked a lot
28:02
of mysteries in the last few years uh
28:03
2011 they worked out why they've worked
28:06
out that itching is contagious so that's
28:08
a big moment and in 2014 they've worked
28:11
out that scratching makes you want to
28:13
scratch more
28:14
so when you said contagious do you mean
28:15
from one person to another yeah so if i
28:17
if you start itching i'll be like oh
28:18
that looks good and then i'll just do it
28:20
we've already established your itching
28:21
fetish
28:25
the only reason dan knows so much about
28:26
itch science in the last few years is he
28:28
subscribes to itch monthly
28:31
it's good
28:35
[Applause]
28:37
um you know in cinemas i don't know if
28:39
anyone here knows about them but i'd
28:40
certainly never heard this cinemas used
28:42
to have crying rooms do you know about
28:44
that
28:45
yeah i know so immediately i thought it
28:46
was for any sort of like millwall fans
28:48
going i'm not gonna i'm not gonna cry
28:49
here and then suddenly the notebook is
28:51
really getting to them and they're just
28:52
like just i'm gonna be gone for a minute
28:54
and they go into this room uh it turns
28:56
out it's for babies it's mothers with
28:58
babies they would go in there if it was
28:59
crying so they could continue to watch
29:00
the movie and it would be just a
29:02
soundproof room and they would have
29:03
speakers coming in but they could watch
29:05
it from in there and not have to miss
29:07
the movie themselves or fathers that was
29:09
really sexist of me fathers and and
29:10
babies that sounds like such a fantastic
29:12
thing i quite like the idea of just
29:14
being individual booths for everyone so
29:16
i don't have to be near anyone else in
29:18
the cinema i think that's called just
29:19
your bedroom yeah or the seedier parts
29:22
of soho there are places that you can
29:25
do that in
29:26
um we're going to have to move and
29:27
they're crying
29:32
okay it's time for our final fact of the
29:33
show and that is andrew hunter murray my
29:36
fact this week is that defunct sports
29:38
from the early 20th century include
29:41
archery golf
29:42
boxing on horseback
29:45
and competitive flagpole sitting
29:49
this is from a book i read recently and
29:52
it's such a good book i loved it so much
29:54
it's called fox tossing octopus
29:55
wrestling and other forgotten sports
29:58
uh by edward brooke hitching and it is
30:00
electric it is
30:02
this list of incredible sports that
30:04
we've forgotten about so an archery golf
30:06
just to confirm is archery hyphen golf
30:07
not archery comma and golf right because
30:09
you still have those ah yes yes yes this
30:11
is where you have golfers and archers on
30:13
the same course at the same time
30:17
i read an article where there was one
30:19
person the archer was playing against
30:21
the golfer is that was that the standard
30:23
way you'd have an archer versus a golfer
30:24
if you aren't just take a 10-point
30:26
handicap against cultures because
30:27
obviously they've got a bow and arrow
30:30
but um so the archers fire their shots
30:32
and everyone tees off from the same spot
30:33
except the archers are firing towards
30:35
the the um what's it got the hole and um
30:39
you don't want to get all technical
30:40
[Laughter]
30:42
um and so the for the veracruz as the
30:44
hole is something like a tennis ball
30:45
balanced on a tin can you have to hit it
30:47
and you have three different kinds of
30:48
arrow that you use you have a light one
30:50
for the first drive and then a really
30:52
heavy one for the putting um yeah and
30:54
people played it until the 1970s was a
30:56
sport sounds great how about horse
30:59
boxing talk us through that is that
31:01
against the horse yeah no is two guys
31:04
sitting on horseback and boxing each
31:06
other and you lose if so the other guy
31:08
knocks you off your horse and you're
31:10
unable to get back on within 10 seconds
31:12
well it's similar to chess boxing right
31:14
people like to inject boxing i think
31:16
into other sports to make other sports
31:17
more exciting like chess boxing where
31:20
you play a round of chess and then you
31:21
do a round of boxing and i think the
31:22
winner is the person either who manages
31:24
to checkmate the other person or to
31:26
knock them unconscious i don't really it
31:27
doesn't sound fair that does it because
31:29
i'm okay at chess but probably would get
31:31
knocked out immediately in boxing so you
31:33
have to get checkmate pretty fast well
31:35
that's you've got to be multi-talented
31:37
and also you probably get increasingly
31:38
worse at chess the more you are
31:39
concussed
31:40
i think yeah but then the other person
31:43
doesn't get worse at boxing the more i
31:44
put him closer
31:47
if anything it'll only make him angrier
31:53
just on the horseboxing thing um you had
31:55
to wear boxing gloves obviously because
31:57
they played by queensberry rules but
31:58
that made it very hard to grip the reins
32:00
so
32:01
most of the round involved lining your
32:03
horse up next to the other guy's horse
32:07
really hard to do with boxing gloves on
32:09
yeah
32:11
so a few other of these sports that was
32:13
in that book i did have a look through
32:15
the book and it's amazing um ice tennis
32:18
uh which seems really cool um is
32:20
literally what it says it is uh phone
32:23
booth stuffing
32:25
and the record is 25 uh just if anyone
32:28
wants to go against it um yeah and
32:30
flagpole sitting that's my favorite one
32:31
oh yeah yeah because they produced huge
32:34
celebrities off the back of it
32:36
no honestly so there was one guy in
32:38
particular called
32:39
alvin shipwreck kelly um
32:42
so no one's quite sure why he's called
32:44
shipwreck other than he claimed to be
32:46
involved in five shipwrecks and
32:48
that's probably why
32:53
he claimed he'd been on the titanic yeah
32:55
but people aren't sure about that
32:56
because the passenger records seem to
32:58
not indicate uh him yes yeah his um i
33:01
don't think he'd let someone called
33:03
shipwreck on the tank
33:06
he probably gave him a false name john
33:08
iceberg smith welcome on board
33:11
you're all good mate nice to see you
33:14
um but paul sitting genuinely was i
33:16
think um a proper fad in the 1920s and
33:20
30s in america um people were really
33:22
into it and constantly breaking records
33:23
for it and and so i was looking into the
33:25
the british newspaper archive uh during
33:28
that time and we really disapproved of
33:30
it like every single article that
33:31
references pole city in america talks
33:33
about this degrading exhibition has now
33:35
reached the dangerous stage so basically
33:37
i mean the competition is you just sit
33:39
at the top of a pole for as long as you
33:40
possibly can until it gets uncomfortable
33:42
and then you can thought poles would be
33:43
quite spiky at the top they often had a
33:45
platform
33:47
i mean really really tiny you know okay
33:49
yeah but you
33:50
know grows and balls guys
33:54
71 hours was the record in the dundee
33:56
courier that was reported
33:58
well shipwrecked kelly supposedly sat on
34:00
it for 49 days and one hour yeah that's
34:03
good yeah yeah that's pretty amazing
34:04
very much the tiger woods
34:06
[Laughter]
34:09
he did a 28 city tour of sitting on
34:12
poles um and he did a tour and he
34:14
charged people with roof access so that
34:17
they could see him at the top of his
34:18
pole so you bought tickets to the roof
34:20
of buildings and you could watch him
34:22
doing it he did it all through his life
34:23
david blainey yeah exactly yeah and he
34:26
um
34:27
for sleeping obviously because you would
34:29
have to sleep a bit he would cut holes
34:31
into the side of the flagpole and put
34:33
his fingers in there and if he and then
34:35
if he slept um and he started to sag
34:37
right down it would hurt his fingers and
34:39
he'd sort of you know stay stay up there
34:41
like that yeah he must keep him up there
34:43
it's an odd career choice isn't it
34:45
yeah he died he died you know broke many
34:47
years after the glory days yeah he
34:50
exactly his career went downhill he got
34:51
hit by a car and he so he died from
34:54
being hit by this car and they found on
34:56
him the scrap book of his life and it
34:58
was called the title was the luckiest
34:59
fool on earth
35:01
yeah ooh ironic yeah uh i want to know
35:04
the name of this book was octopus
35:06
something and
35:07
what's fox tossing
35:09
you have an arena
35:11
right
35:11
and you get men and women lined up
35:13
opposite each other and you're all
35:14
holding long long strips of cloth loose
35:16
and slack on the ground you release a
35:18
lot of foxes into the arena
35:20
when they run over the bit that you're
35:22
holding you and your partner pull it
35:24
taut and the fox flies into the air
35:26
that was a genuine sport that the
35:28
aristocracy played in the 17th century
35:30
in europe
35:31
and the fun was in seeing the foxes die
35:33
the fun wasn't seeing the foxes fly
35:35
through the air i think that's biased
35:37
reporting well we're not all as
35:38
wholesome as you anna
35:41
i read um
35:42
an article about that and the end of the
35:44
article said um it was not unknown for
35:46
the terrified animals to turn on the
35:49
tossers
35:50
[Laughter]
35:53
there was a spot in ancient egypt called
35:55
fisherman's jousting it was really
35:58
popular and you would basically get
36:00
people in boats and they would joust
36:01
against each other try and knock each
36:03
other off the boats and it took place on
36:05
the nile but of course the worst thing
36:07
about the nile is it's full of
36:08
crocodiles
36:09
and because the crocodiles were sacred
36:11
it was illegal to fight back if
36:14
crocodile came anywhere you'll be in big
36:16
trouble mister if you fight back against
36:17
the crocodile that's eating you
36:22
what legal sanction exactly can we work
36:24
it's true it's very much a no-win
36:26
situation
36:29
yeah
36:30
um do you know the um national sport of
36:33
afghanistan
36:35
no no is a goat dragging
36:38
but buzz cashie uh which is played in
36:41
countries across central asia but it's
36:43
like polo but with instead of a ball a
36:46
headless goat so the ghost bits died
36:48
already and you've removed the head yeah
36:50
i'm sure it's died already once you've
36:52
removed the head
36:54
i know i said that in the the right
36:56
order i think it died then you remove
36:58
the head um and then you have to drag it
37:00
towards a goal and then throw it through
37:02
a goal i don't know why you'd use a goat
37:03
instead of a bull maybe they're
37:04
shortened bulls but that's the national
37:06
sport of afghanistan they love it well
37:07
we would have used a pig's bladder for
37:09
sucker and black in the old not an
37:10
entire pig though no it's much more
37:13
unwieldy
37:15
and millwall apparently they do though i
37:17
don't know if you know about that
37:20
um can i tell you a bit more about
37:21
flagpoles yes yes flagpole thing um so i
37:25
think the all-time champion of flagpole
37:28
sitting uh was a saint called simeon
37:30
steilites who lived up a pole for 36
37:32
years
37:34
um and he started with a flagpole six
37:36
feet off the ground
37:37
sorry not a flagpole but just a little
37:39
platform on a pole and then he went to a
37:41
higher one until he eventually was 60
37:42
feet up in the air
37:44
wow
37:44
he lived up there and um
37:46
i read a book about uh early
37:48
christianity about this guy and as it
37:50
says what was he doing
37:53
there were lots of theories as to why he
37:54
did it either he found the crowds who
37:56
approached him asking for wisdom and
37:58
advice too exhausting or he um
38:01
one theory that he wanted to be
38:02
physically closer to christ because
38:04
christ is in the sky
38:07
or he wanted like just a more spartan
38:09
existence than you could get in a
38:10
monastery and um his wikipedia page says
38:12
it has been stated that as he seemed to
38:14
be unable to avoid escaping the world
38:16
horizontally he may have thought to
38:18
attempt to try to escape it vertically
38:21
nobody says what he did with his poo
38:23
though
38:25
because he'd have to drop it off
38:26
wouldn't you he just threw it hold it at
38:28
those irritating people constantly
38:30
asking him for advice
38:31
down at the bottom because he still has
38:33
followers doesn't he um i think his most
38:37
well-known follower is a guy called
38:38
maxime kavtaradze and he's a 59 year old
38:42
monk and he's been living on a stone
38:44
pillar in georgia and he comes down once
38:46
a week but he spends basically his
38:48
entire life up on top of this pillar he
38:50
climbs his 131 foot ladder he has to
38:52
have staff who pull by a pulley system
38:55
his food and supplies up to him so you
38:57
know these people need to be
38:59
well staffed um and yeah he drops down
39:02
twice a week to give some advice to his
39:03
following masses and then he pops back
39:04
up onto the pillar and hangs out there
39:07
what a good man we're gonna have to wrap
39:08
up in a sec so have we got anything
39:10
thrown in before we go um the current
39:12

hello and welcome to another episode of
00:13
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:15
this week coming to you from the
00:17

00:28
[Applause]
00:35
and once again we have gathered around
00:36
the microphones with our four favorite
00:38
facts from the last seven days and no
00:40
particular order here we go starting
00:42
with you
00:43
andy murray andy my name is andy
00:47
my fact this week is that the first ever
00:49
pencils were used to draw on sheep
00:54
and i found this out last month at the
00:55
cumberland pencil museum
00:58
which is an amazing museum if you're
01:00
ever in the area you have to go uh it's
01:02
in keswick and it features among many
01:04
other things a giant collage of chris
01:05
evans made of pencils
01:08
which is
01:09
the most nightmarish thing it's so
01:11
amazing
01:12
um yeah so first pencils we use for
01:14
sheep so why
01:16
well i mean the story is and i'm not
01:18
sure how much uh this is sort of half
01:20
myth but the story is that some
01:21
shepherds found a load of graphite which
01:22
had been uh turfed up in a storm a tree
01:25
had been blown and there was this sort
01:26
of black shiny stuff in the roots and
01:28
they they realized that it made marks
01:30
and stuff and so they started using it
01:31
to draw on their sheep and the first
01:33
ever pencils were just lumps of graphite
01:35
wrapped in sheepskin okay that's good i
01:37
did slightly have an impression that
01:39
they were sort of writing you know
01:40
novels
01:42
just hand your sheep into a publisher
01:44
yeah there you go
01:46
so when did someone decide that that we
01:48
can now take it off sheep and put it
01:49
into other uses well that i mean that
01:51
initial discovery was in the 16th
01:53
century and there are some people who
01:54
say that it went back earlier people say
01:55
that the aztecs might have found it and
01:57
used it as a market a few hundred years
01:58
before but there isn't too much evidence
02:00
about that yeah but it was a massive
02:02
market wasn't the graphite like if you
02:03
stole graphite you would be sent to
02:05
australia as punishment yeah and they
02:06
used to have like armed guards um
02:08
chaperoning their horses and carts from
02:10
a graphite down to london didn't they
02:12
from cumbria yeah and even the miners as
02:13
you were mining it you would have two
02:15
men with blunderbusses next to you to
02:17
make sure you weren't slipping it into
02:18
your pockets it is kind of extraordinary
02:21
that so there was this naturally
02:23
occurring graphite that was found in
02:24
borrowdale in uh in the lake district
02:26
and that's the only big source of solid
02:29
graphite that's ever been found so we i
02:31
mean britain controlled the the pencil
02:33
industry for some time yeah we were
02:35
nailing that was huge that was a massive
02:37
deal yeah and though right now the the
02:40
cumberland pencil museum says this and i
02:41
can't quite believe it they say that in
02:44
1650 graphite was briefly more valuable
02:46
than gold well what they did was they
02:48
deliberately only mined it for short
02:50
amounts of time in the year um to kind
02:52
of keep the price up
02:54
because we had this monopoly on it and
02:56
we were sending it all away around the
02:57
world and they just wanted to keep the
02:58
price as high as possible oh clever
03:01
but now hasn't it now turned once again
03:03
into one of the most expensive materials
03:05
in the world pencils are more expensive
03:07
than gold yeah yeah
03:09
no no but so i have a few here i'll sell
03:11
to you after the show
03:14
we met we james and i have actually met
03:16
a guy who's his name's andre geim and he
03:20
discovered so he's a scientist but he
03:21
does all sorts of interesting science
03:23
things for example um they had the
03:25
biggest what was it the biggest magnet
03:27
in the world yeah he made a frog
03:28
levitate so well he basically he was
03:30
passing the big the biggest magnet in
03:32
the world and he thought that's a pretty
03:34
big magnet i wonder what would happen if
03:35
you something went into it so he threw
03:37
his ham sandwich into it and it floated
03:39
it just floated inside this magnet and
03:41
then he won an award for floating a frog
03:43
inside it do you think sheep and frogs
03:45
have a mutual support group where they
03:47
discuss what people have subjected them
03:48
to
03:50
they drew all over me for 300 years well
03:53
i was levitated between magnets would
03:55
you say you chucked a ham sandwich in
03:57
there yeah that's an amazingly cavalier
03:59
use of what is presumably a really
04:00
expensive bit of equipment i know it was
04:02
a bowl
04:03
sandwich
04:05
yeah he won a nick nobel price for that
04:07
but then he won a nobel prize for
04:09
discovering graphene yeah yeah which is
04:12
done which is pencils uh you know that
04:14
when you write with them that bit that
04:15
comes out back to you james
04:19
uh yeah it's a layer of carbon which is
04:21
basically one atom thick and they think
04:23
it's going to be the future and they'll
04:24
make all sorts of things and it turns
04:26
out that that is the strongest material
04:28
that we found in the universe
04:30
graphene is so strong that if you had a
04:32
sheet of it i think i read this you
04:35
could balance an elephant right and a
04:37
grown elephant on the elephant is
04:39
standing on a pencil and the pencil is
04:42
point down on a sheet of graphene and
04:44
the graphene won't break that's how
04:45
strong it is
04:46
how are you lifting the elephant onto
04:48
the pencil though i think that's the
04:49
question
04:52
so you were saying about how long was it
04:54
until we had pencils well actually
04:55
graphite is kind of okay but it wasn't
04:58
quite good for pencils because it kind
05:00
of fell apart a little bit and in 1843
05:03
um an artist called william brockenden
05:05
invented a machine which could press
05:07
graphite and so that you could have
05:09
actual lead like you would have in
05:10
pencils but that machine actually has
05:13
had a much better use they found out you
05:15
could use it to make pills and all the
05:17
pills that you eat today
05:19
all the pills all the many many pills i
05:21
have
05:22
i have some in my pocket which i'm going
05:23
to sell to dan after the show
05:25
yeah all the pills that you take today
05:27
um have come because of the invention of
05:29
pencils wow that's interesting really
05:32
yeah oh and um tabloids used to be
05:35
pills didn't they oh yeah that was the
05:36
original the tabloid that's what pills
05:38
used to be much harder to swallow
05:42
that's i wanted to use this as a main
05:44
fact for the show but bubble wrap was
05:45
not used as bubble wrap it was
05:47
originally designed as wallpaper and
05:48
they for years we're trying to get
05:50
people to buy their futuristic wallpaper
05:53
and no one liked it that sat in an
05:54
office for ages and then suddenly
05:55
someone just went why don't we put it in
05:57
this box and it worked and suddenly
05:59
that's how the industry grew but they
06:00
sat there for years just going what are
06:01
we going to do with that is just popping
06:02
the wallpaper yeah
06:04
this is amazing
06:06
no one getting any work done yeah and
06:09
the 2013 uh they had a thing called the
06:11
diagram prize they have it every year
06:13
and it's for the weirdest book title
06:15
yeah and in that year the prize one was
06:18
won by a book called goblin proofing
06:20
one's chicken coop
06:22
um but what came second or what it beats
06:24
the prize was a book called how to
06:26
sharpen pencils
06:28
it's by david reese and i went on to
06:30
amazon to see if i could buy it and they
06:32
have a deal where people who buy the
06:34
sharpening pencils book also buy pencil
06:37
sharpeners and a set of 12 pencils
06:39
and you can get them all for 45 pounds
06:41
87. that's not bad
06:44
it is that's actually just the shorter
06:46
version of the title of that book so the
06:48
longer version is a practical and
06:49
theoretical tree ties on the artisanal
06:51
craft of pencil sharpening for writers
06:53
artists contractors and flange turners
06:56
and
06:58
it has unbelievably high ratings so it
07:00
has 82 ratings on amazon and more than
07:03
three quarters of them are five-star
07:04
ratings so one rating the top five star
07:06
rating is headed sharp and to the point
07:11
which was nice he also runs the guy who
07:14
wrote it david reese now runs a pencil
07:16
sharpener sharpening business where you
07:18
can send your pencil to him
07:21
and he'll send it back and he will
07:22
sharpen it wrapped in bubble wrap he
07:24
said
07:25
there's a quote from him he says um he
07:28
says i'm sure there's probably somebody
07:30
in india who could sharpen your pencil
07:31
for less but if you want authentic
07:33
american craftsmanship wow
07:37
is it true the thing about them using
07:38
pencils in space uh it's true that they
07:40
did but the thing that isn't true is
07:42
that america spent billions uh making a
07:45
special ballpoint pen and the russians
07:47
just took a pencil actually they all
07:48
just took pencils okay yeah and then and
07:50
then the space pen was developed which
07:52
was at that great pen that you can buy
07:55
commercially now and a really
07:56
interesting thing it was down to that
07:57
pen that both neil armstrong and buzz
07:59
aldrin were able to get off the moon
08:01
because
08:02
yeah no one knows how important this
08:04
actually was
08:05
so as they were on the moon and it was
08:06
time for takeoff they had the ignition
08:08
switch which had to go on to set the
08:10
boosters off to launch back in space and
08:12
as buzz aldrin's flicked it on it broke
08:14
in half and he thought oh
08:16
that's
08:18
i reckon he didn't say uh oh
08:21
whoopsie daisy
08:23
oh
08:25
uh so what he did was he took out his
08:27
pen and he put it into the switch and he
08:29
used that as the switch to get them off
08:31
the moon yeah wow that's amazing i did
08:34
not know that wow
08:36
the world's largest pencil um
08:39
has a 250 pound eraser on the end uh the
08:42
lead is 4 000 pounds in weight and the
08:45
exterior is a perfect yellow hue of
08:47
these typical american yellow pencils
08:49
it's from pennsylvania
08:51
no
08:52
no way
08:53
sorry is it really
08:56
uh the graphite is from pennsylvania
08:58
yeah is it really and i never noticed
09:01
that
09:01
oh my god
09:03
because it's that spelled pencil video
09:06
yeah
09:06
wait did you just notice when you said
09:08
it out loud i noticed it when everyone
09:09
laughed
09:13
it'd be a really cool sort of cartoon
09:15
character of a vampire with pencils for
09:17
teeth from pennsylvania and yeah that'd
09:19
be great
09:21
amazing um they the one problem with
09:23
this massive pencil and that they didn't
09:25
think of well it can't be lifted by any
09:28
human is that the one problem
09:31
there was one more problem they said we
09:34
thought about making the world's largest
09:35
pencil sharpener but we ran out of money
09:38
[Laughter]
09:40
do you know that speaking of um having
09:42
rubbers on them um the guy who
09:44
discovered that rubber could erase
09:47
pencils so before that people used to
09:48
use wet bread didn't they yes bread
09:50
crumbs but the guy who discovered that
09:52
rubber first worried that rubber could
09:54
use to erase pencil um also discovered
09:56
oxygen because it's priestly yeah yeah
09:58
wow and he was the first person to write
10:00
oh by the way this rubber thing i'm
10:01
using to write down all my chemical
10:03
theories is really useful for erasing
10:05
the wrong ones that's amazing yeah the
10:08
guy who thought of first putting a
10:10
rubber on the end of a pencil uh was a
10:12
guy called hyman lippmann
10:15
this what are you laughing at
10:17
well hyman is a perfectly normal name
10:19
absolutely
10:20
uh he this was in 1862 and um he came up
10:24
with this idea put a rubber on a pencil
10:25
brilliant idea uh he sold his patent to
10:28
a guy called joseph rockendorffer for a
10:30
hundred thousand dollars and then
10:32
rockendorff i thought i've got the
10:33
patent now he started suing everyone
10:36
else who was making them um but the
10:38
supreme court of the united states ruled
10:40
against him saying that the patent was
10:42
invalid because actually he was just
10:43
taking two other inventions and sticking
10:45
them together and so he paid a hundred
10:47
thousand pounds for nothing so two
10:48
inventions stuck together doesn't
10:50
constitute a new invention no why
10:52
nothing
10:56
don't get excited about the mousetrap
10:57
remote control anytime
11:02
um okay time for fact number two and
11:04
that is my fact my fact this week is
11:06
drinking alcohol makes you more
11:08
attractive it's something that they
11:10
discovered uh fairly recently that and
11:12
they did this with test studies with
11:13
students so if you drink a glass of
11:15
alcohol it makes your face more
11:17
attractive but then if you drink another
11:19
then you reduce yourself again back to
11:21
no it's yeah so it's basically they say
11:23
that it just relaxes your face a glass
11:25
of alcohol relaxes your face makes you
11:26
seem more sexy and is that you can't see
11:28
me back home but the audience is going
11:30
whoa
11:31
i didn't know captain sexy was in the
11:32
room uh the thing about faces that the
11:34
more relaxed they are the sexier they
11:37
are that's why uh slack drawed people
11:40
are famously gorgeous
11:42
well there are a couple of theories
11:43
aren't there because um it could be that
11:45
um your pupils get larger after a glass
11:48
of wine when people that's a sign of
11:49
attraction so
11:50
you look more attractive if you have
11:51
very large pupils or it could be the the
11:53
other theory is possible that your
11:54
cheeks get a bit rosier and that's the
11:56
sort of sign of uh vitality and health
11:58
and all of this stuff so it is weird
12:00
that it's only one glass of wine though
12:01
i mean i commonly people's physical
12:02
appearance changes that much between one
12:05
glass of wine one glasses of wine and
12:07
i've had too many actually myself
12:09
your glasses are very large though
12:11
[Laughter]
12:14
there was a study done about beer
12:15
goggles as well that they gave people
12:17
alcohol and they asked them to rate
12:19
people's faces and they said it was a
12:21
roughly 10 increase in ratings of
12:23
attractiveness when you got drunk
12:25
compared to when you were sober
12:26
absolutely that was supposedly to prove
12:28
that beer goggles exist there was also a
12:30
study where um people were split into
12:33
four groups so basically this study
12:35
showed that
12:36
people when they're drunk think they're
12:37
more attractive so they're asked to look
12:39
at pictures of themselves or videos of
12:40
themselves and if they're a bit pissed
12:41
they're like yeah i'm really hot but
12:43
people who think they're drunk but
12:44
aren't drunk still think they're more
12:46
attractive
12:47
so they gave people what they said was
12:50
six shots of vodka and then it wasn't
12:52
vodka it was just you know water that
12:53
smells a bit like vodka and then they
12:55
asked them to watch a video of
12:55
themselves and they uprated their
12:57
attractiveness because they obviously
12:59
convinced themselves they were drunk and
13:00
then thought well when i'm drunk i
13:01
become more attractive so isn't that
13:04
interesting it was really cool i mean we
13:06
said that some of the animal um
13:08
experiments were quite cruel but i think
13:10
giving people water and saying it's
13:11
vodka is about as cruel as you can get
13:14
i'd be suing
13:16
six shots is an awful lot isn't it
13:18
oh andy
13:22
who's with me temperance guys
13:26
but what if all alcohol was just
13:27
replaced by placebo alcohol and no one
13:30
told us
13:32
we just have the same it would just be
13:33
exactly the same if we think we're drunk
13:35
when we're not they could just save all
13:37
that money making alcohol yeah just give
13:39
us stuff that smells and tastes a bit
13:40
like alcohol and then you know they've
13:42
been doing it for the last 10 years i
13:43
was part of the committee that decided
13:46
mine is real but you're guys
13:49
there's also a study that showed that
13:50
men rate pictures so yeah we think
13:52
people are more attractive when we're a
13:54
bit drunk um and
13:56
men even rate women more attractively
13:58
when they look at pictures of them when
13:59
they are read alcohol-related words
14:02
no
14:03
if you say the word beer to a man and
14:05
then put a picture of a woman in front
14:06
of him he's like oh yeah she's hotter
14:07
than she was five minutes ago
14:10
so if you felt like you were slightly
14:12
unattractive in life you could just
14:14
rename yourself whiskey or
14:16
hello i'm beer lovely to me junior well
14:19
hello beer lovely to meet you
14:21
really yeah i think that's a really good
14:22
idea my god um i found out about another
14:25
study this is a 2013 study by a group i
14:28
think it was a german scientist it was
14:30
for how to get a bartender's attention
14:33
the results revealed that bastard
14:34
responded to a set of two non-verbal
14:36
signals how exciting what are these
14:38
signals going to be
14:39
first customers position themselves
14:41
directly at the bar counter
14:46
and secondly
14:48
they look at a member of star
14:49
[Laughter]
14:53
because i've been doing it wrong for
14:54
years you've been stunned outside
14:57
looking at a horse
15:00
and so fruit flies use alcohol as
15:02
medicine they are often attacked by
15:04
parasitic wasps who kind of lay eggs in
15:06
them and then eat them from the inside
15:08
when they're born
15:09
but what they can do is they can drink
15:12
loads and loads and loads and loads of
15:13
alcohol and the alcohol kills the wasps
15:16
but it doesn't kill them because they're
15:17
like hard they're not like you andy
15:20
they can take it uh but even better is
15:22
um when they'll even see a parasitic
15:24
wasp they will ply their children with
15:27
alcohol
15:29
to save them as well that's what they're
15:31
telling the social workers is it
15:35
i read another slightly
15:37
interesting science report which is that
15:39
our faces look better from behind so
15:42
apparently when you see someone from
15:44
behind you you picture what their face
15:46
looks like and you project this face
15:48
onto a person and ultimately it's
15:50
usually disappointing when the person
15:51
turns around
15:52
according to scientists
15:54
and
15:55
so they've said the best view for any
15:57
human is from behind of a face yeah um
16:00
also uh i
16:02
found this just quite funny uh you know
16:04
um there's that whole concept of wingman
16:07
frogs invented the idea of wing manning
16:10
so i read this report where apparently
16:12
and they did this test on i think it was
16:13
120 female frogs and a couple of guys
16:16
and so what are the guys
16:18
you mean
16:19
a couple of man frogs yeah and so
16:22
so the man frogs would come into the bar
16:25
and the the like one of the man frogs
16:28
would bring an ugly mate as the
16:30
scientists call it and the ugly mate
16:31
would come in and it'd make the other
16:33
frog look better looking and then all
16:35
the other female frogs are like oh who's
16:36
the good looking
16:37
wow yeah i always take a slug to a bar
16:43
it works pretty badly
16:47
everyone keeps getting off with the slug
16:55
okay it's time for fact number three and
16:57
that is james harkin okay my fact this
16:59
week is that the national giant
17:02
vegetable championships had to move
17:04
venue in the mid-80s as the pumpkins
17:07
started getting too big to fit through
17:08
the doors
17:11
sorry i just find that so funny
17:14
do we know how big the doors were there
17:16
yeah it was a pub it was called the mill
17:18
tavern it's in cumbran uh and so it's a
17:21
proper double swinging doors and um in
17:24
the mid 80s yeah they had to move it and
17:26
and then it moved to the comrade working
17:28
men's club which presumably just had
17:31
bigger doors
17:32
where is cabron sorry it's in south
17:34
wales okay so how big were these
17:36
pumpkins oh well i'm not sure how big
17:39
they were then um the heaviest pumpkin
17:40
in history weighed
17:42
1054 kilograms which is about the same
17:45
weight as a ford fiesta
17:47
but less practical for the commute
17:49
[Laughter]
17:53
just at midnight going this hasn't
17:54
changed at all
17:57
it was grown by benny meyer from
17:59
switzerland and it was according to the
18:00
guinness book of records it was
18:02
authenticated by the great pumpkin
18:04
commonwealth
18:06
i was reading today on pumpkin.com that
18:09
that apparently they this is new thing
18:12
for halloween now whereby people
18:14
actively want ugly looking pumpkins and
18:16
they've been trying to breed out ugly
18:18
looking pumpkins for a very long time
18:20
because anyone buying a pumpkin wants a
18:21
good-looking pumpkin now a sort of warty
18:24
looking disfigured pumpkin uh is all the
18:27
rage and so they actually it's very
18:29
lucrative business at the moment to mess
18:30
up your pumpkins to make him look a bit
18:32
odd
18:33
for one day of the year the ugly warty
18:36
pumpkins are very popular with the
18:38
good-looking pumpkins who take them to
18:40
bars
18:42
no these giant pumpkins they are amazing
18:44
they grow them on pallets as in they put
18:47
a pallet underneath the ground while it
18:48
grows so that once it's got big enough
18:50
they can get a forklift truck down and
18:52
put it under the ground and lift it up
18:54
because otherwise it'll just burst or
18:56
explode i read an account of a guy who
18:58
managed to he he put a forklift truck
19:00
fork through his pumpkin oh my because
19:03
he was taking it to the competition
19:05
disaster
19:08
there's a guy called clive bevin uh he
19:10
grows giant pumpkins and um in 2011 he
19:14
donated some uh to be crushed by a
19:16
monster truck at a charity event and i
19:18
don't think there's a better evening out
19:20
than watching
19:21
a giant truck crush a giant pumpkin yeah
19:24
isn't that amazing and he went to he's
19:26
been he was sort of poached by the
19:27
malaysian government to grow giant
19:29
pumpkins for them um and the ones he
19:31
grew there they're away about 20 stoner
19:32
they have to be moved by helicopter
19:34
there was a study done about how big
19:36
pumpkins can get and they put
19:39
they put a lot of pumpkins in like this
19:41
weird vice instrument and they saw how
19:44
much pressure it could get and they
19:45
worked out that in a perfect world you
19:47
could get a pumpkin that was 20 000
19:50
pounds which is the size of two
19:52
elephants and that's what their skin
19:54
could hold before it would just give up
19:56
that does sound like a perfect world
19:57
james
19:58
[Laughter]
20:03
this is why i never won miss world
20:08
um the longest carrot ever
20:11
was 19 feet long
20:15
and the longest beetroot 21 feet longest
20:17
parsnip ever
20:19
18 feet 5 inches they what they do is
20:21
they grow them in pipes so you get a
20:23
very long pipe and you grow it along
20:24
that um and it's very very hard to get
20:26
them out of the soil without breaking
20:27
them and also you don't know how how
20:29
well you've done until you pick them
20:30
that's the exciting thing wow about
20:32
growing
20:35
so they're like icebergs now they're
20:37
just yeah they continue that's the
20:38
lettuces oh sorry yes
20:44
um do you know who
20:46
grew those because there's one man who's
20:49
held the world records for the largest
20:52
broccoli kale carrot cabbage red cabbage
20:55
celery and beetroot whoa and i don't
20:58
know how he holds down a day job
21:01
but he's called john evans from alaska
21:03
and he's broken all of those records
21:05
alaska alaska is the place to grow giant
21:07
vegetables because in the summer months
21:09
you get 20 hours of sunshine a day and
21:11
so they grow really large because they
21:12
do more photosynthesizing so if you want
21:14
to grow if you want to beat records move
21:16
to alaska it's amazing it started in
21:17
wales which gets about half an hour of
21:19
sunshine a day
21:21
um can i turn the conversation to doors
21:24
so
21:27
it's relevant right
21:31
[Laughter]
21:36
so uh so one thing that i um that i
21:39
found out which i found amazing is that
21:41
we always have the impression that
21:42
people were smaller back in the day
21:43
because of the height of doors yeah you
21:45
would go to old british pubs and the
21:47
doors would be quite low and we thought
21:48
wow everyone was so small back then
21:50
that's not true it's in fact it's that
21:52
it was just doors costs shrunk yeah the
21:54
doors were showing no doors were quite a
21:56
costly material back in the day so why
21:58
would you have a ginormous door in your
22:00
house you would just build something
22:01
quite small that you could get into and
22:03
i guess also if it was smaller it would
22:05
be less heat escaping yes maybe a better
22:08
the revolving door was invented by a man
22:10
who hated holding doors open for women
22:15
really yeah he was called theophilus van
22:18
kennel but the great thing about this
22:20
guy he has a wikipedia page he has loads
22:22
of articles about him in all sorts of
22:24
newspapers but in only one place did i
22:26
find that he had only one arm
22:29
and nowhere else mentions that he only
22:31
had one arm wow you think that'd be the
22:33
first thing right yeah especially since
22:35
it explains his aversion to opening
22:37
doors for people
22:40
actually a conventional door took his
22:42
other arm
22:45
there is a um i have read a manual on
22:48
taxidermy which says
22:50
do not
22:51
make sure the doors of your taxidermy
22:53
workshop are large enough to get out the
22:55
animals that you are because there was
22:57
one guy who had a bad experience with an
22:58
elephant he genuinely
23:00
stuffed an elephant and then could not
23:01
get it out of his workshop how did he
23:03
get it in there i don't know
23:06
i think maybe he raised it in there and
23:08
then killed us
23:13
do you know that the automatic door was
23:15
invented a very long time ago like way
23:18
so we think of it as probably quite a
23:20
modern invention and absolutely the sort
23:22
of modern cause it's electric yeah
23:24
exactly the motion sensor thing where
23:26
you yeah exactly yeah but there's
23:28
evidence that hero heron of alexandria
23:31
actually invented an automatic door
23:33
using pneumatics and using water and so
23:35
on in order to get it open and close he
23:37
was an amazing guy this guy was
23:39
extraordinary he was the guy who
23:40
invented uh he invented the first
23:43
vending machine it was a coin operated
23:45
vending machine he used to teach in the
23:46
libraries of alexandria so this is how
23:48
old it is and the first ever vending
23:49
machine you put a coin in it and it gave
23:51
you some holy water how cool is that
23:53
that's that's what this guy did he was
23:54
like the steve jobs of business no i
23:56
wanted the mars bar
24:01
okay it's time for our final fact of the
24:03
show and that is chozinski yes my fact
24:06
is that the beaded lace wing insects
24:08
incapacitates its prey by farting on it
24:12
um so the beaded lacewing is lace wings
24:14
are those little insects which are
24:16
really understudied hardly anything is
24:17
known about them and they have those
24:19
transparent wings so it's when it's
24:21
fully grown it just is a vegetarian
24:23
vegan
24:24
but as a lava as a baby when it's less
24:26
principled it is
24:29
really carnivorous
24:31
and
24:31
so these larvae go around and they live
24:33
in like termite nests and they go around
24:36
and stun termites with a vapor phase
24:39
toxican which they release from their
24:40
anus the lava raises its anus up in the
24:43
air in the termite's face and excretes
24:46
this scent and the termite feels okay
24:49
for a little bit then it becomes
24:50
immobilized and then within a couple of
24:52
minutes it's kind of fainted and then it
24:54
dies after about three hours and it
24:56
makes it much easier to pull apart and
24:58
eat which is quite an impressive way of
25:01
killing your victims yeah yeah the other
25:03
thing i read is that these lacewing uh
25:05
larvae are 30 times smaller than the
25:08
termites that they're eating wow yeah
25:10
yeah it's a real david and goliath
25:14
situation
25:15
i can't imagine what your bible class
25:17
was like
25:18
[Laughter]
25:20
well and they can incapacitate six
25:22
termites in one fart
25:24
[Music]
25:25
wow so very efficient um on the flip
25:28
side of using something as as a weapon
25:31
uh using your bum as a weapon i read
25:33
about a slug in canada uh careful you
25:35
may be talking about a friend of mine
25:40
so apparently this slug um when it gets
25:43
scared when it gets frightened its bum
25:45
falls off
25:45
[Laughter]
25:51
yeah it's called the canadian blue grey
25:53
tail dropper slug and yeah its palm just
25:57
falls off
25:58
there was a study about whether
26:00
farts contained germs and there are a
26:02
couple of scientists from brisbane to
26:03
study this they asked a colleague to
26:05
break wind over two different petri
26:07
dishes
26:08
firstly fully clothed and then with
26:10
their their pants down and um
26:13
the second one trousers down developed
26:16
kinds of bacteria that that you only
26:18
find in the gut or on or on the skin and
26:20
the clothing filtered one didn't grow
26:21
anything so the conclusion was don't
26:24
fart naked near food that you want to
26:26
eat
26:30
you know everything my dinner party
26:31
strategies
26:34
i'm really sorry about last friday
26:35
evening guys
26:38
our farts human farts travel at seven
26:40
miles per hour on like a good fart like
26:42
like a
26:43
that's about double double walking speed
26:45
isn't it that's why if you've ever tried
26:47
to chase a fart but
26:49
at walking pace yeah you can't catch up
26:51
with it
26:53
so
26:56
someone's parted that way and you've
26:58
gone after it like a greyhound
27:02
yeah i think that's what greyhounds do
27:04
um
27:05
it's so there was a study done that
27:07
looked about how embarrassed people are
27:08
and how little they would like to fart
27:10
in public given this
27:12
circumstances so they were told you
27:13
could either do a silent and not smelly
27:15
fart and most people were like well i'll
27:17
do that one please um and they were like
27:19
the one i least want to do is the really
27:21
loud really disgusting one
27:24
but that's very different to your dinner
27:25
party strategy
27:28
i was an outlier they had to discount me
27:30
from the study
27:32
but people are much more reversed to
27:34
making a noise than doing the smell i
27:36
guess because the noise is more obvious
27:38
that it comes from you but people would
27:40
much rather admit what is actually much
27:42
more unpleasant for everyone else around
27:43
you isn't it because no one minds
27:44
hearing a noise well the interesting
27:46
thing about that is humans can't really
27:47
tell where smells come from it's really
27:49
hard yeah because you smell in like one
27:51
dimension but then there are animals
27:53
that can smell in uh stereo like moles
27:56
and so if you had a mole sat there next
27:58
to you anna it would know exactly where
28:01
the smell came from but it couldn't tell
28:03
anyone that's the tragedy of the mold
28:08
so fats are caused by oligosaccharides
28:11
the little molecules and they're eaten
28:12
by bacteria in your in your gut and the
28:15
bacteria then make tiny little farts
28:17
which turn into human fats so actually a
28:20
human fart is thousands of little tiny
28:22
bacterial farts that's honestly the best
28:24
fact i've ever heard in my life are you
28:26
kidding me
28:28
we have a collection of life farting on
28:30
us that we just release it as one big
28:32
wharf you got it
28:34
so kind of technically means it's never
28:36
really your fault
28:38
exactly you can always blame it on
28:39
someone else yeah
28:41
um the 1956 grand national is quite
28:44
famous there's a horse called devon lock
28:46
and just as it was coming down the final
28:48
straight it was miles ahead and it just
28:50
collapsed on the floor but actually
28:52
according to the head lad of the stable
28:55
he tightened the girth um which is like
28:57
the strapping of the around the belly of
29:00
the horse uh just before the off
29:02
uh he tightened it with one more notch
29:05
and then another one for good luck but
29:07
also the owner of the horse had already
29:09
done exactly the same thing and one
29:11
theory is that the horse that was miles
29:14
in the lead collapsed because it farted
29:16
a massive massive fart
29:19
and then collapsed
29:20
imagine someone doing your belt loops up
29:23
four notches tighter than you're used to
29:26
like i i'm almost breaking wind even
29:28
thinking about that happening
29:32
that poor horse
29:34
okay that's it that's all of our facts
29:36
thank you so much for listening if you'd
29:37

00:13
[Music]
00:14
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:16
no such thing as a fish coming to you
00:19
from the qi offices in covent garden my
00:21
name is anna tashinsky and i'm sitting
00:23
here with anne miller james harkin and
00:26
alex bell and once again we have
00:28
gathered around the microphones with our
00:30
four favorite facts from the last seven
00:32
days and in no particular order here we
00:35
go starting with anne's facts my fact is
00:38
that ruby a sheep who had been
00:40
genetically engineered to glow in the
00:41
dark was accidentally sold to an
00:43
abattoir
00:45
so you would have thought if you've
00:46
genetically engineered a sheep you're
00:48
keeping pretty close tabs on it
00:49
apparently not how did that happen well
00:52
actually it may have been an insider job
00:54
but you're maybe someone with a grudge
00:55
against the company but one of the other
00:57
sheep yeah
00:59
it's very cloak and dagger stuff so this
01:01
is the national institute for
01:03
agricultural research in paris and they
01:05
actually it was um ruby's mother emerald
01:07
was um given this jellyfish gene which
01:10
makes her glue in the dark and then
01:12
emerald had a lamb ruby who had the same
01:14
gene but i'm not sure if it was active
01:15
she actually was gluing but it was
01:16
revealed this year that last year um
01:18
ruby uh yeah made it into the food chain
01:20
and they've been very good through asian
01:22
people they won't risk you ate ruby
01:23
you're all right but somebody did buy
01:25
her someone didn't eat her we are
01:27
constantly making animals glow in the
01:28
dark these days and it's always for
01:30
apparently scientific purposes but i'm
01:32
so suspicious and also it's always
01:34
bloody jellyfish isn't it yeah i think
01:36
sometimes an enemies but usually we just
01:38
seize a jellyfish from the seed take its
01:39
genes out inject them into something
01:41
they must be so fed up with it it's
01:42
because jellyfish have this particular
01:44
protein called gfp which uh stands for
01:47
green fluorescent protein yep
01:50
and they this particular protein when
01:52
you put it into other animals it doesn't
01:54
really have any other effect on the
01:55
animal or hardly anything anyway and so
01:58
it's quite safe there are other animals
01:59
which have these kind of proteins but
02:01
they're not quite as useful really yeah
02:03
they're being used as a marker so they
02:04
can see what happens to the cells they
02:05
use it in stem cell research and
02:07
monitoring well in 2011 scientists
02:09
created kittens which glow in the dark
02:10
in order to help fight aids because
02:12
apparently fiv which is the feline
02:14
immunodeficiency virus is very similar
02:16
to hiv and so it was apparently
02:18
legitimate to make kittens glenn the
02:20
dark i think it's legitimate anyway just
02:21
to do that yeah when we say glow in the
02:23
dark um it does annoy me because it's
02:25
not like you turn the lights off when
02:26
they glow is it you actually have to put
02:28
uv light on them which is so different
02:30
scorpions glow in the dark under uv
02:31
light naturally yeah so they'd be pretty
02:34
cool to take to a nightclub who if you
02:36
want more personal space on the dance
02:37
floor they've got a scorpion here gin
02:39
and tonic also um glows in the dark on
02:41
the uv lights and i know which i'd
02:43
rather have yeah
02:44
yeah yeah um so on sheep they recognize
02:47
each other's faces don't they apparently
02:49
but not when they get here yeah so this
02:51
really confuses me like when they're
02:53
sheared they have to re-establish a
02:54
different hierarchy and fight again to
02:56
be leaders because they don't recognize
02:57
each other but i would have thought if
02:58
you're recognizing faces
03:00
i was just just relatedly i guess i was
03:02
reading this week that in chickens
03:05
or in roosters uh the first chicken to
03:08
go cock-a-doodle-doo in the morning is
03:10
always the most dominant one and if you
03:12
get rid of the most dominant one then it
03:13
will be the second most dominant who
03:15
does the cock-a-doodle doing and sheep
03:16
they so they weren't much clever well i
03:18
guess we said it's about all animals
03:19
that we think are idiots and we revise
03:21
it but sheep are cleverer than people
03:23
give them credit for i think much
03:25
cleverer than you given credit it will
03:27
never happen with dan schreiber
03:29
the exception that proves the rule um so
03:32
they are one of only two animals i think
03:34
who can recognize shapes and remember
03:36
shapes really quickly so they're better
03:37
at monkeys than doing this so if you
03:39
give them like food in different shaped
03:41
buckets and you put food in one bucket
03:43
but not in another then they'll remember
03:45
the right shaped bucket that it's been
03:46
in and then come with other animals
03:48
humans
03:49
the other animals most humans can do
03:51
that again with dan i would question the
03:52
majority of humans the movie predator
03:56
came out in 1987 and the blood of the
03:58
predator is kind of glow in the dark and
04:00
the way they made it was mixing ky jelly
04:03
with green glow stick fluid
04:05
really
04:06
fun trip to the shops for that intern
04:08
yeah
04:11
you would definitely use the um yourself
04:15
yeah
04:16
unexpected items
04:19
uh the fluid is called biz245
04:22
trichlorophenol six carbo pentoxyphenyl
04:26
oxalate
04:31
do you know there's an ice cream company
04:33
called lick me i'm delicious who make a
04:34
glue in the dark ice cream really this
04:36
is the same jellyfish protein um which
04:39
gives off a glow when it touches your
04:40
tongue but it'll cost you about 140 quid
04:42
a scoop so wow maybe we could share one
04:45
rather than one each yeah yeah yeah um
04:47
how do they make it glow do you say uh
04:49
they use the jellyfish oh they should
04:51
have done it in jelly rather than ice
04:52
cream shouldn't they hey
04:54
is maybe that's what jelly is it's just
04:55
jellyfish with their legs pulled off
04:59
that's why it always stings your mouth a
05:00
bit
05:02
nobody else that's why you have to
05:03
urinate on your mouth whenever you've
05:05
eaten jelly
05:07
get wondering why people were always
05:08
doing that to me
05:10
[Applause]
05:12
okay time for fact number two and that
05:15
is alex my fact this week is that during
05:18
the launch of bbc2 in 1964 a live
05:21
kangaroo got stuck in a lift at
05:23
television center and i assume it's tiny
05:25
arms couldn't reach the buttons
05:27
no well there was a massive power cut
05:28
just before they went on air there was a
05:30
fire at bassy power station half of
05:31
london lost power um and the whole night
05:34
was just a massive disaster
05:36
wait what happened to the kangaroo
05:38
uh it was the mascot of bbc2 basically
05:41
so there was a big run-up to this launch
05:43
and the publicity campaign centered
05:45
around a kangaroo with a joey coming out
05:47
of his pouch because it was the second
05:48
channel so the bbc decided to get a live
05:50
kangaroo in as part of the opening night
05:52
it'll probably be w1a i mean it does
05:53
sound like a w1a plot doesn't it it does
05:56
yeah i think bit crazy i mean this is
05:58
all according to the biography of gerald
05:59
priestland who was a bbc news reader the
06:01
uh the first time he delivers his news
06:03
bulletin they get through like two and a
06:05
half minutes and then they realize
06:06
there's no sound going out so he has to
06:07
start again
06:08
and then and then there's lots of
06:10
awkward pauses the phone is sitting on
06:12
his desk and it rings and he picks it up
06:13
and there's no one there is it true that
06:15
the first words that were spoken were a
06:17
news story about a bus conductors who
06:19
had been sacked for insulting pakistani
06:21
passengers and that it included the
06:24
words that she used to insult said
06:25
passengers
06:28
and then the next news story was about
06:30
that last news story also including the
06:32
words they'd used a second news reader
06:35
has been fired for again saying
06:38
didn't they have to cover all their big
06:39
sort of launch events they were going to
06:40
have like kiss me kate songs from the
06:42
musical they were going to have the top
06:43
comedian from the soviet union i think
06:45
all the plans went away and they had to
06:46
end up the first thing they showed
06:47
properly was play school the next day
06:49
the whole evening was just test cards on
06:51
the screen and people apologizing from
06:53
the music i think it's a great bbc
06:54
program i think more and more of that
06:56
um i did this i read this thing about
06:58
there was thing on bbc in earlier it's
07:00
called the toddler truce where there was
07:01
cicada tv was on from five till six and
07:03
then they would have nothing from six to
07:04
seven so i think to say to the kids oh
07:05
look the tv's off you gotta go to bed
07:07
now and so they did not have anything on
07:09
for this hour and they ended in february
07:11
1957 when they brought in a team
07:13
everyone went to
07:14
bed for teenagers called the six five
07:17
special and i just love this opening bit
07:19
because it just sounds so fifties we're
07:20
open with this line welcome aboard six
07:23
five special we've got a hundred cats
07:24
jumping here some real cool characters
07:26
to give us the gas so just get on with
07:27
it and have a ball
07:28
great even then they're out of touch
07:31
these days it would you would think
07:33
there were actual cats though jumping
07:35
yeah yeah i was just gonna sound like a
07:36
precursor to the internet that program
07:37
if you're taking it literally and now
07:38
our troop of dancing feline
07:40
speaking of which there was a channel um
07:42
on um cable in america called the puppy
07:45
channel which was a 24 7 network showing
07:48
nothing but puppies
07:50
this was i think in the 90s or maybe
07:52
2000s and of course it just went out as
07:54
soon as the internet came in you could
07:55
get as many puppies as you want whenever
07:57
you want oh no the sad fate of all the
07:59
porn magazines
08:01
doing their qi facts about the most
08:02
watched channel in most countries is the
08:04
weather forecast
08:05
i have i've read that in uh the
08:08
government meteorology site and i'm not
08:10
to find anywhere else but i decided i
08:11
trust the government um meteorology
08:13
department so they say they do say it
08:15
does say in most countries the weather
08:17
forecast is the most watched program um
08:19
but it's hard to find like what the
08:20
definition of the most watched program
08:21
would be or speaking of most watched i
08:24
reckon the most repeated television
08:25
program ever is on bbc2 qi constant no
08:28
no no no it's not no contrary to what um
08:30
the guinness book of world records says
08:32
and what we said on qy as well so we
08:33
said in series g that it was a short
08:35
film called dinner for one yeah which is
08:37
massive in germany they watch it every
08:38
holiday um and that's approaching i
08:40
think 300 repeats in total but i was
08:42
reading about this thing called trade
08:43
test transmissions which were these
08:45
films broadcast in the early days of
08:46
bbc2 and they were designed to fill the
08:48
channel with nice vibrant varied colors
08:50
which tv manufacturers and retailers
08:52
could use to test their televisions but
08:54
it was they were very popular among
08:55
normal viewers as well and the most
08:56
repeated one is apparently a documentary
08:58
about dam building called the captive
08:59
river this is according to uh the test
09:02
card circle which is a group of
09:03
enthusiasts in early uk television um
09:05
they're really cool i remember don't
09:07
laugh yeah i was gonna ask you the
09:08
president
09:10
in the same way that i don't believe the
09:12
meteorologist that the show is the most
09:14
popular i don't believe you that these
09:16
guys are really cool you have ulterior
09:18
motives alex okay
09:19
um it was this this film according to
09:21
them was repeated almost 550 times over
09:24
12 years partly due to the fact that in
09:26
1963 a huge fan of the film's director
09:29
locked himself in the ops room at the
09:30
bbc and block played the captive river
09:32
until he was rugby tackled to the ground
09:33
and eventually deported
09:37
would you like to hear some early
09:38
alternatives to the word television from
09:40
the 1920s which died out
09:41
telectroscopy visual listening here
09:44
seeing radio movies
09:47
i like visual listening as if they
09:49
didn't have the word watching yeah
09:52
in the 20s what you do with your ears
09:54
but with your eyes there was a big
09:55
discussion as to what they were going to
09:56
call people who watched television as
09:58
well wasn't it like viewers or watchers
09:59
or yeah there were loads of different
10:01
listeners
10:03
um in october 1983 when the email was
10:06
just starting to be a thing um there was
10:09
a two-hour program on the bbc which was
10:12
uh to demonstrate little-known
10:13
technology and it demonstrated the first
10:15
email ever shown on the bbc yeah i know
10:18
it's so weird isn't it so weird um but
10:20
uh before they were transmitting the
10:22
program one of the tech guys shouted the
10:23
password to the email account over to
10:25
someone else this was overheard by two
10:27
sort of coder computery guys and so they
10:29
hacked into the email and so live on tv
10:32
in 1983 the first bbc email said do you
10:35
want a bigger cup
10:38
no what was it what did it say they
10:39
wrote they were called oz
10:41
and they left them a song saying
10:43
try his first wife's maiden name this is
10:46
more than just a game it's real fun
10:48
questionable
10:50
but just the same it's hacking hacking
10:52
hacking
10:53
hacking what a waste of a hack
10:56
the first hd channel in the philippines
10:59
was called bowls
11:00
[Laughter]
11:02
just a fact do you know why it was yeah
11:04
because it was a sports channel london
11:06
live the tv channel
11:08
in its first month on eight separate
11:10
occasions uh its morning tv show was
11:13
broadcast for a full hour to no
11:15
measurable audience
11:18
and in 2010 s4c the
11:21
welsh tv channel um they got zero
11:24
viewers for 196 of the night 890
11:28
programmes oh my god it's not so
11:31
depressing just think all the effort the
11:32
studio
11:34
everyone doing makeup and everything
11:35
were the actual programs were they're
11:36
your test cards on repeat because we've
11:38
seen this one i'm not watching it yet
11:40
again we seem to have a viewership of
11:42
one
11:44
a man in london
11:48
there's over 200 members guys
11:50
speaking of these kind of clubs it just
11:52
reminds me there was a um there was a
11:54
club called i think they're called the
11:56
white dot club
11:58
um i remember this from when i used to
12:00
work uh for a pub company
12:02
and they used to go around trying to
12:04
turn off um tvs in pubs because they
12:07
thought it was anti-social people people
12:09
watching football or whatever and they
12:11
should be talking to each other and they
12:12
would have these like universal remote
12:14
controls and then turn off the football
12:16
when people were watching it um just to
12:18
stop people from watching tv my friend
12:19
had one of those in school and he would
12:20
turn on tv turn on tvs he would turn on
12:23
tvs in the classroom when no one was
12:24
watching he was the opposite of this
12:26
yeah this group i like the alex's idea
12:28
having like a gang of like like rivals
12:29
with the attack we're going back and
12:30
putting them on with their universal
12:32
remix yeah coming back again oh you're
12:34
watching like the world cup semi-final
12:36
on a massive screen and then suddenly
12:37
someone puts on this bbc2 documentary
12:41
guys the test card's back on
12:43
[Applause]
12:46
all right moving on to fact number three
12:48
and that is my fact my fact this week is
12:51
that dr seuss once wrote a warner
12:54
brothers film that was banned because it
12:56
accidentally predicted the manhattan
12:58
project so between 1943 and 1945 the
13:02
british government enlisted warner
13:04
brothers to produce these propaganda
13:05
cartoons which show the adventures of
13:07
this guy called private snafu as in
13:10
snafu which situation normal all effed
13:13
up all left up indeed um and he was just
13:16
this completely cack-handed
13:19
military man captain snafu who kept on
13:21
letting all the military secrets spill
13:23
and messing everything up and yeah there
13:25
was this one film which they wrote and
13:28
it was called going home so snafu takes
13:33
a date to the local cinema and uh this
13:37
this film shows a news flash which says
13:39
u.s secret weapon blasts japs because
13:42
you said that in those days and then
13:45
private snafu leans over to his
13:46
girlfriend and spills all these all
13:48
these secrets about how they were making
13:50
the bomb to her and it was incredibly
13:53
close it sort of completely paralleled
13:55
what the you know americans were working
13:57
on
13:58
do you think what they were worried
14:00
about is that the japanese would see
14:01
this cartoon and think oh my god that's
14:03
what they're going to do
14:04
well i don't know it's a good point
14:06
because they did prevent them from
14:08
making it but yeah what did they fear
14:10
well the japanese really going to think
14:11
i bet if the u.s was going to attack us
14:14
they'd broadcast it in a film a year
14:16
earlier but making a cartoon of it as
14:18
well which is traditionally kind of
14:20
really stupid escapades that would never
14:21
happen in real life it could be a double
14:23
bluff yeah but it must have been
14:25
confusing for the makers who obviously
14:27
had absolutely no idea why they were
14:28
told they're um oh yeah their film
14:30
couldn't get made
14:31
and what i mean the coincidence is
14:33
bizarre when you look at the plotline of
14:34
the film but it was quite interesting
14:35
this project and it involved all the all
14:37
the big shots of hollywood so the voice
14:39
of snafu is mel blanc who obviously is
14:41
um bucks bunny and loads of other warner
14:43
brothers characters and yeah dr seuss
14:45
wrote most of the film shorts so it's
14:48
thought that he almost certainly wrote
14:49
that one uh so and one of the last times
14:51
you were on the podcast you took
14:53
exception to dr seuss dinner yes mm-hmm
14:55
my daughter's daughter
14:57
i've i'm further researched into this
14:58
actually and while it is originally dr
15:00
zoice because that's how he would have
15:02
pronounced it um once it sort of started
15:04
getting bigger in america he apparently
15:05
like sort of let take on the driving
15:07
with zeus to rhyme with goose because it
15:09
was easier for kids yeah and also he
15:11
kind of liked the association with
15:12
mother goose because he was a children's
15:14
writer oh really
15:17
um he wasn't even a real doctor maybe
15:18
that's a bit obvious but he
15:23
said he didn't have a doctorate
15:30
maybe he did a physics degree or
15:31
something like that yeah that's because
15:33
i was picturing you like as a gp when
15:34
you said it
15:35
you're going what's wrong with me i
15:37
cannot tell you but let me tell you all
15:38
right it'll fix it most of the time
15:40
[Laughter]
15:43
right he and a friend invented a thing
15:44
which sounds pretty terrifying called
15:45
the infantrograph that they wanted to
15:47
build for the world for they never
15:48
actually built it but it was a thing to
15:50
you would go with your boyfriend and
15:51
they would show you what your child
15:52
might look like oh i think that sounds
15:54
creepy yeah i swear the internet can
15:56
probably do that kind of thing they do
15:57
yeah yeah yeah you see on facebook don't
15:59
you
16:00
yeah i well maybe maybe my friends have
16:02
actually had children
16:05
james keeps leaving messages to his
16:06
married friends going oh don't do that
16:08
it'll turn out dreadfully
16:10
like you tested it out first
16:12
um so age 14 dr soy seuss he worked for
16:16
the boy scouts and the boy scouts at
16:18
that time were made to or asked to sell
16:20
war bonds to help the war effort and he
16:23
was one of the top 10 sellers in his boy
16:26
scout battalion or whatever they come in
16:28
um and this meant that he got to meet
16:30
the president so teddy roosevelt gave
16:31
out 10 medals to the top 10 sellers of
16:33
war bonds
16:34
but what happened it's so sad teddy
16:36
roosevelt up on stage is calling all
16:37
these boys up and dr zeus was the tenth
16:39
guy there waiting theodore had only been
16:41
given nine medals so he got to medal
16:43
number ten theodore went up on stage in
16:45
front of his parents and all these like
16:46
hundreds and hundreds of people
16:47
applaused and teddy roosevelt just went
16:49
uh what on earth is this boy doing here
16:51
and then the boy scouter jumped on stage
16:53
and dragged him off stage to save
16:54
embarrassment and he said from that
16:56
point onwards he always had a crippling
16:57
fear of public appearances i find it a
16:59
bit weird that the president's reaction
17:01
on saying there are nine medals and 10
17:03
people dressed as boy scouts they would
17:04
assume the 10th person is an imposter
17:07
you sure we haven't got the wrong number
17:08
of medals
17:10
yeah that's a really good point i read
17:12
this recently anna you might know this i
17:15
don't know if it's true or not that
17:16
there are two roosevelts
17:18
but one of them was actually pronounced
17:19
the name roosevelt
17:21
i really really yeah one of the i can't
17:23
remember which is which but one of them
17:25
is let's say franklin d roosevelt and
17:27
the other one is theodore roosevelt all
17:29
the other way around i can't remember
17:31
why because they're obviously you know
17:32
they're obviously related so why would
17:33
they have changed it i believe it's like
17:35
different branches of the family and
17:36
this branch of the family called
17:38
themselves roosevelt and this branch
17:39
called themselves roosevelt i've not
17:41
looked it up
17:42
[Laughter]
17:46
so this um this movie this movie that
17:49
you're talking about is it true that
17:50
we're not 100 sure that it definitely
17:52
was
17:53
dr seuss who wrote it as in there was no
17:55
credits or anything yeah no credits they
17:57
didn't ever credit them
18:01
most of them apparently were written by
18:03
him but the reason we think this
18:04
particularly is because of the uh meter
18:07
of the lines
18:08
because it sounds like a lot of his kind
18:10
of stuff it's called um anapestic
18:13
tetrameter and it's it goes
18:20
green accident
18:22
and it rhymes
18:23
but apparently um this is that kind of
18:25
meter and he always wrote in that kind
18:27
of meter other people apparently
18:28
according to wikipedia who have this
18:30
meter include um byron's uh don juan
18:34
apparently that has it and also eminem
18:37
in um the way i am
18:42
that's a nice link isn't it like
18:45
carving a path from byron to dr zeus
18:47
hundred years later to eminem a hundred
18:48
years later yeah really like that um dr
18:51
seuss in 1931 uh illustrated a book
18:55
called the pocket book of boners
18:58
was it a pop-up
19:01
what sort of boners uh boners in those
19:03
days meant like a mistake like a a
19:06
blooper kind of thing yeah it still does
19:08
doesn't it sort of i mean no i wouldn't
19:10
google it
19:13
[Applause]
19:16
okay time for our final fact and that is
19:19
from james my fact is that the phrase
19:22
why is my poop green
19:24
is googled most commonly between five
19:27
and six in the morning oh god i thought
19:30
i raised my history
19:33
at what time
19:34
between five and six am
19:36
so this comes from an article in the new
19:38
york times by a guy called seth stevens
19:41
davidovich uh and it's just a brilliant
19:44
article with loads of times when it's
19:46
most likely that people google things
19:48
what i don't mean by that is this is
19:50
when it's most often it's more common
19:52
for people to google it at that time
19:54
than it is for them to google it at any
19:55
other time so the percentage of people
19:57
searching google for the word lonely
19:59
peaks at 3 24 a.m well they're all doing
20:03
it at the same time so we need to bring
20:04
them together yeah so you're actually
20:05
the least if you're feeling lonely
20:06
that's when you're actually least lonely
20:07
because everyone is feeling it too they
20:09
should have an i'm feeling lonely but
20:10
next thing i'm thinking lucky button
20:11
they should pair you up with a random
20:12
person that's called chat roulette
20:16
[Laughter]
20:18
and the phrase how to put on a condom
20:20
peaks at 10 28 p.m yeah i love that
20:23
because
20:24
that's really sweet that people are
20:26
doing that because before we had to have
20:28
like really awkward lessons in year 9
20:29
with our english teachers who told us i
20:31
think it's better that you get to ask
20:32
dude
20:33
you should have been the sex ed teachers
20:34
really they always doubled up they were
20:36
very similar actually we had our
20:37
guidance teachers i think yeah and bring
20:39
hockey sticks in two hockey sticks no
20:42
expectations were very high
20:44
yeah
20:46
and bent at the end yep
20:49
um actually this is slightly on topic
20:50
but speaking of you know girl boy
20:52
differences i was at a pub quiz this
20:53
week and there was a picture quiz and
20:55
one of the pictures was what brand is
20:57
this joe brand or russell brand all
20:59
right yeah good one yeah so you would
21:01
have given the funny answer and not got
21:02
a point uh the brand was a picture of a
21:05
tampax packet with everything on it
21:07
except the word tampax and i was on a
21:09
team with three boys and they were all
21:10
looking at going i've never seen that
21:12
before actually i really think once you
21:14
said that the reason why some men will
21:16
go to the fridge and say i can't find
21:17
the cheese and you have to go and say
21:19
it's right there it's because a man's
21:21
praise more like to look for if you're
21:22
looking for cheese looking for
21:23
c-h-e-e-s-e and so the cheese is upside
21:25
down or on the side
21:30
if you want to hide from a man stand on
21:32
your head
21:34
if you shave men they can't recognize
21:36
each other
21:37
and then they have to fight to see who's
21:39
the best
21:42
that is that is quite something also i
21:45
must say of all the cheese that i buy
21:47
usually it's not labeled with the
21:48
massive word cheese
21:51
again we're not in a cartoon
21:54
the first google computer the first
21:56
database they built uh a computer
21:58
housing for it with fans and a cooling
22:00
system out of lego
22:01
okay you can see a picture of it so
22:03
they've got they've still got it in like
22:04
you know a glass display case and it's
22:06
all multi-colored so it kind of looks
22:07
like the google logo the word google is
22:09
an anagram for go
22:13
oh my god
22:15
um i had a look at other sort of clever
22:18
internet things you can track so there's
22:19
this guy called steve worswick who has
22:21
built a chat bot called the mitsuki so
22:24
mitsuki works by you ask her a question
22:26
and then she has someone talks to her
22:28
she learns appropriate responses and she
22:29
can switch things and try to think of a
22:30
good thing to say back to you so i asked
22:32
if she knew any facts so it might be a
22:33
good shortcut
22:35
now we're all out of a job
22:37
she told me that butterflies taste with
22:38
their feet oh yeah that's kind of one of
22:40
our books and this movie she's read them
22:42
and the cats can hear ultrasound so that
22:44
was quite good yeah and i tried to teach
22:45
her a new fact that bananas are slightly
22:47
radioactive she said what makes you say
22:49
that
22:50
i said oh never mind then we
22:52
tried we tried a little longer but what
22:56
i like is that obviously i was using it
22:58
to try and do my work with people
22:59
probably using it as an online
23:00
girlfriend let's be honest and so i said
23:03
shall we try again me and teach me the
23:04
facts she said once more do you mean you
23:07
and me it may require alteration in my
23:09
personality i said no no i meant the
23:11
fact about bananas
23:12
it is very fun i recommend you all try
23:14
out mitsuki come to facts about what
23:16
happens when you google something so if
23:18
you google something now that's one of
23:20
3.5 billion things that people google
23:22
every day
23:24
20 of those things have never been
23:26
google before that is interesting alex
23:27
but why is my poop green
23:30
it would be 40 but you keep asking that
23:33
um then your query takes 0.2 seconds to
23:36
go 1.5 000 miles and go through a
23:39
thousand computers to get your results i
23:41
just find that completely mindful yeah
23:43
like we have access to those incredible
23:44
resources these are um
23:47
so easy but they are amusing you know
23:49
the old google autofill when people send
23:51
in their uh google autofills for them uh
23:54
just a couple of my favorite ones so um
23:57
someone typed in is it n letter n and
24:00
the suggestion is is it normal for my
24:01
left nipple to be bigger than my other
24:03
two
24:05
someone typed in to google if i and the
24:08
letter a and the suggestion the first
24:10
suggestion was if i ate myself would i
24:12
be twice as big or completely disappear
24:15
wow that's good it's really good isn't
24:17
it yeah nobody knows someone typed in my
24:21
and then the letter b
24:22
and the suggestion goofer suggestion
24:24
from google is
24:25
my balls are stuck in my xbox
24:29
and my ex is not happy
24:32
[Applause]
24:35
[Music]
24:36

[Applause]
00:12
hello
00:13
and welcome to another episode of no
00:16
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:18
this week coming to you live from up the
00:20
creek comedy club in greenwich london my
00:23
name is dan schreiber i'm joined by the
00:25
three regular elves please welcome to
00:27
the stage andy murray anna chazinski and
00:29
james harkin
00:30
[Applause]
00:46
and once again we have gathered around
00:48
the microphones with our four favorite
00:49
facts from the last seven days and in a
00:51
particular order here we go
00:54
starting with me
00:55
my fact this week is that in winter
00:59
we should all wear our socks outside our
01:01
shoes
01:08
right because
01:11
and this is this is science that says we
01:13
should do this oh mr science yeah this
01:16
is a really interesting thing it was a
01:17
thing that they did in new zealand what
01:18
they did was uh in new zealand they they
01:21
were saying that okay people keep
01:22
slipping over how do we fix this and
01:24
someone has worked out if you wear your
01:26
socks outside of your shoes it gives you
01:28
incredible grip which means you will
01:30
never slip on ice so in winter time in
01:33
london where we're recording this or if
01:34
you're overseas and you get winter and
01:35
you get all the icy floor
01:37
take your socks off or get in get a
01:40
second pair and put them outside your
01:42
shoes
01:43
treat yourself
01:48
but yeah so uh it's a really interesting
01:50
study i read the study i think it won or
01:53
it's been reported by the ignobel people
01:56
it might have won an egg nobel prize and
01:58
i read the report and they said although
02:01
participants in the intervention group
02:02
were told they could keep their socks
02:05
many who appear to have image issues
02:09
opted to return them
02:11
including one young man who probably
02:13
fell on leaving the assessment area
02:15
[Applause]
02:20
amazing um have any of you guys seen the
02:22
video posted by alan anderson online and
02:26
it's him he's a father
02:28
of a girl who goes to school and he goes
02:31
to pick up his child from school and he
02:33
spends six full minutes filming people
02:36
slipping over does anyone see that
02:38
they all like children yeah yeah they're
02:40
all children
02:45
and it is extraordinary the regularity
02:47
with which they slip over there's this
02:48
corner of pavement and every single
02:50
child that walks around it falls flat on
02:52
their ass or their face or their head
02:54
whatever
02:55
was he out there before he set up the
02:57
camera pouring cold water
02:59
on the pavement you don't want to waste
03:01
a morning shooting as well
03:04
it also shows his good fathering skills
03:05
because at one about half about three
03:07
minutes into the video when he's filmed
03:08
about it you know 55 children falling
03:10
over um his daughter leaves school and
03:12
turns up at the car and he's like i'm
03:14
not gonna go yet watch this
03:16
honestly it's another three minutes from
03:19
him and his nine-year-old daughter going
03:20
yeah that is hilarious
03:22
[Laughter]
03:24
so good you should watch it
03:26
the um the thing about the socks going
03:28
over your shoes it doesn't work
03:29
apparently if the socks are wet and
03:31
obviously if you're walking on
03:33
snow or ice
03:35
they will be soon so
03:37
just speaking of kids um it's
03:39
interesting that i think it is a new
03:40
zealand thing that they have recognized
03:42
as just a local thing that people do
03:44
they know to wear socks outside their
03:46
shoes because in 1989 two researchers
03:49
extracted
03:51
extracted gossip from a group of young
03:53
seven to 11 year olds that sounds really
03:54
sinister would you
03:57
now that i read it again
04:00
just a single needle
04:06
so these these were um i i i'm corrected
04:10
rereading my sentence it wasn't in new
04:12
zealand it was american school children
04:13
oh well that's all right
04:16
and they asked each uh child to discuss
04:18
the reputations of each of their
04:20
classmates and this is what they said um
04:22
some of them were warning signs of
04:24
weirdness apparently it said eats like a
04:26
pig that's one thing they would say
04:27
bang's head on desk sounds like a car
04:30
[Laughter]
04:33
fidgety acts like a monster wears socks
04:36
over shoes
04:38
ah sensible they should have said that
04:40
after that bracket's sensible
04:43
sound sounds like a car sounds like a
04:45
car
04:47
was that all one guy
04:48
[Laughter]
04:50
[Music]
04:52
what would everyone slipping he's going
04:53
past
04:54
[Laughter]
04:55
[Music]
04:58
um do you know that they wear over socks
05:00
in pro cycling sometimes really yeah
05:03
wearing socks over your shoes is a thing
05:04
in cycling really yeah
05:07
well in the spring when they're racing
05:08
it gets really kind of grotty and muddy
05:10
and whatever and they have these really
05:12
lightweight shoes and and the idea is
05:14
you put your socks over it and it won't
05:16
damage the shoes
05:17
that's good
05:19
but
05:22
but the shoes aren't on the ground
05:24
[Laughter]
05:30
you're you're a much better cyclist than
05:32
i am
05:35
um yeah no it gets muddy and it kind of
05:37
splashes up and you know and there was i
05:39
saw an faq on a cycling website and they
05:42
the question was
05:44
what is the point of wearing socks over
05:46
your shoes and the answer was
05:49
experiencing the thrill of having
05:51
non-cyclists within earshot
05:53
impertinently observing that you have
05:55
forgotten your shoes
05:58
or that you have put them and your socks
06:00
on in the wrong order
06:02
that does sound worth it
06:05
um there is something you can do if
06:07
you're not into the socks over shoes
06:09
look
06:10
the canadian researchers have uh
06:12
discovered recently which they've
06:13
developed a new material where you
06:14
implant glass fibers into shoes and
06:17
they're selling these shoes where these
06:19
little shards of glass act as these tiny
06:21
spikes um but that sounds very very safe
06:25
i think that i mean it's not just a kid
06:27
at home jabbing broken wine bottle up
06:29
into his own trainers
06:33
we've all been there
06:37
the uh
06:38
i like this so it was casually reported
06:40
in new scientists the researchers who
06:42
tested this material
06:44
had did it in a floating lab which was
06:46
casually referred to as a floating lab
06:48
is a lab that gets hoisted into the air
06:50
and then tilted at whatever sloping tilt
06:53
or whatever gradient you want to tilt it
06:54
to so that's how they test these kind of
06:56
things is you just hoist this whole
06:57
laboratory up and then you get people to
06:59
wear these ice ice shoes glass shoes
07:02
that's amazing and you told it i think
07:03
that's so cool yeah floating labs
07:07
just genuinely interesting
07:10
here's something that's not that
07:11
interesting oh yeah please
07:13
i am i thought i'd look into sock
07:15
puppets oh yeah um so i went onto
07:17
wikipedia and um wikipedia says that a
07:20
sock puppet is a puppet made from a sock
07:23
or similar garment
07:25
[Music]
07:26
and i would argue that something made
07:28
from something that's not a sock really
07:30
isn't a sock puppet
07:31
you've got sock puppets that are made of
07:33
socks you've got glove puppets which are
07:34
made of gloves you've got finger puppets
07:36
obviously which are made of fingers
07:37
[Laughter]
07:41
i think they're creepy though
07:48
[Music]
07:54
andy approaches every normal human take
07:56
off those finger puppets
07:59
show me your true hand
08:01
[Laughter]
08:06
um i i got told on the way here by um
08:09
alex bell who always appears on our
08:11
podcast um i got told that so i mean
08:13
just on because we were talking on the
08:15
way over here about how um when you do
08:17
slip on ice obviously you can you can
08:18
break your ankle you can hurt yourself
08:20
really badly and he told me that um
08:22
during the filming of the movie troy
08:25
the filming was actually delayed because
08:27
brad pitt who was playing achilles
08:30
injured his achilles here
08:32
[Applause]
08:36
no yeah true fact
08:38
true fact that i didn't google i just
08:40
believed it
08:46
um so i read an article in the
08:47
independent from 1993
08:50
which opened
08:51
congratulations to the several hundred
08:53
readers who wrote in with creative
08:56
suggestions for using an odd sock
08:59
so this is obviously a competition they
09:00
were running
09:03
and
09:04
it said
09:05
this list which is by no means
09:06
exhaustive will be put to good use and
09:09
suggestions for using an odd stock and
09:11
it is they are good suggestions they
09:13
include with suitable holes as a coat or
09:16
balaclava for a furry animal
09:25
that's the best bank ice you've ever
09:27
seen
09:30
um
09:31
frozen if a sock is frozen use it as a
09:33
boomerang
09:35
because i guess
09:36
the heel it has that shape
09:39
if it's unfrozen as a bag for a
09:41
boomerang
09:43
[Applause]
09:45
[Laughter]
09:51
um we should move on to a second fact
09:53
very soon
09:55
i'm sorry
09:57
well what else what else you guys the
09:59
original fact was about uh snow and ice
10:01
yeah and uh just this is just something
10:03
i found interesting you can start a fire
10:05
using ice
10:06
pretty cool if you carve a piece of ice
10:09
into a lens and you focus the sun's rays
10:11
through it
10:12
you can start a fire in a few seconds
10:15
wow how cool is that
10:16
and you need the tools to chip away at a
10:18
chunk of ice but you can do it and so
10:20
you've seen it being done there that
10:21
sentence could have read you can turn
10:23
your child into a
10:26
car
10:28
well you could do that with most things
10:30
presumably right you can't focus the
10:31
rays of the sun through a child
10:37
well then my experiments have been all
10:38
invaded
10:45
should we move on yeah let's move on
10:46
okay it is time for fact number two and
10:49
that is andrew hunter murray my fact
10:52
this week is that ancient jerusalem's
10:53
lost property office just involved
10:55
shouting about what you had lost in the
10:56
hope that somebody had found it
11:01
so well really yeah um so there's um
11:04
they've just found in the the ruins of
11:06
ancient jerusalem a particular podium
11:08
and there are a couple of theories about
11:10
its use one is that it was a sort of
11:11
speaker's corner and the other is that
11:13
it was a lost property office because
11:16
there are a couple of ancient jewish
11:17
texts which mention a stone of claims
11:20
and that's where you would go if you
11:21
lost something and the idea is that you
11:24
would tell an announcer and then he
11:25
would shout out to the crowd and see if
11:27
anyone had found anything
11:29
that was like that and that was how you
11:30
were reunited with your lost stuff in
11:32
ancient jerusalem i just think that's
11:34
the best idea ever yeah that's amazing
11:36
well you kind of need everyone in the
11:38
country to be stood around the guy at
11:40
the time it's not really going to work
11:42
in london is it that's the floor uh it's
11:44
never been tried in london oh yeah yeah
11:46
um we've just found this out as well
11:47
right yeah so they've just found the
11:49
podium and so they're trying to work out
11:50
what it was for so this is one of the
11:52
theories yeah is that the whaling wall
11:54
is in jerusalem isn't it is that
11:57
i don't think that was originally a lost
11:59
property
12:00
[Laughter]
12:02
i mean are we definitely sure about that
12:04
feeling it is a bit like town criers i
12:07
think you know oh yeah oh yeah someone's
12:10
lost their socks or whatever that
12:12
probably happened in the olden days sure
12:14
uh in uh goslight in germany they had a
12:17
town crier who was employed to remind
12:19
the local pot place not to urinate or
12:21
defecate into the river the day before
12:24
the water was drawn for brewing beer
12:28
which i think we can all agree is a very
12:30
useful job
12:34
there was a town cri there was a town
12:36
crier called keith jackman of
12:37
christchurch and he has been deafened by
12:40
the sound of his own bell
12:41
[Laughter]
12:44
he's been he's been doing the oh yeah
12:46
for 25 years and now he's gone death
12:49
that's really sad it is isn't it
12:51
he should have won um those headphones
12:52
the earmuffs that builders were yeah he
12:54
should have done
12:58
what an idiot
13:00
it's the absolute worst kind of tinnitus
13:02
isn't it though it's just like
13:03
[Music]
13:05
do you remember the guy i
13:07
i haven't i can't remember his name but
13:08
uh when prince george was born was
13:11
announced by town crier and everyone was
13:13
like oh this is fantastically old school
13:14
this is wonderful and it turns out it
13:16
was just a guy who just decided to
13:18
arrive and announce it and he is a town
13:20
crier but in a very different town to
13:22
where it was being announced and he just
13:24
walked up it here
13:26
and he announced it and everyone's like
13:27
oh this is so nice and the royal family
13:29
were going who the hell is this guy
13:32
do you remember that i hope he drove
13:34
down all the way saying i've got to tell
13:36
them
13:36
[Music]
13:37
how else will they know
13:41
the bells next to him in the car with a
13:42
little seat belt on it
13:43
[Laughter]
13:45
just you and me this time glenda
13:52
um
13:53
the town choir championships i just
13:55
think this is so amazing that these kind
13:57
of things have their budget for this
13:59
i've been there once what
14:02
did not place
14:09
[Music]
14:10
[Laughter]
14:12
what do you know where they were held
14:14
the last ones um the one i went to was
14:16
in either lancashire or yorkshire i
14:18
can't remember cool the last one was in
14:19
bermuda so i feel like
14:22
do you ever get the feeling you chose
14:23
the wrong year
14:26
i mean who is paying for town car is
14:28
good anyway this year it's the first
14:30
time a brit has won the town crowd
14:32
championship which is very exciting mark
14:34
wiley uh beat off 24 other kids
14:40
and they were like
14:41
oh yay
14:47
[Applause]
14:51
[Laughter]
14:53
it's one of the requirements these
14:56
days actually said for legal reasons we
15:00
have to correct that
15:03
sorry yeah so this guy um won
15:07
over and above 24 other
15:10
contestants um
15:12
what he won was an awful lot of rum he
15:15
said
15:16
which i needed for medicinal purposes he
15:18
explained which is understandable after
15:20
the trauma he'd undergo
15:22
[Applause]
15:36
yes
15:37
i've got stuff on lost and found
15:41
um
15:42
this story is uh this is from the bbc
15:45
news website for berkshire in 2011. uh a
15:49
mother has praised reading buses for
15:50
finding and returning her son's sausage
15:52
casserole
15:58
her son's sausage casserole after here
16:00
[Laughter]
16:03
after he left it on a bus
16:08
[Laughter]
16:13
okay i'll carry on
16:16
carry on suzanne stout sent an email via
16:18
social media network site facebook
16:22
to thank staff at the bus company for
16:24
saving her family's dinner
16:26
the sausage casserole which was made by
16:28
her son in his food technology class at
16:30
school ended up in lost property
16:32
the casserole was retrieved by mrs stout
16:35
and eaton
16:36
having taken an unscheduled route around
16:38
west reading
16:41
[Laughter]
16:48
which for my money is the greatest story
16:50
ever
16:53
there was the guy who did you read tfl
16:55
published a couple of years ago a list
16:57
of the most interesting stuff they've
16:59
had in their lost property that's been
17:00
claimed or not claimed
17:02
one of which was so the most one of the
17:04
most common items to have in hospitality
17:05
is false teeth which is weird anyway uh
17:08
people i don't know relax take them out
17:10
and leave them there anyway a man came
17:11
back claimed his false teeth uh took
17:14
them away and then returned a few hours
17:16
later grimacing saying actually these
17:19
aren't mine
17:19
[Applause]
17:21
[Laughter]
17:24
you know that um kent police are now
17:26
saying that they're no longer accepting
17:28
lost property items yeah and that yeah
17:30
yeah so if you if you bring them a lost
17:32
property item they say take it to
17:33
facebook or twitter and you now have to
17:36
tweet or facebook the lost property item
17:38
oh yeah they no longer do which really
17:39
messes around with the law on lost
17:40
property because you're meant to take
17:42
reasonable steps to return it to its
17:43
owner and if you go to the police and
17:45
then several weeks pass and they haven't
17:48
reunited it with its owner then you have
17:49
the best claim on it after the owner you
17:51
are because you found it uh so i don't
17:53
know how it works in the age of uh doing
17:55
it on social media if that's what
17:57
qualifies as a reasonable effort yeah
18:00
and very quickly there's a thing the
18:02
code of hammurabi is the oldest legal
18:03
code we have and it has a section on
18:06
lost property um so if somebody finds
18:08
something he's lost in the possession of
18:11
another man right and the person who
18:14
owned has it now bought it from a
18:15
salesman
18:16
and they've both got witnesses that they
18:18
bought it honestly and that they owned
18:20
it before then since the seller was the
18:22
thief he should be put to death
18:25
[Laughter]
18:28
if the man who was found with the
18:29
property couldn't produce the seller to
18:31
make the sale but the original owner did
18:33
have witnesses then since the professed
18:35
purchaser was a thief he should be put
18:36
to death
18:38
finally
18:41
i think you know where this is going
18:44
if you could not produce witnesses
18:45
proving that you in fact owned it before
18:47
it was found in the possession of the
18:49
other guy since he was a cheat and
18:50
stated a false report he shall be put to
18:52
death
18:54
there's no there's no there's no scaling
18:57
down in this last property
19:01
we need to move on okay it is time for
19:03
our next fact and that is chozinski yes
19:07
my fact is that the man who discovered
19:10
why we sweat did so by getting in a
19:12
sauna with a dog a steak and an egg
19:17
and this
19:21
and then it just came to him
19:25
i think you're going to have to explain
19:26
ella so this is this guy called charles
19:28
blagson who not very much has written
19:31
about and uh so he was a british
19:33
physician in the late 18th century um
19:36
and he was invited actually to
19:38
uh you know by other scientists to get
19:40
into their sauna and find out why we
19:42
sweat and he decided when he persuaded a
19:44
whole bunch of friends to come in with
19:45
him um and he subjected himself to
19:47
ridiculous temperatures so um in in 1775
19:52
he went up to 127 degrees celsius so way
19:55
above boiling point um sitting in the
19:57
corner was found he was able to sit
19:59
there he was in one naked from the waist
20:02
up and others he had to wear clothes but
20:03
otherwise your
20:05
skin singes were there anywhere he was
20:07
naked from the waist down
20:09
the dog's looking worried
20:12
um but yeah so there was a thought that
20:15
how could he possibly have survived this
20:17
because people didn't know that humans
20:18
could thermoregulate like we know we can
20:20
now so how could we possibly survive
20:22
being 127 degrees celsius um so there
20:24
was an idea that the thermometer must be
20:26
wrong so rather than get like a few
20:28
thermometers in there to you know
20:30
controls um he invited in his dog and an
20:33
egg and mistake and nature's thermometer
20:36
[Laughter]
20:42
and he found that
20:44
the egg cooked extremely fast the steak
20:47
cooks um even almost even faster so that
20:50
when you guys and the dog
20:54
25 minutes a gas market
20:57
no the dog is fine because animals can
20:59
thermally regulate but um the way when
21:01
you read his write-up of it it reads a
21:02
bit like a cooking a cookery book uh
21:04
because it's mainly seems to be focused
21:06
on how well cooked the steak is
21:09
he's sitting in there you know like 150
21:12
degrees c um he says we put eggs and
21:14
beef steak in there after 20 minutes uh
21:17
the eggs were taken out roasted quite
21:19
hard in 47 minutes the steak was not
21:21
only dressed but almost dry another beef
21:24
steak was rather overdone in in 33
21:27
minutes
21:29
and then in the evening he explained you
21:30
could cook the steak even faster by
21:32
using bellows to blow the hot air onto
21:34
it and he explained the the greatest
21:36
part of the steak was pretty well done
21:37
within 13 minutes
21:39
so he's either telling you how to cook
21:41
steak well or he's explaining that
21:43
humans can thermoregulate and in a way
21:45
that steak can't
21:48
so yeah this this this is how he
21:50
discovered that by sweating we are able
21:52
to not boil to death when temperatures
21:55
reach i guess this guy today is most
21:57
famous for blagdon's law um which is the
22:00
idea that if you put salt in water it
22:02
takes longer to boil
22:03
yes that's what he's famous for is that
22:05
do they use that in freezing on the
22:07
roads is it the same principle it's kind
22:08
of the same principle yeah she put salt
22:10
in um then ice doesn't form as yeah it's
22:13
similar to that it's similar to when
22:15
people put um salt into water to like
22:18
boil pasta or something they think that
22:20
the temperature will boil lower but
22:22
actually that's not really true
22:23
you could put as much salt as you want
22:25
like a hell of a lot of salt into a bowl
22:27
of pasta and it would change the boiling
22:29
point by four hundredths of a degree
22:32
because they really make much difference
22:34
but um i read the article on him in the
22:36
dictionary of national biography
22:39
and dr johnson who wrote the dictionary
22:41
um said that he was a delightful fellow
22:43
this guy
22:44
but there was another guy called count
22:46
rumford who didn't really like him as
22:47
much because blagdon um had fought
22:50
against him for the hand of um
22:53
lavoisier's wife
22:55
so antoine lavoisier who um he was a
22:57
person who there was an idea that people
22:59
thought that um when things burned there
23:02
was a element called phlogiston and this
23:04
was the element that allowed things to
23:06
burn um and then he died and then his
23:08
wife married um this guy called
23:11
count rumford and weirdly he is the
23:13
person who disproved that something
23:16
called caloric
23:17
which was another element which was what
23:19
happened when things heated up um
23:21
happened so she was married to the guy
23:24
who disproved flajistan which was a fake
23:27
element for burning and then was married
23:29
to a guy who disproved caloric which was
23:32
the fake element for warming things up
23:34
wow that is really interesting but not
23:37
funny she was nice
23:40
she had a very niche taste
23:44
bizarrely i have a fact about dr johnson
23:46
and sweat great
23:48
so in dr johnson's dictionary uh the
23:50
word swelt as in swelter these days but
23:53
the definition for the word swelt is
23:56
to puff in sweat if that be the meaning
24:02
which i decide
24:04
writer of the dictionary
24:06
so it'd be the meaning
24:07
[Laughter]
24:09
um i was i was so the fact is about why
24:12
don't people cook effectively uh when
24:15
they're in a sauna because that's what
24:16
he was trying to find out well that's i
24:18
mean that's slightly what he was trying
24:19
to find out it's it's um okay it wasn't
24:22
what he was trying to find out uh
24:24
i have misresearched this fact no it was
24:26
more about how steaks do cook in human
24:29
yeah exactly humans how can you how can
24:31
you get this kind of heat and with the
24:32
dog it was the the tongue that was
24:34
panting that allowed for it to regulate
24:37
its heat
24:38
i feel like we have to explain why that
24:39
was confusing maybe to some people and
24:41
you why when you say why don't people
24:42
cook you mean why don't people
24:44
themselves oh cook when they're in the
24:46
hospital it's not why don't people enter
24:47
a sauna to make a fry up or a rose
24:49
dinner yes
24:51
that's yeah that's so i i googled um how
24:55
hot can a human get and
24:58
did my photo come up
25:08
well there were a lot of there were a
25:09
lot of really interesting articles like
25:11
it looked like they were
25:15
they look like there were good answers
25:16
to the question but i got really
25:17
distracted because you know when you
25:19
google something
25:23
james naked from the waist down
25:28
though so when you when you google
25:30
something at the very bottom when you
25:32
scroll down it says related searches
25:35
you know when you see that yeah and then
25:36
it gives you a new sentence you can so i
25:39
googled how hot can a human get and the
25:41
related search that i got was can a
25:44
human get a dog pregnant
25:51
[Applause]
25:52
and i really want to do research for
25:54
tonight and the fact that that is
25:56
charles blagdon discovered two things in
25:58
that sauna
26:02
the answer to the second was no
26:06
well that's a thing can you get a dog
26:07
pregnant was that someone is that a lot
26:09
of people typing that out of curiosity
26:11
or are they worried
26:19
it didn't say
26:21
but it is interesting that all dogs can
26:23
mate successfully with all other dogs
26:24
that is true isn't it yeah yeah i just
26:26
find that amazing
26:31
but literally like a tiny chihuahua can
26:33
mate with a massive great name yeah
26:36
and make a new dog right
26:39
that's the point of it
26:40
[Laughter]
26:48
oh we've got a lot of explaining to do
26:49
once the show's over
26:51
[Laughter]
27:01
do you know in finland there's a sauna
27:03
elf
27:06
so we've spoken about this on the
27:07
podcast before um finland loves saunas
27:11
like crazy their parliament has a sauna
27:13
and a lot of very big moments have
27:15
happened in a sauna when they've been
27:17
negotiating they'll go let's go to the
27:19
sauna and they'll set it out until they
27:20
decide um but
27:22
part of their their there's an
27:24
equivalent of the boogeyman in finland
27:26
which is the sauna elf and he's called
27:29
sonatantu and um i'm sure in a different
27:32
accent and sona tonto uh basically if
27:36
you're naughty in a in a sauna he'll uh
27:39
he'll burn it down and kill everyone
27:43
[Laughter]
27:48
um
27:49
[Music]
27:50
[Laughter]
27:57
coming
27:58
to the town
28:01
and he's burning the sauna down
28:07
he made that rhyme that's very good
28:10
[Laughter]
28:11
um
28:12
we're gonna have to move on to our final
28:14
fact
28:15
okay time for our final fact and that is
28:18
james okay my fact this week is that
28:20
stick insect sex can last for 79 days
28:26
and the insects are stuck together the
28:28
whole time
28:30
wow
28:31
that's like sting and his wife right
28:33
isn't that a
28:36
is that tantric i think
28:38
i think you've got confused it stings is
28:41
what it says
28:43
yeah so um sticking sex you would think
28:45
they're really boring but actually they
28:47
have quite well lengthy sex i wouldn't i
28:50
would say it's that exciting
28:54
i think yeah
28:56
i i don't suppose um stick insects could
28:58
probably like have sex that quickly
29:00
because they might set each other on
29:01
fire
29:06
it's a really good point
29:09
um but these guys um they're the
29:12
genitalia
29:13
the genitalia are in contact for 40 of
29:16
the time of the 79 days so they are kind
29:19
of you know at it for most of the time
29:22
i read a theory that the the males drag
29:24
it out so as to stop other males from
29:27
mating with the female yes
29:30
i read that from
29:31
a entomologist blogger called bug girl
29:34
which is where i got this fact from
29:35
originally but she actually found
29:37
several reports of stick insect group
29:40
sex in the literature which means that
29:42
maybe he's not trying to keep it in the
29:45
no
29:46
in the couple
29:48
that's why dogs do it though right so if
29:50
anyone's had a dog who's mated dogs can
29:53
stay attached to their [ __ ] for up to
29:55
40 45 minutes um standard and it's
29:59
another talk only anna could get away
30:01
with that sentence
30:05
these are just zoological terms guys um
30:08
but yeah that's to stop another dog
30:09
getting it getting too involved yeah
30:12
um so sometimes other males do sneak up
30:15
not in a in that way but just to try and
30:17
sneak in when the first male breaks off
30:19
to feed as sometimes happens um and the
30:21
intruder will start having sex with the
30:23
female but then if the first male finds
30:25
out the two of them will have a fight
30:26
while both holding on to the female
30:29
they'll kind of batted each other with
30:30
their legs oh that's good
30:32
so distracting
30:36
what is going on back there
30:43
[Applause]
30:47
[Laughter]
30:52
anyway
30:54
so this isn't this actually isn't true
30:56
of all stick insects it's it's true of a
30:58
lot of them um but there is um a stick
31:00
insect called um ecstatosoma tiaratum
31:05
and the females of that species um can
31:08
reproduce without the need of males
31:10
so they can like auto reproduce but no
31:13
one seems to have told the males
31:16
so the males find the females really
31:18
attractive and try to mate with them
31:19
whenever possible but the females have
31:22
involved an anti-aphrodisiac to keep the
31:24
males away
31:25
and when eventually they manage to get
31:27
past the anti-aphrodisiac and they mount
31:29
them they can kick them with their back
31:31
legs to get them off because they just
31:33
want to say no no we don't need you guys
31:35
we can just have sex on our own and they
31:36
so i think these this is actually very
31:38
confusing to evolutionary biologists
31:41
because usually asexual reproduction
31:43
evolves because of a lack of males and
31:46
so you know a female were asexually
31:47
reproduced but really you want the male
31:49
to be there because of diversity of
31:51
genes but yeah these stick insects are
31:53
saying no we actually way prefer it this
31:55
way we'll just create clones of
31:57
ourselves who are very easy to get along
31:59
with um
32:00
and
32:02
yeah they back them off and it's this
32:03
kind of conundrum like are they going to
32:06
outlast males are these male so i think
32:08
it's the spiny leaf stick insects in
32:10
australia um will the males die out
32:13
first or will they evolve to manage to i
32:16
don't know like assault the women enough
32:18
that they can still because if the if
32:20
the male manages to have sex with the
32:22
female they produce both male and female
32:23
offspring because they are fertilized
32:25
and if the
32:26
if it's just the female producing uh
32:29
parthenogenesis then they only produce
32:31
clones of themselves who are obviously
32:32
all females so it's a real um genuine
32:35
background like utopia versus dystopia
32:37
kind of all female world versus
32:40
[Laughter]
32:46
do you want to hear something cool about
32:47
stick and sex
32:48
eggs so some of the eggs have this
32:50
special capsule of sort of fat and other
32:53
good tasty stuff called a capitulum at
32:55
one end of them
32:56
and ants like eating the capitulum bits
32:58
so they carry the eggs back to their
33:00
nest and they eat the capitulum bit and
33:02
then they throw the eggs onto a kind of
33:04
rubbish heap where they remain
33:06
incubating and they can stay incubating
33:08
for up to a year and then the babies uh
33:10
stick insects just hatch and then they
33:11
walk out of the nest and um i read that
33:14
this was compared to paying a babysitter
33:17
to look after your eggs um to look after
33:19
your offspring but it's not really
33:21
because i think this is the equivalent
33:23
of leaving your child abandoned but with
33:25
a toblerone attached
33:28
the
33:29
someone who likes a toblerone will say
33:31
oh i love a toblerone i'll just
33:33
take this and what's this on the under
33:40
it is the worst parenting in the world
33:45
look after your own child because the
33:46
ants do eat some of the eggs i mean yeah
33:50
yeah they will they will eat thinking
33:51
they're edible some of them so yeah it
33:53
is saying that this guy might eat you
33:54
but if he doesn't then you might be okay
33:57
uh i'm off
34:00
i was i was
34:01
probably when i was researching today i
34:02
was looking into pictures of stick
34:05
insects
34:06
and something i think that's not said
34:08
enough is
34:09
it they're really weird eh like they're
34:11
yeah they look like it's they look like
34:13
sticks well yeah they look like trees
34:16
have become conscious and we're just not
34:17
acknowledging it it's just they do it
34:20
just looks like a bit of stick has gone
34:23
i'm alive oh my god what is the world
34:25
going on here and we've got probably an
34:26
insect it's just an insect no it's a
34:28
tree has woken up
34:31
that's a good point
34:32
like if you if you had two stick insects
34:35
having sex for 79 days attached to each
34:37
other how do you know it's not just two
34:39
sticks
34:41
yeah exactly
34:43
what if you've been watering it the
34:45
whole time and they're just like we're
34:46
trying to have sex here and you're like
34:49
who's this guy every day it's difficult
34:51
for researchers to find stick insects
34:53
because they're nocturnal and they
34:54
pretend to be sticks and so
34:56
[Laughter]
34:57
it is quite hard to study them
35:00
um and you know the best thing is a lot
35:02
of stick insect eggs look like seeds
35:05
how cool is that yeah
35:07
extra camouflage that is smart
35:10
it's not they are conscious trees that's
35:12
what's happened
35:14
we're all dancing around it because it's
35:16
too mind-blowing for us to accept
35:18
oh their children look like seeds
35:20
they're [ __ ] seeds
35:27
do you think that all things that are
35:28
camouflaged are actually the thing that
35:30
they're camouflaged against we're not
35:32
camouflaged look at us there's no
35:33
camouflage on this and then there's a
35:35
stick walking past me and i better go oh
35:37
that's that makes sense
35:40
but if you have like an arctic fox which
35:42
is camouflaged as snow you don't think
35:44
oh my god snow is no because it's not
35:46
like it's not like an iceberg walking
35:48
past me you'll be going oh hi iceberg
35:52
it's a fox
35:57
i feel we might have hit a nerve head
36:00
um
36:01
we've found a stick insect which is 126
36:04
million years old older than a lot of
36:05
diamonds i think that's just a stick
36:07
[Applause]
36:08
[Laughter]
36:12
[Applause]
36:19
do you know more about this
36:21
you and i let's talk all right
36:24
no well the cool thing is about it is
36:25
that um we know that a lot of them
36:27
imitate flowering plants and um we know
36:31
flowering sticks
36:32
um
36:34
we know
36:34
we know what plant it would have
36:36
mimicked because we if its wings were
36:38
folded it would have looked like a
36:39
stripy tongue and there was there were
36:42
stripey tongue looking plants around at
36:43
the time and we know those in the fossil
36:45
record and we know this and we can kind
36:47
of imagine what it would look like yeah
36:48
it's just so cool i think that's really
36:50
cool and there are 3 000 species in the
36:53
genus which includes stick insects and
36:54
leaf insects which is another kind of
36:56
insect
36:57
[Laughter]
37:03
um there's so this is one extraordinary
37:06
stick insect uh which was thought to
37:08
have gone extinct on lord howe island
37:10
which is in the south pacific uh thought
37:12
have gone extinct in 1920 um so it used
37:14
to be known as the tree lobster because
37:16
it's absolutely enormous it's 12
37:18
centimeters long on average i also heard
37:21
that it was known as a walking sausage
37:25
they can also imitate sausages
37:28
john's next fry up is gonna be yeah
37:31
i mean i do a lot of stick work but i
37:32
also dabble in sausage stuff
37:40
i wish that was the first time that if i
37:41
heard you say that
37:48
so these stick insects we thought
37:50
disappeared these giant insects in 1920
37:53
and very recently and within the last 10
37:55
years so there were rumors that they
37:57
were still existed on bull's pyramid
37:59
which is a pyramid that juts out of the
38:01
ocean very near to this uh this south
38:03
pacific island and these four
38:05
australians went to investigate these
38:06
rumors and see if this giant stick
38:08
insects that existed they climbed up
38:10
this vertical rock face and they found
38:11
under one bush these stick insects have
38:13
been living for almost 100 years they
38:15
found 24 insects under one plant one
38:18
single plant and we don't know how they
38:19
got there people think they might have
38:20
hitchhiked over on birds which i quite
38:23
like wow yeah and so now they really
38:26
want to reintroduce them to lord howe
38:28
island and the reason they went extinct
38:30
in the first place is because there were
38:32
there was a rat infestation that we
38:34
introduced so now lord how islanders are
38:36
being faced with a choice between would
38:38
you like to keep your horrible rat
38:40
infestation um or would you like us to
38:43
get rid of that in exchange for giant
38:46
horrific looking stick insects
38:48
the size of your head
38:52
um i'm going to wrap this up very soon
38:54
so anyone else got anything
38:56
i just on
38:58
duration of copulation uh there is a map
39:01
of the u.s that's been compiled because
39:03
there's an app where you can report how
39:06
long your sex lasts in america um and
39:09
then there's a map of the u.s which
39:11
tells you which states have the longest
39:13
sex um
39:14
which states are the biggest liars
39:16
[Laughter]
39:18
well i don't know if anyone's lying
39:20
because they are not long so
39:28
are
39:28
refreshingly honest
39:31
new mexico wins um population lost 7.01
39:35
minutes on average alaska loses the
39:37
average population is 1.21 minutes yeah
39:40
but it's cold it's cold
39:44
you want to get back inside don't you
39:49
wait
39:51

39:55
only al fresco fazada
40:00

[Music]
00:12
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:15
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:18
this week coming to you from the lowry
00:20
in salford my name is dan schreiber
00:22
joining me on the stage is the three
00:24
regular elves it's andy murray anna
00:26
chazinski and james harkin
00:28
[Applause]
00:34
and once again we have gathered around
00:36
the microphones with our four favorite
00:38
facts from the last seven days and in no
00:39
particular order here we go starting
00:42
with my fact my fact this week is the
00:45
seventh time park ranger roy sullivan
00:48
was struck by lightning coincided with
00:50
the 22nd time he fought off a bear with
00:53
a stick
00:55
[Laughter]
00:57
so
00:58
this guy's a park ranger um
01:01
he was he was i think he was fishing at
01:03
the time so he was just out there he's
01:05
been struck six times before and then
01:07
the lightning was coming and he just
01:09
thought i'll just stay here probably
01:11
nothing bad will happen
01:12
got struck by lightning was running back
01:14
to his car and suddenly a bear comes out
01:17
of nowhere and he's just like jesus
01:19
christ
01:20
he has to fight off a bear and then went
01:22
back home his diary must have been
01:24
amazing
01:25
bear bear lightning
01:27
lightning and bird
01:30
but he as i said he's been struck seven
01:32
times he was almost struck eight times
01:35
but the eighth time when he should have
01:36
been struck it hit his wife instead
01:41
it sounds awful it sounds terrible
01:42
because obviously he was interviewed
01:44
because he was very um he became well
01:45
known for this and he said naturally
01:48
people avoid me
01:51
i was walking with the chief ranger one
01:53
day and lightning struck way off and he
01:55
said i'll see you later roy
01:59
then he then he said there's a
02:01
restaurant on loft mountain that even
02:03
it's just overcast they won't let me in
02:05
[Laughter]
02:07
um it sounds awful it sounds terrible
02:09
because at time number four um he this
02:12
is august 1973. i think he he died in
02:14
the early 80s possibly but um in august
02:17
1973 he got in his car and he uh he
02:20
accelerated because there was a cloud
02:21
forming and he was very nervous about
02:24
storm clouds by this point and he outran
02:26
it stopped the car got out of it to
02:28
watch the storm hit by lightning again
02:32
they have a full list of all the times
02:34
that he was the first time he lost his
02:36
big toenail right to lightning oh it's a
02:39
big toenail yeah big toenail yeah uh the
02:41
fifth time a bolt came out of a small
02:43
low-lying cloud hit him on the head
02:46
through his hat
02:47
set his hair on fire again again
02:51
knocked him 10 feet out of his car and
02:54
knocked his left shoe off
02:57
do you know what why
02:58
shoes come off when you get hit by
02:59
lightning this is it because you watch
03:01
cartoons
03:04
so for example when it hits a tree
03:06
lightning um it will sometimes explode a
03:08
tree if the moisture is in the middle of
03:09
the tree because it takes the path of
03:11
least resistance um
03:13
people obviously there's moisture
03:15
everywhere and we're you know 70 liquid
03:17
so it often dissipates all over your
03:19
skin but if it when it does that um all
03:22
the sweat and the moisture on you boil
03:24
into steam immediately and sometimes so
03:26
much steam is produced that your shoes
03:28
will be blown off that's what causes it
03:30
so he got struck seven times yeah i
03:33
found someone who's been struck even
03:34
more really yeah recently um there's a
03:37
guy called melvin roberts from south
03:38
carolina and he at least claims to have
03:40
been struck ten times
03:42
um he was in the news in 2011 for being
03:44
hit six times and his wife says that
03:46
he's been struck another four times
03:48
since by lightning definitely she's not
03:51
just finding him really annoying
03:53
i i think i've found a group of people
03:55
who've been struck by lightning even
03:57
more than that well so yeah so um i was
04:00
reading the 14 times it's an amazing
04:01
magazine and in it they had a small
04:03
story where someone had written in to
04:05
contest the fact that roy sullivan was
04:08
the uh the most struck person in
04:10
of all time and what they said was that
04:12
in 1995 a group of explorers who were up
04:15
on a mountain mountaineers um got struck
04:17
20 times in 16 hours
04:20
a group of five and they were in their
04:22
tent and they all describe the moment
04:24
that they were struck and they were they
04:26
were just in there getting struck over
04:28
and over again 17 times and they went we
04:30
got to get out of there out of here
04:32
there's a rescue shelter down the
04:34
mountain so they started abseiling and
04:36
while they were doing that they were
04:37
struck three more times
04:39
on the ab sail down oh my god to be fair
04:41
i do think you have to divide that by
04:42
five though at which point you haven't
04:44
beaten the record anymore very good
04:45
point yeah okay it's all about the mass
04:47
sometimes goes from one person to
04:48
another as well no yeah or it can it can
04:51
hit for example uh it can rebound off a
04:53
tree and into a horse or whatever
04:55
it just yeah i mean that and then it's
04:57
less likely to kill you because at least
04:58
some of the force has been dissipated
05:00
yeah that's the idea um men account for
05:02
85
05:04
of lightning strikes isn't that weird
05:06
and the national weather service in the
05:07
u.s speculated that this might be
05:09
because men tend to be unaware of all
05:12
the dangers associated with lightning
05:14
more likely to be in vulnerable
05:15
situations unwilling to be
05:17
inconvenienced by the threat of
05:19
lightning
05:20
and don't react quickly to the lightning
05:23
threat or any combination of these
05:25
explanations
05:26
so they're stupid ignorant pig-headed
05:29
and they have very slow reactions that
05:31
actually was just my interpretation but
05:32
i think that's the long and short of it
05:35
a man in croatia has admitted that he
05:37
has not gone outside after hearing
05:39
thunder since lightning struck his penis
05:42
in 2007
05:46
zoran djerkovic
05:52
there it's online honestly
05:53
zoran djerkovic said
05:56
my friends used to tease me and i used
05:58
to tease them back saying my penis has
06:00
extraordinary ability now
06:03
but it doesn't
06:09
it's hard to tease them back when you've
06:11
just got a sort of charred stuff
06:15
um so i think there might be something
06:17
about croatia god hates it or something
06:19
so there's a croatian woman who has been
06:21
left recently with a severely burned
06:23
anus
06:24
after a lightning strike entered her
06:26
mouth while she was cleaning her teeth
06:29
and drinking water from the tap came
06:30
through the tap entered her mouth and
06:32
then left through the anus so it could
06:34
earth through the ground
06:38
apparently so uh the report said she was
06:40
wearing rubber soled shoes so once the
06:42
lightning had entered through her mouth
06:43
when she was drinking water from the tap
06:45
it took the easiest route and came out
06:47
of her rectum to reach her rubber's hold
06:48
shoes
06:50
you know speaking of uh lightning coming
06:52
out the bum uh
06:55
there actually is a fabled worm called
06:57
the mongolian deathworm which is uh in
07:00
mongolia and
07:03
is it done is it
07:05
it's a massive worm and uh all uh all
07:08
accounts of it say that it can shoot
07:09
acid from its eyes and lightning bolts
07:11
from its anus
07:13
accounts i don't think i don't think
07:14
they deserve the name accounts
07:18
no one really knows why um lightning
07:20
happens today i mean we kind of do like
07:22
when you're at school you they tell you
07:24
like it's because clouds are rubbing
07:26
together or whatever and it kind of is
07:27
that a little bit but it's like ice
07:29
going up in the clouds and water coming
07:31
down all the other way around and they
07:32
rub against each other and it causes
07:34
like static electricity like you would
07:35
have with a balloon um but no one really
07:37
knows why it starts and it's like a
07:38
chain reaction that starts and one
07:40
theory you'll like this dan apparently
07:42
um there's a latest theory coming from
07:44
russia that it's cosmic rays which come
07:47
from outside the solar system and hit
07:49
the earth and that's what starts the
07:50
lightning in the first place wow and no
07:52
one knows what causes cosmic rays really
07:54
i mean it could be supernovas or quasars
07:56
or the mongolian deathwer
07:58
[Music]
08:00
we can't rule it out
08:05
yeah amazing
08:06
you know america has two annual
08:08
conferences for lightning strike
08:09
survivors oh really yeah don't they say
08:12
about 80 of people struck by lightning
08:14
actually survive yeah strike yes yes 80
08:16
to 90 uh live but it's not plain sailing
08:19
after that it's not as though you have
08:21
burns and then you recover it can
08:22
scramble your memory and there are all
08:24
these long-term effects that we don't
08:25
know about and it just gets right into
08:28
your cells and there aren't enough cases
08:30
that are studied in the medical
08:31
literature to have a proper body of
08:33
science so it's a lot of guesswork and
08:35
um yeah there just isn't the money to
08:37
try and work out what exactly has
08:38
happened okay um we're gonna have to
08:40
move on to our next fact in a minute is
08:42
there anything else you guys want to add
08:44
um another thing that we can't explain
08:47
is the lightning that happens at the
08:49
beacon of maricabo which is the most
08:52
incredible place on the planet so this
08:54
is a place in venezuela it's the
08:56
katatumbo river i think in venezuela and
08:59
it's one tiny spot where for 280 times
09:03
an hour for 10 hours a night for 160
09:06
nights a year lightning strikes this
09:08
exact same spot and nobody knows why i
09:10
reckon it could be roy sullivan doing
09:12
some fishing
09:15
um but isn't that weird and it was
09:17
mentioned first in a poem about francis
09:19
drake in 1597 and um fishermen use it on
09:23
this lake in venezuela to light their
09:24
way so if they're going fishing they
09:25
just use this class and lightning storm
09:28
to say okay well there's a storm i guess
09:29
we go towards that because that's where
09:31
we'll get the best light slash die um
09:33
and
09:35
yeah no one knows why it happens wow
09:36
that's amazing oh yeah i did read about
09:38
that and i think it it replenishes the
09:41
ozone layer doesn't it the biggest
09:42
source of ozone on earth the biggest
09:44
single source of ozone on earth so it's
09:46
a good thing it's a good thing that's so
09:47
cool um okay we're gonna move on to fact
09:50
number two and that is james harkin
09:53
okay my fact this week is that this year
09:56
america's hero dog of the year award was
09:59
won by a cat
10:03
it can't have been a good night to be a
10:04
dog
10:07
yeah so um this is tara the cat and i
10:09
reckon some people will know it um or
10:11
will at least know the cat itself
10:13
because it's been a bit of an internet
10:14
sensation there was a young
10:16
child being mauled by a dog next to a
10:18
car you might have seen the video on
10:20
youtube and then this um cat runs on and
10:22
kind of scares the dog away and then
10:24
runs off again and she became such a
10:26
hero that she is now an honorary dog wow
10:31
what a what a way to reward her to
10:33
invite her to a ceremony full of dogs
10:36
who are now pissed off that a cat's one
10:40
it is amazing she just full-on runs into
10:42
the dog she just smashes her have you
10:43
guys seen that video you must have done
10:45
right yeah it's good it's good to watch
10:46
yeah
10:47
um yeah she got a few other awards
10:49
actually um she
10:51
she was invited by the local baseball
10:53
team the bakersfield blaze because this
10:55
was in bakersfield in california they
10:58
invited her to throw the first pitch
11:02
um no way yeah at a baseball game how
11:05
did she do um well it said on the news
11:07
report that she was assisted by her
11:09
family i've watched it and the family do
11:11
a lot of assisting
11:15
it goes wrong about five times and then
11:17
basically a guy holding a cat throws a
11:19
ball
11:20
basically it but this video is um the
11:22
first youtube video in history to reach
11:24
20 million views in five
11:26
days and the cat became a hero and the
11:29
dog was put down was it yeah no way you
11:32
could just bite it it had been the child
11:34
really badly on the leg yeah okay yeah
11:36
okay
11:37
sorry
11:39
i'm on the dog side no i'm not i'm not
11:41
um cats have a long and noble history of
11:44
impersonating dogs though don't they
11:45
because they um bark like can bark like
11:48
dogs like if you have cats and dogs
11:49
living together then cats will learn to
11:51
impersonate dogs
11:52
okay hang on no i've never yeah i'm the
11:56
mongolian deathwing guy
11:58
if you basically look at time into
12:00
youtube cat barking are you sure that a
12:01
cat can bat like a dog and not that a
12:03
dog can throw its voice
12:06
dogs are actually amazing ventriloquists
12:08
and we've not realized
12:10
but there is a really good video on
12:12
youtube of a cat owner i mean i can't
12:14
believe we're discussing youtube memes
12:15
but let's do it
12:17
of a cat owner who sneaks up behind her
12:20
cat filming her cat sitting on a window
12:22
ledge looking outside at a dog which
12:24
obviously lives with the family or lives
12:25
next door so it's lived around it and
12:26
barking and it's honestly going the
12:28
cat's going ruff ruff ruff and it keeps
12:30
doing this loads and then the person
12:32
who's holding the camera sort of clears
12:34
her throat and the cat hears and looks
12:35
around and starts okay
12:40
and this science came up with some
12:42
explanation like oh she turned
12:44
her vocal chords as she turned around
12:45
which changed the tenor of her voice but
12:47
it's quite clearly the cat going
12:49
whoopsie i've been caught right in the
12:52
act of impersonating a dog
12:55
so just on heroic dogs
12:57
um i have a couple of different kinds of
12:58
heroic dogs who we all know about so
13:00
bomb detecting dogs and we know about
13:01
guide dogs um there is only one i
13:04
believe there's a great piece in the
13:05
guardian about this there is only one
13:07
airborne nut allergy dog in the uk
13:11
sorry the dog was airborne on the nuts
13:16
my fault should have clarified so
13:18
there's a woman also called tara
13:19
actually tara bedford she has an
13:21
incredibly bad nut allergy so bad that
13:23
even the smell of nuts can trigger a
13:24
reaction
13:25
she says any russell on a train or a bus
13:28
and it's what are they opening should i
13:29
move she can't go to the cinema she
13:31
can't go she can't go in a plane
13:33
because uh someone opens a packet of
13:35
peanuts and she's dead she's in a plane
13:37
um she had to go to a e 40 times in four
13:39
years oh my gosh
13:41
but the story has a happy ending because
13:43
there was a labrador who had failed a
13:45
guide dog test for overuse of the nose
13:48
[Laughter]
13:50
put them together
13:51
and now the dog forcefully pushes her
13:53
whenever the dog smells uh nuts a peanut
13:56
or a nut she's allergic to so it's a
13:58
very good ending a seeing nose dog
14:00
seeing no's dog yeah wow that's so cool
14:03
and he flies as well he's
14:05
[Laughter]
14:08
um russia sorry
14:11
russia employs sniffer cats do you know
14:14
really yeah there's um there's some
14:16
sniffer cats in russia and they're
14:17
looking for kind of um russian mafia uh
14:20
might be smuggling fish um
14:24
for the caviar for uh down in the south
14:26
of russia uh and the most famous one the
14:28
first one was called rusik and rusik
14:30
died when he was hit by a criminal's car
14:32
quite recently and the locals thought
14:34
that it might be a contract killing
14:36
because the week before another cat
14:38
called basic was killed after he was
14:40
poisoned by a mouse
14:42
sorry with a mouse
14:45
[Laughter]
14:50
yeah
14:51
um i was i was looking into sort of the
14:54
latest in cat news
14:56
and i headed to a place i discovered a
14:58
few podcasts ago i headed to pussington
15:00
post
15:01
[Laughter]
15:04
uh just a few recent headlines um
15:07
cat ignores frog sitting on his paw
15:09
that's um
15:11
that was september 17th if you want to
15:13
look that one up
15:14
if you're into cat news yeah which you
15:16
obviously are um there's this guy who is
15:19
constantly updating us on cat news uh he
15:21
runs a twitter feed called nba catwatch
15:24
and the entire twitter feed is devoting
15:26
it is devoted to finding out what cats
15:28
are owned by basketball players um and
15:31
he's been going for quite a while now so
15:33
he said it started off as a typical dumb
15:35
twitter joke but the more i thought
15:37
about it something caught in my brain
15:39
i'd be watching a basketball game and
15:40
i'd start to think about
15:42
who does own a cat on this team
15:46
he said i'm aware that it's ridiculous
15:47
trying to find nba players cats on
15:49
social media however it's my niche and i
15:51
got there first
15:56
and yet no one has ever got their second
15:58
half
16:01
i found a really exciting guinness book
16:03
world record which is um for
16:06
world mousing champion
16:08
and the winner of this the the current
16:11
champion
16:11
is a dog
16:12
it's it's a cat but it's it's amazing
16:15
that this is an actual uh record that's
16:17
being held so it's a it's a cat called
16:19
tauser uh and towser was stationed at
16:22
distillery in scotland um and it where
16:25
grouse whiskey is made
16:27
and uh during her reign she killed 28
16:31
899 mice no way yeah and so that's a
16:34
guinness world record yeah and then she
16:36
died so she got taken over by another
16:38
cat called amber who's been there for 20
16:40
years now and who they've said was not
16:41
known to have caught a single mouse wow
16:44
they've all been killed already
16:47
she's just got there on the first day
16:49
and go well there's not much to do here
16:50
is there
16:52
um can i tell you about a couple of more
16:54
little dog things yes please so there
16:56
there's another kind of dog which is a
16:58
um a corpse detection dog so uh police
17:02
use them to find bodies things like this
17:04
um and they have to be trained but you
17:06
can't train them obviously on real cases
17:08
because they're very few of those so
17:10
they're trained uh by wrapping up pigs
17:12
bodies in shower curtains
17:16
and there's a man who runs a search
17:17
company his name is mick swindles and he
17:18
says he always puts clothes on the pigs
17:20
too
17:22
for added realism insert your own david
17:24
cameron joke here
17:34
well this is the thing he said of them
17:35
because he puts clothes on them and he
17:36
said people say why do you always put
17:39
them in a skirt
17:40
have you ever tried putting trousers on
17:42
a
17:44
pig so presumably these cats are just
17:47
now really good at detecting clothes
17:49
pigs dogs they're really good at
17:50
detecting clothed pigs
17:52
and not that good at detecting human
17:53
corpses because um
17:56
we're very similar to pigs in many ways
17:57
speak for yourself
18:00
we're gonna have to move on in a sec can
18:01
i say one thing this um original fact
18:04
was in bakersfield in california and so
18:06
i found another story from bakersfield
18:09
it's just a quick one it's a guy called
18:10
mr slivers
18:12
and he was arrested and they they
18:14
interviewed him afterwards and this way
18:16
he said he said i was just bored and i
18:18
decided i wanted to be a cat burglar
18:20
so i kicked in the window and tried to
18:22
steal the lion but it was too heavy so i
18:25
stole the cat
18:27
and he wanted to be a cat burglar and
18:29
thought that a cat burglar is something
18:30
that steals cats
18:32
i'm more interested in the home that
18:34
owns both the lion and the catch
18:36
it was a museum it was a museum
18:39
sorry right okay got it
18:43
otherwise i don't think you'd be saying
18:44
the line is too heavy
18:48
weight is the least of your problems
18:50
that line was way too bitey on my face
18:56
okay it's time for fact number three and
18:59
that is chozinski
19:02
yeah my fact is that the earliest known
19:04
penalty for illegal parking was to be
19:07
impaled on a stake
19:10
yeah
19:11
this one is firm but it's fair
19:15
and if you appeal it's a smaller steak
19:22
so this was actually in 700 bc uh this
19:26
is the earliest parking restriction i
19:27
can find so it's in nineveh which is the
19:30
assyrian capital and the parking
19:32
restriction was put in place by king
19:33
sennacherib and we have a stone tablet
19:36
where he's laid out the restriction and
19:38
it says royal road let no man decrease
19:41
it or let no man lessen it this royal
19:44
road and uh on pain of being impaled on
19:47
a stake and you got impaled on a stake
19:49
if you did park on the royal road in
19:50
your chariot obviously not your motorcar
19:52
um and impaled on a steak and then
19:54
planted in your own garden so that
19:56
people who are coming to visit you could
19:58
go oh i guess he's not available for tea
20:01
or whatever
20:02
wow wanted in your own garden what do
20:04
you have little labels sticking out like
20:05
you get on those plants
20:08
yeah with the species this is a norman
20:12
yeah snackera but he was um he's most
20:14
famous for moving his capital city to
20:16
nineveh like you say
20:18
and had like a really amazing capital
20:20
city didn't he had like gardens they
20:21
think it might be in the hanging gardens
20:23
yeah
20:24
and yeah he was just an extremely
20:26
opulent man apparently he had a piece of
20:29
noah's ark which he worshipped as a god
20:32
and he once wrote about his enemies
20:34
their testicles i cut off and tore out
20:37
their privates like the seeds of
20:39
cucumbers
20:41
he was he was good with a simile
20:43
actually
20:44
it sounds like he was very bad at making
20:45
sandwiches
20:48
you you selectively shave the outside of
20:51
a cucumber then you slot it slot at home
20:53
in the sandwich
20:54
[Laughter]
21:00
he actually so he was not a humble man
21:02
because he did uh create these
21:04
incredible gardens i mean he's i i think
21:06
people should know more about snackarray
21:08
but very little is written about him um
21:10
but a lot of historians now think that
21:12
the hanging gardens of babylon as you
21:13
say were his gardens and he irrigated
21:16
the mountains all around so he built
21:17
this incredible canal that stretched 50
21:19
kilometers up into the mountains and
21:21
which irrigated his whole amazing new
21:22
city um but he was pretty cocky about it
21:25
so
21:26
even on the signpost where he said
21:28
you'll be impaled on a steak or a
21:29
cucumber or whatever if you park here um
21:32
then the little slime post then went on
21:34
to list his achievements uh explaining
21:36
sinacrib is uh king of the world
21:39
favorite of the gods holder of
21:40
invincible weapons and architect of
21:42
urban design so i think that's quite
21:44
nice
21:46
on those signs you put a ps here's what
21:49
i've achieved guys wow
21:51
yeah that's amazing do you know uh in
21:53
britain the first ever parking ticket
21:55
that was given
21:56
no okay so it was in september 1960 they
22:00
set this up um yeah yeah yeah it was it
22:02
was quite like where it was like an
22:03
established proper where parking
22:05
attendants went out um and the first
22:07
ever ticket was given to a doctor thomas
22:10
creighton who was answering an emergency
22:12
call to help a heart attack victim at a
22:15
west end hotel so he raced there he got
22:17
out when he came back he had a ticket
22:19
and there was so much public outcry that
22:21
they uh they said okay you haven't got a
22:23
ticket that was the first ticket can you
22:25
imagine the uh how was your first day uh
22:29
cocked up pretty badly
22:32
um but the first parking ticket in
22:33
america was also um had to be overturned
22:36
oh really maybe parking tickets are just
22:38
a failed enterprise yeah this was a
22:39
reverend actually the reverend c h north
22:42
of the uh third pentecostal holiness
22:45
church and it was a newly installed
22:47
parking meter the country's first
22:48
parking meter and uh he just ran into a
22:51
shop to get changed and by the time he
22:52
came out he got a ticket and uh he
22:54
complained to the courts and had it
22:56
overturned wow it's it would be pretty
22:58
hard to get it overturned in the old
23:00
days when you're being impaled on a
23:01
stage
23:03
i've got a story about parking tickets
23:07
so begins so many of these
23:10
okay so this is from january this year
23:12
and it's it was from the bbc news
23:14
website a traffic warden is being
23:16
investigated after a parking ticket was
23:18
placed on a wheelie bin
23:20
the warden was accused of bizarre
23:22
behavior
23:25
um so one witness said this uh it
23:27
appeared the warden slapped the plastic
23:28
ticket envelope on the bin in a moment
23:30
of high jinx after a member of the
23:32
public pointed out it was on double
23:33
yellow lines so it's a joke it's just a
23:35
silly joke yeah but then the response uh
23:37
this is in kamathen um camarvenscher
23:40
council traffic and safety manager john
23:42
mcevoy said although this was meant as a
23:44
humorous incident we take this kind of
23:46
thing very seriously and have launched a
23:48
formal investigation into the conduct of
23:50
the officer
23:51
although this is meant as a humorous
23:52
incident we are still the you
23:54
think we are
23:58
i have some stuff on weird laws and
24:00
slightly strange punishments oh yeah if
24:02
that's okay um the hittites apparently
24:05
they had a rule where anyone found
24:07
guilty of committing a sex act with a
24:09
dog or pig would be killed inside your
24:11
own david cameron
24:13
[Laughter]
24:16
but if it was with a horse or a mule the
24:18
only punishment that they could give out
24:20
was that you were no longer allowed to
24:21
be in the presence of the king
24:25
wow
24:27
that isn't it and if the king um sorry
24:30
the king if the pig mounted the human
24:33
uh then no one would be punished at all
24:35
it had to be the human who was wow
24:37
well how would the king is that his
24:38
opening question to everyone you
24:40
a horse
24:43
because you could just be in an audience
24:44
of the king and it doesn't get to him
24:46
that you did it that's a good point yeah
24:49
i don't know he was very close with the
24:50
horse community
24:52
they reported all these things
24:53
hoofington post
24:57
that's really good
24:59
[Laughter]
25:02
it's it's good but it hurts
25:06
so do you know about the guy who
25:08
invented the double yellow lines no
25:11
um this is a guy called george bamber
25:13
and this was in the like late late 19th
25:15
century so the 1880s and he based the
25:18
double yellow line he was a farmer and
25:20
he based the design on the markings he
25:22
put on his sheep uh so he used to stripe
25:25
his sheep with double yellow lines and
25:26
he noticed that no one ever walked on
25:28
his sheep or parked on them
25:30
i thought this is something precisely
25:33
he wanted to keep the entrance to his
25:35
farm clear on market day so people come
25:37
in and buy his produce so he thought ah
25:39
what design could i use oh those yellow
25:41
lines from the sheep and he drew them
25:42
out and it really caught on in his
25:44
village to the mayor of his town started
25:46
using these double yellow lines to stop
25:47
people parking in undesirable places but
25:50
he received a 10 commission for a number
25:52
of years on like whenever the double yo
25:54
lines were used that he'd taken from the
25:56
sheep he got a commission on them that's
25:58
amazing isn't that cool
26:00
really cool because i would have thought
26:01
it was based on the single yellow line
26:03
but you're saying that was invented
26:04
first
26:05
double yellow line came first that is
26:06
interesting yeah yeah that's like
26:08
hearing that rocky ii was made before
26:09
rocky
26:11
and rocky ii was so good
26:13
i thought we should do one
26:17
[Laughter]
26:20
we're gonna have to move on to our next
26:22
fact you guys got any more
26:24
all right let's do it it's time for our
26:26
final fact of the evening and that is
26:28
andrew hunter murray
26:29
my fact is uh that female corn ear worm
26:32
moths go invisible after sex
26:36
so this needs a bit of explaining um
26:38
[Laughter]
26:39
basically uh when
26:41
so corn earworm moths are a kind of moth
26:43
and uh when males mate with females they
26:47
have a protein in their semen which
26:49
makes the female invisible to other
26:51
males so it gets into the female's body
26:54
and it inhibits all pheromone production
26:56
immediately and it and the males only uh
26:59
can tell when females around by smell
27:01
they don't have very good vision at all
27:02
they can't really see other females so
27:04
when a male so it's a it's a
27:07
uh self-preservation thing by the male
27:09
who's done the mating he thinks well i
27:10
want this female off the market so he
27:12
just makes the female invisible to other
27:15
males why didn't he just paint double
27:17
yellow lines on her
27:20
um so this uh this is uh from a book
27:22
called nature's nether regions by
27:25
a guy called uh meno uh schilteheisen i
27:28
hope i'm pronouncing his name right uh
27:30
and it's i just find that incredible
27:32
yeah that's amazing totally insane yeah
27:34
yeah so basically there are all kinds of
27:36
animals which do incredible uh strange
27:38
things through the medium of uh of sex
27:40
so um banana flies are a kind of fly and
27:44
male banana fighters kind of banana
27:51
um so when male banana flies have sex
27:53
with female banana flies uh they they
27:54
deposit a semen in the female and that
27:57
contains a chemical which makes the
27:58
female go completely off all other males
28:02
so they start kicking away other males
28:04
and then they give off a scent to make
28:05
themselves unattractive
28:07
and it lasts for a week it's not
28:09
actually that long is it
28:11
it is if you're a banana fly completely
28:13
kills their sex life i mean
28:29
um and it's because of the semen and the
28:31
and the fluids in the semen because they
28:33
get very dehydrated and so when they
28:35
have sex it's actually just like having
28:36
a drink for them
28:38
the reason we all do it dad
28:42
sometimes the tap is too far away
28:51
[Music]
28:51
[Laughter]
28:54
so uh so some insects do all the mating
28:57
so uh bees and ants do all their mating
29:00
for a lifetime in a single day when the
29:02
queen does all her mating um and the
29:04
males uh sort of try and fight each
29:07
other by with semen to their to do
29:10
rivalry basically and some queens if
29:13
they've mated with a male and they like
29:15
that male they can secrete a fluid to
29:17
protect that male's semen from the
29:20
rival sperm basically um and there's the
29:23
scientist who found this out is called
29:24
uh boris bayer he's from the university
29:27
of western australia and he was asked
29:29
whether this might happen in humans
29:30
whether human women um could do such a
29:33
thing and he said that he doubted it and
29:35
he said to my knowledge women do not
29:36
copulate with 90 mates in half an hour
29:39
[Laughter]
29:42
in his limited experience
29:46
we are learning a lot about you too
29:50
and so the new new zealand giraffe
29:52
weevil which is a it's a weevil not a
29:55
giraffe
29:57
the way that they mate is like you get
29:58
two evils and they fight against each
30:00
other and usually the biggest weevil
30:01
wins um but there are little weevils
30:03
that kind of sneak around and when
30:05
there's two males fighting over a female
30:07
that weevil goes in and then steals the
30:09
female while she's like kind of watching
30:11
the fight
30:12
and the female actually ends up having
30:14
sex with the smallest weevil wow
30:17
she actually goes for the lesser of two
30:19
weebles
30:26
i've never seen you look more
30:28
disappointed with me though
30:31
that was incredible my suicide was
30:33
committed tonight
30:37
here's a really really weird thing an
30:38
interesting thing about flies baby flies
30:42
baby flies can get characteristics from
30:46
males who have had sex with their mother
30:48
but not their father so a male who's had
30:51
sex with the mother much much earlier
30:54
can still give characteristics to the
30:56
fly
30:57
how is how well we don't know it's
30:59
really new research but that is
31:01
unbelievably interesting but what what's
31:03
a characteristic for them so say for
31:05
instance the female fly had sex with a
31:07
really big fly yeah uh and then nothing
31:10
came from it and then the father ended
31:13
up being a little scrawny fly then the
31:14
baby might have the bigness of the
31:16
original guy who she had sex with even
31:18
though it's not his actual father
31:21
this sounds very suspect are we sure
31:23
this isn't just a lot of women uh
31:25
cheating on their husbands
31:28
no it's new research
31:34
[Laughter]
31:39
uh yeah it's called telegony and it's um
31:42
it used to be believed by
31:44
humans by people in in ancient greek
31:45
time people thought that the you your
31:48
children would have things from whoever
31:50
you had sex with uh whether it was the
31:51
father or not and it was thought for a
31:53
long long time and then it was shown to
31:55
be not true in humans but they've
31:56
recently found that it might be true or
31:58
probably is true in flies wow that's so
32:00
cool when we when we had a wrong belief
32:02
and it was just completely wrong for no
32:03
reason and then it turned out we were
32:05
right all along it's very satisfying
32:08
um
32:08
uh norway norwegian rat sperm they can
32:12
join forces with each other and become a
32:13
super sperm
32:15
they have little hook-shaped heads and
32:16
hundreds of them just hook onto each
32:18
other and say guys we can do this
32:19
together and then they swim faster as a
32:22
single it's like it's like the power
32:23
rangers you remember when they combine
32:25
forces oh yeah
32:26
to make a larger power ranger
32:30
it's much like that and that's why andy
32:31
never did any more babysitting
32:33
[Laughter]
32:35
naked mole rats but have you guys all
32:37
seen naked mole rats because i mean
32:39
they're just so extraordinary and
32:40
basically every single way
32:42
but their sperm are also bizarre so
32:45
only seven percent of naked mole rat
32:47
sperm can swim so they ejaculate and
32:50
then the vast majority of their sperm
32:53
just like flails and floats around and
32:55
like drowns or doesn't make it anywhere
32:57
only 0.1 percent i think can swim really
32:59
fast enough to get anywhere so they're
33:01
just constantly ejaculating useless
33:02
useless sperm but they are immune to all
33:05
cancer so it's like a trade-off yeah
33:08
swings
33:09
yeah but um up to 90 of human uh male
33:12
sperm as opposed to human female sperm
33:14
obviously um
33:17
has
33:18
um
33:19
uh has two heads or two tails or is
33:21
completely uh deformed in other ways
33:23
it's uh it's there are very few which
33:25
are you know the perfect perfect guys
33:28
you see
33:29
on the posters
33:32
i just think there are unrealistic
33:33
standards of beauty for sperm
33:38
human semen is i'm sorry about this but
33:40
it is really amazing um
33:44
don't apologize
33:46
i'll send you the dry cleaning bill and
33:48
we'll call it quits
33:54
it contains proteins ladies and
33:56
gentlemen and that can forge a kind of
33:58
mating plug like other animals have
34:00
mating plugs that stop other males from
34:02
impregnating females but the proteins in
34:04
human semen can do a similar kind of
34:07
thing and it also contains chemical
34:09
compounds that prevent the sperm cells
34:11
from becoming over enthusiastic
34:14
i'm not quite sure what that means but
34:17
they sort of overshoot past the edge i
34:19
end up in the kidney or something
34:23
um so there was a question on on yahoo
34:26
answers
34:27
which i never know if people are joking
34:28
on yahoo answers but someone posted a
34:30
question saying
34:31
i ran out of shampoo and i don't have
34:33
any money have no choice and i have to
34:35
go to work tomorrow my hair smells like
34:38
feces
34:39
can i just use sperm as my shampoo
34:42
the next post was the next day from the
34:44
same guy well no one asked me about the
34:46
feces smell at least
34:54

hello and welcome to another episode of
00:16
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:18
this week coming to you from the wardolf
00:20
astoria hotel in central london my name
00:23
is dan schreiber i'm sitting here with
00:25
andy murray alex bell and our special
00:27
guest australian scientist author of
00:30
great named books like house of carls
00:32
game of knowns fifty shades of grey
00:34
matter it's dr carl crushel nitsky very
00:37
good pronunciation thank you and once
00:40
again we have gathered around the
00:41
microphones with our four favorite facts
00:42
from the last seven days and in no
00:44
particular order here we go starting
00:46
with you dr carl
00:48
yes my favorite fact is two people in
00:52
sydney every week get bitten by ticks
00:55
and shortly after become allergic
00:58
to meat for the rest of their lives now
01:00
i'm hyping it up a little bit
01:02
they're only allergic to
01:03
non-primate mammals but if they have
01:06
beef for example
01:08
several months after the event they can
01:10
then become allergic to meat for the
01:14
rest of their life and go into the full
01:15
anaphylactic reaction none of this sort
01:17
of like
01:18
i have the vapors i must lie down but
01:20
the full i can't breathe my face is
01:22
swelling if you don't not give me
01:24
adrenaline i will die anna as in wrong
01:26
and phylaxis to guard so your body is
01:29
going into a wrongly triggered immune
01:30
reaction i really like that a lot of
01:32
them can still eat chicken and fish just
01:34
like most semi-committed vegetarians
01:38
they're like no i'm allergic i mean i'm
01:39
not allergic to fish and it's the worst
01:41
punishment for an australian imaginable
01:43
not being able to have a barbecue
01:47
chicken and fish barbecue only
01:49
yeah so what happens is that the um
01:51
there's a bandicoot and it's carrying
01:54
around in its blood in his body in his
01:56
meat a chemical called alpha gals so the
01:58
alpha gal goes this chemical alpha
02:01
galactose goes from the
02:04
bandicoot into the tick
02:06
and then into you we humans do not have
02:09
it and here's the weird thing about it
02:10
it's the first known allergen that um is
02:14
a sugar
02:16
and the result of that is that two
02:17
people a week in sydney will start
02:20
howing into a bit of regular
02:22
meat and then suddenly start trying to
02:25
drop dead wow that's right has this been
02:27
going on for a long time and we've just
02:29
found out or um it's not like a new
02:31
species of super tick
02:33
well the ticket is only the victor the
02:34
carriage yes it's carrying but maybe the
02:36
tick is now evolving to be able to carry
02:39
a larger amount because uh i was always
02:42
wrong about evolution i went to the
02:43
galapagos islands last month so i read
02:45
the book um the beak of the finch it's
02:47
amazing it blew my mind it's about
02:49
evolution evolution happens really
02:50
quickly so when you look at it in a
02:52
fossil record over hundreds or thousands
02:55
or millions of years you're seeing the
02:58
beginning point in the end point and you
02:59
don't see that in between but jumps up
03:01
and down violently so yes your point
03:04
about the tick evolving could in fact be
03:07
true so uh on another thing on uh
03:09
parasites and ticks and things like that
03:11
um tortoises find it very hard to get
03:12
rid of ticks because of their necks and
03:14
because of the way they can't stretch
03:15
around and their shells
03:17
so north american wood tortoises they
03:19
just walk into ants nests
03:21
and they just sit in the middle of the
03:22
ants nest and obviously the ants swarm
03:24
all over them and they eat all the
03:25
parasites and eventually the tortoise
03:27
thinks right i'm clean enough and walks
03:28
out the other side
03:30
yeah symbiotic relationships i i read
03:34
about hunting the way that ticks hunt
03:37
which is really nice the article i read
03:39
said that they are patient hunters and
03:41
the idea is that what they do is they
03:43
wait in a spot where they see where
03:45
something is coming along they wait for
03:47
the thing to come up to it and then they
03:48
just step onto it so that's their
03:50
hunting there's no they can't leap they
03:52
don't chase anything down they just wait
03:54
like waiting for a tubes train then you
03:56
just wait at the platform exactly yeah
03:57
they patiently wait and just step on
03:59
they climb up a blade of grass and they
04:02
cling on with their second and third
04:03
pairs of legs and their first pair of
04:05
legs actually they've got four pairs of
04:06
legs haven't they because they're
04:07
arachnids but their first pair of legs
04:09
they just hold out in front of them
04:10
waiting for something to get near enough
04:12
for them to hang on to it's called
04:13
questing isn't it nice there's a special
04:16
name for it that's very good yeah um
04:18
just on the subject of allergies um old
04:20
allergy because i you know that's a
04:21
that's an amazing thing to get you can't
04:23
eat me anymore i read a story about a a
04:27
court in france has given a 500 pound a
04:30
month disability allowance so equivalent
04:32
500 pounds a month uh to a lady who uh
04:35
claimed and they've recognized this as
04:37
analogy that she's allergic to wi-fi
04:40
so she said she was allergic to wi-fi
04:41
hypersensitivity reuben is a guy every
04:44
five years he comes out with something
04:45
and he says mate you're lying right
04:48
reuben is a guy who gets these people
04:50
and he they look up electromagnetic
04:53
hypersensitivity syndrome on a good
04:55
friend wikipedia reuben 2010 2005 and
04:58
this one coming out in 2015 and he he's
05:00
a guy who gets them in a room
05:02
and then in a double blind
05:05
says how do you feel the symptoms now
05:06
every switching it on and off and they
05:08
always fail oh you should get over to
05:11
there yeah i can't believe they gave
05:12
that to her
05:14
you know you can be allergic to egg
05:16
yolks and not egg whites different
05:18
chemicals again proteins that's how
05:20
specific allergies can get
05:22
and you can train yourself out of
05:23
allergies in some cases in some cases
05:25
you can't you can then pick up allergies
05:27
the human immune system is wonderfully
05:29
fiendish
05:30
so on the on the training yourself out
05:32
of allergies thing i read that you can
05:34
train yourself out of for example a
05:35
peanut allergy and they tried it with a
05:37
group of children by
05:38
slowly exposing them to you know first
05:41
very very small amounts of peanut and
05:42
then gradually increasing it but the
05:44
only thing is
05:45
if you then can have say five or ten
05:48
peanuts and no experience no effects if
05:51
you then think oh that's fine and you
05:52
stop eating them then the tolerance goes
05:55
away so you have perversely you have to
05:56
keep eating
05:58
peanuts the thing you were allergic to
06:00
in order to keep yourself
06:02
not allergic to wow yeah
06:04
isn't that strange yeah that's amazing
06:06
wait so if you're allergic to peanuts
06:07
what are you actually allergic to
06:09
because peanut is i'm going to sound
06:11
really dumb here but it's not a nut is
06:12
it it's a legume yeah so and it's poorly
06:15
understood exactly as to what's going on
06:17
but the current theory relates
06:19
to the processing method
06:22
which in the west involves high
06:24
temperatures
06:25
okay okay so if you get nicotine we're
06:27
just sort of drifting off onto a side
06:28
thingy e-cigarettes nicotine of itself
06:32
has various properties not too good not
06:35
too bad mixed but when you burn it you
06:38
create so many different chemicals
06:40
you've heard of that nasty stuff the
06:41
dioxins if you get a backyard compost
06:43
pile and just some leaves and and burn
06:47
it you'll create some dioxins because
06:49
you'll have a range of oxygen
06:50
availability and temperatures that you
06:52
will create some nasty chemicals so
06:54
burning anything creates bad stuff
06:57
pollution is bad in that sense and so
06:59
in china where they do it the old way
07:02
no such thing as peanut allergies really
07:04
don't exist now so there's something
07:07
going on still trying to find out but
07:09
we'll find out soon wow
07:11
um we need to move on to our next fact
07:12
um can i can i just check obviously uh i
07:16
seem to be a magnet for dubious facts so
07:19
i just want to check one last allergy
07:21
uh there was a girl called grace morley
07:24
um so she wasn't allergic to apples she
07:26
wasn't allergic to birch trees but if
07:28
she ate an apple near a birch tree she
07:30
had an allergy yeah you can have um
07:32
pre-triggering look up pre-triggering
07:35
in
07:36
um
07:37
the magazines in google search look up
07:39
the word review okay review and you will
07:42
find that could possibly be my wife is a
07:45
gp and she had a patient who was
07:47
allergic to water oh yes i read about
07:49
this then you're allergic to your own
07:50
sweat and so it's it's madness
07:53
well look all you have to do is be
07:55
around long enough to love another
07:56
person very much in a special way have
07:58
babies and then you can die it's from an
08:00
evolutionary point of view actually
08:02
being alive and comfortable doesn't come
08:03
into it and what is this
08:06
do they have rashes on their skin if
08:07
they wash with water it's the ions in
08:09
the water non-purified water does
08:10
something to your skin so if you have to
08:12
purify all the water that you drink and
08:14
then pretty much any water that you come
08:15
into contact with is not including your
08:17
tears in your sweat bring up like rashes
08:19
on your skin and it's really
08:20
uncomfortable
08:21
and there's another allergy uh which is
08:23
with some people some
08:25
women are allergic to some of the
08:27
chemicals in sperm semen yes imagine
08:30
imagine
08:31
imagine if you were allergic to both sex
08:34
and water you couldn't get clean and you
08:36
couldn't get dirty but you could
08:37
probably
08:40
[Applause]
08:44
time for our second fact and that is
08:47
andrew hunter murray my fact is that the
08:49
millennium bug is going to hit in 2038
08:52
[Laughter]
08:53
and i'm sticking to it
08:55
explain yourself
08:57
okay so
08:59
a lot of computers these days uh run on
09:02
32-bit processors the processor is the
09:04
central calculating bit basically and um
09:08
they can handle 2 to the power of 32
09:10
different values and one of the ways
09:12
they count value is seconds for some
09:14
reason all computers count from the 1st
09:16
of january 1970 known as the epoch so
09:19
they can store about 2 billion positive
09:21
values 2 billion 147 billion 483
09:25
647 positive values or seconds in this
09:28
and that number of seconds after the
09:30
first of january 1970 it's 3 14 in the
09:34
morning and seven seconds on the 19th of
09:36
march 2038 and some computers at that
09:39
point will go a little bit haywire and
09:41
not be able to keep counting the seconds
09:44
upwards wow
09:45
now it's not going to be catastrophic
09:48
i'm already panicking i shouldn't have
09:50
said millennium bug well there's good
09:51
news in one sense because a lot of i
09:54
mean most new computers these days run
09:56
on 64-bit processors and those are
09:59
capable of going for another 292 billion
10:02
years
10:03
i don't trust them either we should be
10:05
more prepared
10:08
so
10:09
it's just there are but there will be
10:10
some 32-bit systems in bit things like
10:12
big transport systems big embedded
10:15
computers that are really hard to get at
10:16
or update so some of those will have a
10:18
problem right yeah so that is the proper
10:21
millennium bug yeah well they're
10:23
being plcs
10:25
programmable
10:27
logic controllers
10:29
plcs all over the world controlling how
10:31
much water goes into a hotel the size of
10:36
the dollop of cream on your little
10:38
biscuit an australian biscuit called an
10:40
iced vovo i don't know if you have such
10:43
gems i think there might be something
10:44
similar plcs have been designed without
10:47
security and providing they run they
10:49
leave them there and they're the buggers
10:51
that are going to cause the problem
10:52
further down the line because
10:55
you'll have the machines have moved up
10:56
from 32 bit to 64.
10:59
and people will be aware of it because
11:01
with the millennium bug the y2k as
11:04
opposed to the white 2k38 basically
11:08
the world spent about 400 billion
11:10
dollars
11:12
fixing making sure it didn't go bad and
11:13
all he had was things like poker
11:15
machines or slot machines in delaware
11:18
didn't work and your radiation counters
11:20
in
11:21
uh
11:22
japan didn't work and buses didn't work
11:24
in hobart because
11:26
little things like that and according to
11:28
my mates in the rt industry they all
11:30
sweated blood for months and years
11:33
beforehand getting really before because
11:35
it wasn't as though they just did
11:36
something the night before they spent
11:38
months and months fixing things up so it
11:40
wouldn't happen this one is going to be
11:42
nasty we've come across maybe even a
11:44
variation of it
11:46
in the boeing 787. oh yes oh my god that
11:49
was terrifying when that came up in the
11:50
news what was this um
11:53
that they recently issued a statement
11:55
saying uh we it may be the case that all
11:58
of our engines will shut down if you
12:00
leave them on for more than 248 days uh
12:02
because
12:03
that number of seconds the computer
12:05
can't count more of it and it will
12:06
spontaneously shut down into some sort
12:08
of fail-safe mode even potentially if
12:10
they're up in the air and number one do
12:12
they turn it off irresponsible they're
12:14
leaving an engine on for 248 days don't
12:16
they turn it off and they pop it but
12:17
maybe the clock is still running in the
12:18
background because the on off switch is
12:20
no longer an on off switch it's just
12:23
pretend to be asleep while the owner is
12:25
there but keep on reporting their very
12:27
thoughts to the mothership you have no
12:29
privacy and in fact it turns out that
12:31
248 days
12:33
when you count it in one hundredths
12:36
of a second
12:37
is 10 to the 32
12:39
100th of a second but they didn't
12:41
announce people work that out people
12:42
think well there must be a reason that
12:44
many days yeah yeah it also was involved
12:47
with an ariane rocket doing bad things
12:49
as well yeah because that had 16-bit
12:51
architecture and that only takes you up
12:54
to 32 000 or so
12:56
somethings and the ariane 5 which was so
12:59
much better than the ariane 4 hated the
13:01
rn-4 the arian 5 lovers it had too much
13:05
the phrase i used was sideways velocity
13:09
now i guess they must be using it in
13:10
some incredibly small unit like micro
13:13
meters per hour or something but once it
13:15
gets over 32 000 you've used up the
13:18
clock on your maximum number like okay
13:21
just a bit of a backup for the audience
13:23
numbers are infinite you're never going
13:25
to run out so what's this thing about
13:26
running out of numbers but the trouble
13:27
is that computers have limited storage
13:30
think about the odometer on your car it
13:32
rolls up to 99 000 kilometers or miles
13:35
and then goes back to zero again so
13:37
that's the whole problem that you your
13:39
clock is suddenly wrong and then you get
13:40
mismatches so the ariane 5 had a problem
13:43
with that as well this is also like
13:44
donkey kong where if you get such a high
13:47
score uh you can't handle it it goes to
13:49
the kill screen really that's why
13:51
pac-man does it as well that's such a
13:53
high school no that's what do you see
13:55
there's an incredible donkey uh donkey
13:57
documentary a documentary a documentary
14:00
called um king of kong highly recommend
14:02
watching it and that's that's it you get
14:04
to the kill screen it's known as the
14:05
numbers can't handle it and the the
14:07
whole uh computer sort of explodes
14:09
within well now that sci guy the uh
14:11
korean guy was he was his style of death
14:14
so he nearly killed the youtube counter
14:17
because 2 to the 32 divided by half
14:22
takes you up to
14:23
2.14 billion views
14:26
and i saw that they were getting close
14:28
to the 2.14 billion views out of a world
14:31
population of only seven so they then
14:33
went to 64-bit which is 292 billion or
14:36
whatever yeah
14:38
wow um space invaders is another game
14:40
that sort of uh is the way it is because
14:42
of a bug um so you know the point of
14:44
space invaders is that you've got to
14:46
shoot down all the little ships that are
14:47
coming down to get you and as you shoot
14:48
more and more down they come down faster
14:50
and there's a difficulty curve that
14:52
wasn't supposed to be the case when they
14:53
built it it was just that when you
14:55
played the game the machines that it was
14:57
running on weren't fast enough powerful
14:59
enough they weren't powerful enough to
15:00
um to run the program at full speed so
15:02
the program was actually running quite
15:03
slowly at the beginning the more ships
15:05
you shot down the less data there was to
15:07
process so the faster it was able to run
15:09
and when they when the guy who made the
15:11
game ran it he realized that was
15:13
actually a really great difficulty curve
15:14
to play the game on um
15:16
so
15:17
a couple of things about the millennium
15:18
bug which i thought you might like to
15:19
know uh in february 1999 hundreds of
15:22
people made panicked phone calls to
15:24
action 2000 which was the british body
15:26
for dealing with the millennium bug
15:28
after richard madeley tv host on this
15:31
morning
15:32
uh gave people a look at his millennium
15:34
cupboard which was full of tinned food
15:37
and candles
15:38
and he recommended that people stockpile
15:40
10 weeks worth of food for after the
15:43
millennials oh my god and they got
15:44
hundreds of calls just because richard
15:46
bailey had done this and the world
15:47
health organization said that nuclear
15:49
reactors might be at risk well they've
15:50
got clocks in them they've all got
15:52
clocks i know and we will never know how
15:54
much was because a lot of money was
15:56
spent fixing the problem and how much
15:58
was hype i mean there was definitely
16:00
hype and i think a lot of people made a
16:02
stack of money selling yeah yeah
16:05
i know a lot of it people who are honest
16:07
yeah and they said they work their
16:08
little butts off for right yeah right um
16:10
we should move on to our next fact
16:12
very very quick last thing go for it on
16:14
uh the millennium bug this was a
16:16
millennium style bug uh so last year
16:19
2014 the u.s army sent 14 000
16:22
conscription letters out all to men who
16:24
had been born in the 1800s
16:27
and they sent it to their descendants so
16:29
they say your great grandfather must
16:31
report for military service on pain of a
16:32
fine or imprisonment if he doesn't um
16:35
there you go
16:36
the youngest of them would have been 117
16:38
years old
16:41
[Applause]
16:44
okay time for fact number three and that
16:46
is alex my fact this week is that
16:49
buckminster fuller's complete diaries
16:50
take up over 80 meters of shelf space so
16:53
the the thing i think okay i'll just
16:55
quickly go through his his life because
16:56
he's a completely mad individual i think
16:58
he's quite famous in america he was this
17:00
um
17:01
a writer architect scientist inventor
17:03
general thinker he did an awful lot for
17:05
science he ordered an awful lot for
17:06
science fiction um he was that kind of
17:09
area very kind of theoretical um he when
17:11
he was much younger he wasn't very good
17:12
at school but he did a lot of practical
17:14
mechanics he had all sorts of jobs
17:15
inventing from age 12.
17:17
he went to harvard and got expelled
17:20
twice i can't find anyone else who's
17:21
been expelled
17:23
the first time was spending all his
17:24
money on a massive party um with a
17:26
vaudeville troop uh he just took all of
17:28
the money that he could find and spent
17:30
all on one big party and the second time
17:32
was for general irresponsibility and
17:34
lack of interest so i mean that's pretty
17:36
impressive so he was he was a mechanic
17:38
for had lots of uh random jobs in 1927
17:41
his daughter died of polio and he went
17:44
into a very deep depression for about a
17:46
year um he was on the brink of suicide
17:48
he went to the edge of lake michigan i
17:49
think it was and supposedly had an out
17:51
of body experience and came out of it
17:54
realizing okay i've got to devote the
17:55
rest of my life to helping to the
17:56
advance of humanity
17:58
so he immediately went into overdrive
17:59
for the rest of his life and invented
18:01
all these weird things made
18:04
interesting concepts became went into
18:05
lecturing and did these incredible
18:06
lecture circuit tours yeah he wants to
18:08
just i mean because i mean this is a man
18:10
who his
18:12
diary uh takes up as we say 80 meters of
18:15
shelf space so he was writing his diary
18:17
every 15 minutes wasn't he so every 15
18:19
minutes adding new stuff to it um he
18:22
once gave a 42 hour long video lecture
18:26
and it's on youtube and if you haven't
18:27
seen it it's one of his finest moments
18:29
so not not straight there was a i'm sure
18:31
there must be a 42 minute long lecture
18:33
yeah no no someone someone once said and
18:35
this lecture by the way was called
18:36
everything i know
18:39
but um
18:40
some people who uh had actually i read
18:42
an article by someone whose friend was
18:44
one of his students and they said that
18:46
he could go for no break with no notes
18:47
from 9 a.m to 5 p.m we're just not
18:50
stopping it's just a lecture that and
18:52
people used to stay that long because it
18:53
was a marathon of of amazing information
18:55
coming out from the sky
18:57
he was very deep
18:58
like he was one of the early people to
19:00
start thinking about the environment and
19:02
he came up with this thing that he
19:04
called the world game which
19:07
on the face of it is basically how can
19:09
we make things better for everybody in
19:11
terms of justice poverty
19:14
education
19:15
with the limited resources that we have
19:17
because the earth is not infinite and he
19:20
loved the word dymaxion now what's the
19:23
so i think um he used it when he was
19:25
talking to some friends when he was
19:26
explaining something and it's a
19:29
dynamism uh maximum and ion of the three
19:32
it's a poor mancha of those three um and
19:34
he it was sort of his brand he all the
19:36
inventions um he could have put his name
19:37
to it so his diary he called the
19:39
dymaxion chronophile which is a great
19:41
name the thing he's probably most famous
19:43
coming up with is the geodesic sphere
19:45
which is a a structure that is spherical
19:47
made of triangles or a a polygon shape
19:51
and it's this um amazingly futuristic
19:53
piece of architecture really that's what
19:55
it is um i really love that he came up
19:57
with it and then a few years later it
19:59
was discovered in nature and he was
20:01
really big about about taking he really
20:03
liked the idea of taking designs from
20:04
nature because those are going to be the
20:05
best designs but he actually found this
20:07
one and it was found to be in a type of
20:09
carbon which is now called buckminster
20:10
fullerene oh wow you know the amazing
20:12
thing about buckminster fullerene is
20:14
that footballs
20:15
are
20:16
in the shape of interfering molecules
20:18
they're a mix of what is it is it
20:20
triangles and some hexagons
20:24
yeah the eden project is another example
20:26
of one of those domes it's made that
20:27
one's made of hexagons but obviously you
20:28
can divide that up as triangles and the
20:30
eden project was originally an
20:32
association football and they just kept
20:34
inflating it
20:36
they never stopped do you know do you
20:37
know when so that's the eden project is
20:39
the whole building is basically a
20:41
massive inflatable tent whenever there's
20:43
a puncture which is quite a lot because
20:44
of the birds
20:45
they just tape it up did you know that
20:46
it's just covered it's just covered in
20:48
plastic like like a bicycle cause i i
20:50
read that his he had a house which was
20:52
made of this uh this globe as well and
20:55
um he had a leak so they tried to get it
20:58
fixed um and as they were fixing it they
21:00
burnt the whole place down
21:02
yeah so fixing it with fire
21:04
exactly i have no idea what they did but
21:06
i've maybe maybe that's why they just
21:07
celebrate things now it kind of makes
21:09
sense
21:10
his invention that i like most so he
21:12
made this um this car of which i think
21:14
there's only one left now that we have
21:16
called the dymaxion vehicle which looked
21:18
like a zeppelin and it had three wheels
21:21
and apparently when it came out it was
21:23
the hit of all cars it could apparently
21:25
maneuver itself to a 180 on the spot so
21:28
if you were driving it could literally
21:29
just go because it had back wheel
21:31
steering once it had fixed front wheels
21:34
and a single rotating back wheel that's
21:37
incredible and no no uh no rear view
21:40
mirror it had periscope
21:43
it just sounds like and i've seen a
21:44
picture it looks like a combi fan it's
21:46
amazing it's yeah and he aspired to make
21:48
it fly later on but that never came but
21:51
it came back but it was so unfair
21:53
because there was the first prototype um
21:55
of the dymaxion vehicle had been on the
21:57
road for three months and it was being
21:58
shown off at the chicago world's fair
22:01
and it was involved in a crash which
22:02
killed uh the driver and but it was and
22:05
seriously injured a passenger but it
22:06
wasn't the fault of that car it was it
22:08
was another car which had caused the
22:09
accident but
22:10
it's sort of set the world against it
22:13
and i think only two more were built and
22:16
there's only as you say there's only one
22:17
surviving today yeah so he deliberately
22:19
built it not so much as
22:21
a car
22:22
but as something that included car-like
22:25
properties so he thought it would be
22:27
something that would go on water and in
22:28
the air and in fact it was unstable at
22:30
high speeds on the highway because
22:32
simply because that's what you needed in
22:34
for its properties to be a moving
22:36
vehicle so he saw it as an intermediate
22:37
stage and specifically said that it
22:39
should be driven only by people who are
22:41
skilled in it in other words it's a
22:43
really unstable vehicle and really scary
22:45
and you can kill yourself if you try to
22:46
drive it like a normal car on highway
22:47
speeds okay
22:49
but it was great he came up with 10
22:51
security things as well he's amazing he
22:53
made up i just find he invented
22:55
everything for himself he invented his
22:57
own sleep sleep cycle he slept he would
22:59
spend six hours awake and 30 minutes of
23:01
sleep and he spent two years doing that
23:03
and he says the only reason he gave it
23:04
up was because his colleagues couldn't
23:05
keep up with his schedule because he
23:06
would have 22 hours in the day when he
23:08
was working how did he keep up the diary
23:10
if he updated it every 15 minutes i
23:12
don't know but i mean maybe if maybe he
23:14
just went back cause he knew he was
23:15
sleeping so yeah it'd be like 202
23:16
sleeping how many years do you keep the
23:18
diary going for
23:19
1920 to 1983. at the half a century so
23:23
he started when he was 25 finished with
23:24
his diet he included everything he ever
23:26
wrote apparently since he was four years
23:28
old so he obviously kept everything and
23:30
then put it all together in a diary did
23:31
you hear the story about how he died yes
23:34
it's one it's it's kind of like the
23:35
notebook the movie the note but he
23:37
basically he he was according to some
23:40
sources how he died was he was at his
23:42
wife's bedside and she was in a coma and
23:44
so he was visiting her at hospital they
23:46
said that he got overexcited by the fact
23:48
that he he felt as if she had squeezed
23:51
his hand back as if he'd had some
23:52
contact and the over excitement is kind
23:54
of what ended him and they both died i
23:56
think it was in the same week and
23:58
within hours within hours right yeah i
24:00
mean it's very it's yeah
24:02
um and he he had do you have what he has
24:04
on his gravestone yeah um call me trim
24:06
tab which is the trim trim tab is a
24:08
little mechanical component in an
24:10
airplane that makes tiny movements but
24:12
moves the entire rudder of plane and
24:14
that makes that steers an entire plane
24:15
and that was what he wanted to be he
24:17
wanted to be he really believed that a
24:18
single person could make a huge
24:19
difference um so he wanted to be that
24:21
person that was helping to govern
24:22
humanity into greater yes
24:24
he popularized the phrase spaceship
24:25
earth he was one of the people who was
24:27
really bright i love that he loves the
24:28
idea that um the earth is a spaceship
24:30
we're all the crew we have limited
24:31
resources and we need to act as a big
24:33
team to kind of keep it running it's
24:34
such a good message isn't it it's so
24:36
good
24:36
i've got one last thing on him um he
24:38
released an lp
24:40
a music album
24:41
no yes he did album uh no so um it
24:44
includes a song which you can see on
24:46
youtube you can see him actually singing
24:47
on youtube um so it's this you know the
24:50
song home on the range
24:51
so he sang that but he rewrote the
24:53
lyrics to call it roam home to a dome
24:55
oh hey yeah and that's on youtube it was
24:58
a promotional video for his yeah exactly
25:01
my very very favorite of uh buckminster
25:04
fuller's inventions
25:05
he when he used stairs didn't say i'm
25:07
going upstairs or downstairs he said i'm
25:09
going instead or outstairs because
25:12
you're either going in towards the
25:14
center of the planet or you're going out
25:16
away from the center of the planet
25:18
that's this thing about spaceship earth
25:20
it just makes you think oh yeah i am
25:22
actually moving towards the center of
25:23
the earth whereas i thought i was going
25:25
downstairs right i'm going
25:27
he specializes in making up his own
25:29
words which are somewhat convoluted
25:31
yeah compound words like uh omni
25:33
self-regenerative or new well he loved
25:35
omni everything
25:36
he also claimed to have invented the
25:38
word debunk
25:40
yeah but no one can debunk it because
25:42
exactly
25:47
okay time for our final fact of the show
25:49
and that is my fact my fact this week is
25:52
that australian scientists have recently
25:54
named a newly discovered species of fish
25:57
blue bastard
25:59
that's the that's the name that they've
26:01
given it there is a latin name uh that
26:03
they've given this fish uh which is
26:06
something i cannot pronounce it's so
26:08
long do you wanna ever go
26:09
yeah um i think it's called
26:11
plectorencious chyroleonothus
26:14
yep so it's the
26:15
chyruleonothus which when you break it
26:18
down into two separate words is blue in
26:20
latin and bastard
26:22
and it's quite nice because that was
26:24
apparently it was a local fish in
26:25
australia that the fishermen the local
26:27
fishermen used to call blue bastard
26:29
because they weren't quite sure what it
26:30
was they eventually got their hands on
26:32
it scientists and they named it as a
26:34
species found out it was a new species
26:36
and yeah that's they called it blue
26:38
because it was blue in color it started
26:39
off you sort of yellowish color and the
26:41
older it got the bluer it got
26:43
and bastard because it was really hard
26:44
to catch because it hung around in murky
26:46
waters where there were either sharks or
26:48
crocodiles or both
26:50
and um it came into the modern uh
26:53
palance uh via some fishermen in weeper
26:58
photographing it and here's something
26:59
weird for you
27:00
weeper is one of the few places in the
27:02
world where instead of getting
27:05
two high tides and two low tides a day
27:07
you only get one that was in my eighth
27:09
book
27:09
[Laughter]
27:12
how come
27:13
because you get the water flooding into
27:15
the rivers from the high tide and as it
27:17
comes back it exactly counteracts the
27:19
next tide the low tidal fills it out and
27:21
smooths it out into nothing think of a
27:23
bathtub and then a large breadboard
27:27
then with the breadboard and one into
27:29
the bathtub it's full of water you just
27:31
sort of
27:32
pat
27:33
and then you wait for the wave to go
27:34
down to the other end and come back and
27:36
then depending on when you do the next
27:38
pat you can either wipe out the wave or
27:40
you can build it up into something
27:42
that'll switch over the edge so it's a
27:44
resonance thing i found that out by
27:45
talking to people at the national title
27:47
center in flinders university
27:49
by dropping a breadboard into a bathtub
27:52
um i've been finding out about
27:54
australian fish because we've got a lot
27:55
of great australian you rather you guys
27:58
have a lot of great australian fish
27:59
thank you um
28:01
the number of fish that you've got
28:02
you've got unicorn cod squirrel fishes
28:05
wasp fishes armored sea robins
28:08
i love the sound of an armored sea robin
28:10
um see bats
28:12
wolf herrings
28:13
gobble guts pony fishes gold guts sounds
28:16
very awesome because it's amazing i
28:18
can't remember whether this is
28:18
australian or not but there is a fish
28:20
called the slippery dick i just wonder
28:22
yeah i don't think it is an aussie but
28:23
yeah there is one called the slippery
28:25
dick it secretes lots of mucus um i've
28:27
just got a couple of things just because
28:29
as an australian very proud uh that all
28:32
these species of fish are being
28:34
named in a in a nice australian fashion
28:37
um and it was also big news for
28:39
australian science because uh the
28:41
ignobles the the prizes that make you
28:43
laugh that make you think awarded a
28:45
prize to an australian scientist uh and
28:47
it was a chemistry professor called
28:49
colin raston and he's worked out how to
28:52
unboil an egg
28:54
and so that he won he won an award for
28:56
unboiling an egg which means that you
28:57
could un-boil it separate out the yolk
28:59
and give it to the people who are
29:00
allergic to whites yeah
29:03
but is it if your egg's been incorrectly
29:04
boiled you can say take this pack please
29:07
unboil it and re-boil it for three
29:09
minutes not for six well it might be
29:11
when you're at home and you've eaten too
29:12
much and you go oh what are we gonna do
29:13
with this boiled egg well let's let's um
29:15
boil it and we boil it after you eat it
29:18
once you've eaten it
29:20
what about mad cow disease proteins
29:22
uh-huh right
29:24
so imagine we have a situation where in
29:27
the united kingdom some people are
29:28
carrying prions priors prions in their
29:31
blood which are just proteins that have
29:32
been
29:33
misformed and when they kiss another
29:36
similar protein they misform that
29:38
imagine you can reverse the process
29:41
ah see makes you think and it makes you
29:44
laugh and learn at the same time the
29:46
ignobles
29:47
i do love the ignoble prizes i should
29:49
mention right the beginning that i
29:51
myself have won an ignoble prize that's
29:53
extraordinary so for those listening who
29:54
don't know what the ignoble prizes are
29:56
that is the yearly award system given to
29:58
scientists who first come up with
30:00
research that in the the eyes of the
30:02
ignobles make you laugh and then make
30:04
you think that's right laugh and learn
30:06
and my groundbreaking research was for
30:08
belly button fluff and while it's almost
30:10
always blue
30:12
and for that i got my ignoble prize and
30:14
harvard showed me so much respect that
30:16
they flew me all the way from sydney to
30:20
harvard at my own experience they would
30:21
not insult me by offering me money
30:24
that's how much
30:25
respect it is that is how highly valued
30:27
this price is and then for the next
30:30
month i had people wanting to have a
30:32
section as a share of my one million
30:35
dollar prize which they thought was
30:37
wrongly the nobel prize
30:40
was a set of red wind-up chattering
30:42
teeth on a stick right that was a
30:43
surprise that was a prize um on a tile
30:46
written in very bad text of color that
30:47
faded immediately right
30:50
wow i didn't realize we had a nick nobel
30:52
prize
30:53
i tried to keep quiet apart from
30:54
bringing it up into every conversation i
30:55
possibly can as the very first sentence
30:57
[Laughter]
30:59
so not only
31:01
is colin raston and yourself dr cole
31:04
ignoble winners uh there are more
31:05
laureates i prefer to call ourselves
31:08
uh nick enfield um
31:11
yeah he worked out that ha was uh it was
31:15
a universal word word amongst languages
31:18
universal word amongst languages is the
31:20
univ is there a universal meaning
31:22
huh
31:23
hey there's an australian wars called
31:26
and it was it was it was discovered by a
31:28
guy called arnold menke in 1977 and he
31:30
called it that because he went aha when
31:32
he found it so where does the actual ha
31:35
sorry the addition i don't know where
31:36
the second half comes from but it's
31:37
called
31:38
that's when he told someone about it and
31:40
they said
31:42
he's also his number plate
31:44
did he name
31:58
was some australian scientists and they
32:01
want it for um calculating the number of
32:03
photographs that mathematically will
32:05
make it highly unlikely that anyone in a
32:07
group photo has their eyes closed ah
32:09
nick she was my work experience person
32:12
yeah yeah oh my god well i bring this up
32:14
because it's the subject of photos and
32:16
when we were looking into uh just a few
32:19
things about you as you were coming on
32:20
the show uh we discovered that you have
32:22
a claim to the coining of the word
32:25
selfie you're a part of its uh origin
32:28
story yes so way back in 2012 this is in
32:30
my 34th book um the house of carlson
32:33
maybe i don't forget the name of this
32:34
too
32:35
so
32:36
a guy called nigel hope hereafter known
32:38
as hopi because we australians shorten
32:40
things down remove all the following
32:43
syllables and just put a vowel in so not
32:45
afternoon but arvo and hopi um posted
32:49
that he had fallen over and he'd put his
32:52
teeth through his lower lip and he had a
32:53
stitch and gee it was itchy and how long
32:55
would it take to stop itching and then
32:57
the
32:57
[Music]
32:58
dialogue flowed backwards and forwards
33:00
and at 3 19 in the afternoon i forget
33:02
the exact day in 2003 i think it was
33:03
something september he then posted look
33:06
okay guys i was drunk i fell over um
33:09
here's a selfie sorry
33:11
here's a photo of my face sorry it's out
33:14
of focus here's the exact words sorry
33:16
it's out of focus comma it's a selfie
33:20
and that according to the oxford english
33:23
dictionary who made that word the word
33:25
of the year in 2013. that was the first
33:28
time ever in the history of the human
33:30
race that the word was written down in
33:31
any medium now known or hereafter yet to
33:34
be devised and guess whose home page has
33:36
appeared on
33:37
mine
33:39
dr carl q a home page that's so good
33:43

00:38
[Applause]
00:43
and once again
00:44
we have gathered around the microphones
00:46
with our four favorite facts from the
00:47
last seven days and in no particular
00:49
order here we go starting with you james
00:52
harkin okay my fact this week is that in
00:56
1511 the people of brussels protested
01:00
against the government by filling the
01:02
city with dozens of pornographic snowmen
01:07
it's a pornographic snowman there's a
01:09
snowman that's not wearing a scarf
01:13
yeah
01:14
yeah how did that work well i can tell
01:15
you about the snowmen themselves because
01:17
they have been described
01:19
there was a snow nun who was seducing a
01:21
man
01:23
there was a snowman and a snow woman who
01:25
were having sex in front of the town's
01:27
fountain
01:29
and the snow naked boy urinating into
01:32
the mouth of a snow drunkard
01:36
how do they do it like because they must
01:37
ha
01:39
when a male snowman and a female snow
01:40
lady love each other very no i know yeah
01:43
yeah because is it like oh this is a
01:44
lovely looking snowman and then a final
01:46
little things added and suddenly ah or a
01:49
big thing it really depends on the
01:50
snowman yeah i don't know it's cold it's
01:53
cold i'm sure it's not going to be big
01:55
yeah so
01:57
um so actually it was kind of a
01:59
tradition at the time or it was a few
02:01
people did it and then everyone kind of
02:03
took over it's known as the miracle of
02:05
1511. um it had been really cold for
02:08
like six weeks in brussels very very bad
02:10
weather uh and there'd be massive
02:12
population growth in the city and
02:14
there's a big wealth discrepancy between
02:16
the peasants and the habsburgs who were
02:17
in charge so everyone was generally
02:19
pissed off with the government and they
02:21
thought well how can we get our point
02:23
across well the only way to do it is to
02:24
make a snowman but i don't know how you
02:26
could do two snow
02:28
people having sex because what because
02:30
snow men are just a snowman is just a
02:32
ball of snow and then a smaller ball of
02:33
snow and then yeah i think these were
02:35
like a bit more they look more like a
02:37
statues that's a very good snow skill
02:39
though i mean i can't do that kind of i
02:41
don't know i've never tried maybe maybe
02:43
everybody can you could do the snow
02:44
balls that would be true
02:47
for the uh the pre-curfew um snow
02:49
sculptures uh several snow people were
02:52
involved in a tableau satirizing the
02:54
edicts handed down by the local
02:55
government which i think sounds like a
02:57
very complicated snow sculpture given
02:59
the
03:00
three bulls on top of each other we come
03:01
up with now yeah and they had they had
03:03
snow unicorns and snow mermaids and a
03:06
snow dentist
03:08
not even joking
03:10
there was it were they had uh tooth
03:11
pullers back in the day so that was that
03:12
was what they had and apparently busty
03:14
snow hookers enticing people into the
03:17
red light district
03:18
so it serves a purpose as well as
03:20
protesting the government you know it
03:21
can help local industry brussels seems
03:23
to have very creative protests i i was
03:26
reading i think it was just this year
03:28
that they were protesting against the
03:29
government it was the farmers so the way
03:31
they protested was they were lined up
03:33
against riot police but they brought
03:35
their cows with them and then they they
03:38
squirted direct from the other cow milk
03:40
at the right place and there's all these
03:42
photos of right police with their
03:43
shields going these guys go weirdest
03:46
looking protest
03:48
um yes so okay so in brussels around the
03:50
time um they had all the different
03:52
classes the class system and all the
03:54
different classes had their own kind of
03:56
snowman and so if you're like a poor
03:58
person a peasant and you saw a posh
03:59
snowman down there you'd attack that
04:01
snowman
04:02
wow yeah and those magistrates got
04:04
involved and there's court cases
04:06
how can you tell if a snowman is posh no
04:08
maybe the carrot comes from waitrose
04:12
i don't know you know you can buy off
04:15
ebay melted snowman and that involves
04:20
a bowl of water with a carrot and two
04:22
blueberries in it
04:24
buy it 99p is the starting price and the
04:27
finishing price
04:29
also snowman building kits you can get
04:32
now okay so you have a snowman building
04:34
kit which just says on the front just
04:36
add snow and there are loads of these um
04:40
so to make a snowman the best way this
04:41
is from an article on the smithsonian
04:43
website and they interviewed a physicist
04:44
at rhode island college and his name is
04:46
dan snowman and they don't
04:48
ever refer to it throughout the article
04:50
they just
04:51
just very politely don't make any gags
04:53
and so
04:54
so he says that for one thing he says
04:56
that you can make upside down snowmen
04:58
but he said i just thought you'd like
05:00
this town that they are as rare as
05:01
sasquatch sightings
05:04
and there's probably never been one
05:07
um but anyway the way you make a snowman
05:09
is there are five types of snow in terms
05:11
of moisture and they are technically
05:13
named dry
05:14
moist wet very wet and slush
05:18
it's all about the ratio of free water
05:20
to actual ice so drought is absolutely
05:22
no fun around christmas time
05:26
i read an article on a website called
05:28
quartz.com and that was about how to
05:30
make the perfect snowman and they said
05:32
the temperature is very important
05:34
to higher temperature and the snow will
05:37
lack strength i.e it will be water
05:41
do we want to hear some more 16th
05:43
century snowmen yeah sure sure um
05:46
apparently michelangelo built a snowman
05:48
um he was commissioned to build one by
05:50
piero medici commissioned yeah
05:52
commission
05:53
so he was pierrot was like one of the
05:55
medicis but he wasn't like into art like
05:57
everyone else was and so he said to um
05:59
to michelangelo will just make me a
06:01
snowman then but apparently it's the
06:02
best snowman that anyone's ever seen oh
06:04
yeah yeah but everyone says that after
06:06
they've melted don't they
06:08
there's no burden of proof yeah some
06:10
people think that it was the basis or
06:11
they did it as a practice for david for
06:13
michelangelo's david just on the subject
06:16
of um snowmen and religion there was
06:18
this january there was a cleric in saudi
06:20
arabia who issued an edict banning
06:23
snowman from being built um i would
06:25
imagine not a massive problem in saudi
06:27
africa
06:29
but he said it i mean i'm sure they get
06:30
snow in some bits of the country
06:32
sometimes anyway he said it is not
06:33
permitted to make a statue out of snow
06:35
even by way of play and fun and he also
06:38
said it promotes lustiness and eroticism
06:40
only in brussels
06:44
um yeah so we're gonna have to move on
06:46
very soon to our next fact james you got
06:48
something else a student who built a
06:50
four-foot phallus out of steel
06:52
and the park was given a fixed penalty
06:54
of 80 pounds
06:56
so that was a thing um someone else
06:58
actually had like the worst news report
07:00
ever
07:03
so that was the thing um
07:05
here's andy with the weather
07:07
uh it's gonna be cold still i guess
07:09
back to you
07:10
if you want um there was another snow
07:12
fine actually
07:14
in 2013 police in germany gave a parking
07:17
ticket to a car covered in snow which
07:19
just turned out to be a snow sculpture
07:20
of a car
07:24
they issued the parking ticket and then
07:26
they realized once they issued it when
07:28
they tried to scrape the snow off to
07:29
reveal the number plate and it just kept
07:31
on going they must have kept thinking
07:33
this is a really small car
07:36
but the policeman's comment was um when
07:39
he realized that so they left the
07:40
parking ticket on it and the policeman
07:42
said we can take a joke as well as the
07:44
next person but whether it was made of
07:46
metal or snow it was still obstructing
07:48
the road and that should have been good
07:53
okay i'm going to move us on to our
07:55
second fact of the show and that is
07:57
chezinski yeah my fact today is that
08:00
harris hawks stand on each other's
08:02
shoulders to get a better view
08:04
um which is incredible so because also
08:07
considering they can fly
08:14
yeah so are they standing on the
08:16
shoulders of a flying bird or no they
08:18
sound like shadows when often they're
08:20
standing on a perch on a cactus or
08:21
something and i think and then the guy
08:22
on the cactus is like i can't quite see
08:24
over that tree and then could even stand
08:26
on my shoulders and they've been seen up
08:28
to like so usually it's two to three
08:30
hawks high you can get four hawks high
08:33
four hawks standing on each other's
08:34
shoulders it's amazing um and yeah we're
08:37
not entirely sure why why they do this
08:38
but it could be a number of reasons so
08:40
to get a good view of you know if you
08:41
want to look get a proper angle down on
08:43
your potential prey also to provide
08:45
shade i think so it's often the dominant
08:47
hawk which is on the bottom so it's
08:49
thought that the dominant hawk goes i'm
08:50
really hot someone needs to get on top
08:52
of me as like a he like a bird parasol
08:56
so that and also it might be because
08:58
perching spots are scarce
09:00
oh wait so they they open up their wings
09:02
they'll open up their wings yeah sorry
09:03
appreciation
09:04
yeah yeah so one of the ideas i think is
09:06
that they're on a cactus and it's hard
09:08
to find a bit of cactus that doesn't
09:09
have spikes on it and so when they do
09:11
find a bit with no spikes in it they're
09:13
like oh we're all going to sit there
09:14
yeah
09:15
yeah which is really annoying for the
09:17
one guy who found the cactus that had no
09:18
spikes
09:19
oh get off come on so who's in the
09:22
better position dominant hawk at the
09:23
bottom or a guy at the top well it's a
09:25
dominant hawks at the bottom i guess he
09:26
is if you've got three hawks on your
09:28
shoulders that's yeah it's gonna be
09:30
really heavy
09:31
well i have no i didn't interview any
09:33
hawks for this fact
09:35
but yeah it's called a stack
09:37
uh a hawk stack why why is that why is
09:39
that
09:41
it's one of those it's impossible to
09:43
trace about the etymology of
09:45
that use of that word there but
09:47
there's a theory that um hawks would
09:51
taste most like dinosaur out of anything
09:54
that we've got
09:56
because a lot of people have asked the
09:57
question what would a dinosaur taste
09:58
like and um there's i thought it would
10:00
taste like chicken well aha a common
10:03
misconception
10:05
and you're going to feel like an idiot
10:07
now
10:08
there's an article on slate.com by a guy
10:10
called brian palmer and he said that
10:12
actually meat flavor is also affected by
10:13
what the animal's been eating and
10:15
hormones it's not just on sort of the
10:17
the biology or the genes or something so
10:20
chickens don't eat meat so if you get a
10:22
bird which eats meat like a hawk or
10:24
another raptor then that's what
10:25
dinosaurs would taste like bit heavier
10:27
and darker also this is a really
10:30
interesting fact about harris hawks very
10:31
ornithologists out there um it's not
10:34
actually a harris hawk it should be
10:35
harris's hawk uh yeah that's my fact of
10:38
the day fact of the year i think
10:40
uh
10:41
it was discovered by audubon who was a
10:43
famous 19th century orthologist and he
10:45
named after his mate audubon named
10:47
harris's hawk after a guy called edward
10:49
harris and he was the one who funded a
10:52
book that this guy was writing which was
10:54
the the birds of america i believe it
10:55
was called and he discovered a number of
10:57
new species in that book i think is
10:59
something like 25 species he also named
11:02
eleven species of fish this is one of
11:04
the best revenge plots i've ever heard
11:06
in my life because none of those fish
11:08
exist okay
11:10
yeah i think it's
11:12
established good point
11:16
so he was basically he was at his home
11:18
and the guy who was writing the book on
11:20
the uh fish came over to his house and
11:22
while he was at his house he was telling
11:23
him about this book and how it's gonna
11:24
be the ultimate book on fish and while
11:27
they were chatting they saw a couple of
11:28
bats fly in and the fish guy thought
11:31
they were new species of bats or he was
11:32
scared of bats we're not quite sure but
11:34
he immediately grabbed audubon's violin
11:37
which was really expensive and smashed
11:39
them against the bats and audubon was
11:42
like what but he was toasting this guy
11:44
so the guy sat back down and then he
11:45
went
11:47
i know some fish that i've discovered
11:49
that you should include into your book
11:51
and he went fantastic what are they he
11:53
described them he drew them they went
11:54
into the book and then he got outed for
11:56
putting fake fish into his book isn't
11:57
that the biggest best revenge plot wow
12:02
yeah i really so like i was reading the
12:04
other day so hawks standing on shoulders
12:05
um i was reading about monkeys um i was
12:08
reading this book sapiens and they work
12:10
together as well and they have this
12:11
amazing thing a language that uh
12:13
zoologists have managed to isolate
12:14
certain calls so monkey's in isolation
12:16
they'll send a call out and the call
12:18
will say there's an eagle in the sky so
12:20
all the monkeys look up to see if it's
12:22
coming and then they'll play another
12:23
signal which says there's a tiger on the
12:25
way and so they all go up the tree but
12:27
then they've discovered that some
12:29
monkeys will be seeing another monkey
12:30
with a banana and go there's a tiger and
12:33
they'll leap up into the tree and you'll
12:34
just take the banana
12:36
yeah
12:37
so devious okay on that um this is very
12:40
very cool so um so mockingbirds make
12:42
alarm calls uh when they see a hawk and
12:46
iguanas
12:47
listen to mockingbirds they listen to a
12:48
completely different species of animal
12:50
and when the when the mockingbird makes
12:52
an alarm call the iguanas will run for
12:54
it because the iguanas can't tell each
12:55
other there's a hawk because they don't
12:58
they they're silent they don't
12:59
communicate with each other
13:01
they're all not talking to each other
13:02
but
13:04
they've just listened to the mockingbird
13:05
it's like it's like one of those things
13:06
where you're in a struck with someone so
13:07
you make someone else communicate with
13:08
them on your behalf
13:10
iguana i'm not talking to him
13:12
it's really sad you can just imagine two
13:13
iguanas facing each other and not able
13:15
to say how they feel and you know
13:18
if you swapped your eyes for a hawks
13:21
you'd be able to see an ant crawling on
13:23
the ground from the roof of a ten-story
13:25
building yeah but also you'd be arrested
13:28
immediately
13:30
but i can see an and that's still not
13:32
getting around a lot of wildlife
13:34
legislation so
13:36
well they're thinking about doing laser
13:37
eye surgery now to give us
13:39
much better vision which i think is
13:40
completely unnecessary aren't they so
13:42
hawks have like or eagles have 20 to 5
13:44
vision and they think they can get
13:46
humans up to 2010 vision which i don't
13:48
really see the need so 20 to 5 vision
13:50
means that something that i can see
13:52
that's five meters away a hawk could be
13:54
able to see that it's 20 meters away
13:55
yeah they could see it with the same
13:57
vision right so if james is on the top
13:58
floor of his 10-story house and he's
14:00
lost his pet and
14:02
this will come in handy
14:05
do you know that lobsters can regenerate
14:07
their eyes
14:08
but they can only do it a certain number
14:10
of times and after they've done it that
14:11
number of times instead of regenerating
14:13
an eye they regenerate a limb
14:18
do they regenerate the limb where the
14:19
eye once was
14:21
wow it's great that isn't it that's
14:23
insane
14:25
do they know how many times they've got
14:26
i don't think they do they probably
14:28
don't even know they're lobsters
14:35
imagine shaking hands with somebody's
14:37
eye
14:37
weird
14:40
i was i was trying to find your fact
14:42
anna because actually it's surprisingly
14:44
far uh hard to find that actual sentence
14:47
on the internet that hawks stand on each
14:48
other's shoulders and it was on a site
14:50
where it's like um there's a lot of
14:51
sites you get these days that are trying
14:53
to educate children about everything and
14:55
this was a super fun hawk page and there
14:58
was a bunch of stuff about hawks and
15:00
then it said extra fun facts and so the
15:02
opening one was backstanding so they
15:04
stand on each other that was that was
15:06
one and this is the second extra fun
15:08
fact
15:09
they gather in large groups and
15:11
congregate
15:12
on the electrical transformers were they
15:14
electrocuted to death
15:18
science is fun
15:23
they are kind of the bad guys of the
15:25
natural world hawks um so people don't
15:27
like them and a lot of people like this
15:29
video online which you should all look
15:30
up actually there are a few videos of
15:32
smaller birds who are usually preyed
15:33
upon by hawks attacking a hawk so it was
15:36
a mother king bird and a hawk came a bit
15:37
too near her nest and she jumps on the
15:40
hawk's back and like grips onto his
15:43
shoulders and then pecks away at his
15:44
forehead and the hawk flies through the
15:46
air nothing he can do
15:48
this is similar i just read this the
15:50
other day um that seagulls attack whales
15:53
which is another kind of little thing
15:55
against the country
15:56
[Laughter]
15:59
no like you get seagulls and they go
16:00
down there's like a whale that's kind of
16:02
near the surface and the seagulls will
16:04
come down and just grab a bit of flesh
16:06
from the side of the wire wow i know
16:08
would whales ever deal with a flying
16:10
animal uh would they get back down and
16:12
tell a story like you won't believe what
16:14
just happened out there it was a thing
16:16
literally in the air like a really
16:18
really small flying whale up there
16:21
like how do you know you're a whale
16:25
did you know that a hawk is terrorizing
16:27
the people of manchester at the moment
16:30
a massive bird
16:32
named steven reported by the manchester
16:34
evening news been named stephen by
16:36
residents who hate him so i don't know
16:37
why they've given him a name who stands
16:39
on street lights screeching at people uh
16:41
it says the massive bird named steven is
16:43
known by experts for its intelligence i
16:45
think it means hawks generally are known
16:46
for their intelligence not stephen
16:48
specifically um but stephanie milling uh
16:51
who lives just off polar street in
16:52
manchester said it's been hunting and
16:54
catching wood pigeons but it keeps
16:56
trying to get my cat and i have a friend
16:58
nearby who has pet rabbits so we call
17:00
each other every now and again saying
17:02
steven's out get your rabbit
17:05
james's ant farm is in serious
17:08
serious trouble uh we need to move on to
17:10
the next fact and that is andrew hunter
17:13
murray okay my fact this week is that
17:16
pope innocent viii was given the
17:18
nickname the honest because he was the
17:20
first pope to acknowledge that he had
17:21
illegitimate children
17:25
they should have called him innocent a
17:26
smoothie oh
17:29
come on those of you who heard the
17:30
podcast you knew what you were coming
17:32
from
17:34
um so
17:35
those who haven't you can leave now
17:38
no refunds
17:40
um so in the old days and this uh
17:43
innocent the eighth was uh 15th century
17:45
so ages ago back in the days when you
17:46
had a very like naughty popes and there
17:48
was an amazing spell of naughty popes um
17:51
it sounds like candy's weather forecast
17:53
together we'll be having a spell of
17:54
naughty punk
17:56
look your rabbits up
17:57
[Laughter]
17:59
pope stephen is out
18:00
[Laughter]
18:03
um
18:04
so
18:05
normally when popes had illegitimate
18:07
children and in the renaissance and the
18:09
middle ages loads of them had
18:10
illegitimate children um they would just
18:12
say they were their nephews and nieces
18:14
uh even though they clearly weren't they
18:16
so they used it to get them jobs uh but
18:18
innocent viii acknowledged this and then
18:21
he still used his position to get his
18:22
children jobs he made his 13 year old
18:24
grandson a cardinal
18:27
wow yeah when i was looking him up i
18:30
looked at his wikipedia page and you got
18:32
a lot of links at the bottom to other
18:34
related articles on wikipedia and one of
18:36
them led me to this is the title list of
18:39
sexually active popes
18:42
and it is a massive list
18:45
they were active they were going for it
18:48
yeah they were they were wild that so
18:50
this fact kind of reminds me of like i
18:52
think that um modern day or maybe it's
18:55
always existed uh elevating honesty way
18:58
too high so that whole i really want to
19:00
be honest with you
19:01
i've shagged your dad uh that kind of
19:03
thing which is right
19:06
firstly which of the three of us were
19:08
speaking to
19:13
[Laughter]
19:17
the wikipedia list list of dads
19:24
it just says yours yours yours
19:30
so yeah you don't need to know that um
19:32
and in fact there were popes who shagged
19:34
uh so benedict the ninth was a
19:36
particularly bad one who
19:38
was responsible for copious bestiality
19:42
um sodomy sponsoring orgies sponsoring
19:45
ordinances
19:46
this orgy is brought to you
19:49
by the
19:50
pope have a good time
19:56
i'm just imagining like uh hi i'm
19:58
thinking of having an analogy next week
19:59
would you mind sponsoring me
20:03
you can get 10p
20:05
benedict the ninth is amazing he was
20:06
pope on three separate occasions he
20:09
became pope at the age of like really
20:10
really young some sources say he was 11
20:12
when he became pope i can't quite but
20:14
there's a lot of um propaganda though so
20:16
he may not have done but he did sell the
20:18
papacy to his godfather to raise money
20:20
for his wedding and then he got bored
20:22
and decided no actually i'd like to be
20:23
pope again
20:25
yeah he was crazy i was reading through
20:27
the list of popes because those um a lot
20:28
of them share the same names john
20:31
pope john paul and so on um
20:34
[Laughter]
20:39
and um there's i mean there's amazing
20:41
names to start with they're incredible
20:42
names my favorite one was pope hilarious
20:46
that's an actual pope hilarious
20:49
um
20:50
did you look into pope hilarious to see
20:52
what hilarious things he did oh he was
20:54
so boring i really i was desperate i
20:56
spent the majority of my research going
20:58
come on one thing
20:59
i've gone the other thing i could find
21:01
was he erected a chapel a convent and
21:03
two public baths yeah but he had to be
21:05
there it was hilarious at the time
21:07
one of my favorite popes is uh benedict
21:10
the 12th
21:11
and what happened with him is the
21:13
cardinals when they were deciding who
21:14
was going to be pope what they would
21:15
often do is in the first round of votes
21:18
they would all vote for someone who's
21:19
probably not going to become pope
21:21
because they're a bit rubbish
21:22
and then they would think well no one
21:24
else will vote for them and they'll see
21:25
how the other cardinals are voting
21:27
unfortunately everyone voted for
21:28
benedict xii
21:30
was it good uh no
21:35
um pope john the twelfth turned the
21:37
vatican or the papal uh palace into a
21:40
whorehouse apparently committing
21:41
adultery with numerous women that
21:42
included his father's long-term
21:44
girlfriend and i like that because this
21:46
is the 10th century and i don't i didn't
21:48
know you had long-term girlfriends in
21:49
the 10th century
21:51
i thought you were married or you were
21:53
single
21:54
or dead
21:56
popular choice in the 10th century
21:58
maybe he invented the idea of long-term
22:00
girlfriend but never gets recognized for
22:02
it because he was the pope and they were
22:04
focusing on that bit of his story
22:07
i think that i'm not because a lot of
22:08
these stories i'm not sure
22:10
there's all this yeah there's a lot of
22:12
sort of rather than put in from the
22:13
detractors of the smearing of
22:15
reputations yeah yeah so there's also
22:17
the thing of um they might have been
22:19
made up by an anti-pope who was
22:22
not a not as you would think a pope made
22:24
out of
22:24
antimatter are made out of ants i was
22:27
thinking
22:29
um sort of a rival pope who would set up
22:31
a separate court elsewhere uh somewhere
22:33
in france or even somewhere in italy and
22:35
say i'm the pope and then spread
22:37
horrible rumors about the answer yeah
22:38
yeah yeah although like celibacy in the
22:41
church really didn't become uh the
22:43
absolute norm for an extremely long time
22:46
until about two or three hundred years
22:47
ago um and it's thought so until i think
22:49
there's a council of trent ruling in
22:51
1563 that really said seriously clerics
22:54
you have to stop having sex we've been
22:56
saying this for 1500 years no one's
22:58
listened um
23:00
but they kept on doing it and actually
23:01
the reason that the um that eventually
23:03
passed in the council of trent the
23:04
reason that uh members of the clergy in
23:06
the catholic church can't have sex is
23:09
because there were so many illegitimate
23:11
children and they were taking the church
23:12
property and passing it on to their
23:14
children so it was going out of the
23:16
church because they'd be like i guess
23:17
this church is mine i'll just give it to
23:18
my son um and so the church was like
23:20
we've got to stop this got to keep our
23:22
property and so they said sorry you're
23:23
not allowed to have sex but protestants
23:25
were very pro-sex at the time so martin
23:29
luther who's sort of founder of the
23:30
reformation thought that it was really
23:33
bad uh the whole celibacy vowel thing
23:35
because it encouraged masturbation and
23:37
as he said martin luther founder of uh i
23:40
guess the protestant church if it
23:42
doesn't go into a woman it goes into
23:43
your shirt
23:45
what
23:47
and we can't be having that
23:48
this was before the invention of the
23:50
tissue so
23:52
that's a terrible
23:54
sentence it's good isn't it
23:56
it sounds a bit like the start of a song
23:59
if it doesn't go into a woman
24:07
[Laughter]
24:13
very quickly looking into so he was
24:16
called the honest as a sort of nickname
24:18
and i love history's nicknames ivan the
24:20
terrible uh and so on joan of arc does
24:22
that work
24:23
[Music]
24:26
but my favorite one this is a this is a
24:28
king louie the unavoidable
24:32
you might just imagine seeing him at a
24:33
party oh no
24:36
oh he's coming over he's coming over
24:38
he's coming over
24:40
oh louie
24:42
hi
24:43
good
24:45
you still king
24:46
yeah
24:47
oh yeah yeah
24:48
all right i'm gonna move us on to our
24:50
final fact of the show and that is my
24:52
fact my fact this week is that spanish
24:55
construction workers recently
24:57
accidentally destroyed a 6 thousand year
24:59
old neolithic tomb that looked like a
25:01
picnic table and replaced it with a new
25:04
and better looking picnic table
25:10
and it's incredible you can see the
25:12
photo so the photo is of a of a
25:14
stone sort of it looks like a big table
25:16
with surrounding chairs so i mean their
25:19
fault really and then they've replaced
25:21
it and the new one sorry therefore the
25:22
neolithic people's fault for making
25:24
their tune like a picnic table okay when
25:26
you say it like that yeah retract that
25:28
statement but you look at the new
25:29
picture and it's this really nice
25:32
looking picnic table i mean actually
25:34
it's actually really nice what happened
25:35
is they didn't know that it was a
25:36
heritage site property and they saw it
25:38
and just thought oh the poor people here
25:40
they won't have a nice picnic let's do
25:42
something good for them and then got in
25:44
serious trouble for ruining it i read
25:46
that one local architect said it was
25:48
probably due to a miscommunication
25:49
because it was the summer holidays
25:51
[Laughter]
25:53
it's so tragic yeah and also in the
25:55
summer holidays demand for picnic tables
25:57
rockets yes
25:58
so they did this global survey global
26:01
they did in china of the uh the great
26:02
wall of china and what they found was
26:05
there was a huge missing chunk of the
26:06
great wall of china and they had no idea
26:07
where it went and the town just down the
26:09
road someone must have gone i found this
26:11
wall full of bricks they built a whole
26:13
town out of the great wall of china
26:16
yeah it's incredible that is the only
26:17
town you can see from space
26:21
a man in central ohio has been arrested
26:24
for having sex with a picnic table
26:26
here's andy with the weather
26:29
yeah um he would stand the small metal
26:32
table on its side and use the hole where
26:34
the umbrella should be to have sex ah
26:37
can't be a it can't be a
26:39
happy experience
26:43
perhaps this is um more common amongst
26:45
certain uh parts of society than we
26:47
think because there's actually a man in
26:48
tennessee as well who was arrested for
26:49
the same thing and he was arrested so he
26:52
was initially arrested a 49 year old man
26:53
because he was making an unusual deposit
26:56
at the atm nearby
26:58
uh so attempting to copulate with the
27:00
atm what was wrong with this shirt
27:06
cannot think of which bit of an atm
27:08
with a gun to my head i would pick
27:12
i haven't done it but um
27:16
officers arrived and they took him
27:17
outside of the bank and sat him on a
27:19
picnic table and went back into it
27:22
[Laughter]
27:24
and another guy came and went sorry are
27:25
you using this because i
27:27
i thought it was bad when wasps turned
27:29
up in a picnic
27:33
how i've been getting lucky all these
27:35
years
27:37
um
27:37
on speaking of things that have been
27:39
ruined
27:40
[Laughter]
27:42
your ears ladies and gentlemen
27:45
no um so i read a story about john
27:48
lennon and when he um he used to he had
27:50
a period which was known as the lost
27:52
weekend longer than a weekend but it's
27:53
where he just went absolutely off the
27:56
rail he was doing lots of drugs he was
27:58
partying all night long in in all over
28:00
la and he stayed at hugh hefner's uh
28:03
house for a party and he didn't stay
28:06
there so he was at a party and while he
28:07
was there he was so drunk and he was
28:09
smoking a cigarette he didn't have
28:11
anywhere to put the cigarette out on so
28:13
he decided the matisse that was hanging
28:15
on the wall would be the nice spot for
28:17
it so he stubbed his cigarette into this
28:19
matisse so all the bouncers bodyguards
28:22
of hugh hefner's playboy mansions
28:24
immediately grabbed him to throw him out
28:26
and hugh hefner went no no no stop stop
28:28
it's fine it's fine like did you see
28:30
what he just did he's like i didn't see
28:31
it i just heard about it but guys
28:33
john lennon just stubbed the cigarette
28:35
out on my matisse that is probably worth
28:36
double the amount of money now that
28:38
you're there but take them around the
28:39
whole house i got a picasso in the back
28:41
room
28:42
i mean that's quite cool when value is
28:43
added through destruction yeah wow on
28:46
other things being accidentally
28:48
destroyed
28:49
bungling builders as they refer to you
28:52
when they mess up uh
28:54
accidentally destroyed the wrong house
28:57
in cumbria it destroyed a woman's home
28:59
instead of the dilapidated house a few
29:00
streets away um contractors were
29:03
supposed to demolish another house 500
29:04
yards away in another street but set to
29:06
work on mrs beatty's home without
29:08
checking they had the right address
29:11
thomas armstrong construction limited
29:12
admits they got it wrong but mrs beatty
29:15
is still considering legal action
29:19
mrs beatty when will you end this
29:20
vendetta
29:24
in 2013 there was a pair of peruvian
29:27
real estate companies which destroyed a
29:30
pyramid a small one it was six meters
29:32
high but nonetheless it was a pyramid
29:34
and it was four thousand years old as
29:35
well um and the company's workers tried
29:37
to destroy three more pyramids before
29:40
people who are on looking stop them okay
29:42
get this in the same year 2013 another
29:45
construction company in belize bulldozed
29:48
one of the largest mayan pyramids in the
29:50
country it was 30 meters tall and they
29:52
did it just to get crushed rock for road
29:54
building
29:55
and one of the head of the belize
29:57
institute of archaeology said at the
29:59
time these guys knew that this was an
30:00
ancient structure it's just bloody
30:02
laziness
30:03
it was it they just couldn't be bothered
30:05
to go and get other rock from elsewhere
30:07
that wasn't a pyramid rock shop was
30:09
another two miles away
30:11
that's incredible this happens all the
30:12
time the sort of you know small pyramids
30:14
in central and south america get uh
30:16
really yeah
30:18
isn't it true that one of shakespeare's
30:19
houses i think it was his most famous
30:20
house um the guy who owned it was so
30:23
annoyed of people coming and knocking on
30:25
his door that he just knocked it down
30:27
yeah he was it's
30:29
called the reverend gastro law gaskell
30:31
or something like that yeah and he lived
30:32
there and people just kept going past
30:34
going shakespeare's house and he's like
30:35
nah i've had enough of that it's not
30:37
that big an imposition is it yeah also
30:40
move yeah
30:42
he had to because he got driven out of
30:44
the town i think yeah he did yeah and
30:46
also he destroyed his house so he would
30:47
have to move anyway
30:50
uh we're gonna have to wrap up very soon
30:52
um just a quick thing on picnics yeah of
30:54
course um i looked up you know the
30:55
phrase this is no picnic um it took 190
30:58
years after the first french use of the
31:00
word picnic before we got the phrase
31:02
this is no picnic so i just like to
31:04
imagine that people were having a
31:05
constant picnic for 190 years
31:09
there's this common misconception that
31:11
the word picnic the etymology is racist
31:14
it's one of those like internet rumors
31:15
that started about the year 2000 that
31:17
actually a picnic used to be where you'd
31:19
go to watch like lynching of slaves
31:21
which just isn't true so um in the year
31:23
2000 at the university of albany they
31:26
wanted to organize the university wanted
31:27
to organize a picnic a big celebratory
31:29
picnic for the students but they were
31:30
told that it would offend people because
31:32
it was a racist term so instead they
31:35
decided we'll call it an outing um and
31:37
then they were written to and informed
31:39
them
31:41
this would this would offend people
31:42
because it was a homophobic term and so
31:45
eventually the picnic was publicized
31:46
without a title
31:47
[Laughter]
31:50
i didn't know this just on picnics and
31:51
picnic tables paris the way paris
31:53
celebrated the millennium was by having
31:55
a 600 mile long picnic wow wow really
31:58
imagine being that guy who found picnic
32:00
table sexually attractive
32:02
turns up in paris that weekend and he's
32:04
gone to paris to get away from the
32:06
picnic
32:08
finally a new life under a new identity
32:11
oh my god
32:16

=86
00:09
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:12
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:14
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:16
covent garden my name is dan schreiber
00:18
i'm sitting here with james harkin andy
00:20
murray and today's special guest it's
00:22
author of a new book called male
00:24
obsession it's mark mason and once again
00:26
we have gathered around the microphones
00:27
with our four favorite facts from the
00:29
last seven days and in no particular
00:31
order here we go starting with you andy
00:34
murray my fact is that for the queen's
00:36
coronation people dressed up as
00:38
television sets
00:40
[Music]
00:41
she's past the giggle test standing
00:43
um so this is i read this in an article
00:45
by the historian kate williams in the
00:47
observer and um it seems to come from a
00:50
book of um policemen's memoirs or the
00:53
one of the first female beat police
00:55
officers um wrote a book of memoirs
00:56
about her experiences and she describes
00:58
it and i think a couple of other sources
01:00
say it as well yeah so this is because
01:02
it was such a huge thing for it to be
01:03
televised televisions were bought in
01:06
huge numbers across the country for the
01:07
coronation i think 20 million people
01:10
watched and on average there were 17
01:13
people watching each tv set and you
01:15
think of tvs at the time they were tiny
01:17
you know screens a few inches from
01:19
corner to corner um so you would just go
01:21
to the person in your street who had a
01:23
tv and yeah exactly do you know what
01:24
went up in sales as well so tvs went up
01:26
massively in sales and so did massive
01:29
magnifying glasses
01:30
so that they could magnify it so that
01:32
more people could come and see really i
01:34
got that from kate williams's twitter
01:36
stream they were specially made weren't
01:37
they they made special rectangular ones
01:39
that were made to fit on to the front of
01:41
the casing for your television which of
01:43
course in those days was a big piece of
01:44
furniture yeah they made them especially
01:45
that is fantastic the thing about tvs
01:48
going up in numbers is definitely true
01:50
um but
01:51
in 1950 there were 400 000 tv licenses
01:54
in 51 there were 700 000 and in 53 there
01:57
were 1 million 100 000 so they did go up
02:00
when the coronation was on but actually
02:02
they had been going up for quite a long
02:04
time so it wasn't just the coronation
02:05
that caused the big increase in tv
02:07
sounds yeah right i think it's true that
02:09
the one part of the ceremony that wasn't
02:11
shown because it would be seen as two
02:13
you know there was a big debate about
02:14
whether you should be televising
02:15
something like this full stop did it
02:16
demean the occasion but they didn't show
02:18
the actual coronation moment where the
02:20
crowns put on her head i i think it was
02:22
i think that was actually tradition
02:23
though because i read about this where
02:25
they hold a the canopy above her head
02:27
and it's a secret part no one knows what
02:29
happens in that part i think i have a
02:31
good idea which is that the crown goes
02:32
on to the head no no
02:34
because there's more because they
02:35
there's the spoon and the spoon you have
02:37
to explain the archbishop of canterbury
02:39
spoons the queen
02:40
[Laughter]
02:41
or king
02:43
so is it only the archbishop and the
02:45
queen under the canopy at that time
02:47
yeah they make a den
02:51
all we know is what we can make out from
02:53
the silhouettes of the flashlights going
02:54
on on the inside but there's definitely
02:56
a spoon
02:57
that's what we see so the ceremonial
02:59
spoon comes out okay and oil is poured
03:04
anointing oil anointing stuff i think
03:06
yeah and uh so and apparently it's the
03:08
only surviving thing from the middle
03:09
ages this is this is part of the
03:11
tradition it's the only thing that's
03:12
made its way through he anoints her
03:14
forehead her breast and her hands
03:17
are you saying that during the
03:18
coronation
03:19
the archbishop of canterbury oiled up
03:21
the queen's press
03:24
according to
03:25
according to what i read yeah
03:28
what is definitely true about the
03:29
archbishop of canterbury on that
03:30
occasion 1953 was that he had to give
03:33
the queen a push to get her started
03:36
when she practiced she
03:38
pinned heavy
03:40
curtains to her shoulders to simulate
03:42
the coronation road when it came to the
03:43
real thing the coronation robes were
03:45
even heavier than she expected and she
03:47
couldn't get because she's quite a small
03:49
woman she was 20 whatever she was then
03:50
she said that she whispered to the
03:52
archbishop of canterbury give me a shot
03:54
i think the exact phrase was to get me
03:55
started that's it give me a shout out
03:58
wow and that's very cool more on the
04:00
archbishop at the time who was a very
04:02
interesting guy george fisher um so he
04:05
was dead against it being televised
04:09
for a number of reasons he thought it
04:10
might demean the occasion and he really
04:13
wanted people to uh join in for the hymn
04:15
if they were watching at home and stand
04:17
up for the homage part of the ceremony
04:20
um and there was so much debate about
04:21
this all across the country one npr said
04:23
in the house of commons might there even
04:25
be something unseemly in the chance that
04:27
a viewer could watch this solemn and
04:28
significant service with a cup of tea at
04:31
his elbow
04:33
i like the fact that they installed
04:35
extra toilets in the ab because there
04:36
were so many guests and also tv crews
04:38
and everyone working on it they
04:40
installed extra toilets at the abbey and
04:43
then did a sound check to check that if
04:45
by chance they were all flushed at the
04:47
same time the bbc's microphones wouldn't
04:50
pick them up wow that's preparation yeah
04:54
and the choir boys were given packed
04:56
lunches containing peanut butter and
04:58
marmalade sandwiches to have the
05:00
opposite effect from uh you know making
05:03
them go to they wanted to bung them up
05:04
so they wouldn't need to go to the
05:05
toilet and they were also given really
05:07
big drinks canisters so that once they'd
05:09
had their drink
05:10
if they needed to you to refill that
05:12
drinks canister it would save them
05:14
having fun that's so good did they um
05:16
find out what the sound of 200 quiet
05:18
boys peeing into the canister sounded
05:20
like could the bbc mike's pick that up
05:22
yeah i think this is quite well known
05:23
but i didn't know it uh keith richards
05:25
was one of the choir boys at the
05:27
conversation well i'm afraid and it
05:29
turns out that it keith was certainly a
05:31
great choir boy certainly sang for the
05:33
queen but they think a couple of years
05:35
later it wasn't actually at the
05:36
coroner's which is so disappointing has
05:38
no one asked him
05:41
no one can understand the answer
05:44
um i think he would have been
05:46
sick
05:47
and he would have been a bit young this
05:49
is where my inner nerd comes out he was
05:50
born december the 18th 1943. so yeah he
05:53
would have been nice so he would have
05:54
been the right age though oh yeah he was
05:55
certainly in the ballpark but not in the
05:57
abbey
05:58
um that was so nerdy mark coming on to
06:01
our podcast well if anyone has not read
06:03
keith richards autobiography it is fine
06:05
in my mind it's the best book of no
06:06
mine's just out it's the second best
06:08
book but no yours is out it's the third
06:09
best book of the 21st century we've got
06:11
two out this year and it's the fourth
06:13
best we keep going um
06:15
there's one cool bit of the coronation
06:17
which um
06:19
didn't happen for victoria in fact
06:21
victoria was the first person that
06:22
didn't happen for okay so have you heard
06:24
about the queen's champion
06:26
no
06:27
okay so in medieval um coronations and
06:30
victoria's was the first coronation this
06:32
didn't happen for so everyone before
06:33
then it happened um the queen's champion
06:36
or the king's champion is a noble and
06:38
for the post-coronation banquet this
06:40
person would come in in full armor
06:42
and throw down his gauntlet and then
06:44
challenge anyone to a fight if they said
06:48
the sovereign was not fit to rule or
06:49
didn't have the right to rule wow i
06:51
think i should bring that back it's so
06:53
good i reckon brian blessed his bomb
06:55
yes exactly there is still a queen's
06:57
champion so it's a hereditary position
06:59
even though they don't do any
06:59
correlations anymore um he's called
07:01
francis and he's a chartered accountant
07:03
[Laughter]
07:04
um his full name is frank uh francis
07:07
john feign marmion dimock
07:09
and as far as i can tell as it's
07:11
hereditary title he is the current
07:13
queen's champion how does he look like
07:16
um he just looks like a nice man
07:18
you can't actually tell how he looks
07:19
because he's wearing a full suit of
07:20
armor at all times
07:23
what can it do
07:24
[Laughter]
07:27
who challenges the queen's right to rule
07:31
because the one thing that did happen at
07:32
the queen's coronation dinner that
07:34
hadn't happened before was that uh her
07:36
mother as she became the queen mother
07:38
wouldn't let her have too much to drink
07:40
she remember you have to rain all
07:42
afternoon she didn't want her daughter
07:44
getting drunk
07:45
and also of course coronation chicken
07:47
was invented for the occasion that's
07:48
where it gets its name it was specially
07:50
created right though
07:52
it's very similar to jubilee chicken
07:55
which was invented a few years earlier
07:56
for the silver jubilee of george the
07:58
fifth oh is it um which is basically
08:01
chicken with mayonnaise and spices
08:03
and pretty much exactly the same thing
08:05
but then they let's say reinvented it
08:07
for the um coronation so i always call
08:09
it jubilee chicken when i go can i have
08:12
a jubilee chicken panino please
08:14
[Laughter]
08:17
um do you know that on that day when
08:19
they dressed in as tv sets that's not
08:22
the only thing that they dressed as no
08:24
they dressed as mount everest as well
08:27
yeah well it had been conquered the day
08:28
before exactly and the news had come
08:30
through so they were celebrating a
08:31
number of things and mount everest was a
08:33
massive celebration so people were
08:35
dressed as tv sets and mount everest
08:37
that's amazing yeah
08:39
what a big news day
08:40
yeah everest and a coronation on the
08:43
same day that's massive yeah
08:45
do you know there's a conspiracy that we
08:47
didn't know that hillary didn't get to
08:49
the top of mount everest really yeah and
08:51
it's actually really interesting the
08:53
reason why so
08:54
the way that the news got broken to the
08:57
british public was via a journalist
08:59
called james morris who has changed sex
09:01
and is now jan morris one of the most
09:03
famous travel writers alive now jan
09:06
morris got the scoop was there when
09:08
hillary came down when he said the words
09:10
we knocked the bastard off george uh and
09:13
got the scoop now here was the thing she
09:15
didn't know how to get or he at the time
09:17
didn't know how to get the message back
09:19
without it being infiltrated and then
09:21
spread around the world because he
09:22
wanted the scoop so what he ended up
09:24
sending was a coded message that he'd
09:25
pre-arranged to be sent back and this
09:27
was the message that actually went back
09:29
the message went snow conditions bad
09:31
stop advanced base abandoned yesterday
09:34
stop awaiting improvement so the message
09:36
was to say that they haven't made it wow
09:38
and people actually think that he was
09:40
telling the truth message did he send if
09:42
they didn't make it then
09:44
good news everyone
09:48
that's a good point yeah
09:52
[Music]
09:53
okay time for fact number two and that
09:55
is james okay my fact this week is that
09:58
the world puddle jumping championships
10:01
bans fizzy drinks in case they improve
10:04
participants performance
10:06
talk us through the science behind it
10:09
well it's weird because on qi we have
10:11
said that fizzy drinks don't make
10:13
children more hyperactive and in the
10:15
world puddle jumping championships it's
10:16
usually children in fact it's always
10:18
children taking part but they think that
10:20
if you give them fizzy drinks then they
10:21
will become more excitable more
10:23
hyperactive and it could enable them to
10:26
jump higher and make bigger splashes
10:28
than other competitors and they don't
10:30
encourage people to drink fizzy drinks
10:31
because it's not good for you and so
10:33
they've decided to ban it i think that's
10:35
very sweet apart from the ban element of
10:37
it yeah
10:39
it could be a placebo thing couldn't if
10:40
you've heard your parents and reading
10:41
the news that it makes you jump better
10:43
then that could happen well what we've
10:44
said on qi and i can't remember quite
10:46
the science behind it is that the
10:47
children um actually act exactly the
10:50
same but it's the adults who then kind
10:52
of fuss around them and think oh they're
10:54
hyperactive they're hyperactive and when
10:55
you get someone who's watching the
10:58
events happening who doesn't know
10:59
whether or not they've had fizzy drinks
11:01
they can't tell the difference with the
11:02
children how do they monitor it though
11:04
like how do you test for fizzy drink
11:07
is it a p sample
11:09
i think they just ban them from the
11:11
general area of the competition so maybe
11:13
you could like stock up on red bull the
11:15
night before before
11:17
yeah that's true well i was reading the
11:18
metro the metro um newspaper yeah i
11:21
covered this and they the the line they
11:23
used was this is not the first time
11:25
sporting contests have been marred by
11:26
doping associations
11:28
lance armstrong was stripped from seven
11:32
so what they do is it's based on height
11:35
of jump enthusiasm distance of splash
11:38
and stickability
11:39
which is the amount of mud which clings
11:41
to each competitor all those different
11:43
things my favorite element of that is
11:45
enthusiasm is being marked that's
11:48
basically code for as with any event
11:49
where you're giving prizes to kids the
11:51
one that looks most likely to burst into
11:53
tears if it doesn't win against the win
11:55
because i think you just don't want a
11:56
scene it'd be good in the olympics if
11:58
the most enthusiastic competitors got
12:00
something in in the um tour de france
12:02
they'll give it whoever is the the most
12:04
aggressive on the day they'll give a
12:06
prize to even if they don't win really
12:08
yeah but someone who's like kicked other
12:10
spiciness
12:11
off the track no aggression in this case
12:14
means that you're making attacks earlier
12:16
and trying to try to move the race
12:18
onwards yeah right okay the whole notion
12:21
of jumping forget all this thing about
12:22
cricket being in the olympics i want the
12:24
campaign to put the standing long jump
12:25
back into the olympics
12:27
because it used to be in until 1912 i
12:29
think uh and the record is still going
12:31
even though not in the olympics the
12:32
record for the standing long jump was
12:34
broken earlier this year 23rd february
12:36
2015 the dallas cowboys cornerback did a
12:39
standing long jump of 12 feet two and
12:42
three quarter inches which is the length
12:43
of the snooker table from a standing but
12:45
then the other bizarre thing about the
12:47
standing long jump is that it is a
12:48
condition of entry to serving the
12:50
brazilian police
12:52
to serve in the brazilian police you
12:54
have to do a stat if you're a man you
12:55
need to be able to do a standing long
12:56
jump of 2.14 meters if you're a woman
12:59
1.66 wow there's no way i could do that
13:02
that's great that's incredible i
13:03
couldn't what do you reckon you could do
13:04
standing long jump should we do it and
13:06
then
13:07
say what our scars are
13:08
okay we're going to do a quick cut here
13:15
that was really fun
13:16
right anyway
13:19
so we're still recording and we found
13:21
out that andy is the best at the
13:23
standing long jump by about
13:26
five centimeters yeah i mean
13:28
and we all reckon we were getting around
13:30
two meters so we don't think we can get
13:32
into the brazilian but only by a few
13:34
centimeters so if we work on it we might
13:36
be able to do it did we make it into the
13:38
brazilian ladies army yes we did 1.66
13:40
get in
13:42
all right
13:43
okay i want to do some things about
13:45
drugs
13:46
and performance enhancing drugs so um
13:49
peta corda who's a tennis player uh he
13:52
tested positive for the steroid
13:54
nandrollon in wimbledon in 1998 but he
13:57
blamed it on having eaten too much
13:59
steroid fed veal okay but it turned out
14:02
that if he had eaten enough feel to be
14:06
tested positive he would have had to
14:08
have eaten 40 calves a day for 20 years
14:10
to have such a high level
14:13
and there was an olympic gold medalist
14:15
called dennis mitchell
14:16
who tested positive for high
14:18
testosterone and he claimed that it was
14:20
because he consumed five beers the night
14:22
before and had sex with his wife four
14:25
times that's ridiculous no one can have
14:27
five beers
14:31
if i was the real guy and i was being
14:34
investigated i like to think that i
14:36
would have tried to prove that and when
14:38
the investigators were coming around i
14:39
would have ordered a load of calves
14:41
i've been constantly using a car
14:44
just all over my house and my garden
14:46
full of carbs yeah
14:49
this park where they had this puddle
14:51
jumping i think it's called wick steed
14:52
park that's right and wix deeds make
14:54
playgrounds yep yeah did you hear about
14:57
the guy charles wick's deed yeah this is
14:59
incredible this is the best thing about
15:00
the fact i think he invented the slide
15:04
and the swing two things two things two
15:07
things that was a good morning wasn't it
15:08
yeah
15:10
he invented the slide give us more
15:12
details here andy well he people say
15:14
that he invented the modern slide now i
15:16
have found a source which disputes this
15:17
and points out there are a couple of
15:19
earlier things in new york which look a
15:21
lot like slides
15:23
yeah so it's possible that he didn't
15:25
invent the very first slide he
15:26
definitely came up with a version of it
15:28
for his park um
15:30
and he also invented the modern swing
15:33
which you get in playgrounds and his
15:34
first version have you seen it the the
15:36
the top um bar is almost four meters off
15:39
the ground it looks incredibly dangerous
15:42
yeah you can there's photos have been on
15:44
earth i don't know if you've ever seen
15:45
the sort of extreme swinging it's kind
15:47
of like that i think i've seen extremes
15:49
swinging
15:52
just google that anyone at home you
15:53
don't grow up in the suburbs and not sir
15:57
but what he kind of also pioneered was
15:59
the idea of the playground and this park
16:01
where the puddle jumping competition was
16:03
held is the park where the first ever
16:05
playground was built and he used pipes
16:07
from world war one eddie turned them
16:09
into swings so they became the first
16:11
swings and you can see the first slides
16:13
as well they're really interesting the
16:14
first slides were polished planks of
16:15
wood with no sides you just went down a
16:18
plank of wood risking a broken leg and
16:20
splinters yeah so exactly yeah and kids
16:22
you can see them going down it and it's
16:24
just very dangerous they were also
16:25
gender segregated
16:27
one for boys and one for girls
16:29
yeah he said later on that was an
16:31
old-fashioned he really he realized that
16:33
was an old-fashioned notion and he he
16:35
abandoned that um
16:36
segregation um and so they know where
16:38
the oldest modern day swing then in the
16:40
world is and it's not in the park it's
16:41
in the backyard of charles um
16:43
wicksteed's home which they discovered
16:45
not too long ago and it was his
16:46
prototype and so now that we know
16:49
officially the oldest swing in the world
16:51
it's so cool and it's still working
16:53
still working
16:54
but no it's not like an iphone that goes
16:56
out there
17:00
[Applause]
17:00
[Music]
17:02
okay time for fact number three and that
17:04
is mark my fact is that the shuttle
17:07
[ __ ] used in professional badminton are
17:09
made using real goose feathers which are
17:11
always taken from the bird's left wing
17:14
wow so i i kind of knew that it was
17:17
taken from an animal i thought it was
17:19
duck
17:20
i think ducks can be used in your
17:21
defense right i don't think that's the
17:22
stupidest mistake anyone's ever made
17:25
but um i didn't know the left's
17:27
wing yeah well apparently they if they
17:29
use if you get from the left wing that
17:31
makes the shuttlecock spin clockwise if
17:34
you take them from the right wing it
17:35
makes the shuttlecock spin
17:36
anti-clockwise
17:38
and they're obviously used to playing
17:39
with a clockwise spin and that's why
17:41
they keep using those wings so if you
17:43
have one which was half with feathers
17:45
from the left wing and a half from the
17:46
right wing would it not spin it would go
17:48
completely yeah it would be a completely
17:50
haphazard shuffle
17:52
so if you took the feathers from a
17:54
bird's right wing and put them on its
17:56
left wing and so it had two left wings
17:58
you'd be arrested
18:00
but you're right they do take them from
18:02
a live animal because animals will
18:03
regrow them so i don't know if they keep
18:06
harvesting the same bird to get more
18:07
shuttle [ __ ] out of it but it does
18:09
apparently cause the burden could the
18:10
goose incredible pain when they're taken
18:12
out but they do then regrow you know
18:14
when someone does i don't know your
18:16
eyebrows yeah that in itself is a bit
18:18
like oh that's quite painful imagine
18:20
like at the bottom of feathers it's
18:21
almost sticks well i think it's more
18:23
akin to pulling out toenails rather
18:26
than i read this incredible fact which
18:29
is if a bold eagle loses a feather on
18:32
one of its wings it will shed the
18:33
corresponding feather on the opposite
18:36
wing to maintain balance now that wow
18:39
isn't that amazing that's the sort of
18:40
thing that fundamentalist christians
18:41
will pick up on to show that there is a
18:43
god that's just astonishing wow how
18:45
quickly would it do it i reckon just
18:47
straight away so if you were if you
18:49
happen to be plucking a bald eagle and
18:50
you took one out you'd just see another
18:52
one go on the other side
18:54
that would be useful if you're like a
18:55
turkey plucker or something yeah and
18:57
you'd only have to do half the turkey
18:59
do they pluck it out their own feather
19:01
or do they can they selectively shed a
19:03
single feather i believe that's what i
19:05
read now i i actually don't believe it
19:07
myself but that's what i read in a
19:08
reputable source heat magazine
19:13
pluckers monthly
19:14
that was a very big mistake at the news
19:16
agents that i ended up with
19:18
i wonder how many feathers a goose can
19:20
give because the professional
19:22
shuttlecocks always use 16 feathers i
19:24
read that they only use four feathers
19:26
per goose per shuttlecock
19:28
really i think that i think that's what
19:30
i wrote this is where dan's cheekily
19:32
boyish grim is causing easy winding us
19:34
up here no that's what i read it's um no
19:36
more than four feathers from the same
19:38
goose for the same shuttle i've heard
19:40
that once the shuttle [ __ ] is made if
19:41
you want to
19:43
alter the spin that it's giving you if
19:44
it's spinning too much you can either
19:46
take the feathers out or bend them over
19:49
or snip the end off is that a way to
19:51
cheat in badminton if you kind of snip
19:53
the feathers a bit it'll make it spin
19:55
more or less like the flake it is i
19:57
watched a video online where a scientist
19:59
was talking about how you can cheat in
20:00
badminton and that's one of the things
20:01
that you're not allowed to do if you
20:02
bend the feathers in you get way more
20:04
speed something to do with wind
20:06
resistance just yeah the speed because
20:08
the speed is the other incredible thing
20:10
about a professional shuttle [ __ ] you
20:11
know you think fast bouldering cricket
20:13
two or three of them have reached a
20:14
hundred miles an hour with accreditation
20:16
yeah and brett lee's done it and darren
20:18
gough brilliantly when they first
20:20
started using speed guns came into the
20:22
dressing room he said i just pulled 150
20:24
miles an hour and they said you know
20:25
it's kilometers an hour and you've got
20:27
it right
20:28
um but so that's that then the tennis
20:29
players i think are up to about 150
20:31
aren't they a really heavy server in
20:33
male tennis we'll do 150. shuttlecock's
20:36
200 miles an hour wow when it comes off
20:38
the racket 200 how can you how can a
20:40
human possibly do that to us yeah it's
20:42
unbelievable slows down pretty quickly
20:44
though it does but yeah that's almost
20:45
literally what it's designed to do like
20:47
most other sports will design something
20:49
to go faster this is designed to slow
20:51
down yeah so i don't know if americans
20:53
use the word shuttlecock that much maybe
20:55
they do because i'm not american but um
20:57
i've read that they call them birds
20:58
instead and the reason they did that is
21:00
because they didn't want to say the word
21:01
[ __ ]
21:02
that wasn't that was the thing that um
21:04
the birds [ __ ] were were called what
21:06
are they called now roosters roosters
21:08
the supposed etymology is from shyness
21:11
basically oh that's lovely yeah it's a
21:12
bit like um and it's very appropriate
21:14
that we're sitting here in the postcode
21:16
wc i know this because the new books
21:18
themed around postcodes evenly more used
21:19
to have a friend who refused to call the
21:21
wc postcode in london wc she always used
21:24
to insist on saying west central because
21:26
she said wc had indelicate association
21:32
um do you guys know about the miller
21:33
place panthers high school badminton
21:35
team these guys have got the longest
21:37
winning streak in team sport history
21:40
and from the spring of 1973 until april
21:43
the 12th 2005 they won every single game
21:47
a winning streak of 504 consecutive
21:49
victories wow yeah
21:52
the obvious question is who beat them it
21:53
was another team nearby i haven't
21:55
written down who it was but it was
21:56
another team nearby they beat them 10-5
21:58
i remember wow uh and that was the end
22:00
of their streak but they've done quite
22:02
well since then they've gone back to
22:03
winning ways i understand unfortunately
22:05
we've heard of neither of them
22:07
which means the fame level crossover
22:09
hasn't yet
22:11
worked out for either of them if you go
22:12
into the wikipedia page for miller place
22:15
which is a connotation in america
22:17
somewhere and they are on that page so i
22:19
think they're locally quite fast
22:21
yeah so but this also means that it's a
22:22
badminton team therefore they would have
22:25
a new player a place because that's even
22:27
more impressive that it's not one
22:28
singular person or two people it's
22:30
their school team yes if it was if it
22:32
was one person who'd been winning for 32
22:34
years
22:35
i think the school administration should
22:36
get involved
22:37
that student is being failed by the
22:39
education system
22:40
these 10 year olds are useless
22:45
that's why he kept winning
22:50
[Applause]
22:51
[Music]
22:52
okay time for our final fact of the show
22:55
and that is my fact and my fact this
22:58
week is that the ancient egyptians had a
23:00
porn papyrus
23:03
uh yeah so this this is a bit of a
23:05
mystery that's papyrus it was found in a
23:08
cave um it definitely has scenes of
23:12
sexual nature and no one is quite sure
23:15
whether or not it was used as actual
23:18
youth stimulation or whether or not it
23:19
was a joke and it was poking fun of the
23:22
of the rich and and the powerful at the
23:24
time they're not quite like the sex
23:25
manual like um the karma suits the karma
23:28
yeah exactly so it's called the turin
23:30
erotic papyrus and they have no idea
23:33
what it's for but they're still trying
23:34
to find out i want more details on
23:35
what's in it what's depicted oh so it's
23:38
a lot of just sexual scenes there's a
23:39
lot of men and women uh doing stuff the
23:42
first third of it is not sexual at all
23:44
it's just animals and birds doing
23:46
various things like all porn there's
23:48
always you know that's the equivalent of
23:50
the washing machine
23:52
yes yeah you need them to you need to
23:54
establish the scene
23:56
looks like that chariot's broken
24:00
okay so papyrus is a plant
24:03
that they made early paper out of and
24:05
that's why we get the word paper um they
24:07
used papyrus for other things as well
24:09
they used it for mattresses they used it
24:11
for chairs tables baskets sandals ropes
24:14
boats
24:15
apparently they used it for tampons
24:17
wouldn't be particularly
24:19
you know it's very rough so it won't be
24:21
particularly nice but they softened it
24:22
by soaking it in the nile first
24:24
wow but it was like this kind of
24:26
material that they used sort of a wonder
24:28
material like the plastic of the day
24:30
exactly like that yeah dead sea scrolls
24:32
are written on papyrus
24:34
uh one fragment of the dead sea scrolls
24:36
is called 7q5 and some people think it's
24:39
an early part of the new testament um
24:42
but they've managed to work this out
24:43
despite the fact that only one word is
24:46
fully legible
24:47
on this fragment and that word is and
24:52
well that just clinches
24:54
it's and with a capital a and apparently
24:57
the gospel of mark quite often starts
24:59
sentences with and god that's good um
25:02
sleuthing though yeah or made up stuff
25:06
um
25:07
ancient egypt uh they actually prepared
25:09
for sex in the afterlife did they yeah i
25:11
didn't know this they they actually
25:13
properly it was like a thing that they
25:15
had to consider and so um
25:17
men had false penises attached to their
25:19
mummies and women had artificial nerves
25:23
can we just say what the mummy is in
25:24
this game sorry yes to themselves
25:29
and women had artificial nipples did
25:31
they yeah
25:32
like ghost nipples yeah and they would
25:34
become fully functional in the afterlife
25:36
that was the idea that they would sort
25:37
of be it's optimistic isn't it
25:40
thinking that an artificial penis will
25:42
be useful once you're dead yeah because
25:45
i mean it's not useful at that time it's
25:46
just kind of going off trust a little
25:48
bit
25:50
if these days if you ask for an
25:52
artificial penis to be put in the coffin
25:53
with you
25:54
if it was an open casket
25:58
i'm starting to feel very sheltered now
26:00
in my knowledge of engineering because i
26:01
went there earlier i was pleased to went
26:03
down to um
26:04
tooting carmen's tune was they
26:06
discovered honey down there when they
26:08
honey is the one food that never goes
26:10
off and they discovered some honey that
26:11
had been buried with tooth and car moon
26:12
however many thousands of years ago
26:15
that's what my guide couldn't confirm
26:17
they that some of it was kept for the
26:18
the rulers of egypt at the time you know
26:20
whoever was in charge earlier this
26:21
century uh sorry early 20th century and
26:24
yeah they did take some and i think they
26:26
must have sampled it to check that it
26:27
was okay i bet it was disgusting it must
26:29
have been right yeah well let's say
26:31
you've got a drummer of honey yeah yeah
26:32
and you left it in a sealed dry room for
26:35
2000 years what's going to happen to it
26:37
nothing
26:39
it'll just be honey wouldn't it i'm also
26:41
now so your minds are so dirty they've
26:43
started to corrupt me i'm wondering
26:44
whether the honey was part of a
26:45
preparation for sex in the afterlife
26:49
um i think honey would last do you yeah
26:51
okay if we have a 2000 year old jar of
26:54
honey and a modern day jar of honey you
26:57
can have the 2 000 year old one
27:00
i'll sell it for more modern honey
27:04
are we allowed to go back to porn or not
27:05
or do you yeah yeah
27:06
yeah it's such a ridiculous thing and
27:08
porn is the anyone involved in making it
27:10
knows it's the most unerotic thing that
27:12
you're doing with the film and famously
27:13
and don't look now when uh donald
27:15
sutherland and julie christie were
27:16
supposed to have done it for real while
27:18
they were filming the love scene donald
27:19
sutherland says if you've had a film
27:21
crew around you you'll know how
27:23
on erotic it is and how difficult it
27:25
would be to do it but the notion of the
27:27
fluffer i found out recently apparently
27:29
it's a myth that the fluffer exists at
27:31
all the fluff for those who don't know
27:32
the fluffer is and i guess it's normally
27:34
a woman who's paid to ready the man for
27:37
his performance to get him into a
27:39
physical state where he is ready to
27:41
perform
27:42
and that's just a complete myth if
27:44
you're a male porn performer you're
27:45
expected to be ready and if you're not
27:46
ready then you won't get the job and
27:48
also i love the fact that the people who
27:49
clean the london underground lines
27:51
overnight when the tubes shut overnight
27:52
they're called fluffers as well
27:54
so i think there is only one true job
27:56
called the fluffer and it's the one that
27:57
cleaned the tube imagine your
27:59
disappointment when you find out when
28:00
you applied for fluffer
28:02
you're down in the london underground
28:06
i i was i found another egyptian uh book
28:09
that uh has been sort of a mysterious
28:12
book that we haven't quite cracked and
28:14
decoded
28:15
and they've recently they think they've
28:16
managed to decode it properly and this
28:19
is macquarie university in australia
28:21
think they've managed to do it and it's
28:22
1 300 years old this text
28:25
and they think what it turns out to be
28:26
is that it's a book of spells
28:28
some of the spells that they've
28:30
translated uh include a spell for
28:33
someone who is possessed
28:34
someone who is annoyed at you there's a
28:37
spell for that
28:38
uh that a woman might conceive
28:40
and when someone has a magic on them
28:45
you've got a magic on you
28:47
that's i like that this is someone who
28:49
is annoyed at you yeah i think that's a
28:51
fantastic spell and you can just do a
28:53
magic on them and they'll not be annoyed
28:55
with you yeah exactly that's great
28:57
there's another one called the greek
28:59
magical papyrus
29:00
and that gives you uh it gives you
29:03
explanations for ingredients in um other
29:06
magics as you might call them so if a
29:08
magic spell astra head of a snake it's
29:11
actually a leech and if it asks for
29:13
crocodile dung it's egyptian earth and
29:16
if it asks for lion semen you should use
29:18
human semen
29:20
um but for the magical spells um so
29:22
people often thought that these magic
29:24
spells that they were doing had like the
29:26
head of a snake in or lying semen in but
29:28
actually they were much more normal um
29:30
objects thinking back in those days who
29:32
would want the job of collecting the
29:33
lion semen yeah i mean now they do it
29:35
straight from the testicle i think they
29:37
know they knock it out and kill it no i
29:38
think the lions have a fluffer don't
29:40
they
29:42
isn't there a thought that the idea of
29:44
them changing the words or changing the
29:46
terms is almost the copyright of its day
29:49
it was to
29:50
it was the um the secret ingredient to
29:53
coca-cola type thing is it yeah that's
29:55
what i read with babylonian semen it's
29:57
the secret ingredient of coca-cola
30:00
for legal reasons i think we have to say
30:03
that
30:05
i think they found that from babylonian
30:08
cuneiform that they thought that they
30:09
were like look at all these odd
30:10
ingredients and they realized that they
30:12
were coded words kind of like the the
30:13
jan morris code from everest to so that
30:16
no one could steal the proper
30:18
incantation and the ingredients for it
30:20
that's great this is just quite
30:21
interesting next year playboy um no more
30:24
nude women in playboy they're getting
30:25
rid of
30:26
so it's all going to be sort of tasteful
30:29
tasteful in quotation marks what they
30:30
think is tasteful but you always say
30:32
that you read that for the articles then
30:33
don't you no i collect old ones because
30:35
yeah hunter s thompson used to write for
30:37
them and woody allen and gretchen marks
30:39
and yeah extraordinary comic uh articles
30:42
in there and uh and now i can read it
30:44

00:43
and once again we have gathered around
00:44
the microphones with our four favorite
00:46
facts from the last seven days and in no
00:48
particular order here we go starting
00:50
with you jacinsky yep my fact this week
00:53
is that the world's only cornish pasty
00:55
museum is in mexico
00:58
[Laughter]
01:00
these planning permission things
01:01
[Music]
01:03
so
01:04
why and when did it go up uh well so
01:06
this is because there's actually a
01:08
significant like cornish diaspora in
01:10
mexico because mexico needed minors in
01:13
the early 19th century a bunch of
01:14
cornish men emigrated out there and um
01:17
they brought their pasties with them and
01:19
passes have been a delicacy in mexico
01:20
and it's particularly in
01:22
in these two areas uh it's in the
01:24
municipality of real del monte
01:26
um and yeah and a place called pachuca
01:29
pachusa i don't know is there any
01:30
mexicans in here who are going to
01:31
correct me on that no cool
01:33
[Music]
01:35
but yeah it's 4 500 miles away from
01:37
cornwall and it is a cornish pasty
01:38
museum it was set up about five years
01:40
ago what's in the cornish pasty museum
01:43
i feel like the clues and the titles
01:46
some medieval helmets and a viking ship
01:50
it's actually misnamed i mean once
01:51
you've seen the cornish pasty andy you
01:53
have not seen a cult
01:56
yeah it seems like it's partly a
01:57
culinary school disguised as a museum
01:59
there's uh pasty making um lessons and
02:02
in fact so recently i think in 2014 a
02:04
team of mexican bakers took a trip to
02:06
cornwall so they could pick up some new
02:08
tips about how to make pasties
02:10
specifically the art of crimping which
02:12
is uh you know getting that little
02:13
little handhold bit on the side right uh
02:16
there is actually going to be a cornish
02:17
pasty museum in the uk soon
02:20
where will it be orkney
02:23
no this is a guy called malcolm ball
02:25
he's hoping to open um what he's calling
02:28
a planet hollywood with a cornish pasty
02:30
twist
02:32
um and he said he started to research
02:34
whether there's any visitor attractions
02:36
in the uk focusing on the cornish pasty
02:39
and was absolutely staggered to find out
02:43
that there wasn't a single one
02:48
is the twist on the planet hollywood
02:50
thing that it's got no celebrities no
02:52
memorabilia and it's just cornish past
02:54
there's gonna be memorabilia but it'll
02:55
be pasty memorabilia
02:58
pasties yeah
03:00
um yeah so if anyone listens to this in
03:01
a year i wanted to say please don't
03:03
write in and say my fact was wrong it
03:04
just will be wrong in about six months
03:06
time because there is going to be a
03:07
second passing museum
03:09
but yeah the cornish had a really big
03:10
influence in mexico so they also
03:13
imported football in the 1890s i think
03:15
it was about set up the first football
03:17
team in mexico and in fact fifa's only
03:21
football hall of fame is now in
03:23
patchousa that little town in mexico oh
03:26
really wow yeah i was looking into the
03:28
history of cornish pasties and in the
03:31
early days um both husband and wife
03:33
would initial the husband's name onto
03:35
the end of the cornish pasty so that
03:37
they knew it was their lunchbox
03:38
effectively so you could you could go
03:40
that's my cornish pasty look my darren
03:42
is written on it
03:45
and then also to test whether a good
03:47
cornish pasty is good as it can be is
03:50
that they would drop it down a mine and
03:52
if it survived
03:53
then they're like that's a damn good
03:55
cornish pasty they've dropped it down a
03:57
mine
03:58
they didn't drop it down and buy it
03:59
that's what the people do say that that
04:01
also implies that a good way to test for
04:02
a good cornish pasty is try and bite
04:04
into it and if you can't then it
04:06
probably is good the effect of dropping
04:08
a cornish pasty down a mine is much
04:10
greater than biting it so if it doesn't
04:12
survive then it's inedible yeah i read
04:14
the other day that it's impossible to
04:15
tell if an apple is ripe
04:17
without biting into it but i'm not sure
04:19
anyone's ever thought of putting it down
04:21
a mine
04:22
just drop it down to mine yeah the thing
04:24
with the um with the initials on the
04:26
opacity what they used to do is they
04:28
used to hold it kind of
04:29
kind of upright and they would keep the
04:31
initial at the bottom and then it would
04:33
eat it from the top and so you would
04:35
always kind of have the initial at the
04:36
bottom
04:37
for the whole thing and then once you
04:39
got down to the bottom with the initial
04:40
you would throw it away and you'd throw
04:42
it for what they called the mining
04:44
gremlins oh they called them knockers
04:46
did they yes
04:48
they were the sort of little people in
04:49
the mines who if they you gave them a
04:52
bit of food they wouldn't give you bad
04:53
luck
04:54
you also some people say that they
04:56
didn't eat the the reason they have that
04:58
handle bit the crimped handle bit was uh
04:59
to hold on to and that was discarded at
05:01
the end because uh so corn was the the
05:04
it had the largest tin mining um but it
05:06
also had the largest arsenic mining
05:07
there's a lot of arsenic down there and
05:09
so these miners hands were covered in
05:11
arsenic which they didn't want to eat so
05:14
i think they chucked away the bit they
05:15
held onto mine for arsenic yeah
05:17
apparently uh corn was one of the
05:19
country's biggest providers of arsenal
05:20
did you not get your arsenic supplies
05:21
from cornwall
05:23
i do obviously i do but yeah
05:25
and also they're throwing the food down
05:26
into the arsenic mines before they eat
05:28
it
05:30
yeah just pick it up three second rule
05:32
brush off the arsenal
05:35
they'd have a different second rule it
05:37
takes a long time to get there
05:40
um you know the chant that goes uh augie
05:43
augie
05:45
yeah there you go but not in that tone
05:47
of voice and like a different tone of
05:49
voice
05:50
so that john is thought to come from the
05:52
cornish word for pasty which is hogan or
05:55
hogan and it's thought and this again is
05:57
probably just myth that's been passed
05:58
down the generations but at lunchtime
06:00
the wives would come to the top of the
06:02
mines and they'd shout out augie ogie
06:05
and the miners downstairs would go oi
06:08
and they'd be like all right he wants it
06:11
and then you do the drop test and then
06:12
you drop them and countless miners were
06:14
killed by their
06:15
their rock-hard pasties
06:19
cause of death lunge lunge lunge
06:23
um i read um a dictionary of slang from
06:25
1811 uh the gross dictionary of slang
06:28
and um the only thing for pasties that i
06:30
could find is that to deliver a flying
06:33
pasty meant to take a poo
06:35
wrap it in paper and throw it over a
06:38
neighbor's wall
06:39
[Laughter]
06:43
you didn't get that from a dictionary
06:48
i was gonna mention i thought it would
06:49
be a bit too like just juvenile to do
06:52
but since you bring it up um i i've read
06:54
a story about uh it was about someone's
06:56
housemate who got evicted from the house
06:57
because they found them eating a pasty
06:59
full of poo
07:00
and
07:01
and they said yeah so here's the thing
07:03
he wasn't feeding it to anyone else he
07:04
was just minding his own business having
07:06
a pasty on his own in the kitchen and
07:08
then they said we don't want someone
07:09
eating poop you say he wasn't feeding it
07:11
to anyone but she didn't make the good
07:12
point that she didn't want to use the
07:13
oven afterwards which i think is totally
07:14
fair something else that's disgusting
07:17
that goes into um cornish pasties they
07:19
used to put jam at the bottom and meet
07:21
at the top didn't they and so that was
07:23
so that you could have a full meal you
07:25
would have your first course there and
07:26
you're putting at the end but there must
07:28
have been a bit in between that was kind
07:29
of jammy meat that was sorbet yeah
07:33
it's a nice palate cleanser
07:35
for the gourmet miner
07:36
[Laughter]
07:38
um we're gonna have to move on to the
07:40
next fact soonish uh if you guys have
07:42
anything else okay can i just say a
07:44
thing about museums yeah i found this
07:45
thing the other day um apparently in
07:48
1846 a snail arrived at the british
07:50
museum
07:53
as i read that and they said you're late
07:56
where have you been yeah someone sent a
07:59
snail into the british museum and it was
08:02
stuck onto a piece of cardboard
08:04
and then they noticed four years later
08:06
that the card was slightly discolored
08:09
they put it all into some warm water and
08:11
it turned out that the snail wasn't dead
08:13
and it woke up and it became really
08:15
famous and it was like the most famous
08:17
snail in britain in 18. a tough
08:19
competition in that year actually
08:22
what yeah 1850 1850 that was it was so
08:24
famous it was painted by john william
08:27
waterhouse oh what color
08:32
looking good it's just i just like that
08:34
that there was a most famous snail in
08:35
britain and waterhouse i like as well
08:37
because he painted um pre-raphaelite
08:40
style but like decades after everyone's
08:42
like didn't really want to do it anymore
08:44
so he was like a post pre-raphaelite i
08:46
think they just call them raphaelites
08:50
uh have we got have we got any more on
08:51
this should we just i think a good thing
08:52
to look into if you if you fancy
08:54
researching more about cornish pasties
08:56
is the british newspaper archive where i
08:58
was reading up on other 19th century
08:59
pasty stories and there were a couple of
09:01
good ones so uh one of them was a travel
09:04
writer in the leeds times in 1861 uh
09:06
visited cornwall
09:08
and said of the passing the name is
09:09
generally applicable to anything that by
09:11
any stretch of the culinary imagination
09:13
could be conceived as existing under a
09:14
crust
09:17
so he wasn't a fan and in 1889 two
09:19
cornish miners got trapped in a mine so
09:22
they were stuck underground and all they
09:23
had to eat was uh full pasties that
09:26
their wives had given them before they
09:27
they got trapped underground they were
09:28
trapped on the ground for four and a
09:29
half days um and they didn't even finish
09:32
the pasties because
09:35
they were they were unfit to eat
09:37
apparently so
09:39
yeah this one's been on the ground for
09:40
four seconds possibly
09:44
okay i'm gonna move us on to our next
09:45
fact and that is james harkin okay my
09:48
fact this week is that 20 of people wake
09:51
up wearing fewer clothes than they went
09:54
to bed with do we know who's removing
09:56
them
09:57
do we know who's taking them off no we
09:58
don't know well we think probably them
10:00
okay or the clothes fairy oh yeah well
10:03
there is one theory that if you wake if
10:05
you go to bed wearing pajamas and you
10:07
wake up not wearing them you've been
10:08
abducted by aliens there's a website
10:10
called abduct anon and it says how to
10:12
tell if you've been abducted by aliens
10:15
and that's one of them if you went to
10:16
the bed wearing pajamas and you woke up
10:18
nude that's one of them the other one is
10:20
electronic appliances behave strangely
10:23
when you pass by another one is you have
10:25
an uncontrollable urge to take vitamins
10:29
don't really understand that one three
10:30
out of three so far
10:32
and the other one i really like this the
10:34
scene of your abduction has been staged
10:36
to look as if nothing happened
10:40
so if you ever wake up in the morning
10:42
and everything looks exactly the same
10:44
it's aliens i'm afraid
10:47
i was reading that when aliens do abduct
10:49
humans uh i don't believe it by the way
10:51
but when they when they say they adopt
10:53
them the abductees say that when they
10:55
get up there the aliens do some probes
10:58
and they often have to do it in a sort
11:00
of slightly inappropriate kind of sexual
11:02
manner they try and transform their
11:05
bodies so that they look as if they're
11:07
comfortable sights to you so it just
11:09
feels like oh this is this is quite a
11:10
nice thing and the list of things that
11:12
they dress up as body-wise is the pope
11:17
that's the thing that's most likely to
11:19
put something up your ass
11:22
the other is a deceased relative and
11:24
that's what they say will make you feel
11:26
like well this is a pleasant experience
11:29
um i do i do this do you want to say
11:33
this
11:37
to bring it back to the conversation
11:39
before
11:40
um i i wake up sometimes not wearing uh
11:43
if i ever
11:44
uh have socks on when i go when i go to
11:46
sleep i'll wake up not wearing the socks
11:47
yeah um
11:49
i'm so uncomfortable telling you that as
11:51
well i feel like you've all been left in
11:53
now you are wearing the sock on your
11:54
penis though
12:00
look my room is drafty and cold
12:05
and i'm a real man i don't wear pyjamas
12:08
oh god do you actually wake up with no
12:11
socks
12:12
yeah
12:13
thank you
12:14
and i've got i've got a friend and
12:15
supporter in tonight
12:18
so anyway so this was a it was a survey
12:21
by a
12:22
memory foam mattress company called ergo
12:24
flex and they said that socks are the
12:27
most commonly removed item with 31
12:29
percent of people who remove things
12:30
saying that they don't keep them on at
12:32
night
12:33
so you're you're in you know a good
12:35
company
12:36
one of the other things i found is that
12:37
the average length of time men wear
12:39
pajamas before washing them is 13 nights
12:43
and women it's 17 nights
12:45
[Laughter]
12:48
whereas we all know the correct answer
12:50
is your own for one night and then you
12:51
incinerate them
12:53
and you buy a new pen
12:56
so when you say you're a real man you
12:57
don't wear pajamas is that
12:59
oh we so glossed over that and uh
13:03
no i'm just gonna say whether that's a
13:04
thing because there was a survey done
13:06
into who wears pajamas and who doesn't
13:07
and far far fewer men wear pajamas than
13:10
women um so i think it was something
13:12
like 13 percent of men wear pajamas and
13:15
about 30 of women do so is this
13:16
something in the male community that's
13:17
sort of as emasculating i think it's
13:20
thought of as being not the act of a
13:21
real man where i've got sex pairs of
13:23
silk pajamas i'm fine but um and one
13:25
sock
13:29
in the survey they did people were asked
13:31
what they wore in bed and one percent of
13:33
people said they had no opinion
13:35
[Laughter]
13:39
the aliens look after that stuff to be
13:41
honest with you
13:43
the idea of uh doing things while you're
13:46
asleep is called parasomnia
13:48
and there have been examples of people
13:50
doing various things texting while
13:51
asleep
13:52
eating while asleep is a bad one because
13:54
you can put on a lot of weight
13:56
driving cars while asleep there's one or
13:58
two people have done that
13:59
and there was one sleep doctor who
14:01
described how he treated someone who
14:03
dismantled grandfather clocks while
14:05
asleep
14:08
there's you know you said people text in
14:10
their sleep yeah
14:11
there was a the first example of um
14:15
someone using the internet while asleep
14:16
was in 2008 and this was a 44 year old
14:20
woman who in her in her sleep she got
14:22
out of bed she went over to her computer
14:24
she logs in and she fired off three
14:26
emails uh one of which read
14:28
come tomorrow and sort this hell hole
14:30
out dinner and drinks 4 p.m bring wine
14:32
and caviar only
14:35
what an awesome dream was
14:37
[Laughter]
14:39
there's a really cool thing as well that
14:41
they've noticed in recent times when
14:43
they've been doing studies that anyone
14:44
playing video games and so younger
14:46
children and really cool awesome adults
14:50
they have ability they say in their
14:53
dream to suddenly take charge and
14:56
control the dream as if they were
14:57
playing call of duty or something like
14:59
that so they don't have nightmares
15:01
because nightmares for them are a
15:02
challenge where they can then slaughter
15:04
dragons and and sort out yeah it's
15:07
called lucid dreaming right yeah the
15:09
idea is that you keep looking at your
15:10
watch during the day and then you start
15:12
dreaming that you're looking at your
15:14
watch and you realize that it's not
15:15
moving and then you can realize you're
15:16
in a dream and as soon as you realize
15:17
you're in a dream then you can start
15:19
doing things in there and there are
15:20
quite a few people who can do it i've
15:21
done it a couple of times but only a
15:23
couple times my whole life i can
15:24
remember having a lucid dream wow really
15:26
cool yeah i bet i just fly
15:30
just a quick thing on pajamas
15:33
i was looking for information on
15:35
astronaut pyjamas what they were in
15:37
space whether they were pajamas where
15:39
they take them and so i googled um do
15:42
astronauts me to type in wear pajamas
15:44
and the first thing that came up is do
15:45
astronauts masturbate in space
15:48
so i clicked on that instead
15:51
i found an article um there's a website
15:53
called quora where people write their
15:55
own answers to questions people post up
15:57
and there was an article on quora which
15:58
gave an answer and i just wanted to read
16:00
it out this is the answer on quora this
16:02
is at least the tenth time i've answered
16:04
a question about sex masturbation or
16:05
romance in space please search before
16:08
posting
16:10
and he goes on he gives the answer he
16:11
says yes each astronaut has a private
16:13
sleeping area no there isn't a space
16:16
just for masturbation
16:21
just though the guys at nasa would have
16:22
built that into a spaceship
16:26
well we've got the sleeping quarters the
16:28
mess the masturbatorium
16:29
[Laughter]
16:36
there was an article in the daily mail
16:37
which said um
16:39
and i should have really looked into
16:40
whether this could possibly be right but
16:42
said it had interviewed an independent
16:44
sleep expert who said that resist the
16:46
temptation to strip off at night when
16:48
you're hot and muggy it's actually
16:50
cooler if you wear pajamas because the
16:52
pajama fabric draws sweat away from your
16:55
body and will make you feel a lot cooler
16:56
and more comfortable so doesn't that
16:58
imply that whenever you're too hot you
17:00
should put more clothes on
17:02
can that be true um i don't know it
17:05
doesn't sound very true does it it
17:06
really does
17:07
um speaking of things that happen while
17:09
you're asleep um a 64 year old man has
17:13
told how he passed out after a heavy
17:15
night's drinking and woke up to find
17:17
that his penis was missing
17:20
neighbors of geraldo ramos claim that he
17:22
was attacked by a dog as he stumbled
17:24
around the dominican republic naked
17:27
while drunk
17:28
he has decided to stop drinking
17:33
sounds like a good decision
17:35
it sounds like a bit of a stable door
17:36
and horse bolted decision to be honest
17:41
no we're gonna have to move on very soon
17:43
okay
17:45
in china people wear pajamas quite a lot
17:48
in um in the evenings people will just
17:50
go out wearing pajamas and in 2010 they
17:53
had pajama police in shanghai to stop
17:56
people from wearing pajamas
17:58
because there was an expo in town and
18:00
they didn't want people to think that
18:01
they were slovenly or whatever so they
18:03
tried to stop anyone from wearing
18:04
pajamas and they even had celebrities on
18:07
tv um saying that the idea of going out
18:09
in pajamas was backward and uncivilized
18:12
but what's the definition of pajamas i'm
18:16
very i just think that's really hard to
18:17
police but i think they do like in japan
18:19
so in the survey that was done asking if
18:20
people wear pyjamas or wear something
18:22
else in bed or sleep naked the brits
18:24
love to sleep naked actually we're up
18:25
there in the top naked sleeping
18:27
countries uh 30 of us only 12 in the us
18:30
in japan uh in the survey it wasn't even
18:32
a zero percent it was just not
18:34
applicable i think
18:36
the japanese were just like i'm not
18:38
going to answer that question that is
18:40
disgusting so yeah they're not up for it
18:43
amazing okay should we move on to our
18:44
next fans let's move on okay it is time
18:47
for fact number three and that is andrew
18:49
hunter murray um my fact this week is
18:51
that there are people who mine for jeans
18:54
they literally go into mines looking for
18:57
jeans yeah this is really amazing so
18:59
it's uh it's basically back in the day
19:02
when uh people were doing mining they
19:04
would bring their their genes down
19:05
levi's were made kind of specifically
19:08
for mining and then for some reason this
19:10
is the bit i haven't worked out in the
19:11
story they would come up without their
19:13
jeans
19:15
and so you know it's it's it's warm
19:17
isn't it you've got to um yeah but there
19:19
are there are lots of things left down
19:21
there sort of there are loads of silver
19:22
mines in the american west which are
19:24
just completely abandoned and so there
19:26
is a thriving trade already in people
19:27
who bring up old whiskey bottles
19:30
because they they were left down there
19:31
when they've been finished and
19:32
collectors will pay good money for them
19:33
so you can go down looking for them and
19:36
then there is a guy um there are several
19:38
of these guys one of them is called
19:39
michael allen harris
19:41
and um he found some old scraps of denim
19:43
and he realized that a collector of
19:45
antique denim might pay good money for
19:47
that too
19:48
and um
19:49
he has had an amazing run of going down
19:51
with his father-in-law into these
19:53
abandoned mines um he's sold one pair of
19:56
jeans he found for thirty thousand
19:57
dollars
19:58
to a collector um and his father-in-law
20:01
is really really cool he found the
20:02
oldest ever pair of levi's they're from
20:04
1873 which is the first year of
20:07
production yeah um
20:09
i don't think they've sold them yet but
20:10
those can sell for over a hundred
20:12
thousand dollars an intact pair of
20:15
original uh they were called waste
20:16
overalls back then yeah yeah i think he
20:18
had an offer didn't he and he said he
20:19
doesn't want to sell them yeah he
20:21
doesn't yeah yeah he he said i do have
20:23
two daughters to put through college so
20:25
i might reconsider but for now i'd
20:26
rather own a really old pair of jeans
20:29
than have a hundred thousand dollars
20:31
but this still doesn't answer my
20:33
question why were they going down to the
20:34
mines and coming back up without their
20:35
trousers on well i think the heat is one
20:37
reason actually but i think another
20:39
reason is if there was like a pipe which
20:42
had kind of leaked or something they
20:43
would take them off and tie them around
20:45
pipes and stuff like that because they
20:46
were such a durable material they were
20:49
kind of useful for anything really right
20:51
maybe bring down an extra pair of jeans
20:53
that kind of stuff maybe that's what
20:55
they did yeah okay yeah i haven't
20:56
thought it through
20:58
yeah we don't have photographs of miners
21:00
emerging and just like naked from the
21:02
waist down
21:03
i do but we'll talk about that later
21:06
there are people trying to mine uh
21:08
asteroids at the moment that's a big
21:10
thing isn't it there's a load of metals
21:12
in asteroids and they think if they
21:14
could somehow capture one and get up
21:15
there and get all the metal out of there
21:17
then they'll be able to make a load of
21:18
money yeah three three quite big ifs
21:22
well they reckon a single asteroid will
21:24
be worth 60 trillion dollars
21:26
if they could mine it yeah it's a
21:28
company called planetary resources which
21:30
is backed by james cameron the film uh
21:32
director and they're gonna try and do
21:34
this and i worked out that if they
21:36
managed to get this asteroid then he
21:38
could remake avatar every day for the
21:40
next
21:42
years everyone yeah
21:43
so 1000
21:46
a famous movie made in one day
21:48
[Laughter]
21:51
so another thing about mines and miners
21:54
this is very cool um
21:56
there are some miners who are called
21:59
ghost miners in south africa and the
22:01
mines there um they live underground and
22:04
they're not official mine employees but
22:06
they sneak into the mines when security
22:08
is distracted
22:10
and then they then live underground and
22:12
they just look for ghosts
22:14
[Laughter]
22:16
i've missed explained very poorly here
22:19
so yeah they live underground and their
22:20
skin goes gray because they don't ever
22:22
see the sun again and um there's this
22:24
whole economy because they combine sort
22:26
of extra dangerous bits which have been
22:28
abandoned by the main body of the miners
22:29
and uh so where a loaf of bread might
22:32
cost one dollar above ground to smuggle
22:34
it into a mine uh you'll pay 12
22:36
underground for it so there's this whole
22:38
um secret economy going on under the
22:40
ground in these mines yeah yeah
22:43
that's not well i mean just in terms of
22:45
underground economy we we talked about
22:47
this i think on a podcast uh ages ago
22:49
the um the large hadron collider is
22:51
actually used for smuggling fruit
22:54
across from one country to another
22:56
because apparently it's cheaper to buy
22:57
fruit in whatever they fire it through
22:59
the largest
23:01
never makes it through
23:03
these are made just two bananas smashing
23:05
into each other it's amazing they're so
23:07
cheap really isn't it
23:10
how expensive is fruit in france
23:13
how many higgs boson false positives did
23:15
they get
23:17
which turned out to just be a pair do we
23:19
know
23:20
can i do something on jeans very quickly
23:22
yeah of course okay um a hipster's
23:24
skinny jeans have filed a group of
23:26
would-be thieves because they were
23:28
unable to remove his belongings from his
23:30
exceptionally tight pockets
23:36
sense 27 told the new york post they
23:39
couldn't even get a finger in
23:40
[Laughter]
23:44
even though they appeared to him in the
23:45
guys of the pope
23:48
and they the squabbling thieves gave up
23:51
after two minutes
23:52
so there were two minutes trying to get
23:54
in there wow well the hips are just
23:56
standing there going yeah take your time
23:57
i know i'm safe yeah there was a thing
24:00
like that in uh cuba in
24:01
post-revolutionary cuba there was a
24:03
thing called the lemon test where you
24:05
would be stopped on the street by gangs
24:07
of revolutionaries and um they would to
24:09
make sure your trousers weren't too
24:10
tight and cool and american looking they
24:12
would try and get a lemon through your
24:14
waistband and down through your trousers
24:16
to the to the uh the hem of your
24:18
trousers and if a lemon would pass
24:20
through then you were okay and if a
24:22
lemon wouldn't pass through then you got
24:24
some on the spot tailoring you know the
24:26
they were very unpopular in cuba and
24:27
you're not allowed to wear jeans in
24:28
north korea at all because they're a
24:30
sign of american capitalism aren't they
24:32
um but actually that being too tight
24:34
thing defeats the original purpose of
24:36
jeans because so the word jeans is from
24:38
uh genoa where um they were first
24:42
designed and they were worn by fishermen
24:45
and they were warned specifically they
24:46
were designed to be easy to remove if a
24:48
fisherman fell overboard
24:50
so the point of jeans was meant to be
24:52
that you could whip them off in the air
24:54
in order that you didn't drown yeah
24:56
why is he trying to take his jeans off
24:59
i think they get waterlogged and weigh
25:00
you down oh okay yeah yeah you ever
25:02
tried to swim in jeans it's very
25:03
difficult
25:04
i've never tried to swim in jeans
25:06
actually i have you did that survival
25:08
test when you were at school
25:09
you took jeans
25:12
normally you have to go in pajamas but
25:14
andy was just wearing one sock
25:15
[Laughter]
25:17
i aced that test
25:21
and then i went back a second time to
25:23
get the sock
25:30
we're gonna have to move on very soon to
25:32
the final fact anything before this is
25:34
can i this is the most bizarre case the
25:36
world's most expensive pair of jeans in
25:37
a way do you guys know about these the
25:39
pearson versus chung jeans um right so
25:42
this is a lawsuit that uh was launched
25:45
in 2005 when this judge called roy
25:48
pearson who lived in the u.s took his
25:50
genes to be cleaned for ten dollars and
25:52
uh he took them to a dry clean as it was
25:54
owned by south koreans ki and jin man
25:57
chung and they lost the jeans and he
25:59
claimed that they owed him 67 million
26:02
dollars and
26:04
that was for things like the emotional
26:06
damage the mental anguish the legal fees
26:08
he had to pay to launch this courthouse
26:10
the 66 million pounds he added his
26:12
pocket
26:14
and this went on for years so it was
26:16
only settled in about 2010 i think at
26:18
one point so mr pearson because he was a
26:20
judge represented himself in court um
26:23
and at one point he broke down in tears
26:25
and had to take a break from testimony
26:27
while questioning himself because he
26:29
grew too emotional
26:33
also they said so at one point about a
26:35
week after he launched the court case
26:36
they were in court and the chung said
26:38
look we found the jeans okay they were
26:39
just in the back of the dry cleaners and
26:40
they brought the jeans into court and
26:41
they were like these are your jeans
26:42
aren't these your trousers aren't they
26:44
um and he said he insisted these are not
26:47
my pants uh i have in my adult life with
26:50
one exception never worn pants with
26:53
cuffs
26:54
but we don't know what that exception
26:55
was
26:58
all right i'm going to move us on to our
26:59
final fact time for our final fact of
27:02
the evening and that is my fact my fact
27:05
this week is that jesus had a monobrow
27:08
no way
27:09
okay yeah good point um
27:13
that's a fair point so basically there's
27:15
not many descriptions of jesus uh out
27:18
there we we don't have any first-hand
27:20
accounts we have one description which
27:23
it turns out was written by someone who
27:24
never existed and that's quite a classic
27:26
it's quite a classic description but
27:28
there's a guy called tom shivers and
27:30
he's he's on twitter um so highly
27:32
recommend checking him out because he
27:32
has an amazing blog and he writes a lot
27:34
about this stuff and he was looking
27:36
through a lot of um descriptions of
27:38
jesus in various different texts over
27:40
the years in ancient texts and he found
27:42
this constant line that came up which
27:44
was with eyebrows meeting so it happened
27:47
in at least three texts that there was
27:48
the uh the coptic acts of paul and that
27:51
uh and paul describes him as a man small
27:54
inside bald-headed with eyebrows meeting
27:56
and there's a monk who also put it um
27:59
it's just countless accounts
28:01
i say countless three accounts that he's
28:03
found
28:04
but potentially jesus had a monobrow
28:07
that's right and i think that's a cool
28:08
thing yeah yeah
28:10
we don't so the bible doesn't really
28:12
describe jesus's appearance almost at
28:13
all does it there's one account in the
28:16
book of revelations i think
28:19
where it says that his feet were like
28:21
onto burnt brass who knows what that
28:23
means his head and his hairs were white
28:25
like wool and white as snow this vision
28:28
is usually considered to refer to jesus
28:29
in heavenly form not his appearance
28:31
during his earthly life in that he had a
28:33
completely white head i guess but that's
28:34
the only description i think that comes
28:36
straight from the new testament yeah
28:38
there are a bunch of those descriptions
28:40
um where they say that his face was like
28:42
the appearance of lightning and all
28:44
these descriptions and i did think at
28:46
the time you know if you were trying to
28:48
describe what someone looked like to a
28:50
police sketch artist that's very
28:52
unhelpful you know dead hair like we'll
28:54
face like lightning
28:57
were you attacked by
28:58
such as a collage of weird random things
29:00
there was a first century historian
29:02
called josephus who wrote that jesus uh
29:05
stood uh three cubits high
29:08
and a cubit at the time on average
29:11
because it was a variable uh measurement
29:12
but it was about 18 inches and three
29:15
qubits is 56 inches which is four foot
29:17
eight
29:18
[Laughter]
29:20
so i think it might have been yoda all
29:22
along
29:24
the gospel of luke this is like a gospel
29:26
it was written obviously a long time
29:28
after jesus died but um there's someone
29:30
called zacchaeus trying to see jesus
29:31
preaching and uh and he says and he
29:33
sought to see jesus who he was and he
29:36
could not for the crowd because he was
29:37
low of stature so i think with zacchaeus
29:39
he was a small guy because he climbed up
29:41
a tree to be able to see jesus but he
29:43
might have only had to climb up the tree
29:44
because jesus was so sure that is an
29:45
excellent
29:46
story
29:47
yeah
29:48
that's a good point much more detailed
29:50
descriptions of jesus come from uh islam
29:53
which obviously was much later but uh in
29:55
quran and hadith
29:56
traditions they have lots of physical
29:58
descriptions of jesus uh because
30:00
muhammad i think met him when he went up
30:02
to heaven and there are various other
30:04
descriptions they often they contradict
30:05
each other so at some points he's curly
30:07
head and at some points he's straight
30:08
head although he might have had like
30:10
crimpers or something
30:12
also he doesn't have a beard in the
30:14
oldest portrait that we have of him
30:15
which is a syrian one in uh 235 a.d so
30:19
he didn't have a beard until about the
30:21
fourth century in depictions he was
30:23
based on uh like sort of classical roman
30:26
gods for the first few hundred years
30:27
wasn't he and he has sort of curly
30:28
blonde hair and like completely
30:30
well-shaven face well i just think it's
30:31
amazing how quickly we we are told this
30:34
is the image of someone from history
30:35
where it must be quite hard to have
30:37
known exactly what they look like and we
30:39
just accept it and we never question it
30:40
i mean shakespeare
30:42
by all accounts
30:44
mustn't have looked like he does because
30:46
the people who drew that of him they
30:47
didn't meet him he'd been dead for a
30:49
long time jane austen we only have one
30:52
picture of her drawn by her sister who
30:54
everyone said throughout her life was a
30:56
crap drawer
30:58
so it's just obviously not going to look
31:00
quite she's going on the bank notes
31:02
pretty soon the one that they the
31:03
picture that they've chosen is a very
31:05
prettified later victorian
31:07
representation of jane austen and it's
31:09
not anywhere near like the picture that
31:11
her sister drew of her so yeah it's very
31:13
very inaccurate um another person who
31:15
you wouldn't necessarily think um looked
31:18
as they did uh john wilkes booth
31:20
lincoln he was described as the
31:22
handsomest man in all america he wasn't
31:24
that tall but people said that it was
31:26
made up for by his extraordinary
31:28
presence and magnetism whereas english
31:31
political activist john wilkes without
31:34
the booth he was famously ugly uh he had
31:37
a sloping forehead hanging jaw bad teeth
31:39
bad breath a severe squint and he was
31:42
advised never to risk showing his face
31:45
to a pregnant woman
31:47
oh
31:48
oh my god but he didn't kill anyone
31:50
that's true
31:52
oh my god who said that was the end of
31:54
that sentence but he's my son and i love
31:56
him
31:58
who did say that about it uh i think it
32:00
was probably one of his detractors
32:02
those detractors they they've never got
32:04
a good word to say about you
32:06
um don't hear some cool stuff about
32:08
eyebrows yes please oh yeah okay um well
32:10
this is more about facial expressions
32:11
than eyebrows but there's an author
32:13
called david eagleman who is a great
32:15
writer about science and neuroscience
32:17
and
32:18
there's a fact in his latest book which
32:20
is just out that when people have had
32:21
botox they find it harder to recognize
32:24
facial expressions in other people
32:26
what yeah so they've tested people
32:29
who've not had botox treatments and
32:30
they've tested people who have had botox
32:32
treatments and if you have it's harder
32:34
for you to mirror their facial
32:35
expression and it's hard
32:37
literally for you to recognize what
32:39
you're looking at on someone else's face
32:41
so if dan looks baffled like you do now
32:44
then i would kind of copy what you're
32:46
doing and then i would empathize in your
32:48
baffle exactly but this is the other
32:50
cool thing is that married couples start
32:51
to look like each other over time
32:53
because they are constantly mirroring
32:55
each other's facial expressions and they
32:56
get the same patterns of wrinkles that
32:58
is excellent news for me but terrible
32:59
news for my wife
33:00
[Laughter]
33:03
also i was reading eyebrows eyebrows are
33:05
the most essential bit of your head
33:07
generally
33:09
going to go close second after brains
33:13
eyes mouth is your eyebrows are the 19th
33:16
most essential bit of your head this is
33:18
what i read and no they were saying
33:20
because for communication the eyebrows
33:21
actually they do the talking when you're
33:24
talking they if you're talking about it
33:26
not if you've kept your mouth on the
33:27
tick box sheet
33:31
if you were talking to me and you said
33:32
like oh can you believe this i with my
33:34
eyebrows would go whoa
33:36
see so if i shaved my eyebrows you would
33:38
you wouldn't know what i was thinking
33:39
yeah i think that's similar to the botox
33:40
thing i guess right yeah um i read
33:43
somewhere that eyebrows evolved uh
33:46
partly because they aid in sex
33:48
differentiation
33:49
in humans okay so people kept on
33:51
accidentally uh trying to procreate with
33:53
the same sex and so they gave men
33:55
slightly thicker eyebrows that did seem
33:57
to be what they were saying and you just
33:59
look at one of those two things
34:03
but here's the weird thing about that
34:04
which i thought that was weird but
34:06
apparently computers can determine
34:08
someone's gender
34:10
96 of the time just by looking at the
34:12
eyebrows and nothing else
34:14
kind of makes sense so we've kind of
34:16
assumed the mono brow is a is a negative
34:18
aesthetic feature on jesus oh you
34:20
haven't no i think i said it i think
34:22
that's great i i think people with
34:23
monobrows are the great heroes of planet
34:26
earth they constantly
34:27
again a bold claim well it is the most
34:29
essential bit of the head and i don't
34:31
forget that
34:33
who here has seen someone when the mono
34:35
brow and hasn't just stared at the
34:36
monobrow the entire conversation that
34:38
they've been having with them and that
34:40
says more about the person with the
34:41
monobrow than it does you the person
34:43
staring because it says to me that
34:44
they're going
34:45
i know it's here i know it's here and i
34:48
love it and that's i really like that i
34:50
think that i think that the bravest
34:51
humans are alive well so in okay
34:54
i have gone too far
34:56
i'm gonna call point of information on
34:58
firemen and so
35:00
it's weird my old list of best humans
35:02
was one people with mono brows two jesus
35:05
now jesus has made his way to the top of
35:08
the list it's very amazing
35:10
um so in tajikistan um mono brows are
35:14
attractive and sought after aren't they
35:16
so in women especially um and uh like
35:19
markets in tajikistan you can buy this
35:21
uh herb usma which women will buy and
35:25
you can rub it on your on your brow to
35:26
make sure you turn those two eyebrows
35:28
into one and this is a desirable thing
35:30
and i think that might be the only
35:31
country in the world where the monobrow
35:33
is genuinely desirable
35:34
well there may be a turning so at the
35:36
moment in the nba one of the biggest
35:38
stars and we're talking at someone who's
35:40
in the kind of level of michael jordan
35:42
and of modern day it's a guy called
35:44
anthony davis and he has a monobrow and
35:47
he has trademarked basically he's turned
35:49
his monobrow into a business his
35:51
monobrow has catchphrases that you're
35:53
not allowed to repeat on any product
35:55
it's fear of the brow and raise the brow
35:59
and he's turned his his mono brow into
36:01
an actual business now and i didn't know
36:03
that you could trademark so he's i mean
36:05
he so the quote from him is i don't want
36:07
anyone else to try and grow a unibrow
36:09
because of me and then try to make money
36:11
out of it
36:12
what how suspicious is this man of other
36:14
humans what would jesus have said
36:17
[Laughter]
36:19
but i kind of like i slightly like the
36:21
idea of trademarking because when i when
36:22
i realized you could trademark a simple
36:24
thing like that towards a facial feature
36:26
or something i thought who else has done
36:28
that and there's a guy michael buffer
36:30
he's a boxing announcer he was the
36:33
person to say
36:34
let's get ready to rumble that's his
36:36
trademark he has made since he
36:39
trademarked it since he first said it
36:40
and trademarked it four hundred thousand
36:42
american dollars from movies using it
36:45
from tv shows using his songs yeah
36:48
how hard is it to come up with a
36:49
different phrase that means basically
36:51
the same thing and then not have to pay
36:52
this guy four hundred thousand dollars
36:54
just say let's get ready to tumble
36:56
and then
36:57
it's washing machine wars
37:01
uh we're gonna have to wrap up really
37:03
soon we've got any final facts we wanna
37:04
throw in um the tactical name for the
37:06
monobrow is synofriss just so you know
37:08
yeah and the founder of criminology uh
37:11
cesare lombroso thought that uh sinofris
37:15
was a sure sign you were a criminal and
37:17
that's the founder of criminology one
37:19
other thing as well
37:20
you can tell if dogs like you because um
37:22
when they see you they lift their left
37:25
eyebrow upwards half a second after they
37:28
first see you
37:29
uh and that was a study done using
37:31
high-speed cameras
37:38
[Laughter]
37:42
just so that because actually it's a
37:43
very very microscopic little like you
37:45
can either see if its eyebrow is very
37:47
slightly raised or you can work out if
37:49
you are the person that provides its
37:51
food every day
37:52
one of those two things will tell you a
37:54
dog likes if a dog doesn't like you it
37:56
bites your penis
37:57
[Laughter]
38:00
no high-speed camera necessary for that
38:02
one
38:06
okay that's it that's all of our facts
38:08

murray anna chazinski and james harkin
00:34
and
00:35
once again we have gathered round the
00:37
microphones with our four favorite facts
00:40
from the last seven days and in no
00:41
particular order here we go starting
00:44
with you andrew hunter murray my fact
00:47
this week is that lord byron's nickname
00:49
for william wordsworth was william
00:51
turdsworth
00:55
he had a way with words he was an injury
00:58
were they they were living in the same
00:59
time they were made yeah yeah they were
01:00
well they weren't mates they weren't at
01:02
all they didn't yeah yeah byron thought
01:04
wordsworth was very boring and so he he
01:06
called him that there's this whole cache
01:07
of letters they've just found from lord
01:08
byron to a friend of his who was a
01:10
clergyman and uh yeah he
01:12
happens to slag off wordsworth as turds
01:14
worth and they go
01:16
i was quite surprised that the word turd
01:18
existed
01:19
so far back really oh yeah did you i
01:22
thought of it as more of a modern thing
01:23
i don't think of it as a word like
01:24
hyperlink
01:28
i thought they were exactly the same
01:30
thing
01:32
i had a look on hansard which is the
01:34
house of parliament kind of transcripts
01:36
and nobody has ever directly called
01:38
another mp a turd
01:40
in the entire history of parliament um
01:44
the closest anyone came was in a hunting
01:46
debate a few years ago when the mp for
01:48
worcester michael foster was described
01:51
as a nasty snide little turd but in that
01:54
case the mp was quoting harry enfield
01:57
directly
01:59
i think you're still calling someone
02:00
something when you are quoting someone
02:02
else yeah he was saying isn't it bad
02:04
that they called him this basically
02:07
you're a real [ __ ] said rick male in
02:09
the bottom
02:11
still calling the guy [ __ ] the world
02:13
record for uttering the word turd in
02:16
parliament what
02:17
world record well it's not really a
02:19
world direction because most world
02:21
records you have to bring someone to
02:22
record it officially in so that must
02:24
have been a phone call where they said
02:26
i've got a big idea i want to do in
02:27
parliament today are you up for coming
02:29
is it frequency or volume
02:31
it's frequency frequency is tony banks
02:34
the former minister for sport and he
02:36
said it three times in two years in the
02:39
late eighties
02:40
three times so it's very reasonable yeah
02:43
he could say it ten times in ten seconds
02:44
if he wanted to it's true all i'm saying
02:46
to the current mps that there is a
02:48
chance of breaking that record yeah
02:50
there was one time where he's i read all
02:52
i've read every time mp has ever said
02:54
turd and there was one when tony banks
02:56
said it and he said there was an
02:57
occasion when i walked around the corner
03:00
and was faced with a terrible dilemma of
03:02
seeing a one pound coin embedded in a
03:05
dog turd
03:10
and then he said
03:12
i managed to find a small boy who for
03:14
50p was prepared
03:19
what bill were they debating at the time
03:22
uh it was about it was about dog mess on
03:24
the streets okay
03:26
george bush used to call karl rove turd
03:28
blossom didn't he yeah oh chief of staff
03:31
karl rove but it was a compliment oh
03:33
yeah i think so toe blossom is a flower
03:35
apparently in california or wherever the
03:37
uh grows out of [ __ ] and george bush
03:40
said you know you're so great carl right
03:42
you can turn a bad thing into a good
03:43
thing so you're toad blossom also i
03:45
reckon that was an emergency meeting
03:47
with the biggest minds of america going
03:49
okay i just called karl rove turd
03:50
blossom someone turned this around on
03:53
its head
03:54
i just got one more thing from hansard
03:56
um
03:57
i'm so hoping to talk about lord byron
03:59
about romantic verse
04:01
um yeah well tough
04:04
um the first time that ever anyone said
04:06
[ __ ] in parliament
04:08
[Music]
04:10
was a guy called bill cash and he
04:12
described field martial lord carver as a
04:14
boring gold [ __ ]
04:16
in 1986 and the second use of the word
04:19
[ __ ]
04:20
was immediately afterwards with an
04:22
unnamed mp shouting he said [ __ ]
04:37
and byron liked to insult his fellow
04:39
poets a lot didn't he and if all
04:41
romantic poets had this all these
04:42
rivalries between them but um he said
04:44
about keats that he wrote piss a bed
04:46
poetry which i don't know what that
04:47
means if like if you what does it mean
04:49
you weren't the best person was an old
04:50
name for dandelion so maybe it was
04:52
another it just doesn't feel judging by
04:54
the tone of it i mean he goes on to say
04:57
uh no more keats i entreat flay him
04:59
alive if some of you don't i must skin
05:01
him myself there is no bearing the
05:03
dribbling idiotism of the mankin uh so i
05:06
don't think he was called
05:08
that i must say
05:10
he also said that his writing was a sort
05:12
of mental masturbation wow i think he
05:15
meant it yeah yeah yeah um i have quite
05:18
a good thing on a literary feud which
05:20
happened um
05:21
so
05:22
uh a.n wilson is a famous author and uh
05:26
he was writing a book about uh john
05:27
betzeman just decades ago and so was
05:29
another person called bevis hilliar and
05:32
uh a.n wilson was so rude about bevis
05:34
hilliar's book which came out first in
05:36
review and when he was writing his a
05:38
little while later he got this letter
05:40
from a mysterious french woman uh which
05:42
included this like gold dust for
05:44
interviewers it was a hitherto unknown
05:46
copy of a letter from john betramon to
05:49
one of his mistresses and wilson was so
05:51
excited and he you know printed the
05:53
letter in full in his book only for
05:54
bevis hillier to reveal that he had sent
05:56
the letter
05:58
and that it was an acrostic and the
06:00
first letter of every sentence spelt out
06:03
a and wilson is a [ __ ]
06:09
and they put it in his own book
06:13
i found out something really rude about
06:16
lord byron when he died
06:18
he was buried in a really odd way they
06:20
removed his organs and they put them in
06:22
jars and it was in a different country
06:23
and when he came back he was buried and
06:25
they weren't quite sure if it was
06:27
definitely him and so someone wanted to
06:29
find out and they made a discovery that
06:32
not many people have spoken about so
06:34
this was the sentence basically before
06:35
replacing the lid the vicar who was the
06:37
person who was looking for him uh noted
06:39
that his sexual organ showed quite
06:42
abnormal development he began to tap the
06:44
spot just above byron's knee and he said
06:47
he was built like a pony
06:52
that was in the tomb that's
06:54
wow
06:55
it's not a horse
06:58
you know for being really critical
07:03
um so when they um got his body out of
07:05
the tomb there was uh seven people
07:07
present so there was thomas jared barber
07:09
who was the cannon of the church there
07:11
was an unnamed doctor a surveyor called
07:14
nathaniel lane a local archaeologist a
07:17
photographer called mr bullock
07:19
and the local mp was there and i promise
07:22
you this was his actual name he was
07:24
called frederick seymour cox
07:29
no
07:30
no i promise honestly that's his name
07:32
honestly
07:35
you know what they say seymour cox by
07:37
name
07:38
[Laughter]
07:40
byron didn't wear underwear
07:42
apparently sorry and apparently this is
07:43
what was fashionable just couldn't find
07:45
them in his size
07:47
do you have that in pony
07:51
no that was and the reason was and it
07:53
was common like people like bo bromwell
07:55
and other fashionable people in byron's
07:57
era weren't wearing pants either was
07:58
because tight trousers were about in
08:00
fashion at the time and it was to avoid
08:02
um vpl do people still say vpl
08:05
they used to say when i was at school
08:06
what's vpr a visible panty line
08:10
they didn't say it was to avoid that the
08:11
historian uh whose book i was reading
08:13
said the line of the trousers was not to
08:15
be interrupted by underwear
08:17
and so he largely didn't wear any
08:18
underwear he bought a linen white linen
08:20
trousers in batches of 24 at a time
08:23
wow what was he doing to them
08:25
going through him
08:26
[Laughter]
08:30
i did not think this fact would be this
08:31
penicy and i'd like to put that on the
08:32
record
08:34
um we're gonna have to move on very soon
08:36
to our next fact oh really yeah yeah do
08:38
anything before we do um i have a fact
08:40
about nicknames
08:42
um at least ten kings of serbia had the
08:44
nickname the crowned
08:49
that's all they could think of for them
08:52
imaginative my favorite nickname of all
08:54
time uh there was a guy called leo the
08:56
second he was a roman emperor and he was
08:57
known as leo the butcher that's not my
08:59
favorite one um he was called the
09:01
butcher because he killed the patriarch
09:03
of alexandra's supporters and he was
09:05
called timothy the cat but
09:08
that's not my favorite either because
09:11
timothy the cat had replaced another guy
09:13
called timothy wobble hat
09:17
and nobody knows why he was called
09:19
timothy wubble hat there's two main
09:21
theories one of them is that he
09:23
flip-flopped between religious positions
09:25
and the other one is he had a wobbly hat
09:32
[Laughter]
09:35
okay let's move on to our second fact
09:37
it's time for our second fact and that
09:39
is james harkin okay my fact this week
09:42
is that if you grow a cost lettuce on a
09:44
spaceship it tastes like rocket
09:51
yeah so this is the first ever lettuce
09:53
that's been grown in space um it was a
09:55
red romaine lettuce which is also known
09:57
as a cos lettuce
09:59
and astronaut scott kelly said it tastes
10:01
good kind of like arugula and in this
10:04
country we call arugula rocket it's
10:06
weird that he didn't manage to make that
10:08
leap though from arugula to the word
10:10
rocket as someone living on a rocket
10:13
they called it apparently at the time a
10:15
giant leaf for mankind
10:20
also when they ate it apparently because
10:21
they had to freeze half of them i think
10:23
for sort of to return to earth for study
10:25
see if they picked up any radiation or
10:26
any microorganisms or anything but they
10:28
also um they ate the other half and they
10:30
were really happy of it and they put
10:32
extra virgin olive oil and balsamic
10:34
vinegar on the leaves but they had
10:35
already cleaned the leaves with
10:36
sanitizing wipes
10:38
i don't know why they bothered
10:39
mentioning that because that's just
10:40
normal isn't it
10:44
do you know the thing that
10:45
astronauts most like to eat in space
10:48
almost every single astronaut who comes
10:50
back from space says so there's a bunch
10:51
of staple meals that you get given in
10:53
space and you have i think they have
10:54
their meals repeated every eight days so
10:56
you've got eight days worth of meals and
10:57
then you have to go back to the start
10:59
and the one that they all love is prawn
11:01
cocktail and they all rave about it so
11:03
uh chris hadfield jim reilly jim lovell
11:06
they all say that shrimp cocktails their
11:08
favorite there was one astronaut who
11:10
said that um he because the astronauts
11:12
choose their menus before they go out
11:13
into space so if you're out there for a
11:14
year you have to write down what you
11:15
want it's a big commitment and he said
11:17
he has a word with the astronauts before
11:19
they're about to go out of space sort of
11:20
saying you know make sure you do the
11:22
prawn cocktail because i'm not going to
11:23
be giving you any of mine in space and
11:25
you're going to really really want it
11:27
but apparently it's delicious one thing
11:28
they do like is really spicy foods or
11:30
very flavoursome foods yeah and the
11:32
reason for that is because um the blood
11:34
goes into your sinuses because no
11:36
gravity as such
11:38
and you can't really taste things
11:39
properly
11:40
i did a um a radio show which we had
11:42
helen sharman on uh earlier this year
11:44
helen sharman first uh british astronaut
11:47
into space yeah back to you james
11:51
and she said that when she goes into
11:53
when she went into space she was warned
11:55
basically the russians are going to have
11:57
loads and loads of garlic and the
11:58
americans are going to have loads and
12:00
loads of chili and when you go up there
12:01
it is going to smell bad
12:04
and apparently you're warned not to say
12:05
anything when you go up there just
12:06
pretend that you can't smell it because
12:08
these people haven't seen a human for
12:10
you know months and months and the last
12:11
thing they want to do is you come in and
12:13
go
12:15
someone opened a window
12:19
you know how if you go into places like
12:21
the science museum or anywhere that has
12:24
astronaut based products you always buy
12:26
astronaut ice cream
12:27
astronaut-based products
12:29
products
12:30
and sainsbury in that section
12:33
can you tell me where the astronaut
12:34
products are well try aisle 10 9.
12:42
so anyway um
12:45
so you know so astronaut ice cream is a
12:47
massive thing and everyone buys it and
12:48
we all eat it and we go this tastes
12:50
horrible it's all but they eat it in
12:52
space it turns out that astronaut ice
12:54
cream was used for one mission and it
12:56
was in 1968 no one liked it it was too
12:58
crumbly it's never been out back again
13:01
and so the makers of it went what do we
13:02
do with this let's just pretend it's
13:04
still a thing so every time anyone eats
13:07
it and goes this tastes terrible but oh
13:08
doesn't it feel like space no one's
13:10
eating it it didn't work it's a failed
13:12
product when you say everyone buys it
13:14
and eats it
13:15
out of interest you come to my family
13:17
for
13:18
christmas um there are plans to farm in
13:21
space one of the advantages apparently
13:23
so it's good the idea of farming in
13:24
space for various reasons but one of
13:26
them is uh that the veggie project which
13:28
is what this is part of uh could be used
13:31
by astronauts in space for recreational
13:33
gardening during the long duration
13:35
missions which i quite like because they
13:37
all have their own allotments
13:39
they uh nasa once shipped a specific bit
13:41
of fruit up into space because they
13:44
wanted to do an experiment and a tribute
13:46
to isaac newton so they sent up a bit of
13:49
the tree
13:50
that newton had the idea under and they
13:53
sent it up with an apple because they
13:54
thought oh this would be great to film a
13:56
video of not only the bit of the tree
13:58
that taught us about gravity but also an
14:00
apple so they brought it up and they
14:02
were all set to film and it was looking
14:03
like it was going to be an amazing video
14:05
to put online and as they were about to
14:07
film they forgot to tell one of the
14:08
astronauts that they were doing that who
14:10
suddenly saw this floating apple going
14:12
oh god there's an apple
14:14
she ate the apple
14:16
and they went where's our apple and she
14:18
wrote
14:20
and then they had to film the video with
14:22
a pear
14:25
you can see on youtube there's a pair uh
14:27
floating in space i go and they don't
14:29
they don't mention it they're like wow
14:32
um the first ever swedish astronaut was
14:34
a guy called krista fugelsen
14:36
and he tried to take reindeer meat into
14:38
space because it was around christmas
14:40
time and it's a delicacy but he was told
14:42
it wasn't very christmassy what
14:45
to eat reindeer yeah it's like bringing
14:47
a piece of santa claus underneath
14:52
so on lettuce oh yeah lettuce has been
14:55
an aphrodisiac for 3000 years apparently
14:59
right and the reason is i didn't realize
15:00
this
15:01
so part of it is because of its upright
15:03
kind of phallic structure so it was
15:05
considered an aphrodisiac in ancient
15:06
egypt and continued to be considered
15:08
that throughout rome and greece and it's
15:10
got this upright structure and also it
15:11
secretes a latex at the bottom of it
15:14
which so it oozes like white liquid when
15:16
you cut it wait hang on did you say it's
15:18
the crease at the base yes well that's
15:20
one point of difference
15:24
if you're listening to this and that
15:26
sounds like you
15:28
you need to contact a doctor immediately
15:31
of course it's green
15:32
[Laughter]
15:35
but supposedly we've bred it so it's
15:36
much more domesticated and we sort of
15:38
tamed the wild letters which did have
15:39
all these sort of sexy connotations and
15:41
we've now got really boring iceberg
15:43
letters and things like that which are
15:44
not sexy at all yeah because it was too
15:46
rude before yeah it was post curfew
15:48
stuff
15:49
um i i found a couple of foods in space
15:52
that are not food
15:54
okay yes explain so the process of
15:57
falling into a black hole
15:59
is called
16:00
spaghettification that's an actual
16:03
scientific word and the idea is that
16:04
when you fall into a black hole as you
16:06
may do uh you get stretched out longer
16:09
and longer like spaghetti yeah and so
16:10
some scientists just said that
16:12
spaghettification yeah the tidal forces
16:13
end up stretching you like spaghetti
16:15
yeah yeah so that's what spaghetti is
16:17
yes
16:18
that's what spaghetti is that's how we
16:20
get spaghetti i'm giving up
16:22
the other one i found is that in the us
16:25
army there was a program back in the day
16:27
a future weapons office oh yeah for in
16:30
case we colonized the moon and they
16:32
invented a sausage gun
16:35
wait what it didn't shoot sausages but
16:37
it it's it did a process whereby you
16:40
make sausages coming out of the gun and
16:41
it was an actual thing that the pentagon
16:43
worked out and said that once the war
16:46
gets way enhanced and we're all on the
16:48
moon fighting you're going to need your
16:49
sausage gun it's not exciting so does it
16:51
have anything to do with sausage there's
16:53
no sausage it's not made of a the gun's
16:54
not made of sausages
16:56
to be honest i stopped reading when it
16:57
says sausage card
16:59
[Laughter]
17:02
sounds pretty exciting though doesn't it
17:04
sausage guns are the food
17:09
it's time for our third fact of the
17:10
evening and that is my fact my fact this
17:13
week is that scientists have grown an
17:16
ear
17:17
using
17:18
van gogh's dna
17:21
yeah
17:23
okay so so this is this is what it was
17:25
it was some an artist decided that they
17:27
wanted to do a project where they could
17:29
re-grow an ear and they found on the
17:32
back of a stamp some saliva from van
17:35
gogh
17:36
and they used it and they contacted one
17:38
of the nephews great great great nephews
17:41
of van gogh and they managed to get some
17:43
of their cells off them and they created
17:45
a kind of scaffolding and they've
17:46
regrown the ear the left-hand side ear
17:49
that would have been sliced off when he
17:51
sliced it off that's all
17:53
are we totally 100 sure that whoever it
17:55
was that stole van gogh's ear in the
17:57
first place hasn't been bearing this
17:59
burden of guilt for the last 150 years
18:01
and thought i've got to let it out and
18:02
they've just put it on the market and
18:04
said i grew it
18:07
but no one knows what happened to it
18:08
right is it not supposed to be given to
18:10
a prostitute well yeah so it's thought
18:12
they gave it to a prostitute but there's
18:13
another theory that gogan uh chopped it
18:16
off so i think gogan was living with van
18:18
gogh at the time and i think van gogh
18:19
liked goga more than gogan like van gogh
18:22
and gogan was also like a you know
18:24
ardent fencer and they used to have a
18:26
lot of fights
18:27
and so people have pieced together this
18:28
information thought what happened is
18:30
they had a fight gogan chopped van
18:32
gogh's ear off and then van gogh was
18:33
such a needy weird housemate and gogan
18:35
wanted to move out anyway and he was
18:37
like i won't tell anyone i'll just say
18:39
that i chopped off my own ear and i sent
18:41
it to a prostitute is that will you stay
18:43
if i do that and that's a genuine theory
18:46
yeah i've i've had arguments with
18:48
housemates before
18:51
and it sounds plausible
18:54
you know you can get a disappearing ear
18:56
van gogh mug
18:57
[Laughter]
18:58
when you pour in hot water his ear
19:00
disappears oh but it's replaced by a
19:02
bandage it's really cool oh that's
19:04
really cool i think i'm saying it wrong
19:05
it should be van
19:06
something but
19:08
yeah yeah so it's very hard to say his
19:11
name um a very old thing that happened
19:13
on this episode was that i once said uh
19:16
in a fact van gogh because that's what i
19:18
thought his name was and we got i got a
19:20
tweet uh when the show went out and i
19:23
just i just want to read you the tweet
19:25
episode 28 and 10 minutes 55 seconds
19:30
why did you incredibly stupidly
19:33
and ignorantly
19:35
say van gogh
19:37
instead of van gaal
19:40
and then i wrote back to him because i
19:41
got really angry but i wrote back to him
19:42
saying uh uh sorry uh and wait till you
19:45
hear how i say covered garden
19:48
what i wanted to say was
19:50
[ __ ] yourself
19:55
[Applause]
19:56
so
19:57
on ears
19:59
a woman
20:00
recently grew an ear on her arm and that
20:03
was
20:04
because she'd had a kind of skin cancer
20:06
that meant her ear had she didn't have
20:09
an ear anymore and she wanted to
20:10
regenerate her ear and so it was grown
20:12
on her arm as does sometimes happen so
20:14
there's another guy in china i think who
20:16
had a nose grown on his forehead which
20:18
if you google image it is very
20:20
impressive and you know it was used to
20:21
replace his nose a couple of months
20:23
later anyway this woman had an ear grown
20:24
on her arm and it was in order to be
20:26
transplanted back onto her where her ear
20:28
should be a couple of months later so
20:30
the the surgeon who did it said she had
20:32
some fun with it if the kids got into
20:34
trouble she'd roll up her sleeve and say
20:36
tell it to the arm
20:37
[Laughter]
20:40
in 2009 um this is a news article
20:43
doctors have saved a woman's severed
20:45
lobe by stitching it to her bottom
20:49
julia schwartz's right ear was bitten
20:51
off by her best friend in a fight over a
20:53
lover
20:55
and they stitched it onto her ass and
20:56
kept it there until they could put it
20:58
because she had too much scarring there
20:59
they couldn't put it on straight away so
21:00
they stitch it onto her ass but why the
21:02
why the ass
21:04
it's about availability of blood vessels
21:06
isn't it an availability of skin i guess
21:07
there's a lot of skin on your ass um all
21:09
right there was someone else
21:13
there was someone else i really enjoyed
21:15
this i can't remember what paper it was
21:16
in but um
21:18
it was someone who'd uh uh someone who
21:21
like a design uh a mechanic or something
21:23
who cut off the tip of his finger or
21:25
half of his finger and had to have it
21:28
regrown again they thought let's try and
21:29
regrow this uh on a part of your body so
21:32
that it gets fed by the blood vessels
21:33
and so that the muscle can we grow and
21:35
the skin can grow around it and so they
21:37
sewed his finger onto his stomach but i
21:40
think i read this article on maybe the
21:43
huffington post and on the picture of it
21:45
they've blacked out like you would if
21:47
someone was showing their penis or
21:48
something they blacked out the bit where
21:50
you see the finger grafted onto the
21:53
stomach and then you can only see it if
21:55
you scroll right down to the bottom and
21:57
there's a big black box over and i think
21:58
it cause it does look a bit phallic but
22:00
it i mean it's not a penis it's just a
22:01
finger on somebody's stomach when you
22:03
say it looks like a penis does it have
22:05
white stuff coming from the base
22:07
[Laughter]
22:09
i was when i was looking into van gogh
22:11
there's a van gogh there's a theory
22:14
there's an actual theory that he used to
22:16
paint at night with candles on his hat
22:18
so that he could see
22:20
in the evening and his nickname was
22:22
flamie hat
22:23
[Laughter]
22:25
there are many theories as to why
22:29
um can i mention another thing about
22:31
this ear which is really exciting so
22:33
because it was done by an artist you can
22:34
actually visit the ear that's been grown
22:37
it's uh it's in new york city and
22:38
they've done it in a way that you can
22:40
talk to the ear
22:42
and
22:42
i don't i don't fully understand the
22:44
science of it but it can't hear anything
22:46
by the way
22:48
well from what i gather when you talk to
22:50
it the ear kind of slightly moves in a
22:52
way that it's going no
22:55
it responds to what you're saying and
22:57
the first person to speak to this year
22:59
when it was uh initially debuted in
23:01
germany was noam chomsky
23:04
yeah so
23:05
and then the year went what and we don't
23:07
know what he said but the really cool
23:09
thing about this work of art is that
23:10
it's called sugar babe
23:12
um the idea is that it's about the uh
23:14
there's a philosophical argument called
23:16
the ship of theseus right which is if
23:18
you replace every bit of a ship one by
23:20
one at what point is it no longer the
23:22
original ship and this applies to the
23:24
band the sugar babes
23:30
can i just i have something so cool on
23:32
acoustics which i didn't know and which
23:34
is sounds only tennessee related but you
23:36
know uh hearing hearing trumpets ear
23:38
trumpets uh that they used to use before
23:40
hearing aids were invented the reason
23:42
they were invented it was in the 17th
23:44
century and it was because puritan
23:46
couples uh in america when they went out
23:49
to dine with each other they wanted to
23:51
have private conversations but they had
23:52
to sit opposite each other because there
23:53
was no intimacy allowed uh and so they
23:56
sat opposite each other but they wanted
23:57
to have private conversation raunchy you
23:59
know chats or whatever and so the ear
24:01
trumpet was apparently invented in order
24:04
that you could be sitting there with
24:05
your boyfriend and he could be saying
24:06
into this end of the trumpet you know i
24:08
really want to have sex with you
24:14
i wish that all
24:16
adult chat lines were staffed by women
24:18
with ear trumpets
24:21
um can i tell you one cool thing about
24:23
ears yes please the butterflies have
24:25
ears on their wings
24:28
and complete with eardrums their proper
24:30
ears but they use them to hear bats
24:32
ultrasound and when scientists play
24:34
ultrasound to butterflies they start
24:36
flying in crazy patterns sort of doing
24:38
um evasion tactics to get away from a
24:40
predator and butterflies evolved at the
24:43
same time that bats developed the
24:44
ability to use echolocation and develop
24:46
their big ears and the theory is
24:49
that butterflies started flying in the
24:51
daytime to avoid bats or in other words
24:54
bats invented butterflies
24:59
yeah
25:00
let's move on to our final fact of the
25:02
show and that is anna chazinski yeah my
25:05
fact is that the uh the larger pacific
25:08
striped octopus catches its prey by
25:10
sneaking up behind it and tapping it on
25:12
the shoulder
25:15
um yeah this has only just been
25:16
documented this behavior well it was
25:18
actually documented once in the 1970s
25:21
and a biologist wrote a report on it no
25:23
one believed it and it was ignored and
25:25
it's only just been rediscovered the
25:27
behavior of the larger pacific striped
25:28
octopus but the way that it hunts is um
25:31
it sneaks up it's called a slow bounce
25:34
so it's like a grandmother's footsteps
25:36
and it like sits there hiding on the
25:39
sand um it's only you know it's only
25:41
small it's only a few inches big and
25:42
it's chasing your shrimp and it will
25:44
like sneak a bit further and further up
25:46
behind it when the shrimp can't see and
25:47
eventually when it's close enough it
25:49
gets one of its tentacles or its arms or
25:52
its legs or whatever you want to call
25:53
them and it gets its leg around the
25:55
front of the shrimp and it prods it here
25:58
and then the shrimp's like oh [ __ ]
25:59
there's a predator here and it rebounds
26:01
right back into its mouth
26:04
and that's how it does it that's amazing
26:06
it's so good
26:08
look it up there's a video of it which
26:09
is excellent of an octopus sneaking up
26:11
on a shrimp another thing octopuses do
26:12
this is so cool they fling sand or
26:15
debris in each other's faces when
26:16
they're fighting so you know scenes in
26:17
films where the villain throws some sand
26:20
into the hero's eyes they do that when
26:22
in a movie
26:24
oh my god dan every movie do you not see
26:26
the the good the bad and the octopus
26:32
but they do it with shells and dave like
26:34
hard shells and debris as well so they
26:36
have a kind of
26:38
water ejector system um which means they
26:41
pick up a shell and they propel it with
26:43
this water ejector system at their
26:45
enemies and knock them
26:47
so yeah this is actually amazing you
26:49
mentioned this ages ago in the office so
26:51
they they throw a shell and then they
26:53
have this water pistol that launches the
26:56
shell behind it so it picks up speed
26:57
like a bullet towards
26:59
like a sausage bullet
27:02
like a moon sausage bullets
27:05
um they also by the way they carry armor
27:08
with them so if they're going into
27:10
battle or if they predict battle may
27:12
happen to them they carry
27:14
coconut shells
27:16
often two at a time and they will they
27:18
will travel on the seabed so their
27:20
enemies think they're a horse
27:21
[Laughter]
27:24
[Applause]
27:25
but they'll jet they genuinely have
27:26
coconuts and they have the shells and
27:28
then as soon as uh the enemies start
27:30
attacking they'll bring the coconut
27:32
shells up over them like i swear to god
27:34
this is true i don't it's amazing again
27:36
videos of that aren't there and they
27:37
pull the coconut shells in to create one
27:39
coconut but if you try to drink the milk
27:40
from inside it there's an octopus
27:43
they seem to have personalities
27:44
octopuses and lots of scientists say
27:46
that if you watch an octopus it watches
27:48
you back one scientist he had teased the
27:50
octopus he'd offered a fish and then
27:52
he'd really quickly taken it away again
27:53
right and then when he got into the
27:55
office the next day as soon as he walked
27:57
through the door the octopus had been
27:59
waiting in his tank and squirted him
28:00
with this waterfall with a huge jet of
28:02
water however there were already loads
28:05
of splashes of water on the wall which
28:07
implies the octopus had been doing
28:09
target practice
28:11
at the scientist height and was just
28:13
waiting for him to come in in the
28:14
morning so he could get him with water
28:15
isn't that incredible yeah that's
28:17
amazing
28:18
well the endless conundrum with
28:19
octopuses is uh octopuses uh that they
28:24
hate each other they like to be solitary
28:25
except for the larger pacific striped
28:27
octopus by the way if there's one here
28:28
they're really sociable but that's
28:29
really weird they're the first species
28:32
that's been seen to be sociable so
28:33
actually there was in the experiment
28:34
that uh my fact was about uh the one of
28:37
the scientists said it was really
28:39
amazing watching them they're so
28:40
sociable i put two and a tank together
28:42
and they didn't kill each other
28:45
but most of them hate each other but
28:46
they have to have sex in a very intimate
28:48
way which is quite unusual um for
28:50
animals like that so the way they have
28:51
sex is they insert their sort of penis
28:54
arm uh into the woman
28:59
they have a penis arm
29:01
yep
29:02
everyone has a penis arm
29:05
that's what right or left handed means
29:11
um so the world record for um an octopus
29:14
opening a jar is 54 seconds
29:18
and this all kind of started there was
29:19
an experiment at seattle aquarium where
29:21
they gave child-proof bottles to um
29:24
octopuses to see if they could open them
29:26
and the first attempt for opening one of
29:28
these um by a pacific octopus as well
29:30
called billy it took him 55 minutes to
29:33
open it oh her sorry and within um a bit
29:36
of practice she could open these within
29:38
five minutes but roland anderson the
29:40
lead researcher said these results do
29:43
not imply octopuses are smarter than
29:45
children
29:48
it's it's easy to open child proof stuff
29:50
once you've worked out the trick yeah
29:52
that's like as soon as you know to push
29:53
it before you twist it then you're gold
29:55
i can't believe it in five minutes after
29:56
that
29:57
there was an american group called safe
29:59
kids who tried out whether children
30:01
could open these or not uh they gave the
30:03
containers to the kids and said we want
30:04
you to open them three two one go and
30:06
then the kids were asked to open them as
30:08
quickly as they could and every single
30:10
child in the group could open at least
30:11
one of the bottles that they were given
30:13
and olivia who opened two within a
30:15
minute was interviewed by researcher she
30:18
said
30:19
i'm really fast because i'm a big girl
30:23
it's nice isn't it it's very nice
30:26
there's an indonesian species of octopus
30:28
where they sometimes build bunkers they
30:31
don't build bunkers
30:33
they just dig in the sand the male stays
30:35
in a little a hole in the sandy's belt
30:37
and is lined with mucus
30:38
um and he sends his arm over across the
30:41
sea floor and down into the den of the
30:43
female next door and has sex with her
30:44
that way
30:46
but sometimes the females go out mid-sex
30:49
i don't know on an errand or something
30:53
if i had a pound
30:54
[Laughter]
31:00
but we're never short of groceries in my
31:02
house
31:08
[Laughter]
31:17
is it an accident because it's a massive
31:18
danger in october sex of the female
31:21
eating the male because they love to eat
31:22
male octopuses and um so the best time
31:25
apparently if you're a male octopus out
31:27
there to have sex with a female is while
31:29
she's eating because then she's
31:30
distracted or while she's foraging
31:32
so maybe he's chosen to go for it that
31:34
way but that's why they go for the long
31:36
distance sex isn't it to try and like
31:38
make sure they don't get eaten and
31:39
sometimes she will suddenly leap out and
31:41
propel herself towards him and swallow
31:43
him whole or strangle him to death
31:45
sometimes during sex
31:47
as in like zenya olitop does anyone
31:48
remember her in the 90's bond films yeah
31:51
uh they'll have sex get their sperm in
31:54
them and then strangle them to death and
31:55
eat them it's like an all-in-one kind of
31:57
deal
32:00
okay that's it that's all of our facts
32:03

00:11
hello
00:13
and welcome to another episode of no
00:15
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:17
this week coming to you from cambridge
00:19
my name is dan schreiber and please
00:20
welcome to the stage it's the regular
00:22
elves andy murray anna chazinski and
00:24
james harkin
00:31
and once again we have gathered around
00:34
the microphones with our four favorite
00:35
facts from the last seven days and in no
00:37
particular order here we go starting
00:40
with you
00:40
andy murray
00:42
my fact this week is that before trains
00:45
had corridors guards had to climb along
00:47
the outside of the carriage to check
00:49
your ticket
00:52
that is so amazing they did it while the
00:54
train was moving
00:56
and this was a thing this this happened
00:59
um carriages used to not be you couldn't
01:01
go through a carriage you would get in
01:03
at one end they closed the door they'd
01:04
lock it you're locked in for the whole
01:06
journey then at the other end they'd
01:08
unlock it now you'd get and it was just
01:09
across the train instead of
01:11
front to back through the train were you
01:13
locked in for health and safety reasons
01:15
required i think partly you were locked
01:17
in so you wouldn't try and sneak into
01:18
first class
01:19
wow yeah i don't think they were that
01:21
bothered about health and safety if you
01:22
have a guy climbing on the outside well
01:24
indeed that's that's where it seems to
01:26
fall down how did it get was there a
01:28
ledge there was a little uh they call it
01:30
a running board so just on the outside
01:32
of the carriage at the bottom just a
01:33
little plate that you could clamber but
01:35
it wasn't even a continuous running
01:36
board it was intermittent so you had to
01:39
climb along between the bits and the
01:41
people did suggest why don't we give
01:42
people a continuous running board and
01:43
the train company said no no passengers
01:45
will use them to sneak into first class
01:50
and how good was first class
01:52
it was
01:53
it was awful because it was 1840. well
01:55
yeah these people so desperate
01:58
i bet in those days you just had to
02:00
always know where your ticket was
02:02
because if you were stuck there going oh
02:04
where is it this guy's outside going
02:06
find them
02:11
how fast did the trains used to go well
02:13
these are really early ones so maybe i
02:15
mean about 40 miles an hour comfortably
02:18
people thought that if they went over a
02:19
certain speed then your body wouldn't be
02:22
able to deal with it didn't they yeah
02:23
they said that um the human body would
02:25
not be able to endure speeds of 25 miles
02:27
per hour someone said that to start off
02:29
with and then someone else in america
02:31
wrote that if a woman's body accelerated
02:33
past 50 miles an hour then her uterus
02:36
would go shooting out of her body
02:41
and that's the plot of speed 3.
02:46
you'll never look at sandra bullock the
02:47
same way again
02:50
when trains first got to the isle of
02:51
wight
02:52
um well they were taken to the isle of
02:54
wight obviously
02:57
it wasn't a rogue train which
03:00
went off the rails
03:01
[Laughter]
03:03
um so the first ever journey it was a
03:05
four mile trek and it went along its
03:07
route in less than ten minutes and i
03:09
think that's i've worked worked at about
03:11
30 miles an hour give or take we're not
03:12
sure exactly the time that was
03:14
apparently faster than anyone had ever
03:16
traveled on the isle of wight until that
03:17
point in history
03:19
which is pretty cool
03:20
um i was reading about in the 1800s 1827
03:23
there was a race between a train and a
03:26
horse um but and check it out this is a
03:28
bit unfair on the horse's side the horse
03:30
was towing a train
03:31
[Music]
03:34
that was unfair
03:37
it was back in the day when uh horses
03:39
used to pull trains uh prior to the
03:41
engine and so this was an example of
03:43
showing that potentially an engine could
03:45
beat uh a horse and it probably would
03:48
have but one of the wheels or a little
03:50
band around the wheels burst and so they
03:52
had to stop the train so it wasn't the
03:53
lead and then the horse took over but
03:54
there was an actual let's have this as a
03:56
big race horse versus train
03:58
so things were always going wrong so at
04:00
the um 1829 display of you know which
04:03
train is the best train ten different
04:06
types of train entered this competition
04:08
um five of them didn't even show up on
04:10
the day so i think broke down before
04:12
they made it to the venue um so five
04:14
trains entered stevenson's rocket being
04:16
one of them um and only one of them
04:18
completed the trial so stevenson's
04:19
rocket didn't win because it was the
04:20
best it won because it was the only
04:22
train that managed to not break or so
04:25
the cycloped remember the cycloped train
04:27
which is one of them i don't remember it
04:29
personally
04:30
i mean i know i'm old
04:32
i did look at you directly there for a
04:33
reason
04:34
uh the cycloped train sounds like quite
04:36
a cool design which is a it's led by a
04:39
horse but it's a horse on a treadmill
04:41
and the horse the treadmill that the
04:42
horse is walking on powers the train
04:45
oh yeah yeah yeah so really cool but the
04:47
horse at the demonstrations the horse
04:49
fell through the floor of the train and
04:51
so that failed obviously i once uh fell
04:55
on a treadmill
04:57
anyone want to hear that no
04:59
really oh okay i was i was a kid it was
05:01
my first time on a treadmill one of the
05:03
ones that you put the actual is electric
05:05
and it was and it was going like crazy i
05:06
put it up to 10 and i thought this is
05:08
going to be incredible and i tested with
05:10
my hands on the side whether i could run
05:12
on it i thought yeah that's easy so yeah
05:14
with one jump i just jumped onto it and
05:16
immediately my two legs went
05:18
and i fell on my face on it i got shot
05:21
off the back but it was on a carpet and
05:22
so everything went right off it except
05:24
for my face and for about half a minute
05:26
i was going
05:29
that explains an awful lot
05:32
it does also explain why you didn't get
05:34
into ok go
05:38
you guys know about the city of crush in
05:40
texas
05:41
no
05:42
it was for an extremely brief period the
05:44
second largest city in texas this is in
05:46
1896. and that was because 40 000 people
05:49
came to it and that was because
05:52
someone had decided to stage a train
05:54
crash um so this was forty thousand
05:58
people went to it was organized by this
06:00
guy called uh william crush uh and he
06:03
said my name because
06:06
he said he was going to just fire two
06:08
trains towards each other so he had like
06:09
four miles of track created for the
06:11
purpose and 40 000 people came and there
06:14
was such demand that people did have to
06:15
sit on top of trains in order to get
06:16
there because they couldn't squeeze into
06:18
the carriages um and then at 5 p.m these
06:21
two trains started going towards each
06:23
other picking up speed picking up speed
06:25
and uh crush stood right in the middle
06:27
of the railway on a white horse and then
06:29
he waved a big flag saying they're
06:30
coming it's all right he survived oh
06:31
thank god
06:33
he stepped out of the way sort of at the
06:35
last minute the two trains crashed into
06:36
each other um both of their boilers
06:38
exploded and a bunch of people died
06:41
so when he said it's all right
06:43
it wasn't completely all right well
06:45
here's the thing crush got fired that
06:47
evening and then the company that he
06:49
worked for relented and hired him again
06:51
the next day the rail company and he
06:52
worked at the same rail company for the
06:54
rest of his life
06:55
what um we're going to need to move on
06:57
to the next fact soonish
06:59
there's a guy called andrew dowd he's
07:01
from wigan up in my neck of the woods
07:03
and he visited all
07:05
2548 railway stations in britain between
07:09
2010 and 2014 in his car
07:16
need we ask why
07:18
um well people asked him that in the
07:20
newspaper articles but he didn't really
07:21
kind of have a very good reason
07:23
he said i started doing it round near
07:25
where i lived and i kind of enjoyed it
07:27
so i thought i'd do the whole country
07:29
and they said to him asked him what he
07:30
did and he said i take a little look
07:33
around if it's interesting but most
07:35
aren't very interesting
07:36
[Laughter]
07:38
wow
07:39
why not you know i like to think there's
07:41
an equivalent train driver who's
07:42
planning to visit all the petrol
07:44
stations in britain
07:45
on the train
07:48
wouldn't it be visiting all the car
07:49
parking spaces you're right it was a bad
07:51
analogy yeah that's better nobody's
07:53
harder to visit all the car parking
07:55
spaces because there are so many these
07:56
days
07:58
anyway
08:00
okay time for
08:03
fact number two
08:05
oh
08:06
and that is james harkin
08:09
okay my fact this week is that ernest
08:12
shackleton's dog's names included
08:15
slippery slobbers satan painful swanker
08:19
bummer and bob
08:21
[Music]
08:23
it's wankershaw for his wanker do we
08:26
know the history um well they were they
08:28
all had different names for different
08:29
reasons i got this fact actually from a
08:31
guy on twitter called at davepain164
08:34
and it made me laugh and so i thought
08:36
i'd use it on the podcast and it it kind
08:37
of fits in with one thing that i like
08:39
which is just going through lists of
08:40
ridiculous data and trying to find funny
08:42
bits or whatever um but they they got
08:44
the names for lots of different reasons
08:46
some of them were nicknames to people on
08:48
the ship so it could have been short for
08:50
he's wanker i guess it's possible um the
08:53
dogs all came from canada and they had
08:55
names already so some of them like bob
08:57
was already a name and they just kept
08:58
that um but some of them were changed
09:00
like bismarck napoleon and three dogs
09:03
all named carlos
09:05
wow they had to change
09:08
what a great name for a dog
09:11
what's the in just like a basic two
09:13
sentences or a few more shackleton just
09:16
the background of shackleton uh polar
09:17
explorer um went down to try and get to
09:20
the south pole didn't quite make it
09:22
became the furthest south uh that anyone
09:24
had ever got adminson uh beat him to the
09:26
south pole and so he went on another
09:28
expedition to go across the whole of the
09:30
south pole from one side to the other uh
09:32
and then that ended in disaster again
09:34
and he became famous for a big sort of
09:36
escape from um the the ice-filled island
09:39
of elephant island okay and now you
09:41
don't need to watch the 12-part
09:42
documentary
09:45
i like this uh so there were a bunch of
09:48
quite interesting people on board the
09:50
expedition so they had like uh official
09:52
photographer um frank hurley who used to
09:56
like risk his life trying to get good
09:57
photos because his only priority on this
09:59
life endangering expedition was to make
10:01
sure he could make money when he sold
10:02
the pictures when he got back so he'd
10:03
climb right to the top of the mast or go
10:05
out you know onto the yard arm and hang
10:07
from it to take good photos and they
10:09
also had uh an on-ship artist and i just
10:13
like this quote i can't remember where i
10:14
read this uh in an account of when they
10:16
were stranded on elephant island so they
10:17
were sort of like we're definitely going
10:18
to die now no one's going to find us
10:20
here how on earth are we going to
10:21
survive and at one point it was said the
10:23
ship's artist george marston allowed his
10:26
remaining oil paints to be used as glue
10:29
to make the canvases cover the shelter
10:30
properly and i like the idea that there
10:32
was a little bit of a debate there
10:34
um i have more facts about the dogs oh
10:36
yeah so they were trapped on the ice for
10:37
months and months and months i think 15
10:39
months maybe i mean an amazing amount of
10:41
time um so frank hurley wrote loads of
10:43
notes about all the dogs and there was
10:45
shakespeare uh steamer wallaby satan who
10:48
was a treacherous brute
10:50
sue is a flirt
10:55
they've been on the ice for a long time
10:59
[Laughter]
11:01
um and then there was snapper does not
11:04
snap at all
11:06
and they built they built the dogs a
11:08
town they built a little town they
11:09
called dog town they built a load of dog
11:11
igloos out of ice and wood um and they
11:14
built a pup loo for the puppies that
11:16
have been born and they built a pig loo
11:18
because they had some pigs with them as
11:19
well people yeah that's great isn't it
11:21
it's really cool um but they ate a lot
11:23
of these animals
11:26
and they yeah they had a ship's cat as
11:28
well they did the ship's cat was called
11:29
mr chippy this is jippy uh yes mrs
11:32
chippy was always one of the snails yeah
11:34
that's right and it belonged to the
11:36
cruise carpenter harry magnus
11:38
and they decided to kill it because it
11:40
was using up a lot of the meat um but
11:42
harry mcnis was not very happy about
11:44
that at all and got into a massive fight
11:45
with shackleton didn't he yeah
11:48
he was scottish wasn't he yeah that's
11:49
right harry magnesh and someone who met
11:51
him said the only thing i ever heard him
11:53
talk about was the fact that shackled
11:54
and killed his cat which
11:56
you know they were in a difficult spot i
11:58
think but he he then really got furious
12:01
and he and shackleton as you say had a
12:03
huge route and he was the only one of
12:04
the expedition i think all 28 men
12:06
survived there was a separate supply
12:08
mission where a few of them died but all
12:09
of the men with shackleton survived it
12:11
was this huge survival story he was the
12:13
only one later denied this polar medal
12:16
that all the others got oh really but
12:17
insubordination wow you know that um
12:19
shackleton's medals went up for sale in
12:22
auction not too long ago and they got a
12:24
ridiculous amount of money it was about
12:26
800 000 pounds and i started looking
12:28
into the kind of stuff that gets
12:30
auctioned off from those trips
12:32
discovered that um this is quite recent
12:34
um one of the biscuits that they didn't
12:36
eat went up for auction recently and was
12:39
bought for 1 250 euros
12:42
i definitely would have bought that
12:43
that's so cheap a biscuit from a
12:45
shackleton adventure they they ate the
12:47
dogs before eating that [ __ ]
12:51
no because probably someone when we
12:52
bring this back this biscuit will be
12:53
worth a fortune
12:55
no but so um apparently um shackleton uh
12:58
was giving one of his fellow explorers
12:59
frank wild a biscuit from one of the
13:01
rations uh and wilde recorded in the
13:03
diary and this is how spare food was
13:05
back then
13:06
thousands of pounds would not have
13:08
bought that biscuit so that's how great
13:10
it was and so it's quite nice that now
13:11
it has gone for over a thousand pounds i
13:14
love so like because i read also as well
13:16
recently in an auction um
13:18
the head of the scouts robert
13:19
baden-powell
13:20
um a letter that he wrote to an
13:22
autograph hunter saying you should not
13:24
become an autograph hunter recently sold
13:26
at an auction to an autograph hunter
13:29
it's great when auctions have that
13:31
little twist on them yeah there was
13:32
another biscuit um do you want to hear
13:34
about the world's most expensive biscuit
13:36
yeah do you just happen to have a
13:38
biscuit factory well i i also saw the
13:40
thing about the shackleton business oh
13:41
right and then i thought what's the most
13:43
of biscuits ever gone for um so a few
13:45
weeks this is a few weeks ago it
13:46
happened in october this year um a
13:48
biscuit from the titanic was auctioned
13:50
what yeah
13:52
it sold for 15 000 pounds wait how where
13:54
how did a biscuit survive had made its
13:57
way into a lifeboat
13:59
sorry i mean someone who was it it was
14:02
in a box and someone
14:04
um took the box and when they escaped
14:06
the ship and it was in a sealed iron box
14:08
or something so and that was what those
14:09
that was one of the lifeboats which was
14:11
picked up so yeah that's wow so that's
14:13
the most expensive biscuit ever so far
14:15
yeah i don't want to rule out any future
14:16
biscuits let's go for more
14:19
um i had a look for some unusual dog
14:21
names
14:22
and um
14:23
there was a website called
14:25
petinsurance.com that collected a load
14:27
of unusual dog names
14:29
but at the same time by coincidence i
14:31
also found a list of the most unusual
14:34
nicknames that men have for their
14:35
genitals
14:38
are we going to play dog or genitals
14:42
okay i'll just read them in the order i
14:45
have them uh baron von furry pants
14:47
[Laughter]
14:51
dog correct
14:53
lord chubby prune face
14:56
genital litter
14:59
no that's a dog
15:02
simon wiggles potato
15:05
lemon what
15:06
simon wiggles potato genital no dog
15:11
you got a dirty mind
15:13
okay prince patches oh hoolihan the
15:16
third of wilshire
15:19
dog dog yeah they were all dogs
15:22
i wouldn't give you any genitals
15:24
in the 15th century the duke of york
15:26
this is what he spent his time doing in
15:28
those days he wrote a list of 1100 names
15:31
that he considered appropriate for
15:32
hunting dogs
15:34
to advise people what to call their dogs
15:36
so there were things like troy genitals
15:38
genital yeah
15:40
um nose wise
15:42
nameless
15:44
apparently clench
15:45
[Laughter]
15:48
brag ringwood and hold fast
15:51
so there you go that's what you're
15:52
allowed to call your dogs are going to
15:53
the duke of york in the 15th century if
15:55
you ever find yourself there
15:56
can i bring up a famous dog name yes
15:58
please so lassie oh yeah lassie was
16:01
originally called powell and that that
16:02
was the dog's name powell powell did all
16:04
the movies it was the single dog that
16:06
did it so when powell died they then
16:08
took the litter and when they grew up
16:10
they replaced lassie they became the
16:12
next lassies so every single lassie that
16:14
you'd see in the early days was a
16:16
descendant of the original lassie yeah
16:19
and then there was a huge controversy i
16:20
think it was in 1997 where suddenly the
16:23
first non-blood-related lassie was used
16:26
and there were yeah
16:28
and there were genuine protests and
16:30
people said this is not on and they were
16:32
like well no but we don't and so they
16:34
they buckled and then they did bring in
16:36
another descendant of one of the
16:38
descendants of lassie and then again
16:40
when another revival happened they
16:41
brought in another unrelated
16:43
non-bloodline dog again people freaked
16:46
out and it's been like that for ages up
16:48
until very recently and now one of the
16:51
bloodline has come back into the fold
16:53
and is the current lassie
16:56
that's like saying that james bond
16:58
should be played by sean connery's
16:59
grandson
17:02
i just i just i love that somewhere
17:04
somewhere in the world someone is
17:06
protesting strongly against something
17:08
and we have no idea for years and years
17:09
do we know how many was it like iraq war
17:12
style level it was me my mom my sister
17:16
and
17:17
at least six of us
17:18
yeah i don't know to be honest so
17:20
jacqueline had a stowaway on board
17:21
didn't he did he um yeah he did he
17:24
regretted that decision
17:27
should be landing in a nice warm country
17:29
by now
17:31
what happened he was a guy called he was
17:34
a sailor called purse blackborough and
17:36
um he was actually helped to sneak on
17:38
but he was he just really wanted to be
17:39
part of the expedition and he was
17:41
discovered after three days as i assume
17:42
he expected to be what was he going to
17:43
do like hide on the ship for a year and
17:45
so he was discovered after three days
17:47
and shackleton you know was you know
17:49
threatened him a little bit and said i
17:50
can't believe you've done this you
17:52
busted and eventually said okay you can
17:54
stay but only if you sign this agreement
17:56
saying if you stay you'll be the first
17:57
person to be eaten if we need to start
17:59
eating each other and so we signed that
18:01
agreement and if they had had to eat
18:03
each other he would have been the first
18:04
person to go
18:06
then nibbly got him he's going but
18:07
there's biscuits still
18:12
um okay time for our next fact fact
18:15
number three and that's my fact my fact
18:18
this week is that according to a recent
18:20
theory
18:21
stonehenge was built as part of a team
18:24
building exercise
18:31
[Laughter]
18:33
so this is this is there are a lot of
18:35
theories by the way about what how
18:37
stonehenge came about but the idea is
18:39
that uh rather than it being a place
18:41
that people return to and so on they
18:42
seem to have found evidence uh that it
18:44
was occupied for about a decade and that
18:47
so it must have been built in that
18:48
period of years and then they left it
18:50
once it was done because apparently
18:52
there weren't a lot of people back then
18:53
the idea was to create something where
18:54
people could come together get to know
18:56
each other but do something that was a
18:58
team building exercise and the guy
18:59
described it as glastonbury festival and
19:01
a motorway building scheme at the same
19:02
time that's that's what it was yeah
19:05
if someone said we're having a team
19:07
building exercise you need to book the
19:08
next 10 years off work
19:12
yeah it's true so when i read that
19:13
sentence i thought oh i bet that's
19:14
that's a really mad idea which obviously
19:16
it probably is but i did think it was
19:18
druids that had built it and that it was
19:20
part of this whole
19:21
this religion thing this cult thing that
19:23
they were doing and it turns out that
19:25
just we have no idea how we got there
19:27
there are so many theories and they're
19:28
all amazing theories another recent
19:30
theory it's a prehistoric glockenspiel
19:33
because apparently if you hit it it
19:35
rings in a really nice way acoustically
19:37
it's very amazing so the hitting hitting
19:39
the stones thing does seem like a bridge
19:41
too far for me but um
19:43
it does have exactly the same acoustics
19:45
it's like a concert hall or a theater or
19:47
something or a potato where you'd have
19:49
musicals on and so they do think that it
19:51
was designed specifically so that the
19:52
muse like you know any sounds inside it
19:54
would that is good rebound the thing
19:56
that dan said about the druids having
19:57
built it um it's quite interesting that
20:00
um there is evidence that people
20:02
were doing something at stonehenge for
20:04
every period from when it was built to
20:07
now apart from the late iron age which
20:10
is the very time when the druids were
20:11
supposed to have been around
20:13
and that's the only time in history we
20:14
don't really have any evidence of
20:16
anything having happened there
20:18
they did have a load of droids there
20:19
they had a ceremony there in 1905 where
20:21
259 druids were inducted into druidism
20:25
but they were really mercilessly teased
20:27
by the press on account of the fact that
20:29
a lot of them had fake beards
20:31
[Laughter]
20:34
this here's a very interesting fact
20:36
about um stonehenge uh someone actually
20:38
bought it at one point oh yeah so it was
20:41
sold at auction in a lot and this
20:43
husband called cecile shub was sent by
20:45
his wife to go to this auction and he
20:48
saw it was up for sale and he thought
20:49
that'll be a nice present for my wife um
20:51
but when he got home she was furious at
20:54
him because she'd sent him to the
20:55
auction to buy codens that she liked and
20:58
he came back with a henge
21:01
he said that he bought it on a whim in
21:02
the auction room yes he said i just
21:04
thought a local guy should own it
21:05
because he lived really nearby so
21:08
it's sort of a nice story that he bought
21:09
it for his wife and the thing about
21:11
curtin's is kind of too good to check
21:12
but it's right okay another recent
21:15
theory it was a barbecue site
21:19
this is so they found a bunch of bones
21:20
of animals and uh when they were looking
21:22
at their bones they could see burn marks
21:24
on it that suggested that quite like an
21:26
aussie barbecue they were just sort of
21:28
turning them over and cooking them
21:29
nicely so it's amazing what they can do
21:31
with the archaeology they find bones and
21:33
they assume that it must be a barbecue
21:34
or whatever um i read one thing uh that
21:37
in the iron age in wales they had an
21:39
annual party where the guests only
21:42
everett the right four leg of pigs and
21:45
they found that because they just found
21:46
a big pile of the specific one leg of
21:48
pigs all the time and they lasted for
21:50
years and years and years and it seemed
21:52
like they came from one year after
21:53
another after another and they assumed
21:55
that they just must have had this big
21:57
party where you just got one leg off a
21:58
pig and everyone at it and we're sure
22:00
that in those days it wasn't just that
22:01
pigs only had one right
22:05
like they were like a pogo stick
22:08
that's an excellent point definitely
22:09
possible
22:11
i was having a look through the british
22:13
newspaper archive to see which so that
22:15
goes back about 300 years and gives you
22:17
newspaper records from that time to see
22:19
kind of what people thought of
22:20
stonehenge in the past and so a lot of
22:22
the articles in the early 1800s so
22:25
around 1840
22:26
everyone thought that it had been
22:27
brought over by the egyptians so people
22:29
thought the stones from stonehenge had
22:31
been brought over from africa to egypt
22:33
and then the egyptians because they were
22:35
considered such a civilized uh race or
22:37
such civilized people and they had much
22:39
better mechanics and engineering than we
22:40
did we were all still you know stuck in
22:43
they also thought for a time that it was
22:44
only built about a thousand years ago
22:46
which oh
22:47
i have a theory on this when was
22:48
stonehenge built two thousand eight
22:50
hundred bc okay
22:52
what would you say if i told you it was
22:54
1958
22:56
i'd say dan be quiet
23:00
almost every single stone at stonehenge
23:02
has been moved between 1901 and 1964. no
23:05
yeah the almost every single one so they
23:06
were either moved or they were
23:08
straightened some of them were set in
23:10
concrete
23:11
this was just very early 20th century
23:13
guys saying ah it's not quite right is
23:14
it why don't we just bodge it up and put
23:16
some concrete under it and then it was
23:18
very early candid preservation so
23:20
i say that stonehenge was built in the
23:22
late 50s
23:24
yeah that's yeah that's a great theory
23:26
um you said that people thought that
23:28
these stones came from egypt but they
23:29
actually came from wales didn't they uh
23:32
they came from the pressly hills in
23:33
wales uh we know that now because of um
23:35
x-rays and stuff like that um but for 90
23:38
years they were trying to dig on this
23:40
particular hill and then they found out
23:41
that they were digging on the wrong hill
23:43
and it was another one one mile away
23:45
that they should have been digging and
23:47
dr richard bevins of the national museum
23:49
of wales he was a guy who found this out
23:51
and he said i don't expect to be getting
23:53
any christmas cards from the
23:54
archaeologists who have been excavating
23:56
at the wrong place for the last 90 years
23:58
well most of them will be dead by now
24:03
we're gonna need to move on soon by the
24:04
way um okay i have one quick thing um
24:06
there's a company called jacomo who make
24:08
um clothes especially for men
24:11
and they did a catalogue called the
24:13
architecture of men to identify modern
24:16
kind of builds and they said that simon
24:18
cowell and ricky gervais are built like
24:21
stonehenge
24:23
apparently they have short stocky build
24:25
broad shoulders and chunky legs
24:28
according to giacomo
24:29
russell crowe and jay-z look like the
24:32
tyne bridge
24:33
according to these guys
24:35
and james corden looks like the gherkin
24:37
[Laughter]
24:40
it's very harsh
24:42
um the tasmanian town of buckland built
24:45
a replica of stonehenge there are loads
24:46
of replicas all over the world so
24:48
there's a place called phonehenge in
24:49
south carolina and there's a place
24:51
called um a carhenge in kansas made of
24:54
old cars and there's a there's a live
24:55
webcam that you can watch i watched it
24:57
um for hours the other day as not much
24:59
goes on it's just
25:00
a camera pointing at a car henge but
25:02
yeah you can watch that um but the
25:04
tasmanian there was a tasmanian town
25:06
called buckland which built one and it
25:07
was demolished by the authorities and on
25:10
the wikipedia page for it says in
25:11
keeping with the original stonehenge it
25:13
did not have the necessary planning
25:14
approval from the local council
25:20
okay
25:21
time for our final fact of the evening
25:23
and that is jaczynski
25:25
oh yeah my fact is that utah has a 106
25:29
acre forest that's made out of one tree
25:32
and this tree is so cool it's called
25:34
pando
25:35
and it or some people call it the
25:37
trembling giant and it's uh it's a a
25:42
quaking aspen tree
25:44
and it's a clonal colony which means
25:46
that basically it's got the same root
25:48
system all the branches that stick up
25:50
out of the ground are clones of the
25:51
original tree so it's all completely
25:52
interconnected every single bit of it is
25:55
genetically identical to every single
25:56
other bit of it and yeah it takes up 106
25:59
acres and it's this one tree
26:01
that's astonishing it's incredible it's
26:03
so good pando means in latin eye spread
26:05
which is why it's called that
26:07
and it's also the heaviest known
26:09
organism uh it's really old as well so
26:12
the average age of like each indiv if
26:14
you went into this forest and you saw
26:15
one of the trees it would be 130 years
26:18
old but the age of the roots is thought
26:21
to be about 80 000 years old but could
26:23
be two hundred thousand years old four
26:26
hundred thousand two hundred thousand
26:28
to be ridiculous
26:31
isn't that amazing this tree though has
26:33
been growing for two hundred thousand
26:35
years is it tree though or is it loads
26:37
of trees definitely one tree that's the
26:39
same organism it's one organism it's all
26:41
completely interconnected it's just like
26:43
a tree whose branches go underground and
26:45
then come back up again wow it is
26:48
it's so great
26:49
um so utah where this where it is this
26:53
forest um utah is really amazing i
26:55
didn't realize how cool utah is so utah
26:57
is where um kentucky fried chicken's
26:59
from
27:02
absolutely true
27:03
yeah absolutely true um colonel sanders
27:06
was visiting utah and there was an
27:08
existing restaurant and he went inside
27:10
the restaurant and he and he went there
27:11
specifically because he liked the owners
27:13
and he said i have this interesting
27:14
chicken and so um he he did the recipe
27:16
and they advertised outside he was away
27:19
when they started selling it in the shop
27:20
and they said what should we call it and
27:22
it could have been utah fried chicken
27:24
ufc people just be fighting
27:26
[Laughter]
27:28
so uh kentucky fried chicken uh they
27:31
said let's call it kentucky fried
27:32
chicken because he's from kentucky and
27:34
then when he came back he realized how
27:35
how big it was and they opened up the
27:37
first ever kfc there and then it spread
27:39
around america so their kentucky fried
27:40
chicken is from utah wow did not know
27:43
that that's very cool yeah and also nasa
27:45
planned for our trips to mars there so
27:47
in the utah desert they have these
27:49
stations where they put astronauts in
27:51
for a bunch of days weeks months and
27:54
while i was reading this i discovered
27:55
something i never heard of this nasa has
27:57
actually created or at least someone
27:59
from nasa a mars flag do you know we
28:01
have a mars flag what no what does that
28:03
mean what's that for when we go for when
28:05
we go to mars we have a flag now and if
28:07
you look at it it's like the french flag
28:08
it's sort of uh vertical stripes three
28:11
and it starts red and then it goes
28:17
so it yeah it goes red and then green
28:19
and then blue and the idea is that it's
28:21
that's gradually how we would be making
28:23
the planet and i've never known this so
28:25
mars has a flag
28:27
what about when we get there and the
28:28
martians say we have our own
28:31
did you have you guys seen the this is
28:33
slightly topic but new zealand is uh
28:35
trying to redesign its flag at the
28:36
moment well actually the final design
28:38
may have gone through now have you seen
28:39
the suggestions for the newly designed
28:41
flag and i've always thought i don't
28:42
understand why flags in the world are so
28:44
boring and they've really nailed it this
28:46
time so a lot of the entries that have
28:48
been submitted are i think the best one
28:50
was of a kiwi which was not the same
28:52
color as a keyword what color it is and
28:54
it's shooting red lasers out of its eyes
28:57
into the corner of the flag and that's
28:59
being reported as yes and we'll give it
29:00
a good a good thing yeah wow
29:04
yeah
29:05
um so there is a tree of the year in
29:08
europe every year
29:10
and this year's tree of the year is an
29:12
estonian oak tree that's in the middle
29:14
of a football field uh it's in the arisa
29:17
ray stadium uh and if you google it you
29:19
can see pictures of it it's right in the
29:21
middle of a pitch
29:23
in the middle of the stadium
29:24
and according to visit estonia when the
29:26
stadium was being built the soviet
29:28
technology could not beat the oak and
29:30
therefore it was never uprooted and so
29:33
it's kind of a sign of i see sort of
29:35
independence and
29:37
exactly wow and then it also says on the
29:39
website today everyone is so used to
29:41
that extra player on the field
29:44
that the tree is hardly noticed during
29:46
the games
29:47
and i promise you it is massive
29:50
there is no way the ball does not hit
29:52
this tree every single time
29:54
anywhere well so uh that was tree of the
29:57
year 2015 and they're gearing up to uh
30:00
announce tree of the year 2016
30:02
nominations have begun uh and i read the
30:04
british nominations this year so a tree
30:07
featured in the game of thrones series
30:09
has been nominated which is very
30:11
exciting
30:14
they're all celebrity picks from britain
30:15
it's going to be like eurovision all
30:17
over again
30:18
because there's classic trees in it
30:19
there's the tree that the mark the magna
30:21
carter was supposedly signed under
30:23
there's um the tree where charles the
30:25
second hit there's the tree where
30:26
apparently robin hood hid under as well
30:29
um
30:30
there must be the fortingle you then the
30:33
this is the tree that apparently is the
30:35
oldest tree in britain and possibly in
30:37
europe and it's the tree under which
30:39
legend says pontius pilate hid it's it's
30:42
just pilot yep yeah yeah he left the
30:44
middle east yeah to hang out in scotland
30:46
under a tree yeah it's thought that
30:48
that's where he went and this has become
30:49
hit the news recently because uh so it's
30:53
about 5 000 years old it's thought so
30:55
possibly the oldest tree in europe and
30:58
it is just having a sex change so it's
31:01
mid up right now so what does that mean
31:04
it's been a male for well almost 5 000
31:07
years and it's just so it doesn't
31:09
produce fruit so a lot of plants i think
31:11
most plants actually don't have genders
31:13
but a lot of plants either male or
31:14
female have male parts or female parts
31:16
and it's been a male for almost 5 000
31:18
years and someone noticed recently it
31:19
was growing fruit which the men don't do
31:21
and one of his arms is having a sex
31:23
change and becoming a female wow so
31:26
that's good good for the 14 year old you
31:28
wow that's astonishing yeah they're
31:30
england's tallest tree uh is the douglas
31:33
fair which is on exmoor near dunster i
31:36
visited it a few years ago but they
31:38
don't tell you exactly where it is they
31:40
just tell you it's kind of in this
31:41
forest somewhere because people like you
31:43
would go and chop it down
31:45
there was a whole thing where james
31:46
there's have you heard of the
31:47
chillingham cattle there's a herd of
31:48
wild cattle up in is it yorkshire very
31:51
very northumberland really really way up
31:53
north no one has touched these cows for
31:55
300 years right the field is completely
31:57
sealed they live they breed they die all
31:59
on their own occasionally they throw
32:00
over a bale of hay or some extra food in
32:02
harsh winters and as soon as james heard
32:04
about this he said i'm going to go there
32:06
and touch them
32:09
and now they're all in therapy
32:20
and i just thought that it's the tallest
32:21
tree you're gonna know which one it is
32:23
right
32:24
but they plant it well they haven't
32:25
planted it around loads of big trees but
32:27
basically it is around the load of big
32:28
trees and so you just go there and you
32:30
just kind of have to take the word for
32:31
it that it's there really
32:34
but the us has a national register of
32:36
big trees
32:38
but again they don't tell you where any
32:40
of the trees are they just tell you the
32:41
general area where they are and say it's
32:43
called this and it's this height
32:45
and there was a spokesman from american
32:47
forest who does this register and he
32:49
says we don't want to send flocks of
32:51
tree spotters and paparazzi to harass
32:53
the trees and ruin their lives
32:57
which sounds like he's talking about me
32:59
doesn't it does yeah
33:01
have you heard of the world's rarest
33:02
tree no that's so cool it's a tree
33:04
called penantia beliciana where is it
33:07
i'm not telling you
33:12
from 1945 for about 70 years there was
33:15
only one in the world and it was on a
33:17
tiny island off new zealand and it
33:20
became the last in the world when humans
33:22
introduced goats to the island and they
33:23
ate all the other trees oh my god
33:26
wow i think they found out just in time
33:28
that uh that this was the last one but
33:31
scientists have found a way of uh
33:32
growing a load of new seedlings so
33:34
they've planted a load oh we're gonna
33:35
have to wrap up really soon
33:37
just can i just give a recommendation to
33:39
everyone here if they haven't already
33:40
seen this since you mentioned goats have
33:41
you ever seen the argania trees which
33:43
are the trees that goats climb up um
33:46
they're so great so there are there's a
33:49
kind of tree called the argenia tree um
33:51
and goats climb it and yeah you just see
33:53
them in its branches and just look it up
33:55
a-r-g-a-n-i-a
33:57
and when it goes do you get them one
33:58
tree there are pictures of at least a
34:00
dozen i would say wow you know that's
34:02
where these trees
34:08
okay i think we should wrap up that's it
34:10
that's all of our facts thank you so
34:11

00:04
[Music]
00:11
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:14
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:16
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:18
covent garden my name is dan schreiber i
00:21
am sitting here with anna chazinski
00:22
james harkin and andy murray and once
00:25
again we've gathered around the
00:26
microphones with our four favorite facts
00:28
from the last seven days and in no
00:30
particular order here we go starting
00:32
with you james
00:34
okay my fact this week is that the great
00:36
wall of china is held together by sticky
00:39
rice
00:40
right this is not true it's true
00:43
how's that possible well it's the mortar
00:46
that holds the bricks together it must
00:47
be extremely overcooked because that's i
00:49
don't think that's good sticky rice if
00:51
it's like cement well what they found is
00:54
that um
00:55
they've got this kind of mortar which is
00:57
half organic and half inorganic and the
01:00
organic compounds in it is something
01:02
called amylopectin which is like a
01:04
starchy stuff that you would get if you
01:06
cook potatoes or rice or whatever and
01:08
they're pretty certain that they got
01:09
that through cooking sticky rice and
01:11
then extracting this starch and then
01:13
just mixing it with lime and making the
01:15
mortar wow that's really cool i've
01:17
always thought food would make great
01:19
cement because have you ever left a sort
01:21
of the remnants of a weetabix yeah
01:24
why are we not using weeda bits to hold
01:25
buildings together right you leave it
01:27
five minutes you cannot wash that up
01:28
it's done yeah i throw away the bowls
01:31
that is why we are out of crockery in
01:32
the office
01:35
it's very cool so how much of the great
01:36
wall was used so um the great wall
01:39
started being built 2200 years ago
01:42
and this mortar came in 1 500 years ago
01:45
and so it's not all of the wall but the
01:47
main bit which was um built by the ming
01:49
dynasty the bit that you kind of see in
01:51
the photos that has sticky rice in it
01:54
that's all the all the fancy towers and
01:56
really good bits yeah yeah not the like
01:58
earth and mounds yeah yeah which aren't
02:01
even really the great wall of china are
02:03
they they're they're i heard them
02:05
described as the uh the chi wall which
02:08
is about the qi wall which is quite nice
02:10
um but it was built in 500 bc
02:12
and it's mostly just earth
02:15
but it was really quite effective
02:16
because if you're an infantry army
02:18
trying to cross that you can cross it
02:20
but a it'll take loads of time and b
02:21
you'll probably have to leave some
02:22
supplies behind and it's just a pain
02:24
yeah the thing is that is great and it's
02:26
a wall and it's in china so i think we
02:28
should call that the great china as well
02:30
yeah and that was that was by the
02:32
emperor who kind of created china modern
02:36
day china i guess um who was incredible
02:39
character
02:40
emperor chief and he was a terracotta
02:42
warriors guy he was uh it's amazing when
02:44
you look at what he did in one lifetime
02:48
i mean he killed a lot of people in the
02:49
process but it's it's i shouldn't hold
02:52
that against him
02:53
he had an army of 1.5 million men wow
02:56
would imagine if the grand old duke of
02:57
york had an army of 1.5 million men the
03:00
hill would be full it would be very very
03:02
hard
03:06
do you know that they've now um they've
03:08
trying to combat the thing of everyone
03:09
going on the wall and graffitiing it and
03:11
so they've actually created a section
03:13
that you can legally graffiti now in the
03:15
great wall of china yeah there's a
03:16
graffiti corner that seems the crazy
03:19
idea i saw that i can't quite believe it
03:22
it kind of makes sense very
03:24
but it does take the fun out of graffiti
03:25
though yeah when it's allowed hey guys
03:28
welcome to the cool graffiti area where
03:30
you can draw what do you like
03:31
so you know last week i think i
03:33
mentioned that uh they've just realized
03:35
there are eight times as many trees as
03:37
we thought there were on earth which if
03:39
it was edited out that's a fact for this
03:40
week's podcast there are eight times as
03:41
many trees as we thought there were
03:42
we've just miscounted and so in the same
03:44
way they recently measured the great
03:46
wall of china and it's like three times
03:48
longer than we thought it was we're all
03:50
the trees behind it
03:51
who are hiding
03:54
but how did we get that wrong so we
03:56
thought it was uh 9 000 kilometers and
03:58
then it turns out they've just announced
03:59
it's 21 000. so cool that's halfway
04:02
around the earth that's half the
04:03
circumference of the earth wow it's
04:04
stretched out and it's all sorts of
04:06
different bits folded in on itself and
04:08
so on but yeah yeah there's lots of
04:09
different walls isn't it it's not
04:10
actually one proper wall well depending
04:12
on whether you go with james's it's all
04:13
definitely the great wall of china
04:14
theory every single wall in china which
04:17
i consider to be great
04:21
um apparently the i've been to the great
04:23
wall of china have you yeah um
04:25
have you
04:26
i was reading well actually i wasn't
04:28
reading i saw this in a carl pilkington
04:30
idiot documentary episode where he
04:32
visited there and he was reading a
04:33
little pamphlet in it where it said
04:34
basically that section most people go to
04:36
has been renovated so much that it's
04:39
basically a whole new wall it's it's
04:41
just it's all new bricks so since 1983
04:44
that's what people are visiting a sort
04:46
of 1983 version of the great wall of
04:48
china yeah which is probably safer
04:50
because so many people are visiting it
04:53
um i read somewhere saying it's really
04:55
ironic that considering it was designed
04:56
to keep people out it's now one of
04:57
china's biggest tourist attractions
04:59
attracts millions of people to it every
05:01
year yeah um was it definitely to keep
05:03
people out i remember once reading that
05:05
it was a place to collect tax or
05:06
something uh yeah i'm not sure do you
05:09
know what you're thinking of what the
05:10
great hedge of india am i yes
05:13
yeah so there's india uh there's a huge
05:16
hedge that runs along and it was uh it
05:19
was a borderline to collect tax on and
05:21
so you'd get to the hedge and there
05:22
might be someone patrolling the hedge
05:24
and they would collect tax or something
05:25
like that did they call the tax the
05:27
hedge fund
05:28
[Music]
05:30
um do you guys know who the first person
05:32
to be filmed on the great wall of china
05:34
was justin bieber no chairman mao no for
05:38
a movie sorry who is this who's closer
05:40
uh james saying justin bieber
05:42
yes steven seagal is so close in name
05:46
steven seagull no so
05:48
steve coogan
05:50
what steve coogan was the first ever
05:52
person to be filmed he made a movie
05:53
called around the world in 80 days it
05:54
was the jules verne movie and he's the
05:56
first person to be filmed in it for a
05:58
movie they got access to it for the
05:59
first time ever
06:00
it had never been featured in a film
06:02
before like it had never been for if it
06:04
had been featured it was just purely a
06:06
shot as opposed to someone walking and
06:07
doing dialogue or it would have been a
06:08
set or something exactly yeah um so on
06:12
the great wall of china
06:14
does you know the whole thing about
06:15
whether you can see it from space
06:16
yeah so
06:18
um in 2003 china sent its first
06:20
astronaut or as they called taiko north
06:22
because tycho is uh chinese for space uh
06:26
they sent the first astronaut up uh yang
06:27
luway and he said guys i can't see it
06:30
and everyone panicked it's a really big
06:32
problem and um eventually they decided
06:35
you could see it but actually you can
06:37
only see it from a really low orbit when
06:39
the weather's good and if you've got a
06:40
powerful telephoto lens yeah they should
06:43
paint it pink
06:44
yeah they should do something different
06:46
because it's quite they do really care
06:48
about it every single chinese astronaut
06:49
that's been up uh has been given the
06:52
role of looking for the great wall of
06:54
china and has failed to fight so the
06:56
photos that they did get the astronaut
06:58
who took the photos where you could see
07:00
it if you looked really closely and sort
07:02
of blew it up quite to a big photo he
07:04
said he just didn't know if it was in
07:06
the photo at the time when he took it so
07:07
it was by coincidence that he managed to
07:09
get it and in 2006 um
07:12
someone went on television in china
07:14
associated with their space program and
07:16
this is what he said he said we need to
07:17
carry out more tests and improve
07:19
astronaut training so
07:21
that's like still their main focus is
07:23
like no we don't want to write it off
07:25
just yet um but do you know when it
07:26
dates back to it dates back to before um
07:29
it's like three hundred astronomers
07:30
well the earliest i found is uh ripley
07:33
of believe it or not fame in 1932 he
07:35
said that it's the mightiest work of man
07:37
it was the only one that would be
07:38
visible to the human eye from the moon
07:40
which it definitely isn't
07:42
but there was a writer in 1754 called
07:44
william stukley who said and this was
07:46
about hadrian's wall
07:48
he said uh it's a mighty wall of four
07:50
school miles in length which makes a
07:51
considerable figure on the terrestrial
07:53
globe and may be discerned at the moon
07:55
wow that was about hadrian's wall i know
07:57
which you can barely see from like
07:59
standing on tiptoes
08:01
i wonder if helen shaman had a look down
08:03
to see if she could see hadrian as well
08:05
yeah and if not i think we need to send
08:07
some more brits up to see if we can see
08:09
it we need more training tim peake's
08:10
going up we could give him a special uh
08:12
mission to do it um that's what i really
08:14
like by the way uh the first mention
08:16
that you could see it from the moon was
08:18
the ripley's believe it or not book and
08:20
i didn't realize that ripley's believe
08:21
it or not was an actual question that's
08:24
what it feels like okay so not i don't
08:26
believe it
08:28
it feels like it's an actual
08:30
god is that what the whole like fifty
08:31
percent of that book we're saying is
08:33
false maybe we've been all reading it
08:34
wrong yeah damn it so i was looking at
08:36
sticky rice because
08:38
um i thought it's surely more
08:39
interesting than the great wall of china
08:40
so um every year in japan they eat these
08:42
sticky rice cakes and the health
08:45
departments have to advise people that
08:46
before they eat the cakes they need to
08:48
cut them into small pieces chew them
08:50
slowly and learn how to perform basic
08:51
first aid before indulging because so
08:53
many people keep choking on them wow i
08:55
think maybe it's the same substance that
08:56
they use to build the great wall because
08:58
it's
08:59
just there's an epidemic maybe it's
09:00
drying up and lodging in their throat
09:01
like a concrete ball
09:03
yeah you can't swallow it down um did
09:06
you know that an italian bride recently
09:07
was rushed to hospital because people
09:09
were showering her with rice as she was
09:11
exiting the church and she got a bit of
09:13
rice stuck in her ear and uh had to be
09:16
hurried to the er she was okay there's
09:18
like a common uh myth that if you throw
09:22
rice on the ground then pigeon pigeons
09:24
explode but it's not true ah
09:27
have we ever tested it
09:30
no i don't really want to do that
09:31
experiment just on the off chance that
09:34
snopes is wrong on this one yeah
09:36
we paused the podcast right now came
09:38
back 20 minutes later oh my god there is
09:41
flooding guts everywhere
09:43
vulgar square is a mess
09:46
should we move on soon to our next fact
09:48
yeah i have one more thing on the great
09:49
wall yeah um
09:51
just going along the uh steve coogan
09:54
line yeah the first man we think to walk
09:57
the complete great wall of china was an
10:00
american
10:02
american adventurer called william edgar
10:04
gail and he was a really incredible guy
10:06
and he trekked across africa and he
10:08
traveled along the yangtze river he did
10:10
all these amazing expeditions and no
10:11
one's heard of him these days he was
10:13
late 19th century and
10:15
when he died he left three thousand
10:18
dollars to commission a biography of
10:19
himself
10:21
he
10:21
he wrote my life has been unusual and
10:23
the story of it is likely to benefit
10:25
young people
10:26
he's very very confident and he wanted
10:28
he wrote the first ever book in the west
10:30
about the great wall of china and he
10:31
said it he wanted it to be so good that
10:33
any historians in future writing about
10:35
it would find little to write about
10:37
unless he pirated our notes um just one
10:40
more thing about rice yeah have you guys
10:41
heard of uh dakiga kochi and i don't
10:44
know if that's how you pronounce it
10:46
almost certainly not but in japan this
10:48
was a tradition in 2008 it suddenly
10:49
became a craze where you get a
10:51
rice-filled bag and you draw a baby's
10:53
face on it if you've got a friend who's
10:54
had a baby and you present that to them
10:56
as a gift and you say you try to draw
10:58
the baby that they've had like an image
11:00
of it on a bag of rice and that's your
11:02
baby warming present that's weird isn't
11:04
it
11:05
what purpose is that serving is it like
11:07
in those um sitcoms where they give a
11:10
child like a bag of flour to look after
11:12
as if it was a baby i had that at my
11:14
school yeah i went to a really backward
11:16
school it strikes me sometimes when i
11:18
think yeah we had to care for a flower
11:19
baby in year seven yeah so do you think
11:21
maybe it's the same kind of thing if you
11:22
look after the rice and don't
11:24
accidentally boil it
11:26
because you're okay
11:28
if you must accidentally boil one of
11:30
these two things that you've just got
11:31
make sure it's the rice that's very
11:33
confusing though because you think oh
11:34
that's lovely i'll have that rice for my
11:35
supper oh no
11:36
[Laughter]
11:38
or it's like well i need some mortar to
11:41
put up this brick wall oh no
11:43
[Laughter]
11:46
[Applause]
11:48
okay time for fact number two and that
11:50
is andrew hunter murray my fact is that
11:54
the world's largest single-celled
11:55
organism can get up to 12 inches long
11:58
that's great that's incredible yeah it's
12:00
amazing what is it
12:02
it's an algae or an alga
12:05
it's called calepa taxifuller and it's a
12:08
single cell and yet it gets up to a foot
12:10
long and it has all these different
12:11
things in it it has um so it looks like
12:14
a plant it has these fronds which look
12:15
like leaves and then it's got little
12:17
root-like bits as well which hold it in
12:19
place but it is one cell wow it's so
12:22
cool yeah that's really cool single
12:24
celled organisms i've realized are much
12:26
more complicated can be much more
12:28
complicated and interesting than you
12:29
would imagine like there's one that's
12:30
recently been discovered that has kind
12:32
of what they think are eyes isn't there
12:35
which take up about a third of its body
12:37
and it is just one cell are you talking
12:38
about juan or weeds i sure am yeah um or
12:42
what are they called
12:44
they're called oscilloids
12:46
i like um things little black dots
12:48
inside the single-celled organism and it
12:51
seems like they appropriate bacteria to
12:53
be used as their eye yeah wow yeah so
12:57
the cornea what you would count as a
12:58
cornea is actually a little bacterium
13:01
and the retina which what you would
13:02
think is similar to a human retina is
13:04
actually another bacterium
13:06
that's amazing
13:08
but then have they become a
13:09
multicellular organism that's a good
13:11
point but this was discovered wasn't it
13:12
more than a hundred years ago by this
13:14
guy who saw it under the microscope and
13:15
said look this thing has eyes and uh no
13:18
one believed him and so it was one of
13:19
those things that we just assumed it
13:20
didn't have eyes for another 120 years
13:22
do you think he went believe it or not
13:25
this thing has eyes okay frank we don't
13:27
believe it
13:27
[Laughter]
13:29
i uh i saw a fish today with four eyes
13:31
did you what yeah it's called the four
13:33
eye fish and it has four eyes is this uh
13:36
is this the beginning of a joke no yeah
13:38
where were you this morning
13:40
i went to yeah i went to the horny man
13:41
museum and
13:43
uh which is uh got an aquarium in it and
13:46
yeah they have one of their things
13:47
there's a foreign i think the point is
13:49
they have like kind of two eyes like a
13:50
normal fish but then the top of one eye
13:53
is got a certain lens and the bottom has
13:55
a certain lens so they can see outside
13:57
the water as well as inside the water is
13:58
that right this is insane that's so cool
14:01
um the joke you were thinking of was i
14:03
saw a fish with no eyes a fish
14:06
yes
14:07
that's what i thought you were screwing
14:09
up there yeah but you weren't it was
14:10
just an interesting fact
14:12
what do you call a fish with four eyes a
14:14
fish
14:17
um actually sorry there's another
14:18
amazing single-sided organism which does
14:20
a thing that's kind of similar to that
14:22
um and this is called the uh
14:24
xenophiophres which i think was the
14:26
biggest known single-celled organism
14:28
before yours came along uh xeno504 means
14:31
bearer of foreign objects and that's
14:33
because it makes it sort of constructs
14:35
its own body out of stuff that's lying
14:36
around so it kind of picks up bits of
14:38
like dirt and dust and material off the
14:40
ground and bacteria like a mr potato
14:42
head it's exactly like a mr potato head
14:45
yes um
14:46
sorry i just was talking about mr potato
14:49
head just a little fact about that yeah
14:50
um when mr potato head came out it was
14:53
during rationing in america and no one
14:56
wanted to advertise it none of the
14:57
advertisers would advertise it because
14:59
they thought it would encourage children
15:01
to play with their food
15:03
and so until the rationing stopped they
15:05
couldn't really
15:06
really advertise anywhere yeah or it
15:07
could encourage children to eat plastic
15:09
which is inadvisable it had a face on it
15:12
i thought it was a baby
15:13
[Laughter]
15:14
sorry dad no i was just going to say so
15:16
there's a diy
15:18
living thing that builds itself as it
15:20
goes well it gives itself extensions it
15:23
kind of builds a house for itself um but
15:25
in the deep sea
15:27
there are these zeno fire fours they're
15:30
up to two thousand every hundred square
15:32
meters on the seabed wow that's
15:35
they're the kings down there yeah yeah
15:37
they're the kings really one celled
15:38
organisms of the world there are they
15:41
way outnumber multi-cellular organisms
15:43
don't they um there are many more of
15:45
them than there are of us yeah so we're
15:47
animals and we and at the very top level
15:49
of taxon taxonomy is uh domain i think
15:53
everyone else learned this in year 9
15:54
biology and i snoozed that lesson but i
15:56
don't know there are three domains and
15:58
every living thing that you know of fits
16:00
into one so animals plants fungi
16:03
everything you think of as an animal
16:05
fits into one and then there are two
16:06
whole different domains for just these
16:08
bacteria basically yeah you know
16:10
although everyone else was learning that
16:12
at school anna was sweeping up flower
16:14
from the flower
16:15
[Laughter]
16:17
um
16:18
just on the idea of so single cell
16:20
organisms when i think that i just think
16:22
of the earliest of life like that's how
16:24
we we all came about right so i was
16:25
looking into early life and and how we
16:27
came about generally and i read about a
16:30
thing that has been observed in deep
16:31
space uh 750
16:34
light years away from earth uh it's a
16:36
proto star it's like a sun-like star
16:39
shooting out these huge bullets of water
16:43
and they actually think that that's how
16:45
water is getting seeded around the
16:46
universe from these kind of stars these
16:48
huge like huge amounts of water uh and
16:52
so they say that um if we picture these
16:54
jets as giant hoses and the water
16:56
droplets as bullets the amount of
16:57
shooting out equals a hundred million
16:59
times the water flowing through the
17:00
amazon river every second wow yeah and
17:03
the velocities are reaching 200 000
17:06
kilometers per hour so 80 fast 80 times
17:08
faster than bullets flying out of a
17:10
machine gun and they've been observing
17:11
this these huge batches of water coming
17:14
out of these stars and because i did
17:15
read a long time ago there was a theory
17:16
that maybe the way that earth got water
17:18
was from one of these a huge just
17:20
whatever bullet of water coming towards
17:22
us or ice i guess but um
17:25
do they think maybe comets because
17:27
comets often have loads on them i think
17:29
an enormous comet might have provided a
17:30
lot of i can't imagine that much water
17:32
coming just from comets though it's
17:34
controversial i think yeah well this
17:36
this is just a this is quite a new
17:37
report that's come out where they've
17:39
observed a proto-star shooting out
17:41
a super soaker 59 million
17:46
that's so amazing yeah i know i couldn't
17:48
believe it but you you think it's uh not
17:50
fully uh i don't know i haven't read
17:51
that right but um
17:54
some people think that water came from
17:55
space some people think it managed to be
17:57
made on earth
17:59
it might well be true for all i know
18:01
speaking of early life forms uh do you
18:03
guys know about the boring billion
18:06
no
18:07
the boring billion is a period of time
18:09
that scientists use to describe between
18:11
1.8 billion and 800 million years ago
18:14
when
18:14
life just stopped evolving completely
18:17
and the whole of earth the only life on
18:19
earth was one huge layer of slime
18:22
that is so good for a billion years
18:26
was it like slime mold kind of amoeba
18:28
kind of stuff um it was it was like a um
18:31
uh what's it called a bacterial sheet oh
18:34
am i actually just like a matte kind of
18:36
thing yeah oh it was like a microbial
18:37
microbial mats yeah you still get
18:39
microbial mats today uh there's a huge
18:41
patch of them the size of
18:44
greece i think yeah there's one wow
18:46
there's one layer of microbial mats on
18:47
the bottom of the ocean it's just off
18:49
venezuela and it's the size of greece
18:51
and it can be up to seven centimeters
18:53
thick as in bottom to top and it's just
18:55
this incredible web of strands and
18:58
filaments and microbes living in these
19:00
they look like little cow pets on the
19:02
ocean floor and there's an area the size
19:04
of greece undersea which is these things
19:06
as excited as andy is getting about this
19:09
i think he would have loved it in the
19:10
boring billions
19:13
you should have been living in that time
19:15
i would have called it the brilliant
19:16
billiard
19:20
um i i randomly was flicking through the
19:22
other day a um book by michael palin on
19:25
his trip to brazil and the book's called
19:27
brazil and uh he was talking to a guy in
19:29
the amazon
19:30
about uh deforestation and so on and
19:32
when they're actually just chopping down
19:34
stuff and this guy said that the term
19:36
that they all refer to when they talk
19:37
about a size of area that they're
19:39
deforesting in the amazon they call it
19:41
one belgium or six belgiums oh do they
19:44
yeah they use belgium as the uh we would
19:46
say wales i think like the size of wales
19:48
is chopped down every two minutes or so
19:50
right yeah so they seem to like they'll
19:52
say to each other so they kind of use it
19:54
as an unofficial
19:55
unit of measurement yeah um something
19:57
about bacteria oh yeah um so the largest
20:01
bacterium is called theo margarita
20:04
namibiensis that's actually quite a
20:06
pretty name it sounds like a parent's
20:07
actually named a child it is i tried to
20:09
look up if there was anyone called theo
20:11
margarita in the world
20:12
and there was one guy he's a football
20:14
agent or he's signed up to be a football
20:16
agent but there's not really much about
20:18
him he didn't seem that interesting but
20:19
it's a shame um but yeah this is the
20:21
biggest bacteria in the world it's big
20:23
enough to be seen with a naked eye and
20:25
its volume is three million times more
20:27
than the average bacterium
20:30
and i thought that if um you had the
20:32
average human and it was someone who was
20:34
three million times bigger than that it
20:36
would be about ten times as large as the
20:38
world's biggest tree
20:40
it would be human
20:41
wow yeah you don't want to be bullied by
20:43
that guy no
20:45
there are those these things are so cool
20:47
so
20:48
um i think it's
20:50
the thickness of seven pages
20:53
in in a book if you hold those together
20:56
that's the width that's that's how long
20:57
they get so you can see them another
20:59
thing about them is that these bacteria
21:02
the world's largest bacteria is the same
21:05
size as the world's smallest snail
21:08
oh do they hang out i don't know
21:11
but that's called acmella nana and it
21:13
was only described this month november
21:15
2015.
21:17
that snail and you're like oh i feel
21:19
like i'm just coming down with a bit of
21:21
a bug
21:22
that's actually the same size as me
21:25
cool and those two are both slightly
21:26
larger than the very smallest plant in
21:28
the world which is a duckweed and it
21:30
gets just 0.6 millimeters that's an
21:32
individual plant oh wow
21:34
tiny so i like to imagine all three of
21:36
them and they're having a little
21:38
maybe
21:42
this is just one thing i like about
21:43
because you mentioned it giving things
21:44
their scientific names the binomial
21:46
naming system uh it just struck me the
21:49
other day when i read it in a book that
21:51
um it's one of the only maybe the only
21:53
universal bit of language so wherever
21:56
you go in the world you're not gonna be
21:57
able to communicate with anyone you know
21:58
who speaks a language you don't unless
22:00
you need to describe a certain type of
22:01
plant or a mole or something and then
22:04
you just say you know puffiness
22:05
puffiness and they're gonna know exactly
22:06
what you mean if they're a zoologist i
22:09
wonder about computer code is a bit
22:10
similar to that maybe yeah the other
22:13
thing is apparently there's one word
22:14
which is understood by everyone on earth
22:16
and that's huh
22:18
there was a paper earlier this year
22:20
saying that this word is everyone knows
22:22
what that means huh
22:24
do you have to make that ridiculous face
22:25
with it that you just made
22:27
that i wish everyone could see
22:33
um i started researching single-celled
22:36
organisms um and then quickly stopped
22:38
because i didn't understand anything
22:39
about it um so i looked at the rest of
22:42
the fact which is uh that they single
22:43
cell organism can be up to 12 inches
22:45
long
22:46
you're going to name stuff that's 12
22:47
inches long down i don't know if we want
22:48
to put out this podcast
22:50
are you about to name other stuff that's
22:51
12 inches long yeah oh god so i started
22:54
looking into things that are 12 inches
22:55
long uh one of the things is that two
22:57
years ago uh subway got sued um because
23:01
customers were complaining that their 12
23:03
inch foot long sandwiches weren't in
23:05
fact 12 inch foot longs and so yeah you
23:08
could bring in your single-celled
23:09
organism to measure it again
23:13
exactly and someone actually there was a
23:15
big class action lawsuit and they were
23:17
representing customers who'd purchased
23:19
the six-inch foot-long sandwiches
23:20
anytime between january the 1st 2003 and
23:23
october the 2nd 2015 so if anyone felt
23:26
like they were duped and had a bit of
23:27
proof they could come forward and say
23:29
actually six years ago i was pretty sure
23:31
that was a bit shorter than
23:32
11.9 inches yeah exactly and they had to
23:35
pay up so uh subway actually paid up for
23:38
the settlements of 525 thousand dollars
23:40
american and now they have to measure
23:42
all of their uh bread
23:45
um but they could have just claimed that
23:47
oh sorry when we said footlong we just
23:48
meant as long as michael's foot
23:51
michael's the guys
23:55
michael foote was much bigger than he
23:57
was five or six feet actually so
24:00
um can i give a really interesting
24:02
theory i think about single-celled
24:04
organisms that i read today it might be
24:06
quite random i only read it in this one
24:08
um
24:08
study was like ripley's believe it or
24:10
not it sure was is it in the second half
24:12
of the book
24:15
um but so it's quite a mystery why
24:17
animals happened why multicelled
24:19
organisms happened you know what what
24:21
was it that made single cells go to
24:22
multi-cells there are various theories i
24:24
like this theory which is that it's
24:26
because we're able to eat ourselves
24:29
um so
24:30
in so cells need organisms need food to
24:32
survive right so they eat other cells
24:34
and other things that are made of cells
24:36
so
24:37
when cells were all clustered together
24:39
if they got hungry they could just eat
24:41
the cell next to them that they were
24:42
attached to so that meant they never got
24:44
hungry but the cells that were
24:45
single-celled organisms couldn't fight
24:47
if they got hungry and there wasn't
24:48
another single cell nearby then they
24:49
just starved to death and so suddenly it
24:51
evolved that it's better to be you know
24:53
multicelled organisms happened because
24:55
you could just eat the other bits of
24:56
yourself so you can digest yourself
24:58
easily without having to go out looking
25:00
for food and that's why they came into
25:03
being um in sac the island of sark there
25:07
is a jail with a single cell
25:09
[Laughter]
25:12
you can fit two prisoners in it as a
25:14
posh and they have to be amoeba
25:18
um do you want to know a cool thing
25:20
about what i think is the oldest animal
25:22
on earth
25:23
so any guesses
25:25
um a tartus okay a
25:29
it was something ocean based right so
25:31
well
25:32
yeah like coral bruce forsyth i think
25:35
no
25:36
dan's right on this one
25:38
so sponges are technically animals which
25:42
never fails to surprise me they are
25:44
in the animal kingdom and they they look
25:46
just like sponges but there are these
25:48
giant barrel sponges which can be up to
25:50
two and a half meters tall and that much
25:52
across as well single animals and some
25:54
of those they think could be up to 2 400
25:57
years old
25:59
which outstrips anything else so you
26:00
know that you couldn't kill a sponge
26:02
with your bare hands i disagree
26:05
because if you kind of try and rip it
26:07
apart or pull it or anything like that
26:08
it will just regrow
26:10
so how can they be killed ah probably
26:12
let's say with fire
26:14
i thought we were actually bringing them
26:16
close to extinction because back in the
26:18
day before we use toilet paper people
26:20
use sponges so we were sort of bottom
26:22
wiping them to death basically yeah as a
26:24
species as in bacteria would then get
26:26
into the ecosystem is that right i don't
26:28
know
26:30
that implies that we didn't take it off
26:32
to wipe our asses we just sat on a huge
26:34
lot of sponge on the ocean oh i just
26:35
took it out and put it back put it back
26:37
in okay reattached it in the old days
26:39
you had to
26:41
swim to the bottom of the sea to wipe
26:42
your bum
26:45
it was terrible for the people living
26:46
next to the marianas trench
26:49
they call it the marianas trench
26:53
i've got quite a cool thing on amoeba
26:54
actually just that uh so the uh there's
26:57
a amoeba called the chaos amoeba which i
26:59
think is quite cool um or it's a chaos
27:02
it's a genus of amoeba and it was named
27:04
by linnaeus and i think it was the first
27:06
amoeba to be seen and named and then
27:08
this reminded me so linnaeus obviously
27:10
was responsible for seeing a lot of
27:12
these little species and naming them for
27:13
the first time and i was reading a book
27:16
the other day by colin tudge who's
27:18
amazing and you should all read his
27:19
books that linnaeus when he went on
27:21
botanical expeditions would have a
27:24
musical band leading the way and would
27:26
make everyone dress in really wacky
27:27
costumes yeah
27:29
did everyone know that and whenever they
27:30
found the new species he would like ring
27:32
a bell or something like that or play a
27:34
tutahorn or something see i know you
27:36
think the boring billion sounds fun but
27:38
i think that sounds like a more fun
27:40
we're all working out where in history
27:42
we're going to go with our time machine
27:45
andy's been gone a while
27:49
i said how long have you been some slime
27:51
[Laughter]
27:58
okay time for fact number three and that
28:00
is
28:01
my fact this week is that if you're
28:03
bitten by the boom slang snake you bleed
28:06
from every orifice
28:08
frightening james finds it funny yeah i
28:10
find the word lara fist funny yeah yeah
28:13
um yeah that's pretty terrifying even
28:14
your gums yeah i mean every every part
28:17
of your body you could believe from yeah
28:18
your gums your eyes your nose um your
28:21
eight you know the bits down there
28:22
mariana's trench you're marianas strange
28:24
exactly
28:28
uh well okay i'm never calling it
28:31
anything else
28:33
again
28:34
anyway so this is really horrible uh we
28:36
shouldn't be laughing um no but it's
28:38
fine this the boom slang snake which is
28:40
quite a cool name is not particularly
28:41
dangerous because it very very rarely
28:42
attacks people i think it's only killed
28:44
seven people on record but when it does
28:46
kill you it has a venom which is called
28:48
a hemotoxin which destroys your blood
28:49
cells and the first recorded incident
28:52
was an expert on snakes who got bitten
28:53
by it when he was in his lab and he
28:55
thought nothing of it because it's just
28:56
a tiny little bruise and he actually
28:58
because he was a snake expert he noted
28:59
down the symptoms as they went along and
29:01
spent the day going oh my bruise is
29:02
looking a little bit purple i'll get a
29:04
little tiny bit sore now and then he was
29:06
dead within 24 hours because suddenly
29:08
about you know six to eight hours later
29:10
you start blowing his culture everywhere
29:13
was he yes i think he was yeah and the i
29:15
think was it thought to be harmless at
29:18
the time slang so he said yeah if he'd
29:20
been bitten by a snake then thought to
29:22
be dangerous he obviously would have
29:24
been really worried but he just thought
29:25
oh it's just a booms lane i love so the
29:27
boom slang um so it's killed seven
29:29
people uh with its bite i reckon it's
29:31
only seven because it must be such an
29:33
ordeal for it to actually bite someone
29:35
properly because its fangs are located
29:37
at the back of its mouth yeah so for
29:39
some ridiculous reason evolution put it
29:41
back there so in order to bite it has to
29:43
open its mouth 170 degrees like this
29:48
and then make the bite but that's that's
29:50
just such an odd placement it's amazing
29:52
and they're called they're called
29:52
backfang snakes aren't they and there
29:54
are loads of species of snake which yeah
29:56
i don't really understand it either
29:57
supposedly when they bite you boomslangs
29:59
they have to it looks as though they're
30:01
chewing on their prey
30:03
supposedly when they bite their prey it
30:05
looks as though they're chewing on them
30:06
but actually all they're doing is
30:08
working the venom into their prey
30:10
but because they have to open their
30:12
mouth so wide to get their fangs
30:13
actually in there then they need to it
30:14
looks like they're chomping on you have
30:16
you guys heard of the japanese tiger
30:18
keel back no no it is the most badass
30:22
snake this this snake is incredible so
30:24
it can bite you and kill you with a
30:26
poison with a toxin however it's a
30:28
non-venomous snake and what it does is
30:31
it bites poison frogs
30:33
it takes from it the venom and the toxin
30:36
from the toad and then it lets it drip
30:38
back to its back fangs as well and it
30:40
keeps it in these little i think pouches
30:42
and then it bites something and it uses
30:45
the poison that it's carried over to
30:47
kill its enemy that's insane right
30:48
that's amazing yeah it's because it
30:50
takes a lot of energy to make your own
30:51
venom doesn't it and so it's actually
30:53
really clever there's much less energy
30:54
to just go and knicker off someone else
30:56
and like work out with your test tubes
30:57
inside your body how to actually concoct
30:59
one do they tell each other though like
31:01
do the snakes go
31:02
it's cool there's no venom but that toad
31:05
will give you it you just have to put it
31:06
to your back too like how do they pass
31:08
that knowledge on is it like with
31:09
beavers they just know how to build dams
31:11
when they're born are they keelbacks did
31:12
you say yeah so um female keelbacks um
31:16
when they have babies and the babies
31:17
don't have any venom yet they'll find um
31:20
a a toad and then collect the venom from
31:23
the toad and then give it to the
31:24
children so that they have some
31:26
have some venom when they're first born
31:29
so that might be observational it could
31:31
be yeah
31:32
yeah do you guys know how many people
31:34
would you guess i think i told andy this
31:36
the other day so don't answer it right
31:37
how many people would you two guess per
31:39
year are killed by snakes
31:42
uh around the world around the world
31:44
here um i would say about a hundred how
31:47
many people do you reckon dan uh
31:49
oh god i don't know uh maybe something
31:51
ridiculously low like seven because we
31:52
have so much
31:53
it's two hundred thousand what really
31:56
two hundred thousand people a year
31:57
they're the most dangerous animal aside
31:59
from mosquitoes and there's a massive
32:00
health emergency because um it's a
32:02
really unfashionable thing for
32:04
pharmaceutical companies to be investing
32:05
in because everywhere where snakes are
32:07
dangerous is in like rural developing
32:09
the poorest areas and so lots of
32:11
pharmaceutical companies are stopping
32:13
producing certain anti-venom which is
32:14
killing a lot of people but 200 000
32:16
people a year that's more than you would
32:18
have expected right yeah that's crazy
32:20
it's insane yeah there was a there was a
32:22
guy recently who survived a brown snake
32:24
attack which is i think australia's most
32:26
dangerous snake he was doing a charity
32:28
walk and he came across a snake that he
32:30
thought was dead and it leapt up and it
32:32
bit him but he survived the attack
32:34
because this entire walk which was right
32:36
across a huge walk in australia uh he
32:38
was wearing a stormtrooper outfit from
32:41
star wars and so it hit the the plate on
32:44
his uh on his shin
32:46
uh and he made all the news in australia
32:48
i'm not surprised yeah yeah and every
32:50
single uh every single news channel that
32:52
interviewed him asked him if he was a
32:54
massive star wars nerd and he went no he
32:56
doesn't even he doesn't even like star
32:58
wars
32:58
it's like what is star wars i was just
33:00
wearing my anti-snake suit
33:02
[Laughter]
33:05
wow amazing i read a list yesterday of
33:07
the
33:08
1295 venomous snakes as a list of them
33:12
online i'm not sure it's all of them but
33:13
i think it might be pretty close uh do
33:15
you want to hear some of the names yeah
33:17
yes please okay uh the moorish snake
33:20
maurice with two o's or like okay
33:27
the tiger cat snake which i really like
33:29
because it's like three animals in one
33:31
oh yeah
33:32
yeah that's a bit like there's a
33:34
hawkmoth caterpillar i think i think
33:36
maybe it might get really upset because
33:37
it's called the hawk moth caterpillar
33:39
and then when it turns into a moth i
33:40
reckon it thinks that must be the things
33:42
i turn into as i keep going on spends
33:44
the rest of his life waiting to become
33:50
anyway it's incredible if you google it
33:52
because it can disguise itself as a
33:53
snake um in order to repel birds and so
33:56
it's like its underside has this pair of
33:58
false eyes on it and it sort of causes
34:00
itself to become a bit engorged where
34:02
the snake's head would be and if you
34:03
look at pictures it looks exactly like
34:05
the head of a snake except that it's
34:06
obviously caterpillar-sized so i don't
34:08
know what kind of a frightening snake is
34:09
three inches long but it works that's
34:12
great um
34:14
they've apparently found out that snakes
34:15
are actually 70 million years older than
34:18
we first thought they were these snakes
34:19
sometimes were massive um one of them
34:22
this is what they ate dinosaurs
34:24
there's a dinosaur eating snake
34:27
that's amazing although you did get
34:29
small dinosaurs back in the day i know
34:30
but just the word yeah yeah
34:33
just imagine it kind of locking its jaws
34:35
around like a diplodocus exactly yeah it
34:38
says it ate small mammals lizards and
34:40
even dinosaurs
34:43
i read quite a cool news story from 1996
34:46
about a snake and i i'm gonna say now i
34:48
wouldn't recommend this because actually
34:50
for snake bite you're not supposed to
34:51
create a tourniquet because that people
34:53
often think that's the right thing to do
34:54
but actually sometimes that can trap the
34:56
venom in the wrong place and then make
34:58
it more harmful than it otherwise would
34:59
have been
35:00
however does sometimes work in 1996 in
35:03
texas a man was bitten by a poisonous
35:05
coral snake uh he killed the reptile by
35:08
biting off its head and then peeled off
35:09
its skin and used it as a tourniquet to
35:12
wrap around the injury that's amazing
35:14
that's pretty hardcore isn't it yeah
35:16
it's a hard car
35:18
you know they can hear through so i
35:19
don't know if this is all species of
35:20
snake but they can hear through their
35:22
jaw bone
35:23
so their jaw bones on the ground but
35:24
what's really interesting is that their
35:25
jaw bone is split into two
35:27
so they can work out the direction
35:29
because if the left jaw bone is going
35:32
there's a little guy over there yeah
35:33
they can suddenly be going oh okay left
35:35
joe bone all right let's make a move it
35:36
also has two ways of smelling and one is
35:38
uh the classic way you know classic
35:40
snakes no way the other is through its
35:42
tongue tasting the air
35:44
that's how it smells so when you see a
35:46
snake and it's kind of sticking out his
35:48
tongue just like hannah's doing now it's
35:50
trying to kind of see if it can taste
35:52
any predators or pray
35:54
okay
35:55
speaking of um being able to hear um do
35:58
you know the death adder no okay the
36:00
death adder um it kills um it kills a
36:03
lot of people a lot of people are killed
36:04
by it but it's not called the death
36:06
adder because of that it used to be
36:08
called the death adder
36:10
and then it just kind of got switched
36:11
round and it's because when early people
36:14
went to um australia they saw it and it
36:16
never ran away from humans and so they
36:18
assumed that it just couldn't hear the
36:20
humans and so that's they thought it was
36:22
death
36:23
that the death adder became the death
36:26
adder due to a mishearing basically
36:30
have you seen footage of flying snakes
36:33
oh yeah they're amazing they go a long
36:35
way don't they go a long way and their
36:36
bodies where do they get flying too so
36:38
if they're off on a tree yeah and they
36:40
want to get to the ground but they kind
36:41
of want to cover some distance while
36:42
they're in the air they always they
36:43
always fly from somewhere higher to
36:45
somewhere lower
36:47
never never the other way very good
36:49
point so it's not it's i guess it's more
36:51
a parachuting mechanism that they do
36:53
because they flatten their body into a
36:54
sort of spiral almost like when you see
36:56
in the olympics the ribbons that they do
36:58
when that ribbon display it's like that
37:00
i mean birds are still laughing in their
37:02
faces yeah but give it a few million
37:03
years and you won't be laughing when
37:04
there are flying snakes with wings
37:15
okay time for our final fact of the show
37:17
and that is my fact my fact this week is
37:20
that albert einstein has a social media
37:22
team
37:24
okay yeah so he has this is a genuinely
37:26
devoted team who are paid specifically
37:29
to keep up his twitter presence his
37:32
facebook outputs his tummy i did his
37:34
twitter presence had fallen a bit by the
37:35
wayside over the past 70 years
37:38
he died
37:40
how does it feel to be less
37:42
technologically adept to someone who's
37:44
been dead for 50 years
37:48
yeah that's a fair point so you you will
37:50
see on twitter that people had set up
37:52
accounts for dead historical characters
37:54
uh someone even has done one for god and
37:56
they run it as if they are god um yeah
37:58
but that's not a verified account
37:59
exactly so that's the difference albert
38:02
einstein has a little blue tick next to
38:03
his twitter account because it's a verif
38:05
a verified account he on facebook has a
38:07
little tick as well he's got 17 million
38:10
followers on facebook
38:12
17 million so this is corbis who looks
38:15
after his output and they have the
38:17
license to his image and as a result of
38:20
the money that they get from it he is
38:22
the fifth most um profitable
38:25
dead person basically he makes he's the
38:27
so i think only people like maybe kurt
38:29
cobain and a few others elvis elvis and
38:32
maybe john lennon um yes and the fourth
38:34
is uh charles schultz who drew peanuts
38:36
really because his books are still so
38:38
popular and still so lovely but i i was
38:41
very skeptical about this because i
38:42
thought this sounds terrible using
38:44
einstein's uh image after his death for
38:46
prophet it turns out that actually on
38:49
his death he left the rights to his
38:51
image to the hebrew university of
38:53
jerusalem which he co-founded
38:56
so
38:57
he said you can have the rights to my
38:58
image after i die and use it to make
38:59
money for the university so they
39:01
licensed out to corbis the right to use
39:04
this image and corpus take a cut of the
39:06
money basically but
39:08
most of it goes back to the hebrew
39:09
university so it is actually
39:12
an odd way of uh fulfilling your will or
39:15
you know having a charitable legacy they
39:16
actually really care about it the guy
39:18
who runs the team at corbis says that
39:20
every day he thinks about what einstein
39:22
stands for and what he doesn't stand for
39:25
and then he sends out a tweet or he
39:27
sends out a facebook message reflecting
39:30
what he thinks einstein might have said
39:32
about a situation also he corrects
39:34
people who misattribute quotes
39:37
to einstein so einstein will write back
39:39
to them in one case he wrote to one of
39:41
the kardashians saying einstein never
39:43
said that um so he's also doing damage
39:45
limitation on on the spread of
39:47
misinformation and i just love the quote
39:50
there was a guy at corbis not the guy
39:51
who actually runs einstein's account but
39:53
uh one of the managers there uh kevin
39:55
connolly who said it's not rocket
39:57
science
39:58
running einstein's social media presence
40:01
yeah they also point out that no one on
40:02
the chorus team has any scientific
40:04
expertise yeah right so that yeah
40:06
einstein still gets five to ten requests
40:08
for an autograph every day
40:11
that's true
40:12
like people ask on twitter for his
40:14
autograph i'm afraid i don't have much
40:16
more detail than that but i suspect they
40:17
go disappointed most of the time
40:20
einstein those pictures of him from the
40:21
30s look old these guys are they're in
40:24
black and white so you can tell they're
40:26
a long time ago how ancient do they
40:27
think this guy is
40:29
yeah um so einstein is a bit slightly
40:32
disturbing person right because he's he
40:35
seems to have no flaws well he has one
40:37
floor he has one floor but in every
40:39
other way he's so great all these quotes
40:41
that he he said that are all so wise and
40:43
brilliant he's this great pacifist he's
40:45
a genius if you read you know the i
40:47
think new scientist or scientific
40:49
american a couple of months ago did the
40:50
top 10 greatest scientists of all time
40:52
and you can feel they all want to be a
40:54
bit left field but in the end they all
40:55
say einstein's the one and yet he had
40:58
this weird relationship with his wife so
41:00
his list of ways that his wife had to
41:03
behave around him if the marriage was to
41:04
function is so weird so they yeah they
41:06
were on the brink of a divorce and then
41:08
they decided to hold the marriage
41:10
together for the kids yeah and in part
41:12
of the deal was einstein wrote this
41:13
letter to her yeah it's featured in the
41:15
letters of notebook if if anyone has
41:17
that you can see it
41:19
so the conditions um of him of them
41:21
remaining together uh it was a contract
41:23
that he wrote up that she had to sign
41:25
and uh she had to say that she would
41:26
make sure that uh his clothes and
41:28
laundry were kept in good order that
41:29
he'd get his three meals regularly in
41:31
his room bedroom and study kept neat
41:34
stuff like that but then you will
41:35
renounce all personal relations with me
41:38
insofar as they are not completely
41:39
necessary for social reasons you will
41:42
stop talking to me if i request it
41:43
that's an insane one
41:45
you will stop talking to me if i request
41:47
it i mean this doesn't say andy please
41:52
i mean this doesn't sound like a guy
41:53
who'd be great on social media if he
41:55
actually wasn't loud
42:00
yeah he just blocked basically
42:03
this is what he promises her in return
42:05
in return i assure you of proper
42:07
component on my part such as i would
42:09
exercise to any woman as a stranger oh
42:12
ouch and she signed it what an ass
42:16
and then they divorced a couple of years
42:17
later i think oh did they yeah all right
42:19
couldn't keep it up kept on yabbering on
42:21
didn't she yeah yeah wow
42:24
you know the weirdest thing about that
42:25
list is it feels really awkward having
42:29
to say bad stuff about einstein
42:31
but it's true it's this is who he was
42:33
but you really kind of i feel almost
42:35
dirty saying this out loud but it's kind
42:37
of it's just true yeah it's odd well
42:39
that's because of the expert work being
42:41
done by the folks at
42:43
you very rarely tweet you will not talk
42:46
to me if i request it
42:48
so einstein uh was also an inventor
42:51
because he worked in the patents office
42:52
didn't he yes he did a few inventions my
42:54
favorite one is a blouse with two sets
42:57
of buttons sewn parallel to each other
42:59
so that it would fit both a slim person
43:01
and a fat person
43:03
it's such a good idea it means that you
43:05
can use the slim buttons and if you put
43:07
on a load of weight then you can use the
43:09
fat buttons did he release that into the
43:11
market or did he just invent it uh he
43:13
invented it and patented it but no one
43:14
ever made it i don't think because i've
43:16
got um shirt uh cuffs
43:19
in case you put a lot of weight on your
43:20
wrist
43:22
you know like cake goes straight to my
43:24
wrists
43:27
anyway yeah he had some other he painted
43:28
a hearing aid i think and a refrigerator
43:31
yes which uh didn't take off at the time
43:34
um literally or metaphorically and
43:37
wasn't really bought but now they're
43:38
thinking about we're introducing it
43:39
because it's very environmentally
43:40
friendly um so it's actually very ahead
43:42
of his time it's not the reason he did
43:44
it though he did it because fridges at
43:45
the time were lethal so they all used
43:48
gases like ammonia
43:50
to actually do the cooling of the food
43:52
or other gases like methyl chloride and
43:55
several people died as a result of these
43:56
gases leaking out into their homes
43:58
basically so einstein was one of several
44:01
scientists who worked on fixing that and
44:03
in 1925 he co-developed with a former
44:06
student a fridge and he patented it but
44:08
then they invented a non-poisonous
44:11
refrigerant which just worked better do
44:13
you know yoda was based on einstein no
44:16
no the guy who designed yoda said he
44:18
based it on a combination of himself and
44:21
einstein it was stewart freeborn so hang
44:23
on if one element of yoda is taken from
44:26
stuart yeah yes from einstein it means
44:29
that stuart must be two foot tall
44:31
[Laughter]
44:34
when eistein became really famous and he
44:36
had lectures people really wanted to go
44:38
to the lectures even though they didn't
44:39
understand any of it and so he would
44:41
start a lecture and then stop after five
44:43
minutes and say i will now pause so that
44:45
those with no further interest in the
44:47
subject can leave
44:49
and pretty much everyone would go and
44:51
just be like two or three people left
44:53
wow
44:54
in oxford i visited it quite a few times
44:56
i didn't understand what i was looking
44:58
at but you can see the chalkboard that
45:00
einstein when he came to england to
45:02
explain equals mc squared you can see
45:04
the chalkboard where all the workings
45:06
out are on there it's quite not it's a
45:07
weird bit of history to look at although
45:09
weirdly and no nowhere on the chalkboard
45:11
does it say e equals mc square
45:13
so i just have to assume that they're
45:15
telling the truth you were definitely
45:17
one of the people in the lectures
45:18
weren't you who as soon as you sat down
45:20
i was like god five minutes i've got to
45:22
wait until he excuses me
45:25
i'm definitely not here for the science
45:26
just that thing anna was saying before
45:28
about taxonomy being everywhere in the
45:30
world i guess mathematics as well as
45:31
another one
45:33
yeah so any mathematician can talk to
45:35
each other about maths by just using the
45:36
symbols yeah yeah
45:38
you know how einstein's brain was
45:40
chopped up yeah um there's now an app
45:43
that you can get and i think it's for
45:44
doctors um where they've got high-res
45:47
images of the brain and you can download
45:49
it and you can get close into it and you
45:51
can just and i don't know what purpose
45:53
it has because they're not quite sure
45:55
how it fully fits together i would say
45:56
the main purpose is to get 2.49 on
45:58
people yeah exactly yeah but i mean
46:00
that's quite cool just the idea that
46:02
even his
46:03
his brain is now yeah sort of an app an
46:06
app yeah
46:07
also uh interestingly so just going back
46:09
to the sort of naughtier side of
46:11
einstein um there's a there's an idea
46:14
that his granddaughter who was raised by
46:16
hans which was his son
46:18
uh was in fact an illegitimate love
46:21
child of einstein her name was evelyn
46:23
and she was actually given a bit of
46:25
einstein's brain
46:27
and the idea was that she was actually
46:29
going to do a dna checkup to see if she
46:30
was related because she got no money at
46:32
all like the will when it went to the
46:34
hebrew university his likeness and all
46:36
that stuff they didn't give her a cut of
46:38
anything and most exciting thing about
46:40
her though is that for a period of about
46:42
13 years she was married to grover
46:44
krantz who all the uh bigfoot
46:47
enthusiasts out there will know is the
46:49
first scientist to believe in and try to
46:52
prove the existence of bigfoot right
46:54
yeah so she was associated with two
46:56
great men
46:59
the constant debate who has given more
47:01
to science
47:02
einstein or grover
47:04
can we do a quick thing on social media
47:06
social media particularly after death
47:09
because there are companies now which
47:11
offer to keep tweeting the kind of
47:13
things that you would have tweeted
47:16
after you die so they'll take a sample
47:17
of all your previous tweets and um their
47:20
slogan is when your heart stops beating
47:22
you'll keep tweeting
47:24
um i've read i was reading a story about
47:26
these firms and there was one
47:28
businesswoman who had registered her
47:29
interest in having that and she said
47:31
um it would be interesting to have a
47:33
quote kind of ironic legacy but then she
47:35
said but i'm not sure who'd be
47:37
interested in reading a
47:38
computer-generated me in the cold light
47:40
of day it is a very conceited thing to
47:42
do
47:45
which is very i think self-aware yeah
47:47
and there's another one called attorney
47:49
me i think which um you sort of can
47:52
train your avatar so it recommends that
47:54
if you sign up to it the best way to
47:56
have as realistic tweeting as possible
47:57
after you die is to properly train up
47:59
your avatar and feed it with your whole
48:01
personality so give it all your pictures
48:03
or your tweets and then it creates this
48:04
thing that looks like you and that can
48:07
you know speak speak to people as you
48:08
would have wow it's so mad oh brave new
48:12
world yeah
48:13
um the
48:14
there there's a guy called joe veeks of
48:17
vikes uh and he's a writer for the music
48:19
and pop culture website death and taxes
48:22
and he has wait sorry did he say death
48:24
and taxes
48:25
[Laughter]
48:27
sorry go on um and he's kind of um gone
48:30
on to hootsuite which is an app which
48:32
will send tweets in the future so you
48:35
can do it for a tweet next week if
48:36
you're not going to be in the country
48:37
it'll just send it
48:38
but anyway he has got some messages to
48:41
be sent out in 2086
48:43
and he wants to be the last person to
48:45
ever tweet and he reckons that just
48:47
twitter with it being an internet
48:49
company whatever or just any company
48:52
really probably still won't be going in
48:53
those times but he will still have one
48:55
last tweet oh wow
48:57
but if twitter doesn't exist how will it
48:59
go out yeah you could still post up
49:01
myspace even though no one's going on
49:02
there anymore
49:04
that's true wait what do you mean
49:08
hashtag get andy off myspace
49:11
um there are some things twitter
49:13
accounts that make me
49:14
really happy i'm not on twitter so one
49:16
of them is the one of them is at
49:18
schreiber
49:18
[Laughter]
49:22
schweiblen is right there on a par with
49:23
the big ben twitter feed which is
49:25
fantastic what are you talking about big
49:27
ben clock is so good great at one
49:29
o'clock it tweets bong at two o'clock it
49:31
tweets bong bong and it's been doing
49:33
that for years every hour okay so that's
49:35
andy's favorite twitter feed but it does
49:37
do that and one that i do like though is
49:40
um do you go have you guys seen kim
49:43
kierke kardashian
49:44
kim what kim kirk kardashian no no it's
49:47
a combination of kim kardashian and
49:49
kierkegaard uh and it says it's the
49:51
philosophy of kierkegaard mashed with
49:53
the tweets and observations of kim
49:55
kardashian and it includes things like
49:57
filling in the eyebrows with a pencil or
49:59
powder helps eliminate the imperfection
50:00
that pertains to everything human
50:04
it's really fun that's great it's so
50:06
clever
50:08

00:11
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:14
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:16
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:18
covent garden my name is dan schreiber
00:20
i'm sitting here with anne miller james
00:22
harkin and anna chazinski and once again
00:24
we have gathered around the microphones
00:26
with our four favorite facts from the
00:28
last seven days and in no particular
00:30
order here we go
00:32
starting with you
00:33
james harkin
00:34
okay my fact this week is that
00:37
the very hungry caterpillar was
00:39
originally called a week with willy the
00:42
worm nice quite a different book that
00:45
sounds like yeah how how similar was it
00:47
to the story about a caterpillar oh well
00:49
it was a different ending
00:51
but it was a similar worm didn't turn
00:52
into a butterfly no the worm didn't turn
00:54
into a butterfly um the book was written
00:56
by a guy called eric carl and he was
00:58
inspired by a whole punch
01:00
um he noticed that the hole was going
01:02
through some paper and he thought what
01:04
if i turn this into a book
01:06
and so he thought well i could do a
01:07
bookworm that goes through the holes
01:10
and so that's why it was called willie
01:12
the bookworm and then i think it was his
01:14
publisher came up to him and said well
01:15
why don't you change it instead of a
01:17
worm into a caterpillar and he thought
01:19
aha caterpillar's turned into
01:21
butterflies spoiler alert i could do
01:23
that at the end of my book okay do we
01:26
know was it going to be like monday
01:27
willy the worm goes to the shops tuesday
01:31
stays in bed all day it just seems i
01:32
don't know why you spend a week with
01:34
willie the world this is the worst craig
01:35
david song
01:38
there are some quite traumatizing
01:39
children's booms out there there's one
01:40
that's like um about the journey of a
01:42
sperm which is really popular at the
01:43
moment i don't know what the sperm is
01:44
called where will he went i think it is
01:47
which is actually very misleading
01:48
calling it willy i think that is going
01:49
to confuse a lot of children
01:51
i saw a picture of that book where willy
01:53
went um it's called the big story of a
01:56
little sperm
01:57
and on the front cover it says the best
01:59
story of its sort the daily mail
02:02
so it's like this is the best children's
02:04
book about sperm in the
02:06
genre children's burn books uh last
02:08
year's best-selling uk child's author
02:11
dave williams yeah yeah they made seven
02:14
million last year of book sales
02:16
seven million pounds yes if you look to
02:18
get out of the podcasting game and into
02:20
the children's game yeah so his books
02:22
get something like six hundred thousand
02:24
sales each like these got about eight
02:26
books it's ridiculous so i didn't look
02:28
into books because i'm bored of them i
02:30
don't read i've had enough of it i just
02:31
looked at worms oh yeah uh
02:34
anyone else interested in work yeah
02:35
definitely so have you ever tried um
02:37
worm fiddling no what's that charming
02:40
well worm charming worm fiddling and
02:42
worm grunting are all very similar so
02:44
worms i don't think we know why but when
02:46
you create vibrations in the ground then
02:47
worms come up to the surface and so the
02:49
way you worm fiddle or worm grunt which
02:51
is like getting worms up to the surface
02:54
uh is by making vibrations in the ground
02:56
and they think it might be because molds
02:58
when they're coming to attack worms they
02:59
uh they burrow towards them make
03:01
vibrations so they come up another
03:02
theory is that they think it's rain
03:04
coming down yeah and so they're going
03:06
out so that they don't drown yeah ah we
03:09
think on the other end whenever a
03:10
tractor like plows the field that's the
03:11
vibration so the worms get exposed but
03:13
then they get eaten by all those birds
03:14
they're always following exactly and the
03:15
birds are extremely good at it like the
03:17
seagull dance that you often see them
03:18
doing um where they bounce around on the
03:20
floor a little bit to get the worms to
03:22
come up
03:23
but so worm grunting charming fiddling
03:25
whatever is kind of a competitive sport
03:27
and the person who holds the record for
03:29
it is a 10 year old girl who set it in
03:31
2009 in cheshire and she brought up 567
03:36
worms wow
03:38
amazing so cool this little portion of
03:40
land there was one um yeah i think it
03:42
was like two or three years ago at the
03:43
world worm charming word no one got a
03:45
single worm in the entire
03:48
group of charmers well maybe that's why
03:50
uh they've got more imaginative in how
03:52
to get them up apparently uh in the
03:54
competition that this girl won
03:56
techniques to get the worms up included
03:57
a man who strummed rock tunes on his
03:59
guitar
04:00
a woman who tap-danced to the theme from
04:02
star wars and a man who played the
04:03
xylophones with bottles none of whom
04:05
actually won but it does sound like a
04:06
really entertaining event what did she
04:08
do again uh she just did uh you the
04:11
common way is you tap the ground with
04:12
sort of so she just went classic on it
04:14
she went classic
04:17
um i had a we look at eric carl's
04:18
website and his frequently asked
04:20
questions can you guess that one of his
04:21
frequently asked questions about the
04:22
hungry caterpillar is um the one problem
04:25
with the hungry caterpillar
04:28
uh it's that it comes out of a cocoon
04:29
not a chrysalis okay so usually
04:31
butterflies come from crystallizes but
04:32
there is one called the panacea that
04:34
comes in a cocoon so everyone's
04:36
quibbling i thought that was a good okay
04:40
frantically looked to how he could yeah
04:42
they live in siberia
04:45
i based it on a siberian
04:47
caterpillar but he also says um and
04:50
here's my unscientific explanation my
04:52
caterpillar is very unusual caterpillars
04:54
don't eat lollipops and ice cream so you
04:56
won't find my caterpillar in any field
04:57
guides right [ __ ] up right yeah
05:00
i [ __ ] up
05:01
i should have said that i said this
05:04
just leave it yeah there are kids on his
05:07
website james
05:10
such an angry man
05:12
he's so angry isn't he
05:14
he is angry
05:16
a national treasure and beloved by
05:18
children yeah but he's got to curb the
05:19
language
05:22
it's not appropriate for an faq on your
05:24
own website
05:25
um can i just quickly tell you about one
05:28
really terrifying worm i know i keep on
05:30
trying to rebound this conversation back
05:32
to worms
05:33
um but there is this worm called the
05:36
bobbitt one which lives on the bottom of
05:38
the ocean oh is he named after lorena
05:40
bobbitt
05:42
i don't know who that is that's
05:43
referenced from the 50s james no it's
05:45
not is it john wayne bobbitt yeah so
05:46
lorena bobbitt was john wayne bobbitt's
05:48
wife yeah who chops off his penis yeah
05:51
that makes sense maybe he's named after
05:52
decapitated penis was it by any chance a
05:54
10 foot long penis wow not by the time
05:56
she cut it up
05:58
it is 10 foot long it lives on the
06:00
bottom of the ocean and it lives under
06:03
the sand at the bottom of the ocean and
06:04
then when prey comes past it pops up and
06:06
snaps its jaws down so fast that it can
06:08
cut fish straight in half wow and then
06:11
it sucks them so if you're cut in half
06:12
you're dead already which is good for
06:14
you and if you're not it sucks you down
06:15
into the sand
06:16
under sand and eats you i just think a
06:18
ten foot long worm that can cut fish in
06:21
half is a pretty cool worm i have a more
06:23
scary worm than that even i think yeah
06:24
oh yeah um this is a colonoscopy
06:27
performing robot no um that moves
06:30
through your body in the same way that
06:31
an earthworm moves as in they've they've
06:34
actually made the movement of it yeah to
06:36
mimic it to mimic an earthworm wow
06:37
that's quite scary is there any reason
06:39
they're sending robots into my body or
06:41
yeah it's a yeah medical purposes it's
06:43
not an ann summers product
06:46
the
06:51
i like this i clicked on the mongolian
06:53
death one which i think we've discussed
06:54
before we have by the way interesting
06:56
facts i was going to mention it but andy
06:58
has banned me from ever talking about
06:59
the mongolian battle he's your chance
07:01
he's not here i've used it like three
07:02
times for listeners who haven't heard it
07:04
it's a
07:05
worm from mongolia that shoots lightning
07:07
bolts out of its anus
07:09
a disgusting creature that fires
07:11
lightning out of its anus andy murray
07:13
will be back next week
07:15
yeah
07:16
um we should move on soon shouldn't we
07:18
oh should we okay oh we can do more
07:20
worms i've got a few more kid book
07:22
things one is one's a question which is
07:25
jk rowling has said that she regrets
07:28
killing one character from harry potter
07:30
i want to see if anyone can guess
07:32
is it harry potter
07:33
um does he die
07:35
james
07:36
it's uh so i can't answer that for
07:38
spoiler alert reasons and i actually
07:40
didn't i didn't write down his name but
07:41
he's a random ice cream man florian
07:43
fortescue right so yeah it's just a
07:45
total random character but it's because
07:47
it was a senseless killing she didn't
07:49
bring it back into the story in any way
07:51
she didn't justify the killing for any
07:53
reason she just had him killed she was
07:55
just having a bad day
07:56
someone had written into her website
07:58
saying your wizards aren't actually
08:00
technically wizards and she just lost it
08:04
okay time for fact number two and that
08:07
is end
08:08
my fact is that in world war ii the
08:10
twenty committee was in charge of
08:11
turning german spies in roman numerals
08:13
that made them the xx committee or the
08:15
double cross committee
08:17
which basically means a peak war time
08:18
someone thought you know what's good
08:19
here a pun
08:21
yeah did they do it on purpose then i'm
08:23
not so i heard this i went to bletchley
08:25
park the other week and i got told this
08:26
on the walking tour which is brilliant
08:28
but i have read recently that they were
08:29
double crossed first and then it's 20
08:31
after so either way is the double cross
08:33
pun and then 24 making it less obvious
08:35
but it was hiding in plain sight and is
08:36
there one to 19 i don't know i think
08:39
they just was 20 when someone said that
08:40
works i don't know about 1-19 actually i
08:42
think i do well i know the guy who
08:44
oversaw it was this guy called tar
08:45
roberts robertson who was the mi5 agent
08:48
who overlooked it and he would have done
08:49
it on purpose because um so wartime
08:52
rules dictated that spy code names
08:54
couldn't have a hint of the person's
08:56
actual identity in them and he
08:58
disregarded these rules completely and
09:00
made his own rule that every single spy
09:02
name had to be a pun a hint as to his
09:04
actual name or a joke amazing what was
09:06
he called he was called tar robertson
09:08
actually and i don't think he gave
09:09
himself i think he gave himself a
09:10
perfectly like impossible to uncover
09:13
name but so it was like dusko popov was
09:16
his second in command and he called him
09:18
scoot because he popped off nice
09:21
although he then later changed his code
09:23
name to tricycle because he was known
09:25
for having threesomes
09:26
i have tricycle i have that arthur owens
09:28
was one of the first agents they turned
09:30
on this and his code name was snow which
09:31
is most letters of his surname yes yeah
09:34
but he was great because he was one of
09:35
the presence to work for this committee
09:37
and he was very useful because the ab
09:39
where the germans used him as their
09:40
meeting great for new agents arriving in
09:42
britain so everyone that came in to spy
09:43
for them went through him he was
09:45
reporting to mi5 so he could just let
09:47
them know what was going on so just to
09:48
give this a bit more context this is
09:49
world war ii bletchley park had set up
09:51
they were trying to um sort of get a lot
09:54
of tricks over on the germans and a lot
09:56
of german agents were coming into
09:58
britain and immediately either being
10:00
caught or giving themselves up and then
10:02
acting as double agents going back to
10:04
germany or sending messages back back
10:06
and it was a huge part of the war i mean
10:07
it led to some of the biggest moments in
10:09
the war like the d-day
10:11
uh yeah the d-day justified it i have
10:13
read one really good uh book extract
10:16
which is basically saying this was this
10:17
ridiculous sideshow where these idiots
10:19
playing spy games for the whole war
10:21
mostly pointless and the only reason we
10:23
now look back on them with this like air
10:24
of god they saved us because of d-day
10:27
like there was one instance where we
10:29
tried to persuade the germans that we
10:30
were going to be attacking uh the french
10:33
coast at a certain place and so we sent
10:35
out all these secret radio signals
10:36
hoping they'd pick them up and stuff and
10:38
they'd get all their troops there and
10:39
then we sent some dummy boats out
10:41
towards the french coast so it seemed
10:42
like we were going to attack and they
10:44
hadn't picked up on any of these things
10:45
we planted in their radio waves so we
10:47
just like spent ridiculous amounts of
10:49
money and effort on absolutely nothing
10:52
one of my favorite double agents was a
10:53
guy who was a code named garbo so he was
10:56
a guy called uh jual pujol garcia from
10:59
barcelona he was anti-communist
11:00
anti-nazi wanted to work for the british
11:02
but he thought he'd be more helpful he
11:03
was already a german spy so he got
11:04
himself recruited by telling them he had
11:06
a visa and was going to england anyway
11:07
he didn't have the visa so he would
11:09
spend his all his time in lisbon library
11:10
making up stuff for his spy network and
11:13
research lines including things like
11:14
there are in glasgow men who will do
11:16
anything for a liter of wine
11:18
and his reports were so that was a lie
11:19
was it that was um his impression from
11:21
lisbon of what life in britain was like
11:23
but his reports were so accurate mi5 got
11:25
really worried and started hunting for
11:26
this mall in the uk because they thought
11:28
stuff was getting out he was just making
11:29
it all up
11:30
and then in the end he managed to get
11:31
recruited by britain and came over here
11:33
to spy told the germans he had 24 spies
11:35
this big network and because it was
11:36
backed up by the british whenever he
11:37
killed someone off they put their
11:38
obituary in the paper so it would look
11:40
legit the germans right um as on d-day
11:43
he was telling his clients to stand by
11:44
for an important message to distracting
11:45
them from what was actually happening
11:47
and they never found out when he got
11:49
honors after the war for his efforts by
11:50
the germans um i didn't know that thing
11:52
about all the names had to be a slight
11:54
pun and i've got a big list of names of
11:57
some of the spies and is it all falling
11:59
into place now slightly i mean you've
12:00
got to sort of know what they did like i
12:02
don't know what biscuit did i ate a lot
12:04
of snacks i can presume what the spy
12:07
careless did
12:09
got fired
12:10
yeah
12:11
freak um not sure what he did gander oh
12:14
god i can tell you uganda yeah ganda was
12:16
just kurt goose
12:18
which i would have been so annoyed if i
12:20
was called kurt goose and my boss said
12:22
i'm gonna give you the code name ganda i
12:23
think i'd be saying do you mind giving
12:25
me a slightly less obvious code name
12:28
how about this one sniper
12:31
i wonder if the idea is because like in
12:34
those days there would have been a
12:35
stereotype that germans don't have a
12:36
sense of humor probably
12:38
and they thought by doing puns they'll
12:40
never get these puns because germans
12:41
don't have a sense of humor i bet they
12:42
had that chat yeah yeah my five hq
12:46
mullet i'm gonna guess that one
12:48
airbase
12:50
well the word mullet about hair only
12:52
dates back to the 1980s ah that was the
12:55
earliest anyone's ever found it is in a
12:57
song by the beastie boys and no one's
12:59
ever found an earlier use of the word
13:01
mullet so beastie boys technically
13:03
coined mullet yeah actually it might
13:04
even be the 90s um so the first german
13:07
spies who came over were ill-prepared
13:11
right they couldn't speak any english a
13:13
lot of them or spoke really bad english
13:16
to the extent that um mi5 thought they
13:18
were joking thought they were lying and
13:19
used to interrogate them and say
13:21
obviously you know germany wouldn't be
13:22
stupid enough
13:24
who could not speak any english but yeah
13:26
isn't that bizarre yeah so with
13:28
bletchley when they set this up the way
13:29
that they started recruiting people was
13:31
through a crossword that they put out in
13:32
the papers and they've set a challenge
13:34
saying if people think that they can do
13:36
a crossword in within 12 minutes come
13:38
and take this challenge so people came
13:40
and they did the challenge and after
13:41
they won they were then re-contacted
13:43
saying listen you managed to do this why
13:44
don't we get you to uh to work at
13:47
bletchley and they reprinted the
13:49
crossword you can try the crossword and
13:51
see if you can do it in 12 minutes yeah
13:52
i send off crosswords to the sunday
13:54
times and telegraph when i've done them
13:56
and i do it in the secret hope that one
13:58
day i am going to get a phone call that
14:00
one i mean they do invite you to send
14:01
them off to win a fountain pen it's not
14:02
like i'm just sending it unsolicited how
14:04
many boosts every week how many pens do
14:05
you have to telegraph i've never won a
14:07
pen i want a notebook i've never once
14:10
successfully got the clue to a crossword
14:12
right ever
14:13
what a credit i have any crossword and
14:15
i've tried that's exactly what a spy
14:18
would say that wouldn't they they'd be
14:19
like terrible i am so bad at crosswords
14:21
they would never recruit me today i find
14:23
out dan schreiber is a spy is the day i
14:24
book my ticket to mars one way
14:27
well here's another bit of evidence he
14:28
doesn't really speak very good english
14:30
[Laughter]
14:34
would a spy say covered garfield yeah so
14:37
no one knows where we are it's an active
14:38
genius her name schreiber german surname
14:41
what does that mean again
14:43
schreiber writer writer writer yeah i'm
14:45
just saying that and that was an ironic
14:47
kind of pun right when they gave you
14:49
that yes this is all falling into place
14:53
there's this book called uh double cross
14:55
the true story of dj spices by a guy
14:57
called ben mcintyre and i would highly
14:59
recommend it it's full of really
15:00
exciting spices yeah could i just say as
15:02
well um he wrote a book called agent
15:04
zigzag one of the best non-fiction books
15:06
i've read about spying i just i think it
15:09
reads like an indiana jones novel based
15:11
on one of these agents agent zigzag yeah
15:14
he's awesome but so he tells this story
15:16
about a spy called augusta caroli who is
15:19
a german spy who uh was parachuted into
15:22
the northamptonshire countryside he got
15:24
concussed because he had a bad landing
15:26
and he tried to sleep off his concussion
15:27
in a ditch a farmer saw his leg poking
15:29
out and so he was arrested but then it
15:32
was great being arrested as a spy in
15:33
those days because you'd immediately
15:34
have the government going well do you
15:36
want to just be a spy for us instead so
15:37
he was arrested and agreed to be a
15:39
double agent for britain but he agreed
15:41
at first and then he sort of changed his
15:42
mind and decided he was betraying the
15:44
nazis so he was in a safe house in
15:46
cambridge and he was given a minder
15:48
because double agents had minders to
15:49
check they weren't going rogue and uh he
15:51
crept up behind his minder while he was
15:53
playing patience and tried to throttle
15:55
him with a piece of rope when this
15:56
didn't work he apologized tied him to a
15:59
chair and ran off with a tin of
16:01
pilchards a pineapple and a large canvas
16:03
canoe then he stole a motorbike and rode
16:05
towards the coast with the canoe
16:07
balanced on his head with the plan to
16:09
road to holland he fell off the
16:11
motorbike unsurprisingly i guess um and
16:14
then he approached a passing man and
16:16
asked him to help him dispose of his
16:18
canoe over a hedge at which point when
16:20
the man had helped him do that this man
16:22
called the police and said a guy with a
16:24
german accent on a motorbike and a canoe
16:25
on his head just asked me to help him
16:27
dispose of his canoe does that sound
16:29
right and then the quote from this book
16:31
was clearly unfit for double agent work
16:33
he spent the rest of the war in prison i
16:35
like to think that if he'd have gotten
16:36
to the coast he would have gotten his
16:38
canoe and put the motorbike on his head
16:39
and rode across
16:45
this i feel like you've told me this
16:47
before ann and i don't think it's been
16:49
on our show which is that um at one
16:51
point when bletchley was going on agatha
16:53
christie yeah yeah so she got
16:55
investigated do you want to tell the
16:56
story it's really interesting well so
16:58
agatha christie um had a friend who
17:00
actually worked at bletchley who was
17:02
very much a part of the enigma
17:04
code cracking team
17:06
and she released a book called n or m
17:08
and in it there's a character called
17:11
major bletchley
17:13
and
17:14
everyone got really worried that this
17:15
guy dilly knox's name was was leaking
17:18
information about bletchley to agatha
17:20
christie and um it turns out that what
17:23
happened was she was on a train heading
17:25
back to london from oxford and it
17:27
stopped for ages at bletchley and she
17:29
got so annoyed by being stopped in the
17:31
delay that she said i'm going to name
17:33
the worst character in my book after
17:35
this crappy town that we've been stuck
17:37
in and so it was just a total
17:39
coincidence um bletchley isn't on the
17:41
way from oxford to london
17:43
she's a spy she's obviously ever a
17:45
cleverest excuse ever and i can't
17:46
believe james and i are the first ones
17:48
to spot that she's my did she mean
17:50
reading
17:51
all the spies were in reading park and
17:53
we've just been mishearing this year
17:56
just a couple of things on punting yep
17:57
always obviously a pun in the name so
18:00
there's a pawn in the book of genesis
18:02
what is that bible um problem is that
18:04
puns that are written in different
18:05
languages aren't very good to repeat on
18:06
this podcast because we can't get them
18:08
unless i explain the language to you but
18:10
um so it's that the word for uh cunning
18:14
which describes the serpent is very
18:15
similar to the word for naked so the
18:17
words are arum and aramim and so i think
18:20
it's the idea is maybe that it's a pun
18:22
saying that the serpent is very close
18:24
with its evil is actually very close to
18:26
these naked people who are about to be
18:27
evil
18:28
or so that's very very funny
18:31
yet they did
18:32
[Laughter]
18:34
[Applause]
18:37
[Music]
18:38
okay time for fact number three and that
18:41
is chezinski my fact this week is that
18:44
houses in bali are built in proportion
18:46
to the owner's body
18:48
that's incredible it's so cool what does
18:50
it mean i don't actually know what it
18:52
means i mean if you have a big head they
18:53
do a big roof or something it's kind of
18:55
like that except it's not quite laid out
18:57
like that you obviously haven't spoken
18:58
to balinese architects but it's similar
19:00
um hang your head in shame james
19:04
um so they employ a special kind of
19:05
architect who's called an undoggy and
19:07
the first thing he does when you employ
19:09
him to come and build your household is
19:11
he measures all your body parts and
19:13
works out and by those measurements he
19:16
can work out what shape and size to make
19:18
the house
19:19
so he'll measure different parts of the
19:21
head
19:22
he measures the distance from the elbow
19:24
to the fingers i think uh the width of
19:26
the fist the length of the index finger
19:28
the width of the little finger and all
19:30
these measurements determine the size of
19:32
the compound and the dimensions inside
19:34
of like pavilions and the spacing of
19:37
different pillars and the with the beds
19:40
even is determined by you know the width
19:41
of a fingernail or whatever it's so
19:43
weird that's amazing yeah it's really
19:45
cool and there's a bit so part of the
19:46
house represents the head and that's
19:48
where the head of the family should stay
19:50
because they think that the head is the
19:52
most sacred part of the body it's the
19:53
best bit and then the
19:56
feet are where sort of the cows and the
19:58
pig if you've got if you own farm
19:59
animals the foot area of the house is
20:02
where they stay and then it's got an
20:03
anus area which is where the rubbish is
20:05
and which is where they measure how do
20:07
they measure the size of uranus i
20:08
believe they have to wow otherwise you
20:10
can't build a proper house that's
20:12
amazing i mean i'm assuming that's not
20:14
every single house in bali i've been to
20:16
bali and i've never seen the
20:17
measurements no it's traditional houses
20:19
because i mean
20:20
if you didn't know who had done that
20:23
process had not and you got to their
20:24
house and you saw at the back there was
20:26
a massive rubbish bit but mike's got a
20:28
massive anus
20:30
i had no idea
20:31
is he okay
20:33
there's three skips
20:37
yeah i don't know if they do that right
20:39
i wonder if you'd be able to go to a
20:40
house measure all the rooms and say oh
20:42
this person must have slightly above
20:44
average size head
20:46
large anus
20:48
large feet so it's going to be jeff or
20:51
whatever yeah or maybe there's if you
20:52
take your girlfriend home then she
20:55
brings a tape measure and you find her
20:56
measuring the sort of protruded
20:58
extension at some point and that's
21:00
that's how you judge a man isn't it what
21:02
you mean it's like you know what they
21:04
say about men with large areas for their
21:06
pigs and cattle
21:08
huge food intruding extension
21:09
[Laughter]
21:12
by the way uh jeff and mike not very
21:15
balinese names that we've picked for
21:17
these examples um but balinese names are
21:19
really interesting
21:21
so i used to go to bali a lot as a child
21:23
because i grew up in hong kong it was it
21:25
was very close and um so we used to go a
21:27
lot because hong kong being a concrete
21:29
jungle you sort of wanted to get away
21:31
from the city and that was a nice place
21:33
that you could get to very easy and the
21:35
names there uh so they're kind of given
21:37
the same names um this is traditionally
21:40
so i don't wanna speak as if everyone's
21:42
got this but waian is a name that i've
21:44
known since childhood because everyone
21:46
i've met there is called wyan it's the
21:48
oldest that's the first sun is called
21:49
wyan
21:51
there's a few other options for that as
21:52
well but wayan is the the big one um
21:55
second born names maddie and wyan's for
21:58
guys by the way um
21:59
then you've got the third borns the
22:01
fourth borns and that's all that the
22:03
list goes up to so then if you have a
22:04
fifth child they just call it uh wyan
22:08
and then use the word for again
22:12
so the word for the name for a fourth
22:14
child the ones that dan's just listed
22:16
there have a few alternatives so you can
22:17
say wyan and then there are a couple of
22:19
other synonyms that they say so you
22:20
could have one of two or three names but
22:23
for the if you're the fourth born
22:24
there's only one name and i think that's
22:26
because at the time the system was set
22:28
up they wanted to discourage people from
22:30
having too many kids so they were like
22:31
look you're fourth kid you've only got
22:32
one option for the name and that option
22:34
is ketut and it means little banana
22:37
as in the smallest banana at the end of
22:38
the bunch so every single fourth child
22:40
is called little banana that's so much
22:42
sweeter do you remember the thing we had
22:44
about victorian slang for the youngest
22:45
child
22:46
what was that last shake of the bag oh
22:48
yeah
22:49
nice one victorians um i just this is
22:52
completely off topic but i was reading
22:54
about it today um if you read any old
22:57
kind of guinness book of records there's
22:58
often the uh woman with most children
23:02
uh and she was russian she was from st
23:04
petersburg i can't remember her name
23:05
valentina maybe it was something maybe
23:07
valentina vasiliev or something anyway
23:10
so she had um 67 children if i remember
23:13
rightly a lot of them were triplets and
23:16
um you know twins i bet she's got a big
23:18
garbage dump isn't she
23:26
[Laughter]
23:34
valentina yeah but what i what i learned
23:36
um today is that her husband after um he
23:40
left her and then went to another woman
23:42
and had 18 children with her
23:44
wow
23:46
but it's like 19th century so i think
23:48
we're not 100 sure if it's all true but
23:50
there are some contemporary reports
23:52
about it wow
23:53
so it's possible that everyone in st
23:54
petersburg has descended from that one
23:56
man that is
23:58
that's the logical conclusion
24:01
so in bali they have sort of an inbuilt
24:03
sense of direction it's one of the first
24:05
things you learn is your sense of
24:06
direction and um anthropological
24:09
accounts will say that if like a
24:10
traditional balinese person um moves to
24:13
a place where they're not sure about
24:14
their orientation and they get really
24:16
disoriented then that can make it makes
24:18
them feel really uncomfortable you mean
24:19
like it's you always know which way is
24:21
north korea you always know which way is
24:23
north except if you go to bali and you
24:25
ask which way is north sometimes they'll
24:28
point south
24:29
because
24:31
i think these people have an
24:32
extraordinary way of telling where's not
24:35
why do they
24:36
smell so the reason they point south is
24:37
actually because the equivalent north in
24:39
bali is actually just towards their
24:41
biggest mountain um so in the biggest
24:44
mountain in bali is right in the middle
24:46
and so it's not actually north it's kaja
24:48
but that's often translated in english
24:50
as north and most people live in the
24:52
south of bali so kaja is usually north
24:54
but if you're in north bali and they say
24:56
kaja then they mean south towards the
24:58
mountain right and all of the
24:59
orientation is is based on towards the
25:02
mountain or towards cool
25:04
but i reckon if i had to point towards
25:06
the largest feature in my island
25:09
i would be able to do that because it's
25:10
a massive mountain you just go look it's
25:12
there you stop doing down there innate
25:14
sense of direction i couldn't point to
25:15
like ben nevis yeah they can't hear
25:17
anything
25:18
they can't all see it although
25:19
i did read something that said that
25:20
balinese people who live nearer other
25:23
mountains use that mountain instead as
25:24
north is this mount agung yes yes okay
25:27
so mount agung uh it's twice the size of
25:29
ben nevis can you see it from everywhere
25:31
like can you see it like i feel like it
25:32
was always you know there's i mean
25:34
there's obviously bits where you just go
25:35
way too far and it's just whatever fog
25:38
might take over something like that but
25:39
um
25:40
yeah it's that erupts quite it used to
25:43
erupt quite a lot i remember as kids
25:44
when we used to go past it we were
25:46
always really scared because they said
25:47
well it's still active and
25:49
that's not what you want to hear yeah
25:50
and i asked my uh dad what would we do
25:52
in the situation he said well i'd grab
25:54
your sister and run
25:56
what about me
25:57
so in the scenario of death uh i was
26:00
being left behind by my dad that's why i
26:02
learned that at least he was honest with
26:03
you yeah should we move on um just on
26:06
buildings related to body parts quickly
26:08
um china now the chinese government now
26:11
has a ban on building eccentric
26:12
buildings um because people keep
26:14
building buildings they consider
26:16
embarrassing one of them was built by a
26:17
british company and uh it's called the
26:20
pair of pants it's been called the pair
26:22
of pants it used to be called the gate
26:24
of the orient building
26:25
because it looks like a giant pair of
26:27
trousers and lots of people in the area
26:29
complained it's in suzhou in china and
26:32
local bystanders are raging that it's
26:34
just a big pair of pants as soon as the
26:36
legs were joined together and they say i
26:37
just feel like i'm humiliated as i walk
26:39
onto someone's crotch and so the chinese
26:41
government said look no more
26:43
embarrassing buildings
26:45
wow yeah shame they did a few years ago
26:48
in south sudan you remember when they
26:50
got their independence they decided they
26:52
were going to build all of their um
26:54
cities in the shape of animals
26:56
wow so they were going to move their
26:58
capital from um oh god the capital is
27:01
juba i think they were going to move it
27:02
to a new city which was shaped like a
27:04
giraffe or an elephant or something the
27:07
city was shaped like a dress really and
27:09
they would put like the um the
27:11
president's palace would be in the eye
27:12
of the elephant or giraffe and the waste
27:15
disposal would be where the anus would
27:16
be cool it's like the streets will be
27:18
later yeah this yeah but they never did
27:20
it because basically it would cost like
27:22
20 billion pounds to do it and they're
27:25
the poorest country in the world so they
27:26
never did it but yeah they thought it
27:28
might get like tourism and stuff i got
27:30
to visit the giraffe town i don't know
27:32
if you would if it was in the south
27:33
sudan i'd be tempted to pop in if i was
27:36
ever going from oxford to london
27:39
[Applause]
27:39
[Music]
27:40
okay time for our final fact of the show
27:43
and that is my fact and my fact this
27:46
week is that according to isaac newton
27:49
the world is going to end in 2060.
27:53
okay and he knew a lot so he knew it
27:56
would believe it
27:57
uh no okay so we definitely shouldn't
27:59
believe it it's interesting that he just
28:01
made that prediction though and he
28:03
because obviously we all know um if
28:05
you've looked into newton's life that he
28:07
was obviously this great scientist but
28:08
he also believed in a lot of i don't
28:10
know alchemy and and
28:12
mystical sort of stuff crazy [ __ ] has
28:15
crazy stuff yeah and he also but he the
28:17
bible was one thing that he really loved
28:19
analyzing and this is where he got the
28:20
date 2060 from he was analyzing the
28:22
bible and he was trying to work out um
28:25
when the end of the world would be i
28:27
think didn't he say that 2060 is just
28:30
the earliest that yes
28:32
i think he said um it may end later but
28:34
i see no reason for it ending sooner
28:37
than 2060. yeah he also said it was to
28:39
uh to put a stop to the rash conjectures
28:42
of fanciful men who are frequently
28:43
predicting the time of the end and by
28:45
doing so bring the sacred prophecies
28:47
into discredit as often as their
28:48
predictions fail i should rephrase my
28:50
fact according to isaac newton the world
28:52
will end in 2060 or sometime in between
28:56
then and the end of the universe well
28:58
actually no i think the um one of the
29:00
leading newton scholars who's called
29:02
snowblown said has worked out exactly
29:04
what he meant by it and says he thought
29:06
the world was going to end sometime
29:07
between 2060 and
29:09
2344. okay so it's in that window okay
29:13
apparently
29:15
yeah but yeah i think it was just it was
29:17
sort of rough scribblings wasn't it it
29:18
wasn't really ever meant to be published
29:20
you scribbled it on the back of an
29:21
envelope literally yeah i think and it
29:24
might have just been to put off as anne
29:25
says all of these scaremongers who kept
29:27
on predicting the end of the world and
29:29
he really got very annoyed about that
29:30
all these prophecies that we're saying
29:32
the world's going to end so we thought
29:33
the way to counter that is for me to
29:34
prophesy when the world's going to end
29:36
you also need to put it way out of his
29:37
own lifetime so no one can say you were
29:39
wrong yeah but so he he was a truly
29:41
interesting character yeah outside of uh
29:44
his work in science um interestingly his
29:47
most famous work uh which i find hard to
29:50
say principia
29:51
uh almost didn't get published
29:53
how come because a book just before it
29:56
that was published uh was called uh
29:58
history of fishes or historia passium
30:01
and it bankrupts basically the whole of
30:04
the world and
30:11
if somehow the world pulled the pulled
30:12
the cash together uh yeah and they got
30:14
the money together eventually and so was
30:16
published so yeah what do you actually
30:18
mean that was to do with the royal
30:19
society yeah so they had they had
30:21
funding for publishing books and they
30:23
thought this book on fishers was going
30:24
to be massive and it tanked uh no one
30:26
bought it
30:27
[Laughter]
30:29
um so it basically delayed um the
30:32
publication of principe so they weren't
30:34
able to do it and then edmund halley
30:36
stood in and he said that i think this
30:38
book should be published and even put in
30:40
some of his own money and so it was
30:41
eventually published in 1687 but there
30:43
was a point where it wasn't going to be
30:45
published because of the situation that
30:47
they were in that's really interesting
30:48
yeah i have another royal society bit
30:50
which is there was a bit of well today
30:52
it's generally accepted that both uh
30:54
newton and leibniz came up with calculus
30:56
independently but there was one that was
30:58
sort of they set up basically the royal
30:59
society in 1713 set up a committee to
31:01
decide once for all who'd done it who
31:03
and they found that it was newton
31:05
cheerio the committee you said you said
31:09
i think it was me you're fine
31:12
but he had a like he had a lot of
31:14
professional rivalries really bitter one
31:15
with hook pockets are what
31:19
and actually hook he gets everywhere
31:20
peter pan he pisses off
31:23
that's a bad guy a crocodile
31:27
i think he might be the good guy i don't
31:28
know it's hard to say who's the good guy
31:30
i think they're both not very good guys
31:32
actually yeah okay so um he yeah he had
31:34
this dispute with hook and it was about
31:37
uh when he came up with his theory of
31:38
gravity and hook said that actually
31:41
newton got part of this idea from me
31:43
about how gravity decreases the inverse
31:45
square law the inverse square law
31:47
precisely don't explain that we all know
31:49
about that
31:51
dan and i don't want to patronize anyone
31:53
and yeah newton just wrote this letter
31:55
saying uh he had absolutely nothing to
31:57
do with it and i don't need to include
31:58
him in my book but there is a theory
32:00
that you know the quote that newton is
32:02
most famous for saying which is your
32:05
mama's so fat
32:08
your mum is so fat that the gravity
32:10
decreases by the inverse of the square
32:12
of the distance as i move away from her
32:15
was that it
32:17
sorry guys
32:18
um his most famous quote is if i have
32:20
seen further it is standing on the
32:21
shoulders of giants oh yeah yeah so and
32:24
he wrote that to robert hook in a letter
32:26
where he was saying you know i've it's
32:28
it's been a real help having you guys
32:29
around if i've seen further it's by
32:31
standing on the shoulders of giants some
32:33
people believe actually this was just a
32:34
jibe hook because hook had a quite
32:37
serious back problem which caused them
32:38
to have a really massive hunch and so
32:41
some people have now speculated you look
32:43
like a stepladder
32:45
no
32:47
i don't get it what's the chime so he's
32:49
thanking the giants but not hit because
32:50
he's too small oh yeah small yeah you're
32:53
not one of those giants yeah not like
32:55
it's nice that you're bending over so i
32:56
can climb onto your shoulders
32:58
he so um i found a list have you guys
33:00
read this list that he wrote when he was
33:02
about 20 years old yes
33:04
incredible
33:05
it's such an insight
33:07
what are your favorite ones my favorite
33:09
is threatening my father and mother
33:10
smith to burn them in the house over
33:12
them yeah
33:13
that's pretty vicious
33:15
the next one is wishing death and hoping
33:16
it to some
33:18
wow eating an apple at thy house
33:20
probably the apple
33:22
carter ate it was that so you're not
33:23
allowed to eat an apple in church i
33:25
guess at the time you focused on praying
33:27
not your belly
33:28
24 punching my sister
33:30
[Laughter]
33:32
25 rubbing my mother's box of plums and
33:34
sugar yeah oh is that some kind of weird
33:36
euphemism no making jam but making jam
33:39
is a euphemism so there you go people
33:42
have speculated about his relationship
33:43
with his mother it was very difficult
33:45
and twisted a lot of people have
33:47
freudianally uh decided that he has
33:49
mother issues and that's why he remained
33:50
a virgin his whole life which he did
33:52
didn't he never really had an attachment
33:54
to women because they think and he hated
33:55
his stepfather
33:57
he didn't like his sister much because
33:58
he punched her no that was a sign of
34:00
affection in the 17th century
34:03
okay going on to the end of the world
34:04
yeah um there's a book called 88 reasons
34:08
the rapture will be in 1988
34:10
by edgar wiseand
34:13
which i really like and
34:15
on amazon there's some one-star reviews
34:18
in fact there's only two reviews and
34:19
they're both one star reviews
34:21
um and one of the reviews is really it's
34:24
impossible to give this a positive
34:25
review given that it exists entirely to
34:28
preach that the rapture will be
34:29
happening in 1988
34:31
as i recall the rapture did not occur in
34:33
1988
34:36
but yeah this guy edgar weissman was
34:38
quite famous at the time but um
34:39
obviously in 1989 they realized that he
34:42
was wrong
34:44
but then his next book was called
34:46
rapture report 1989
34:48
and then he also wrote another one
34:50
called 23 reasons it looks like the end
34:53
of the world will occur on rosh hashanah
34:55
1993
34:57
and another one called earth's
34:59
destruction by fire nuclear bomb fire
35:01
prediction for 1994 is it an annual
35:05
it is phenomenal how these people manage
35:07
if it doesn't when it doesn't happen to
35:08
say oh yeah we just got the numbers
35:10
wrong and the next time there's always a
35:11
big fuss again there's a new story and
35:13
people panic oh i really like is this
35:14
guy in new hampshire who set up a
35:16
business called eternal earthbound pets
35:18
which will look after the pets if you
35:20
believe you're gonna be raptured you pay
35:21
him to look after your pet because the
35:22
ones who stay behind can feed the cat
35:24
and he's told the wall street journal
35:26
that they would be the people who pay
35:27
him will be disappointed twice once
35:29
because they weren't raptured and again
35:31
because i don't do refunds
35:33
but actually that he admitted that that
35:35
was a hoax a bit later on oh no well it
35:37
was because the state insurance
35:39
department came after him and said oh
35:41
you seem to be selling insurance but
35:43
you're not really registered to sell
35:44
insurance are you he um he said he's had
35:46
no clients um never issued a certificate
35:50
and he's not taking a single dollar in
35:52
the three years of its existence so the
35:54
baby isn't going well sure
35:56
um it is really um interesting though
35:58
that whole when when the rapture come
36:01
when you've predicted the rapture comes
36:02
and it doesn't what do you do after that
36:04
and i think that was one of the spurs
36:06
for psychological uh analysis of
36:08
cognitive dissonance which is the thing
36:10
where you sort of adjust reality in your
36:13
mind to suit what you've expected
36:15
because humans find it so hard to deal
36:16
with facts that don't accord with what
36:18
they thought was the truth and so i
36:20
think this was expanded in 1954 when
36:22
dorothy martin said that she'd received
36:25
news from the planet clarion that a
36:27
bunch of aliens would have come were
36:28
going to come down on a flying saucer
36:30
and beam up everyone who you know
36:32
collected in a certain area and she
36:34
gathered quite a few followers and um on
36:36
christmas eve they all went to this area
36:38
to be beamed up by a flying saucer and
36:40
they sung some christmas carols and the
36:41
flying saucer didn't come and
36:44
what she didn't realize was that her
36:45
group had been infiltrated by this
36:47
really famous psychologist called
36:48
festinger who i think is the leading
36:50
psychologist on cognitive dissonance who
36:53
was looking at how how do you justify
36:55
that and they justified it by saying the
36:57
aliens were so impressed that their sign
36:58
of devotion that they decided not to
37:00
destroy earth after all oh that is a
37:02
brilliant excuse went away again yeah
37:05
um i saw a thing on twitter about a
37:07
while ago which i love which is there
37:08
was a dystopian futures book um
37:11
convention and someone overheard someone
37:13
saying excuse me is this the cue for the
37:14
apocalypse
37:16
one of the events i just think it's so
37:17
british yeah you're going for the
37:19
apocalypse you know newton used to give
37:21
lectures to empty lecture theaters
37:24
actually someone's done a study uh on
37:26
kind of the
37:28
mentally what famous scientists are like
37:30
and that someone is simon baron cohen
37:32
who's a really famous neuroscientist and
37:34
he's also sacha baron cohen's cousin
37:36
um but this is looking into how they
37:38
display signs of autism and it seems
37:40
like newton found it really hard to
37:41
connect to other people and he gave
37:43
really boring lectures he didn't care
37:44
about lecturing he just wanted to be
37:46
alone in his attic studying so people
37:48
tended not to go and if no one went he'd
37:50
just give the lecture anyway to an empty
37:51
room we've closed off the whole street
37:53
and there's police on either side and uh
37:55
really empty
37:56
yes
37:58
and that's it for this week's episode
38:01
you'll notice our abrupt ending there
38:03
that was because alex bell came in to
38:06
tell us that the entire road that we
38:07
work on had been evacuated except for us
38:11
because we were busy making a podcast
38:13
talking about the end of the world
38:15
uh so we had to leave the building
38:16
immediately also incidentally at the
38:18
same time mount etna erupted uh so yeah
38:21
uh but that's it that's our show that's
38:23
all of our facts thank you so much for
38:25
listening if you want to get in contact
38:26
with any of us about the things we've
38:28
said over the course of this podcast we
38:30
can be found on our twitter accounts i'm
38:31
on at schreiberland and at miller
38:34
underscore
38:35
james
38:36
at egg shaped czech zinski you can email
38:39

38:40
yep or you can find us at no such thing
38:43

00:00
hey everyone james here this is our last
00:02
podcast before christmas uh we'll have
00:04
another one that goes out at exactly
00:06
midnight on christmas day and another
00:08
one that goes out on new year's day but
00:10
this is the last one before christmas
00:11
itself and being the last one we thought
00:13
we should quickly remind you that we
00:15
have written a couple of books this year
00:17
which you can buy as presents for your
00:19
friends and family
00:20
and they are
00:22
in alphabetical order one two three four
00:25
qra facts to leave you speechless this
00:27
is in alphabetical order when numbers
00:28
come before letters and that's the first
00:31
book so go and buy that or if you don't
00:33
fancy that you can buy the third qi book
00:35
of general ignorance okay on the show
00:39
[Laughter]
00:47
that didn't work at all
00:50
[Music]
00:59
hello
01:02
and
01:03
welcome to another episode of no such
01:05
thing as a fish a weekly podcast this
01:08
week coming to you from the up the creek
01:10
comedy club in greenwich my name is dan
01:12
schreiber and please welcome to the
01:13
stage it's the three regulars anna
01:15
chazinski james harkin and andy murray
01:21
[Applause]
01:28
and once again we have gathered around
01:29
the microphones with our four favorite
01:31
facts from the last seven days and in no
01:33
particular order here we go starting
01:35
with you james harkin
01:37
okay my fact this week is that there is
01:40
only a one in eight hundred thousand
01:42
chance that nobody will cough during
01:45
this podcast recording
01:48
[Laughter]
01:50
how are those odds looking now
01:55
yeah so um there's a recent study done i
01:58
saw this on the improbable website and
02:00
it was by a professor andreas wagoner
02:02
from the university of hanover and it
02:04
was called why do people not cough in
02:06
concerts the economics of concerts
02:09
etiquette
02:11
and he basically found out the the
02:14
probability that a certain number of
02:16
people would cough and i kind of
02:17
extrapolated his data into the number of
02:19
people who are here tonight and got it
02:21
completely wrong
02:22
[Laughter]
02:24
i did hear genuine coughs there was one
02:26
no we put the idea in their minds now
02:28
yeah i have an unbearable edge to go
02:32
i know i'm very suggestible but this
02:34
could really have spoiled the entire
02:35
past
02:36
so i i read a different report that
02:39
suggested that uh people actively try to
02:43
cough more when they go to classical
02:44
concerts yeah what yeah they they find
02:47
themselves just wanting to they
02:50
i knew it they're so annoying why are
02:52
they doing that all the time i don't
02:54
know i mean hang on you haven't looked
02:56
into what their motivation is kind of
02:57
hoping one of you guys had it was at the
02:58
top of the google search i figured you
03:00
guys would read it i
03:01
well luckily enough i did look into that
03:03
um
03:07
um they there's a few different thoughts
03:08
one is that you might be showing
03:10
displeasure to the performance
03:12
uh and you'll think it's a bit like i'm
03:14
not happy i'm just gonna cough yeah
03:16
great bar cello
03:20
yeah and the other thing is maybe um you
03:23
are actively suppressing the idea that
03:25
you're going to cough through most of it
03:27
and then suddenly you think okay this is
03:29
a loud bit i can finally cough and you
03:31
would do it there okay
03:32
people always do in the loud parts
03:34
yeah yeah yeah
03:37
i um there's a guy called robert r
03:39
provine who writes amazing studies on
03:42
sneezing and yawning and on coughing and
03:44
he does all these studies on sort of
03:46
bits of the bits of human experience
03:48
that don't get much scientific attention
03:49
because they're not seen as important
03:51
and so he has studied lots and lots of
03:53
people about coughing and he did an
03:55
experiment uh he asked people to cough
03:58
so on average you can cough within 1.7
04:00
seconds if you're asked to
04:03
um
04:04
whereas if you're asked to sneeze on
04:05
demand most people can't do it and if
04:07
they can the average time is 8.1 seconds
04:09
to sum it up
04:10
which i think is amazing that anyone can
04:12
do that in eight seconds it would take
04:15
me ages to work up a sneeze yeah
04:17
yeah i i used to have a friend that
04:19
could vomit on command
04:22
it's true it's true some people have
04:23
this and he would only need a tiny sip
04:25
of something and then he'd go
04:27
and just jack up onto the street it's
04:30
amazing it was extraordinary what does
04:31
he do
04:32
australia's got talent
04:37
um do you know that so talking of
04:39
sneezing and coughing a cough leaves
04:41
your mouth at 50 miles an hour which is
04:43
quite fast and i think it's yeah 3 000
04:46
droplets are expelled when you cough so
04:48
one cough 3 000 droplets are expelled
04:50
when you sneeze it leaves your mouth at
04:52
more than 200 miles an hour and more
04:54
than forty thousand droplets are
04:56
expelled from your mouth in one sneeze
04:58
wow how cool is that yeah wait how many
05:00
miles an hour
05:02
200 more than 200 miles an hour for a
05:03
sneeze 50 for a cough so it's way ahead
05:05
if you sneeze in a car that is going at
05:07
80 miles an hour
05:11
i suppose technically that sneeze is
05:12
going at 280 miles an hour
05:14
i feel like i need to explain relativity
05:16
to you
05:18
no i mean now is not the time
05:21
[Applause]
05:22
so people who are extremely bothered by
05:24
coughing might have a thing called
05:26
misophonia
05:28
uh which is basically it's a kind of
05:30
thing where you're really bothered by
05:31
any kind of noise but coughing is one of
05:33
them chewing food is another one um and
05:37
yeah we've got a few misophones in
05:39
tonight
05:42
i think there's someone that sounds like
05:44
a cop
05:48
there's a there's a 10-level scale of
05:50
misophonia and you can go online and see
05:52
which one you are
05:54
level five is when you cover your ears
05:56
if someone's coughing or kind of chewing
05:58
or whatever
05:59
level nine is consciously suppressing
06:02
the desire to do harm to others
06:07
and level 10 is actual violence
06:11
wow a level seven i found really
06:13
interesting uh it said in level seven
06:15
there was a few different things and one
06:16
of them was there may be unwanted sexual
06:19
arousal
06:22
i read i did read a wiki page about that
06:24
called coughing fetish where
06:26
yeah it's an actual thing it's an actual
06:28
thing
06:29
and we are a growing group of people who
06:30
demand
06:32
your respect all right no it's so uh but
06:35
actually it's a bit misleading uh
06:37
because coughing uh fetish is not sexy
06:40
it leads to at least two it redirects to
06:43
a page called smoking fetish and it's
06:45
the fetish of watching people smoke yeah
06:47
well speaking of getting turned on you
06:49
know when
06:52
i think you have a new member of your
06:53
group
06:56
if i can introduce myself
07:04
i'm actually okay and i can promise i
07:05
will never cough again in case nearby um
07:08
but you know when someone has a cold and
07:11
like unless you're going out with
07:12
someone who has a cold and they're like
07:13
well that's disgusting you would have
07:14
cold i'm not gonna come anywhere near
07:15
you saying i'm gonna kiss you
07:17
actually there is almost zero percent
07:20
chance you're gonna get infected um from
07:22
a cold by kissing someone right like the
07:24
only way you can get infected is if
07:25
nasal mucus dribbles down into your
07:27
mouth during there what exactly and not
07:30
you're not kissing that guy anyway so
07:32
you can't that is not an excuse is that
07:35
okay it's not an excuse but it's also
07:37
not a reason for someone to kiss you
07:39
just because you've got a cold
07:42
um the fish cough
07:45
[Laughter]
07:51
i've not got much on this
07:54
that's the shortest fact ever as it's
07:55
just two words
07:58
yeah they sort of they have particles
08:00
that clog up their gills and so it's a
08:01
half cough half sneeze it's not exactly
08:03
a cough there's an internet factoid that
08:05
giraffes don't cough
08:07
oh yeah i don't think that's true isn't
08:08
it it isn't i found a medical study of a
08:11
giraffe that was coughing
08:15
giraffe know it was about to cough
08:16
before a human knew they were about to
08:19
cough because it's got further to go
08:20
yeah where most people can cough within
08:22
like 1.2 seconds
08:25
it's like three and a half minutes for a
08:26
giraffe
08:27
um but no there was a giraffe with
08:29
severe respiratory disease uh who
08:31
couldn't stop coughing uh and ended up
08:33
dying but um
08:36
death visits us all ladies and gentlemen
08:39
so yeah
08:40
it would have died of something else
08:42
[Laughter]
08:47
james i've lost them
08:51
um dolphins don't cough do that really
08:55
no
08:56
do you have any more of that fact
08:59
um
09:01
back to you andy
09:04
mice cough
09:08
which is the same length as fish cough
09:11
so i've got a joint shortest fact
09:14
but scientists have tested it by
09:16
spraying them with little mists of um
09:19
capsaicin or capsaicin which is the
09:21
molecule which makes chili peppers spicy
09:23
so they made a mist out of it and they
09:24
sprayed a little bit of it um at the
09:27
mice and then they had tiny microphones
09:28
to listen
09:30
yeah because normally you can't hear
09:32
mice coughing because it's such a small
09:34
sound so they need an extra sensitive
09:35
microphones but what have they built a
09:37
mouse-sized version of this in my hand
09:39
so mice aren't holding the microphone
09:43
there's a tiny mouse podcast somewhere
09:47
humans cough
09:49
[Laughter]
09:52
uh we're gonna have to move on to our
09:54
next fight no yeah okay get a few more
09:56
oh my god um so drinking cough syrup
09:58
before um a pie eating championship can
10:02
shave 1.2 seconds off the time it takes
10:05
you to eat a pie
10:08
why um it's it kind of like knows your
10:11
throat and lubricates as well both of
10:13
those things yeah and so there's a ban
10:15
on what they called outside gravy
10:19
in the world pie eating championships
10:22
outside gravy that's disgusting yeah
10:23
exactly
10:24
but it was it was uh the world painting
10:26
championships is held in wigan and they
10:28
thought that people were coming in with
10:29
this gravy that was mixed with cough
10:31
syrup in 2009 barry rigby was the
10:34
champion of the painting and this was
10:35
the first year they brought in the new
10:37
rule uh and just that they asked him
10:39
what is the trick of being a great pai
10:41
eater and he said i'm not giving too
10:43
much away but the basic rule is bite
10:46
swallow bite swallow
10:48
[Laughter]
10:52
okay
10:53
time for fact number two and that is my
10:56
fact my fact this week is that the
10:59
coliseum has recently banned centurions
11:04
yeah so basically obviously it's a
11:05
massive tourist attraction now the area
11:07
and like if you went somewhere like
11:09
hollywood uh they'll have spider-man and
11:11
superman dressed up there that's the
11:12
same thing with the colosseum you get
11:14
people dressed up as centurions and
11:15
they're sort of hassling the tourists
11:17
they're charging too much they're just
11:18
getting in the way they're like a pest
11:20
there now basically
11:21
that they've said you guys are banned
11:23
and so it's the big holy year next year
11:25
and so they want to clean it up before
11:27
the whole year happens and so centurions
11:29
are no longer allowed at the coliseum
11:31
the quote from the mayor is amazing
11:32
because he said that they were
11:33
inappropriate insistent and sometimes
11:36
aggressive
11:37
considering they're dressed as men who
11:39
you know conquered europe
11:44
well centurions i mean i think this is
11:47
very well known but i just want to make
11:49
it clear how many people they tended to
11:51
rule over okay so
11:54
yeah that they ruled over 80 people
11:56
there would be eight soldiers and then
11:57
there'd be ten blocks of eight and that
11:59
would be a centurier and centurions
12:01
rolled over them but i like that two
12:03
centurions do you know what they were
12:04
called
12:05
by centurions no it was actually called
12:07
a man nipple
12:09
no what
12:10
it's called or a manipulation
12:15
but let's let's not mispronounce the
12:16
comic effect
12:20
yeah manipulate nipple is uh two
12:23
centuries of roman soldiers and it means
12:25
literally a handful it's from the same
12:27
origin as manipulation which is a
12:29
handful so they try and because they
12:31
keep they keep for centurions getting
12:33
into fights um and
12:35
in 2013 this is just a story of the kind
12:37
of scrapes they got into one of them
12:39
attacked a tourist and he fell over the
12:40
tourist fell over and broke a finger and
12:42
the tourist who was called jose aznar
12:45
said that he had offered the centurion
12:47
more cash because that was the thing
12:48
they posed for a photo with you and then
12:50
they say give us some money they say
12:51
give us five euros or ten euros whatever
12:53
and he said he had offered the centurion
12:55
more cash but quotes when i offered
12:58
extra dollars he said in italy we blow
13:00
our nose with dollars and call me a son
13:02
of a [ __ ] a mafioso and a cuckold
13:07
but it's a hard job being um being a
13:09
living statue isn't it
13:11
there was a guy i read an interview with
13:13
a guy called paul edmedys and he is a
13:15
living statue and he said that he's been
13:18
spat on prodded pushed over sniffed out
13:21
by dogs
13:23
perched on by pigeons wow
13:25
but he said that um occasionally a dog
13:28
would urinate on him
13:30
but he said he liked that because it was
13:31
a sign that he was doing well
13:36
wow but imagine going home after work
13:38
and your wife goes oh how was your day
13:40
and your life was great i got pissed off
13:42
by six dogs
13:44
there was with there were the first
13:46
arrests uh related to living statues in
13:48
the uk in 2011 and it happened when the
13:51
invisible king was convicted of
13:53
assaulting the silver wizard
13:55
[Laughter]
13:57
and the king accused the wizard of
13:58
stealing his spot which was by the
14:00
london eye prime turf but the twist is
14:02
they were flatmates
14:05
imagine that flag
14:07
when they're watching tv
14:09
are they working are they not working
14:11
[Laughter]
14:14
just i was looking at uh street
14:16
performers on living statues and there's
14:19
a street performer in paris in 2013 the
14:22
street forum in paris called stephen
14:23
cohen and with his performance he wanted
14:26
to evoke his situation which was being
14:28
torn between two countries so his native
14:30
country was south africa and then it was
14:32
france where he currently lived um and
14:35
so what he did was he went to the eiffel
14:36
tower and he was dressed like a bird and
14:39
he was wearing a garter and tights and
14:40
these long red gloves and no underwear
14:43
or trousers and had tied a rooster to
14:46
his penis and
14:48
was being led around the eiffel tower by
14:50
his penis by a rooster and
14:53
that was his art and he was arrested
14:55
yeah indecent explosion yeah sure i'm
14:58
cool with that
15:00
he missed a chance to say it was being
15:02
pulled around by his [ __ ]
15:03
[Laughter]
15:05
um i looked through an online database
15:07
of street performers oh yeah and i found
15:10
just i love these guys they're called
15:12
whispering trees
15:13
um an absolute surefire shocker
15:16
brilliant either side of an entrance
15:17
watch the queue jump so they just dress
15:19
as trees stand really still and then
15:20
whisper at you as you go by
15:23
wow
15:24
i also found big rory okay and this is
15:27
the exact entry on big rory in this
15:28
database big rory the scots giant with
15:31
power presence and bagpipes dangerous
15:33
but safe
15:36
it's funny it's a job where you have to
15:37
be slightly [ __ ] to do well that's true
15:40
no one pays statues money exactly maybe
15:43
nelson on top of nelson's column there's
15:45
a living statue
15:47
he's been there for 200 years not earned
15:49
a penny
15:52
and the world they have a world statue
15:54
championships in the netherlands every
15:56
year uh and it was won by a britain in
15:59
2009 which is really exciting a guy
16:02
called chris clarkson of southport he's
16:04
does a lot of um of statue work but
16:07
before that he was an actor and he'd
16:09
worked in a touch of frost and in
16:10
hollyoaks uh where presumably he was
16:12
fired for having a bit too much
16:13
expression
16:16
they asked him like how to be a good
16:18
statue and he said to stand in front of
16:20
the television for an hour and a half
16:22
without moving and then you'll get a
16:24
feeling of what it's like because
16:25
apparently it just really hurts like
16:27
standing still for long periods really
16:29
really hurts yeah especially if you're
16:31
watching hollyoaks
16:34
an almost linking fact back to roman
16:36
legions and roman soldiers but also sort
16:39
of on the street performances did you
16:41
know that bath is haunted by a naked
16:43
roman soldier
16:45
no yeah um
16:47
i didn't know this either but
16:51
um
16:52
apparently the apparition is said to be
16:53
quite convincing and at one point a
16:55
police officer in bathurst took it for a
16:57
genuine streaker and chased it down the
16:59
street only to see it disappear into
17:01
thin air
17:02
so look out for that it's a naked roman
17:03
soldier and the question this article
17:05
asked which i think you're going to ask
17:07
me now if he's naked how do you know
17:09
he's a roman soldier
17:15
that is the
17:16
question is he shouting veiny pdb cheese
17:23
sometimes you just know
17:25
that's so good i didn't i've been
17:27
reading a book about haunted bits of
17:29
britain by derek acorah and that's not
17:31
in there
17:32
so there's amazing places can i tell you
17:34
my favorite place up there i wrote it at
17:35
it's uh
17:36
yeovil railway station's buffet is
17:39
haunted
17:41
by a sausage roll
17:45
um so just back to the coliseum very
17:47
quickly they had what was probably
17:50
because obviously it was a huge arena
17:52
and they had seating there was a seating
17:54
plan as well
17:56
and they had probably the most early
17:57
version so far as i can read of uh
18:00
ticketing and the ticketing was done on
18:02
pottery
18:04
so you were given shards of pottery and
18:06
they'd have chiseled into it your seat
18:08
uh the the road that you were in because
18:11
how many people could they sit in there
18:12
that was it was about 50 000. yeah
18:14
that's a lot of pottery
18:18
i mean that's awesome you know when they
18:20
find ancient roman pottery it's always
18:21
in little bits and pieces yeah because
18:23
it's all broken up
18:25
directions back in town
18:30
okay time for fact number three and that
18:34
is chozinski yeah my fact this week is
18:37
that from 1978 to 1991 tens of thousands
18:42
of chicken heads were dropped from
18:44
helicopters over switzerland
18:46
okay so
18:48
yeah okay why tell us the story um so
18:50
this was because there'd been a rabies
18:52
epidemic in europe from about the 1930s
18:54
i think and foxes were infected with
18:56
rabies and it was spreading and i think
18:57
it spread about 20 miles a year so it
18:59
was gradually encroaching and they
19:01
didn't know how to get rid of it until
19:03
they came up with this idea um in
19:05
switzerland a swiss scientist came up
19:06
with this idea of putting vaccines
19:09
rabies vaccines into chicken heads that
19:12
were left over from slaughterhouses and
19:14
then dropping them from helicopters over
19:17
switzerland and then foxes eat the
19:19
chicken heads and they're immune from
19:20
rabies and i just think that's ingenious
19:23
yeah it's amazing it works so lots of
19:25
european countries took this on um so i
19:27
think germany in the late 1980s said
19:30
okay it's a bit weird and barbaric that
19:31
you're doing this whole chicken head
19:32
thing so they manufactured just little
19:34
fish pellets and dropped them instead
19:36
with the vaccine in and it turned out
19:38
that worked as well yeah it's not as
19:40
cool though
19:41
[Laughter]
19:44
imagine being in a helicopter with a
19:45
sack of chicken heads
19:47
you'd feel like the king of the world
19:53
i would
19:55
but the worst thing is oh the king of
19:57
the world is flying over us i wonder
19:59
what he's going to distribute
20:02
but they did they before they worked out
20:04
the chicken head thing they did try
20:06
other options of how to vaccinate foxes
20:08
and one of the things it was called the
20:10
vat trap and it was basically the
20:12
equivalent of a bear trap so
20:14
anything that stood on it would trigger
20:16
a giant needle that would just go quang
20:19
into them and inject them
20:21
and they had to stop because too many
20:23
hikers kept walking along
20:25
suddenly getting walloped by a needle
20:28
well did you see but did you see that
20:29
they actually didn't stop because of the
20:31
hikers because they were concerned the
20:33
people who manufactured it that would be
20:34
a problem and you know people are
20:36
getting vaccinated against rabies they
20:38
don't have when they're on a walk and um
20:40
they set these traps on a this is in the
20:43
u.s they did this yeah they set these
20:45
traps on a beach which was a deserted
20:47
beach and they thought this is a good
20:48
place to test out our vaccine and it
20:51
turned out that uh the us navy was
20:53
planning to use that deserted beach a
20:55
few days later for a mock invasion as a
20:57
training exercise for all of its
20:59
soldiers and so
21:01
the people who'd set them offered to
21:03
remove them and officials argued that
21:06
the hazards would serve as an additional
21:07
measure of the invaders prowess
21:09
[Laughter]
21:12
so the um the rabies vaccine was
21:14
invented by louis pasteur yeah uh
21:17
a few other people as well but he's like
21:19
the headline guy really
21:20
one of the things that he did in the lab
21:22
is he would get some saliva from a rabid
21:24
dog
21:25
and then he would use that for his
21:27
experiments um but unlike everyone else
21:29
who kind of used kind of gloves and and
21:32
i don't know hell bits of glasses or
21:34
whatever people use he just went
21:36
straight in there and just went up to
21:37
the rabbit dog and just got the saliva
21:40
out of there
21:41
right which is pretty brave considering
21:43
that if you got bitten the protocol was
21:45
to be shot immediately
21:50
if you got bit you just got shot
21:52
that's fierce protocol that is hardcore
21:55
i read that he sucked the saliva from
21:56
the mouth of a rabid dog which was um
21:59
sort of secured on a lab table and he's
22:01
supposedly using a pipette held in his
22:03
mouth
22:04
which seems needlessly
22:05
[Laughter]
22:07
it seems needlessly bravado-ish it kind
22:10
of feels like he's the bear grylls of
22:11
his day
22:12
unnecessary feats of apparent courage
22:15
what i have a fact about air drops okay
22:17
and animal air drops
22:20
so
22:21
um wasps pick up ants when they're
22:24
competing over food and drop them away
22:26
from the food
22:29
this is true
22:31
researchers observed this in the world
22:32
and then they tested it on um on a real
22:35
situation so they put out some tuna they
22:37
let some ants go and start eating the
22:38
tuna and then they let some they release
22:40
some wasps and
22:42
sometimes the ants will attack the wasp
22:44
and even though they're much smaller
22:45
they have you know they can spray formic
22:46
acid and stuff and so sometimes the
22:48
wasps just pick up the ants fly them
22:50
away from the tuna drop them and then go
22:53
back to the tuna imagine if you're
22:55
flying around and just dropping ants
22:57
anywhere you want to you'd feel like
22:58
king of the world
23:00
[Laughter]
23:02
[Music]
23:04
i regret sharing my fantasy with you
23:10
it's possible that the ants could enjoy
23:12
that though right because my meal was
23:14
interrupted but it was fun paragliding
23:18
yeah ants are actually small enough
23:20
there's a certain size of animal that
23:21
once you get small enough you probably
23:22
wouldn't die because your maximum
23:24
velocity you can reach is not high
23:26
enough to squish you i think even mice
23:28
you can drop from a really high height
23:29
they're not they're they're not heavy
23:31
enough to hurt them properly okay horses
23:33
on the other hand
23:37
um i i have a i have a chicken fact if
23:40
we could go to chickens um pond square
23:43
in highgate uh in london is haunted by a
23:46
half frozen chicken
23:49
oh i know whose chicken that is yes this
23:51
is the best
23:54
okay so uh so for a very long time
23:56
there's been a half rose of chicken
23:57
that's been haunting this pond and uh
24:00
everyone has been sort of going oh
24:02
there's a half frozen chicken and it
24:03
turns out that the half frozen chicken
24:06
belonged to
24:07
a man called francis bacon who if you
24:10
remember died when he was experimenting
24:13
on wait hang on which bit don't you
24:15
believe when you're shaking your head
24:17
first of all he supposedly died of a
24:19
chill after stuffing a chicken with um
24:21
snow didn't he but i don't think that's
24:23
true first of all
24:25
and then the rest of it obviously i
24:26
don't think that's true either
24:28
why would the chicken horn highgate
24:30
though that's
24:32
france's bacon might haunt highgate but
24:33
the chicken was already dead i think
24:36
i know it's a really odd situation
24:39
so chicken heads can help pro athletes
24:42
actually uh there's and this is real
24:44
there's a guy called
24:47
ouch
24:49
wow
24:50
that's a terrible burn on everything
24:51
we've heard so far
24:55
no um chicken heads can help pro
24:56
athletes there's a guy called hans
24:58
wilhelm muller wolfhart
25:02
he was the doctor from bayern munich
25:04
until quite recently when he got fired
25:06
um
25:07
but he used to inject um an extract of
25:09
chicken heads into the kind of tendons
25:12
of athletes to help them and there's a
25:14
little bit of evidence that it might
25:15
work uh he treated mike lowens steven
25:17
gerrard usain bolt paula radcliffe
25:20
bono
25:23
the five great athletes of our time
25:28
um but he got fired quite recently and
25:30
he is quite controversial um he once
25:33
prescribed goats blood injections into
25:36
um a striker from a football team um but
25:39
because he's called hans he's known as
25:40
healing hans
25:43
but he's quite famous actually
25:45
do you guys know about chucking
25:46
no okay i'm glad apparently this is a
25:49
social media phenomenon where uh you
25:52
chuck and that is it's kind of like
25:54
planking but instead of like lying flat
25:56
and impersonating a plank in front of
25:58
the camera you pretend to be a frozen
26:00
chicken carcass in public do you have to
26:02
haunt highgate
26:06
you can actually do it anywhere so all
26:08
we have to do is
26:09
take all of your clothes off and then
26:11
crouch down and then have a photo taken
26:13
of yourself and then a naked person
26:14
crouched down in a fetal position sort
26:16
of on their knees looks like a chicken a
26:18
chicken carcass how does someone sat
26:21
there naked look like a chicken any more
26:23
than a centurion
26:27
good point
26:29
no so okay so if you were just very
26:31
quickly if you were going sort of
26:33
profile and you were leaning on your
26:34
knees and you were leaning over a human
26:37
in that position looks remarkably like a
26:39
frozen chicken so many mistakes on
26:41
christmas day embarrassing
26:44
um can i this fact uh has the element of
26:47
uh talking about these uh these were
26:49
dropped from helicopters i started
26:50
looking into helicopters slightly do you
26:53
know that there's there's a hell of the
26:54
world's biggest helicopter can carry
26:57
it's big enough that it can carry a
26:58
plane wow yeah it's not exactly no way
27:01
do you know when the earliest helicopter
27:03
was
27:04
no uh da vinci supposedly had one did he
27:07
he drew one he designed one yes um but
27:10
it wasn't as early as the helicopter
27:12
that was invented in 400 bc by the
27:14
chinese
27:15
which because officially so this was it
27:16
was called the bamboo copter apparently
27:19
which stresses me out i think i might
27:21
have mentioned on the podcast before
27:22
that one of my favorite etymologies is
27:24
helicopter because oh yeah is the
27:26
etymology is so unusually split up so
27:29
it's helicos which is a spiral and a
27:32
pater which you wouldn't expect to be a
27:34
word on its own which is like the wing
27:36
so by saying bamboo copter they've
27:38
stomped right in the middle of that word
27:39
holocaust you should never say anything
27:41
copter should you it should be either
27:44
or helico exactly yeah yeah i feel your
27:46
pain anna yeah i've written i've
27:49
written a strongly worded letter to
27:51
ancient chinese emperors
27:54
you know a very popular escape from
27:56
prisoners via helicopter i mean popular
27:58
[Laughter]
28:00
defined it seems to be so uh people
28:03
actually do it more often than you would
28:05
think france holds the record for most
28:07
prison escapes via helicopter uh and it
28:11
that's 11 so actually not as much as i
28:13
was uh
28:14
as i was saying earlier it's epidemic
28:16
proportions
28:18
but there's a guy with the world record
28:20
for most helicopter escapes from prison
28:22
uh which is three he escaped in 2001
28:24
2003 2007 and at no point did someone go
28:27
we should watch out for this guy every
28:28
time he goes into the yard i say let's
28:30
put a roof on davey's cell i say we
28:32
should
28:33
okay time for our final fact and that is
28:36
andrew hunter murray my fact is that in
28:39
2015 a 10-year study concluded that
28:41
punching glass is very dangerous
28:44
[Laughter]
28:46
wasn't the only thing they found out but
28:48
it was pretty much the headline
28:50
it was a study by a group of australian
28:52
doctors and they concluded in about july
28:54
this year
28:55
they measured everyone who came into a
28:57
particular hospital from 2003 to 2012
29:00
collected lots of data and um they said
29:03
that it is really really dangerous to
29:05
punch glass
29:07
and they found out other things they
29:09
found out the typical patient who
29:10
punches class is a 26 year old single
29:13
male who is unemployed and intoxicated
29:16
[Laughter]
29:20
of the
29:21
137 people that they found who punch
29:23
glass 113 were men
29:26
uh 122 were single uh 95 were unemployed
29:31
and 91 were drunk
29:33
wow
29:35
and yeah they had one conclusion as well
29:37
which is how to deal with this thing
29:40
preventing young intoxicated males from
29:42
aiming punches at glass is a difficult
29:44
task
29:46
and perhaps the only rational method
29:48
although costly is to replace all glass
29:50
within arm's reach with safety glass
29:56
no more glass for you
29:57
[Laughter]
30:00
that's amazing i think it might be
30:02
cheaper to replace all drunk men with
30:04
sober men
30:06
this was in australia but there was
30:08
another study in uh sunderland
30:10
uh and there were only 67 patients in
30:13
this one but it was in sunderland and so
30:16
england's australia
30:21
well they found that all of the people
30:23
had consumed alcohol
30:27
but it's so it's dangerous why is it
30:29
dangerous well anna
30:33
because you can mess your hand up real
30:35
bad i mean
30:37
like the glass breaks and then a glass
30:38
gets into your cuts i just wondered if
30:40
there were any more complex conclusions
30:41
in that your hand so it was just that
30:43
people got injured a lot yeah people say
30:46
that um because i i put my hand through
30:48
a window once um but i wasn't even you
30:50
you were drunk and 26 and male at the
30:52
time
30:53
actually wasn't any of those things but
30:55
i remembered the fact that i was about
30:57
15 i remembered that people had said
31:00
that the time people most get injured is
31:01
when they retract their arm when they've
31:03
broken glass because that's when it like
31:04
slices up against you and so i held my
31:06
hand suspended out with the window and i
31:08
was in my family home and i was like
31:10
daddy
31:12
what do i do now
31:14
um but i think that is true well i held
31:16
my arm there through the hole in the
31:18
glass until my dad came upstairs and
31:20
when you can pull your hand out of the
31:21
glass now right yeah and it was
31:23
absolutely amazing that you would have
31:24
that presence of mind to think i
31:25
remember reading a paper about this
31:29
and thus was a q researcher born
31:37
um i was researching uh great bits of
31:40
glass just to see
31:44
just to see what was considered to be
31:45
this was a great qi researcher
31:50
yeah so i was i was looking into great
31:52
bits of glass and then i came across um
31:54
a whole sort of did you mean great bits
31:56
of glass to stand on and so i started
31:58
reading into great bits of glass to
32:00
stand on now one of the best bits of
32:02
glass to stand on uh and it's not a type
32:05
of glass but it's it's an achievement if
32:07
you ever get to stand on this um there's
32:09
actually at the bottom of the
32:10
international space station so i know in
32:13
in a gravity-less place there can't
32:14
really be a bottom but it's the bit
32:16
that's facing earth they actually have a
32:18
glass floor that you can stand on so
32:21
yeah so so you push yourself up to it
32:23
and there's photos of astronauts looking
32:25
down so they can see all of earth below
32:27
their feet which is really nice i've not
32:28
heard that before it's an international
32:30
association
32:31
and it reminded me uh that in the grand
32:34
canyon you can actually go on a thing
32:35
called the skywalk now which is which is
32:38
really amazing so it's this incredible
32:39
uh bit that hangs over the grand canyon
32:41
it's complete glass and you just look
32:43
down as you're looking over when they
32:45
opened it they wanted some spectacular
32:47
people to walk on it and they found they
32:49
asked buzz aldrin would you be
32:51
one of the two first people to do it and
32:53
there was another astronaut there a guy
32:55
who's the only native american astronaut
32:57
part native american astronaut oh don't
32:59
tell me that buzz was the second person
33:01
they were meant to meet up at the middle
33:03
and buzz stop to do a salute the guy got
33:05
there first so he's the second
33:07
once again the second man to make it
33:10
to something
33:12
on
33:13
punching yeah yeah um
33:15
so
33:16
recent research has just been done into
33:19
um the human fist and there is a
33:22
suggestion and one scientist strongly
33:24
believes on the basis of this research
33:26
that the human fist was evolved for
33:27
punching so we think that humans are
33:30
superior to you know all other beings
33:32
because we evolve with our dexterous
33:34
hands for writing or for whatever we
33:36
actually want to be each other up and it
33:38
turns out we're much more well adapted
33:40
our fist the fact that they fits our
33:42
fingers fit so well into the palm of our
33:43
hands that really is ideal for punch-ups
33:46
so the idea is that um an opposable
33:48
thumb you could use to grab something
33:50
but you can also use it to kind of
33:52
buttress your fist to kind of properly
33:55
hit someone right hold it down and um
33:58
nature's being defensive as well as
33:59
aggressive because apparently males have
34:02
evolved to be punched before you go any
34:05
further i have not
34:07
[Laughter]
34:09
your face says otherwise
34:14
over here but some applause over there
34:18
do you know that the world record most
34:20
punches um quickest punches this is
34:22
ridiculous by the way but the most
34:24
punches in 15 seconds is 200. no way
34:29
yeah isn't that amazing it's a guy
34:30
called bhaskar joshie he's a martial
34:33
arts expert from india and he managed to
34:35
do 215 seconds what was he hitting i
34:39
think he was hitting like
34:40
200 guys
34:46
yeah i was hitting the punch bag i think
34:48
but
34:48
do you know there's a robot that they've
34:50
trained to punch humans
34:52
why
34:53
why would you do that
34:55
we've all seen terminator 2 we know that
35:00
this is a fraunhofer iff institute in
35:03
germany and they've invented a robot
35:05
that punches people and the idea is that
35:08
you can test um how hard it has to hit a
35:11
human before it hurts
35:13
wow these guys these guys are idiots and
35:15
they're going to be the first against
35:16
the wall where the robot turns
35:19
they have like an in an ultrasound
35:21
scanner that can tell whether you're
35:23
bruising or not before you actually
35:24
bruise and the idea according to them is
35:27
that it's going to stop in the future
35:29
from humans being injured by robots
35:33
we're prepping for warfare that's
35:35
amazing you know you know they also uh
35:37
when you donate your body to science and
35:40
you can read up now on how many
35:42
different ways they sort of take you
35:44
apart and use different bits for
35:45
different things one of the things is
35:46
that they'll take your arm now and just
35:48
have it punching a punching bag
35:50
constantly to see
35:51
why we punch wow that's amazing there's
35:53
another one where you can become like a
35:55
crash test dummy can't you yeah because
35:57
um a normal crash test dummy is quite
36:00
hard to get a real you can't make it
36:02
really like a human but if you put a
36:04
human in there and then see how they
36:06
react to being in a crash then that
36:07
really really does help scientists i
36:09
think that's so cool it's like mo if
36:11
you've never done anything badass in
36:12
your actual life i think saying writing
36:15
on your donor card at the bottom please
36:17
preference for crash test dummy yeah it
36:20
is the way to go i would like my head to
36:22
be thrown out of a helicopter

00:11
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:14
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:16
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:17
covent garden my name is dan schreiber
00:19
i'm sitting here with anna chazinski
00:21
james harkin and andy murray and once
00:23
again we've gathered around the
00:24
microphones this time with our four
00:26
favorite christmas facts because this is
00:27
our christmas day special and so in no
00:30
particular order here we go starting
00:32
with you james harkin okay my fact this
00:35
week is that the oldest turkey in the uk
00:38
is called dinner
00:41
that's great
00:43
and yet so cruel how old is he she um
00:46
it's a he and he is at least 16 years
00:50
old okay and they know that because for
00:52
16 years they haven't eaten
00:54
does it get to a point where a bird is
00:56
too old to eat
00:58
you could eat it but i think birds tend
01:00
to be nicer when they're younger right
01:02
yeah because usually we eat turkeys when
01:03
they're about really young right 12
01:05
weeks older yeah chickens especially
01:07
very young indeed yeah yeah they just
01:09
fatten them up straight away and kill
01:10
them merry christmas everyone
01:14
this um
01:16
this on the farm that dinner lives um
01:18
there's a farmer called mr gee who sort
01:20
of manages the farm and um he believes
01:22
that dinner has lived so long because
01:24
he's got a girlfriend
01:26
a turkey girlfriend not a human
01:28
and he said he's got a girlfriend about
01:31
five years ago and it seems to have
01:32
given him a new lease of life he's
01:34
certainly become a bit more of a
01:36
show-off
01:37
wow how old is she it doesn't say
01:42
yeah i think isn't she also the only
01:44
other female turkey on the farm i think
01:47
it sounds um wow and she's gone for the
01:49
old guy
01:50
the oldest pensioner it was either an
01:53
old guy or a chicken i think i reckon
01:55
that her choices were pretty slim they
01:56
did say that one other reason for his
01:58
longevity is due to him being too
02:00
aggressive to catch
02:02
wow
02:04
you know there are so um turkey hunting
02:07
is a thing and turkey calling is a thing
02:08
in america isn't it and they have they
02:10
have this with a bunch of bird hunters
02:12
actually but they're i think turkeys can
02:13
make 28 different distinct sounds with
02:17
their voices that mean different things
02:18
they basically have a vocabulary of 2028
02:21
and um turkey then you sounded really
02:23
impressed at that very large volcano
02:26
wow that's really eight well i'm just
02:28
wondering what so do you know what the
02:29
words are uh
02:33
there's a per they do a soft purr um
02:36
they gobble in various ways to attract
02:37
attention they've got gradations of
02:39
alarm cool so i think a certain type of
02:41
gobble is sort of a i think there's a
02:43
bit of danger around but don't freak out
02:44
too much of your mid meal and then
02:46
there's a different sound that says
02:47
really guys get the hell out of here
02:49
we're in trouble um and people who hunt
02:51
turkeys impersonate them and it's a real
02:52
skill if you go online there's a in fact
02:54
i read a website online this morning
02:56
that said something like um 20 reasons
02:58
why you continually fail to attract
03:00
turkeys with your turkey calling and
03:02
then a list of reasons where people
03:04
completely screw up turkey calls
03:06
uh i was reading about toki wishbones oh
03:08
yeah so turkeys are related people think
03:12
to dinosaurs
03:13
and if you look at the skeleton of the
03:15
dinosaur they have wishbones so imagine
03:18
yeah t-rex sized wishbones
03:21
god and do we know if they broke them
03:23
over dinner
03:24
yeah who knows but time travelers are
03:26
the future when they go back yeah
03:28
thanksgiving at jurassic times
03:31
that's very cool yeah
03:33
um you know the thing about um sparing
03:35
turkeys so the president every year
03:37
spares a turkey oh yeah yeah of all the
03:39
turkeys that president obama has freed
03:42
only one has lived past its second
03:43
birthday
03:44
because of the farming practices which
03:46
mean they have very short lifespans now
03:48
yeah yeah the last the last two that
03:49
they pardoned do you know the names no
03:51
mac and cheese
03:53
so mac and cheese i got pardoned and um
03:55
they got to stay in a 350 a night suite
03:59
the night before they were pardoned but
04:02
did they enjoy that well i don't know
04:03
but the hotel broke the rules for them
04:04
because there's usually a requirement
04:06
that any pet over 40 pounds is not
04:08
allowed to stay and they were 50 pounds
04:09
each so
04:11
wow yeah
04:12
so let's hope they stayed it because
04:13
some rules were bent
04:14
[Laughter]
04:16
why is everyone naming turkeys after
04:18
food it's so mean yeah i know well they
04:20
are called turkey to be fair i mean they
04:22
are named after a food already
04:26
do you know their latin name means the
04:27
last name that linnaeus gave them in
04:29
1758 is meleagris galapavo galapavo
04:32
which means guinea fowl chicken peacock
04:34
chicken peacock
04:36
and catching his bet yeah i was reading
04:38
the economist thing about it and it said
04:39
it was wrong five different ways
04:42
so why is it called turkey like the the
04:44
animal not the country
04:46
because we thought it was from turkey
04:48
when they were brought over they were
04:49
brought over by arab traders who and at
04:51
the time we just thought all traders
04:53
from that part of the world um swore
04:55
allegiance to the ottoman empire the
04:56
capital of that is was in turkey okay so
04:58
we just thought um yeah middle eastern
05:00
equals turkish yeah okay actually
05:02
something that we did do because we were
05:03
so ignorant about where they'd come from
05:05
um when we decided to go back and
05:07
properly colonize america in the early
05:09
1700s we brought a whole bunch of
05:11
turkeys with us on our ships not we the
05:13
people who are going to colonize to
05:15
jamestown brought a bunch of turkeys
05:17
from britain to america saying well we
05:18
better bring these turkeys so we can
05:19
farm them in america and they got off
05:21
the boat at the other end and we're like
05:22
this place is full of turkeys guys
05:24
that was a waste of space
05:26
um so
05:28
farmers used to walk their turkeys to
05:29
london all the way from norfolk because
05:31
that's where you know turkey farming
05:32
really took off and was still there
05:34
today obviously
05:35
and it would take months to get them
05:37
along because they walk quite slowly
05:39
they walk about one mile an hour and um
05:42
it's so frustrating in the weeks before
05:43
in the weeks leading up to christmas in
05:45
the 18th and 19th centuries all the
05:46
routes into london would just be clogged
05:48
up with traffic with hues of turkeys
05:49
walking along and the thing is it's such
05:52
a long journey they're not meant to walk
05:53
long distances or they're not really
05:55
built for it so they had to have special
05:56
little shoes made for them really yeah
05:59
wow they would show them have you seen
06:01
the shoes did they not like put tar on
06:04
their feet
06:05
that is what they did with geese because
06:06
geese refused to wear shoes
06:08
refused to wear shoes and that's
06:11
apparently there's a saying to shoe a
06:13
goose made something really really
06:14
difficult to do oh really it's like
06:16
chewing a goose so they dipped their
06:18
feet in tart and then they covered them
06:19
in sand to give them some protection but
06:21
the turkeys they didn't do that no can i
06:23
do a thing about old things yeah sure
06:25
yeah okay so um there's an article in
06:28
2010 uh with britain's oldest man they
06:31
asked him what his secret for a long
06:32
life is and he said um he has five
06:34
secrets but he could only remember four
06:36
of them
06:39
he said good friends a religion uh
06:42
looking for the best in people and being
06:43
a vegetarian and there's one other but i
06:46
can't remember what it was actually i
06:48
also found the elixir of life 200 years
06:50
ago yeah i always forget that one um do
06:52
you have more stuff should we move on to
06:53
our next fact can i just uh tell a quite
06:55
a quick funny turkey story about pet
06:57
turkey yeah sure um so this is about a
07:00
pet turkey that went mis it's quite a
07:01
happy christmas tale um a pet turkey
07:03
that went missing for 10 days and then
07:05
returned to its owner it was called
07:06
bernard again after bernard matthews
07:08
because we only named turkish after the
07:09
fact that we eat them um and it was kept
07:12
as a pet by this family it was taken by
07:14
a fox so there was a trail of feathers
07:15
and blood and stuff left in this woman's
07:17
garden so oh bugger it's obviously a
07:19
goner um turned out he'd escaped from
07:21
the fox himself and he turned up like
07:23
all beaten and battered at someone
07:24
else's door and this other person had
07:27
taken him in in a nearby village and
07:28
looked after him for a bit and then
07:30
after four or five days he ran away from
07:32
her shed again and ran uh and someone
07:34
else found him he was attacked by a dog
07:36
and the owner of that dog rescued him
07:38
and took him in again and then she put
07:41
out a facebook thing i think and the
07:42
original owner was like oh that's my
07:43
turkey you've got my turkey by the time
07:45
she'd shown up the turkey had run away
07:46
again to a different person's farm and
07:49
eventually this different person put a
07:50
message up on facebook going i think i
07:52
got your turkey mate and 10 days of just
07:55
oliver twisting it from one house to the
07:57
other it turned out back at home isn't
07:59
that nice that's a great story to end up
08:01
on the on the dinner table i want to
08:03
know how to escape the fox in the first
08:04
place me too turkey versus fox i feel
08:06
like i know how that goes most of the
08:08
time though you know yeah
08:10
yeah they sat on it they flap and kick
08:13
and yeah yeah they can be dangerous okay
08:15
they've been described as fluffy
08:16
velociraptors
08:20
now yeah
08:23
just the last thing they said about this
08:25
turkey dinner one of the things they
08:26
said was he normally keeps himself to
08:28
himself that's not the thing you
08:29
normally say about serial killers
08:31
[Laughter]
08:32
20 dead foxes
08:34
[Laughter]
08:36
[Applause]
08:38
okay time for our second fact and that
08:41
is chozinski um my fact this week is
08:44
that kerry grant and clark gable used to
08:47
meet up once a year around christmas to
08:49
exchange unwanted monogrammed gifts
08:51
they'd received
08:54
so good it's so amazing i really hope
08:56
that jeremy corbyn and jeremy clarkson
08:58
have the same arrangement
09:02
so i can't take credit for finding this
09:04
this was sent in by another qi
09:06
researcher called lauren gilbert but she
09:08
has given me permission to mention it
09:10
out loud on this podcast so i am because
09:12
it's so amazing yeah that's incredible
09:14
and it just came out in this interview i
09:15
think it was an interview with clark
09:16
gable and he said they'd call each other
09:18
up after christmas and clark would say
09:20
did you get any uh any gifts with your
09:21
initials on you don't want and if he had
09:23
i'd immediately rush around to his house
09:25
and claim them as my own and we'd do a
09:27
swap
09:28
that's fantastic this is fantastic yeah
09:30
i find them really confusing i mean
09:32
they're very similar in a lot of ways
09:33
yeah and clark gable aren't they yeah
09:36
big claim there oh yeah i'm only
09:38
confused because i did all the research
09:39
for them i forgot to put their names
09:40
into each fact so i had to re-research
09:42
everything to work out which one was
09:43
gable did you just put cg for each one
09:46
you've made the same mistake a lot of
09:47
other people have made
09:49
they were both married five times which
09:51
since that's an unusual number of times
09:52
to be married is quite a coincidence i
09:54
think wow did they swap wives
09:57
they did swap monograms happy fifth
09:59
divorce cards
10:02
um grant uh actually weirdly is quite
10:05
responsible for a lot of pop culture
10:07
without probably him knowing it so
10:09
it's said that a large part of james
10:12
bond the character was based on
10:15
fleming say that yeah ian fleming was a
10:17
big harry grant fan and uh christopher
10:19
reeves said that he based a lot of his
10:20
performance as superman on cary grant
10:23
apparently he turned down the role of
10:25
james bond i'm not sure to what extent
10:26
that's true but he um according to the
10:29
story he was 58 at the time and he
10:30
thought that's a battle to be playing
10:31
this sort of uh relatively young spine
10:33
so not something that's held back other
10:35
actors
10:38
um he once got a terrier and he named it
10:40
after his own birth name because he was
10:42
born archibald leech and he got a
10:44
terrier called archibald and he called
10:46
it archibald bleach ah we should have
10:47
called it leash
10:49
yes
10:50
um cary grant also started the english
10:53
muffin lovers society
10:55
yeah um he was staying at um a hilton
10:57
hotel in istanbul and he only got one
10:59
and a half english muffins for his
11:01
breakfast and so he wrote to conrad
11:04
hilton saying was my extra half month
11:07
and they'd apparently done it as a kind
11:08
of cost saving because most people only
11:10
get three quarters of their muffin
11:12
halves um but then he said no i want two
11:15
and they changed the rules and then he
11:17
said in the future if anyone ever got
11:19
only one and a half muffins for their
11:20
breakfast then they could become a
11:21
member of his club wow i would just
11:23
wonder where my where the second half of
11:25
the second muffin had gone
11:34
and that could end up being the love of
11:35
your life or something yeah yeah that
11:37
would be a bit like um kelly hildebrandt
11:40
who in 2009 married kelly hildebrandt
11:43
wow and they met each other on facebook
11:46
uh found out they had the same name um
11:48
met each other in real life and then got
11:50
married
11:51
just because they had the same name they
11:52
thought that's enough i don't like you
11:54
at all i find it repulsive but you have
11:56
at least one thing in common
11:59
um clark gable
12:01
said one of the most famous lines in
12:03
movie history which is from gone with
12:06
the wind yeah and the line being frankly
12:08
my dear i don't give a damn
12:10
okay uh so there was a rumor that they
12:13
were they were fined for saying damn at
12:15
the time uh and no one is quite sure
12:17
that that's true but they do have
12:19
scripts of alternative lines that they
12:21
had before they had that line and you
12:23
can read them and so these are a few uh
12:26
frankly my dear i just don't care
12:28
uh frankly my dear it makes my gorge
12:31
rise
12:32
better better alternative uh frankly my
12:35
dear i don't give a hoot
12:37
and frankly my dear my indifference is
12:39
boundless oh that's a nice one isn't it
12:42
i like that one yeah i've had a fun
12:43
afternoon coming up with all those lines
12:45
yeah yeah yeah it also had very
12:47
different names uh during the draft of
12:49
the book when it was being written i
12:51
don't know if we've mentioned this
12:52
before yeah uh not in our stars and this
12:55
is a weird one baba black sheep
12:57
yeah one of the versions of the titles
12:59
was baba black sheep should have called
13:00
the draft gone with the draft
13:07
um do you know how gary grant got his
13:09
stage name because it because as i said
13:11
it was originally called archibald leach
13:12
no and he was a he was an acrobat as a
13:14
child and he was and he was that's
13:16
partly why he was so good at physical
13:17
comedy is because he from the age of
13:19
about five or six he'd been walking on
13:21
stilts he'd been doing trapeze stuff um
13:24
when he went for screen tests in america
13:25
somebody said to him archie just doesn't
13:27
sound right in america and he replied it
13:29
doesn't sound particularly right in
13:31
britain either
13:32
so they went through a load of names and
13:34
he was almost going to be kerry lockwood
13:35
but then the studio executives didn't
13:37
quite like lockwood either and someone
13:38
in this meeting just started reading out
13:40
a list of names and when they got the
13:41
grant he said that's all right did he
13:43
say that's all right because he was like
13:44
i heard clark gable gets a lot of really
13:46
desirable monogrammed christmas gifts
13:50
that's gonna work for me
13:52
uh he used to do a lot of lsd
13:54
oh yeah yeah cary grant now he wasn't
13:56
doing it um
13:58
totally recreationally it was a medical
14:00
thing doctors were trying to combat his
14:02
depression and all sorts of symptoms
14:05
wasn't it i think it was a cure for him
14:06
was it just impotence i mean he took a
14:08
hundred courses at least of lsd
14:10
isn't it true that timothy leary who's
14:12
like the great god of lsd he decided to
14:14
do it because he knew that carrie grant
14:16
did it really yeah really that's right
14:18
yeah wow groucho marx did it as well did
14:20
he yeah when he was 78 this guy paul
14:23
krasner who's a he's a writer um says
14:26
that he did it with groucho marx and
14:28
weirdly i've spoken to a lot of people
14:30
who knew groucho marx who said that they
14:32
don't think it's true but this guy has a
14:34
really vivid account and he's remarks
14:37
turns out to be a collective
14:38
psychosis
14:39
[Laughter]
14:43
[Applause]
14:45
[Music]
14:47
okay time for our next fact and that is
14:49
andrew hunter murray so my fact this
14:51
week is that when it gets really cold
14:53
christmas trees can turn to glass
14:56
[ __ ]
14:59
that's true
15:02
we've been doing 90 episodes this is the
15:04
first time you decided to respond to a
15:06
fact in that way and it's the one of
15:07
mine i'm living it's the first time i've
15:09
thought of fact it's completely
15:10
ridiculous okay i will explain um so
15:14
lots of christmas trees as in um
15:16
coniferous trees evergreens you know
15:18
whether they're spruces or furs whatever
15:20
they are they live in forests where
15:21
temperatures get really really cold as
15:23
in minus 60 degrees sometimes so that's
15:26
a massive problem for organisms because
15:29
if you have cells and the water in your
15:31
cells freezes into ice crystals they can
15:33
burst through the walls of the cells and
15:35
cause massive damage to whatever to an
15:37
animal or to a tree or whatever it might
15:38
be so trees have this incredibly clever
15:41
thing they turn to glass and when i say
15:43
glass i don't mean
15:44
glasses in a glass of something like
15:46
silica which is what that's made of um
15:48
the molecules all freeze into this sort
15:50
of glassy state where they don't move
15:52
around yeah so it's a state of matter as
15:54
glass yeah exactly it's not quite a
15:56
liquid and not quite as solid yeah so
15:58
the cris the atoms can move around a
16:00
little bit but they they're not kind of
16:02
fluid like a liquid but they're not
16:04
really really stuck together like a
16:05
solid yeah so it's sort of preemptive
16:08
going into a frozen mode except without
16:10
that freezing without the ice crystals
16:11
but so afterwards it unglasses itself
16:14
yeah and becomes a normal tree again
16:15
yeah
16:17
yeah that's crazy it's pretty cool yeah
16:19
yeah that's amazing there are some
16:21
animals that do similar things aren't
16:22
there um well tardigrade which is have
16:25
you ever spoken about tardigrades on
16:27
this podcast sure enough i've actually
16:28
excelled ordinarily like one of our
16:30
favorite animals at qi aren't they um
16:32
these are little tiny things also called
16:35
water bears which can survive massive
16:37
heat really really cold temperatures
16:40
radiation they can survive all sorts
16:41
they can go into space and still live
16:44
and one way that they survive very cold
16:46
temperatures is they get rid of almost
16:48
all of the water in their cells and they
16:50
kind of turn their cells into an almost
16:52
kind of glassy state wow and this kind
16:55
of glassy state is something that hasn't
16:57
really been seen much in nature or
16:59
anywhere else and they think they might
17:00
be able to make new kinds of glass by
17:02
studying it wow
17:05
they are amazing tardigrades maybe
17:06
that's the fifth secret of how to live
17:08
for a really long time is no water
17:10
just dry yourself into a husk yeah um
17:13
have we ever talked about the frog
17:15
before who when it gets i think we have
17:16
on this podcast haven't we what kind of
17:18
frog is it when it gets really cold it
17:19
just freezes solid and you assume it's
17:21
dead because it can do that for a minute
17:22
frog yes yeah and then it can just
17:24
thought in something turns into like a
17:26
little frogsicle wow and it has
17:28
it has antifreeze in its blood and so it
17:31
stops its blood from freezing
17:33
really really really cold temperatures
17:35
there are some fish which have
17:36
antifreeze in their blood because
17:37
they're swimming in water which is
17:39
sub-zero temperatures is that right
17:42
because it and the water isn't frozen
17:43
because it's got salt in it i think
17:45
that's right and so if they're swimming
17:46
around in the arctic then that's how
17:48
they do that don't it's either
17:49
crocodiles or alligators
17:51
when it becomes uh to a point where a
17:54
river or lake or whatever is gonna
17:56
freeze over
17:57
they stick their head near the surface
17:59
and they let the uh they let it freeze
18:02
over their head
18:04
except for their nostrils which are
18:05
sticking out so that they can still
18:07
breathe and survive but they effectively
18:09
hibernate with a block of ice around
18:10
their head and their body just flowing
18:12
in the water below wow
18:14
have i made that up it does sound like a
18:16
made-up thing i really don't
18:18
really think it's true it might be true
18:20
if that is true that's incredible
18:22
and if it's not then that's not
18:24
surprising
18:25
you don't call [ __ ] on his stuff
18:28
she'd be saying it nonstop
18:31
i've only got so much breath
18:34
um in antarctica i was looking into
18:36
their christmas tree and
18:38
they obviously don't have a tree there
18:40
so they created a tree which is made out
18:42
of rubbish bits it's all iron bars and
18:44
so on so it's in the shape of a
18:46
christmas tree which looks really nice
18:48
and i started looking into christmas day
18:49
there generally things like they often
18:51
get quite drunk and they have a
18:53
challenge whereby they have to get as
18:54
many christmas hats onto penguins as
18:56
possible
18:57
yeah yeah that's what they get drunk on
18:59
eggnog and they the challenges you have
19:00
to using as many little christmas hats
19:02
get them onto as many penguins and the
19:04
most penguins you get them on you win
19:06
the competition right yeah and also they
19:09
don't have mistletoe there so what they
19:11
do instead is they hang a fish's head
19:14
up and you're meant to kiss under that
19:15
very romantic
19:17
image of a stinking rodding but
19:19
mistletoe um comes from the german for
19:21
dung stick so it's not that romantic in
19:23
itself that's james's opening line
19:25
whenever he catches anyone
19:27
well did you know that um
19:30
to kiss me under the dung stick
19:35
there was a thing um christmas trees
19:37
always used to catch on fire because
19:38
before electric lights you just stuck
19:41
candles on the ends of the branches and
19:42
obviously that's an enormous fire risk
19:44
so lots of people died in christmas tree
19:46
fires yeah but as a result loads of
19:49
people in the 19th century especially
19:51
patented fire extinguishing systems
19:53
which you can then attach to your tree
19:55
oh wow so there's a hose running all the
19:57
way up the trunk and you just sort of
19:58
secrete it up there and then the this
20:00
instead of a star at the top or the star
20:02
is actually a sprinkler in the shape of
20:03
a star so when the tree catches fire
20:06
it's just oh that's a great idea yeah
20:08
yeah that happened to my christmas tree
20:09
one year
20:10
really yeah we came out after we told
20:12
santa had just been and my grandfather
20:14
accidentally knocked a candle onto the
20:16
tree and the whole thing went up as we
20:18
came out to get our presents and oh my
20:21
gosh it was a hard moment
20:24
whoa
20:25
was it did it properly burn it
20:27
that would ruin christmas oh it did it
20:28
was yeah it was petrifying well that's
20:30
not petrifying that's a completely
20:31
different thing that happens
20:35
um here's something i i it's quite a
20:38
scary little image that i had never
20:40
heard of um
20:41
tarantulas live in christmas trees
20:43
oh yeah yeah
20:45
but not the big home alone guys yeah
20:48
it's the tiniest of all the tarantulas
20:50
and they're only a quarter of a
20:51
centimeter in length yeah so where is
20:53
that it's in siberia didn't they used to
20:55
um decorate trees in germanic countries
20:58
with little kind of spiders christmas
21:00
spiders today and spider webs in ukraine
21:03
i think they still do that do they yeah
21:05
christmas spider
21:07
yeah
21:08
not very festive one thing that you get
21:10
a lot in the newspapers every year is
21:12
this is the worst christmas tree in
21:14
britain they all love that story there's
21:17
a few um this year um there's one in
21:20
stockpot um where the locals have said
21:22
it's the worst christmas tree in britain
21:24
one resident says it's a disgusting tree
21:26
that looks like it was found in a tip
21:30
and then the other one is in kempston in
21:32
bedfordshire um which apparently is so
21:34
weedy it has to be propped up by a
21:36
lamppost
21:37
oh
21:38
but i just love these stories because
21:40
you just see them and they're just like
21:41
the weediest rubbishes
21:43
yeah but it's not as bad as one there's
21:45
one in neua brusque in russia and um
21:48
their locals have demanded that they
21:50
remove it because it has been nicknamed
21:53
the penis fair because it has an
21:55
extremely bulbous bottom and a
21:56
shaft-like top
21:59
one local said let's be honest it looks
22:02
more like a penis than a christmas tree
22:04
which i've seen it and i think that guy
22:06
needs to see a doctor
22:08
i call it my christmas treeness
22:16
[Laughter]
22:25
[Laughter]
22:30
fortunately it does have a sprinkler
22:31
system already
22:36
[Applause]
22:38
[Music]
22:40
okay time for a final fact of the show
22:42
and that is my fact my fact this week is
22:45
that one of the contenders for this
22:47
year's christmas charts is a prague rock
22:49
album by pope francis
22:53
have you listened to it i have i've
22:54
listened to the whole album it's weird
22:56
isn't it it's amazing the opening track
22:58
sounds like a pink floyd track yeah
23:01
it's got all these amazing noises is
23:02
that um a neuteo phobis gaudium magnum
23:06
yes that is yeah yeah um that means we
23:09
announce with great joy
23:12
or we announce with joy magnum i think
23:15
all right
23:16
certainly used an ice cream campaign
23:18
[Laughter]
23:20
but it's the words that you use when you
23:21
announce a new pope oh okay right that
23:23
word comes from so the uh the background
23:26
of this album is that they've taken
23:27
speeches that the pope has made over the
23:29
course of his uh tenure and he's uh been
23:32
it's usually you can hear the applause
23:34
of crowds when he starts speaking but
23:36
they've hired an incredible team to make
23:38
this prog rock meets just slash medal
23:41
it's it's an amazing album full of
23:43
incredible
23:45
metal
23:46
there's shredding on it there is
23:47
shredding guitar particularly if you
23:49
listen to the single that he released
23:51
which is the title of the album wake up
23:53
go go
23:54
forward that's the that's the title of
23:57
the single now check this out according
23:59
to a number of sources uh
24:02
this cannot be true but the title track
24:05
which has been released as a single has
24:06
been downloaded over a billion times
24:10
a billion well there are more than a
24:12
billion catholics in the world there i
24:14
looked into this and according to the
24:15
guinness world records the best-selling
24:17
single worldwide is white christmas by
24:19
bing crosby with 50 million copies oh
24:22
okay yeah
24:24
so 50 million to a billion is quite well
24:26
is the pope just is he just sitting
24:28
there in the vatican constantly
24:29
downloading
24:32
you got a billion downloads you could
24:33
probably afford to build another vatican
24:35
[Laughter]
24:37
like a really classy one this time
24:40
do you think it's cost that's stopping
24:41
them from building a second
24:46
um so
24:47
i uh read an article about a formula for
24:50
the ultimate christmas single oh yeah
24:51
it's obviously always a bit dubious and
24:53
it's from about 10 years ago it's from
24:54
2004 it's on the bbc
24:56
and i don't know how many of these boxes
24:59
the pope's album ticks okay but
25:01
apparently the recipe includes a
25:03
reference to father christmas sleigh
25:06
bells a children's choir and a charity
25:08
element
25:09
okay okay so charity element tick yeah
25:12
that's a charity yeah i'm sure okay well
25:14
also the song should include christmas
25:16
in the title wishes for peace on earth
25:18
it's probably got those and lots of
25:19
airplay at office parties
25:23
well at the qi christmas party i can
25:26
guarantee there's going to be pope
25:27
francis
25:28
we've downloaded it a billion times
25:32
a few times
25:33
you said that um he might have been on
25:35
you know itunes just constantly
25:37
downloading his song um he's never been
25:39
on the internet in his life no so um he
25:42
couldn't do that really um he does have
25:44
20 million twitter followers uh despite
25:47
never having been on the internet he's
25:49
got two accounts as well right one in
25:50
latin and one in english he might even
25:52
have a few more than that but yeah 20
25:54
million wow that's impressive for
25:56
someone who's never even turned up he's
25:58
never watched tv since 1990 after making
26:01
a promise to the virgin mary
26:03
so he wouldn't have seen loads of
26:04
episodes of catchphrase
26:06
that's terrible he's probably waiting
26:08
for the boxer
26:11
a few years ago didn't two minute
26:12
silence get into the top 20 into the
26:14
charts i think in 2010 um on
26:18
november the 11th the two-minute silence
26:20
was uh in the top 20. really really
26:23
singles yeah weird it was the royal
26:25
british legion um it was it was them in
26:27
particular being silent
26:29
there was those people in particular
26:30
being silent i mean we've got no
26:31
evidence it was then because it was just
26:32
silence but they promised us when we
26:34
downloaded the album
26:36
because that always puts me in mind of
26:38
the famous john cage four minutes 33
26:40
which everyone thinks is silence but
26:42
isn't really it's ambient noise
26:44
isn't it you always have to have an
26:45
orchestra there not playing and you need
26:48
an audience there and it's the kind of
26:50
little kind of cough and a little fart
26:52
and a little kind of
26:54
giggle that's that's never going into
26:56
concert with you
26:58
um speaking of weird singles that were
27:01
unexpected hits yeah um this the singing
27:04
dogs
27:05
which was released in the 1950s and i
27:08
think it reached number 22 in the
27:10
singles charts but it was really it sold
27:11
over a million copies in its first year
27:13
anyway so the idea came from this danish
27:16
recording engineer called carl weissman
27:18
and he was his job was actually
27:19
recording bird sounds and he kept
27:20
getting annoyed because dogs kept i
27:22
don't know why he was keeping dogs in
27:23
the studio but dogs kept on barking and
27:25
getting in the way of his recordings and
27:26
then he thought actually i could put
27:28
this to music and make them sing and if
27:31
you look up the singing dogs it was a
27:32
hit at the time and it's so good they
27:34
sing jingle bells there's five dogs they
27:36
were stars
27:39
i've heard it it's really good it's so
27:40
good i mean it's okay
27:42
i've only downloaded it 900 million
27:47
um this is completely off topic so yeah
27:49
i mentioned it later but just while
27:50
we're on christmas cause i'm gonna have
27:52
another year until i can mention this
27:54
yeah um i read an article last weekend
27:56
about a santa school that's being run
27:58
it's the world's largest santa school
28:00
okay it's called the international
28:02
university of santa claus
28:04
it's set in america there's a guy called
28:06
tim conahan who runs it and his the
28:10
curriculum includes wardrobe posing
28:12
techniques
28:14
answering difficult questions knowing
28:15
the current toys and your ho ho hos
28:18
[Laughter]
28:20
um and
28:21
if you do one course you get a bachelor
28:22
of santa clausology if you do two you
28:25
get a masters of santa clauseology and
28:26
if you do more and you do a dissertation
28:29
then you get your doctorate
28:31
you don't get a whole whole whole level
28:33
oh
28:35
any cracker manufacturers you can have
28:37
that one
28:40
yeah that's very cool has anyone heard
28:42
the 1980s album by anthony daniels who
28:46
played c-3po no no star wars christmas
28:49
album
28:50
uh it includes songs such as what can
28:52
you get a wookie for christmas when he
28:54
already owns a comb
28:56
that's a great title yeah and r2d2 we
28:59
wish you a merry christmas is another
29:01
one but this is a weird thing there is a
29:04
very famous um rock star and this album
29:07
was the first time he was on anything
29:09
oh can you guess who it is brian ferry
29:12
no um
29:14
ryan adams what year what year are we
29:15
talking uh 1980 1980 john bon jovi
29:19
correct no whoa what how did you get
29:22
that i don't know i just went for an 80s
29:24
yeah amazing the first his first ever
29:26
recording on anything was on this um
29:28
r2d2 c3po christmas album that's amazing
29:32
yeah and that springboarded his career
29:33
did it
29:36
he did because the actual the actors who
29:38
played r2d2 and cb3o hated each other
29:40
didn't they no yeah i think they really
29:42
hated each other and so they obviously
29:44
set that aside in order to so you know
29:46
when they're going
29:48
is that like swearing they actually the
29:51
beat beeps was just it was originally
29:52
normal language they just have to beep
29:54
over everything they said
29:57
do you know the first number one single
29:58
that was banned was it written was it
30:01
the blobby mr blobby christmas single
30:03
what do you mean band uh sorry do you
30:06
know the phone by the bbc
30:21
enough i'm not letting people listen to
30:22
this even though it's released in the
30:23
middle of the year i still think it
30:25
should have a few sleigh bells
30:28
um
30:29
but yeah and apparently the vatican
30:31
hated it it was denounced by the vatican
30:32
there were rumors at the time that the
30:33
pope had excommunicated uh people who
30:36
bought it everyone in italy who'd bought
30:38
the single because it was so rude and um
30:41
then i think it was jane birkin wasn't
30:43
it who sung it and she said that the
30:44
pope had been her greatest pr man
30:45
because obviously that made it super
30:47
popular yeah that's probably the best
30:48
thing that can ever happen to a song
30:49
yeah being banned by the pope yeah
30:51
that's amazing any word on whether the
30:53
pope likes no such thing as a fish
30:56
um just one more thing on pope francis
30:58
that i really like um have you guys
31:00
heard of the
31:01
politician bob brady in america
31:05
so um pope francis visited america and
31:08
he did a speech and while he was on
31:09
stage he drank from a glass of water and
31:13
put it back down and as the pope is
31:15
leaving bob brady jumped onto stage and
31:17
grabbed the glass of water and he
31:19
started taking photos of himself
31:21
drinking from the glass that the pope
31:22
had drunk from and he was really open
31:25
about it saying that he was going to
31:26
keep the holy water because he said this
31:28
is holy water
31:29
and that he was going to use it for the
31:31
blessing of his grandchildren right when
31:34
they were when they were born and people
31:36
pointed out to him that just because the
31:38
pope drank it uh it doesn't necessarily
31:40
mean that he's blessed the liquid so
31:41
it's not technically holy water so that
31:43
implies that every catholic church which
31:45
has holy water in the font of whatever
31:46
has had the pope come and it's lapid
31:49
it's all papal backwash
31:53
but yeah bob brady go online and look at
31:55
the photos they're hilarious and he's
31:57
just so he doesn't care that he does it
31:59
he's not embarrassed by it at all he
32:01
offers to pay for the glass he offered
32:02
to pay for the glass yeah he's wrote to
32:04
them said i'll obviously yeah but we
32:06
know the pope can pay for a class
32:07
because he's had a billion downloads of
32:08
this song
32:09
[Laughter]
32:10
they should call that scandal watergate
32:12
shouldn't they
32:15
another one for the cracker

00:32
seven days and in no particular order
00:35
here we go okay um i have a fact about
00:38
uh the silver age of comics who's that
00:40
from hey hello should we do a twitter
00:43
fact while we're waiting for the
00:44
microphone to get over uh so uh this was
00:47
sent into us by john winterholt there is
00:50
a chemical called arsol
00:53
nobody knows what it smells like yet
00:57
i tweeted him back to say is that true
00:59
and he said yeah i study [ __ ] for a
01:01
living and
01:04
apparently true he also he so then he
01:06
also told me that there's another one
01:07
called arse pain which is true as well
01:10
and he said there's interestingly
01:11
there's a mineral found uh near the town
01:13
of covington massachusetts and that's
01:16
been called coming tonight
01:19
there's one called um
01:21
well shite was welshite but it's named
01:23
after a guy called uh somebody welsh or
01:25
something welsh yeah um there's a
01:27
molecule called um i think it's nitrogen
01:30
triiodide it's one of the most crazy
01:32
molecules you can get for a molecule
01:34
it's pretty crazy
01:36
but apparently it will blow up if um a
01:39
mosquito lands on it yeah really yeah
01:42
it's the energy of a mosquito landing on
01:44
it will make it explode
01:45
is the mosquito all right
01:48
it's just a molecule isn't it it's
01:49
probably fine yeah and should we go to
01:51
the fact what's your name charlie hi
01:53
charlie what's your fact charlie uh this
01:55
is a range of comics in the late 50s 60s
01:58
comics with gorillas on the front sole
01:59
considered to be more than comics
02:01
without dc comics but gorillas on every
02:03
single copy even if no girl is inside
02:07
that's so good amazing pretty good
02:09
wow that's cool
02:15
so superman would just be tackling a
02:17
gorilla on the front and then it had no
02:19
relevance to the story um a comic with
02:22
superman and agree with sending him a
02:25
ticket or like a zoo ticket i think why
02:27
would a gorilla be selling a zoo ticket
02:30
it's them colluding in their own
02:31
imprisonment
02:36
do you know what gorilla's favorite
02:37
films are no no
02:40
this sounds like the start of a
02:41
challenge
02:43
um
02:44
now this was i read this this weekend in
02:47
the sunday times somewhere and it's by a
02:49
musician who's really famous by coming
02:51
but who it is because they don't know
02:51
anything about music but he's hung out
02:53
with people who've studied gorillas and
02:55
they gave them a bunch of films and they
02:57
worked out which ones the gorillas you
02:58
know like asked asked with their hands
03:00
to watch the most frequently and what do
03:02
you reckon the gorilla's favorite film
03:04
is planet of the apes very good no
03:06
planet of the apes yeah
03:08
really and then their second favorite
03:10
was a film about uh sasquatch a yessi um
03:13
so obviously they feel very close to
03:15
yetis maybe they are genetically somehow
03:16
related i think they think and the third
03:18
favorite was just done stand up
03:24
they didn't subject them to that james
03:26
you know
03:27
the rspca would get involved
03:32
i watched um i watched the mummy three
03:34
on the weekend there's a mummy three
03:36
there's a scene in it where there's just
03:38
so much chaos going on the terracotta
03:40
warriors have become alive there's this
03:42
old chinese uh group of skeletons that
03:44
have come back up it's jason and the
03:46
argonaut style and then suddenly these
03:48
two giant yetis come in and the good
03:50
guys go oh yetis and the yetis are like
03:52
we're good guys and they go great and
03:54
then everyone just accepts it
03:56
[Applause]
03:58
it's just fine we've got yeti allies now
04:01
who are
04:02
helping us do yetis in the myths about
04:04
yetis do they attack people
04:06
yeah yeah okay they can be kind as well
04:08
they uh there's
04:11
i regret asking my original question
04:14
there's a lady in bhutan who claims that
04:17
she lived and had children with yeti and
04:20
the yeti they had about six children and
04:23
then she said that she was going back to
04:25
society she wanted to bring the children
04:26
with them but the yeti said that's not
04:29
going to happen so they went to yeti
04:30
court and the yeti won custody of the
04:33
children and that's why she doesn't have
04:35
them
04:36
in bhutan this is this is a stretch of a
04:38
link but every government policy has to
04:41
justify itself according to its world
04:44
happiness index rating doesn't it
04:46
doesn't it gross national happiness yeah
04:48
so every time you make a policy you have
04:50
to say how it's going to affect the
04:51
gross national happiness it's the only
04:52
country where it's like made that put
04:53
that into policy
04:56
i have been to bhutan i remember i went
04:58
to the national um museum because i
05:00
wanted to see the world's biggest book
05:02
they claim to have the world's biggest
05:03
book and it's a book about bhutan how
05:06
convenient
05:08
and i'm i was in the museum and um there
05:11
was a they had a rat problem someone had
05:13
seen a rat but because they were it was
05:15
run by monks because it's quite a you
05:17
know a buddhist country um they weren't
05:20
allowed to hurt the rat in any way so
05:22
they weren't allowed to put poison down
05:23
or they weren't allowed to put traps
05:24
down or anything like that so all the
05:26
monks were just chasing this rabbit
05:30
wow
05:31
um what's the name of the very famous
05:32
gorilla who's um in we talked about it
05:36
coco do you know what coco's favorite
05:37
movie is i read this on the weekend
05:39
bizarrely okay so let's just say who
05:40
coco is yes so coco is a gorilla who
05:43
learns sign language i think right yeah
05:45
and learn more words in sign language
05:47
than anyone else
05:51
three hundred people just picked me up
05:52
about today um yeah and is often held up
05:55
as the fact that animals might be able
05:57
to learn language yeah so favorite movie
05:59
pretty woman
06:01
really oh no so aspirational yeah hold
06:05
by the way pretty woman the movie they
06:07
did a thing where they the hotel that it
06:10
was filmed in now offers a pretty woman
06:12
package so you can go which is the worst
06:15
message
06:16
[Music]
06:17
i don't think they thought that through
06:19
properly
06:20
who's it for
06:22
it's a millionaire
06:24
yeah it's for couples yeah
06:26
wow i've got a fact about movies um this
06:28
is a fact about the movie leon whose
06:30
facts is about leon whose fact is about
06:32
the film leon oh it's over there oh hey
06:34
over there if you put your hand up alex
06:35
will come and find you
06:37
in the meantime i've got a fact that
06:38
came from twitter
06:40
um and this is from someone called at
06:42
riptor
06:44
and the fact was that the 25th amendment
06:47
allows vice presidents to take over as
06:49
president when the president
06:50
incapacitated it's happened three times
06:53
and each time the president was having a
06:55
colonoscopy
06:59
are those the only three times
07:00
presidents have been incapacitated
07:01
because i know that they haven't been
07:03
shot
07:04
and killed
07:08
i'll keep going
07:10
uh no since the amendment was made
07:12
there's a thing about colonoscopies that
07:14
you can explode during a colonoscopy do
07:16
you know that what wow yeah because you
07:19
have a lot of gas buildup in your lower
07:21
intestines and um sometimes they'll use
07:24
like a cauterizing heat
07:26
thing to if you've got a cut they try
07:28
and kind of burn it and so that heat and
07:31
the gases can cause um people to
07:34
actually explode yeah right you would
07:36
have thought are they putting some kind
07:37
of safeguards in place to stop this
07:38
happening or is it just you know 50 50
07:41
you'll either explode or
07:44
that's kind of like what happens to
07:45
trees right when they get colonoscopies
07:49
what do you mean similar kind of you
07:51
know when trees are on fire then
07:53
sometimes it gets so hot and there's
07:54
buildup of gas inside them and they
07:55
explode there's really good videos of
07:57
trees exploding
07:58
when lightning hits a tree that can
08:00
explode because all the water turns
08:01
immediately to water vapor and lots of
08:03
it is uh near the middle touch oh it
08:04
just goes out it's cool
08:06
not for the tree it's bad for the tree
08:08
um do we have our leon fact yeah
08:11
okay so there's a scene in the movie
08:13
leon
08:14
where um there are loads of police cars
08:16
parked outside a building and while they
08:18
were filming that scene a man who had
08:20
just robbed a shop ran onto the movie
08:22
set thought it was the real police and
08:24
handed himself
08:30
[Applause]
08:32
such amazing sorry what's your name
08:35
susie susie that's an amazing bag how
08:38
long did they let the gerard continue
08:41
but if they were method actors they
08:42
probably would have right
08:44
taken them to the station then they
08:45
would have gotten trouble themselves
08:47
gary oldman's going to be arresting you
08:48
today very exciting
08:51
someone actually tweeted in this is from
08:53
twitter earlier that uh gary newman is
08:55
actually three weeks younger than gary
08:56
oldman unfortunately
08:59
[Laughter]
09:03
um didn't think that's right about
09:04
police
09:06
in ancient egypt the police the head of
09:08
the police was called the chief of the
09:09
hitters that's like we've talked on the
09:11
podcast about the world's oldest parking
09:13
fine issued by traffic wardens um which
09:16
uh was
09:18
uh to be decapitated i believe oh no no
09:22
no no yeah it was being impaled it was
09:24
to be impaled wasn't it yeah on a spike
09:26
for crossing on the king's land that was
09:28
when um yeah the king owned all of the
09:31
roads so i think it was quite hard to
09:32
get around yeah and the first the first
09:34
ever british uh parking ticket that was
09:36
given was uh accidentally given to a
09:39
doctor who was making an emergency call
09:41
to a house and so they had to
09:43
override the parking so the first
09:44
parking ticket was a cock-up and they
09:46
had to undo it and i think the first
09:48
american one was overwritten as well
09:50
well the most american one was a guy who
09:51
said i literally just went into the shop
09:52
for five minutes and i've come back and
09:54
my tickets here and he you know appealed
09:56
and got it overridden has any parking
09:58
ticket ever been successful
10:00
all the ones that i've ever got happen
10:02
have i ever told you about the guy in
10:04
london and i think it was the 60s or
10:06
might be early 70s who electrocuted his
10:08
car so that when traffic wardens tried
10:11
to put a ticket on them
10:12
they got electrocuted
10:15
he was in like the newspapers and stuff
10:17
he became really famous when he was
10:19
arrested right
10:20
yeah well he was arrested but they um
10:22
they let him off in the end because he'd
10:24
become such a kind of kind of caused
10:26
celebrity surely electrocuting a
10:28
policeman is a bigger crime than parking
10:30
on a double yellow
10:31
yeah sorry like not electrocuted because
10:33
the word electrocuting means killing by
10:35
electricity
10:36
he electrified them let's say with like
10:38
a little bit of a shot um they should
10:40
have charged him
10:42
[Applause]
10:49
that's he's like um angle grinder man in
10:51
kent
10:52
who was that superhero he called himself
10:54
the a real-life superhero and he went
10:56
around um with his angle grinder
10:58
removing clamps from cars that had been
11:00
clamped no one knew who he was for a
11:02
long time until he did an interview with
11:03
the newspaper and then people did
11:05
but yeah you know at the end of iron man
11:07
when he says i'm iron man it's like was
11:09
he like
11:10
aaron grander man and they went
11:13
i mean he could pronounce it so that
11:14
helped
11:17
i thought i escaped that
11:19
i genuinely as well just ran with it and
11:21
where i'm just going to mush it up so
11:23
hard
11:24
i was here like i'm guaranteed and
11:25
there's
11:27
shall we move on to another fact yeah
11:29
yeah let's move on to our next fact okay
11:31
so this is about a ghost army in world
11:34
war ii all right so while we're waiting
11:37
for the mic to get over here's another
11:38
twitter one this is from matthew oglesby
11:41
the new organist of leeds cathedral is
11:44
david pipe
11:46
that's quite nice very good i'm a
11:49
massive fan of nominative determinism
11:51
yeah
11:52
did you meet the guy who coined the term
11:54
yeah we met him very briefly
12:00
yeah northern determinism
12:04
no what was the you remember you you
12:06
found the ultimate one which was to do
12:08
with oh um henry head yeah yeah so um
12:11
there was a neuroscientist called henry
12:13
head
12:14
uh and he discovered this thing called
12:16
head zones you don't have one in your
12:19
head but you do have one in the head of
12:20
your
12:21
genitals if you're a man
12:23
but he was the head of a journal called
12:25
brain
12:27
and
12:28
when he left as head of the journal
12:29
brain he was taken over by a guy called
12:32
brain
12:34
so head was the head of brain until he
12:36
wasn't the head of brain anymore and he
12:37
was taken over as the head of brain by
12:39
brain who became the head of brain so
12:42
good yeah that's the ultimate yeah
12:44
[Applause]
12:47
i mean no one knew what was going on
12:49
in that organization i saw one the other
12:51
day actually it was um i tweeted about
12:53
it let me think it was um a guy who'd
12:54
written a book about uh swearing and he
12:58
was called say goddamn
13:00
that's good yeah it's good isn't it
13:02
s-a-i his first name
13:04
that's nice someone sent me one on
13:05
twitter the other day which was a
13:06
hurdler whose surname is stumbleover
13:09
oh yeah
13:11
i think he actually famously fell over
13:15
yeah
13:19
i think didn't she stumble over a hurdle
13:21
in quite an important amendment
13:24
yeah okay should we go on to the first
13:26
say your name and your fact please all
13:28
right uh i'm nora um so my fact was that
13:31
there was a goose army in the second
13:33
world war where the allies used rubber
13:35
inflatable tanks and recorded troop
13:37
sounds to trick the german army into
13:40
thinking the enemy was there but there's
13:41
a ghost army
13:43
they called them ghost army because they
13:45
didn't actually exist don't get excited
13:47
then
13:49
it's not like the end of indiana jones
13:51
[Laughter]
13:53
i like the idea of having inflatable
13:56
tanks because it means you blow up your
13:57
own tanks
13:59
[Laughter]
14:05
do you know where the word tank comes
14:06
from no no so tank was originally a code
14:09
word it was never intended to be what
14:10
tanks were called um and it was i think
14:13
churchill was at the head of the
14:15
organization which was you know
14:17
pioneering tank making and they were
14:18
called something like land ships it was
14:21
called like the land ships organization
14:22
or something like that in the first
14:24
world war when they were developing them
14:25
um and they just decided to call them
14:27
tanks as a code word because they were
14:28
going to send them into russia disguised
14:29
as water tanks and first of all they
14:31
wanted to call them they called them w's
14:33
they called them water compartments at
14:35
first but because war officers tended to
14:36
abbreviate things we kept mixing them up
14:38
people kept going and urinating on the
14:41
military vehicles so they said we can't
14:43
call them wc's well they call them tanks
14:45
because they wanted the russians to
14:46
think they were tanks of water but yeah
14:48
the russians were on the line
14:50
first world war i know i i said russians
14:51
and i hoped again like down there
14:55
it's just a little thing like which side
14:57
we were fighting
15:00
people made these mistakes all the time
15:04
okay i think we're gonna have to keep
15:05
moving on because we're we're short of
15:07
time aren't we so um yeah okay uh who is
15:10
jennifer matthews
15:12
uh jennifer matthews is over here
15:14
so um parrotfish wear pajamas
15:18
protective pajamas at night time and
15:20
then they eat them in the morning
15:23
wow
15:24
yes i don't see anything special about
15:26
that i mean
15:29
facts
15:32
no that's amazing
15:34
so they secrete a mucus that has a hole
15:37
in the front and the hole in the back so
15:38
that water can flow through
15:41
and uh the mucus is apparently meant to
15:44
stop predators from spelling them
15:46
and it means that they're protected
15:48
overnight whilst they sleep but it's a
15:49
vital source of protein so they eat it
15:52
in the morning oh my god nice
15:54
yeah
15:57
it's
16:00
it's not the sexiest pajamas in the
16:03
world isn't it
16:04
when you say i'm just gonna go slip into
16:06
something
16:08
it's just gonna slip into something more
16:10
mucousy
16:14
how do you like your
16:15
[Laughter]
16:20
breakfast and parrotfish they're the
16:22
guys who they um they make sand as well
16:25
do they yeah they poop island yeah
16:29
yep bit by bit
16:31
well
16:32
for an average parrotfish they uh poop
16:35
275 grams per day
16:38
but the biggest parrotfish um can make
16:41
90 kilograms
16:43
kilograms a day i don't actually know if
16:45
it's a day it might be per year but the
16:47
biggest
16:55
how much are you doing it's either twice
16:58
a day or twice a year
17:00
how big an island have you produced
17:04
um but yeah that's the um it's this
17:06
white kind of white sand that they get
17:08
in the caribbean and stuff don't they
17:10
yeah so they eat coral um and when they
17:12
eat coral they eat the the tissue off
17:14
the coral and then they uh digest the
17:17
calcium carbonate skeleton and poop the
17:19
sand and then uh but entire islands in
17:21
the caribbean have been made up by this
17:23
one wow so you could basically lie
17:25
in a pile of
17:27
sand i did that anyway
17:30
how do you know so much about parrotfish
17:32
i'm a marine biologist are you hey
17:34
nice
17:39
thanks
17:41
you don't get a wolf whistle for that in
17:42
any way
17:46
should we uh should we move on yeah
17:47
let's keep going yeah let's keep going
17:49
okay so so this is about uh the new
17:52
tallest building in london whose is that
17:54
uh
17:55
andy a twitter one actually this is
17:57
really similar to the the thing we just
17:59
had the fringe limbed tree frog fringe
18:01
limbed tree frog parents grow extra
18:03
layers of skin to feed their tadpoles
18:08
and this is i like this sandwich because
18:10
it's reminded me of my favorite fact at
18:12
the moment which is that
18:14
um breast milk mother's breast milk is
18:16
made from uh asses when uh when you have
18:20
a baby um
18:22
and you stop producing breast milk it's
18:23
got fat cells in it and the fat cells
18:25
that are taken literally from the
18:26
mother's bottom first is where they go
18:28
from wow yeah
18:30
no one else hasn't said that there's a
18:32
lot of spiders who will eat their mother
18:35
aren't they oh there's at least a few of
18:36
them really so they'll they'll give
18:39
birth to the live spiders inside them
18:41
and they'll eat their way out
18:42
[Music]
18:45
spiders
18:48
okay what's your name and what is your
18:50
fact please so my name is bopinda and my
18:53
fact is that the new tallest building in
18:56
london
18:57
is going to be called undershaft
18:59
amazing
19:00
nice it's a really immature fact i can't
19:03
believe it
19:05
why is it so why is it being called that
19:08
i don't know i just read it on the
19:09
guardian and laughed a lot yeah
19:13
that's literally the extent that i do my
19:14
research as well so don't worry about it
19:17
actually i was reading the other day
19:19
it's a building we've mentioned on the
19:20
podcast before but london a building in
19:22
london got voted the ugliest or the most
19:24
horrible building around and it's the
19:26
walkie-talkie uh and it was cited for
19:28
being so bad because it keeps blowing
19:30
people over and melting cars is
19:34
the angle of the building has this
19:36
magnifying on it that it's just melting
19:38
cars and the wind that is trapping is
19:40
literally blowing people onto the street
19:42
and the people are furious the architect
19:44
who made it has designed another
19:45
building in america which also has
19:47
melted cars
19:50
and he's not learned from his mistakes
19:52
he actually puts that on his cv now
19:56
have you got a car you need melted
19:59
just get me to design a multi-million
20:01
dollar building for you
20:05
alex was actually telling me earlier
20:06
that the shard in london goes down as
20:10
deep deeper than nelson's column
20:12
does it i thought you're going to say it
20:14
goes down deeper than it goes up
20:18
i thought he was going to say that as
20:19
well i was quite disappointed something
20:21
that does do that is the angel of the
20:22
north that goes really it's pretty much
20:24
exactly deeper than the shard
20:26
and on the other side it's devil shaped
20:28
isn't it
20:30
[Music]
20:31
yeah
20:33
messed up
20:37
shall we move on oh wait can i just say
20:38
because i find this really interesting
20:39
and i think i've never been allowed to
20:41
say on the podcast before but we only
20:42
recently discovered how tall nelson's
20:45
column was
20:46
so it's been up since well since nelson
20:48
so 200 years and they just measured it a
20:50
couple of years ago and they realized i
20:52
think it's four meters higher than we
20:54
thought or
20:55
maybe it's four feet
20:57
isn't that weird we've never measured
20:58
nelson's color yeah that's really big
21:01
you know there are loads of nelson's
21:02
columns all over the place
21:04
i mean unlike millions
21:07
there are i think a good dozen of them
21:08
all over the uk and there's one in
21:10
norfolk which is where he was from i
21:12
think and it's um it's just got an urn
21:15
at the top of it not nelson so there you
21:17
go but it is nelson's column nelson used
21:20
to i don't know if we ever put i tried
21:22
to get this on the podcast i don't know
21:23
forever made on but nelson used to have
21:25
a little hat for his eye
21:27
he just had a tiny hat for his eye and
21:30
no one talks about it and they should
21:32
because he literally tried to get that
21:34
on every single week for about two
21:36
months because it was like you know when
21:37
you see american movies where they're
21:38
like doing accounts and they had that
21:40
sort of tennis hat that had the the
21:42
green that you could see through nelson
21:43
had that on his eye this little green
21:45
thing so that he could because his eye
21:47
got too much sun and he was like i want
21:48
to get less sun so they created a little
21:50
hat i have a fact about nelson okay well
21:52
do you have it uh it's from brian
21:55
brian with a wife you there hey we'll go
21:58
for a twitter fact first okay we'll go
21:59
over twitter and so this was sent to me
22:01
by someone called timworth89
22:04
and he said that in 1774 one newspaper
22:08
estimated that out of the 872
22:12
564 married couples in england
22:15
only nine were entirely happy
22:22
you could read that as a whole nine
22:25
happy
22:26
he sent me a clipping an image of the
22:29
clipping as well it's so good um they
22:31
had a breakdown of the whole 872
22:34
thousand
22:35
and it's like uh 1300 the whites had
22:38
eloped um 2300 the husband had run away
22:42
uh there's about 19 000 that were in a
22:44
state of open wall
22:49
16 000 had a lot of inward hatred about
22:53
each other not that inward if they're
22:55
telling the interviewer
22:56
and 51 couples were living in a state of
22:59
indifferent hate
23:02
but yeah hang on indifferent hate
23:05
yeah that doesn't make any sense what
23:08
period was this uh this was in 1774.
23:11
this is you know between i it's it's for
23:14
about 200 years but between about 1675
23:17
and 1850
23:19
only about 370 couples in england got
23:22
divorced and
23:24
everyone needed an act of parliament
23:25
exactly so every how exciting is that
23:27
it's almost worth getting divorced every
23:29
time you got divorced they had to debate
23:30
it in parliament
23:32
i think they look good together
23:38
that was hardly hillary
23:39
[Laughter]
23:42
shall we move on to the sorry
23:45
sorry yeah so nelson uh the in the
23:47
ability office in nelson used to go for
23:50
you know reports and stuff and he had a
23:52
small mahogany box to stand on because
23:55
firstly he was quite short and secondly
23:57
the admirals sat on a raised platform to
24:00
make them higher than everybody that
24:02
would come before them to speak so they
24:04
maintained their authority and yeah he
24:06
was the only person that ever had that
24:08
concession wow and i got to stand on
24:11
that box but i had to take my boots off
24:12
first
24:18
did he have to take his boots off first
24:20
no because
24:21
yeah because i think that that was just
24:23
kind of negated the concession wouldn't
24:25
it really yeah yeah indeed stand up take
24:27
your boots off oh same height yeah
24:30
i think jillian anderson used to have to
24:32
do that in the x-files dana scully she
24:34
used to have to stand on a box when they
24:35
were filming she's uh quite a bit
24:37
smaller than david duchovny and so for
24:39
scenes where they were standing chatting
24:41
she would stand on a box and yeah
24:43
that happens a lot in movies i think oh
24:46
charles and lady dye apparently did this
24:48
as well oh that i i have a twitter fact
24:50
about charles and lady die actually uh
24:52
so when we lead into that uh when prince
24:55
charles married lady diana the tv cables
24:57
put in place for the wedding were run by
24:59
a ferret
25:02
and i googled it and it's true what yeah
25:04
what do you mean
25:06
i don't mean he was physically with like
25:08
a thingamajigger all right camera two
25:10
let's do this all right
25:12
got a three yeah it was it was uh they
25:15
had to get cables i guess into me i'm
25:18
guessing westminster abbey they have to
25:20
go into small little holes and this is
25:21
you tie it to a ferret and they run
25:23
through and they no way yeah i think
25:25
british airspace have used it for for
25:28
some kind of area
25:29
i think for building airplanes for some
25:31
reason that's what i thought that's what
25:33
i was going to say but i thought it
25:34
sounded so ridiculous
25:36
ferrets build aeroplanes um but i think
25:39
they actually cancelled that eventually
25:41
because they kept chewing through the
25:42
wires so i think they ended up being
25:44
quite unreliable all right i seem to
25:46
remember someone sent me a tweet um at
25:49
bangai shot you sent me a tweet uh and
25:51
it's almost the same as this it's like
25:52
there was a ferret called misty who ran
25:55
cabling for the u.s space command for
25:57
the y2k center and her fee was a
25:59
strawberry pop-tart
26:02
who negotiated that because that was
26:04
that
26:05
that sounds like she actually asked for
26:06
that yeah it reminds me this of there's
26:09
a bridge over the niagara river near the
26:12
niagara falls and the problem with
26:14
bridges is how do you get the first kind
26:17
of thing over so once you've got a bit
26:20
of string over there then you can pull
26:21
something over and then you can pull
26:22
something bigger over and bigger over
26:24
and then you eventually have a bridge
26:25
but if it's a really big
26:27
crevice
26:28
you use a bird well it wasn't a bird but
26:31
it's close
26:32
frisbee
26:34
no it was a kite a kite oh nice so they
26:37
flew a kite up and then it kind of went
26:39
over and then someone was on the other
26:40
side and they could grab the kite and
26:42
then you had a string over and then they
26:44
could attach a bit of wire onto that and
26:45
pull it across and then a bit of bigger
26:47
wire and then a tiny bit of wood and
26:49
then a little bit bigger bit of wood and
26:50
then
26:55
you can't get a frisbee across niagara
26:56
falls i think can you this is true so
26:59
you know
27:00
how good are you at frisbee you can get
27:02
it across niagara falls you can make it
27:04
hover in the air while it deposits
27:06
building materials
27:09
it's incredible
27:11
you know you guys know the aerobee super
27:13
disc yeah
27:15
it's a great frisbee guys it's one it's
27:18
the one that's completely hollow it's
27:19
plastic and it's got a tough frame in
27:21
the middle so it keeps rigidity and
27:23
stability but it's rubber on the outside
27:24
so it doesn't hurt your hands
27:27
anyway this week's podcast is brought to
27:29
you
27:29
[Music]
27:31
it's the bee's knees and they can get
27:33
you there they've thrown one across
27:35
niagara falls when have you ever had a
27:37
friend to throw a crispy stick
27:39
it take it does take a while to play
27:41
when i'm playing with the chromie
27:42
supernas because it goes so far
27:45
have you ever thought about getting a
27:46
boomerang
27:52
okay uh let's move on with another fact
27:54
who has a fact that's about penises and
27:57
the london underground
27:59
james you're gonna need to narrow it
28:00
down a bit
28:03
hi my name's tom
28:04
so when the new headquarters of the
28:06
london underground building was opened
28:07
in 1929
28:10
uh the statue of the front of a naked
28:12
boy was so controversial and there was
28:14
such public outcry that the sculptor had
28:16
to reduce the size of his penis by one
28:18
and a half inches
28:19
[Laughter]
28:21
wow
28:22
did we ask from what
28:25
[Laughter]
28:27
12 is too much 10 and a half will be
28:29
fine
28:31
so is it the the shorter the penis that
28:34
lower the rating of the film
28:36
it was the film it was the statue yeah
28:38
i'm sorry i was extrapolating but if
28:40
that made it less obscene in the statue
28:43
it becomes less obscene the smaller the
28:44
penis i mean
28:47
yeah
28:48
are you sensing an opening for some
28:50
smallly endowed people
28:56
[Laughter]
29:00
what was that do you know anymore about
29:02
what why why they had a statue of a
29:04
naked boy in the first place yeah yeah
29:06
kind of so it was by jacob epstein who
29:08
is this avant-garde quite brutalist
29:10
sculptor and it was one of his first
29:12
major commissions uh he has this quite
29:14
long history of creating uh sculptures
29:16
like he has one on um what's now
29:18
zimbabwe house on the strand and that's
29:20
also been massively defaced because it
29:22
was just full of naked people and people
29:24
didn't like that in edwardian britain
29:26
but this one it was a kind of a
29:27
compromise because there was public
29:28
outcry and the head of the the tube at
29:30
the time um offered his resignation to
29:34
keep the statue it was that big a deal
29:36
and they wanted to keep their head their
29:38
ceo of the london underground but as a
29:40
compromise they said okay we'll just
29:41
trim the penis a little bit
29:44
is that what happened to all ancient
29:45
statues like did david have a massive
29:47
[ __ ] originally and then they thought it
29:49
was more civilized yeah small weapons
29:52
they thought it was better to be small
29:53
because if it was too big you would lose
29:55
heat and lose vigor
30:01
but this website had a picture of what
30:03
had been done to the statue and
30:05
underneath it just said
30:07
yeah this has actually happened and you
30:08
thought the cuts to london underground
30:10
today were controversial
30:13
that's very good hey uh we should we
30:16
should wrap up soon so maybe let's just
30:18
do a couple more uh let's why we do a
30:19
twitter one each that we all like uh
30:22
i'll i'll start with mine uh this was
30:24
sent in by jonathan warlock claire danes
30:27
and all her movies were banned from the
30:28
philippines after she bad mouthed it in
30:31
an interview so they just said no more
30:33
claire danes movies
30:34
yeah i'm kind of using this as an excuse
30:36
though to talk about the philippines
30:38
because um my dad's a hairdresser and um
30:41
he also he likes to sing bg's covers and
30:44
uh he's got a really nice voice and on
30:46
the equivalent of jonathan ross there
30:48
they don't really have many people there
30:50
to go on the show so he often got asked
30:52
to go on and sing bg's covers on on this
30:54
equivalent of jonathan ross called the
30:56
johnny litton show and she was on it one
30:58
day and imelda marcos saw it and she's
31:00
called him up and like sent a letter
31:02
saying i'd like to invite you to sing
31:05
karaoke with me uh once a week and you
31:08
can't really say no to someone like
31:10
imelda marcos so he had to do it this is
31:12
the fact that i learnt off him through
31:14
the back of doing that is that she said
31:16
to him one day when they were mid bg's
31:17
song roger i get so tired about people
31:20
talking about my having the largest shoe
31:22
collection all the time no one talks
31:24
about the fact that i have the largest
31:25
collection of spoons
31:28
and she apparently likes to brag that
31:30
she has the largest collection of
31:31
silverware in the world and no one talks
31:33
about it all the shoes oh yeah the
31:35
[ __ ] shoes no one talks to her about
31:37
the silverware uh so anna final fact uh
31:41
yeah so my favorite fact on twitter
31:42
actually was that the uh this is
31:44
from at gulbatasaurus and it was that
31:48
the korean term for uh grinding in a
31:50
club is booby booby
31:54
apparently yes
31:57
uh andy what do you got um i really like
32:00
the fact um this is exactly how it was
32:03
it was worded as from uh mina kozluka
32:06
ottoman emperor abdul habit made it
32:09
illegal to use the words sibling star
32:12
bedbug and nose and then in brackets he
32:15
had a weird nose
32:20
and james okay um this fact came from id
32:25
ktidkt
32:27
and it is that
32:29
in the olden days to send paper money
32:31
through the post people used to tear it
32:33
in two pieces and post the halves
32:35
separately
32:38
i don't even know if it's true but i
32:39
just really like the ingenious idea of
32:41
doing that i'm trying to present a
32:43
stellar taped up 10 pound note to the
32:45
news agents and they didn't like it
32:47
there was a guy in china um he didn't
32:49
trust banks and so he buried all of his
32:52
money on the ground and then it all got
32:54
eaten by worms
32:56
oh wow
32:57
and he managed to kind of save about a
33:00
third of it that was all in pieces and
33:01
took it to the bank in a big bag of soil
33:05
and then said is there anything you can
33:07
do with this and they managed to like
33:08
retrieve about a third of his money so
33:10
the very thing that he didn't trust
33:12
ended up saving some of his cash
33:14
but he's convinced that the worms were
33:15
working for the banks though
33:19
i i read ages ago that all astronauts
33:21
when they initially were going to the
33:23
moon that they were all given half notes
33:26
of one dollar note uh in america
33:29
american money they would get the half
33:30
and they would have to present it back
33:32
to nasa when they arrived and so they
33:35
could put the two halves together so
33:36
that they could check whether or not
33:38
aliens had cloned them and come back
33:41
the idea that the aliens would not have
33:43
the technology to just keep hold of a
33:45
half gun
33:47
we can clone a human but that half
33:49
dollar bill there's no way of doing that
33:52
all right let's wrap it up on that so um
33:56
all right that's it that's all of your
33:58
facts thank you so much for listening if
33:59
you want to get in contact with us about
34:01
the things that were said don't get in
34:03
contact with the people who said them
34:04
they're all on twitter uh you can reach
34:06
them at their twitter handles or you can
34:08
track down the people who are in this
34:10
room we do have a list of their names
34:11
and we will make it public
34:13
uh and uh we'll see you again next week
34:15
with another episode goodbye
34:17

00:11
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:14
no such thing as a fish coming to you
00:16
from the q i elves in covent garden my
00:19
name is anna duchinsky i'm sitting here
00:20
with andy murray alex bell and james
00:23
harkin and once again we have gathered
00:26
around the microphones with our four
00:27
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:29
in no particular order here they are
00:33
and that's starting with you andy
00:36
my fact this week is that czech deer
00:39
still avoid crossing the iron curtain
00:41
between germany and the czech republic
00:44
so there used to be the iron curtain
00:46
which was a very very long um
00:49
electrified fence in between the two
00:51
countries during the cold war and at the
00:53
end of the cold war the czech and the
00:55
german authorities they established a
00:56
nature reserve going across the country
00:58
they thought this is a really nice idea
01:00
we'll have this huge habitat all sorts
01:01
of species will have lots of room to
01:03
play in and um there'll be more animals
01:06
as a result and it'll all be good for
01:07
biodiversity and it turns out 20 years
01:09
later that deer on the czech side just
01:11
will not cross that border so what
01:12
you're saying is that old deer are
01:14
communist
01:15
well these are red deer very nicely
01:19
um and the headline from the wall street
01:21
journal when this study was reported was
01:24
deep in the forest bambi remains the
01:25
cold war's last prisoner
01:28
which is a good headline
01:30
there's a strip um through germany which
01:32
was called the death strip i think
01:35
because it was that strip it was sort of
01:36
like a five kilometer area between east
01:38
and west germany where you weren't
01:39
allowed to cross and it was cordoned off
01:41
with lots of barbed wire and walls and
01:43
you know men with guns and high towers
01:45
and stuff and because no one touched it
01:47
no humans touched it for about 50 years
01:49
it's now got like more it's the most
01:51
biodiverse area in germany it's got more
01:53
wildlife than you're in germany is that
01:55
supposedly true of chernobyl as well it
01:57
is yes isn't it lust leading to that odd
01:59
joke why shouldn't you
02:01
go wildlife spotting in ukraine why
02:04
because um chernobyl's biodiversity is
02:06
very high and we can't run the risk of
02:09
damaging it all such a double fall-off
02:13
just going back to the iron curtain and
02:15
the burning did you know maybe everyone
02:16
knows this but the berlin wall came down
02:18
by accident kind of yeah sort of yeah
02:22
yeah so they were there were
02:23
negotiations and there was going to be a
02:24
change of how uh easily people were
02:26
allowed to cross and um they had a live
02:29
television press conference which was a
02:30
bit of a rarity then it was a bit of a
02:32
novelty um and the guy announcing it
02:35
mixed his words up got a bit carried
02:36
away said these are all there's lots of
02:38
changes happening they're all happening
02:39
immediately and then people masked
02:41
outside the wall yeah there's footage of
02:43
him when he's asked directly so when are
02:45
people going to be able to cross freely
02:47
between east and west berlin and he sort
02:49
of grapples with a bit of a press
02:50
release and looks at the back of it and
02:51
goes um immediately yeah
02:54
and then they go for it and i read a
02:56
theory that uh the checkpoint guard who
02:59
was in charge that day was a guy called
03:01
harold yeager and he sort of caved in to
03:04
all these protesters who came flooding
03:06
towards him saying let us through and
03:08
one of the ideas of why he would cave in
03:10
is that he'd he was waiting on the
03:12
results of a cancer test i read in one
03:14
article and he was nervous and worried
03:16
about that and he just sort of thought
03:17
i'll bugger this i'm you know i'll let
03:19
let them get through he was fine by the
03:21
way this needs to be a movie that's
03:22
amazing yeah just on that there was a
03:25
thing in the i think it was the second
03:26
world war where um
03:28
shortly after like the horrible defeat
03:30
at dunkirk and you know things were
03:32
looking really really bad for britain uh
03:34
i think it was about this time and there
03:35
was a sort of offer from germany or
03:38
offer of a negotiated settlement um
03:41
and the bbc news reader who was
03:43
announcing the terms of this said well
03:44
obviously we're not going to accept that
03:46
way before anyone in government revived
03:50
and
03:51
and you know true enough they did
03:52
decline but he said afterwards yeah i
03:54
realized that was a bit that was a bit
03:56
strongly biased
03:59
um yeah do you know who invented the
04:01
phrase iron curtain
04:03
winston churchill everyone says it was a
04:05
church everyone says it in that stupid
04:08
advice
04:09
it's almost as if they know it's the
04:10
wrong answer
04:12
goebbels used it before churchill did uh
04:14
and before that it was used by an author
04:16
called ethel snowden in 1920
04:18
but goebbels wrote it way before
04:20
churchill did and he wrote an article
04:21
called the year 2000 where he was
04:23
predicting exactly what was going to
04:25
happen in the year 2000
04:26
and he said that our children's children
04:28
will also have had children and the
04:30
events of this war will have sunk into
04:32
myth the first bit of that prediction
04:33
actually isn't that impressive
04:35
no it's true
04:36
but he also said one will fly from
04:38
berlin to paris for breakfast in 15
04:40
minutes it takes longer than that though
04:41
doesn't it yeah yeah
04:43
i mean even getting through security
04:44
takes longer than that
04:46
yeah so goebbels was wrong
04:48
about loads of things
04:52
sorry
04:53
so there are two species of millipede in
04:55
tasmania that never meet each other oh
04:57
yeah okay
04:59
there's like an invisible line that they
05:01
never cross but the interesting thing
05:02
about it is it doesn't follow any kind
05:04
of rivers or hills or natural contours
05:07
it's just like an invisible line and no
05:09
one knows why
05:10
bob mesiboth who's a millipede
05:12
specialist um he said it has got nothing
05:14
to do with the environment it's like a
05:16
political thing between these two
05:18
species oh wow could it be is it a leg
05:21
dispute it feels like it's going to be a
05:22
leg dispute that's just stereotyping you
05:25
think that everything that millipedes do
05:26
is to do with their legs yeah 98 legs
05:28
good 99 legs bad
05:31
there might be
05:32
i mean you might the thing is you're so
05:34
long as a millipede that you might
05:36
end up in enemy territory without
05:37
realizing it
05:39
what you're back off yeah yeah if you're
05:41
like backing up somewhere yeah
05:44
can millipedes walk backwards if they
05:45
want to i think they probably can i
05:48
think they probably can't why really why
05:50
wouldn't they be able to any more than
05:51
anyone else i think because it's a
05:53
really tough job to coordinate that many
05:55
legs surely okay okay okay if there are
05:58
any millipede experts listening if you
06:00
could um tweet me at egg shapes and andy
06:03
at andrew hunter m and let us know which
06:05
of us is correct here i think there's a
06:07
pint riding on it yeah or any millipedes
06:10
obviously wouldn't want to exclude the
06:11
millipedes themselves from tweeting in
06:14
um i think these the tasmanian ones have
06:16
exclaves as well so you know you get
06:18
little exclaves in of like someone
06:20
else's nation in another country and
06:22
there are a couple of instances where
06:24
the millipedes that belong to one side
06:25
have ended up in a little blob on the
06:27
other side and they think maybe they
06:28
were taken over accidentally on a truck
06:30
and then but they still aren't mingling
06:32
maybe they're embassies
06:34
oh yeah the winnipeg embassy that's what
06:37
it is yeah so this is quite cool i think
06:40
it's called parapatric speciation
06:42
and it's where i think there are like
06:45
two populations of an animal that don't
06:47
mingle and usually it's because like
06:48
there's a ditch in between them or
06:50
there's some kind of
06:51
topographical or geographical reason for
06:53
it or millipede racism or millipede
06:56
racism
06:58
[Laughter]
07:01
but yeah and it means that populations
07:02
tend not to mingle with each other at
07:03
all they'll rub up against each other
07:05
they'll occasionally have a chat but
07:06
they'll only really mate with the people
07:07
on their side and eventually that
07:09
creates and that means they split up
07:10
into two different species and it also
07:12
happens with um velvet walking worms in
07:15
tasmania that's another mystery so maybe
07:17
tasmanians are just unbelievably
07:18
antisocial sorry this is a walking worm
07:21
yeah yeah that sounds amazing that's
07:22
right a velvet walking worm i didn't
07:24
look into the explanation for the name
07:26
what i imagine is that the worm it
07:28
doesn't have any legs but it kind of
07:30
squeezes itself up into two halves and
07:32
walks like a pair of legs
07:36
let's just go on believing it's that and
07:38
never google it anyone nobody google it
07:41
another thing is that there is um a
07:43
species of shark called mako sharks and
07:46
there's a line underneath the sea where
07:48
if you catch a shark from one side of it
07:50
then it'll be male and if you catch one
07:52
from the other side of it it'll always
07:53
be female and no one knows why that is
07:56
either do they only have sex on either
07:57
side of the line
08:00
they must just come together for one
08:02
part of the year i guess speaking
08:03
speaking of sex on borders i think it's
08:05
in switzerland
08:07
that's the last time you're invited to
08:09
that bookshop
08:11
um there's a i think i think it's in
08:12
switzerland on the border of switzerland
08:14
and maybe france or another country that
08:16
there's a hotel with a penthouse in it
08:18
and the penthouse bed is on the border
08:21
so oh cool so you can take off two
08:23
countries in one go i don't know if you
08:24
need passports are you ticking off all
08:26
the countries yeah and it's so
08:27
irritating because i don't enjoy sex so
08:29
the idea of being able to take off
08:31
multiple countries in one attempt it's a
08:34
dream come true
08:36
um dear
08:37
[Laughter]
08:41
deer aren't always herbivores
08:43
really they've been caught eating birds
08:46
out straight out of the nest and other
08:47
meats and stuff like that and so
08:49
apparently look there are several
08:50
species that will or quite a lot of
08:51
species that will eat meat if it's
08:53
available oh really and on a related
08:55
note cows i've i've watched a video
08:58
today of a cow eating a live chicken
08:59
just off the ground like you're a sick
09:01
puppy alex
09:02
the internet is a dark place and also
09:05
deer don't have gallbladders that's the
09:06
only other thing i have about them how
09:08
do they blood of their goal
09:11
[Laughter]
09:18
okay time for fact number two and that
09:21
is james's facts my fact this week is
09:24
that if every car in monaco decided to
09:27
go for a drive at the same time they
09:29
wouldn't fit on the roads
09:32
how much time have you spent working
09:33
that out not so much so this comes from
09:36
the um economist world in figures i
09:39
think it's called which is a yearly um
09:41
book that has loads of statistics in it
09:43
and the length of the monaco road system
09:46
if you divide it by the number of cars
09:48
is less than the average length of a car
09:51
according to my calculations uh which if
09:53
they're wrong please don't write it
09:56
but i reckon that those each car had
09:58
about you know just around two meters of
10:01
space and definitely cars are longer
10:02
than that of an average yeah wow should
10:04
we do a test and ask everyone in monaco
10:06
to get in their cars and go out onto the
10:07
roads now if you're listening to prove
10:10
this fact because this is a podcast
10:11
people listen at different times oh yeah
10:13
no you're right we need to arrange that
10:15
and we need the entire population of
10:16
monaco to be listeners i'm fairly sure
10:18
they are i think that's all about
10:20
obviously also forgetting that's an
10:21
incredibly irresponsible thing to do as
10:23
well we'll cause multiple deaths look no
10:24
one said this is a perfect plan guys
10:27
um so does monaco have more cars per
10:29
capita than anywhere else in the world i
10:31
think it it does and if not it's in the
10:34
top two i really
10:36
i read that they've got and these
10:37
figures are a couple years old 771 cars
10:40
per thousand citizens yeah it's a bit
10:42
more than that now okay so that sounds
10:45
like a lot it's a lot considering how
10:47
many citizens there are how few citizens
10:49
well and and it's the second most
10:51
populated country on earth i think i'm
10:53
sorry
10:55
it's china
10:57
it's amazing considering monaco is only
11:00
two square kilometers but
11:02
it's got just shy of a billion people
11:03
living in it
11:05
order order sorry alex um
11:08
because apparently monaco is also the
11:10
second most densely populated country on
11:12
earth after
11:13
some place in china i think macau
11:16
could be yeah anyway it's the second
11:17
most densely populated country on earth
11:19
wow and there's more cars than any other
11:21
people in earth as well and one whole
11:23
third of them are millionaires
11:26
yeah 30 of the population of monaco 300
11:29
million
11:30
[Laughter]
11:35
no it's true there are 30 000 people
11:37
living in two square kilometers so it is
11:39
it's incredibly densely populated it
11:41
really skews the the statistics doesn't
11:43
it because they have like 100 literacy
11:45
rates and like the the life expectancy
11:48
is like 98 or something ridiculous yeah
11:50
in fact it's also the oldest uh country
11:53
in terms of the proportion of the
11:55
population who are aged over 65. so
11:57
there it's
11:58
27.8 percent of the population so in the
12:01
uk it's about 17 18
12:04
um so as a result of that um in 2009
12:07
monaco spent 1.2 percent of its gdp on
12:10
education
12:11
essentially there are no children
12:14
when you were saying the size of it is
12:16
two square kilometers
12:17
i like to say that it's almost exactly
12:19
the same size as chipping sodbury
12:22
quarry because when i googled things
12:25
that were two square kilometers in size
12:26
that was the first thing
12:28
that's very cool i think your google
12:30
results may be personalized
12:33
there's another thing which is two
12:34
square kilometers in size um which is
12:38
the largest building in the world which
12:40
is in china this single shopping center
12:43
um is 1.76 million square meters
12:47
and that is the the total area of monaco
12:49
basically wow because they say that a
12:52
lot of the biggest buildings are
12:53
aircraft hangars aren't they
12:55
oh yeah it's amazing seeing aircraft
12:58
factories and how big they are as well
13:00
because those are the same as you know
13:02
like really really massive aircraft
13:03
hangars you know i was watching a video
13:05
of this is really off topic but i was
13:07
watching a video of a german factory
13:09
that makes houses basically like entire
13:11
houses at a flat pack and the whole
13:13
factory is sort of this big white
13:14
sterile place and nothing touches the
13:16
floor everything is suspended from the
13:18
ceiling wow why is that
13:20
um just in the interest of kind of um
13:22
tidiness and cleanliness and you know
13:24
you can't lose anything everything sort
13:26
of everything all the bits are always
13:27
kind of hanging and going from rails and
13:28
stuff oh that is really i've got i've
13:30
got some diy to do this weekend at my
13:32
place
13:35
is um is that why they call it an
13:36
aircraft hangar because they hang things
13:38
no it's hangar isn't it yeah isn't it
13:41
what on earth is that that's not a word
13:43
no but it's like a coat hanger but it's
13:45
not a coat hanger i actually have a coat
13:47
hanger which is for all my coats
13:50
i've just got so many millions of coats
13:56
because you're such a loser
14:02
actually speaking of planes um so your
14:04
fact is about all the cars not fishing
14:05
on the road is the same true for all the
14:08
planes fitting in the sky
14:10
yes
14:11
no the opposite i know what you're gonna
14:13
say all the planes fitting on the ground
14:14
yeah i have heard that that that's why
14:16
there's always planes in the air because
14:18
they wouldn't fit all fit in the
14:20
airports and they used to say during the
14:22
millennium when the millennium was
14:23
coming everyone said oh gosh what are we
14:24
going to do we're going to have to
14:25
ground all the planes but they won't fit
14:26
in the airports but i've slightly looked
14:28
into it and it's definitely not true i
14:30
think the only thing is they wouldn't
14:31
all be able to fit in an airport whilst
14:33
being connected to an airport so
14:34
passengers could board them because i
14:36
mean airports are huge airplanes only
14:38
take up about a 20th of them the rest is
14:40
just tarmac
14:41
um so i think they could all fit i mean
14:43
again if you're a pilot or a millipede
14:44
do write in if you think that's not
14:46
right
14:48
it would be an act of confidence to
14:50
build in deliberate undercapacity in all
14:52
the airports in the world like ryanair
14:55
booking more people onto a flight than
14:56
actually
14:57
some people won't turn up i think they
14:58
probably built the airports and then
15:00
made more planes
15:01
[Laughter]
15:03
rather than thought well this is the
15:04
maximum number of planes we're ever
15:06
going to build
15:07
now let's start on the airport
15:10
so your fact is about um lots of people
15:12
going out and doing something at the
15:13
same time yes it is um so
15:16
i was looking at a couple of things all
15:18
humans could do at the same time that
15:19
might make a a big difference to the
15:21
world
15:21
okay so carton driver magazine worked
15:24
out in the course of a really quite long
15:26
article a lot of maths um that if
15:29
everyone in the world got in their cars
15:31
at once and put their foot on the
15:33
accelerator all at once pointing in the
15:35
same direction then the opposing force
15:38
that that would create from the earth
15:40
would cause the rotation of the earth to
15:42
speed up by naught point naught naught
15:44
naught naught naught n naught not one
15:46
miles per hour which means you make the
15:48
day longer so you get there faster yeah
15:50
it's the perfect way to stop yourself
15:51
but the traffic would be really bad
15:52
because everyone is out on the road so
15:54
that's a good good point yeah it's a
15:55
flawed plan again
15:57
so monaco is famous for its grand prix
16:00
and this fact is about monaco and cars
16:02
uh actually the second ever grand prix
16:05
was held in monaco
16:06
um the the race was marred after a large
16:09
pileup on the first lap when an enormous
16:12
wave from the harbour flooded the course
16:14
oh my god i don't know is that amazing
16:17
so were they all just going and then
16:18
they all just left there covered in
16:20
seaweed that would be amazing i have a
16:22
mermaid and a squid in the car next to
16:24
them yeah it's very like wacky races
16:26
isn't it
16:27
um was that the one so there was a guy
16:29
called william grover williams who was
16:31
the winner of the first monaco grand
16:32
prix was it 1929
16:34
or anyway i think the first monaco grand
16:36
prix was in 1929 and the winner was this
16:38
guy called william grover williams and
16:40
um he went on to become a spy because i
16:43
think he was employed for the french
16:45
resistance in world war ii as a driver
16:47
and it turned out he had quite a lot of
16:48
other talents what was his name william
16:50
grover williams it feels like he's a spy
16:53
and they've gone what's your name and he
16:54
goes william
16:57
williams
16:58
it's what it sounds also it scans
17:00
exactly the same as bond james bond so
17:02
to be fair
17:03
you know the name's william grover
17:05
williams
17:06
[Laughter]
17:09
anyway apparently he so he was allegedly
17:11
the nazis claimed captured and executed
17:14
but there were a lot of sightings of him
17:15
afterwards and rumor had it that he
17:17
became a grosser in surrey his name's
17:19
william grosser williams
17:23
just going back to the monaco grand prix
17:25
in 2004 um when ocean's 12 came out
17:29
they did a publicity stunt where the
17:31
jaguar cars in the race were fitted with
17:34
a new nose cone each of which had a
17:36
diamond worth in excess of three hundred
17:39
thousand dollars inside the nose cone
17:42
um during the first lap jaguar driver
17:44
christian klein crashed his diamond
17:46
encrusted car
17:48
um they weren't allowed to go straight
17:50
to kind of sort out the car because they
17:52
had to do it after the race finished and
17:54
by the time they got there they couldn't
17:55
find the diamond
17:57
and no one knows where the diamond is to
17:59
this day i bet one person
18:01
[Laughter]
18:04
[Applause]
18:08
[Music]
18:09
okay time for fact number three and that
18:11
is my fact my fact this week is that the
18:13
town of centralia in pennsylvania has
18:16
been on fire since 1962. so
18:19
people aren't entirely sure how the fire
18:21
started but it's thought that um people
18:23
were burning trash so there's just a
18:25
peep of heap of trash or garbage um in
18:28
centralia and they set fire to it and
18:31
the thing about centralia is that it had
18:33
a huge network of mines sort of
18:35
underneath it and largely towards the
18:37
outskirts of it and the fire kind of
18:39
fell down into one of the mines and
18:41
they're coal mines and so obviously coal
18:43
sets fire quite easily pretty quite well
18:46
what i've heard yeah
18:47
and so the coal just caught fire and
18:49
it's been going ever since and they keep
18:51
trying to put it out or they kept trying
18:52
to put it out up until the 80s and then
18:54
they just gave up
18:55
and yeah it used to have a population of
18:58
over a thousand and now its population
19:00
is 11 i think oh i've heard seven has it
19:02
gone down in 2010 there were tens
19:05
sometimes somebody moved there
19:08
come to centralia it's on fire
19:13
it's an incredible story it's so weird
19:15
and it's not unusual these things across
19:18
america there are hundreds of or across
19:20
the world in fact so i think there are
19:21
over 200 other mine fires in america
19:24
um there are thousands in china where
19:26
there are lots of coal mines obviously
19:28
apparently in total these coal fires
19:30
account for three percent of the world's
19:32
co2 emissions
19:34
is insane and so they're not all people
19:36
chucking stuff down i think sometimes
19:38
it's natural and there are all sorts of
19:39
other occurrences of underground fires
19:41
um but mainly coal produced at co2 three
19:43
percent i read that the ones in china
19:45
alone are one percent of the world's co2
19:48
yeah wow a couple years ago the chinese
19:50
government said that they'd been putting
19:52
them out and they were just lying and
19:54
all these journalists went around saying
19:55
i can still see the fire down there
19:59
but the main one is the one in australia
20:01
you guys must have all seen that one
20:02
right yeah it's the biggest burning
20:04
mountain which has been going for five
20:05
thousand five hundred years yes
20:08
do you think you can blame that on us
20:09
that wasn't trash burning no well i read
20:12
i read about the ex possible
20:13
explanations for burning mountain and
20:15
apparently um scientists think it may
20:17
have been caused by a lightning strike
20:19
or spontaneous combustion which is very
20:21
much science speak for we don't know
20:24
um also in pennsylvania and um texas and
20:27
some other places you can get flammable
20:29
water so petrol
20:32
yeah i want me some of that flammable
20:35
water for my car
20:38
um this water it can even be drinking
20:40
water that's just got high levels of
20:42
methane trapped inside it um and if you
20:43
put a match to it it will go
20:45
in flames a bit and if you've got sort
20:47
of level water you can sort of set fire
20:49
to the surface a bit like when you set
20:50
fire to brandy on your christmas pudding
20:52
and there are videos online you can
20:53
watch this woman just lighting setting
20:56
fire to the water coming out of her
20:57
kitchen and taps
20:58
them on stuff on the internet yeah
21:02
though because surely if it if the fire
21:04
travels along the pipe
21:06
it never really catches that much
21:07
because there's not enough methane in
21:09
the water
21:10
as well so oh yeah true
21:12
here's the thing about coal fires when
21:14
the titanic set sail out of southampton
21:17
she was on fire in the coal bunker
21:19
because that was what the titanic's fuel
21:21
was a huge huge bunks of coal there was
21:23
a fire in there which had been burning
21:25
possibly since the second of april which
21:27
was eight days before
21:29
um a fire wasn't supposed to be burning
21:31
that wasn't being used to fuel the
21:33
exactly yeah yeah just in the coal
21:35
bunkers there was a fire happening and
21:36
the crew took a day to put it out i
21:38
can't remember they didn't spot it for a
21:39
week the whole sinking thing is starting
21:40
to make sense it was very slap
21:44
maybe what they were thinking is what we
21:46
need as an enormous amount of very very
21:48
cold water
21:50
be careful what you wish for frank
21:52
[Laughter]
21:54
fires are really important in
21:56
nature aren't they especially in america
21:59
some of their big trees like the
22:00
sequoias they rely on forest fires to
22:03
kind of keep them healthy and keep them
22:04
regrowing um but because in america uh
22:08
and everywhere really they have this
22:10
kind of anti-forest fire thing which is
22:12
essentially to stop people from throwing
22:14
cigarette butts around but actually kind
22:16
of says that all fire is bad whenever
22:19
there's a fire they try and put it out
22:20
really really quickly which actually can
22:22
be quite bad for the ecosystem because
22:24
you do need these fires for things like
22:26
sequoias to grow yeah you do because
22:28
they have uh it's pine cones isn't it
22:30
there are certain pine cones which are
22:31
held together really tightly by resin
22:32
that relies on fire to get hot enough
22:34
that it the resin melts and it seeds i'm
22:37
not saying we should set fire to every
22:38
forest but you know the odd little fire
22:40
is quite important the occasional tree
22:42
wouldn't hurt guys other forests where
22:44
they have managed fires sometimes they
22:46
have them burn sometimes it's amazing
22:49
that that they need fires the idea that
22:50
there's a type of pine cone that has
22:52
fire as part of its it incredible yeah
22:54
but there are controlled fires you see
22:55
them a lot i can't remember where i
22:57
think you see them in in spain but i
22:58
think it's often to prevent other fires
23:00
from actually happening is to preempt
23:01
the fire they don't show that fire
23:04
it is literally fighting fire with fire
23:07
i've got one more thing about fire which
23:08
is the record for the longest distance
23:11
run while on fire
23:14
which is 200 meters wow which is pretty
23:16
good
23:17
how on fire was this person at the
23:19
beginning he is so on fire i mean he's
23:22
really really really aflame by the end
23:24
of it it's just his back which is on
23:26
fire because i think a lot of it is put
23:28
out over the course of the run but he's
23:29
an austrian stuntman called joe turtling
23:33
and he already had the record for the
23:35
longest time on fire and then he broke
23:37
this one
23:38
and then they said what are you gonna do
23:40
next and he said well i've got three
23:41
more records to break which is the
23:43
furthest distance being pulled by a
23:45
horse while on fire
23:47
and then the furthest distance being
23:48
pulled by a quad bike while on fire and
23:51
then a small motor vehicle while on fire
23:53
so he's found his knees take some time
23:55
off get married
23:55
[Laughter]
23:59
maybe retire do some gardening while on
24:01
fire
24:03
[Applause]
24:06
okay time for our final facts and that
24:10
is alex
24:12
my fact this week is that the first
24:14
recorded traffic casualty was a roman
24:16
pig who was run over by a chariot
24:18
carrying an ornamental phallus
24:22
okay let's start with the chariot why
24:24
was it carrying a massive phallus well
24:26
um because it was
24:28
probably part of the dionysiak festival
24:30
which was basically just this big
24:32
festival where they had loads of
24:34
phalluses it was all to do with kind of
24:35
fertility and generally being a bit
24:37
raucous so so we're sure it wasn't a
24:39
metaphor and that it wasn't just being
24:40
driven by the roman piers morgan
24:42
[Laughter]
24:44
this fact is from uh the pig stelia
24:46
vadessa which is basically um a
24:48
headstone a tombstone um which has a
24:50
little poem on it in greek it's roman
24:51
but the poems written in greek um and
24:53
also an engraving a picture of the pig
24:55
being run over by a cart which has a
24:57
huge dick on it and it's basically a
24:59
like a sort of satirical slightly funny
25:01
headstone because it's it's eulogizing a
25:03
pig rather than a person um but the pig
25:06
was supposedly on his way on the the v
25:08
ignatia which is the road he was on um
25:10
and was kind of all very excited about
25:11
having a great life and then got run
25:13
over by by a chariot it's very sad rough
25:16
and pigs are were symbols of fertility i
25:19
think as well
25:21
at the time
25:22
everything was a symbol of fertility
25:23
yeah
25:24
uh ultimate ancient greece i think
25:26
ancient greeks swore oaths over the
25:29
testicles of pigs uh because i don't
25:31
know why they would do that actually
25:33
just because it's a symbol of fertility
25:36
yeah is that right they always say that
25:38
the word testimony comes from putting
25:40
your hands over your genitals which i'm
25:41
pretty sure isn't true yeah anything um
25:43
but it'd be nice if instead it was the
25:45
pig testicles where it came from it
25:47
would it's not true either is it but it
25:49
would be nice i was kind of just looking
25:51
at generally roman pigs and what they
25:54
got up to um there's accounts of the
25:56
magarians apparently dipping pigs in oil
25:58
and setting fire to them and then
26:00
driving them towards elephants and then
26:02
the elephants would trample them and get
26:03
very scared and trample everyone and
26:04
there would be general chaos i was going
26:05
to ask about that because i remember
26:07
half remember reading
26:09
a thing about setting fire to pigs and
26:11
thinking they were dragons or something
26:13
because they're screaming and there was
26:14
fire and stuff like that i think it's
26:16
the noise that made them so scary
26:18
definitely and then the enemy elephants
26:20
trample their own people to death don't
26:22
they have the elephants at the front of
26:24
your army is that the idea so when they
26:25
see the pigs coming they turn around
26:28
the enemy army yeah
26:30
this is something really really 100
26:32
completely not related at all
26:35
but i was reading this yesterday in
26:36
covent garden and around here they had
26:39
some riots when they changed the prices
26:41
of
26:42
theaters and they're called the op riots
26:44
and people shouted up up and up meant
26:46
old price it could have been op or up
26:49
but one of the things that they did was
26:51
as soon as a play had started everyone
26:53
would turn their backs to their play and
26:55
then start doing these chants and stuff
26:57
like this and another thing apparently
26:58
they did was kind of prod pigs to make
27:01
them squeal at like inopportune times to
27:03
put off the actors
27:05
i just like the idea of i don't know
27:07
kind of sneaking a pig into the theater
27:09
do you dress it up as like a wife
27:12
i like the idea that it wouldn't be
27:14
distracting enough for an actor if just
27:16
a person in the audience started
27:18
shrieking have to go to the trouble of
27:20
smuggling a pig in
27:22
someone else who prodded pigs was
27:24
uh louis the 11th i think when
27:28
apparently when he was depressed he
27:29
liked to get pigs dressed up and have
27:31
them poked so that they danced for him
27:33
and he constantly kept with him a
27:35
dancing troop of pigs to entertain him
27:37
is that louis the 11th king of france
27:39
yes okay cool just checking yes i think
27:42
there's such a thing as too much power
27:44
you're doing that for entertainment yeah
27:45
you'd think you would sit back at one
27:47
point and go oh my gosh what have i
27:48
become what am i doing with my life but
27:50
on the other hand look at these great
27:52
pigs
27:53
um you know we've talked about cat
27:55
pianos on qi um so you have like 12
27:58
different cats and they all make a
27:59
different tone and you press a key and
28:02
it hits the cat and they squeal at a
28:04
different tone and it was invented by a
28:06
guy called anastasius creature yes
28:09
um there is also a pigeonino uh there
28:13
was a paganino
28:14
which is the pig equivalent oh i thought
28:16
it was a sandwich with a pig in it
28:18
but just one sandwich
28:21
it wasn't it was a it was a piano with a
28:23
pig in it uh it was a musical instrument
28:25
i think this might have been conceived
28:27
by louis x as well of france because he
28:30
liked the idea of torturing pigs for his
28:31
own entertainment and the idea was
28:33
conceived i'm not sure if they ever made
28:34
one but he challenged someone to make
28:37
one and the idea is that yeah you pull a
28:38
high load of pigs in a piano and then
28:40
you bash them with keys which is a
28:42
pretty big piano yeah it's a grand
28:45
i mean it depends on the size of the
28:46
keyboard i suppose if it's an 88 key
28:47
piano then yeah massively does it and
28:49
does it hit them or does it pull their
28:51
tails uh i just make them squeal however
28:54
way you want to make them squeal is the
28:55
idea i don't know you could do a number
28:57
of things i guess pig olympics
28:59
yeah there's a pig olympics it's um
29:01
organized by the sport pig federation
29:03
and uh there's pig running pig swimming
29:05
pig hurdles pig jumping big hurdles big
29:07
football i'd pay to watch pig hurdles
29:09
yeah yeah no it's um just you know pigs
29:11
jumping over little hurdles i think none
29:13
of these sports you watch them and it's
29:14
actually just pigs running around in a
29:16
thing
29:17
the football works but they cover the
29:18
football and fish oil and so they run
29:20
around i've seen pigs playing football
29:22
are you not supposed to give pigs balls
29:24
and stuff to play with because they are
29:26
they get bored of the watch yes this is
29:28
the law of the eu law you have to give
29:30
the farmers have to stimulate pig okay
29:33
farmers have to give pigs um stimulation
29:35
yeah um
29:36
i've done a bit of research on penis
29:38
festivals of course you have um to go on
29:41
from ornamental palaces um so there are
29:45
some which still exist all over the
29:46
world today
29:48
where's the closest one to here do you
29:49
think oh the closest one to here is
29:52
[Laughter]
29:55
i think that's in greece okay in a place
29:58
called tiernavos but in the japanese
30:00
city of kawasaki they have an annual
30:03
festival of the steel phallus
30:05
and they parade an enormous pink statue
30:07
of a penis through the streets and you
30:09
can ride a battering ram which is shaped
30:11
like a penis you can buy sweets which
30:13
are shaped like penises right you can
30:15
dress as penises you could just take any
30:17
normal activity and replace the main
30:19
noun with a penis
30:21
you could dress his penis while on fire
30:25
also the massive effigy that they carry
30:27
through the streets is called elizabeth
30:29
for no discernible reason
30:30
[Laughter]
30:32
the in 2003 uh cabinet magazine held the
30:35
world's most phallic building
30:36
competition
30:38
winner was the
30:39
cilantro tower in michigan which is
30:41
nicknamed the brick dick a lot of
30:42
contenders for that prize like every
30:44
skyscraper yeah so just about phallic
30:47
looking buildings do you all remember
30:49
seeing that picture on google earth of a
30:52
church that looked like a penis no um it
30:54
was in dixon illinois and it kind of was
30:56
it was oh well yeah it kind of did the
30:59
rounds a few uh years ago and it really
31:01
it does you know you can see where
31:03
they're coming from really um
31:05
but a spokesman for the church said the
31:07
church was not designed to be seen from
31:09
above
31:11
and hang on when they say the building
31:13
wasn't designed to be seen from above
31:14
all buildings have architectural plans
31:21
one more thing on penises um i found a
31:23
cabaret event that was held in march of
31:25
this year
31:27
which was specifically for men with
31:29
small penises
31:31
it was established by a fellow called
31:33
ant smith
31:34
who says he has a small penis he'll be
31:36
very glad you named checks
31:39
but he he was in all the papers at the
31:41
time i mean he was trying to publicize
31:43
this he was trying to get the word out
31:44
there saying this is something that
31:46
really worries a lot of men and just
31:47
come to terms with it and it was to help
31:49
men come to terms with it and the entry
31:51
fee was that you had to pay 50p per inch
31:55
of declared penis
31:57
that's really good i'm glad he's doing
31:59
that yeah and it is kind of ridiculous
32:00
that we make fun of that and you know
32:02
keep on stoking this ridiculous fire i
32:04
think we're celebrating it small penises
32:07
well this kind of event yeah yeah
32:09
yeah i think we're all saying well done
32:10
and smith yeah um definitely but if i
32:13
got along i would have had to pay six
32:14
quid
32:14
[Laughter]
32:17
no i'd have paid one pound fifty
32:21
we'll just round it down
32:22
[Laughter]
32:25

hello and welcome to another episode of
00:58
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
01:00
coming to you from the qi offices in
01:02
covent garden my name is dan schreiber
01:04
i'm sitting here with andy murray james
01:06
harkin and anna chazinski and once again
01:08
we've gathered around the microphones
01:10
this time with our four favorite winter
01:12
facts for our winter special as it's
01:14
really cold and in no particular order
01:17
here we go starting with you anna
01:19
chazynski
01:20
my fact this week is that socrates had a
01:23
spirit who spoke to him through the
01:25
medium of sneezing and this is one of
01:27
the great thinkers of western
01:28
civilization just to be clear he was
01:30
guided by sneezes
01:32
aristotle wrote about sneezing as well
01:34
did he yeah so he said that sneezing was
01:37
of divine origin or he said that that
01:39
was believed at the time
01:40
so coughing wasn't and if your nose was
01:43
running that didn't mean anything but he
01:45
said
01:46
why is it that we think sneezing is
01:47
divine is it because it arises from the
01:49
most divine part of us the head from
01:51
where reasoning comes um but there's
01:53
there's one other thing we know about
01:54
aristotle as well which is that he was
01:57
one of the people who when they look at
01:58
a bright light they sneeze oh did they
02:00
yeah
02:02
weirdos photic sneezing and it only
02:03
affects between one and three and one in
02:05
ten people but we know that he was one
02:07
of them because he said why does this
02:08
happen
02:09
how have we not managed to pin that down
02:11
to a more precise statistic how hard is
02:14
it to interview a hundred people and
02:15
find out if it's one in three or one
02:17
i'll tell you why it's weird because
02:18
people like me who don't have this until
02:21
they meet someone who has it think that
02:22
it's completely made up you think how is
02:25
that even possible yeah and then people
02:27
who have it think that everyone has it
02:29
i've found in the past i'm sure that's
02:31
not i thought i've had it because i have
02:33
it yeah yeah i don't believe any i don't
02:35
believe it's possible i need some i need
02:37
to pee when i am around books
02:40
is that a thing as well that's why
02:41
you're banned from foils
02:43
no that is a thing is that a thing is it
02:45
not a japanese
02:47
thing about um there's a word which
02:49
means the impulsion that you want to
02:51
defecate in a life it's a murico aoki
02:53
phenomenon that's right that's what it's
02:55
called and it's named after the only
02:57
ever sufferer
03:01
but the rumor has loads of books in it
03:02
down this must be a nightmare for you
03:04
she's constantly on edge
03:06
the cleaners of this office have a rough
03:08
time at the weekend
03:11
there's a wiki page of what to say if
03:13
people sneeze around the world
03:16
in albanian you say the albanian word
03:18
for health it's quite similar around the
03:20
world quite a lot of people say for
03:22
health or or or god bless you in amharic
03:25
they say may god forgive you
03:26
in azeri they say be healthy
03:29
and in the rithangu language of
03:31
australia they say class bin kuruwan
03:34
which means you have released nose water
03:40
i found that page as well
03:42
and the filipino response to it almost
03:44
all of them are you know god bless you
03:46
may god forgive you god have mercy on
03:47
you or whatever the filipino response is
03:49
to say naligo echo er
03:51
which means hey i took a birth
03:55
what
03:56
to say i took a bath in your mucus i
03:58
took a bath no i think it's i took a
03:59
bath and now you sneezed
04:02
and the response from the sneezer is who
04:04
didn't take a bus
04:08
or maybe it's who didn't take a bath
04:10
yeah i'm not sure i think that sounds
04:12
like um you know when if someone sneezes
04:14
on you and we used to say as kids was uh
04:17
i asked for the news not the weather oh
04:19
nice that sounds similar to that like
04:21
it's uh yeah yeah
04:23
um just on sneezing yeah dogs sneeze do
04:27
they yeah and uh what's interesting is
04:30
they do it when they encounter another
04:32
dog but they actively sneeze so they
04:34
sort of fake sneeze in order to show
04:37
that they're not aggressive to say that
04:39
they're they just want to hang
04:41
really yeah so it's a it's a it's a sort
04:43
of showing that they're friends i found
04:45
this on canineuniversity.com
04:47
the only university run by dogs for dogs
04:52
um sponges sneeze
04:56
some of them have like little chimneys
04:58
which they can expel stuff out of and if
05:00
they get something stuck in their bodies
05:02
then they can fire it out with a bit of
05:03
a kind of puff of air is that what like
05:05
a blowhole is for a whale um
05:09
they're just sneezing out their back no
05:11
it's a blowhole is like them breathing
05:14
ah but whales do they thought these yeah
05:16
they do have mucus yeah sometimes i
05:18
thought they actually expel
05:20
so like and for example isn't that how
05:22
they now find out whether a whale is ill
05:25
they'll have a sort of a drone
05:27
helicopter go over to catch snot so they
05:29
must be
05:30
rocketing mucus out of their blow holes
05:32
yeah but in the same way that you're
05:33
rocketing mucus out of your mouth all
05:35
the time yeah
05:40
i think a lot of the things dancers are
05:41
very sensible jake
05:45
but in your breath you'll have tiny
05:46
particles of like mucous or
05:49
whatever in the same way that they would
05:51
i guess so they're not trying to if they
05:52
have well flu maybe then it would be it
05:55
would be more mucusy i guess which whale
05:57
flu is a thing
05:59
yeah theoretically could pass over to
06:01
really no yeah i read the other day that
06:04
there was a whale who died because he
06:05
got a fish stuck in his blowhole oh no
06:08
[Music]
06:11
it sounds like a horrible euphemism
06:15
that sounds like you've gone to the
06:16
hospital with a hoover attached to your
06:18
genitals
06:21
just swam in there i was asleep
06:24
so this fish has been dead for three
06:25
days
06:30
um sneezing
06:32
socrates
06:34
yeah i should say that uh it's very hard
06:36
to know what's true and what's not about
06:37
socrates and this is an account by
06:39
plutarch uh which is a couple of
06:41
centuries later um so all these people
06:43
followed socrates around writing down
06:45
everything he said because socrates
06:46
refused to write anything down himself
06:48
so plato was his sort of main disciple
06:50
who wrote loads of stuff about him and
06:51
then xenophon wrote loads of stuff and
06:53
they sort of refused to ever acknowledge
06:54
each other's presence except they would
06:56
have slide digs at each other's work
06:58
when they wrote about socrates so you
07:00
know it's thought they had a bit of a
07:01
rivalry going did socrates have a really
07:04
junior uh disciple who would just have
07:06
to write down shopping lists and stuff
07:07
like that
07:08
uh possibly actually he did have one
07:10
called simon the shoemaker who sounds
07:12
kind of junior
07:14
level he actually made socrates socks
07:17
[Laughter]
07:19
oddly did they have shoes back then or
07:20
sandals would have been sandals they did
07:22
have shoes in ancient greece i mean they
07:24
had democracy down
07:27
one of the other things about socrates
07:28
is sneezing was supposedly the sneeze
07:30
demon would notify him with a sneeze or
07:32
someone else sneezing when his wife was
07:34
about to have what's been translated as
07:36
a scolding fit so he so that he could
07:38
run away
07:40
because apparently she's got life
07:42
zanthippi wasn't she yeah she's famously
07:44
like a scold or a you know
07:47
she's like maris in frasier yeah exactly
07:49
um supposedly she got so angry that
07:51
sometimes she would turn over the supper
07:52
table even if there were guests oh my
07:55
god so i think she was like the hulk
07:56
wonder if she invented that the
07:59
the angry table flip
08:01
i've never done that and it's my dream
08:02
to one day do it properly they really
08:05
got there with everything before us
08:07
these are the little inventions we don't
08:09
talk about
08:10
um xanthippi was supposedly the only
08:12
person who ever beat socrates in an
08:14
argument it was said really um yeah um
08:17
by basically shouting over him louder
08:19
than he could speak
08:21
and after one argument she poured a um
08:24
what do you call it a chamber pot over
08:26
his head
08:27
and it led him to remark after the
08:29
thunder comes the rain
08:31
and that's supposed to be a clever thing
08:32
that he said he even invented i asked
08:35
for the news not the weather
08:40
[Music]
08:42
okay time for fact number two and that
08:44
is andrew hunter murray my fact is that
08:47
people used to hang their fridges from
08:49
the ceiling
08:51
what people um and why because to create
08:54
more room on the floor no to stop vermin
08:57
from getting at your food
08:59
you suspend it from the ceiling like a
09:00
bird feeder but it's a person feeder um
09:03
and this was i think in the
09:05
17th and 18th centuries and even into
09:07
the 19th century i think people so
09:09
basically just before they got fridges
09:11
pretty much yeah yeah the it was called
09:13
a meat safe
09:14
so it didn't actually involve artificial
09:16
refrigeration but it was the precursor
09:18
to the fridge basically it's more like a
09:19
ladder kind of thing exactly yeah yeah
09:21
um and so you would just get a box made
09:24
of wood or metal uh with perforated
09:26
sides and um you would hang it from the
09:28
ceiling
09:30
some people mounted theirs on the wall
09:31
and some people just put them on the
09:33
floor with long legs
09:34
so meat safes had doors yeah yet they
09:36
still had to keep them off the ground
09:38
because of vermin
09:39
yeah
09:40
okay they can chew through i think they
09:42
could it could be chewed through if they
09:43
would or think okay yeah yeah but
09:45
basically the original safe was for
09:47
keeping meat in yes yeah oh really so
09:49
that's before they had safe money and
09:52
stuff yeah people were quite against
09:53
refrigeration when it sort of came in
09:55
like so in the early 1900s when we
09:57
started being able to transport ice in
09:59
in big batches and we'd start creating
10:02
refrigerator compartments to transport
10:04
food
10:04
people were against it for two reasons
10:07
so i think this was mainly in america it
10:09
was quite quite interesting they thought
10:11
that first of all it meant that sellers
10:13
of produce could manipulate the market
10:14
because now you could preserve food you
10:16
could create like an artificial scarcity
10:19
and then cause the prices to go up and
10:20
then sell it for more wow and it also
10:22
meant fewer end of the day bargains
10:24
because you didn't have to sell your
10:25
food at the end of the day so um people
10:28
were often banned from refrigerating
10:29
their foods overnight and preserving
10:30
them until the next day to sell them
10:32
because meant you couldn't do those
10:34
things and in fact also they thought
10:35
that it meant food wouldn't be as fresh
10:38
and so in 1880 i think one of france's
10:41
most successful fruit wholesalers was
10:43
this guy called desugi or dekugi he used
10:46
to transport his fruit all over france
10:48
in trains and sell it everywhere and he
10:49
started refrigerating it in the chat in
10:51
the trains in a cold chamber full of ice
10:53
when people found out he was
10:54
refrigerating it they were so outraged
10:56
that because it meant that his fruit
10:57
wasn't fresh anymore because he put it
10:59
in a cold chamber that he had to uh
11:01
invite people to a public ceremony in a
11:03
public square where he burned the fridge
11:05
and agreed never to refrigerate food
11:07
again wow and everyone got food
11:09
poisoning from
11:11
france yeah it was when they used to get
11:13
ice from um lakes didn't they uh one of
11:15
them was lake wenham which was the most
11:17
famous lake in the world
11:19
in the 19th century because they got ice
11:22
there and they took it all the way
11:23
around the world was that the one in
11:25
massachusetts yeah it's near boston yeah
11:27
and um now it's just like a reservoir
11:29
it's fenced off you're not allowed to go
11:30
there it's just like a little rubbish
11:32
reservoir but it used to be the most
11:33
famous lake in the world that's where
11:34
all the eyes came from yeah and they've
11:36
it was really really clear really seemed
11:39
clean uh somewhere in mayfair i think
11:41
they used to keep some in the in the
11:43
shop window with a newspaper behind it
11:44
so you could read the newspaper to show
11:46
how clear it was
11:48
the first time they brought any over to
11:49
the uk they didn't know what to do it
11:51
what to tax it because it was ice they
11:53
didn't know whether it was water or it's
11:54
a solid or liquid or whatever and they
11:56
kind of spent about two months trying to
11:58
work out and it all melted
12:01
and then there was um in sweden though
12:03
they had a lake as well which had really
12:05
good ice and they renamed their lake i
12:07
think it was called opus guard or
12:08
something they renamed the lake lake
12:10
wenham so that they could say they had
12:12
late weather mice as well
12:14
wow smart move swedes
12:17
um yeah i think that was it was a guy
12:19
called frederick tudor who became known
12:20
as frederick the ice king of the world
12:23
tudor who first decided that he first
12:25
realized that he could make us fortunate
12:27
of getting all this ice off lake wenham
12:29
and then he paired up with another guy
12:30
who invented the ice plough which i
12:32
think is really cool so you had
12:33
horse-drawn ice plows in the 1830s i
12:36
think it was which would go up and down
12:37
the lake um cut and it would cut the ice
12:39
into big blocks so you didn't have to
12:40
cut it by hand anymore yeah
12:43
this is really interesting refrigerators
12:45
this is the this is the line i read
12:47
online refrigerators have been used
12:48
successfully to artificially hibernate
12:50
many animals snakes lizards and even
12:52
bats have been hibernated in domestic
12:54
refrigerators so and there's this gives
12:57
you a whole protocol of how you can
12:59
hibernate artificially an animal of
13:01
yours if you have a turtle or if you
13:03
have a lizard uh certainly why i bought
13:05
my fridge yeah but i just didn't know
13:06
that was possible you can actually and
13:08
but they they say that uh what the
13:10
fridge will not do definitely is if it
13:12
drops below what you're meant to have it
13:14
as as the hibernation coolness it will
13:17
kill the animal so you've got to be
13:19
really careful i'm not sure we're
13:20
advising people to do it though are we
13:22
certainly still on a different shelf to
13:24
the yogurt
13:27
um there are two really dangerous things
13:29
about fridges really dangerous um the
13:32
fact that the london fire brigade says
13:34
that fridge freezers are the most
13:35
dangerous household appliance when it
13:37
comes to starting fires they cause the
13:39
most deaths um it's because they have a
13:41
lot of plastic and flammable insulation
13:42
and a lot of ice
13:44
and you would have thought not enough
13:46
but enough
13:50
yeah but ice when heated turns to water
13:53
oh yeah
13:54
and they do use water be cool if there
13:57
was a fire brigade who used ice you
13:59
could ring 9999 or something did you get
14:02
like this is a really serious fire guys
14:06
they turn up with the horse ice plow
14:09
get so many blockages in your hose pipe
14:12
um so anyway that's one dangerous thing
14:14
about fridges
14:15
they're gonna explode set fire to your
14:16
house uh the other one is so four in
14:18
every five u.s fridges has fridge
14:20
magnets on it and i don't have the stats
14:22
for the uk but i would guess similar and
14:25
a lot of fridge magnets are so strong
14:27
that if you have a pacemaker can have
14:30
deadly consequences oh yeah you walk
14:31
past pacemakers and it disrupts the or
14:34
um it can completely disrupt it that's
14:36
pretty stubborn
14:37
so right apparently you have to put
14:39
warnings on a lot of fridge magnets now
14:40
because the fridge magnets do tend to be
14:42
stronger than your standard magnet wow
14:44
wow there's not enough space on a fridge
14:45
magnet for a warning as in that way if
14:47
you had it
14:48
oh on the package it would ruin the
14:50
woody phrase that's what i'm saying
14:52
walk a mile in someone else's shoes then
14:54
you'll be a mile away and be wearing
14:55
their shoes
15:01
yeah those kind of things i don't really
15:03
know
15:04
what it does
15:08
what it does is you can do a number of
15:10
things like it has a scanner so anything
15:11
that you put in you scan the food that
15:13
goes in
15:14
yeah and yeah this is smart you run out
15:16
of um you run out of milk and it knows
15:18
you've run out of milk yeah exactly well
15:20
it's part of the uh international
15:22
things yeah and there was in 2014 there
15:26
was the first hacking scandal where
15:29
people were hacked through fridges
15:30
weren't they yeah
15:32
really 750 000 phishing emails were sent
15:36
from fridges to people's email accounts
15:38
oh wow i thought when you sort of said
15:40
hacking into fridges that you'd just
15:42
steal a banana or something
15:45
because that would be kind of hacking
15:46
i'd be interested in
15:48
we have 500 kilograms of beef in the
15:50
nigerian accounts that we would like to
15:53
send over to you
15:55
but yeah i think that's really cool that
15:56
we might be able to be hacked through
15:57
all of our household gadgets
15:59
fantastic i can't wait
16:02
i can't wait for
16:04
my own bedside lab to turn against me
16:08
[Music]
16:14
okay time for fact number three and that
16:16
is my fact my fact this week is that tv
16:19
star david frost used to host live shows
16:22
eight nights a week
16:25
fantasy david frost
16:27
yeah so this is uh is that a time zone
16:30
thing it is it's surprisingly true uh
16:32
david frost used to host a lot of night
16:34
shows and afternoon shows uh and what he
16:37
used to do was uh do four shows in
16:39
england
16:40
and then he would take concorde over to
16:43
new york
16:44
and concord famously bragged that you
16:46
had often arrived before you left and
16:48
that allowed him to then do a show that
16:50
night as well
16:51
uh and so he managed to do eight shows
16:53
per week great very impressive yeah so
16:56
he used to just go back and forth on
16:57
concord uh
17:00
these days could you because it takes
17:01
like eight hours to get to new york
17:03
exactly since concorde is has gone uh
17:05
this has become impossible but yeah i
17:07
don't think i appreciated enough at the
17:08
time because i guess i was too young
17:10
concorde was extraordinary he used to go
17:12
over uh my house when i was very young
17:14
yeah i remember this amazing sound of it
17:16
yeah it went faster than faster than a
17:18
rifle bullet
17:19
i think wow and fast if you fired a
17:22
bullet at the retreating concorde
17:24
would accelerate away wow wow
17:27
faster than the rotation of the earth
17:30
yeah 1 350 miles an hour is the top
17:32
speed ridiculous i mean it was twice the
17:34
speed of sound wasn't it it wasn't like
17:35
they just broke the speed of sound and
17:36
thought well let's linger around one or
17:38
two miles an hour above it they doubled
17:40
it yeah they went twice you're right
17:42
and they used to fly at a sort of
17:44
altitude of 50 to 55 000 feet people
17:47
used to say that you could see the
17:48
curvature of the earth when you're at
17:49
that height yeah which is astonishing
17:52
one of the most amazing things about it
17:54
was that it had i'm quoting here from an
17:56
ascot about computer-controlled engine
17:58
air intakes right now that doesn't sound
18:01
very cool but it is because what it
18:03
means is that the air going into the
18:04
engine had to be slowed down by a
18:07
thousand miles an hour
18:09
over a distance of 15 feet
18:12
wow air comes in at the 1 300 miles an
18:16
hour or whatever it might be and it has
18:17
to be slowed down only over four meters
18:20
whiplash that air has serious whiplash
18:22
and without it the engines just would
18:23
have blown up immediately but that was
18:24
the cool thing about it the kind of fact
18:26
you do not want to be told if you're me
18:27
or down and it's about to take off yeah
18:29
if we didn't do this the engines would
18:30
explode immediately oh my god
18:32
unfortunately we think it's gonna go
18:33
okay um
18:34
andy warhol used to steal all of the uh
18:37
the items on the plane sort of like
18:39
little plates and and silverware and so
18:41
on because he knew that it would be
18:42
collectible for some reason like he just
18:44
thought it would be collectible and so
18:46
he encouraged people no excuse for
18:47
stealing yeah yeah i know a lot of stuff
18:49
in the british museum is collectible
18:52
i went ab sailed in there in the middle
18:53
of the 90s to get it let's go to david
18:56
frost shall we yeah um he was offered a
18:59
contract to play for nottingham forest
19:02
but he turned it down because the
19:03
maximum wage for a football player at
19:05
the time was 15 pounds a week
19:07
and he predicted concord and his desire
19:09
to travel on it eight times a week
19:12
that's not gonna sustain me yeah but
19:14
obviously in those days uh before jimmy
19:17
hill
19:18
there was a maximum wage for footballers
19:20
and so it wasn't a very good profession
19:22
to go into we should um just very
19:23
quickly for younger listeners and people
19:26
who may just have never heard of david
19:28
frost explain who he was so he died not
19:30
too long ago he was a tv host he used to
19:34
do interviews very famously interviewed
19:36
richard nixon and there's a movie frost
19:38
nixon which won a lot of awards and he
19:40
was just one of those guys that seemed
19:41
to know everybody and be around for
19:44
every major event on tv uh some of his
19:47
tv shows that he did yeah can i read a
19:48
few out yeah go for it
19:50
a degree of frost the frost reports
19:52
frost over england frost over america
19:54
frost's weekly the frost interview
19:56
breakfast with frost talking with david
19:58
frost headliners with david frost the
20:01
david frost show frost on friday frost
20:03
on saturday frost on sunday the frost
20:06
program frost on sketch shows frost on
20:08
interviews frost on satire frost tonight
20:11
and frost
20:13
but not a touch of frost
20:15
[Laughter]
20:19
wow he really made the most of that name
20:21
yeah yeah
20:22
was he paranoid people were going to
20:24
forget it or something
20:25
that is it's a bit strange there's a
20:27
good name for a for an interviewer and a
20:30
host or something because it's a noun
20:31
which is good but it's not a bad noun
20:33
like worms
20:34
[Laughter]
20:36
worms on sunday fist with worms
20:41
[Laughter]
20:45
um we actually so um
20:48
james and i this show that we do museum
20:50
of curiosity we actually had frost on
20:53
the show and weirdly it was the last
20:56
program he ever did
20:58
yeah so museum of curiosity his
21:00
appearance on that is his final
21:02
appearance it was quite amazing because
21:04
he was on the airways for more than 50
21:06
years wasn't he um and constantly as
21:09
well i don't think he could escape in
21:11
him in the in the 70s 70s 80s do you
21:13
know the longest career of any presenter
21:15
in history whilst according to the
21:16
guinness book of records no there's
21:18
someone in japan no
21:20
someone in cuba
21:22
she's called in yes sanchez de revuelta
21:26
and she was on tv for 52 years she
21:30
hosted the program tele club um since
21:33
1963 and has never been off tv for more
21:36
than 3.5 months
21:40
that's something isn't it yeah that's
21:42
amazing i really hoped you were going to
21:44
say more than 3.5 minutes
21:47
just for bathroom breaks and naps
21:50
um while i was uh
21:52
was reading up on nixon just came across
21:55
this fact nixon used to love fireplaces
21:57
he used to love a roaring fire so he
22:00
used to at the white house and make sure
22:01
that there was always a fire roaring in
22:04
the lincoln room
22:05
the thing is though is that he was never
22:07
interested in the heat he just loved the
22:08
fire so he used to have all the air cons
22:10
turned on to high in any room that he
22:12
had a fire on wow yeah because he just
22:14
didn't he was he just like the sound and
22:16
the look he liked the look yeah he just
22:17
wanted a roaring fire just get a picture
22:20
you'd think yeah well much more
22:22
environmentally friendly if there's a
22:23
fire going it's easier to conceal the
22:24
noise of the tapes being changed in the
22:26
machine
22:29
topical as ever
22:32
he also more weird behavior from nixon
22:34
after his dog checkers died a secret
22:36
service agent saw him eating the dog
22:38
biscuits
22:40
no they do really no but the crunching
22:43
of the dog helps disguise the sound of
22:45
the changing of the tapes
22:49
and frost said when he when he came on
22:51
this uh on museum of curiosity that um
22:53
when he did the interviews with nixon
22:56
nixon was the worst person for small
22:58
talk he had no small talk whatsoever um
23:01
so it was so weird that he used to
23:03
insist before any interview five minutes
23:05
of small talk nixon says nixon would
23:07
insist that he had five minutes of small
23:09
talk with the person before an interview
23:11
but he just didn't know so
23:13
theory that sounds like a good idea
23:14
because you get to you know relax and
23:17
you know yes
23:18
but so frost remembers those bits of
23:20
small talk and he said they were truly
23:22
awkward because he just did not say one
23:24
thing he said when he came up to him was
23:25
um get any fornicating done on the
23:27
weekend
23:28
that was his opening line actually
23:30
speaking of fornicating nixon once had
23:32
delivered to him a naked woman in a
23:34
trunk
23:35
um in a suitcase yes um and this was
23:38
when he had a couple of kind of hard
23:39
partying friends who apparently were the
23:41
only kind of people he probably relaxed
23:43
in front of he was notoriously uptight
23:44
usually and uh there's this guy called
23:46
robozo who
23:48
can't believe that's his name i've just
23:50
read that i've realized how ridiculous
23:52
that is
23:54
so there's a guy called robozo and his
23:56
friend amplernalp
24:00
these guys would never have had the same
24:01
career as frost had breakfast with
24:04
rabosa
24:07
so yeah they got a prostitute i think
24:09
and got her into a suitcase and brought
24:11
her to the white house and bumped into
24:13
the secret service agents and were like
24:15
we've got a delivery for nixon and
24:16
unfortunately the secret service agent
24:18
said what is it i thought it sounds like
24:20
there's a naked woman inside there and
24:21
turned them away at the door but so he
24:24
never got his gift
24:26
for doing their job and not letting
24:27
robozo and alpenel
24:30
get one of their capers away
24:32
let's run for a series of books about
24:34
rebozo and alphanov's crazy adventures
24:37
it's always just another naked
24:39
prostitute in some other kind
24:40
[Laughter]
24:43
we're just here to give this wedding
24:44
cake we're just here to install this new
24:47
chimney
24:48
[Laughter]
24:53
okay time for our final fact of the show
24:56
and that is james my fact this week is
24:58
that the original chill pill was a pill
25:00
that you took when you had a chill
25:03
nice
25:05
that's very good makes a lot of sense um
25:07
so yeah this is from let's say 19th
25:09
century uh it was like a homemade pill
25:12
that you would make um the ingredients
25:14
would be sulfur quinine
25:16
arcenius acid uh strickenine prussian
25:19
blue and capsisum
25:22
and you would shove it all together into
25:24
a pill form and then you would take it
25:26
if you had a cold and was it cool it was
25:28
called chill pills it was called the
25:29
chill pill yeah cool so yeah um that was
25:31
the original chill pill and the use of
25:33
the word chill as in to relax only dates
25:36
back to 1979 it uh dates back to a song
25:39
called rapper's delight oh which is
25:41
apparently by travis sick tricks isaac
25:44
well rappers uh rappers delight you will
25:45
know it's the probably the most famous
25:47
rap song it's like one of the first ever
25:49
rap songs yes it's i said a hip hop
25:52
hip hop you don't start
25:54
it's uh mentioned 14 times in the oed
25:57
that song wow
25:59
in the oxford english dictionary um it's
26:01
the first time that anyone used the word
26:03
rhyme as in a set of lyrics as in listen
26:06
to my rhyme
26:08
the first time anyone used the word
26:10
rapper
26:11
um to refer to someone who's rapping
26:13
previously um it would either mean a
26:15
massive lie
26:16
or it would mean someone who like wraps
26:18
a table or something wow
26:20
and it was the first place to use mc as
26:23
in
26:24
master of ceremonies wow oh my god so
26:26
were people just listening to this song
26:28
at the time going what
26:29
is this guy talking about
26:32
no as usual these things were used but
26:34
this is the first citation
26:36
that they have and also um the first use
26:38
of the word ill meaning bad
26:41
but meaning good
26:42
meaning good it was seven years later
26:45
so it took seven years for ill to mean
26:47
bad as in this is oh this is really ill
26:50
man two meaning good which is oh this is
26:52
really ill man
26:54
i'd just like to point out that you
26:55
can't pull off either of those phrases
27:00
did you say the date of the uh the
27:01
original chill pill 1879
27:04
um but any time over the next 20 years
27:06
they still were making
27:08
um you know one of cause obviously a lot
27:09
of uh uh wacky medicines were peddled in
27:12
the 19th century not all effective um
27:14
and in pill form and one of the most
27:16
successful peddlers of these medicines
27:18
was someone who made brand vegetable
27:21
pills um which could fight off basically
27:23
everything you'd ever have so fever
27:25
sickness headache pimples ulcers yellow
27:28
fever and essentially they were just
27:30
laxatives and so the whole thing was
27:32
that the point was uh that they
27:34
got all impurities out of you so i think
27:36
one of the taglines was brandeis pills
27:38
put all your pains and impurities out of
27:40
the system through the bowels but it was
27:43
um charles branson's great grandfather
27:45
really wow
27:46
who got really rich off them yeah he
27:48
gets there's a street named after him in
27:49
new york now because he became so rich
27:51
and famous because of these pills and he
27:53
gets a mention in moby dick apparently
27:56
oh wow jess brown's great grandfather
27:58
isn't that cool it's so weird when you
28:00
hear about celebrities with a great
28:01
great great great great grandfather who
28:03
was notable yeah are you just saying wow
28:05
like that's just i was reading bear
28:07
grylls's autobiography uh on holiday and
28:10
his great great great great great
28:11
grandfather don't know how many greats
28:13
wrote the very first self-help book and
28:15
it was called self-help really yeah and
28:18
um
28:19
it's uh it was so big in its day that it
28:21
outsold on the origin of species which
28:23
is when it came out roughly at the same
28:25
time yeah i can't remember his name um
28:28
that's it i didn't know that he was
28:29
related to bear grylls yes yeah directly
28:31
related wow yeah with a name like samuel
28:34
smiles it's the ideal uh profession
28:36
isn't it yeah as is bear grylls if you
28:38
want to be you know someone who lives in
28:39
the wild there is an amazing it'd be
28:41
better if he was called grylls bear yes
28:43
why isn't he called that he is when he
28:45
fills him forms
28:46
[Laughter]
28:48
um another weird relation i found out
28:50
about speaking of that actually the
28:52
other day is that is it stephen dubner
28:54
the guy in from freakonomics yes who um
28:56
we love and think is great um his
28:59
grandfather or great grandfather wrote
29:00
rudolph the never had nose reindeer did
29:02
he did he yeah
29:04
wow
29:04
so i was looking up some slang terms of
29:06
things that are older than you'd think
29:08
they are um so for example the word text
29:11
as a verb goes back to 1564. does it wow
29:16
obviously it doesn't mean to write a
29:17
text on a mobile phone it means to uh to
29:19
quote texts
29:21
and um dude goes back to 1876
29:24
which was originally to make fun of a
29:26
woman the way a woman was dressed you'd
29:28
say oh she's a dude
29:29
um and or there was even a feminine
29:31
version of it dude
29:33
was it was a it was after dude became a
29:35
male word then you'd say all right
29:37
that's the thing joe wendy's to marry
29:39
the young doodin out there wow i can't
29:41
believe men hogged that one of the few
29:43
you know quite cool fun nouns that's
29:46
been applied to us and you guys had to
29:47
get in there
29:48
clutch it away
29:50
now we're stuck with dudette or dude
29:53
one slang term that i was reading about
29:56
uh cowabunga oh yeah
29:58
so
29:59
what do you associate cowabunga
30:00
teenagers ninja turtles yeah it was a
30:02
japanese word is it not oh uh
30:05
i haven't yeah i haven't done the total
30:07
origin on this it's just that i watched
30:09
a documentary on the ninja turtles and
30:10
they said the uh the writers took
30:13
cowabunga from snoopy did that
30:15
so cowabunga first appears in snoopy
30:19
really yeah i think on a cover where
30:21
snoopy's on a surfboard as well
30:23
wow
30:24
that's very cool yeah um i looked up a
30:26
timeline of uh slang terms by jonathan
30:29
green who is an amazing slang
30:32
lexicographer we have his complete slang
30:34
dictionary it's so good so he's done
30:36
these really cool online slang terms for
30:38
all sorts of different things so just
30:40
idly i was looking at slang terms for
30:42
vagina over the centuries
30:44
these all date from the 19th and early
30:46
20th century um
30:48
coffee grinder
30:49
front front parlor
30:51
bum shop
30:52
carnal man trap
30:54
central office
30:56
bit on a fork
30:58
and my favorite
30:59
that thing
31:02
it kind of makes it sound like we used
31:03
to repurpose vaginas for a lot of other
31:05
things
31:07
well i i sell my wares out of it in the
31:09
daytime i saw my coffee grinder out of
31:11
the front parlor
31:13
there's a central office
31:15
after the bum shop
31:18
um a really interesting thing on pills
31:19
okay
31:20
is that so the color of the pill you're
31:22
swallowing can have an effect on can
31:24
affect how well it works
31:27
if you take the blue pill you wake up in
31:29
your bed and everything's the same if
31:31
you take the red pill
31:34
that's from a movie called the matrix
31:38
i kept some of the references
31:40
now this is a placebo effect thing so uh
31:43
red pills are more effective for
31:44
treating pain it's been found and blue
31:46
pills are more effective for uh pills to
31:49
calm you down to have calming effects
31:51
and there's an exception to this so
31:53
blue pills are more effective
31:55
tranquilizers except for italian men
31:57
it's been suggested that this could be
31:59
because blue is associated with their
32:00
football team
32:02
and so when they football team oh the
32:04
italian football team yeah so italian
32:06
men see a blue pill and just get really
32:09
over excited because it reminds them of
32:10
the
32:12
football team
32:13
that's genuinely what the research has
32:15
concluded that is bizarre they're the
32:16
only people who don't get karma when
32:18
they sort of a blue pill
32:20
that's very cool
32:22
very weird um john wesley who founded
32:25
methodism he had a
32:27
lot of ideas of curing the cold uh one
32:29
of them was to make pills out of cobwebs
32:32
oh yeah that would work uh presumably it
32:35
didn't
32:36
he also thought you could take a very
32:38
thin round of an orange roll it inside
32:41
out and thrust it into each nostril
32:44
so not effective no not effective um
32:47
when sars um came out and uh when was
32:50
that when it was released the big one
32:52
when i had the big launch party they
32:53
shouldn't have invited so many people to
32:54
the launch party
32:58
but it was thought in some parts of
32:59
china that um vinegar would solve sars
33:03
and um what they would do is they put
33:04
vinegar in the corner of the room and
33:06
that would supposedly help to cure it
33:09
and it was like a folk remedy but it was
33:11
really good news for vinegar salesmen
33:13
because it meant that they could sell
33:14
tons of their wares of course um but
33:17
that was bad news because it meant that
33:18
the vinegar salesmen were then traveling
33:20
between village and village and village
33:21
and they were spreading oh wow oh no
33:25
this is that's kind of like a i mean
33:27
that could be a zombie film couldn't it
33:29
based on vinegar salesman spreading the
33:31
common cold yeah that's a really good
33:32
idea yeah not a very exciting film
33:35
sounds like another one of the brilliant
33:36
schemes of rebozo and altenew
33:42
okay that's it that's all of our winter
33:44
facts thank you so much for listening if

=97
00:00
hey guys it's andy here just before we
00:02
start this week's episode of fish we
00:04
wanted to let you know that if you live
00:06
in around or actually within a 200 mile
00:09
radius of canterbury we're going to be
00:10
performing there on the 28th of january
00:13
in the gulbenkian theater and we would
00:15
love it if you came to join us we will
00:17
be recording an episode of the podcast
00:20
no such thing as a fish
00:21
which is what you're about to hear
00:24
not you're not about to hear the one we
00:25
recorded in the future
00:28
on with the show
00:30
[Music]
00:36
[Music]
00:39
[Applause]
00:39
[Music]
00:40
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:43
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:46
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:47
covent garden my name is dan schreiber
00:49
i'm sitting here with andy murray james
00:51
harkin and our friend helen arne of
00:53
festival of the spoken nerd and once
00:55
again we've gathered around the
00:56
microphones with our four favorite facts
00:58
from the last seven days and in no
01:00
particular order here we go starting
01:03
with you helen
01:04
my fact is
01:06
tomorrow will be the longest day of your
01:08
life what do you know about my life that
01:12
means the tour is going to be so
01:13
terrible
01:14
it's because i won't be with you and
01:16
that's why it's going to be so long
01:18
the days on earth are getting longer all
01:21
the time on average right this is an on
01:23
average thing so potentially tomorrow
01:25
could be your longest ever day but then
01:28
the day after that could be even longer
01:29
oh wow we're talking like tiny tiny
01:32
amounts but the earth is gradually being
01:34
so it's not like 20 minutes yeah you
01:37
don't suddenly wake up tomorrow and
01:38
you're like wow got an extra spare 20
01:39
minutes it's like you've got a micro
01:41
second you've got a micro second spare
01:42
oh so okay what will i do with this
01:46
take the dog for a walk
01:48
thinking about what you will do with it
01:49
you will waste it
01:51
like
01:52
in the next 800 years if we didn't
01:55
adjust our clocks uh to account for this
01:57
we would be an hour out so midday
02:01
wouldn't be when the sun is at its
02:03
highest point it would be 1 pm so in 800
02:05
years time will be an hour out unless we
02:09
adjust uh our clocks and we we add these
02:12
things called uh leap seconds all kind
02:13
of stuff do you know that the word noon
02:15
used to mean 3 p.m
02:17
so you would go 12 p.m 1 2 noon 4. yeah
02:21
because
02:22
noon was the ninth hour of the day and
02:24
you can work back however many hours
02:26
that was it was six a.m wasn't it yeah
02:27
so the first hour of the day for in uh
02:29
was it roman times uh actually in
02:31
medieval times and i think it was for um
02:34
like people who were praying they would
02:35
have to pray on the ninth hour and so
02:37
they would do the noontime prayers and
02:39
it would be at three so in the year 5000
02:43
approximately oh yeah midday will be
02:45
we'll be back there we'll be back at
02:47
noon this is perfect
02:48
what were you saying about leap seconds
02:50
well this is the weird bit about all of
02:54
this slowing down because the earth is
02:55
slowing down there's nothing you can do
02:57
about it it's things like um tidal
02:59
forces kind of slowing down the earth by
03:02
moving in and out changing the angular
03:03
momentum if you want to get physically
03:04
about it but things like earthquakes
03:06
they can speed up
03:08
the movement of the earth
03:10
on average things so over the last few
03:14
decades we've noticed that the earth has
03:16
slowed down but sometimes it's speeding
03:18
up and sometimes it's slowing down so on
03:20
average it's slowing down but they can't
03:23
predict it exactly so you can never say
03:26
right next year we need to add a leap
03:28
second we'll get back to normal because
03:30
some years you're going a bit slower
03:32
some years ago faster so these
03:34
organizations uh decide they're kind of
03:37
like the real time lords they decide
03:39
when we're gonna add a leap second
03:40
there's a guy at the national physical
03:42
laboratory which is down in south london
03:45
and um he's kind of in charge a little
03:46
bit of this kind of measurement of the
03:48
time
03:49
he's known as the time lord like you
03:50
were saying they call him the time lord
03:52
his real name is peter wibbley
03:56
but that's really interesting because
03:58
doctor who calls his um sonic
04:00
screwdriver the wibbly wobbly so he's
04:02
got a yeah yeah it's the wibbly wobbly
04:04
timey wymay anyway peter whibley or
04:06
we're going to call him the timeline
04:08
he said there are consequences with
04:10
tinkering with time all the consequences
04:12
daleks
04:15
robo men no i think
04:18
i don't watch it
04:19
cybermen yeah sure
04:22
it is a trade-off though because
04:23
computer time is clocking along in its
04:26
own happy way being exactly 60 seconds
04:29
exactly 60 minutes exactly 24 hours but
04:33
the earth is doing something a little
04:35
bit different the earth is doing 20.
04:37
doing its thing one second every couple
04:40
of years and the thing is if we do
04:42
change it then we need to tell the
04:44
computers as well yeah right that's
04:45
where it goes horribly wrong because
04:47
they can only
04:48
tell you six months in advance they're
04:49
gonna add a leap second
04:51
all of the stock exchanges are now
04:52
computerized and one second adding one
04:55
second to one computer and not adding it
04:59
to another
05:00
means that all of the financial
05:02
transactions happening in microseconds
05:04
can be exploited suddenly the stock
05:06
exchanges can go
05:08
about the number or the average time
05:10
that people hold on to a share is like
05:12
0.01 seconds or something something
05:14
crazy because they all happen so quickly
05:17
and so micro transactions happening all
05:19
the time like you or i might own 10
05:21
shares in tesco's or whatever i
05:23
certainly have
05:25
i was very worried when the quarterly
05:27
figures came out
05:29
um but companies will have you know 100
05:32
or a thousand shares in tesco's
05:34
microsoft
05:35
there are a thousand shows in tesco
05:37
james
05:39
i'm pretty sure i own more than a tenth
05:41
of tesco
05:45
there is actually a big international
05:46
argument about whether we keep the leap
05:48
second though uh because the u.s and
05:50
france want to abolish leap seconds
05:52
because they're incredibly annoying but
05:54
britain russia and china
05:56
say that the technical challenges should
05:58
be manageable right we should be able to
06:00
handle this but this
06:02
last leap second quite a few gps
06:04
receivers knocked out apparently in the
06:06
2012 one reddit was down for 40 minutes
06:09
which was incredible
06:11
uh 2015 twitter pinterest and instagram
06:15
and amazon were down for about an hour
06:18
or something did i not read that they um
06:20
had to ground all qantas flights for
06:22
about an hour or something yeah it was
06:23
2012 their booking system went awol
06:26
because the systems couldn't cope with
06:28
this added second in the middle of the
06:30
night um there's a thing i don't know
06:32
too much about this but you guys might
06:33
anna was telling me this that the
06:36
because
06:36
[Laughter]
06:38
someone i used to know um so basically
06:41
uh obviously every planet has a
06:43
different uh amount of day uh to earth
06:47
well they're not all 24 hours yeah so
06:49
all the nasa scientists who are working
06:51
on the rovers on mars have to adjust
06:53
their clocks to be doing a work schedule
06:55
on mars time
06:56
so they work on a mars day that's cool
06:59
it's like 20 is it 26 hours or something
07:01
it's not that different yeah it's not
07:02
that similar yeah yeah but it starts to
07:05
really mess you up i found a really cool
07:07
uh measurement so i was looking into
07:09
different measurements of time um
07:11
and found a few surprising ones that i
07:12
didn't know were real things like for
07:14
example i would always hear an american
07:16
say i'll be there in a jiffy i didn't
07:18
know jiffy was an actual unit of time
07:21
yeah yeah jiffy's an actual unit of time
07:23
it's a 0.1 seconds really yeah uh
07:26
another unit
07:28
uh do you guys know how long a moment is
07:31
so i got this from a guy called uh
07:33
hagrid hawks at haggard hawks is on
07:35
twitter
07:36
uh in medieval europe uh 90 seconds is
07:39
what a moment was defined as okay be
07:42
there in a moment of course in 90
07:43
seconds that's
07:45
is that right
07:46
that that's according to this guy he
07:48
runs a really amazing blog about um
07:50
words that are no longer used it's a
07:52
it's a really nice kind of uh tweet i
07:54
read once that a moment now is like
07:56
three seconds or something
07:59
is that how long you have to be hugging
08:00
someone for it to be uncomfortable yeah
08:02
it is it's it was a similar stuff it was
08:04
some kind of study about hugging and it
08:07
was like how long the average hug is
08:08
until it gets a bit awkward and they
08:10
said it was a moment which is three
08:12
seconds and then they said a lot of
08:14
other things in your body also lasts for
08:16
three seconds i can't remember what it
08:17
was it was yeah so i don't think it's
08:19
universal because i think if james and i
08:21
hugged it'll be awkward after about 0.2
08:23
seconds
08:25
[Laughter]
08:29
[Music]
08:31
[Applause]
08:34
okay time for fact number two and that
08:36
is james
08:38
okay my fact this week is that in 1457
08:42
men with mustaches were banned from
08:44
dublin
08:45
this is such a cool fact
08:47
what why
08:48
they didn't like irish people yes it was
08:50
irish people weirdly with it being
08:52
dublin
08:53
but because dublin was owned by the
08:55
english at the time just the area around
08:57
dublin uh the rest of ireland was run by
09:00
the irish but the area around dublin was
09:02
run by the english it was called the
09:04
pale which is where we get the phrase
09:06
beyond the pale for something that's
09:07
crazy something that was outside of this
09:09
pale area and what they didn't want was
09:12
irish people in the town but if an
09:14
irishman did kind of get in there how
09:17
would you know it was him well they all
09:18
had these mustaches so if there was an
09:20
english person in the pale who had a
09:22
mustache you didn't want him there
09:24
because everyone would think he was
09:25
irish right that was a problem the um
09:28
ordinance said men with bodies above the
09:30
mouth were not allowed and bodies meant
09:33
beards so any beard above the mouth so
09:36
you have a beard above the mouth down
09:38
no i don't but he's also going to be
09:40
below the belt he's got a beard i've got
09:41
a bit of growth i wouldn't say it's a
09:43
fully formed that counts as a bardy to
09:44
me really i'm afraid so well well they
09:47
hadn't had they even had a rule about
09:48
this it was so that is with this same
09:50
rule was so that the settlement be at
09:52
least shave them within two weeks so if
09:55
you haven't shaved for two weeks that's
09:56
what counts because amazingly at the
09:57
time they did not have a word for
09:59
mustache so they had to say if you have
10:01
any beard above the mouth or hair on
10:03
your upper lip they had no way of more
10:05
concise way of saying this
10:06
one thing i love about this is this is
10:08
i'm quite obsessed with facial hair and
10:10
beards in the sense that i'm really
10:12
fascinated by it because i can't have it
10:14
myself and i'm also fascinated by and i
10:16
don't really want it near me it's like
10:17
nuclear power stations
10:19
i know that they're really great and
10:21
lots of people like them but i just
10:22
don't want one pressed up against my
10:24
face
10:26
like a nuclear power station yeah
10:28
exactly but i i i'm absolutely obsessed
10:30
with beards and uh i've got some adverts
10:33
that i dug up about quack beard growing
10:36
solutions that were sold
10:39
uh by victorian quacks in order to for
10:41
people to grow
10:42
a beard because beards were um supposed
10:45
to be for health so you you they would
10:47
filter out the bad air and they would
10:48
apparently it was when it was when
10:51
people still thought that diseases were
10:52
carried by bad smells instead of by
10:54
contact so you would stop the bad smells
10:57
getting into your mouth blah blah um so
10:59
people would get a beard on prescription
11:01
and if they weren't able to grab a beer
11:03
they would get like a beard generating
11:06
liquid that they could smother over
11:08
themselves that's so funny that's
11:10
amazing so yeah beards were like for
11:12
health that's very cool
11:14
but then they weren't really out of
11:15
fashion at the end of victorian times
11:17
yeah yeah and there was a study in 1909
11:20
about how mustaches harbored germs
11:23
and this was the new york times this was
11:24
a french study they were quoting it said
11:26
a parisienne as in a female parisian
11:28
allowed herself to be kissed by a
11:30
clean-shaven man and then by a bearded
11:32
man and the clean-shaven man had left a
11:34
small quantity of harmless particles his
11:36
rival's kiss had colonized the lady's
11:38
lips with the bacilli of tuberculosis
11:41
diphtheria pneumonia
11:43
and numerous other unpleasant microbes
11:45
where did they get this bearded man they
11:47
just dredged him up from the sane
11:51
because you know
11:52
this is brilliant because
11:53
in the
11:54
journal of hospital infection uh they've
11:57
they went and swabbed some men with
11:59
beards and some men without beards and
12:00
the men without beards had mrsa on their
12:03
faces and the people with beards did not
12:06
have mrsa
12:11
arguably it's because the other but all
12:13
the other bacteria they had tons of
12:15
bacteria but it was producing toxins
12:18
that was then killing off the nastier it
12:20
was good bacteria yeah so it's like
12:22
penicillin penicillin
12:23
kills off other bacteria because it
12:25
produces toxins um i found a survey
12:28
result from 2010 of what people in
12:31
britain recognize as the most famous
12:33
mustaches in the world i think there's
12:35
one interestingly hitler is not on the
12:37
list you're kidding listen on the list
12:38
fix yeah totally
12:41
total fix
12:42
so in at number one we're 24
12:44
chaplain no chaplin is in at five give
12:47
us a give us a clue clue artist cassily
12:53
the picasso moustache famed
12:55
you panicked
12:57
i did
12:58
i could see andy was going for it
13:00
i was like i need to get in here fast
13:02
and then i just oh my god and just
13:04
quickly at number two in eighteen
13:05
percent picasso
13:07
[Laughter]
13:09
clue we need a clue uh clue uh sportsman
13:12
no big daddy in the haystacks with the
13:13
white moustache whatever the one with
13:15
the the wrestler with the white yes you
13:17
got it
13:20
headless moustache is way more famous
13:22
than hulk hogan's definitely yeah well
13:25
someone else missed out on the list of
13:26
most famous moustaches which is the
13:28
south korean striker kang su-il
13:31
who very recently was suspended for 15
13:33
matches uh because he was found to have
13:36
steroids in his system which he blamed
13:38
on a moustache growing cream that he had
13:41
been applying to his face
13:43
yeah did you say korean football player
13:46
yeah yeah okay because i've got the same
13:48
thing as a japanese football player well
13:50
a few years later a japanese rugby
13:53
player yes the world cup yeah exactly
13:55
for the same reason he said he was
13:56
trying to grow a mustache and uh and he
13:59
was using this kind of thing that had
14:01
yeah it seems that i've never heard of
14:03
uh modern day moustache cream yet in
14:05
korea and japan apparently this is a
14:07
thing clearly if they're using it as an
14:09
excuse
14:10
then it has at least some traction there
14:13
yeah there are a group of people in
14:15
japan called the anews
14:17
[Laughter]
14:21
what's wrong with you
14:22
[Laughter]
14:24
and um they are heavily mustached
14:28
so the hairy animals
14:31
honestly
14:32
um so the anus um they have these really
14:35
long mustaches and they are often said
14:38
to carry a mustache stick around to lift
14:41
the mustache when they're eating so they
14:42
don't get guinness or whatever inside
14:44
their mustaches that's very cool now it
14:46
was first described by a guy called
14:48
edward s moss when he uh went around
14:50
japan in the 19th century but it turns
14:52
out that it isn't a mustache stick it's
14:54
a prayer stick but they do use it to
14:56
lift their mustaches so he kind of is a
14:58
mustache okay what's a prastic
15:00
it's a stick you use for praying
15:04
is it like an antenna to god i don't
15:06
know i imagined it would be like you
15:08
know um like prayer bowls in buddhist
15:11
countries where you kind of
15:13
you would take the bowl and you would
15:14
make it make a ringing noise and it
15:16
would help you meditate or something i
15:17
imagined it was like that but i really
15:18
don't know
15:20
they did used to have i think it was
15:21
back in the victorian times a set of cut
15:23
like mugs and and so on where they had
15:25
mustache catchers so you'd place your
15:27
mustache into it as part of the
15:29
porcelain and there would be a i think
15:31
the anus had those as well
15:35
so maybe that's where those are big yeah
15:37
we had some of those on qa tv show oh
15:39
really under some of the spoons as well
15:40
which have a little hole in so it's like
15:42
a normal spoon except it's got a cap
15:43
over it with a hole cut out of it so you
15:46
can pour soup onto one half of the spoon
15:48
and then strain it through the hole so
15:50
you get none of your stuff wow that
15:52
sounds incredibly practical just from a
15:54
kind of sippy cup kind of perspective
15:56
yeah that that to have that would mean
15:58
i'd like one myself yeah i'd love one um
16:01
i've got another stick beard okay in
16:03
fact oh yeah uh facial hair stick effect
16:05
um which is uh we've mentioned the
16:08
popularity of beards in victorian times
16:11
in the early victorian times they're
16:12
incredibly unpopular and then they kind
16:15
of reached peak beard in the 1890s but
16:18
to give you an example uh
16:21
in the ninth in the 1840s only one
16:23
member of parliament had a beard and it
16:25
was george frederick muntz and uh this
16:29
was really extraordinary not just
16:30
because it looked like a toilet brush
16:31
attached to the bottom of his face but
16:34
um at the time beards were the mark of a
16:36
[ __ ] revolutionary or charlatan so he
16:39
used to carry a stick with him and i've
16:41
got this he was although he was a large
16:43
man he would carry a stiff cane with him
16:46
at all times to answer any insults he
16:48
encountered on the streets from people
16:50
who accused him of being either a crank
16:53
or an artist even
16:55
[Music]
16:58
um i thought i'd look at some other
17:00
things that happened in 1457. oh cool
17:03
just a few things uh pope paul ii died
17:06
in a melon-induced apoplexy
17:09
we've all been there incredible so this
17:12
is a uh anna who i should introduce you
17:14
guys to one day
17:16
she she didn't she do a big thing where
17:18
she found melon overdose was a massive
17:21
thing back around this time she loves it
17:23
yeah she found like 10 people kings and
17:26
popes and yeah all died from melon
17:28
overdose yeah but how is it like
17:30
it goes
17:31
i think it was surely something else
17:33
obviously with something else
17:35
yeah uh some other things um vlad the
17:37
impaler made his first raid into
17:39
transylvania in that year
17:41
uh golf was banned by james ii of
17:44
scotland
17:45
and in 1457 a sow a pig was convicted of
17:49
murder and sentenced to be hanged by the
17:51
hind feet from a gallows
17:53
her six piglets were found to be
17:55
accomplices
17:56
but as no evidence was offered against
17:58
them on an account of their tender age
18:00
they were acquitted wait but being
18:02
hanged by your hind feet wouldn't that
18:03
be just like a bungee jump
18:04
[Laughter]
18:07
[Music]
18:08
[Applause]
18:13
okay it's time for fact number three and
18:15
that is my fact my fact this week is
18:18
that diplodocuses could break the sound
18:20
barrier
18:22
the dinosaur
18:24
it was so fast
18:26
yeah was this like a the days were
18:29
shorter sound traveled a lot slower
18:32
i know so so the actual the actual
18:35
answer is that they had a little
18:36
whipping system at the end of their tail
18:38
and they would whip it so fast that it
18:40
would break the sound barrier little
18:41
sonic boom created um and we know this
18:44
apparently according to scientists
18:46
because they've been doing these
18:48
computer simulations where they've been
18:49
recreating the dinosaurs and one of the
18:52
consequences of putting this thing
18:54
together the simulation is that when the
18:56
dinosaurs tailed this movement it moved
18:58
at such a speed that it breaks a sound
19:00
barrier so obviously it's hypothetical
19:02
we don't have diplodocuses to check it
19:04
out but supposedly they broke the sound
19:06
barrier i just i find something crazy
19:08
that something that large because you i
19:10
think i i think unless i've made it up
19:12
there are a few sort of smaller animals
19:14
that can break the sound barrier but
19:16
outside of that i've never heard of
19:17
something natural a living thing
19:18
breaking the sound barrier
19:20
isn't the there's a is the shrimp does
19:23
that yeah monty shrimp yes
19:25
but it does it itself doesn't move
19:27
faster than the sound barrier it creates
19:29
clicks with its claws and it creates a
19:30
bubble which breaks the sound barrier is
19:32
that correct yeah that sounds about
19:34
right okay so then that shouldn't count
19:36
so yeah yeah in terms of the animal
19:37
moving itself yeah yeah um it's
19:40
fantastic and it's a diplodocus i mean
19:42
that's well i think it's diplodocus
19:43
isn't it well ah
19:46
i say diplodocus
19:48
a lot of people say diplodocus and
19:50
that's the american pronunciation two
19:52
scientists around here saying yeah but
19:54
dan's seen jurassic park a lot i would
19:56
trust exactly as judgment well because
19:59
the word diplodocus was invented by an
20:02
american uh and he pronounced it the
20:04
podicus i think we were supposed to
20:05
pronounce it diplodocus but actually i
20:08
do concede that diplodocus is a nicer
20:11
word well there's a bbc news
20:13
correspondent called susan ray and she
20:15
went round serving what people
20:18
thought it was oh yeah amongst academics
20:20
to get
20:21
the best understanding of it and what
20:23
she actually came out with i think there
20:25
was a definitive answer but i got more
20:26
interested in this sideline thing she
20:28
found out which is that there's actually
20:29
four pronunciations of it so it's not
20:32
just the two that we know okay um
20:34
there's a dip load
20:36
us
20:37
that's how i say it yeah yeah that's
20:40
speed as well
20:42
is there a diplodocus uh oh yeah yeah
20:45
yeah diplod a cuss yeah so that one as
20:48
well that's the fourth yeah i meant to
20:49
die plod a curse yeah
20:52
but that would imply there's a there's a
20:53
single animal called a plodicus which is
20:55
twice as big
20:58
yeah so there's four pronunciations
21:00
apparently what was the fourth one uh i
21:02
think the one i just said diplo doke yes
21:09
so this was by a bbc journalist yeah due
21:11
to the unique way that bbc is funded we
21:13
now know that we now know there are four
21:15
but dan hasn't told us which is the
21:17
right one well as i said i got so
21:18
interested in the four pronunciations i
21:20
didn't look into the
21:21
into the one that actually won and it
21:23
was named after andrew carnegie one of
21:25
the first dinosaur specimens was andrew
21:27
diplodocus carnegie
21:32
um yeah no the one of the most wealthy
21:34
men ever yeah can you explain how that
21:36
was named after him though uh well it
21:39
was called diplodocus carnegie the first
21:41
specimen yeah the scientific name it was
21:43
given yeah yeah and uh he invested a lot
21:45
of money i think he gave dippy the
21:47
diplodocus to the natural history museum
21:49
the plaster cast okay it was him who
21:51
presented that yeah yeah and he he was
21:53
very instrumental in spreading the
21:55
amazing news about this dinosaur around
21:57
the world he was fascinated by them yeah
21:59
that's it
22:00
just speaking of dippy um so dippy
22:02
obviously originally had uh a different
22:05
tale i think it was um on the ground and
22:08
then they realized that uh diplodocuses
22:11
probably had them raised up so they had
22:13
to redo it um so they had to do
22:15
remolding of it so the person who did
22:18
the
22:19
molding of it was the same guy who did
22:21
jabba the hutt for
22:23
return of the jedi really his name is
22:26
john coppinger that's a great thing it's
22:28
really cool yeah
22:29
i know this because uh someone we work
22:31
with steve uh helped uh to work on it so
22:33
this guy not only did dippy but he did
22:36
jabba the hutts and he did a lot of the
22:37
aliens in uh fifth element and and harry
22:40
potter and so on i love the aliens in
22:42
harry potter it was so good
22:45
it was a curveball but it was it was it
22:47
was the right moment
22:48
[Laughter]
22:51
um
22:52
i've got a dinosaur naming story um
22:54
which is that it was a couple years ago
22:55
a
22:56
new species completely new species of
23:00
pterosaur has been named after a
23:02
nine-year-old girl who found the
23:04
fossilized bones on a beach in the isle
23:06
of wight and the species is called uh
23:10
vector draco which means pterosaur means
23:13
dragon from the isle of wight um and the
23:15
second word is daisy morrissey because
23:17
her name is daisy morris and so she's a
23:20
nine-year-old girl who has a dinosaur
23:21
named after because she found the bones
23:23
she collected them up she handed them in
23:25
that's very cool best bit about this
23:27
when she actually found them she was
23:28
only four years old
23:30
wow and she started fossil hunting at
23:32
age three i've been looking for fossils
23:34
in the isle of wight as well and i've
23:35
never found any pterosaurs because
23:37
bloody daisy morrison got there first
23:40
she's had years head start she's been
23:41
going for like 10 years yeah but i'm a
23:43
lot older than her my eyesight might not
23:45
be as good as it used to be i think
23:47
she's closer to the ground
23:49
you can't move as fast on the uncertain
23:51
terrain james
23:53
yeah i was reading about the sound
23:54
barrier and breaking the sound barrier
23:56
yeah the first man to break the sound
23:57
barrier is still alive which i did not
23:59
know chucky yeager yeah great name
24:01
that's an amazing name and he was 24
24:03
when he became the first man to break
24:05
the sound barrier it's really that's
24:07
he's 89 now he's 92 92 yeah um and
24:12
because he used to be a fighter pilot he
24:13
thought uh it flew in the second world
24:15
war and he had amazing adventures as you
24:18
would expect because he was a fighter
24:20
pilot yeah and i was just reading this
24:21
is all very probably this is on the
24:22
wikipedia about him he on the 12th of
24:24
october 1944 he downed five enemy
24:27
aircraft in a single mission which is
24:28
good i believe um like you saying you
24:31
would expect it with him being a fighter
24:33
pilot you would be the worst audience
24:35
for his stories with you he's like i was
24:37
in the war and i shot down all these
24:38
enemies you're like well i would expect
24:40
that you're a fighter pilot
24:43
i want to tell you what happened on the
24:44
10th of october 1944. so this is the
24:46
exact sentence two of these kills out of
24:49
five in a day two of these kills were
24:51
scored without firing a single shot when
24:53
he flew into firing position against a
24:55
messerschmitt 109 the pilots of the
24:57
aircraft panicked breaking to starboard
24:59
and colliding with his wingman
25:00
whoa
25:01
how cool is that you just have to turn
25:04
and face yeah yeah yeah they both
25:05
parachuted out so they survived he's um
25:08
so 92 i uh i follow him on facebook he's
25:11
very active facebook user yeah yeah
25:13
chuck yeager loves facebook that's
25:15
amazing breaking the social media
25:17
barrier
25:17
[Laughter]
25:20
wasn't there supposedly a story about
25:22
was it kittenger or someone who maybe
25:24
broke the sound barrier before him uh
25:26
doing a freefall from extremely
25:28
extremely high uh and the idea being
25:31
that he um went so fast and with the air
25:34
being so thin up there the soundbar is a
25:36
bit a bit less uh that maybe he did
25:39
break the sound barrier wow there are
25:41
loads of earlier claims or people and
25:43
they didn't have very accurate
25:44
instruments and things like that um also
25:46
the last time that chuck jaeger broke
25:48
the sound barrier was on the 50th
25:50
anniversary of the first time he flew a
25:52
plane at the age of 74 past mac one
25:55
there's a picture of him sitting in it
25:56
uh you know on his facebook page you can
25:58
see that
26:00
yeah i'm gonna go and poke him after
26:01
this podcast
26:03
um we were talking on last week's
26:05
podcast about the concord and so that
26:08
obviously breaks the sound barrier and
26:09
you pointed out andy that they're not
26:11
allowed to do it over
26:12
cities and i had no idea it's because
26:14
the the boom is so great that it would
26:16
actually just be incredibly noisy but
26:19
actually it goes beyond noise there was
26:20
a accidental sonic boom a sound barrier
26:23
breaking that happened um
26:25
and what how do you pronounce this place
26:27
i know it's aberystwyth the aberist
26:29
width there are actually four ways of
26:30
pronouncing it
26:32
it was a
26:33
wrist
26:36
so um a jet was flying over and it broke
26:39
the sound barrier and it was so loud
26:41
that everyone thought that a bomb had
26:43
gone off windows in shops shattered wow
26:46
like just blew out completely people
26:49
were terrified and they genuinely
26:51
thought something had exploded that's
26:53
incredible that's amazing yeah night
26:55
shift worker greg babalicki said i was
26:58
just falling asleep and the sonic boom
26:59
happened keep it down please
27:01
[Laughter]
27:04
isn't that what happened with the
27:06
meteorite in chelebinsk as well it broke
27:08
the sound barrier and it caused a
27:09
massive kind of smashing of windows and
27:11
stuff wow
27:13
so when the dinosaurs were wiped out
27:15
allegedly by this giant meteor were they
27:17
all just like wow those diplodocus
27:23
[Applause]
27:24
[Music]
27:26
okay time for our final fact of the show
27:28
and that is andrew hunter murray my fact
27:30
is that more and more scientists are
27:32
describing their findings as astounding
27:35
right
27:36
so this is a study of scientific papers
27:38
from the last 40 odd years
27:41
and it's by
27:42
the researchers at the university
27:44
medical center of utrecht utrecht in the
27:47
netherlands there are actually four
27:48
different ways of pronouncing that
27:50
um and so they found that in scientific
27:53
papers that are published more and more
27:55
researchers and scientists are putting
27:57
positive words uh like novel or amazing
28:00
or spectacular into descriptions of
28:02
their works and they're also using other
28:04
descriptive words more a bit more so
28:06
amazing assuring astonishing bright
28:08
creative encouraging enormous excellent
28:11
groundbreaking innovative phenomenal uh
28:14
reassuring
28:16
and robust and spectacular and unique
28:18
and unprecedented a novel
28:20
the word novel now appears in uh seven
28:22
percent of papers in pubmed which is
28:25
this huge online database of papers and
28:27
the researchers have uh jokingly said
28:29
that at this rate every paper will be
28:31
described as that by the year 2123
28:34
there was a guy who wrote a book about
28:36
weird newspaper articles from like the
28:39
19th century and he i think searched for
28:42
a singular coincidence
28:44
or a singular example of something um
28:47
which obviously should mean it only ever
28:48
happened once but they used it all the
28:50
time in victorian times that's great
28:52
yeah who was saying was it some one of
28:54
you who was saying about sherlock holmes
28:55
uh stories the other day i was talking
28:57
to someone about this and they pointed
28:58
out that every single sherlock holmes
29:00
story starts with uh watson saying in
29:02
all the cases we ever dealt with this
29:04
was the most singular the most
29:08
so there are a couple of flaws in this
29:10
study because it's just picked it's
29:11
based on certain words so it doesn't
29:13
take into account all language but they
29:15
do think that it genuinely highlights an
29:17
actual problem with scientific language
29:19
but is it a problem is it a problem that
29:22
scientific papers are using the language
29:26
of discovery for their discoveries yes i
29:29
i'm on your side actually like i read a
29:31
headline that was scientists left and
29:33
then this is the quote gobsmacked by
29:36
astounding pluto images
29:38
so yeah you would be gobsmacked and
29:40
astounded by pluto images
29:42
yeah but i don't think you would be if
29:44
you had sent a camera to look at pluto
29:47
it's still it would be gobsmacked if
29:49
you'd never sent a camera to pluto the
29:50
images are right
29:53
this is typical of you andy
29:56
well you would expect that you work with
29:58
pluto
30:00
so the word astounding comes from
30:02
thunder toneray and it means like to
30:04
leave something thunderstruck where does
30:06
the word gobsmacked come from
30:08
uh i think it's just being smacked in
30:09
the gob
30:12
there's another cool thing about
30:13
scientific language so they they've uh
30:16
it's analyzing scientific language
30:17
looking at word frequencies and things
30:19
there was a scientist called diedrich
30:21
staple who got the nickname the lying
30:23
dutchman
30:25
because
30:27
in 2011 he admitted that he made up a
30:29
lot of data he's a psychology
30:32
researcher and researchers at cornell
30:34
university in new york looked at his
30:36
papers and they knew which ones were
30:38
fake and which ones the data was uh fake
30:40
in which it was real and they worked out
30:43
that he used more science-related terms
30:45
to describe his methods when he was
30:48
writing up fraudulent findings and when
30:50
he was writing up real ones so they can
30:52
identify to 70
30:54
accuracy which so there's a long way to
30:56
go but they can identify when he's lying
30:58
which is interesting so if that could be
31:00
rolled out to other forms of language
31:01
that would be amazing forensic
31:02
linguistics yeah
31:04
that is fascinating because there are
31:05
certain like tricks i don't i don't know
31:07
the more like in interrogation
31:09
where you can study not the content of
31:12
the responses but the word count of
31:16
responses it's a certain police
31:18
technique where you're not really
31:20
listening to the answers but you're
31:21
listening to the number of repeated
31:23
words
31:24
they're using and it's actually they say
31:26
i did it i did that i did it i did it i
31:28
did it
31:30
no it's because if you if you were at a
31:33
scene and you were actually there then
31:35
you don't have to draw on your
31:37
imagination as much so you use a a
31:39
different
31:40
first circle control the kind of
31:42
repetition of language there was a
31:44
scientific paper with no words in it
31:47
that i found
31:48
it was by a guy a clinical psychologist
31:50
called dennis upper um which he wrote or
31:54
didn't write in 1974 and it was called
31:56
the unsuccessful self-treatment of a
31:59
case of writer's block
32:02
that's the scientific equivalent of john
32:04
cage's four minutes though yeah
32:07
nice that's great you can instead of
32:09
like in for 4 30. you talked about this
32:11
the other day you talked about 433 and
32:13
how it's about the audience noise and
32:15
the orchestra noise or the penis noise
32:16
is that just reading that paper you just
32:19
as a scientist have the internal
32:21
thoughts
32:22
of
32:23
disappointment yeah you project onto it
32:26
you basically
32:28
yeah wow
32:29
wow that's really cool i went on to um
32:32
google news and looked for the word
32:34
astounding um to see what people are
32:36
describing as astounding at the moment
32:38
um it's astounding that 10 households in
32:41
western superman still watch black and
32:43
white telly according to one the most
32:45
recent headline i found see there we are
32:47
i'm not astounded are you not i'm i'm
32:50
intrigued yeah
32:52
i thought that word was going to be
32:54
indifferent came out
32:56
was much more interesting yeah i mean
32:58
those must be a rarity now and i'm sure
32:59
the sets have a certain value to a
33:01
collector or a connoisseur and you pay a
33:04
cheaper license fee yes you do great
33:07
yeah the next astounding uh news story i
33:10
found was officer hands out an
33:11
astounding 19 000 parking tickets in a
33:14
year now that is astounding yeah i'm
33:17
surprised that you wouldn't say well you
33:18
would expect that he's a parking plan
33:22
and then the third one that i found was
33:24
it's astounding seven black and white tv
33:27
licenses are currently in force in ponte
33:29
pred wow so it's the word astounding
33:32
outside science papers is mostly used to
33:34
describe tv
33:36
now that
33:37
[Laughter]
33:40
[Applause]
33:40

00:05
[Music]
00:10
[Applause]
00:16
and welcome to another episode of no
00:19
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:21
coming to you from the up the creek
00:23
comedy club in greenwich my name is dan
00:25
schreiber i'm sitting here next to anna
00:26
chazinski andy murray and james harkin
00:29
once again we have sat around the
00:30
microphones with our four favorite facts
00:32
from the last seven days and in no
00:34
particular order here we go
00:37
okay time for fact number one and that's
00:39
my fact my fact this week is that even
00:41
though we're not sure it exists the new
00:44
planet planet number nine is the most
00:46
planety planet of all the planets
00:48
[Laughter]
00:51
so this is this is a major discovery
00:53
that we found yeah a new planet didn't
00:55
find or didn't find either way it's big
00:58
news yeah we think it exists because of
01:00
computer modelling um they've modeled
01:02
the the solar system they think this
01:04
thing exists uh it's absolutely massive
01:06
and one thing that uh is very important
01:09
with planets is that it clears out the
01:11
area of its orbit so there aren't other
01:13
things going around with it and they
01:14
think according to their calculations
01:16
this planet has done that more than any
01:17
other planet and that's what makes it
01:19
the most planetee planet of all the
01:20
planets
01:21
according to the guy who discovered it
01:23
uh or one of the two guys who discovered
01:25
it dr brown right so the planetee planet
01:28
is a planet that no other things want to
01:30
be close to really right well if that's
01:33
the case then i am atlantic planet
01:38
i read a description of it that it was
01:40
almost certain to be a fifth member of
01:42
the jupiter saturn uranus neptune
01:44
quartet so it's like the fifth beetle
01:46
but it's like the fifth beetle was cast
01:48
into deep space
01:49
um
01:50
yeah the really cool thing about the new
01:52
planet is uh you may have seen this in
01:53
the news it the man who discovered it
01:55
one of the two guys who wrote the paper
01:57
on it is the same man who killed pluto
02:00
yeah wow
02:01
[Music]
02:03
it's like a grudge match
02:05
it's so exciting his twitter account is
02:07
at plutokiller yeah isn't it no it's
02:10
actually yeah and he says he still gets
02:12
um
02:15
he gets abused from he gets letters and
02:17
obscene phone calls from people who miss
02:19
pluto
02:22
he said this is these are his exact
02:24
words he said i got hate mail from young
02:26
children for many years
02:28
and he doesn't get any more now because
02:30
young children these days know that
02:31
pluto is no longer a planet pluto was
02:33
named by a child wasn't it what's that
02:35
yeah by an eleven-year-old girl venetian
02:38
i read such a nice interview with her uh
02:40
which was about five years ago i think
02:42
about how exciting it was that she'd
02:44
named pluto and the interviewer kept on
02:46
asking her why she'd named it pluto it
02:48
was a nasa interview the national
02:49
interviewer said uh and you thought
02:51
about it because of the greek and roman
02:52
mythology about pluto being the god of
02:54
the underworld yes
02:55
no no i don't think it was as subtle as
02:57
that no it was just a name i knew hadn't
02:59
been used okay but it was also because
03:01
the first two letters pl have a
03:03
connection with percival lowell
03:06
no no i certainly didn't realize that i
03:08
appreciated it
03:09
[Laughter]
03:13
give me something
03:14
she got five pounds for that but they
03:16
took that five pounds off when they
03:18
demoted it from the planet
03:22
no
03:25
she said she was in her late 80s when it
03:27
was demoted and they asked her about it
03:29
at the time she said at my age i've been
03:31
largely indifferent to the debate
03:32
[Laughter]
03:35
she's just saying that to hide all the
03:36
hate mail she's been sending to mike
03:38
brown
03:41
and so they're going to come up with a
03:42
new name for this planet and they don't
03:44
know what they're going to call it yet
03:45
so the working name is george isn't it
03:48
oh is it no that's quite nice because we
03:50
almost did have a planet called george
03:51
uranus was called george oh it was
03:53
called george and they said that's a
03:54
ridiculousness
03:56
and then they said let's go with uranus
03:58
and it was going to be named george
04:01
after king george the third and then
04:03
they said no why did they say nice
04:04
kingdom to third was it after a living
04:06
all the other planets were named after
04:08
roman gods and suddenly some [ __ ]
04:10
kings got not named after me
04:15
um so mike brown and um his friend
04:18
constantine battigan
04:20
who's the other person who's kind of
04:21
found this one uh their working name for
04:24
it is planet fatty okay
04:26
they said that they're going to call it
04:28
planet fatty because it's 1990 slang for
04:30
something that's cool
04:32
but i went on to urban dictionary
04:36
and fatty does not mean cool
04:39
it means something that i really cannot
04:41
say on this stage
04:42
really yeah something very rude indeed
04:45
wow yeah fatty with a ph oh yeah so
04:48
james you think another news story
04:50
that's going to come up is that pluto is
04:51
going to be renamed to planet uh i think
04:53
it will do in the next couple of years
04:54
what
04:55
i think what will happen in the next
04:57
couple of years is that
04:58
[Laughter]
05:01
i'm going to get a lot of hate mail for
05:03
this
05:04
give me a stamp
05:06
but it's i thought the thing was it's so
05:08
tiny and there are so many hundreds of
05:09
other objects which is the same thing
05:11
all the other hundreds will get cold
05:12
planets as well no way that's my guess
05:14
you know so much more memorizing to do
05:16
in year nine at school
05:18
two thousand
05:20
came all the planets well how long have
05:22
you got
05:23
i was um reading about the current
05:24
status of pluto's current official name
05:27
is asteroid number one three four three
05:29
four oh which is a long way from fallen
05:31
yeah why did they call it that was it
05:33
because it's like an asteroid it's named
05:36
after the ancient greek god 13434
05:40
um
05:41
some of the names that they maybe um
05:43
some people have suggested names on
05:44
twitter and whatever for this new planet
05:46
um minerva persephone nix who's the
05:49
goddess of the night is quite a good one
05:52
um some people have said bowie because
05:54
of the timing of that
05:56
and the first person to suggest this one
05:58
which is my favorite was at ted vogel
06:00
underscore wilson
06:02
and he thinks it should be called pluto
06:06
very nice that's a good name that's very
06:08
good i think we should have more puns in
06:10
the skies
06:12
so um there's been other news this week
06:14
which has been really exciting in uh in
06:16
sort of nasa news space news uh which is
06:18
i i saw an article about scott kelly
06:20
who's been up there now 300 days and he
06:22
was celebrating for 300 days of being in
06:25
the wake
06:27
up there it immediately started
06:28
celebrating
06:30
am i in space guys well actually this
06:32
it's weird you guys bring that up they
06:34
now factor in ordness uh when astronauts
06:37
go up so tim peake when he went out on
06:39
his first ever eva when he went outside
06:41
the ship they didn't use they used to
06:43
have a really tight schedule go straight
06:44
here they now factor in time because any
06:46
astronaut who would go outside would
06:48
find themselves just going oh my god i'm
06:50
hanging in space i'm looking at the
06:52
planet earth and they never factored in
06:53
time for that so they've now given all
06:55
time where you can just go oh and then
06:59
and then get on with your work so all
07:01
time is now a thing so that's great uh
07:03
but yeah so um so he's up there he's
07:05
with this guy scott kelly who's been up
07:07
there 300 days and scott kelly made this
07:09
clip to celebrate it by showing how you
07:11
play ping-pong in space and what they do
07:13
is they have these little bats that are
07:14
built to move water and so you this is
07:17
just as a practical thing in space and
07:19
so what they do is they play ping pong
07:21
using a droplet of water and you just
07:23
hit a droplet of water over and it heads
07:25
that way and then you hit it back he was
07:26
playing on his own i don't think it's
07:28
caught on as a game yeah
07:29
up in the iss
07:31
but while i was watching this video it
07:33
was really interesting because he's
07:34
playing and he's talking about it and i
07:35
noticed as i was watching it that he's
07:37
wearing a belt i'm like why are you
07:39
wearing a belt in space
07:41
like that's not that's not going
07:42
anywhere so i could i i googled it and i
07:45
i was looking why why wear a belt in
07:47
space and it turns out you wear a belt
07:48
in space to stop your trousers from
07:50
falling up
07:55
and we need to move on to our next fact
07:57
in a second anyone got anything else
07:58
before we do
08:00
just one last thing on mike brown the
08:01
the astronomer at the center of all of
08:03
this um i just love the title of his
08:05
2010 book on the whole mata it is how i
08:08
killed pluto
08:09
and why it had it coming
08:16
okay it's time for our second fact of
08:18
the show and that is james harkin okay
08:20
my fact this week is that the first use
08:22
of the word snowmageddon
08:24
came in the same press release as the
08:27
first apology for the use of the word
08:29
snowman
08:32
um i because of all the snow in america
08:34
i thought i'd see like the history of
08:35
snowmageddon and i found a use in 2008
08:39
it was a press release from the canadian
08:40
government and they said about how it's
08:42
known again and then right at the end in
08:44
a very canadian way they say we're sorry
08:46
we're not trying to like take the mickey
08:48
and say that it's not very important it
08:50
is important sorry about stuff again no
08:51
we're really sorry
08:55
and then the snowmageddon was kind of
08:57
not used that much for a couple of years
08:59
and then into that this was in 2008 and
09:01
in 2010 they had a massive storm in um
09:04
washington dc and that's when
09:05
snowmageddon really took off right and
09:08
according to wikipedia there was a few
09:09
other things snowzilla within a few
09:11
hours of snowmageddon and apparently
09:14
that storm also popularized the term
09:17
kaiser snowsay
09:21
this latest storm has it's uh produced a
09:23
thing uh because you've got you guys i'm
09:25
sure have all seen all the enormous uh
09:26
snowfall in on the east coast of america
09:28
it's been thundersnow is what's been
09:31
produced
09:32
oh yeah scott scott kelly tweeted it
09:35
scott kelly who is on the um
09:37
international space station i think that
09:38
was how we found out or he very early on
09:41
what was happening he tweeted
09:42
thundersnow and because he's obviously
09:43
such a knowledgeable guy he said this is
09:45
unbelievably rare by the way guys and
09:47
it's it's even more rare that i'm seeing
09:49
it from the other side of it
09:51
um
09:52
but yeah it's super rare isn't it
09:54
so it's where a storm instead of
09:55
producing rain produces snow because of
09:57
the different way the air rubs together
09:58
or something
10:00
so
10:02
some nerdy [ __ ] and we're not gonna
10:05
give the time to i think when a cloud
10:07
produces snow instead of rain it's
10:09
usually just because it's cold
10:12
you can blind me with all the
10:13
meteorology
10:16
i read today i had no idea about this
10:18
it snows on mars so it's not your
10:21
classic snow it's not your like
10:23
it's not like snow but like they
10:25
[Music]
10:26
but they call it like it's kind of like
10:28
a big cold that falls from the sky
10:30
exactly and so the mars rover uh was
10:32
looking up don't know why it was just
10:34
looking up and it could see there's snow
10:36
coming down and it was having all time
10:39
[Laughter]
10:44
wow wow wow
10:46
[Laughter]
10:49
but so mars has the craziest of
10:51
atmospheres there's there's spots in
10:52
mars in the same this was the article
10:54
that i was reading and told me this you
10:55
if you stood in a certain spot of mars
10:57
your feet could be 21 degrees but your
11:00
chest would be zero degrees yeah that's
11:02
how the difference between down there
11:04
because the atmosphere there's so little
11:06
atmosphere here to get out of the
11:07
atmosphere you have to go really really
11:09
high but there by the you know by your
11:10
chest you wouldn't be in the atmosphere
11:12
anymore so it'd be really really cold
11:14
actually speaking of hot and cold um i
11:16
was reading so um something that's
11:18
happening uh to go back to space news is
11:20
the kepler space telescope that was sent
11:22
out a few years ago as due back or back
11:25
this year i think and so that's found
11:27
tons of new planets and one of the
11:28
planets it's found is this planet called
11:30
gliase 581c and what nasa says about
11:33
that is uh so it's tidally locked so
11:36
that basically means that it doesn't
11:38
really rotate so half of it is one half
11:41
of it is scorching hot while the other
11:43
half is constantly frozen
11:45
it is believed to be the best candidate
11:47
for human expansion
11:51
um so the the current storms in america
11:54
um there is a guy who's capitalizing on
11:56
them at the moment he started it last
11:57
year it's a business called
12:00
shipsnowyow.com
12:02
uh he's called kyle waring and you can
12:05
buy snow in a box from him
12:07
and he sends it over and he keeps it
12:09
cool so how does he make sure it doesn't
12:10
melt
12:12
uh he packs it in it's like an esky he
12:15
packs it in an esky yeah so he's hold it
12:16
over it and there's an extra australian
12:18
word for like a fridge yeah it's like
12:20
really it's like if you're going to the
12:22
beach and you're bringing some bottles
12:23
and you're just gonna sit there and down
12:24
some tinnies it's that kind of thing
12:26
it's weird because when the australian
12:27
comes out in you
12:29
it really comes out yeah
12:31
i'm an aussie by the way i just don't
12:33
sound it um so just very just quickly
12:35
following up on this he offers if by the
12:38
time your uh your esky's arrived and
12:40
your snow's melted he offers you a
12:42
refund and he'll send you a whole new
12:43
batch of uh
12:45
there's also someone capitalized so
12:46
quite a few people have made it even
12:48
though a lot of people are in serious
12:49
trouble a lot of people actually are
12:50
quite comfortable and having a lot of
12:52
fun with it people are making bars out
12:53
of the snow and and serving drinks there
12:55
yeah they sold tons of extra booze
12:57
didn't they as soon as they knew the
12:58
storm was coming they just like went to
13:00
the shops and bought as much booze as
13:02
they could possibly yeah and someone on
13:04
airbnb put up an igloo that they've
13:06
built
13:06
[Laughter]
13:08
ten dollars a night you can rent the
13:10
igloo you've got to bring your own
13:11
sleeping bag um but it's suddenly so
13:14
since reading the article it's been
13:15
updated the article and it's now no
13:17
longer on airbnb they're not sure if it
13:19
was banned or if it melted
13:22
um so on
13:23
naming storms this storm doesn't need a
13:26
name and the weather channel i think is
13:28
against the u.s weather channel why
13:29
doesn't it need a name because you only
13:31
name so a snowstorm is not a finite
13:34
thing it's just i think one
13:35
meteorologist i was reading said it's
13:37
just an extension of normal weather so
13:40
something
13:41
everything's just an extension of normal
13:43
there's no supernatural weather
13:45
which
13:46
no something like a cyclone has a very
13:48
finite start and finish
13:50
exactly where it started and exactly
13:52
when it finished um so they need names
13:54
uh but storms don't but uh the weather
13:58
channel has announced the storm names
14:00
for 2016.
14:02
and they are things like ajax so there's
14:05
gonna be a storm called ajax kyla uh quo
14:08
as in status and
14:10
zandor waylon and yolo
14:16
[Music]
14:19
well you only die once
14:22
um there's a paper in um in canada that
14:24
came out this week that warned people
14:27
against eating snow
14:29
because apparently snow is really good
14:31
at collecting uh kind of bits from car
14:34
exhausts or kind of bits of toxins from
14:36
the air snow is really really good at
14:38
picking it up and so if you kind of take
14:40
a little bit of scoop of snow from the
14:42
ground like a lot of people do and just
14:43
kind of eat some of it yeah like
14:44
everyone does
14:46
it's snowing tonight we eat
14:48
[Laughter]
14:52
the south korean government a few years
14:54
ago made an explicit thing to people
14:56
saying you must not eat yellow snow
14:59
there was an actual press release saying
15:01
you must not eat yellow snow and that's
15:03
because they'd had this snow that had
15:04
come which was yellow and it had like
15:06
heavy minerals and stuff from some power
15:08
stations oh really oh wow and so that's
15:10
the one reason that you should never eat
15:12
yellow snow
15:14
minerals from power stations
15:17
uh we're gonna have to move on
15:19
yeah um
15:20
just before we end i i read one thing
15:22
which is a new theory that's erupted
15:24
this week uh penguins they think may
15:27
uh
15:29
i mean
15:30
there are so many qualifications in this
15:32
already
15:36
you can you can get away with saying
15:37
anything at this point though so
15:40
penguins they think that they
15:44
think they may
15:46
possibly
15:49
when they're about to mate they uh will
15:53
need a nice wait is this the day who
15:55
think this
15:56
no this is the penguin no the penguins
15:59
if it's true know it's it's absolutely
16:01
like so they think that the penguins are
16:03
like oh we need somewhere to have a good
16:05
time why not here but oh it's really
16:07
it's really cold and icy and snowy so
16:09
they'll poo on it and then the poo melts
16:12
the snow and then they go now that's
16:14
where we have sex
16:16
there's a new theory it's true that they
16:18
poo
16:25
and that is andrew hunter murray okay my
16:28
fact is that this week we have
16:30
discovered the largest prime number ever
16:32
we would have discovered it in september
16:34
but the computer which found it forgot
16:35
to tell anybody
16:36
[Laughter]
16:42
so this is a this has happened um so
16:45
there are computers all over the world
16:46
looking for new prime numbers and
16:48
they're up to really enormous ones now
16:50
and they're very useful in encrypting
16:52
stuff yeah they're called gimps
16:54
yeah yeah uh
16:55
something massive prime great internet
16:58
marzin which i think is yeah
17:00
prime search yeah
17:01
it's mercen primes so um these are prime
17:04
numbers named after a french guy called
17:05
mercen yeah and you can download a
17:08
computer program onto your computer and
17:10
it will look for these prime numbers and
17:12
if you find one then you get like 100
17:14
grand or something like that 100 000
17:17
and everyone a lot of people have put it
17:19
onto the computer but the people who
17:20
found it this week or um last year or
17:23
whenever it was um they have so much
17:25
computer processing power that they've
17:27
managed to find loads of them right yeah
17:29
i think they found like four of the last
17:30
five or something like that that's right
17:32
wow yeah um so the new one i'm gonna
17:35
read this out from here the new number
17:36
is five million digits longer than the
17:39
previous largest one
17:41
it's two to the power of 74 million two
17:44
hundred and seven thousand two hundred
17:45
and eighty one all of that minus one
17:48
yeah um and it's um if if you were if
17:51
you were going to write it out uh and
17:53
you could write ten digits in four
17:55
seconds this is a calculation by a new
17:56
york times correspondent it would take
17:58
you three months without slowing down
18:00
yeah it's got 22 million digits in it um
18:04
so my phone
18:06
[Laughter]
18:11
it starts
18:13
three seven six four ones stop me when
18:16
you get bored
18:17
and then it ends zero zero seven three
18:19
three nine one zero eight six four three
18:22
six three five one and um for people at
18:25
home so we've just given away the ending
18:26
there's no point in reading the middle
18:27
now
18:29
for people at home we edited out the
18:31
other 22 million i just didn't say um
18:33
and you can download the actual number
18:35
and get it on your computer and have a
18:37
look through it which i did great
18:41
um it contains my six-digit code to
18:44
access my bank account oh james don't
18:47
say that
18:48
people will know
18:50
it contains it 21 times wow
18:53
that's how big this number is it
18:55
contains my library number twice
18:57
and at one stage it has eight sevens in
18:59
a row so i'm just giving you the edited
19:01
highlights here
19:06
i was watching an interview with uh the
19:08
guy who uh discovered it or rather the
19:10
guy who set the computer up that
19:11
discovered it and um there was a moment
19:13
that like this is amazing this is the
19:15
big new prime number it's beyond any
19:16
that we've had before what can we do
19:18
with it he was like we have no idea
19:20
literally nothing it has no point
19:21
there's no person
19:23
so most of them could be used for
19:24
encrypting things on computers yeah
19:25
unfortunately this one is now such a
19:27
global celebrity
19:29
that it will be noticed immediately by
19:31
hackers so if you have several million
19:32
digits the thing is you you get prime
19:35
you use prime numbers in encryption by
19:36
get taking two prime numbers multiplying
19:39
them together and then is finding the
19:41
factors of that secondary number now if
19:43
you have a number which has got 23 24
19:46
million digits in you know that one of
19:48
them must be this number so everyone
19:50
knows that it must be this one so it's
19:52
really easy to crack so the only time
19:54
this will be useful is when we get some
19:55
even bigger numbers that we can use
19:57
which we will do one day yeah right i
20:00
like that um i've never heard prime
20:01
numbers described like this but they're
20:03
the building blocks of maths really and
20:05
they're the equivalent of atoms in
20:07
science because prime numbers are
20:09
because nothing goes into them
20:10
everything else is a factor um of uh
20:13
something else so everything else can be
20:14
split up but you can't split up a prime
20:16
number like that the equivalent of an
20:17
atom and something else i didn't know
20:18
about prime numbers because you think
20:20
that they're kind of so randomly
20:22
distributed if we've taken this long to
20:24
work out what you know the pattern is is
20:26
that all prime numbers if you square
20:29
them are a multiple of 24 and then
20:32
adding one now you just write that down
20:36
not the really small one
20:39
yeah
20:40
anything over seven is
20:42
oh god we're gonna go through them all
20:45
eleven is thirteen
20:47
[Laughter]
20:53
yeah so they found this using the gimp's
20:55
um the software and this is the weird
20:58
thing the weird thing about gimps
21:00
is
21:02
if you go up to google and type the word
21:04
gimps into google
21:07
all of the first five things that you
21:08
get are about this prime number thing
21:11
uh the same is not true of google images
21:18
um this is amazing so cicadas you know
21:20
there's that kind of cicada in north
21:22
america which only comes up to the
21:24
surface and freezes
21:26
well in it's every prime number of years
21:29
so in some places it's every 13 years in
21:30
some places every 17 years in some
21:32
places another prime number of years and
21:35
which sounds ridiculous but uh it was
21:37
hypothesized in the article i read that
21:39
that actually does make sense because if
21:41
you come up in a prime number of years
21:43
you have the least chance of coinciding
21:45
with predators which also have like
21:47
periodical patterns because so let's say
21:50
you come up every eight years then if
21:52
you're hunted by a panther that appears
21:54
every two years then they're going to
21:55
bump into you a lot but if you're coming
21:57
up every prime number of years then
21:59
you're not going to bump into the
22:00
predators every prime number of years do
22:02
you think there's a cicada that comes up
22:04
every two to the 74 million
22:06
years and the only reason we haven't
22:08
seen it is because you know you'd be
22:10
pretty lucky to see that when you yeah i
22:12
don't know what a cigar is it's it's a
22:13
little insect okay
22:15
yeah like a cricket got it uh cicada
22:17
fact there's only one cicada in the uk
22:19
uh one species of cicadas
22:21
oh
22:24
lonesome trevor
22:27
there's only one species of cicada in
22:29
the uk it's called the new forest cicada
22:32
and we think they live in the new forest
22:33
but they might have died out because no
22:34
one's seen one for about 10 years and
22:37
you should be able to hear the call but
22:39
you can't really hear it because it's
22:40
outside of human hearing range but you
22:42
can buy an app and the app can hear the
22:45
cicada call and so you can walk around
22:47
the new forest with your app listening
22:49
for cicadas and then if you find one
22:50
then you'll have discovered that they
22:52
still exist wow that'd be cool that's
22:54
great yeah yeah uh so i didn't find any
22:57
prime number stuff but i started looking
22:58
into numbers uh of the week and there's
23:00
a very famous setting there's gonna be a
23:02
long list
23:04
six um
23:06
no there was there was this week a set
23:08
of numbers which was there was this
23:10
massive lotto uh the big lottery draw
23:12
that went and there was a story about
23:13
this lady who thinks she's won the
23:15
lottery has found the ticket that she's
23:17
won with all the numbers but the bar
23:18
code is is missing put it in the washing
23:21
machine didn't you put in the washing
23:22
machine it's missing it's one of those
23:24
things where you think that must be the
23:26
worst situation right that you've won
23:27
the lottery and now you've not won it
23:29
because you've lost the thing so i was
23:32
looking into is that genuinely the worst
23:33
situation anyone's had in the lottery
23:36
and i found a guy that i think contends
23:39
yeah this guy won the lottery okay okay
23:41
but this is what led up to him winning
23:43
the lottery his name is fran seller he
23:45
was born in croatia he was a teacher he
23:47
was born in 1929 in 1962 his train
23:51
derailed and plunged into an icy river
23:53
and he managed to escape and not die the
23:56
next year in 1963 while flying the door
23:59
blew out and he got sucked out of the
24:01
plane and he survived oh god it was all
24:03
good
24:04
three years later in 1966 he's riding on
24:07
a bunch that's what he's riding on
24:10
it's australia it's an australian term
24:12
he's riding along the bench mike
24:15
whatever you do don't check that urban
24:17
dictionary when you get home
24:21
so he's riding on a bus and the bus
24:23
suddenly
24:24
[Laughter]
24:27
the bus plunges into a river
24:29
he gets out and survives so this is 1962
24:32
1963 1966 1970 does he he must take no
24:37
public transport by this point exactly
24:39
he's in his car
24:43
he's in his car and it just blows up in
24:45
flames
24:46
so he escapes and he's all right so
24:48
that's 1970 1973 he's still weary of
24:52
public transport in his car once again
24:54
another fire blows up in his car loses
24:56
all his hair manages to make it out
24:58
there's a whole nice period between 1973
25:00
and 1995 when nothing happens he stayed
25:03
at home
25:06
but then he went out and got hit by a
25:07
bus so that's 1995 then in 1996
25:11
1996 he's back in his car he drove and
25:15
another either it was a trucker cars
25:16
coming towards him he swerves away he
25:18
manages to escape his car as it plunges
25:21
over a cliff lands in a tree and then
25:24
the car goes 300 feet down and breaks
25:26
into an icy river uh
25:29
in 2003 he won the lotto
25:32
one million
25:33
that was divine justice that's amazing i
25:36
think that's worse than losing your
25:37
ticket and not winning um there was a
25:40
couple there were two other very bad
25:42
lottery stories so uh one couple i think
25:43
this is actually last year uh edwina and
25:46
david nylon who uh had an app a lotto
25:48
app and they got the right numbers and
25:51
they sent them off in the app and they'd
25:53
won 35 million pounds and their app
25:55
broke uh and it failed so they had the
25:57
photographic evidence that they tried to
25:59
send it on the app and it only sent it
26:01
after the deadline because they ran out
26:02
of signals only they haven't been using
26:04
their phone to search for cicada noises
26:06
in the new forest
26:10
um okay let's move on to our final fact
26:12
of the show and that is chozinski uh yes
26:16
my fact is that in a press release about
26:19
the new english language test for
26:21
migrants the british government
26:23
misspelled the word language
26:25
[Laughter]
26:28
but yeah this is so that this has been a
26:29
you know a big story over the last few
26:31
weeks is the new test for migrants and
26:33
there's lots of controversy and people
26:36
even if they're on spousal visas if they
26:38
fail these language tests they might be
26:40
made to leave the country and it turns
26:42
out the people who are releasing the
26:43
press release spell language with the a
26:46
and the u the wrong way around there was
26:47
a very snotty reply from the government
26:50
the prime minister's official spokesman
26:51
said all of us are open to mistakes at
26:53
times the prime minister is fully
26:55
confident that his team speak english
26:57
competently
26:57
[Laughter]
27:01
touched a bit
27:06
um i went through i basically haven't
27:08
researched that much of this because i
27:09
just went through trying to find the
27:10
mistakes in all government um
27:14
over the last 50 years no i went well
27:16
first of all the independent put
27:17
together a list of 10 questions that are
27:19
taken from the government's list of
27:20
possible migrant language questions and
27:23
here's the independence introduction to
27:25
the questions listen to the sentence the
27:27
questions below have been taken from
27:28
practice exams for the b1 test that
27:31
those who need to prove their knowledge
27:32
of the english language to gain their
27:33
indefinite leave to remain
27:40
oh it's like a cliffhanger of a sentence
27:45
and then so one of the questions is
27:46
maybe i'm wrong about this but um
27:48
there's multiple choice questions and
27:50
it's a completely under this sentence so
27:52
one of them is have you finished with
27:53
the newspaper and it's a b c d and the
27:56
options are w
27:59
citizenship
28:01
yeah yeah to gain citizenship you have
28:02
to say whether you finished with the
28:03
newspaper
28:05
that's the only criteria just give the
28:07
freaking newspaper back you can come in
28:09
the country
28:11
no it's have you finished with a
28:12
newspaper and then it's what is the
28:13
grammatically correct ending to the
28:15
sentence have you finished with the
28:16
newspaper now still yet or already now
28:21
the answer they when i did the test yet
28:23
is the answer they want
28:24
already is completely correct yeah if
28:28
you want to be really passive
28:28
passive-aggressive about it yeah you
28:30
could say you finished with that
28:32
newspaper already well yeah
28:34
it's not that it's the opposite of that
28:35
it's so they want you to fall into the
28:37
trap of the um american you know have
28:39
you finished with a newspaper already
28:40
but you could also just ask a valid
28:42
question have you finished with the
28:43
newspaper already hasn't have you read
28:45
it that fast
28:46
have you finished the newspaper already
28:48
oh you're completely correct you could
28:50
also passive aggressively say well have
28:52
you finished with the newspaper now
29:00
doesn't make any sense that's really
29:02
funny yeah
29:03
so my wife who's russian she will have
29:06
to take these tests quite soon
29:08
and she was trying out some um questions
29:10
from the citizenship test which is like
29:12
a general knowledge test and um she
29:14
tried them out on me and literally i got
29:16
none of them right really yeah and my
29:18
general knowledge is not bad
29:20
all right i brought along one to test
29:21
you because i think your general
29:22
knowledge is quite good okay well one of
29:24
the ones that she was asked in the
29:26
practice test was what is the national
29:28
dish of wales
29:31
coal
29:33
coal oh yeah cool well you might think
29:35
that according to the government well
29:38
exactly but according to the government
29:39
it's welsh cakes
29:42
sorry fellas
29:44
sorry guys the home office will be
29:45
sending a van
29:50
well cakes yeah apparently welsh cakes
29:52
but the um the other thing is um if i
29:54
want to become a citizen of russia i
29:56
would have to take a russian language
29:58
test and the russian language test has
30:00
all the normal things that you would
30:01
expect but you also have to be able to
30:04
interpret hidden meanings
30:08
wow
30:09
that sounds cool
30:13
you know um bill bryson released a new
30:14
book uh the road to little dribbling
30:16
it's all in the beginning he talks about
30:18
taking a test to become a british
30:19
citizen he decided to become it and uh
30:21
he was saying that not only are there
30:23
mistakes in the test but in the books
30:25
that guide you into how to take the test
30:28
are just completely filled with mistakes
30:30
one that he pointed out was they were
30:31
talking about anthony hopkins and saying
30:33
that he's someone to be proud of as a
30:35
british person he's someone to be proud
30:36
of they spell his name wrong
30:39
and also he's taken up american
30:40
citizenship he's not british anyone
30:44
tina turner is swiss now
30:46
is she
30:47
wow
30:51
so i was looking into the news uh for
30:53
other language mess-ups over the last
30:55
week and i found one that happened in
30:57
sweden uh they were having at their
30:59
parliament a political debate about uh
31:02
very serious issues actually it was like
31:03
a really long debate they made a mistake
31:05
though of when they transmitted it they
31:07
put the wrong subtitles onto the uh the
31:10
debate so you had guys like uh jean
31:13
borglund who's the minister of education
31:16
looking really serious saying something
31:17
really serious but the subtitles reading
31:19
i will build the best sand castle in the
31:21
galaxy
31:25
i vote for him
31:28
and then you had stefan luffin the prime
31:30
minister the prime minister going the
31:33
latest invention the fantastic dinosaur
31:35
submarine
31:39
and then the minister for environment
31:41
going greetings earth creatures
31:46
i have two pairs of boots one red pair
31:48
and one yellow pair
31:50
which ones should i take
31:52
i'm going to ask my dolls
31:54
[Laughter]
31:57
[Music]
31:59
know where they got those original
32:00
subtitles
32:02
yeah it was it was a cartoon animation
32:05
it sounds great
32:07
um you know that uh godzilla has just
32:10
been awarded japanese citizenship
32:12
it was done as a press uh sort of press
32:15
pr stunt obviously but uh it was a
32:17
particular district of tokyo that he got
32:19
it uh shinjuku uh which is a very cool
32:21
extremely busy one i think that's it's
32:24
very near the famous crossing in tokyo
32:25
shibuya crossing but they released the
32:28
certificate which they'd done and it
32:29
said previous visits to shinjuku ward
32:32
three godzilla 1984
32:35
godzilla versus king ghidorah in 1991
32:37
and godzilla millennium 1999 those are
32:40
these trips very good uh we're gonna
32:42
have to wrap up in a sec so yeah
32:44
anything you wanna just you know to get
32:45
south korean citizenship uh the test
32:47
requires you to sing the first four
32:49
verses of the national anthem sing it in
32:51
tune wow yeah that's a tough gig isn't
32:54
it and the um dutch uh citizenship you
32:57
have to watch a video that includes
32:58
beach nudity what where where's the form
33:01
[Laughter]
33:04
do you know what i'll do it even if they
33:05
don't give me [ __ ]
33:09
it's because there's such a liberal
33:11
country they want to show you what to
33:13
expect if you come to the netherlands
33:15
yeah yeah like if people come from other
33:17
countries they're a bit more
33:18
conservative they might turn up into the
33:20
netherlands and think wow what's going
33:21
on here beach nudity
33:24
and so they want to show it so that
33:25
you're not shocked when you see it in
33:27
real life so can you fail that is it
33:29
like if you get an erection
33:30
or you cry then
33:35
feelings are confusing
33:41
that's it

[Music]
00:39
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:42
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:45
this week coming to you from the
00:46
birmingham mac my name is dan schreiber
00:48
and please welcome to the stage it's the
00:50
other three elves andy murray james
00:52
harkin and anna chazinski
00:54
[Applause]
01:01
and
01:02
once again we have gathered around the
01:04
microphones with our four favorite facts
01:06
from the last seven days and in no
01:07
particular order here we go starting
01:09
with you andrew hunter murray my fact
01:12
this week is that a new zealand firm has
01:14
developed an irrationally angry robot to
01:17
train telesales stuff
01:18
[Laughter]
01:21
so
01:21
so uh
01:23
so it calls the telesale staff yeah i
01:26
mean it has to be programmed to do it it
01:28
can't just rig you up at
01:30
nighttime or something okay right so
01:32
um
01:33
yeah the firm is called touchpoint and
01:35
basically they've developed this machine
01:37
which can simulate an angry customer and
01:40
um it takes data from all the worst
01:42
customer calls uh where people are
01:44
really furious and then they sort of
01:46
determine the factors which you know you
01:48
could be set off by and then the
01:50
telesales person who's being trained has
01:53
to try and calm the machine down
01:57
for that
01:58
yeah
01:59
do we know how the anger manifests
02:01
itself does it start attack physically
02:03
physically
02:05
it's nothing physical it's mind games
02:08
passive aggressiveness
02:10
how twisted are people i think it's a
02:12
lot of shouting and insults basically
02:14
from the computer yeah does it sound
02:16
like a robot
02:17
i don't know i suspect not because that
02:19
would negate the point of it being a
02:20
training
02:22
thing but then so they must have someone
02:24
recording all the audio to then yeah i
02:27
think i think so yeah wow yeah it is
02:29
irrational anger right and people go mad
02:31
about cold callers and the thing
02:33
apparently so there was a survey done
02:34
recently and cold calling was voted the
02:36
most annoying thing about the uk uh
02:39
which i mean there's some bad stuff
02:40
going on in this country everyone calm
02:43
down um
02:45
but the most annoying thing about cold
02:47
calling is uh cold cold-caller
02:49
chumminess the false charminess that you
02:51
get yeah i got a cold call this morning
02:54
someone who said did you have an
02:56
accident uh in the car that wasn't your
02:58
fault okay did you well i played along
03:00
for a moment i said yes i did and she
03:03
said did you
03:03
[Laughter]
03:06
you're literally the first person
03:09
yeah she was really it took her ages to
03:11
say anything because she was so
03:13
surprised and she said did you i said no
03:15
not
03:17
i really one last night and uh
03:20
it so it said hi we understand that
03:22
you've had an accident recently and and
03:24
you should be making a claim on it and i
03:26
thought oh this is a robot so i just
03:28
went
03:28
and stayed silent yeah and then it went
03:31
hello and i went nah
03:33
and then it went
03:34
are you still there i thought oh god
03:36
it's an actual human all right sorry and
03:38
then it started talking and i was like
03:39
it got me yeah
03:40
and ai is so good now that it yeah yeah
03:43
they predicted that moment yeah so it's
03:46
like the um the turing test where if you
03:49
can have a conversation with a machine
03:51
but you think it's a human then that the
03:52
machines have won as the
03:55
well thank god i'm not the bar
03:59
uh so there is a software that can tell
04:01
from my voice when i'm on the phone
04:03
whether i'm angry or not
04:04
okay and they use these in telecells and
04:07
so they'll have a computer in front of
04:08
them and i'll ring them up and get
04:10
really angry and passive-aggressive and
04:12
then their computer will say he's
04:13
getting angry
04:14
he's getting really angry you better do
04:16
something about this oh wow and then
04:18
they have to keep it below a certain
04:19
level as if they don't know that you're
04:20
angry yeah well i've denied it quite
04:22
well actually
04:24
can you
04:25
the tele sales person on the floor just
04:27
sobbing
04:28
and the computer's hopefully saying he's
04:30
a little bit pissed off with you
04:33
but it's amazing that computers can tell
04:35
if you're angry yeah very good there's
04:37
apparently you can tell if someone's
04:39
angry by the way they use their mouse
04:41
um to an eighty percent accuracy like
04:44
smashing you around the head with it
04:46
but i think just how you click on things
04:48
and stuff like that they can tell if
04:51
you click on i am reallyangry.com
04:55
they can tell frustration sadness fear
04:58
and depression with more than 80
04:59
accuracy just by the way you use your
05:01
mouse wow wow
05:03
yeah so there is a thing about the
05:04
computers being angry and whether they
05:06
should be made whether we should make
05:08
angry machines basically because one one
05:12
school of thought is that it's quite a
05:13
good idea to make computers that can
05:15
simulate anger and the ones you would
05:16
need to worry about are the ones that
05:17
don't simulate anger that's not what the
05:19
movies tell me
05:21
the robots take over the world they're
05:22
usually pretty angry think about the
05:24
terminator robots they're not angry
05:25
they're just doing a job are they
05:26
whereas if arnie was really emotional in
05:30
terminator then you'd know that he's
05:31
vulnerable you can you've got a weakness
05:33
you can play with yeah but we can't
05:35
really make them angry at the moment
05:36
because we just we're just programming
05:38
angry sounding responses into them um
05:40
and you know it doesn't swear at you
05:42
when you're not telling it to
05:45
send you poo in the post or something
05:47
unless you've programmed that
05:49
which is which is the only reason i can
05:51
assume that i keep receiving it
05:56
there was a really creepy robot
05:58
telemarketer that lots of people are
06:00
writing online about called samantha
06:01
west and this is in the u.s and i think
06:03
she was selling health insurance and she
06:06
denied vociferously that she was a robot
06:08
and so pete and i think it was uh the
06:10
washington post or one of the u.s
06:12
newspapers got realized this got a call
06:14
from her and they all called and said
06:16
are you a robot and she kept on saying
06:18
no i'm a real person maybe there's
06:20
something wrong with the line can you
06:21
hear me okay and they go you really
06:22
sound like a robot and she'd say i
06:25
understand but perhaps there's a fault
06:26
with the line and they eventually called
06:28
and like pressed all the buttons until
06:30
they got through to a real person and
06:31
said look there's a robot claiming to be
06:33
a person working for you i'm not into
06:35
that at all it's really weird and uh the
06:37
person said we do not have any robots
06:39
here there's no robot working here and
06:41
the next day the number of hers had been
06:43
discontinued but i do wonder maybe that
06:46
just was a real person on their first
06:48
day who was like didn't want to deviate
06:51
from the script
06:52
i was really really nervous and said all
06:54
these people going you're a freaking
06:56
robot okay own up and that's why she
06:59
quit the next day oh there was a guy who
07:01
got fired because he put on a robotic
07:03
sounding voice
07:05
to get through his calls faster because
07:07
people assume if they're talking to a
07:08
machine they'll just say yes no and
07:11
option c and he didn't want to do any of
07:12
the fake chumminess
07:14
so put on a metallic voice yeah but he
07:16
got flash for it
07:18
so ironically his job will have now gone
07:20
to a machine
07:23
so you can get therapeutic robots have
07:25
you seen this
07:27
there's one in particular is called paro
07:30
and they've made this robot to help
07:31
people who are suffering from they've
07:33
had some trauma
07:34
and it's shaped like a seal
07:37
and the reason it's shaped like a seal
07:38
is because the guy who invented it says
07:40
people are unlikely to have had bad
07:42
memories of real seals
07:46
it's fair enough i think but seals are
07:48
quite you know they can't attack people
07:49
so it's just that most people don't come
07:51
up against seals that often there are so
07:53
many things that fall into that category
07:55
very few bad memories of octopuses or
07:58
the planet mars
08:01
arnold schwarzenegger actually i mean
08:03
while we're on robots there is one
08:04
subject i think we've been dancing
08:06
around uh which is
08:08
sex with robots
08:10
just
08:11
all right maybe maybe i'm the only one
08:12
who's been dancing around there
08:14
i just wanted to tell you about a story
08:16
from malaysia this is from the newspaper
08:19
free malaysia today uh from october um
08:22
and it goes like this this proposed
08:25
conference on love and sex with robots
08:27
is illegal inspector general of police
08:29
khalid abubakar told a press conference
08:31
in kuala lumpur and action will be taken
08:33
against the organizers if they go ahead
08:35
there's nothing scientific about sex and
08:37
robots it's an offense to have extra
08:39
marital sex in malaysia especially with
08:42
robots
08:42
[Laughter]
08:45
it's true it was called the congress on
08:46
love and sex with robots and i think
08:49
people just saw the title and just saw
08:50
the last three words sex with robots the
08:52
word congress yeah congress
08:55
that's true there's um a group called um
08:57
the campaign against sex robots
09:01
they're a growing group um to stop
09:02
people from actually having sex with
09:04
robots in the future
09:05
and there are people who are saying you
09:07
know we should make laws against this uh
09:09
right now um and there was an article
09:11
about it and there were some people who
09:13
commented on the bottom of it one person
09:15
chrysler harper said if i want to have
09:17
sex with my robot then i will
09:21
my husband is always willing but he
09:23
isn't always there this idea is stupid
09:27
the most advanced robot most people have
09:28
is a hoover which i bet was what she was
09:30
talking about
09:32
and then
09:32
someone called manjeet replied to that
09:35
saying sex robots would at least not be
09:37
as destructive as an atomic bomb
09:41
very true a lot of scientists do say oh
09:43
we'll be having sex with robots
09:46
in a couple of hours
09:47
as soon as you guys leave the press
09:48
conference actually
09:51
it's true though they uh there was uh
09:52
there was a very very famous book sex
09:54
and robots or sex with robots and uh
09:57
they say roughly the year 2050 will be
10:01
when we'll be properly getting into
10:02
bedwood robots so there's a reason to
10:04
stay healthy for all of us
10:06
hold on tight guys
10:08
only 35 more years um another creepy
10:11
robot is uh this robot called pepper
10:13
which was made in japan as
10:15
most of the most advanced robots are and
10:17
uh so a thousand versions of pepper went
10:19
up for sale last year and they went on
10:20
for sale for a thousand pounds each
10:22
equivalent and they sold out within a
10:24
minute so very sought after and i was
10:26
watching a video of the woman who's
10:27
explaining what's so good about pepper
10:29
and it's a robot for your house who can
10:30
be your friend so it's an emotional
10:32
social robot who can kind of respond to
10:34
your emotions sense your emotions calm
10:36
you down make you feel better and uh she
10:38
said uh one thing she said was uh it
10:40
will introduce games into the family
10:42
that you can play together or take
10:44
pictures of your children when you're
10:45
not at home
10:49
one of the games it plays is um so then
10:51
there's an example of this robot
10:52
interacting and it decides to play a
10:54
game with someone so it says uh
10:56
on three we each take a deep breath and
10:58
see who can hold it the longest
11:04
evil robot
11:06
wow i saw when i was in australia there
11:08
was an ad on tv for a new tracking
11:11
device called traku and the idea is that
11:13
traku can be put it's got magnetic
11:15
little bits so you can put on the inside
11:16
of a car you can put it in your
11:18
grandfather's pocket or you can put it
11:21
basically it was an advert saying you
11:23
can stalk you can stalk and no one will
11:26
know but they kept going tracku
11:28
there's like this little cute thing and
11:30
there was a grandfather going where am i
11:33
it goes on cars you can put it in a
11:34
wallet you can put someone's hair you
11:35
put in a fish tank
11:37
[Laughter]
11:40
just put it in a fish tank
11:42
just in case your fish goes missing
11:45
in case your fish goes missing and takes
11:46
the tracking device with it
11:49
look what happened that poor dentist in
11:50
nemo such a good point that would have
11:52
been a much shorter film if they'd had
11:54
your ingenious trash
11:58
um okay it's time for fact number two
12:00
and that
12:02
is chozinski yep my fact is that a fifth
12:05
of america's meals are eaten in
12:08
cars that's so interesting yeah it's
12:11
really interesting isn't it yeah um but
12:13
yes this study done and another thing
12:16
that this either this study or another
12:17
study at the same time found was that 31
12:20
of people in america say they have never
12:22
eaten a meal in their cars so there's
12:24
obviously some people really bringing up
12:26
that average who are just like every
12:28
single time they cook a roast they go to
12:30
their car
12:31
lock themselves in
12:33
well it's a big drive-through nation
12:35
isn't it yeah i think it's that yeah do
12:37
do they say if that's actually what it
12:39
is that is what it is yeah so it's
12:40
eating faster i suggested i was like
12:42
okay so it must be the roasts
12:46
there's a national drive-thru day in
12:48
america
12:49
yeah it's uh july 24th and it's it's one
12:52
of those ones that isn't obviously
12:53
officially recognized but it's one it
12:55
will sort of trend on twitter and
12:57
everyone be going hey they celebrate it
12:59
like international potato day or
13:01
whatever i think it was made up by i
13:03
comment what the first uh the company
13:05
the pioneer drive-through was but it
13:06
went out of business in the 80s but i
13:08
think it was them that made up national
13:09
drive through day in order to boost
13:11
their business wasn't it yeah was it the
13:13
in-and-out chain
13:15
no i think that's one of those robot
13:16
dolls
13:20
so this is the thing uh this is in the
13:21
uk actually two-thirds of motorists say
13:24
they've eaten while driving and 55 of
13:27
motorists think that eating while
13:28
driving should be illegal so obviously
13:30
most of the people who are eating while
13:31
driving are going i wish they'd ban this
13:34
like hate myself
13:36
i think it kind of is illegal i think it
13:38
might be yeah i think if you're not in
13:40
full control of the car it's up to the
13:41
police really but if they see you eating
13:43
a kitkat or something or a banana and
13:45
then sorry
13:47
just two of the many wonderful foods you
13:49
can enjoy in this great nation
13:51
james i genuinely yesterday read a story
13:53
of a lady who got a ticket for peeling a
13:55
banana while she was driving so you're
13:56
on it thanks dad yeah
13:59
yeah so if they think that by doing that
14:01
you're not in full control then they can
14:03
pull you over it depends on how you're
14:05
appealing your
14:07
banana well it depends on if you're
14:08
going at 90 miles an hour on the
14:09
motorway and you think that banana's
14:12
looking a bit too wrapped for my
14:15
do you know liking bananas used to come
14:16
wrapped in foil did they yes considering
14:19
they have their own wrapping already
14:21
yeah when they first came over here they
14:23
were wrapped oh my god yeah that's kind
14:25
of like past the parcel then well the
14:27
worst game
14:33
maybe people used to eat the skin
14:35
until we saw monkeys taking it off and
14:37
then we realized um a few other dry
14:39
through things oh yeah so the first ever
14:41
drive through do you know what it was
14:43
uh no it was a bank
14:45
ah really um it was in chicago it was in
14:48
1946. uh i have another one from 5200
14:51
years ago well
14:53
okay what
14:56
so i'm gonna say that's the second ever
14:58
drive-through
15:00
no there's um there's like an old kind
15:02
of place in iran uh called golden tepe
15:06
and they're not 100 sure that it was a
15:08
drive-through but they think it was
15:09
because of
15:16
well it's because of the height of the
15:17
window and because the rooms seem to
15:19
have been used as a place to keep things
15:21
and it was for bullets and ammunition
15:23
that soldiers would go through five
15:25
thousand years ago they had bullets yeah
15:27
what bullets were invented way before
15:29
guns because bullet is just would you
15:31
just
15:33
well before you wait till i have
15:34
something to put this
15:36
[Laughter]
15:40
before they invented guns the word
15:42
bullet was just a projectile
15:44
a stone it was a stone
15:47
check out my bullet mate it's a pebble
15:49
so they're making noises as they through
15:50
them there's a room with some stones in
15:52
it and you're claiming
15:56
that sounds like an archaeologist who
15:57
needs more funding and just got nothing
16:00
we found some bullets for a
16:02
drive-through
16:05
okay let's hear about your bank they
16:08
found a room with a load of money
16:11
um
16:12
you just that's it you just drove up and
16:13
took money out or deposited it but it
16:15
was a in chicago did you have to show
16:17
any identification or anything or it was
16:18
just a free
16:20
went on a business very fast um first of
16:23
all the first restaurant was in 1947. oh
16:26
okay yeah and they used to instead of
16:28
driving through you would just drive up
16:30
um
16:31
well you would drive through but they
16:32
would have waiters outside taking your
16:34
order and carrying them inside
16:37
and then bringing your food out to your
16:38
car it's quite nice just a way of
16:40
getting your staff cold basically yeah
16:43
um i found a few weird drive-throughs
16:45
that actually exist in america uh at the
16:47
moment i think a couple of them have
16:48
gone defunct but um if they have it's
16:50
only in the last few years so um these
16:52
are for people who just wanted to make
16:54
life easier for everyone there's a
16:56
drive-through funeral parlor
16:58
and this is genuinely real you drive up
17:01
and the person of your who you love is
17:04
just in the window as you go by and you
17:06
pay respects as you go by in the window
17:08
and you form a queue with the cars and
17:10
you just sort of go by and then drive on
17:12
so there's drive-through
17:14
i swear to god it's real are they
17:15
wearing one of those mcdonald's outfits
17:20
held up by strings
17:22
with chicken sandwich in one hand
17:26
so yeah it's a it's a funeral parlor
17:28
drive-through there's an emergency
17:29
services drive-through so you just come
17:31
up in the car and a doctor quickly comes
17:33
and and helps you with uh any problem
17:35
that you have
17:37
so that you're sick but you're still
17:39
driving when they make you so badly sick
17:41
that you have to go to work yeah yeah
17:42
yeah so you drive through and they can
17:44
quickly uh just help you out while
17:46
you're still really bad they put you in
17:47
the funeral one stream
17:50
and this one's amazing there's a
17:52
drive-through bar that serves you
17:53
alcohol but you could take it really i
17:56
don't think they've thought that one
17:57
properly through
17:58
yeah you just buy i'll just have a pint
18:00
of vodka
18:01
[Music]
18:03
just a normal drink
18:06
this is when they want more you know
18:07
when the police want to get more ticks
18:09
on there people are rested they just
18:10
plant policemen two yards up the road
18:12
presumably yeah i guess so they've got
18:14
some arrests under their belt yeah yeah
18:16
i was just looking at fast food have you
18:18
guys ever ever heard of a yalk no yolk
18:21
oh i just realized i've just got why
18:22
it's called that and it's a yolk is it a
18:24
part of an egg
18:26
because yeah i i did come across them
18:29
no with a w so this is the new the
18:32
latest fast food and it's a runny
18:34
pre-cooked boiled egg with pre-cut
18:36
soldiers in it and a spoof which is a
18:39
spoon that includes a tooth to help you
18:41
crack the shell
18:42
um and you say wow this is what you have
18:44
to do you buy the package with the egg
18:46
in it you open the egg you pour boiling
18:48
water on it leave it for five minutes
18:50
and then you've got your egg
18:52
it's amazing because that takes longer
18:54
to make than an actual egg literally
18:57
the other guy said all you need is
18:59
access to boiling water and now you can
19:00
enjoy a delicious yolk wherever you want
19:03
in just five minutes
19:05
that's yeah that's just a boiled egg
19:07
isn't it yeah
19:08
yeah it comes with toe soldiers it does
19:10
come with soldiers yeah but do you have
19:11
to toast them i'd think the soldiers are
19:13
not toasted but i don't toast my
19:15
soldiers anyway so that's not a problem
19:16
for me well then they're not soldiers
19:19
i call them soldiers they're bred
19:20
civilians
19:26
okay it's time to move on to fact number
19:29
three and that is james okay my fact
19:32
this week is that the most dangerous job
19:34
in britain is that of a hairdresser
19:39
why
19:40
so this isn't the most people that die
19:42
um it's most kind of accidents or
19:45
injuries
19:46
and hairdressers and beauticians are by
19:48
far the most likely to suffer an
19:49
accident most commonly cutting
19:51
themselves
19:53
but it's construction which kills most
19:54
people yeah yeah
19:56
yeah um
19:57
definitely bad the most by absolute
19:59
numbers i would say like if you're a
20:00
troll man or something probably a lot of
20:02
people die with that as well but i'm
20:04
going from accidents only and that is
20:06
hairdressers
20:07
there is actually one uh genuinely quite
20:09
dangerous dangerous hairdresser called
20:12
uh albert
20:13
almeido and he's in madrid and he only
20:16
cuts hair with samurai swords or a torch
20:20
wow
20:21
just give you the option when you come
20:23
in
20:24
what will it be today the blow torch or
20:26
the samurais
20:28
i think maybe you have to pay extra for
20:29
the blowtorch i don't know but he's like
20:31
uh it looks really cool actually he
20:33
swipes he has two samurai swords that he
20:34
cuts your hair with and he swipes them
20:36
in opposite directions uh at the back of
20:38
your head and he says it's useful
20:39
because you can do both sides at once
20:41
wow sounds incredibly dangerous yeah it
20:43
does isn't it yeah because what if you
20:45
missed someone's head
20:47
um under the hair and they have a really
20:48
protrudent back of the head it's when
20:50
you ask for a bit off the top and he
20:51
literally takes it
20:54
i think there might be a slightly more
20:56
dangerous uh hairdresser out there
20:59
he's a chinese hairdresser called tian
21:01
and how he does it is he likes to to
21:04
feel the energy of the hair
21:07
and not have any influence of say sight
21:10
so he closes his eyes
21:12
and he starts chopping hair with his
21:13
eyes
21:14
so he'll just feel it and he's very
21:16
popular in china
21:18
yeah yeah he does really well yeah like
21:19
a jedi hairdresser yes exactly yeah
21:22
so there was a rumor going around
21:24
cambodia a few
21:27
a few dozen years ago
21:29
and that was that's the president who is
21:31
called nora damashi who nuke uh he'd had
21:33
a dream in which all the long-haired
21:35
virgins in the country will be taken to
21:38
hell by an evil god
21:40
okay he was kind of quite revered or at
21:42
least feared at the time and everyone
21:44
kind of half believed this thing that
21:46
all the long-haired virgins would be
21:48
taken to hell and so all the virgins
21:50
with long hair cut all their hair and
21:52
all the people who wanted people to
21:54
think they were virgins and had long
21:55
hair they had their hair cut as well
21:58
okay so there's a massive kind of
21:59
epidemic of women having the haircut in
22:01
cambodia
22:02
and according to the police at the time
22:04
they said that it was a rumor started by
22:07
corrupt hairdressers
22:08
[Music]
22:11
very clever so yeah hairdressers are
22:13
very widely trusted supposedly this has
22:15
been in the news in the last two days
22:17
there's been a big survey um by ipsos
22:19
murray so it's
22:20
a legit one and um
22:22
it's their veracity index which they do
22:24
every year and apparently the most
22:26
trusted profession is hairdressers 69
22:28
percent of people would trust their
22:29
hairdresser to tell the truth
22:31
really
22:32
68 for the police
22:35
[Laughter]
22:38
and news readers are only on 65 and then
22:41
journalists and politicians are way down
22:42
they're in the 20s
22:44
that's so weird yeah i don't think i
22:45
trust my hairdresser to tell the truth
22:47
really well they've been saying i look
22:49
great
22:51
their job is to get to the end of a cut
22:53
and go yeah it's fantastic you know it
22:55
can't they can't have got it right every
22:57
time yeah you never hear them going oh
22:58
i've really cocked this up
23:00
there's actually a hairdressing cardiff
23:03
now a bauhaus hairdresser i think it is
23:05
which offers a special quiet chair that
23:07
you can nominate to be in if you don't
23:08
fancy the terrible hairdresser's small
23:11
talk if you don't have a holiday book
23:12
that year or yeah yeah didn't go on one
23:15
last year
23:16
um yeah and the person the manager is so
23:18
he's very relaxed about it he says they
23:20
can change their minds at any time
23:21
halfway through the cut if they feel
23:23
suddenly feel like a chin wag but if
23:25
you're in that chair they will not say a
23:26
word to you the the the owner of that
23:28
one i think he's called scott miller and
23:31
he said i always say if you're asking
23:33
your client where they're going on
23:34
holiday you've lost
23:36
so
23:37
i think there are quite high standards
23:38
for your hairdresser conversation these
23:40
days yeah yeah god yeah where am i going
23:43
to brag about my holidays the last time
23:45
the last time i had my hair cut it was
23:46
by uh it was a i was in a city that i
23:49
don't live in and the woman who cut my
23:50
hair was a regional
23:52
finalist in the national hairdressing
23:54
championships really yeah yeah really
24:01
i mean she was a finalist she wasn't a
24:03
winner
24:05
um but she she told me all sorts of
24:07
stuff about the history of hairdressing
24:09
and she told me that there's a uk
24:10
president of hairdressing
24:12
yeah
24:13
um and there's a fellowship of british
24:15
hairdressing which i didn't know either
24:17
yeah there's also a um there's a male
24:19
hairdresser of the year there's also
24:21
female hairdresser of the year it's a
24:22
big hairdresser awards that happened at
24:24
the end of the year each year and uh in
24:26
2005 i was looking through the list of
24:27
all the people that won 2005 the winner
24:29
was a guy called brent barber
24:33
cool
24:34
really good yeah
24:36
and this is uh this is interesting i was
24:38
reading about uh different kinds of hair
24:41
that get done that aren't on human heads
24:43
and uh madam two swords have um
24:47
hairdressers that actually do the hair
24:49
of the wax works
24:51
and in fact the the twiggy wax work that
24:53
was done the hairdresser who does
24:55
twiggy's hair came in to do twiggy's wax
24:58
work hair as well to give it the cut to
25:00
make it look like it would on on twiggy
25:02
which is quite cool did she know it was
25:04
uh wax work or did she go away like
25:06
twiggy's in a bad mood today
25:12
[Laughter]
25:15
but just as a sideline fact i discovered
25:17
that when madame tussaud
25:20
wax works are made now and i think this
25:22
has always been the case they make them
25:24
two inches bigger the whole body two
25:26
inches bigger because the wax shrinks
25:28
over time and that brings them to the
25:29
actual size of the person um and you
25:32
were telling me today that um after the
25:34
age of 30 you shrink
25:36
by 1 16 of an inch every year every year
25:39
yep so they'd have to shave bits off the
25:41
wax works as well every year another 1
25:43
16 off yes although i learned that on
25:45
oprah about 15 years ago
25:48
and it's just one of those facts that
25:49
stays with you yeah and i haven't
25:51
checked it okay then or now so
25:54
go through those the discs in between
25:56
your back uh vertebrae
25:58
um in ancient rome they had um a job
26:01
called an ornatrix and this was a lady
26:03
who would look after the hair of another
26:05
lady
26:07
and it would be colouring a lot of the
26:08
thing that they did was coloring so if
26:10
you wanted black hair then you had to
26:12
put a mixture of bile rotten leeches and
26:15
squid ink
26:17
in your hair wow that would make it go
26:18
black cool and if you wanted blonde it
26:20
was a mixture of pigeon poo and ashes i
26:24
think i'll stay with the natural do
26:25
actually
26:27
barbers used to offer castrations as
26:29
well is that true well there's medieval
26:31
china oh so yes
26:35
true yes
26:37
no it was uh they did eunuchs yeah sure
26:40
eunuchs are the ones that don't need it
26:46
we say that have we said before that
26:47
chinese eunuchs would carry around their
26:49
testicles to
26:51
be reunited with them in the afterlife
26:53
yes yeah i think so there was one of the
26:55
most famous eunuchs who was won the last
26:56
eunuchs um
26:58
to punish him for something they stole
26:59
his um they stole his bits and it was
27:02
like he just thought it was the end of
27:03
the world for him because he would never
27:05
be able to be brought back
27:07
as a whole
27:08
that is mean yeah real mean
27:10
do you know uh the
27:12
the first ever proper qi fact that i
27:14
ever found when i was working on the tv
27:16
show i had actually to do with chinese
27:18
hairdressers and it was malcy tong's
27:20
hairdresser yeah i was reading a
27:21
biography and it turned out that his
27:22
hairdresser was called big beard wang
27:24
[Laughter]
27:28
okay it's time for a final fact of the
27:30
show and that is my fact my fact this
27:32
week is that elvis presley once started
27:35
a riot at the end of his show by saying
27:37
to the crowd girls i'll see you all
27:39
backstage
27:40
wow yeah and they all went they all went
27:43
in that moment so this was back in 1955.
27:46
this was kind of just as he was reaching
27:48
um his his first sort of wave of
27:50
popularity and he uh he he didn't
27:53
realize that that would be the reaction
27:55
once he said it so he just said this
27:57
line girls i'll see you all backstage
27:59
and they literally just fled onto stage
28:02
just like it just went right on and he
28:04
got scared and he had to run off to his
28:06
little green room they were ripping off
28:07
his clothes he was missing a shoe he was
28:10
missing the side of his shirt and they
28:12
locked him inside uh the the back room
28:14
and no one could get to him and
28:15
eventually when it calmed down and he
28:17
went to his car his car in the side
28:20
metal of the car there were names and
28:21
numbers scratched into the side and they
28:23
couldn't see through the windscreen
28:25
because so much uh lipstick was on it
28:27
with names and numbers for him to call
28:29
and also 500 track
28:31
[Laughter]
28:35
and that was the moment that his manager
28:37
went okay we've got a massive star on
28:39
our hands here and uh yeah and that's
28:41
when he got really promoted well i
28:43
remember um when we were filming qi once
28:45
and justin bieber was um
28:46
[Music]
28:48
in the studios he was doing something
28:50
next door and it was crazy it was just
28:52
it was unbelievable they had so much
28:54
security there every time you walked
28:56
past a window all they had to do was see
28:58
a little bit of hair and they would
28:59
scream
29:00
it was great fun because you just kind
29:02
of peek your head around and then
29:04
[Laughter]
29:06
and you wear a powerful physical
29:07
resemblance
29:12
uh this was this with uh justin bieber
29:14
they did experience serious problems
29:16
with that when the concerts would happen
29:18
because if he arrived late or if they
29:20
told that uh they were told it was too
29:21
chaotic because actually so many fans
29:23
were coming to the show they would say
29:25
okay we're cutting the short or justin's
29:26
not going to be able to appear and they
29:28
would start rioting and unlike a normal
29:31
show where people would riot who were of
29:33
adult age the police just had no idea
29:35
what do you do when you're being
29:36
attacked by children you can't do
29:39
anything you just have to accept it
29:40
that's why you need the robots probably
29:42
you know
29:43
take photos of them
29:47
i don't know i'll just shut them up did
29:49
you guys hear about david spargo i think
29:51
you must have done that
29:53
he's a super fan of the australian band
29:55
peking duck
29:57
who i assume is some kind of
29:59
popular beat combo
30:01
but they were playing in melbourne and
30:03
um he decided that he wanted to get
30:05
backstage and meet his heroes and so he
30:07
went backstage and um the the security
30:10
said to him no you can't come in and
30:12
he's like no no i've got to come in i'm
30:13
the lead singer's stepbrother and
30:15
they're like well do you have any proof
30:17
he said yeah yeah look on wikipedia and
30:19
he brought it up and he just changed
30:21
wikipedia two minutes earlier to say
30:23
that he was that guy's stepbrother and
30:25
he got in and he got to meet his heroes
30:28
cool smart that isn't it
30:30
yeah um have you heard of uh there's a
30:32
beatles fan called jan myers and she was
30:35
a super fan in the days when they were
30:37
first becoming popular
30:39
and she crawled through the sewers under
30:41
abbey road to hear them recording rubber
30:44
soul through the floor
30:46
yeah i think she's writing a book now
30:47
about being a super fan but at the time
30:49
she was a fan they weren't super famous
30:51
yet and the first time she got an
30:52
autograph from paul mccartney he wrote
30:54
paul mccartney brackets the beatles
30:58
yeah so they really weren't well known
30:59
okay they actually met elvis once didn't
31:01
they yeah
31:04
and it sounds like the most awkward
31:06
occasion ever so yeah yeah and
31:08
apparently they just had nothing to talk
31:10
about their press officer wrote about it
31:12
years later i said it was incredibly
31:14
awkward they had this weird small talk
31:15
there were long long silences and
31:17
eventually someone obviously freaking
31:19
out maybe the press officer freaked out
31:20
thought i've got to do something so he
31:22
brought in a load of guitars and the
31:23
beatles just started playing some music
31:25
and everything calmed down a bit and
31:26
then later on elvis bitched about the
31:28
beatles i think to nixon yeah oh that's
31:31
just what
31:33
yeah he didn't [ __ ] to nixon
31:35
a big [ __ ] he said he thought the
31:37
beatles were unamerican because of their
31:39
stance on vietnam yeah it's true no he
31:41
did bitching yeah i guess so he didn't
31:43
mean un-american and that's a good thing
31:45
he's talking to the president of the u.s
31:47
i found this fact by the way uh about
31:49
the the backstage thing with elvis and
31:51
weirdly not in an elvis presley book but
31:53
i've been reading um a biography on
31:55
david bowie called ziggyology and uh big
31:59
influence on david bowie was elvis and
32:01
there was incredible facts in this book
32:03
i i just kept coming across amazing uh
32:05
little nuggets about elvis this is my
32:07
favorite one and this is the exact
32:08
wording
32:09
elvis's conception was so seismic his
32:12
father blacked out after the moment of
32:14
climax
32:16
do you mean fell asleep
32:21
no apparently he just blacked out and
32:22
fell uh fell and had to be sort of
32:25
brought to work
32:28
i think it was um elvis's mother that
32:30
said that so and she should know yeah he
32:32
is so he was mental i didn't quite
32:34
realize how mental elvis was although i
32:36
guess maybe everyone else did but for
32:38
instance the time he met nixon was
32:39
because he was determined that he wanted
32:41
a he collected police badges um and he
32:44
wanted a badge from the bureau of
32:45
narcotics and dangerous drugs and i
32:48
think he thought that meant that he
32:49
could cross any borders with any
32:50
substances at all and he's wearing the
32:52
badger that was fine so he got one of
32:54
those off nixon that's his only reason
32:56
for meeting the president um he used to
32:58
visit uh one of his favorite pastimes
33:00
apparently was visiting the memphis
33:02
morgue to look at corpses uh was that a
33:04
drive-through
33:06
he wants oh i like this image he was
33:09
once with tom jones backstage and um he
33:12
serenaded tom jones while tom jones was
33:13
naked in the shower
33:15
so
33:16
tom jones said i think he was checking
33:17
me out so that could have been a romance
33:19
that never happened wow we need to wrap
33:21
up fairly soon um i've i've got just a
33:24
couple more things a slightly side
33:26
tracking but as i say i got this fact
33:28
from um a ziggy stardust book and um i
33:31
found out this really great fact that i
33:33
think people should know about uh david
33:35
bowie
33:36
that's not his real name his real name
33:37
is david jones and the reason he had to
33:40
change his name from david jones to
33:41
david bowie is because of the monkeys
33:44
for the monkey davey jones from the
33:45
monkeys so he was trying to make it big
33:46
as a musician didn't work so he went to
33:48
david bowie but david bowie wasn't the
33:50
first name that he went to before he
33:52
went to david bowie uh
33:55
the first name he picked after david
33:57
jones was tom jones
34:00
and then a couple of weeks later this
34:02
new singer came along and he went oh
34:04
jesus christ and then had to change it
34:06
to david bowie
34:07
and someone else called tom jones would
34:09
come along yeah
34:13
[Laughter]
34:20
and the riot begins
34:24

00:22
[Music]
00:27
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:30
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:32
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:34
covent garden my name is dan schreiber
00:36
i'm sitting here with andy murray anna
00:38
jaczynski james harkin and a special
00:40
guest making his second appearance his
00:42
first being as a secret track on our
00:44
vinyl it's stone sour and slipknot's
00:47
front man corey taylor and once again
00:50
we've gathered round the microphones
00:51
with our four favorite facts from the
00:52
last seven days and in no particular
00:54
order here we go starting with you corey
00:57
oh the honors yes
00:59
my fact is
01:01
a million seconds is 11.5 days
01:05
a billion seconds is 32 years
01:09
so that is bizarre because just
01:12
basically because of the vast difference
01:13
you think that a billion is a bit more
01:15
than a million and when we talk about
01:17
billions and trillions when you hear
01:18
about trillion dollar debt or billion
01:19
dollar debt
01:20
you kind of think they're essentially
01:21
the same thing
01:23
and
01:23
yeah i know i know so i only just found
01:26
out there's no zillion i thought that
01:27
was a thing
01:28
i would always realize a billion billion
01:30
zillion not a thing at all well it jumps
01:33
to i think there's like there's one in
01:35
between but there's a there's a google
01:36
and then there's a google play is that
01:38
right yeah massive yeah which are you
01:40
know quite quite large so google is one
01:42
with a hundred zeros yeah and a
01:44
googleplex is one with a google xero
01:46
because you can't write out a googleplex
01:48
because there are more zeros than there
01:49
are atoms in the universe i think so
01:52
yeah that's the problem yeah that's the
01:53
problem for me otherwise
01:55
we'd all be doing it that's why we let
01:57
the computers do it
01:59
you know but so it wasn't the case that
02:01
billion in america used to be a
02:03
different billionaire we've half copied
02:05
america but half not copied it so a
02:07
billion means two different things now
02:09
so a billion in america is a thousand
02:11
million and in the uk it's generally a
02:13
thousand million now but also sometimes
02:15
it's a million million yeah so since
02:17
1974 they officially had the standard
02:19
where we have the american short billion
02:22
now i can only apologize i'm sorry
02:25
but it's a lot easier for us all to
02:26
become billionaires well i guess so yeah
02:29
that's why we all are
02:32
why are they only billionaire sitting at
02:33
the stage
02:35
do you know how long ago it was a
02:36
trillion years ago
02:38
years ago i know exactly how long ago
02:40
in seconds please
02:42
no do you know how many a trillion
02:44
seconds ago how many years ago that was
02:46
so is that a thousand billion yes okay
02:49
so it's 31 710 years ago
02:53
and that was about the first time humans
02:55
started eating porridge
02:57
really oh it's good what a big day
03:02
i wonder what they ate up until that
03:04
point oh yeah breakfast nothing
03:05
breakfast nothing breakfast porridge
03:07
[Laughter]
03:09
yeah so we're still
03:10
eating it yeah i mean i'm i'm a
03:12
billionaire
03:15
i eat meat carved right off the this
03:17
broccoli
03:20
that's probably what they were having
03:21
before they were having porridge
03:22
breakfast before yeah i'm saying you
03:24
know we've gone you know i've gone
03:25
backwards you know i'm keeping it real
03:27
was there any was there anything else
03:28
that was going on then do you know james
03:30
uh yeah it was about the same time as
03:31
the first um cave paintings in europe
03:35
i believe bruce forsyth was also born
03:38
right around the world
03:40
[Laughter]
03:43
sorry strong cultural reference that's
03:45
so impressive i know my thing
03:49
what would be the american version of
03:50
that someone who's like really old and
03:52
of of bruce forsyth yeah maybe but i
03:56
don't even know if he's still alive bob
03:57
hope bob yeah
04:01
he made it to 100 though yeah although
04:03
it turns out i was reading this thing
04:04
about bob hope that he actually lied
04:06
about his birthday just for a sort of
04:08
like he just knocked it a year younger
04:09
he was also he's only like 26. no no
04:12
yeah no so he i think just for some kind
04:16
of reason he knocked it a year back so
04:19
secretly he knew he'd hit a hundred yeah
04:21
but he couldn't tell anyone so then when
04:23
he hit 100 officially in the country
04:25
they're like happy birthday but he would
04:26
have been over it by then yeah he's not
04:28
he's just greedy
04:29
he shot himself in the foot there he
04:30
shouldn't have lied
04:31
like bob
04:33
um one of the great things the buddha
04:35
could do apparently according to
04:37
buddhist legend is count really really
04:38
high really
04:40
he well super high james i'll tell you
04:42
how high a mathematician asked him
04:44
what's the highest number you know and
04:46
so the buddha said well i know this
04:47
number it's a bit different
04:50
he could name it though he's the guy
04:51
probably came up with zillion in a panic
04:53
moment but like a zillion i can count up
04:55
to right before he said gajillion
04:58
and then the mathematician said to but
05:00
uh what about a zillion and one
05:04
in your face buddha
05:06
and on this basis a great religion was
05:08
founded
05:10
there was a really good article in io9
05:12
which i love about why how we can't even
05:15
comprehend this million billion these
05:17
massive numbers thing humans haven't
05:18
evolved to comprehend them like when we
05:20
were you know 3000 years ago 4000 years
05:22
ago we didn't need to think about
05:23
anything except people in our immediate
05:25
vicinity we didn't have much
05:27
astronomical knowledge stuff like that
05:28
so we didn't have all these big numbers
05:30
so this article that was written by
05:32
someone called a mathematician called
05:33
spencer greenberg is talking about how
05:35
you can make numbers be more manageable
05:37
or make huge things seem more manageable
05:40
so like for instance the time thing is
05:42
one so you say you could do this over a
05:44
certain amount of time another one is
05:46
breaking stuff down so if you say the us
05:48
has
05:49
17 trillion dollars of debt the best
05:51
thing to do there is actually say that's
05:52
54 000 of debt per person see this is
05:55
the problem because you say how many how
05:57
many dollars was it for every person in
05:59
america 54 000 so i can't picture 300
06:03
million people which is about the
06:04
population of the usa so that's where it
06:06
all falls down unfortunately
06:08
that's true it's a manageable amount of
06:10
money for unfortunately a lot of
06:11
americans can't handle 54 000.
06:13
[Laughter]
06:15
in germany after the war they had very
06:18
very bad inflation and things started
06:20
costing you know ten thousand marks and
06:22
this is after world war one yeah exactly
06:24
uh and they had this mental disorder
06:26
called zero stroke or cipher stroke
06:28
where people just kept writing down
06:30
zeros all the time because they just
06:31
couldn't deal with these massive numbers
06:33
really and you would ask them how many
06:35
kids do you have and they'd be like i've
06:37
got 10 trillion children or how old are
06:39
you i'm seven billion years old or
06:42
something that's so interesting because
06:44
they just couldn't deal with these
06:45
massive numbers wow
06:47
in um 2009
06:49
zimbabwe printed a hundred trillion
06:51
zimbabwean dollar notes i have one
06:53
do you
06:54
and it's worth like something like 20
06:57
pounds or something yeah i think i
06:58
bought mine for about a fiver nice okay
07:01
oh you've got it on the cheap james
07:02
collects these kind of things though
07:04
just so he can pull things out of his
07:05
wallet to impress you james literally
07:07
has two tickets to the gun show like he
07:09
literally has two tickets
07:11
to the gun show
07:12
i was in florida and there was a gun
07:14
show going on then i didn't want to go
07:15
to it but i wanted the tickets so i just
07:17
bought some tickets i've actually been
07:19
meaning to ask since you did that what a
07:20
gun show is and it's gone so long that i
07:22
just haven't now does everyone else know
07:23
what a gun show is you just go along and
07:25
look at guns and um i think you should
07:27
you could buy them a pageant
07:35
[Laughter]
07:40
and there's kind of an
07:42
there's almost like a perpetual gun show
07:44
going on in that in there because like
07:46
and that's like this giant warehouse
07:49
just full of dealers who are just
07:50
showing you
07:52
ar-15s m16s rocket launchers minis like
07:56
and then there's then they have a range
07:59
out back so it's like well go test fire
08:01
it before you buy it you know it's like
08:03
a test drive for a car you know but you
08:05
go out back all right here we go
08:08
and then it's just it's very loud i'd be
08:10
so tense all the time the funny thing is
08:12
they advertise it they advertise for it
08:15
at the airport so you're on the moving
08:17
walkway and you're just grinding there's
08:18
this chick with a gun and a bikini and
08:21
you're like hey that's a place to go
08:24
i don't think they sell boots but i'm
08:26
sure they're working on yeah yeah
08:28
las vegas is very much the um james's
08:30
shirt of america because there's a
08:32
there's a permanent gun show going on at
08:34
all times
08:36
24 7. lock it
08:38
in amazing um this is an amazing thing i
08:42
can't believe i didn't know about big
08:44
numbers yeah so there have been two
08:46
attempts in human history to estimate
08:48
the number of particles in the universe
08:50
i think or two that have
08:51
two big ones that we know about they've
08:53
been written down so one of them was by
08:55
archimedes uh so this was um
08:58
over 2000 years ago and he was
09:00
estimating the number of grains of sand
09:02
in the universe actually but now we know
09:03
how many particles in a grain of sand
09:05
arthur eddington 2000 years later
09:07
estimated the number of particles in the
09:08
universe they came to exactly the same
09:10
number no no isn't that completely
09:12
insane what's he just kind of copying
09:14
off of argentina
09:17
was he published in ancient greek mr
09:19
eddington
09:23
how pissed off would you be though when
09:25
you realize you got the exact same right
09:26
as argument
09:28
really it was five years
09:31
i think you would add an extra couple to
09:33
the end it's like 10 to the power of 72
09:35
plus seven yeah it doesn't look like you
09:37
copied him right yeah well there was a
09:39
thing about everest because they
09:41
measured mount everest and they found it
09:42
came to a really annoyingly round number
09:45
is that right yeah remember so is it
09:47
actually not the tallest mountain in the
09:48
world yeah
09:51
you know that i don't know if i've said
09:52
this on the podcast before last year was
09:54
the first year that no one's reached the
09:55
top of mount everest
09:57
in 41 years since it became all the
09:59
shepherds went on uh no it was just the
10:01
conditions were really bad because there
10:02
were a few avalanches they closed off a
10:04
couple of routes but they didn't close
10:05
off like the extreme routes and the last
10:07
chance was in december someone got
10:09
really close and then had to come back
10:10
down which is the first year really yeah
10:12
and it lost an inch last year from the
10:14
uh the earthquake so you think it would
10:16
have been easier yeah
10:18
you tell me everest lost in it
10:21
is quite cold
10:24
we know exactly what that feeling is
10:25
like
10:26
it's like it's really chilly honey
10:30
i don't care i'm not going to climb you
10:31
tonight
10:36
[Applause]
10:37
okay it's time for fact number two and
10:40
that is chezinski yeah my fact is that
10:42
star trek was almost not commissioned
10:44
because the pilot was considered too
10:46
erotic
10:48
now this fact entailed googling the
10:50
phrase star trek erotic which is quite
10:52
dangerous i see you have a lot of paper
10:54
there
10:57
so what's that well so this was a it was
10:59
a pilot called the cage uh it was the
11:01
name of the episode it was sent to nbc
11:03
in 1964. and actually i was very
11:05
skeptical about how erotic it could
11:06
really be because it's star trek but it
11:08
does sound quite raunchy um it was uh
11:11
the
11:12
idea of the show was that a planet let
11:14
out a call for help to the guys on the
11:16
spaceship on the you know star trek
11:18
spaceship and
11:19
i'm obviously showing how much they know
11:20
about the star trek spacious star trek
11:23
that was the original plan for the name
11:25
of the ship obviously
11:27
and yeah so they went down to this
11:28
planet and actually it was a plant and
11:30
there was a beautiful alien on this
11:31
planet to seduce the star trek uh
11:33
spaceship crew members and because she
11:36
had to have sex with them in order to
11:38
repopulate this planet because it was
11:40
suffering from you know population
11:41
crisis so it was about someone being
11:44
planted to seduce okay captain kirk who
11:46
wasn't captain kirk at the time no it
11:48
was captain pike it was captain pike
11:50
yeah
11:51
pike was in the yeah then well they
11:53
brought it back because then they were
11:55
able to use
11:56
pieces
11:57
of the original pilot in the episode i
12:00
can't remember the name of it but it has
12:02
to do with uh spock is on trial captain
12:06
pike has been
12:07
destroyed he's in this chair
12:09
and uh captain kirk is testifying on his
12:11
behalf and they keep cutting to
12:14
uh footage of the original pilot
12:17
i was kind of a trek
12:19
i i liked i wasn't a trekkie but i
12:21
used to watch it all the time because it
12:23
was on uh
12:25
in repeats so i watched it when i was a
12:27
kid you know and uh i was just
12:29
fascinated by it's like why does the
12:30
future look so old
12:32
yeah i mean i mean there's there's that
12:34
used future look and then there's like
12:36
well christ that's like from the seven i
12:38
rather the original plan for mr spock or
12:40
one of the original things for the
12:42
design of the character was that he was
12:43
going to not eat anything and that he
12:45
would instead he would have a plate in
12:47
the middle of his stomach and energy
12:49
which struck the plate would be his food
12:51
yeah so you just feed off the you know
12:53
if the cosmic radiation hits the plate
12:55
um you know photosynthesizing i suppose
12:58
so wow yeah yeah
13:00
sounds great sounds like a good idea
13:02
it's james's dream yeah yeah you don't
13:04
have to waste all this time having meals
13:05
well the other day damn dan was saying
13:07
to me the other day it's so relentless
13:09
having to eat all the time it's three
13:10
meals a day if we don't talk about it
13:12
more it's full yeah we just again i need
13:15
to feed this thing again i know we have
13:17
discussed this and it's like my greatest
13:20
joy and i can't believe you want to take
13:21
that away from us i love eating yeah i
13:24
love it but sometimes i'm just like i
13:25
just want a day off
13:27
[Laughter]
13:29
that's called the 5-2 diet
13:32
there are products being developed
13:34
though which are um i can't remember the
13:36
name of them but they are basically
13:38
nutritious mush which really doesn't
13:40
taste very much at all
13:41
but it isn't selling yourself
13:45
oh wow
13:46
there is a sea slug that's managed to
13:48
get genes out of plants so it can eat
13:51
like an animal but it can also
13:53
photosynthesize
13:54
so i would like to get these plant genes
13:56
into my body so i can sometimes
13:58
photosynthesize as well wow so while
14:00
sunbathing you're also eating yeah
14:02
basically yeah yeah that is the dream
14:03
actually thinking about it now
14:06
it's not my dream
14:08
i hate to sunbathe i love to eat it
14:10
sounds awful
14:11
um my favorite thing i found out about
14:14
star trek generally so created by gene
14:16
roddenberry uh and there's a lot of
14:18
rules he wrote this kind of bible for a
14:19
star trek of what would be if you if you
14:21
made an episode my favorite one is that
14:23
he believed that there was no chest hair
14:25
in the future
14:27
captain kirk in all the shots where he's
14:30
naked they were shaving his chest
14:33
because there was no chest hair in the
14:35
future he thought ahead he thought
14:37
evolutionary oh so it's not a fashion
14:39
thing in the future he's not shaving it
14:40
every day he just doesn't grow
14:43
like the pinky toe we would just phase
14:44
that out
14:46
because why not
14:48
it makes sense i mean if you think about
14:50
it like well then i guess i'm the only
14:51
one who can really recall it but then
14:53
when su when the one episode where
14:54
everyone goes a little crazy and sulu's
14:56
running around with the sword completely
14:58
you know he's got a bald chest right you
15:00
know yeah uh spock when he's fighting
15:03
kirk on the planet and they have to
15:04
fight each other bald chest or maybe
15:06
klingons just didn't have chest i'm not
15:08
sure no vulcans
15:10
yes they're right god what the hell was
15:12
that yeah
15:13
you know what not a real person
15:15
i'm gonna walk away from the table now
15:16
i'll come back in a second dana's just
15:18
saved us a lot of posts
15:22
you are
15:23
the worst was when we had daniel
15:25
radcliffe on qi and he got the rules to
15:27
quidditch wrong no oh my god how many
15:30
emails have we had about that well maybe
15:31
that's why potter won so many matches
15:37
i'm a maverick i'm ready
15:40
uh on the vulcan thing we have done this
15:42
in a previous episode but if you don't
15:44
know you might like it um which is that
15:46
uh he was originally meant to be martian
15:48
he was meant to be from mars oh when
15:49
they were writing the scripts and
15:51
getting everything approved the people
15:52
at the studio said we think you need to
15:54
change it because by the time this
15:56
series goes out and it's in its second
15:58
series or something we will have landed
15:59
on mars and we will have seen martians
16:03
yeah and they were like and that would
16:04
make your series just look ridiculous
16:07
that's
16:08
he also had um red red skin at first he
16:11
was supposed to have red skin spock and
16:12
but then it was in black and white a lot
16:14
of the time and it turned out it looked
16:15
like he just painted himself black so he
16:17
couldn't have red skin oh really but
16:19
also on skin painting in that pilot um
16:21
the seductress this woman who's supposed
16:24
to seduce them all is green um and so
16:27
she had to be painted in thick green
16:28
paint and it's quite hard and time
16:30
consuming to do that and so that it
16:31
shows up properly on camera they filmed
16:33
a test thing to see how it work on
16:35
camera they sent it away to you know be
16:37
re you know to be properly done they got
16:38
the video back and she looked normal
16:40
skin color and they were like my god
16:42
this hasn't worked and so they went
16:43
through it all again made it a bit
16:44
thicker a bit brighter green sent the
16:46
video you know sent the film away to get
16:48
the video converted to get the video
16:50
back um got it back again and they're
16:51
like what is going on she's still peach
16:53
colored with a tiny bit of green tinge
16:55
and it turned out the color technicians
16:56
when they got the film had gone well
16:58
this is obviously an error they didn't
16:59
mean to uh
17:01
something's gone wrong here
17:03
so they spent they stayed up all night
17:04
every time trying to make her skin skin
17:06
color together
17:07
that's hilarious james didn't we do a
17:09
thing about how early
17:11
tv or early film stars did they wear
17:13
green makeup
17:15
better on the black and white cameras
17:16
right you know who did that next factor
17:19
really that's where the name max factor
17:21
comes from he was like the greatest at
17:23
the time he was the greatest uh film
17:25
makeup artist
17:27
and as they were starting to go from
17:30
uh
17:30
like silent film to like the different
17:33
uh the the different types of film and
17:35
everything it looked very oily very you
17:38
know very just very much like they were
17:40
just painted with a bunch of yeah when
17:41
they went to technical so yeah and so he
17:44
spent i want to say two years developing
17:47
what is now widely known as like the
17:48
standard for uh film makeup
17:51
and and that's why and that's after that
17:53
he started his own cosmetics line and
17:55
that's where max factor comes from oh
17:57
that's awesome it's very cool t.s eliot
18:00
used to paint his face a tiny bit green
18:02
and no one really knows why so maybe he
18:04
was just desperately hoping for a film
18:06
deal last time
18:09
when are they going to bring the
18:10
wasteland to hollywood
18:13
tell me about star trek before we move
18:15
on a lot of people probably don't
18:17
realize that one of the first
18:18
interracial kisses on television was
18:21
between uhura and kirk yeah and at the
18:24
time was very very risque yeah and they
18:27
almost pulled it because the the sensors
18:29
thought it would be uh too inflammatory
18:32
and honestly they get they got a few
18:33
letters but other than that right all
18:35
right yeah because yeah
18:37
and
18:38
i don't know if it was this is why they
18:39
were able to pull it off but they were
18:41
both under the spell
18:42
of i can't remember what the character's
18:44
name was but they were you know
18:45
basically forced to do it and that's how
18:47
they were able to kind of get it through
18:49
but yeah that was it was like the first
18:52
interracial kiss on on television i read
18:54
that
18:55
uhura was gonna leave yeah but then
18:57
martin luther king like talked her out
18:58
of it and said like you know you're a
19:00
trailblazing kind of african-american
19:02
woman who like no matter what you think
19:05
yeah is happening children watching you
19:08
are seeing a black woman in space and at
19:10
the time was so radical yeah yeah it's
19:12
one of the things i give credit for
19:14
roddenberry like he looked so fast i
19:15
mean he was very misogynistic
19:18
but
19:19
he looked so far past color religion he
19:22
did you know like that was the theme of
19:24
a lot of star trek episodes really
19:25
wasn't it it was like this strange other
19:27
alien which actually isn't that strange
19:29
which is not and it was weird because
19:30
like a lot of the characters were not
19:32
white in the 60s when that was a radical
19:34
thing to do yeah mr sulu you have
19:42
yeah just one last thing on sensors yeah
19:44
because i was reading about the history
19:46
of censorship on american tv
19:48
so
19:49
in 1931 um cows were not permitted in
19:53
cartoons to have udders
19:55
and they had to be pictured in a skirt
19:58
yes
19:59
this is 31. this is 31 what happened
20:01
again later because i found another
20:03
source a really good book called
20:04
america's first network tv center which
20:05
says that in 1958 cartoon cows were only
20:08
permitted wearing uh skirts was there
20:11
like a specific length of skirt they
20:13
were allowed to wear they weren't
20:14
allowed to wear a mini skirt or anything
20:15
like that had to be quite a floral nice
20:17
loose flowing number so you couldn't see
20:18
their legs
20:20
i think this is why then they said cows
20:22
had to stand upright because they first
20:24
had them on four legs
20:25
and they had it halfway down their torso
20:27
and then it touches the ground that
20:29
thing off the internet the other week
20:30
about where do you put uh dogs trousers
20:33
like they go around all four legs or
20:35
just the back two legs yeah what if a
20:37
dog wall trousers or trousers well it
20:39
would wear two pairs of trousers
20:40
wouldn't it yeah
20:41
well you should have told the internet
20:42
two weeks ago because they were all
20:44
arguing about it um that's amazing yeah
20:46
so then even in 1940 there was um
20:49
a
20:50
cow called elsie the boredom cow who was
20:53
a real cow uh fearing in a live-action
20:55
film and they said the udders should be
20:57
suggested rather than shown
20:59
we'd rather see the bulge than that
21:04
my country sometimes it was pretty it's
21:06
pretty weird
21:08
[Music]
21:09
[Applause]
21:10
[Music]
21:12
okay it's time for fact number three and
21:14
that is james okay my fact this week is
21:16
that the swiss city of lausanne has
21:19
banned silent discos for being too loud
21:22
[Music]
21:24
there are party animals in switzerland
21:26
that's great isn't it
21:27
so why they make a lot of noise
21:29
apparently because
21:30
while they're while you've got the
21:31
headphones on you're listening to music
21:33
and it's supposed to be silent a lot of
21:34
people are just singing along or kind of
21:37
bouncing around
21:39
shouting at each other
21:41
yeah they uh at download
21:43
they have a special tent specifically
21:45
designed for silent discs okay now i was
21:48
wandering around the grounds one time
21:50
trying to find one of the tents where my
21:51
buddies were gonna play wandered into
21:53
the silent disco tent and was assaulted
21:56
by this
21:57
i mean it's
21:58
it's full contact like it's like
22:01
i mean they're saying like screaming
22:04
stomping is much louder and then you
22:06
look around like these people having
22:08
fits what is happening
22:11
i'm not turning my back on them
22:14
i mean but i mean they've got the lids
22:15
on you know
22:16
yeah i'm not giving it large and i was
22:20
terrified i never went back so i think
22:22
we're saying that los angeles done the
22:23
right thing they are on the right track
22:26
i like a silent disco you can have the
22:28
music nice and quiet and um you can
22:30
wander out if you you know you can turn
22:32
it right down i love it
22:35
it really suits me
22:36
everyone else is rocking out and
22:38
downloading andy's listening to radio 4.
22:43
and now the shipping forecast
22:47
dogger fairbank
22:51
so maybe this we're saying this is a
22:52
sensible thing it seems that way yeah i
22:54
wasn't really okay with the silent disco
22:56
but it seems that yeah they're right
22:57
they're really good but the thing is you
22:58
get people because often they have two
23:00
uh djs or even three playing different
23:02
tunes so people are dancing to different
23:04
uh rhythms and different beats so people
23:07
it's sort of i think people care a bit
23:08
less what they look like when they're
23:09
dancing you don't get as much kind of
23:11
posey dancing yeah because you could you
23:12
could be saying i'm i'm totally in
23:14
rhythm by the way to what i'm listening
23:15
to you just don't know that it's not
23:17
obvious when you're not dancing in tune
23:18
or singing in tune i guess
23:20
a lot of them have their eyes closed
23:22
and they're constantly running into each
23:24
other
23:24
it's very at different tempos
23:27
so it's like it's honestly it's like
23:29
it's like watching cctv footage of like
23:31
the damned
23:33
just outside the gates you know just get
23:35
ready
23:36
[Laughter]
23:38
do you know where silent disco comes
23:39
from no or when it comes from so
23:42
this is well the theory online is that
23:44
it dates back to a 1969 finnish sci-fi
23:46
film called uh i'm going to mispronounce
23:49
it as well
23:51
which means time of roses and people all
23:53
wear the headphones to a party and
23:54
that's the first
23:56
uh time as it was ever seen in popular
23:58
culture yeah yeah wow they were
23:59
definitely listening to stuff because
24:01
sometimes i didn't want to admit this
24:02
but i put my headphones on in the office
24:03
so people don't talk to me but i'm not
24:05
actually listening to anything is that
24:06
sorry yeah well you've lost your
24:07
advantage now were they doing that um
24:09
they were always like i'll go to the
24:10
party but i'm not speaking to anybody
24:13
that's really interesting because when
24:14
was so 1969 and it's set in 2012. so
24:17
when was the audio like sorry when we
24:19
were cassettes audio cassettes invented
24:22
80s because what were they late 70s yeah
24:24
because i was headphones even a concept
24:26
of a thing it just held off
24:28
in america the giant headphones have
24:31
been around for quite a while they kind
24:33
of went hand in hand with the the hi-fi
24:35
system that were sold in like the early
24:36
60s the first ever jukebox was made by
24:39
edison and he had some kind of music
24:41
system and there was like stethoscopes
24:43
that would come down and like five
24:44
different people would kind of put the
24:46
stethoscopes next to their ears and
24:47
listen so that's kind of headphones yeah
24:49
yeah and it used to come with a towel
24:50
that you could clean it after well
24:52
before you would use it that's fantastic
24:54
just so you wouldn't catch ear diseases
24:56
yes those famous ear diseases
24:58
there's a guy called george foy who uh
25:01
lived in new york where it's loud and he
25:02
had some kids who were making noise and
25:04
he decided he would go on a quest to
25:05
find the quietest place on the planet
25:06
and he's obsessed with finding quiet
25:08
places but he says and he's been inside
25:10
the anechoic chamber um in
25:12
massachusetts minneapolis in minneapolis
25:15
um and he's clarified that you can't
25:18
there is no such thing as silence and he
25:19
said he found it really annoying going
25:20
inside this chamber which didn't drive
25:22
him mad like it drives other people mad
25:23
i have read that the longest anyone's
25:25
ever spent in an anacote chamber is 45
25:27
minutes he beat that did he yeah because
25:29
he was fine with it they actually had to
25:30
kind of break the door down to get him
25:32
out he's just having a great time
25:38
that's a designer
25:40
[Laughter]
25:50
yeah um it's the echo it's the lack of
25:52
echo so you can make noise but it's just
25:55
it won't bounce back at you and so um
25:57
with this one there was a floor which
25:59
was just normal and all the other walls
26:00
were kind of um had this special stuff
26:03
that stopped any echoes and did it was
26:04
it weird yeah it was really weird it was
26:06
really really weird yeah do you know the
26:08
most echoey place in the entire world
26:11
it's this massive oil tank in scotland
26:13
it's in a place called inching down and
26:15
they they dug these huge oil tanks into
26:17
a hillside during the
26:19
second world war to store millions and
26:21
millions of gallons of oil because they
26:23
need to fuel ships which were were
26:26
moored at the nearest naval base but
26:27
they didn't want it to be a risk of
26:29
bombers you know long-range german
26:30
bombers so they had to dig it into the
26:31
hill the only way to get in is through
26:34
one of these four tiny pipes they're 46
26:37
centimeters across
26:38
so it's a squeeze but when you get
26:40
inside there they've got inside and
26:41
tested it and the way you test it by the
26:43
way is firing a blank a pistol
26:45
with black loaded with blanks and see
26:47
how long it takes how long the actor
26:48
takes why can't he just say echo like
26:51
it's just it's a standard it's just a
26:52
standard way of doing it there are there
26:54
are more modern ways but the echo the
26:56
echo in this chamber lasts 112 seconds
26:59
you're kidding wow oh my god that's so
27:01
cool we played a place the other night
27:03
it was uh this this hall in frankfurt in
27:06
germany and the delay in there was seven
27:09
seconds long because it was just so
27:11
cavernous wow and even when you get
27:13
people in there like i mean it's it's
27:14
such a battle for us to dial in the
27:16
sound yeah
27:18
wasn't that unbelievably distracting
27:20
well we bring it we bring our own uh our
27:22
own pa system with us so we're able to
27:25
really control that plus we have
27:27
uh probably one of the best sound guys
27:29
in the business he is able to really
27:31
control that you know he's spent so many
27:33
hours and so many you know just
27:35
he he knows how to really dial it in
27:38
yeah i was pretty intense so that was
27:39
seven seconds that was seven seconds
27:42
112. i mean it's it's incredible
27:44
it's just hanging there yeah and i mean
27:48
it's something like that the decay rate
27:50
has to just be and just sick because
27:53
it's just it's feeding itself man yeah
27:56
yes i'd love to go in there and do some
27:58
vocals
28:00
done i've done vocals at the bottom of a
28:02
well before
28:04
yeah i don't really recommend it
28:06
because you're wet
28:08
so was this part of like a plan oh yeah
28:09
did you just decide
28:11
for slipknot and uh we were recording
28:13
out it was when we were doing all hope
28:14
was gone which was the fourth album
28:17
and uh we were out at our uh our our
28:19
buddies uh this place called sound farm
28:22
basically he lives there and he's got a
28:23
studio there so we were doing a lot of
28:25
like experimental stuff you know just to
28:27
kind of get away from like the pro tools
28:29
plug-ins and everything like that it's
28:30
like let's try and capture something
28:31
unique so they they they fished me down
28:34
the bottom of this well because you know
28:36
you had a proper well down there it was
28:39
deep very dark and of course we waited
28:41
until the sun had gone down to do it i
28:42
was like this was poor planning
28:46
but then we fished uh uh a telefunken
28:48
u87 down and uh
28:50
um i was able to to kind of do and it
28:52
was just this kind of spoken word thing
28:54
that we were just doing again but the
28:56
the reaction just that picked it up was
28:58
really really cool so
29:00
i love doing
29:01
that i'm all about it is it is it true
29:03
because it's online this about you that
29:05
your vocal range is that's the biggest
29:08
no it's not big it's uh it's in metal
29:12
um
29:13
apparently i have a pretty good ring
29:14
it's five and a half uh
29:17
yeah octaves um but like that but i
29:19
didn't even know that to be honest you
29:21
know like i was like uh because this is
29:23
a good thing about the internet well i
29:25
can't sing that but i can sing this i
29:26
mean that's really that's the end of my
29:28
gig yeah
29:29
but so that rate the high range the
29:30
screen got you into getting a gig on
29:32
docker who right well yeah the well the
29:34
low growl right it was really what did
29:36
it yeah um and then the guys who
29:39
uh directed it daniel herrera who i just
29:41
saw last night he came to the gig um
29:44
they were he like he and a couple of
29:46
producers a lot of the people they were
29:47
like huge slipknot fans growing up and i
29:49
was wow
29:51
and they were like they they when we we
29:53
played in cardiff last year where they
29:54
film and they took us to the doctor who
29:56
experienced so i'm just
29:59
freaking out you know like we were there
30:01
for hours and it was like we gotta go
30:05
but no
30:07
um they took it they took us to uh uh
30:09
bbc cardiff or bbc wales excuse me and
30:12
they walked us through some of the sets
30:14
and everything and then they were like
30:15
so we've got this idea and i'm like yeah
30:18
yeah
30:19
and it described the fisher king who's
30:21
the the the
30:23
the alien who i provided the screen for
30:25
and then uh peter and i can't pronounce
30:28
his last name
30:30
there it is thank you thank you for that
30:32
because i i butcher it every time
30:35
he did the spoken the the spoken voice
30:38
and i was the i did the growl so it was
30:40
kind of a cool mashup
30:44
yeah basically essentially yeah i mean i
30:46
let him take the lead
30:48
he's pretty good uh but yeah so i just i
30:51
went i'd screamed for about 45 minutes
30:53
and they were like we've got plenty
30:56
and i went and did the gigs we actually
30:57
only asked for three seconds but thanks
31:00
you've quite overdid it
31:03
um anyone got anything else an amusing
31:05
noise complaint oh yeah uh i saw so this
31:07
is a big sign that somebody left outside
31:10
someone else's house when that person
31:12
had been keeping them up all night with
31:14
their loud music and their partying and
31:16
the sign says to the people that kept us
31:17
awake all night by singing on the
31:19
balcony 2 23 am pinball wizard 3 out of
31:23
10.
31:24
your performance of this would cause the
31:26
band more shane than pete townsend's
31:27
liberal attitude
31:30
3 15 a.m
31:32
walk this way
31:33
the lowest point of the performance
31:35
i hate this song
31:37
one out of ten but then 8 20 a.m so you
31:41
know this has gone in a while tiny
31:42
dancer actually very good 7 out of 10.
31:47
i think they're a bad critic because
31:49
that's very good seven out of ten it's a
31:51
little bit bit harsh yeah
31:55
[Applause]
31:56
all right time for our final fact of the
31:59
show and that is andrew hunter murray my
32:01
fact this week is that the giant squid's
32:03
brain is wrapped around its throat so if
32:06
it eats anything too large it risks
32:08
brain injury
32:10
it feels like a design flaw doesn't it
32:11
it does so good i know but they've got
32:13
to do a lot with a little space because
32:15
they've got this thing called the mantle
32:17
which is basically everything except the
32:18
tentacles and they have to fit a huge
32:20
amount of stuff in there and so they
32:22
feed through this uh sort of the hole in
32:24
the middle of the mantle and they you
32:26
know they have a beak and they have all
32:28
sorts of strange features and so their
32:30
brain is wrapped around their esophagus
32:32
yeah how stressful crazy yeah every meal
32:35
every night that would put me off eating
32:37
if i was going to be brain damaged
32:39
you just have to chew that's all it is
32:42
yeah and there's one of very few things
32:43
that we know about the giants quick
32:44
because we know so little yeah yeah we
32:46
don't know how they hunt we don't know
32:48
whether how many species there are there
32:50
might be they think there might be up to
32:51
eight different species of giant squid
32:53
so they've obviously got eight tentacles
32:55
but then they've got two feeding
32:56
tentacles as well
32:58
so the feeding tentacles can stretch out
33:02
to 33 feet that's what they found in
33:04
like so imagine you've seen like a squid
33:06
ages away and you're like i'm pretty
33:07
safe here you can just lob these two
33:10
feeding arms and grab you and bring you
33:12
back like a like a big tongue on a
33:14
lizard but they will be able to swallow
33:16
you down you're way bigger than that i
33:18
was in my head as i said that i was a
33:20
fish
33:21
yeah yeah i was picturing myself
33:22
swimming along going oh i'm safe here
33:24
eating nemo yeah they're huge
33:26
they are they are the size of a bus
33:28
aren't they they are enormous
33:31
some of them are as long as so basically
33:33
the maximum length including the
33:34
tentacles is 13 meters yeah and half of
33:37
them will be the feeding tentacles but
33:38
still that's uh that's that's big that's
33:40
a cheat though i would say because if
33:42
you grew like an eyebrow hair really
33:44
really long you could say wow i'm
33:45
actually this length but because those
33:47
are just two little tentacle arms you
33:50
count your legs when you're talking
33:51
about how tall you are
33:54
you count your arms which are your feet
33:56
if i'm talking about a bus i'm not going
33:57
to talk about a bus that has two extra
33:59
poles hanging out at the top and going
34:01
get on my massive both of you say get on
34:03
my massive pole
34:06
there was footage of that one
34:08
um kind of washing up next to a ship
34:12
uh i want to say it was fishing just off
34:14
like uh maybe the alaskan coast but it
34:17
was i mean quite big and it was caught
34:18
in one of the nets and it took them
34:20
forever
34:22
yeah i mean it was but it was big i mean
34:24
it was i mean and this was a big ship
34:26
you know
34:28
the crabbing ships and christ it was
34:30
half like maybe three quarters as long
34:32
as the ship itself
34:34
is like oh god
34:37
someone called like the the squid police
34:39
in weymouth i think squid police yeah um
34:43
the official name yeah that's what you
34:45
call it's nine nine ten
34:51
someone called the squid police i was
34:53
saying the giant squids washed up on a
34:54
beach and it turned out to be a mink
34:56
whale which is huge so they look like
34:57
whales when they're dumped on beaches so
34:59
these huge formless
35:01
wow yeah and they have the biggest
35:03
eyeballs in nature don't they yeah um
35:05
gigantic eyeballs
35:07
so all animals i think um the eyes
35:09
evolved one time but i think the squid i
35:12
think the eyes evolved completely
35:13
separately even though they do exactly
35:15
the same thing so it's like eyeballs
35:17
have evolved twice in two different
35:18
types of animals
35:20
i think that's right is that because of
35:21
the depths that they have yeah i think
35:22
that's right probably yeah i was looking
35:25
into why they have these enormous eyes
35:27
and there's a really good paper from
35:29
2012 by a team led by dan eric nilsson
35:32
just shout out to him um that is to help
35:34
them spot sperm whales who are their
35:35
main predators
35:37
so he did a paper and the question was
35:39
why do they have eyes and the answer was
35:40
so they could see things
35:43
but why they're three times wider than
35:45
almost any other animal apart from
35:46
colossal squid which is the other kind
35:48
but anyway never mind them um so
35:50
sperm whales are the main things that
35:51
hunt them and 600 meters down using an
35:53
eye that size you could spot 120 meters
35:56
away a sperm whale but sperm wells have
35:58
got sonar so they can they can identify
36:00
a giant squid from a long way away so
36:03
it's really just to give them any kind
36:04
of advantage and a head start in getting
36:06
away and lots of sperm whales when they
36:08
wash out when they die they've got scars
36:10
all over them which we think are from
36:12
grappling with squid and they're not
36:14
tempting
36:15
i was wondering what that was when i was
36:16
looking at the pictures of those ones
36:17
that washed up they've got those
36:18
scratches all down their backs yeah and
36:21
wow and they think that about three
36:22
quarters of everything sperm whales eat
36:24
is giant squid from the number of
36:26
um squid beaks they find in the stomachs
36:28
of the whales so that it's a huge they
36:30
have these enormous battles underwater
36:33
there's probably one happening right now
36:34
[Laughter]
36:38
you know squid ink
36:39
so it's not personally but
36:42
we have mutual friends
36:44
yeah it's a metal band
36:46
yeah they're from sheboygan wisconsin
36:49
shout out
36:51
so um they they actually do two batches
36:54
of squid ink that go out when they're
36:56
using it as a defense system so the
36:58
first batch is kind of pure ink it's
37:00
very inky and it's meant to create a
37:01
blob so they can create a distraction
37:04
the second batch is a more mucusy
37:06
little bit of ink so it's mixed with
37:08
mucus and the idea is that when they
37:10
spit this out that they are creating a
37:13
shape that looks exactly like them so
37:15
it's like a decoy it's like this with
37:17
this weird squid looking decoy so it's
37:20
like a squid hologram exactly and
37:22
they've they've got video observation of
37:25
animals that were going after the squid
37:27
then going for this and being like whoa
37:29
what what where's the squid and he's off
37:31
that's wow
37:33
i love that yeah that is rare that's
37:36
intelligent yeah um male squid have to
37:39
be quite careful what they do with their
37:40
sperm because the way they inseminate a
37:43
lady squid uh is they deposit these
37:45
sperm packets uh these spermatophores uh
37:47
into a little pouch on her body um but
37:50
she loves to eat them that's really what
37:51
she likes doing best is to get like
37:53
reach around with her tentacles pick the
37:54
sperm out and eat it so that's obviously
37:56
a problem for the man because uh or the
37:58
male squid
38:00
because that means that he you know he
38:01
doesn't get his offspring out of her
38:02
because she's just eaten his potential
38:04
offspring if i had a nickel
38:05
[Laughter]
38:09
sorry miles away
38:11
you can empathize there you go
38:13
so once you eat the sperm that you may
38:16
have deposited on her um it actually
38:18
helps her to develop her unfertilized
38:20
egg and so helps out the next guy his
38:22
competitor that comes along wow so
38:25
you've got to really make sure that so
38:26
that's why sometimes when you deposit
38:27
your sperm into a female's pouch they
38:29
try and get it really really deeply in
38:31
because so that she can't actually reach
38:32
around to it and and get it out another
38:34
species called the coastal squid and
38:36
it's usually the bigger males that are
38:38
successful with the females but there
38:40
are also sneaky males or sneaker males
38:43
and they're much smaller but what they
38:44
do is when the female is about to lay
38:46
her eggs she lays it out of her front
38:49
and they deposit sperm on her face and
38:51
then when the
38:53
egg comes out then it kind of collects
38:55
their sperm and their sperm is much
38:56
bigger than the other males ah i'm not
38:59
sure we can safely say anything about it
39:01
yeah
39:02
i'm back here and just fighting myself
39:06
corey's like those nickels are really
39:08
pilots
39:10
giant giant squid have penises but other
39:12
squid don't do you think they ever like
39:15
uh trick people by saying i have a giant
39:17
squid penis and then it's unclear
39:20
which bit the giant is referring to
39:24
i like to think they do i hope they do
39:26
yeah
39:27
so you're saying it's like sorry are you
39:29
saying that it's a giant squid penis
39:34
or a giant squid penis it's actually an
39:36
extremely small giant squid
39:40
penis of all the giants
39:44
i've had to deal with and i'm just
39:46
saying there's been quite a few yours is
39:49
by far the smallest the best
39:54
i was just reminded of that
39:55
are you saying four candles yeah the
39:57
same four candy
39:59
that was the important
40:00
in an original draft of the sketch it
40:02
was about giant squid penises
40:05
i've learned so much today
40:07
i'm so happy so this is a really gross
40:09
idea so there was a woman in uh south
40:12
korea recently who was eating squid so
40:14
we all eat squid we call it calamari for
40:16
reasons i don't understand um but she
40:18
was eating some boiled squid in a
40:19
restaurant and she suddenly felt a pain
40:22
in her tongue and it turned out the
40:24
squid wasn't quite dead and it was a
40:25
male squid and it had deposited its
40:27
sperm packet into her tongue so she felt
40:29
horrible pain in her tongue and then
40:30
felt lots of stuff crawling around
40:32
inside her tongue and had to go to
40:34
hospital and they took out a whole bunch
40:36
of sperm and apparently this does happen
40:38
a bit like there's been reports in japan
40:39
of it happening that's so [ __ ] up
40:42
i will never [ __ ] eat that [ __ ] again
40:45
oh my god
40:52
[Laughter]
40:55
vegetarianism here you come it had to be
40:58
in the tongue

chazinski and james harkin
01:16
[Applause]
01:23
and once again we have gathered round
01:26
the microphones with our four favorite
01:27
facts from the last seven days and in no
01:29
particular order here we go starting
01:31
with you james harkin okay my fact this
01:34
week is that in 2005 there were plans to
01:38
make a 50-foot tall robot michael
01:41
jackson that would roam around the
01:43
nevada desert
01:44
[Laughter]
01:47
how
01:49
how advanced were these planets
01:51
they were pretty advanced um
01:53
michael jackson was going to do a
01:54
residency in vegas and they wanted to
01:57
advertise it and this was their big idea
01:59
they were going to do a massive robot he
02:01
was going to wander around the desert he
02:02
was going to fire lasers out of his eyes
02:06
and the idea is as you were flying into
02:08
to vegas the first thing you see when
02:11
you came into vegas is a massive michael
02:12
jackson well this was a couple of months
02:15
after he had been acquitted on charges
02:17
of child molestation and for some reason
02:18
raising money was a problem for this
02:20
project
02:23
i think then they scaled down a bit
02:25
didn't they and they decided to make a
02:26
michael jackson themed hotel and casino
02:28
in vegas which had a smaller robot at
02:30
the door that's right and that would
02:32
also fire lasers from a huge michael
02:34
jackson face that was going to be
02:35
painted on the huge hotel yeah so uh so
02:39
the hotel didn't happen either
02:41
no no none of this happened but i mean
02:42
they always have these big plans in
02:44
vegas don't they of what they're going
02:45
to do and and this one didn't quite work
02:47
out i i read one thing that they were
02:49
going to do which was make a life-size
02:52
starship enterprise that was going to be
02:54
in vegas and that got quite far down the
02:56
line that they were going to do this but
02:57
they never did in the end is that star
02:59
trek yes yes cool
03:02
yeah
03:03
well um i really like the idea of
03:05
turning certain celebrities into robots
03:08
i think it's quite a nice note no sorry
03:10
not like the existing living ones
03:13
into a cyborg like for example uh philip
03:15
k dick they actually
03:17
made a robot of philip cave dick and
03:20
they left his head on a plane
03:21
accidentally and it became a huge story
03:23
of where's philip k dick's head
03:26
the robot yeah it was a robot head
03:28
but so yeah so they did it with philip k
03:30
dick um i wish they did it with michael
03:32
jackson what was that sorry what was the
03:34
purpose of the philip k dick one i think
03:36
it was just so that they could have the
03:37
headline [ __ ] missing
03:39
[Laughter]
03:42
i think you're right
03:44
it was obviously the connection that he
03:46
has with do uh electronic sheep
03:49
yeah yeah robot's dream of electric
03:51
sheep yeah exactly so it was it was just
03:53
such a founder of the idea so they were
03:54
trying to do ai and they created a
03:55
philip k dick robot but lost his head
03:58
yeah
03:59
i was uh reading about uh robots and
04:01
walking robots and why it's so hard to
04:03
make walking robots so
04:05
the distance record for a walking robot
04:07
is 54 miles which is amazing it's longer
04:09
than i can walk wow
04:11
but it was a very
04:13
set path so it was around a flat course
04:15
in an indoor arena
04:17
and it then ran out of battery power and
04:18
it stopped and the article i read about
04:20
it said unconscious and immobile xinji
04:23
earned a guinness world record and it
04:24
has a little moustache painted on the
04:26
front but the thing is it's not very
04:27
useful because
04:28
to walk on rough terrain is much much
04:31
harder i mean almost impossible and it's
04:33
just walk around in circles exactly and
04:34
as the article says the robot is not
04:36
really designed for real-world
04:37
applications as there are a few jobs
04:39
that require a robot to walk a smooth
04:41
circular path until it collapses
04:45
i read an exciting bit of robot news uh
04:48
yesterday as well which is that uh there
04:50
is a robot currently writing new
04:51
episodes of the sitcom friends
04:54
how can they tell
04:58
so it's uh it's interesting it's a guy
05:00
called andy hurd and he's been feeding
05:01
all the scripts of friends into a
05:03
machine and it's been generating what
05:05
effectively is just really weird fan
05:07
fiction of friends but doing full
05:09
scripts and you know it doesn't make
05:11
total sense they've put a few extracts
05:13
online one is um this is from chandler
05:16
so brackets first off chandler brackets
05:18
in a muffin
05:21
brackets runs to the girls to cry and
05:24
then the dialogue can i get some
05:25
presents
05:28
so that's where that's at at the moment
05:30
sounds absolutely fantastic they're
05:32
doing a reunion of friends if they
05:33
should take one of these scripts
05:37
that sounds better than actual friends
05:38
and i'm a huge fan of actual friends
05:40
that sounds incredible doesn't it yeah i
05:42
read quite a cool headline about robots
05:44
and that is usa challenges japan to a
05:47
giant robot battle
05:49
wow that sounds cool doesn't it where
05:51
can we get tickets well these i don't
05:53
really know but it's um there's a
05:55
company called megabot usa that raised
05:58
1.8 million dollars through kickstarter
06:00
to make a massive robot and apparently
06:02
there's one other company in the world
06:04
that makes massive robots and they're
06:05
from japan and they've challenged each
06:07
other to a big fight and it's going to
06:09
happen sometime this year
06:11
each robot suit will be piloted by a
06:13
team and both are laden with guns that
06:15
can shoot paint-filled cannonballs i
06:17
imagine japan are going to absolutely
06:19
smash that every impressive robot
06:21
advance you hear about comes from japan
06:22
doesn't it yeah
06:24
there's one which is comes from harvard
06:26
university which is robo bees
06:28
which are quite cool so these robot bees
06:31
they can swim and fly swim like a puffin
06:34
apparently rather i don't know why you
06:35
would make them swim like a fish
06:38
what do they fly like
06:42
that was muhammad ali's rejected slogan
06:43
wasn't it
06:45
so i'm like a puffin fly like a car
06:50
they fly like a bee but they can be used
06:51
to pollinate crops in the future they
06:53
think and for various reasons but uh
06:55
yeah autonomously pollinate crops that
06:58
are struggling to be pollinated
06:59
naturally for search and rescue
07:00
operations military surveillance traffic
07:03
monitoring we'll have little robo bees
07:05
buzzing above our cars wow that's quite
07:06
cool yeah that's very amazing can i um
07:08
can i uh bring up a couple of michael
07:10
jackson facts yeah so i i when michael
07:13
jackson died i read this massive
07:15
biography of him and um there's such an
07:18
interesting family like when the jackson
07:19
five got big and then the subsequent
07:21
solo careers joe jackson the dad started
07:24
releasing his own products thinking i
07:26
can ride this way but celebrity uh he
07:28
released a competitor to coca-cola
07:31
i want to take these guys on releasing
07:32
joe cola um but this is a thing i that i
07:35
didn't know about him which is the
07:37
family or jehovah witnesses at least
07:39
they were back in the day and the mum
07:41
didn't want michael jackson and the
07:43
family to lose their connection with the
07:45
jehovah's witnesses despite being famous
07:47
so even at the height of his fame when
07:49
they were doing blame it on the boogie
07:50
and stuff michael jackson still had to
07:52
go door-to-door undercover as a
07:55
jehovah's witness to tell
07:57
yeah and everyone who they've
07:59
interviewed about it said well it was
08:00
blatantly michael jackson
08:02
yeah just like a fake mustache he was
08:04
like can i talk to you about and they
08:06
were like it's michael jackson yeah of
08:07
course
08:08
wait was it wasn't he five when they
08:10
were doing blame on
08:16
who is it well i think it's michael
08:18
jackson but he's he's got a moustache
08:21
so he used to go for hours and they
08:22
would just be like of course you can
08:24
talk to us about it and he would sit in
08:25
their house and he'd be stuck there and
08:26
he would be probably the only jehovah's
08:28
witness in history going how am i going
08:29
to get out of this house
08:31
i like the message but maybe could you
08:33
sing a few bars of it
08:35
okay so he recycled that disguise i
08:38
think because so his two security guards
08:40
who are security guards the last few
08:41
years of his life have written a book
08:42
and they say that whenever they had to
08:44
go shopping he would sneak out the back
08:45
in disguise so we all might have seen
08:47
michael jackson but we wouldn't know and
08:49
once in 1989 he went shopping in
08:52
disguise he was wearing a false
08:54
moustache but also a red baseball cap
08:56
and a afro wig and he was arrested
09:00
because he looked like a shoplifter
09:04
one of the phrases in the news article
09:07
at the time i liked from this just
09:08
because i had never heard it before was
09:10
one of the security guards who arrested
09:12
him and then he started saying this guy
09:13
who looked like a crazy man said i'm
09:15
michael jackson and so the security
09:16
guard said my first thought was this guy
09:18
had gotten off the elevator between
09:20
floors
09:22
and
09:23
i googled that phrase and it's not a
09:25
phrase
09:28
but i love it
09:30
that's amazing
09:31
uh we're gonna have to move on to our
09:33
second fact so it's time for fact number
09:35
two and that is andrew hunter murray my
09:38
fact is that in the 16th century people
09:40
disliked hedgehogs because it was
09:42
believed that they sucked cows udders
09:46
this is a genuine myth if you like about
09:48
hedgehogs so i looked into it i found
09:50
loads of books 19th century 18th century
09:53
all saying and so the later ones are
09:54
debunking it so there's one from 1862
09:57
which says that the hedgehog sucks the
09:59
milk from cows is a vulgar error it is
10:02
structurally impossible for the hedgehog
10:03
to drain the udder of the cow
10:06
are hedgehogs famous for standing on
10:08
their back legs
10:09
[Laughter]
10:12
you're thinking of people like that
10:17
you are thinking hedgehogs are lactose
10:18
intolerant aren't they what are they so
10:20
oh yeah
10:22
are they intolerant yes stop giving them
10:24
milk everyone yeah
10:26
well like a lot of cats lactose
10:27
intolerant but i think almost all
10:28
hedgehogs are lactose intolerant so they
10:29
get really sick oh i read it gives them
10:30
diarrhea yeah and then they come back
10:32
and have more milk because they've had
10:33
diarrhea because they like that so much
10:36
no
10:37
they're dehydrated is why they come back
10:38
for more of it so people think they like
10:40
it so hedgehogs were originally called
10:42
urchins
10:43
and that's where sea urchin comes from
10:45
because it looks like a hedgehog of the
10:46
ocean yeah urchins are still called sea
10:49
hedgehogs in dutch
10:50
urchins as in victorian cockney youths
10:53
yes
10:54
just a pack of sea hedgehogs out there
10:57
i can tell you something else that
10:58
people used to think about hedgehogs
11:00
so pliny who's one of our favorite guys
11:02
playing the elder uh he wrote that
11:04
hedgehogs could climb trees knock down
11:06
apples and then roll on the apples put
11:09
them on their spikes and then run away
11:10
stealing the apples
11:12
it's good doesn't it they can't do that
11:16
why have they not worked that out that's
11:18
fantastic they roll into balls they roll
11:20
into balls yeah i mean that i think the
11:22
spikes just aren't spiky enough um no
11:24
but that was believed into the
11:26
there were debunkings of it and that
11:28
they can climb they can climb up walls
11:30
walls
11:31
you're thinking of spiders
11:34
i'm not
11:35
i have read people saying
11:37
they can die
11:40
into
11:42
[Laughter]
11:53
how come dan goes away with alien stuff
11:58
all right get it together yeah should we
12:00
should we talk about hedgehog santa
12:01
let's don't worry about hedgehogs um so
12:03
you know how they can go into a bowl dan
12:05
was saying yeah yeah um the muscle which
12:08
allows them to go into the ball is the
12:09
same muscle that you use when you're
12:11
frowning
12:12
so you know when your face kind of
12:14
crunches up like that their muscle their
12:16
version of that muscle in your face goes
12:18
all the way down their body and it's
12:20
that that turns them into a ball and
12:21
they do an arse frown don't they because
12:23
they do it
12:25
on the front the first thing they do is
12:27
frown with their front and then their
12:28
spines come over their face and then
12:31
they do an ass frown with the end of
12:33
their spine and then that makes the
12:34
spines cover their bum and then they
12:36
have a third muscle which latches those
12:39
two uh bits of bull together so that
12:41
they can't and they can sit like that
12:42
for hours and hours can't they wow it's
12:44
amazing it must be so cozy yeah
12:47
um there's i read another few quotes
12:49
from 17th 16th century sources about
12:52
hedgehogs and uh one of them is from
12:54
1607 it's a book called the history of
12:56
four-footed beasts and it's about what
12:59
foxes do when they find a hedgehog and
13:01
apparently it was thought that when a
13:02
fox finds a hedgehog it licketh gently
13:04
the face and snout of the hedgehog by
13:06
that means bringing himself to unfold
13:08
himself and to stand upon his legs which
13:11
being done he poisoned at the beast with
13:13
the urine that he rendereth upon the
13:14
hedgehog's face
13:17
so it pees on its face so they thought
13:18
fox's weed hedgehogs to death yeah which
13:20
i don't i don't think i heard another
13:22
thing about foxes and urine and
13:23
hedgehogs which is that
13:27
oh yeah i've got four or five of these
13:31
just that foxes i read that when you had
13:33
a hedgehog in a bowl then uh fox would
13:36
urinate on it to make it open itself up
13:38
and then go for the fleshy bit inside
13:41
and that's like uh i think still some
13:43
people in the countryside believe that i
13:44
don't know if it's true or not but a lot
13:45
of people like it right they also are
13:48
immune to snake venom mostly or not
13:50
completely immune but almost completely
13:51
resistant to snake venom right so uh
13:53
they can hedgehogs have been known to
13:55
kill snakes poisonous snakes wow
13:57
they can bite back and they do this
13:59
other sorry
14:00
just doing a run of hedgehog facts now
14:02
uh but they cover themselves in really
14:04
gross substances and we don't know why
14:06
so they roll around
14:07
don't they like they spit on themselves
14:09
a little bit yeah exactly so when they
14:11
find weird stuff like turpentine which
14:13
is obviously very potent or tobacco
14:16
they'll chew it and then they like get a
14:17
little lather worked up in their mouth
14:19
and they spit all over their spines so
14:21
they cover themselves in terps or
14:23
tobacco or something like that and we
14:25
don't know why it is it might be to make
14:26
their spines a little bit toxic
14:28
or it might be to kill parasites but it
14:30
might just be i read one one idea was
14:32
that it's that they were trying to
14:34
camouflage themselves the smell would
14:36
create a sort of camouflaged effect and
14:38
i just love the idea that it there's no
14:40
truth to that and the hedgehogs don't
14:41
know it and they're just walking
14:45
[Music]
14:47
he thinks i'm a cigarette
14:50
i hope no one smokes me
14:51
[Laughter]
14:53
you know um when you're playing sonic
14:55
the hedgehog if you go underwater uh
14:57
sonic drowns and you lose a life okay it
15:00
they they forgot to fact check that
15:03
because uh hedgehogs actually can swim
15:06
so there's a lot of unnecessary death is
15:08
what i'm saying i'm thinking about
15:09
humans again
15:11
no hedgehogs can swim are they yeah yeah
15:13
for a bit so
15:15
[Laughter]
15:17
they real they were actually quite
15:18
regretful of the fact that they didn't
15:20
fact check uh the fact that they could
15:21
swim because that could have led to
15:23
great so you know some great underwater
15:24
levels they should have had sonic died
15:26
by a fox urinating on his face
15:32
uh should we move on to the next one
15:33
yeah let's move on okay it's time for
15:35
fact number three and that is chozinski
15:38
my fact this week is that the english
15:40
philosopher herbert spencer had an angry
15:42
suit specially made which he wore only
15:44
when he was feeling irritable
15:46
so
15:47
this herbert spencer uh just to go
15:50
through who he is he's basically charles
15:52
darwin
15:55
but he's also not charles darwin
15:58
so he's the guy first of all he
16:00
popularized the term evolution he said
16:02
that in 1852 i think in a book he wrote
16:05
which was seven years before darwin
16:07
wrote the original species and even in
16:09
the origin of species darwin used it
16:10
very sparingly he only used evolution
16:12
for the first time in the sixth edition
16:14
i think whereas herbert spencer was
16:15
using it all over the shop and he also
16:17
came up with the term survival of the
16:19
fittest
16:20
and then darwin liked that and so he
16:22
used the term survival of the fittest to
16:24
replace the term natural selection which
16:26
he'd come up with which wasn't nearly as
16:27
catchy and darwin called him 20 times my
16:30
superior totally loved him wow
16:32
and he had some kind of suit what's this
16:34
suit oh yeah right the suit so it was a
16:37
it was a woolly garment apparently and
16:40
it was designed so that there would be
16:41
minimal exertion in getting dressed
16:43
because i guess when he's in a bad mood
16:44
he doesn't want to have to go to the
16:45
trouble of putting proper clothes on and
16:47
so it was basically an elaborate onesie
16:50
but it has a shoes fitted and a coat
16:52
fitted and you just stepped in with your
16:54
legs first and then you got your
16:55
shoulders in and you zipped it up and
16:58
you just well
17:00
then you went and beat some people up
17:02
and then yeah you had boots trousers and
17:04
cotton and sometimes he wore it for
17:06
weeks at a time apparently that's how
17:08
angry man
17:10
i read that he got angrier when he was
17:12
wearing it because people kept laughing
17:13
at him
17:17
yeah
17:18
people would stare at him in the streets
17:20
but i had no idea that the onesie um
17:22
yeah went back that far because we've
17:24
talked before on the podcast about maybe
17:26
churchill invented the onesie because he
17:27
had a special it's like a suit it was an
17:29
adapted boiler suit which he would wear
17:31
in the cabinet wall room so i thought
17:32
that was the very first uh onesie but
17:35
this is definitely earlier so um herbert
17:37
spencer was quite a weird guy wasn't he
17:39
yeah he was blind he decided he should
17:41
avoid all over stimulation for the sake
17:43
of his health and so if he thought
17:45
conversation was getting a bit too
17:47
excited he would move to another room
17:50
it was quite good and if he ever sat
17:52
next to an ugly person at dinner he
17:54
would move so he wouldn't risk his
17:56
digestion
17:58
he would also if um he didn't have the
18:00
liberty to move to another room he
18:01
always carried earplugs with him so that
18:03
if conversation was boring to him or
18:05
getting him over excited he would just
18:06
put earplugs in to block out irritating
18:09
people i read that he put them in if he
18:11
was losing in an argument
18:15
so it's basically la la la
18:18
he invented the la la la
18:21
that's the thing you know he also is
18:22
said to have invented the prototype of
18:25
um the paper clip yes really so it
18:27
sounds like he's invented a lot of
18:29
things but this whole survival of the
18:30
fittest thing is really getting the
18:31
headline
18:33
on quite an extraordinary life one of
18:35
his paper clips is in the british
18:37
library i think uh you can still see it
18:39
but it was quite successful in his time
18:41
it made him 70 pounds in profit in its
18:43
first year wow which in those days was a
18:45
lot of money um but then it kind of you
18:47
know stopped being that popular after
18:49
that um i i was looking into other
18:51
interesting suits that have been
18:53
invented okay and there's a there's a
18:55
really exciting one which is bat senses
18:57
suit and so the idea and it's actually
18:59
for blind people to really it's a really
19:01
great idea it helps to sense when
19:04
objects are nearer it's a really
19:05
advanced bit of technology that they're
19:07
working on so that you have the ability
19:09
to i guess an advanced version of the
19:12
walking stick uh
19:14
that that can help you find it's that
19:15
kind of thing so they've been inventing
19:17
that that's in a prototype stage at the
19:19
moment okay which is really like it's
19:20
like having whiskers basically yeah
19:22
sensing stuff around you that's so cool
19:24
yeah it's amazing and then this is not a
19:26
suit but um a lady called eleanor bodnar
19:29
who's a scientist uh invented a bra that
19:32
doubles as a gas mask which is really
19:34
cool the idea is that in the event of a
19:37
very chaotic moment of gas going off
19:39
everywhere uh you can just take the bra
19:41
off and you can put it over your face
19:43
but it actually works um really do you
19:45
know there's um some cows in russia that
19:47
are wearing bras
19:49
oh really yeah
19:50
in siberia
19:52
because it's so cold that their nipples
19:54
will freeze if they don't wear these
19:56
brows
19:57
so hedgehogs can't quite get through the
19:58
bride
20:00
they're fumbling around with the straps
20:02
[Music]
20:04
when they've scaled the side of the
20:06
glass
20:07
they can do it okay they can climb
20:10
i will go to the wall over this one
20:13
um have they been moved there because
20:14
presumably they didn't evolve to be in
20:16
siberia where their nipples would no but
20:17
of course there are farmers in siberia
20:19
and people need you know food and
20:21
whatever cows in siberia are they doing
20:23
this place in
20:24
khan
20:25
which is in siberia and the local civic
20:28
leader said that the um the cows seem to
20:31
like it because it can't be nice to have
20:33
such cold teats
20:35
actually just on cows because i found
20:38
the most amazing thing about cows the
20:39
other day that maybe everyone knows but
20:41
a lot of cows have windows in their
20:42
stomachs so um this is so we can study
20:45
cows digestion and like work out how to
20:48
feed them better work out what they
20:50
should be eating we've got these
20:51
portholes these transparent portholes
20:53
which we've done and created in a
20:56
painless operation apparently according
20:58
to the people who've done it yeah good
20:59
according to the cows
21:03
it's so creepy though you should look it
21:05
up and it works exactly like a petrol
21:06
cap on a car so you can unscrew it
21:09
really easily if you're a vet let's say
21:11
you unscrew it and you can dip your arm
21:12
into a cow's stomach and you pull out
21:14
the contents of its stomach so one of
21:16
the applications for example is if
21:18
you've got a really sick cow that's not
21:19
digesting stuff very well then you go to
21:21
the healthy cow that's got the window in
21:23
its stomach and then you unscrew it and
21:25
you put your hand in and you pick out
21:27
the grass from in the stomach and you
21:28
squeeze out its digestive juices because
21:30
that cow has good digestive juices and
21:32
then you insert the digestive juices
21:34
into the sick cow and then you put the
21:36
grass back in the cow's stomach and it's
21:37
like nothing ever happened isn't that
21:39
bizarre
21:41
i gotta say if dan had said all that i
21:42
wouldn't believe the word of it
21:47
um hey can i talk very quickly about um
21:50
how other people have dealt with their
21:51
anger yeah please so anger management
21:54
mel gibson when he got on the tr in all
21:56
the trouble he got into um he did an
21:58
anger management course uh his first
22:01
meeting immediately he had a verbal
22:03
argument
22:04
with the guy leading the meeting over a
22:07
name tag that he was wearing
22:09
saying i don't need to wear a name tag
22:10
everyone knows i [ __ ] am already
22:12
don't they and uh and then the guy was
22:14
like okay so i think you actually do
22:16
need to do this course
22:17
[Laughter]
22:19
um
22:20
in dallas is a place you can go to
22:22
called an anger room
22:24
oh yeah you can just basically smash it
22:27
up they put a load of stuff there which
22:29
is smashable they give you a baseball
22:30
bat and they say do your worst and it's
22:33
the you know you pay i don't know 50 for
22:35
15 minutes and you can smash up as much
22:37
as you like and it's supposed to be a
22:38
way to let it all out 15 minutes is a
22:40
long time to be that angry
22:42
actually um i've just found that um so
22:45
for five minutes you get something which
22:47
is called i need a break and you get
22:49
five minutes in the younger room
22:52
okay
22:53
15 minutes is 45 and that's called the
22:56
lash out session and for 25 minutes of
22:59
total demolition
23:02
you have to pay 75
23:04
presumably you need to pre-book to get
23:06
your anger room so it must be when
23:09
you're in the moment of absolute fury so
23:11
imagine how bad the job is for the
23:13
receptionist taking those phone calls
23:16
i need an angry room right now sorry
23:17
sorry sir we don't have a room for
23:19
another week
23:22
that would be the worst job
23:24
you could ever have
23:26
um so just quickly back to herbert
23:29
spencer because he was a hilarious
23:30
character yeah just one more funny thing
23:32
about him he was obsessed with taking
23:33
his pulse so he was a hypochondriac um
23:35
and he uh used to when he went out in a
23:38
carriage i think he was a bit afraid of
23:39
travel when he went out in a carriage um
23:41
then he suddenly shout out stop and uh
23:44
in the middle of traffic in piccadilly
23:46
or regent street or whatever the
23:47
carriage would have to stop dead all
23:48
traffic's disrupted silence reigns and
23:51
he has to consult the dick taps of his
23:54
pulse this source says and if his pulse
23:56
is too fast the carriage immediately had
23:58
to turn around and go home and if not he
24:00
could go on and similarly at train
24:02
stations he would bring
24:04
first of all he'd bring a woman to train
24:06
stations when he was going to get on a
24:07
train specifically to read to him and
24:09
then to wave him off as he departed
24:12
and before getting on the train he'd
24:14
make his secretary take his temperature
24:16
in a waiting room uh if his temperature
24:18
was fine they had to string up a hammock
24:19
in first class and he was good to go if
24:22
his temperature was too high then he
24:24
sent the train away and stayed behind
24:29
i'm sure he didn't have the authority to
24:30
do that
24:32
get out of here
24:33
depart for another 10 minutes i said get
24:35
out of here
24:37
he was a powerful man
24:39
he sent the train away well he stayed
24:40
behind having his head wrapped in
24:42
vinegar and brown paper oh really that's
24:44
the thing yeah it was a thing it was a
24:46
thing it's in the first ever uh version
24:49
of jack-jack
24:50
yeah yeah the second the jack-and-jill
24:51
went up the hill to fetch up by the wall
24:52
so jack fell down and broke his crown
24:54
and just came tumbling after and then
24:55
there's a second verse up jack gartz and
24:57
honda trots as fast as he could caper
24:59
and he went to bed amend his head with
25:01
vinegar and brown paper it's a victorian
25:03
version that says unpatched his knob
25:05
with vinegar around brown paper but they
25:06
mean his head but that was an old word
25:08
for your head your knob
25:11
imagine the confusion
25:15
should we move on to our next fact yeah
25:17
let's move on yeah okay it is time for
25:19
our final fact of the show and that is
25:21
my fact my fact this week is in order
25:24
for spider-man to climb buildings he
25:26
would need size 89 feet
25:30
so they've just worked this out you may
25:31
have seen it in the news uh they've just
25:33
worked out that spider-man could not
25:36
literally climb buildings with the size
25:38
feet and hands that he has on the other
25:40
hand if he was called hedgehog man he
25:41
would have no problem
25:44
well he could certainly get into a first
25:46
floor plan
25:51
yeah so i mean can we clarify what
25:54
because i don't know spider-man as well
25:56
as some so why wouldn't he just have to
25:58
have super strong super glue on his
26:00
hands and then they could be any size uh
26:02
is it something through the surface area
26:04
of his hands that causes them to stick
26:05
to this i think what this is is it's
26:07
done by zoologists isn't it yes and
26:09
these are people who are studying geckos
26:11
that climb up and they use van der waals
26:12
forces on their on their hands and their
26:15
paws to climb up things but it depends
26:17
on how big the surface is that how easy
26:19
it is for them to hold on now if
26:21
spider-man used this kind of tactic for
26:23
climbing up walls and he'd need massive
26:24
feet but do we know that he does he
26:27
could just be using super glue the van
26:29
der waals force i don't know that super
26:30
glue works that well because you just
26:32
get stuck
26:34
imagine seeing him right at the ground
26:36
floor
26:39
yeah but the idea is it's a really good
26:41
point because the weight increases so
26:43
much um
26:45
with uh with your volume so um
26:48
geckos use about four percent of their
26:50
body surface area to climb and even
26:53
smaller animals like mites they use 0.02
26:56
because they're so light in comparison
26:57
with the surface area that uses this
26:59
force okay so
27:01
for a human of the average weight to do
27:03
it you'd have to have adhesive pads
27:04
covering uh 40 of your body to climb and
27:08
that's of your total body so it would be
27:09
80 of your front
27:11
so it would you would you would need
27:12
basically all of you to be sticking to
27:14
the wall before you climb up wow you'd
27:16
have to shuffle up really weirdly yeah
27:19
yeah geckos um actually uh when they're
27:22
sticking to walls in the ceilings they
27:23
kind of walk on air don't they because
27:25
they trap um so
27:27
they've got tiny hairs on their feet and
27:30
that when they're on when they're on a
27:32
wet surface so usually on a wet surface
27:34
i think the van der waals force would
27:35
mean that you you would slip off it
27:37
would be too slippery but they trap air
27:39
bubbles between these little hairs and
27:41
so essentially when they're walking on a
27:42
wet surface up a wall or on a ceiling
27:44
they're walking on a thin layer of air
27:46
wow that's really cool yeah so they're
27:48
hovering yep exactly they're hovercrafts
27:50
that's incredible do you know that half
27:52
the geckos in the world half the species
27:54
of gecko can't climb up walls
27:59
i didn't know that that's quite cool the
28:00
world's stickiest salamander is a
28:02
northern slimy salamander
28:05
and it's so sticky it gives off this
28:06
substance that's so sticky that if any
28:08
predator tries to bite it its mucus
28:11
immediately seals the predator's mouth
28:13
shut whoa that's a good kind of thing to
28:16
have is that cool yeah yeah god um just
28:19
because we were saying about my idiot
28:21
mistake the fact that superglue would
28:23
actually just stick you to a wall um
28:25
flies have this problem i think so flies
28:28
have sticky feet
28:30
so they you know can walk up walls and
28:32
across ceilings but then they also have
28:34
to have little claws on their legs so
28:36
they can scrape their feet off once they
28:39
when they need to move them so they
28:40
stick to a surface and then they have to
28:42
claw claw their leg off in order to move
28:44
it again that's great it's weird when
28:45
you when you get to that kind of level
28:47
of um life uh where things become much
28:50
more sticky because water is a big
28:52
problem for flies and other insects
28:54
because it's actually really sticky and
28:56
apparently uh surprisingly sticky for
28:58
humans as well water so if you get out
29:01
of the shower for example if you get out
29:03
of the shower a lot of water sticks to
29:04
you if you haven't wiped down properly
29:06
when you get out of shower you're a
29:08
pound heavier that's how much the water
29:09
weighs that is sticking to you as you
29:11
get out of the shower that's very cool
29:13
yeah uh some stuff on spider-man yeah
29:16
so the first spider-man comic is from
29:18
1962 but the word spider-man dates back
29:21
to 1955
29:23
and the word spider-man originally meant
29:25
someone who works on very high
29:26
structures
29:27
like a staple jack really yeah that's
29:30
very good that's good that isn't it yeah
29:31
they call them white so why were they
29:33
called i guess just because
29:34
yeah like a spider climbing up a wall or
29:36
a hedgehog or whatever they're like you
29:38
know
29:39
working somewhere really high and a lot
29:41
of those guys were itsy bitsy as well
29:42
[Laughter]
29:44
spiders uh just quickly on climbing
29:46
things they have um
29:48
they have 600 000 micro hairs on their
29:52
legs in contact that can contact the
29:54
walls six hundred thousand and they can
29:56
support um this has been studied by uh
29:58
germany's institute of technical zoology
30:01
uh 170 times their own weight
30:04
and the guys who study this said that's
30:06
like spider-man clinging to the flat
30:07
surface of a window by his finger tips
30:10
and toes only while rescuing 170 adults
30:13
who are clinging onto his back wow yeah
30:16
that's amazing isn't that fantastic yeah
30:18
they are better than his and this is why
30:20
there's a mystery about spiders the
30:22
great spider mystery is why don't they
30:23
stick to their own webs because they can
30:25
support that and they've got all these
30:26
tiny hairs but we don't quite know but i
30:29
think we think that they lick a sort of
30:31
lubricant onto their hairs which means
30:33
that they slide over their webs quite
30:34
easily and uh someone in i think in 1905
30:38
a french naturalist tested this so he
30:40
put solvents on spiders legs and he
30:42
found out that once you did that then it
30:44
would dissolve the lubricant that they'd
30:46
licked on and so they would stick to
30:47
their webs and then we decided to repeat
30:49
the experiment recently and just pluck
30:51
the legs off spiders and tested it again
30:54
and it's true so they lick they salivate
30:56
onto their legs to make sure they slide
30:57
over their webs okay wow um i did some
31:00
calculations about shoe sizes oh yeah um
31:03
over this weekend
31:04
so i worked out that if i was a foot i
31:07
would need a size 195 shoe
31:11
if it was a size 195 shoe and i was a
31:13
foot i would perfectly my height would
31:16
fit so i'd be able to lie perfectly
31:18
inside the shoe is that uk sizes uk size
31:20
yeah okay
31:22
did your wife have a fun weekend
31:26
honey honey quick quick put me in here
31:28
slowly
31:32
would you go face up or face down
31:33
[Laughter]
31:36
if you were a foot
31:38
you know i don't think this working out
31:40
is getting the respect it deserves sorry
31:43
you said something else
31:45
yeah uh if the uk was a fud
31:50
sweetie no no this time it's really
31:52
important come back
31:54
if the uk was a foot it would need a
31:56
size
31:57
175 million eight hundred and seventy
32:00
four thousand nine hundred and seventy
32:02
four shoe according to my calculations
32:05
big shoe which is approximately two
32:07
hundred million european size
32:09
wow
32:10
you just should have done if italy was a
32:12
foot
32:18
okay that's it that's all of our facts
32:20
thank you so much for being here if you
32:22
would like to get in contact with any of
32:24
us about the things that we've said over
32:25

00:28
tiny thing uh the sound quality on this
00:31
podcast is terrible really sorry about
00:34
that we had a few issues in the venue on
00:36
the night hope you can tolerate it
00:38

[Music]
00:52
[Applause]
00:53
[Music]
00:54
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:58
no such thing as official weekly podcast
01:00
this week coming to you from canterbury
01:02
my name is dan schreiber and please
01:04
welcome to the stage it's the three
01:05
regulars anna chazinski james harkin and
01:08
andy murray
01:12
[Music]
01:15
thank you
01:16
[Applause]
01:18
this is great and once again we have
01:21
gathered around the microphones with our
01:22
four favorite facts and in no particular
01:25
order here we go starting with you james
01:28
harkin okay my fact this week is that
01:31
the first water balloons were made out
01:34
of socks
01:36
so
01:37
sort of cotton
01:38
oh no
01:39
[Music]
01:46
this was it was invented by a guy called
01:48
edgar ellington and he was trying to
01:50
come up with a thing that could kind of
01:51
treat trench foot so the idea that you
01:54
would get your feet very wet and it
01:55
could cause problems he wanted to stop
01:57
that and so he wanted to make socks that
01:59
were made out of rubber out of latex the
02:01
main problem he had was putting the
02:02
socks on because they were so kind of
02:04
latexy and you couldn't get them on and
02:06
then once he even managed to sort that
02:08
out he thought well i'll just make sure
02:10
they're waterproof so he put a load of
02:11
water in there there was a little bit of
02:13
old leak and he was like oh a little bit
02:15
of a leak and he threw it and then it
02:16
smashed on the floor water went
02:18
everywhere and he thought aha
02:21
he called them water grenades initially
02:23
did he mean them for war
02:27
well people still call them water bombs
02:29
i think sometimes yeah yeah but yeah
02:31
it's still not used for war
02:33
water pistols not used for holding up
02:35
banks this is why my crime syndicate is
02:37
not done so well
02:39
it's a shame nobody's invented the water
02:40
mortar
02:42
[Music]
02:42
[Laughter]
02:44
there is a guy in america who did a
02:46
kickstarter campaign he's called josh
02:48
malone he created a device that can blow
02:50
up 100 water balloons in one minute i
02:53
think so it feels like about 36 at a
02:54
time it's very impressive the worst
02:56
thing about water balloons is when you
02:58
have to tie them up at the end that's
02:59
always really fiddly but they have
03:01
invented some self-tying water balloons
03:04
wow
03:04
yeah they sound great right um i saw an
03:07
article in the wall street journal of
03:08
old places about these things
03:10
and it said it works really well you
03:12
kind of fill it up and then you put it
03:13
back together and it kind of self-seals
03:15
but the problem is that the balloons are
03:17
so well made that when you throw them at
03:18
people they just bounce off them
03:21
that's not well made at all then
03:24
that's what that is how water balloons
03:26
work if you want to get someone you
03:27
throw it at the ground you never throw
03:29
it at a person because it just ricochets
03:30
off their head you need to chuck it on
03:32
the ground oh
03:33
yeah cool well i was gonna i wonder if
03:35
we've got the same idea throw it at a
03:37
person but then chase after it with a
03:38
pin and then smash it as it hits the
03:42
person is that your thoughts not exactly
03:43
my thought was to make everyone in a
03:45
water balloon fight wear a suit made of
03:47
nails
03:47
[Laughter]
03:52
so the boy scouts water weapons are
03:56
slightly illegal in the boy scouts
03:58
you're not allowed to have water pistol
03:59
fights in the boy scouts you are allowed
04:01
to have water balloon fights but i was
04:03
reading through it there's a really odd
04:05
tiny stipulation you can only use water
04:07
balloons no bigger than a ping-pong ball
04:10
what has anyone seen a water balloon
04:12
that size they have made ping pong balls
04:15
bigger recently have they because they
04:17
wanted to make ping pong better or table
04:18
tennis better on television so they made
04:20
the ball bigger so you'll be able to see
04:21
it better you need to make the sport
04:23
better on television
04:24
you need suits made of nails
04:28
i was reading this uh this blog by a guy
04:30
who works for the scouts and he was
04:32
saying here is a list of things and
04:34
these are like official things that
04:36
you're not allowed to do as scouts or
04:37
use when you're fighting with each other
04:39
or playing with each other out in the
04:40
field at scout camp so it makes sense
04:43
you know bottle rockets crossbows
04:46
like guns guns big guns tanks
04:50
anvil shooting you know a lot of
04:52
shooting angles at people that's on the
04:54
list
05:00
[Laughter]
05:07
i think it's just texas university where
05:09
um you are not allowed to have water
05:12
guns on campus but you are allowed to
05:14
have actual guns
05:18
yeah water pistols have been banned this
05:19
year on a campus where everyone's got
05:21
actual guns in their lockers
05:23
because water you can drown in water
05:25
that's the thing
05:28
no one drowns in a bullet
05:34
so i was reading about balloons
05:36
generally and sales of helium balloons
05:38
have gone down recently because people
05:39
are worried about the environmental
05:40
impact of the plastic around them which
05:42
actually uh if it's just an ordinary
05:45
latex helium balloon it's not that bad
05:46
because it goes about five miles up into
05:49
the atmosphere i think and then it
05:52
freezes and it breaks into little
05:54
slivers and it takes about as long to
05:55
biodegrade as like a leaf or something
05:58
so it's not that bad for the environment
06:00
but
06:01
it is very wasteful for helium and so
06:03
it's really an article that because
06:04
helium is a precious commodity and we're
06:05
using it up very faster than we're
06:08
finding it so this article was saying as
06:10
an alternative to releasing helium
06:12
balloons environmentalists have
06:14
suggested dropping non-helium balloons
06:16
from a tall building
06:20
blowing bubbles
06:22
or planting a tree
06:24
[Laughter]
06:26
you're running out of ideas
06:30
that's amazing we are running out
06:33
prices of helium
06:34
in the last 10 years and um do you know
06:36
who owns 35 of the world's helium they
06:39
use most of it for mri scans and stuff
06:41
don't they so yeah
06:43
well it's the usa it's they've got a
06:45
national helium reserve oh yes yeah they
06:47
stockpiled a huge amount of it because
06:49
it's the second most abundant element in
06:51
the universe
06:52
but on earth it's really rare because it
06:53
just keeps floating away basically
06:56
it's pretty frustrating
06:58
it's very useful for making um
07:06
[Laughter]
07:11
but then people have said that's quite
07:12
cruel and
07:18
[Laughter]
07:21
there is a certain truth to that i think
07:23
because one of the first people who
07:25
might not have invented it but one of
07:26
the first people to make balloons like
07:27
we know was michael faraday and he was
07:29
using it for his experiments and it was
07:31
experiments with gases and whatever and
07:33
he needed a place to keep the gases so
07:35
he did event balloons that way
07:38
yeah
07:38
anyway we're going to run out of helium
07:40
in 40 years if we keep consuming it at
07:41
the rate we are so really so enjoy it
07:43
guys
07:44
go nuts while it's still cheap
07:48
i was reading about um toys or toys that
07:50
were invented for other purposes so the
07:52
silly string was invented by two guys
07:54
called robert cox and leonard fish and
07:56
they were not trying to create silly
07:57
string they were trying to create a
07:59
spray-on cast for broken bones or
08:01
sprains then when they were um trying
08:04
the different nozzles that they would
08:05
apply it with it they sort of created
08:07
one that made it really fun basically
08:09
made a move like silly string and they
08:10
thought this could be a toy so they made
08:12
an appointment with this um uh company
08:14
in california called wammo and this is
08:16
this is from the um account on wikipedia
08:18
it seems very detailed and well written
08:20
fish describes how during that meeting
08:22
he sprayed the can all over the person
08:24
he was meeting
08:30
[Laughter]
08:35
and then one of the bosses of the
08:37
company walked into this guy's office a
08:38
day later and there was a bit of it
08:40
still stuck on the lampshade and he said
08:41
what is that and he explained and they
08:42
immediately said get them back here we
08:44
have to make that into a toy yeah they
08:46
use silly string in i think in the iraq
08:48
wall to kind of find tripwires as well
08:51
really nice
08:53
yeah no it does because it's just so you
08:55
can see it it's just like you're not
08:56
sure where they are so you spray the
08:58
silly string and then if it lays on
08:59
something you know not to what that oh i
09:01
thought you meant we used the silly
09:03
string
09:08
because the soldiers started writing
09:10
home to relatives saying can you send
09:11
out some silly string so supposedly the
09:14
army realized this would be the american
09:15
army realized this would be a really
09:17
good idea and they wanted to transport
09:19
it out to the troops but apparently it
09:21
can't be officially shipped because it's
09:23
an aerosol and that's dangerous which
09:25
may be yeah but they transport bombs
09:26
around the place
09:29
there were 80 000 cans stockpiled in new
09:32
jersey because apparently they just
09:33
couldn't get it over they eventually
09:34
found someone who could ship it
09:38
i've got a test question actually so you
09:40
might prefer dan's but i'm talking now
09:41
so
09:45
my question is if you line up a row of
09:48
water balloons and you get a
09:51
gun it's a magnum uh and it's a magnum
09:54
where the bullets leave it at a thousand
09:56
miles an hour and you place the magnum
09:58
nose first against the first water
10:00
balloon and this long row of water
10:01
balloons how many balloons you think
10:03
it'll burst before the balloons stop the
10:05
bullet oh wow are we including air
10:07
resistant i'm just doing the calculation
10:09
here is it
10:11
but it's four balloons four wow so yeah
10:13
just every time someone's shooting at
10:15
you just stand behind four water
10:16
balloons
10:26
okay it's time for fact number two and
10:28
that is my fact my fact this week is
10:31
that you can't write in french on french
10:34
computer keyboards you cannot type in
10:36
proper french on french computer
10:38
keyboards and the french government are
10:40
now changing they've said we need to
10:42
change all french computer keyboards
10:45
it's missing the accents it's missing
10:46
very basic stuff that you would need in
10:48
order to write a normal sentence in
10:50
french and as a result they think that
10:52
the french language is really losing its
10:54
way amongst the younger generation who
10:56
are exclusively doing it through typing
10:58
um well those so on keyboards this is
11:00
actually going to be really tense from
11:01
here on in uh because i think james and
11:03
i disagree on this but our keyboards are
11:06
not ideal some people would
11:08
[Music]
11:10
right the qwerty keyboard became uh the
11:14
standard keyboard uh mistakenly it was
11:16
an accident so in a normal working day
11:19
for someone who's a secretary who's
11:20
typing all day for instance uh on a
11:22
qwerty keyboard your hands your fingers
11:24
will cover 20 miles which is amazing
11:25
anyway very good exercise for your
11:26
fingers um on a qwerty keyboard they'll
11:29
cover that and on a dvorak keyboard
11:31
which is the suggested replacement
11:33
they'll cover one mile typing the same
11:35
stuff
11:36
because it's just much better laid out
11:37
so on a qwerty keyboard all the most
11:39
commonly used vowels and consonants are
11:41
either on the top row or the bottom row
11:42
there's hardly any on the middle row so
11:44
i think 52 percent of strokes are on the
11:46
top row which is absurd it's exhausting
11:49
but if your fingers are only walking one
11:50
mile a day when we all get fat fingers
11:53
yeah
11:54
and isn't that a good thing
11:56
no it's very nice august dvarak who um
11:59
invented this keyboard that you seem to
12:01
be so keen on um he died actually in
12:03
1975 and just before he died he said i'm
12:07
tired of trying to do something
12:08
worthwhile for the human race
12:10
they simply don't want to change
12:17
yeah it's people like you who won't
12:20
accept for instance the fact that the
12:22
vowels on a qwerty keyboard are
12:24
distributed on on both sides which
12:27
doesn't make any sense because mostly in
12:29
the english language vowels are followed
12:31
by consonants and vice versa so it makes
12:33
a lot more sense for the vowel to be on
12:34
one side and the consonants are to be on
12:36
the other side otherwise
12:39
i'll give some evidence um the highest
12:41
typing speed in history was 216 words
12:44
per minute and that was done on the
12:45
qwerty keyboard and yet the vast
12:47
majority of uh typing speed records have
12:50
been broken by four keyboards the
12:52
absolute fastest
12:54
what's on her quality
12:59
i'm over it i'm over it you don't want
13:01
to change fine
13:03
so 216 words per minute that's the
13:05
fastest typing speed in history um the
13:07
fastest handwriting speed is 350 words
13:10
per minute uh that's done shorthand did
13:12
anyone read that
13:14
only the person who wrote it i guess
13:17
and the fastest talking is
13:20
637 words per minute and this is a
13:23
british guy called steve woodmore who
13:25
you can go on youtube and see him
13:27
talking and not understand the word he's
13:29
saying
13:30
but he kind of reads like to be or not
13:32
to be that is the question and stuff
13:33
like that and raise it really really
13:34
fast um if you look on his wikipedia
13:37
page which he has um it says that he
13:39
once read the entire united kingdom tax
13:42
code and it took him five days to do it
13:45
and that's the fastest reader of all
13:46
time a gripping video
13:49
you do have five days to spare and um
13:52
also on wiki it says fast talking aside
13:55
woodmore also acts as an electronic
13:57
salesman for curries
13:58
[Laughter]
14:01
the original quality keyboard the guy
14:03
who created it christopher latham
14:05
scholes uh this was in 1867 and so this
14:07
was before he thought of qwerty um it
14:09
only had two rows and it was compared to
14:12
a piano keyboard and it only had eight
14:14
numbers on it because he said you should
14:16
use the
14:16
uh the o and the i to be the zero and
14:19
the one so it's trying for maximum
14:21
efficiency oh wow
14:23
okay so there's a thing called the
14:24
qwerty effect have you guys seen this
14:26
it's where two people on either side of
14:28
your
14:30
[Laughter]
14:33
[Applause]
14:37
the qwerty effect is much more positive
14:39
than that no the quality of fact this is
14:41
weird so people have tested this and
14:43
apparently it seems to be true that
14:45
letters typed with your right hand are
14:47
considered to be more positive than
14:49
those types with your left hand and
14:51
they've looked at into it and they found
14:52
that you know since like keyboards have
14:54
become regular people with names with um
14:57
letters on the right hand have become
14:58
more common and things like that so it
15:00
does seem to be an effect that people
15:02
feel more positive about things with
15:04
their right hand than with their left
15:06
hand the j for james is with the right
15:08
hand and the a for anna and andy and the
15:14
and the first study i saw published on
15:16
this it was a few years ago said that
15:18
typing sad makes you miserable because
15:20
it's left hand and typing jolly makes
15:23
you happy because it's the right hand
15:24
maybe it just makes you miserable cause
15:25
the kind of people who are typing sad
15:26
and signing emails saying i'm very sad
15:29
today
15:30
it's true because it also means that
15:32
writing ace breasts carefree or sex
15:35
would make you sad whereas writing
15:38
pooing would make you happy
15:39
[Music]
15:42
we need to move on to the next fact you
15:44
guys got anything else nope okay it's
15:46
time for fact number three and that is
15:49
andy my fact is that archers at the
15:52
battle of agincourt had three arrows in
15:54
the air at any given moment uh this was
15:57
in an interview with a guy who's a
15:59
senior archer and it sounds kind of
16:01
impossible but it's sort of a reflection
16:03
of how
16:04
fast the rate of fire was for a medieval
16:07
longbowmen so uh longbows were the
16:09
things which really clinched the battle
16:11
of hashem caught they're about six feet
16:13
tall a long boat is taller than a lot of
16:15
the people who would have been carrying
16:17
them and they were just incredibly
16:19
powerful so for example a medieval
16:21
archer could fire at least 10 arrows in
16:24
a minute maybe even more we're not we're
16:26
not sure but there were 5 000 archers on
16:28
the english side at the battle of
16:30
eastern core and that is even at six
16:32
hours a minute that's 30 000 arrows
16:34
moving towards uh the french mana times
16:36
a minute and the big thing was they had
16:39
the french had to move across a very
16:40
short distance it was about 200 paces to
16:42
get to the english line but during that
16:45
time would have taken them about four
16:46
minutes at least at least 120 000 arrows
16:49
would have been fired at them
16:52
they were so heavy duty to use though
16:54
weren't they long bows so they were this
16:56
they were um unbelievably effective and
16:58
it is why at the battle of agincourt the
17:00
british the english um with far far
17:03
fewer forces were able to defeat the
17:05
french um but so heavy duty so the draw
17:09
weight which is the weight equivalent of
17:11
what you have to hold when you're
17:12
pulling back the arrow was up to 200
17:15
pounds which is 14 stone so it's the
17:18
equivalent of lifting up a 14 stone
17:20
person just with your right hand as you
17:23
draw the bow wow
17:25
and when you look at um skeletons of
17:27
archers you can identify them because
17:29
they have elongated bones and like
17:31
swollen bones in there uh in their arrow
17:33
arm and they have marks where they would
17:35
have had their bow
17:37
on their wrists and their shoulder so
17:38
lots of these guys the archers at the
17:40
battle of belgium who all uh english and
17:42
welsh they were naked from the waist
17:45
down no yeah like donald duck it's
17:47
awesome
17:51
interestingly donald duck can fire 10
17:53
arrows a minute
17:55
huge draw strength
18:02
it was a huge problem they were
18:04
completely exhausted before the battle
18:05
they'd been marching many miles a day
18:07
for about a fortnight they were in enemy
18:09
territory they'd won one battle and
18:11
henry just really wanted to get them
18:12
home but he had to march around france a
18:15
bit so it wasn't a completely wasted
18:16
journey
18:18
as in they won what they won the siege
18:19
of her fleur and then he said well we
18:21
could go just home immediately but he
18:23
spent a lot of time and money raising
18:24
the funds for this war so he sort of was
18:26
embarrassed and all the men had
18:27
dysentery and so they just sort of cut
18:29
off their trousers and why didn't they
18:31
just pull them down
18:33
i have ridden the counseling they cut
18:35
them off
18:36
that's when it's bad
18:42
i actually read the uh the main opponent
18:44
who would have been so obviously henry v
18:46
was fighting on the english side and it
18:48
would have been charles vi who was
18:49
fighting on the french side but he
18:51
couldn't fight because he was uh
18:52
severely mentally ill people think now
18:54
he has schizophrenia and he also had
18:56
this thing called glass delusion where
18:58
he thought he was made of glass so he
19:00
couldn't really move or walk very much
19:02
but um one of the things that his uh
19:04
servants had to do was cut his clothes
19:06
off him because he never washed and sow
19:09
his clothes had hit him so much that
19:10
eventually they kept on having to cut
19:12
off his clothes
19:13
yeah so he in a way suffered in exactly
19:15
the same way those guys in battle did
19:17
without having to be there
19:18
yeah
19:21
so the place actually is called as in
19:23
core not aging core isn't it yeah it's a
19:25
french town called asinco and we've just
19:27
kind of anglicized it um there is a
19:30
battlefield museum there it's shaped
19:32
like a longbow which is quite cool it's
19:35
not the first museum that was there
19:36
there was one before um which was quite
19:38
a lot cheaper actually and they had a
19:42
model of the battle where the knights
19:44
were made out of action man figures
19:49
were they naked from the waist down
19:54
i was looking on wikipedia for a list of
19:57
famous archers
19:58
jeffrey yeah
20:02
he wasn't i looked at it i actually
20:04
looked at a different list
20:05
[Laughter]
20:07
it's a great list robin hood's on it
20:09
citation needed and the post i was i
20:12
read a familiar name so i quickly
20:14
clicked into it it's a guy called mad
20:16
jack churchill who if you don't know him
20:19
is the greatest world war ii eccentric
20:22
hero you could ever learn about so he
20:24
used to go into war with a longbow uh
20:27
sometimes a sword and most times
20:30
bagpipes
20:34
was just an eccentric and so he's yeah
20:36
he's credited as the only person in
20:37
world war ii to take the long boat
20:39
amazing do you know how henry v funded
20:41
his war at in asian court this hundred
20:43
years war oh he crowdfunded
20:46
yeah letters to lots of his friends and
20:50
to towns and then and he also lent them
20:52
royal jewelry and stuff and yeah one of
20:54
the people who lent him money was dick
20:56
whittington
20:57
yeah
20:58
isn't that weird yeah
21:00
there was a real person dick whittington
21:01
he was a rich cloth merchant and he
21:02
finally
21:03
[Laughter]
21:08
i'm sorry it's all right james he's
21:10
behind you
21:15
yeah um so in america a couple of years
21:18
ago they had a debate in a university
21:20
about whether henry v should be found
21:23
guilty of war crimes because after the
21:26
battle of agincourt he did i think kill
21:28
a load of french prisoners didn't he
21:31
and so former us solicitor general
21:33
gregory gary who was arguing against
21:36
henry v said that he didn't have a
21:37
legitimate claim to the french throne
21:39
because he traced his claim back only
21:41
six generations
21:43
and canon shan moongam who was arguing
21:46
on the other side just said war against
21:48
france is inherently lawful
21:52
[Laughter]
21:58
okay
21:59
all right well let's move on to our
22:01
final fact of the show and that is
22:03
chozinski
22:04
yeah my fact this week is that
22:06
right-handed marmosets are braver than
22:08
left-handed marmosets
22:09
[Music]
22:11
yeah it's uh this is true how uh well uh
22:15
various ways so they can tell how they
22:18
can tell if mama sets a right or
22:19
left-handed based on what objects they
22:22
what hand they choose to pick up their
22:23
objects with so you put an object in
22:25
front of them and if they pick up with
22:26
the right hand they're right-handed et
22:28
cetera and it's about 50 50 split right
22:30
and left-handed in mama says and um it
22:33
turns out the left-handed ones when
22:35
they're faced with a predator they
22:36
freeze for longer so they take longer to
22:38
move and run away um they are much more
22:42
cautious about sniffing out or tasting
22:44
kind of new food
22:46
they have a more negative outlook
22:50
what do you think about the chinese
22:51
economy
22:54
so the way
22:56
the way we know this is that they were
22:59
trained to under they were given white
23:01
bowls and black bowls and in one color
23:04
there would be a reward and in the other
23:05
color there wouldn't and they were
23:07
trained to
23:08
choose the bowls with the reward and to
23:10
not choose the ones without the reward
23:12
and then they started giving the
23:14
marmosets gray bowls and the
23:17
right-handed marmosets took the grey
23:19
ball they were like it's a lot like the
23:20
white ball i'm just gonna have it it's
23:22
probably got the food in it and the
23:23
left-handed marmosets didn't tell you
23:25
because i thought that looks a lot like
23:26
the black bowl to me i'm not gonna i bet
23:28
it hasn't done anything
23:31
exactly
23:32
are we all right-handers around this
23:34
table
23:35
[Music]
23:37
and i am terrified
23:41
so you are so humans are more fearful as
23:43
well if they're left-handed
23:45
there's a higher correlation so
23:48
for instance the way they tested this
23:50
one of the ways a bunch of studies have
23:51
shown it but they've showed people
23:53
silence the lambs the film and then they
23:55
questioned them afterwards about certain
23:57
scenes and asked them to recount certain
23:58
scenes and the left-handed people
24:00
stammered and started and freaked out
24:02
and screamed as they were recounting
24:04
scenes you've seen that movie
24:08
the sound of music is on the other side
24:10
[Laughter]
24:12
i'm a bit scared of that
24:17
isn't that the case though that the
24:18
world is just better equipped in sort of
24:20
our technology and so on for
24:22
right-handed people yeah so anyone in a
24:25
situation volunteering who will play
24:27
this guitar most likely it's a
24:28
right-handed
24:36
i will cut this paper with these because
24:38
they will be right-handed scissors like
24:40
surely we just we volunteer for more
24:42
stuff as right-handed people that's a
24:44
very good theory you should take it to
24:45
the uh the theorizers
24:49
so the the roman poet horus when he made
24:52
a mistake he wrote eggo livers which we
24:55
translate as silly me it actually means
24:56
left-handed me oh really yeah there's a
24:59
long history of this stuff yeah people
25:01
don't like left hand we're not going to
25:02
stand for it now we will
25:04
we're terrified
25:07
that's amazing about mama's heads yeah
25:10
it's really cool i mean and and we think
25:11
it extrapolates to humans but um mama
25:15
says are great so one thing they've
25:16
learned to do is learn from
25:18
instructional videos
25:19
a mama set was taught how to extract an
25:22
object that it wanted from a box though
25:24
you know a well-locked box and then it
25:26
was filmed extracting that object once
25:28
it had been taught to do that and then
25:29
the film of the mama said doing that was
25:32
placed in a room or a cage or whatever
25:33
with other marmosets and the marmosets
25:36
watched the film and then they were
25:38
given the box and they imitated what
25:40
happened in the film
25:41
which is quite cool
25:43
given that my cats don't know their own
25:44
reflection
25:46
[Laughter]
25:48
so um i'm just thinking i bet there's
25:51
people listening at home who didn't know
25:52
what mama said okay sorry and you've
25:54
just got 10 minutes talking about them
25:56
are they mammoths or are they marmara
26:00
yeah mom says you love them where you
26:01
hate them yeah
26:05
[Laughter]
26:09
[Applause]
26:09
[Music]
26:11
little tiny monkeys that live in south
26:13
america aren't they um they don't have
26:15
wisdom teeth that's one thing about them
26:17
um they're the only primates with like
26:19
tactile hairs that can kind of feel
26:21
things uh they have them on their wrists
26:23
um they go into torpa every day when the
26:26
sun is hottest so they kind of fall
26:27
asleep like have a siesta every day when
26:30
it gets really hot like spanish oh cool
26:33
and they're the only primates apart from
26:35
humans where you can stare into their
26:36
eyes and they won't think you're being
26:38
aggressive
26:39
[Laughter]
26:39
[Music]
26:42
they also i read a new report about a
26:45
finding about them is that their parents
26:47
teach them not to interrupt them when
26:48
they're talking oh yeah yeah it's a
26:50
thing so basically if you ever hear
26:52
marmosets talking to each other they
26:54
don't interrupt each other they're next
26:55
well actually this is an interesting
26:56
thing
26:58
i was reading a similar thing actually
27:02
yeah they do a thing and they actually
27:03
train their children to not talk over
27:05
them if the child talks over them
27:07
they'll give them the silent treatment
27:09
so every marmoset conversation is really
27:11
civilized
27:12
although they are so they've been
27:14
compared to humans because they are like
27:15
that with conversation they do what
27:17
humans do which is if one of them starts
27:19
talking faster or making its calls a bit
27:21
quicker then the other one will imitate
27:23
as we do in conversation but they don't
27:25
interrupt each other they do leave five
27:27
to six second pauses after one marmoset
27:30
has spoken
27:32
before they speak which i think is not
27:34
as sophisticated as humans where we are
27:36
capable of when i stop talking
27:37
presumably it will not be an awkward six
27:39
second pause before somebody else speaks
27:44
[Laughter]
27:48
no certainly not
27:49
[Laughter]
27:52
all right let's wrap it up with that
27:53

hello
00:13
and welcome to another episode of no
00:16
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:18
this week coming to you live from leeds
00:20
my name is dan schreiber and please
00:21
welcome to the stage it's anna chazinski
00:23
james harkin and andy murray
00:26
[Applause]
00:32
and once again we have gathered around
00:35
the microphones with our four favorite
00:37
facts from the last seven days and in no
00:39
particular order here we go starting
00:41
with fact number one and that is my fact
00:44
my fact this week is that tchaikovsky
00:46
used to hold his head when conducting
00:48
because he was afraid it would fall off
00:51
so this is apparently he was he used to
00:53
get so nervous when he was going on
00:55
stage and there was so much going on in
00:56
his head that he genuinely thought no
00:58
this is definitely going to fly off
00:59
halfway through the game
01:01
so he would sit there or stand there
01:02
rather and have his hand just resting
01:04
yeah i thought that it wasn't true and i
01:06
went on the internet and a few people
01:08
said that they thought it wasn't true
01:09
but then i found one of his best friends
01:11
actually said that he did do this so
01:13
although lest you trust dan too far when
01:16
you first told this to me last week and
01:17
he told me where you'd read it it wasn't
01:19
a book of fiction wasn't it
01:22
it was in a movie called still crazy
01:25
which stars bill nye and billy conley
01:27
and he said that but yeah so so it turns
01:29
out a lot of people do say that it might
01:31
not be true and they only say it because
01:33
tchaikovsky is one of those guys where
01:35
people love to build myths around him
01:37
for some reason and create stories about
01:38
him and that was one possibly but as
01:40
james says we found a source well he was
01:42
a massive star wasn't he he was one of
01:44
those classical musicians in the 19th
01:46
century that was the equivalent of what
01:47
what's a famous band
01:49
justin bieber of his day the justin
01:51
bieber of his day yeah when he went to
01:53
america to perform a few performances in
01:55
new york people used to cut out pictures
01:57
of his face in newspapers and send them
01:59
to him and say please sign this
02:01
um and which is really creepy but
02:03
whatever for a guy who thinks his head's
02:04
going to fall off as well together
02:10
yeah you're right that was harsh it was
02:11
harsh he was a troubled person but i
02:14
think the clues were there so when he
02:16
was first going to america he was
02:17
writing this diary of questions he had
02:19
to ask when he got there to make sure
02:21
that you know he didn't screw up or die
02:23
and uh there were three questions and it
02:25
was is it safe to drink the water fair
02:27
question where can i do my laundry fair
02:30
question what sort of hats do people
02:31
wear
02:33
oh wow but that's interesting because uh
02:36
his death is to do with a glass of water
02:38
isn't it yeah supposedly yeah he
02:40
supposedly died of cholera didn't he
02:42
yeah that's what they think although
02:44
maybe he committed suicide yeah they're
02:46
not sure or it might be that um he so i
02:49
think because he was really paranoid
02:50
about um drink about clean water as
02:52
evidenced by his to-do list when he got
02:53
to america really paranoid about
02:55
cleanness of water his whole life and
02:56
then he suddenly drank a glass of tap
02:58
water in the middle of a cholera
02:59
outbreak so people think maybe he did
03:01
that on purpose there was one other time
03:02
when he supposedly tried to commit
03:04
suicide by walking into the moscow river
03:06
uh and trying to catch pneumonia that
03:09
way yeah that's unusual isn't it evelyn
03:11
war uh tried to kill himself by swimming
03:13
out to sea but then he got stung by a
03:15
jellyfish
03:17
he didn't like that one bit
03:20
so he i think he thought dying's
03:22
probably even worse than this
03:25
so he swam back
03:27
that was before he wrote anything as
03:28
well we wouldn't have any evil
03:31
i started reading something about
03:32
tchaikovsky which is that he always had
03:33
this um kind of slightly uneasy
03:35
relationship with the sound of the
03:36
violin because as a child he had had
03:38
this nightmare that he was being rubbed
03:40
against a block of you know rosen the
03:42
stuff that the
03:44
yeah then i realized this was a humor
03:45
piece from the new yorker
03:48
this was not true but all the other
03:50
stuff about tchaikovsky is so crazy that
03:51
you would think it does kind of sound
03:53
like it could be true doesn't it yeah he
03:55
once went to berlin zoo and saw a boa
03:57
constructor being fed a large rat a
04:00
constructor
04:06
those powers don't make themselves
04:08
[Laughter]
04:10
a constrictor um yes a bow constrictor
04:13
being fed a large rat and he screamed
04:16
ran away started shaking all over and he
04:18
had to be in bed for a week
04:20
yeah pathetic
04:24
so um this thing about his head falling
04:26
off is kind of an example of what they
04:27
call glass delusion isn't it yeah it's a
04:29
really popular delusion for about 300
04:31
years a glass had become like this
04:33
massive material that everyone was using
04:35
and it was just the it was almost a
04:37
standard mental issue of the day that
04:39
people had that they thought they were
04:40
made of glass and they were going to
04:42
shatter if they fell over or whatever
04:44
and then it got replaced by cement
04:45
delusion a bit later really yeah it did
04:48
cement illusion was a real thing but
04:50
when was cement invented well the romans
04:52
made cell then
04:54
they made a kind of cement that we don't
04:55
really know exactly what it was anymore
04:57
but the real kind of proper like time
04:59
that cement was really popular was the
05:00
19th century and that's when cement
05:02
delusion came in and actually it always
05:04
seems to be that people get deluded by
05:06
whatever is the main kind of technology
05:08
of the day so people think that the
05:10
internet's out to get them or or
05:12
whatever and there's one last year was
05:14
the first ever known case of climate
05:16
change delusion and it was where a guy
05:18
wouldn't drink any water because he felt
05:20
guilty about taking it from the earth
05:24
yeah well maybe if we all had that
05:25
attitude we would be in the pickle room
05:29
um king charles vi of france charles the
05:32
mad wasn't it well he was known either
05:34
as charles the mad or charles the
05:36
well-beloved
05:39
which suggests the pr people found out
05:40
about the first thing
05:43
but he thought he thought he was made of
05:45
glass and he would keep pieces of iron
05:47
in his pockets because he thought that
05:48
would protect him if anything bumped
05:50
into him or if he accidentally bumped
05:52
into a doorway when he was going through
05:53
it so he would be defended against it
05:55
yeah do you think it was real um there
05:58
is a thing where your limbs can randomly
06:00
fall off though um and what
06:04
what it's auto amputation which is when
06:06
a limb decides to amputate itself and uh
06:09
the most when a limb decides to amputate
06:11
herself that's a very that's a very down
06:13
sentence and it sounds weird coming from
06:15
animals
06:16
the most common form makes it sound less
06:18
dramatic the most common form is
06:19
dactylosis spontaneous which is when
06:20
your toes spontaneously fall off and
06:22
they don't know why this happens but um
06:24
it's like a ring of tough tissue forms
06:26
around the base of your little toe and
06:28
weirdly when it happens it usually
06:29
happens on both little toes at once and
06:31
it starts squeezing and squeezing your
06:33
little toe
06:34
and eventually your little toe falls off
06:35
and they don't know the cause of it and
06:36
so eventually it's hanging by something
06:38
called a pedicle uh and then it sort of
06:40
just drops off and we don't know what
06:42
happens it's more common in the tropics
06:43
but that's the only clue we have oh my
06:45
god does anyone else have that thing
06:47
where you read about a disease and then
06:48
you automatically get it
06:50
[Laughter]
06:52
i am so sure my little toes are going to
06:54
fall out
06:55
and i found out a thing about sort of uh
06:58
worry and fear so
07:00
the pintupi people of australia who uh
07:03
an aboriginal people in australia
07:04
supposedly they have 15 different words
07:06
for fear and this drops up a lot and
07:08
they're all specific kinds of fears so
07:10
i'm going to pronounce this don't write
07:12
in but
07:14
[Music]
07:17
even i'm right again
07:20
you try saying it
07:23
i think is a sudden fear that leads one
07:25
to stand up to see what caused it
07:35
so you're going to read the other kind
07:37
of 45 that's the only one i've found
07:42
[Laughter]
07:44
um we should move on to our next fact
07:45
soon anyone got anything before we do um
07:48
i've one last thing yeah yeah sure which
07:50
is um it's not really related it's about
07:51
classical music but i found it through
07:53
looking for things about tchaikovsky um
07:55
which is the shock waves from the front
07:57
of trombones move faster than the speed
07:59
of sound
08:00
whoa really i'm going to be the one to
08:03
say it [ __ ]
08:04
[Laughter]
08:06
well i refer you to bbc.co.uk
08:11
um they've measured the they've measured
08:13
it sort of builds up in the tube of the
08:14
trombone and it leaves the front of the
08:16
trombone at about one percent faster
08:17
than the speed of sound these pressure
08:19
waves and so if you're sitting in front
08:20
of the trombones if you're an orchestra
08:22
it can be a nightmare and sometimes
08:24
people have
08:25
i don't think anyone's that close to a
08:26
child that's gonna be a worry at a gig
08:29
if you're in an orchestra oh sorry the
08:31
person
08:32
that's why you meant the audience it's
08:34
like these are great seats
08:39
wait so people where in the orchestra
08:41
wear protective clothes to stop
08:42
themselves getting battered by the shock
08:43
waves
08:44
some musicians who are sitting directly
08:45
in front of the trombonists have
08:47
protective screens between them and the
08:49
trombonists that feel so
08:50
passive-aggressive that emotion if i
08:52
were
08:55
[Laughter]
08:58
all right let's move on okay it is time
09:00
for fact number two and that is james
09:03
harkin okay my fact this week is that
09:05
asthmatic otters can be taught to use
09:08
inhalers
09:09
[Laughter]
09:13
so there is there is an asthmatic arter
09:16
in seattle aquarium he um he seems to
09:18
have contracted asthma after the
09:20
wildfires got near to him when they had
09:22
bad fires in washington state he was
09:24
called mishka um this this um otter and
09:27
they used food to train mishka to kind
09:29
of go up to this little inhaler thing
09:31
and he would press it with his nose and
09:33
then get a little bit of asthma medicine
09:37
yeah it is the most adorable fact about
09:39
it it really is that's so they i quite
09:42
like the whole thing of offering food to
09:44
get them to heal themselves through a
09:45
bit of medication there is another otter
09:47
that i read about called eddie eddie the
09:50
otter
09:50
and eddie had problems with his he
09:53
basically was developing arthritis in
09:55
his elbows and so they needed to get him
09:58
to sort of exercise all the joints
10:00
constantly and so what they did was they
10:02
set up a basketball ring and they had
10:05
they they rewarded him in fish every
10:07
time he got a shot in so they'd give him
10:09
a basketball and i swear to god this is
10:11
what this says eddie was slam dunking
10:15
into the ring
10:17
he was loving it and he's now got a
10:18
contract doesn't he with the mba
10:21
speaking of otters that could be six
10:23
foot tall oh yeah
10:25
there are giant otters in brazil in the
10:28
amazon there are otters that are up to
10:30
six feet long and they're called giant
10:31
otters yeah so there are only five
10:33
thousand left and in captivity they have
10:35
killed people people who fall into their
10:37
cages they're all killed by an otter
10:39
yeah but a huge author they're really
10:41
powerful looking things they're also
10:43
really they can be really vicious though
10:45
although so they can attack outside of
10:47
killing people they can also
10:49
that is the tip of the iceberg
10:52
the altar family the war they're part of
10:54
the weasel family and i was watching a
10:55
david adams the other day and there was
10:56
a weasel that was about three inches
10:58
long and it killed now it doesn't sound
11:00
that impressive it was a rabbit it was
11:02
ten times its size it was the biggest
11:03
rabbit i've ever seen ten times the size
11:05
of it and they wrap themselves around
11:07
the necks of their prey and then they
11:09
just squeeze them and then they bite
11:10
them in the back of the neck and they're
11:11
done and they can take prey ten times
11:13
the size of them wow yeah so they're not
11:14
so cute um so i read a book called otter
11:17
by daniel allen and if you want
11:19
artifacts it is such a good book um
11:22
so otters used to be sacred to the
11:24
zoroastrian people who lived in persia
11:27
so modern day iran there were 18
11:30
possible penalties for killing an otter
11:32
in ancient persia with the zoroastrians
11:34
which included you would have to then go
11:36
and kill 10 000 frogs
11:39
10 000 snakes 10 000 worms 10 000 corpse
11:42
flies whatever they are and whoever did
11:45
it he would also have to carry 10 000
11:46
loads of cleansed wood to a sacred fire
11:49
and he would lose all his wealth his
11:51
property his land and he would have to
11:53
give up his daughter to godly men
11:57
wow yeah in japanese folklore otters can
12:01
shapeshift and so the story is that they
12:03
kind of live in moats around castles and
12:05
they could turn into a beautiful woman
12:07
invite a man over and then eat and kill
12:10
him
12:12
people are waking up being caught next
12:14
to an older guy
12:15
she's a beautiful woman last night
12:18
um and also they can shape-shift and
12:21
fool people into engaging in sumo
12:24
against a rock or a tree stump
12:26
yeah
12:27
when when saint cuthbert uh he was a
12:30
seventh century saint and when he he
12:31
walked into the sea one night to pray
12:34
and when he walked out two otters
12:36
approached him and warmed his feet
12:38
ceremonially by rubbing themselves on
12:40
him and breathing on his feet hot air
12:42
they were probably just trying to dry
12:43
off i imagine and his feet happen to be
12:44
there i'm sure he's interpreted it as an
12:46
affectionate move but when they come out
12:47
of the water they have to rub themselves
12:49
on a lot of stuff and this must be the
12:50
most annoying thing uh coastal otters
12:52
who live in the sea
12:54
every time they are in the sea and then
12:56
they come out of the sea they have to
12:57
then go and have a shower in fresh water
12:59
somewhere because if they keep the salt
13:01
on their fur for any amount of time then
13:03
it ruins the waterproofing of their fur
13:05
so they live in the sea but every time
13:06
they get out of the sea they have to
13:07
find some fresh water immediately and
13:09
wash the salts out from it wow how
13:10
annoying is that yeah do you guys know
13:13
the surface area of an otter
13:16
i mean
13:17
roughly
13:18
would yeah what would you say about one
13:21
square meter
13:22
uh no no including the hairs yeah wait
13:24
dude the surface area
13:26
well yeah yeah if you take it to the
13:28
surface area including the hairs and i
13:30
know that they have 70 000 hairs per
13:32
centimeter squared so a quick bit of
13:34
calculation let's say there are about um
13:37
10 tennis courts
13:40
a million car parks
13:43
what are the size of whales
13:46
about the size of a hockey rink that
13:48
doesn't have
13:49
that's great
13:51
like the size of a shoe or something i
13:53
don't know
13:54
so they they've got they've got more
13:56
hairs on them than any animal in the
13:57
animal kingdom so if you had to go total
13:59
surface area the size of a hockey rink
14:01
which is that's pretty amazing yeah i
14:03
read that they so the sea otters have
14:05
the dancers because they spend their
14:06
whole lives basically in the sea they
14:08
mate and they eat and they sleep and
14:10
they feed they spend almost all the time
14:11
floating on their backs and they have up
14:13
to 165 000 hairs per square centimeter
14:16
that's the densest you get but i think
14:17
that's more than a human has hairs on
14:20
their head one thing that's interesting
14:21
about sea otters is they use tools so
14:23
they can get stones and they can crack
14:25
open shells to get the food inside but
14:27
there are people whose job it is to be
14:29
an otter archaeologist and they want to
14:32
go and find the tools that the otters
14:34
use so they can see kind of how they've
14:36
evolved so a normal archaeologist would
14:38
go and find old human tools but there
14:40
are people looking for old
14:42
otter tools that's cool isn't it that's
14:44
really really cool the problem is that a
14:46
stone like that after they've broken the
14:48
thing they just kind of drop it to the
14:50
bottom of the ocean and it just looks
14:52
like a stone then
14:53
yeah it's not like now they have
14:55
spanners and seed drills and stuff and
14:58
we need to look at where they started
14:59
because we're not going we all have to
15:01
start somewhere yeah so how does a
15:04
single archaeologist able so what they
15:06
do now is because they can't really work
15:09
out which stones are used by otters and
15:10
which aren't they get like
15:13
they just get some stones probably these
15:15
[Laughter]
15:17
no what they do is they get like old
15:19
ancient otter skeletons and they look at
15:22
the teeth and they see whether they've
15:24
used um like that if they had to use
15:26
their teeth to open the shells then
15:27
they'll be cracked and if they didn't
15:29
have to use their teeth then they won't
15:30
be cracked and so you can tell when they
15:32
started using tools wow that's amazing
15:34
they also have they smell and we think
15:37
they smell in quite an incredible way
15:38
because they can't technically smell
15:40
underwater the water stops the um smell
15:42
particles from being able to get to
15:43
their nose so what is thought that they
15:45
do what we've seen them doing is um they
15:47
blow a snot bubble out of their nose
15:49
while they're underwater and then they
15:51
blow it out towards some what they think
15:53
is some prey and then they immediately
15:54
suck it back in again so they get the
15:56
scent of the prey into the air in the
15:57
snot bubble and they suck it back in and
15:59
they can smell it no way that's
16:00
incredible that's apparently what
16:02
they're doing and that's how they smell
16:03
if it's prey they want to eat or if it's
16:04
just a bit of rock that's so cool um we
16:06
should move on to our next fact very
16:08
soon anyone got anything before we do um
16:10
some stuff about asthma very quickly
16:11
yeah yeah sure um so thomas penny who
16:13
was an english entomologist thought that
16:15
if you took crushed wood lice that would
16:18
cure aspara
16:20
something that actually can cure asthma
16:21
is roller coasters or he can't cure it
16:24
but he can relieve the citizens
16:26
it can make you forget about it for
16:27
three minutes
16:29
yeah this is um it's an ignoble um study
16:32
actually and they um check people's kind
16:34
of breeding ability breathing not
16:36
breeding
16:37
not on a roller coaster james
16:39
the bars are done three minutes that's
16:41
about right
16:45
so they checked their breathing ability
16:46
and before and after and just before
16:48
they because of the stress of going on
16:50
the roller coaster it got a bit worse
16:52
but then afterwards somehow the
16:53
pleasurable stress seems to have kind of
16:55
relieved the symptoms of um asthma quite
16:58
a lot really she's quite good good tip
17:01
um just on difficulty breathing uh otter
17:05
mothers teach their kids to swim by
17:07
doing what all of our parents did when
17:09
we learned to swim which is just like
17:10
forcibly ducking them underwater
17:13
in order to make the so baby otters are
17:14
born not being able to swim and that you
17:16
can get watch videos of mothers training
17:18
artists and they drag them from the
17:20
rocks into the water and then they pull
17:22
them along behind them and they let go
17:23
of them like when you're riding a bike
17:25
for the first time and they sort of
17:26
start sinking a bit and so their mother
17:28
has to go up and get them and then to
17:29
get them used to being underwater for
17:30
long periods of time they just like duck
17:32
these baby otters underwater and hold on
17:34
you've had some very difficult
17:35
experiences growing up
17:37
my dad was an otter
17:39
[Laughter]
17:43
okay it is time for fact number three
17:47
and that is chozinski yeah my fact this
17:50
week is that your appendix can be turned
17:52
into a sphincter
17:54
if you like
17:57
no one's forcing you i think you're
17:58
gonna have to explain um yeah so i i
18:00
just think this is incredibly cool what
18:02
uh i guess what medicine and surgery can
18:04
do so appendixes can be really useful
18:07
now it can be repurposed for other
18:09
reasons inside your body so for instance
18:12
if you need bladder replacement surgery
18:13
then the surgeons go in and they take a
18:15
part of your intestine to make a little
18:17
bladder out of it and then they take
18:19
your appendix and they reform it into
18:21
tissue that builds a sphincter muscle
18:23
that can contract and means that you're
18:25
not going to be incontinent which i
18:26
think is incredible you take your
18:28
appendix that's sitting there relatively
18:30
uselessly controversial claim um
18:32
and you turn it into something really
18:34
useful that stops you wetting yourself
18:36
all the time i think that's amazing and
18:37
it happens a lot in surgery you can use
18:39
append appendices for various things you
18:41
can turn them into other things you can
18:43
also turn them into the ureta if you've
18:45
got a problem with your ureter you can
18:47
replace that by reshaping an appendix if
18:49
you are hosting a child's birthday party
18:51
but you've run out of balloons
18:55
an appendix will make a poor but
18:58
acceptable substitute
19:00
uh which you should say that because
19:05
because um the aztecs used um the bowels
19:08
of animals to make balloons oh they blew
19:10
into them i mean
19:12
and then they kind of tied them and i
19:14
they cut i don't think they did shapes
19:16
out of them
19:18
but that is true actually i think that
19:20
is true and i read in one place that
19:22
apparently when they ran out of kind of
19:24
cats or dogs what did they use they use
19:27
humans because they had loads of human
19:29
sacrifices and loads of dead humans and
19:30
they would use the insides of humans to
19:32
make balloons i have right happy
19:34
birthday son here's your grandparents
19:36
organs oh my god
19:40
um so
19:41
you dan have millions of sphincters
19:45
and so does everybody else
19:47
millions are strong yes i should point
19:49
out to the sphincter i'm talking about
19:50
is not the sphincter that you're
19:52
imagining uh go on because we do have a
19:54
lot of thinking yeah so we've all got an
19:56
a-list sphincter as it were but there
19:58
are millions of them throughout your
20:00
body um so you have um sphincters all
20:03
the way through your digestive system
20:04
figure is just a ring of muscle which
20:06
can expand or contract to allow anything
20:08
through it so you also have them in your
20:10
blood vessels um all your veins and
20:12
capillaries have tiny tiny tiny
20:13
sphincters wow widen or constrict
20:16
depending on where needs blood in the
20:18
body is it millions i thought it was
20:20
like 60. well i looked into it a lot i
20:22
haven't got enough they've counted a
20:24
load of ones so they've counted the one
20:26
that goes from your esophagus to the
20:28
stomach or from the stomach to the small
20:30
intestine but they haven't um they
20:31
haven't counted the ones in the blood
20:33
vessels
20:34
some of them are so tiny so i'm not sure
20:36
that there can be a proper audit but wow
20:40
yeah but you've done your best yeah
20:42
so i say it maybe it's thousands i don't
20:44
know so the word sphincter comes from an
20:46
old word sphingine which means to
20:48
squeeze and another word that comes from
20:50
that is sphinx um as in the the big kind
20:53
of animal in
20:55
egypt yeah that's the country um so the
20:57
official plural of the word sphinx is
21:01
oh yeah so that's one for you all to use
21:06
um the sphincters are a blowholes whales
21:08
blowhole sphincters yeah any kind of
21:10
muscle that kind of contracts an
21:11
elephant's trunk your eyes your eyes
21:14
in your pupils the uh muscles which can
21:16
allow your uh pupils to expand or
21:17
contract they're factors and you have
21:18
two in your anus
21:21
inside and out you have an internal one
21:23
which is involuntary and an external one
21:25
which is voluntary
21:26
in most cases
21:31
um also um koalas koala pouches are like
21:34
kangaroo pouches but they're upside down
21:36
which feels like a design floor uh so
21:38
when they're raising their young they're
21:39
in this upside down pouch which if they
21:41
didn't have the sphincter which acts
21:43
kind of like an elastic band or like a
21:44
drawstring to keep the baby in there the
21:46
baby would just drop out of their pouch
21:48
so they clench their sphincter and then
21:51
they've the baby stays in there so uh
21:53
the appendix should we talk about that
21:55
yeah why not yeah um so lots of theories
21:58
we didn't know about it until 1522
22:00
because in the ancient world uh the dr
22:03
galen who was just the the doctor and
22:06
his stuff was the only really anatomical
22:08
stuff we knew about until the 16th
22:10
century he only dissected monkeys and
22:12
monkeys don't have an appendix or a pen
22:14
disease do they not yeah so that's why
22:16
we didn't know it existed yeah although
22:18
what happened when it burst presumably
22:20
people would get appendicitis yeah
22:22
people got it but they just didn't know
22:23
what it was no exactly because
22:25
dissection was really
22:27
a big no-no if you as long as you
22:28
weren't an aztec i suppose
22:31
there's a thing i read today about um
22:33
when australian explorers go to the
22:34
arctic they have to have their appendix
22:37
taken out so
22:38
it turns out that that's not necessarily
22:40
true they do encourage it but there
22:42
there is werner herzog made a
22:43
documentary about the people who live
22:45
out there and the ones who choose to
22:47
stay out when it goes into the real
22:48
inaccessible months and they have to
22:50
make the decision if they're going to
22:52
stay out there the appendix needs to be
22:53
taken out as do wisdom teeth that's
22:56
that's the thing that that's the only
22:57
only way that they can so the guy wasn't
22:59
there who had appendicitis when he was
23:01
in antarctica i think
23:04
i was going to say he's russian yeah
23:06
yeah so this is 1961 and uh it was a
23:08
russian uh trip to the south pole and
23:10
this guy elena drugs i've got
23:12
appendicitis he happened to be a surgeon
23:13
which was useful and he said look i
23:15
think i'm gonna have to take out my own
23:16
appendix and he wrote what i find
23:18
incredible is he's in total agony and
23:20
the night before he did the operation he
23:22
was writing his diary and he wrote it
23:24
hurts like the devil i have to think
23:25
through the only possible way out to
23:27
operate on myself anyway he took his
23:29
appendix out and he had three assistants
23:32
one to hold the lamp one to hold the
23:34
mirror so that he could see inside
23:36
himself and then a third person in case
23:38
one of those two fainted
23:42
i want to be that guy
23:46
he said though
23:47
he so the mirror wasn't actually that
23:49
helpful it turned out so he ended up
23:50
doing it by feeling around oh that's
23:52
right because it was all back to front
23:53
wasn't he had the mirror there but he
23:55
kept going one way but like shaving the
23:57
wrong side of your face or something
23:58
yeah which i think is harder than he
23:59
imagined so he thought it's probably
24:01
easier if i just feel and then he ended
24:02
up tearing a bit of his gut at one point
24:04
and he had to sew that up mid-operation
24:06
and what he said afterwards when he was
24:08
talking when he was interviewed about he
24:09
said i felt so sorry for my surgical
24:11
assistants they stood there in their
24:12
surgical whites whiter than the white
24:14
themselves
24:16
paul then the daz doorstep challenge was
24:19
actually uh
24:22
that day
24:24
oh do you know what um so this is sort
24:26
of this fact was sort of about
24:27
repurposing body parts for different
24:29
things and if you have a tummy tuck um
24:31
they use the fat for breast implants um
24:35
so
24:35
they read this even if you don't ask for
24:38
it
24:40
waste not want not
24:43
okay time for our final fact of the show
24:46
and that is andrew hunter murray my fact
24:49
is that the founder of crufts designed
24:52
special train carriages for celebrity
24:54
dogs
24:57
so in in the 19th century croft's was
25:00
founded in the i think 1891 uh but
25:03
before there were loads of dog shows
25:05
before crafts and um before these train
25:08
carriages were invented what they would
25:10
just do they would put the dogs that
25:11
were going to the dog show in special uh
25:13
boxes which were then strapped to the
25:15
underside of the carriage yeah
25:17
so they would arrive not in good nick
25:19
not really ready
25:20
for a dog show
25:23
um so he designed these special deluxe
25:25
train carriages for dogs and they had a
25:28
row of kennels inside and they had zinc
25:30
flooring and they had uh water troughs
25:32
and they had drainage and they had two
25:34
seats for attendance
25:36
like cabin crew it's zinc flooring the
25:39
height of luxury
25:46
the guy from cross um charles croft he
25:48
was actually was he kind of a showman or
25:50
a dog biscuit manufacturer he was a dog
25:53
biscuit manufacturer in london there was
25:55
a very famous building i think it was
25:57
the first ever dog biscuit factory ever
25:59
and it was called sprats and that's
26:01
where charles croft worked he started
26:04
there and he was working on the biscuits
26:05
and he was so good he had ideas about
26:06
marketing and he turned it into the
26:08
first sort of major brand of biscuits
26:10
they put logos on it and so on so people
26:12
knew about it yeah exactly um there's a
26:14
rumor that charles croft never owned a
26:15
dog in his life yeah
26:18
he sort of put it about during his life
26:19
that he never owned a dog and his wife's
26:21
yeah because we couldn't show favoritism
26:23
for one breed or another and then in his
26:25
posthumous memoirs it turned out he had
26:27
us some burners yeah he had a massive
26:28
saint bernard didn't he yeah
26:30
that sounds very rude
26:35
quite hard to hide that the dog
26:38
i'm surprised you kept it secret so
26:40
that's really true
26:42
so craft was a genius at making money
26:45
basically and putting on these big shows
26:46
and putting on even bigger shows and
26:47
just really exploiting his audience in
26:50
his market so i read that this was what
26:52
he did in the early days of crafts i'm
26:54
quoting here he introduced a system
26:56
where competitors would pay to enter
26:58
their dogs and make additional payments
27:00
if they wish to take the dogs away each
27:02
night of the competition
27:04
and then pay again if they wanted to
27:06
take them away early on the final day
27:08
wow so basically it's not free to enter
27:11
or leave
27:15
god did many people run out of money and
27:16
just have to leave their dog there
27:17
forever
27:19
is there a huge lost property office of
27:21
dead dogs that are
27:22
75 years old
27:26
i just think that's an inspired system
27:29
it also applies here tonight guys so
27:34
croft also found charles craft the guy
27:36
who founded it also founded a cat show
27:38
did you know that yeah but uh quoting
27:41
from i think his oxford uh dictionary of
27:43
national biography entry it failed to
27:44
live up to commercial expectations yeah
27:47
it doesn't feel like cats would like to
27:48
be shown
27:50
oh i read i read a thing about cat shows
27:52
and there was a lady who was giving
27:53
advice for this there is a catcher
27:55
called the supreme cat show which is
27:56
such a good name and uh she enters cats
27:59
for it all the time and she said the
28:01
main grooming things are brushing the
28:03
coat through with the comb making sure
28:05
the underarms and the bikini area
28:07
[Laughter]
28:11
oh my god
28:13
i'm washing the cat's face
28:17
it's pretty it's pretty weird yeah um um
28:20
do you know so the prizes and crafts are
28:22
really small as well the price do you
28:23
know the maximum price cash prize that
28:24
you get
28:25
uh no that's a hundred pounds so it's
28:27
really it's a token thing yeah you also
28:29
get a big silver cup but you're not
28:30
allowed to melt it or anything but a lot
28:32
a lot of a lot of royalty have won
28:34
surroundings haven't they a lot of
28:35
royalties do they come in disguise
28:38
victoria entered as a shih tzu
28:41
and won many years running because
28:43
everyone was too afraid to say
28:44
that's the queen
28:48
um yeah and so you can make money from
28:50
um endorsements and from um
28:52
you know pimping the dog out for stud or
28:54
whatever i don't know what it's called
28:56
but they they have sex with other dogs
28:57
and then you get better dogs um but
29:01
do you know what the prize was in the
29:02
first modern dog show which was in 1859
29:05
in newcastle
29:06
uh no the prizes were all
29:11
it was it was a guns
29:12
rural farming based competition it was
29:14
there was a cattle show and they said
29:16
why don't we add a dog element to this
29:17
cattle show and so the prices are all
29:19
guns um i do you know if you get a train
29:22
in the uk that you don't have to pay for
29:25
your first two dogs to come on but your
29:27
third one you do yeah so you get two
29:29
dogs free and then
29:30
your third one you gotta start paying
29:32
really yeah and every additional dog you
29:34
bring on
29:34
yeah but i read also that if any other
29:37
customer objects to its presence on the
29:39
train you are obliged to move it to
29:41
another area according to bylaws 16 of
29:44
the uh oh yeah try saying that when the
29:45
pitbulls got its teeth
29:48
i object to this according to bile 16.
29:51
and i just have a cool train if you want
29:54
to hear it
29:55
i have a cool train
29:57
what are you sick
30:00
so
30:02
the shine and zeppelin in 1931 was a
30:05
german train and they wanted to make a
30:06
super fast train and what they wanted to
30:08
do was put a huge propeller on the back
30:10
of the train and it would go super super
30:12
fast down the tracks it's a brilliant
30:14
idea but it never went past the
30:16
prototype stage because they found out
30:18
that the propellers would kill people
30:20
who stood too close to the tracks
30:22
stations
30:24
oh my god
30:26
i've read there's a new idea of most
30:28
complaints that come about uh the way
30:30
that trains function one complaint is
30:32
the fact that too much time is lost when
30:34
they're trying to stop when they stop at
30:37
a station and people are getting on and
30:38
off the other one is about internet
30:39
access so one of the plans for a new
30:41
train that they've been designing is to
30:43
design a train that never stops but
30:45
still picks up passengers oh yeah yeah
30:48
it's incredible so it just goes high
30:50
speed it's just high speeding along and
30:51
then what they do is everyone boards
30:53
another train and the other train chases
30:56
the train that's going to the place
30:58
docks onto it everyone casually walks
31:01
over docks off it and goes back to the
31:04
uh to the station that's one proposed
31:06
idea for a new train yeah it sounds
31:07
about as sensible as james's massive
31:09
slicey fan
31:12
okay that's it that is all of our facts
31:15

00:28
[Applause]
00:34
and uh once again we have gathered
00:36
around the microphones with our four
00:38
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:39
and in no particular order here we go
00:42
starting with my fact my fact this week
00:44
is that when something thought to be a
00:46
meteorite actually turns out to be an
00:48
ordinary rock it's called a meteor wrong
00:53
how cool is that
00:55
so we we were sent that fact in by uh
00:57
someone called molly christie uh she
00:59
listens to the show she sent it in i was
01:01
looking into it it's not obviously a
01:03
official scientific terminology but if
01:07
you look into i've read amas on reddit
01:09
with meteorite experts they all call it
01:10
the meteorite yeah it is quite a common
01:12
thing i went to the natural history
01:14
museum a few years ago and there's a
01:16
kind of a department there that if you
01:17
have any weird stuff that you find in
01:19
your garden or whatever and you're not
01:20
sure what it is you can send it to them
01:22
they do call them meteors and they think
01:23
that actually
01:25
when people think they find meteorites
01:26
it's almost always a meteor wrong it's
01:28
very rare that you actually do find a
01:30
real one so the natural history museum
01:32
has a room of meteorologists which are
01:33
basically just rocks yeah pretty much
01:36
yeah
01:39
uh yeah there was a guy um uh who was
01:41
saying that so he's at a university of
01:44
minnesota in america and he's called
01:46
calvin alexander his university
01:47
professor and he's been asking people
01:49
for i think 30 years to come to him if
01:52
they found a meteorite they think they
01:53
found a meteorite and he says he's seen
01:56
thousands more than 5 000 meteor wrongs
01:59
he's retiring next year never yet has
02:01
someone brought him something that's
02:02
turned out to be a meeting
02:04
until
02:05
this year
02:07
a couple families had a thing in their
02:08
garden that they'd actually found a
02:09
couple of years ago and they said
02:10
actually this looks a bit weird brought
02:12
it in there you go it was his first ever
02:13
meteorite yeah before his retirement
02:15
that's really cool we should say what a
02:17
meteorite is because i wasn't sure so a
02:20
meteoroid is a chunk of rock flying
02:22
through space and then if it enters the
02:24
earth's atmosphere it's a meteor but
02:25
then if a bit lands then that becomes a
02:27
meteorite
02:29
yeah so it can be three different things
02:30
depending on where it is yeah and we get
02:32
about uh 44 tons of meteorites falling
02:34
on the planet every day so you'd think
02:36
there would be more we do there's a
02:37
ridiculous number i think it's four
02:39
billion a year land on earth they're
02:41
mostly i think really really small but
02:44
it's a lot do you know how you can tell
02:46
if you're out in the in the wild looking
02:48
at rocks trying to find meteorites if it
02:50
is one um no
02:54
so they're magnetic okay yeah so if you
02:57
have a little magnet with you a little
02:58
fridge magnet or something if if there's
03:00
a magnetic pull against it that doesn't
03:02
it still might just be a lot it could be
03:04
like a radiator or something there's
03:06
lots of things yeah
03:08
but that's the thing there's a lot of
03:09
there are a lot of um rocks that are
03:11
just normal terrestrial rocks that are
03:13
also magnetic so don't just go around
03:15
with them you know you're a magnet
03:17
trying to find one
03:18
so it was because i got really excited
03:19
when they said yeah if it's if it's
03:21
magnetic then it's definitely a
03:22
meteorite except for the fact that a lot
03:23
of rocks are magnetic so it may just
03:25
turn out to be a rock however if it's
03:26
not magnetic it could be a rock from
03:28
mars or from the moon which is even
03:30
rarer however it could also just be a
03:32
rock
03:34
it doesn't sound like they've cracked
03:36
the perfect method i once wrote to a
03:38
meteorite expert a few years ago and
03:39
asked him what you should do if one
03:41
lands because there's a common
03:43
misconception the meteorites are hot
03:44
when they land but they're not because
03:46
they've just gone through space which is
03:47
really cold and then they have gone
03:49
through the atmosphere so warmed up a
03:50
bit but they should have had plenty of
03:51
time to cool down so you could actually
03:54
conceivably get a frostbite from
03:55
touching a meteorite
03:58
on the inside but when i wrote to this
03:59
guy and said what should you actually do
04:01
he said whatever you do don't touch it
04:02
you want to get kind of a plastic bag
04:04
and then put it down because just you
04:06
touching it could contaminate it and
04:07
mean that it's not very good for science
04:10
don't touch those meteorites i met a an
04:12
explorer over skype called charles
04:15
brewer carius amazing character quite
04:18
controversial character the explorer up
04:20
was said to be based on him you know the
04:22
in the pixar movie up the guy living in
04:24
the venezuelan mountains said to be
04:26
based on him he's famous for a number of
04:27
things a lot of discoveries including he
04:29
told me that he discovered what he
04:32
thinks is the lost city of gold and he
04:34
did it while he was having a poo in the
04:35
woods and he said he said to me i looked
04:37
in between my legs and saw something
04:39
spectacular
04:46
but he also told me that he's discovered
04:48
this glowing coral glowing coral which
04:50
is the oldest life form on this planet
04:53
okay and he said that it arrived via uh
04:55
space meteorites and so it's now living
04:58
on earth an extraterrestrial is this uh
05:00
how trustworthy is this guy is he
05:02
friends with your yeti hunting friends
05:04
and your ghost seeking friends i don't
05:05
know he said he said he was like a
05:07
biologist came in and said that this is
05:09
definitely the oldest form of life and
05:10
actually it feels like it's from out of
05:12
space and then i emailed the biologist
05:14
and she said there's about as much exo
05:16
biology in it as there is in my foot so
05:19
he must have heard it wrong kind of
05:20
thing but
05:21
potentially in the hills of venezuela
05:24
that she had an amazing foot full of
05:26
aliens
05:29
do you know the cambodian thing you
05:31
shout when a meteorite arrives is star
05:33
poo is what you say
05:35
ah
05:36
that's what happened when one landed in
05:37
cambodia in 2014. is that what they call
05:40
them well loads of the people shouted um
05:42
the local khmer people shouted star poo
05:44
so i don't know if it's an official
05:45
scientific name
05:48
yeah wow
05:49
there was a the rnli
05:51
launched a really big search and rescue
05:53
operation last year i think because of a
05:55
uh meteor flying through the sky and
05:57
they thought it was a distress flow
05:59
being sent out by a ship there was an
06:00
emergency operation this is off the
06:02
cumbrian coast i think
06:04
and i think you know it takes quite a
06:05
lot of money and they went out there and
06:07
then gradually reports started coming
06:08
through from the rest of the country
06:09
saying there's this flare going across
06:10
the sky everywhere and it turned out yep
06:13
no one's dying which is actually good
06:15
news
06:17
in a way
06:18
yeah um in the late 18th century in
06:21
france they didn't think that um the
06:23
academy francaise didn't think that
06:25
meteorites could possibly exist
06:26
supposedly what they said was there are
06:28
no rocks in the sky therefore rocks
06:31
cannot fall from the sky uh and they
06:33
logic is actually infallible
06:36
yeah it's true but that's apparently
06:37
what they said and um apparently they it
06:39
meant that they didn't do any kind of
06:41
studies on possible meteorites because
06:43
if someone said they found one and saw
06:45
one land they were like well
06:46
duh obviously not real um but then in
06:50
1803 more than 2 000 meteorites fell in
06:53
a single village in normandy
06:55
so they had to kind of change their mind
06:57
a little bit wow wow yeah apparently
06:59
that's a story i don't know if it's true
07:01
it's very cool
07:02
there was um a meteorite fell through
07:04
the roof of a
07:06
uh house owned by the comet family
07:08
recently i think i think it was two
07:10
years ago
07:12
that's nice isn't it
07:14
i think they're french you didn't read
07:15
anything more on that story didn't you
07:17
why would i
07:19
it's only going to get worse from there
07:22
we need to move on quite soon to our
07:23
next fact
07:25
can i do it just a quick thing a new
07:26
story that i read a bosnian man
07:29
had his house hit five times by
07:31
meteorites in less than six months a few
07:33
years ago
07:35
experts at the local university were
07:37
like well maybe there's like a magnetic
07:38
anomaly or something like that but he
07:40
thought that he said i am obviously
07:43
being targeted by extraterrestrials
07:47
i don't know what i have done to annoy
07:49
them but there is no other explanation
07:50
that makes sense
07:52
the chance of being hit by a meteorite
07:54
is so small that getting hit five times
07:56
has to be deliberate
08:01
um okay let's move on to our second fact
08:03
of the show and that is andy murray
08:06
my fact this week is that brown falcons
08:09
commit arson
08:11
okay
08:12
so these are australian birds uh they're
08:14
kind of falcon and there are two species
08:16
brown falcons and black kites and
08:18
they've been observed picking up when
08:20
there are wildfires they've been
08:21
observed picking up smoldering bits of
08:23
branch and twig and carrying them to new
08:25
locations and starting fires in new
08:27
areas which then makes all the little
08:29
creatures in the undergrowth run out so
08:31
that they can uh kill them and eat them
08:33
so this is deliberate fire starting
08:36
as a way of getting food and it's all so
08:39
far it's uh not been observed it's not
08:41
been filmed and it's uh anecdotal
08:43
evidence from park rangers uh aboriginal
08:45
australians and australian firemen so
08:48
yeah so it could be made up couldn't it
08:50
i don't think it's made up but i think
08:52
it needs to be observed properly okay it
08:54
seems likely though it does make sense
08:56
because they rely on on fires for their
08:58
food very often don't they those types
08:59
of birds so it makes sense yeah it
09:01
reminds me of a thing we we did a radio
09:03
show with a guy called rupert sheldrake
09:04
a few years ago and he said that um
09:07
people anecdotally have said that when
09:10
sheep want to get across a cattle grid
09:12
they kind of roll over on the cattle
09:14
grid to get from one side to the other
09:16
and he said loads of people have seen
09:17
this happening yeah um but actually we
09:20
think probably it never happened yeah it
09:22
might be just a story um what they
09:23
noticed was someone started reporting it
09:25
in one bit of australia and then a few
09:27
days later sheep across the country
09:29
started doing it as if there was some
09:30
kind of secret sheep whispering like
09:33
network that managed to spread but it's
09:35
yeah so it sounds like it's in the shell
09:36
drake area slightly i guess yeah these
09:39
people who have been talking about it
09:41
are you know like you say the park
09:43
rangers and you know people who kind of
09:45
would know that kind of thing so it
09:46
would be very very good to know if it um
09:48
if it does happen and
09:50
so there's more research being done
09:52
basically and more observation being
09:54
done the one of the co-authors of it
09:55
mark bonter has suggested that humans
09:58
might have learned about spreading fires
09:59
from birds
10:01
which
10:02
seems less likely
10:04
um
10:05
but apparently yeah because they they
10:06
can carry they have to carry them quite
10:08
small distances while they're still
10:09
smoldering obviously because if you fly
10:10
you know far then it'll go out yeah i
10:13
mean if we learnt about carrying a fight
10:14
from birds we overtook them so fast
10:18
they're still there occasionally picking
10:20
up a burning ember we've got bonfire
10:22
night
10:23
[Music]
10:24
does happen that so in 2014 a pigeon in
10:27
stockwell did start a fire by dropping a
10:29
cigarette in its nest so
10:35
i've read about a um this new
10:37
kickstarter that's been fully funded
10:38
where you can now um if you're out in
10:40
the in camping or whatever it's this
10:43
little kit where you light a fire and it
10:45
heats up this pad that creates a battery
10:47
charge for your iphone so you've got an
10:49
external iphone charger now or
10:51
smartphone charger which plugs in to a
10:53
fire source
10:55
yeah isn't that really cool that is very
10:57
cool yeah speaking of humans making fire
11:00
actually some humans still uh can't make
11:02
fire uh or until the 20th century they
11:05
there are tribes that had still hadn't
11:07
learned how to make fire so there are um
11:09
the for instance fa and booty uh pygmies
11:13
that i think pygmy tribes that are in
11:15
the democratic republic of the congo
11:16
they we think they could make fire
11:19
thousands of years ago there's some
11:20
evidence for that but it seems like they
11:22
forgot and now um it's part of tribal
11:24
tradition that you have to carry around
11:25
a burning ember with you all the time so
11:28
you get fire from like if there's a
11:29
lightning storm in the forest then a
11:32
tree sets on fire and you pick up that
11:34
and it's the women's job in these tribes
11:35
to carry around this burning ember and
11:37
they have to wrap it up in a damp leaves
11:39
when they move from one campsite to the
11:41
next so that they keep this fire because
11:43
if the fire goes out it's like we've got
11:45
no fire just waiting for the next
11:46
thunder waiting for the next storm yeah
11:48
isn't that weird yeah yeah
11:51
and then i think some anthropologists
11:52
turned up about 20 years ago and said
11:54
guys i was reading about some of the
11:56
unusual birds cool birds oh yeah um so
11:59
baby gray cat birds
12:01
they get their name because they make a
12:03
noise like a cat they kind of do a
12:05
little meow which sounds great but it's
12:07
not really great for them because it
12:09
just attracts cats
12:14
that is a massive evolutionary design
12:17
in 2011 they did a study and they found
12:20
that domestic cats were responsible for
12:22
nearly half of all deaths of these birds
12:24
oh my god
12:26
um here's another one um i there's a
12:28
hummingbird called anna's hummingbird oh
12:30
yeah yeah he's at home now yeah didn't
12:33
want to come tonight alice hummingbird
12:35
can shake their bodies 55 times per
12:37
second
12:38
which is the fastest shake of any
12:40
vertebrate known just back to the sounds
12:42
i was reading about a bird that's called
12:44
the fort tale drongo and this bird has
12:47
the ability to mimic other animals and
12:50
other birds and what it does is it lets
12:52
out it's learned the coal of there's
12:54
danger nearby so if it feels like it's
12:57
so basically it's so that they can steal
12:59
food off other animals so they'll be
13:01
like danger's coming and then they'll
13:03
say it like a cat or like a i don't know
13:05
like a hamster or something and then
13:06
like a human could they say danger's
13:08
coming i think they've mastered humans
13:10
yeah and so they so these things run off
13:13
and then they get the food but they've
13:15
learned to both lie and not lie when
13:18
there is actual danger so they so
13:19
they've kept animals on their toes when
13:21
they hear it and go oh it's probably
13:22
that bird they they can
13:24
actually then get eaten because it
13:26
wasn't telling us yeah it's cry wolf yes
13:30
but sometimes there is a wolf yeah
13:32
you obviously never read to the end of
13:33
the story of crime
13:36
i got the gist of it
13:38
the same thing just kept happening i'm
13:40
like this is boring now oh god
13:43
cookies
13:44
so i was looking at a bird committing
13:46
crimes these birds commit arson cuckoos
13:48
obviously very famous criminal birds um
13:50
you know uh put drop put their eggs in
13:52
other birds nests and disguise them as
13:53
other birds eggs and then the egg
13:55
hatches and it tips all the real eggs
13:57
out of the nest and that's that so
13:59
they're murderers and kind of house
14:00
thieves um but other players are getting
14:03
really wise to it so they've cuckoos
14:05
have evolved to make their eggs
14:08
mimic the eggs of whatever bird whose
14:09
nest they want to steal so the eggs look
14:11
identical
14:12
to our human eyes to the bird whose nest
14:15
they want to steals eggs but birds other
14:18
birds have now developed uh evolved
14:20
really super sensitive infrared type
14:22
vision so they can see really subtle
14:24
differences in cuckoo's eggs that
14:26
completely distinguish them from their
14:27
own eggs so they're getting the better
14:29
of them gradually that's very good it's
14:31
nice isn't it but then the cuckoos will
14:33
probably evolve again to beat that and
14:36
it's actually yeah why can't they evolve
14:38
to build their own nests one day
14:41
actually i think of all the cuckoo
14:43
species i think most of them don't do
14:45
that parasitic thing yeah the ones in
14:47
europe do but around the world i think
14:49
most of them don't yeah that's true
14:51
um
14:52
last month an israeli vulture was
14:54
arrested in lebanon for spying
14:57
so it happened no
14:59
is it was it charged it no i don't think
15:02
so i think it was eventually released so
15:04
what kind of interrogation happened
15:07
no you didn't do it did you
15:10
had a location transmitter and an
15:12
israeli identification tag on it so i
15:15
suppose the thinking was that israeli
15:17
spies would have written this is a spy
15:19
on a bird
15:21
um yeah
15:22
in 1471 a chicken in basel was found
15:25
guilty of laying a brightly colored egg
15:27
[Music]
15:29
which was thought to be in defiance of
15:31
natural law
15:32
what was the penalty unfortunately it
15:34
wasn't let free like the israeli one um
15:36
it was burned to death at the
15:39
i mean that's a delicious delicious
15:42
steak
15:44
and so nando's was born
15:49
uh i found a bird that i'd never heard
15:51
of before it's a tibetan blackbird this
15:52
is its name turdus maximus
15:55
he's an actual bird all corporate birds
15:57
are the turdus uh jennas aren't they uh
16:02
so they turdus turdus i think their toad
16:03
has told us so corbin's are crows and um
16:07
the best they're crows ravens uh magpies
16:10
uh all birds like that and they're so
16:11
intelligent so they so this fact is kind
16:13
of about birds of prey learning how to
16:15
use tools in a way and um corvids are
16:18
amazing at using tools so there was one
16:20
experiment where a crow was it managed
16:23
to it was given a piece of wire and it
16:25
managed to bend this piece of wire into
16:27
a hook using a glass kind of beaker that
16:30
was nearby so it like pushed the glass
16:32
speaker against a wall so that it bent
16:33
this bit of wire into a hook in order
16:35
that it could hook a stick that was
16:37
slightly out of its reach and it hooked
16:39
the stick towards it and then it took
16:40
the long stick with which it was able to
16:42
get the food that it wanted to get wow
16:44
that's impressive isn't it that's really
16:45
i don't know why i can just fly over and
16:47
pick up the food but yeah it was
16:48
challenging itself
16:51
um we're gonna have to move on really
16:53
shortly so anything else before we do uh
16:55
koalas to escape forest fires um their
16:57
instinctive reaction is to crawl up a
16:59
tree
17:01
they often have to get rescued by
17:03
australian firefighters they're very
17:05
badly evolved yeah
17:07
they presumably move really slowly so
17:09
that's their best bet i'm guessing like
17:11
i would never picture like a herd of
17:13
koala coming out
17:14
because the fire was approaching them
17:16
yeah
17:17
all right let's move on to our third
17:19
fact of the evening and that is
17:21
chezinski yeah my fact is that in 1461
17:25
the mayor of haiyan in spain donated 10
17:28
000 eggs to his citizens so they could
17:30
have a huge food fight
17:33
very kind nice of him he's a good guy
17:34
this is a guy called uh constable don
17:37
miguel lucas de oranzo and he decided
17:40
for easter easter celebration give his
17:42
people this big food fight and he built
17:44
this huge fake wooden castle that he
17:47
wheeled into the city center and i think
17:49
he then hold himself up in his house
17:50
with some of his guards and he was like
17:52
to the townspeople said you get in this
17:54
castle and that's pelt each other with
17:55
eggs for a while and they did it
17:58
and then they did it again on may mayday
17:59
because they enjoyed it so much
18:01
and for a few subsequent years it does
18:02
kind of feel like a thing that should
18:04
have carried on forever doesn't it
18:05
because it does sound like the most fun
18:07
thing ever what must have happened to
18:08
stop it
18:09
i feel like he because it always seems
18:11
to be him throughout the 1460s so maybe
18:13
when he left office he sounds like maybe
18:15
the boris johnson of the 15th century
18:17
he probably had some dodgy policies but
18:19
did a lot of fun stuff on the side but
18:21
won the people around i read that in one
18:23
of the other fights that he had that
18:25
there was such a surplus of food that
18:26
people then started hitting each other
18:27
with chickens
18:30
no yeah
18:31
how do you hit someone with a chicken
18:33
it's just an older egg isn't it
18:37
waiter i think this egg is off
18:38
[Laughter]
18:40
sir you're coming to nando's every day
18:45
there were boiled eggs i think which
18:47
sounds a bit less
18:48
yeah
18:49
i've read nick i've read mixed with
18:51
there's a lot of controversy over the
18:52
top of it oh really um i think yeah some
18:54
sources say boiled some say just raw but
18:56
it's so hard to tell from the outside
18:57
isn't it yeah
19:00
actually there is a game called um egg
19:02
roulette which so i think this is part
19:05
of the
19:06
the lincolnshire world egg throwing
19:08
championships which are a massive deal
19:09
we probably all tried to get tickets at
19:11
some point and um they have stuff like
19:13
the world egg trebuchet and um egg
19:16
throwing obviously and then one of the
19:18
contests is egg roulette which involves
19:20
you sit at a table with one other person
19:22
and you've got a whole bunch of eggs
19:23
laid out in front of you and they're all
19:25
boiled except one and you take it in
19:26
turns to select one and smash it against
19:28
your forehead and then you get covered
19:30
in raw egg when you pick the wrong one
19:32
it's not as dangerous as russian
19:33
roulette but but you're still covered in
19:35
but you still have a sort of boiled egg
19:39
and it's not great it's not a good
19:40
result
19:43
and the egg throw in itself it's quite
19:44
good it's what happens is you're um 10
19:47
meters away from your friend you chuck
19:48
in the egg and
19:50
or she and they have to catch it uh and
19:52
not break it and then everyone does that
19:54
and everyone who does it right and it
19:56
doesn't break then they go to 20 meters
19:58
and then 30 meters and then 40 meters so
20:00
it's quite a cool game that is now i
20:01
reckon you should have a girl later on
20:02
are the rules that you have to throw it
20:04
fairly towards them because you could
20:06
throw it off a bit and then they'd be
20:09
they'd find a very different you're in a
20:10
team yeah you actually catch it
20:12
this is why your team keeps losing
20:15
i'm gonna get that guy this time
20:18
are you allowed to use an apron to catch
20:19
it an apron no i think with your hands
20:22
it has to be and they also have very
20:23
strict drug rules as well according to
20:25
their website
20:27
no they say that like any sport you're
20:29
not allowed any performance enhancing
20:30
drugs but they do say
20:33
they do say that the local happy jack
20:36
real ale is not only permitted but
20:38
recommended
20:38
[Laughter]
20:41
um i was reading about uh being egged
20:44
the phenomenon of being egged
20:46
okay being egged um
20:48
fun thing to say um there was a 2006
20:50
study which was called here's egg in
20:52
your eye a prospective study of blunt
20:54
ocular trauma resulting from thrown eggs
20:58
this was a real study
20:59
and it just concluded don't do it um
21:02
i mean have people been ocularly
21:04
traumatized frequently yes really not
21:06
frequently no but it does it does happen
21:09
very seldom
21:11
yanukovych she remember the uh president
21:13
of the
21:14
uh got struck with a brick was rushed to
21:18
hospital because he'd been struck with a
21:19
brick and it transpired when people
21:21
looked back i think they looked back
21:22
over the footage and it had just been an
21:23
egg so
21:25
it is apparently more dangerous and
21:27
hard-hitting than they look yeah wow so
21:30
he didn't look at the debris around him
21:31
he just assumed it was a brick i think i
21:34
guess maybe he had serious ocular damage
21:36
and could no longer oh yeah yes sir yeah
21:37
his surroundings you know grease you
21:38
don't get eggs you get yogurted
21:42
yay or
21:44
don't write in
21:45
um yeah yeah like yogurt yeah
21:48
um and it's a specific kind of yogurt
21:51
that they use which is sheep's milk
21:52
yogurt that's really good for yayo
21:54
turmeric people because you're sort of
21:57
reminding people that they're greek and
21:59
that they've shamed greekness
22:02
your greek yogurt greek yogurt so when
22:04
you say it's a special kind do you go
22:05
into a shop and say do you have any
22:06
yogurt and they say is this for eating
22:08
or assaulting a politician
22:17
oh there was quite a vicious food fight
22:19
in 1818 in harvard apparently this was
22:22
an era of quite a lot of student
22:24
protests in america i think and um yeah
22:27
this food fight started when someone
22:28
threw a slice of buttered bread and it
22:30
ended up going mad for days and like all
22:32
the crocker all harbors crockery were
22:34
smashed lots of plates and chairs were
22:36
thrown at each other lots of furniture
22:37
broken um there was uh a lot of students
22:41
were suspended unsurprisingly and then
22:43
all the other students who hadn't been
22:44
suspended went and protested one of them
22:46
was emerson ralph waldo emerson was
22:47
there at the time and he protested and
22:49
went stood under a tree and they sort of
22:51
mobbed all the tutors and said how dare
22:52
you suspend students for breaking all
22:54
the furniture in this place and smashing
22:57
all the crockery and yeah apparently
22:59
this is quite a common occurrence so
23:00
they let them all back in because
23:02
they were upset wow all right hey let's
23:04
move on to our final fact of the show
23:07
and that is james harkin okay my fact
23:09
this week is that in 1951 australia's
23:12
football team played against england and
23:14
lost 17 nil
23:16
the goalkeeper was called norman
23:18
conquest
23:23
what a great name norman conquest i love
23:25
it he's and he is quite a famous
23:27
goalkeeper he's in the australian hall
23:29
of fame but he's most famous for being
23:31
in this one game where they got
23:32
absolutely annihilated by england what
23:34
happened in the game was just well 17 no
23:36
but how did he there was a report
23:38
written by a guy called tugger bryant he
23:41
was another former footballer and he
23:43
said that australia could not handle the
23:45
mud it was a really really muddy pitch
23:48
australia could not handle the mud
23:49
whereas england reveled in it and rang
23:51
rings around the australians um our
23:54
players spent more time on their backs
23:56
in the mud than on their feet
23:58
the only time they were on their feet
23:59
was when the band played god save the
24:01
queen
24:04
so yeah the english team could um kind
24:06
of deal with their heavy conditions but
24:08
the australians just weren't used to it
24:10
um i looked up more uh excellent
24:12
footballer names
24:14
history so um reading in the 70s had a
24:17
goalkeeper called steve death
24:20
and just outside the goalie arena
24:22
there's a zimbabwean defender i'm sure
24:24
you'll have heard of him james called
24:25
danger fourpence
24:26
which is a dream
24:28
there's gun in chap called naughty
24:29
naughty
24:34
there's a brazilian striker called
24:35
credence clearwater kutto because his
24:37
parents were such fans of credence's
24:39
clearwater revival yeah he's my famous
24:41
these cars everyone calls him paulista i
24:43
think do they yeah okay but australia i
24:46
am now obviously quite a decent team are
24:48
they such a good team now because dad's
24:50
from australia
24:51
was brought up in australia
24:53
um so
24:54
you're a fan of the socceroos yeah yeah
24:56
and we watched the games in the last
24:57
world cup in the qa office when they
24:59
lost 17 nil it was a record defeat i
25:01
think of any team in an international
25:02
game but now australia holds the record
25:05
win
25:06
when they beat american samoa 31 nil in
25:09
2001
25:10
but what happened there was the american
25:12
samoa team all had passport issues and
25:15
so all but one of the players were
25:17
ineligible to play because they couldn't
25:19
get out of the country oh my god
25:21
they couldn't call up any of their under
25:23
20 team because they were all doing
25:25
exams at the time
25:27
and so they had to just draft in all
25:29
these really really young or
25:31
inexperienced players including three 15
25:33
year olds
25:35
and at the end of the game the um
25:36
stadium showed that the score was 32 nil
25:39
because everyone had lost count
25:41
my god
25:43
there's always a little caveat for any
25:45
international glory for australian sport
25:47
it's so annoying
25:48
do you remember the olympics it was that
25:50
speed racer guy on um
25:52
so so he's a speed skater right yeah
25:55
speed skater and he uh was coming last
25:58
in the heats uh and or i think it was uh
26:00
he'd made it through the heats and he
26:01
was in the semis and uh as they came
26:03
around the corner on the last bit he was
26:05
way in behind someone tripped in front
26:07
took out everyone he was so far back
26:09
that he could dodge right around
26:11
came first made it to the finals so
26:13
everyone was going there was no way this
26:15
guy should ever be here but here he is
26:16
now finals gets around to the same
26:18
corner he's way behind same thing
26:20
happens everyone falls down yeah he took
26:23
over and just waltzed in
26:25
to gold
26:26
first
26:27
that we've got and he got it because
26:30
both times and he now goes around the
26:31
country of australia doing motivational
26:33
talks
26:35
to school kids and stuff and his talks
26:37
are basically oh you never know someone
26:39
might up
26:42
he's always like the tenth person they
26:43
ask but the other nine get hit by others
26:48
yeah
26:48
i was reading a bit about goalkeeping
26:50
tactics over the years okay because this
26:52
is about a goalkeeper yeah um
26:55
so um
26:56
john burridge was a goalkeeper and he
26:58
kept his reflexes nice and sharp between
27:00
the 60s and the 90s was his career by
27:03
asking his wife to throw fruit at him
27:04
when he wasn't looking
27:10
that's amazing there was a guy called
27:12
harry renee who was a scottish goalie
27:13
and uh in the 1890s his training regime
27:15
was to throw himself onto wooden boards
27:17
for half an hour every day
27:20
just to toughen himself up yeah because
27:21
he'd have to be throwing himself on the
27:22
floor exactly yeah yeah
27:24
okay
27:25
half an hour so the first mention of
27:27
football that i could find at least in
27:29
australia um is a letter to a newspaper
27:32
complaining about football
27:34
and it's a guy i'm going to read it out
27:36
our town is increasingly going in the
27:38
wrong direction it will ultimately be no
27:40
more than a dutch lang street my pipe is
27:43
out i must now halt till you hear from
27:46
me again bog trotter
27:50
i absolutely love it and another thing
27:51
about norman conquest is um on there's a
27:54
website called howmanyofme.com where you
27:57
can see how many names there are of you
27:59
uh this is only in america unfortunately
28:01
but there are 288
28:03
278 normans in america one
28:07
yeah what people called norman how many
28:09
thou 288 thousand out of 150 million men
28:13
roughly yeah that's quite
28:15
there's 1082 people with the last name
28:18
conquest and there's one person in
28:20
america called norman conquest really
28:23
yeah
28:24
so if you're listening norman um the
28:25
name norman is going out of fashion i
28:27
think in britain i think in 2005 there
28:30
were only two babies called norman born
28:32
and then i couldn't even find data for
28:34
after that so i unless there's been a
28:36
huge surge then i think it might have
28:38
disappeared entirely
28:40
no it's really sad isn't it pretty sad
28:42
can i can i quickly move the chat to
28:44
names in australia yeah i just started
28:46
doing a google on things that i
28:48
both have been to in australia just to
28:50
see the origins of it and i was looking
28:52
at mount cosi cusco which there's a lot
28:54
of i'm actually not sure how to
28:55
pronounce it properly but it's the
28:56
tallest mountain in australia and i've
28:59
climbed it it's so easy to climb it's
29:00
it's a tiny little bump and and um but
29:03
we're very proud of it it's our it's our
29:05
tallest mountain so there's the thing
29:07
was for years and years it was called
29:08
mount cosy cusco and it was this
29:10
wonderful mountain and uh in uh
29:13
basically they discovered this was
29:14
explained in a 1910 book that they
29:17
eventually started recalculating the
29:19
sizes and heights of mountains and
29:20
discovered that a mountain just near
29:23
mount cosy cusco called mount townsend
29:25
was actually taller so suddenly we had a
29:27
new tallest mountain and rather than
29:29
changing all the books they just decided
29:32
this is going to be a massive hassle
29:34
let's just swap the names of the
29:35
mountains
29:37
they genuinely did that
29:39
so mount kozukusko is actually mount
29:41
townsend they were just too lazy to do
29:43
any admin that's such a good idea though
29:45
isn't it yeah you don't have to change
29:46
anything on the maps you could just draw
29:48
two arrows
29:51
so does it not have many big mountains
29:53
australia no i think it's bigger than
29:54
ours how tall is that because you're
29:55
just going that's 2 228 meters right you
29:58
know that's almost three times higher
30:00
than england's highest mountain so we go
30:02
calling it a little bun
30:05
i think it's not is there not a total
30:07
it's the biggest one on the mainland
30:08
isn't there there might be one in the
30:10
australian islands which is a bit there
30:12
are there are a bunch in the australian
30:14
islands uh
30:15
they there's actually a bit on the
30:16
wikipedia page that says mountains
30:18
higher than the highest mountain
30:20
there's a
30:23
[Laughter]
30:34
end on yeah exactly
30:36
there's a website called
30:37
nameoftheyear.com which is quite cool
30:40
and there i don't think it's an official
30:42
award or anything like that but they go
30:43
around and look in all the newspapers
30:45
and anyone who's kind of a notable
30:47
person and they take all the funniest
30:49
names
30:50
and they make them battle against each
30:52
other like which of these is the best
30:53
name and they go through to the next
30:54
round and you have a winner and the
30:56
winner last year was um a lady who hit
30:59
the news after being arrested for
31:00
shoplifting in idaho called amanda
31:03
miranda panda
31:06
wow
31:08
we're sure she didn't just panic when
31:09
the police are saying
31:13
yeah
31:14
some of the people that she beat include
31:16
reverend pierre batista pizza baller
31:20
who is the head of the custody of the
31:22
holy land priory and dr wallop promfong
31:26
who is a professor at
31:29
raja mangala university and there's um
31:32
people in britain uh various names this
31:34
was a newspaper article i think it was
31:35
in the mirror or somewhere uh people
31:37
with funny names um there's a just in
31:38
case a barb dwyer
31:41
terry bull
