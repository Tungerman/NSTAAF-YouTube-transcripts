00:11
hello
00:12
and welcome to another episode of no
00:14
such thing as a fish
00:15
a weekly podcast this week coming to you
00:18
live from glasgow
00:27
my name is dan schreiber and i am
00:30
sitting here
00:31
with andrew hunt and murray anna
00:33
chazinski and
00:34
james harkin and once again we have
00:36
gathered around the microphones with our
00:38
four
00:38
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:40
and in no particular order
00:42
here we go starting with you james
00:45
okay my fact this week is when a very
00:48
large star
00:49
quietly turns into a black hole without
00:51
the usual explosion
00:53
the official term used by astronomers is
00:55
a massive fail
01:00
start as if it wasn't embarrassed enough
01:02
i wasn't able to make the explosion
01:04
well it turns out that about 30 percent
01:06
of massive stars turn into massive fails
01:10
and they found this out quite recently
01:11
they were looking at an area of the
01:13
universe
01:13
um called the firework galaxy uh where
01:16
there's loads of supernovas
01:18
so when it explodes when you've got a
01:19
big star and it explodes it's called the
01:20
supernova
01:21
and eventually that turns into a black
01:23
hole but sometimes it's happening
01:24
without the supernova
01:26
and this area called the firework galaxy
01:27
had loads of supernovas
01:29
but there weren't quite as many as they
01:31
thought there should be and they
01:32
couldn't work out why
01:33
and then they were looking at a star
01:35
called n6946 hyphen bh1
01:39
oh my uncle's called that so that's
01:42
that's an aussie name uh he's a prisoner
01:45
number isn't it
01:52
when he's out in five years you'll
01:53
regret saying that
01:57
and they noticed that it wasn't there
01:58
anymore and it had just kind of quietly
02:00
dissipated
02:01
and this is a thing that happens that
02:02
they've only just found out in the last
02:04
six months or so
02:05
but i think massive phil is a really
02:07
unfair way to characterize it
02:09
because so basically yes the way stars
02:12
turn into black holes is
02:14
it was thought that they turn into a
02:16
supernova as you said and so there's
02:18
this huge explosion
02:20
and then they suddenly shrink into a
02:21
black hole but then these stars aren't
02:24
doing the explosion but that actually
02:25
means that
02:26
they don't blow away as much of the
02:29
debris so apparently supernova
02:30
blow off a lot of the stars outer layers
02:33
um
02:34
and they so therefore there's not as
02:36
much gravitational pull left to make a
02:37
massive black hole
02:38
so actually the massive fails make a
02:41
massive hole
02:42
a bigger hole than the massive successes
02:45
or whatever they call them
02:47
ones i don't know the black holes are
02:49
not really holes
02:51
yeah did what did you think they were i
02:52
thought they were holes
02:54
oh yeah of course
02:57
i could probably have inferred that from
02:59
your previous sentence
03:02
but they're not they're not they're like
03:04
they're the opposite of holes
03:06
do you guys know this black holes are
03:07
the opposite of holes what's the
03:08
opposite of a hole like a sticky outfit
03:10
just a big bulge
03:11
well yeah they're really really full
03:13
they're fuller than anything you've ever
03:15
seen in your life
03:16
because they're so um dense so for
03:19
example
03:20
uh so how much do they weigh okay they
03:22
could have a mass
03:23
greater than 20 times the mass of our
03:25
sun and the really
03:27
big ones can have a mass uh equal to
03:29
four million
03:30
suns those are the extremely large
03:32
supermassive black holes um but they are
03:34
everything crunched inwards yeah so it's
03:36
just like a very large
03:37
uh body which has been crunched down to
03:39
a tiny size they could be any size
03:41
really yeah basically it's
03:43
it's the density that's the important
03:44
thing so you can have tiny ones you can
03:46
have massive ones you could be a black
03:47
hole if i squash you down to the size of
03:49
about
03:50
a tenth the size of a neutrino you would
03:52
be a black hole okay but you and me
03:53
would fall out
03:56
if if the earth got about as dense as a
03:58
black hole
03:59
um if you were crunching it down to the
04:00
roughly the density of a black hole it
04:02
would be
04:03
about the size of an eyeball it'd be
04:05
about two centimeters across
04:08
that density and the whole point of it
04:10
is um the
04:11
the gravity is so strong light can't get
04:14
out of there you can't
04:15
you can't get to the escape velocity
04:16
because light can only go at a certain
04:18
speed and so nothing can
04:19
escape because light is the fastest
04:21
thing that there is if light can't get
04:22
out then nothing can
04:24
although that's the thing about black
04:25
girls has been challenged over the last
04:26
few years isn't it and by stephen
04:28
hawking
04:29
um who yeah so it was assumed that black
04:32
holes did have this strong gravitational
04:34
pull that would mean that
04:35
everything just disappeared into them
04:36
but it turns out they do
04:38
what is referred to as a cosmic burp
04:41
and this apparently is when they
04:44
they consume so much they overeat they
04:47
eat so much stuff
04:49
that they almost are force-fed huge
04:51
amounts of gas
04:52
and they can't swallow it all so it
04:53
spits some back out that's amazing
04:55
it's so weird it's really hard
04:56
researching black holes because i guess
04:57
we don't really know
04:59
fully what they are it's all
05:00
hypothetical and as a result they do
05:02
stuff all the headlines i was looking
05:03
into is
05:04
colorful language like they burp stuff
05:06
up or i read one that i got excited by
05:08
which was us
05:10
uh black hole caught having a post-lunch
05:12
nap after it eats
05:14
solar system and i was like this is
05:15
gonna be great and then it it was not
05:17
it was what did you think it was going
05:20
to be when he said you thought it was
05:22
going to be great did you think they
05:22
were going to describe the fold-out bed
05:24
that they had
05:25
all set up in their office i don't know
05:28
i clicked on it just optimistically not
05:29
thinking anything
05:30
yeah so the stage before a black hole is
05:33
a thing called a neutron star
05:34
so this is where a star collapses and it
05:37
doesn't collapse with quite enough force
05:39
to become a black hole
05:40
but it does become a thing called a
05:41
neutron star which is very very very
05:43
dense but not as dense as a black hole
05:45
so this is very cool a sugar cube of
05:48
neutron star
05:49
would weigh on earth a billion tons
05:52
oh yeah well and it's hard to imagine
05:55
what a billion tons is isn't it really
05:56
yeah is it
05:57
like imagine a billion wonton elephants
06:00
can i put it that way
06:02
wow yeah exactly right and supposed to
06:05
say
06:06
it's pretty difficult to pick up your
06:07
cup of tea i think
06:09
that's going to break the china well if
06:11
you so this is the cool thing if
06:13
if you drop a marshmallow onto a neutron
06:15
star if you're ever in a position to do
06:17
so
06:19
it's got such a strong gravitational
06:20
pull but the impact will be the same as
06:22
an atomic bomb
06:23
because of the amount of gravity pulling
06:25
the marshmallow towards it do you guys
06:26
know when the first
06:28
supernova was recorded on earth no
06:31
the year 3600 bc
06:35
hmm yeah it's this so this is a paper
06:38
that's been put forward um
06:39
it was uh found in cashmere on a cave
06:42
wall it was a cave painting
06:43
which had two bright glowing objects in
06:45
the sky and so this paper is putting
06:48
forward the idea
06:49
that it was the first recording of it
06:50
because the people in context of the
06:53
painting
06:53
weren't hunter-gatherers they were in a
06:55
very separate situation so they looked
06:57
at it very cleverly
06:58
by going how can we prove that our
07:00
theory is right it's a supernova
07:02
and there's something amazing about
07:03
supernovas that have been logged
07:05
they we you know it can happen back in
07:07
3600 it was glowing in the sky
07:09
but the remnants of it still exist you
07:11
can still look for bits of it in the sky
07:13
so
07:14
they've actually been able to look at
07:15
one specific supernova and date it to
07:18
roughly that period
07:19
so it's called hb9 that's the supernova
07:21
that they believe it is and they think
07:22
3600 years ago in cashmere first ever
07:25
supernova
07:26
and they named it after a pencil yeah
07:29
that's actually my auntie's name in
07:30
australia
07:33
there was a supernova in 1054
07:36
which was visible all over europe europe
07:38
was the best place to see it
07:40
it was visible in the daytime for three
07:42
weeks and at night time it was so bright
07:45
that it cast shadows um on people on
07:48
earth
07:48
okay it was absolutely massive but no
07:50
one in europe wrote about it
07:53
why not so it's written about in china
07:55
it was written about you can see it in
07:56
cave paintings and stuff like that in
07:57
other parts of the world
07:59
basically there was a schism going on
08:00
between the roman catholic church and
08:02
the orthodox church at the time
08:04
and apparently both sides thought that
08:06
it would be an ill omen
08:07
and so no one wrote about it at all and
08:10
they just kind of ignored it and it's
08:11
like what's that and i want nothing
08:15
that's amazing you do get rogue black
08:18
holes
08:19
um these rebellious black holes that do
08:21
wander around the universe so
08:23
a lot of black holes are at the center
08:25
of galaxies and the vast majority that
08:26
we've detected are at the center of
08:28
galaxies
08:28
but you get some that don't have their
08:30
own galaxy and they've only been
08:32
detected recently but
08:34
it's kind of thought that they've
08:35
basically had that galaxy stolen
08:37
off them um so this is weird this is
08:39
what astronomers call mergers
08:41
is when it's like a finance financial
08:43
terminology but a minor merger is when
08:46
a larger black hole eats up all the
08:48
stuff that's circling around
08:49
a smaller black hole and then those poor
08:52
black holes that have had their
08:53
equipment stolen
08:54
they just spiral off into space and
08:56
they're just bouncing around space
08:58
always thought maybe they bump into
08:59
another black hole to put it extremely
09:01
crudely in a way that an astronomer
09:03
would faint at
09:04
and yeah they crash into another black
09:07
hole and they
09:08
propelled away into space so they're
09:09
alone black holes desperately looking
09:11
for a mate but are they like
09:12
cowboy maverick black holes who don't
09:15
give a damn with anyone thanks to them
09:17
on the mission of vengeance to get their
09:18
stuff back yeah they're sexy black holes
09:22
hey what i really like about this fact
09:23
is the massive hole uh sorry the massive
09:25
fail bits
09:26
[Laughter]
09:28
so what i love is the massive fail thing
09:30
because um astronomers have a really
09:32
good sense of humor there's a lot of
09:33
jokes and a lot of just little
09:36
acronym puns that happen i found a
09:38
couple um there's one that's called the
09:40
collaboration between australian and
09:41
nippon for
09:42
gamma ray observatory in the outback or
09:45
kangaroo there is the package for the
09:49
interactive analysis of line emission
09:52
or point of veil one word
09:56
okay okay i thought that was crowded
10:00
let's have this one there's a star
10:03
that's been named
10:04
after vladimir putin um unfortunately
10:07
it's been named by ukrainian astronomers
10:09
who've named it
10:10
putin julio or hulo which roughly
10:13
translates as
10:14
putin is a
10:18
and that's a star in the sky it only
10:20
cost ten dollars to do it but it's quite
10:21
nice that it's ukrainian astronomers who
10:23
officially did it
10:24
they do they're famously in the
10:26
astronomy circles good with acronyms
10:29
it's kind of like doctors say you go to
10:31
like big astronomy conferences and
10:34
there's just all these presentations
10:36
that are based on acronyms so
10:37
yeah i think there's poopsy which is
10:39
phase one
10:40
observing proposal system there's super
10:43
huge
10:44
interferometric telescope um
10:47
which is it's glasgow i mean i
10:51
can't believe you're not more
10:52
comfortable
10:53
saying that normally when audiences are
10:57
all shouting they're turning it at
10:58
me
11:01
there's this one that is absolutely
11:03
pushing it too far so this is what it's
11:05
called
11:06
and this was a name for a workshop a big
11:08
astronomy conference and it was titled
11:10
testing astroparticle with the new
11:14
gev observations positrons and electrons
11:18
identifying the sources it's too long
11:22
i forgot what the first letter was i
11:24
know is tango in paris
11:30
[Laughter]
11:33
[Music]
11:36
oh yeah imagine the brain that could
11:39
possibly
11:40
have reached that conclusion
11:44
so speaking of imagine the brain we
11:45
should probably talk in black holes the
11:47
um
11:48
the death this week of uh jim bowen
11:54
no stephen hawking of course um very
11:57
much into black holes hawking radiation
11:59
is what he's famous for
12:00
uh which is the fact that black holes
12:02
get smaller over time by very very small
12:04
amounts and he discovered that
12:06
uh he had quite a good sense of humor
12:07
didn't he yeah i think
12:09
amazing guy yeah his tango in paris joke
12:11
didn't go down so well
12:12
a lot of his other stuff i love there's
12:14
a the official biography of him that
12:16
came out in 2012 was by a
12:18
lady called kitty ferguson a very good
12:20
biography and she wrote in it that there
12:22
was a rumor that hawking used to run
12:23
over the toes of people who annoyed him
12:26
and he would do it sort of subtly as if
12:28
he was just turning around or something
12:30
like that and
12:31
while she was writing the book because
12:32
she had access to him and asked him the
12:33
questions um
12:34
she said is this true this rumor that
12:36
you do this and he said it is a
12:38
malicious rumor
12:39
i'll run over anyone who repeats it
12:41
[Laughter]
12:44
he was a wild wheelchair driver though
12:46
um like
12:47
years ago when you know he was able to
12:49
do whatever he wanted with his
12:50
wheelchair
12:51
and a colleague said that he used to
12:53
show off a lot with his tricks so he
12:54
used to do a lot of spins he used to
12:56
drive his wheelchair incredibly fast
12:58
he actually once broke his hip crashing
13:00
into a wall
13:01
in a show-off stunt that got out of hand
13:04
yeah um there was one that so the times
13:07
thrown a section of
13:08
stephen hawking's stories basically and
13:09
things he'd done there was a time where
13:11
he was appearing on news night
13:12
and he was in the pre-phase they were
13:14
getting the studio ready for him
13:16
and they were setting up all the lights
13:17
and one of the producers uh pulled out a
13:19
lead for one of the lies
13:20
and hawking immediately slumped over in
13:22
his turn
13:25
producer absolutely freaked out
13:34
thinking he killed stephen
13:36
[Laughter]
13:37
ran off to get someone came back a few
13:38
minutes later found him giggling and
13:40
fine
13:42
what a guy
13:43
[Music]
13:47
okay it is time for fact number two and
13:49
that is
13:50
chozinski my fact this week is that levi
13:53
jeans
13:53
are set on fire before they're sold
13:57
and this is specifically by jeans
14:00
ones with holes in them or like
14:02
distressed bits on them
14:04
you know like uh sort of rips or bits
14:07
that look
14:07
cool and
14:10
they've been on fire in the factory
14:13
that's how they do this so there's
14:14
there's been a lot of cover well a bit
14:16
of coverage lately about how levi is
14:18
changing the way it distresses its genes
14:20
because it's got new laser technology
14:22
which allows it to make its genes look
14:24
really worn just with lasers rather than
14:26
by hand
14:27
and yeah if you fire a laser at jeans
14:30
obviously it can set them on fire and
14:32
that's how you get the effect of the
14:34
holes in jeans
14:35
and if you go to a levi factory or many
14:37
jeans factories also use kind of laser
14:39
technology
14:40
then it just smells of smoke all the
14:41
time because you're sort of setting
14:42
genes on fire all the time but this is
14:44
really good because the previous way
14:45
they did it was really
14:47
bad basically right yeah people having
14:49
to do it yeah you
14:50
basically had people getting a pair of
14:51
jeans putting them on mannequins and
14:53
just scrubbing them with
14:54
sandpaper and and with chemicals and
14:56
they get very sick i thought
14:58
they put them on and set themselves on
14:59
fire
15:02
um in 2014 there was a japanese brand
15:05
which
15:05
to get their genes distressed they were
15:07
called zoo jeans and they had
15:09
jeans which lions tigers and bears had
15:11
attacked
15:12
in a zoo they only made three pairs
15:16
i don't really think you want to wear
15:17
those do you because once a bear has
15:19
gotten the taste for those genes
15:23
it's true it'll go on a mission of uh
15:25
gene vengeance for you
15:26
well they well it was so clever how they
15:28
did it so they took uh old tires and
15:30
giant rubber rings and
15:31
you know things that um animals and zoos
15:33
are given to play with they wrapped them
15:34
in a sheet of denim
15:35
gave them to the animals animals went
15:37
rip rip rip and then they took as they
15:38
said the most fashionable remnants
15:43
and they turned those into a pairs of
15:45
jeans very cool
15:47
wow well they also have got people to
15:49
wear down jeans
15:50
for potential consumers so this is a
15:53
welsh denim label called heat
15:55
and they in 2014 they hired 50 men to
15:58
break in
15:59
their genes so they made they hired all
16:02
these men and they had to wear these
16:03
jeans for six months
16:05
non-stop so wear them every single day
16:07
whatever they did and they weren't
16:08
allowed to wash them
16:09
and so there was i read an interview
16:11
with one of the guys who said he wore
16:12
them every day for everything he played
16:14
rugby in them
16:15
um he cooked in them so you know cooking
16:17
spills he did carpentry in them he was a
16:19
carpenter
16:20
he saw sunbathed he cycled every day he
16:22
sunbathed in them
16:25
he did not get a good tan but then
16:28
that's to kind of make them seem worn
16:30
and then they were auctioned off
16:32
and you know they got a few hundred
16:33
pounds each for them a few hundred
16:35
pounds
16:36
for six months work though i know it's
16:39
not a good rate is it
16:41
that's how the carpentry business worked
16:43
out
16:44
um they're apparently if you wear jeans
16:47
and you commit a crime
16:48
um they're kind of like a fingerprint
16:50
the police can tell the genes
16:53
if they catch you on cctv and the cctv
16:55
is good enough
16:56
they have a unique were pattern um so if
16:59
you're caught on film they can look at
17:00
them
17:00
and they can tell that these are the
17:02
actual genes that were used in the
17:03
robbery
17:04
as in the the specific pair or they can
17:06
tell that that was all
17:07
oh he's wearing skinny jeans there no no
17:09
they can tell the actual pair so like
17:11
let's say you have been playing rugby
17:13
and sunbathing in a pair of jeans
17:14
or you've just been walking down the
17:16
street they look slightly different
17:18
and there are forensic people who can
17:20
tell the difference between what you've
17:21
been doing
17:22
and can tell your genes from someone
17:23
else's genes wow what you should do is
17:25
just have a pair of crime jeans
17:28
when they're forensics guys like i said
17:30
well these genes have only been used for
17:31
crime we can
17:32
and then you keep them in a draw when
17:35
you're out crying
17:38
they can be used as armor genes in a way
17:42
because there was a guy in pennsylvania
17:44
a couple of years ago whose estranged
17:46
wife
17:46
attacked him um with a box cutter to his
17:50
genitals
17:51
but his jeans were so thick that they
17:53
stopped him from getting injured
17:55
wow a little tip for you
17:59
[Laughter]
18:07
did it rebound off the cloth or did it
18:09
was there yeah there was a rip in the
18:11
jeans but she couldn't get through the
18:13
jean fabric
18:14
because it was really thick in the
18:15
crotch area wow handy
18:18
then sometimes the process of making
18:20
jeans is quite intense so they're
18:21
sometimes
18:22
baked um which you know to get get that
18:25
worn look
18:27
they're repeatedly washed they are
18:30
they're um so they used to be sand
18:32
blasted but the new way of doing it with
18:34
lasers
18:35
is it takes 90 seconds i think to make a
18:37
pair of jeans look like it's been worn
18:38
for a year
18:39
whereas it used to take about half an
18:40
hour um but do you know why
18:43
so this is all kind of technology that
18:44
levi is at the forefront
18:46
of but do you know what made them famous
18:49
why we think they believe that what made
18:51
levi's famous
18:54
early jeans yeah i thought they were
18:56
like the first levi strauss made the
18:57
first jeans now yeah well
18:59
it's so it didn't invent genes what he
19:01
invented was
19:02
you know the weird um bits of metal the
19:06
rivets
19:06
the the rivets that are in your jeans
19:09
and that no one knows why the hell
19:10
they're there
19:11
that's what levi invented so they're
19:14
there to protect the genitals from your
19:15
estranged wife
19:18
bizarrely they didn't because they had
19:19
to get rid of them specifically on the
19:21
crotch because if people were outdoors
19:23
back in the day
19:24
leaning over a fire they would suddenly
19:26
heat their genitals up
19:28
that was the biggest complaint it was i
19:30
was having a nice time by the fire
19:32
when my balls lit on fire
19:35
but yeah those metal bits actually keep
19:37
them together and i've always wondered
19:38
what they're for
19:39
and they were invented in 1871 by a guy
19:41
who came to levi strauss who marketed
19:43
them
19:43
and they keep genes together so genes
19:45
used to just fall apart before that
19:47
because
19:47
they didn't have that strengthening
19:48
technology and that's that's what they
19:50
did and they also put the tiny pointless
19:52
pocket in
19:53
which you know that pocket that's inside
19:55
the pocket we know what that's for
19:56
yeah huh yeah it's for pocket watches
19:58
which haven't existed
19:59
for about a century and yet still they
20:02
are in jeans okay
20:03
yeah that's good and really i think the
20:05
patent for it everyone assume it's the
20:07
denim but it's actually the rivets
20:09
yeah when they actually filed the patent
20:11
that was the big thing that they were
20:12
trademarking
20:13
that's cool yeah yeah um there's some
20:15
stuff on lasers oh yeah yeah
20:17
do you know the um parrots have been
20:18
flying through lasers recently
20:20
because this is so scientists want to
20:23
make better drones
20:24
they want to make us work out technology
20:26
for how to fly better
20:28
and so they've been investigating how
20:30
birds fly and there was a study done
20:32
i think last year but there was a study
20:34
done that looked at the flight of a
20:36
parrot but they needed to investigate
20:37
exactly how they flap their wings when
20:39
they take off
20:40
and so what they did was that it was
20:41
actually a parrot let which i really
20:43
like it's like a really tiny parrot
20:45
but what they did is they had it fly
20:47
through a bunch of aerosol particles in
20:49
the air
20:50
that would then lit up with lasers
20:52
because they're so precise so then you
20:54
can have the aerosol particles all
20:55
illuminated
20:56
and then the lasers kind of show what
20:58
kind of wing movements they're making
21:00
and so they found out how how bird's
21:01
wings moves when they fly and then we
21:03
can use that in drone technology
21:04
but what's quite sweet is that obviously
21:06
going through lasers is quite damaging
21:08
for you
21:08
so if you look it up they designed tiny
21:11
pairs of goggles
21:12
for the parrots to protect them from the
21:14
lasers parrotlets as well
21:18
yeah so they're tiny little glasses
21:20
really tiny yeah it's almost as sweet as
21:22
not making a parrot fly through a load
21:24
of lasers
21:28
i imagine pirate pirates with what
21:29
children pirates would have on their
21:31
shoulder
21:34
this is a fall
21:38
okay it is time for fact number three
21:40
and that
21:41
is my fact this week thomas edison
21:44
tested over 1
21:45
600 different materials to find the
21:47
right filament for the inside of his
21:48
light bulbs
21:49
including fishing lines cardboard and
21:52
hairs from the red beard of an old
21:54
friend
21:57
imagine if that had been the most
21:58
successful as well yeah
22:00
all light bulbs would have to be full of
22:01
red beard here by now it did turn on
22:03
it would be excellent for the economy of
22:05
scotland
22:06
[Laughter]
22:10
a risky comment
22:13
um yeah um so this is um this is one of
22:17
those stories
22:17
that is uh thomas edison is a character
22:20
so
22:21
clouded in apocryphal stories and
22:23
legends and so on
22:25
but this was reported in a number of
22:27
official biographies by him
22:28
but um the story goes that they were
22:30
trying to work out how to make the light
22:32
bulbs
22:32
of the original light bulb he was doing
22:34
last longer than a few hours or so on
22:37
that was they had a limit on it and
22:38
he tried over supposedly a thousand six
22:40
hundred things and when it was a
22:42
thousand six hundred things it would be
22:43
like they used
22:44
like 40 different varieties of bamboo so
22:46
that would be part of the list for
22:48
example
22:48
so it wasn't completely random things
22:50
like ripping beards off and so on
22:53
but um one of the stories from an
22:55
official biography
22:56
says that a friend of his of old days
22:58
who was his boss at a station
23:00
at a railroad station that he worked at
23:01
when he was younger called mr mckenzie
23:03
came in he was a really fun character
23:05
and edison as a joke said why don't we
23:07
try
23:08
it with your redbeard took off the
23:09
strands put it in it did go up and it
23:11
had a red light as it went up as well
23:13
which is
23:14
wow nice yeah and uh yeah so
23:17
actually when they did that there was a
23:18
competition between mackenzie and
23:20
another guy called john crusi
23:22
and they wanted to have a competition
23:23
whose beard would be best inside the um
23:26
oh really yeah and chrissy um he was
23:28
swiss and he had a big
23:30
black bushy beard uh mackenzie was more
23:32
bristly and straight and they had a
23:34
competition
23:35
and uh mackenzie was the winner uh but
23:37
actually they were both
23:38
pretty yeah what what was the thing
23:41
that
23:42
won excuse me ignorance and out of these
23:44
1600 things was it
23:45
well now we use what tungsten or
23:47
something that we yeah oh yeah
23:48
but it was bamboo at the time wasn't it
23:50
or sort of a bamboo
23:53
so it was bamboo to start off with um he
23:55
found japanese bamboo
23:57
and he sent a team of explorers to south
23:59
america and they found some really good
24:00
bamboo
24:02
but then they got confused and they
24:03
forgot where they found it so they
24:04
brought some back but they couldn't
24:06
remember where they got it from
24:08
so then he had to send another guy
24:09
called james um rickelton
24:11
out to the jungles around the world
24:13
actually sri lanka burma malaysia india
24:15
all over for a year he looked around for
24:18
the best
24:18
perfect bamboo and he got to sri lanka
24:21
and he found this bamboo it's amazing
24:22
and it was going to be perfect for the
24:24
light bulb and he got home to edison he
24:26
said i've got this bamboo and edison
24:28
said oh we're using carbon now
24:32
and then carbon was the final thing that
24:33
he used that's
24:35
that's really harsh yeah it's quite
24:37
funny though
24:38
could at least have said oh thank you
24:40
this looks great thank you
24:41
great and then quietly said we're going
24:44
to use the carbon you know
24:46
like let him have a few days of thinking
24:48
he'd want the amazing thing about the
24:49
cabin actually that was invented by a
24:51
guy called lewis howard latimer
24:54
and he was an african-american draftsman
24:56
who was a son of an escaped slave
24:58
but the amazing thing about him is he
25:00
invented the carbon filament which made
25:02
edison's millions
25:04
but he was also the draftsman who drew
25:06
up the patent for alexander graham
25:08
bell's telephone
25:09
wow so he's part of those two massive
25:11
things the big rivalry
25:14
yeah um he but his light bulb was
25:17
obviously very revolutionary even though
25:19
he didn't technically invent the light
25:21
bulb but
25:21
um i guess he was extremely good at pr
25:24
edison so he had this
25:25
invention factory which made sure they
25:28
turned out the best inventions
25:29
um and one good pr move he made it was
25:32
in 1884
25:33
on halloween he got so employees of the
25:37
edison electric lighting company
25:39
they paraded up and down new york with
25:41
light bulbs strapped to their heads
25:43
so they thought they were having an
25:45
amazing idea
25:48
maybe that's where that came from um but
25:51
yeah this is amazing it was a show off
25:52
the new light bulbs which had just been
25:54
invented
25:54
and there was a huge horse-drawn
25:56
generator in the middle of all these
25:58
hundreds of employees
25:59
of the factory horse-drawn generator
26:01
which changed steam into electricity
26:04
um so this big kind of steam powered
26:05
machine in the middle and then
26:07
hundreds of people who are held together
26:09
with wire that was going from the light
26:11
bulbs on their heads and down through
26:12
their sleeves and then linking them to
26:14
the next person
26:15
so kind of like you know those gloves
26:16
that you wore as a child that connected
26:18
to each other through your chest
26:20
oh mittens yeah what yeah missions i
26:24
mean around your chest
26:28
but yeah they paraded through new york
26:30
and it was this huge piano
26:32
all these people tied together with
26:34
light bulbs flashing on their heads so
26:35
sorry were they tied together because it
26:36
was one
26:37
uh chain yes it was one circuit imagine
26:40
if one of them had gone like in
26:41
christmas lights and you had to go
26:42
through testing
26:43
every individual employee
26:46
[Laughter]
26:49
he used to do so for ideas he used to do
26:51
this thing um
26:52
and this again has been written in a
26:54
bunch of biographies and a lot of people
26:55
think that this really happened we're
26:56
not sure
26:57
um he used to when he was falling asleep
26:59
he thought that's when he had his best
27:01
ideas
27:01
and he would think i would have the idea
27:03
and then i'd fall asleep and i'd wake up
27:05
later and go oh what was that amazing
27:06
idea
27:07
so he used to take naps during the day
27:09
on a chair
27:10
and in his hand he would hold metallic
27:12
balls just two metal balls
27:14
with a metal plate underneath him so as
27:16
he was going into that zone where he was
27:18
having an idea as he was going into a
27:19
nap
27:20
his hand would go loose when he fell
27:22
into the sleep the ball would land in
27:24
the plate
27:24
wake him up and he could immediately go
27:26
ah that idea is amazing and write it
27:28
down
27:29
and have it and no one's officially uh
27:31
said that that's definitely the case of
27:33
how he did that but there's a famous
27:35
statue in florida of him
27:36
uh which people always go and visit and
27:38
in his hand is a metal ball
27:40
which gives a little nod to the fact
27:42
that they think it was true
27:44
that's cool yeah he did he was famous
27:46
for taking naps because he he
27:48
said that sleep was rubbish and no one
27:50
needed that much and he said he only had
27:51
three hours sleep a night but there were
27:53
all these photos of him with henry ford
27:54
who was one of his best friends
27:56
afford fame there all these photos of
27:57
him asleep
28:00
henry ball's really often awake and he's
28:02
just having a nap in the background
28:04
just like constant cat naps and they
28:06
were close him and henry ford they were
28:08
super close yeah
28:09
it's like proper bffs for life they went
28:12
on camping trips together
28:13
[Music]
28:14
um so edison became confined to a
28:17
wheelchair in his later life and ford
28:19
bought a wheelchair for himself so they
28:21
could have wheelchair races
28:22
yeah no way yeah that's really sweet
28:25
and there's a there's a thing which is
28:27
quite famous but maybe a lot of people
28:29
haven't heard which was
28:30
when he died um they captured
28:33
they were said to do this and it was
28:34
handed over to henry ford by
28:36
edison's son the last breath of thomas
28:38
edison
28:39
so they had these little test tubes and
28:41
there was eight of them that were
28:42
sitting along there breathed his last
28:44
breath
28:44
they put in the cork afterwards and if
28:47
you go to this day to the henry ford
28:48
museum
28:49
he has the test tube on display yeah
28:52
you don't you don't know which is going
28:54
to be the last breath they must have
28:55
been stood there for a long time
28:57
yeah for months maybe you just wait
29:00
there did they wait with a test tube and
29:01
say
29:02
here's the last the second last time all
29:05
right
29:05
the third last breath fine okay new test
29:07
tube yeah
29:08
i don't know it's apocrypha is it
29:12
yeah um this this won't go in but i'll
29:14
just quickly say it because i read it
29:15
today
29:15
um i read the last words of roald dahl
29:18
and
29:18
uh roald dahl's last words he was
29:20
surrounded by his family he was very ill
29:22
and his final words were um the thing
29:25
i'm gonna miss most
29:26
is being with all of you as his final
29:28
words and then he went down
29:30
except it wasn't quite his last words
29:32
because the nurse who was with him
29:33
thought
29:34
i'll make it easy on him and gave him a
29:35
shot of morphine to make it go easy on
29:38
the way out but as she did it he went oh
29:40
29:42
and those are wrong dolls last words
29:44
brilliant
29:47
okay it is time for our final fact of
29:49
the show and that is
29:50
andrew hunter murray my fact is that
29:53
it's only worth leaning over to pick up
29:54
a one p
29:55
coin if you can do it in less than three
29:57
seconds
29:59
anything more than that waste of time
30:01
move on i reckon i could do it in that
30:03
time i'm sure you could
30:05
um yeah i'm sure you could but you'd
30:07
have to do it pretty much
30:08
every three seconds for it to be worth
30:10
me giving up my job
30:12
you would yes yeah this basically
30:14
applies if you're on the
30:16
median uk salary which is uh 539 pounds
30:20
a week
30:20
and if you do that assuming you work a
30:22
40-hour week
30:24
um um with nine to six with an hour for
30:27
lunch let's say
30:28
um you've got 2.6 seconds to do it
30:31
okay now the problem is if you earn
30:34
more than that obviously you have to do
30:36
it a lot faster to make an economical
30:37
exercise for you
30:39
so the prime minister uh based on her
30:42
current salary i have assumed a 60-hour
30:43
week for her because she is
30:44
busy
30:45
[Laughter]
30:48
but i have given her a now for lunch
30:49
don't worry
30:52
she would have to do it in 0.5 seconds
30:54
which is quite hard
30:55
yes that's tough i've worked it out for
30:57
cristiano ronaldo as well
30:59
i am on his current salary he would have
31:01
to do it in naught point naught naught
31:03
two seconds and he would have to pick up
31:05
391
31:06
every second to make it worth as well
31:08
wow he's
31:09
he is quick though he is quick yeah i
31:12
worked it out for philip hammond
31:14
um based on his um an independent
31:16
article that estimated his income so
31:18
this is not just his salary
31:20
it's all of the money that comes in for
31:21
him and he would have to be able to pick
31:23
it up in 0.2
31:24
seconds which is coincidentally the
31:27
limit of human reaction time
31:29
so he would have to immediately notice
31:32
it pick it up
31:33
without any movement just notice it pick
31:35
it up no sit pick it up no sit pick it
31:37
up
31:37
basically that's the fastest anyone can
31:39
possibly pick up coins i reckon wow
31:41
but if he did that he really would not
31:43
be getting on with the job would he and
31:45
it is an important job he's got i would
31:47
say he should focus on being chancellor
31:49
and then leave the coin picking to
31:51
teresa
31:54
maybe that's what she's been doing it's
31:56
a strong plan
31:57
for brexit just going to look for any
32:00
coins we can find
32:01
[Laughter]
32:04
we've got no trade deals but does anyone
32:05
look behind the sofa
32:09
but this is kind of um this is partly
32:12
about
32:13
uh how the 1p is silly
32:16
but it's not worth very much at all and
32:18
there's a lot of talk of getting rid of
32:20
it
32:20
right so i think it's basically not
32:22
worth picking it up at any point
32:25
you're not even allowed to pay with one
32:27
piece in more than 21p
32:30
so i so if something's 22p you can't pay
32:33
with just one piece yeah and i've broken
32:35
the law on multiple occasions
32:37
well it's it's not a law per se it's
32:40
that they don't have to accept it as
32:41
legal
32:42
tender yes um but if you're in one of
32:44
those self-service places
32:45
and you can just put them in really
32:46
quickly before they notice then you can
32:48
do as many as you want actually yeah
32:50
um so yeah there is an idea of getting
32:51
rid of the one piece and the two pieces
32:53
i think george osborne
32:54
wanted to do it didn't he when he was
32:55
chancellor but um david cameron said we
32:58
shouldn't because everyone will vote us
32:59
out
33:01
and the amount of money you pay to make
33:03
them
33:04
is more than what they're worth yeah
33:06
it's something like
33:07
6 out of 10 uk 1p and 2ps are only used
33:11
once
33:11
and then put in a jar and then um one in
33:14
12
33:15
the coins are thrown into the bin
33:16
immediately and at one stage the royal
33:18
mint was having to make 500 million 1p
33:21
and 2p
33:21
coins every year to replace those who
33:23
are going out of circulation
33:25
i do not believe anyone throws one p
33:27
coins into the bin
33:28
does anyone here throw coins just into
33:30
the bin
33:31
one in 12 people do so no in a charity
33:35
box or into a jar
33:36
straight straighten them in not maniac
33:40
but i've been tempted it's completely
33:42
insane right okay so
33:43
did you say 500 million a year yeah
33:45
guess how many pennies the uk made in
33:48
the year 1933
33:50
god this is the worst game show ever
33:53
uh a billion seven
33:57
so close they've made seven pennies for
34:01
the whole year
34:02
what yeah why did they do that because
34:04
they had loads already it turns out
34:06
so these are but seven is a strange
34:09
number isn't it you would think
34:10
zero why would you need seven more get
34:13
the machines back up and running
34:15
does it does anyone have 7p
34:18
okay the reason for it was because i
34:20
think the men didn't want to miss a year
34:21
they didn't want to have a year in which
34:22
they did not make one of the coins of
34:24
the realm
34:25
so they made several oh wait a minute
34:26
they must be really rare they're so rare
34:28
so this is even rarer because three of
34:31
them were placed by the king
34:32
under the foundation stones of important
34:34
buildings okay
34:36
two went to the british museum two went
34:38
into private hands
34:39
which buildings do we know what they are
34:40
i don't know i i think it probably is
34:42
known
34:43
um there are four prototypes coins as
34:45
well
34:46
and one of those in 2016 sold for 72
34:49
000 pounds wow they're so rare that
34:52
people uh
34:53
start modifying 1935 coins because they
34:56
can most easily be
34:57
adapted and made to look like a 33 penny
35:04
they used to in the 8th century um they
35:07
had pennies
35:07
but they didn't have because things
35:09
would cost less than a penny
35:10
so what they ended up doing was just
35:12
they would chop the pennies in half
35:14
so if you were to shop you'd be like i
35:15
need some change and they would just
35:16
slice your penny
35:17
into and give you the either the quarter
35:19
or the half that they
35:20
we had happiness as well didn't we have
35:22
pennies yeah well hey
35:23
sorry happiness were um they came about
35:25
from the chopping in half and actually
35:27
the design of coins
35:28
in that period like the 8th century
35:30
around and then in the 1200s
35:32
henry ii introduced what was called the
35:35
long cross coin
35:36
and it was a coin where the cross figure
35:38
on it the christian cross
35:40
went properly from top to bottom and
35:41
from right to left and that was to make
35:43
it easier to cut
35:44
so that was if you could change you
35:46
could give it more easily because you
35:47
could just break it up
35:48
and then that's where hatefulness
35:49
actually that's where pieces of eight
35:51
comes from as well isn't it
35:52
really um because you were saying before
35:54
about piece of form whatever the piece
35:55
of eight was you would have a coin and
35:57
you cut it into eight pieces yeah and
35:58
that's why a quarter is called two bits
36:00
in america what would be made to that
36:03
you could chop it so easily
36:05
metal soft soft metals specifically
36:07
silver
36:08
silver and gold are quite soft exactly
36:10
and
36:11
that's why if you get a if you get a
36:13
gold medal and you bite it
36:14
yeah to prove whether it's real gold or
36:16
not to prove it's gold it's not harder
36:17
it's softer so
36:18
if you bite something that's made out of
36:20
gold you should get little teeth marks
36:21
in it
36:22
yeah okay yeah unless it leaves really
36:25
big teeth marks in which case it's a
36:26
chocolate coin
36:27
yes
36:31
don't be fooled again then
36:35
um just on that um like so people used
36:37
to chop little bits off the edges of
36:39
coins and that was a really bad crime
36:41
had very severe punishments because
36:42
obviously it's devaluing the coin of the
36:44
realm
36:44
but people used to do it anyway because
36:46
you can melt down the silver and recast
36:48
it
36:48
and in 2015 again a horde of silver
36:50
clippings was found in a field in
36:52
gloucestershire
36:53
by someone with a metal detector and it
36:55
was a huge bundle of shaved off coins
36:59
and i just love the name it's been given
37:00
it was called the toenail horde
37:02
because it looks all these little round
37:05
trimmings of coins they look like
37:07
that's amazing that's why coins have got
37:09
milling on the side of it so
37:11
little kind of indentations on the side
37:12
of every coin if you look at it
37:14
that's to stop people from shaving off
37:15
and that was invented by i think isaac
37:17
newton
37:18
who was the master of the mint as well
37:20
as doing all the other stuff he did
37:21
right
37:22
it's such a good name isn't it yeah yeah
37:24
uh here's another idea
37:26
get rid of one piece two piece five
37:28
piece 10ps and 50ps
37:29
and instead have one piece three p's
37:32
11ps and 37ps
37:35
you've gone mad yeah it's just math
37:38
sandy it's just maths
37:39
if you have those um coins then it makes
37:42
it easier for any
37:43
kind of combination of coins to be used
37:45
for any number
37:46
of of any price basically 37p yeah
37:50
because they're all prime numbers so
37:51
apart from one but they're all kind of
37:53
kind of prime numbers
37:55
one's kind of a prime number oh we're
37:57
gonna get so many of them
37:59
but basically it means that say
38:01
something's you know 76p
38:03
or 84p it's just easier to work out with
38:05
that specific
38:06
number of things on average it's 4.1
38:08
coins per transaction
38:10
compared to 1p 2p and 500. 37p
38:13
coins that's so hard to work out no you
38:16
get used to it pretty quick
38:17
like if you had to learn your 37 times
38:19
table just to pay for stuff
38:22
you know the first person who introduced
38:24
the penny to the uk
38:26
um this is also in the 8th century and
38:29
this is king
38:30
offer of mercia so 8th century he made
38:32
the first penny in the uk
38:34
and the incredible thing about this
38:36
which i just love and i learned when i
38:37
went to the british museum
38:38
and i saw an example of one of his early
38:40
gold coins
38:42
um is this so only three gold coins from
38:45
his reign survive so the introduce of
38:47
the penny to britain
38:48
um and he on the he was a christian king
38:52
and the phrase around this gold coin in
38:56
the british museum is
38:57
there is no god but allah alone and is
39:00
because
39:01
it's it's so incredible so it was just a
39:03
century after muhammad basically
39:05
and the abbasid caliphs were taking over
39:08
large parts of europe and he wanted to
39:10
be a well we're not entirely sure why
39:12
the coin said this but one theory is
39:13
that he wanted to be able to
39:15
trade with them and they would see these
39:16
coins as valuable they would recognize
39:18
that and think yeah you're one of us
39:19
that's fine
39:20
um but then a lot of other people think
39:22
actually he just didn't speak arabic
39:24
and he had no idea what those words
39:25
meant and he's a christian king who
39:27
accidentally wrote
39:28
on his coins there's no god but allah is
39:29
like a tattoo with
39:31
some old kind of japanese characters and
39:33
it actually says
39:35
english wanker
39:38
do you know the least valuable coin in
39:40
the world
39:41
is it's it's an uzbek coin and it's the
39:44
one
39:45
teagan coin okay if you had three
39:48
thousand of them
39:49
you would have one penny that's the
39:51
exchange rate
39:52
and i worked out that ronaldo
39:58
if he wanted to make a profit would have
39:59
to pick up one million and 173
40:03
thousand tea in every second
40:07
he is fast though
40:11

[Music]
00:11
hello
00:12
and welcome to another episode of no
00:14
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:17
this week coming to you live
00:18
from leeds
00:27
my name is dan schreiber and i am
00:30
sitting here
00:31
with anna chazinski andrew hunter murray
00:34
and james harkin
00:35
and once again we have gathered around
00:37
the microphones with our four favorite
00:39
facts from the last seven days
00:40
and in no particular order here we go
00:43
starting with you
00:44
chazinski my fact this week is that the
00:47
first hydraulic lift was invented to
00:50
carry
00:51
sheep onto a roof
00:54
and it was invented to do that in leeds
00:57
in fact
00:59
[Music]
01:01
you suck up i know i know what can i say
01:04
no it's this place called temple works
01:06
and it's in an area called holbeck
01:08
do you all know temple works you must do
01:11
you go um and yeah it's this amazing
01:14
building so
01:15
uh it was it was a flax mill it was
01:17
started in 1836
01:18
it was at the time it was built it was
01:20
the biggest room in the world
01:23
and it was this guy who was designing
01:25
this flax mill
01:26
but he wanted to make it he was very
01:27
safety conscious and so he thought it
01:29
should all be on one level because he
01:30
thought if there was a fire everyone
01:32
needed to be able to escape quite fast
01:33
so it was one floor
01:34
huge room and the reason for the sheep
01:37
on the roof
01:38
is that so he planted a lawn on the roof
01:41
all this grass because for the flexible
01:42
to work properly it needed to be quite
01:44
moist air inside and so the grass on the
01:46
roof
01:47
kind of sucks moisture out of the air
01:49
and then it was siphoned down in pipes
01:51
into the factory and if you've got grass
01:54
you need someone to mow it
01:55
and that's the herd of sheep and so he
01:57
invented this lift because she can't go
01:59
upstairs
01:59
and that is the story of temple works
02:02
[Laughter]
02:04
it's a long and convoluted reason to
02:06
invent a lift but that's what he did
02:08
yeah it is it is the biggest room in the
02:10
world isn't it i wanted to oh it was
02:11
yeah and i wanted to find out what was
02:13
the biggest room in the world now and so
02:14
i googled it but whenever you google it
02:16
you just get the phrase the largest room
02:18
in the world is the room for improvement
02:22
that's so true how um we probably don't
02:26
know this but how many sheep
02:27
occupied the roof was it like it was was
02:30
it a lot were they sort of
02:31
clustered up or was it just a couple i
02:33
think it would have been enough to eat
02:35
that much grass yeah so not much
02:38
i reckon i'm going to say six six oh
02:42
i'd say more than six it was a very big
02:44
room i started counting them but i fell
02:46
asleep
02:48
but yeah it's a really cool building and
02:50
it was the vision of this guy called
02:51
john marshall who was an early 19th
02:53
century industrialist
02:54
when people were starting to think about
02:56
worker safety and
02:58
so another thing it had was 25 fire
03:00
escapes
03:01
which it was like one room which was a
03:03
two acre large room but even so 25.
03:06
i think the whole thing was doors but
03:08
surely none of the sheep would have been
03:10
able to escape in the event of a fire
03:12
a they can't go downstairs no you just
03:14
got a nice barbecue waiting for you when
03:16
you get back to the building
03:18
i read that since the 90s in switzerland
03:21
the requirement for
03:22
every new building is that they should
03:24
have the ability to have a sustainable
03:25
rooftop with
03:26
brass on the top so if you take visuals
03:29
of switzerland
03:30
uh by let's say google earth or whatever
03:32
it's just beautifully green
03:34
yeah like they've hidden the whole
03:35
country yes imagine trying to bomb
03:38
switzerland you couldn't
03:39
i know they've got nuclear bunkers for
03:41
every person in the whole population
03:43
yeah where are the nuclear bunkers we
03:44
don't know
03:46
but i think this is amazing isn't it
03:48
because at the moment green architecture
03:50
is like the
03:51
the main thing that everyone's trying to
03:52
do right all the new cities are putting
03:54
um grass on top of their buildings and
03:57
leeds was doing it 150 years ago
03:59
yeah very cool which is pretty cool and
04:01
green architecture takes
04:03
30 percent less energy to heat your
04:05
building um
04:06
for just a two percent increase in
04:08
construction costs
04:09
um and the world standards for green
04:12
architecture are the leadership
04:13
in energy and environmental design
04:15
standards
04:16
or leads
04:21
what's good is that that's very good do
04:22
you want to talk about sheep though
04:24
uh yeah i'd love to talk about sheep
04:27
well i did i did uh because this is
04:29
this fact is about sheep on a roof and
04:31
um i was looking at different places to
04:33
put sheep
04:34
and um one thing i found amazing is that
04:38
captain cook when he was going between
04:39
australia and new zealand
04:41
um one place that he really wanted to
04:43
put sheep was new zealand
04:45
which new zealand is now known for sheep
04:46
but in captain cook's time they weren't
04:48
there
04:48
and his his idea was to introduce sheep
04:51
to new zealand and he brought two with
04:53
him
04:54
and he arrived this was his second
04:55
journey there after sussing it out the
04:57
first time being like
04:58
no sheep and so he went back brought
05:00
some and um
05:02
he thought this was going to be his big
05:03
thing he thought this is i'm going to
05:04
i'm going to spread this breed
05:06
and he let them out and two days later
05:08
or within a few days
05:10
they ate a couple poisonous plants and
05:11
died immediately
05:13
yeah and he wrote last night the you and
05:15
ram i had so much care and trouble
05:17
brought to this place
05:18
died we did suppose that they were
05:20
poisoned by eating some poisonous plants
05:22
thus all my fine hopes of stocking this
05:24
country where the breeder sheep were
05:25
blasted in a moment
05:27
wow yeah poor captain cook and that's
05:29
why there are no sheep in new zealand
05:31
today
05:31
no and then other people are like love
05:33
the sheep idea captain
05:35
i'll get some over and then they did and
05:36
now there's more sheep there than people
05:38
in new zealand though sheep racing is a
05:40
very popular thing and in fact across
05:42
the world and some people take it really
05:43
seriously i didn't quite know this was a
05:45
thing
05:45
but it's kind of like dog racing so they
05:47
jump over hurdles and stuff and in new
05:49
zealand the big race i think
05:50
they go around a pub um and jump over
05:53
lots of beer barrels and sheep get up to
05:55
60 miles an hour
05:56
six sorry when they're old sixty miles
05:59
an hour what do they act
06:00
i mean that's good maybe that's
06:03
impossible isn't it
06:05
they push them off a skyscraper at the
06:07
end that's what it is
06:08
um no that's not possible is it i've
06:10
just seen that in my notes and thought
06:12
that's faster than a cheater i think
06:15
i mean wouldn't that be amazing if we
06:17
just found out the sheep are the fastest
06:19
animals
06:21
imagine the look on the sheepdog's face
06:23
[Laughter]
06:25
well where are the sheep boy you were
06:28
not gonna believe what happened
06:32
do you know that in new zealand they're
06:33
actually trying there's a new zealand
06:35
farmer's federation and they're trying
06:37
to push for sheep sharing to become an
06:38
olympic sport
06:40
yeah that's our latest push because and
06:42
it's been recognized as a sport this is
06:44
one of the first steps that you need in
06:45
order to get to the olympics
06:46
so sheep shearing whole dancing yeah i
06:49
saw that article so
06:51
um it was last year wasn't it and it's a
06:53
whole load of new spots are
06:55
now accepted by the international sports
06:57
association yeah
06:59
of associations uh and pole dancing our
07:02
table football is sheep shearing is but
07:04
rugby league isn't
07:08
really yeah and they reckon that it's
07:10
because the rugby union people are
07:12
blocking them
07:14
i know
07:18
do you know that um sheep are happier
07:20
when they're surrounded by photos of
07:21
friends and family
07:24
no this is true i swear to god
07:27
this was a this was published in the
07:30
royal society's
07:31
newspaper biological sciences basically
07:33
um
07:34
the sheep were put in a dark room in an
07:36
experiment and they were shown various
07:38
things
07:38
and their behavior was recorded and when
07:40
they were shown sheep that were familiar
07:42
to them
07:43
they had a lower heart rate and they
07:45
made fewer bleats
07:46
than when they were shown triangles or
07:49
goats
07:51
but to be fair a triangle is a natural
07:54
predator or a sheep
07:57
the report of it in the telegraph said
07:59
that the discovery
08:00
could point to the reason that many of
08:02
us carry pictures of loved ones
08:04
yeah i guess we needed the sheep to tell
08:06
us that the problem is
08:07
there's nowhere to put photographs of
08:09
your loved ones if you're a sheep
08:11
there's no wall to hang them on and they
08:13
don't have bedside tables yeah
08:14
but at 60 miles an hour you can visit
08:16
them so quickly it's
08:22
um okay let's move on to our next fact
08:25
it's time for fact number two and that
08:27
is my fact
08:28
my fact this week is that pope leo the
08:31
13th
08:32
was once the face of a wine and cocaine
08:35
cocktail
08:35
[Laughter]
08:37
this was a drink that was sold back in
08:39
the 19 late 1800s and early 1900s called
08:43
vin mariani and it was the predecessor
08:46
to actual coca-cola so if you've heard
08:48
that thing about coca-cola having
08:49
cocaine in it
08:50
this is where it comes from and actually
08:52
the original coca-cola
08:54
was actually a french wine as well
08:56
coca-cola started as an alcohol
08:58
but originally this started in france it
09:00
was a guy called angelo mariani
09:03
and it was so loved that the pope
09:06
not only drunk it he's he was said to
09:08
have a
09:09
flask that he carried around with him of
09:11
it all the time
09:12
and he awarded it the vatican gold medal
09:15
what
09:16
it's extraordinary and it was cocaine
09:18
what even is a vatican gold medal
09:19
i could not find any other example
09:22
he must have been high at the time he
09:24
was like give him the gold medal
09:26
so one of the one of the adverts for it
09:28
said that the pope
09:30
said that he would fortify himself with
09:31
vin mariani quotes
09:33
when prayer was insufficient
09:37
but this was it was really popular and
09:39
lots of celebrities loved this drink it
09:41
was a huge deal so queen victoria drank
09:43
it
09:43
um jules verne drank it which actually
09:45
makes a lot of sense if you read jules
09:46
verne
09:47
thomas edison drank it robert louis
09:49
stevenson ulysses s grant it was
09:52
super popular and it was one of these
09:53
things that did well through celebrity
09:55
endorsement
09:56
yeah and they gave all of their
09:57
endorsements so pope leo
09:59
literally appeared with a drawing of his
10:01
face in a newspaper
10:03
endorsing this drink h.g wells loved it
10:06
so much he personally drew two cartoon
10:08
drawings of himself
10:09
to allow for it to be used as an
10:11
endorsement yeah yeah and you're
10:12
supposed to have three glasses of it a
10:14
day
10:15
this wine and cocaine cocktail um taken
10:17
after your meals
10:18
and half for children
10:22
because you know what they're like when
10:22
they've had too much cocaine
10:26
although pope leo the 13th was not that
10:29
fun a guy
10:30
which is weird since he was the only
10:32
known drug addict pope but i was
10:34
looking into so much like i was going
10:36
through the british newspaper archive
10:37
looking for articles about him and
10:39
there was just loads of profiles on him
10:41
and they all talk about how
10:42
solitary and serious and grave he was
10:45
one newspaper said
10:46
he is a silent solitary spirit addicted
10:48
to study
10:49
and grave conversation seldom laughing a
10:52
hater of vain twaddle
10:54
so one other thing about leo the 13th he
10:57
put fig leaves on the statues at the
11:00
vatican on the naked ones
11:02
see he was such a killjoy you would have
11:04
thought if you're high on drugs
11:06
does that description of yours you know
11:08
that he was sludgy and addicted to study
11:10
does it ever say
11:11
except for certain afternoons when he
11:12
would only dance and talk about himself
11:14
yeah
11:15
it sounds like he made decisions on the
11:16
come down
11:18
right but the thing with the fig leaves
11:21
um in fairness for him he was trying to
11:23
protect them from future iconoclasts
11:26
because his previous um the previous
11:28
pope before him
11:29
who was pius ix he was even worse than
11:32
than this guy
11:32
uh and he used to destroy the nude
11:34
statues he would just completely trash
11:36
them
11:37
and so leo the 13th thought well maybe
11:40
if i put fig leaves on then no one will
11:41
trash them another thing to look behind
11:43
these fig leaves
11:45
but the problem is that a lot of the
11:47
statues that he's put fig leaves on he
11:49
stuck them on
11:50
so hard that now if you try and remove
11:52
the fig leaves you're going to take the
11:53
off
11:55
weird uh some stuff on coca-cola
11:58
yeah yeah um so what happened was um a
12:00
guy called pemberton in america um found
12:02
this
12:03
um vin mariani um he also called it a
12:05
most wonderful invigorator of the sexual
12:08
organs
12:09
and so he sold this stuff which had wine
12:11
and cocaine
12:12
but then due to prohibition um the ku
12:15
klux klan actually demanded that all
12:17
alcohol be banned from atlanta
12:19
and so they banned all alcohol from
12:20
atlanta so he had to get rid of all the
12:22
alcohol from the drink he got rid of
12:24
most of the cocaine as well
12:25
and they invented coca-cola yeah is that
12:28
a little bit of cocaine left
12:29
not now yeah it was that extraordinary
12:32
that the only reason we have coca-cola
12:34
as a soft drink was the prohibition it
12:35
goes that far
12:36
back and the syrup had to be replaced
12:38
it's you never hear that in the origin
12:40
story
12:41
what i love about it is um pemberton's
12:44
um
12:45
representatives used to hand out coupons
12:47
for free coca-cola
12:48
and so he would give you this stuff with
12:50
cocaine and say you can have this
12:52
one for free and then they come back
12:54
later and go
12:55
where was that going
12:58
coca-cola imports hundreds of millions
13:01
of dollars worth of coca leaves
13:03
which could be turned into cocaine each
13:05
year but they don't turn it into cocaine
13:07
they just extract the coca
13:08
but then there is one other company
13:10
which makes cocaine out of it
13:12
so i think it was in 2003 they imported
13:15
175
13:16
000 kilos of coker from which you can
13:19
get quite a lot of cocaine and what are
13:20
they doing with that
13:21
it's being used medicinally yeah but it
13:24
is the only
13:25
coca-cola company you know when people
13:26
say oh what's the secret ingredient in
13:28
coca-cola
13:29
it's coca leaves because they're the
13:30
only company that are allowed to use
13:32
stuff with coca leaves they've got
13:34
an exception from the government like
13:36
tens and tens of years ago
13:37
that said they could import it and so
13:40
they're the only ones who are allowed it
13:41
and they do basically make cocaine out
13:42
of it
13:43
but then they just give it to medicine
13:45
do you know i
13:46
have i was looking up kind of weird 19th
13:49
century drinks
13:50
and cocktails and stuff like that and i
13:52
ended up looking through a bunch of old
13:54
victorian books
13:55
for cocktail recipes and there is one
13:57
thing that comes up over and over again
13:59
well in fact there are two things i
14:00
thought were interesting one is that
14:01
mulled wine was made with raw eggs
14:03
so if you made mulled wine in the 19th
14:05
century you had to crack some raw eggs
14:06
into it
14:07
and then it was drunk through a straw so
14:10
for a lot of these cocktails they would
14:11
say drink this throw a straw
14:13
but in all the recipes they think they
14:14
say drink through a straw
14:16
stick macaroni or vermicelli and it
14:19
turns out
14:20
people just use like macaroni pasta or
14:22
vermicelli pasta as straws
14:24
i looked into this and that's which you
14:26
obviously should do that is amazing yeah
14:28
it's sensible isn't it yeah i mean i'll
14:30
stick with straws for now
14:31
okay it would go maybe because we want
14:33
to get rid of all the plastic straws
14:35
don't we
14:35
absolutely
14:39
that's actually big vermicelli over
14:42
there
14:45
um i have a fact about advertising
14:46
because it was about you know
14:47
advertising
14:48
uh this uh wine and cocaine the first
14:50
ever tv advert in britain was
14:52
in 1955 it was on the 22nd of september
14:56
1955 that was when itv
14:57
launched so that was the first ever
14:59
televised advertising
15:00
and on the day that that happened the
15:03
bbc
15:04
killed off grace archer who was one of
15:07
the main characters on the archers oh my
15:09
god the radio show and it was so that
15:10
they would dominate the newspaper
15:11
headlines
15:12
the next day and so that uh they would
15:15
get a bit more coverage than itv's
15:16
adverts bastards
15:18
wait so grace archer died to combat
15:20
advertising yes
15:22
no she laid down her life for a good
15:25
cause for a good cause
15:26
and the following morning bernard levin
15:28
he wrote in the guardian
15:29
newspaper uh about he's kind of reviewed
15:32
the experience of seeing adverts
15:34
and he said i feel neither depraved nor
15:36
uplifted by what i have seen
15:38
i have already forgotten the name of the
15:39
toothpaste
15:42
wow because i think that was the most
15:45
listened to radio program ever
15:46
that episode when grace archer died it's
15:48
very famous so they absolutely nailed it
15:50
anyone in here listen to it no they're
15:52
all too young yeah wait there was
15:54
there was one group and i was looking on
15:56
the internet that says that the earliest
15:58
kind of product placement was by
16:00
gladiators
16:01
in rome who would um not on itv
16:05
they um they had the massive cotton bud
16:07
contract today yeah
16:09
yeah well apparently they were selling
16:12
um olive oil and stuff like that um but
16:14
i couldn't find anything else about it
16:15
so i messaged our friend greg jenner
16:17
who's a historian who's been on the
16:18
podcast and he spoke to professor sarah
16:21
bond who's an expert in this field
16:23
and she thinks that it's not exactly the
16:25
same thing what it was is gladiators
16:26
were slaves of people
16:28
and so if your boss was an olive oil
16:31
salesman
16:32
then you would sell it because he was an
16:34
olive oil salesman so it definitely
16:35
happened that they were kind of the
16:36
product placement thing but it wasn't
16:38
their choice but did they have to
16:40
cover themselves in olive oil before
16:41
they went out for a fight i think
16:43
that would be amazing actually there is
16:45
a thing about them cover themselves and
16:47
stuff but i'll come to that later
16:50
well we we should move on in a second uh
16:53
anything before we do
16:54
my just my favorite product placement of
16:56
all time is the nbc's first
16:59
daily news program one of the first tv
17:00
news programs in the world it's called
17:02
the camel news caravan
17:04
and it was entirely sponsored by camel
17:05
cigarettes and it's the most amazing
17:07
thing you could ever watch you should
17:08
look it up
17:09
so basically the entire channel was
17:11
about promoting camel cigarettes
17:13
but it's ostensibly not that so for
17:15
instance there's a
17:16
moment where rex marshall the presenter
17:18
is doing a sports program and he
17:19
interviews this baseball team
17:21
pretty famous baseball team and he's
17:22
talking to them about how the game's
17:24
gone
17:24
the last game they played and how
17:26
they're feeling about the next game and
17:27
he asks one of them he's got like five
17:29
in the room
17:30
first of all they're all smoking camel
17:31
cigarettes the whole time and uh
17:34
he says how are you feeling about the
17:35
next game and the first player says
17:37
i feel great rex the same way i feel
17:39
about camels they taste good and they're
17:42
mild
17:43
which isn't a description of a game of
17:45
baseball
17:46
[Music]
17:47
and also if you don't know it's about
17:48
cigarettes just say just tuning in to
17:50
that channel at that moment i
17:51
the same way i feel about camels they
17:52
taste good
17:56
it's so weird though he goes around all
17:58
five like the next one is like
18:00
um are you gonna live up to your
18:01
reputation and the guy goes sure gonna
18:03
try rex
18:04
the series is something special just
18:06
like camels
18:07
and it's again very poor on the pivot
18:09
but that was the whole point of the show
18:11
yeah all right should we move on to our
18:12
next fact okay it is time for fact
18:15
number three
18:16
and that is james okay my fact this week
18:18
is that tonic's tea cakes
18:20
aren't allowed in raf planes in case
18:23
they explode
18:26
amazing what okay so first of all
18:30
does anyone not know what a tonic's tea
18:32
cake is i didn't really
18:34
i have to say um so for non-british
18:36
listeners
18:37
especially um a tonic tea cake is like a
18:40
it's a confectionary it's got a biscuit
18:41
base
18:42
then a dome of marshmallow and then it's
18:44
all covered in chocolate it's fantastic
18:46
they're really good
18:46
yeah yeah and they're made in scotland
18:48
and they're kind of a famous scottish
18:50
delicacy yeah
18:51
would you say yeah delicacy is a bit
18:54
strong really
18:57
so and this fact came from a recent
18:58
interview in a number of newspapers by
19:00
squadron leader tony clenan
19:02
and he said that he and his colleagues
19:04
were flying with tea cakes and they
19:05
realized that they'd expand
19:07
when the pressure changed and so they'd
19:09
be able to tell the altitude they were
19:11
at depending on how big their tea cakes
19:12
were
19:15
about 15 000 feet the tk would expand
19:18
sufficiently to crack the
19:19
chocolate shell is that is that useful
19:22
in a life or death situation
19:25
where you're against the luftwaffe
19:26
where's the tk yeah
19:29
well the problem was one day they were
19:31
at 40 000 feet and there was
19:33
they were doing a special kind of test
19:35
and there was a
19:36
massive change in pressure and it just
19:38
exploded and he said
19:40
chocolate and shredded marshmallow
19:41
splattered all over the windscreens
19:43
the flight instruments and the pilots
19:45
flying suits this rather distracted the
19:47
pilots from the immediate emergency
19:49
actions they were supposed to take
19:51
uh thereafter marshmallows were banned
19:54
all right
19:55
so you can't take them up anymore no i
19:57
like that the pilots had it with them
19:59
like that suggested it was a snack
20:01
waiting for them to eat as well yeah why
20:03
would you keep it in the cockpit why not
20:04
do the experiments
20:06
in the back yeah these weren't
20:07
experiments it just so happened that
20:08
that would
20:09
you know they just like tea cakes right
20:12
and they just realized that this was
20:13
happening and thought oh yeah let's
20:14
you know let's keep taking them up
20:16
that's kind of fun it's really sweet and
20:17
it's basically because there's air
20:18
inside the marshmallow
20:20
has got loads and loads of air in it and
20:21
the change in pressure just makes it
20:23
expand
20:24
yeah um tanuks actually responded to
20:26
this when the after the interview
20:27
happened
20:27
uh a tonic spokesman said i'm quoting
20:29
exactly here
20:30
it never ceases to amaze us what people
20:32
get up to with our products
20:34
[Laughter]
20:37
they but they said it never seems to
20:38
amaze us what people get up to with our
20:40
products
20:40
we find this example highly amusing
20:44
which doesn't apply there are a lot of
20:45
other examples yeah we find this example
20:48
disgusting
20:48
[Laughter]
20:52
i like the sound of uh tonics the uh the
20:54
current boyd
20:55
tonic uh he's called and um weird
20:58
coincidence actually isn't it
21:00
no he's yeah he's the great grandson of
21:02
the tonic's inventor isn't it he is yeah
21:04
but he also has invented
21:06
uh new tonic products um
21:09
but what i like about him is he has this
21:11
notebook that he carries around he's so
21:12
invested in his company so
21:14
he carries a notebook around he keeps
21:16
all the sales but he also
21:18
is said it's not been confirmed but it
21:19
said that he has a circle
21:21
inside the notebook which should be what
21:23
the size of
21:24
a tonic's tea cake is so whenever he
21:27
sees one he goes is that
21:28
very nice it fits the circle he measures
21:31
them on his notebook yeah just out of
21:33
habit he just wants to make sure they're
21:35
all
21:35
the right size wow and actually they
21:37
were good on advertising
21:39
they were one of the early kind of
21:40
billboard makers and this is a guy
21:42
called john tonic in the 1850s
21:44
who was a coffin maker and he used to
21:46
put big adverts up all over the road
21:48
saying
21:49
why liv why live a miserable life when
21:51
for 30 bob you can be buried comfortably
21:56
which is so weird because i don't
21:57
understand how being buried comfortably
21:59
is going to make you not live a
22:00
miserable life
22:02
something to look forward to
22:05
marshmallows guess what gladiators used
22:08
to cover themselves in
22:12
oil olive oil marshmallows guys
22:16
no they did they um they would rub
22:17
themselves in marshmallows with a sap of
22:19
the marshmallow plant
22:21
and they thought it would reduce
22:22
inflammation and irritation of the skin
22:24
and also it would give the machine and
22:25
maybe get make them more hard to grab
22:27
hold of
22:28
it's very funny it's very sweet the idea
22:29
that you need to reduce inflammation and
22:31
irritation of the skin if you've got a
22:32
spear
22:33
inside you don't you worry i've got
22:35
something that'll help that
22:38
so the stuff that we get now is kind of
22:40
fake marshmallow isn't it it's made out
22:42
of sugar and stuff like that but you
22:43
used to have sweets made out of actual
22:45
marshmallow the plant
22:46
which grows i think in swamps and
22:48
marshes and stuff like that um
22:49
and in egypt it was reserved for gods
22:52
and royalty
22:53
they were the only ones who are allowed
22:54
to eat marshmallows wow that's good
22:56
isn't it
22:57
hey um i was looking into other things
22:59
that have been banned
23:00
by raf planes oh yeah yeah so you've got
23:03
tonix tea cakes banned by raf planes
23:06
another thing banned philip hammond
23:10
because he expands doesn't he when he
23:11
gets to a certain altitude
23:13
is are we talking about the chancellor
23:15
of the adventure yeah
23:16
he um i this may have been resolved but
23:18
i couldn't find information to say it
23:20
has been but only a few years ago
23:22
he had taken so many flights and not
23:24
paid for them that they've now said
23:25
you're not getting on any more flights
23:27
you've not paid for a single ticket
23:28
prime minister has done it and anyone
23:30
else who has done it they've paid their
23:31
bills but he owes them a huge amount of
23:33
money because he takes he uses their
23:34
services
23:35
so the mod said you tonight's cakes get
23:38
out
23:38
wow yeah if only he had access to a
23:40
massive amount of money that he could
23:42
pay the bills
23:44
i was looking up other things that
23:46
expand in planes okay and
23:48
i mean everything expands in a plane but
23:50
specifically you expand in a plane
23:52
specifically even more so all the gas in
23:55
your gut
23:55
it gets a third bigger than normal so if
23:57
you have ever found yourself
23:59
farting lots on a plane that's the
24:02
reason yeah it was another
24:03
um a plane that got grounded quite
24:05
recently because someone wouldn't stop
24:06
farting
24:07
i think there was it wasn't there it was
24:09
creating such a terrific smell for all
24:11
the other passengers look i apologized
24:13
to the cabinetry
24:15
it's just physics guys there was also a
24:18
plane that was i had to turn around and
24:20
go back to
24:21
uh where it took off from because the
24:22
toilets were broken
24:24
uh but what was amazing about it was on
24:26
board were 80 plumbers who were on their
24:27
way to a convention
24:30
they were unable to do
24:33
[Laughter]
24:39
just very quickly um another thing
24:41
that's banned on airplanes smoking
24:43
obviously banned
24:44
interestingly do you know what is
24:46
essential for every airplane when it
24:48
goes up
24:49
uh an engine uh oh yeah sorry let's
24:52
let's uh those little moist town hacks
24:56
let me hone this list in a bit um
24:58
smoking is banned but
24:59
ashtrays are essential oh why
25:02
the reason is is because even though
25:04
they've told people don't smoke
25:06
um please don't smoke you'll be in
25:07
trouble you'll be arrested and so on
25:09
they still think people are gonna have a
25:10
cheeky smoke that's that's their theory
25:13
so toilets in airplanes still need to
25:16
have an ashtray
25:17
because if someone gets caught and puts
25:19
it out it's better than them not having
25:21
somewhere to put it out
25:22
and so as a result it's an essential
25:25
british airlines have had planes that
25:26
have not been allowed to take off
25:28
because their new planes have not had
25:29
ash trays in them and they've had to be
25:31
fitted it's in america have a
25:33
england habit yeah it's an essential
25:35
thing which is insane because you can
25:36
put out a cigarette on anything
25:38
uh it doesn't make any sense you can
25:40
just drop it in your beer
25:41
that you've ordered for 20 pounds on
25:43
your warranty
25:46
okay it's time for our final fact of the
25:48
show and that is
25:49
andy my fact is that when louis xiv the
25:53
french king
25:53
needed an operation his doctor was so
25:56
nervous that he practiced it on
25:58
75 people beforehand many of whom
26:02
did not have the condition the operation
26:03
was meant to cure
26:06
so um so louis xiv ruled until
26:09
1715 i think that's when he died and he
26:12
had a very
26:13
painful medical condition called a
26:14
fistula an anal fistula which is kind of
26:17
a gap
26:17
uh that opens up in the body as quite
26:20
painful it's quite embarrassing
26:21
and the the king had one so his
26:25
surgeon uh charles francois felix he
26:28
was incredibly nervous because at this
26:30
time uh being a surgeon
26:32
was a part-time job with being a barber
26:34
and being a wig maker
26:35
so surgery wasn't very advanced
26:38
no and it's like the people who make
26:41
keys
26:42
and fix your shoes exactly yes
26:45
in 300 years we won't believe that those
26:47
two were ever combined
26:50
because the art of key making will have
26:51
been so improved
26:53
but just like key making surgery was in
26:55
his infancy um and
26:57
the surgeon he he borrowed 75 people we
27:00
only know because he wrote a long
27:01
account of it the king's official
27:02
doctors
27:03
who would prescribe you medicine were
27:05
very sniffy about surgery as everyone
27:07
was in that century they thought it was
27:08
like basically bloodletting and nothing
27:10
else
27:10
and so he borrowed 75 people he said you
27:13
need this operation but give me six
27:15
months
27:15
and 75 people to practice on and he
27:18
practiced and practiced and practiced
27:19
until he got it right
27:20
yeah and actually he didn't really want
27:23
to go through with it right because
27:24
it's a really painful procedure a lot of
27:27
people died having it
27:28
and he really wanted to try and find a
27:31
different way of doing it so before he
27:32
even practiced on these 75 people
27:34
he found another load of people and
27:36
tried loads of different cures on them
27:38
just like giving them drinks and you
27:40
know giving them poultices and stuff
27:41
like that and just saying does that work
27:43
no does that work but then a lot of them
27:45
didn't have it so i don't know how he
27:46
could tell
27:47
yeah yeah yeah he wanted louis himself
27:49
wanted to bathe in special mineral water
27:51
didn't he
27:51
rather than have the anal surgery which
27:53
you can totally understand that being
27:55
your preference yeah
27:56
he probably said no to that because
27:58
famously louis xiv
27:59
never bathed he bathed uh only two times
28:03
in his life
28:04
as far as he could remember obviously
28:05
childhood is out but as an adult he
28:07
bathed two times
28:08
and he stunk really really badly a uh a
28:12
russian ambassador to france said that
28:14
he's stunk like a wild animal
28:16
and he was clearly so aware of how much
28:18
he stunk that when he was in a room
28:20
he would open the windows and be like
28:21
sorry about this
28:23
however with the procedure he might have
28:25
been up for it because he was very into
28:27
enemas he loved an enema he had about 2
28:29
000 enemas in his lifetime
28:31
2 000's a lot that's too many yeah i
28:34
think one's too many i'll be
28:35
honest but when the king had this
28:38
operation um it was really secret that
28:40
it was happening
28:41
so the only people who knew about it
28:44
were the king
28:45
the surgeon his doctors his war minister
28:48
corporal um his confessor and
28:51
his new secret wife who he never
28:54
acknowledged at court because she was
28:55
a commoner so he didn't want anyone to
28:57
know about her and new secret
28:59
it's a good way to test the relationship
29:01
early on i think you know if
29:03
if you get through that and still fancy
29:04
them i think you can probably survive
29:06
anything
29:06
it's true and it was a success it was a
29:08
success all
29:09
the four doctors arrived for the
29:11
procedure through different doors to
29:13
keep it a secret
29:14
the king's the how does that keep it a
29:16
secret well
29:17
i guess you think i've just seen one
29:19
doctor come in today and not four
29:20
doctors arrived at the same time the
29:21
king must be
29:22
in big trouble and then the war minister
29:24
held the king's hand throughout the
29:26
procedure which took ours
29:27
not the wife interestingly imagine
29:30
having
29:31
you know gavin williamson mp holding
29:33
your hand
29:36
and then when it was a success everyone
29:38
was very happy because they did tell
29:39
they told everyone about it didn't they
29:41
and then suddenly all the french people
29:43
decided that they wanted to have the
29:45
same operation
29:46
it became extremely fashionable to have
29:49
your anus lanced
29:50
yeah and doctors used to get really
29:52
annoyed because
29:53
people would come and say i'm pretty
29:55
sure i've got an anal fistula when they
29:56
had just like a blister on their face or
29:58
something and there's a doctor who say
29:59
no you don't and they say no i'm pretty
30:00
sure it's an anal fistula
30:02
can i have the king thing and yeah and
30:05
also he had bandages
30:06
around his backside because he had this
30:08
done it became really fashionable for
30:10
people to walk around with bandages
30:11
around the bum
30:12
yeah to pretend that they'd have the
30:14
operation yeah
30:15
that's extraordinary isn't it it's kind
30:17
of it makes a little more sense in the
30:19
context of the life of the french king
30:21
because for example
30:22
all the king's poos were documented
30:25
one of them all the king's horses all
30:27
the kings
30:29
yeah not just the notable ones well
30:33
you know one of the things is right
30:36
basically louis the 14th we talked about
30:37
this before he wanted his whole life to
30:39
be on display
30:40
right and it was not just his what life
30:42
it was everyone in his court
30:44
everyone's life had to be completely
30:45
open and one of the reasons they think
30:47
is because
30:48
if everyone knew what everyone else was
30:50
doing all the time it would be
30:51
impossible for people to go behind his
30:53
back and um plot against him yeah that's
30:55
one thing but he had
30:56
and he did he really wanted to be able
30:58
to control his courtiers and his nobles
31:00
because everyone was always rebelling
31:01
against the king in those days but
31:02
he had really strict rules in versailles
31:05
about how
31:06
everyone else there was supposed to act
31:08
so he literally had rules about
31:10
where certain nobles could stand in a
31:12
room and everyone had their own chair
31:13
and they weren't allowed to sit in
31:15
another chair
31:16
and they had to enter a leave in a
31:17
certain way and um he also had this rule
31:20
that you had to
31:21
move between wings of first sight which
31:23
was this huge palace you'd move between
31:25
the wings in a sedan chair
31:26
and only the royal family like his
31:29
siblings or his children
31:30
had their own sedan chair and then the
31:32
other people in the palace the nobles
31:33
would have to hail one down
31:35
so you just you had people walking
31:37
around with sedan chairs and you just
31:38
have to put your thumb out and be like
31:40
i've got to get to the west wing now
31:42
and that's amazing you had to flag them
31:44
down and like you had to pay a fare so
31:46
versailles was so huge that you got to
31:48
the gate but the cost of getting on
31:50
sedan chair from the gate to the palace
31:52
door
31:53
was six sue which was the currency at
31:55
the time so he had to
31:56
is this and this is inside the palace
31:58
inside the palace yeah that's incredible
32:00
flag down the street i should have
32:02
invented a new system where you could
32:04
you know just have one come to you by
32:05
pressing a little thing on the wall
32:07
so he says he's five minutes away but i
32:09
can't see him
32:09
[Laughter]
32:11
one of the most famous super that's what
32:14
it should have been called
32:15
sorry
32:19
one of the most famous facts that i
32:20
think we all know and if you watch qr
32:22
you would know this
32:23
um is to do with this anal fistula thing
32:25
and that is that once the
32:27
um the uh operation was a success
32:29
everyone was celebrating
32:31
and john baptiste lully who is a french
32:33
court composer
32:34
had a big sort of opera but during the
32:36
performance
32:37
he stabbed himself in the foot with his
32:39
baton and he went gangrenous and he died
32:43
and it's famous as one of those stupid
32:45
deaths you know where the
32:46
composer whacks himself in the what
32:48
a way to go at least it was a
32:49
incredibly important epochal piece of
32:51
music but i don't know
32:52
sorry no it was the fistula performance
32:55
hey just speaking of music very quickly
32:57
there was a book that was published in
32:59
1938 called the oxford companion to
33:01
music it was by
33:02
uh percy scholes um in it he discusses
33:06
god save the queen god save the king and
33:08
uh
33:09
the british national anthem he puts
33:11
forward the ideas
33:12
of how it came about because no one's
33:14
completely sure for certain
33:16
who wrote it when it was written um they
33:19
think there was origin stories of how it
33:20
sort of
33:21
was taken from handle music and so on
33:23
there was a lot of story going on
33:24
in this book he puts forward the theory
33:26
as well that
33:28
it was actually and this is a french
33:29
theory that the song was composed in
33:32
gratitude for the survival of louis xiv
33:35
anal fistula is that amazing
33:38
yeah so possibly when we stand up to
33:41
sing the national anthem
33:42
it's because of his anus that's why we
33:46
stand up
33:46
[Laughter]
33:50
do you know my favorite fistula
33:54
we've all got one in history i think so
33:57
there's a long list but i think top spot
33:59
is officially from 1822.
34:01
and this is a really important thing in
34:02
medical history so
34:04
a guy called alexis sam mata was shot in
34:07
michigan through the stomach it was an
34:08
accidental hunting accident
34:09
but he was shot incredibly badly um so
34:12
his sort of whole insides exploded his
34:14
lungs were hanging out of his body
34:15
um someone reported that when he ate
34:17
food fell straight out of his stomach
34:19
again like he was really in a bad way
34:21
everyone thought he was going to die
34:23
he didn't but what did happen that was
34:25
quite weird he'd been shot in the kind
34:26
of stomach area
34:27
his stomach healed by like
34:31
healing itself onto his external skin so
34:34
this is what a fistula is it's a kind of
34:35
unnatural and painful connection between
34:37
two organs that shouldn't be connected
34:39
isn't it and so he had a permanent
34:41
window to his stomach
34:42
he would walk around and you could just
34:44
see his stomach completely exposed
34:46
and a doctor called william beaumont
34:48
thought well this is ideal for me to
34:50
experiment on
34:51
and he made enormous leaps in our
34:54
understanding of digestion and
34:55
how foods are processed in our body by
34:58
adopting this guy basically
35:00
and testing out his stomach but he did
35:01
some really weird stuff
35:03
so for instance his stomach was
35:04
literally on display
35:06
and he did things like um he would he
35:09
would lick this guy's empty stomach
35:11
to taste if there was any acid in it to
35:14
see if
35:15
you produced acid when you weren't
35:16
eating he did that he would put
35:19
food he would put food on a spoon and
35:21
then insert it just into this guy's
35:23
stomach and then and then he'd leave it
35:25
there for a bit and then he'd monitor
35:26
how long it took to break down
35:28
and then he'd tie a string to it and
35:30
then he'd pull it out at certain
35:32
intervals
35:32
did he have he had permission to do this
35:34
did he i think the guy came to resent
35:36
him they fell out in the end
35:41
that'd be terrible imagine people could
35:43
see what you had eaten like your mum
35:44
gives you
35:45
some biscuits says i'll eat these
35:46
biscuits i made them and then she asked
35:48
you later did you eat those biscuits and
35:49
you say yeah of course i ate the
35:50
biscuits at the moment then she says
35:51
you lie i can sleep your stomach it's a
35:55
probably a rare problem
35:58
what a weird window into your life we
36:00
just had
36:03
was more upsetting than the window into
36:04
this guy's stomach
36:08
all right let's wrap up okay that is it

afterwards to claim your prize but it's
36:52
hannah watson
36:53
hannah watson here hannah hannah right
36:56
this is this is the fact
36:57
in 2004 a boat capsized in texas
37:00
because all people on board ran to one
37:03
side to get a glimpse of a nudist beach
37:05
they were passing
37:08
all 60 passengers ended up in the water
37:13
that's amazing oh yeah come to the back
37:15
we'll have the
37:16
cassette there as i said earlier we're
37:17

00:04
[Music]
00:11
hello
00:12
and welcome to another episode of no
00:15
such thing as a fish
00:17
a weekly podcast this week coming to you
00:20
from edinburgh
00:27
my name is dan schreiber and i am
00:29
sitting here with
00:30
anna chazinski andrew hunter murray and
00:33
james harkin and
00:34
once again we have gathered around the
00:35
microphones with our four favorite facts
00:37
from the last seven days and in no
00:39
particular order
00:40
here we go starting with fact number one
00:44
and that's my fact this week my fact is
00:47
unmarried people are more likely to fall
00:49
downstairs
00:50
than married people
00:53
and previously married people fall down
00:56
more than both of them
01:00
it does it's not just because it they're
01:02
like it's my phone my phone's ringing my
01:04
phone's ringing get it because
01:05
you know you're single you're kind of
01:07
you know yeah you're ready for the fact
01:08
i don't think we know why do we we don't
01:10
so i read this i read this in a bill
01:12
bryson book called at home which is a
01:14
fantastic book
01:15
and he references in the chapter which
01:18
he writes about stairs that
01:19
he read this one book the only book that
01:22
is a sort of
01:22
academic look at staircases and it's by
01:26
john templer of mit it's called the
01:28
staircase studies of hazards fall
01:30
and safe designs yeah and i have also
01:33
read this book
01:34
there it is that's it
01:35
[Applause]
01:38
it is the first theoretical historical
01:41
and scientific analysis of the stare
01:43
according to the blurb um it is pretty
01:46
hard-going
01:49
and actually that was a little joke for
01:51
you staircase enthusiasts out there
01:53
because the going
01:55
is the width of a stair
01:59
and all of my humor will be staircase
02:01
based for the rest of this show
02:04
john temple is at home pissing himself
02:08
i mean there's diagrams there's you know
02:11
loads of tables and stuff like this
02:13
tables
02:14
what are the tables
02:18
there's like about three or four good
02:20
facts in the first four pages and then
02:22
the rest of it is just
02:23
unbelievably tedious did he lead with
02:26
the the unmarried and married yeah it's
02:27
right near the start another thing he
02:29
says is that notable missteps happen
02:31
once every 2
02:32
22 stair uses
02:36
minor accidents happen every sixty three
02:38
thousand uses
02:39
disabling accidents every seven hundred
02:41
and thirty four thousand two hundred and
02:43
ten uses
02:44
hospital treatments every three million
02:46
six hundred and sixteen thousand six
02:48
hundred
02:49
sixty 667 uses and deaths every 513
02:53
million
02:54
947 300 uses
02:57
wow and that was one of the least boring
02:59
sentences
03:02
do you know why all these accidents have
03:03
no why according to him it's because
03:05
every staircase is a compromise
03:09
between between going up and going down
03:12
right
03:12
yeah so you can have staircases which
03:16
just for people going up can't you oh no
03:18
that would be
03:19
that would be decadent wouldn't it yeah
03:23
his point being that how would you get
03:25
down again as well think of that i'd
03:26
have two in my house
03:30
i would
03:35
wait sorry what do you mean by a
03:36
compromise who's who's compromising with
03:38
whom who's negotiating
03:40
the perfect staircase would be a
03:42
staircase that would be able to adapt
03:44
itself to whether or not you were going
03:45
up or down
03:46
for the length and the height and and so
03:48
on
03:49
they're built in one way which uh plays
03:51
advantage to either going up or going
03:53
down
03:53
very different skills going up and down
03:55
a staircase
03:57
and actually in this book there are
03:59
figures about how
04:00
a staircase was if you're going up or
04:02
down
04:03
so if you're going up there's a
04:04
different wearing out of the stair than
04:06
if you're going down
04:07
but you would have thought the wearing
04:09
would be the same on all staircases
04:11
unless you've just got a huge stockpile
04:14
of ten thousand people at the top of the
04:15
stairs at some point
04:16
at some point everyone who goes upstairs
04:18
does come down to the same thing there's
04:19
a few like for instance if you've got
04:21
stairs
04:22
coming up at a dock say for instance
04:24
people might use it for getting off the
04:26
boat but to get on the boat they might
04:27
use the pier
04:28
so there's a few little things like that
04:30
it's very interesting actually
04:31
and that is that that's the origin of
04:33
that saying isn't it what goes up
04:35
stairs must come down stairs
04:39
um women fall downstairs more often than
04:41
men or admit to falling downstairs more
04:43
often than men
04:44
so 38 of women uh compared to 28
04:47
of men said they'd fallen downstairs or
04:49
upstairs or tripped on stairs in the
04:50
last year
04:51
and also weirdly this was a study that
04:53
was done by the british woodworking
04:54
federation who
04:56
are relied on for all rigorous
04:57
scientific studies and
04:59
their study also found that the north
05:02
east
05:02
of england so it was a study that
05:04
discovered england the north east is the
05:06
most at risk of falling downstairs
05:08
so 48 percent of people there said
05:10
they'd done it in the last year
05:11
whereas yorkshire and humber directly
05:13
next to the northeast region
05:15
had the least incidences 26 what's going
05:18
on there
05:19
it doesn't make any sense i saw a really
05:22
cool invention the other day because a
05:23
lot of people are trying to
05:24
um work out how to stop people if they
05:27
do fall over from properly hurting
05:28
themselves
05:29
so there's this new invention that
05:30
they're trialing at the moment which is
05:31
like a um
05:32
a big belt that you wear and it senses
05:36
that you you're falling over it's a it's
05:38
a sort of like this is a movement that's
05:40
not being expected
05:41
i've gone as a belt i've gone over that
05:43
way and
05:44
what it does is it inflates these
05:45
massive air bags
05:48
speaking of stair-based inventions yeah
05:49
that sounds awesome there are scientists
05:51
at georgia
05:52
tech who have invented some stairs which
05:54
walk you
05:55
back well that doesn't make any sense
05:57
well i understood all those words
05:59
but well i i've tried to i've tried to
06:02
sex it up a bit and i don't think it's
06:03
succeeded basically they're stairs which
06:07
as you walk on them they
06:08
store your energy and then when you walk
06:10
the other way
06:11
so when they when you walk down the
06:13
gravitational force of you descending
06:15
stores energy in the stair and then when
06:16
you walk back out
06:18
brings you up
06:22
[Laughter]
06:25
and it's when you go back up it's 37
06:27
easier on your knee
06:28
than it would be normally so that that
06:30
could be huge yeah
06:32
and there are shoes that have just been
06:33
invented to stop people from falling
06:35
over
06:36
which i think sound a bit less dramatic
06:38
and embarrassing than the air bag
06:39
solution because
06:40
they're just shoes with a battery on
06:43
the back of them and a sensor and they
06:45
sense when you're starting to
06:47
have your body weight in the wrong
06:48
position and they automatically start a
06:50
little motor that slides the shoes
06:52
backwards
06:52
so it stops you falling over backwards
06:54
like you're moonwalking wow
06:56
exactly like moonwalking but only if the
06:58
option is falling over
06:59
that's amazing and the person who
07:00
invented them said it's great because
07:02
it's not as noticeable as having a stick
07:04
or a zimmer frame which some people
07:06
don't want to have because it makes them
07:08
feel like they've lost some ability
07:09
and they just like look like completely
07:11
normal shoes which i watched the video
07:13
and they've got a large motor on the
07:14
back of each shoe
07:18
can i just ask about the staircase
07:20
giving you the lift again so presumably
07:22
if you were walking down
07:23
it matches your body weight and type
07:26
for the spring it gives you on the way
07:28
back up right so if i go down the
07:30
staircase but then my
07:31
son walks up it is he not going to be
07:35
lobbed because in 1948 an elephant
07:39
climbed up the stairs at the eiffel
07:40
tower
07:41
no and then climbed back down again so
07:43
imagine that are you serious really yeah
07:45
wow wow that used to be a thing that
07:47
people did in the eiffel tower they used
07:48
to just
07:49
climb up the stairs in funny ways there
07:52
was a guy who did it in stilts
07:54
quite famously a baker and then when
07:56
hitler took over paris
07:58
in the war um suddenly all of the lifts
08:01
stopped working
08:02
and he they said oh no you're gonna have
08:03
to walk up the stairs now and he was
08:05
like oh i'm not
08:06
i'm not gonna do it then they were
08:07
jeopardized weren't they the resistance
08:09
cut all the lift cables in the eiffel
08:11
tower and there's someone who admitted
08:12
to it in the end he wrote a book and
08:14
said
08:14
it was me i cut the cables in the eiffel
08:16
tower to make the nazis look like idiots
08:17
at the time they just said oh no it's
08:19
just not working yeah and then the day
08:20
after he left they're like oh it's
08:22
working again
08:25
jeremy corbyn can climb four flights of
08:27
stairs faster than anyone else in the
08:28
labour party
08:34
that's not true prove me wrong
08:40
the fact that the labour party is
08:41
wasting time figuring this out doesn't
08:43
go a long way to explain
08:44
why are you saying that i don't
08:45
understand is it a race they do
08:46
something he's not saying it it's
08:47
according to his deputy tom watson
08:50
he just said he can come tom watson
08:51
can't do it that fast can he
08:53
no but he he didn't say just he didn't
08:55
say it was just faster than me tom
08:56
watson he said anyone else i think in
08:57
the parliamentary party not the
08:59
500 000 strong membership but maybe
09:03
anyway do you know the most um
09:07
number of stairs climbed on your head
09:10
what oh so you're on your head you're
09:12
like doing a headstand
09:13
yeah and then you have to bounce up onto
09:15
the next step and you keep going up and
09:17
how many can you do in a row what's the
09:18
world record
09:19
15 15 6. it's 36.
09:24
um do you know what the most stairs
09:26
tumbled down in a stunt fall is
09:28
oh cool it's more or less than 36.
09:32
i'll say less no you were wrong to say
09:34
that it was 134.
09:37
yeah do you know what the most
09:38
consecutive stairs climbed while
09:40
juggling the football is oh jesus no
09:42
are we to the part of the book where it
09:44
stopped being interesting now
09:48
it's six hundred 4 ninety eight sorry
09:50
that was
09:51
the climbing stairs juggling a football
09:53
but it's a bit of a cheat because he
09:54
just went up the same 18 stairs
09:56
yeah lots of times wait juggling a
09:58
football yeah you know with your feet
09:59
like kick keep your balls sorry i
10:01
thought he was juggling one football
10:03
with his hands
10:05
i think i could do that i don't think
10:08
you could
10:08
i don't think you could go up 4 600
10:10
steps no matter what the football's
10:12
doing
10:14
uh and one more most consecutive stairs
10:16
climbed while balancing a person on your
10:18
head
10:19
ah so you're walking up yeah and it's
10:21
like as if there's a mirror on your head
10:23
because there's another person directly
10:25
above you
10:26
are they standing on their head on your
10:28
head their head is on your head and
10:29
they're upside down
10:30
all right what's the number 90. it's
10:34
impressive 90
10:35
yeah yeah more than the guy who just did
10:37
it on his head
10:38
wow i would say that is much easier
10:41
they're still doing it on their feet
10:43
he has a man upside down
10:46
on his head
10:50
well these because do you guys know
10:51
about competitive stair climbing
10:54
which is this is a really a growing
10:57
sport so
10:58
it's like an official sport there's this
11:00
global circuit of competitive stair
11:02
climbers
11:02
they call themselves the most difficult
11:04
sport that no one's ever heard of
11:06
and it's basically they have these
11:08
events all over the world where they
11:09
race up really tall buildings so the
11:11
three main races
11:12
are in the us they're the empire state
11:14
building seers tower and u.s bank tower
11:16
and they have this the big facebook
11:18
group and they call each other step
11:20
brothers and step sisters
11:21
which is real clever but they take it
11:24
super seriously
11:25
so like the men shaved their legs and
11:27
shave their heads so they're more
11:28
streamlined going up the stairs
11:30
they wear gloves that can't make up much
11:32
of a difference so can it
11:33
because you're in a you're in a
11:34
stairwell there's not going to be that
11:35
much air resistance
11:37
yeah it's still there isn't that it's
11:39
still there yeah although one thing they
11:41
say is that the air and stairwells is
11:42
actually quite bad so you get this
11:44
really bad smoker's hacking cough as
11:46
you're going up because the air is
11:47
really dry
11:48
so they recommend that you suck on a
11:49
throat sweet or a lozenge as you're
11:51
running up which i would have thought is
11:52
a massive choking hazard as you're
11:53
sprinting upstairs
11:57
you must be absolutely exhausted by the
11:58
time you get to the top it's really it's
12:00
true a lot of sports though actually
12:01
yeah
12:02
like but then and
12:05
then at the end of this you've got to
12:06
climb on top of another set of stairs to
12:09
the podium
12:10
yeah do you think some people
12:13
kind of cheat and at the end they
12:15
pretend they've come second and then
12:16
they race to the top one of the podium
12:17
at the last minute
12:21
um we should we need to move on to our
12:23
next fact very soon
12:24
you guys got anything before we do this
12:25
is massively off topic yeah
12:27
just i was reading about going upstairs
12:29
two at a time and there's a guardian
12:30
that's quite on topic
12:31
actually just you wait
12:32
[Laughter]
12:35
there's a guardian notes and queries you
12:37
know where they get questions from the
12:38
public
12:38
and they're really interesting questions
12:39
and one of them was is taking the stairs
12:41
two at a time good for us
12:42
and i looked up a few other notes and
12:44
queries things um
12:45
one of them is is it actually possible
12:48
to take a photograph of a river
12:50
because it moves so you know what have
12:51
you photographed right
12:53
that's good that's genius it's genius
12:55
that's not genius
12:57
that bit of order is never there again
13:00
but that's true of
13:01
time like if i take a photo of you now
13:03
then time has moved on and you're going
13:05
to be older than you were one of the
13:06

13:43
all right let's move on to our next fact
13:45
okay it is time for fact number two and
13:47
that is
13:48
james okay my fact this week is that
13:50
there's a tanning salon
13:51
in saint andrews called sun tan drews
14:01
now don't get too excited guys
14:04
because when i say verse it's t-h-e-r-e
14:08
apostrophe s
14:09
and it's short for there was because i
14:13
checked google
14:14
earth today and it's not there anymore
14:16
wow it's now a tanning salon called
14:19
abba tatan what i don't get it
14:23
a beta tan a better tan oh we're better
14:27
yeah better tan actually it's still not
14:29
great though is it
14:30
no it's no it's no suntan drews no which
14:33
is genius
14:33
it is and but this is just the fact this
14:35
was told to me um by
14:37
our colleague anne miller who used to
14:38
live up here i used to live in saint
14:40
andrews
14:40
and i just think it's awesome and i
14:42
thought we could talk about maybe
14:43
suntans and
14:44
and tanning salons like that we should
14:46
although i think we should say for anne
14:47
miller's sake that
14:48
i don't think she's ever been in a
14:49
tanning salon i don't want people to get
14:51
the impression that she was on the
14:52
sunbed every day
14:54
she's just got an eye for a pun hasn't
14:56
she she's got an eye for a pun
14:57
she's been in the punning salon yeah
14:59
yeah there's a cool pun one in edinburgh
15:02
and maybe you guys will know if this
15:03
still exists but um
15:04
so there's a property shop and it's
15:06
called the property shop and right next
15:08
to it someone set up a cafe called the
15:10
proper
15:11
tea shop and so that just so it's the
15:14
same company it's in stockbridge isn't
15:15
it
15:16
it's the same so though it was an estate
15:18
agents and it was a
15:20
the same guy said let's have a couple
15:21
really that's half of our thing okay
15:24
cool on suntans i i found out that
15:27
so obviously getting a suntan is bad for
15:29
you lots of ways
15:30
and there's no way of getting a town
15:32
without doing damage to the skin as in
15:33
the protection that you get in future
15:35
is the damage that you do except that
15:38
there is a team at massachusetts general
15:40
hospital and they have invented a drug
15:42
which you can take which will give you a
15:44
suntan
15:44
with no sun wow this is
15:47
amazing it produces melanin which is the
15:49
thing that protects you from skin cancer
15:51
and it could provide the elixir of
15:54
tanning
15:56
a redhead tan oh
15:59
yeah you could have um because people
16:01
with red hair they have a genetic
16:02
mutation which disrupts the process and
16:04
makes it very hard for people with red
16:05
hair to tan
16:06
this could create the holy grail
16:08
[Laughter]
16:12
that's very cool do you know because it
16:14
is bad for you and there's been a lot of
16:15
publicity
16:16
now recently about it you have to get
16:18
your fingerprints checked and a lot of
16:20
tanning sounds so like the tanning salon
16:22
the tanning shop uh which has a lot of
16:23
branches over the uk
16:25
you're fingerprinted and if you've come
16:26
in again before that day they didn't let
16:28
you in
16:29
oh really wow yeah tanning someone's in
16:32
airports
16:33
but actually people didn't really care
16:34
about um like suntans did they for ages
16:37
and ages and ages because
16:38
basically having a suntan meant that you
16:40
were poor and you worked outside
16:42
you were a labourer and so it was always
16:44
thought that if you had light skin it
16:46
was better
16:47
but then coco chanel accidentally got
16:49
tanned when she went on a mediterranean
16:51
cruise in 1923
16:53
and suddenly always everyone thought
16:54
this is the thing that we all need to
16:56
have now
16:56
which is quite a relatively new thing
16:59
yeah you know when suntan's got popular
17:01
uh after the coco chanel incident
17:02
then obviously a lot of uh kind of
17:04
merchandise
17:06
popped up around them and popular
17:08
science wrote an article about all the
17:10
weird sun tanning technologies that have
17:11
been invented since kind of 1920s 1930s
17:14
and there was some crazy stuff people
17:15
were doing so in 1938 uh
17:18
it wrote about a rotating sun tub
17:21
which is basically a tent that you
17:22
brought to the beach and it had like
17:24
huge
17:24
wooden kind of structure that you had to
17:27
bring to the beach and you erected it
17:28
and it followed the sun's movement so
17:30
you lay inside it and you had a little
17:31
steering wheel
17:32
and so you could steer the tent to point
17:35
you towards the side
17:36
and that's a really good idea incredible
17:39
yeah
17:39
so you're you're in the wooden structure
17:42
yeah but there's a gap
17:43
of sunlight for your body exactly are
17:45
you kind of steering it towards the sun
17:47
or does it do it automatically
17:48
you have to steer uh but you've got to
17:51
do something
17:52
otherwise it's just boring fair enough
17:54
um you can get bacon
17:56
smelling sunscreen why would you want
17:58
that well because lots of people like
18:00
bacon
18:00
yeah um according to the website of this
18:03
thing
18:04
science has shown us that 10 out of 10
18:06
people prefer the smell of bacon to
18:08
coconut
18:09
sorry can't argue with science andy
18:15
10 out of 10 including vegetarians and
18:18
vegans
18:18
the smell the smell of bacon is this
18:20
another study done by one of jeremy
18:22
corbyn's cabinet
18:24
very questionable last year kfc sold
18:27
sunscreen which smelled of kfc
18:30
um it would protect your skin while the
18:32
real fried chicken scent
18:34
leaves you smelling delicious
18:37
they had 3 000 tubes and everyone was
18:40
disappointed because they sold out in
18:41
two
18:42
hours but luckily they learned the
18:44
lesson and that was the last time kfc
18:46
ever run out of anything ever again
18:48
[Laughter]
18:52
i've got a speaking of artificial
18:54
tanning sometimes people can overdo it
18:56
and i just wanted to share this headline
18:58
from the mail um a young mother claims
19:01
she was housebound for a week after a
19:02
fake tan
19:03
fail left her looking like she'd bathed
19:05
in chocolate spread
19:06
with pals even mistaking her for a brown
19:08
leather sofa
19:12
that is i mean what like guys stop
19:14
sitting on me what are you doing
19:17
did it change her whole body shape i
19:19
don't know it's interesting the um
19:20
the methods that people used to go about
19:22
to try and get a tan back in the day
19:24
and i read about one which i think
19:25
people still occasionally try
19:28
which is to use tea bags so
19:31
you would what you do is just put a lot
19:33
of tea bags into a hot bath and you
19:34
would get in the bath and you would
19:36
allow that
19:36
to to cook you into you put the have you
19:39
put the milk in fact
19:41
[Applause]
19:43
they didn't say in the uh yeah in the
19:45
article i heard that that was done in
19:47
the war
19:48
where um yes people women wanted a town
19:50
but obviously there's no way
19:52
of getting a tan because you can't go on
19:53
holiday in you know greece anymore
19:55
well the big problem there uh people
19:57
because of the nazis oh yeah
20:00
i knew i hated those guys but
20:03
the thing i read is that um for people
20:05
who try it these days when they do it in
20:06
a bath
20:07
they come across the same problem which
20:09
is how do you
20:11
tan your face because that's above
20:14
water in order to tan it you need to be
20:16
underwater for a long time
20:18
so a bunch of people bought snorkels
20:20
which uh they tried
20:22
um but that that was just weird
20:25
i think once you've gone as far as
20:26
getting in a bath with a load of tea
20:28
bags
20:28
yeah looking weird with a snorkel is at
20:30
least i think there's always a point
20:32
where you go
20:32
no too far this is and so what did they
20:35
work anything out in the end are they
20:37
no you just don't do it anymore well the
20:38
person in the article had a very white
20:40
head
20:40
and regretted the whole experience but
20:43
yeah it's
20:44
um you then just do it outside of the
20:45
bath used to leave tea bags all over
20:47
yourself
20:49
of course it's a thing it's and yeah
20:52
well they also
20:53
used to have milk spray because people
20:54
thought that milk could tan you better
20:56
stop you from burning but give you a
20:58
really nice tan and there were motorized
21:00
milk sprayers that like groups of mainly
21:02
women in the 1930s would carry to
21:04
wherever they wanted to town on holiday
21:06
and like it was this big engine and then
21:08
you stood in front of it and it just
21:09
showered you with milk
21:11
and then you got a nice even tan
21:15
i like this the daily mail that uh uh
21:17
spoke to some people about how bad is
21:19
brits love to get really burnt and it
21:21
found that a 10 million british people
21:24
said that they burned every time they
21:25
went on holiday which is a large
21:26
proportion of the population
21:28
and the person the mail interviewed to
21:30
talk about this was a spokesman for
21:31
superdrug uh chemist and he was called
21:33
martin crisp
21:38
uh we're gonna have to move on to our
21:40
next fact soon there's a planet
21:42
called kepler13ab where it rains sun
21:45
cream
21:47
what brand
21:50
it's um as kind of a titanium oxide
21:53
precipitation
21:54
but it only falls on the dark side of
21:56
the planet so it's completely useless
21:59
wow
22:00
[Laughter]
22:02
just quickly i was looking up some
22:03
beauty salon stuff you know tanning
22:05
salons
22:06
do you guys know about snail salons no
22:08
like so snail slime is the new thing
22:11
in beauty treatment it's really popular
22:13
in so places like thailand and japan
22:15
in italy it's popular and people who are
22:17
running snail farms because now has
22:19
obviously eaten
22:20
uh all over the world are diversifying
22:22
their farms and they hand select a few
22:24
snails on the farm
22:26
to be transferred to the salon and then
22:28
you book a session in this island as a
22:29
woman
22:30
you lie down and you get a few snails on
22:32
your face just crawling all over it
22:34
and the claim is that it heals like your
22:36
acne or scars or it slows down aging
22:38
i've actually tried this
22:39
have you ever good the service is
22:41
unbelievably slow
22:42
[Laughter]
22:46
all right let's move on let's move on to
22:48
our next fact it's time for fact number
22:50
three
22:50
and that is andy my fact is that during
22:54
the second world war the us government
22:56
considered making all american shoes
22:58
deliberately ugly
23:00
[Music]
23:01
so this is the thing to do with
23:02
rationing uh they were very low on
23:04
rubber very low on leather
23:06
and they thought well how are we going
23:08
to do this eventually they decided to
23:09
introduce
23:10
shoe rationing they said everybody can
23:13
only have three pairs of shoes a year
23:15
and if you wanted an extra pair of shoes
23:17
you had to fill in a really long
23:18
complicated form saying why you want
23:19
more shoes
23:20
um but you could only as a manufacturer
23:23
make four colors
23:24
and you could only have two different
23:25
tones on a shoe so
23:27
the rationing was introduced but the
23:28
alternative plan that they did consider
23:30
i think before rejecting it was
23:32
let's just make shoes really really
23:33
horrible some people don't want to buy
23:35
them exactly
23:36
and the four colors that they were
23:37
allowed were um black white
23:39
army russet and town brown
23:44
town town like a place where people live
23:47
oh tower no town
23:55
sorry i had towel like a thing you rub
23:57
yourself with no
23:58
town town town town town
24:01
like a city without a cathedral yes
24:03
right
24:04
[Music]
24:06
oh why didn't you say that did you say
24:10
that
24:10
two-tone um colors on shoes weren't
24:12
allowed that was the maximum
24:14
oh you couldn't have three-toned shoes
24:16
really i saw that you could only have
24:18
single tone you couldn't have double
24:19
tone maybe wrong um you weren't allowed
24:21
boots taller than 10 inches
24:23
and you weren't allowed heels taller
24:25
than 2 and 5 8
24:26
inches and you won't allow fancy tongues
24:38
sorry it's my accent i know i do say the
24:40
word tong wrong but it's the thing
24:42
inside your mouth that you lick stuff
24:44
with
24:54
but when you say tongues you are
24:55
referring to the thing on your shoes
24:57
you're not saying you're not allowed
24:58
elaborate tongues in your mouth that was
25:00
the thing they were rationed during the
25:02
second world war
25:03
fancy tongues there was another thing
25:05
where
25:06
you could get a cheaper version of a
25:07
shoe that would cost you less
25:09
uh of your your ration coupons your
25:12
clothing coupons that you had um
25:14
and it was a shoe that was designed with
25:16
a wooden sole
25:17
so um the problem with that is you get
25:20
no bend
25:21
as you're lifting up your foot like any
25:23
any shoe that anyone is wearing in this
25:25
room
25:26
has and so you would have to reinvent
25:28
the way of how you walk with your shoe
25:30
okay at the moment you're kind of
25:32
waddling left and right is that how they
25:33
did it
25:34
um i mean that's i'm putting myself into
25:37
the place of the person with the shoe
25:38
and that's how i feel
25:39
if the shoes don't bend is that the
25:40
problem yeah because it's a wooden yeah
25:42
it's a wooden bottom
25:43
just like a clog i mean with many with
25:44
clogs like a clock
25:46
thank you anna yeah but then people with
25:49
clogs get around
25:50
okay don't they nope
25:56
they then had to do is in order to make
25:58
that a bit more of a useful
25:59
shoot they then cut a bit and they put a
26:02
hinge in so that you could then walk
26:04
and the hinge would allow you the bend
26:06
the problem is is that while you were
26:07
walking the hinge would collect stones
26:09
and so
26:10
you would be stuck in the hinged
26:11
position
26:13
in a sort of leaning forward position
26:16
like the michael jackson lead yeah
26:17
because he invented shoes didn't he that
26:19
let him do that lean
26:20
he didn't he owned a patent for those
26:22
shoes yeah and they were they kind of
26:25
i think you're allowed to say they kind
26:27
of um there was a bit in the stage and
26:29
he kind of slotted them into the stage
26:30
so that he could lean right forward
26:32
yeah he owned the patient for that thing
26:33
which is weird because that's not really
26:35
inventing a shoe
26:36
that's inventing a strap on the floor of
26:39
a stage
26:42
i thought though it had weights in it as
26:43
well i thought that it literally
26:45
you you moved in a certain way it kicked
26:47
in a weight into function so that when
26:49
you lent forward that would balance you
26:51
as well
26:52
yeah might be my i don't i've not
26:54
followed the michael jackson shoe patent
26:56
paper close enough do you know you can
26:58
get shoes for your shoes now
27:00
what this has been shown off at
27:04
i think paris men's fashion week in the
27:06
last couple of months is shoes for your
27:08
shoes have been designed they've been
27:09
designed by a
27:10
chinese fashion designer called sam
27:12
quanz
27:13
and it's sneakers that then have kind of
27:16
an outer layer which is a sandal
27:18
and you can velcro the sandal on and off
27:20
and it's so that you know if you're
27:22
going out on a dirty street and you've
27:24
got new shoes
27:25
you don't have to get the shoes dirty
27:26
yeah but you want about your outer shoes
27:28
they're going to get dirty
27:29
that's true the person did comment he
27:31
said we haven't got to the
27:32
triple layer stage yet but who knows
27:34
what the future holds
27:36
well i can tell you what it holds a
27:37
fourth layer
27:42
it's never ending well that's a big
27:44
thing in japan isn't it so in japan
27:45
it's very impolite to wear your shoes
27:47
into someone's house everyone takes off
27:49
their shoes as soon as you get to
27:50
someone's house or a restaurant or
27:51
whatever and they give you a pair of
27:53
slippers and it's very nice and you walk
27:54
around the restaurant in the slippers
27:56
and it's great
27:57
except that when you go to the loo in
27:58
the restaurant they have to take you out
28:01
of your normal slippers and put you in
28:02
special toilet slippers
28:05
and there's a real risk of social
28:06
embarrassment that once you've been to
28:08
the toilet you then forget to take off
28:10
your toilet slippers because they're
28:13
very different they look very different
28:14
so one writer said he walked back into a
28:16
fancy restaurant wearing a pair of
28:17
bright yellow slippers
28:18
with a duck having a poo on the toes
28:22
and that was the design and that was a
28:24
picture of a duck having a poo on the
28:25
cell
28:26
yeah it was yeah
28:30
um in 13th century italy
28:33
um so do you know my favorite fact about
28:36
shoes i've said it loads of times
28:37
and that is in the 14th century it was
28:39
made explicitly illegal in france to
28:41
make
28:41
shoes that were shaped like penises yes
28:44
okay
28:45
i found out quite recently that um
28:48
queen mary made it illegal to make shoes
28:51
shaped like vaginas
28:53
no way my god your two favorite facts
28:56
can get married that's so nice
29:00
or at least have sex with each other
29:04
so in this all began in 13th century
29:06
italy and there was a thing it was the
29:08
cult of the virgin mary
29:10
and basically um everyone what better
29:13
way to pay tribute to the virgin mary
29:16
well it wasn't like the the catholic
29:18
church hated it basically so it was like
29:20
a cult it wasn't like uh it wasn't
29:22
just a thing everyone like the virgin
29:24
mary is a culty thing and
29:26
they suddenly became really um paid a
29:29
lot of attention to
29:30
the form of the perfect female body
29:33
which was supposed to be what the virgin
29:34
mary had
29:35
and so they invented these shoes and
29:37
they were called duck spill shoes they
29:38
were really wide
29:40
they were covered they were heavily
29:41
padded they were covered in
29:43
hair like material and
29:46
they put slits in them and you wore pink
29:49
hosiery and as you walked it was
29:52
supposed to look
29:52
like a vagina right wow
29:56
that is amazing and this was high
29:58
fashion in 13th century italy
30:00
no and then when queen mary came um to
30:03
the crown in britain
30:04
she um wanted to curry favor with the
30:06
pope and so she banned them
30:08
i it was supposed to look like a vagina
30:12
yep
30:13
and why
30:16
it was a hairy shoe that had a little
30:18
slit which like
30:20
looked pink sometimes so hang on were
30:23
the
30:24
it's just anatomy guys yeah no sure but
30:27
whether
30:28
so whether penis shoes a response to the
30:31
vagina shoes people saying sort of as a
30:34
prank you know like
30:35
no no no my understanding is it's a
30:37
complete coincidence that these two
30:39
coincidences i believe so that's amazing
30:42
i don't know
30:43
the gender wall was fought in a very
30:44
different way in the middle ages
30:47
uh some other world war two shoes that i
30:50
i
30:50
found is there's a shoe that uh they
30:53
were sort of invented
30:55
to trick the enemy so the shoe would
30:58
leave
30:59
um the footprint of the shoe would leave
31:01
a barefoot footprint
31:03
so it so it looked as if one of the
31:05
locals had been in the area as opposed
31:07
to a soldier who had a big
31:08
boot so on the bottom of the boot was
31:10
just a the shape of a
31:12
foot so but locals wore shoes
31:15
[Music]
31:16
this was southeast asia okay i should
31:19
have said the place
31:20
did they did they make the footprints in
31:22
the opposite direction to where you were
31:24
walking that would be clever that would
31:25
be very clever yeah
31:27
we've said before some people did that
31:28
or supposedly australian outlaws put
31:30
their horses shoes on backwards you're
31:33
right so you don't think
31:34
oh ned kelly's been through this way
31:36
yeah whereas actually kelly had been
31:38
through this way but he was heading the
31:39
other way
31:39
yeah but this is also in bhutan they say
31:42
that yetis have the ability to take
31:44
their foot off
31:44
and put it on that way round that's an
31:48
actual yeti fact
31:50
i do know a fact about animals in the
31:52
shoes a few years ago scientists
31:55
put boots onto dung beetles to find out
31:58
how they cope
31:58
with heat this is so cool
32:01
so dung beetles they have they find a
32:04
ball of poo and they roll it around
32:06
and every so often when it gets to the
32:08
really hot bit of the day
32:09
they climb up on top of the ball of poo
32:11
and then they rest there for a bit
32:12
and scientists wondered is that because
32:14
it's really hot on the sandy desert
32:15
where they're walking around
32:17
so if you put boots on a dung beetle
32:20
you will theoretically find out whether
32:23
uh
32:23
yeah that's the reason and the
32:26
scientists put uh i think it was little
32:28
silicon
32:29
shoes on the dung beetles and they said
32:31
afterwards turns out it's very very very
32:33
difficult
32:34
to shoo a dung beetle
32:39
but they did they managed it they got
32:40
the boots on them and it turns out
32:42
yes when you have boots on as a dung
32:45
beetle you stop
32:46
much less to climb under your ball so
32:48
that is why it's good
32:50
could it be that they don't want to get
32:52
on their dung in case they get on
32:53
their shoes
32:56
they're actually working on a uh a set
32:58
of new
32:59
outer shoes for the dung beetles
33:03
um i read that in palau there's a
33:05
tradition of
33:07
um when people go into the reef and
33:09
they're going fishing and so on what
33:10
they do is
33:11
they take a sea sea cucumbers
33:14
and they squeeze the internals of the
33:16
sea cucumber out
33:17
uh completely so the guts and everything
33:19
go out and then they wear the rubbery
33:21
shell on the reef so they don't cut
33:22
their feet when they're in the reefs
33:24
improvised nature shoes why not just
33:27
like put some wetsuit feet on before you
33:30
start diving
33:31
no this is in this is in palau where um
33:33
they don't have they're just like
33:34
eyes yeah they're just fishing and so on
33:36
and so um the sea cucumber can
33:38
eviscerate its organs that's the thing
33:40
that they do
33:41
uh but they stay alive after they do
33:43
that so
33:45
this feels a bit oh god they're alive
33:47
while you're wearing them what
33:48
well they can stay alive because they
33:50
regrow them and what they do is they
33:52
kind of send out their organs
33:54
and then hopefully like the fish eats
33:56
the organs and they can swim away
33:57
oh my god can you imagine at the end of
33:59
the day being a sea cucumber going
34:01
you're not going to believe what
34:02
happened to me
34:03
[Laughter]
34:05
but also the anus of the sea cucumber
34:07
which is where you're putting your foot
34:09
yeah um is there they have fish living
34:11
in those anuses yes so you might get
34:13
fish in your feet as well
34:14
yeah that's all right you've caught a
34:16
bit of the meal already then i think if
34:18
you've got your
34:19
foot in the sea cucumber's anus the fact
34:21
that there's another fish present there
34:22
adds very little to the overall horror
34:25
of the situation
34:27
i could do it like you know in shopping
34:29
centers where the fish eat your
34:30
desserts oh yeah exactly it's
34:32
exfoliating yeah as well as being
34:34
protective
34:35
yeah that's great i've had that once and
34:36
all i could think while i was having it
34:38
was
34:38
reincarnation and just looking at
34:40
they're going what the did you do
34:42
in your last life
34:44
have come back to eat my feet this is i
34:47
had it once and i think i've told you
34:48
guys this but i had it once
34:50
in cambodia and they had to ask me to
34:53
take my feet
34:53
out of the pond because you put your
34:55
feet in with like five other people and
34:57
my feet are so disgusting that they were
34:58
all coming to my feet
35:03
[Laughter]
35:13
okay it is time for our final fact of
35:15
the show and that is
35:16
chizinski yeah my fact this week is that
35:19
the etiquette
35:20
experts de bretz run classes that teach
35:23
five-year-olds to have strong handshakes
35:26
and navigate dinner parties
35:27
[Laughter]
35:29
and this is so i don't know how many
35:31
people know about de bretz but uh they
35:33
it's basically a sort of guide to being
35:36
a posh person i guess
35:37
um and they started publishing their
35:39
etiquette guides in the 1700s
35:42
and they still go on today and it's kind
35:44
of teaching people how to perform well
35:46
socially
35:47
and they recently started doing these
35:48
classes which
35:50
are called cygnet schools and it's for
35:53
it's meant to be for six to twelve year
35:54
olds i think but actually there's been
35:55
such
35:56
a lot of demand that they're letting in
35:57
five-year-olds and yeah they teach them
35:59
to do things like
36:00
shake hands well and perform a dinner
36:02
party and talk to grown-ups
36:04
and it's to teach children of primary
36:07
school age of early primary school age
36:09
social ease and confidence and charisma
36:11
and charm
36:12
to guarantee that they are both invited
36:14
back to the next play date
36:16
and successful in interviews
36:20
who's interviewing a five-year-old you
36:23
know businesses are getting really
36:24
difficult i've just opened another 19th
36:26
century factory that i needed
36:30
like school interviews so yeah yeah all
36:32
right i guess there was
36:33
so there was a report by one of the
36:35
mothers who'd sent her a child
36:37
on this and at the very end of the the
36:39
piece she wrote about it she
36:41
gave her review of the whole experience
36:43
she said the pleases and thank yous trip
36:45
off the tongue
36:46
and despite the occasional poop joke and
36:48
a little light nose picking he's become
36:50
really quite charming
36:51
[Laughter]
36:53
but you do pay for it so i think it
36:55
starts at
36:56
about 650 pounds for two hours to send
36:59
your five-year-old to this
37:00
but yeah one woman who wrote a blog said
37:02
you'd have to have a really strong
37:03
handshake at the end of that
37:06
i want a proper bone crusher
37:10
and that's just the start so the woman
37:11
who wrote the blog paid 780 for two
37:14
hours to get her handshaking son back
37:15
they saw her coming didn't they
37:17
the normal price is 650 pounds to you
37:20
780
37:23
advice on eating bananas
37:27
i think we're all doing it wrong
37:28
according to the breads apparently if
37:30
you're seated at the table the correct
37:31
way to eat a banana is to peel it
37:33
then use a fork to cut the flesh into
37:36
bite-sized pieces
37:38
in other more informal situations we
37:40
recommend peeling bit by bit and
37:42
breaking
37:43
bite-size bits of the banana off that's
37:45
not the way to do it is it
37:47
do you always see on the internet that
37:48
you're supposed to eat bananas upside
37:50
down aren't you because that's the way
37:52
that monkeys do it or something like
37:53
that
37:53
yeah i always break it i always open it
37:55
in the middle
37:58
i actually do do that i open it in the
38:00
middle and then take the banana out and
38:02
then eat it without the skin right
38:04
you're a psychopath i think yeah
38:08
hang on do you do you mean you snap it
38:10
into no no no you get the banana and you
38:12
make
38:12
you kind of make a little hole in the
38:14
middle of it and then you open it up and
38:15
then you pull the banana out and you eat
38:17
it i'm sure there are other people who
38:19
eat
38:19
then then you reattach the skin to make
38:21
it look like a whole banana and you put
38:23
it
38:23
back on the shelf and then you leave the
38:25
supermarket
38:28
there's actually debrex has a whole
38:29
section on difficult foods if you go to
38:31
the website
38:32
and it lists all the difficult foods to
38:34
eat and so one example is grapes which i
38:36
always thought were quite an easy food
38:38
but a great show off
38:40
[Laughter]
38:43
they're very strict they say don't pick
38:44
individual grapes from a bunch
38:46
you have to use you have to remove a
38:49
small bunch from the big bunch and then
38:51
eat from that
38:51
using either your fingers or grape
38:54
scissors
38:55
grape scissors i've seen those i've been
38:57
to a cutlery collecting
38:58
man's
39:00
[Music]
39:08
are they quite small they're quite yeah
39:10
they're not massive uh shears you know
39:12
they're
39:13
small yeah wow i struggled anyway with
39:16
my stalk did he have because the breath
39:18
also says that if you're eating oranges
39:20
then
39:20
if it's semi-difficult to peel you
39:22
should cut it in half and eat it with a
39:24
teaspoon which i've never considered
39:25
doing at all
39:26
i wonder if i don't think anyone does
39:27
any of this stuff today really
39:29
no i have eaten a banana with a knife
39:31
and fork once and it was actually
39:33
very nice so yeah but that wasn't
39:35
because of the way you were eating it
39:37
though
39:37
it would have tasted the same if you'd
39:39
have done my psychopath play
39:41
no i i'll tell you what it made me pace
39:43
myself and enjoy it
39:46
was there a responsibility to do that
39:47
with a banana was there a special reason
39:49
that you decided to try it
39:50
yeah it was really odd i was on uh
39:51
british airways coming back from new
39:53
york
39:53
and they came they came and they put a
39:55
banana down and a knife and fork and
39:57
they walked away
39:58
and
40:02
[Laughter]
40:04
so i thought i better challenge accepted
40:11
so do bretts also do um they've got some
40:13
rules for
40:14
polite social networking so
40:17
one they say is this is i'm guessing for
40:19
facebook
40:20
think before you poke that's their first
40:22
suggestion
40:24
always wait 24 hours before accepting or
40:27
removing someone as a friend
40:28
the delay will help you gather your
40:30
thoughts which is just great
40:32
philosophy generally isn't it yeah 750
40:35
quid for that one
40:37
no that actually is the price 750 quid
40:40
and it's for 13 to 16 year olds
40:42
no way we're just giving it away for
40:44
free right now
40:46
as you have got lucky this is an
40:47
absolute bargain um the guy who started
40:49
the brett's was called john de bret
40:51
and he began his career with the brett
40:53
peerage which was a book about
40:55
lords and ladies and stuff like that but
40:58
he got into a huge argument with the guy
41:00
who actually wrote it
41:01
and he went bankrupt twice and he only
41:04
managed to survive thanks to taking a
41:06
huge amount of money from his wife
41:08
really which they don't teach you that
41:09
in the breaths do they
41:11
it's encouraged they are they're very
41:15
strong on peerage though
41:16
and um actually one of their most
41:18
frequently asked questions one of the
41:20
most frequent questions that's written
41:21
into dubrette's is like how to address
41:23
the royal family
41:24
as if really anyone's coming up against
41:25
them personally but they've got very
41:27
detailed instructions
41:28
as to how you address them and
41:30
apparently if you're
41:31
writing to so if you're writing to the
41:33
queen then you have to open your letter
41:35
with
41:35
may it please your majesty and then you
41:37
have to begin
41:38
the next sentence with with my humble
41:40
duty but then if you're writing to other
41:42
members
41:42
it tells you all the initials that have
41:44
to come after everyone's name so
41:46
let's say you're writing the prince of
41:47
wales if you're writing to prince
41:48
charles you have to say
41:49
on the envelope to his slash her royal
41:51
highness and then on a new line
41:54
you say for example the prince of wales
41:56
and then these are the initials after
41:57
his name
41:58
k g k t g c b o m a k c d
42:01
q s o p c that's all the things he is
42:05
it's so great wow gcb is he's a great
42:08
master and principal knight of the most
42:10
honorable order of the bath
42:12
and that's about how they used to bathe
42:15
nights so when you were knighted in
42:16
medieval times you had a bath
42:18
first thing you did and then if you're a
42:20
great master of the most honorable of
42:22
the bath
42:23
it's about bathing when you become a
42:24
knight wow isn't that cool that's very
42:26
cool yeah he's the only great master
42:29
good for him
42:33
um i was looking up general etiquette
42:35
things yeah there's
42:36
a book by an author called henry
42:37
hitchings and it's called
42:39
sorry and it's about english people and
42:41
their manners
42:42
and he just lists advice from throughout
42:44
the ages of because etiquette varies
42:46
obviously depending on your society
42:48
so for example uh in the 15th century
42:50
the duke of gloucester's usher
42:52
advised that one should not scratch
42:54
one's cod piece in public
43:00
erasmus the medieval writer advised that
43:02
one should cough
43:03
to disguise a fart uh erasmus actually
43:07
um that book that he wrote um it was
43:09
about children's etiquette wasn't it
43:11
and um it was the best-selling book in
43:13
all of england in the 16th century apart
43:15
from the bible
43:16
why and some of the other things he said
43:18
was do not be afraid of vomiting
43:21
it is not vomiting but holding the vomit
43:23
in your throat that is foul
43:26
i disagree strongly with that actually
43:29
if you cannot swallow a piece of food
43:31
turn around discreetly and throw it
43:33
somewhere
43:36
better don't use that on your 650 quick
43:38
course
43:39
actually weirdly did brett say the
43:41
opposite so how times have changed they
43:42
say
43:43
a dinner party when encountering an
43:45
unexpected piece of gristle
43:46
or something that may be chewed to no
43:48
avail um
43:49
it is polite to be brave and try and
43:51
swallow it anyway
43:59
i'd love to see the um the difference
44:01
between erasmus and the brats that would
44:02
be really awesome
44:04
another one do not move back and forth
44:05
on your chair whoever does that gives
44:07
the impression of constantly breaking or
44:09
trying to break wind
44:12
well james
44:23
hey we need to wrap up very soon um you
44:25
guys got anything before we do
44:27
in victorian times women were advised to
44:29
pinch their fingers so the ends would be
44:30
nice and pointy
44:32
[Laughter]
44:34
were their fingers
44:36
[Music]
44:37
it was just a thing you were meant to
44:38
have nice pointy ends two fingers nice
44:40
and tapering not sort of
44:41
flat cut off fingers and um one writer
44:44
said that if your fingers are bad you've
44:45
got bad fingers
44:47
then just pinch them lots of times all
44:49
the time
44:50
and women were advised and this is a
44:52
thing that happens today i believe
44:53
to fill old gloves with cream and then
44:55
put on the old gloves full of cream
44:57
and then you go to bed at night and
44:59
that's the thing that still happens
45:00
no it doesn't happen no does anyone hear
45:02
someone said yes
45:04
yeah see all women's voices this is a
45:06
conspiracy there's a cat from men
45:08
no men know about this guys what kind of
45:11
what kind of cream is it like
45:12
i think just any any double cream
45:18
this is the thing i talked i told my
45:20
girlfriend about this and and she said
45:22
andy we all do this all the time you've
45:24
never paid any attention to anything
45:26
why do you think the bed is full of
45:27
cream every morning
45:29
[Applause]
45:31
i've never heard of it but i'd be so
45:32
creeped out if my partner was wearing
45:34
gloves in bed so that's
45:36
so weird i think they've just done a
45:39
murder or something
45:41
that is quite something isn't it but
45:44
then you're just gonna have nice hands
45:46
but what about the rest of your body
45:47
you should really be wearing a full body
45:49
suit yes and covering it all in cream
45:52
with a snorkel to keep you breathing

[Music]
00:11
hello
00:12
and welcome to another episode of no
00:15
such thing as a fish
00:17
a weekly podcast this week coming to you
00:19
live from belfast
00:25
my name is dan schreiber and i am
00:28
sitting here
00:29
with anna chazinski andrew hunter murray
00:31
and james harkin
00:33
and once again we have gathered around
00:34
the microphones with our four
00:36
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:38
and in no particular order
00:40
here we go starting with you james
00:43
okay my fact this week is that there are
00:45
a number of chickens
00:46
in california that have their own
00:48
personal chefs
00:51
[Music]
00:53
i think you'd live in constant fear as a
00:55
chicken if you had your own
00:59
one day he's gonna run on us to stop in
01:01
the pantry oh they've been giving me a
01:03
lot of sage and onion recently
01:06
mr chicken tonight for dinner
01:09
yeah that's very exciting so this is
01:11
specifically in silicon valley
01:13
uh and at the moment there is a chicken
01:15
mania happening in silicon valley
01:17
a single chicken can cost 350
01:21
and normally they cost about 15 their
01:24
coops are controlled by smartphone
01:25
apps and basically it's it's kind of a
01:28
status symbol in silicon valley to have
01:30
your own chicken
01:33
are they special chickens in any way are
01:35
they amazing or nate you know
01:36
amazingly ornate chicken some of them
01:38
are pretty good actually
01:40
i have to say i'm not sure i'd pay 350
01:42
for one but they are pretty good
01:44
so they're specially um bred for
01:46
desirable
01:47
personality traits so the ones that are
01:49
particularly
01:51
what what is a personality trait in a
01:53
chicken
01:55
well you have to the ground
01:59
so um for instance if they're gentle
02:00
enough for a child to cuddle
02:02
okay so rather you know like an angry
02:04
chicken you wouldn't want to put that
02:06
near your child
02:07
they don't have those and there are some
02:09
that are rare there are some that are
02:10
beautiful according to the article i
02:12
read
02:12
and some of them have special highly
02:14
coveted coloured eggs
02:16
and they're called easter eggers and
02:18
they give you blue eggs
02:20
wow they're really really good ones
02:22
those that's really
02:23
cool they also i read a lot of people
02:26
keep the chickens in their house like
02:28
they're a cat or a dog
02:29
and they call them lap chickens because
02:31
they come and they they sit on your lap
02:32
and you can just stroke them
02:33
and the way that they make sure that
02:36
they don't defecate all over the house
02:38
is they put them in diapers
02:39
so there's special chicken diapers that
02:42
you can now buy
02:43
and i went to a website that sells these
02:45
chicken diapers because
02:47
you're wearing them tonight no there's
02:50
there's a few good websites that do it
02:52
actually there's one called my pet
02:53
chicken
02:54
and there's one called pampered poultry
02:56
uh pampered
02:57
pampered poultry is very nice so you can
02:59
see them they're all nicely designed
03:00
they sit
03:01
around the the bum of the of the chicken
03:04
like a diaper
03:05
um but they not only sell diapers they
03:08
also sell saddles
03:09
on chickens and it's mainly
03:12
for people to ride chickens no yeah
03:15
that's what i thought but it turns out
03:17
what it is
03:18
is that um when a chicken is having sex
03:21
uh from the behind the male is really
03:24
aggressive and pecks away at their back
03:26
so it's a sort of blanket that sits over
03:28
the back of the chicken so they don't
03:29
lose all their feathers when the when
03:31
the males
03:32
when they're being ridden in a way
03:34
[Laughter]
03:34
[Music]
03:36
very true very true they also my pet
03:39
chicken has a very
03:41
exciting device basically um a lot of
03:43
people have problems if they do have a
03:45
chicken in their house where it does
03:46
cock-a-doodle-doo a lot um so they have
03:48
what on they
03:49
on their side they called
03:50
cock-a-doodle-don't and
03:52
cock-or-doodle-don't is a new
03:54
contraption that goes around the neck
03:56
uh that stops it from crowing uh from
03:58
roostering
03:59
and how does it stop it it it it goes
04:02
around the throat
04:04
yeah it's a bit questionable i'm not
04:07
sure my
04:07
chicken.com did you not just say this is
04:09
a very cool contraption
04:11
can we edit that bit out because that's
04:14
staying in isn't it
04:14
um and if you pay an extra amount of
04:17
money 12
04:18
more it only costs 18 for it to happen
04:20
they say it doesn't hurt the chicken
04:21
but if you uh if the rooster if you do
04:23
it um for 12
04:24
more you can buy a bow tie that goes
04:26
around
04:28
absolute bargain for just 30 you can
04:30
choke the chicken
04:31
in a classy low tonight fashion how nice
04:38
nothing more classy than a dead chicken
04:39
with a bow tie on
04:42
um you do get some incredible looking
04:44
kind of designer chickens now though
04:46
um or i mean just google some designer
04:49
chickens they're stunning but i think my
04:50
favorite is the i am chicken
04:52
the it's a-y-a-m and it's described by
04:56
breeders as the lamborghini of chickens
05:00
and you can see why so it's you might
05:03
have seen it it's
05:04
that chicken that's black completely
05:06
black from head to toe it looks like
05:07
it's been dipped in oil so
05:08
it's big uh it's it's crown it's
05:11
uh sorry it's comb it's legs it's feet
05:14
and the weird thing is like it's eyes
05:16
completely black but the weird thing is
05:17
it's fully black on the inside as well
05:19
which i didn't realize so all of its
05:21
organs all of the
05:23
meat in it all of its flesh all of its
05:25
bones everything is black
05:27
and so if you then eat this chicken it's
05:29
the meat itself is black
05:30
the only thing about the chicken that's
05:32
not black is it lays white eggs
05:34
and they're just they're incredible and
05:36
there's this um ion breeder in america
05:39
who's got a site where they sell them
05:41
and they say they're very very
05:42
good-natured as well so i think a new
05:44
york magazine wanted to meet one
05:46
and the review said the rooster
05:48
patiently allowed himself to be draped
05:50
with million dollar jewelry
05:52
and trust with red ribbon while being
05:54
photographed under bright lights
05:56
which again is an amazing looking
05:57
chicken people are doing some weird
05:59
with their chickens
06:00
yeah of course your website is going to
06:02
say our chickens are extremely friendly
06:03
no
06:04
websites telling you these chickens are
06:05
going to say i'll check into real
06:06
bastards actually
06:08
um so i i was looking up chickens in
06:11
silicon valley because this is a massive
06:12
trend at the moment
06:13
there is a company at the moment that is
06:14
trying to disrupt eggs
06:16
okay so they're trying to make um a food
06:20
startup thing they're called just and
06:22
they make eggless scrambled eggs
06:24
out of um mung beans but the other thing
06:28
they've started doing recently
06:29
they've started making chicken nuggets
06:30
from chickens which are still alive
06:34
and so there's just like chickens with
06:35
bits missing well
06:38
kind of so they took some cells from the
06:40
inside of
06:41
a chicken feather so they took one
06:43
feather from a chicken called ian for
06:45
the record
06:54
[Laughter]
06:56
so they took some cells from the inside
06:58
of the feather and then they cultivated
07:00
them and they fed those cells on plant
07:01
proteins right and they turned those
07:03
into a big mass of chicken
07:04
meat they grew those into chicken mussel
07:06
and then they had a barbecue
07:08
where they served up chicken nuggets and
07:09
ian was present
07:11
walking around on the table while he he
07:14
was
07:15
being eaten by these people presumably
07:17
surely he was there with a megaphone
07:19
saying this is an outrage
07:21
yeah it's very basically people in
07:23
silicon valley are mad that's all we
07:24
need this
07:24
that's all we need to know yeah you can
07:26
go on a tour of silicon valley um called
07:28
todder coupe
07:30
where you just see all of the chicken
07:31
coops that they have because they're
07:33
unbelievably expensive some of them can
07:34
cost up to like 20 000
07:36
um dollars and um one owner at least
07:39
plans to transform his coop into an
07:41
airbnb for humans
07:43
once his chickens die that's how ornate
07:45
it is
07:47
my parents had chickens there's no way
07:49
i'd want to sleep in the same place that
07:50
those chickens are sleeping that's
07:52
disgusting
07:53
would you share the coop with them or do
07:55
they vacate like
07:56
i guess they vacate and leave your
07:57
croissant and stuff when you stay there
07:59
presumably
08:00
they're basically dead and they're
08:03
they've been eaten
08:04
they're long gone and they probably
08:05
clean it and you know oh that's actually
08:07
not how airbnb works at all
08:18
yeah some other weird stuff that um
08:20
people in silicon valley
08:22
yeah are doing um so there's been a lot
08:24
lately
08:25
about what people in silicon valley call
08:27
biohacking
08:28
which i just find a really amusing word
08:30
because what it means is
08:31
stupid diets but they call it biohacking
08:34
because it sounds really smart
08:35
um but like all the ceos of all the big
08:37
companies are into this in like weird
08:39
kind of diets
08:40
so there's jeffrey wu who's a ceo
08:43
of uh he's actually ceo of a biohacking
08:45
company and
08:46
he got all his staff to do a full-on
08:48
seven-day fast
08:49
and they all had to wear glucose
08:51
monitors that are designed for diabetics
08:53
and it like inserts ping pin pricks into
08:55
your skin
08:56
and it measures your blood elevated
08:58
ketones which is a way of checking how
09:00
much fat you're using and stuff so he
09:02
makes all his staff go
09:03
starve themselves for seven days to make
09:05
sure they're burning enough fat and it
09:07
elevates your mental
09:08
acuity and things like that but they're
09:10
all kind of
09:12
going on silly teenage girl diets
09:14
claiming it's biohacking
09:15
so it's okay i read about jeffrey wu um
09:18
because he
09:19
started this thing there's a drug that
09:20
people in silicon valley take
09:22
which is the idea is it's a cognitive
09:23
enhancing drug and so it's a brain drug
09:26
effectively and it's called
09:27
nootropics which is an old idea that was
09:29
back in 1972 that that term was coined
09:31
but the idea is you take it and it makes
09:33
your brain
09:34
get stimulated so he runs a company um
09:36
where he
09:37
provides these drugs everyone's on these
09:40
brain stimulant drugs in silicon valley
09:42
if they're working with jeffrey but i
09:43
don't know if it's making you want to
09:45
pay
09:45
350 for a chicken i'm not sure
09:48
how smart they're making you actually
09:50
the chickens control the company that
09:52
makes the drug
09:53
have you met our ceo
10:00
there is very was i read about um so
10:03
i've read about a hobby
10:04
because the hobbies that people have in
10:05
silicon valley um there's and
10:07
people do various weird sports and stuff
10:09
because there's a lot of mountainous
10:10
terrain
10:10
have you heard of ryden thai this is so
10:13
cool
10:14
so it's a mountain race involving two
10:15
people and one horse
10:17
okay so but the rule is only one person
10:21
can be touching the horse at any given
10:22
moment
10:24
so you get on the horse and you ride for
10:26
a couple of miles then
10:28
and your friend runs and then you tie
10:30
the horse up after a couple of miles and
10:31
then you start running and your friend
10:33
catches up to the horse gets on it right
10:34
here
10:36
and then and you have to get off after
10:38
two miles you can't just go on the horse
10:39
for the whole length of the castle oh
10:40
that's a much better idea actually
10:43
yeah again see they're reinventing the
10:45
wheel just go for a ride on a horse
10:48
that's pretty i think it does sound kind
10:49
of fun it sounds quite intense yeah
10:51
really fun
10:52
why wouldn't you just go on the horse
10:53
alongside the person who's running
10:56
horses can run faster than people no i
10:58
know but
10:59
famous i mean that's why it's those guys
11:01
who do the grand national
11:03
yeah but that's like no humans have won
11:05
that have they
11:07
they've never even qualified for it but
11:10
actually there is a horse versus human
11:12
race isn't that i think he's using
11:13
whales everywhere or something
11:15
yeah and um like sometimes the humans do
11:17
win but it's on a really twisty course
11:19
with like
11:19
you know stairs and lifts yeah things
11:23
that horses can't do
11:24
um on drugs actually yes all silicon
11:26
valley ceos are also doing lsd at the
11:28
moment
11:29
and again for legal reasons i think not
11:32
all
11:32
oh sorry yes definitely not all the
11:35
bloody most right
11:38
um but it's micro dosing so they take a
11:41
tenth the amount of dynasty that you'd
11:43
usually not you but that one might
11:44
usually take
11:45
to get um a proper hallucination and
11:48
apparently the effect this has is that
11:50
it increases alertness and energy and
11:52
stuff and it's another way of them
11:53
i guess kind of biohacking themselves
11:55
taking a bit of hallucinogenic to make
11:56
themselves
11:57
more switched on so the other thing
11:59
that's been in the news is like raw
12:00
water have you seen all this basically
12:03
people are drinking water that's come
12:05
direct from source and hasn't been
12:06
decontaminated
12:08
which is really really a terrible idea
12:12
um there was an expert who said almost
12:14
everything conceivable that can make you
12:15
sick
12:16
can be found in water so a lot of it
12:19
contains animal feces there are there
12:22
are terrible diseases you can get
12:23
hepatitis a you can get cholera you can
12:25
get e coli
12:26
and this expert they asked him about it
12:28
and he said you can't stop consenting
12:30
adults from being stupid
12:32
but we should at least try
12:34
[Laughter]
12:36
that's amazing we're gonna have to sorry
12:38
we're gonna have to move on to our next
12:39
fact soon
12:40
i was just gonna say that i was reading
12:41
a quote from mukande singh who's the
12:43
founder of live water which is one of
12:44
the big water stunt
12:46
startups and um so they don't trust all
12:48
the chemicals that go in the water that
12:50
we drink
12:51
and he said uh so you have we have
12:52
things like chloramine and
12:54
fluoride in our water call me a
12:56
conspiracy theorist but it's a mind
12:58
control drug that has no benefit to our
13:00
dental health
13:01
i'll go there he's a conspiracy
13:04
theorist
13:06
um just one more thing yeah apple have
13:08
built a new campus in california this
13:10
year
13:11
it's made completely out of glass and
13:13
the idea is to
13:14
encourage an open working environment
13:17
and on the very first day seven people
13:18
were taken to hospital through walking
13:20
into the doors
13:25
it's so good
13:26
[Music]
13:30
okay it is time to move on to fact
13:33
number two
13:34
and that is andy my fact is
13:37
that the victorian cat burglar charles
13:39
peace could supposedly disguise himself
13:41
just by changing the shape of his face
13:47
so he was he was a real guy um and
13:49
before we go any further he was a really
13:50
unpleasant guy he was a burglar and he
13:51
was a murderer as well
13:53
um but he killed two people for a while
13:55
he was the nation's most wanted man
13:57
but he had this incredible gift
13:58
supposedly for
14:00
just moving his face into a slightly
14:01
different shape and you would think
14:03
where did he go
14:06
i just i just can't see how that work i
14:08
don't i can't imagine how that would
14:10
work i know
14:11
well neither can i but it supposedly was
14:12
very rubbery face like mr bean kind of
14:14
thing like rowan atkinson maybe
14:16
yeah exactly well um the jim carrey when
14:19
he was in the movie the mask
14:20
the people who were doing the cgi said
14:22
they had to spend way less than they
14:24
anticipated because his face was so
14:25
elastic
14:26
that he was able to contort it and it
14:28
looked like cgi had been done already
14:31
there we go but it's not like it doesn't
14:32
look like them it's not like rowan
14:34
atkinson and jim carrey can avoid all
14:35
publicity and attention by
14:37
just contorting their face quickly rowan
14:39
atkinson could be in the front row
14:43
so this guy charles peace he was he was
14:45
an extremely interesting man in lots of
14:46
ways so
14:47
he he was really famous at the time he
14:49
was very very notorious
14:50
and he had a missing finger which you
14:53
would think would have identified him
14:56
but he cleverly got around this by using
14:58
an entire prosthetic arm
15:00
which apparently is less inconspicuous
15:03
the guy with three arms
15:07
he's got the right number of fingers
15:11
because he was
15:12
he was executed wasn't he um and uh he
15:15
told the clergyman who interviewed him
15:17
in prison just before his execution he
15:19
said that he hoped that after he was
15:20
gone he would be entirely forgotten by
15:22
everybody
15:23
and his name never mentioned again yeah
15:26
sorry
15:27
but also within hours of his death the
15:29
first ballad of charles peace was on
15:31
sale
15:32
was it yeah and the biography was ready
15:35
for publication even before he was dead
15:37
so that's how famous he was wow
15:38
and also his executioner was very famous
15:41
as well um it was a guy called marwood
15:43
so he was he was executed by
15:44
probably britain's most famous at the
15:46
time executioner people would go
15:48
he was a celebrity of execution and to
15:50
the point where he had a popular rhyme
15:52
that people used to sing about him which
15:53
was if
15:54
park killed ma who'd kill par marwood
15:56
that was the
15:57
oh that's right that's really clever
15:59
yeah it's so clever
16:01
i read i mean it's a bit gruesome but um
16:02
in the british newspaper archive i
16:04
actually read one of the articles from
16:05
the time about when he was executed and
16:07
um
16:08
it's darkly amusing because he does what
16:10
any of us would do which is like he
16:12
keeps trying to put it off so
16:13
you'd like to say and he said his
16:15
prayers and thanks to everyone he was
16:16
ready to go
16:17
and then he went actually i'm really
16:18
thirsty can i get a drink of water
16:19
please
16:20
and they're like no i don't think so and
16:22
they said hold on i've got one more
16:23
thing to say and this article goes on
16:24
and on he keeps on going
16:26
wait i've just got one more quick thing
16:27
before we can i
16:30
and the person who he killed um was a
16:32
policeman called pc
16:34
and what was interesting is because he
16:37
did kill this guy um he was basically
16:39
caught doing a burglary and he killed a
16:40
policeman
16:41
um but luckily for him the police simply
16:43
picked up the nearest irishman they
16:45
could find
16:49
uh they charged this irishman with
16:50
murder and then apparently charlie
16:52
attended the trial dressed as a vicar
16:54
and made of course he did with his three
16:57
arms
16:58
he played all 12 members of the jury at
17:00
various points
17:02
to anybody and he made loud remarks from
17:05
the public gallery to the effect that
17:06
the evidence was merely circumstantial
17:09
so he was you know he was the guy who
17:10
did it and he was like this guy's not
17:12
guilty man this guy's
17:13
he wasn't willing to say it was me i did
17:15
it no you're right
17:17
he's halfway there conscience-wise i
17:18
think
17:19
[Music]
17:20
yeah he did he admitted to it in the end
17:23
when he was found guilty of the other
17:24
murder
17:25
um he admitted to the earlier one yeah
17:27
that's what i read in the article that i
17:29
read
17:29
that he did uh he did admit by doing
17:32
that
17:33
uh that it was him i read this by the
17:35
way on a website called
17:37
executedtoday.com um
17:40
every new day a new execution to read up
17:42
on about if you're looking for a cheery
17:44
read executedtoday.com
17:47
he did once have a really good comedy
17:49
moment where he was imprisoned
17:51
loads of times i don't know how he had
17:52
time to do any burglaries and one time
17:54
he was put in a train
17:55
uh and was being taken to a prison and
17:57
he was coming out of works up on his way
17:59
to this prison
18:00
and he jumped off the train to escape
18:02
and awarded on the train grabbed hold of
18:04
his leg as he jumped off
18:05
and apparently he bounced along on his
18:07
head with the warden clinging to his
18:09
ankle
18:10
for a few like like hundreds of feet
18:13
until
18:14
eventually um he wriggled out of his
18:16
grip and then the train stopped and they
18:17
turned back and picked him up again
18:20
should have worn a third leg
18:23
speaking of him and legs his father was
18:25
a one-legged lion tamer yes
18:28
it's quite a family is what we're saying
18:31
what's amazing as well there is
18:33
no more detail about his dad other than
18:34
that one sentence
18:36
his life that's all that exists now
18:38
that's all we know we can't guess how we
18:39
lost the leg i think
18:42
he was a very bad two-legged client
18:46
if we're being sticklers for facts he
18:48
started as a collier and lost his leg
18:49
when he was doing mining
18:50
and then became a lion tamer as he would
18:52
so when you said there was no other
18:54
information online it was just
18:56
well it wasn't executed today.com yeah
19:00
he became a shoemaker after being a lion
19:02
tamer which i really love that
19:03
okay there's a lot of stuff on it online
19:05
i get it so was he a one-legged
19:08
shoemaker
19:12
um so he was apparently irresistible to
19:14
women
19:15
uh with his you know three arms
19:18
[Laughter]
19:19
take your hand off me and that one and
19:22
that one
19:24
but i suppose if you can change your
19:26
face all the time
19:27
then you can if you don't like this one
19:29
i've got others yeah
19:31
i've just done my last boyfriend he had
19:33
three arms weirdly the new one's got
19:34
three arms too
19:37
so um he got married and then he moved
19:40
to london
19:41
and he got married again um but he lived
19:43
with his previous wife as well who he
19:45
called his mother
19:47
and it seems that the second wife didn't
19:48
know that who he called his mother was
19:50
actually his first wife
19:52
oh wow what oh for for a victorian
19:56
jeremy kyle show
20:00
welcome to jeremiah
20:06
incredible it's true it's well i mean a
20:09
lot of
20:10
we should say actually at this point
20:11
because i said it's true a lot of it is
20:13
clouded in myth isn't it because he was
20:15
he was so famous and he was famous as
20:17
like a robin hood kind of character so
20:19
lots of stories about him but according
20:21
to people at the time this is what
20:23
happened
20:24
um he lived with his wife and his mother
20:26
uh in peckham and they used to have
20:28
parties
20:29
um attended by all the rich people in
20:31
peckham um which there were at the time
20:34
and um
20:37
and there are now since delboy won the
20:38
lottery
20:41
uh and then what would happen is charlie
20:42
would get called out on some urgent
20:44
business
20:45
during the party they would carry on the
20:46
party and then when all the guests got
20:48
home they all found they've been burgled
20:52
wow so good so just on uh disguises
20:56
um because this guy was disguising
20:58
himself a lot um
21:00
i tried to look up other people who had
21:01
great disguises so there was a guy a
21:02
bank robber called willie sutton
21:04
and he was very crafty because he was he
21:07
was known in life as slick willie
21:09
and he and like come on now he and
21:12
um um in 1947 he escaped the
21:17
philadelphia county prison where he was
21:18
being held he escaped dressed as a
21:20
prison guard
21:21
and he was so crafty that the
21:22
searchlight on the prison wall found him
21:24
but he was dressed as a prison guard and
21:25
he just shouted it's okay
21:31
that's so good so good
21:34
i was yeah so i was looking at some
21:35
other good disguises
21:37
more modern burglars have tried did you
21:39
guys read about the guy
21:40
i think last year who dressed as a tree
21:42
to
21:43
rob a bank
21:46
[Laughter]
21:50
[Applause]
21:52
[Music]
21:53
[Laughter]
21:55
so this this is a new hampshire and this
21:58
is a guy who
21:59
walks straight into a bank and he just
22:01
there's pictures of him there's cctv
22:02
he had kind of leaves duct tape to his
22:05
kind of face and bits of his body he did
22:08
he looked almost nothing like a tree
22:09
and but he walked in and he said give me
22:13
all your money and they gave him money
22:14
but then on cctv someone immediately
22:16
recognized him because he only covered
22:17
about a quarter of his face with bits of
22:19
twig
22:19
and said that's not bob or whoever it
22:21
was and he was cool
22:22
wouldn't it be great if there was a
22:23
police lineup of genuine trees and just
22:25
him
22:29
do you know how you can tell an officer
22:30
from mi5 they're spies are they they are
22:33
spies so you wouldn't be able to tell
22:34
them
22:35
but a good there's a good chance that
22:37
they will be
22:38
dressed as a beggar because this is a
22:40
very good way of keeping surveillance on
22:41
a building
22:42
um because a lot of people you know yes
22:44
they ignore the beggars or the homeless
22:45
and walk on by and one one guy from mi5
22:48
said that for operations he would use
22:50
my own clothes soaked in my own urine to
22:53
complement that cover
22:55
so it is proper deep cover wow i didn't
22:58
see that james bond film
23:00
ah bond we've got you these they're your
23:06
trousers
23:08
um just on spies did you guys see the
23:10
news today that you know how every
23:12
country at the moment is sort of sending
23:13
their russian spies out that so britain
23:15
sent the russian spies out
23:17
uh new zealand said that they would do
23:18
the same and then added uh
23:20
actually we can't find any
23:23
that could be that they're just really
23:24
good that's the thing yeah there are
23:26
some weird new trees outside the russian
23:28
embassy but
23:29
a lot of people covered in their own
23:31
pests
23:34
do you know the cia has a chief of
23:35
disguise so this is a real post in the
23:37
cia
23:38
and there is a someone who's just
23:39
retired as the chief of disguise she's
23:41
called joe
23:42
she's called johnna mendes and she said
23:45
this in an interview i can't i can't
23:46
tell if she's
23:47
joking or not i think she's being
23:48
serious she said that one message the
23:50
cia
23:51
one sorry she said that one method the
23:53
cia might use to send a message to
23:55
someone
23:56
would be to shave a pet tattoo a message
23:59
onto it
24:00
and then pass the animal on once the
24:03
hair has grown back on the animal yeah
24:04
that's um it's not that's a historical
24:06
thing i think
24:07
well i've heard it with you know um
24:09
ancient emperors
24:11
might have done it but i very much like
24:12
the idea of shaving a hamster and
24:14
writing
24:15
i think you'd go for a lot you go for a
24:17
snake and you can't shave a snake
24:18
[Laughter]
24:24
imagine if you wrote on let's say i
24:26
don't know um it's gonna be something
24:27
big
24:28
but yeah if you got to the end of a dog
24:30
and then you ran out of
24:31
words so you had to append a hamster to
24:33
the dog
24:34
[Applause]
24:36
it's not the immediate messaging service
24:38
of texting is it
24:39
it's not if it's we're compromised burn
24:42
everything and get out of the country
24:43
[Laughter]
24:45
okay it's time to move on to our third
24:47
fact and that is my fact
24:49
my fact this week is that if the british
24:51
treated their monarchy the way
24:53
that the ancient egyptians did queen
24:55
elizabeth ii
24:56
would have to run around a racetrack
24:58
every three years to prove
25:00
she was still fit for the job
25:03
so the idea of this is that in ancient
25:05
egypt it said that what they used to
25:07
have was a festival called hempset
25:09
and after a pharaoh had reached 30 years
25:12
in
25:12
ruling power that were they still fit to
25:15
run it that was a big question and in
25:16
order to prove that they were still fit
25:18
they would have to run around the
25:19
complex of where they were living and
25:21
usually it was a race track
25:22
and they would do it with a sort of
25:24
animal tail that was hanging behind them
25:26
and everyone came to watch it and the
25:28
first time you did it was after
25:29
30 years but then it was every
25:31
subsequent three years because they
25:33
thought
25:33
you might lose it in those three years
25:34
time so if queen elizabeth ii had to do
25:37
it
25:37
uh she would have done it 13 times by
25:39
now we don't actually know why
25:42
they did it do we no we're not quite
25:44
sure there's a few different theories
25:45
um one theory that i quite like is that
25:47
there was an original
25:48
thing they did where once you're in
25:50
office for 30 years you would just get
25:52
killed
25:52
and then some smart pharaoh went well
25:54
what if i do the running thing instead
25:58
or maybe they were trying to kill him
25:59
and he was running away
26:01
but some people think that other people
26:03
it's just like it proves that you're fit
26:04
enough to
26:05
yeah i read it was a thing as well where
26:07
it was sort of um it was directly
26:09
related
26:10
to the afterlife and by doing it you
26:11
were building up as it were bonus points
26:13
i don't know what for but
26:15
you know like how mario collects coins
26:17
and like it was just
26:19
and it would do something for your next
26:20
life i didn't see that theory okay
26:23
another idea is they were out running
26:25
old age that was or outrunning death
26:27
that was another theory
26:28
but you did they did really have to
26:30
collect all the right stuff for the
26:31
afterlife didn't they egyptian pharaohs
26:33
they're burying them was such a hassle
26:35
it was like going on
26:36
a holiday for the rest of your life so
26:38
you have to pack everything you possibly
26:40
needed
26:40
so um all ancient egyptian royals were
26:42
buried with mini breweries
26:44
um so they had all the alcohol they
26:46
would need for the afterlife
26:48
which is quite good so it's like a
26:49
really good source of how we know how
26:51
they brewed
26:52
beer and stuff in ancient egypt is
26:53
because if you look at all the tombs of
26:55
people from three thousand years ago
26:56
they all had a little brewery they had
26:58
micro breweries they all had a microbial
27:00
hipsters
27:02
with their beards and like
27:06
we said before that they used to have
27:08
slaves specifically to keep their wine
27:10
cool
27:10
to fan their wine which i don't know how
27:13
well it worked but
27:14
they just go around with a fan fanning
27:15
the wine well there was a there was an
27:17
ancient egyptian pharaoh called
27:19
pepe the second and he used to
27:22
have a thing where there were so many
27:23
flies that would hit you in ancient
27:25
egypt and it
27:25
said that what he did was to make sure
27:27
no flies ever landed on him
27:29
he always took with him a servant or a
27:31
slave who was coated completely in honey
27:33
so that any fly would immediately sit on
27:36
that
27:37
i don't i learned that from horrible
27:38
histories um
27:40
good sounds good yeah good pepe the
27:42
second he was uh he reigned for 90 years
27:44
so um it seems like he did this running
27:47
thing 20 times
27:48
you reigned for 90 90 years yep yeah
27:50
they can't decide
27:51
if uh because it comes from one source
27:54
they think it might be that he reigned
27:55
for about 64 years
27:57
on the beards thing they would always
27:59
they would shave and then they would
28:00
wear a false beard
28:02
which is supposed i think it was an
28:03
imitation of the gods because i think
28:05
they said that osiris the god
28:06
had a beard just like this and so if you
28:08
shave and you put on a false beard
28:10
there was a female pharah wasn't there
28:12
and she always wore a fake beard
28:14
shirt or something yeah so the queen if
28:16
she was ancient egyptian
28:17
would have to wear a fake beard as well
28:19
yeah yeah and
28:20
on on a hatch episode there has just
28:23
been a new image of her
28:25
discovered this is very exciting brand
28:27
new archaeological discovery and a new
28:29
image of her has been found
28:30
in swansea really yeah really
28:33
it's been in storage for 40 years at
28:35
swansea university's egypt center and
28:37
they were just having a standard uh
28:38
teaching session going through a few of
28:39
the images
28:40
and one of the professors his name is
28:41
ken griffin he was examining it and he
28:44
thought that's harsh absolute and it's
28:46
very hard because they're all wearing
28:48
a beard and normal male clothes in these
28:50
depictions so it's very hard to spot her
28:52
what's she doing swansea was that where
28:53
she summered or
28:57
weird i don't know we should say that a
28:59
lot of the information
29:01
that we have about ancient egypt comes
29:03
from um like greek sources so a lot of
29:05
it comes from herodotus
29:06
and who was a good history in a lot of
29:08
ways but then was sometimes a bit
29:10
fanciful
29:11
but i really like this which i think is
29:13
herodotus about
29:14
i've never read this before about the
29:16
persian king cambises who defeated
29:18
a egyptian pharaoh called samatic iii
29:21
and he defeated him using his knowledge
29:23
of egyptian culture specifically the
29:25
fact that egyptians worshiped cats
29:27
which is quite well known so what he did
29:28
was um he was
29:30
attacking the egyptians and he had this
29:31
big army but then rather than
29:33
actually attack their army with his army
29:35
he took a bunch of cats hostage
29:38
and then he released them onto the
29:40
battlefield as his front line
29:42
and actually he had sort of backing them
29:43
up a bunch of dogs sheep
29:45
ibises and whatever other animals the
29:47
egyptians hold dear
29:49
and the egyptians just surrendered they
29:50
said well we can't kill any of those
29:52
because they're precious to us and they
29:54
gave in how many cats was it
29:56
it was quite a lot right i think it was
29:57
many because that's quite i mean
29:59
looking after cats like that and keeping
30:02
them all in one place and making them
30:03
stand in a row
30:04
yeah i think he deserves i reckon that's
30:06
why they ran away they're like this guy
30:08
is a cat whisperer
30:11
i read another thing uh if we're talking
30:13
about pharaohs and the weird things that
30:14
they got up to there was one guy called
30:16
feroz um and he is a pharaoh called
30:20
pharaoh
30:22
yeah so the gnaw was flooding and he got
30:24
very angry about that so he went down to
30:25
it and he threw a spirit it
30:27
as if to say get down and thought he
30:29
could um puncture it maybe
30:31
and the gods were furious that he did
30:32
that so they blinded him and
30:34
as a result um he couldn't see obviously
30:36
he was blind but he really wanted to so
30:38
he spoke to i believe it was an oracle
30:40
and said i want my sight back and she
30:42
said what you have to do is you have to
30:44
wash your eyes
30:45
with the urine of a woman who has never
30:47
slept with anyone but her husband so he
30:50
thought that's easy
30:51
i'll just use my wife's she's
30:54
so it didn't work yeah she got in a lot
30:58
of trouble
30:58
i mean that's just not gonna work anyway
31:01
though is it there is no medical way
31:02
that washing your blind
31:04
eye in urine is ever gonna work you say
31:05
that but he got every woman in town to
31:07
come
31:07
and he sampled that bloody dead yeah
31:10
he sampled their urine and one
31:12
eventually worked and he got his sight
31:13
back
31:14
so egg on your face you're in on your
31:16
face
31:18
it's like the original cinderella really
31:19
isn't it
31:20
[Laughter]
31:23
touring the land we in my eye where in
31:26
my eye
31:26
no it's not this one james bond turns up
31:29
i think i can help with this
31:32
we're gonna have to move on shortly to
31:34
the next fact i just have a fact about
31:36
um
31:36
running that i've wanted to say for a
31:39
while and that is that in ancient times
31:41
in ancient egypt
31:42
they didn't know what your spleen did
31:44
and so they would often
31:46
remove it in long distance runners to
31:47
make them run faster
31:50
this is amazing this is genuinely true
31:52
they they basically it was like a big
31:54
organ and they thought if they got rid
31:55
of it maybe they'll just be a bit
31:56
lighter and you'll be able to run faster
31:58
because they didn't know what it did
32:00
does it
32:01
does it work well let's give it a go
32:05
is paula radcliffe missing a trick here
32:07
so here is the amazing thing
32:09
in 1922 um some scientists at john
32:11
hopkins university
32:13
um removed the spleen from mice and they
32:15
ran faster
32:17
wow okay and no one quite knows what
32:19
causes a stitch
32:21
but one theory is that it's too much
32:24
blood going to your spleen
32:26
but yeah apparently you know it's
32:27
possible that by removing your spleen
32:29
you might not have a stitch as much of
32:30
course you would
32:31
everything that the spleen does you'd be
32:34
in trouble for
32:34
i think the re i mean i don't know if
32:36
this is how you two feeling outside of
32:38
me but i feel like we're all looking at
32:39
you partly thinking
32:40
what a stupid idea apparently thinking
32:42
but what exactly does the spleen do
32:45
yeah i think we're gonna need to check
32:47
the british cycling team for spleens at
32:49
the start of the next season
32:50
but what does explain yourself what does
32:52
it do
32:54
i think it's part of your immune system
32:56
or something
32:57
someone someone will probably 50 people
33:00
will come up and tell us after the show
33:02
and then lots of people will tweet me
33:03
but i think it's something to do with
33:04
your immune system
33:05
okay can i tell you one quick thing
33:07
about an egyptian ferry that i like yeah
33:09
um
33:10
uh the pharaoh's cestras who whenever
33:13
cesaros conquered a city or conquered an
33:15
army
33:15
um if it had been a particularly easy
33:17
conquest then he would the first thing
33:20
he would do was he'd go up to all their
33:21
pillars and he'd draw a
33:23
female genitalia all over them to imply
33:26
that they were a bunch of cowards which
33:27
i know is very anti-feminist but it is
33:29
also
33:30
quite funny
33:35
wow okay it is time for our final fact
33:38
of the show
33:39
and that is chozinski oh yeah my fact
33:43
this week is that
33:44
people who smuggle drugs one way across
33:46
the sahara desert
33:47
often smuggle pasta the other way
33:50
and this is pasta smuggling
33:54
it's a big deal i read this in the
33:56
economist and um so they did a little
33:58
investigation and it turns out that
34:00
if you're trafficking drugs um you have
34:02
these big trucks that take them to where
34:04
you need to drop off the drugs and then
34:05
you got empty trucks
34:06
so you might as well fill them with
34:07
something and so they stuff pasta in
34:09
them
34:10
and it's the drugs go north over the
34:12
sahara
34:13
and then they fill them up with pasta in
34:15
countries like libya or algeria because
34:17
they have subsidized pasture prices so
34:19
it means that pasta is much cheaper
34:20
there
34:20
so they shove their trucks full of
34:22
tagliatelle and then they drive them
34:24
back down through the sahara and deliver
34:26
them
34:26
in uh places like um you know like
34:29
more southern places like the ivory
34:32
coast
34:34
yeah and the economist spoke to an
34:37
expert who reckons that by weight
34:39
pasta is the main product by weight that
34:42
smuggled across the sahara
34:44
wow just because you can make a profit
34:46
on the other side yeah yeah exactly you
34:48
might as well right yes
34:49
but still driving a truck full of pasta
34:51
by yourself across the sahara desert it
34:53
must be a
34:53
cantaloupe life
35:03
mixed mixed reaction
35:06
did you say how they um how they weigh
35:08
marks on the way back
35:10
they put they stick spaghetti sticking
35:12
out of the desert in the sand
35:14
right so when they're going from libya
35:16
to senegal yeah they're putting bits of
35:18
spaghetti in so they know how to get
35:20
back to libya yes yeah
35:21
exactly but how do they see it i don't
35:24
know
35:24
that's the worst color to put as a way
35:26
marker
35:27
on sand it it is weird that it did
35:30
confuse me i wonder if they maybe tape
35:32
lots together so at least it sticks up
35:33
like a pole because spaghetti isn't that
35:35
long unless it's very different
35:36
um in west africa but also when they're
35:38
going the other way do they stick like
35:40
cocaine in the water so in the 13th
35:44
century they have passed guilds in italy
35:46
and they were fighting over the right to
35:47
make pastor and pope got involved
35:50
uh and the pope was just trying to sort
35:52
out tensions and he made a decree
35:54
in 1641 requiring that all pasta shops
35:58
be at least 25 yards apart
36:02
so if you see two pasta shops that are
36:03
closer than that apart
36:05
then that's basically their ex
36:06
communicated basically wow
36:08
just to stop them fighting yeah do you
36:10
know in italy and
36:12
please shout if you're italian or you're
36:13
fluent italian and this isn't true i
36:15
think it was in the new york times but
36:16
initially there's a specific word that
36:18
refers to pastor without salt
36:20
and the word is shioka or shiocha
36:23
and it also means silly so that's the
36:26
word for silly which is also passed
36:28
without salt
36:29
that's a stupid idea
36:32
and in the 19th century they made pasta
36:35
by getting huge troughs full of dough
36:37
and they would trample them like um wine
36:40
like wine grapes
36:41
and that's how you made it really and
36:43
the king of naples wanted to modernize
36:45
and wanted to find a new way of doing it
36:47
and the only way he could find of doing
36:49
it was a huge mechanical man with bronze
36:52
feet
36:55
um last year officials in sudan seized
36:57
more than 70 yous
36:59
with sexual organs sewn onto them
37:02
so what sorry can you so a u is a female
37:06
sheep thanks and they um sewed on
37:09
male sheep sexual organs onto the female
37:12
sheep
37:13
and that's because um you have to pay a
37:15
lot of taxes sorry you have to pay a lot
37:17
of taxes
37:19
seems unfair uh one has to pay a lot of
37:24
tax
37:24
uh for female sheep because they're
37:26
really they're really good and they they
37:27
can make lots of baby sheep and stuff
37:29
but actually male sheep are not that
37:31
important and so if you're sending male
37:33
sheep across
37:34
then you don't have to pay the tax and
37:36
so the way they did it it's got the
37:37
female ones and just put little
37:38
light so some cooking balls on them
37:43
obviously it didn't work in the end
37:44
because they got caught no it didn't
37:46
they got caught
37:47
but we only know the time they got
37:49
caught this might have been happening
37:50
for centuries
37:51
[Laughter]
37:53
it was called owling actually wasn't it
37:55
sheep smuggling that was a version of
37:57
owling
37:58
which was sort of the main version of
37:59
smuggling that existed
38:01
in england specifically from about the
38:04
1300s until the 1800s because
38:06
they didn't want other countries to be
38:09
creating their own wool
38:10
i think and so a lot we smuggled wool
38:12
out of england
38:14
and yeah but confusingly called owling
38:16
we don't know why
38:17
probably to just bewilder customs
38:20
officials
38:21
um i found someone uh which combined uh
38:25
smuggling and pasta in another sense
38:27
okay but i was
38:28
it was turns out to be a very
38:29
disappointing story i'm afraid basically
38:30
in 2012 there were smugglers who tried
38:32
to smuggle
38:33
four million fake cigarettes into the
38:35
west midlands
38:36
and they did so by hiding them in a
38:38
pasta consignment and i was
38:39
really excited and then it turned out
38:41
that they just hid them
38:43
behind caneloni actually but they just
38:46
hit the behind boxes of caneloni rather
38:48
than what i
38:48
assumed they had done which was put the
38:50
fake cigarettes
38:52
inside penne
38:56
i was i kid you not i was so excited
39:01
i'm glad you took us on your emotional
39:02
journey there thank you well it wasn't
39:04
strong on a fact without the emotional
39:06
journey that's the problem
39:07
no i was reading about a modern smuggler
39:10
who i really like a guy called
39:11
robert cusack who's a californian and um
39:14
he was flying home from thailand he'd be
39:16
on holiday in thailand and he was
39:17
undergoing a routine inspection at the
39:19
airport
39:20
when an exotic bird flew out of his bag
39:23
which was awkward and so they searched
39:24
his bags and they found
39:26
three more exotic birds and they also
39:28
found 50 orchids
39:29
and then the security official said do
39:32
you have any other contraband to declare
39:34
and he immediately said yes i've got
39:35
monkeys in my pants
39:38
they pulled down his trousers and he did
39:40
indeed have two pygmy monkeys down his
39:42
pants
39:44
i've got i've got a modern smuggler as
39:46
well called jasmine claire
39:48
and she was um caught off the back of a
39:51
tip that was given to the homeland
39:52
security
39:53
uh it was anonymously given saying that
39:56
there would be possible smuggling
39:57
activity taking place
39:59
in the vicinity of a bed and breakfast
40:01
called the smugglers inn
40:02
[Laughter]
40:05
so they didn't they took it as a real uh
40:07
tip as opposed to thinking that was a
40:09
bad joke and they set up a surveillance
40:11
there
40:11
and they eventually saw someone who was
40:14
doing the uh the smuggling it was
40:16
jasmine claire it turns out
40:17
um they were alerted to the fact it
40:19
might be her because the car that
40:21
arrived
40:21
had the vanity license plate smuggler
40:26
and it was her and she had blocks of
40:28
cocaine nine bricks of cocaine
40:29
that's incredible yeah smugglers in
40:31
smuggler on the license plate
40:33
it's the boldest double bluff i've ever
40:34
heard i'm sorry it didn't work
40:36
so i became a bit obsessed with trying
40:38
to find out i think we're all familiar
40:39
with the term budgie smugglers
40:41
oh yeah okay which are those very tight
40:43
swimsuits
40:44
worn in australia um and elsewhere and i
40:47
became obsessed with trying to find out
40:48
if anyone has ever actually smuggled a
40:50
budgie and
40:52
it was a very long search
40:56
i tried typing in the latin name of the
40:58
species that didn't yield anything
40:59
i did find a paper called the smuggled
41:01
budgie from 2010 very exciting
41:03
etymology paper about the origin of the
41:05
word budgie nightmare
41:07
but this emotional journey is amazing
41:11
but i did find a guy in cuba in 2014 who
41:14
this was pants based as well he was
41:16
detained trying to board a flight to the
41:18
usa with
41:19
66 birds inside his trousers
41:22
and he made it through the metal
41:23
detector obviously birds are not made of
41:25
metal
41:28
so he's doing great but there were loads
41:31
of bulges in his trousers and he was
41:33
stopped in the airport
41:34
and when the police at the authorities
41:37
at the airport stopped him he said
41:38
okay you got me i am concealing a pigeon
41:41
as a gift for my grandson
41:43
in my trousers i presume he thought they
41:45
would say okay fine no questions asked
41:47
go on your way
41:48
police forced him to remove his trousers
41:50
and they found dozens of finches and
41:53
hummingbirds
41:53
hidden inside his trousers and his pants
41:56
and
41:57
yeah and sometimes when people smuggle
41:58
rare birds they have to take their beaks
42:00
shut so they won't
42:02
sing like a canary but also some people
42:05
who smuggle them
42:06
um have their beaks facing inwards on
42:08
the crotch region
42:10
like a massive hostage to fortune why
42:11
would they do that i think it's just
42:13
they're very very small
42:14
um and i think it's the best place to
42:16
hide them maybe it's pleasant who knows
42:19
um but i'm really happy in silicon
42:22
valley within a fortnight of this
42:23
podcast
42:25
i read about that guy and the article
42:26
specified that the two
42:28
birds next to his genitals were dead um
42:32
i don't know what kind of weird toxicity
42:34
was happening there but
42:35
wow he killed two birds with one bone
42:44
we're gonna have to wrap up okay that is
42:47

my name is dan schreiber and i am
00:29
sitting here with anna chazinski andrew
00:31
hunter murray and james harkin and once
00:33
again we have gathered around the
00:35
microphones with our four
00:36
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:38
and in no particular order
00:39
here we go starting with you james
00:42
okay my fact this week is that the world
00:45
record for most beer mats
00:47
flipped and caught in one hand is held
00:50
by a man called matt
00:51
hand
00:56
stunning
00:59
it's incredible it just can't be true
01:03
and it is and it's it's we didn't
01:05
believe it when he sent it to us
01:07
send you the link to the guinness world
01:09
records and there it is yeah
01:11
um so guys i got in touch with matt han
01:14
today no
01:15
yes hey he is a lovely man by the way
01:18
and
01:18
um he gave me a list of all of his world
01:20
records
01:21
and i sent him some q and a's and asked
01:23
him some questions and he sent me some
01:25
answers
01:26
um the first thing i want to say is i
01:28
asked him when you brought the world
01:29
record for beer mat flipping
01:31
did you consider the appness of your
01:33
name for that record
01:35
and he said and i don't know if this is
01:37
true he said i actually changed my name
01:39
to matt hand after i broke the record
01:41
no what
01:45
that's what he said i don't know if
01:46
that's true what's his real name
01:48
he didn't say i said that can't be true
01:50
and then he mysteriously didn't reply to
01:52
my next email
01:53
i put two questions he answered the
01:55
other one and didn't answer that so i
01:57
don't know if it's true but the mat
01:58
is only one t yeah so it could be that
02:01
he did because he's a performance artist
02:03
actually he lives in berlin now he lived
02:05
in the uk for a while he lived in
02:06
nottingham when he did this
02:08
and he kind of thinks that breaking a
02:11
world record is a bit like a work of
02:12
performance art
02:14
he's basically saying you know that
02:15
people want to make the
02:17
mark on the world and there are lots of
02:19
different ways of doing it and one way
02:20
of doing it is by getting in the
02:21
guinness book of records
02:22
that's true and a lot of the things that
02:24
he does he um invites people to watch
02:27
him
02:27
try and break the world record so he um
02:29
had the world record of the longest
02:30
table tennis rally
02:32
for five hours eight minutes and 22
02:34
seconds and he sold tickets for that
02:38
wow did he well did he sell tickets for
02:40
that or did he
02:41
put them on sale i suppose you wouldn't
02:44
know how long it was going to last do
02:45
you
02:46
that's true like if we did the world's
02:47
longest podcast now i wonder how long
02:50
people would stay
02:51
well the doors are locked and we're
02:53
about to find out
02:54
start the clock
02:59
there was a sort of a rash of uh grape
03:01
catching records in the 80s and 90s that
03:03
was a big thing for a little while
03:05
so um there was a a guy who dropped a
03:08
grape
03:09
uh from a 38 story building what he had
03:12
got his friend
03:12
his name was paul tavilla and he says
03:15
i think he may have written this it was
03:17
launching him into grape catching fame
03:19
it's his website um but yeah 38 stories
03:23
of red grape
03:24
from 38 stories he caught it in his
03:25
mouth no that's amazing
03:27
i would argue that once you've got that
03:29
high it doesn't really matter if you go
03:30
higher does it because it's going to
03:32
reach its terminal velocity of a grape i
03:34
mean that can only be a few flaws yeah
03:36
so you know i reckon i could do one
03:38
floor if i can do that i reckon i could
03:40
do one floor higher is it a sight thing
03:41
is it maybe at 39 feet it doesn't say
03:44
how many grapes are around him smashed
03:45
on the ground
03:46
yeah that's a thing yeah they could have
03:48
dropped 300 at the same time that's true
03:50
actually because when um
03:52
when matt hand beat this world record
03:53
for a number of beer mats flipped and
03:56
caught it was 112 that he managed
03:58
112. she's sorry it's not at the same
04:01
time
04:01
yeah what yeah no one's got hands down
04:05
you know what it does sound a lot
04:07
doesn't it
04:10
but i suppose i suppose that's why it's
04:11
a record it's like if i said
04:14
you know if i say usain bolt ran 100
04:16
meters in 9.7 seconds or 9.5 seconds
04:19
you'd be like
04:19
9.5 seconds if i said he did it in two
04:22
minutes you wouldn't be impressed at all
04:23
but if you said he ran it
04:25
i'd say why is he famous
04:28
if you did it in one second this feels
04:30
like a one second hundred meter sprint
04:32
hundred i'm not sure that's as tall as
04:34
you or i no it isn't
04:36
a very thick beer mats but he he took a
04:39
lot of times to do it is what i was
04:41
going to say because you were saying
04:42
about the grape thing
04:43
he took more than 100 attempts and i
04:46
said to him did you ever consider giving
04:47
up after more than 100 failures
04:49
and he said failure is a redundant
04:51
concept in conceptual art a great quote
04:56
from a great man
04:57
[Laughter]
05:00
i only looked at beer mats for this oh
05:02
cool yeah
05:04
i know a lot about beer mats now did you
05:06
know that the original beer mats
05:08
were for uh they were coasters for
05:10
sliding wine around
05:12
so and this is the thing that the first
05:14
time the word coaster
05:15
was used was in 18th century britain
05:18
and it was for moving wine around after
05:20
the servants have been dismissed so if
05:22
you're having kind of a
05:23
posh dinner then at one point you
05:25
dismiss the servants and you dismiss the
05:27
women
05:27
and so there was no one to hand the wine
05:29
around the table and so
05:31
this thing was invented which you still
05:32
have today which was the thing that
05:34
slides
05:34
the decanter around the table and it
05:36
used to have little wheels on the bottom
05:39
the men drinking their brandy could just
05:41
nudge it to the other end of the table
05:43
and that's why it's like coasting
05:44
like coasting yeah on the coast of the
05:47
table
05:48
because it would go around the edge of
05:49
it i heard that the original beer mats
05:51
used to be placed on top of glasses
05:53
and then because the idea was to keep
05:55
insects and so on and poison
05:58
out of your i don't think it wasn't
06:00
poison was it
06:01
i'd been watching a lot of game of
06:02
thrones recently
06:04
but yeah and then it slowly graduated to
06:06
the bottom of the glass it wasn't
06:08
it was it was how was there ever a
06:10
period where it was in the middle of the
06:11
glass on the side
06:15
this that is true though to an extent is
06:17
the
06:18
kind of invention of beer mats comes
06:20
from german tankards
06:22
which used to have lids on them and you
06:24
would kind of they were lids on a hinge
06:26
on top of the beer which stopped it
06:27
spilling so they stopped it messing up
06:28
the table
06:29
and you would kind of flip the lid with
06:30
your thumb like you kind of do with milk
06:32
jugs now
06:32
you still get those in germany don't you
06:34
yeah yeah um and then
06:36
people would not be wealthy enough to
06:37
have the lids and so the coast is
06:39
migrated down to the bottom but i just
06:41
it's just incredible to think people who
06:43
was the first genius to do that
06:45
to look at the coaster and say i know
06:46
where that should go instead
06:48
yeah there's no poison around there are
06:50
no insects around i'm going to try it
06:52
it's incredible um there is a beer mat
06:54
which orders a drink for you
06:57
so it's it's been invented by some
06:58
german researchers
07:00
and it orders a new drink for you when
07:01
your it senses yours is running low
07:03
sounds really good it measures the
07:04
weight of your drink and the weight of
07:05
your glass right
07:06
yeah is it and is it when it's empty or
07:08
when it's sort of a quarter full
07:10
because i don't know because some of us
07:12
drink faster than others
07:14
yeah and what if you don't want another
07:16
drink does it just keep ordering it
07:18
sorry i don't understand
07:19
[Laughter]
07:21
do you know one thing that i thought was
07:22
quite interesting which is the reason
07:24
that beer mats kind of came
07:26
to became very popular is the invention
07:28
of refrigeration and so
07:31
people had ice on mass like poorer
07:33
people had ice because you have a fridge
07:35
now
07:35
and then that meant that a lot of
07:37
condensation happened on drinks and so
07:39
that meant the condensation dribbled
07:40
down the edge
07:41
and meant you needed a beer mat so a lot
07:43
of them are made in germany aren't they
07:44
i think the biggest
07:45
beer mat producer is in germany um still
07:49
and the people who make beer mats they
07:51
also make the
07:52
pretend wood circular disks that are
07:54
found in packets of camembert
07:56
yeah and also the thin sheets of board
07:59
found at the back of some wardrobes
08:03
it's good that isn't it that you know
08:05
it's good that you can kind of do a few
08:06
different things yeah it's really clever
08:08
diversifying although i read that and
08:10
i've never seen the sheet of board at
08:11
the back of my wardrobe
08:12
have you ever no anna's gone straight to
08:15
narnia doesn't it
08:18
but this place is amazing so this is the
08:20
cats group in the black forest in
08:22
germany isn't it
08:22
and um they make an unbelievable number
08:25
of beer mats so it turns out we go
08:26
through loads they make about 75
08:28
of the world's beer mats um which
08:30
amounts to 5.5 billion a year
08:33
they can make 12 million beer amounts in
08:35
one day
08:37
which is so many beer mats and there's
08:39
too many to flip
08:40
isn't it even for this guy he can he
08:41
couldn't do it um
08:43
their website says the very first thing
08:45
you see if you go to the cat's website
08:46
is
08:47
you could argue that we only make one
08:49
thing a material based on wood pulp but
08:51
we do do that one thing
08:52
outstandingly well which they do and my
08:56
favorite thing about their factory is
08:57
that they have
08:57
what they call a debarking machine so
09:00
beer mats are made from kind of pulped
09:01
wood that's like sent through all these
09:03
processes and then can be flattened out
09:05
and the debarking machine is where they
09:06
put huge tree trunks and it's like a
09:08
giant washing machine
09:10
and they close the door and they just
09:11
spin it round around around and then the
09:12
bark or gradually comes off
09:14
which i think is really cool another
09:16
thing you can do with beer mats is you
09:18
can make little towers with them
09:19
couldn't you
09:20
yeah yeah like you put them like a
09:22
playing cards you can make them
09:23
on big big towers and they have world
09:26
records for these as well
09:27
um but what the sad thing is if you get
09:29
one that you think is a world record
09:31
then the only way you can tell is by
09:33
knocking it down you have to knock it
09:35
down to get the record
09:36
and that is to prove that there was no
09:38
adhesive used when you were building it
09:40
um so the world record was 300 000
09:43
coasters
09:44
to create sorry whoa no way
09:47
absolute way how to how tall is that
09:51
well if you think that a hundred is the
09:53
height of you and me yeah
09:56
the chrysler building that's massive i
09:59
i mean i just don't believe that i just
10:01
flat out
10:02
believe that i mean it's the most
10:03
amazing achievement ever known
10:06
it's it's written unsassed on this piece
10:08
of paper so it must be true
10:09
all right um it was a guinness world
10:11
record by sven
10:13
goebbel cool the goebbels famously
10:15
strong on propaganda james
10:20
this will be the thing to rescue the
10:21
family name i know it
10:22
[Laughter]
10:26
we're gonna have to move on shortly to
10:28
our next fact can i just tell you one
10:30
more thing about beer mat
10:31
yeah yeah um so in 2004 the
10:34
some christians tried to find the 11th
10:36
commandment via beer mats
10:38
so this was a push by a bunch of
10:40
methodists the methodist church
10:42
to find the 11th commandment and they
10:44
advertised for it on beer mats it was
10:46
attempt to
10:46
attract the young to the church and um
10:49
they produced 250
10:51
000 beer mats saying please let us know
10:53
what you think the 11th commandment
10:55
should be
10:56
and it was really controversial so a lot
10:58
of other christians said that
11:00
we didn't need an 11th commandment there
11:01
was someone called the reverend john
11:02
roberts
11:03
who said that 10 were enough and
11:05
actually if we lived by those 10
11:07
we wouldn't need this kind of gimmick um
11:10
but the reverend who planned it said
11:12
that he hoped that people will want to
11:14
collect the drinks mats discuss them
11:16
with friends
11:17
and use the quick and popular meeting of
11:19
text messaging to tell us their ideas
11:21
which is sweet and so they did this and
11:24
there were a list of winners and
11:25
what was the oh so there was more than
11:27
one when there were like five winners
11:28
um so what do we have to not do so the
11:31
eleventh commandment
11:33
is it's a toss-up between thou shalt not
11:36
confuse text with love
11:38
and this is my favorite thou shalt not
11:41
consume thine own body weight in fudge
11:46
very nice that's a hard one
11:51
we're all sinners we're all sinners
11:52
james we've all done it
11:54
i reckon i could get through life not
11:56
coveting my neighbor's arms
11:57
[Laughter]
11:59
um okay let's move on to our second fact
12:01
and that is
12:02
andy my fact is that pandas have their
12:05
own harvard
12:06
um so
12:13
it's true that pandas have their own
12:14
harvard so this is from a magazine i
12:16
read called delayed gratification
12:17
quarterly
12:18
um which i kid you not is so good it
12:21
arrives every three months and the news
12:22
is at least three months old and it's
12:24
riveting
12:25
so they ran a feature all about the
12:26
practice of rewilding pandas you know
12:28
when you
12:29
train a panda that's been born into
12:30
captivity and you train it to survive
12:32
on its own in the wild and the the they
12:35
have something which
12:36
they uh the scientists who work on this
12:37
call panda harvard
12:39
because they gradually get moved um
12:41
through training camps
12:42
to uh wilder and wilder arenas so from
12:46
the completely
12:46
so they start in like panda kindergarten
12:49
exactly
12:50
and then they work the way through panda
12:51
primary school and a secondary school
12:53
panda sixth farm yep and then panda
12:56
harvard
12:57
uh and it's it's this 200 hectare dojo
13:00
where they do their final training
13:01
before they go out into the world
13:03
it's true are you sure you didn't watch
13:05
kung fu panda
13:07
so the training program involves finding
13:10
water independently
13:11
finding natural shelter staying vigilant
13:13
um identifying enemies and avoiding
13:15
danger and if they fail any one of the
13:17
elements of the course they get busted
13:18
back down to panda's school
13:21
so yeah and if they if they pass panda
13:22
harvard they are released into the world
13:24
and only i think seven
13:25
pandas have ever passed really yeah it's
13:28
it's hard to pass isn't it
13:29
so uh because it is very important that
13:31
we well
13:32
there's a lot of effort that goes into
13:34
trying to make panda survive in the
13:35
world and make them breed and if they're
13:37
not going to survive it's pointless so
13:39
i think in their enclosures they're
13:40
given a stuffed leopard at one point
13:42
that's put into the enclosure and if a
13:44
panda runs up to the stuffed leopard and
13:46
sniffs it
13:47
it fails forever it's in captivity
13:50
forevermore
13:51
yeah yeah it's not like it's done well
13:54
you could learn that can't you
13:56
well if you don't show the instinct i'm
13:58
afraid you're out
13:59
um you have to be able to climb as a
14:01
panda you have to master the solo climb
14:04
and if you can't do that you fail
14:05
because that's the only way pandas can
14:06
escape predators because they're
14:07
generally quite slow
14:08
solo climb would you watch i would watch
14:12
panda gladiators like a shot
14:15
but it is hard and that leopard is
14:16
stuffed full of leopard excrement so it
14:18
smells
14:19
like a real leopard okay yeah and and
14:22
and um their eyesight is so bad that if
14:25
they react
14:25
uh correctly to a fake leopard they'll
14:27
probably react directly to a real
14:28
leopard
14:29
yeah yeah well the thing is that the
14:31
humans all dress as pandas don't they
14:34
so if you're like the equivalent of the
14:36
professors in harvard
14:37
they're all dressed in what black and
14:39
white panda suits that have been smeared
14:40
with
14:41
um panda pants feces there are a lot of
14:44
people wondering what happened to their
14:45
lives
14:47
in the long pounder enclosure but yeah
14:49
that's true because they're never
14:50
allowed to come into contact with anyone
14:52
that resembles a human
14:53
yeah are they and they're always watched
14:56
by 200 closed circuit cameras so it's a
14:58
bit like panda big brother
15:00
wow would you watch that i would would
15:03
you watch basically any tv show that had
15:05
pandas instead of humans
15:07
i'd definitely watch panda driving
15:08
school
15:08
[Laughter]
15:11
um well so some of them get really good
15:13
though so for example there were two
15:14
released in november 2017
15:16
very recently they were called bashi and
15:18
ying shui
15:19
and they got so good that they spent
15:21
several days on the run
15:22
in the wildest enclosure and their their
15:25
um
15:26
human handlers had to lure them back
15:27
with treats there's a thing where
15:29
um they've noticed a lot of pandas in
15:31
the wild immediately
15:32
start acting in ways that they really
15:34
wish they acted in enclosures for
15:36
example
15:37
mating is a big thing that's problem
15:38
with in the zoos and so on
15:40
which they've got no libido and they
15:42
can't manage to get them to to mate
15:44
um there's been in china not too long
15:46
ago in chengdu they've been
15:48
testing new methods about how to get
15:50
pandas to start
15:51
building a libido and mating and one of
15:54
the things that they've been testing is
15:55
they've been playing
15:56
panda porn to pandas on a tv
16:00
so they i would not watch porn if it was
16:02
pandas
16:05
but that's a genuine thing so they have
16:07
a tv in the enclosure
16:08
and they've filmed panda's having sex
16:10
and they just have that on a loop with
16:12
the sounds and so on
16:13
with pandas watching it hoping that that
16:15
turns them i don't think it really works
16:16
that well does it
16:18
no no it doesn't no they tried loads of
16:21
different things they don't
16:22
hardly anything works have they tried
16:25
storylines
16:26
like a panda turning up who's a plumber
16:28
when her husband's out
16:30
yeah she's thinking about a divorce
16:34
anyway
16:34
i don't know who fitted this bamboo
16:40
another thing they tried was artificial
16:42
insemination which was
16:44
pretty bad actually because the male
16:46
pandas had to be anesthetized and then
16:48
stimulated into ejaculating with the
16:50
help of an electric probe placed in
16:52
their rectums
16:53
look there's no shame in that james
16:56
[Laughter]
17:02
you know he's on past the andy panda
17:04
hybrid baby we're expecting in nine
17:06
months time
17:07
no panda females andrew murray sorry
17:11
sorry no no it's all right i think it
17:13
was a worthwhile interruption
17:17
panda females often give birth to twins
17:19
and but they can't look after more than
17:21
one baby
17:22
which is the great tragedy of pandas so
17:24
they let the other one die
17:25
um which is really sad but yeah because
17:27
they are literally incapable
17:29
of looking after two children they're so
17:31
not meant to survive but in captivity
17:33
the twins get a surrogate mother so
17:35
there's a person who's dressed up as a
17:36
panda
17:37
who acts as the twins mother until it's
17:39
ready to survive in the wild
17:41
and then it's fine margaret thatcher
17:44
didn't like pandas turns out
17:46
no they've just released some documents
17:48
under the 30-year rule
17:49
and it's her being asked by some press
17:51
people would you share concord with a
17:53
panda
17:55
that sounds like it's just a random
17:57
question that she was asked by sir
17:59
would you rather share concord with a
18:00
panda or the royal train
18:02
with a llama she said no they actually
18:05
wanted her to get into concord with a
18:07
panda didn't they yeah they did because
18:09
panda had to get to wherever she was
18:10
going at the same time yeah and they
18:12
thought it would be a good kind of press
18:14
thing didn't they yeah and she might
18:15
have a picture taken with it and she
18:16
wrote back saying
18:17
i am not double underlined taking a
18:19
panda with me
18:20
pandas and politicians are not happy
18:22
omens
18:24
and we don't know why wow how tragic
18:27
such a well-loved figure we suddenly
18:29
find out that
18:30
pandas well it was to do slightly with
18:33
panda diplomacy wasn't it so there was
18:35
the whole thing of handing over pandas
18:37
as
18:37
presents to the west and uh it turns out
18:40
that that stopped in 1984
18:42
we now have things where if there's a
18:45
panda in a zoo it's on loan
18:47
it's like a and it costs them any
18:49
country that has them about a million a
18:50
year now
18:51
in order to just keep the panda in their
18:53
own zoos and that's that's official any
18:55
panda
18:56
around the world if it's from china they
18:57
all belong to china don't they yeah and
18:59
if you um if they give birth
19:01
that baby belongs to china as well do
19:03
you know the first panda that left china
19:05
left it as a dog so is that like a
19:08
disguise or something
19:09
sort of it was this amazing woman this
19:11
is the 1930s it was actually quite a
19:13
long time before we stumbled across
19:14
pandas in the west and decided we wanted
19:16
them
19:16
in the 1930s a woman called ruth
19:18
harkness her husband died and he'd been
19:20
determined to bring some pandas from
19:22
china to the us
19:23
and so she pursued his aims she found a
19:26
baby panda she fed it on like human baby
19:28
formula
19:29
she tried to bring it back uh and get
19:32
the ship from
19:33
china uh back to the u.s but when she
19:35
tried to board the ship they said you've
19:36
got a panda with you you can't take a
19:38
panda
19:38
and so she stayed with it in quarantine
19:40
overnight and
19:42
you know refused to go on the ship
19:43
without it and eventually they said we
19:44
just don't know what to do because the
19:46
paperwork it does not allow for pandas
19:48
and so the panda left as one dog come at
19:51
20
19:52
and that was the records in china show
19:55
one dog left china in 1936. that's
19:58
so cool it is true actually that we
20:00
didn't really know about pandas in the
20:01
west for a long time did we i think it
20:03
was 1969.
20:05
what um until then for a long for about
20:08
50 years they were effectively encrypted
20:10
they were like um the loch ness monster
20:12
like people knew that they people were
20:14
saying that they existed but no one had
20:16
seen one in the west but in the us in
20:18
the 1930s there was like a panda mania
20:20
sorry
20:21
i said 18 18 18
20:24
1965 well we've landed on the moon now
20:27
it's time
20:29
to nail this panda myth once and for all
20:33
you can see the great will of china
20:35
what's that on the great wall of china
20:39
uh speaking of panda dogs have you guys
20:41
heard of panda cows
20:44
this is very cool this is uh this is a
20:45
genuine thing that happens amongst
20:47
breeders of miniature cows
20:50
there's a certain group of people who
20:52
because it's a black and white animal
20:54
try and breed a panda cow which is to
20:57
have the
20:58
black and white fur markings to match
21:00
exactly how a panda would have it and
21:02
there's only between
21:03
30 and 40 on the planet and there's a
21:06
number of animals that they try this
21:07
with
21:08
in in different various fields with
21:10
rabbits there's an impossible rabbit
21:11
that people try to breed
21:12
and one of those things is in the cow
21:14
world is panda cow
21:16
so wait so they're not trying to make a
21:17
panda with a cow obviously they're
21:18
trying to breed a cow that has the
21:20
markings of a panda
21:21
so it has like the black eyes it has the
21:22
black eye it has the stripe right around
21:25
which is very hard to get sorry i zoned
21:27
out why are they doing this you zoned
21:29
out
21:31
just in the middle where you i think
21:33
andy was speaking for a lot of the
21:34
audience
21:35
jesus but what just why because it's
21:38
hard because
21:39
yeah because it's an impossible task so
21:41
if you manage to do it it's an
21:42
incredibly rare miniature cow that you
21:44
can sell for
21:45
hundreds of thousands possibly if you if
21:47
you wanted to so
21:48
we need to move on surely guys well just
21:49
one more thing about rewilding
21:51
yeah um and introductions to the world
21:53
you might have seen the story it's about
21:54
a gannett called nigel
21:56
who has just died this year and he
21:58
became famous because he spent the last
21:59
four years
22:00
courting a concrete decoy gannet which
22:03
had been put on his island they were
22:05
trying to lure more gannets to the
22:06
island
22:06
and this was a huge effort they put
22:08
loads of concrete gannets on there
22:10
and there were 80 and he got a
22:11
girlfriend who was made of concrete
22:13
and he was the researchers researching
22:15
him called him nigel because he had no
22:17
mates
22:18
i know and he died just as three real
22:21
living birds joined the colony and he
22:23
decided he didn't want to go and mate
22:25
with the actual living
22:26
female birds he stayed with his concrete
22:27
girlfriend until he died
22:29
i think that's quite romantic actually
22:30
it's romantic i respect that
22:32
yeah i there's also
22:33
[Laughter]
22:36
well you're going out with that bollard
22:38
at the moment aren't you
22:40
um there's also the um black-footed
22:42
ferret
22:43
which was once thought extinct which
22:45
we're trying to bring back into the wild
22:46
and there's a conservation center in
22:48
colorado for this ferret so it's
22:49
extremely rare
22:51
and again they have this kind of school
22:52
to try and prepare them for the wild so
22:54
that they can survive there
22:55
and you have to prepare them for
22:57
predators and for mating and stuff
22:59
and so for the blackfooted ferret in
23:00
colorado at their kind of prep school
23:03
they have stuffed raptors that swoop
23:06
down
23:06
on one of the human keepers arms that
23:09
they have to defend themselves against
23:11
they also have a robo badger which
23:15
is a mechanized i would watch that film
23:17
[Laughter]
23:19
it's a mechanized badger and they drive
23:22
it around the pens of these black-footed
23:23
ferrets and they hoped that the
23:24
blackfooted ferrets would instinctually
23:26
try and avoid it and run away from it
23:28
and it turned out it didn't work
23:29
the ferrets immediately started riding
23:31
on the back of them
23:37
okay let's move on to fact number three
23:39
it's time for fact number three and that
23:41
is my fact
23:42
my fact this week is that the american
23:44
flag was designed
23:46
by a 17 year old student and his teacher
23:50
gave him a b minus for it so this was
23:53
back in 1958
23:55
this is when america had 48
23:58
states back when the panda was still a
24:00
distant myth
24:05
okay 1958 uh there was a
24:08
student called robert heft and as part
24:11
of a
24:12
school project his teacher wanted them
24:14
to make something that inspired them
24:16
and uh he decided that he wanted to make
24:19
an american flag but he wanted to make
24:20
an american flag that had 50 stars on it
24:23
because there'd been lots of
24:24
uh talk about alaska and hawaii joining
24:27
estates
24:28
so he handed in his project to school
24:31
he'd re-sown
24:32
one of his parents flags with two extra
24:34
stars and
24:35
i he sort of moved it around so it made
24:37
sense and it was a lovely design
24:39
and his teacher said there's only 48
24:42
states you idiot what is
24:43
this ridiculous and gave him a b minus
24:46
so he then said to his teacher um well
24:49
i'm going to submit this flag
24:51
if the states get added and if i submit
24:54
it and we get it
24:55
made the official flag will you remark
24:57
me and he said yeah sure whatever
24:59
a year later president eisenhower was
25:01
calling him up to say
25:03
we've made your flag the official flag
25:05
of america and he had his
25:07
mark remarked to an a really yeah
25:10
yeah that's because i read which is
25:13
flawed obviously
25:14
that um it was he was marked down for
25:16
lack of imagination which i actually
25:17
would agree with because all he did was
25:19
add two stars to the existing flag
25:22
um but okay he was adding the new the
25:24
new starts because a lot of people did
25:25
submit their entries didn't they to
25:27
eisenhower when it was discovered that
25:29
you know new states were going to be
25:30
added and a lot of the other suggestions
25:32
are
25:32
better and there is a book called old
25:34
glory yeah
25:35
the other suggestions in them but so the
25:37
question is you go who's a teacher that
25:39
would give this boy a b minus what pratt
25:41
would do that
25:42
um stanley pratt is the name of the
25:44
teacher who did that
25:46
uh and uh very kindly gave him an a but
25:49
this guy heft he also designed a 51 star
25:51
flag
25:52
just in case another state joins the
25:53
union yeah sadly he died recently and
25:55
all the way up to 60 actually
25:58
yeah so he's kind of thought well i
26:00
nailed it with a 50.
26:02
that's amazing but what are the 60
26:04
that's that so um puerto rico is
26:06
supposed to be the next one if that
26:07
you know they're trying to get enough
26:09
yeah right and then probably
26:11
russia
26:14
newt gingrich when he was running
26:17
against i believe it was
26:19
uh bill clinton or was it george bush
26:22
he proposed that he wanted a new star on
26:24
the flag within his tenure as president
26:27
if he made it which was going to be the
26:28
moon
26:29
he believed that we were that was
26:31
genuinely he sat in a press conference
26:33
near nasa and he said i want the moon to
26:34
be it and i
26:36
i realized the only way you can get it
26:38
on the place is if you have 13
26:40
000 votes so we need to colonize mars
26:43
and the moon get 13 000 people on there
26:45
and then
26:45
but he was saying this in a serious way
26:47
and yet he still feels like a great loss
26:49
to the presidential race
26:52
[Music]
26:53
this is not as uncommon as you think so
26:55
the australian flag was based on design
26:57
submitted by a 14 year old
26:59
um so yeah and there were loads of
27:02
designs submitted one of them
27:03
i really wish we'd seen this was a team
27:05
of native animals playing cricket
27:09
so like the wallabies are fielding and
27:11
the the ostrich is bowling the kangaroos
27:13
holding a wombat
27:14
[Laughter]
27:18
yeah that was in 1901 wasn't it early
27:20
example of crowdsourcing and there were
27:22
loads of really cool entries so there
27:24
was one entry that had a kangaroo with
27:26
six
27:27
tails to represent all six states
27:30
another one apparently weirdly had a
27:32
what was described as a fat kangaroo
27:35
aiming a gun
27:36
at the southern cross constellation
27:38
which seems quite weird
27:39
but in the end the thing that one uh
27:41
which a variation of which exists today
27:43
is something that five different people
27:45
submitted which again shows lack of
27:47
imagination so and also they had to
27:48
split the prize money five ways
27:51
so they should have gone with a fat
27:52
kangaroo right there is
27:54
actually and i think we've mentioned it
27:55
before there is a flag that has a gun on
27:57
it
27:58
uh for a country mozambique which has an
28:00
ak-47
28:01
on its flag yeah there was a campaign to
28:04
get rid of it um
28:05
in like the early 2000s and actually the
28:08
mozambique president said no it kind of
28:10
represents our
28:11
past and you know the struggle that it
28:13
took to get there
28:14
because a lot of the red on a lot of
28:15
flags represents blood
28:17
and especially in a lot of african flags
28:20
the red represents kind of the bloodshed
28:22
that it took to gain independence
28:24
and the green represents like the
28:25
fertility of the land and stuff but
28:27
all those colors mean really significant
28:29
things almost no flags have purple on
28:31
them because
28:31
purple was such a rare color for such a
28:33
long time so i think we've mentioned
28:35
before
28:35
it took uh in the roman times only
28:38
emperors or yeah emperors wear um purple
28:41
together because it was made out of
28:43
snails
28:44
and it took ten thousand snails to make
28:46
a gram of the dye
28:47
it was very very rare stuff and they
28:49
take ages to get into the machine as
28:51
well
28:55
that is good so maybe if there's some
28:56
new countries that come along they might
28:58
go for purple
28:59
yes they should yeah you know um when
29:02
the american so the stars and stripes
29:04
came along when america came along and
29:07
obviously a star is added for every new
29:09
state
29:10
but in so 1793 i think the original flag
29:14
came about and it was the 13 colonies
29:16
and it was 13 stripes and 13 stars
29:18
and then in 1795 two stars and two
29:22
stripes were added
29:23
because kentucky and vermont became
29:25
states and so
29:26
initially it was supposed to be a new
29:28
stripe product was added each time
29:30
and it was only in so of course then
29:32
after that in
29:33
the 30 years after that loads and loads
29:35
of new states came
29:36
and um i think it was um
29:40
monroe president munro who said in 1818
29:43
we had to stop with the stripes thing
29:45
because we can't fit that many stripes
29:46
on a flag
29:47
and said we'll go back to 13 stripes and
29:49
then any number of stars
29:51
that's so funny it's good isn't it we
29:53
might have 50 stripes on the flag right
29:54
now but the thing is they
29:56
kind of didn't really care about their
29:57
flag for quite a long time didn't they
29:59
really the only reason they got it is
30:01
because u.s ships needed one to sail
30:03
into foreign ports
30:04
so they needed a flag for that
30:05
particular reason and it's not the kind
30:08
of big sort of nationalistic thing that
30:10
it is now it was just
30:11
for just for that really they had a load
30:13
of different versions at the time as
30:15
well for on ships
30:16
so they had one flag which was just a
30:18
pine tree so it's just a blue background
30:20
and a pine tree
30:21
and that was because pine was a major
30:22
export from the u.s to britain
30:25
and a bit like the um boston tea party
30:27
there was a big riot about pine
30:30
at one stage boston tree party
30:35
that deserved more than that guys i
30:37
don't know
30:39
we need to move on shortly to the left
30:41
oh i have a flag hero
30:42
okay such a cool guy he was he was the
30:45
us flag expert as in
30:46
he was called whitney smith um he was so
30:49
obsessed with flags the
30:50
the term for the study of flags is
30:52
vexillology he came up with that word
30:55
and he got flack for it because it's
30:57
half latin and half greek vexillum is
30:58
lassen ology is greek yeah
31:00
i'm with the rest of the world here okay
31:03
well he said
31:04
i've been criticized because it combines
31:05
latin and greek a barbarism
31:07
but i say i was a teenager
31:10
and we all do crazy stuff when we're
31:11
teenagers don't we
31:12
[Laughter]
31:14
and he he designed the flag for guyana
31:16
because he was so keen to know what the
31:17
country's new flag was going to be when
31:19
it got independence that he wrote to the
31:20
president and said what's your flag
31:21
going to be
31:22
and the president wrote back saying we
31:23
haven't thought about it we've been busy
31:24
becoming independent
31:25
any ideas and he said yeah how about
31:27
this and then they accepted that
31:29
that's really so cool but i read that
31:31
they didn't tell him so his sister
31:33
reminisced that he had no idea he just
31:36
sent off this thing which i think his
31:37
he wrote drew a design and his mom
31:39
knitted it into an actual flag and sent
31:41
it off
31:42
and then a few years later the whole
31:44
family were like oh that's weird the
31:45
guyana flag
31:46
looks a lot like the thing that we
31:48
designed and he wrote to the government
31:49
and said that looks like my flag design
31:51
and they said i've been trying to get in
31:52
touch with you for ages
31:53
[Laughter]
31:56
i read similarly i read that nelson
31:58
mandela when they were when they were
31:59
designing a new south african flag
32:01
the person there was thousands again of
32:03
designs and
32:04
the person that they went this is the
32:05
one to go for faxed it through so that
32:07
they could see it
32:08
but when it came through it was black
32:09
and white so mandela had to send his
32:12
team out to get crayons to come back
32:14
and color it in to show him exactly the
32:16
style that's true because actually that
32:18
wouldn't have been a good uh symbol for
32:19
a nation sharply divided into black and
32:21
white
32:22
[Laughter]
32:26
okay it is time for our final fact of
32:30
the show
32:30
and that is chozinski my fact this week
32:34
is that the inventor of water skiing
32:36
started out
32:37
being pulled along behind a boat
32:39
standing on his head on a wooden chair
32:42
this is the original water skiing this
32:44
is a guy called ralph samuelson and i
32:46
think i read this in sports illustrated
32:48
and like a really good long weird piece
32:50
they did but um yeah this is in 1922 he
32:52
was in minnesota
32:54
on lake pepin which is part of the
32:56
mississippi and he
32:57
just got really into sort of putting big
32:59
blacks of wood in the water and standing
33:00
on them and being pulled along
33:02
behind boats driven by his brother and
33:04
he experimented with lots of different
33:05
things and he especially liked to ride
33:08
while either balancing on a friend's
33:09
shoulders or
33:11
standing on his head on a chair so
33:13
that's that's what he did
33:14
he's like the opposite of a beer coaster
33:16
and that he started the wrong way up and
33:17
then he ended the right way up
33:19
yes yes i think people often call him
33:23
um actually he started off on an ice
33:26
boat didn't he because
33:27
um that would freeze over a lot so they
33:29
had a nice boat that would go through
33:31
the um
33:32
frozen water and he would go on actual
33:34
skis and then he thought when the um
33:36
the ice went away you thought maybe i
33:37
could do this on the water
33:39
because it's just hot ice
33:41
[Laughter]
33:46
can i have a glass of tap hot ice please
33:49
with some cold eyes in it actually if
33:51
that's okay
33:52
[Laughter]
33:54
and he didn't patent it did he no and
33:56
someone else swooped in and did yeah it
33:58
was fred walla who patented it
34:00
and his product was called dolphin aqua
34:02
skis
34:03
and fred waller also invented widescreen
34:05
motion pictures
34:07
really what exactly yeah just like
34:10
cinerama
34:11
i think yeah oh wow what i quite like
34:14
about uh ralph samuelson is in
34:16
when you're when you're water skiing any
34:18
new move that you do is often
34:20
through the chaos of falling over and
34:22
recovering and getting back up so
34:24
um there are many moves where people
34:26
tripped over and they
34:28
uh landed on their bum and suddenly
34:30
they're like wow i'm still on my bum
34:32
this is this could be a move and then
34:33
they get back up to their feet
34:34
so ralph samuelson as well as inventing
34:37
this
34:38
water skiing on two skis he was one day
34:40
on the two skis going along and the wake
34:42
of the boat came over and he got
34:44
launched into the air
34:45
and one of the skis left his feet and he
34:48
landed back down on one ski and put his
34:50
foot
34:51
on the front of it and suddenly invented
34:54
the one ski
34:54
slalom that happens on border skiing so
34:57
it was just yeah just all by accident
34:59
was he
34:59
is he creating yeah and i mean he
35:02
invented
35:02
a kind of water skiing which i imagine
35:04
exists now just being pulled along by a
35:06
plane
35:06
so he actually got quite a lot of
35:09
publicity
35:10
for a very short period of time in his
35:11
little town people used to come and
35:13
watch him
35:14
do this he would get over a thousand
35:15
spectators and
35:17
um he would charge admission and stuff a
35:20
band stand was set up for him and they
35:22
used to accompany his performances on
35:24
skis
35:24
um but then this guy called walter
35:26
bullock who was a pilot
35:27
flew into lake city which is where he
35:29
lived and so
35:31
ralph uh samuelson said can you pull me
35:33
along behind your plane
35:35
and he did and he went at 60 miles an
35:37
hour and the first time he was pulled
35:38
along behind this plane
35:40
it was like a ski plane so it was going
35:42
along in the water
35:43
and the propellers of the plane blew
35:45
water into his face like bullets hitting
35:47
him
35:47
he said like hitting in his face but
35:49
he's too scared to let go because it's
35:50
going too fast so that'd be dangerous
35:52
um and so eventually he was jerked out
35:55
with his skis and pulled along on his
35:56
stomach for about 50
35:58
feet and even then he said my first
36:00
thought wasn't for my safety but for
36:02
whether i'd lost my swimming suit
36:05
but then it was 1922 when he first
36:07
started this and in 1927
36:10
he unfortunately broke his back in a
36:11
construction accident
36:13
uh and he never skied again but then
36:15
weirdly a fall from a tall ladder would
36:17
later cure his back problem no
36:20
that just doesn't feel like something
36:22
that happens does it
36:24
no way you know in like cartoons where
36:26
you bang your head and you lose your
36:27
memory and then you bang it an even
36:29
number of times and it comes back it
36:30
feels like that right but this is
36:32
genuinely what happened
36:33
wow from a tall ladder it's not we
36:36
should say that is not nhs guidelines
36:40
have you heard about the water skiing
36:41
elephant only one elephant is ever known
36:43
to have water skied is ever known to
36:44
avoid a skeet
36:47
um it was in the 1950s she was called
36:48
queenie and she did it actually
36:50
i did know about that and there were two
36:52
there was a previous one called sunshine
36:54
sally
36:55
well that is interfering research by me
36:58
i just assumed
36:59
it's really cool because they they uh it
37:01
sounds cruel but it's not
37:02
uh i it probably is yeah you've
37:06
you've put an elephant on they're
37:07
outside yeah they're outside of the
37:09
normal environment aren't they
37:10
yeah i guess so but it looks very sweet
37:13
without doing it
37:14
how does it work because um do they go
37:16
off uh do they go for jetty or do they
37:19
start in the water they're basically
37:20
standing on
37:20
a quite a long thin platform they're not
37:22
on two separate they're basically on a
37:23
boat
37:24
they're basically on a small boat being
37:25
tugged along behind a larger boat
37:28
oh okay right it's not it was made so um
37:32
queenie's skis were made out of two huge
37:34
pontoons so they did look like two giant
37:36
water skis
37:37
they were kind of welded together so she
37:39
could stand up but she was quite cool
37:41
and she used to go to rallies for the
37:42
republican party
37:45
because they have the elephants as their
37:47
symbol don't they oh okay
37:48
that's why that makes so much sense so
37:51
there were protests from animal rights
37:53
campaigners
37:54
and this was in the 50s and the 60s and
37:57
then local council local county chairman
38:00
edward flackerty
38:01
was asked what he thought about the
38:02
protests and people saying that she
38:04
shouldn't be water skiing because it was
38:06
unfair
38:06
and he said he thought the protests were
38:08
a democrat plot
38:10
oh well actually maybe they were yeah it
38:12
could have been
38:13
so i was reading about um because
38:15
there's many different types of
38:16
basic water skiing that you've been
38:18
doing so you've got water skiing uh
38:20
you've got wake boarding and then you've
38:21
got
38:21
barefoot skiing as well and what's
38:24
interesting is the different speeds you
38:25
need in order to
38:26
get purchase on the top of the water so
38:28
wake boarding is the easiest 20 miles an
38:30
hour is the one that you need
38:32
um then there's 30 miles an hour and
38:33
that's for actual water skiing
38:36
and 40 miles an hour is for bare foot
38:38
skiing so that's where
38:39
you need insane speed but uh but then
38:42
people have taken it further now so
38:44
there are records for people
38:46
um there's a guinness world record for
38:47
people who ski on their hands now
38:49
so what they do is they put their legs
38:51
into the the pulley rope bit
38:52
that you that you hold on usually with
38:54
your hands and then they go down on
38:55
their hands and there's a world record
38:57
which was set in september
38:58
of 2013 and that was someone hand skied
39:01
for 2
39:02
956 feet which is amazing
39:05
there's another world record where
39:07
someone jumped from a helicopter
39:09
67 feet in the air landed and then went
39:12
barefoot skiing straight away
39:13
which you can see on youtube which i've
39:15
seen as well uh and the and the world
39:17
record
39:18
for the longest jump ever done this is
39:20
on border skis for a jump
39:22
is 312 feet and that is still held
39:26
by a guy called freddy krueger
39:29
and i i went online you would have been
39:31
good at the han ski english
39:34
i went online because i thought i've
39:35
never heard anyone else called freddy
39:36
krueger and i went to wikipedia and
39:38
those notable freddy kruegers
39:40
he's quite famous the water scheme one i
39:41
think is he right well there's only
39:43
three well he's doing good for the name
39:44
of freddy krueger because there's only
39:46
three there's him
39:47
there's a guy from the movie uh and then
39:49
there's a
39:50
guy called frederick wilhelm krueger a
39:52
nazi official for the third reich
39:53
so he's this will rehabilitate the
39:56
freddy krueger name i
39:57
know it barefoot water skiing is
40:02
very cool though and um it's so
40:05
you're really good at barefoot water
40:06
skiing if you have flat feet i learned
40:09
which is quite nice for flat-footed
40:10
people because i have your feet are ten
40:12
feet long
40:13
and it's amazing um but you don't want
40:16
your toes to go in
40:17
uh it's toes to nose they call it but
40:19
i've got very high arches in my feet and
40:21
i always feel quite smug around my
40:22
flat-footed friends
40:23
but actually i would be i know it's a
40:25
weird reason to be arrogant
40:27
um but flat fee is much better
40:31
and also you can get third degree burns
40:34
from it
40:34
so this is an interview with george
40:36
blair who was a barefoot skiing champ
40:39
in the 70s and 80s i think and he
40:42
barefoot skied for three minutes which
40:43
is an extremely long time and you're
40:44
going
40:45
so fast and the friction is so extreme
40:47
that he got third degree burns and he
40:48
couldn't walk for days and days
40:50
and you're surrounded by hot ice and yet
40:55
you get third degree bones that's crazy
40:57
you know swans windsurf
40:59
today yeah sorry i know it's not uh
41:01
waterskiing but it is windsurfing
41:03
so it's but it is windsurfing
41:07
no they do they um they arch their wings
41:09
over their back and they can travel at
41:10
three miles an hour which
41:12
is very fast for them and it's way
41:14
faster than they could go with by
41:15
pedaling that's not as fast as they can
41:16
fly though
41:18
no no it's not their best means of
41:21
getting from a to b
41:22
true um but it does save them a bit of
41:23
energy and um
41:25
this i did not know about swans they can
41:27
run at a top speed of 22 miles an hour
41:30
i'm fulfilling that is not true that's
41:33
their top speed james it's not their
41:34
bottom speed
41:35
it's the top speed usain bolt's very top
41:38
speed ever
41:39
over the course of 100 meters was 23.35
41:42
miles an hour so a swan
41:43
could very nearly catch usain bolt wow
41:46
if at the end if he stuck his neck out
41:47
he might actually manage to
41:53
it's all about the finish mate i
41:56
think there needs to be really strict
41:57
rules because they can't use their wings
42:00
i think that's the important thing you
42:01
mustn't be allowed to use your wings
42:02
when you're raising usain bolt on
42:04
foot but if you're running 100 meters
42:06
you're allowed to
42:07
wave your arms around the molecules out
42:09
of the way actually
42:10
i think well they go like this didn't
42:12
they oh that's true and not great for a
42:14
podcast i must say
42:15
if you were sort of if you were doing
42:17
this and kind of flapping the air past
42:19
you yeah like a front crawl while you're
42:20
running
42:21
basically it must be better
42:25
it must be better because it's like air
42:26
is just like very very thin water
42:28
oh gosh future olympians are gripped
42:32
right now
42:35
hey we need to wrap up shortly um yak
42:38
skiing have you heard of this
42:39
no yak skiing so um this happens in the
42:42
indian hill resort of manali
42:44
and it's a tourist attraction so it's
42:46
really only tourists that do it i'm sure
42:48
the locals don't really do it
42:49
but your skier is at the bottom of a
42:51
slope he's attached to a rope with a
42:53
pulley
42:54
and there's a yak at the top of the
42:55
slope
42:57
and the yak you then shake some nuts at
43:00
the yak
43:04
and for some reason that makes the yak
43:06
leg it down the hill
43:07
but of course he's attached to you with
43:09
a rope and so you fly
43:11
up it's like the most amazing like ski
43:14
lift ever
43:15
wow and you got an enormous speed uh and
43:18
it was a sport
43:19
um invented by a guy called mr dorji who
43:22
has the advice
43:23
never shake the bucket of nuts before
43:25
you're tied to the yak rope
43:30
that actually is the 11th commandment
43:36
okay that is it that is all of our facts
43:39

because
00:55
that's typical q i fodder isn't it blue
00:58
whales
00:58
oh we gotta love a bit of a blue whale
01:00
yeah it's actually really weird i
01:02
googled it to see like what they look
01:04
like so obviously the tails coming out
01:06
first
01:06
and then i thought okay what's it coming
01:09
out of i know it sounds ridiculous but
01:10
they're mammals right so
01:12
um am i allowed to say vagina oh yeah
01:15
and i was like do whales have them what
01:18
obviously they do right yeah yeah so but
01:20
we spent like so long
01:21
at qi i think i spent about 12 years
01:23
looking up um
01:25
in fact james and i were thinking of
01:26
writing a book the q
01:28
book of genital ignorance do you
01:29
remember that i don't remember that no
01:32
sounds like a great idea yeah i think
01:34
backing off from this project
01:37
but anyway yeah so i googled them this
01:40
and there is an expert of
01:42
um wealth vaginas and and the scientific
01:44
american have written an article about
01:46
her she's called dr sarah messnick
01:48
and um it's really hard to study them
01:49
obviously so what she does is she looks
01:51
at victorian drawings
01:52
um she's got a freezer full of them she
01:54
asks people if they ever find one i'm
01:56
sorry a freezer
01:57
full of whales vaginas yeah exactly not
01:59
drawings the real things
02:00
and she also that must be a big fridge
02:03
well right a blue wells one is so big
02:05
you could walk inside it
02:06
and the strange thing in every single
02:09
way
02:09
but how do you fit that in your freezer
02:11
you need a walk-in freezer
02:14
you can make the freezer out of the
02:15
vagina
02:17
also she the other thing she does is she
02:18
gets people who are like well experts
02:20
but love diving
02:21
to like swim down and try and like put
02:23
little cameras on the whales so that she
02:25
can ct scan them
02:27
um and she said that uh it's a total
02:30
gauntlet in there
02:31
our very first well i know when we open
02:33
it up there were so many structures in
02:34
there that we couldn't figure
02:36
out how a sperm would possibly be able
02:37
to swim from one end to the other
02:39
um so basically well inside they've got
02:42
like flaps folds blind alleys and
02:44
funnels and a dizzying maze for sperm so
02:46
the reason for this possibly is
02:48
is that because they're in water they
02:51
don't want to wear they don't want water
02:52
going up there
02:53
so it you know that's a way to keep them
02:54
out keep the water out have lots of
02:56
little little sort of blind alleys and
02:57
funnels and mazes
02:58
oh okay right but they don't really know
03:00
why but how about with the birth then
03:01
why is it why because if they
03:03
they can't tell first yeah well it's so
03:05
that as they're being born
03:06
they can still breathe because if they
03:08
came out head first then they would just
03:09
drown but surely
03:11
whales breathe air right they come up to
03:12
the surface to breathe yeah so
03:14
they if they're being born underwater
03:16
they won't be able to start breathing
03:18
whichever end comes out first so what
03:20
happens is often with whales they'll
03:22
have a load of
03:23
mates of the mother midwives yeah
03:25
they're known as midwives right
03:27
and they'll kind of take the baby up so
03:29
it can have its first breath
03:30
to make sure that it doesn't just drown
03:32
there and also their umbilical cord is
03:33
like perforated
03:35
and so it kind of comes apart really
03:36
quickly easily cool
03:38
that's amazing have you heard about um
03:40
whale placenta
03:42
no it just floats off looking like a big
03:44
plastic bag in the water oh it was very
03:45
exciting recently one floated past
03:47
hawaii and everyone
03:48
everyone in hawaii gathered at the
03:50
water's edge to watch it go
03:52
other animals i think it probably
03:54
becomes food for other animals yeah yeah
03:56
um yeah i picked the the fact about blue
04:00
well because um it's like what a fact
04:01
from my book and i wrote about the blue
04:03
well he's at the natural history museum
04:04
called hope
04:05
and um when i went there with a little
04:07
kid she said to me do you
04:09
can blue whales talk to killer whales
04:12
what do you think
04:13
no oh i'd say different language
04:16
i'd say yes i'd say you could sort of
04:18
shout in blue whale
04:20
and put on a killer whale accent yeah or
04:23
you could get the gist you'd be like i
04:25
think
04:25
they want to eat me dos squids por favor
04:28
that kind of thing yeah yeah but a
04:30
killer whale isn't a whale yeah right
04:32
it's a dolphin
04:32
yeah so it makes more like clicking
04:34
whirring noises and
04:36
blue well obviously like makes deep
04:38
singing
04:39
noises but i don't know because the
04:41
killer whale
04:42
they're called killer whales because
04:43
they killed whales right
04:45
they were originally called whale
04:47
killers and then they got flipped around
04:49
ah nice but humans humans can talk to
04:51
other animals and other animals can kind
04:53
of
04:53
communicate with each other we can talk
04:55
to dogs kind of we can talk to whoever
04:56
we want
04:57
yeah whether they understand us or not
05:00
so a baby blue whale for its first year
05:03
gains 200 pounds
05:04
every day which is about my weight wow
05:07
so it's like after day one it's like i
05:10
then go into the whale and then day two
05:12
another one of me and dave three another
05:14
one of me for a whole year
05:15
until they're absolutely humongous and
05:17
that's all is that all krill or do they
05:18
get some sort of other food source from
05:21
them the milk the milk 200 liters of
05:24
milk
05:24
a day wow that's a shitload it's a very
05:27
weird mental image james can i just say
05:29
a whale made up of 365 views yeah
05:31
all kind of tied together imagine i'm
05:34
jonah
05:35
yeah only baby whales like to eat me
05:39
yeah but they're doing it again and
05:40
again and i'm cloning myself obviously
05:42
in this metaphor
05:43
how many use would it take to make up
05:45
one blue whale a lot
05:47
so for instance an adult blue whale eats
05:50
about four tons of krill a day
05:52
okay and by weight that's the equivalent
05:54
of eating 26 000 greg steak bakes
05:58
a day which is one every three seconds
06:01
what is a steak bake
06:03
i don't know it's a glorious thing it's
06:06
like a sausage roll but it's got a steak
06:07
in it
06:08
yeah it's like a pasty right oh yeah
06:10
it's very nice yeah but you wouldn't
06:11
want to eat one every three seconds
06:13
for the rest of your life would you go
06:16
on with life if you had to do that
06:19
yeah definitely so you don't get full
06:21
because you've got a much bigger stomach
06:23
yeah like
06:23
if your vagina's the size of a fridge
06:25
then your stomach's probably the size of
06:27
you know maybe a whole warehouse full of
06:29
fridges yeah so you're not going to get
06:31
full all the time with these steak bakes
06:33
and you've got a big mouth you can eat
06:34
more than one in time you don't need to
06:36
do the three second separation yes so i
06:38
it's
06:38
yeah it's funnier to imagine you daniel
06:40
having to eat one every three seconds
06:44
especially they feed in this like it's
06:45
called the blue elves feed in the
06:47
lunging
06:48
position which is actually the position
06:49
of not the lunching position
06:52
the eternal lunching position um yeah
06:54
that's the that you know they've hung
06:56
the blue well natural history museum
06:57
from the ceiling it's in the feed
06:58
lunging position so
06:59
what they do is they like dive down and
07:01
open their mouths and all the krill goes
07:02
in and then they
07:03
close their mouths and the balleen like
07:05
filters out the water and the krill
07:08
stays inside like little
07:09
peas do i don't know if we've mentioned
07:11
this on the podcast before but um
07:12
the blue whale in the natural history
07:14
museum um the one that's
07:16
made of the massive sort of like paper
07:18
mache do you remember that giant
07:20
whale that they have oh model one yeah
07:22
the model one so
07:23
there's a trap door at the bottom of it
07:25
and builders when they were making
07:27
all the surrounding rooms and the whale
07:28
itself used to go in there for breaks
07:30
and it's a bit of a time capsule now
07:32
because inside there are still old
07:34
magazines
07:34
there's said to be a mattress because
07:36
supposedly
07:38
after late night parties there were
07:39
sneaky shag sessions going on inside the
07:42
blue well we were told
07:43
we were told this by curators uh from
07:45
there did you have them go in through
07:46
the
07:47
freezer-sized vagina
07:50
but yeah inside the blue well supposedly
07:51
is a time capsule of newspapers and
07:53
there might be a mattress in there and
07:54
so
07:54
the um having sex inside a blue whale
07:56
definitely happened in gothenburg
07:58
and they also have a trap door and
07:59
public was allowed to go inside but they
08:01
stopped it because
08:02
they found a couple in the doing their
08:06
wow everything else i've got is very
08:07
tame compared with this stuff
08:10
they had a cafe in the mouth of this one
08:12
in gothenburg
08:13
they used to have religious people would
08:15
go there and tell the story of jonah and
08:16
the whale while having their coffee in
08:18
there
08:19
you couldn't get it you couldn't be
08:23
swallowed and end up in the stomach of
08:24
whale could you because you'd be
08:26
like because they can only eat krill
08:28
right yeah yeah they've got tiny
08:29
fruits yeah they're throwing footballs
08:31
yeah the size of a grapefruit we've said
08:33
on qi isn't it
08:34
but you could squeeze through size for
08:35
grapefruit it's not gonna be really
08:37
solid
08:38
is it it's gonna be like muscly but i
08:40
reckon you could squeeze through
08:42
no i just imagine trying to eat a meal
08:44
though that was trying to get
08:46
through that was too big imagine a lump
08:48
of gristle that was trying to get into
08:49
your stomach it was too big i think
08:50
you'd choke
08:51
yeah but it's better to have them
08:52
helping you swallow it the gristle
08:54
if you have food that helps you swallow
08:56
it that would make your life a lot
08:57
easier if the greg's steak bake wants to
08:59
be eaten
09:06
come on there's other of my buddies two
09:07
and a half seconds behind me let's go
09:09
let's go
09:09
go go
09:11
[Music]
09:16
okay it's time to move on to fact number
09:18
two and that is
09:19
james okay my fact this week is that
09:21
during the qing dynasty
09:22
in china when the weather got hot in the
09:25
summer people would swap their pillows
09:27
for
09:27
ceramic ones what an uncomfortable day
09:30
it must have been
09:31
like the first day of using a ceramic
09:32
pillow after having a lovely soft pillow
09:34
do you think
09:35
i guess your pillow would be nice and
09:36
cool which is good yeah which is the
09:38
advantage of doing it well we're in the
09:40
hottest day of the year today aren't we
09:42
this is going to go out in a few weeks
09:43
when it's probably pissing it down again
09:45
but this is the hottest day of the year
09:46
and this morning when you're in bed
09:48
would you not have killed for a ceramic
09:49
pillow
09:50
ceramic pillow right there yeah actually
09:52
that would be awful imagine a pillow
09:54
fight
09:54
with a sword
10:00
there was a pillow fight in 2015
10:03
between a load of army cadets in america
10:06
and they decided for some reason instead
10:09
of having a normal
10:10
harmless pillow fight that they put
10:11
helmets in the pillows
10:13
and as a result at least 30 cadets were
10:15
injured 24 suffered concussions
10:18
and there were three broken arms one
10:20
broken neck and many missing teeth
10:22
one broken neck that is bad that
10:25
i read about that it's at west point
10:27
military academy and it was this great
10:28
tradition it happened every year since
10:30
1897
10:32
and after 2015 they said well maybe
10:34
maybe no more of this
10:36
isn't that crazy yeah that is um pillow
10:38
fights used to be used a lot for early
10:40
cinema
10:40
um there's a lot of examples of some of
10:42
the early movies that were made those
10:43
black and white ones are
10:45
called like the first example in 1897
10:47
was just called
10:48
a pillow fight and it's just people
10:50
having a pillow fight
10:51
and then it was remade well there was a
10:54
follow-up called new pillow fight
10:57
what happened then yeah it was just more
10:59
um yeah
11:00
i guess you know the second installment
11:02
yeah they didn't put helmets inside the
11:03
pillars no
11:04
but what the yeah what they what they i
11:06
read is uh the reason it was very good
11:08
for cinema is because you could see the
11:09
fight
11:10
starting uh small and feathers would
11:12
come out and as the fight escalated
11:14
uh and they got harder more feathers
11:16
would come out so the audience were able
11:17
to properly see the intensity of a fight
11:19
as it got
11:20
heavier and heavier um it was just great
11:22
for early cinema to have that as a as an
11:24
effect of visual
11:25
so yeah a lot of pillow fights in early
11:27
cinema have you guys heard of a pillow
11:29
ford uh that's a phrase yeah yeah where
11:32
you build yourself you feel affordable
11:33
okay there is a park in america which is
11:36
called
11:37
fort pillow okay that's its name and
11:40
it's named after a u.s and confederacy
11:42
general whose name was
11:43
gideon johnson pillow but it's called
11:46
very comfy man
11:48
i can just imagine like putting my head
11:49
down sleeping on his like fat tummy
11:52
he i don't i don't know if he was fat or
11:54
not but he was not a nice man you
11:56
wouldn't have wanted a cuddle yeah no he
11:58
wasn't
11:58
he was a bad dude um but i don't think
12:01
it's got anything to do with pillow
12:02
forts and it's called fort pillow
12:04
what are the odds i've been i've been
12:05
trying to find out the first use of the
12:06
phrase pillow fort
12:08
to see if full pillow predates it i
12:09
can't find it
12:12
pillow what a terrible name for a
12:14
general
12:15
general pillow was he general captain
12:19
pillow
12:20
general general pillow general he was a
12:21
brigadier general he was very senior in
12:23
the army
12:24
i reckon there's his name that made him
12:25
such an angry man
12:29
so i got this fact from the christie's
12:32
website
12:33
the auctioneers they had there was an
12:36
article about 100 things we learned from
12:37
christie's i'll give you a few more of
12:39
those before we go on to
12:40
the last okay oh yeah napoleon was
12:42
allergic to leather
12:44
in france first edition comic books sell
12:46
for much less than the original plates
12:48
that we used to make them
12:50
[Music]
12:51
and andy warhol once wrote in his
12:53
diaries that danny devito was so
12:55
cute we should all marry him wow that is
12:58
two
12:58
pop culture names i did not expect to to
13:01
come together
13:02
yeah devito as well
13:07
[Laughter]
13:14
there was someone who who was it who
13:17
slept on the stomach of
13:18
um i know who it was was it genghis khan
13:21
no it was
13:22
i think it was peter the great that's
13:24
right
13:25
the great used to use a young male
13:28
secretary's stomach as a pillow
13:29
he referred his wife but if he was away
13:32
traveling and his wife wasn't available
13:33
he had his
13:34
um bringing general pillow
13:38
but you couldn't turn him over could you
13:39
because if you turn over that person
13:41
you've got a
13:42
bony back yeah you've got a bum you
13:43
could use this you just have to slip
13:45
out of it yeah no it's not ideal
13:49
no but you would want the man's tummy
13:51
yeah that's different
13:53
it's different isn't it there's less
13:54
going on in the on the stomach
13:56
rumbling if it's hungry yeah that's true
13:59
you don't be well fed
14:00
sorry were we talk what were we talking
14:02
about i mean pillows a long time ago
14:05
um yes so um chinese people they used to
14:08
use
14:09
ceramic pillows well actually james they
14:11
still do i've got someone staying with
14:12
me and she's from singapore
14:14
and she said her aunt still uses a
14:16
ceramic pillow
14:17
is that right very cool just in the stop
14:19
talking to her
14:20
recently but following a pillow fight
14:24
[Laughter]
14:26
but because they lived in small living
14:29
spaces they would be
14:30
um decorative as well and they would be
14:33
given as wedding gifts and they'd be
14:35
kind of a sign of
14:36
you know wishes for many happy years of
14:39
marriage or offspring or whatever
14:41
some of them were shaped so the
14:43
line-shaped ones which would scare off
14:44
evil spirits which is useful
14:46
uh there was some shape like frogs and
14:48
there was a fashion for some shape like
14:49
sleeping children
14:51
yeah yeah i think they thought that like
14:53
pillows could commune between the spirit
14:55
world and human world so they'd put like
14:57
children playing on them to like bring
14:59
children into the family
15:01
or specific there's one in the met uh in
15:03
new york that's got a drawing of two
15:04
boys playing in peonies which is
15:06
apparently to
15:06
ensure like baby boys and heirs would
15:08
come along and there's one in the
15:10
british museum
15:11
um that is in the shape of a woman lying
15:13
down with her head on a pillow
15:14
um and yeah on the concave bit of the
15:17
woman around her hip where you put your
15:18
head there's a lovely poem which says
15:20
the wind rustles flowers under a snow
15:23
white moon
15:24
i read this and i can't quite believe it
15:26
which is that in medieval times
15:27
pillows were really for for people who
15:29
are a bit weedy
15:30
yeah they were only for the elderly or
15:33
pregnant women
15:34
they still are actually i sleep on a i
15:36
sleep on a piece of two by four with
15:38
nails stuck in it
15:40
[Laughter]
15:43
i do have a reason why you should throw
15:45
your pillows away james and go back to
15:46
that piece of two before with nails in
15:48
it
15:50
why sandy there was a study by the
15:52
university of manchester which took
15:53
pillows which have been used for various
15:54
lengths of time and they found
15:56
several thousand spools of fungus per
15:59
gram of pillow they found 47 different
16:02
species of fungus so
16:04
that's that might be what you're
16:05
sleeping on yeah i read that a third of
16:07
the weight of any pillow
16:09
if you've been using it for ages is dead
16:11
skin i think that's
16:12
why some people think that might be true
16:14
and some people think that might have
16:15
been the rumor put about by
16:17
pillow manufacturers by big pillow
16:20
no you would think wouldn't you if and
16:22
it's not just dead skin it's also house
16:24
mite
16:24
corpses yeah and house might excrement
16:26
and and living house mites and
16:28
everything but
16:29
if it was one third of an entire pillow
16:32
that's a lot of a pillow
16:33
you would think you could tell if just
16:34
one end was just your skin
16:36
yeah that's true mind you but you sleep
16:39
with pillow cases right so doesn't all
16:41
the gross stuff go on there and then you
16:42
change and then you wash it
16:43
wow i know who washes a pillow you put a
16:45
pillowcase around a turd it's still a
16:47
turd
16:48
it's still
16:51
hitler hitler's pillowcase oh yeah i'm
16:53
afraid we've reached the hitler bit of
16:55
the podcast
16:55
um his pillowcase was not only
16:57
monogrammed with his initials
16:59
it had an eagle and a swastika on it
17:02
yeah it was auctioned in 2011 and uh a
17:05
pillow case on a sheet was over two
17:06
thousand pounds
17:07
that's not much it's not well come on
17:10
for hitler's pillowcase
17:12
i didn't realize we had a collector in
17:14
the room
17:18
um do you want a random swastika factor
17:21
yeah i got two actually
17:22
oh yeah um one the oldest bit of human
17:25
writing ever found has got a swastika in
17:26
it
17:27
and two the word swastika is sanskrit
17:30
and it means kind of lucky or fortunate
17:33
hindu symbol the oldest writing so
17:35
that's the ancient
17:37
hindu indo-european sanskrit yeah no
17:39
it's not
17:40
it's pre-sanskrit yeah it's
17:41
proto-sanskrit wow
17:43
european you know if you get to a hotel
17:46
and you don't like your pillow you can
17:47
order a pillow menu
17:48
not in all hotels not all hotels we've
17:51
just finished a tour and i don't think a
17:52
single one of the hotels
17:53
that we stayed in had a pillow yeah
17:55
sorry i should have said uh certain
17:57
hotels
17:58
provide a pillow menu i've worked in
18:01
hotels that had
18:02
pillows yeah yeah and it would be like
18:04
let's say you had a
18:05
an anti-allergen pillow you might have
18:08
that
18:08
or hard or soft or general pillows tummy
18:11
or whatever
18:14
[Laughter]
18:17
[Music]
18:22
okay it is time for fact number three
18:25
and that is my fact
18:26
my fact this week is that oscar wilde
18:29
ate his books as he read them
18:32
this was um there was a book that was
18:34
written called by thomas wright um
18:36
called built of books how reading
18:38
defined the life of oscar wilde
18:40
in it he reveals that as oscar wilde was
18:42
reading books he would tear off the top
18:44
corner of each page once he'd read it
18:46
and eat it
18:47
and then keep moving on it was just a
18:48
habit of his instead of having like a
18:50
bookmark right
18:51
i guess wherever the chump has been
18:53
taken out of the corner
18:54
yeah why don't we all do that
18:58
well have you ever eaten paper yeah do
19:01
you like it
19:01
i don't mind it it's not my favorite
19:04
it's no greg's steak bake
19:06
i think it's not that nice seating paper
19:08
i think in a small amount it's fine
19:10
um i've been reading a lot on elsa wild
19:11
recently uh that's one of the
19:13
fun facts that i discovered in the books
19:15
as you read them
19:16
no i didn't the internet he was reading
19:19
your computer if you're reading online
19:22
you have to take a
19:22
bite oh good very nice so um
19:26
there was an exhibition not too long ago
19:28
2016 in reading prison where they showed
19:30
all of the books that oscar wilde had
19:31
while he was in prison
19:33
and they did it it's an empty exhibition
19:36
um
19:37
but they basically when he was in jail
19:40
um
19:40
you weren't really allowed to have
19:42
access to books but because he was
19:43
uh such a prominent figure and and so he
19:46
was the only one who was allowed
19:47
basically they have a
19:48
special dispensation for him right yeah
19:50
he was allowed to keep his light on at
19:51
night
19:52
longer than everyone else so what i like
19:54
about it is that reading jail was the
19:55
only reading jail
19:57
wow very nice yes i read that
20:00
i i'm a bit hated on the details i think
20:02
he was allowed it was technically a long
20:04
letter
20:05
that the governor of the prison allowed
20:06
him to write because you were allowed to
20:08
write a letter
20:09
but um he was writing a huge long
20:12
oh so this is the house rather than the
20:15
day exactly yeah so that was when he was
20:17
in prison being allowed to write
20:19
yes yeah and we see it interestingly as
20:21
a letter because it starts dear bosey to
20:23
the
20:23
to his lover and who he ended up going
20:26
to prison as a result of the
20:27
relationship with
20:28
and um bosey never read it until after
20:30
oscar wilde had died it was never
20:31
written to be
20:32
a private letter to him done in long
20:34
form it was meant to be published and it
20:36
was
20:37
written and sent to a publisher as
20:39
opposed to bosey himself
20:40
yeah so yeah it was a good cheat that he
20:42
pulled off oh it's
20:44
it's a huge sort of um uh philosophical
20:47
it's his like deepest
20:48
work i think that oscar wilde did just
20:50
life and and why he was in there and
20:52
what
20:52
people thought about uh sex and gender
20:54
and all that sort of stuff
20:55
i think he's pretty he's pretty rude
20:58
about bosey in it because bosey
20:59
encouraged him to sue for libel when
21:02
bosey's father
21:03
had been extremely rude about world in
21:04
public and said that
21:06
the cost would be covered in all of this
21:07
and as it was the libel trial collapsed
21:09
oscar wilde was sued for what the time
21:11
was gross indecency
21:13
being gay basically uh as a result went
21:16
to prison so
21:17
he's quite annoyed with boce in bits of
21:19
it you know that he um
21:20
supposedly his last words were uh my
21:22
wallpaper and i are fighting a jewel to
21:24
the death one
21:25
one or either of us has to go so i tried
21:27
to find out what his wallpaper was like
21:30
because it must be pretty horrible right
21:33
did you find out
21:34
um i i didn't but i found out that his
21:36
um wallpaper in his own house
21:38
back in london because he died in paris
21:39
in a hotel right he um
21:41
in his own house he had a drawing room
21:43
with dragons painted all over a blue
21:45
ceiling and he
21:46
his wallpaper was had peacock feathers
21:48
it was like peacock feathers all set
21:50
into the plaster of the walls and then i
21:52
don't know whether the hotel in paris
21:54
where he died knows this because they've
21:55
redecorated the oscar world room where
21:57
he died
21:58
um with the fresco of kissing peacocks
22:01
and the other thing that's on show in
22:02
there is the bill from his hotel stay
22:04
where he
22:05
when he when he died and uh he never
22:06
paid it and apparently he said i am
22:08
dying above my means
22:11
yeah but i don't think that they were
22:13
his final words were they
22:15
wallpaper thing so um he had an
22:17
operation just before he died
22:19
and while he was recuperating he said
22:21
that last words and he said a few other
22:23
last words as well
22:24
um saying i can't even afford to die and
22:26
things like that but when he actually
22:28
died
22:28
i don't think he was in any state to be
22:30
making witticisms or
22:32
james you just ruined the whole lovely
22:35
ending
22:35
it was definitely nearly his last yes
22:38
yeah i
22:38
so i read a thing andy and i were
22:39
talking about this downstairs um because
22:41
uh there's a sense that it's been
22:43
debunked uh this fact that i'm about to
22:45
say
22:46
um uh but i read it in a christopher
22:47
hitchens article uh where he talks about
22:49
the hidden
22:51
um the hidden sort of innuendos that was
22:54
all the way through the importance of
22:55
being earnest the play so christopher
22:57
hitchens says
22:58
that the word earnest used to be
23:00
victorian slang
23:01
for if you were homosexual so the idea
23:04
was
23:04
oscar wilde loved the idea on the
23:06
marquee it was effectively saying the
23:08
importance of being gay
23:09
was uh his big sort of hidden message
23:12
that was underneath it
23:13
and that seems to have been slightly
23:15
been debunked but it's interesting um
23:17
because hitchens brings up a bunch of
23:19
different examples where he seeded sort
23:20
of hidden meanings uh within the play
23:23
so for example there's a character minor
23:25
character called bloxham bloxham
23:27
was famous at the time as an editor of a
23:29
magazine
23:30
a gay magazine called the chameleon and
23:32
he was very controversial character
23:35
cecily was one of the characters names
23:36
of one of the high society girls that
23:38
according to hitchens was vernacular for
23:41
transvestite rent boys
23:42
uh back in the day and just lots of
23:45
little
23:46
bits of hidden hints towards the two
23:49
main male characters having alternative
23:51
lives that they're trying to hide was a
23:53
suggestion that they were both
23:55
um themselves gay and if there was a
23:57
missing handbag
23:59
in a handbag
24:02
very nice um where uh and supposedly
24:06
sort of meet up places where um where
24:08
guys would go to meet up
24:10
um sort of illegally would be places
24:12
like lost property
24:14
places and so on um so another thing
24:16
that you were telling me dan is about
24:18
the
24:18
marquis of queensberry yes yeah well my
24:21
original fact for this
24:22
was that uh to protest at the opening of
24:26
the importance of being earnest about
24:27
the relationship of oscar wilde and boce
24:29
the marquis of
24:30
the marquis of queensberry try to
24:32
interrupt the premiere with a bouquet
24:34
of phallic shaped vegetables um
24:37
did you like throw them on stage or what
24:39
did he do that was his plan he was gonna
24:41
go inside and he went with a posse went
24:42
with like a crew
24:43
kind of like how uh conor mcgregor
24:45
recently threw stuff at a bus that was
24:47
kind of the marquee of
24:48
queens gregor didn't throw phallic
24:50
vegetables did he no
24:51
they were phallic um chairs
24:53
[Laughter]
24:58
so do you have to like carve a phallic
24:59
vegetable or no i don't
25:01
think you can well this but i so i think
25:03
he he definitely did take along
25:05
vegetables he took along a basket of
25:06
vegetables to throw at the stage and
25:08
throughout world and protest
25:09
but i think they weren't especially
25:11
phallic i think they were just carrots
25:12
and turnips because then
25:14
carrots are quite fuller can't they all
25:16
of them really
25:17
uh yeah yeah cucumber yeah okay
25:21
aubergine what we're saying is that many
25:22
vegetables are kind of
25:24
a little bit phallic in nature yeah and
25:26
so to say that these were phallic
25:28
vegetables seems plausible yeah but what
25:31
i don't think is true that the marquis
25:32
of queensberry went around selecting i
25:34
think that would be a weird thing to
25:35
protest against homosexuality by going
25:37
around looking for penises wherever you
25:38
could find them
25:39
and would say more about the marquis's
25:41
own state of mind than about wives
25:44
but that that so he wasn't allowed and
25:46
he didn't get led into the play and then
25:47
he he left a card i think sorry can i
25:50
just say did they not let him in because
25:52
he was carrying the vegetables like did
25:53
they you know when you go to um a gig
25:55
and they have to check your handbag
26:01
but yeah so was that the reason why or
26:03
was it because they recognized him
26:04
i think probably he turned up angry with
26:06
thugs and holding vegetables and they
26:08
thought
26:08
that's the opening night let's not take
26:09
the chance yeah and also he was famous
26:12
for going to premieres of theater shows
26:14
to protest them that was his thing so he
26:16
went to he went to one play that
26:18
uh he was protesting that they were
26:20
giving atheists a bad name
26:22
by tennyson
26:25
and then he brought vegetables shaped
26:27
like jesus yes
26:28
yeah exactly well a lot of vegetables
26:30
actually look like jesus think about it
26:31
yeah
26:32
which one particularly the jerusalem
26:35
artichokes
26:37
um yeah play actually failed importance
26:40
being honest failed as a result of this
26:42
trial happening it closed after 83
26:45
performances in spite of getting crazily
26:46
good reviews
26:47
well but it survived longer than it
26:49
should have what they just did was take
26:50
his name off the bill
26:51
so they just erased oscar wilde from the
26:54
production because he was up there on
26:55
the marquee it was an oscar wilde play
26:57
and they just said all right let's get
26:58
rid of that and let's keep it going so
27:00
it should have come off 30 or 40
27:02
performances before
27:03
right then really but when he didn't
27:06
when he didn't um
27:07
manage to get into the play the marquis
27:09
i think he went to one's club
27:11
and he left a card saying to oscar wilde
27:14
posing as a somdemite
27:16
he meant to write sodomite and he
27:17
misspelled it i think to a writer that
27:20
has got to be more of an insult almost
27:21
than spelling it right
27:22
it's annoying and that's what that's
27:24
what made bosey say no you have to sue
27:26
my father for libel and that's when
27:28
wilde did sue
27:28
card spell wrong yeah he shouldn't have
27:30
done that
27:32
with the benefit of hindsight molly no
27:33
he shouldn't have done that
27:36
she just sent it back you spelled it
27:38
wrong leave me alone
27:42
did you know that oscar wilde's on the
27:44
front cover of the sergeant pepper's
27:46
lonely hearts club band
27:48
okay he's like looking over the shoulder
27:50
of john lennon um
27:51
the other thing i found out is that is
27:53
about his tomb so he's um
27:54
buried in pear lashes cemetery in france
27:58
paris where lots of famous people are
27:59
and his tombs it's got a big sphinx
28:02
flying across it have you seen it yeah
28:04
um and yeah so it was described as a
28:06
demonic flying angel and it had a huge
28:09
set of genitalia
28:10
which apparently the keeper of the
28:11
cemetery said oh it's actually a
28:14
cucumber
28:17
yeah the keeper said that this is
28:18
totally indecent so they just covered it
28:20
up with a topple in for a little while
28:22
um anyway so then that they they uh said
28:25
right we're gonna have to sort this out
28:26
topolon's just not gonna work so they
28:28
made a bronze
28:29
butterfly shaped cod piece and put that
28:32
over
28:33
the top and then aleister crowley
28:35
apparently stole it
28:36
um yeah he was known as the wickedest
28:38
man on earth wasn't he crowley
28:40
yeah he was like uh what was he like he
28:42
was like a dark magician
28:44
who uh like david blaine
28:48
the newspapers called him evil because
28:50
he was like um
28:51
he was he had very poor morals and was
28:54
kind of corrupting the young they said
28:56
like jeremy corbyn okay so he's a cross
28:59
between david blaine and jeremy corbyn
29:01
i think i understand who this girl is
29:04
he apparently when he was on holiday in
29:05
egypt with his wife rose he had a vision
29:07
of someone dictating like a book of laws
29:09
to him and he founded a whole new
29:10
religion
29:11
crowley
29:16
there's a bookshop not too far from here
29:17
uh which is called watkins and it's um
29:19
esoteric bookshop it's a cult and all
29:21
that sort of stuff it's amazing and they
29:23
have a story which is that aleister
29:24
crowley used to shop there and he came
29:26
in one time and the
29:27
owner said i don't believe that you have
29:28
all these magic tricks and then he said
29:30
well watch this
29:31
it had instant he made all of the books
29:33
disappear in the shop
29:35
and then a second later they all came
29:38
back
29:41
so alistair crowley he took the
29:43
butterfly off um
29:44
he nicked it basically and then when he
29:46
went to london he got all dressed up put
29:48
the butterfly
29:48
on his jacket and he went to cafe royal
29:51
and like hung out with all of his
29:52
friends and was like i've got
29:54
oscar world's um butterfly copies and
29:56
now everyone can see his massive
29:57
genitalia on the sphinx right and then
30:00
they're now not there and the rumor is
30:03
is that two angry ladies who were
30:04
walking in the cemetery just got some
30:06
rocks and bashed it off because they
30:07
didn't like
30:08
it and yeah and apparently the balls are
30:10
now
30:11
used as paperweights in the pear lashes
30:14
conservation office
30:16
is that right that's what i'd like to
30:18
happen to my balls after i die
30:20
and the uh the penis shaft is used as a
30:23
draft excluder under the door in the
30:25
office
30:30
[Applause]
30:34
okay it is time for our final fact of
30:36
the show and that is
30:38
andy my fact is that the new york police
30:40
have a casting director for their
30:41
lineups
30:43
which is now he's not a proper policeman
30:47
right he's not even a rogue policeman
30:48
he's just a guy um
30:50
and there was a profile of him in the
30:51
new york times a few years ago he's
30:53
called robert weston
30:54
and whenever the police and the bronx
30:56
need to do a line up they say we need
30:58
five
30:59
you know light-skinned hispanic men
31:01
he'll say okay i know just the people i
31:03
ring they all get ten dollars he gets
31:05
ten dollars for organizing the thing
31:07
and he's been doing this for years and
31:08
he can find various different categories
31:10
of people
31:11
it's really cool yeah it's a very weird
31:13
casting job that he does
31:14
but he's been doing it for ages um so
31:16
these days we have something called
31:18
viper in the uk
31:19
uh which is the uh video identification
31:22
parade electronic recording
31:24
and it's basically a database of loads
31:25
of different faces and so you go into
31:27
your database and you say this person
31:29
has this colorized this color of
31:31
hair and whatever and then it just finds
31:33
people who look like them
31:34
basically instead of getting a tenor for
31:35
every lineup you do you get paid a ten
31:37
or once and then your face is in the
31:38
system
31:39
what it means is that they can go to the
31:41
house of the person who's been a victim
31:43
of the crime
31:44
so if you've been mugged the police will
31:45
come around to your place and they'll
31:46
show you on a computer
31:48
and line up and say can you identify any
31:50
of these yes so with the viper thing if
31:52
you're
31:52
um accused then you can ask your lawyer
31:54
to get the police to photoshop any
31:56
distinctive mark you have might have on
31:58
your face
31:59
so for instance i have a scar on my face
32:01
don't i under my eye what's that from
32:03
from when i was pillow fight
32:06
i was in the west point military when i
32:08
was younger no i just fell when i was a
32:10
child
32:11
and um it's basically i can make it so
32:14
everyone else has this exact scar on so
32:16
that oh
32:17
cool nice you wouldn't raise it off you
32:19
just put it on everyone else
32:21
yeah surely yeah that it is because
32:24
if if people are looking for if they
32:26
remember a birthmark or scarf yeah
32:28
they'll fixate on that and they might
32:30
misidentify uh if they're just looking
32:33
for that
32:33
thing but surely it's an incentive to
32:35
criminals to do all their crimes in like
32:37
a fabulous hat or something
32:38
because then you can just make everyone
32:40
in the id parade wear a fabulous hat
32:41
that's what i'd do
32:43
i was a criminal like vegetables on it
32:45
yeah
32:47
um do you know that in 2015 there was an
32:51
id parade of dogs in the uk
32:53
was there yeah because the dog did a
32:54
crime yeah a dog did a crime
32:56
and they do it bitten a girl in wales
33:00
and the police ran an id parade of dogs
33:02
which were all from the street
33:03
that the crack the biting had taken
33:05
place and the girl picked the right one
33:07
but then dogs are very different looking
33:09
at them well i don't know if they tried
33:10
to get five border collies
33:13
we just had a rottweiler and a load of
33:14
chipotles and poodles and stuff i think
33:16
they might have put the other dogs in
33:17
border collie costumes
33:19
you've got two chihuahuas
33:25
um actually you could have a line up
33:28
where the dogs are the ones who are
33:30
picking the criminal oh
33:31
okay because in some states of america
33:33
alaska florida new york and texas they
33:35
have scent lineups
33:37
wow um where dogs smell a number of
33:40
people to pick out the suspect
33:41
and the fbi report from 2004 says it
33:44
should not be used as primary evidence
33:46
okay and because it's not exactly
33:49
amazingly kind of accurate but
33:51
just smell like food at that one
33:54
they rub sausages on all the criminals
33:56
before they yeah if you smell like
33:58
sausages
33:59
normally you're allowed to ask your
34:00
lawyer to make everyone else
34:04
but this is not the dogs are not the
34:05
victims of the crime right
34:07
it's not which of these men called you a
34:09
bad dog
34:13
no they're just matching the scent with
34:15
the scent from the crime okay
34:17
do you wanna hear one thing about this
34:19
so this is about people who look like
34:20
each other in lineups i did find one
34:21
thing about look-alikes
34:22
yeah go on it's it's this guy who's a
34:24
daniel craig look-alike and he was
34:26
writing up his experiences
34:28
and he just sounds like he has a really
34:30
tricky time he was recounting some of
34:32
his adventures
34:32
he's called steve wright and um he has
34:35
these awful times so he says
34:36
he was flown out to santa pay by a
34:38
millionaire to reenact the scene where
34:40
james bond comes out of the water in his
34:41
swimming trunks
34:42
and he said i was told to wait a few
34:43
yards out of the water until my cue came
34:45
the theme team from casino royale
34:47
but when it did it sounded very faint he
34:49
says i suddenly realized that somehow i
34:51
had drifted a hundred yards out of the
34:52
street
34:55
and i had to lurch back with seawater
34:57
slapping in my face
34:59
by the time i reached this end i was
35:00
totally out of breath and staggered out
35:02
of the water
35:03
so you think that's bad then he did
35:04
another party where he said it's more
35:06
typical for him to be schmoozing ladies
35:08
at a corporate event dressed as james
35:09
bond and looking like daniel craig
35:11
he did a function a black tie ball and
35:13
he said unfortunately it was a black tie
35:14
ball so i didn't stand out easily
35:16
when i waltzed into the room of 250
35:17
people and attempted to charm the female
35:19
contingent i found myself being treated
35:20
like a repellent sex pest
35:23
i tried taking a woman's arm and saying
35:25
so you must be [ __ ] galore would you
35:27
like to be my [ __ ] for the night yeah
35:29
but i had failed to introduce myself
35:30
with james bond first
35:33
she pulled her arm back very quickly and
35:35
called her husband over
35:39
[Music]

01:16
[Music]
01:21
[Applause]
01:25
welcome to another episode of no such
01:28
thing as a fish a weekly podcast
01:31
coming to you this week live from dublin
01:42
my name is dan schreiber and i'm sitting
01:45
here with anna chazinski andrew hunter
01:47
murray and james harkin
01:49
and once again we have gathered around
01:51
the microphones with our four
01:52
favorite facts from the last seven days
01:54
and in no particular order
01:55
here we go starting with you chicinski
01:59
my fact this week is that every
02:01
competitor at the world's longest dog
02:03
sled race
02:04
brings about 600 spare pairs of shoes
02:06
with them
02:09
and they're for the dogs
02:11
[Music]
02:13
this this is amazing so this is the
02:15
iditarod race which happens in alaska
02:17
every year um it's very long it's uh
02:20
roughly a thousand miles through alaska
02:22
and yeah the dogs have to wear shoes and
02:24
so
02:25
uh by the rules of the game they
02:27
actually have to bring
02:28
eight extra shoes on the sled with them
02:31
so at any one time there have to be
02:32
eight pairs of dog shoes on the sled i
02:34
was gonna say on a pair of dog shoes
02:36
is that four shoes are two shoes i
02:39
i didn't know how to word this um but
02:41
it's
02:42
so it's a pair is for the front pair and
02:45
then you have a second pair for the back
02:46
pair
02:46
the way i see it but the dogs have
02:49
different foot sizes on the front sets
02:51
to the back sets
02:52
they actually they can do they can do
02:54
yeah sometimes they do yeah
02:56
so if you're buying if you're buying
02:57
your dog shoes
02:59
then number one you're insane
03:03
well number two you have to you have to
03:05
get both sides measured what's the
03:06
biggest difference between the backs
03:07
like there's some dogs with tiny tiny
03:09
front paws and then massive back paws
03:11
that was like like a penny farthing but
03:15
like a kangaroo on all fours yeah yeah
03:18
yeah i believe not
03:19
[Laughter]
03:22
again facts get in the way of an
03:23
otherwise pleasing bit of whimsy
03:24
[Laughter]
03:27
bye so i didn't actually look that much
03:29
into the size range of the dog's shoes
03:32
i will say that the mushers who are the
03:34
guys what are we calling them mushrooms
03:35
or mushers
03:37
someone said yeah so these are the dudes
03:40
who are riding the sled
03:41
this is the guy who's riding the sled or
03:42
the woman who's riding the sled they
03:44
usually make the dog shoes themselves so
03:45
i guess they can tailor into each dog's
03:47
foot size
03:47
and like i say in the rules per dog you
03:50
have to have eight extra shoes
03:51
on board the sled and so yeah they
03:53
usually bring over a thousand pairs of
03:54
shoes like
03:55
thirteen fourteen hundred shoes and then
03:57
the dogs have to drag the weight of
03:59
those shoes as well
04:00
don't they i guess yeah yeah they do
04:02
kind of change them like that though on
04:03
so you know in formula one you have pit
04:05
stops where you're going to get filled
04:06
up with petrol
04:07
but that's what happens you have your
04:08
pit stops on the sled race where you go
04:10
and you have to change your dog's shoes
04:12
the guys at the side they're bringing 16
04:13
trees for the dog to piss again
04:22
some drivers uh mushers rather they
04:24
bring 3 000
04:25
little booties because you've got 16
04:28
dogs
04:28
pulling each sled i think that's right
04:30
is that 64 feet
04:31
yeah yeah what happens do they do they
04:34
lose their shoe on the run or do they
04:36
wear through why do they need to change
04:38
gets worn through
04:40
because so the reason they have shoes
04:41
it's not because of the colder and i
04:42
think dog's feet are very good at
04:43
managing the cold so it's totally
04:45
covered in ice and snow
04:46
but the reason they need it is for the
04:48
kind of lumps and bumps and the grit and
04:50
the sharp bits of ice that might get
04:51
stuck in their pores
04:52
and so that wears away at the shoes and
04:54
just you know they're running pretty
04:55
hardcore that's cool i read a really
04:58
cool thing about the
04:59
because this is a big event that happens
05:01
uh annually and
05:03
and it brings people from all over the
05:04
planet to come and compete and in 2010
05:07
uh the event uh saw its first ever
05:10
jamaican team entering it
05:14
yeah um he's yeah he's called motionmon
05:17
that's what he calls himself
05:18
and um he yeah he's uh he's been
05:21
competing for his nickname isn't it no
05:23
he's his he calls himself that that's
05:25
his nickname
05:25
yeah that's cool yeah is this because i
05:28
thought there was one guy called newton
05:29
marshall that's what
05:30
that's him so you know the amazing thing
05:32
about newton marshall
05:34
it's such a cool story so basically in
05:36
2014 there was another sledder
05:38
called scott janssen and he came off his
05:40
sled and he was really really badly
05:42
injured but he was off the track
05:43
and he didn't know if anyone was going
05:44
to find him and newton marshall came by
05:46
on his thread and he
05:48
noticed that this sled had been
05:49
overturned and that someone was really
05:51
badly injured like
05:52
he'd been seriously concussed he'd
05:53
broken his ankle and so he went and he
05:55
saved him this guy called newton
05:57
marshall went and he raised the alarm
05:58
and he sort of made him a little bed in
05:59
the snow and they waited for
06:01
him to be saved and he was rescued he
06:03
was fine so that was what newton
06:04
marshall did but the bizarre thing about
06:06
this
06:06
is that two years earlier in the same
06:08
race scott
06:09
janssen's dog had collapsed and he'd had
06:12
to revive him with mouth to snout
06:13
resuscitation so he'd been as good as
06:16
dead
06:17
for five minutes and scott jansen is a
06:18
funeral home director so he said i know
06:20
what dead looks like
06:22
that dog was dead but he gave him
06:24
malthus now and the bizarre thing
06:26
about this is that the dog was called
06:28
marshall
06:30
so he he saved a
06:33
what are you what are you suggesting
06:37
i i genuinely don't know
06:41
what's clearly happening is the dog
06:43
marshall has been reincarnated in the
06:44
person marshall who's then come to save
06:46
him as a thank you i see
06:48
for saving the dog had subsequently died
06:50
i know
06:51
yeah and then newton the the human will
06:53
be you know a one-year-old he wouldn't
06:54
be in
06:56
we don't know all the answers also i
06:58
find it a bit weird that just because he
07:00
works at a funeral home this guy that he
07:02
should be good at
07:03
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
07:05
[Laughter]
07:08
and people brought in and he's like we
07:10
can still save them
07:12
give me five minutes
07:16
i wouldn't trust that guy uh my favorite
07:18
my favorite musher
07:19
uh is a guy called john suter uh and he
07:23
thought
07:23
you know what all these guys are doing
07:24
it wrong with these huskies
07:26
i'm gonna do it with poodles wow and so
07:30
he got some poodles to carry his sled
07:32
or to pull his sled along um he got them
07:34
he brought them up with huskies
07:35
so they kind of learned what to do with
07:37
the huskies uh but unfortunately they
07:39
all got frozen feet
07:41
because the huskies have got special
07:42
padding haven't they and now it's banned
07:44
and you have to have only certain types
07:46
of dog that you're allowed
07:47
it used to be that you could have any
07:48
dog you wanted but surely there weren't
07:50
many winners from the chihuahua team
07:52
[Laughter]
07:55
so do you know what the iditarod is
07:56
based on it's based on an event
07:59
which happened in 1925 called the great
08:00
race of mercy and
08:02
this was a real uh crisis so there was a
08:04
town in gnome
08:05
which had an epidemic of ditheria and it
08:08
was beginning and it was
08:10
you know people were starting to die a
08:12
few people had already died and the
08:13
nearest anti-toxin was a thousand miles
08:15
away
08:15
in 1925 there were only three planes in
08:17
the whole of alaska
08:18
and there were elderly unreliable
08:20
biplanes so they couldn't
08:22
be guaranteed to get there so they went
08:24
with dogs
08:25
and they were hero dogs and hero
08:27
mushrooms who got the antitoxin a
08:28
thousand miles to the town of gnome
08:30
and the uh the guy who approved this
08:34
the governor of alaska who approved this
08:36
his name was scott bone
08:39
so there's a coincidence
08:42
i'm not saying he was a reincarnated dog
08:44
[Laughter]
08:47
and they they um afterwards the lead dog
08:49
balta he became a celebrity he was as
08:51
famous as rin tintin or lassie or all
08:52
these other
08:53
celebrity dogs of the 1920s and um the
08:56
mayor of los angeles awarded balto a
08:57
bone-shaped key to the city
09:02
um i've got a couple of favorites
09:03
favorite uh races
09:05
um so this is so this is two people a
09:08
guy called dallas and a guy called mitch
09:10
their father and son
09:11
and they seem to have this ongoing
09:13
rivalry so in 2012
09:14
dallas seavey became the youngest winner
09:17
he was 25 years old and he won it
09:19
in 2013 his father became the oldest
09:22
ever winner
09:23
um this went on so dallas kept on
09:25
winning it year after year
09:26
in 2016 he broke the record for the
09:29
fastest time it's ever been done so he
09:30
did it in eight days and 11 hours
09:32
and in 2017 the following year his dad
09:35
broke the record
09:36
again in eight days and three hours
09:39
and actually that year the sun dallas's
09:41
dogs turned out to be
09:43
doped now they were they were weirdly
09:45
they were doped with tramadol which
09:47
everyone agreed would not be of any
09:49
benefit at all
09:51
surely they get a nice night's sleep at
09:53
the end of the day
09:55
but yeah i should say his father was not
09:57
a suspect for doping his son's dogs or
09:58
anything but he um this year he
10:00
decided he didn't want to do it right
10:02
because he got um they said that
10:04
basically he doped his dogs he said i
10:05
definitely didn't do it someone else
10:07
must have done it and that he wasn't
10:08
happy about it now he's kind of pulled
10:10
out
10:10
is that why he didn't do it i believe so
10:12
yeah and it was done so much slower this
10:14
year
10:14
it was like nine days something it was
10:16
rubbish
10:18
but actually i should just say a lot of
10:20
people a lot of people don't like the
10:22
dog sledding don't they they think it's
10:23
kind of cruel
10:24
because a lot of the dogs get sick some
10:27
of them die
10:28
we all die
10:38
i'm just saying life is hard it's a lot
10:41
harder if you're pulling your sled
10:44
okay point sorry yeah well the other
10:46
thing is there's lots of things that can
10:48
happen i mean they do die one of the
10:49
worst things they get is um scrotal and
10:51
penile frostbite
10:53
wow okay yeah no
10:57
no i'd like to announce i'm pulling out
10:58
of the next year
11:02
and then i thought i would check to see
11:03
if humans can get frostbite on the
11:05
penises
11:06
because why you went to
11:10
[Laughter]
11:12
iceland
11:15
not why mum shopped there
11:18
well apparently um according to the
11:20
internet the classic account
11:22
of humans getting frostbite on their
11:24
genitals is from the new england journal
11:26
of medicine in 1977
11:28
and there's a doctor called melvin
11:30
hirschkovitz and he went running
11:32
in very cold weather and he he got that
11:36
and it's notable the paper is notable
11:39
because
11:40
once he writes about what happened and
11:42
at one stage his wife comes home
11:44
and finds him standing legs apart in the
11:46
bedroom nude below the waist holding the
11:48
tip of his penis in his right hand
11:50
and turning the pages of the new england
11:52
journal of medicine
11:57
um i was just looking at weird dog
11:59
competitions and there's a there's a
12:01
magazine called veterinary practice news
12:03
and it has an annual x-ray competition
12:05
awarded to dogs who've eaten the
12:06
weirdest things
12:08
and so recently one of the winners was
12:10
uh lola a seven kilo tortoise who'd
12:12
eaten a turtle pendant
12:14
but i think it was our dogs are they
12:17
no sorry it was just pet just perfect um
12:21
but my favorite one was the rottweiler i
12:22
want to see one pulling the sled
12:24
[Laughter]
12:29
my favorite one of these when is was the
12:31
rottweiler who had swallowed her owner's
12:33
wristwatch but the alarm was still on
12:35
telling her when to take her insulin
12:37
so she had to listen to the dog
12:43
[Applause]
12:44
[Music]
12:44
[Applause]
12:46
all right it is time for fact number two
12:49
and that is my fact
12:51
my fact this week is that three thousand
12:53
feet up a mountain in france is a block
12:55
of sandstone commemorating the exact
12:57
spot
12:58
where the author victor hugo's parents
13:00
conceived him
13:03
yeah it's uh this was revealed uh that
13:07
that was the spot where it happened in a
13:08
letter written by his dad who bragged
13:10
about it a lot
13:11
um it was at the top of this mountain uh
13:14
called mount dunham
13:15
uh in france and um he made it to the
13:18
top
13:18
and it was years later this wasn't done
13:20
in his lifetime but years later a museum
13:22
curator
13:23
thought i've got to commemorate this and
13:24
brought a sandstone and it's there to
13:26
this day
13:27
it was kind of a prank wasn't it by the
13:29
guy from the museum in the 60s was it
13:31
i think it was like a practical joke in
13:32
the 1960s but did you know that victor
13:34
hugo denied that that was where it
13:36
happened because he was kind of ashamed
13:38
of this mountain being a mountain that
13:40
wasn't super famous not everyone knew
13:41
about it so whenever he retold the story
13:44
of when he was conceived as we all do
13:46
he he
13:49
made lots of little changes so there'd
13:50
been a celtic temple on mount donnan
13:52
and he changed that to a roman temple of
13:54
love um
13:55
and he changed the mountain range to the
13:57
alps because everyone's heard of the
13:58
alps
13:59
and he made it mont blanc because that's
14:00
3000 feet taller
14:02
and so his version he was a storyteller
14:05
that was what he did
14:06
yeah you're running the risk of
14:08
frostbite to the scrotum
14:10
if you try to conceive at that altitude
14:16
[Applause]
14:18
he told a lot of stories obviously
14:21
namely
14:23
[Music]
14:27
um he claimed that he and his wife adele
14:29
uh had sex
14:30
nine times on their wedding night and
14:32
the telegraph wrote that um
14:34
apparently she lost her taste for
14:35
intercourse after that first night
14:38
and i'm not surprised well he was a sex
14:40
addict wasn't he
14:41
he was um he was constantly uh going to
14:44
brothels
14:45
um he almost had a sort of like
14:47
breakfast sex and then lunchtime sex and
14:49
dinner sex it was almost a menu on a
14:51
day-to-day basis with victor hugo
14:53
to the point of that he was so popular
14:55
amongst the brothels of paris that when
14:57
he died
14:58
the brothels of paris closed down for
14:59
the day so that
15:01
uh everyone working there could come to
15:02
the funeral procession to pay tribute
15:05
i read one account and i'm not sure this
15:07
can be true um but the the prostitutes
15:09
of paris drape their vaginas in black
15:11
crepe paper
15:13
[Laughter]
15:22
that's according to a guy called edmund
15:24
goncar who was there
15:28
[Laughter]
15:37
but what happened was when he died
15:38
everyone thought he was going to die
15:40
and then he kind of stuck around for a
15:41
few weeks and so people came to paris
15:43
expecting for him to die and they were
15:45
going to celebrate his life
15:46
but he went so long more and more and
15:48
more people came and in the end there
15:49
were a crowd of 2 million people at his
15:51
funeral
15:52
which was more than the normal
15:54
population of paris wow
15:56
it was rammed and everyone because he
15:58
was like a famous
15:59
you know sex addict or whatever and you
16:02
know he was a partier
16:03
everyone just got drunk everyone had sex
16:06
there was the story that always happens
16:07
that people say that nine months later
16:09
there were loads of babies born so
16:11
people were saying that you know during
16:12
the funeral everyone was just having sex
16:14
everywhere
16:15
yeah there was a parade at his funeral
16:17
and it took six hours
16:18
for it to get to the end um and there
16:21
were delegations of different
16:22
professions there so there were
16:23
veterans civil servants writers animal
16:25
lovers school children
16:27
suffrage sorry what
16:31
was animal of a formal profession
16:38
who's paying for that
16:44
um but apparently the suffragettes got
16:46
really annoyed because they were behind
16:47
the gymnast at the department stores
16:50
they said we deserve better than this
16:52
wow but it was it was it was um just
16:54
after
16:55
uh his 79th birthday so he had an 80th
16:58
birthday party on his 79th birthday as
17:00
he was entering his 80th year
17:02
and for that one half a million people
17:03
just walked past his house as he sat
17:05
outside waving at them
17:07
and then the next day because that was
17:09
his apartment in paris
17:10
um they changed the street name from
17:13
where he was living so it got changed to
17:15
become
17:16
avenue victor hugo so his remaining days
17:18
he lived on the street named after him
17:21
and he he would say that he would we
17:23
wanted all the future
17:24
uh mail that came to him to be addressed
17:27
to mr victor
17:28
in his avenue paris and that would make
17:32
it to him
17:33
he said he wanted a pauper's burial at
17:35
pawpa's funeral and he obviously had the
17:37
complete opposite
17:38
but i'm not totally convinced he wants
17:40
it there's one biography of him
17:42
which kind of seems to suggest that he's
17:44
obviously famous for being a proponent
17:46
of uh you know helping out the poor and
17:48
les miserables all about the awful
17:49
conditions people lived in
17:50
but he really liked people to know it so
17:52
for instance apparently
17:53
he liked people to ask him why he was
17:55
wearing his coat inside out
17:57
because then he'd say to them i just
17:59
wear it inside out rather than buying a
18:00
new one and then i can give that money
18:02
to the poor
18:03
and he really he really liked to invite
18:05
this kind
18:06
of wanker
18:10
i know right apparently according to
18:12
this person he actually left in his will
18:15
what the biographer describes as an
18:17
exiguous sum a very small amount in his
18:19
will to the poor
18:20
because he knew how rumors work and he
18:23
knew that that would become an enormous
18:24
amount within a short amount of time
18:27
apparently he was so famous when he was
18:28
living in guernsey that um
18:30
admirers would save the pebbles that he
18:32
walked upon when he was walking across
18:34
the beach
18:34
wow so he would they were like he's
18:36
still on that one i'll take that
18:39
wow yeah yeah apparently i mean it
18:41
doesn't sound very true doesn't it
18:44
is it from did he tell us that or
18:47
it's hard to tell he was kind of he was
18:49
paid in a very unusual way for les mis
18:51
because he he said i think to his
18:52
publisher
18:53
his publisher said how much he won and
18:54
he made him quite a high offer and he
18:56
said no that's not enough and he said i
18:58
think he said i'd like to be paid more
18:59
than anyone else has ever been paid to
19:01
write a book
19:02
and i'll give some to the public
19:05
um but the publisher didn't have the
19:07
money to pay it was i think the
19:08
equivalent of about three million pounds
19:09
which is a huge amount of money and the
19:11
publisher didn't have that money
19:12
so he had to borrow all of that from a
19:14
bank so it was kind of a private finance
19:17
initiative novel basically and then the
19:19
publisher just borrowed in the
19:20
assumption that it would pay off and it
19:22
did yeah it was huge wasn't it when it
19:24
was published people turned up with
19:25
wheelbarrows to buy copies of it
19:27
what how big was it it is a big buck
19:30
and wheelbarrows at the time were very
19:32
small
19:35
but what happened is you would go in if
19:37
you were a worker and you could get some
19:39
time off and you can afford
19:40
to uh get the book and you could queue
19:42
up and get there in time with your
19:43
wheelbarrow
19:44
then you could sell it to your friends
19:46
and you could make a massive profit on
19:48
it it was like uh ticket talenting kind
19:49
of thing yeah wow
19:51
he was quite arrogant though wasn't he
19:54
he wanted to be paid all the money in
19:55
the world
19:56
and he used to he was it was a party
19:58
animal so he
19:59
apparently used to have 30 guests
20:01
rounded in every single night right up
20:02
until he was 80
20:03
when he died um but he then did at these
20:06
big dinner parties used to spend the
20:08
whole time talking about how great he
20:10
was he would say
20:11
there is only one classical writer in
20:13
this country
20:14
one do you hear me i am the only one i
20:17
know the french language better than
20:19
anyone else alive
20:20
and then sorry i just asked if you
20:21
wanted red or white wine
20:26
and then he'd catalogue all like balzac
20:29
and racine
20:30
and all the other great writers and
20:32
explain why they were not as good as he
20:34
was
20:34
there was one time when he wouldn't talk
20:36
about himself in these parties and that
20:38
was when he did his party trick which
20:39
was putting a whole orange into his
20:41
mouth
20:42
and then thrusting as many pieces of
20:44
sugar as possible into his cheeks
20:46
and then scrunching it all up swallowing
20:48
two liquor glasses of kish
20:50
and then opening his mouth and saying
20:52
i've just eaten it all
20:53
right so that was his trick he could eat
20:55
an orange and a load of sugar
20:56
really quickly and people still talk
20:59
about his novels
21:02
we're gonna have to move on very shortly
21:04
um the guy who wrote the the lyrics for
21:06
the musical of les mis
21:07
he was a guy called james fenton he
21:09
wrote the the first lyrics lots of
21:11
people
21:11
i haven't had to go to the lyrics but
21:12
when he was given the book and told hey
21:14
why don't you have a look at the lyrics
21:15
but that's turning this novel into
21:16
lyrics he was on a three-month trip
21:18
looking for headhunters in borneo
21:20
and it was a really heavy book and he
21:22
said that every he spent three months in
21:24
a canoe reading les mis and every time
21:26
he finished a chapter he threw it to the
21:28
crocodile so he could save a bit of
21:29
weight
21:30
in the canoe that's very cool he did you
21:32
know he trended on twitter in 2014
21:35
for a kind of related reason so he
21:37
trended on twitter and not in a good way
21:40
it turned out the bbc reported this that
21:41
he was suddenly victor hugo was
21:43
receiving
21:44
all these death threats on twitter and
21:45
he was being called lots of stuff he was
21:47
called
21:47
the son of a prostitute his daughter was
21:49
called a big
21:51
and
21:55
it turned out what happened was um one
21:57
of his poems had been set in a french
21:59
baccalaureate exam
22:01
and they were so annoyed about it
22:03
because it's so imaginable that all the
22:05
students got online afterwards
22:07
like they got him trending isn't that i
22:10
think you know you've made it when
22:10
you're getting death threats on twitter
22:12
200 years
22:12
[Laughter]
22:16
okay it's time to move on to fact number
22:18
three and that is
22:20
james okay my fact this week is in the
22:22
event
22:23
of a zombie apocalypse only one country
22:26
will survive
22:27
and that country is north korea
22:31
really yeah and so this is a study by
22:34
some
22:34
mathematicians in brazil and they've
22:37
kind of done a model of what's going to
22:38
happen and it's going to be like a
22:39
straight fight between human and zombie
22:41
and the zombie's always going to win but
22:43
if you get a human with a gun
22:45
like in the army then the human might
22:47
win and they've worked out that what
22:48
you're going to need is 47
22:50
soldiers per 1000 capita in order to
22:53
survive
22:54
and there's only one country with that
22:55
many people and that is north korea
22:58
and they have also the advantage of
22:59
being completely separate from everyone
23:01
else so it's gonna be difficult for the
23:02
zombies to get in
23:04
uh the borders are very you know guarded
23:06
and stuff like that
23:07
so if the zombies come that's where's
23:09
the best place to go
23:11
uh in all of the circumstances don't
23:13
bother
23:17
i was reading uh my assumption is as if
23:19
you were killed by a zombie
23:21
it would be through your brains being
23:23
eaten and you're being attacked
23:24
according to max brooks max brooks is an
23:27
author who wrote the zombie survival
23:29
guide he wrote the movie world war z
23:31
of the book rather world war z which was
23:32
made into the brad pitt movie
23:34
um so he studied in a very serious way
23:36
what he thought would be the way that
23:38
you would be most likely to die in a
23:39
zombie apocalypse and his
23:41
main reason for anyone's death is that
23:44
you would die
23:45
from explosive diarrhea and it's because
23:48
water
23:48
would become so scarce that you would be
23:50
forced to drink from puddles
23:52
puddles are very dangerous to get water
23:53
from you can see why they don't make
23:55
most of the zombie films about the whole
23:57
explosive diarrhea puddle
23:59
issues yeah i wouldn't want to i did
24:03
look
24:04
up uh because there are so many zombie
24:05
films and they're quite cheap to make
24:07
obviously because all you need is some
24:08
willing extras with a load of you know
24:09
makeup on and um a lot of them are quite
24:12
low quality but i went through a list of
24:13
all the zombie films i could find online
24:15
i just want to share a few of the titles
24:16
because they're great um so i mean there
24:19
are your classic things like boy eats
24:21
girl very clever
24:22
um there's uh erotic nights of the
24:24
living dead
24:26
there's flights of the living dead which
24:28
is a plane-based zombie film
24:30
my favorite one i like the explosive
24:32
diarrhea one shites at the living
24:34
therapy
24:36
[Applause]
24:39
[Music]
24:43
i've got a third one it's not as good as
24:44
that
24:47
it's called poultry geist night of the
24:49
chicken dead
24:54
a tiny little nugget about the world war
24:56
z movie by the way that was made which
24:58
is just a cool bit of trivia which is
24:59
that
25:00
um one of the actors in the movie was
25:02
peter capaldi
25:04
and peter capaldi was cast as a world
25:06
health organization
25:08
doctor so he was a who
25:12
doctor
25:16
and what it was is that the filmmakers
25:18
had inside knowledge that he was going
25:20
to be announced as the doctor this was
25:21
before
25:22
doctor who and uh so it's a subtle
25:25
easter egg yeah oh and none of us
25:27
guessed based on that we should have
25:29
known that
25:30
staring us in the face and people are
25:32
scientists
25:33
and people at universities are always
25:35
kind of writing analyses of what happens
25:37
in a zombie apocalypse
25:38
it happens really in a lot of places and
25:40
i think it's kind of a way of engaging
25:42
people by making something sound fun
25:43
when actually it's a paper about
25:45
statistical
25:46
uh projections
25:49
which for a lot of people is fun but one
25:52
one example of this was the university
25:54
of ottawa a few years ago published a
25:56
paper with an equation in it
25:58
explaining how fast we'd have to deal
26:00
with the zombie apocalypse so
26:01
the paper's called when zombies attack
26:03
mathematical modelling of an outbreak of
26:05
zombie infection
26:06
and one of the paper's authors the
26:07
professor in charge was called robert j
26:10
smith question mark and
26:13
it turns out that the guy who wrote this
26:15
paper has put a question mark on the end
26:18
of his name and i looked him up and if
26:19
you go to his academic page on the
26:21
website at the university
26:23
he says yeah that's not a typo i really
26:25
do have a question mark on the end of my
26:26
name
26:27
do you have any idea what it's like to
26:28
live with such an incredibly common name
26:30
that you'll never ever show up on google
26:36
i had to do something how do you how do
26:38
you think he pronounces it
26:40
it's robert smith
26:43
definitely or he might just say question
26:45
mark at the end maybe yeah
26:47
but he then also says i did go to his
26:48
page i saw this as well he then follows
26:50
up by saying how do you stick out on
26:52
google he then goes
26:53
actually you still don't stick out on
26:54
google
26:56
so it hasn't really worked i like the
26:58
other one who he wanted to stick out
27:00
against who is robert smith
27:08
i've got a bit of good news in the
27:09
zombie world to come good
27:11
we're going to win it's going to be fine
27:13
it's going to be absolutely fine we're
27:15
going to win within about a week
27:16
guys okay did someone boom
27:21
look at your priorities mate
27:24
um so there's a there's an article by a
27:26
scientist called david misojewski and he
27:28
said
27:28
that nature would destroy zombies before
27:31
they could destroy us
27:32
so obviously all animals will be packing
27:34
away at them they're dead they're not
27:35
very fast with their reactions
27:36
but the main thing is microorganisms
27:38
would go to town on them
27:40
bacteria fungi molds insects
27:42
flesh-eating beetles i think it's a bit
27:44
cocky for you to say we're gonna win in
27:46
that situation our allies
27:48
in the microorganism world
27:51
will join us in a coalition of the lives
27:57
that's really good point that's such
27:59
good logic they can decompose a rabbit
28:01
right down to the bones in a week
28:02
so they'll have they'll go to town on
28:05
these things um
28:06
he did say that in his kind of world
28:09
animals can't get the same disease that
28:11
humans were getting
28:12
do you know what i mean so the animals
28:14
can't become zombies in his kind of idea
28:16
if the animals can become zombies as
28:18
well then it's a whole different ball
28:19
game sure if you're getting attacked by
28:22
zombie microorganisms
28:25
that is not a great movie either i must
28:26
admit but
28:28
there's someone else who's published
28:30
advice on how to escape zombies how to
28:32
survive a zombie attack
28:33
is the cdc the center for disease
28:35
control in america
28:37
and this was obviously kind of a pr
28:39
thing to try and get people actually
28:41
onto their website so they learned how
28:42
to survive genuine crises
28:44
but um it's quite funny because if you
28:46
do go to the site now they've got a
28:47
zombie preparedness page a zombie
28:49
preparedness blog
28:50
they've got a zombie preparedness
28:52
booklet for educators
28:54
that they will send send out but they
28:56
don't really conceal their true purpose
28:58
very well so the tips they give are
29:00
things like
29:01
stock up on water food and other
29:03
supplies to get you through the first
29:04
couple of days before you can
29:06
locate a zombie-free refugee camp
29:08
brackets
29:09
or in the case of a natural disaster it
29:11
will buy you some time to get to an
29:12
evacuation shelter or until utility
29:14
lines are restored close brackets
29:17
it's always like you know do first aid
29:20
supplies in case that horrible zombie
29:21
bites you
29:22
also will come in handy in a tornado or
29:24
a hurricane
29:28
one other thing that might help us if
29:30
the zombies attack um to win
29:32
is the reverse zombie tick oh okay this
29:35
is an
29:35
animal um a little tick and if it bites
29:38
you it makes you
29:39
allergic to meat and so the idea is what
29:42
we might do
29:43
is kind of work out what makes that
29:45
happen and then we can inject it into
29:47
the zombies make them allergic to eating
29:49
us
29:49
and then we're saved but just because a
29:51
zombie's got hives doesn't mean that
29:53
you're not then a zombie
30:02
do you guys know that zombies make an
30:04
appearance in amazon's
30:06
terms and services conditions you know
30:08
that when you go and you sign that
30:10
massive twenty six thousand yeah we all
30:12
read it
30:14
well then you oh well then this won't be
30:15
a surprise
30:17
someone did read the whole thing and
30:18
they discovered that there's a passage
30:20
uh in it which reads however so that it
30:23
just comes into this however
30:24
this restriction will not apply in the
30:26
event of the occurrence
30:27
of a widespread viral infection
30:29
transmitted via bytes or contact with
30:31
bodily fluids that cause human corpses
30:33
to reanimate
30:34
and seek to consume living human flesh
30:37
blood
30:38
brain or nerve tissue and is likely to
30:40
result in the fall of organized
30:41
civilization
30:44
that's in amazon's actual terms that's
30:47
very fun
30:47
conditions yeah is that it feels like
30:50
they're testing us to check we're
30:51
reading them
30:51
exactly and as the news of the last two
30:53
months has taught us nobody has read any
30:55
of it
30:57
we need to move on shortly there is uh
31:00
uh just on on animal
31:01
uh zombie sort of uh para parasites and
31:04
the way they spread
31:05
there is a fly called apocephalus
31:06
borealis and it lays eggs inside
31:08
bumblebees and the amazing thing is that
31:10
the infected bee
31:11
then stops working and it starts acting
31:13
like a moth it starts being
31:15
flying around lights and this kind of
31:16
thing while the um while the parasite is
31:19
preparing to
31:20
burst out basically but that means that
31:22
there are zom
31:30
bees
31:32
very cool it's a very forgiving audience
31:35
tonight
31:38
okay it is time for our final fact of
31:40
the show and that is
31:42
andy my fact is that the 1930s actor
31:44
george arliss
31:45
once booked himself into the left
31:47
luggage office at charing cross as a
31:48
parcel in order to escape people who
31:50
wanted his autograph
31:54
what a guy i've never heard of this guy
31:55
before but he was very famous at the
31:57
time
31:57
and he wrote in his memoir that he was
31:59
being chased by by people who who were
32:01
desperate uh for his autograph and so he
32:03
said
32:04
with presence of mind worthy of a great
32:06
general i thought of the left luggage
32:07
office
32:08
it was just behind me close to the
32:09
platform i turned to the man in charge
32:11
and demanded the right to book myself in
32:12
as a parcel
32:14
i paid my twopins and the man took me
32:15
over the counter and i was saved
32:20
he took him over the counter
32:23
it's amazing what you could get for two
32:25
pence in those days
32:28
um he was uh i hadn't heard of him
32:30
either and he was uh he was very famous
32:32
in his time he was the first british
32:34
actor to ever win
32:35
an academy award for a leading actor yes
32:38
he won it as well
32:39
for playing benjamin disraeli uh the
32:41
british prime minister
32:43
and he um then won it again a few years
32:46
later
32:47
for playing benjamin disraeli he played
32:49
the same role
32:50
and got given it twice he was the first
32:52
person to do that reprising a role
32:54
and getting it a second time and was
32:56
that one was silent wasn't it and then
32:58
the other one was a talkie
32:59
thing that's right yeah and and he also
33:01
uh victor hugoly
33:03
uh was very egotistical as well um
33:06
he was he had to do a court appearance
33:08
once he was called to a just a court
33:10
hearing
33:10
and get to give a testament and um he
33:13
called himself the world's
33:14
greatest living actor and to explain his
33:18
statement he said you see
33:19
i'm on the oath so he was a real kind of
33:22
dick um i really like
33:26
victor hugoley
33:28
[Applause]
33:30
there was one one other instance of his
33:32
egotism that i read about was in a film
33:34
called the man who played god
33:36
which was about a concert pianist who
33:38
then fell on hard times
33:39
but he stuck to the script totally
33:41
except there was one bit of the script
33:43
where
33:43
the line was um someone came up to the
33:46
pianist after the show and congratulated
33:48
him on the performance and the line was
33:50
so glad you liked it
33:52
and he changed it to so glad you liked
33:54
me
33:56
someone's just gone through the script
33:57
in the film and gone oh
33:59
he changed that didn't he man
34:02
and so on autograph hunting autograph
34:05
collectors i didn't know this there is a
34:06
magazine called autograph collector
34:08
which is all about collecting autographs
34:10
how to do it how to get different people
34:12
and various tactics and things like that
34:14
and they do a lot on the history of
34:15
autograph collecting too because some
34:17
people
34:18
sell them obviously some people collect
34:19
loads and loads of them at the same time
34:21
yeah
34:21
and they described one incident in 1934
34:24
when the australian cricket team came to
34:26
england
34:26
and in those days they had to get the
34:28
ship to england to play the ashes and so
34:30
on
34:30
and the junior batsman arthur
34:32
chippenfield had to spend almost the
34:34
entire
34:35
journey on the steamship forging on bats
34:38
and on sheets of paper the signatures of
34:39
the rest of the team
34:40
who couldn't be asked to sign
34:44
luckily that was the last time the
34:45
australian team did anything fraudulent
34:54
and we will be touring australia in may
34:57
so
34:58
tickets are they weren't available but
35:00
some have now come
35:01
available it's really odd
35:04
wow and there was an autograph hunter uh
35:08
quite famous one in his in his little
35:10
area he was called tommy scullion he was
35:12
an irish grocery driver
35:14
and he and his family are in tonight
35:19
he devoted his whole life to getting um
35:22
to getting autographs
35:23
he had more than 40 000 in total wow
35:26
they had picasso he had franco he had
35:28
charles manson he had the great win
35:30
so he wasn't discriminating in the whole
35:33
good
35:33
evil metric
35:37
i'll be honest there's not much good in
35:39
this list
35:41
but he left a will in the end he died
35:43
quite recently he left the will and he
35:44
bequeathed his collection to the village
35:46
museum
35:47
unfortunately in his hometown there was
35:50
no village museum
35:51
[Laughter]
35:53
so they auctioned it instead
35:56
they have these people have been around
35:58
so much longer than i
36:00
imagined autograph hunters so they were
36:02
particularly prevalent in the late 19th
36:05
century early 20th century
36:06
and they were thought of as a total
36:08
scourge so if you look back on old
36:10
newspapers from
36:11
the early 1900s written about in such an
36:14
awful way there was an article in new
36:16
york times in 1901
36:18
that said autograph hunters excel in
36:20
ways that are dark and tricks that are
36:22
vain
36:22
mark twain hated them mark twain had a
36:25
letter
36:26
pre-printed that explained his refusal
36:28
when people wrote to him for an
36:29
autograph
36:29
and the letter explained that if he
36:32
answered all these requests he wouldn't
36:33
have time to get anything else done
36:34
and also the asking for an autograph is
36:36
asking for example of his writing
36:38
and he's a writer so you're asking for a
36:40
sample of his own work
36:42
and he said uh it wouldn't be fair to
36:44
ask a doctor for one of his corpses to
36:46
remember him by would it
36:48
what what a stupid analogy
36:51
corpses are not the work that doctors
36:54
produce
36:56
well some very bad doctors but
37:00
i just made this feel free to try the
37:02
mouth to mouth the mouth to mouth
37:07
uh two more things about your statement
37:13
firstly sometimes artists can help
37:15
people with their art there was a i read
37:16
that mozart's used to when he was
37:18
walking the streets
37:19
if he came across someone who was
37:20
homeless asking him for money there's
37:22
one instance that's recorded where he
37:23
didn't have anything on him but he was
37:25
so quick at writing music that he got a
37:27
paper and pen
37:28
composed a new piece gave it to the
37:29
person and said there's a music
37:31
publisher that will give you money for
37:32
this so take this there
37:33
that's point number one point number two
37:36
is that um
37:37
that's amazing mozart yeah mozart
37:39
dubious yeah someone shouted out julian
37:42
but um no the other thing is that um so
37:45
you said that mark twain
37:46
said this sent them this letter saying
37:48
i'm not gonna sign you a signature
37:49
steve martin the comedian actor he does
37:51
the same thing but in a positive way so
37:53
he doesn't do signatures either what he
37:55
does is if you meet steve martin he
37:57
gives you a card
37:58
a business card that's pre-signed and on
38:00
it is written in the words
38:02
this certifies that you've had a
38:03
personal encounter with me
38:06
and that you found me warm polite
38:08
intelligent
38:09
and funny that's great that's what he
38:12
gives everyone who meets him
38:15
last year there was a collection of
38:16
beatles autographs which sold
38:18
for two thousand pounds even though
38:21
three of them were fake
38:22
okay and the reason they sold for two
38:24
thousand pounds is that
38:26
they were all done by john lennon oh
38:29
cool because in the early days sometimes
38:32
they weren't all there or any one of
38:33
those who would just fake it yeah that's
38:35
cool so he was doing a prank at the time
38:37
presumably
38:38
well he kind of got them almost all
38:39
right he got george moringa bang on but
38:41
he didn't really bother with paul
38:43
even in the early days the signs were
38:44
there
38:47
i went on to ebay to look for the most
38:50
expensive autographs at the moment
38:52
um the most expensive one when i checked
38:54
which was a day ago
38:55
was 351 493 pounds and 85
39:00
pence and it was it looks like you're
39:03
gonna guess
39:03
andy is it someone alive or dead uh dead
39:06
male or female
39:07
male 1 hancock henry viii no
39:12
uh
39:19
you're just not gonna guess okay who is
39:21
it actually i think he's dead hugh
39:23
hefner
39:27
thousand yeah yeah so he's three hefner
39:29
i know i know
39:30
it's a number one edition of playboy
39:32
with his signature
39:34
but that is 351 000. um bob dylan's
39:37
signed handwritten lyrics to like a
39:39
rolling stone
39:40
only thousand 140 hundred and ninety
39:42
seven pounds and fifty four
39:44
it's still a lot of money guys there's
39:45
only two outrages
39:50
change but a fifth a fifth the price of
39:52
the uh hugh hefner one for seventy
39:54
thousand you can get the apollo
39:56
11 space flown u.s flag signed by all
39:59
three astronauts
40:00
on the apollo 11 all right that actually
40:02
we could share between us
40:03
[Laughter]
40:07
we can do it and then we'll have to have
40:09
an incredibly complicated timeshare
40:13
and the lowest prices 75p an eastenders
40:17
signed photo of simon williams
40:20
who plays hugo in eastenders he's
40:23
actually got an exclamation mark after
40:25
his name
40:26
actually i've never heard we ages ago
40:29
when our vinyl came out
40:31
we went we we went to a record shop and
40:34
did a signing at a record shop and we
40:36
did a few signatures on
40:38
on ones that they hadn't sold that they
40:39
were going to keep online in their store
40:41
so we
40:41
we checked if they were still in stock
40:43
online they were
40:46
the the unsigned unsigned vinyl was 19
40:51
pounds
40:51
99 the signed vinyl was
40:54
20 pounds we are worth between us
40:58
one penny
41:05
i wow be signing up to the show tonight
41:09
just on the on the astronauts apollo 11
41:12
thing one of the things that was a
41:13
contingency for the families of the
41:15
apollo 11
41:16
space mission was that neil armstrong
41:18
buzz aldrin and michael collins signed a
41:20
lot of signatures to give to their
41:21
family so that if they didn't make it
41:23
back
41:23
they the families could sell the
41:25
signatures to make money to keep the
41:27
family
41:27
um yeah going okay it was a they signed
41:30
hundreds of signatures going
41:32
if we don't make it back sell these and
41:33
this will help my family continue
41:36
yeah yeah um stephen king
41:41
that's that's very sad right it's not
41:43
sad
41:44
they were okay
41:58
is one of the few where the sequels get
42:00
better and better
42:03
we're gonna have to wrap up shortly
42:06
there's one amazing story about
42:07
autographs that stephen king tells i was
42:09
watching him
42:10
uh give a talk on stage about this thing
42:13
that happened when he was 26 years old
42:15
and he'd never been recognized and asked
42:16
for an autograph before
42:18
it was in his early days and he was in a
42:20
restaurant and
42:21
he was really sick he was really ill he
42:24
had some kind of horrible stomach bug
42:25
and so he had to be really close to the
42:26
bathrooms at all times and at one point
42:28
he had to rush to the bathrooms
42:30
and he went in and i don't know what
42:31
kind of weird restaurant this was but
42:32
there were no
42:33
doors on the bathroom on the toilet
42:36
stalls
42:36
um so he just had to have his stomach
42:39
complaint
42:40
in full view of the rest of the bathroom
42:42
and so he went in and he
42:44
sort of explosively shot all into this
42:46
toilet
42:47
zombie zombie
42:48
[Laughter]
42:50
sign and he did this and he's feeling
42:53
terrible he was saying he was on this
42:54
toilet the door open thinking things
42:55
can't get any worse
42:56
and there was a toilet attendant in
42:58
there who he said was about 108 years
43:00
old
43:00
and while he was in the middle of this
43:02
awful experience
43:04
the toilet attendant came up to him with
43:06
a pad of paper and a pen
43:07
and said aren't you stephen king
43:13
so stephen king gave his first requested
43:15
autograph
43:16
on the loo while having diarrhea

00:18
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:22
no such thing as a fish
00:24
a weekly podcast this week coming to you
00:27
live
00:28
from perth in australia
00:31
[Applause]
00:35
my name is dan schreiber and i am
00:38
sitting here with anna chazinski andrew
00:41
hunter murray
00:42
james harkin and once again we have
00:45
gathered around the microphones with our
00:46
four favorite facts from the last seven
00:48
days
00:49
and in no particular order here we go
00:52
starting with you
00:53
chesinski yeah my fact this week is that
00:55
in the 1960s
00:57
brazil and france almost went to war
00:59
with each other
01:00
over whether lobsters crawl or swim
01:06
what a just war it would have been
01:09
whose side are you on whose side are you
01:12
on uh
01:12
i think they crawl oh i think they swim
01:16
yeah i will see you on the battlefield
01:20
okay i assume they do both right yeah
01:23
the classic switzerland
01:24
in the corner um no so it is a problem
01:27
that they do both
01:28
because this is so this is the fact that
01:30
in 1961 a french fisherman
01:32
found that the water off the coast of
01:34
brazil was full of lobsters
01:35
and they wanted to fish them so they
01:37
could get money from selling the
01:38
lobsters
01:39
and so they started fishing them but
01:41
brazil claimed
01:42
exclusive rights to see creatures that
01:45
were walking along the continental shelf
01:48
within a certain like diameter or radius
01:50
of brazil
01:51
so if creatures were walking uh in that
01:54
area
01:54
then brazil had a right to them and no
01:56
one else did but if they were swimming
01:58
in that area
01:59
then they did not and so this huge
02:00
argument uh
02:02
came forward about whether they were
02:04
walking or swimming and the friends said
02:06
that they were swimming so they were
02:07
open to anyone
02:08
because lobsters do sometimes swim and
02:10
so they said we're allowed to fish for
02:11
these lobsters brazilians said they
02:13
crawled
02:14
there was actually i think there was a
02:16
moment where the brazilian
02:18
admiral of the brazilian navy said that
02:21
if you're saying that lobsters swim
02:23
you're also saying that a kangaroo would
02:25
be considered a bird when it hops
02:28
that is fighting talk
02:31
but it it really came to blows so there
02:34
was this huge debate and eventually
02:36
brazil said
02:37
france can you please go away these
02:39
things are crawling and
02:40
france refused and had a destroyer ship
02:43
accompany their lobster boats a warship
02:45
and in response brazil mobilized its
02:48
warships including an
02:49
aircraft carrier
02:53
and then both of these sides are ready
02:54
for battle and this lasted for two years
02:56
they were sitting there with the
02:57
battleships
02:58
poised ready to fight each other over
03:00
whether lobsters crawled or swim
03:02
and then eventually some laws of the sea
03:04
were put into force
03:05
saying look guys chill the out
03:09
put the official wording on the law it
03:11
was yeah
03:13
and um yeah war didn't happen and rights
03:16
were granted to brazil
03:17
because of a fishing act and it was okay
03:19
but we were pretty close guys
03:21
wow yeah it seems to me that um
03:24
countries are always going to war over
03:25
fish other things living in the sea so
03:28
there's been a turbot war between canada
03:30
and spain
03:31
a crab war between north and south korea
03:34
there was um an oyster war between
03:36
maryland the state
03:37
versus pirates cool oh
03:40
there was a mackerel war between uk and
03:42
iceland the prom war between india and
03:44
sri lanka a squid war between the uk and
03:46
argentina
03:47
a scallop conflict between the uk and
03:50
france
03:52
a catfish dispute between the us and
03:55
vietnam
03:56
and the sprat spat between latvia and
03:59
russia
04:00
wow that's amazing god fish are real
04:03
troublemakers aren't they
04:05
and so on lobsters which oh yeah believe
04:08
this was about um so
04:09
the caribbean so the thing that this was
04:12
originally about it was a caribbean
04:13
spiny lobster which was a kind of rock
04:15
lobster
04:16
but this is a kind of lobster that cues
04:20
so a very british brand of lobster but
04:23
when they migrate
04:24
they form orderly single file cues
04:27
so they migrate seasonally because they
04:29
want to get away from cold water
04:31
and these you know these are the most
04:32
precious lobsters um on that coastline
04:35
and yeah they cling to each other and
04:38
form an orderly queue
04:39
and move a single file each rest is
04:42
antennae
04:42
over the sort of arse of the lobster in
04:45
front
04:46
and they move like a conga that's so
04:48
exciting
04:50
yeah i read that in um north america
04:52
back when the european settlers first
04:54
went there for the first time there was
04:55
so
04:56
much lobster in the water that they
04:57
would wash up onto the shore
04:59
in piles two feet high like a
05:02
tsunam the tiny tsunami of
05:06
of lobster tiny and delicious
05:10
i've got a fact about releasing putting
05:11
lobsters into the sea
05:13
which is a thing that sometimes people
05:14
do so this was in britain in 2017
05:17
two buddhists were fined 15 000 pounds
05:20
for releasing
05:20
700 live lobsters and crabs into the sea
05:23
off brighton
05:24
and they did it as a life release
05:26
ceremony which is a thing you might want
05:27
to do if you're a buddhist
05:28
and unfortunately they weren't native
05:30
and they had the potential to destroy
05:31
ecosystems
05:32
and the government had to try and catch
05:34
them again only 323 were recovered so
05:36
there are still about 400 out there
05:38
yeah this is a this is a real problem
05:40
though this has happened in australia as
05:42
well genuinely and in america
05:43
so it's the fang shang ceremony it's a
05:45
buddhist ceremony which is about
05:47
returning
05:48
life to where it's meant to be but it's
05:50
always returning non-native
05:52
creatures to an unfamiliar habitat and
05:55
they always wipe out local ecosystems
05:57
and yeah so it happens with lobsters in
05:59
australia
06:00
uh and in china america do buddhists
06:02
have like the equivalent of a confession
06:04
booth that they go into
06:06
like forgive me um monk father i don't
06:09
know what it would be
06:10
llama forgive me forgive me llama where
06:12
i've sinned
06:13
i i tried to save a life but i've
06:16
destroyed an entire
06:18
ecosystem that's 12 reincarnations that
06:21
you've been deducted
06:26
um you know peter the people for the
06:28
ethical treatment of animals we've
06:29
discussed them a few times
06:31
and they kind of suggest that people
06:33
might want to do this thing as well
06:34
which they call lobster liberation
06:36
and they have posters they put posters
06:38
up saying being boiled hurts
06:40
lobster liberation but unfortunately the
06:43
lobster in their picture is bright red
06:44
which means it's already been cooked
06:49
lobsters do have a very very tough time
06:51
so whenever they molt
06:52
um they have to obviously they have to
06:54
get rid of their old shell
06:56
to grow larger but they have to lose
06:58
half their claw weight
06:59
because otherwise the claw is too big to
07:01
fit out of the old shell
07:03
and the claw muscles are so massive
07:04
because obviously that's what lobsters
07:06
are like um they have to rip they've got
07:09
very slim wrists
07:10
so they have to rip the claw basically
07:13
when
07:13
they try to mold they have to rip out
07:15
the lining of their throat their stomach
07:17
and their anus which is wow i think
07:20
that's the trifecta of things you don't
07:21
want to rip out
07:22
[Laughter]
07:26
what that's the least classy use of the
07:27
word trifecta
07:30
yeah but they are they're weird aren't
07:32
they i was reading on national
07:33
geographic that they
07:34
so okay their brain is located in their
07:36
throat their nervous system in their
07:38
abdomen their teeth in their stomach
07:40
their kidneys in their head they hear
07:43
through their legs and they taste with
07:44
their feet
07:45
they're all over the shop so the bladder
07:48
being very
07:49
much in the head means that they urinate
07:51
out of their faces
07:52
and urinating is very important to
07:55
lobsters and especially female lobsters
07:57
because it's quite sexy
07:58
so the way that female lobsters seduce
08:01
male lobsters is that they urinate out
08:03
of their face
08:04
into the male lobster's den that is sexy
08:07
oh you wouldn't want imagine your
08:09
letterbox in the morning
08:12
oh no it's valentine's day
08:16
well it's very attractive in some
08:18
circles but
08:20
yeah the females urinate and the male
08:22
dens until the male is attracted enough
08:23
to the urine
08:24
or things i really need to get rid of
08:26
this urine somehow so he invites the
08:28
female
08:28
in and then immediately she gets naked
08:30
so as soon as she's been invited in
08:32
she sheds all of her shell and also
08:36
i think this is really insulting the
08:38
other thing that the female sheds
08:39
when she gets into a lobster's den is
08:42
the pouch where she had banked the sperm
08:44
from the prior mate
08:48
i'll just leave this by the door
08:52
can she put back her shell on if if he's
08:55
not interested
08:56
no no well you can't rip out the lining
08:59
of your throat stomach and anus and then
09:01
say
09:02
i've missed those i've misread those
09:05
sides
09:07
i'll just get my pouches for him and be
09:08
on my way hey we need to move on to our
09:11
next fact shortly
09:12
i think we should honestly give a shout
09:13
out to the amazing lobsters which are
09:16
the largest
09:17
freshwater invertebrates on earth which
09:19
is the tasmanian lobster and
09:22
yeah they're incredible so they're the
09:24
size of kind of a
09:26
normal sized dog and they're extremely
09:29
strong
09:30
and the dogs come in lots of different
09:31
sizes that's one of the main things
09:34
about dogs they're like a cocker spaniel
09:37
wow wow they are extremely big they live
09:40
to be 60 years old
09:42
at least and they can break human bones
09:44
so with their claws or they can crush
09:46
beer bottles
09:47
and they're yeah they're just incredible
09:50
and they can't
09:50
breed until they're 14 years old
09:53
[Laughter]
09:55
which we laugh at but we're humans
09:56
that's literally the same as humans
09:58
but breed
10:06
lobster gets to 14 it goes
10:13
that's better fittingly it does make
10:15
that noise
10:18
a reason
10:23
okay it is time for fact number two
10:26
and that is james okay my fact this week
10:29
is that in 1350 there was a man called
10:32
williams stand upright
10:38
and he annoyed everyone else in his
10:40
village so much
10:41
that every single one of them moved away
10:44
wow
10:49
he sounds awesome do we do we know
10:52
anything about
10:52
what he did well so the thing is this
10:55
comes from the parish roles uh in
10:57
england so it's where
10:59
if you're a historian it's a really good
11:00
place to get like all the really small
11:02
things that happen in the villages
11:04
uh and in this one in particular it says
11:06
the coroner testifies that williams
11:08
stand upright
11:09
is so quarrelsome and rancorous that
11:12
none of the lord's tenants can
11:14
bear to live in the village because of
11:15
him and he has caused the village to be
11:17
deserted
11:20
and then by 1356 so that's six years
11:23
later he had also left the village
11:27
presumably because he had no one left to
11:28
argue with
11:30
that's amazing yeah and that's all we
11:33
know about him
11:34
like it's a lot of these things these
11:36
kind of parish things
11:37
all you see is a very very tiny snapshot
11:39
of people's lives
11:41
right it's amazing so for instance in
11:42
1328
11:44
john franci claimed two shillings in
11:46
damages because
11:47
alice devaney's had accused his wife of
11:49
wearing her short jacket before
11:51
easter whoa
11:55
shut my mouth
11:58
in 1347 a man called roger sweat in bed
12:02
[Laughter]
12:06
was accused of fornication with leticia
12:09
bat
12:11
wow roger sweat in bed sweat in bed
12:13
stand up right
12:14
and shut in mouth was that the third one
12:17
this is though
12:18
it's so fun reading through these old
12:20
records so
12:21
there's actually a document called the
12:23
size of nuisances
12:25
and i really recommend it and it's what
12:26
i wasted all of my research time doing
12:28
for this show
12:29
but it's from 700 years ago and it's
12:31
literally a list
12:33
by from the whole of the uk of all the
12:36
nuisances that are reported by
12:37
neighbours and so i read through it and
12:39
most of them to be fair are about sewage
12:41
leaking into other people's gardens
12:43
so they're a little maybe they were just
12:45
flirting with the next-door neighbor in
12:46
a kind of lobster way
12:49
it didn't sound super sexy in the
12:51
write-up so
12:53
there was a woman who built her own
12:54
personal toilet she didn't like throwing
12:56
her sewage out of the window which a lot
12:58
of people did but
12:59
the solids the solids blocked her gutter
13:01
and the neighbors said they were greatly
13:03
inconvenienced by the stench
13:05
so that was then there was one more just
13:08
in 1377
13:09
thomas and alice young complained their
13:11
neighbor built a forge
13:12
and they were making armor but the
13:14
sledgehammer crashing of them making the
13:16
armor disturbed them
13:18
but worse than that the smoke penetrated
13:20
their house so it smelled really bad
13:22
and also they said the blows of the
13:24
hammer shake the walls of our house so
13:26
much that it spoils our wine
13:28
wow
13:32
that is unpleasant actually tough to
13:33
live with that
13:36
i've got a fact about kind of um
13:38
celebrity
13:39
neighbor disputes because this does
13:41
happen so for example in manhattan in
13:43
the early 1970s
13:45
john cage famous composer he
13:48
lived next door to john lennon and he
13:50
had to go around to complain
13:52
about the noise well can i just say john
13:54
cage is most famous for writing that
13:55
song which is complete silence exactly
13:57
nice i like the idea of john lennon
13:59
going back around and complaining
14:00
anytime he likes
14:02
can you please stop playing four minutes
14:03
and 33 seconds
14:08
i saw another this is just uh very to me
14:11
this is very british
14:13
about noisy neighbors in crystal palace
14:15
in london which is where i live
14:18
this family discovered uh in their uh
14:20
basement
14:21
an unexploded world war ii bomb and they
14:24
found it in the evening
14:26
but they didn't call the police because
14:28
they didn't want to wake the neighbors
14:30
overnight i so patiently guarded the
14:34
bomb
14:35
how loudly do they talk on the phone
14:37
they just didn't want everyone to be
14:38
evacuated
14:39
because they might be blown up by a
14:42
world war
14:42
ii to be honest if the world war ii bomb
14:44
has lasted 60 full years it's probably
14:46
gonna be okay for an extra 12 hours that
14:48
was their logic
14:49
imagine if it had one of those timers
14:51
counting down from 60 years ago
14:54
we've overset this one but one day
14:58
but there is there are often sort of
15:00
surveys done about the
15:01
items that people find most annoying in
15:03
neighbours and they include hot tubs are
15:05
annoying because they
15:06
people are making a lot of noise in hot
15:08
tubs when they're in them barbecues
15:09
automatic solar lights trampolines are a
15:12
very common cause of complaint
15:14
and i like this in the guardian
15:15
newspaper who commented that trampolines
15:18
are complained about because they allow
15:19
the neighbor's children to spy on you on
15:21
an intermittent basis
15:28
very annoying i was just looking at some
15:32
stupid names oh yeah because of this guy
15:34
called william stand upright
15:36
i found a website which had every single
15:39
name that's mentioned in the doomsday
15:40
book
15:41
uh and i spent most of my time reading
15:43
that to be honest um
15:44
in the doomsday book there are four
15:46
people called abba
15:48
12 people called alfred the butler wow
15:52
two called ape one called bono
15:55
one fish two gods and a snot
15:59
and there is one person called anna uh
16:02
who was a man living in puckle church in
16:04
gloucestershire
16:06
no relation
16:09
my past is not supposed to be delved
16:11
into that was in my contract
16:13
there were no dams no undies and there
16:15
was one james who lived in cockfield in
16:18
suffolk
16:19
wow he actually is a relation
16:22
um i looked up a few names too so i
16:25
found that in the last decade
16:26
several dozen people have named their
16:28
daughters unique
16:32
um i also looked up some medieval ones
16:35
as well
16:35
and um just on the origins of uh
16:38
of rude words there's uh in the uh in
16:41
the middle ages the early uses of
16:43
the f word the word meant to hit
16:44
something so there is a man
16:46
in 1290 whose name was simon butter
16:51
he probably worked in derry
16:54
there's actually there's a really cool
16:56
twitter account which is called name
16:58
curator at name curator and it's an
17:00
account run by an australian called ben
17:02
osborne
17:03
and ben osborne just puts uh just his
17:06
favorite
17:06
names that he's found so a couple that
17:08
have gone up on the site there is
17:10
these are all real people dick passwater
17:13
is one guy
17:14
who was a nascar driver in the 50s so
17:16
dick pass water and my favorite
17:18
um a guy called hans hans off
17:25
and he's he's a former submarine
17:27
official
17:28
um what was he called dick passwater
17:30
yeah
17:31
he was a nascar driver because he was
17:32
also another nascar driver at the same
17:34
time
17:34
or maybe the following decade called uh
17:37
dick trickle
17:38
oh yeah oh yeah and he's one of my
17:40
favorite people because
17:41
dick trickle um he was an amazing motor
17:44
racing driver
17:45
but he liked to smoke and they changed
17:47
the rules and said you weren't allowed
17:49
smoke anymore because you had to wear
17:50
helmets and you couldn't smoke while you
17:52
were having
17:52
wearing your helmet and so what he did
17:54
was he drilled a hole in his health
17:57
and he smoked with putting the cigarette
18:00
wow so for qi i always wanted to ask the
18:02
question why did dick trickle have a
18:04
hole in his helmet
18:07
beautiful beautiful
18:11
didn't make it past the sensors did it
18:13
no i never made it past the producer
18:15
do you know what shakespeare means just
18:18
is it like literally shaking a spear
18:20
well according to a book that came out
18:23
in 2014 which is the dictionary of
18:25
surnames
18:26
it's written by a couple of professors
18:28
and one of them said that
18:29
the medieval surname shakespeare is
18:32
probably an obscene name originally for
18:34
a masturbator
18:35
no wow he's a masturbator
18:39
hans off
18:43
i think it was pretty hands-on
18:47
i was on ancestry.com and ancestry.com
18:50
has been listing surnames that have gone
18:52
extinct so obviously the ones that
18:53
like stand upright uh i believe will
18:56
have been extinct
18:57
so ones that have recently gone extinct
18:58
include chips
19:00
temples rummage southwark
19:04
um so those they've they've seen that
19:06
there are virtually no new members
19:08
um who are being born with the surname
19:10
and on the endangered list and what
19:11
counts as an endangered
19:13
surname is so rare that less than 50
19:15
people in england and wales have them so
19:17
this is for
19:18
england and wales um included on the
19:20
list is
19:21
mirren as in helen mirren nike
19:24
as a bill nye and bonneville as in
19:27
hugh bonneville all three leading actors
19:29
endangered
19:30
species basically yeah it's all of our
19:33
solemn duty tonight
19:35
if we can to mate with helen mirren
19:38
bill nye or hugh bonneville
19:41
depending on your preferences
19:46
okay it is time for fact number three
19:50
and that is my fact my fact this week is
19:53
that the man who invented
19:55
the australian labradoodle deeply
19:58
deeply regrets it
20:03
he is so sorry that he did that
20:06
to all of us uh this is a guy called
20:10
wally conran uh wally conran who's now
20:13
approaching his 90s
20:14
um he was the first person in a
20:17
mass sense and is credited with creating
20:20
the trend
20:20
uh which started in the 80s of the cross
20:23
between the
20:24
labrador and a poodle and what he what
20:27
he hates is
20:27
it kind of took off and it became a
20:29
celebrity dog and
20:31
jennifer aniston has one and crown
20:33
princes around the world have them and
20:35
it became such a fashionable dog but
20:37
to get the specific dog there's a lot of
20:40
breathing that needs to happen
20:41
and he thinks he's created the
20:43
frankenstein uh that has
20:45
set off all these people experimenting
20:47
with different breeds and so on for
20:49
designer dog
20:50
so yeah he's he's very sorry he asked me
20:52
to say he's very sorry
20:54
i thought the reason that he one of the
20:56
reasons that he was sorry was because
20:58
the whole reason the labradoodle came to
20:59
be was because he was asked to
21:03
create a guide dog for a woman whose
21:05
husband had a dog allergy
21:07
and so by merging those two they're
21:09
anti-allergenic
21:10
they're let's say you're not allergic to
21:12
them i thought one of the reasons that
21:14
he
21:15
didn't like the labradoodle is that it's
21:17
advertised as a hypoallergenic dog
21:19
and yet a lot of people now breed them
21:21
without actually testing whether or not
21:23
they are
21:24
so i think quite a small percentage of
21:25
them now are non-allergenic
21:28
but well he is definitely against all of
21:30
this kind of cross-breeding
21:31
i'm pretty sure yeah he said um i just
21:34
heard about someone who wants to cross a
21:35
poodle with a rottweiler
21:37
uh but that is a thing that's cool yeah
21:39
it's called a rottle
21:40
also called a roti poo a rotty doodle or
21:43
a rottweiler poo
21:45
yeah oh but a rottweiler poo sounds like
21:47
something that's a yeah yeah yeah
21:50
yeah you can get you can get a cockapoo
21:52
that's a cross between a cocker spaniel
21:54
and a poodle
21:55
a shipoo which is a shih tzu and a
21:56
poodle yeah a bish poo
21:58
which is a bichon frise and a poodle um
22:01
a peekapoo
22:01
which is a pekingese and a poop stop it
22:05
i mean it does sound like they do it
22:06
just for the names doesn't it yeah yeah
22:08
there's a
22:08
schnauzer scotty cross called a schnotty
22:12
yeah it's one of the fun cross which is
22:14
a
22:15
cross between a shih tzu and jack
22:16
russell which has
22:18
two names but one of them is the jack
22:20
22:22
have you guys there are some other dogs
22:24
that went um extinct or
22:26
dogs we don't have anymore yeah so have
22:27
you heard of the salish wool dog
22:29
no the wall dog was a dog you could
22:31
shear and then you would wear their coat
22:33
as your code
22:35
it was a dog that was big and fluffy
22:36
enough that you could keep on shearing
22:38
it
22:38
could you not do that with any dog no um
22:42
i don't know you could have a go
22:42
couldn't you yeah might as well trap
22:47
but you know like why poodles have those
22:49
stupid um
22:50
cuts of hair that they have well it's
22:52
proper there's a proper reason behind
22:54
it and that is because they're
22:55
originally to collect stuff from water
22:57
uh and if they had this kind of really
22:59
bushy hair and they would just get wet
23:01
and they'd get heavy
23:03
so but like is it hunting yes it was
23:06
collecting quarry so you've been hunting
23:09
and then the water says duck it's in the
23:10
water
23:11
and then the poodle would go in and get
23:13
it and the idea was
23:14
so they wanted to have it to have as
23:16
little hair as possible but it still
23:18
needed hair to keep its um
23:19
internal organs warm so that's why it
23:21
kept it round there
23:22
it still needed it to keep the joints
23:25
warm to stop
23:26
arthritis so it still needed it round
23:27
there and the top knot was to keep the
23:29
long hair out of its eyes when it was
23:30
swimming
23:32
wow it's a water dog so the word poodle
23:36
comes from the old german poodle isn't
23:38
it for puddle yeah
23:39
because it was best at going into water
23:42
and uh getting
23:43
ducks out of it but do you know the best
23:44
thing about a poodle these days when
23:46
they're often shown in dog shows
23:49
is the thing that you're striving for is
23:51
for them to be square
23:53
so i didn't squareness is the thing you
23:56
strive for most above all things
23:58
so um the westminster kennel show allows
24:01
two styles of poodle it's not too many
24:03
they have continental and english like
24:04
breakfasts and
24:07
and the english one is a much greasier
24:09
dog
24:11
yeah but who's going to pay that much
24:13
for a continental yeah true the
24:14
continental is observing
24:16
it's so overpriced but this the essa
24:19
there are two styles of poodles that are
24:20
allowed at these dog competitions and
24:22
they're judged on squareness and they're
24:24
properly square the area from their
24:25
breast to their bottom has to be the
24:27
same as the area from their shoulder to
24:29
the ground and it's very precise so
24:32
in shows where poodles are being shown
24:34
they have to be really groomed very well
24:37
and groomers work with only the finest
24:39
scissors
24:40
apparently and the best poodle scissors
24:42
are made in japan
24:44
and they cost more than six hundred
24:46
dollars done
24:47
it sounds like your samurai scissors
24:49
yeah ah
24:51
my yeah my dad
24:54
has he's a hairdresser and so is my mom
24:57
and um
24:58
he bought when he was young a pair of
25:00
sisters
25:01
uh scissors that were um forged in the
25:03
fires
25:08
they are samurai scissors they were made
25:10
by samurai
25:11
and you said that on the show and we
25:13
really did not believe you yeah
25:15
and then i showed you the article where
25:16
he was in the newspaper it's it's true i
25:18
mean it's still him going samurai says
25:20
but
25:21
they're they're so sharp because they're
25:23
made by the samurai that
25:25
when you're a hairdresser and you have
25:26
your scissors you need to get them
25:27
sharpened every two or three years you
25:29
go and do it my dad takes him every two
25:30
three years and they say to him
25:32
there is nothing we can do for you they
25:34
are as sharp as the day you bought them
25:37
samurais wow um i've got a fact about uh
25:42
dog mentality assessments if anyone's up
25:45
for that
25:46
yes please it's sorry dog mentality
25:48
assessments in sweden oh no no
25:52
so there's a swedish association which
25:54
has to assess how um
25:56
how relaxed and calm a dog is and it
25:58
uses this thing called the dog mentality
25:59
assessment
26:00
and what it is is basically a haunted
26:01
house for dogs so
26:03
they make a dog walk along a long path
26:05
in some woods and then
26:07
as it as it walks along they suddenly
26:09
they play a gunshot
26:10
sound they play the sound of a metal
26:12
chain being creepily dragged along
26:14
and then suddenly a ghost appears what
26:18
is it a dog ghost it's a human ghost
26:20
there's a person coming in a sheet
26:22
with a plastic bucket on their head
26:25
and they test how calm or aggressive the
26:28
dog is why so are they doing this
26:30
because it's like a seeing dog like
26:32
i think they're doing this because they
26:33
have time on their hands like if it was
26:36
um
26:36
like a blind person i think it might be
26:38
to assess in that kind of in working
26:40
dogs the aggressiveness
26:41
yeah right wow that's exciting
26:44
um i have a couple of things on so the
26:46
main headline fact is
26:48
uh the inventor regretting his invention
26:51
i found a few
26:52
other people who've regretted their
26:54
inventions uh so
26:56
tim berners-lee uh inventor of the world
26:58
wide web
26:59
he really regrets you know originally
27:01
when we all had to put in a web address
27:03
http
27:04
and so on he regrets the two forward
27:06
slashes
27:07
that you do because that's the best bit
27:10
this well
27:11
i agree james i had great fun i wish
27:13
there were more
27:14
but i sometimes put an extra one in just
27:18
for fun
27:18
exactly hours of fun
27:21
and so the two forward slashes on it
27:25
which is completely useless didn't need
27:27
to be there he just put them in
27:29
because like james and i love's a good
27:30
forward slash and
27:33
and uh they had no purpose at all
27:36
and he regrets that he's publicly spoken
27:38
and said i i'm
27:39
very sorry i didn't mean to do that okay
27:42
yeah i think people thought they did
27:43
coders at the time
27:45
i mean they did serve purpose in certain
27:47
code didn't they
27:48
and so he assumed they were useful but
27:51
then
27:51
it turned out later that they weren't
27:53
and he said the countless hours of
27:56
human labor and time spent typing those
27:58
two keystrokes
27:59
oh what would we have done with the time
28:01
i could have watched the wire
28:03
okay yeah i'll never watch the wire
28:04
because of tim burnsley
28:08
hey we need to move on to our final fact
28:10
soon uh you guys got anything before we
28:12
do
28:13
the queen is very responsible for dog
28:15
crossbreeds
28:16
is she our queen and yours guys
28:20
don't forget hers was one of the first
28:22
crossbreeds as the bbc put it to
28:24
infiltrate the kennel club
28:27
because she bred dachshunds with corgis
28:29
and she insisted on her
28:31
doggy being in the portrait that she had
28:34
done with her
28:35
uh in the 1970s in 1975 and
28:38
uh quite sweetly the secretary of the
28:39
kennel club at the time that judges all
28:41
of these things
28:42
said that look the dachshund was evolved
28:45
to chase badgers down holes and corbys
28:47
were evolved to round up cattle
28:49
so if anyone loses a herd of cattle down
28:51
a batter hole these are just the dogs to
28:53
get them okay it is
28:58
time for our final fact of the show and
29:01
that is
29:02
andy my fact has a content warning this
29:05
bit's rude
29:06
okay cool unlike that lobster bit we did
29:08
that oh yeah
29:10
um so my fact is that the word
29:12
shit-faced
29:14
originally meant having a very small
29:16
face
29:20
so if you said i was absolutely
29:22
shit-faced last night it just means all
29:24
your features are bunched up right in
29:25
the middle
29:26
it's because it comes from the word chit
29:29
yeah you'd see you hear that you said it
29:30
was very old fashioned saying here it
29:31
said sometimes a mere chit of a letter
29:33
or like a chitty is a little receipt or
29:35
something exactly yeah it just means
29:36
like a small thing so the first uh usage
29:39
that i've been able to find
29:40
is 1622 where there's a child described
29:43
as a peaking
29:44
chit-faced page
29:47
it just means small face i think we
29:50
should bring it back don't you
29:52
yes i do there are loads of words for
29:54
being drunk
29:55
but there are very few for having a
29:56
small face
29:59
imagine if the band the small faces had
30:01
originally called themselves the ship
30:02
faces
30:05
is this so this is a weird thing but
30:07
last night andy said to all of us who do
30:10
you think has the smallest face of all
30:11
of us for and i forgot we were doing
30:13
this for
30:14
is that why is that it's not it's not
30:15
consciously why i asked
30:17
because you were called pinhead at
30:18
school weren't you yeah
30:22
but as i pointed out pins famously have
30:24
very large
30:25
heads relative to their body
30:28
so let me tell you the joke was on those
30:29
guys
30:34
nice word face
30:39
um i was looking up other um uh false
30:42
false words basically so there's
30:44
the word
30:44
shittle which means inconstant
30:47
so like a shuttle you know uh it means
30:50
back and forwards the word shuttle
30:51
so you used to play badminton with a
30:53
shittle no way
30:55
yeah really way um shite poke
30:59
shite poke yes sorry i just don't like
31:01
you
31:06
and the reason was because people
31:08
thought that herons defecated when
31:09
taking flight
31:11
which they do sometimes but not all the
31:13
time yeah there was a guy in
31:15
the 19th century who wrote the
31:17
dictionary of west somerset in 1875
31:20
and he said that the um the 29th of may
31:23
is sack day
31:26
and he writes this the writer of the
31:27
dictionary says in the north west of
31:29
somerset and north devon it is common to
31:30
hear boys call out on that day
31:32
sack sack but i have been
31:34
unable to discover the origin
31:38
it feels to me like he's not heard them
31:41
saying it to him on the other day yes
31:42
[Laughter]
31:44
there's a three-volume dictionary of
31:46
slang called jonathan green's
31:48
jonathan green is the guy who wrote it
31:50
he's a genius but i looked up peculiarly
31:52
australian
31:53
slang words so i don't know how
31:55
familiar
31:56
these might be everyone knows them but
31:58
so for example
31:59
i'm so hungry i could eat a
32:01
sandwich only i don't like bread
32:06
there's to take the with the sugar
32:07
which is to accept that one must have
32:09
both bad and good experiences in life
32:11
and my favorite is you don't know
32:13
whether you want a or a haircut
32:17
which is you're stupid is that that's
32:20
what that means
32:23
i think it's possible to want both of
32:24
those
32:27
the word the word though has a long
32:30
history doesn't it in a long
32:31
etymological history so
32:33
it comes from scay which meant to cut
32:36
and so it's the same origin as words
32:39
like science
32:40
and schedule and shield and it was
32:43
spelled shite
32:43
until the 1700s but they used to kind of
32:46
broaden their
32:48
ship based vocabulary so in old english
32:51
skitay
32:52
was diarrhoea and beschitan was one word
32:55
that meant to cover
32:56
with excrement and also in 18 in the
32:58
18th century according to the partridge
33:01
dictionary of slang to through your
33:03
teeth
33:04
was to vomit which does make a lot of
33:06
sense and
33:07
the the example that's given in this
33:09
dictionary is
33:10
eg hockey friend have you got a padlock
33:14
on your ass that you shiped through your
33:16
teeth
33:18
wow wow i have some swear words which
33:22
are not at all rude
33:23
but they are awesome these are
33:24
incredibly rude in the languages that
33:26
they are
33:26
in okay so okay so for example so we're
33:29
gonna alienate not just the
33:30
english-speaking world of this podcast
33:32
yeah the swedish the romanians and the
33:35
japanese should have better buckle up
33:36
when they're listening to this
33:38
so in sweden you can say
33:42
go and put an old blanket over yourself
33:44
which is really rude to them
33:46
in sweden yeah that's what that guy who
33:48
was pretending to be a ghost was doing
33:50
yes
33:52
so in japan you can say tofu tofu no
33:55
kadoni atama
33:56
butsukete or hit your head on a corner
33:59
of tofu
34:00
and die
34:01
[Laughter]
34:05
um in uh in romanian there's a phrase
34:08
which means
34:09
i can't believe this is true it means i
34:11
would dry my dirty pants on your mum's
34:13
crucifix
34:18
that one's quite rude in english as well
34:22
can i just in romanian i read an article
34:25
on vice which had a romanian person
34:28
writing in
34:28
about swearing in romania and they said
34:31
swearing culture in romania is built on
34:33
oral
34:34
sex mothers and christ
34:37
it's very much the trifecta of things
34:39
not to say in romania
34:42

[Applause]
00:15
thing as a hello
00:16
a weekly podcast this week coming to you
00:18
live
00:19
from liverpool
00:24
my name is dan schreiber and i am
00:26
sitting here with anna chazinski andrew
00:29
hunter murray and
00:30
james harkin and once again we have
00:32
gathered around the microphones with our
00:33
four
00:34
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:36
and in no particular order
00:37
here we go starting with you andy
00:40
my fact is that the ancient greeks wiped
00:43
their bottoms
00:44
with pebbles
00:45
[Music]
00:47
well i heard of the flintstones
00:49
[Laughter]
00:52
how would that even work so
00:56
this is true they had they had pebbles
00:58
which they used they're things called
00:59
passoi and we keep discovering them in
01:00
archaeological digs
01:02
and we know that these were used because
01:05
they're covered in
01:08
yeah kind of yeah so there was um
01:10
fish-borne roman palace which is a roman
01:12
site in england had uh bits of pottery
01:14
which had partly mineralized excrement
01:17
on them and until they discovered the
01:18
excrement they thought they were board
01:19
game
01:20
counters but they weren't but i think
01:22
the word pessim
01:23
means both these pebbles and also board
01:26
game counters
01:27
yes so it's the same word for both it's
01:29
like if we have the same word for toilet
01:30
paper and
01:31
monopoly piece i like the idea
01:35
that presumably on the dig they pick it
01:37
up and they go i think this is one of
01:38
those board game counters and they get a
01:40
bit closer and they're suddenly like
01:41
oh no it's not it's another pet toy
01:45
so uh you said that was a fishbond roman
01:47
palace yes yeah so uh dr rob simmons
01:49
who's the curator of the fishbond roman
01:51
palace
01:52
uh he found out about this uh and he
01:54
said he thought it was hilarious
01:56
and it really appealed to him that for
01:58
50 years they've been saying these
01:59
things were board game tokens
02:01
in their museum and now they have to
02:03
re-label them
02:05
it's great and there was there was
02:07
guidance for the ancient greeks about
02:09
how you should use them so
02:11
there was a bit of advice which said you
02:12
should use no more than three pebbles
02:14
and anything more than that is actually
02:16
a bit extravagant and you don't need it
02:18
how big are the pebbles they must be
02:20
like quite big i reckon uh they're not
02:22
huge they're smaller than
02:23
my hand i'd say but they're bigger than
02:25
a penny okay
02:26
okay do we know if they were in any way
02:29
effective as in
02:31
are we doing it wrong now would they
02:32
laugh about paper leaves a pebble mate
02:35
is it a better option i i don't think
02:37
it's a better option i think that can be
02:39
abrasive obviously you'll pick smooth
02:40
pebbles if you can
02:42
so do you think it was like um you know
02:44
when you go skimming stones on a beach
02:46
and you spent ages selecting the right
02:48
ones
02:53
it feels to me like the kind of pebble
02:55
that would be good for skimming would
02:57
also be good for scraping
02:58
agreed yeah yeah well actually they
03:02
could be a bit dangerous
03:03
um some people who found out about this
03:05
have written that long-term use
03:07
could have resulted in local irritation
03:10
skin or mucosal damage
03:12
or complications of external hemorrhoids
03:15
so really it's not something you want to
03:17
be doing it's not we're not suggesting
03:19
it
03:19
no but the really interesting thing was
03:21
some of these um
03:23
there is there is a theory that some
03:25
academics have that not only did they
03:27
wipe the bottoms with pebbles they wiped
03:28
the bottoms with
03:29
pebbles that had their enemies names
03:31
written on them
03:32
ah and so that's the austro-cost or the
03:35
ostrich
03:35
right um so was this a thing in ancient
03:38
greece where you would write the name of
03:40
a
03:40
politician that you didn't like
03:41
basically on a pebble and then kind of
03:43
throw it out
03:44
yeah every year there was a meeting and
03:46
if there were enough votes cast i think
03:48
it was if there were more than 6 000
03:50
votes cast
03:51
with the names written on them and
03:52
whoever got the most votes out of those
03:54
6 000 would be cast out from society
03:56
and it was to guard against tyrants so
03:59
it was a very good way of saying oh
04:00
there's an up-and-coming politician
04:02
jacob rees-mogg he's looking a bit you
04:03
know likely everyone writes his name on
04:06
a bit of pottery
04:07
wipes it on their butt problem solved
04:10
um but they also they did this really
04:12
cool thing in battle in ancient greece
04:14
where they had bullets uh which they
04:16
would sort of catapult at the enemy
04:18
but they would write insults on the
04:20
bullets that they threw at people
04:22
literally adding insult to injury and
04:26
they so we found lots of examples of
04:28
these bullets which are kind of like big
04:30
rocks and they'll say things like kind
04:31
of ouch
04:32
or the equivalent in in ancient greek or
04:34
one of them says
04:35
for pompey's backside and another one
04:38
says that
04:39
would be a toilet paper thing so that no
04:42
one else uses it
04:43
you're absolutely right one of them said
04:45
this is a hard nut to crack
04:47
and one of them said fruit for dessert i
04:50
don't know what they're probably really
04:51
funny at the time
04:52
yeah no this is i'm sure the person shot
04:56
with
04:56
oh that's hilarious
04:59
and this is just an aside but um you
05:02
know
05:02
the little stone that you throw on a
05:04
slingshot they did a study on that i
05:05
think last year of the year before
05:07
and they found that being hit by one of
05:08
those was like being hit by a bullet
05:10
from a magnum
05:11
whoa like if you could get the proper
05:13
throw like you could kill people
05:15
so for david and goliath actually david
05:17
was the favorite in that fight
05:19
yeah i i read that in a malcolm gladwell
05:21
book it was the idea that
05:23
you would have thought david was a
05:26
useless person to send out but actually
05:27
the best people
05:28
in battle back then had precision shots
05:31
would mean that you could take an army
05:32
down from a distance
05:33
with one single blow and so you take an
05:35
army down from a distance with one
05:38
single just listen to yourself
05:41
okay a single person like a giant yeah i
05:44
mean more importantly dennis the menace
05:46
was much more of a menace than we've
05:47
been led to believe
05:50
um i really like that um in ancient
05:53
china so actually
05:54
around the 1300s there were emperors who
05:57
started using toilet paper it's one of
05:58
the first examples of uh
06:00
toilet paper being used and the sheets
06:03
that they used to
06:04
order each sheet would measure two feet
06:06
by three feet
06:08
that would be their uh yeah and we think
06:11
they had enormous houses or
06:12
well i just know just a lot of
06:16
a lot of fun maybe i don't know you've
06:18
got to assume they ripped that up
06:22
yeah they went through a lot didn't they
06:23
i in the 1390s they went through like
06:25
720 000 sheets of toilet paper
06:28
every year that was just in the royal
06:30
palace in the imperial court
06:31
so well we and we didn't pick up on
06:33
toilet paper until
06:35
really recently in sort of western
06:37
europe yeah not as far
06:39
i'll tell you what two weeks ago the
06:42
game changed completely for the four of
06:43
us
06:46
a lot less time picking up those pebbles
06:48
from the beach
06:50
this is true it was in the 1800s it was
06:54
a guy called
06:55
thomas gayetti who was an american guy
06:57
who in
06:58
i think the 1860s or 1857
07:01
he came up with a manila hemp kind of
07:03
thing that was
07:04
infused with scents and stuff and it was
07:07
able to wipe bottoms and he called it
07:09
therapeutic paper
07:10
and actually the idea was that it
07:11
stopped piles and hemorrhoids and stuff
07:14
and it did not catch on for years so it
07:15
didn't catch on until 1890
07:18
and at that point because wiping your
07:20
bottom in victorian times was quite an
07:21
embarrassing thing to talk about or even
07:23
admit that you'd ever done
07:25
um the people who finally popularized
07:27
toilet roll
07:28
were these guys clarence and ervin scott
07:31
who turned it into an actual role they
07:33
were the people who invented the
07:35
sort of uh cylindrical role and they
07:37
were so ashamed of inventing that in
07:39
1890 that they never admitted it until
07:40
1902.
07:42
once even though yeah surely the money
07:45
will be piling up somewhere and he's
07:46
like
07:47
are you sure you didn't invent this so
07:48
we have a lot of money to give to
07:50
whoever
07:50
invented that nothing to do with me man
07:55
shame is a powerful horse
07:58
um i've read about a chess grand master
08:00
in 2015 this is slightly off topic
08:02
who was caught cheating due to using
08:05
toilet paper
08:06
okay you cheated with toilet paper what
08:08
do you think um
08:09
oh so how did they do it yeah um well
08:12
they
08:12
took they took the toilet paper which is
08:14
white yeah and put it on the black
08:16
squares
08:18
uh and so no one knew how to move their
08:20
bishops wow
08:21
that is f that's this is going to be
08:23
such a letdown that is
08:24
much better than what i have been good
08:27
oh really good
08:28
is it that no it's it's it's more using
08:32
a toilet than using toilet paper but the
08:34
officials got suspicious because he was
08:35
playing the match and his opponent
08:37
noticed he kept going to the loo
08:39
pretty much every turn and he was
08:40
staying in there for a very long time
08:42
um for 10 minutes or more and they
08:44
thought what's going on here so
08:45
when he was out they went into the
08:47
cubicle and they discovered a smartphone
08:49
wrapped up in toilet paper and buried in
08:51
a bin
08:52
and he denied it was his but that's more
08:54
using the smartphone than the toilet
08:56
paper isn't it it's a joint effort
08:58
and it's a teamwork um but yeah
09:01
he denied it was his but the phone was
09:02
logged into his facebook page and there
09:04
was a chess program on it showing
09:05
exactly his position in the match
09:08
a team from kazakhstan has invented
09:10
reusable toilet paper
09:13
oh yeah it's it's i was about to say
09:15
it's divided in the room it does not
09:16
divide out of the room
09:17
we all agree what we think about
09:18
reusable toilet paper dividing the room
09:20
between me and everyone
09:21
else so yeah you just use it and you put
09:26
it in the washing machine
09:27
and it comes out you can use it again
09:28
you wouldn't want to put it in with a
09:29
load of other stuff though would you
09:30
not with your whites now
09:37
okay it is time for fact number two and
09:39
that is
09:40
james my fact this week is that in 1860
09:44
there was a woman in paris who made a
09:46
living by blowing the noses of war
09:48
veterans who had lost their
09:50
arms in battle wow someone employed to
09:54
blow the noses of people
09:55
yeah so they just had a war in in france
09:58
napoleon iii had just come to power
10:00
and there are a lot of invalids in paris
10:02
and so it was a really useful thing for
10:04
people for this lady to do
10:06
how would she know that someone would
10:07
have a runny nose would you
10:09
know that you kind of had a cold coming
10:10
on
10:14
so hank she used a hanky presumably she
10:18
um so it only struck me reading about
10:21
this yesterday the
10:22
we just accept the handkerchiefs are
10:23
square and they have not always been
10:26
square and they used to come in all
10:28
shapes and sizes it was a very exciting
10:30
time
10:31
and apparently and like it really was
10:36
god if i could go back in time it would
10:38
be to the year where handkerchiefs were
10:40
different shapes
10:42
and out of shapes yeah so like oval or
10:46
circular
10:46
or um you know trapezium parallelograms
10:50
um but apparently the reason that they
10:52
are now square
10:54
is that marie antoinette told her
10:56
husband
10:57
louis xvi that she was tired of this
10:59
endless variety in handkerchiefs
11:01
and so immediately louis issued a decree
11:04
saying that all handkerchiefs had to be
11:06
equal
11:07
in width and height throughout the
11:08
kingdom and that's hence
11:10
sort of the squareness generally you
11:17
do you know that you used to be able to
11:19
get satirical handkerchiefs
11:21
no lots of people had had hankies which
11:23
commemorated current events
11:25
so if there had been a battle recently
11:26
or a royal death or something or a
11:29
military victory or an unusual happening
11:32
immediately printers and hanky-makers
11:34
would rush out a load of commemorative
11:36
hankies
11:36
and you'd be able to say oh have you
11:38
seen my cool new hanky about that weird
11:40
cow that was found or whatever um
11:43
the news was very slow wasn't it in the
11:45
early 19th century
11:46
but but the the the reason that they
11:48
were popular then is because
11:50
you would you would carry around your
11:51
hanky supposedly and it only migrated to
11:54
the top pocket
11:55
when uh that went out of fashion and
11:56
people started having just plain
11:57
handkerchiefs there was no need to show
11:59
it off anymore because you see like
12:00
george and
12:01
men kind of walking around with the
12:02
hankies like bob brummell and stuff
12:04
don't you yeah yeah
12:05
well i think um so handkerchiefs did
12:08
used to be sort of 15 16th 17th
12:10
centuries
12:11
um sort of beige or white
12:14
or cream and they'd have lots of
12:15
embroidery around the edge and then
12:17
snuff
12:17
came in because we discovered the
12:19
americas and we brought back some
12:20
tobacco
12:21
and snuff i don't know if you guys ever
12:22
taken snuff but when you do take it
12:24
your snot is brown and so it became kind
12:28
of
12:28
unseemly to blow your nose and have
12:30
these weird brown stains all over your
12:32
handkerchief
12:33
and at that point they started being in
12:35
dark colors
12:36
and that's when we first got you know
12:38
handkerchiefs being dyed with lots of
12:39
patterns on to cover up
12:41
the weird brown kind of poo stain that
12:43
was a snuff blow
12:45
i just found out that there are these
12:46
massive mucus balls floating around in
12:48
the ocean which we didn't know about
12:50
until now
12:50
wow very cool they're called sinkers and
12:53
there are these tadpole-like animals
12:55
called giant levations they make them
12:57
they blow them up to catch prey and then
12:59
after a while they throw them away like
13:00
a spider getting rid of its web
13:02
and they just float through the ocean
13:04
down and that means that there's enough
13:06
food on the sea floor to support life
13:09
because of these things they
13:10
double the amount of food available so
13:13
doubled it they double it but it's all
13:14
it's not is it no it's not but as it
13:17
moves down it catches other bits of prey
13:19
it catches other bits of food so it's
13:21
this huge
13:21
food net floating down through the ocean
13:23
it lands you can support life but
13:25
they're very hard to spot in the wild
13:27
because they're
13:28
they're quite delicate i was reading
13:30
about those um also there's a clam in
13:32
the ocean
13:33
that when it's being attacked by
13:34
predators shoots toxic snot
13:37
out of it in order to get it away it's
13:39
really cool you should check out photos
13:40
and videos of it it's called the disco
13:42
clam
13:43
and if you see it it looks like a
13:46
massive rave this clan it's just like
13:49
they're
13:49
just moving and all these amazing um
13:51
fluorescent lights are coming off like
13:53
you've got glow sticks on it
13:55
we're gonna have to move on in a sec
13:56
anything before we do you were saying
13:58
about louis xv
13:59
i read one website and i can't really
14:01
work out if this is true
14:03
apparently he prohibited anyone from
14:05
carrying a handkerchief that was larger
14:06
than his
14:09
so he had to have the biggest
14:10
handkerchief of all and if he had a
14:12
small one
14:13
everyone had to have a small one it's a
14:15
good thing no one told him about the
14:16
massive chinese toilet paper otherwise
14:18
he would
14:18
insist on having six foot by nine foot
14:20
squares of lu roll
14:22
okay it is time for fact number three
14:25
and that
14:26
is anna my fact this week is that when
14:29
avocados were first sold in the uk
14:31
they came with a leaflet explaining what
14:33
they were and how to eat them
14:37
this is it was the 1960s and they were
14:41
just getting a bit popular and this is
14:42
an m
14:43
s and m s uh i read this
14:46
sort of big report about how m s's sales
14:48
policy have worked over the years and
14:50
they said in 1968
14:52
they first of all got avocados who are
14:53
very excited and they put them up as the
14:55
avocado pair
14:56
which is what they were called at the
14:58
time and they got complaints from people
15:00
immediately
15:01
who had stewed them and served them with
15:03
custard as you would a pear
15:06
and said well this is disgusting why are
15:08
you selling this to me
15:09
and so the store was given each eminent
15:12
store was issued with lots of leaflets
15:14
to give free with avocados explaining
15:16
that they were a salad item
15:17
and they were not a dessert and how to
15:19
prepare them and how to eat them
15:21
yeah and that's why we don't call them
15:22
avocado pears anymore they weren't
15:23
called avocados
15:24
until 1915. this is so weird they were
15:27
called ajuakate
15:28
and in 1915 a group of farmers in
15:31
california they just met
15:32
up and they agreed what they would call
15:34
it from now on because it wasn't selling
15:36
very well
15:36
so they just they had a they all found
15:38
it and they said it's too hard for
15:40
americans to pronounce
15:41
and also there's a testicle connotation
15:44
because
15:44
um in the original language the word
15:48
meant
15:48
testicle so they just decided the aztecs
15:51
wasn't it who it came from yeah
15:55
and so the farmers just renamed it
15:56
avocado they they decided the plural
15:58
avocados
15:59
pretty easy job i imagine um but they
16:01
specifically said it wasn't with an e
16:03
didn't they
16:03
yes they did they said avocados instead
16:06
of avocado does
16:07
and then and they just wrote to
16:10
dictionary publishers saying we have
16:12
changed the name of one of your words
16:14
this is what it's going to be like
16:16
that's really
16:17
so good do you know who we have to thank
16:20
for avocados the fact that we have
16:22
them um waitrose
16:26
close ancient giant sloths
16:30
yeah it's true basically what it is is
16:33
that ancient giant sloths now extinct
16:35
they were the only animals big enough
16:37
that were able to swallow an avocado
16:39
because of the size of the nut inside
16:41
and what they used to do was they would
16:43
swallow it whole and
16:45
the brilliant bit about that is because
16:46
they traveled a lot
16:48
what they were doing is when they pooed
16:49
it out and the nut came out on the other
16:51
side they were planting avocado trees
16:53
out in places that they'd never existed
16:55
before and this according to the
16:56
american museum of natural history was a
16:58
very big deal because
17:00
if an avocado just fell and rotted
17:01
underneath a tree it would be competing
17:03
for light and growth of the existing
17:05
tree
17:05
and may never have dispersed itself so
17:08
because of the
17:08
the pooing um ancient giant sloths we
17:11
now have them in abundance
17:13
um according to this thing i was reading
17:15
the avocados don't know that giant
17:17
sloths have gone extinct
17:19
what i don't think they even know
17:21
they're avocados well
17:23
that's a fair argument what do you mean
17:25
this is
17:26
an author connie barlow was writing
17:28
about these and she says that as far as
17:29
avocados are concerned it's all going
17:31
very well according to plan
17:32
so do they think that avocado farmers
17:34
are giant sloths
17:36
basically yeah because the i think the
17:38
range must have shrunk quite a lot
17:39
because the
17:40
sloths went extinct 13 000 years ago and
17:42
avocados
17:44
humans only invented agriculture about
17:45
10 000 years ago yeah
17:47
so there was a spell where it was
17:48
looking pretty dodgy for the avocado
17:50
yeah and then thanks to human farmers
17:51
picking up the slack
17:53
and pretending they must know they're
17:54
not being eaten and poodle
17:56
as you say i don't think they know
17:58
they're avocados like maybe do the
18:00
farmers dress up as giant sloths
18:03
you know having like pandering closures
18:04
yeah humans dressed as pandas to trick
18:06
them do you know the latin name is these
18:07
giant sloths is no megatherium
18:09
which literally means big animal is the
18:12
worst
18:15
so of course um avocado toast is a thing
18:18
yes among millennials and it's the
18:20
reason that they can't afford houses
18:24
according to some people but the bbc
18:26
looks into this
18:27
and they found that in order to afford a
18:29
deposit on a house in london
18:31
you would have to give up and not eat 24
18:34
499 avocado toasts
18:38
which means to get a deposit for a flat
18:40
in london you only have to give up
18:41
avocado
18:42
toast for 67 years
18:45
wait eating how many a day i think it's
18:47
one more week
18:49
oh oh well i think i could make that
18:51
money in a much shorter than 67 years
18:53
i'm eating a lot of avocado okay
18:56
sacrifice that
18:57
but yeah it has become so popular over
18:59
the last few years
19:00
and then there was a shortage of
19:03
avocados so the way you farm them is
19:04
quite difficult they sort of have on
19:06
years and off years alternating
19:08
and so it's become a crime wave in
19:10
australia and new zealand they've had a
19:12
spate of avocado thefts
19:14
and this is now a serious problem in new
19:16
zealand and they get stolen
19:18
in the middle of the night lots of these
19:19
have been reported it's been a real
19:21
spike
19:21
uh they people come in the middle of the
19:23
night to avocado farms
19:25
and they either rake them from a tree
19:28
using big
19:28
big long devices or they collect them in
19:30
blankets or sleeping bags
19:32
on the ground and then they drag them
19:34
away and they were starting to set up
19:36
kind of little avocado stools on
19:38
roadsides in new zealand and then the
19:39
police cracked down
19:41
in 2017 and so now they've gone to
19:43
facebook
19:44
so as if facebook hadn't done enough
19:46
wrong over the last year
19:48
they're also now selling black market
19:50
avocados no
19:52
we should say that mark zuckerberg is
19:53
not personally selling black market
19:56
i'll put it past him there was a guy
19:59
there were three guys in california who
20:01
were charged with grand theft avocado
20:03
for um there were that was the sheriff
20:05
county what they said the county office
20:07
they were they still three hundred
20:08
thousand dollars worth
20:09
it is hard though i would think to
20:11
smuggle an avocado
20:12
i i can see why drugs are so popular um
20:15
because
20:16
that is important that's not the only
20:17
reason they're popular
20:19
but it's in the it's very small it's an
20:20
easy thing to you know if you have a
20:22
roadside avocado still
20:23
it's quite hard to imagine to pack that
20:24
up if you see a police car approaching
20:26
yeah although it's easier if someone
20:28
comes by and inspects your wares to say
20:30
yes this is perfectly legal
20:33
that's why my drugstore went out of
20:34
business
20:39
largest avocado ever found was by
20:43
pamela wang from hawaii
20:48
this pamela is not a funny name i know
20:51
uh it was the size of a chihuahua wow
20:55
the size of a small dog yeah
20:58
not the state in mexico
21:03
but it's weird because there's some some
21:04
you know we've covered giant pumpkins
21:06
before and giant pumpkins get to the
21:07
size of uh
21:08
you know bigger than a big dog if i
21:10
could sorry i don't want to blind anyone
21:12
with science
21:13
but although it's not a contest between
21:15
avocados and pumpkins oversized i think
21:17
everyone understands that pumpkins are
21:18
bigger than avocados
21:20
do you guys know about avocado proposals
21:23
no no
21:24
it's um it's a thing that the media
21:26
journalists have decided as a thing
21:28
and they found some people who've done
21:29
them and what they are is instead of
21:30
proposing to the person you want to
21:32
marry
21:32
and opening a box with a ring in it you
21:34
open an avocado that you've cut in half
21:36
and it has a ring prodded into it
21:38
and cosmopolitan magazine uh actually
21:41
found a few people who'd
21:42
proposed to women with avocados with
21:45
rings
21:46
shoved in them and i really liked the
21:47
juxtaposition so there was one guy
21:49
called randy gonzalez
21:51
who was from yeah gonzalez is not a
21:53
funny name guys
21:56
he was from connecticut he was an
21:58
american he did it on a beach where he
21:59
first met his girlfriend
22:01
and he um opened this avocado there's a
22:04
ring inside
22:05
and he said it just happened that a
22:06
professional photographer was nearby who
22:08
happened to be shooting something else
22:10
and we got in the way so we've got this
22:11
beautiful photo of it
22:13
and it is a really beautiful photo of
22:15
him doing it and he said he put the ring
22:17
in cling film because
22:18
no one wants a ring that's covered in
22:20
avocado i mean maybe no one wants a ring
22:22
that's presented within an avocado but
22:25
they interviewed him and then they
22:26
interviewed a guy from stamford
22:29
in lincolnshire called ben stevenson and
22:31
he
22:32
wanted to do the same thing he had to
22:33
postpone it at first because his
22:35
girlfriend got really ill in bali
22:37
and then when she wasn't really
22:38
recovered fully um he proposed her on a
22:41
beach
22:42
he looked around the avocado for two
22:43
days in the heat by that point so i've
22:45
seen the photo
22:46
that she put up later and it's kind of a
22:48
blackened rotting avocado
22:50
with a ring shoved in it he did not
22:52
cover the ring in cling film
22:54
so he did say there was some avocado on
22:57
the ring
22:57
um they they cut an avocado at the
23:01
wedding instead of a cake
23:02
but yeah it was a good juxtaposition and
23:05
there was no professional photographer
23:06
around for them so she just had to get
23:08
him to recreate the act later so she
23:10
could photograph it and post it on
23:12
instagram
23:13
wow and did they like monkey up that
23:16
the one for the second photo to make it
23:18
look realistic or
23:19
i i think they did it quite soon
23:20
afterwards so it was just still the same
23:22
manky avocado
23:26
all right let's move on to our final
23:28
fact of the show and that is my fact
23:30
my fact this week is that in the late
23:32
90s microsoft successfully acquired the
23:35
extremely valuable
23:37
domain name windows2000.com from a man
23:40
called
23:41
bob kirsten in exchange they gave him
23:45
bob.com how cool is that
23:48
that's awesome and they just happened to
23:49
have bob.com yes they did so they didn't
23:52
buy it for the sake of the trade because
23:54
windows 2000 was worth a lot of money
23:56
and they would have paid millions and
23:58
millions to get that
23:59
and companies often do for all these
24:01
people who in the early days of the
24:03
internet brought up all these domain
24:04
names
24:05
so um they went to him with an offer and
24:07
he said
24:08
that's not high enough but he noticed
24:10
that microsoft had a failed product
24:12
years ago called microsoft bob and when
24:15
they and it was run
24:16
and set up by bill gates wife melinda
24:20
and when she set it up the idea i don't
24:22
know if anyone remembers microsoft bob
24:24
but the idea was that
24:25
you know the little clippy guy who comes
24:27
up to help yeah it was a whole program
24:29
like that so you're you're accessible
24:45
there and you click on the calendar and
24:46
it would show your calendar or
24:48
there was like a letter and you click on
24:50
the letter and it would let you send
24:51
it let you send up to 15 emails per
24:54
month
24:55
[Laughter]
24:56
imagine that that's awesome and and it
25:00
was a total failure
25:01
um they released it in 95 i believe and
25:03
within 96
25:04
they immediately had to get rid of it
25:06
but they owned bob.com and it wasn't a
25:08
complete waste because there was a new
25:10
invention that was brought to bob.com
25:12
microsoft bob
25:13
and that was the font that was invented
25:15
for it was comic sans
25:18
oh wow that's where we got comics it
25:20
really is a pandora's box of evil
25:23
isn't it well pc world magazine called
25:26
it the seventh
25:27
worst tech product of all time wow yeah
25:31
i so i really liked it but i think that
25:33
just shows how behind the times i am but
25:35
it is if you look at bob.com
25:37
it was a cozy living room wasn't it it
25:39
made you feel like you're in a sitting
25:40
room and the idea was that you would
25:41
feel like your computer was all
25:43
around you but it didn't feel like a
25:45
computer it felt like a sitting room
25:46
with an open fire
25:48
and a cat it was just it was really nice
25:51
i can't believe i didn't take off
25:52
wait till you see facebook and twitter
25:55
i'm not ready i know i'm not ready
25:58
so bob.com exists now yeah if you go on
26:00
there you can see
26:01
um the story of of bob and all of the
26:04
things that he did
26:05
um at one time or other he also owned
26:07
broadband.com
26:08
dividend.com and englishman.com
26:12
and he when he had this um windows 2000
26:15
what he thought it would be
26:17
would be a window to the world so it'd
26:19
be a load of kind of webcam feeds from
26:21
all over the world
26:22
and you go on there and so that's why
26:24
it's called windows 2000 because there
26:25
would have been 2 000
26:26
windows no no
26:29
2000 in the 90s if you remember in the
26:31
90s the year 2000 was going to be
26:34
when everything went amazing i remember
26:37
it being the time when the world was
26:38
going to end
26:38
oh yeah because the millennium bug yeah
26:40
that's true i still own one of the
26:42
leaflets the government
26:43
safety leaflets of what to do when the
26:44
millennium bug comes oh what will you do
26:46
when it comes
26:47
it turns out you'll be fine according to
26:48
the leaflet don't worry about me
26:52
but they dressed it up as a scary
26:53
microchip with eight legs so it wasn't
26:55
convincing that yeah
26:56
yeah and microsoft in fact they had a
26:58
because they employed a person in 1999
27:01
who was
27:02
uh uh director of millennium bug
27:06
problems didn't they he was specifically
27:07
there to deal with basically everyone's
27:09
paranoia that anything was going to
27:10
happen
27:11
because yeah it definitely can i just
27:12
say as well because i know we'll have
27:14
some programmers listening
27:15
um the millennium bug didn't happen
27:17
because so many people worked so hard on
27:19
it that's just because i know the
27:20
letters we're gonna get if i
27:21
think it was a hoax i just like getting
27:25

27:26
well actually only just last year did
27:28
the american government stop working
27:31
on preventing the millennium bugs they
27:33
didn't realize they were still working
27:34
on it there was paperwork that was
27:36
constantly coming in and when the trump
27:37
administration went in they had someone
27:39
go through all the papers and they
27:40
realized there was a monthly report
27:41
going
27:42
we don't think it's going to happen in
27:44
2017.
27:46
so we've officially as of 2017 stopped
27:48
working
27:49
on stopping it so the first person to
27:51
kind of
27:52
buy a domain um that probably should
27:54
have been owned by a bigger corporation
27:57
was a guy called joshua quitner and he
28:00
just decided to register mcdonalds.com
28:02
himself no he didn't really know what
28:04
the deal was he just thought
28:05
well they haven't got it i might as well
28:07
and he got in touch with them and he
28:09
said oh
28:09
you know do you think maybe you'd like
28:11
to buy this off me and the official
28:13
reply he got
28:14
is are you finding that the internet is
28:16
a big thing
28:17
[Laughter]
28:20
have you heard of a guy called uzi
28:21
nissan nope he's so cool
28:24
so he uh is just a regular guy he has a
28:26
firm called nissan computer
28:28
it was a computing firm set it up in the
28:30
80s uh
28:31
way before nissan was even called nissan
28:33
it's called datsun back then
28:35
and when uh nissan made its name nissan
28:38
they started writing to him
28:39
and saying look we want nissan.com and
28:41
he said
28:42
sorry i've got nissan.com because my
28:44
name is nissan i have a company
28:45
and they sued him for a decade he spent
28:48
10 years they sued him for
28:50
time
28:51
[Laughter]
28:51
[Music]
28:54
so he's now 70 whereas he should be 16.
28:58
rough but he but he he held out he
29:01
resisted this massive company he had to
29:02
spend about three million dollars of his
29:04
own money
29:05
defending this case and he won and he
29:08
now has
29:08
nissan.com and if you go there it's a
29:10
website which tells you nissan are a
29:12
load of bastards
29:20
so it is a thing where um these
29:22
companies and bob
29:23
i think had this as well when he had
29:25
windows 2000.com
29:26
is that they do bring the lawyers in um
29:28
to get involved and i think bob actually
29:30
was the first person to
29:31
do it in reverse because they started
29:33
trying to sneakily
29:34
um put windows 2000 out there and he was
29:36
like i've got the trademark on that
29:38
um and and i should add that in the
29:40
settlement it wasn't just the trade of
29:41
the domain names he did get some money
29:43
but nowhere near what he
29:44
could have got he just said throw in
29:46
bob.com and that will do it
29:48
but companies now have to preemptively
29:50
just buy domain names that they hope
29:52
one day they might use so coca-cola for
29:54
example
29:55
owns the domain name ah dot com
29:59
how many a's are in there a h dot com
30:03
they also own ah.com
30:06
a h dot com they own
30:10
r.com up to 62 h's
30:15
i think at that point it's pronounced
30:19
do they own aah no oh i'm getting that
30:23
yeah
30:25
one guy i really like was you know peter
30:28
the
30:28
um the people who don't want anyone to
30:31
do anything bad against animals
30:33
but they're really kind of extremely
30:35
militant about it
30:36
there's a guy called michael doney who
30:38
um he bought peter.com
30:40
in 1995 and he put up his own site
30:43
which was actually for people eating
30:46
tasty animals
30:54
that's i'm i am against animal cruelty
30:56
but that is hilarious
31:00
there is we should mention the domain
31:02
name dispute that happened to microsoft
31:04
itself
31:04
the because i don't think we've ever
31:06
mentioned it before but microsoft
31:07
against
31:09
microsoft.com which was
31:12
uh it was quite famous at the time um
31:14
but it was the
31:15
early 21st century and a guy called mike
31:18
rowe
31:18
who was in 12th grade in canada um so
31:21
what he was 16 or 17
31:23
and he registered a domain name
31:26
microsoft
31:27
as a bit of fun wordplay and microsoft
31:30
demanded that he'd give it up we're like
31:32
you're not allowed this and they're not
31:33
you know that they're obviously big at
31:35
the time uh but they said we'll give you
31:37
ten dollars for that because that's
31:38
probably how much you spent registering
31:40
that
31:40
and he was so insulted by that offer
31:43
that he demanded ten
31:44
thousand dollars and microsoft took that
31:47
as a really aggressive move but it was
31:48
such bad publicity because
31:50
microsoft then clamped down really hard
31:52
on him and kind of said that he was
31:54
deliberately trying to
31:55
uh screw them over and trying to get
31:57
loads of money out of them and then the
31:58
media all got on poor old mike rowe's
32:00
side
32:00
and so eventually after all this
32:02
negative publicity microsoft ended up
32:04
having to give mike rowe
32:06
an all-expenses paid trip to the
32:08
microsoft research
32:09
tech fest lucky guy um
32:14
and they also gave him an xbox with a
32:16
full selection of games
32:18
and he gave it up for that and a small
32:20
fee
32:21
but he was he was a good guy he is a
32:23
good guy but i always wonder
32:25
like would you have andrew hunter murray
32:27
soft
32:28
um it's an usual kind of suffix to put
32:32
after your name isn't it
32:33
it is but he just thought the pun was
32:34
good enough i think to sacrifice that
32:36
and actually i i went on so what
32:38
microsoft did do was they
32:40
paid for him to set up microforums.com
32:43
instead and i thought i wonder what
32:44
micro forums is doing these days
32:46
and i wasted about half an hour it's
32:48
just suddenly
32:50
you have a questionnaire in front of you
32:51
with no context asking you loads of
32:53
personal details about who you are on
32:54
your life and stuff
32:55
so it asks you like where you live how
32:57
old you are who you live with
32:58
this is facebook well i think
33:01
maybe because i'm not on facebook so
33:03
maybe this is what it is i just
33:04
i checked all these boxes giving away
33:06
lots of personal information about
33:07
myself
33:08
is that facebook yes
33:11
oh no i'm the last one to fall
33:14
um i found out a couple of things about
33:16
um microsoft not about mike rowe soft
33:19
um so when they invented autocorrect
33:22
there's one guy who is basically the
33:24
father of autocorrect
33:25
no he was the father of till correct
33:30
[Applause]
33:33
so he's called dean hachamovic and he's
33:35
listed as the inventor and he basically
33:37
came up with a thing where you you put
33:38
in something
33:39
and he realized the space bar acts as a
33:41
command to
33:42
translate for example into the
33:45
and when he invented it he immediately
33:47
went onto his boss's computer
33:49
and switched dean so it automatically
33:50
became mike and he switched mike so it
33:52
automatically became dean
33:54
because his name was dean and after that
33:56
his boss started locking his office door
33:58
[Laughter]
34:00
we're gonna have to wrap up shortly just
34:03
quickly the guy who invented solitaire
34:05
related to that is was also a really
34:07
cool guy but he
34:08
was um an intern at microsoft in 1989
34:12
and he was just trying to get to grips
34:13
with microsoft software so he was really
34:14
young he was about 17 he was at school
34:16
and he invented this game and microsoft
34:20
sort of found it on their system
34:22
and they picked it up and they put it on
34:23
all their computers they obviously made
34:25
lots of money out of it
34:26
this guy didn't make any money out of it
34:27
but he doesn't mind at all
34:29
he says he's very happy and but he
34:31
originally on the original version of
34:32
solitaire there was what he called a
34:34
boss button
34:35
which is a button that you press when
34:36
your boss is coming towards you and it
34:37
immediately switches to a screen that
34:39
makes it look like you're doing work
34:40
yeah and microsoft told him he had to
34:42
remove it
34:43
oh really oh really and i now looked him
34:46
up and it's like he's betrayed
34:47
microsoft because he works for apple
34:51
in an orchard he runs an orchard
34:55
making cider so good
34:59

fascinating it's by mel burton

and it is that astronauts have to
35:50

00:15
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:17
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:20
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:22
covent garden my name is dan schreiber
00:25
and i'm sitting here with andrew hunter
00:26
murray james harkin and anna chazinski
00:29
and once again we have gathered around
00:31
the microphones with our four favorite
00:33
facts of the last seven days and in no
00:35
particular order here we go
00:38
starting with fact number one and that's
00:40
my fact this week my fact is that in an
00:42
attempt to work out who the murderer in
00:44
charles dickens's last unfinished novel
00:46
was the lead character was put on trial
00:50
wow
00:51
so this is the mystery of edwin drew
00:53
yeah this was the final novel of charles
00:55
dickens that he was serializing in a
00:57
newspaper there were meant to be twelve
00:59
installments he only got as far as six
01:01
before he passed away and
01:03
as it was the lead character edwin drew
01:05
goes he disappears and uh so we never
01:08
know what happened to him and people
01:10
ever since have been trying to work it
01:12
out by looking for clues within it and
01:15
so on and in 1914 a mock trial was put
01:18
on as part of an attempt to try and work
01:20
out who who might have murdered him and
01:22
the lead character of the book john
01:23
jasper was put on trial and it was full
01:25
of celebrities the judge of the trial
01:27
was g.k chesterton
01:29
uh the foreman of the jury was george
01:31
bernard shaw it was a very very cool
01:34
trial and did they find him
01:36
innocent or guilty or no they i think
01:39
they wanted to go for manslaughter in
01:40
the end um but then uh yeah gk
01:43
chesterton got very impatient with
01:44
everyone and found everyone guilty of
01:46
contempt of court by the end of the day
01:48
nice except himself right except himself
01:50
when when do you get a judge finding
01:52
himself guilty of terms of court that's
01:54
super rare i think that has happened i
01:56
remember that happening in america in
01:57
the last few years really yeah wow is
01:59
that a really good moral judge or an
02:02
extremely immoral judge it's hard to say
02:04
because he just looked at himself and
02:05
gone god even i can see that i'm
02:07
terrible
02:08
my feeling is and i might be wrong about
02:10
this maybe a judge had his mobile phone
02:12
on or something and then he got a call
02:15
and he kind of found himself in contempt
02:17
or something
02:18
yeah that rings a bell yeah that's
02:19
really good so fans fans of this novel
02:21
are called drew ids which i think is
02:23
very clever yes yeah
02:25
um or uh druidians or drudists yeah yeah
02:28
there's a whole website where you can
02:30
read every single um possible scenario
02:33
or sort of outcome of what might have
02:35
happened to edwin drude
02:36
and there's hundreds of over the years
02:38
just so many people have been trying to
02:40
work it out there's been four movies
02:42
that have been made of the book where
02:43
different outcomes have been revealed at
02:45
the end there was a broadway musical
02:48
whereby the audience actually voted on
02:50
who they thought it was at the end of
02:52
the show it wasn't only that was it so
02:54
this musical was a really big deal i'd
02:55
never actually heard of it but it won
02:57
five tony awards i think it won best
02:59
musical in the 80s and
03:01
best actor i think but it was the
03:03
audience got to vote on who killed edwin
03:05
drewes and they also got to vote on
03:07
various other things so they got to vote
03:09
on what was the identity of dick dattory
03:12
which was unknown at the time dickens
03:14
stopped writing and they got to vote on
03:15
which couple would become romantically
03:17
involved in the end and all the actors
03:19
had to train up to be able to perform
03:21
any scene of any of these possible
03:23
outcomes when i was a child i had a
03:25
computer game called star wars chess and
03:28
uh obviously there was a good team in an
03:30
evil team all characters from star wars
03:32
and every single possible move
03:34
combination that you made there was a
03:35
little cut scene showing you how r2d2
03:38
defeated darth vader yeah but not for
03:40
every single possible game of chess
03:42
because there's like no trillions for
03:44
every piece combo so you would always
03:46
have a good rook defeating you know um
03:48
an evil uh pawn or you would have it was
03:51
brilliant wow yeah i'm surprised
03:53
actually because it sounds very geeky
03:55
that and you never really struck me as
03:56
the kind of person who would like that
03:58
kind of thing yeah weird isn't it
04:00
speaking of which has anyone else been
04:01
in a mock trial in their life no yes
04:03
have you what a white school yeah same
04:06
yeah yeah for what what did you both do
04:08
um arson it turned out and i was livid
04:11
no i'm joking i was a lawyer in the mock
04:12
trial yeah me too yeah yeah it's really
04:14
fun that's so fun and what well hmm they
04:17
put on charm they give you a big dossier
04:18
of facts about a case so mine was um a
04:21
fight in a pub someone had been hit with
04:23
a pool cue i think oh yeah and
04:25
they give you lots of different
04:26
eyewitness accounts and you have to then
04:28
hold a trial and you sometimes i think
04:29
we went to an actual court to do this
04:31
very exciting wow
04:33
yeah are you just you're a juvenile
04:35
delinquent and you've kind of post
04:37
rationalized it as a game that's it yeah
04:39
um we went to a court when we were kids
04:42
at school yeah uh and i remember it
04:45
because we were there
04:47
basically a load of kids and then these
04:49
people just kept coming up and they'd
04:50
all be beating each other up the night
04:52
before because it was like
04:54
wow it was basically people had been
04:55
locked up that night for assault and
04:58
then they were coming in doing their
05:00
pleas and stuff like that that's your
05:01
school trip
05:03
everyone else went to um alton towers
05:05
but yeah
05:06
we sort of went to the battle of
05:07
hastings site and i mean that in a sense
05:09
was lots of people beating each other up
05:11
so
05:12
i think maybe it was just um to prepare
05:14
us for the future oh god
05:17
it's weird that they felt they need to
05:18
investigate it though because dickens
05:19
did actually finish edwin drew didn't he
05:21
what did he he finished it um
05:24
yeah he finished it in 1873.
05:27
um so he died in 1870.
05:32
he did finish it him with a medium but
05:34
it was but it was with a medium called
05:36
thomas power james which i think is
05:38
really cool and this book it was the
05:40
mystery of everyone drew part two and he
05:42
published part one kind of cockley under
05:44
his own name now thomas power james and
05:46
then part two was what the media what
05:48
he'd learned from dickens's ghost and it
05:49
had two prefaces at the start of it one
05:52
from thomas power james who was saying
05:54
this is such a privilege to be able to
05:55
write with dickens and then the other
05:56
from dickens himself saying
05:58
you'll notice it's nice
06:02
so
06:02
there is a story that dickens wrote to
06:04
queen victoria a few months before his
06:07
death and he was saying to her would you
06:09
like a spoiler of what happened to edwin
06:11
drude and she wrote back and she said no
06:14
i'm fine thank you ouch she offered her
06:16
a little more of it in advance of her
06:18
subjects and she said that's cool i'm
06:20
enjoying the installments or whatever
06:21
she said yeah we could have had queen
06:23
victoria solving the mystery of what
06:25
happened to evan drew which would have
06:26
been very cool wow well supposedly the
06:29
illustrator of the book claimed to have
06:31
known who the who the murderer was so
06:33
his name was luke fields um and
06:36
he had given
06:38
instructions by dickens that john jasper
06:40
he wear a necktie and the idea was that
06:42
jasper strangles edwin drude with it
06:45
and he used to have a close
06:46
collaboration obviously with uh dickens
06:49
because he liked to seed things that
06:50
would appear later in the story so maybe
06:53
maybe he did do it we don't even know
06:54
that edwin drew died though no we don't
06:56
at the time the book ends he has just
06:58
disappeared he might come back most
06:59
people at the time kind of thought that
07:01
he was just he hadn't died didn't they
07:03
yeah it's like the prevailing theory at
07:04
the time well there's another character
07:06
did you mention dick dachary yeah some
07:08
people think that edwin drude is dick
07:10
dappery who turns up after when crude
07:11
disappears
07:13
i know that would mean so much more to
07:15
me if i knew what the story was
07:17
have you guys read this i haven't i
07:18
started reading it today and i was too
07:20
hungover again
07:22
about five pages
07:24
i would have thought anna because you
07:25
read loads of dickens i i chose not to
07:27
read the one that's only half finished
07:29
but i do really want to now partly
07:31
because people say that it's so
07:32
impossible to work out what might have
07:34
happened like there was one woman who
07:35
adapted it for the bbc and she had to
07:37
finish it a few years ago and she said a
07:40
lot of people know that dickens didn't
07:41
finish edwin drude what they don't know
07:43
is that he died intentionally so that he
07:46
didn't have to because he literally had
07:48
no idea how to tie up all these loose
07:49
ends
07:50
stephen king has an unfinished work now
07:53
he's still alive obviously but he has an
07:55
unfinished word is it just the thing
07:56
he's working on at the moment
08:00
um
08:01
it's called the plant and oh yeah really
08:03
interesting experiment he did so he
08:04
published it chapter by chapter online
08:06
just like dickens and he asked people to
08:07
pay for it online a dollar per chapter
08:10
and he said if the number of people
08:12
paying for this dips below 75 of the
08:14
people who are downloading it and
08:15
reading it then i will stop writing it
08:18
and that's exactly what happened after
08:20
about five chapters really yeah so some
08:22
people were really annoyed because
08:24
they'd paid six or seven dollars
08:26
and they didn't get a finished story but
08:28
by part four only 46 percent of people
08:30
who downloaded it were paying for it
08:32
really is it bad have you looked at it
08:34
do you know what it's about is it about
08:35
a plant it's about an author who i think
08:37
receives a creepy gift of a plant i mean
08:40
it doesn't it doesn't exactly sound like
08:41
the shining glass yeah
08:43
no i've heard i've heard it's very good
08:45
um and it was just for that reason he
08:47
was testing the internet model of
08:50
commerce and it didn't work for him but
08:52
um he did release if you remember his
08:53
book the green mile which was
08:55
transformed
08:57
it was made into a movie with tragedy
08:59
majestically into this world don't have
09:01
the book anymore because it was
09:02
transformed into a film transformed into
09:04
the film transformers yeah
09:06
so uh the green mall he did that with
09:08
the dickens model as well he put out
09:10
single chapters and because the idea was
09:13
dickens always used to end on a
09:14
cliffhanger and he thought could i do
09:15
that and could i generate a whole book
09:17
where i was forcing myself month by
09:19
month to reveal the next chapter and
09:21
yeah so that's what the green mall is
09:22
there's one book that we'll never read
09:24
so i looked at a bit of unpublished
09:26
novels oh yeah and evelyn war wrote uh
09:28
his first novel actually called the
09:30
temple at thatch in 1925 and then he
09:33
gave a draft to his friend called harold
09:35
acton and acton gave it quite a bad
09:37
review so he wrote a letter to evelyn
09:39
war saying suggesting that he do it in a
09:42
few elegant copies for the friends who
09:44
really love you and then he gave a list
09:46
of the suggested friends and they were
09:47
all the idiots they knew and even the
09:49
wall was so upset by this so devastated
09:52
that um he went he walked down to the
09:54
sea he took all his clothes off he left
09:55
a note with a euripides quote about how
09:58
the sea can wash away all ills and then
10:00
he swam into the sea intending to commit
10:01
suicide and he was stung by a jellyfish
10:04
so he gave up and returned to shore
10:08
wow so yeah if it weren't for a
10:10
jellyfish we would not have brideshead
10:12
revisited you don't hear people taking
10:14
off all their clothes and going into the
10:16
sea these days do you
10:18
know that used to be a thing didn't it i
10:20
think so craig venter who's famous for
10:22
sequencing dna he did that as well um he
10:26
i think he was fighting in the vietnam
10:27
war and
10:29
it wasn't a clever tactic was it right
10:31
what we'll do is we'll all leave our
10:33
clothes at the shore they'll think
10:34
they've won actually we've gone around
10:36
in a big boat
10:37
no he uh
10:39
that's not what happened andy um
10:42
you weren't there man yeah you were
10:43
there
10:44
uh no he got very he got very depressed
10:46
and he swam out to sea i think he did
10:48
exactly that took all of his clothes off
10:50
and then um while he was quite far out
10:52
he suddenly had an empathy that he
10:53
wanted to live and that he had he wanted
10:55
to do well in science and so on and he
10:57
turned around to come back and that
10:58
supposedly is the big problem when you
11:00
swim too far out and people have a
11:01
change of mind you're too far out to
11:03
have the energy to swim all the way back
11:05
uh and so he said that was the hardest
11:07
struggle of
11:08
anything he's ever done yeah because he
11:10
lost all his energy and then in this
11:12
moment of sort of near death he realized
11:14
he wanted to live you know what happened
11:15
to terry pratchett's unfinished works i
11:17
think he had about 10 novels on the go
11:19
at the time he died
11:20
in various stages of completion
11:21
obviously so some much closer than the
11:23
others but they were crushed by a
11:24
steamroller after he died oh by accident
11:27
no it was deliberate he decreed in his
11:30
will that he wanted them to be crushed
11:31
by steamroller but it's paper
11:34
no it was a hard drive got it yeah
11:36
otherwise
11:37
i mean how could you get a piece of
11:39
paper
11:41
oh no this piece of paper is completely
11:43
flattered
11:46
it was done by a vintage steamroller at
11:48
a steam fair and it was called lord
11:50
jericho the steamroller sounds quite
11:52
cool good name for a steamroller yeah it
11:53
is yeah it's now it was done as part of
11:56
a celebration of opening of an
11:57
exhibition for all his work and that's
11:59
now part of the exhibition is his broken
12:01
hard drive
12:02
yeah i think dickens didn't know what
12:05
happened at the end of edwin drude
12:06
because i didn't realize that the ending
12:08
of great expectations i think quite
12:10
famously originally was different which
12:12
is so satisfying because it's always
12:13
been kind of an annoying ending where
12:15
spoilers guys close your ears if you
12:17
haven't read it
12:18
so estella and pip obviously end up
12:20
together quite abruptly at the end sort
12:23
of end up together they walk off into
12:24
the sunset together and the last line is
12:26
something like uh i saw no more shadow
12:28
of her leaving my side or something like
12:30
that um but in his original one he
12:32
probably sent off the publishers and
12:34
stuff and they'd split up as stella had
12:37
she was widowed she then married someone
12:38
else they had a little meeting and he
12:40
went oh how sad i guess we'll never be
12:42
together and then he sent that to the
12:43
publishers went on holiday with his mate
12:46
who was a guy called it was edward
12:49
bullalitton and went on holiday with him
12:51
showed him this and he's his friend said
12:53
that's too miserable you've got to
12:54
change it immediately and so he
12:57
immediately quickly hurriedly changed it
12:59
and had them end up together it's quite
13:00
good as an author if someone says that's
13:02
crap you need to change it to actually
13:04
do it isn't it i would have thought he
13:06
would have just gone no
13:08
yeah well he bullet litten was kind of
13:10
the leading author of his time and it's
13:12
weird no one really reads him anymore
13:13
but he came up with the phrases the
13:15
great unwashed and the pen is mightier
13:17
than the sword two phrases i use every
13:19
day
13:22
andy why do you not get on the bus uh
13:24
because i haven't had my shower yet and
13:26
so i am feeling a bit like the great
13:28
unwashed
13:29
okay
13:34
you just use it non-metaphorically idiot
13:38
why are you attacking that person with a
13:39
pen oh well the thing is james the pen
13:41
is nicer than the sword
13:43
my sword is absolutely tiny but i've had
13:45
this special novelty samurai pen build
13:48
i could take your head off
13:50
[Applause]
13:55
okay it's time for fact number two and
13:58
that is chiczinski
14:00
my fact this week is that in the past 10
14:02
years the number of registered pinball
14:04
players worldwide has gone from 500 to
14:08
over a hundred thousand
14:10
that's a big increase it's a big jump
14:13
how people got really into it
14:15
why do you have to register
14:17
you you were allowed to play pinball
14:18
without being officially registered but
14:20
then there is the international flipper
14:22
pinball association which is where you
14:24
officially register if you want to take
14:25
part in competitions or just be
14:26
recognized as a player and this is i
14:29
think it was measured by them in 2006
14:32
and there were 500 official players and
14:33
then nbc reported last year there are
14:35
over a hundred thousand and this is huge
14:37
comeback
14:38
do you have to sign the register of
14:40
pinballers
14:41
what do you mean
14:42
well just normally when there's a
14:43
register you have to sign the register
14:45
do you yeah
14:47
the only other thing you don't have to
14:48
sign the sex offenders register do you
14:50
well i don't know but
14:51
[Laughter]
14:53
why have you got special
14:55
circumstances but in the register at
14:57
school they just say your name and you
14:58
say here yeah that's true but
15:01
they don't do that it's not a registered
15:03
footballer where they read out 50 000
15:05
names
15:06
it's obviously ridiculous not all 100
15:08
000 people attend every single contest
15:10
and you don't need to check them all in
15:14
and the idea is that uh pinball is now
15:16
becoming really fashionable again is
15:17
that what you're saying that does seem
15:19
to be it and forbes cited the bbc as
15:21
being the first to spot this in 2012
15:23
they ran a piece on how people were
15:25
getting back into it and it's thought
15:26
one of the reasons is actually kind of
15:28
video games where pinball is one of the
15:31
games you can play on certain video
15:32
games or on computers and so younger
15:34
kids got into it on that and then wanted
15:35
to do the real 3d version and on phones
15:38
and stuff right exactly smartphones yeah
15:41
um but yeah pinball is great but it's
15:43
got quite a checkered history i think
15:45
have we done on qi that it was banned
15:47
for a long time we haven't done yet
15:49
because the p series isn't going to go
15:51
out until the end of the year but i've
15:52
just a slight feeling that we might
15:54
mention it at some stage in the future
15:56
oh god that's that premonition coming
15:59
back get in there quick anna um so pimba
16:01
was banned in 1942 it was banned in new
16:03
york and then most big american cities
16:05
followed because it was kind of seen as
16:07
gambling which is a bit weird because
16:08
you often didn't even win money i think
16:10
it was often seen as just a slippery
16:12
slope because if you play on a pinball
16:13
machine you might then play on a proper
16:15
gambling machine yeah you won prizes
16:17
though you could win players or you
16:18
could win three games
16:20
and the gambling bit was because back
16:22
then what we know is pinball is almost
16:24
the essential bit of pinball which is
16:26
the two flipper bits that you press on
16:27
the side that didn't exist i know crazy
16:30
yes it was just it was a game of chance
16:32
it was like roulette yeah
16:34
you would bet on the result wouldn't you
16:35
so you bet i think it's going to land in
16:37
slot whatever yeah right yeah then if
16:40
you've got it right you might win a free
16:41
go but it sounds much less fun than
16:43
having control of the flippers yeah
16:44
you're still allowed to like tilt it and
16:46
nudge it and stuff like that oh okay
16:48
they did a lot didn't they yeah that's
16:50
kind of how you control it but yeah they
16:51
didn't invent the flipper still 1947
16:53
five years after the ban
16:55
and then there was this big trial in
16:57
america in the 70s when um this is a guy
17:01
called roger sharp whose son zach i
17:03
think is now ranked number one in
17:05
pinball but he was hired in 1976 by the
17:08
maa the music and amusement association
17:10
to try to be a star witness in this
17:12
trial that overturned the ban and he had
17:14
to prove it was a game of skill not a
17:16
game of chance and there was this
17:17
amazing moment so he played two games he
17:19
was moved on to a backup machine because
17:21
they thought that he might have like
17:23
tweaked his own machine in his own favor
17:25
so he's moved on to a backup machine he
17:27
played really well for two goes and then
17:28
the judge wasn't that impressed and he
17:29
said okay if i make it through the
17:31
middle lane in one shot will you
17:33
overturn the ban and the judge was like
17:35
yeah sure and he took one shot and it
17:37
landed exactly where he said it was
17:38
going to land the ball did and then the
17:40
jury voted to overturn it that
17:42
supposedly happened in darts as well
17:43
didn't it and like did it 150 years ago
17:46
or something yeah like they had to prove
17:48
that it was a game of skill and so some
17:50
guy in leeds kind of got into court and
17:52
through
17:53
darts where he said they were going to
17:54
go and then the judge came up and tried
17:56
to do it and he couldn't do it and he's
17:57
like oh it must be a game of skill then
17:59
how did they possibly think that was a
18:01
game of chance i mean it's so obvious
18:07
when last time i played dance it was
18:08
against my wife and she beat me and i
18:10
kind of thought that maybe it was a game
18:12
of luck actually right this band was
18:15
absolutely mad so mayor laguardia
18:18
fiorello laguardia who the main airport
18:20
in new york is named after now um he
18:23
said that people who pushed pinball were
18:24
slimy crews of tin horns well-dressed
18:27
and living in luxury on penny thievery
18:29
and he was photographed with a
18:30
sledgehammer smashing up pinball
18:32
machines
18:33
and he ordered the police to make
18:34
prohibition style raids on pinball
18:37
machines their top priority
18:39
top priority new york it was 1942 as
18:42
well
18:43
total war
18:44
it was the methamphetamine of its day
18:46
yeah but they they did ritualistic
18:48
things to the pimple machines so
18:50
basically
18:51
[Laughter]
18:54
basically they said it was a waste of
18:55
metals which could be turned into
18:57
armaments and bullets so 5000 machines
18:59
were confiscated and destroyed they were
19:01
dumped into long island sound but the
19:04
metal in the balls was confiscated and
19:05
supposedly it was enough to build four
19:07
two thousand pound bombs
19:09
and the police
19:10
carved the pinball table legs into
19:12
cudgels and presented them to me
19:14
laguardia but then they dropped the bomb
19:17
on some enemies but they just flipped it
19:19
away didn't they
19:21
that's what the downbusters was based on
19:22
actually um and the basically even
19:26
though it was illegal they still use
19:27
them didn't they they just moved them to
19:29
pornography shops
19:30
right
19:32
so if you if you wanted to play pinball
19:34
you had to go to a pornography shop so
19:36
you'd send your seven-year-old like okay
19:38
you can play the game but yeah
19:40
god that's that's terrible that's very
19:42
funny idea yeah that's amazing very
19:45
distracting it'd be much harder to focus
19:47
i think on your pinball game if you're
19:48
surrounded by porn yeah
19:51
maybe if i ever join this um this
19:54
association and do it professionally
19:56
yeah i can see you doing that then when
19:58
the other guys are playing i'm just
19:59
going to put pawn everywhere
20:01
i'm trying to make it like the 40s for
20:03
you this is classic pinball
20:05
i really like laguardia um as in i i've
20:08
never really i've known his name through
20:10
the airport i didn't know he was the
20:11
mayor i had no idea uh and i saw photos
20:14
of him and he looks like a mafia batman
20:17
villain like he he looks amazing so i
20:19
thought okay i'll just quickly look into
20:20
him so they're all this stuff of him
20:22
being against uh the pinballing and
20:24
sledgehammering in the prohibition style
20:26
raids he was someone who was sort of
20:28
kind of against the alcoholic
20:29
prohibition that was going on and
20:31
actively protested it and so he invited
20:34
20 newspaper reporters to his
20:35
congressional office in washington dc
20:37
and there he drank it in front of them
20:40
and he had a beer that was admittedly it
20:42
had low alcohol so i think it was almost
20:44
on the edge of legality and he mixed it
20:46
with um
20:47
with some tonic and he drank it in front
20:49
of the reporters with a straight face to
20:51
say look at this i just think that's
20:53
really pathetic i think if you're going
20:54
to make a statement by drinking beer
20:56
during prohibition don't drink low
20:58
alcohol beer mixed with tonic just see
21:02
there's prohibition in this country and
21:04
you're an mp
21:06
drinking a full bottle of gin on the
21:08
steps of the house of commons
21:10
this is the point i am making
21:13
what was i saying
21:14
where are my keys
21:17
okay so given that pinball was banned
21:18
for such a long time this is a nice
21:20
thing the museum of pinball is in a
21:22
place called banning in california
21:24
that's very yeah that's really good yeah
21:26
and i think the guy who won the world
21:28
championships last year was 13 years old
21:30
so this is he's a guy called escher
21:32
lefkoff and he plays with his dad i
21:35
think but it really is attracting all
21:37
ages it's one one's just opened up in
21:39
london actually in december 2017 we've
21:41
got our first proper devoted pinball
21:44
that's cool i think we definitely should
21:45
go in
21:46
oh
21:47
no
21:49
we'll put on the back burner
21:51
do you know what gobble hole is
21:53
nope
21:55
i think i do
21:58
uh it's just a hole in the playing field
22:00
of a pinball machine which the ball can
22:02
fall in ending ending that oh that's
22:04
right
22:05
that's a mean move to have in the middle
22:07
of a pimple yeah
22:08
i think the ball can fall down do you
22:10
know what a thrust magnet is
22:12
thrust magnet these are names these are
22:15
all names of magazines that used to
22:16
surround the pinball machine
22:20
a thrust magnet is just an electromagnet
22:22
that accelerates the ball through a tube
22:25
okay it goes quicker
22:26
do you know what draenomatic is
22:30
i got 300 of these yeah yeah yeah let's
22:32
keep going until we get one no a
22:33
dramatic is a pinball game where the
22:35
balls are lost too easily so it's like
22:38
you just keep losing all the time it
22:39
drains your money i know like when you
22:41
go on a fruit machine but someone's
22:43
already won it loads and so it just eats
22:45
up all your money yeah it doesn't have
22:46
any left damn the cheating machines
22:49
um in japan arcade games are very much
22:52
more popular than they are here and
22:53
they've got such a good array of them
22:55
have you guys come across the tablecloth
22:58
hour game no i really like this it's
23:00
it's an arcade game but instead of
23:02
having like a joystick or buttons that
23:03
you press it's got um a sticking out bit
23:06
that's like the edge of a tablecloth
23:07
like something hanging over a table and
23:09
then on the screen there's lots of
23:10
crockery and you just pull the tape off
23:14
that sounds really good see if you can
23:15
avoid breaking the crop that's
23:17
incredible have you done that in real
23:18
life tried to do that in real life no
23:20
it's really hard yeah
23:22
because i used to work in a restaurant
23:24
and i used to try it not for longer but
23:28
your wages were docked every week and
23:30
smasher fired from 10 restaurants in a
23:32
row
23:34
but of course you have lots of crockery
23:36
and you have tablecloths what else are
23:38
you going to do if you're a teenager
23:40
you're going to try it can it really be
23:41
done i guess it could be done if you're
23:43
really really fast right it could be
23:44
done like for just one
23:46
one object you could kind of do it
23:49
but more often than that it would just
23:51
go flying
23:52
that's so funny
23:54
we said before there's a japanese arcade
23:55
game where you have to poke oh yeah a
23:57
robot bottom yes with your finger yeah
24:00
this is a game where it's a sort of
24:01
prank on your friend to stick yeah
24:04
because there is a prank in japan known
24:06
as the enema i can't remember what their
24:08
word for it is and you go through all
24:10
the different games and you have to do
24:12
it to the teacher and then to the
24:14
policeman and then someone else and the
24:15
game is just to poke in real life no no
24:18
it's in game oh it's in the game but the
24:19
prank is a real life thing right it's
24:21
like you know like a wet willy where you
24:22
put your finger in someone's ear it's
24:24
like that but with an anus
24:26
it's much harder to shove your finger up
24:28
someone's anus i think yeah especially
24:30
when everyone's wearing clothes also
24:31
they almost always are you say the words
24:33
wet willy before you do it as well
24:35
sounds a bit bad
24:36
i think you're all gonna have to sign
24:37
the register
24:41
[Applause]
24:45
[Music]
24:47
okay it's time to move on to fact number
24:49
three and that is james okay my fact
24:52
this week is that the victorians had
24:53
better reaction times than we do today
24:59
[Laughter]
25:01
did they that's a good question anna
25:03
because did they
25:06
the thing is some people think they may
25:08
have done okay uh and this is because
25:11
we've we can work out what people's
25:13
reactions times are now by doing studies
25:15
and stuff and we have some old results
25:18
um done by a friend of the podcast
25:20
francis galton we've talked about lots
25:22
of i mean major eugenicists probably an
25:23
acquaintance of the podcast i'd say
25:27
but it was in a time when eugenics was
25:29
cool
25:30
yeah it was uh which is not now of
25:32
course
25:33
um
25:34
but his um statistics show that people
25:37
who he studied had quicker reactions
25:39
than people today and so it could be
25:41
that his uh data are wrong
25:44
uh or it could be that people have
25:46
gotten less quick
25:48
yeah
25:49
which do you think it is i think people
25:52
have come up with reasons why it might
25:53
be that we're slower like maybe there's
25:55
a lot more contaminants in the air and
25:57
your brains have got more mercury in
25:59
them or or whatever your brains have got
26:01
more stuff in them that are making them
26:02
slower wow
26:04
there are a lot of serious people who
26:05
think this is true yeah my favorite one
26:07
is in the 20th century there was a
26:09
scholar called irwin w silverman who
26:12
believed the reason that we got slower
26:14
reactions is because height has
26:15
increased therefore it's taken longer
26:18
for things to travel to the brain or
26:19
from the brain so it's that extra bit of
26:22
time does that not sort of make sense a
26:24
bit i think they found that tall people
26:26
are just as fast oh okay yeah from where
26:29
because most reactions are based on you
26:31
seeing something and responding to it
26:33
and your eyes don't get further from
26:34
your brain as you get taller yeah
26:38
that's true you'll understand if someone
26:40
stands on your foot maybe it takes you a
26:42
bit longer now to back away but yeah it
26:45
doesn't make any sense at all i'll
26:46
retract my earlier comment then it
26:48
doesn't actually anything that does make
26:49
sense my favorite guy who studied this
26:51
was um the 93rd most cited psychologist
26:55
of the 20th century he is called edwin
26:57
boring
26:59
he's my favorite psychologist
27:02
i just love him um one day maybe we'll
27:04
talk about him but his most famous thing
27:06
that he did was work out why one reason
27:09
why moons look bigger when they're on
27:11
the horizon than when they're up in the
27:13
sky oh yeah
27:15
i just like the idea that he was cited
27:17
in so many papers because his name was
27:19
boring so he must be people slagging him
27:21
off indirectly by just putting a little
27:23
asterisk in at the bottom saying boring
27:27
i read that um one of the things to help
27:29
uh this has done a team of japanese
27:32
scientists and researchers uh came out
27:34
with these results saying
27:36
a way of getting your reactions to be
27:38
better is to chew gum
27:39
um which is really interesting yeah i've
27:41
not heard that before so they they did
27:44
this they did this experiment where they
27:46
said that um chewing on gum improves the
27:49
participants reaction time by seven
27:51
percent which is an average of 36
27:53
milliseconds
27:55
uh doesn't sound like a lot but the
27:56
point is made that in say like sport
27:58
where it takes less than half a second
28:00
for a baseball pitcher to pitch a ball
28:03
to the mitt that's that's obviously a
28:05
huge amount of time right um so what
28:07
they say is that it only takes 10
28:09
seconds of chewing to activate the brain
28:11
regions that are responsible for
28:13
improving your reactions and after
28:15
you've done the 10 seconds it keeps it
28:17
active for 15 minutes wow you buy 15
28:19
minutes of extra reaction time off 10
28:22
seconds of chewing gum you are chewing
28:24
steroids
28:25
[Laughter]
28:27
congratulations by the way on the tour
28:28
de france wind
28:30
do we know what the mechanism is that
28:33
is it that chewing saliva means that
28:35
you're according to this it says uh your
28:38
jaw muscles when you chew stimulate
28:39
certain regions of your brain including
28:42
the premature cortex
28:44
okay works for me that sounds like
28:46
science
28:48
i got it from science.com
28:51
so uh on reaction times um you know the
28:54
thing of uh gunfights in films yes where
28:57
there are two cowboys facing each other
28:59
and obviously the bad guy draws first
29:00
because he's an evil trickster and he's
29:02
trying to legitimately gain an advantage
29:04
in the gunfight by shooting first and
29:06
then the good guy draws second but
29:07
always wins
29:08
so nils ball one of the most famous
29:10
physicists of all time was obsessed with
29:12
this and he theorized that gunslingers
29:15
who draw second they draw faster because
29:17
they're not thinking it's just it's an
29:20
instinctive reaction it's like a
29:21
separate circuit that works it's almost
29:23
like a reflex reaction interesting and
29:25
he staged mock duels with toy guns at
29:28
his lab in between all the other
29:30
important stuff he was doing and his
29:32
partner george gamma drew first and lost
29:34
every time however it's recently been
29:36
proved by a university of birmingham
29:38
study that he was partially right but it
29:41
wouldn't quite help so if you draw
29:43
second if you draw responding to if i'm
29:46
facing you and you draw i see you
29:48
drawing and i draw first yeah you're
29:49
about 10 faster when you draw second
29:51
than when you draw first
29:53
but the difference that it would make is
29:54
only 21 milliseconds
29:56
that's enough and is that not yet if
29:58
someone's already pulled a gun on you
29:59
it's likely that you won't be able to
30:02
say i'll be 21 milliseconds faster but
30:04
the gap in time between anna's starting
30:06
and me starting will still be longer
30:08
than 21 milliseconds so i'll still die
30:10
so the scientists who studied this
30:12
andrew welchman he said you'll die
30:14
satisfied that you were quicker but
30:16
that's not much to you i don't
30:17
understand how if you're using fake guns
30:20
not real guns you can tell who
30:23
got hit first i think they kind of had a
30:25
paintball paintball or something balls
30:28
paintballs are edible
30:30
so if you got shot in the mouth
30:33
you're laughing yeah and you're full
30:36
it's just yeah are they nice no they're
30:38
really not nice but they're they're made
30:40
of like food coloring and the um the
30:43
outer shell is like some kind of
30:45
plant-based after you were fired from
30:46
every restaurant in bolton james
30:48
actually went to work at a paintball
30:50
place from which he was sacked
30:52
eating the ammo
30:56
you can't get away with it because
30:57
you've just got red stuff all around
30:58
your mouth no
31:03
hello by the way the only two scientists
31:05
we've cited so far are boring and bore
31:07
that's quite cool oh yeah
31:09
um so other reaction time things uh in
31:13
running races if you're if you're doing
31:15
a sprinting race then if you move within
31:17
0.1 seconds of the starting gun going
31:19
off that counts as a false start so even
31:22
if you move after the starting gun going
31:24
off you've made a full start because
31:26
it's thought that well it's known that
31:28
you can't possibly have reacted that
31:30
fast to the gun going off so you must
31:32
have started before you heard it go off
31:34
but that 0.1 is based on an experiment
31:37
that was done in 1865
31:39
and it still stands today so it was done
31:40
in 1865 by a scientist called franciscus
31:44
cornelis dondas who was actually an
31:46
ophthalmologist but he also worked out
31:48
reaction times he gave electric shocks
31:49
to people's feet and then he had them
31:51
squeeze stuff with their hands with a
31:53
corresponding hand and it was how quick
31:55
it was for people to go oh you need
31:57
to let you keep my feet
32:00
really really short people actually
32:02
reacted much much faster than tall
32:04
people
32:05
which is why the best sprinters are so
32:07
short look at the same boat he's only
32:08
three foot nine
32:10
i spent all day on the internet just
32:12
testing my reaction time and i agree
32:15
that i don't think you can get quicker
32:16
than 0.1 seconds right it's going to be
32:18
impossible because you can't
32:20
well it's so far away from my best
32:24
it's hard to imagine anyone what are you
32:26
on eight or nine seconds
32:28
look we had a very heavy night last
32:30
night
32:31
can i just just a little bit of trivia
32:33
about dondas which i quite like he's
32:35
apparently also known very well in the
32:37
world of dentistry as well as being an
32:38
ophthalmologist and a reaction time
32:40
experimenter because he named the space
32:42
between the dorsum the back of your
32:44
tongue and the hard palate so the gap
32:46
when you're at rest between the back of
32:48
your tongue and the roof of your mouth
32:50
is called the space of dondas cool just
32:53
name that that's very cool that's
32:54
awesome it's good to know um andy you
32:56
met uh you mentioned usain bolt a second
32:58
ago um i was looking into the sprinters
33:01
as well and uh there's an article
33:03
written by this guy who claims that
33:05
usain bolt could have broken his world
33:07
record speed times for the hundred
33:09
meters not by running faster he could
33:11
have run at the consistent time that he
33:13
was doing and still beat it it was his
33:15
starting point it was his reaction to
33:17
the gun he's famously has a slow start
33:20
doesn't he incredibly slow start so he
33:22
when he was in the beijing olympics he
33:24
was the slowest of all the finalists to
33:27
leave um what do you call it leave it
33:29
the starting blocks um so this guy
33:31
worked out that at beijing his starting
33:33
time his reaction was
33:35
0.165 if he was able to bring that down
33:38
to 0.13 he would have brought his world
33:40
record from 9.58 to 9.56 so he would
33:44
have shaved two milliseconds off that
33:46
and that's not even a hard one to get
33:48
that sort of your average finalist will
33:50
sprint at that speed of the starting
33:52
block and the reason is so if you go
33:53
online now if you're listening to this
33:55
and you try these games where it's like
33:57
you're look you're looking at it and it
33:59
changes color and you have to press the
34:01
button as quickly as you can
34:02
it's different to seeing things as to
34:04
hearing things i think you're quicker at
34:06
hearing things than you are at seeing
34:08
things i believe yes you are so your
34:10
audio um response time is usually lower
34:13
than your yeah that's true i know a
34:15
really weird thing about audio response
34:16
times so athletes who are closer to the
34:18
starting gun do better now that's partly
34:21
because you're closer
34:22
so you get an advantage of about 15
34:24
milliseconds in the closest lane
34:26
compared with all the other lanes on
34:27
average right wow that's quite a lot
34:30
but
34:31
there's another reason for this okay
34:32
sorry just say i thought they had um
34:35
they have speakers behind the blocks i
34:36
think you're right they now have
34:37
speakers behind the box so this was it
34:39
in races where you would have just one
34:41
gun at the side uh being fired but the
34:43
weird thing is it's not just that you're
34:44
closer it's that the louder you hear the
34:46
gunshot the faster your reaction time
34:49
the volume has an effect you react to
34:51
louder noises faster
34:52
is it because you're like scared of it i
34:54
think it must be because it's like
34:56
evolutionary things yeah yeah how cool
34:58
is that that's really cool you're right
34:59
otherwise they wouldn't have to do it
35:01
nearly as long so actually it's an
35:02
advantage in running a race if you have
35:04
a big ear trumpet which you carry next
35:05
to you on the starting blocks but do you
35:07
think that advantage is lessened by the
35:10
fact you have to carry your ear trumpet
35:11
well it never did me any harm on school
35:13
sports today
35:17
i was actually looking at sports because
35:18
i was thinking this thing about reaction
35:20
time is sort of based on iq so a lot of
35:23
people seem to think or that's very
35:24
contentious that reaction time is
35:26
related to iq or how smart you are so
35:28
the idea is that the victorians might
35:29
have been cleverer than us so i was
35:30
thinking sports people often have very
35:32
fast reactions if you're like a table
35:34
tennis player or something so i was
35:35
wondering if they were a cleverer and
35:36
this is a long-winded way of saying i
35:38
ended up finding out that marion bartoli
35:40
who was my favorite tennis player for a
35:41
while has an iq that is almost off the
35:43
chart so she has an iq of 175.
35:46
which as soon as you're over 140 then
35:48
you're very bright if you're over 160
35:50
you're proper genius and she's she's
35:52
there and she said um i'm not really
35:54
someone that's into telling people about
35:56
you know how smart i am i'm kind of
35:58
trying to hide it and that's what she
35:59
said to reporters
36:01
when she published her iq results
36:04
not that smart issue
36:06
there's a fly
36:08
which has the fastest reaction time i
36:10
think of any
36:11
um
36:12
animal so it's called the condylar
36:14
stylus fly and it's so fast that it's
36:16
almost impossible to take a photo of it
36:18
lying still
36:20
what do you mean so it has a startle
36:22
reflex of about two millimeters it's
36:23
scared of
36:24
cameras it's getting flat scared of the
36:26
flash so just do it without a flash well
36:29
yeah okay yeah
36:31
well that's this bit yeah on we go fine
36:35
it's got this reflex about two
36:36
milliseconds so if you take a photo with
36:38
a shutter speed of 1 200th of a second
36:40
which is a very fast shutter speed as
36:42
they go you will almost always capture
36:44
it in flight because that's 5
36:45
milliseconds so 9 out of 10 times you
36:47
take the picture you just get the flight
36:49
in movement you know how when you take a
36:51
photo of a lot of people there's always
36:52
someone with their eyes kind of half
36:54
closed yeah
36:55
these guys like
36:57
if they want a family photo of all these
36:59
flies
37:02
the chances of them all being there is
37:03
pretty low yeah and but so there's a
37:06
possible reason for it which is that
37:07
they're so brightly colored they're
37:08
really brightly colored flies and that
37:10
we think this is because they are trying
37:12
to teach predators not to bother trying
37:14
to hunt them
37:15
because they always get away so they're
37:17
trying to teach the predator to
37:18
associate that bright coloring on them
37:20
with don't even know no that doesn't
37:22
make any sense you wouldn't if you can
37:23
really get away that fast then you don't
37:25
need something that warns them that
37:27
sounds like they're bluffing
37:29
honestly don't worry about it it would
37:30
be a waste of effort but then again like
37:32
you get these really um poisonous frogs
37:35
don't you that are really brightly
37:37
coloured yeah they're terrible predators
37:38
yeah why are they all thinking in the
37:40
best interest of the predators
37:44
i mean it's sweet but
37:47
[Applause]
37:51
okay it is time for our final fact of
37:53
the show and that is andy my fact is
37:56
that the first people to live on the
37:57
moon might be cavemen
37:59
might be might be might not be yeah my
38:02
notes actually begin well they might
38:04
[Laughter]
38:06
so why might they because um
38:09
it's obviously going to be very
38:10
uncomfortable living on the moon no
38:12
one's going to have a great time but if
38:13
we want to get into space and colonize
38:15
somewhere the moon is not a terrible
38:17
candidate and a japanese space probe
38:19
called celine has just found a massive
38:21
cave on the moon which would solve a
38:23
load of the problems of living on the
38:25
moon um
38:26
it's 31 miles long it's 100 meters wide
38:29
so it's a huge cave we could get loads
38:31
of lunar cities in there if we wanted to
38:34
or 31 miles by 100 meters what did i say
38:37
sorry yeah no you said that i just think
38:39
you can't get that many cities
38:41
it's still going to be a bit cramped
38:42
it's going to be smaller london is like
38:44
what 40 miles in diameter i guess yeah
38:47
but like the m25 is about that because
38:48
you're just doing this
38:50
estate agent job here
38:53
it's very roomy lovely
38:55
you could put a partition wall in here
38:57
if you wanted to
38:59
um so they think it's a lava tube
39:01
created during volcanic activity and the
39:03
problem with living on the moon one of
39:04
many problems is
39:06
there are so many but the temperature is
39:08
107 degrees celsius in daytime and mine
39:11
is 153 celsius at night so any equipment
39:14
is going to have to deal with that which
39:15
is a real pain yeah and all the
39:17
radiation from space and all the
39:18
asteroids hitting you all the time yeah
39:20
so it's just not it's not a great place
39:22
to live but if you're in a cave you get
39:24
much less radiation
39:32
yeah it's because um so the moon has no
39:34
atmosphere obviously so the reason that
39:36
we're
39:37
done
39:38
[Laughter]
39:40
no you drew
39:41
all the reactions all that reaction time
39:42
practice you put in has paid off james
39:44
you're miles ahead of me
39:47
so the moon has no atmosphere um it's so
39:50
it's temperature fluctuates massively so
39:51
earth's temperature is quite stable
39:53
because the heat from the sun is
39:55
dispersed a bit by the air particles but
39:57
don't have that on the moon so the sun's
39:59
not on you then like you say your eyes
40:01
cold it's a nightmare but i don't really
40:02
understand this asteroid thing so
40:04
asteroids hit the moon far more often
40:06
they do make out like that's going to be
40:07
a big issue just little guys like little
40:09
asteroids that would kind of burn up
40:11
burn up in the earth's atmosphere oh the
40:13
little pebble yeah
40:15
but that would be quite awkward wouldn't
40:16
it like i know they're small but if
40:18
you're getting hit by the multiple times
40:20
it's so annoying yeah imagine well and
40:21
the damage they can do it's like with
40:23
the stuff that's going around our planet
40:25
if it if even a something the size of a
40:27
bullet hits uh the international space
40:29
station it could shatter it the speeds
40:31
that they're going at so yeah i mean a
40:32
bullet is traditionally a harmful thing
40:34
to be hit by as well yeah i don't know
40:40
um
40:41
one of the problems though if you live
40:43
inside one of these tubes is that the
40:44
moon constantly suffers from moonquakes
40:47
uh i think they believe that these lava
40:49
tubes can suffer huge internal damage
40:52
off the back of it collapse and so on
40:54
just with my estate agents hat on i'd
40:56
like to say this one's absolutely fine
40:58
previous tenants no complaints
41:00
[Laughter]
41:02
screaming from under the rubble
41:04
and cosmic radiation is a problem on the
41:07
moon and that's something that we're
41:08
trying to deal with so this is kind of
41:10
it gets hit by all sorts of stuff that
41:11
we've talked about before so the moon
41:13
gets caught in the solar wind the solar
41:15
tail sometimes and gets hit by all these
41:17
damaging particles and i think the lunar
41:20
reconnaissance orbiter which went up to
41:22
the moon from nasa a few years ago sent
41:25
a plastic replica of human skin which
41:27
measured how much damage this kind of
41:30
radiation will do wow and it worked out
41:32
that it is quite a bit of damage to
41:34
human bodies why would we not just send
41:36
up human skin
41:38
because i think human skin's not alive i
41:40
guess
41:42
did we send up a kendall
41:44
yes because that is the perfect replica
41:46
of the human plastic replica of human
41:48
skin yeah but then you want to see what
41:49
happens to genitals
41:51
oh that's true
41:53
which is important because it might make
41:54
you infertile if you have all this
41:56
radiation passing through you yeah yeah
41:58
um but a day on the moon is 14 earth
42:01
days and the night is 14 earth nights if
42:03
you're on the equator so it's just not
42:05
going to be fun isn't it nice long line
42:07
in the morning yeah that's true but then
42:09
a long day at work oh true
42:12
there's not that much work to do there i
42:13
don't think yet no but why would anyone
42:15
want to live on the moon like what is
42:16
the point
42:18
well i watched some interviews with
42:19
those people who were signed up for the
42:20
mars mission to go to mars and a lot of
42:23
them say things like i haven't really
42:25
been able to find a girlfriend so i
42:26
don't really see any points
42:32
nice to see you on the video link this
42:33
is janice she's a dead microbe but
42:36
she's mine and i love her she's a
42:38
plastic replica of human skin
42:42
i think it would be scientists right
42:44
it's like the same as antarctica no one
42:45
lives in antarctica apart from
42:46
scientists so it would be the same right
42:48
yes um but i read one article that said
42:50
um one of the advantages of going to the
42:52
moon is it might be so terrible that it
42:55
will force us to accept that the earth
42:57
is the only decent place to live and
42:58
will make us look after the earth better
43:00
that is a good argument the earth is so
43:02
much better than the moon
43:03
yeah well that's better at some things
43:06
name one thing the moon's better at
43:10
it's got better craters i think if
43:12
that's what you're into we've got
43:14
craters it's got better ones yeah it's
43:16
got bigger mountains yeah i'm not
43:17
booking my ticket just yet guys you guys
43:19
have turned into the travel agents
43:22
the sky is always black as well which i
43:24
don't think i would like just because i
43:26
guess we're not used to it but even in
43:27
daytime your 14 day day the sky's
43:30
totally black i think that's really
43:32
creepy because the the only reason this
43:33
guy's blue is because again of the
43:35
atmosphere
43:36
and so i can't even conceive of total
43:39
broad daylight but with the black sky no
43:40
that doesn't make anything it doesn't
43:42
work i might not be right because it's
43:44
bright but it's dark it's bright but
43:45
it's black that's i think that can't be
43:47
true that's weird it's true
43:50
you can't compute it but it's the case
43:52
because what other i mean what the color
43:54
is it going to be no i do believe you
43:55
have it
43:56
but it's just it's too much for my brain
43:58
to manage
43:59
do you know what the main problem would
44:00
be if we i mean sorry we've just been
44:02
through about 15 of the main problems
44:04
but according to eugene cernan who's the
44:07
last man to walk on the moon um the main
44:09
problem would be the dust they spent
44:11
most of their time dusting on that last
44:13
mission to the moon yeah because they um
44:15
they had like a um vacuum cleaner to get
44:18
all the dust off their stuff and it
44:19
clogged up the black vacuum really yeah
44:22
um but you know what the main problem is
44:23
[Laughter]
44:25
so sports are going to be very difficult
44:28
yeah and the reason is like you can jump
44:30
and throw balls much better um this is
44:32
according to an article on space.com um
44:34
so you can throw a ball maybe like ten
44:37
six times higher or six times further
44:39
but that means that your american
44:40
football field which is what they were
44:41
talking about would have to be 600 yards
44:43
long and so you need that space yeah
44:46
yeah that's true you don't have the
44:47
space because it's a small like planet
44:49
tennis will be quite crap as well
44:51
because
44:53
uh topspin doesn't work
44:55
so all the best like nadal's game is
44:57
going to go completely to pot because
44:59
the reason topspin works is because of
45:01
the it's the bennui effect that i think
45:03
we've mentioned before it's about how
45:04
air pressure acts differently on one
45:05
side of a spinning ball to the other and
45:07
so that means that topspin brings the
45:10
ball down into the court faster than it
45:11
would otherwise go because of this
45:13
effect and with no atmosphere on the
45:15
moon again
45:16
you're not having toxin working so all
45:17
of them dial shots go out what about
45:19
cricket
45:20
is this possibly the one place where we
45:21
can ascertain we're gonna have a fair
45:22
cricket match
45:24
because there's no australians
45:29
and by the way guys our brisbane date
45:31
has really not solved so far we don't
45:32
know why
45:34
um but mariam bartoli might be able to
45:37
work it out before anyone else that's
45:39
what i'm thinking because she's so smart
45:40
you're right like she would
45:42
be able to work out the trajectories and
45:44
stuff the perfect way to hit i'm
45:45
actually interested in going to the moon
45:46
a bit more now that we know that topspin
45:48
doesn't work because it just levels that
45:49
playing field
45:50
[Laughter]
45:51
a little bit
45:53
um
45:54
so there was a guy in 1964 who uh made a
45:57
bet he was a british man called david
45:59
thrillful and you remember president
46:01
kennedy promised in about 1961 we're
46:03
going to get to the moon by the end of
46:04
the decades yeah and they squeaked in in
46:06
1969. um he bet in 1964
46:10
that uh man would get to the moon before
46:13
the end of the decade and william hill
46:14
gave mods of a thousand to one but they
46:16
did take the bet and
46:18
when they landed on the moon he was
46:20
taken to a tv studio and he became a
46:21
minor celebrity he was presented with a
46:23
check for a thousand pounds which was a
46:24
lot of money at the time yeah it's about
46:26
180 000 pounds in today's money and the
46:28
really tragic thing was he died the next
46:31
year in a crash of the car that he
46:33
bought with the winnings no
46:34
yeah oh that's awful
46:38
oh thank you for telling us
46:43
i looked into if you move to the moon um
46:45
there's a lot of stuff that is left
46:47
there by previous missions that you can
46:49
collect to make your house a bit more
46:51
interesting
46:53
so i was just not interested enough that
46:55
you're the only person living on the
46:56
moon
46:57
oh yeah i need to have a space some
46:59
boots
47:00
some bagged up for you
47:02
um
47:03
well come around to my house you can
47:04
have bagged up features in your own home
47:07
very easy you've got a baby you should
47:09
know all about bacteria
47:10
my house is at the moment um there's
47:14
some andy wool warhol art up on the moon
47:17
oh wow
47:18
yeah there's a and balls that he
47:19
drew he drew a and balls he paraded
47:21
it as his as his initials and a and a w
47:24
artistically done the w was upside down
47:26
and the and the a really that sounds
47:28
like an eminent a and it's what it looks
47:30
like as well yeah silly yeah extremely
47:32
confusing it's andy murray's painting
47:36
[Laughter]
47:43
you're right yeah so that's how it's
47:45
comes and that's why i thought it looked
47:46
like an m but he's a right no you've
47:48
just you've been having that
47:50
work of art upside down i've been
47:51
looking at it upside down you've hung it
47:52
wrong it's badly hung
48:00
yeah so this was uh this was a kind of
48:02
it was a mini little piece of art where
48:04
six different artists uh contributed to
48:06
it andy warhol was one of them and it
48:08
was put on this wafer small size little
48:10
thing that was meant to be taken up uh
48:12
but nasa disagreed what's next
48:16
why are you drawing more coffee well
48:17
i've just worked out my name is andrew
48:19
murray and look at that that's an a and
48:20
an m and it also looks like i think i've
48:23
got a new signature
48:25
for the next book my driving license
48:27
people are going to be so happy
48:32
put that down andy go on down yeah so uh
48:37
so uh they
48:38
they submitted it as wanting to take it
48:41
to the moon but it was rejected but it
48:42
was actually smuggled up there uh a lot
48:45
of smuggling happened yeah uh in the
48:47
early days like buzz aldrin i think
48:49
smuggled up the communion that he
48:51
brought up to the moon and so on people
48:53
did like to smuggle stuff so you can get
48:54
communion only communion
48:57
you're right yeah very nice so andy
49:00
warholar is up there there's also
49:02
a feather from a falcon up there cool
49:05
just a single feather which is really
49:07
cool it was done as part of an
49:09
experiment um oh yeah i remember that
49:11
yeah the apollo 12 experiment what they
49:13
wanted to do was recreate the idea of
49:15
seeing whether or not the idea of a
49:16
bowling ball and what was it galileo um
49:20
supposedly dropped two um bowls from the
49:23
uh
49:24
leading tariff leaning tower of pisa
49:26
yeah and they landed at the same time
49:28
because it's independent of mass and
49:30
they tried it with the bowling ball and
49:32
the feather and proved that it was true
49:34
yeah a hammer and a feather on the moon
49:36
yeah i need to take a it's yeah if the
49:38
most powerful rocket can only take three
49:39
men and a bit of kit to the moon taking
49:41
a bowling ball seems like a needless
49:42
examination
49:45
yeah it was the air force academy's
49:47
falcon mascot they have a mascots and
49:49
they plucked off one of its feathers and
49:51
that still is on the moon so that could
49:52
be part of your house just to be clear
49:53
is that because there's no air
49:55
resistance because obviously if you drop
49:56
a hammer and a feather the feather will
49:57
float down because of their resistance
49:59
on earth it would yeah but on the moon
50:00
they drop at the same time
50:02
yeah very cool um i was just looking at
50:05
you know things that we'd have to train
50:06
to learn to do when we get to the moon
50:08
and i don't think we've mentioned before
50:10
that all astronauts at the moment who go
50:12
into space have to do toilet training so
50:14
you have to be re-toilet trained really
50:17
have we talked about this no
50:19
because i didn't know that so
50:21
they've forgotten how to do it it makes
50:23
you forget how to urinate yeah no it's
50:25
so nasty you can't have the same design
50:27
lose in space because um stuff might
50:29
kind of get out of them so when you sit
50:30
on the loo it's a very very small
50:32
aperture that you have to aim your stuff
50:35
into so um the opening of a toilet in
50:37
space is four inches wide and usually
50:39
i'll lose 18 inches wide like 15 to 18
50:42
inches wide that's not four inches andy
50:44
[Laughter]
50:46
oh i thought it was
50:50
a disappointing day all around
50:54
but no you've got so nasa has a
50:56
specially designed toilet training room
50:58
it's at the johnson space center in
51:00
houston and it's actually got two
51:01
different toilets in it so in this room
51:04
it's got a positional toilet and that's
51:06
not functional that's just so you learn
51:07
how to position yourself properly on the
51:09
toilet and actually oh no
51:11
i'm sure some trainee astronauts have
51:13
mistaken the positional one where you're
51:15
just practicing for the functionality
51:17
when you go at the showroom the bathroom
51:19
showroom
51:24
that's a comedy trope isn't it is it
51:26
that's why you got kicked out of ikea
51:28
that time
51:30
um so yeah you've got the show toilet
51:31
and that tests your aim and it's got a
51:33
little camera inside it that looks up at
51:34
you so you can then review the footage
51:36
afterwards to check that you've aimed
51:38
right and then when you're ready for it
51:40
you can transition onto the actual
51:41
functional toilet which is also in the
51:43
training room where you can practice how
51:44
to flush and disturb okay i have a
51:46
question are there any astronauts who
51:48
have aced every single other metric but
51:51
just haven't been allowed to go to space
51:55
it always ends up on the floor i don't
51:57
know
51:58
it must be right like if you can't do
52:00
that that's true you have to do it you
52:02
have to that's one of them actually
52:03
that's probably one of the more
52:04
important things to get right in
52:06
uh
52:07
flying the rocket is quite important
52:09
come on they pretty they've probably got
52:11
autopilot stuff today but if you've got
52:13
a cabin full of poo floating around
52:15
that is houston we have a big problem
52:22
okay that's it that is all of our facts
52:24
thank you so much for listening if you'd
52:25
like to get in contact with any of us
52:27
about the things that we have said over
52:28

hello and welcome to another episode of
00:17
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:20
coming to you from the qy offices in
00:22
covent garden my name is dan schreiber
00:24
and i'm sitting here with anna chazinski
00:27
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
00:29
and once again we have gathered around
00:31
the microphones with our four favorite
00:33
facts from the last seven days and in no
00:35
particular order here we go
00:38
starting with you jacinski
00:40
my fact this week is that in singapore
00:42
pet fish have plastic surgeons
00:45
so do they do they get a trout pout
00:48
hey
00:51
does anyone know that phrase no i do
00:53
know that it's when you put a load of
00:54
stuff in your lips yes for having
00:55
fillers in your lips you get what is
00:57
called a trout pout so it's actually a
00:59
clever joke so tell us about these fish
01:01
hannah oh um so
01:04
a great start
01:06
so what do you have done if you're a
01:07
fish well you don't you first start you
01:08
don't have a trout pout because this is
01:10
what is a specific kind of fish and it's
01:12
the arowana fish which isn't a trout
01:14
it's but actually humans aren't trouts
01:16
either and we have trout pets it's
01:18
weirder for us to get the out than
01:19
it is for the fish
01:21
all right this fish is slightly closer
01:22
to a trout than a human but nonetheless
01:24
the arowana fish is a very prized fish
01:27
as a pet in china and in other asian
01:29
countries and including singapore and i
01:32
read this article in the new york times
01:33
which sort of profiled this guy called
01:35
eugene ung who is one of the premier
01:38
cosmetic surgeons for asian fish in
01:40
singapore he was described as and yeah
01:42
he does them up you get lots of things
01:44
done so they often get their eyelids
01:46
raised they've got droopy eyelids
01:48
they'll go into their eyelids and he'll
01:49
take some of the tissue out and budge
01:50
their eyeball further up into the socket
01:54
yeah it's it's a very exciting industry
01:56
it's amazing and he runs a fish shop
01:58
doesn't he like a pet shop where you
01:59
just buy them so this is a guy who's
02:01
either behind the counter selling you a
02:02
goldfish or then going behind the scenes
02:04
and cutting them up what's the aim
02:07
what's the empty is it to make them look
02:08
more attractive humans if he's selling
02:10
them he's making them look better yeah i
02:13
think he's gonna sell them for more or
02:14
sell more of them he he says in in this
02:17
article that anna read he says i know
02:18
some people think it's cruel to the fish
02:20
but really i'm doing it a favor because
02:22
now because now the fish looks better
02:24
and the owner will love it even more do
02:26
you know it's really weird to quote an
02:28
article as an article that x read when x
02:31
isn't you because you you've read the
02:33
article as well presumably if you're
02:35
quoting i think he's only read this
02:36
paragraph
02:38
i just read quotes it makes it sound
02:40
like i've just sent you a few choice
02:41
quotes for the podcast i have to say it
02:43
is an extremely weird custom though it's
02:45
extremely weird and i should say the
02:47
person who sent me this was lauren who's
02:49
one of the other elves i only remember
02:50
that this morning so she emailed this
02:51
amazing article to me do you know what
02:53
happens when you're a fish having an
02:54
operation what they do is they get
02:57
anesthetic water and they put the fish
02:59
in a in a bowl or a tank of anesthetic
03:01
water to knock it out and then they pull
03:03
it out of the tank they put it on the
03:04
slab to operate on it and then you have
03:06
to have one person on either side
03:08
pushing syringes of water over the gills
03:11
so it keeps breathing nicely and then
03:13
you have to have a third person who's
03:14
refilling the syringes for the people
03:16
who are blasting the fish so it's a
03:18
massive operation and then you have to
03:20
have the surgeon well i i read that it's
03:22
not even just it's not the anesthetic
03:23
water uh that you need for it so i was
03:25
reading about a goldfish called george
03:27
who had a brain tumor and he was being
03:29
operated on and george uh when he was
03:32
being what he was under they took actual
03:34
buckets of water from the pond that he
03:36
was from so that it would be the natural
03:38
water that he was accustomed to and that
03:39
was being splashed over his gills the
03:41
whole time as well there's a fish which
03:42
received a glass eye
03:45
to stop other fish bullying it
03:47
oh were they bullying it yeah they were
03:49
attacking it in the water because it was
03:50
a sign of weakness
03:51
yeah that's what happens george george
03:53
was being bullied
03:55
having a brain tumor yeah fish could be
03:57
so cruel
03:58
but don't you think you need to they're
04:00
kind of
04:01
right if you've got bullies you don't
04:03
deal with it by fixing the problem with
04:05
the person who's being bullied
04:07
you speak to the bullies themselves and
04:09
get them to change them you speak to the
04:10
bully's parents ideally exactly but what
04:12
you're doing basically is just saying
04:14
that they're right to volume almost
04:15
that's true yeah and it's silly this
04:17
ideal of the perfect looking fish we've
04:20
raised up and we've tried to make
04:22
everyone want to look like that if you
04:23
want to have droopy eyelids i think you
04:25
should be allowed to have droopy eyelids
04:26
and they're being made to feel like they
04:28
can't i agree and because they were
04:29
saying that these owners are going to
04:31
love the fish even more because they're
04:32
beautiful i mean that is pretty shallow
04:35
yeah it is you shouldn't yeah and the
04:36
worst thing if you're a fish is
04:38
shallowness
04:42
fish's greatest fear
04:44
these arowanas they are so
04:47
they're amazing they're amazing they're
04:48
the best fish
04:49
they even the droopy eyelid ones they're
04:51
so good so the people are obsessed with
04:54
them
04:54
there's one guy in the article that anna
04:56
read and that dan selectively read uh he
04:59
was
05:01
he was interviewed uh he's called
05:02
nicholas cheer and he has a fish tank
05:04
which covers a third of his living room
05:05
that is a big proportion but he said
05:07
sometimes my wife complains that i
05:09
neglect the children because of the fish
05:11
to a certain extent yes i guess that's
05:13
true
05:15
but actually back in the 1970s they
05:17
weren't very popular at all right and
05:19
what happened was they were just an
05:20
ordinary fish that you would eat for
05:22
food but actually they weren't even that
05:23
tasty so people didn't really eat them
05:25
much but the thing is it's an apex
05:27
predator it's slow reproducing so the
05:29
populations of it are very small and so
05:32
it ended up on the list of protected
05:33
species
05:35
and that backfired because they became
05:36
so rare that everyone wanted them yeah
05:39
it's such a good example of how trends
05:41
happen it always happens in history
05:42
doesn't it as soon as something becomes
05:44
rare like lobster used to be common and
05:46
peasant food and then suddenly it's
05:48
rarer and it's a prized commodity and i
05:51
think they've sort of back justified it
05:52
now and said that they look a bit like
05:54
dragon so they're called long u which is
05:56
dragon fish in china and it's because
05:58
they have these kind of whiskers that i
06:00
guess dragons also have whiskers and
06:02
also they kind of swim up and down don't
06:04
they like an eel but it's like one of
06:06
those dragons in the new year carnival
06:08
yeah and they're very aggressive
06:10
which dragons i guess are sometimes yeah
06:12
they're really aggressive and they've
06:13
got terrible bites right so they're on
06:15
the side of virtually every porcelain
06:18
bowl that i would have eaten from as a
06:20
child
06:20
yeah it's a it's that is a classic fish
06:22
that you would have drawn on the side of
06:24
a of a bowl
06:26
yeah and they've got like glittery
06:27
sparkly scales haven't they and they get
06:29
and they really focus on how to make
06:31
them more attractive not only with the
06:33
plastic surgery but they're often placed
06:35
under neon pink tanning lights and it's
06:37
because they've got like a reddish hue
06:38
and if you put them under the tanning
06:39
lights they can go really pink and they
06:42
look nicer
06:43
doesn't sound healthy
06:45
they're growing the amazon don't they as
06:46
well there are silver arowana fish in
06:48
the amazon and they jump out of the
06:49
water to catch prey so some of them have
06:52
been found with birds or bats in their
06:54
stomach wow after their death this is
06:55
the cool thing though some people
06:57
believe
06:58
that arowana fish will jump out of the
07:00
fish tank to sacrifice their lives to
07:02
warn owners about a bad business
07:04
investment
07:05
so just as you're picking up the phone
07:06
and thinking i think i'm going to buy
07:07
some of that stock today the fish will
07:09
smash out of the water
07:12
that doesn't sound very true does it it
07:13
doesn't sound very true i would like to
07:14
go in a business deal with a person who
07:16
believes that
07:19
the you were saying the silver marijuana
07:21
jumps out and eats bats the golden
07:22
arowana apparently
07:25
it has been said jumps out of the water
07:27
and grabs small monkeys from overhanging
07:30
branches
07:31
and eats the monkeys
07:33
yeah they'll take anything snakes any
07:35
kind of small mammals and i watch this
07:37
really horrible video because a lot of
07:39
this information comes from this book
07:40
that sounds amazing which is a woman
07:42
called emily voigt wrote a book called
07:44
the dragon behind the glass and she
07:45
obviously got really obsessed with these
07:46
fish and there's one line in her book
07:49
where she says whatever you do don't
07:51
look up youtube videos of arowana fish
07:53
dragging duckling underwater and what
07:55
did you do well i obviously did that
07:58
i honestly thought i might find it quite
08:00
entertaining in a way and it was just
08:01
extremely unpleasant so i know
08:02
everyone's going to now do this at home
08:04
but honestly don't look up
08:06
what are you doing here
08:08
it's like the movie the ring isn't it
08:13
uh just in china i was reading about
08:15
goldfish goldfish meant to be yellow
08:17
fish
08:18
really
08:19
uh it's a breeding process that means
08:21
that we have the more orangey color this
08:23
is a result of the song dynasty in the
08:25
song dynasty yellow was the color of the
08:28
royal family and so the empress uh
08:31
forbade anyone from having yellow fish
08:34
if they were non-royal because it would
08:35
be a signal of having a posh fish
08:38
so they all had to go for the more
08:39
orangey type and that that was sort of
08:41
bread and bread and bread and that
08:42
became the one that had sort of mutated
08:44
into yeah the one that we know today but
08:46
i remember reading once and i don't know
08:48
if this is true that if you get a
08:49
goldfish and just put it in the river
08:50
then it loses its goldness and it just
08:52
becomes a fish really
08:55
they're not gold anyway are they they're
08:56
orange yeah it's a very different color
08:57
to gold yeah
08:59
it's not very different
09:01
oh well i've got a ring that you might
09:02
want to find
09:05
a fish in the background out don't do it
09:10
um just uh because this is a fact about
09:13
surgery on your pets we've never
09:15
mentioned nuticles before
09:17
as a concept but this is it's estimated
09:20
that 500 000 dogs have had neutrals
09:23
attached and these are fake testicles
09:26
because when they get their their real
09:28
testicles chopped off they get very
09:30
self-conscious and they get bullied by
09:32
their friends and so they get neutrals
09:34
surgically attached testicular implants
09:36
um
09:37
they're really good actually they're the
09:39
dog's bollocks
09:40
yeah very nice james and i've helped
09:42
what yeah sorry did you say you and
09:44
james have got them no we we've held one
09:47
oh sorry yeah
09:48
i was getting very badly bullied at the
09:50
office
09:52
because they won a nickname exactly mark
09:54
abrams of ignoble he was downstairs in
09:56
the office with us and he pulled a
09:58
dog's testicle out plastic can you get a
10:00
range of sizes because obviously dogs
10:02
have different sized testicles don't
10:03
they as in chihuahuas won't have the
10:04
same size as great dane testicles right
10:06
now but it would be it would be very
10:08
funny to fit a trial with great dane
10:10
muticles yeah and vice versa actually
10:12
yes it would be like a space hopper
10:14
wouldn't it
10:16
at that point two space hoppers yeah
10:19
you say 500 000 dogs yeah that's huge
10:21
half a million dollars but they get lots
10:23
of plastic surgery they get tummy tucks
10:25
that's apparently quite common now and
10:27
also um
10:28
botox to perk to like perk up their
10:31
faces because you know those pug dogs
10:32
with really saggy skin have become
10:34
really popular isn't that the point of a
10:36
pug no but they would a pug look like
10:37
with an entirely smooth face it looked
10:39
nightmare but they've been bred into the
10:41
roswell alien something
10:45
they've been bred into not being able to
10:46
breathe right that's the yeah as in
10:48
they're so they're just helping them
10:50
i'm not saying the answer is more
10:51
intervention though is it
10:53
no this is what humans do we make
10:54
enormous mistakes and then we make other
10:56
enormous mistakes to counteract the
10:58
enormous mistakes we originally made why
11:00
couldn't we have left the dogs alone in
11:01
the first place
11:03
um i just this is uh i was looking into
11:06
weird surgeries as well um and i left
11:08
the animal uh proper dog and fish animal
11:11
world and went to the human animal world
11:12
um so just very quickly this is off
11:14
topic but um you know you can get
11:16
holiday boobs now
11:17
holiday breasts no right it's very this
11:20
is an interesting thing that's been
11:21
happening in america in new york there's
11:23
a plastic surgeon who's created a thing
11:24
called the insta breast and what it is
11:26
is rather than giving you actual breast
11:28
surgery um he gives you this sort of
11:31
saline injection which makes you have
11:33
enhanced boobs for 24 hours and then it
11:36
goes away the the saline just sort of
11:38
disappears and he's now developed and
11:40
they're still running tests on it ones
11:42
that you can use that will last two to
11:44
three weeks for the time of a holiday so
11:46
you go away you have your boobs done up
11:48
and then by the time you get back they
11:50
sort of go back to what they were before
11:52
that's not really weird yeah yeah i
11:54
don't think that's going to catch on why
11:56
don't you what he says is it's up for a
11:58
lot of people who want to test the idea
12:00
of having uh breast implants rather than
12:02
having to do it and often what they do
12:04
is 3d models and so on so what it is
12:06
it's just a quick sort of go for a day
12:08
of going actually i like this side you
12:09
do it when you're on holiday so that
12:11
your people at work don't see you
12:13
looking like that it's like if you try
12:14
and grow a beard you go on holiday for
12:16
two weeks and you're like oh maybe i
12:17
won't shave to see what i look like
12:20
and then you always shave before you
12:21
come back because you look like an idiot
12:24
is this man offering a holiday penis yet
12:27
or holiday testicles which are larger
12:31
for the beach
12:32
for bouncing around the beach
12:37
[Applause]
12:37
[Music]
12:41
okay it is time for fact number two and
12:43
that is my fact my fact this week is
12:45
that according to scientists you're more
12:47
likely to win the tour de france if you
12:49
are good looking
12:51
hmm yeah
12:52
yeah this is a this is a is it because
12:55
you are more streamlined with your
12:56
cheekbones looking all nice like that
12:58
because your cheekbones would be
12:59
sticking out a bit more wouldn't they if
13:01
you had a really thin face with no
13:03
cheekbones then actually you would be
13:04
much more well that is my idea of beauty
13:07
james actually it's an extremely long
13:09
nose
13:10
yeah a head that's basically
13:12
an arrow an arrowhead
13:14
it's my idea of beauty and no one can
13:16
tell me off for it well this study it's
13:19
like an average thing right they asked
13:20
loads of people so you would be an
13:22
outlier in this case okay yeah this was
13:24
done by uh dr eric postma this was at
13:27
the institute of evolutionary biology in
13:30
zurich it's the university of zurich and
13:32
um he asked 800 participants to score
13:35
the cyclist's attractiveness based on
13:37
their facial appearances if the person
13:40
recognized who the cyclist was like a
13:42
lance armstrong or bradley wiggins they
13:43
disqualified that so it had to be people
13:45
they didn't know um they used 80
13:47
professional cyclists that they picked
13:49
from and uh it was from the 2012 tour de
13:52
france uh that they used the sample from
13:54
and the results showed that the top 10
13:56
of performers were rated on an average
13:58
of 25 better looking than the
14:01
if that makes sense oh so better
14:03
cyclists are more good-looking even so
14:05
within the professional cyclists the
14:07
better ones
14:08
yes it's only in professional cyclists i
14:10
think right so we don't know if cyclists
14:12
are more attractive than normal people
14:14
they might all be much uglier than have
14:16
you ever seen a professional cyclist why
14:18
do you think they cover themselves with
14:19
helmets and sunglasses and things like
14:21
that exactly they're um they're quite
14:23
unusual looking like it might be you
14:25
know it might be your thing and i don't
14:27
know
14:28
they usually have very big heads and
14:29
very tiny bodies
14:31
and but quite muscular legs they're
14:33
unusual looking as well right yeah yeah
14:36
team sky when this happened in 2012 they
14:39
all had to wear
14:40
sunglasses in all the photos
14:43
and these were the photos that they used
14:45
and in that year bradley wiggins won the
14:47
tour de france and
14:48
i think did pretty well in it but they
14:50
couldn't use any of the pictures for
14:52
this study because they were wearing
14:54
sunglasses
14:55
so actually the winner of the tour de
14:56
france in this study bradley wiggins was
14:58
not part of the most attractive people
15:01
are they wearing the sunglasses to
15:02
disguise the dilated pupils from all the
15:05
doping they're doing
15:07
i don't think sir bradley wiggins has
15:09
ever been found guilty okay
15:14
um
15:15
on doping so i didn't know how ingrained
15:18
the history was in cycling but
15:20
um
15:20
this is in the very early days of the
15:22
tour de france two brothers who were
15:23
cycling in it they boasted to a
15:25
journalist and i'm quoting here directly
15:27
they said we've got cocaine to go in our
15:29
eyes chloroform for our gums and do you
15:31
want to see the pills and i don't think
15:33
it was banned back then no it wasn't bad
15:35
until the 60s i don't think yeah 50s or
15:37
16. so it was a very exciting time
15:39
otherwise that was an incredibly stupid
15:40
thing to say to a journalist wasn't it
15:44
like you've taken a lot of cocaine you
15:46
do talk a lot and you talk about
15:48
yourself don't you why do i think i'm
15:50
doing so well let me tell you this
15:55
riders were fine for being pushed along
15:57
by spectators
15:58
you would get a clandestine push along
16:00
as you went along and i can't imagine
16:01
that did you do a huge amount of good
16:02
unless they ran with you pushing you for
16:04
a bit yeah you kept pushing in the top
16:06
of france now just
16:07
supportive so not by the crowd normally
16:10
so let's say your bicycle breaks and you
16:12
need to get a new one but you're on an
16:14
uphill bit then your mechanic will give
16:16
you a push up the hill while you're
16:17
going is that allowed it's kind of
16:19
allowed yeah as long as you don't do it
16:21
too much okay the other one is well like
16:22
you might be getting a drink from the
16:24
car yeah and they will hand you the
16:26
drink and they'll hold on to it for like
16:28
10 seconds so they're pulling you along
16:30
on the car and then you take it off them
16:32
that's so funny in every race
16:34
they have sort of a second limit don't
16:36
they on when you really had to have to
16:37
let go now
16:39
just on the topic of um drugs being not
16:41
a cheating so even though you weren't
16:42
sort of disqualified uh for doing drugs
16:45
um there was a lot of cheating that
16:46
happened right on the very first tour de
16:48
france that ever happened uh
16:50
so there was the favorite who was who
16:53
was said to be the greatest cyclist who
16:54
was going to win whose name i just can't
16:56
pronounce so i'm going to pretend we're
16:57
mates i'm just going to call him the
16:58
nickname hippo um he actually had to bow
17:02
out halfway through the very first one
17:03
because he drank some lemonade from a
17:05
crowd member uh had a sip and then he
17:07
had this huge indigestion huge stomach
17:09
problems and thought he was poisoned no
17:11
one believed him and they thought he was
17:12
just a bit weak and he wasn't as good as
17:14
he was and it wasn't for years later
17:16
that they actually traced it down and
17:18
worked out it was in fact a spiked bit
17:20
of lemonade um and so he how would you
17:22
work that out i know evidence must have
17:24
gone by that i know i i have no idea
17:27
maybe 80 years later this lemonade's
17:29
really gone
17:35
this was the very first one so this was
17:36
in 1903 but then he came back in 1904
17:40
and he then himself then became the
17:42
cheetah because what he did was he was
17:45
being towed by a car
17:47
by using a sort of invisible string
17:50
attached to a cork no he had the cork in
17:52
between his teeth why his teeth why
17:54
don't i just hold the cork
17:57
he was pulled by the mouth towed by the
18:00
mouth and uh he was caught but in that
18:01
race a total of 29 people i think were
18:04
disqualified largely for illegal use of
18:06
cars and frames
18:08
they kept on and even the guy the four
18:11
people who came first second third and
18:12
fourth were disqualified and so the guy
18:14
who was fifth henry cornett ended up
18:17
winning but even he had used a car for a
18:19
bit of it he got a warning but it's like
18:21
he didn't use the car as badly as the
18:23
others but there was another guy who and
18:26
one of the main guys there was some
18:27
contaminated food that he was given
18:29
which was a chicken leg containing a
18:31
sleeping pill uh and that meant that he
18:34
fell off his bike because he fell asleep
18:36
on his bike no wow
18:39
there was a thing about how badly all
18:40
the teams behaved during the early tours
18:43
so this is from a book called tour de
18:45
france a cultural history by christopher
18:47
thompson i've read a bit of it it's very
18:49
good very funny in the 1920s hotels
18:52
complained that cyclists were using
18:53
curtains in their rooms to wipe vaseline
18:56
off themselves after massages and they
18:58
were just horribly behaved all the way
19:00
around the tour are you not allowed to
19:01
do that if you're in a hotel what using
19:03
the curtains to wipe vaseline off
19:04
yourself
19:05
don't have towels
19:07
uh they just do it to be rock and roll
19:10
what a weird way to do rock and roll i
19:12
don't know why i'm sure we throw this tv
19:14
out there no no i can't get a grip on it
19:20
so it hasn't been invented yet
19:25
um but they kept stealing things as well
19:27
as they would cycle through towns they
19:28
would just swipe glasses of wine and
19:30
baguettes off tables as they went so all
19:32
the pubs would close um whenever the
19:34
tour was coming through the pubs would
19:35
close because they knew that the tour
19:37
would just everyone get off the bike at
19:38
the same time run in steal all the wine
19:40
and then go off again
19:42
well the guy yeah the guy who won the
19:44
second uh the second tour de france
19:47
maurice garin who himself was then
19:49
caught for cheating he was also part of
19:51
the cheating he was doing things like
19:52
putting itching powder down the trousers
19:53
of other contestants
19:56
i like that kind of cheese yeah like if
19:58
they did that kind of cheating these
19:59
days rather than injecting steroids and
20:01
stuff i think that'd be more fun yeah
20:03
definitely like whoopee cushions and you
20:06
know like it doesn't slow you down
20:07
though we'll be caution on a bike but
20:08
the worst that happens is a bit of a
20:10
fart as you set off which will probably
20:11
help you actually if the cushion is the
20:13
right way around i would put the cushion
20:15
the other way oh yes it blasts you back
20:17
down the mountain yeah i see you had a
20:20
very powerful whoopee cushion i i would
20:22
just suggest upturned nails on the on
20:24
the roads that's harsh though what about
20:26
covering an entire road in those plastic
20:27
dirty fire days so the cyclist has to go
20:29
around the mall what's a dirty finder oh
20:31
come on a bad dog a fake plastic dog poo
20:35
yeah i'm thinking purely of smithy's
20:37
joke shop level pranks that you can put
20:40
all of those right is the smiffy's joke
20:42
shop like you can put like a little hand
20:44
buzzer on the handlebars
20:46
oh like the guy at the lead's got like a
20:48
fake black eye because he's
20:50
flattened a telescope
20:55
the old classic offer have some gum no
20:57
it's a mousetrap yeah he won't be
20:58
cycling for hours after that
21:00
this sore finger
21:04
this is the way to get people watching
21:05
the tour de france again right this is
21:07
doping people can get on board with oh
21:09
and i see the rest of the pillars sort
21:10
of cycled into the crudely drawn on
21:12
tunnel on the side of the road
21:19
you were in the middle of saying
21:20
something dan oh yeah uh
21:23
yeah um it was about maurice's powder
21:26
that's right no he was the guy who was
21:28
beaten up was that yeah really okay yeah
21:31
so um he uh he
21:33
uh not in the tour de france but he once
21:35
won a 24-hour race um and he credited
21:38
the win to this amount of stuff that he
21:39
was eating and drinking along the way so
21:41
we were talking about the fact they
21:42
would stop off and drink wine and steal
21:43
baguettes and stuff like that the list
21:45
that he said that he ate and drank
21:47
during that 24-hour race was he had lots
21:49
of red wine eight cooked eggs 19 liters
21:52
of hot chocolate a mixture of coffee and
21:54
champagne two kilograms of rice seven
21:56
liters of tea 45 chicken cutlets and
21:59
oysters 45 chicken cups according to
22:02
we're still stuck with 19 liters of hot
22:04
chocolate wait well that's in how long
22:06
24 hours that was a 24 hour race that he
22:09
did yeah 19 liters no
22:12
yeah there's not time and also you have
22:14
to leave hot chocolate for about 12
22:15
minutes to cool down
22:17
so you don't burn your mouth that's true
22:19
yeah i don't know they do drink
22:21
chocolate milk in the tour de france now
22:24
all of the teams do that it's amazing i
22:25
occasionally go cycling and chocolate
22:27
milk it just it just goes straight to
22:29
your legs yeah it's like when popeye has
22:31
a spinach oh cool that would have been a
22:33
very bad health message though
22:36
so another thing he used to do was smoke
22:38
cigarettes and that's what a lot of the
22:40
cyclists used to do as well you can see
22:41
these great photos was it like an
22:43
exploding cigar
22:47
what they used to do was as they were
22:49
approaching a massive hill if they were
22:50
in a group and they were with their team
22:52
they would all light up a cigarette or a
22:53
light one up and pass it round so you
22:55
can see photos are showing what they
22:56
thought was is that it was opening up
22:58
your lungs so that you could um
23:00
climb the hill well that's better really
23:02
not what happens
23:04
the opposite although the smoke could
23:06
obscure the vision of the people behind
23:08
it true working away yeah i like there's
23:11
a guy called bernard
23:12
well it's clearly a french guy so it's
23:14
probably something like bernard
23:16
but i'm going to say bernard hinnolt um
23:18
and he was cycling winning in the 80s
23:21
and he had a champagne before he cycled
23:23
up the last hill and won which i i quite
23:24
like the people were still doing it up
23:26
until actually i think these days
23:28
i have a memory of um the winners kind
23:31
of going down in paris having a glass of
23:34
champagne i think happen because the
23:36
final race is usually a bit of a
23:37
procession if you're winning in the
23:40
penultimate race they will never
23:42
overtake you in the last race it's
23:43
always like just a kind of a procession
23:45
into paris okay so i'm pretty sure they
23:47
have gone with champagne
23:50
fair enough can you explain this then
23:52
james because you do know it well so
23:54
apparently there's a gentleman's
23:56
agreement in the tour de france that you
23:58
can take pause pippi which are basically
24:00
potty breaks to stop have we get back on
24:03
your bike and the other people who are
24:05
trying to beat you kind of have an
24:06
understanding that they won't try and
24:07
overtake you at that moment yeah that is
24:09
true the fact is you're on the road for
24:11
hours and hours and hours on end and
24:12
you're taking in lots of chocolate milk
24:14
or you know
24:15
whatever and so you do need to stop and
24:18
it's just like a yeah hard luck you get
24:21
overtaken it doesn't make sense because
24:22
then you won't attack you won't get
24:23
attacked yourself but the chivalry in in
24:26
cycling is quite good like even for
24:28
instance if you're at the top if you're
24:29
the in the lead and let's say there's a
24:32
crash and it's not really your fault
24:33
quite often the others will wait for you
24:35
because they want to beat you just by
24:37
being better than you not because of a
24:38
bit of bad luck or whatever and through
24:40
massive injections of bound substances
24:44
that's what chivalry is
24:47
sir lancelot
24:49
found a crease in his armor and stabbed
24:51
a massive syringe in it
24:56
[Applause]
24:59
[Music]
25:01
okay it is time for fact number three
25:03
and that is andy my fact is that in the
25:05
19th century setting type for newspapers
25:07
was a competitive sport
25:10
oh my god it's so exciting this was
25:12
before they had the tour de france so
25:14
you had to they had to find their own
25:15
entertainment somehow
25:17
um so setting time for newspapers is
25:19
where you would have a massive bank of
25:20
letters in front of you and they're all
25:23
the molds that you're using in a
25:24
newspaper and you have to pluck them out
25:25
by hand you say oh we need a e and then
25:27
we need a big f and then we need
25:28
something sorry what word is that we're
25:30
sweating
25:31
[Laughter]
25:34
and obviously it's amazing sorry when
25:36
you were trying to come up with a random
25:37
series of letters you listed e f and g
25:44
i don't know where my imagination comes
25:45
from but it's a gift
25:47
so basically you're writing out all the
25:49
words that a newspaper needs to do but
25:51
you're doing it in physical blocks yeah
25:53
exactly and then the printing press
25:54
comes down and prints the newspaper yeah
25:56
right exactly so you make a full page of
25:59
type and it's it's incredibly you know
26:01
hard physical work and there's so much
26:03
of it to do
26:04
so and this was you know pre-mechanized
26:07
type setting and it turned into a sport
26:10
and typesetters would turn up and
26:11
compete against each other to audiences
26:13
of hundreds or thousands as well there
26:15
were prizes of about a thousand dollars
26:16
which was a six month salary for a time
26:18
setter at the time which is pretty good
26:20
and um they were judged on speed so they
26:23
were given a set passage to typeset but
26:25
then afterwards there had to be proof
26:27
readers who would assess them for
26:29
mistakes they'd made in their types of
26:31
competitive proof reading as well
26:33
how would you do competitive
26:34
proofreading you'd have to have more
26:35
proof readers yes
26:41
but being a typesetter was a pretty
26:43
job wasn't it it was very tough yeah
26:45
yeah you would work from 1pm to 4am yep
26:48
every day
26:49
um the ventilation and the and the fumes
26:52
and everything were so bad that the
26:53
average life expectancy in 1850 was 28
26:56
years of a typesetter wow wow yeah
26:59
it was rough well
27:01
there were kind of quite cool little
27:02
details about doing it so one of them is
27:05
the origin of uppercase and lowercase is
27:07
that they would keep all the different
27:09
types in separate drawers for each font
27:11
you'd have two drawers and the upper
27:14
drawer or the uppercase was the one full
27:15
of capital letters and the lower draw
27:17
the lowercase was the lowercase
27:18
yeah it's quite nice there's loads of
27:20
words isn't there that that is what you
27:22
see when you go on the internet and you
27:23
google
27:24
typesetting facts it's always like the
27:26
word cliche comes from typesetting i
27:29
don't know that one it's like if you've
27:31
used up all your type
27:32
then you can't use it for anything else
27:34
so what you did was used up all your
27:35
type and then you made a mold out of it
27:37
and then you printed everything with
27:38
that mold and that mold was called the
27:41
the cliche or the stereotype but
27:43
something pointed out to me that cliche
27:45
is an onomatopoeia because cliche was
27:48
actually the sound of the mould as it
27:50
hit the molten metal uh what was it wait
27:53
what are you using the mold for so
27:54
basically you've you've done your type
27:56
yeah and you want to do a second page so
27:58
you have to reuse all of these blocks is
28:00
this right yeah right and so what you do
28:01
is you take a mold of it and then you
28:03
can reuse the blocks for the next page
28:04
oh i saw your cliche or your stereotype
28:07
yeah and i think cliche was used for um
28:09
images and stereotype was used for type
28:14
cliche the sound that molten lead makes
28:16
that's very cool they needed so much of
28:18
it as well so a single newspaper needed
28:20
about 50 to 100 hours of typesetting and
28:23
this is going very fast as well this is
28:25
sometimes they would do two things per
28:26
second you're constantly going back and
28:28
forth to the cases and it's all upside
28:30
down and back to front as well there's
28:32
another complication of the trade yeah
28:34
um
28:35
and but as this as these competitions
28:37
were happening this was kind of a dying
28:39
uh game because it was replaced by uh
28:41
linotype or liner type
28:43
so it came from line of type letter type
28:45
you would press a keyboard you were just
28:46
given a keyboard and then as you pressed
28:48
you know lowercase h an individual
28:50
letter would slide into place and then
28:52
when the line was finished and operate
28:54
the operator will release some boiling
28:55
lead and that would make a single stick
28:57
of metal for that whole line of type so
28:59
that became a much faster way of doing
29:01
it and then that was replaced by
29:03
computerized typesetting and when that
29:05
happened the guardian had a mock funeral
29:08
for the old printing process really yeah
29:11
this was in 1987 wow the printing union
29:15
they they had a miniature coffin
29:17
and the coffin has a place on it saying
29:19
r.i.p the guardian 1961 to 1987
29:22
and there were printers dressed as
29:23
pallbearers in top hats and black tie
29:26
and there was a saxophone player i have
29:27
not worked out why i think because it
29:29
was 1987
29:31
and the and that coffin the mini coffin
29:33
commemorating uh lena type printing is
29:36
now in the guardians archive really yeah
29:38
wow
29:39
so cool well i like as well that when
29:41
you read the characters in the stories
29:42
um they're often associated with a font
29:44
that you know really well so like uh
29:46
john baskerville for example um he's
29:49
famous as a typographer but he also
29:51
created this font so we have that today
29:53
and then he was killed by that dog so
29:55
sad yeah
29:58
yeah uh there's a guy called william
30:00
caslen uh i quite like as well he he
30:03
invented a typeface that was used on the
30:04
declaration of independence and he was a
30:06
british
30:07
guy so i quite like it's a british font
30:08
that's the was it what's he called uh
30:11
william castle and so i don't know yeah
30:13
i haven't heard of that i don't think he
30:14
made it into there were loads of those
30:16
guys there was sir john helvetica yeah
30:18
jeremiah wingdings yep
30:21
arthur comic sans
30:23
double barrel name of course very
30:24
popular
30:25
he was from the berkshire comics
30:27
[Laughter]
30:30
um
30:30
so when all these new innovations come
30:32
along people are often afraid it was
30:33
going to put them out of work
30:35
so for instance typesetters not really a
30:37
thing anymore because we don't need them
30:39
and similarly as the printing press got
30:40
better and better and more automated it
30:42
needed fewer workers and one of the
30:45
major advances in the printing press was
30:46
the steam printing press so it could get
30:49
run by steam this was invented in the
30:50
early 1800s and the first place it was
30:53
used was on the times and the times was
30:55
managed by a guy called john walter and
30:58
he heard about this steam printing press
30:59
invention and he thought i better
31:01
introduce this into my factory because
31:02
it seems amazing and it can do so much
31:04
printing but i can't tell the workers
31:06
because i get really annoyed because it
31:07
was like the age of luddism and you know
31:10
workers fearing their jobs would be lost
31:12
so overnight he secretly installed this
31:14
theme printing press he printed all of
31:17
the day's papers overnight and all the
31:19
workers arrived at work the next day and
31:21
he announced them that their jobs were
31:22
narrowed down and because he'd already
31:23
done that they gave them a newspaper
31:25
with the headline you're all fine
31:28
that is so so weird anna because did you
31:30
say that was the times yeah so that is
31:32
literally exactly what happened in the
31:34
80s with rupert murdoch at the times
31:36
what yeah genuinely because the printing
31:38
unions had massive they um there were
31:40
big
31:40
industrial disputes with the printing
31:42
unions they were constantly going on
31:43
strike they were you know extremely well
31:45
paid and murdoch wanted to smash the
31:48
unions so he had an entirely new
31:50
newspaper printing plant set up in
31:51
whopping outside fleet street set up all
31:54
the computers there in secret and then
31:56
bang overnight moved there and moved the
31:58
times there yeah and at a stroke took
32:01
away the power of the printing unions
32:02
which has not been the same since i was
32:03
looking into victorian newspapers and i
32:05
found an account of a guy called at
32:07
digivictorian dr bob nicholson is his
32:10
name and he said he wrote a series of
32:12
really fun tweets which is he said he'd
32:14
just watched the new dickens movie and
32:16
he's not usually bothered by
32:17
inaccuracies in historical dramas but
32:20
politely requesting stop putting massive
32:22
headlines on victorian newspapers
32:24
picture of it's it's saying dickens and
32:26
and it's a headline that dickens is
32:28
holding and that's a terrible headline
32:30
as well
32:32
and that's what he's done yeah
32:34
it doesn't tell you anything that's what
32:36
i mean if he'd put his dick in
32:39
that's quite a good pun actually there
32:41
were a few more lines on it i mean if it
32:43
was called what's the what's the dick in
32:45
then i would be interested because
32:46
that's his pun on what the dickens
32:48
that's good that would be a tabloid way
32:49
of doing it yeah that is good
32:51
dickens puts dick in chicken we'll be
32:56
sorry dad you were talking about news
32:58
over headlines there was more to the
32:59
headline it might have been okay yeah it
33:01
might have been dickens put stick and
33:03
chicken i haven't seen the new movie but
33:06
it could very well be that um and uh his
33:09
point being that no newspapers back in
33:11
victorian times carried headlines not
33:12
only did they not carry headlines they
33:14
didn't even carry news stories all they
33:15
carried was adverts the whole of the
33:17
front page of all newspapers or at least
33:19
most of the newspapers back then were
33:21
densely packed with adverts for and and
33:24
when you think about the printing
33:25
process and you see a picture of it it's
33:26
tiny it's so tiny just saying how how's
33:28
that possible wait but i mean they did
33:30
have news stories in the newspaper but
33:32
not on the covers yeah yeah so no
33:33
headlines would ever appear there but
33:35
not even news would appear there that
33:36
was that was never the thing it was just
33:38
purely adverts which i didn't know there
33:40
were so many personal adverts as well
33:42
the it was it was you know the facebook
33:44
the craigslist the everything of its day
33:46
it was just the where the community
33:48
exchanged all of its news and said you
33:50
know has anyone seen my check-in yeah mr
33:52
dickens was hanging around last night i
33:54
don't know where it's gone
33:56
[Applause]
33:57
[Music]
34:01
okay it is time for our final fact of
34:03
the show and that is james okay my fact
34:06
this week is that britain exports fresh
34:08
air to china
34:11
and that's how we're going to get
34:12
through brexit guys
34:15
we'll all be asphyxiating in five years
34:17
we've sold all the air
34:20
um so basically this is a thing which
34:22
started off as a joke and everyone would
34:24
just kind of get fresh air from
34:26
different countries and put it in jars
34:28
and sell it to people but more recently
34:30
it's become kind of a thing and people
34:32
in china like to get these jars of air
34:34
and obviously the pollution is terrible
34:36
in china and there's a firm called ether
34:39
i think or if air and they collect air
34:42
from the uk countryside and sell it for
34:43
80 pounds a jar
34:45
and it began as an enviro political
34:48
artwork um but now they say at the end
34:50
of the day we're a company selling fresh
34:52
air to people who can afford it and
34:54
anti-pollution face masks of those who
34:56
can't
34:57
because they reinvest the money didn't
34:58
they in the face mask that's right yeah
35:00
i know it was really confusing when it
35:02
was first set up because i remember it
35:03
was about two years ago when that guy
35:05
leo de watts first set up that company
35:10
it's a dad joke
35:12
yeah but it's so weird you should watch
35:15
look up on youtube the youtube video of
35:18
his team so there are these two really
35:20
posh women and he it's never openly
35:22
stated anywhere that it's a spoof but it
35:24
so obviously is and you can see the
35:25
comments below getting so agitated about
35:27
how stupid they are it's these two women
35:29
absolutely taking the piss and they're
35:30
being really funny so they prance around
35:32
the countryside with these nets just
35:34
leaping about
35:36
netting air and then they go up to a
35:38
little jar and then they thrust the nest
35:40
into the jar and they talk about it so
35:42
there's one woman who says the wind
35:43
might pick up notes of grass or if
35:45
you're near the sea some saltiness and
35:47
then at the end they have about five
35:48
jars and they say there's today's
35:50
harvest
35:51
and if they're only getting five a day
35:52
it's no wonder it's 80 pounds of pop
35:54
that's true yeah yeah very small yield
35:59
um sean erin who's the director of the
36:01
canadian respiratory research network
36:04
says this is unlikely to provide any
36:06
health benefits clean air bottles is a
36:08
gimmick a waste of money
36:11
so if you're listening don't pay 80
36:13
pounds for fresh air unless you're very
36:15
wealthy
36:16
yeah you know who we just tell people
36:18
how to spend their money
36:19
[Laughter]
36:21
no it's yeah obviously you don't get
36:23
rich in the first place if you're
36:24
spending money on fresh air no that's
36:27
true the trick yeah but if you're
36:28
selling it you might do yeah one of the
36:30
things i found out from this because
36:31
just because it was about china's uh
36:33
problem with air pollution yeah china's
36:35
taking massive steps to uh deal with now
36:37
is that um
36:39
beijing is now in its 13th five-year
36:41
plan
36:42
did you know there are still five year
36:43
plans going no i didn't know yeah hang
36:46
on and it's actually done all 13 of them
36:48
all the way through because stalin
36:49
didn't even get through his first one
36:50
really once you get to the end of five
36:52
years that's it you've just finished the
36:53
five-year plan yeah whether you actually
36:55
get what you planned on not exactly plan
36:56
this over you just have to have another
36:58
plan right you can't extend a five-year
37:00
plan to be a six-year plan you're just
37:02
starting your five-year plan
37:03
are you just saying that china's been
37:05
around for 65 years
37:07
[Laughter]
37:10
but they've had a new five-year plan
37:11
every five years it's a thing they they
37:13
keep they've kept doing is it and it's
37:14
paying off yeah they're doing okay
37:16
aren't they yeah
37:17
not on a pollution level no
37:19
but it gets called the apocalypse
37:22
yes but surely it doesn't work in
37:24
chinese in mandarin does it can't do so
37:27
why do they call it that
37:29
maybe it's us who calls it that
37:30
[Laughter]
37:33
there's a hotel called the cordis
37:35
honkyou which has filters
37:37
it filters all the air
37:39
going into the hotel like an airplane
37:41
all the windows are closed all the time
37:43
and the air quality is 10 times better
37:44
indoors so the hotel claims than it is
37:47
outdoors
37:48
so but yeah has to pass through two
37:50
intensive filtering layers isn't that
37:51
crazy yeah because that's not a way of
37:53
uh you can't do that for everybody
37:56
no no
37:57
you could get little helmets though like
37:59
there has been a push chair that's been
38:00
developed for babies which is basically
38:02
that but this is called the air shield
38:05
and it's a thing that creates a clean
38:07
air micro climate inside a baby's pusher
38:09
why are the babies getting all the good
38:11
stuff
38:12
because they're innocent james unlike
38:13
you what what have you
38:16
heard i'm saying is that technology
38:19
surely can be slightly increased in size
38:21
for people like me why would you why do
38:23
you want to be pushed around in a push
38:24
chair that's crazy james look you can't
38:26
tell me what to do with my money
38:27
[Laughter]
38:30
it doesn't go big enough for adult heads
38:32
it can only no i don't know it's quite
38:33
expensive at the moment i think but um
38:35
it is quite cool it looks like an alien
38:37
pod and it's got a glass lid that
38:38
protects them from uv rays and then it's
38:40
got a little speaker installed inside it
38:42
so the parent can chat to the baby still
38:45
um
38:50
but babies famously produce quite bad
38:52
smells
38:54
so
38:55
julia there's a risk that you're locking
38:56
them in with their own farts you don't
38:58
just leave them in there for five years
39:02
um but yeah it's a real very major
39:04
problem isn't it uh bad air quality in
39:06
the world and i think people are now
39:07
trying to make face masks a bit trendy
39:09
because you know we're used to seeing
39:11
face masks they all look the same don't
39:12
i guess they're black or white but
39:14
they've become there are startups in
39:16
china and in the u.s and in the uk that
39:18
are designing pollution masks for up to
39:21
100 at the moment but to try and make
39:23
them cool can you get them to look like
39:25
your own face so that no one knows
39:27
you're wearing one of the masks i think
39:28
you could put like a mustache on there
39:31
yeah and then you can see if you look
39:32
good in the beard and mustache that's
39:34
really nice
39:37
do they do extending face masks which
39:40
can cover the breast area all the penis
39:42
area actually
39:44
so you can just try it out
39:46
you know this thing about if you breathe
39:48
in
39:49
a lung full of air it'll contain some of
39:51
caesar's breath
39:53
there have been calculations done on
39:54
this and so the idea is he breathed out
39:57
some molecules and there's enough of
39:59
them in all of the air that one of them
40:01
will get into your breath right exactly
40:03
yeah i always thought it was when he
40:05
died his his atoms are what are in the
40:08
air and that's what you're breathing in
40:09
there's another thing like that right
40:10
well there will be yeah the carbon that
40:12
makes up his body might be in carbon
40:14
dioxide but um so there's a book called
40:16
caesar's last breath by an author called
40:18
sam keane and he says that
40:20
every breath has about 25 sextillion gas
40:23
molecules so given the number of breaths
40:25
you take over your life the odds are
40:27
that there will be a caesar particle uh
40:29
in any any breath you take what about
40:31
every move you make uh yeah he'll be
40:34
watching you
40:37
so i took it a bit further and i i i
40:40
looked up how much you fart every day
40:42
okay oh yeah and you've fought about
40:44
three pints a day right three pints
40:46
three pints yeah yeah but gas is kind of
40:48
spread out isn't it oh yes it's not like
40:50
if you squash it down to a liquid it
40:52
would be a point yes okay right yeah so
40:55
i think i'm right in working this out
40:57
that at least twice a day you will
40:58
breathe in a molecule that caesar farted
41:01
out
41:02
cool i might i might be wrong on the
41:04
maths wow so there's a company oh there
41:07
was a company in 2016 that sold
41:09
shoreditch air
41:10
oh from the shoreditch area of london
41:12
which is super trendy yeah yeah it was
41:15
1999 each so cheaper than the stuff that
41:18
they were sending to china yeah that's
41:20
good uh you can either get shoreditch am
41:23
which contains the notes of the night
41:25
before
41:26
or shoreditch pm with smells of rolled
41:28
tobacco cigarettes pseudo philosophy and
41:31
hemp brewed beer i think i might pay the
41:33
80 quid actually for the more expensive
41:35
stuff
41:35
[Laughter]
41:38
my family used to have a can of air did
41:40
they yeah we as a fire extinguisher down
41:42
it's completely different
41:44
dan constantly with his mouth wrapped
41:46
around the fire extinguisher in the
41:47
morning
41:48
and then when that fire came it wasn't
41:50
funny anymore was it what's happened to
41:51
the big counter there dan drank it
41:56
just for anyone listening i know a fire
41:58
extinguisher is not a can of air all
41:59
right i know it's more complicated than
42:01
that
42:03
it says if you blasted air on a fire
42:05
wouldn't it make the fire bigger
42:07
oxygen that would be but there is you
42:09
know
42:09
yeah yeah like
42:11
but what does that contain oxygen yeah
42:14
yeah mostly nitrogen anyway how do you
42:15
get nitrogen with fire extinguishers
42:18
that's cool in fact
42:20
we've said before that packets of crisps
42:21
are full of nitrogen no oxygen oh not
42:23
air rather so that the crisps don't go
42:25
off could you theoretically put a fire
42:27
out by opening a massive bag of crisps
42:28
near it yes
42:30
excellent
42:32
anything that replaces the oxygen would
42:33
do it well i know what i'm going on
42:35
dragon stem with that's amazing this is
42:38
a packet of crisp the size of a house
42:40
just put open it slowly and put the bag
42:42
over the fire and it's out oh but if you
42:44
put it over the fire then you've wasted
42:46
the crisps haven't you i don't know
42:47
they're nicely charged these are these
42:50
crisps are just potato aren't they
42:51
they've not been cooked yes but they're
42:53
potatoes covered in oil wow
42:56
oh
42:57
this is the best idea anyone's ever had
42:59
is this why we never hear about a fire
43:01
in a walker's crisp factory
43:04
sorry dad i completely interrupted it
43:06
it's pre-1997 hand over hong kong air is
43:09
what we had so what they did in hong
43:10
kong was they canned pre the the british
43:13
british air as it were in uh hong kong
43:16
and wow during the handover lots of
43:18
parties uh that was their present to a
43:20
lot of people that went to them so for
43:21
years we had this can in the house i
43:23
don't know where it's going wow yeah oh
43:24
cool yeah i have one last thing which is
43:27
the band kiss uh if we're talking about
43:29
selling air they sell and they're making
43:32
a lot of money off you know air guitar
43:34
yeah they sell strings for your air
43:36
guitar
43:38
yeah and they package it up and they
43:40
have a little you know like if you were
43:42
buying something from a joke shop uh
43:43
it's it's got that little label it says
43:45
guaranteed uh strong strings or whatever
43:48
and it's yeah it's kiss and they're
43:49
making so much money off it when people
43:51
go to their stores which they have in
43:52
america uh yeah and it's just a really
43:54
good idea it's a great yeah it's a great
43:56
novelty i do but they're making millions
43:57
of selling air is what the article is
44:00
saying yeah
44:01
[Music]
44:06

things going for it that make it really
01:01
great for human flight
01:04
well one bad thing lack of humans yes
01:06
that is a bad thing
01:07
but a good thing is that its gravity is
01:09
only 14
01:10
as strong as earth's so pretty low
01:12
gravity
01:13
and its air pressure is 50 percent
01:16
higher than earth's
01:17
so really weak gravity and really strong
01:19
nice thick
01:20
air so people have said anecdotally for
01:22
years that if you could get people on
01:24
the
01:24
straps and wings on them they'd be able
01:26
to fly like birds
01:27
but um in 2014 some students from the
01:30
university of leicester actually did the
01:32
physics
01:33
and they worked out that if you were
01:34
wearing a normal wingsuit which has a
01:36
wingspan of about 1.4
01:38
square meters and if you want to get 11
01:41
meters per second
01:42
you would be able to run jump up and
01:44
take off and fly
01:46
so great so if you're a normal person
01:48
you couldn't right it's only if you're
01:50
as fast as usain bolt he is just him and
01:52
a few others who are cracking that speed
01:54
so uh usain bolt can go at 12 meters per
01:57
second or he could in his heyday he's
01:58
now retired so
02:00
i imagine that he's useless but yeah
02:03
usain bolt in the day could do it a
02:05
normal person could do it if they could
02:07
run at six meters
02:08
per second but they would have a large
02:09
and unwieldy wing suit
02:11
so they wouldn't be able to get away
02:12
with the normal sort of day-to-day wings
02:14
that we're all wearing now very cool
02:16
you'd also need a very warm coat though
02:18
wouldn't you
02:19
because the temperature is about minus
02:21
180 degrees celsius
02:22
yeah quite a one coat and actually a
02:24
warm coat would weigh you down quite a
02:25
lot and then the physics probably
02:26
wouldn't work anymore well if you had a
02:27
very big coat
02:28
yeah do you remember when you were a kid
02:30
and there was like high winds
02:31
like gales and you would hold your coat
02:33
out and then try and fly with it yeah
02:35
that was great or your umbrella
02:36
sometimes you'd fly with an umbrella
02:38
yeah well i wasn't mary poppins when i
02:40
went to school
02:41
um but actually um you couldn't do the
02:44
winds because there's not much wind on
02:45
titan is there no
02:47
and that's because the temperature is
02:49
always very low and we get our wind on
02:51
earth because of the changes in
02:52
temperature with the sun
02:54
and they don't really get those changes
02:55
of temperature yeah which is why they
02:57
because they've got lakes one of the
02:58
reasons it's so great for human
02:59
habitation apparently
03:01
is that it's got um stable liquids on
03:04
its surface hasn't it which is extremely
03:06
unusual and it has an atmosphere
03:07
that is sort of similar to earth but
03:10
it's liquids
03:10
wow similar ish it's not similar it's
03:13
got it's a vaguely similar level
03:15
of kind of thickness and it's got some
03:16
nitrogen it's got lots and lots of
03:18
nitrogen there's no problem with
03:19
nitrogen you like nitrogen you get a lot
03:20
of titan but it's got no
03:22
oxygen basically so the lakes are made
03:24
out of methane they are it has a lot of
03:26
methane and ethane in it which i imagine
03:28
means that it smells
03:29
really bad on there well in fact i think
03:31
they might have looked into how the
03:33
atmosphere there smells they've tried to
03:35
recreate it
03:36
uh scientists did this this year or last
03:38
year and they
03:39
got some methane and ethane involved
03:40
they got some nitrogen involved and it
03:42
still wasn't behaving quite like titan's
03:44
atmosphere
03:45
and then they added some benzene and it
03:47
that's the crucial ingredient that
03:49
mimics the atmosphere and it smells like
03:51
petrol
03:52
so the whole place if we live there
03:53
smells like petrol station it
03:55
yeah i love the smell of petrol stations
03:57
can i just say it's one of my favorite
03:59
smells
03:59
yeah it's very nice i like that too but
04:02
a lot of people kept saying how good
04:04
titan would be
04:05
and they were saying things like that
04:07
you know it's got some liquid it's got
04:08
an atmosphere
04:09
it's the only other place in our solar
04:11
system where it rains
04:13
it just sounds like a recipe for a very
04:14
bad picnic i think it's
04:16
really really habitable compared to the
04:19
other moons in the solar system
04:20
which is a bit of a low ball the other
04:22
thing about picnics is instead of wasps
04:24
flying around you have hundred meter
04:25
runners
04:26
kind of fly around um another good thing
04:30
about titan
04:31
uh since you're so busy about mounting
04:32
it um is
04:34
that this is so they've recreated also
04:36
titan's lakes because there's a plan for
04:38
nasa to send a submarine up there in
04:40
2025. i'd send a spaceship if i was nasa
04:43
but go on
04:44
you need to write to them um they're
04:47
sending a submarine up
04:48
and they're going to get there and they
04:50
need to dive so they need to deal with
04:51
the
04:52
coldness of the liquid but they realize
04:54
that ice bugs can't form so one of the
04:56
people recreating this has said
04:57
a really vital positive is the fact that
05:00
because the
05:01
freezing temperature of these methane
05:02
lakes is so low iceberg's not a
05:04
possibility
05:05
so you won't get titanic on titan and
05:08
also the submarine won't crash into any
05:10
icebergs
05:11
do you know who might be crewing this
05:13
submarine that we're going to send up
05:15
robots bacteria come on well
05:18
it's a stretch but no the um
05:22
so there are deep sea bacteria which
05:24
theoretically
05:26
could survive there but they can't drive
05:28
a spaceship
05:31
there'll be an intense training montage
05:34
no but
05:35
they're called oh this is a tough name
05:37
methanothermococcus okinawensis
05:39
and they can survive irrespective of
05:41
temperature and pressure and vitamins
05:43
and toxic chemicals
05:44
and i think they live around vents very
05:46
deeply did you say
05:48
yeah they won't even need to take
05:51
vitamin meals in pill form
05:53
yeah i don't save on satsuma i think
05:56
basically they just go into hibernation
05:57
and as soon as the conditions are right
05:58
for them to spring back into it they do
05:59
correct so we could possibly set up a
06:01
submarine in front of those guys
06:02
and just see how they did i went on to
06:05
yale scientific magazine because they
06:07
had an article why can't humans fly
06:10
and uh we can't turns out uh we would
06:13
need a wing span of at least 6.7 meters
06:16
to fly according to this website that
06:18
6.7 across the whole wingspan so
06:21
3.35 either side yeah it's still a lot
06:23
and it could
06:24
make the um wings too heavy to function
06:27
and also the muscles that you need those
06:29
wings would need to have smaller wings
06:32
helping them fly well we've sort of
06:35
cracked quite an important human-powered
06:36
flight thing
06:37
really recently didn't we because there
06:39
was a prize set up
06:41
in 1970 i think it was
06:44
awarding 250 000 pounds for the first
06:47
person to
06:48
make a human-powered helicopter and it
06:50
was thought to be impossible and all
06:51
these studies were written saying it's
06:52
impossible
06:53
and i only found next i was reading a
06:54
washington post article saying no one's
06:56
come anywhere close
06:57
to achieving this in 2011. and then in
07:00
2013
07:01
we did it or engineers from the
07:03
university of toronto did it
07:04
and they've built this helicopter which
07:06
is basically about the size of a
07:08
football pitch
07:11
powered by one human yeah it's
07:12
unbelievably light it weighs only
07:15
50 kilos but it's ridiculously large
07:17
because as you say you've got to have
07:18
really big wings and there's a little
07:19
guy on a bicycle in the middle of it
07:21
who's desperately cycling that's amazing
07:23
and then well it's not as amazing
07:25
so my wife flies helicopters yeah and we
07:28
always have to find a place for her to
07:29
land
07:30
which is not too many trees around and
07:32
stuff like that i think if your
07:34
helicopter is the size of a football
07:35
pitch that is going to be tough right
07:37
it's too big i looked up a list of names
07:40
of
07:41
uh human-powered flight machines oh
07:43
great
07:44
they were called things like the
07:46
reluctant phoenix
07:49
that's your drag name isn't it that does
07:52
sound like
07:53
they once crashed it in a bowl of flames
07:58
um there was a reluctant fix the perkins
08:00
inflatable which i liked there was the
08:01
puffin
08:02
the puffin two and there were three
08:04
called icarus
08:05
named after they named it after the
08:07
thing that the one who died yeah
08:09
they only read the first half of the
08:10
story this is great
08:12
don't need to finish i really respect
08:14
this guy's confidence
08:16
um usain bolt who i know you've touched
08:18
on in the past
08:19
but um did you know that so he has
08:21
scoliosis so he has curvature of the
08:23
spine
08:24
so his legs are actually a significantly
08:27
different length from each other
08:28
um well let's go to the third not quite
08:31
as dramatic as richard the third i don't
08:33
think but um his right leg is half an
08:35
inch shorter than his left
08:36
the prevailing wisdom is that if you
08:38
want to go in a straight line as fast as
08:39
you can you should be symmetrical and
08:40
obviously he's not
08:41
quite symmetrical and they don't know if
08:43
he was symmetrical
08:45
would he go faster or does this slight
08:48
off-balance
08:49
somehow work in his favor because he
08:52
goes pretty quick what happens
08:54
actually yeah you do know about the
08:55
sport
08:57
for someone who doesn't like sport
08:58
you've picked a very sport-based fact
08:59
involving both sprinting and flying
09:03
there is a sprinter at the moment called
09:05
brianna liston
09:06
and she's 12 years old she's from
09:09
jamaica
09:10
and in 2017 she ran the what 100 meters
09:13
in 11.86 seconds
09:16
which is unbelievably fast and in fact
09:19
if she'd have taken part in the 1896
09:21
olympics she would have won
09:24
by more than 0.1 of a second 12 year old
09:26
girl
09:27
um the team behind the cassini mission
09:30
which was the probe that went to saturn
09:32
and it dropped off
09:34
uh the i how do you pronounce it huygens
09:37
is the moon lander that they they drop
09:39
down um
09:41
it's the only human thing ever to land
09:42
on a body beyond the asteroid belt and
09:44
now it's there it's gonna be there for
09:45
millions of years it's very very cool
09:47
anyway the cassini probe uh the team
09:49
behind it they spent 20 years working on
09:51
it this huge long project
09:53
and they got so close that they had all
09:55
these cool team things that they did
09:56
together
09:57
so they had a softball team called the
09:59
roving marauders
10:00
and whenever there was a big date in
10:02
cassini or saturn or what a titan
10:04
history
10:05
they would brew a special beer and they
10:07
give it a special name
10:08
yeah nice do you think we should do that
10:11
we don't have enough we already do
10:12
james do we but softball's only a
10:15
three-player game
10:18
and there's a no james's rule and i
10:21
already turn up so
10:24
[Music]
10:24
[Applause]
10:28
okay we should move on on to fact number
10:31
two
10:32
and that is my fact my fact this week is
10:34
that in 1604
10:36
one of king james the first grooms rode
10:39
from london to york and back
10:40
five times in the space of five days for
10:43
a bet
10:44
wow did you choose a james fact because
10:47
um james rossen is here today
10:49
i did yeah well yeah why have you never
10:51
done a james back before
10:53
i just never noticed you being here i
10:54
guess yeah this this is really cool so
10:57
this is a guy
10:57
called john lepton and it was first
11:00
recorded in this amazing book which i
11:02
wasted all my research time reading
11:04
today
11:05
which was this book called abridgement
11:06
of the english chronicle and it was
11:07
written in 1604 by a guy who died in
11:09
1605. so he just got in there
11:11
and yeah it was this story that he sort
11:14
of said that he reckoned he'd be able to
11:15
go
11:16
to and from london and york five times
11:18
in six days and he ended up managing to
11:20
do it with one day to spare
11:22
wow it is really good that isn't it yeah
11:24
is it a different horse every time
11:26
that's the annoying thing it wasn't
11:27
recorded how often he changed his horses
11:29
you would normally change your horse
11:31
though on a journey that long i don't
11:32
think
11:33
would you yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
11:36
yeah
11:37
from my knowledge of probably swapping
11:39
at watford gap yeah
11:41
so when he finished this um according to
11:44
the
11:44
book that i read um it said i think this
11:46
is probably the same one
11:47
he finished his appointed journey to the
11:49
admiration of
11:50
all men in five days and upon tuesday
11:54
the 28th he came to court at greenwich
11:56
to his majesty in as fresh and cheerful
11:59
a manner as when he first began
12:01
yeah nice although he arrived
12:04
on so he was due to arrive on a saturday
12:06
night it's really cool this
12:07
this account because it really gives
12:09
intense details of the time he arrived
12:10
how long he slept for
12:12
he arrived on the friday night and then
12:13
there is a gap in our knowledge
12:15
for the fight for the saturday and the
12:17
sunday so you can only imagine he got
12:18
absolutely hammered
12:19
in new york for saturday and sunday woke
12:22
up with a heinous hangover on monday
12:24
and then struggled back to be cheerful
12:25
on tuesday sounds great
12:28
one thing that i think i read about this
12:29
which i think is quite interesting uh
12:31
from the journal of sport history
12:33
um it said that this could kind of be
12:36
seen as the first sporting record
12:38
so it wasn't really until the 19th
12:40
century that people became obsessed with
12:42
like
12:42
i've done this sport in this amount of
12:44
time you know that kind of
12:45
record-breaking mentality
12:47
um it was another two centuries before
12:49
men began routinely to abstract the
12:50
quantified performance
12:52
as a mark to be equaled or surpassed but
12:55
this is kind of the first instance of
12:56
that happening he said i can travel this
12:58
long in this
12:59
distance yeah will you put money on it
13:02
exactly that's really cool they do don't
13:03
they call it the first sort of
13:05
sporting match that we have a record of
13:06
but i was reading again in this book
13:08
that there were lots of really weirdly
13:10
progressive rules around it
13:11
so it became a huge gambling thing you
13:14
often bet on horse races
13:15
than as now but if you won more than 100
13:18
marks on a horse race
13:19
you had to give up all of your remainder
13:20
to the poor so that was a rule that was
13:22
introduced introduced in james's time
13:24
there was an act passed in scotland that
13:26
said
13:27
stop feeding horses hard meat in summer
13:30
that practice being held one among other
13:32
occasions of dearth of victims
13:34
which i think is basically the poor
13:36
people need me in summer
13:38
and if people keep feeding it to their
13:40
horses then the poor people aren't
13:41
getting it
13:42
which is very progressive i feel like
13:43
the national lottery
13:45
a lot exactly like the national lottery
13:47
yeah if you went more than a hundred
13:48
quid you have to give the rest of the
13:49
poor
13:51
and even not quite like the national
13:52
lottery um
13:54
do you know about john lepton's other
13:56
horse
13:58
feet no do you mean hooves yeah hoops
14:01
that's it um
14:02
so shortly after this event there was uh
14:05
remember remember the fifth of november
14:07
the gunpowder plot
14:09
um and a couple of days after thomas
14:11
percy was a fugitive he was involved in
14:13
the conspiracy
14:14
everyone was looking for him so he had
14:16
connections
14:17
in northumberland cumberland and
14:19
yorkshire in the north of england
14:21
and people thought that he might be sort
14:22
of hiding out there so
14:24
our hero john leptin was sent to see if
14:27
they could find him wow
14:29
and according to my source john leptin
14:32
missed his man and his epic ride took
14:34
him to scotland before he realized that
14:36
the trail had gone cold
14:38
so in that instance he sort of overshot
14:41
his
14:41
his mark a little bit well because he
14:43
was so fast so he was probably going by
14:45
the average time he was told
14:46
he probably thought he was in
14:47
wolverhampton yeah and then he looked
14:49
around and he was in scotland
14:51
um i've got to think about a great horse
14:53
racing bet
14:54
oh god well this is a bit about distance
14:57
and travel so there was a guy called
14:59
lord march
15:00
who um made a bet that he could get a
15:03
letter
15:03
50 miles in an hour which at the
15:06
time exactly was impossible i would take
15:08
that bet
15:09
yeah exactly no horse could run at 50
15:11
miles an hour for an hour
15:13
even if you were on a cheetah it would
15:14
be pretty hard the cheetah couldn't do
15:16
that
15:16
he won the bet no yes he didn't use
15:19
horses did he use pigeons
15:20
no that would that's quite a good idea
15:22
although i don't even they i'm not sure
15:24
they can go 50 miles an hour
15:25
what he did was this is very clever he
15:27
put the letter inside a ball
15:29
okay and then he hired oh um hamsters
15:32
no no he hired
15:35
20 expert cricketers and for an hour
15:38
they threw it in a massive circle
15:40
all the way around over and over again
15:42
travelled
15:43
more than 50 miles no nonsense in that
15:45
hour it doesn't count
15:46
he won the bet well i wouldn't pay up
15:50
hasn't got anywhere i think that's a
15:52
really crafty
15:54
love much it's a clever man um i've got
15:56
a couple of ridiculous wages from the
15:57
18th century well so i think that wages
15:59
really took off in the 18th century when
16:01
it all just got
16:01
a bit silly um in 1735
16:05
count to bookberg bet a large wage on
16:07
riding to edinburgh backwards on a horse
16:10
which was accomplished in just under
16:11
four days i don't know if the count
16:13
did it or if he got someone to do it so
16:15
just to be clear the horse is going
16:17
forwards but you're facing backwards or
16:19
facing backwards i think it's like on a
16:22
train where the train's going forward
16:23
and you're facing backwards
16:25
yeah you probably didn't need to make a
16:27
train analogy there it's like a horse
16:28
going forward
16:30
and you're facing backwards um and in
16:32
1770
16:34
i read this from the gentleman which is
16:36
just so great
16:37
two girls bear that one could ride from
16:39
london to edinburgh and back
16:41
in less time than it took the other one
16:43
to draw a million dots
16:45
[Laughter]
16:48
who's counting the millions i do not
16:49
know and so they announced the wager but
16:52
then there doesn't seem to be any sort
16:53
of follow-up or result
16:55
section in the following and so you
16:57
don't know who won so i don't know who
16:58
won and
16:59
it's actually actually you only don't
17:00
know who won because it's a very long
17:02
line of dots and you don't know what
17:03
happens at the end of the long line of
17:04
things
17:05
there's a lot of suspense um but he
17:07
could make the dots in the most
17:09
expedious manner that he could contrive
17:12
which i think includes hiring people to
17:14
draw dots
17:15
yeah or some sort of mechanical hire a
17:18
million people it's just one dot each
17:19
yeah yeah just glue a million pencils
17:21
together and make one dot
17:23
does it just glue a million pencils
17:26
together
17:27
does it count the time that you take
17:28
gluing the pencils together
17:30
or yeah that's all part of it that's
17:32
good
17:34
like the time it takes me to press a dot
17:36
right
17:37
you're not going to be able to do one
17:39
pencil gluing are you i would start glue
17:41
i would start just drawing dots but i
17:42
would instruct a friend to go and hire a
17:44
lot of
17:44
people immediately to come and join and
17:47
hire
17:48
draw more dots i reckon a thousand
17:49
people are a thousand dots
17:51
oh easy yeah but i i'm paying a thousand
17:53
people
17:54
what what peasants yeah 18th century
17:57
peasants
17:57
they just do what you tell them but so
17:58
many peasants are illiterate i don't
18:00
know if that
18:01
you can still draw a dart if you're
18:03
illiterate no they were really
18:04
illiterate back then
18:06
i just got lines what if you get um
18:09
a paintbrush and just kind of flick it
18:11
does that count as a dot oh
18:17
but what a good bet because he would be
18:19
drawing darts drawing dots and the other
18:20
guy would be riding to edinburgh
18:21
it's very exciting and suspenseful and
18:23
they're different kinds of achievement
18:24
as well
18:25
yeah i think that'll be really exciting
18:26
i think if they put if they had the
18:28
grand national and they also had some
18:30
dutch
18:31
competition at the same time yeah it
18:34
would be a hell of a lot more popular
18:35
yeah no um and there's another good bet
18:38
which is another kind of crafty bit a
18:40
bit like andy's
18:41
where someone was outwitted this was in
18:43
the 18th century and the earl of
18:45
barrymore
18:46
who apparently was known as hell gate or
18:48
rake of rakes
18:50
because he was a big womanizer in a bit
18:51
of a rake um
18:53
he thought he was very tall and thin and
18:55
his hair was all big and pointy
18:57
like together leaves yeah
19:00
like that uh he fancied himself as a
19:02
sportsman and this guy called mr bullock
19:04
challenged him to a running race
19:06
and bullock was a massively fat unfit
19:08
man he weighed 18 stone
19:10
and he said i challenge you to erase all
19:12
i'm saying is i want a 35-yard head
19:14
start and i want to be able to choose
19:15
the route
19:16
and barrymore said yeah sure i'm way
19:18
fitter than you look at you you're a
19:19
mess
19:20
and so lots of people put money on it
19:22
everyone backed um barrymore
19:24
and bullock took those bets so he's the
19:25
only one backing himself and the route
19:27
he
19:28
chose ran through an extremely narrow
19:31
alley he ran the entire route
19:35
with poor old barrymore not being able
19:37
to squeeze past him on either side
19:38
and apparently he sort of wobbled from
19:40
side to side as he went to make sure
19:42
there was no way of passing
19:44
wow that is brilliant i've got a fact
19:46
about jockeys
19:47
as we're on horse racing sure so joggy
19:50
posture you know that weird
19:51
posture that jockeys have no they're
19:53
kind of crouched
19:54
on a horse they're they're all sort of
19:56
hunched up this only caught on in 1898
19:59
before that you just sit upright and try
20:00
and win the horse race
20:02
and there was a guy a jockey called
20:03
james form and sloane he started doing
20:05
it
20:06
and it was like the fosbury flop you
20:07
know in um high jumping
20:10
within 10 years everyone around the
20:12
world was doing it and horse race
20:14
completion times improved by five to
20:16
seven percent over those ten years
20:18
solely because of this guy wow yeah i
20:21
can't believe they didn't figure that
20:22
out before
20:22
it's so obvious but it's not by reducing
20:25
wind resistance which you might think it
20:26
would
20:26
be no i wouldn't have thought that i
20:28
would have thought you were kind of
20:29
getting a bit of a
20:30
kind of a movement going i'm
20:37
when you're upright you're like a
20:38
sandbag and you jog up and down on the
20:40
horse but when you're in jockey position
20:42
or if they call it martini glass
20:44
position you can move relative to the
20:46
horse
20:47
so you are moving at a more constant
20:49
speed and i think it just helps
20:50
the whole thing go a bit more smoothly
20:51
maybe for the horse and for you like
20:53
finding a resonance almost
20:54
yeah exactly yeah do you guys know that
20:56
the precursor to the steeple chase
20:58
was the wild goose chase so
21:01
i just came came across this an old book
21:04
which was referring to a wild goose
21:05
chase as an actual race
21:06
and this was the main horse race that
21:08
people bet on before the steeple chase
21:10
and what he did was the horses all
21:11
started running and after
21:13
racing each other after 12 school yards
21:14
after 240 yards
21:16
whoever was in the lead was the one who
21:18
chose the route from that point onwards
21:22
and so they all went into this really
21:23
thin
21:27
and it was mad and so you'd like dodge
21:29
about you jump over a ditch and then
21:30
suddenly you'd take them over a massive
21:32
fence they didn't know what they were
21:33
doing
21:33
that's a really good idea but then if
21:34
you overtake them do you then get to
21:36
choose the route
21:37
no if you overtake them then you've won
21:39
wait but if you oh
21:40
if you ever take them there's no route
21:43
to get
21:44
wrong is there so if you ever take them
21:46
you choose the route that's why i was
21:47
thinking but actually that's the end of
21:48
the race if you
21:49
that's the end of the race because
21:50
apparently when you choose the route
21:52
when does the race end you just have to
21:53
run forever
21:54
this is why it was banned
22:00
it was very dangerous and it was banned
22:02
according to this like
22:03
sports illustrated or something in 1856
22:05
sports illustrated equivalent
22:07
um it was bad because it was too hard on
22:08
the horses and the riders because they
22:10
would just collapse in the end they'd
22:11
just go on and on and on
22:13
dodging about and then one of them would
22:14
collapse that's amazing
22:16
but that's the original world goose
22:17
chase um in 2012
22:20
prince harry bought chairs in a horse
22:22
called usain colt
22:24
amazing
22:28
i love that that's so funny
22:36
okay we should move on to fact number
22:38
three and that
22:39
is andy's facts that's right my fact is
22:42
that there are a species of wasps the
22:44
size of amoeba
22:45
that's so cool very cool and not special
22:48
giant amoeba either because there are
22:49
giant
22:50
we talked about before on the show yeah
22:51
because i was gonna say there's an
22:52
amoeba
22:53
which is 10 centimeters long exactly so
22:56
no and the smallest dog
22:57
is 9.65 centimeters so
23:01
there are dogs that are smaller than the
23:03
beavers
23:04
so exactly yeah can we can we clarify
23:07
plurals
23:10
yeah so this is a wasp called mega
23:12
fragma my mario penne
23:14
and it's 0.2 millimeters long it's the
23:17
third smallest insect
23:18
known the other two smaller ones are
23:20
also wasps so
23:21
i've just picked this guy because he's
23:23
been studied
23:24
um but it's the size of an amoeba and
23:26
it's got eyes brains
23:27
wings muscle gut so it's obviously made
23:30
up of thousands and thousands and
23:31
thousands of cells
23:33
but it's the size of a one-celled
23:34
organism and it's
23:36
done that there's been a study by a
23:38
scientist called alexei
23:39
polilov and it found that basically
23:41
they're missing huge amounts of stuff
23:42
and they have to cut down on their own
23:44
brains
23:44
and remove all the nuclei from the cells
23:47
inside their skull
23:48
just to make room for a few few neurons
23:51
really
23:51
it's incredibly weird yeah do they have
23:53
nuclei and then they extract them
23:55
as they grow or they just don't have any
23:57
nuclei from the start
23:58
i think it destroys them until it only
24:01
has a few hundred this is what i read
24:03
is it one of these that doesn't really
24:04
need to make that many decisions in life
24:06
yeah it's like it's simple you don't
24:08
need that many neurons right but it's
24:10
got to make it it's only got
24:11
a hundred a hundred perhaps as many as a
24:14
b okay and b's themselves do not make
24:16
that many decisions no flour high
24:19
flour high um it's about the size of a
24:21
human ovum
24:23
that does not help put things in
24:24
perspective think of a humanoid
24:26
[Laughter]
24:29
a very small full stop think of a dot
24:34
think of a million of those i'm afraid
24:35
you've only drawn 999 dots because this
24:38
is a wasp
24:42
the other girl wins the best
24:47
yeah what was the name of the wasp mega
24:49
fragment penny
24:51
um there's another one which is small i
24:53
think it might be smart one of the two
24:55
that's smaller than this one um called
24:57
dicopomorpha
24:58
ecmepter
25:02
something like that and it's the males
25:04
that are really small in this species i
25:05
don't know if it's the same with yours
25:07
and the reason they're so small is
25:08
because basically they never leave the
25:10
egg
25:12
they kind of live inside their egg and
25:15
they
25:15
mate with their sisters inside the egg
25:17
and then the sisters fly off and they
25:19
just die
25:20
oh mate broaden your horizons
25:24
how that's crazy yeah so that's their
25:26
whole life they just they grow up in the
25:28
egg
25:28
they mate with their sisters they die so
25:30
are these parasitic wasps is it their
25:32
own egg they're in or are they in
25:34
someone else's they're in their own egg
25:35
okay yeah but parasitic wafts are
25:38
amazing
25:39
yeah actually you said waps though
25:40
instead of wasps i'll say it again then
25:42
but do you know that wasp used to be
25:44
whops
25:45
really yeah and then it got changed just
25:47
through
25:48
people saying it wrong over the years as
25:50
in it comes from an old
25:51
germanic word waps i i really hope it
25:54
shows an etymology with whoops
25:56
it probably doesn't but it would be nice
25:58
wouldn't it what like whoops i've
26:00
stepped on a
26:01
on a whip
26:02
[Laughter]
26:04
yeah parasitic wasps are totally awesome
26:07
aren't they well there's a piece
26:08
by ed young who writes a lot about uh
26:11
bacteria he writes for the atlantic it's
26:12
a great piece
26:13
he's so good i just want to say he's
26:15
probably my favorite like science
26:16
journalist and you should all look at
26:18
yeah i agree
26:19
all right do you get um do you get his
26:22
weekly email that he sends with all of
26:24
his writings in it
26:29
there's a piece by him um where he's
26:32
saying everyone thinks the beatle is the
26:33
king of the things
26:34
because there are so many species of
26:35
them so he writes a bit better than
26:37
saying the king of the things
26:38
i don't think he does i don't think it's
26:39
possible um
26:41
so there are 380 000 species of beetle
26:44
which is a quarter of all
26:45
animal species which is a lot obviously
26:47
but there's a scientist from the
26:49
university of iowa
26:50
called andrew forbes who reckons that
26:52
there are so many parasitic wasps and
26:54
that every single
26:55
species of insect even has at least one
26:59
and probably several species of tiny
27:01
tiny parasitic wasp inside it
27:02
he reckons that wasps outnumber even
27:04
beetles by about two and a half
27:06
times so is that like if everyone on the
27:08
planet had an average of two hats then
27:10
there has to be more hats than people
27:12
exactly
27:12
okay except the people are beetles and
27:14
the hats are wasps yeah
27:16
exactly yeah there are shed loads of
27:17
wasps given that we don't give them
27:19
enough credit
27:20
i think there are just over five
27:22
thousand species of mammal and
27:23
fourteen thousand of ant and two hundred
27:25
thousand species of wasp
27:27
and even the fig wasps have many
27:29
thousands of
27:30
species of fig wasp don't they so we
27:32
need to pay more attention
27:34
but yeah they're so small they're so
27:35
small that no one notices them even if
27:36
you find a new beetle it's probably got
27:38
loads of wasps living in it yeah that
27:40
you don't know about um there's an
27:41
amazing quote from josephine rodriguez
27:43
who's an entomologist who was responding
27:46
to this discussion about there being
27:47
more wasps than beetles
27:49
and she says it doesn't surprise me at
27:51
all that there are more wasps
27:53
i really think that only people that
27:54
would disagree would be the fly people
27:57
so just like the politics within
27:59
entomology is great i hope erica
28:01
mccallister isn't listening to this
28:03
yeah she's a fly person has she been on
28:04
that planet we've had her on yeah
28:06
yeah she'll be fuming she'll go out and
28:09
find a hundred thousand different
28:10
species of fly today
28:12
um there's a really cool parasitic
28:13
whilst called the green eyed wasp which
28:15
uh
28:16
parasites of a ladybird so it lays its
28:18
eggs inside a ladybird
28:20
and then when they hatch they come out
28:22
and they immediately weave this cocoon
28:23
between this ladybird's legs
28:25
and this paralyzes the ladybug but it
28:26
also sort of possesses the ladybird so
28:28
it turns it into a zombie when you say
28:30
so weaving the cocoon between the legs
28:32
which paralyzes them is it like tying
28:33
someone's shoelaces together it's
28:35
exactly the same as that
28:36
except also if you tie someone's
28:38
shoelaces together and then you injected
28:39
their brain with some kind of chemical
28:41
that turned them into a zombie that is a
28:42
next level prank
28:45
you get two detentions for that one um
28:48
but yeah this is really cool so it's
28:50
this ladybird sits there and it's
28:52
possessed which means it twitches
28:53
involuntarily which scares away any
28:55
potential predators
28:56
so it's just standing there like this
28:57
great fort with the babies all
28:59
in between its legs and then they crack
29:02
out and leave and the ladybird i guess
29:03
dies
29:04
no not true really a quarter of the
29:06
ladybirds recover
29:08
and some of them are even parasitized
29:10
again oh yeah if you want to hear about
29:12
my favorite messed up wasp yes please
29:16
oh no it's not it's a fly anywhere erica
29:19
will love this okay
29:21
it's this is the smallest fly that
29:23
exists okay okay
29:25
and it feeds on itself really tiny ants
29:28
not even normal size ants really small
29:30
ants
29:30
and what it does is it the egg hatches
29:33
inside the ant
29:34
parasitic fly it goes into the head of
29:36
the ant
29:37
from inside and it starts eating it
29:40
so it feeds on the uh the muscles that
29:43
control the mouth parts which are very
29:44
big and muscular bits so the ant then
29:46
can't chew so he's walking around
29:47
thinking i can't chew anymore
29:49
and then this tiny fly eats the brain
29:52
so they now can't think anymore but i
29:54
can't even think i can't do anymore
29:56
yeah exactly so but it stays walking
29:58
around it walks around for another
30:00
fortnight while this flies
30:01
inside it eating it and then finally the
30:04
fly lava dissolves the membrane which
30:05
keeps the ants head on
30:07
and the ant's head comes off and then
30:09
the fly just lives in the
30:10
decapitated head for another fortnight
30:12
which i think is the most goth thing
30:13
i can possibly imagine how cool is that
30:16
and then once it's an adult it just
30:17
leaves the head leaves this decapitated
30:19
head longer
30:20
how insane it's all up isn't it
30:22
it's horrible
30:23
you know that it's so up it made
30:24
charles darwin question his belief in
30:26
god
30:27
um parasitic wasps he wrote a letter to
30:30
a
30:31
fellow naturalist asa gray said i cannot
30:33
persuade myself that the beneficent and
30:35
omnipotent god would have desiredly
30:38
created parasitic wasps
30:39
he used the technical term uh with the
30:41
express intention of their feeding
30:43
within the living bodies of caterpillars
30:46
yeah wow it's a good point it's not a
30:48
nice thing to do
30:49
if there is a god he's a goth he then
30:51
goes on to say
30:52
or that a cat should play with mice so
30:56
that also seemed to upset him quite a
30:57
lot as well oh no they're just having
30:59
fun cats are nice
31:00
we've all seen tom and jerry
31:02
unfortunately he didn't live to see that
31:03
terror
31:04
do you want to hear my favorite
31:05
paracetamol yeah oh we've all got one
31:08
it's so nice
31:09
so it's asakode's abitassis and it's a
31:12
parasitic wasp which lays its
31:14
eggs in another wasp which is called
31:16
dibraccis bucchianos
31:19
and then that lays its eggs in the pupae
31:21
of a species of ichneumonodye wasps
31:24
which then lays its eggs in the
31:26
caterpillar of the cricopia moth
31:28
which lives and feeds in a popular wild
31:31
cherry or apple tree
31:32
so that means it's a parasite inside a
31:34
parasite instead of parasites inside a
31:36
parasite inside a tree
31:38
wow i think this is where my hat
31:40
metaphor falls down
31:42
it's uh it's the inception of the wasp
31:45
world yeah
31:46
i think it's the most disgusting russian
31:47
doll you could ever think of
31:50
um what do you want to know my least
31:52
favorite wasp
31:53
it's the tarantula hawk and it's a type
31:56
of wasp
31:57
and it has the worst sting probably of
31:59
any wasp
32:01
and the recommendation if you're stung
32:03
by this wasp and this is in a peer
32:05
review journal
32:06
is to lie down and start screaming
32:10
what does that do well apparently what
32:12
happens is it's so painful
32:14
that you're not going to be able to
32:16
maintain verbal or physical coordination
32:18
after you're stung and you're likely to
32:20
just kind of run off and hurt yourself
32:22
also
32:22
lie down and so the best thing to do is
32:24
just lie down and scream and hopefully
32:25
someone will come and help you oh my god
32:28
wow it's such a good name as well is it
32:31
a tarantula is it a hawk
32:32
no it's a wasp
32:34
[Laughter]
32:35
the smallest fly in the world is named
32:38
after arnold schwarzenegger
32:40
nice is that an ironic kind of thing no
32:42
it's because it's got big arms
32:47
it's a smart it's a tiny fly with
32:48
massive arms it's 0.395 millimeters long
32:51
and its arms are big
32:52
relative to its body it's not the size
32:55
of arnie you don't just see a pair of
32:56
arms lying on the ground a tiny thing in
32:58
between them
32:59
and the scientist who discovered it
33:00
brian brown said as soon as i saw those
33:02
bulging legs i knew i had to name this
33:03
one after arnold legs
33:05
it doesn't have of course they don't
33:06
have arms they've got thunder they've
33:08
got front legs haven't they is that what
33:10
you call your abs that's what i call my
33:11
eyes
33:13
i've never known why you walk on all
33:14
fours
33:17
but we're all all mammals have two arms
33:19
and two legs or four legs but i believe
33:21
flies are not mammals
33:24
[Laughter]
33:31
[Applause]
33:35
we should go on to fact number four and
33:37
that is james's facts okay my fact this
33:39
week
33:40
is when patonk players getting to fight
33:42
it is known in the french press
33:44
as booleganism it was amazing
33:48
love it that's very good so i read this
33:51
in a recent telegraph article
33:53
and it is all about how they're trying
33:55
to smarten up the reputation
33:56
of the sport of patonk which is french
33:59
bull
34:00
uh so for anyone who doesn't know that
34:02
it's basically you have a big iron ball
34:05
oh it's not that big it's about the size
34:06
of a cricket ball um
34:08
iron ball and you throw it towards a
34:10
small wooden jack and whoever gets
34:11
closest wins
34:12
uh and they're trying to smarten it up
34:14
they've stopped people from wearing
34:15
jeans
34:16
uh and also they're trying to stop this
34:18
booleganism which is
34:20
alcohol-fueled brawls between players
34:22
which has been
34:23
tarnishing the sport for the last few
34:26
years
34:27
yeah and it's an extremely traditional
34:29
french yeah
34:30
i've seen people playing it people
34:32
playing in a square
34:34
near where i used to live on the piste
34:36
i've been to play in that square it's
34:37
brilliant in south london very nice you
34:39
love it yeah and you you hire the
34:40
equipment out from the pub did you get
34:42
into any fights huge brawls
34:44
i'm not allowed back to south london
34:46
actually well i thought this
34:48
i thought this can't possibly be true
34:49
but it goes back about 10 years so in
34:51
2017 some referees had to be given
34:53
special protection
34:54
from boolegans uh there were death
34:57
threats at the world cup in 2016.
34:59
yeah it's just there are so many stories
35:01
one team said they were going to rip
35:02
their heads off another team
35:03
exactly let them win and then the
35:05
tournaments organizers said this sort of
35:06
incident happens quite often in petonk
35:08
in response to that
35:10
there was one guy who got a 200 euro
35:12
fine and a four-year ban for hurling a
35:14
bull at his rival
35:17
hard balls they're super hard aren't
35:19
they
35:20
you don't want that um there was i think
35:22
one guy according to
35:24
an economist article was jailed for
35:26
shooting dead a potonk rival
35:28
when one of his bulls landed on his foot
35:30
what what year was this
35:32
uh it didn't say it just said in
35:34
brackets it was an economist article
35:35
about baton and i was just like
35:36
for instance the guy from grenoble who
35:38
was jailed for shooting dead arrival
35:39
when his bull landed on his foot
35:41
close brackets no more information oh my
35:43
god so i found
35:45
three examples of people who've died in
35:47
the last 10 years playing patonk and i
35:48
was not looking for them they just kept
35:50
coming off in my search
35:53
one of them was trampled by a runaway
35:55
circus elephant though
35:56
so i don't know if that counts as it's
35:59
the dangers of patong
36:00
that's what eventually cleared us off
36:01
the south london right
36:04
actually this thing about them um not
36:06
being able to wear jeans it's
36:07
annoyed a lot of patonk players and one
36:10
player has protested by turning up to an
36:11
official tournament game dressed as a
36:13
clown
36:14
which now i hear about it seems a little
36:16
bit too soon almost
36:18
yeah although at least if another
36:20
player's ball lands on your shoe
36:21
it probably won't hurt your foot
36:22
[Laughter]
36:25
um there is one thing that potonk
36:27
players are now
36:28
allowed to do which they weren't a
36:29
little while ago okay which is to drink
36:32
during matches and this is competition
36:34
players
36:35
and yes you're right they are trying to
36:36
professionalize aren't they because they
36:37
want it to be an olympic thing
36:38
but they did persuade the world like
36:41
this is a very french thing
36:42
they did persuade the world anti-doping
36:44
agency it is okay to have a glass of
36:47
pastis or whatever during a a
36:50
competition
36:50
and they've been allowed to as of 2008
36:52
but they are still asked to abstain from
36:54
steroids
36:55
growth hormones heroin and cocaine
36:59
i can't imagine heroin is going to help
37:01
you play for tonight that much
37:02
so it's a slow game i mean steroids
37:06
aren't going to help you either oh come
37:08
on you can get some proper power in your
37:10
if you're
37:10
really big you can just kind of lean
37:12
over and put the ball down
37:14
it doesn't make your arms lengthen yeah
37:16
i don't really
37:18
really i think of stretch armstrong i
37:20
can't get over how flawed both of your
37:21
arguments are
37:23
andy stories don't lengthen your arms
37:24
and james it's not really a game of
37:25
power
37:26
look we'll have a game soon
37:30
but a lot there are a few different
37:31
shots you can play one way you just try
37:32
and get it close to the jack and another
37:34
one where you try and bash the other
37:35
guy's ball out of the way oh yeah you
37:36
can
37:36
it's kind of like quidditch is it yeah
37:39
because in quidditch there are people
37:40
who are trying to
37:41
um score points and those are the people
37:44
in baton rouge who are shooting for the
37:45
jack the tiny wooden thing yeah and then
37:47
you've also got shooters in patong who
37:50
are the
37:51
you would be the bludgers who try to you
37:52
know but they just attack
37:54
people i mean they played it on titan
37:56
look every analogy breaks down
37:58
eventually i'm just saying
37:59
you've got scorers and knockers do you
38:03
talking of knockers can we talk about
38:04
kissing the funny
38:07
smooth thanks um so kissing the funny
38:11
is when if you if you lose a match 30
38:14
nil you then have to kiss the funny um
38:17
which is where you ideally have to kiss
38:19
the bare bottom of a lady called funny
38:22
but as there isn't always one available
38:25
[Laughter]
38:26
you can kiss a picture of the bottom of
38:29
a lady called fanny or quite often they
38:31
have like small statues
38:33
of fannies nearby that you can kiss the
38:36
bottom of
38:36
so do you is that part of the equipment
38:38
list for a match i assume it is
38:41
or a picture every club has its own
38:43
model fanny norm in france
38:45
wow they have been specially made there
38:48
was
38:48
there was a match where someone lost
38:49
very badly and a local
38:52
uh waitress i think called fanny said
38:54
you'll have to kiss me on the cheek if
38:55
you lose and then when the male lost
38:56
really really badly
38:58
she said well you have to kiss me on the
38:59
bum now at some
39:01
clubs in provence have special rugs to
39:03
kneel on while you're kissing
39:04
the statuette of the woman called fanny
39:07
on the ass
39:08
yeah it's a weird prayer
39:11
do you know why england is not so good
39:13
at potonk
39:15
is it because we have crown green
39:17
bowling or tempin bowling so we don't
39:19
really play it as much
39:19
that's a nice idea i think well my
39:22
theory as to why it's it's why we're not
39:24
a world leading patong power
39:26
is that we like to wear jeans a lot so
39:29
we won't be able to play anymore that's
39:31
another one this is a bit more
39:32
historical is that edward iii
39:33
for bad people from playing legally
39:36
you were not allowed to play especially
39:38
if you were an archer and this goes back
39:40
you know loads of sports were banned
39:42
if you were an archer because you had to
39:43
be doing your archery practice
39:45
but um until the 18th century artificers
39:48
laborers apprentices and servants were
39:50
banned from playing
39:52
any time outside christmas really yeah
39:55
which is not good
39:56
for training and also yeah because in
39:58
christmas the
39:59
the ground's going to be cold yes snowy
40:01
maybe so you might not be able to play
40:03
anyway
40:03
playing conditions good point yeah yeah
40:05
it was thought of as a
40:07
kind of corrupt sport wasn't it like
40:09
only people have ill-repute played it
40:11
was associated with saloons and gambling
40:13
and stuff like that
40:14
all back to the gambling thing um well
40:18
you say that
40:18
britain isn't a patonk powerhouse but we
40:21
do have teams
40:22
in 2002 purcell sponsored and paid for
40:25
the kit of the british nude patonk team
40:28
paid for the kid yes so i think it was
40:31
mostly sweat buns
40:34
rehearsal personal so the exactly the
40:37
clothes detergent brand
40:38
why do you ass why would you associate
40:42
yourself with something as risque as
40:43
nude
40:44
risque and also not terribly popular i
40:46
imagine
40:47
personal makes your clothes disappear i
40:49
mean what are they trying to do do they
40:50
turn up to competition saying look we're
40:51
not wearing jeans
40:53
i've got a quote from pat thompson the
40:55
team manager and president of british
40:57
naturism
40:58
we might not have a beckham or an owen
41:00
but landing this sponsorship is set to
41:02
boost the profile of nitrous patonk
41:05
just as we go head to head with the
41:06
world cup
41:08
heads ahead um
41:12
what year was that 2002. and c did
41:14
anyone pay attention to that world cup i
41:16
think not
41:17
um plant kind of advertises itself as
41:19
being good for kind of all ages all
41:21
genders it's not a super physically
41:22
testing sport
41:23
even to the extent that you can buy
41:27
magnets attached to cords so you can
41:29
pick up the balls without having to bend
41:31
down
41:32
and this is
41:36
exactly yeah but it won't pick up the
41:38
wooden one will it
41:39
no no god you're right what do you do
41:41
about that
41:43
long hoover uh you can get those claw
41:46
things that park rangers have
41:48
you know yeah that's called a piglet
41:51
it's called a cochonette that little
41:52
wooden thing yes or
41:54
like we would call it a check right yes
41:56
um one of
41:57
england's best players is called jack
41:59
blows
42:00
really nice that's really cool so prior
42:03
to researching this did anyone else
42:05
assume that patonk was an onomatopoeic
42:08
name
42:09
yeah but donk i mean it is onomatopoeic
42:11
i just wasn't named for that
42:12
yeah just not intentionally so there was
42:14
an old man who loved to play bull which
42:16
involved taking three steps and then
42:17
throwing your ball
42:18
he had terrible rheumatism so as if he
42:20
could do it sitting down
42:22
um his friend said yes and they agreed
42:24
to be stationary when they threw the
42:26
ball as well
42:27
and that is patonk which comes from the
42:29
provence words
42:30
ped tanko which means feet still yeah
42:34
and i think that's really nice as an
42:35
origin because it originates in
42:38
basically
42:39
early disability rights right because it
42:41
used to be much more active so i think
42:42
in provence it was called provence long
42:45
and you threw the ball really far it was
42:47
often about throwing the ball quite a
42:48
long way and the ball for some reason i
42:50
couldn't discover was sheathed in
42:51
nails and it resulted in so many
42:54
injuries in the 18th and 19th centuries
42:55
that it was banned almost everywhere
42:57
so sorry can i just say so the nails the
43:00
spiky bit is on the inside right yeah
43:03
because the way you said it it could
43:04
have possibly been
43:06
sticking out so it's basically cork and
43:09
then you would stick a load of nails
43:10
so that the outside of it was the heads
43:12
of the nails and so that's how you got
43:13
your iron kind of ball
43:15
so that's you got how you got the weight
43:16
or whatever yeah so it's not like a you
43:18
know a hedgehog or something
43:19
yeah got it that would be that would be
43:20
very dangerous though yeah but maybe
43:22
more fun
43:23
um to use a hedgehog no no i was
43:26
thinking of the sticky outfall
43:28
oh sorry yeah i was thinking oh this is
43:29
alice in wonderland i'm sure i've read
43:31
this before
43:31
with a real piglet um well you know why
43:35
they
43:36
the metal balls came about from the
43:38
technology of the first world war
43:39
so sort of making small mines and bombs
43:41
and stuff
43:42
um using that technology that was
43:44
improved in the first world war they
43:46
could then make patonk balls wow
43:48
yeah i don't know it was good for
43:50
something it was
43:52
you know war what is it good for
43:55
[Laughter]
43:57
finally we've answered the question um
43:59
patonk bowls
44:00
are dangerous objects officially
44:03
um according to the federal
44:06
transportation safety administration
44:08
you're not allowed to take them onto
44:09
aircrafts
44:11
oh yeah did you find an example of that
44:14
no i found a guy who he's a star player
44:16
from jersey
44:17
keith bowliad and he had his luggage
44:19
seized on route to a big competition in
44:21
denmark
44:22
because it had three suspicious looking
44:24
perfectly round
44:25
iron balls in it and obviously they
44:28
thought oh this could be a bomb what is
44:29
it
44:30
and he had to borrow another set and
44:31
someone else's trousers because he
44:32
travelled in jeans
44:35
and the empire wouldn't let him play in
44:37
the competition so
44:39
his game suffered very badly because he
44:40
was playing with a set he wasn't
44:41
familiar with the way it's important and
44:43
different trousers
44:45
yeah do you think it's important to like
44:47
use your own balls oh
44:49
he's well he says that they have
44:50
slightly different weightings and
44:51
slightly
44:53
possibly even different sizes or just
44:54
just that he was used to his the feel of
44:56
his own balls
44:57
he did sometimes
45:05
okay we should wrap up thanks so much
45:07
for listening uh we'll be back again
45:09

45:10

hello and welcome to another episode of
00:17
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:19
this week coming to you from the qi
00:21
offices in covent garden
00:23
my name is dan schreiber and i'm sitting
00:25
here with anna chazinski
00:26
andrew hunter murray james harkin and
00:28
special guest alan
00:30
davies and once again we've gathered
00:31
around the microphone with our four
00:33
favorite facts this time about the world
00:34
cup and in no particular order
00:36
here we go starting with you alan
00:39
austria qualified for the 1938 world cup
00:42
but then had to withdraw because
00:44
it stopped existing as a country it's a
00:47
good excuse
00:49
that's a good excuse and it was the 30s
00:52
there was a lot of that kind of
00:53
philosophy
00:54
i've had an existential crisis in the
00:56
camp
00:58
they're not sure they exist and on that
01:00
basis they've withdrawn also they have
01:01
been annexed by germany
01:03
[Laughter]
01:06
tiny thing the angelus not a big deal
01:07
guys but we won't be
01:09
there um yeah so that's germany claimed
01:11
austria right
01:12
yeah but they had qualified you had to
01:14
qualify in that year in 38 quite a lot
01:16
of teams entered so they've gone to a
01:18
lot of trouble
01:19
only to be annexed in the in the
01:21
preamble to the tournament
01:23
yeah and they were very good weren't
01:24
they in that they were then
01:26
sort of the german team and the austrian
01:29
team then came together so they still
01:30
eventually played a lot of the players
01:32
some of the players yes some of the
01:34
players went a bit more
01:35
van trap about it did they just would
01:37
not have it oh really
01:39
yeah yeah and actually the players who
01:41
played didn't get on with the germans
01:43
and they all fell out and they ended up
01:44
losing
01:45
quite early didn't they did they yes
01:47
yeah um do you know what happened to the
01:48
trophy during the second world war oh no
01:52
probably melted down i presume it was
01:53
under someone's bed was it
01:55
yeah it was in a shoebox under an
01:57
italian official's bed
01:58
really yeah cause i think did italy win
02:01
1938 when it happened elsewhere didn't
02:02
it happen in france yeah
02:04
so france took it after austria stopped
02:05
being a thing yeah and then um
02:07
i think italy won and so an italian
02:09
official just looked after it well italy
02:12
won in 34
02:13
and the suspicion was that mussolini
02:15
chose all the referees for their matches
02:19
and in 34 austria came forth behind
02:22
germany
02:22
so as presumably they hope the combined
02:25
might of austria and germany
02:27
uruguay who had staged the tournament
02:28
1930 and won it then sultan didn't come
02:31
yeah because none of the european teams
02:33
went to uruguay
02:35
four of them turned out it's such a
02:36
strop it's so immature
02:38
oh you didn't come to my party
02:42
but when they did come back they won it
02:43
again do you know what happened when
02:45
austria did drop out in 1938 so
02:47
obviously that left a gap
02:48
and the runners-up were latvia who
02:51
should have replaced austria then in the
02:52
tournament
02:53
and the uh people were just like no
02:55
we'll just do without it's fine and they
02:57
just gave sweden a buy
02:58
through the rounds instead of letting
02:59
latvia play at all they just decided
03:01
right not at all again i'm beginning to
03:03
think that these fifa guys are not
03:05
completely
03:06
fair and honest i'm sorry did they not
03:09
offer
03:10
do they not offer for england to take
03:12
part oh maybe they did yes england
03:13
refused
03:14
england refused on the grounds at the
03:16
home international tournament between
03:17
england scotland wales and northern
03:19
ireland was of a higher standard and a
03:20
more significant event
03:24
i'm not even making that amazing we have
03:26
our own international tournament
03:29
this wouldn't even go it takes place
03:31
entirely within our nation
03:33
on our little island where everything's
03:35
better
03:36
and this austrian team they were so good
03:38
they were kind of beating everyone at
03:39
the time not
03:40
england they came up to england and lost
03:42
but they were beating everyone else by
03:43
quite a lot
03:44
and they had a new system that no one
03:46
else used and it was a two
03:47
three five system so two defenders three
03:51
in midfield and five strikers which
03:53
is long been claimed to have been
03:54
invented by herbert chapman at
03:56
arsenal is that right and uh england
03:58
didn't go into the world cup
03:59
arsenal played italy at highbury
04:02
i say arsenal it was it was england but
04:04
they had seven arsenal players in
04:06
and won the game won the game three
04:09
two would you say that the current
04:11
england team is basically tottenham
04:12
basically yeah so we're doomed
04:15
the underground three two it became
04:16
known as the battle of hybri
04:18
oh really and uh and it was decided by
04:20
arsenal supporters at the time that
04:22
therefore we were officially the world
04:23
champions
04:24
have been beaten italy and that was with
04:27
a 5-3-2
04:29
yeah it was a it was a revolutionary
04:31
system has any team ever played
04:33
all up front like ten one-two thing
04:36
yeah it's worth a try right yeah
04:40
so uh 1938 fifa world cup uh the draw
04:44
was selected
04:45
by jules rimett who was the founder of
04:48
the world cup
04:51
interesting fact it's remit yeah
04:58
got his grandson to do the draw from a
05:00
bowl
05:01
it was his grandmother on top of the
05:02
table pick them out and that's how the
05:04
now
05:05
the draw nowadays can be seen from space
05:07
and more technology is used in it than
05:09
was used on the apollo moon landing
05:11
oh come on is that played just two
05:13
things you say about almost
05:14
every single fact we ever have and it's
05:16
also it's bigger than a blue one
05:18
it does sound like a qi script
05:22
they did reveal the logo though for this
05:23
world cup up in the international space
05:25
station so it was the russian cosmonauts
05:27
who
05:27
uh yeah and this uh this year's
05:31
match ball has been to space so it just
05:33
came back down in fact it was made in
05:34
pakistan
05:35
sent up to the iss so no one kicked it
05:37
up did they
05:38
no oh sorry they kicked it while it was
05:41
up
05:41
right did they who fit into the rocket
05:44
as the rocket was just leaving yeah
05:45
that one did yeah only beckham could do
05:47
this yeah can i check something with you
05:49
so you've said the match ball now that
05:52
to me gives the impression there's only
05:53
one ball for the whole world cup
05:55
and i know that can't be true obviously
05:57
yeah i think this is the main
05:59
the um what would you call it the
06:01
signature ball yeah the one they'll
06:03
probably use in the first game in the
06:04
final i guess
06:05
but they'll use they'll have lots of
06:06
balls in every game that's a good call
06:08
though
06:08
they'd probably be like we really need
06:10
to wrap up these penalties with england
06:12
and brazil
06:12
the italian german match needs to happen
06:16
i've got a fact about the 1930 world cup
06:18
okay
06:19
which is um the original and the best
06:21
the original yeah
06:22
the uruguayans say that don't they so it
06:24
was in uruguay and
06:25
um it was a not a very advanced world
06:28
cup
06:29
so for example there was a match between
06:31
brazil and bolivia where everyone was
06:32
wearing white
06:35
were they just cricketers who got on the
06:36
wrong pitch but there was there was one
06:39
way of telling which is that half the
06:40
bolivians were wearing berets as well
06:43
if you kicked it to a guy wearing a
06:45
berry there was a one in two
06:46
on your chances that's really good
06:50
no if you kicked it to a guy right there
06:52
was a hundred percent chance he was on
06:53
your team if you're oblivious yeah it's
06:54
just that it was uh
06:56
one in three chance i guess if you
06:58
kicked it to a guy without worrying this
06:59
is the sort of pedantry
07:06
[Laughter]
07:13
no you're right you're gonna get home
07:14
and go they do it they actually
07:16
pulled him up on it
07:19
we were talking about um so england in
07:21
the world cup and british teams in the
07:23
world cup have a good history so
07:24
scotland
07:26
basically got in but didn't quite in
07:29
1950
07:30
so in 1950 it was so weird fifa really
07:32
wanted british teams to be playing in
07:34
the world cup because they were still
07:35
being really snooty with this whole
07:36
britain's better thing
07:37
and so they said that if they played
07:39
their home championship
07:41
the winner and the runner-up could play
07:43
in the world cup
07:44
would both qualify and scotland said
07:46
that's insulting
07:47
if we win we'll play in it if we run her
07:49
up we refuse and so
07:51
they played their games and they both
07:53
smashed wales and northern ireland
07:55
and then england beat scotland and
07:57
scotland ran back to fifa and said
07:58
please we didn't mean it please
08:02
and fifa didn't they were like i'm
08:03
really sorry you gave us your word
08:05
you said it was only if you won it
08:07
you're out and that was the end of
08:08
scotland in the world cup
08:10
have they never won it since then
08:12
they've never won it
08:14
i don't want it you can't win it if you
08:15
don't qualify you see right got it
08:17
mm-hmm they used to qualify i mean my
08:19
school days it was always scotland in
08:21
and not england in the 70s they used to
08:23
be on a level poking actually didn't
08:24
they
08:24
yeah england had a policy of refusing to
08:26
pick their best players on the grounds
08:28
that they had long hair and i'm not even
08:29
making them
08:31
so people like stan bowles and rodney
08:34
marsh who had long hair
08:35
and frank worthington who were all the
08:37
most skillful players in the first
08:39
division because they didn't have a
08:40
short back and sides and played cards
08:43
they would pick people who looked like
08:45
they were in the army because most of
08:46
the managers had been
08:48
they also would not pick maverick
08:50
managers who were clever and inventive
08:52
like gareth southgate yeah the tradition
08:55
of the english manager looks good in a
08:56
blazer
08:58
i mean he's never seen andy look so
09:00
confused all the
09:01
references that you've made not know
09:03
what's going on
09:04
good news though andy you've got quite
09:05
short hair oh great well imagine i'll
09:08
make it then right
09:08
yeah in the 70s everything changed in
09:11
the fashion front so people started
09:13
growing their hair long and england
09:14
failed to qualify in 1974 in 1978 and
09:17
i'm convinced it's because all the best
09:18
players
09:19
had long hair and the older men were
09:21
offended and then in the world covered
09:23
in 1978 the leading scorer had really a
09:25
loads of hair
09:28
and i think he had his ear pierced and
09:30
his name was mario
09:34
and he gave the lie and his partner in
09:36
crime his fellow center forward and a
09:38
headband i mean that absolutely gave the
09:39
light a short back and sides being
09:40
essential for winning football matches
09:42
yeah okay that's our excuse that's our
09:44
excuse in the 70s
09:46
what about the 80s and 90s we've got
09:49
loads of people who were like we even
09:50
have people with mullets
09:51
when we got to the semi-final that's
09:53
true and in fact it was one of the
09:54
mullets chris waterloo blasted his
09:56
penalty over the bar
09:58
i'm just thinking about the current
09:59
squad there's not much long hair there
10:00
is a
10:01
so no time to change yeah what matters
10:04
now
10:04
are tattoos how many arm sleeves have
10:06
you got and how many piercings do they
10:08
want more or less
10:09
yeah more the more i mean lionel messi
10:12
who's the best player that's ever played
10:13
football has had one of his legs from
10:15
the knee down entirely blacked out
10:17
wow yeah so they can't see it on the
10:19
field
10:21
in night matches it just looks like
10:23
there's a floating boot going around
10:24
with him
10:27
as if he's not good enough as it is this
10:29
boot is now detached from his body
10:32
doesn't messy have really dodgy legs or
10:34
something like he had
10:35
polio or something as a child he did he
10:38
was and he took
10:39
tons of drugs he had to have lots and
10:41
lots of
10:43
yes hormones for growth growth almost
10:45
and some people think that's a little
10:47
bit naughty
10:48
well i'm not sure about that when he
10:50
came from argentina when he was about 11
10:51
or 12
10:52
as this kind of mercurial prodigy and he
10:54
went to barcelona and uh
10:56
they said he's brilliantly too small and
10:59
then one of the coaches saw him and said
11:00
no he really is brilliant
11:02
what were we going to do about him and
11:03
then they did they had him on growth
11:04
hormones until he was about 13.
11:06
but he's still only five foot seven yeah
11:08
that's not worked that well
11:09
you don't know who he is he's not like
11:11
michael jordan you actually think he's
11:13
that small because half his legs are
11:14
blacked out yeah
11:15
you can't see his legs and that's
11:17
actually major
11:18
[Laughter]
11:24
okay it is time for fact number two and
11:27
that is cecinski
11:28
my fact is that this year argentina's
11:30
football association gave its players a
11:32
world cup
11:33
manual with a chapter on how to pick up
11:35
russian women
11:37
so this is a it was a book that was
11:38
given out to journalists and players and
11:40
coaches
11:41
uh in argentina and it was like a course
11:43
about how to adapt to russian culture
11:44
and there was an entire chapter
11:46
that was titled how to stand a chance
11:48
with a russian girl
11:49
and uh included advice like make sure
11:52
you're clean
11:52
smell good and dress well because
11:55
apparently
11:56
argentinian men love like filthy
11:58
smelling women
11:59
can i just say as someone married to a
12:01
russian i'm not sure they're bothered
12:02
about cleanliness
12:03
dressed well we haven't sits before well
12:06
are they bothered about this james the
12:08
booklet also said
12:09
russian girls hate boring men never ask
12:12
trite questions be original
12:14
i'm wondering if my wife actually is
12:15
russian
12:18
it also said that they don't like to be
12:19
seen as objects which is singular to
12:21
russian women but
12:22
apparently is true of them um but yeah
12:25
this was in their booklet and then
12:27
apparently argentina got word of it from
12:29
some of the journalists and went and
12:30
ripped all the pages out of this booklet
12:32
and said oh god that wasn't meant to be
12:33
in there sorry uh it was a mistake
12:35
mistakenly included
12:36
and it's no longer there i found a bit
12:38
of uh so there's a problem that um
12:40
moscow's parliament have been telling
12:41
people to be smart
12:42
for the world cup okay and this is
12:44
travelers i think i think it's fans
12:46
arriving
12:46
and there are on the spot fines in
12:48
moscow if you don't adhere to these
12:50
rules
12:50
and there's 500 rubles which is the
12:52
maximum which is about six quid yes
12:54
so you can actually oh that's great no
12:56
jeans no trainers
12:58
yeah it's like a nightclub it's like a
12:59
big nightclub
13:02
your name's not down you're not coming
13:04
in it definitely is one
13:06
they've had that down for years if your
13:09
name's not there you're not getting out
13:10
yeah but it's um with visas this time
13:14
uh obviously when you go into a country
13:17
like russia you need a visa but fans
13:18
won't need a visa they have a fan visa
13:20
which is automatically given to them
13:22
if they can show they have a ticket yeah
13:24
that's quite cool to prove interest or
13:25
knowledge
13:26
in football just need a ticket yeah i
13:28
just need to take it but andy you
13:29
wouldn't enjoy it there's no point i
13:31
don't know
13:31
i don't have a ticket either right the
13:33
amount of information you have to give
13:35
on the official ticket website to get a
13:37
ticket oh really oh really
13:38
it's yeah it makes mark zuckerberg with
13:40
absolutely
13:43
and you virtually have to give your
13:44
parents details what are the what sort
13:46
of
13:59
we're not here to discuss that people
14:02
aren't tense about this one right didn't
14:03
the
14:04
the about this love island i know i am
14:07
yeah kendall was robbed i saw kendall
14:10
this morning in the flesh
14:11
did she at the this morning studios oh
14:14
she is very very small
14:16
and one of her legs is completely
14:17
invisible
14:21
never been seen in the same room as leon
14:24
or messi it's fascinating
14:25
to go out on the dawn of the tournament
14:30
the greatest conspiracy theory yet heard
14:31
on this show kendall matthews that's the
14:33
claim
14:35
um no the head of policing of football
14:37
policing in the uk has warned
14:39
the brits basically not to be to aggro
14:41
haven't haven't they in russia so they
14:42
said
14:43
uh don't wave some george's flags around
14:46
um
14:46
don't don't drink lager and zigzag don't
14:49
drink
14:51
um there's a security expert a man who
14:53
calls himself a security expert he's a
14:55
director
14:55
of the university of buckingham center
14:57
for security intelligence he's called
14:58
anthony gleese
15:00
but he did an interview with the express
15:01
so i wonder how reliable he is but he
15:04
warned well after he's been through the
15:06
prism of the express
15:08
anything could happen and when did he
15:10
say the world's going to end up
15:12
and where is princess
15:16
he seriously said that um english
15:19
footballers need to look out for russian
15:21
women who are actually spies disguised
15:23
as women trying to seduce them
15:25
because he said if there's one way to
15:26
scupper england's chances even more
15:28
it'll be through honey traps by leading
15:30
the players on with gorgeous russian
15:32
girls
15:32
that's that right i've heard the english
15:34
team are going for a 10 naught naught
15:36
formation this world cup
15:38
that's one point i don't know how you
15:39
jeopardize it maybe you give them an std
15:40
or something that um
15:44
yeah well apparently paraguayan
15:45
prostitutes tried to seduce venezuelan
15:47
players in the
15:48
qualifiers of this world cup and yeah
15:52
what to what well it was weird because
15:54
actually neither team could qualify at
15:55
that point
15:58
but apparently a load of prostitutes
15:59
made it into their hotel lobby
16:01
and um they claimed that they were
16:03
trying to seduce them
16:05
but to to sort of to tie them out before
16:07
the big match i suppose that might
16:08
happen
16:09
because it might it sounds like they
16:10
were just prostitutes doing their job
16:11
and these were just men who wanted to
16:12
shag prostitutes
16:14
yeah it does sound like that this is an
16:15
away trip that all the paragon squad
16:17
were available for
16:19
who wants to go to venezuela for the
16:20
dead rubber me me
16:23
the dead rubber is that a prostitution
16:25
phrase
16:27
it may also be but in this context
16:31
that's what gets thrown out the window
16:33
but isn't it true that
16:37
but actually people think that you
16:38
shouldn't have sex before football
16:40
matches right well i've heard
16:41
not footballers footballers don't think
16:43
that no but sometimes
16:45
people in charge of them think that it
16:46
doesn't really affect your performance
16:48
actually
16:48
no i don't think so there is a there's a
16:52
football health coach called nick little
16:54
hails who's cristiano ronaldo's sleep
16:55
coach as well as a bunch of other people
16:57
sorry cristiano ronaldo's sleep coach
16:59
yeah right go to sleep
17:10
but he says it's crap that athlete
17:12
shouldn't have sex before big games
17:13
but he just says they do need to sleep
17:15
solo so what he says is i guess they
17:17
should have sex but then their partners
17:18
need to get up and go and sleep in a
17:20
separate room like in kind of tudor
17:21
times
17:22
that's the idea um and he introduced
17:24
sleeping pods
17:25
so cristiano ronaldo uh at he's uh real
17:28
madrid
17:29
at the moment hasn't he yeah real madrid
17:31
has sleeping pods
17:33
and every player has their own sleeping
17:34
pod i imagine them all in orbit somehow
17:37
yeah yeah they're brought in back into
17:39
the atmosphere
17:40
yes each man launched back into orbit
17:43
yeah that big dry ice
17:46
then they get woken up yeah where am i
17:49
what year is it
17:50
you've woken up to us let's wake up
17:53
jennifer lawrence
17:55
he's not here but that paragon
17:58
prostitutes will do
18:00
where the paragraph prostitute pods
18:02
[Laughter]
18:11
okay it's time for fact number three and
18:13
that is james my fact this week
18:15
is that scientists have invented
18:17
anti-diving shin pads
18:19
[Music]
18:22
sense psychologically that you're about
18:24
to dive and they
18:25
hold your body up on the pitch
18:29
in mid-air yeah and the broadcast saying
18:32
i'm fine it didn't touch me
18:34
well what it is i mean they're
18:37
completely useless
18:38
like they're just stupid but they do
18:40
exist there's a sensor in your boot
18:42
there's a sensor in the shin pad
18:43
and um when they touch each other the
18:45
referee has an alarm which will go off
18:47
so he knows that there's been contact
18:50
uh unfortunately the problem is that you
18:51
can foul someone by pushing them in the
18:53
back or whatever so it doesn't like it's
18:54
completely pointless so they need to
18:56
invent anti-diving body suits
18:58
yeah it's like the same technologies you
19:00
have in fencing i guess
19:02
when you know that someone's been hit
19:03
and fencing there's a new version which
19:05
makes your shin pads light up
19:07
when you get kicked kids would love
19:09
light up chimpanzees yeah yeah
19:10
but they'd be constantly kicking each
19:12
other just for them to like kick me kick
19:13
me
19:14
[Laughter]
19:16
kick yourself in this [ __ ] penalty they
19:18
almost brought this in for the khanitha
19:20
world cup which has just happened which
19:21
is the world cup for countries that
19:22
aren't really countries
19:24
which is sponsored by paddy power and
19:25
paddy power wanted to bring in some
19:27
weird ass rules
19:28
you know that were different than normal
19:29
rules and they brought in one thing
19:31
which was a green
19:32
card which means if you get sent off for
19:35
abusing the referee you can work in
19:36
america
19:41
it's very tempting even now the
19:44
state of the united states north koreans
19:46
offending
19:47
referees a lot of mexicans
19:51
what happens if you get send off um for
19:53
the green cards you get sent off but
19:54
they're allowed to bring on a substitute
19:56
so they don't punish the team they
19:57
punish the player so they did that in
19:59
this
19:59
in this world cup you actually went
20:01
didn't you to the kenny
20:03
to the final and to one of the other
20:04
games yeah who did you play
20:07
i saw northern cyprus against abkhazia
20:10
in the first game and then northern
20:12
cyprus against um
20:14
who was it capitalia i can't believe
20:17
abkhazia lost northern cyprus i know
20:19
because i was supporting abkhazia
20:21
actually um so i was like
20:23
it's uh a breakaway area of georgia do
20:26
we know who's won does it finish at the
20:27
same time as the world
20:28
no it finished i went to the final last
20:30
weekend then it was won by capitalia
20:32
which is
20:33
a part of ukraine where hungarians live
20:35
okay
20:36
oh it's not a carpet warehouse
20:39
because it really sounds like one no
20:43
run by italian i'd like to see their
20:44
television ads
20:46
sort of ones where
20:48
[Laughter]
20:59
fully carpeted
21:09
[Music]
21:10
um so on weird football rules i was
21:12
looking into
21:13
um do you know the referee can send
21:15
himself off
21:17
do you know that he needs a wii u
21:21
he doesn't card himself yellow card that
21:23
can't happen can it
21:25
uh it can happen it has happened not in
21:27
um big football games
21:29
um but uh for instance in 2005
21:32
peterborough north end was playing royal
21:35
mail ayl
21:36
uh this was a lower lower leagues
21:39
match and the referee andy wayne got
21:42
really angry there was so someone
21:43
disagree with his decision a player
21:45
disagree with his decision
21:46
and he flung away his whistle and he
21:47
untucked his shirt and he
21:49
ran up and eyeballed the player and then
21:52
immediately he saw the error of his ways
21:54
and he gave himself a red card and set
21:55
himself off wow
21:56
and there was no one to replace him so
21:58
the match had to be cooled off oh
22:00
yeah and then he waited in the car park
22:01
for him
22:04
wow but they can also send off linesman
22:06
which i didn't know
22:08
so this is sometimes they've got so much
22:10
power yeah
22:11
they've got more power than they should
22:12
have um so last year
22:15
um there was dundee beat kilmarnock so
22:18
this was an actual match with teams that
22:19
well it's in scotland it's in scotland
22:21
but it's still real football um many of
22:24
your listeners
22:26
oh my god so naive
22:29
[Laughter]
22:30
when i tour scotland of course they're
22:31
the best shows i have are they
22:36
better than whales don't say that
22:39
minefield
22:42
um so in scotland whom we love all of
22:45
you
22:46
um in this match the rev sent off the
22:49
assistant referee and gave
22:50
him a red card because he was vomiting
22:53
by the side of the pitch
22:55
started vomiting set him off that is a
22:57
bit harsh yeah i think it seems like you
22:58
can't be sent off for vomiting who was
23:00
they vomited before a penalty in the
23:01
world
23:02
sudan yeah that was in the euros
23:05
against england it depends on whether
23:06
it's deliberate and malicious vomiting
23:08
if you don't if you do it in the face of
23:09
the goalkeeper just before a pelican
23:11
he just did it on the pitch he bet he
23:13
put his hands in his knee how's that
23:14
match he put his hands on his knees we
23:16
thought
23:16
what's he doing wow and then he suddenly
23:18
looked up ran up
23:19
smashed it in the net and on the
23:21
television replay you can see when he
23:22
had his hands on his knees he was
23:23
vomiting on the pitch
23:24
like gary linda said he wants to poo on
23:26
the pitch
23:31
there are so many cameras in the ground
23:32
there must be a poo cam there's video of
23:34
him kind of dragging his
23:35
bum on the grass
23:39
and then people tweet him all the time
23:41
just saying just remind me dude
23:46
he never got a yellow card in his whole
23:48
career
23:52
just a tiny bit of personal news we're
23:54
recording this on anna's computer and
23:56
there's a
23:57
alarm that's come up that is to tell her
24:00
she needs to get lu roll and olive oil
24:02
in 25 minutes well the thing is anna
24:04
always shits herself in the middle of
24:05
the podcast
24:09
that's what every paragraph
24:12
takes for the world cup wow i'm not
24:16
extra virgin
24:20
so the penalty was invented by an irish
24:22
guy called william mccrum
24:24
and no one liked it at first because
24:26
they thought how on earth would anyone
24:28
be so low as to deliberately commit a
24:30
foul
24:31
this was in a long time ago yeah and
24:33
they called it the irishman's motion
24:36
but they hmm gary lineker
24:39
i don't know honor of that performed an
24:42
irishman's motion
24:49
okay it is time for our final fact of
24:51
the show and
24:52
that is andy my fact is that in april
24:56
police in lima seized over 20
24:58
000 counterfeit panini football sticker
25:01
albums
25:01
with a street value of 350 000 dollars
25:06
wow great that's amazing yeah and this
25:08
keeps happening it happens all the time
25:09
because they're really
25:10
well only every four years yeah it's
25:12
true but they um
25:14
the police in italy have seized another
25:16
20 000 stickers and they said this could
25:17
be the tip of the iceberg
25:19
every world cup it happens because
25:20
they're quite you know valuable things
25:22
i mean the full ones that are really
25:23
valuable yeah the uh the
25:26
empty ones i guess are valuable too
25:27
because you can vlog them well i went on
25:29
ebay
25:30
uh just to see what the highest you put
25:32
in panini
25:33
sticker and there are empty albums from
25:36
previous world cups uh the highest value
25:38
is sort of 5 000 pounds
25:39
sometimes from for an empty book well
25:41
the empty ones if
25:43
if you can sell on ebay an empty book
25:45
with all the stickers in it
25:46
then that's the best you can get because
25:48
then people get it and they get the
25:49
enjoyment of putting the stickers in i
25:52
understand that
25:53
yeah yeah that's worth thousands money
25:56
to people like me yeah and you do it
25:59
don't you you you've in previous world
26:01
cups called out on twitter to say can we
26:02
swap panini well let's not put this on
26:04
the podcast
26:06
no no i do yeah i do do stickers you
26:08
live in north london don't you inventory
26:10
park and you love
26:11
you love people to approach you with
26:12
football stickers
26:17
did you always do panini because they
26:18
weren't we did a different one when we
26:20
were kids merlin yeah
26:22
i did merlin when they did the bino
26:24
stickers yeah exactly yeah
26:26
but then christina came back in didn't
26:27
it uh panini uh recently has become huge
26:30
yeah well huge in my household
26:32
[Laughter]
26:34
and you're dressed just to be clear do
26:37
you not do stickers alan though no
26:38
not the other one i don't know my little
26:40
boy now is uh
26:41
keen in fact he found some at the bottom
26:44
of a well-known breakfast cereal
26:46
recently oh yeah and i thought
26:47
this is gonna cost me about a grand yeah
26:49
that's pretty much well it will cost you
26:50
773 pounds
26:52
60. to fill a book yep is that it's if
26:54
that is that's if you get every single
26:56
sticker first time
26:57
does that include double buying it's a
26:58
mathematics professor has worked out
27:00
that if you just keep buying and you
27:02
don't do any swaps with anyone it's if
27:04
you have more
27:04
average to complete the album uh but
27:07
apparently if you do have friends it can
27:09
be cheaper it can be cheaper yeah and
27:11
also you can buy stickers direct from
27:12
panini
27:13
yeah your last 50 you can buy yeah but
27:15
they've failed there haven't you
27:17
have you ever i think if you're just
27:18
calling him up saying please can i have
27:21
marcus rashford
27:24
i bought 5 000
27:27
well that's what happened music magpie
27:29
decided to test it out and they bought
27:31
5 000 stickers worth 800 pounds
27:34
and they only found 681 out of the 682
27:37
stickers
27:38
so they were one shot they didn't have
27:40
raja nangalan
27:42
um and he hasn't even yeah he's not even
27:44
going to the world cup is he not
27:45
really good yeah i think and i think he
27:48
didn't get picked but yeah
27:49
yeah i remember that in 1990 david
27:52
roadcastle of arsenal
27:53
had a coin made he played he played he
27:56
started in
27:57
every qualifying match at england played
27:59
he had a coin made in the esso world cup
28:01
coin collection
28:02
and then when they picked the squad they
28:03
didn't pick him oh my god
28:05
[Music]
28:06
he felt so so so hurtful but i mean
28:09
i've got a coin never mind playing every
28:12
qualifier you were thinking he had his
28:14
own coin made out of vanity
28:16
he didn't have his own mate no he didn't
28:18
mean to coin himself
28:20
um the uh there was a really cool idea
28:22
in james i reckon you would like this uh
28:24
there was a news agent in the 2016
28:27
euro um so panini did for the euro 2016.
28:30
um
28:30
they did a shop where basically people
28:32
could meet up just to swap the panini
28:34
stickers
28:34
again i'm not interested in meeting up
28:36
with people to do something
28:40
um this fact is about lima peru
28:43
uh so they qualified football
28:45
[Laughter]
28:47
sorry they were in the fact yeah uh so
28:49
they qualified right
28:50
um yeah peru qualified but in lima uh
28:53
where the match was
28:54
against new zealand it's where they had
28:56
uh a two-nil victory that got them
28:57
in um there's an app which is designed
29:00
to warn people
29:01
of an impending natural disaster so
29:03
earthquakes
29:04
mainly and that app went off when
29:07
the when lima was celebrating because
29:10
there was so much activity going on
29:12
then an earthquake warning went out uh
29:14
to everyone with that app how cool is
29:15
that they were so excited
29:16
so much geological activity yeah there
29:18
was there was so many people just
29:19
jumping around
29:20
yeah which happens a lot in football
29:22
stadiums doesn't it in america
29:24
yeah so an american football stadium can
29:26
register a very tiny earthquake
29:28
to anything that's sensitive towards it
29:29
and in lima they have that and there was
29:31
once a madness festival in finsbury park
29:33
that set off a
29:34
earthquake thing as well really yeah you
29:36
live in finsbury park
29:41
i was bizarrely looking into sponsorship
29:43
that appears on jerseys
29:44
so my favorite one is atletico madrid
29:46
who the sponsorship for their team
29:48
in 2003 was a deal with columbia
29:50
pictures
29:51
so the sponsorship kept changing
29:53
according to what movie they were
29:54
pushing at that time
29:56
so movies that appeared on their jerseys
29:58
included white chicks
29:59
spanglish and anacondas the hunt for the
30:02
blood orchid
30:08

welcome to another episode of no such
01:43
thing as a fish
01:44
a weekly podcast this week coming to you
01:46
from melbourne
01:57
my name is dan schreiber and i am
02:00
sitting here with anna cizinski
02:01
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
02:04
and once again we have gathered around
02:05
the microphones with our four favorite
02:07
facts from the last seven days
02:09
and in no particular order here we go
02:12
starting with you andrew hunter murray
02:16
my fact is that there was a showman in
02:18
the 1930s whose act
02:20
consisted of repeatedly crashing his
02:22
plane into the ground
02:25
this is such an amazing guy so this
02:26
fight oh sorry andy how do you
02:28
repeatedly crash charlie can only crash
02:29
a plane once into the ground that's a
02:31
very good point he
02:33
sequentially crashed separate planes
02:36
into the ground
02:36
let the record show so this fact was
02:40
actually sent into
02:41
to us to me by a guy called cameron
02:42
dawkins so cameron thank you very much
02:44
for this and i i looked into him a bit
02:46
more
02:46
uh the showman not cameron dawkins
02:50
do you not care about cameron at all i
02:52
do you said you were facts
02:53
it's true all right i researched cameron
02:55
dawkins life and we're here to tell you
02:57
some home truths andy all the research
02:59
we've done is on camera
03:05
cameron was born in 1982
03:13
okay uh no the guy's name the showman's
03:15
name he was called frank frakes what a
03:17
cool
03:18
name he was from tennessee and his
03:19
speciality he was an aerial showman so
03:21
he did lots of stuff so he did loop the
03:23
loops and he did all sorts of acrobatics
03:24
with his plane but his special trick
03:26
was crashing planes into trees lakes
03:30
pre-built houses and sometimes just
03:32
smashing him right into the ground
03:34
uh he would buy a very old clunky plane
03:37
so obviously planes were very very basic
03:38
in these days who by a really old clunky
03:40
plane he would get it
03:41
just air-worthy and then he would crash
03:43
it yeah and he was very honest about his
03:45
career he said i admit
03:47
i fool the public everyone who goes out
03:49
there will expect to see me get killed
03:50
but i won't
03:52
and he um it's amazing you can see
03:54
footage of this online there's all these
03:56
old newsreels where they see
03:57
frank has he that kind of voice and you
04:00
see him go through
04:01
houses and there's one um there's one
04:03
great clip where
04:04
he misses the house because the the
04:06
plane actually goes out of control he
04:08
loses genuine uh control of it
04:10
and he plummets and you see him plummet
04:12
in the distance and by pure coincidence
04:14
he plummeted onto a car
04:15
so everyone was just as happy because he
04:17
still hit a thing
04:18
apart from the guy driving the car
04:21
and he was yeah he was badly hurt but he
04:23
um
04:25
and we're definitely sure he wasn't just
04:27
a very bad pilot
04:29
oh well all the time the whole time his
04:31
actors actually watch me
04:33
stay flying yeah he was sponsored by
04:37
camel cigarettes everyone in those days
04:39
so actually if you
04:40
google him and if you look at sort of
04:42
old sources from the time the only thing
04:44
that mentions him
04:45
are cigarette adverts where he just uh
04:48
there are it's so weird adverts in those
04:49
days in the 30s because you'll get like
04:50
a really long form piece
04:52
paragraph after paragraph about his
04:53
career and then the closing line will be
04:55
something like
04:56
and below you see him having performed
04:58
this stunt and ready to enjoy his
04:59
favorite smoke
05:00
camels and yeah and they'd have there'll
05:02
be little cartoons of him where he'd say
05:04
i always smoke camels i can smoke as
05:06
many as i want and i feel
05:07
fresh never jittery and never upset
05:11
yes yes my job is dangerous but i'll
05:13
tell you what's even more dangerous
05:15
a lifetime of smoking camel cigarettes
05:20
so um the civil aviation authority
05:23
didn't like this guy did they
05:25
right they kept trying to shut him down
05:27
and all he'd do was just move to a
05:28
different state where they couldn't get
05:30
hold of him
05:31
and so one time he was flying in florida
05:34
and he crashed his plane
05:35
and everyone thought he was really
05:37
injured so um an ambulance came and put
05:39
him in the ambulance
05:40
and then they drove off and then they
05:42
got to state lines he jumped out and
05:43
then ran off and then did a show in the
05:44
next state the next day
05:46
that's so amazing it was very popular
05:49
back then wasn't it
05:50
doing these like tricks and stuff do it
05:51
yeah particularly air air flights and
05:54
air stunts
05:54
it was basically after the first world
05:56
war there was this massive surplus of
05:57
airplanes and the government didn't know
05:59
what to do with them
06:00
and so they sold them for nothing i
06:02
think actually they would sell the
06:03
petrol in the tank and it came with a
06:04
free plane
06:05
sometimes and so all these amateurs just
06:09
brought up all these planes and became
06:10
stuntmen and
06:11
yeah it was a huge deal and we've
06:13
mentioned it before on the podcast but
06:14
what they used to do was a thing called
06:15
barnstorming where
06:17
a group of them would go and fly over a
06:19
town and they would land in a field
06:21
they would ask for permission to put on
06:22
a massive show and if they got the
06:24
permission they would drop leaflets out
06:25
of the plane saying come and watch our
06:27
show so they traveled in a pack they
06:28
were a tour
06:29
like a flying a literal flying circus
06:31
that would come in
06:32
and do their show and then some people
06:34
think that the bandstarming word comes
06:36
from crashing into these bands like this
06:38
guy did he crashed into prefab buildings
06:40
didn't he
06:40
yeah do you know his other act it was
06:43
called the casket of death
06:45
and he would climb into a barrel which
06:47
would be reinforced
06:49
blow it up with dynamite in from inside
06:51
and then jump out
06:54
wow how would that work i don't know but
06:56
what you're saying is that he's in the
06:57
same place as the dynamite they're both
06:59
inside the barrel
07:00
i would have had at least the barrel in
07:02
between me and the diner well
07:03
that's why that's why your circus act
07:05
failed
07:07
james safely blows up a barrel at a
07:09
distance
07:11
there's no peril
07:14
um there was another guy called the
07:16
salamander and he
07:17
he would uh he had a death slide which
07:20
it was like a bobsled with a cradle of
07:22
lit fireworks underneath him
07:24
but he also did a trick where he poured
07:25
a pile of gunpowder along his neck and
07:27
arm to a pile in his hand and his
07:29
assistant would set fire
07:30
to the gunpowder in his collarbone and
07:32
when it got to his hands it would blow
07:33
up
07:34
but he only did it apparently on special
07:36
occasions
07:38
he only ever did it twice
07:44
but gunpowder base stunts i think were
07:46
quite a thing again because people the
07:48
war just happened people were quite into
07:49
blowing things up and in the 30s in
07:52
germany rocket cycling was quite a big
07:55
deal and so this was tying
07:57
big sticks of dynamite to a bike and
07:59
then
08:00
lighting it and then it propels you in
08:02
your rocket there was a guy called
08:03
her richter who was good at this he was
08:05
another guy called wiley coyote
08:09
yeah he so this guy he tied 12 rockets
08:12
to his bike
08:13
and then he called it rackington rudd
08:16
and when he hit 55 miles an hour the
08:18
first time he did it all they all
08:19
exploded and he flew off and traveled
08:20
about 50 yards
08:22
into a hedge i think but he kept it up
08:24
it is weird they used to
08:26
um the daredevil it was a job that
08:28
suddenly boomed where people were
08:30
answering adverts in the newspaper this
08:32
is a genuine one from 1931
08:34
wanted single man not over 25 to drive
08:37
automobile in head-on collision
08:39
with another car must crash with another
08:43
car at 40 miles an hour and give
08:45
unconditional release in case of injury
08:47
or death
08:48
name your lowest price
08:52
and these are like if you picture the
08:54
cars as well if you picture in your head
08:55
just
08:55
old cars of the olden days they were
08:57
those are the ones that were flying over
08:59
buses and they couldn't get much speed
09:00
and
09:01
it's pretty extraordinary to look at all
09:02
the photos at the time yeah they were
09:04
kind of flimsy weren't they and because
09:06
another thing they used to do was
09:08
travel in a car well a little bike with
09:10
a sidecar with a lion in it
09:12
um and that this was another popular
09:14
thing and they they actually had a name
09:16
i think they were called lion drones so
09:18
they'd go around a velodrome but on a
09:20
motorbike and
09:21
there'd be sometimes there'd be a line
09:23
in your sidecar and then there was
09:24
another one where
09:25
you were riding around a velodrome on
09:27
your motorbike and a bunch of lions got
09:29
released and chased you
09:31
wow come off it and just charged after
09:34
you
09:35
this is entertainment sounds great yeah
09:37
that's cool
09:39
the um first person to do a loop the
09:40
loop in an airplane
09:42
uh was a russian a soviet guy called
09:44
piotr yesterday
09:46
and he was immediately arrested for
09:48
risking government property
09:51
and then a few months later there was a
09:54
french guy who did it
09:55
um called adolf pegu and he became world
09:58
famous
09:59
and then the soviets went oh maybe we
10:01
shouldn't have arrested that guy after
10:02
all
10:03
and they took him out of prison and he
10:05
was promoted to staff captain and
10:06
awarded a medal
10:07
really wow wow that is so funny
10:11
have you ever heard obviously jumping
10:12
out of a moving plane is very dangerous
10:14
have you ever heard of jumping into a
10:16
moving plane no this is a thing that
10:18
some people do
10:19
well if you're really late for your
10:20
flight
10:23
i'm serious this has been done it was
10:24
first done in 1997 and then
10:26
last year 2017 two guys recreated it uh
10:29
two french daredevils
10:31
so what happens is you jump out of the
10:33
aircraft you're wearing a wingsuit
10:35
you then fly until you've caught up with
10:38
the aircraft which is flying downwards
10:39
and then you jump back into it
10:41
wow it's not it's rare it is also one
10:44
for special occasions only guys
10:46
well check this story out i was reading
10:48
about a guy called graham donald he was
10:50
a pilot in 1917
10:52
and he was attempting for the first time
10:54
in a plane that's called a
10:55
sopwith camel yeah so he was attempting
10:58
his first loop the loop
10:59
so he went up 6 000 feet and he got to
11:01
the peak of his loop the loop he was
11:03
upside down
11:04
and his belt snapped and he fell out
11:07
he disappeared out of the plane yeah now
11:09
55 years later he tells a story
11:12
oh it has
11:17
so check this out he's upside down the
11:19
belt snaps and he falls out
11:21
he plummets 5000 feet but because he was
11:24
in the middle of a loop the loop
11:25
maneuver
11:25
his plane came back down oh yeah no
11:29
yeah this is his story he's landed on
11:32
the wing of the plane with two thousand
11:34
feet to go
11:35
back in yes okay there are a thousand
11:38
people here does anyone believe that
11:39
story give us a chat graeme donald
11:43
check it out 1917. a thousand but it
11:46
doesn't matter if he said it he's
11:47
obviously delusional a thousand percent
11:49
not just he's incredible he met it on
11:52
the bottom
11:54
on the wing it is literally incredible
11:58
how did the plane know where to go
12:00
because he had it in the loop the loop
12:01
maneuver it was just following its path
12:03
it was a natural pattern that's not how
12:04
physics works
12:07
it was just going to straight it got a
12:09
tangent
12:11
he said the first 2 000 feet passed very
12:13
quickly
12:14
and terra firma looked damn firmer as i
12:17
fell i began to hear my faithful little
12:19
camel
12:20
somewhere nearby suddenly i fell back
12:22
onto her
12:23
maybe he was talking about the
12:24
cigarettes come on
12:27
and he made a good landing he's a hero
12:29
yeah wow
12:30
hey we're gonna have to move on to our
12:32
next fact uh
12:34
all right do you guys know okay
12:37
do you guys know tommy fitzpatrick no my
12:40
favorite uh
12:41
stunt man in 1956 he was really drunk in
12:44
a pub in new york
12:45
he made a bet with his friend there that
12:46
in 15 minutes he would be back at that
12:48
pub in an airplane
12:50
and then he went to an airport in new
12:52
jersey
12:53
uh he stole a plane he landed it on
12:56
nicholas avenue in manhattan between a
12:58
whole bunch of cars
12:59
and in complete darkness no lights on
13:01
the plane nothing
13:03
and he rocked up back in the bar and he
13:05
said hey guys i did it
13:06
i suspect it took him longer than 15
13:08
minutes he was charged with grand
13:10
larceny but the owner of the plane
13:12
didn't press charges so he got away with
13:14
it
13:14
and two years later he was in the same
13:16
bar telling the story
13:17
and the person he was telling didn't
13:19
believe him so he did the exact same
13:20
thing again
13:22
[Applause]
13:28
okay it is time for fact number two and
13:30
that is my fact
13:32
my fact this week is that a new
13:34
scientific study has shown
13:35
that people who claim to know a lot of
13:37
facts don't actually know as many facts
13:40
as they think they do
13:43
whoa whoa whoa whoa dan what does it say
13:47
about people who don't know that many
13:48
facts
13:49
and that the few facts that they do say
13:50
are often described as dubious
13:55
um so yeah so this is um this is a study
13:58
that was written by a man called graeme
13:59
donald who previously survived a loop
14:00
the loop in a plane uh
14:02
no i'm joking i'm joking this is real
14:04
this is real the other thing was real i
14:05
don't know
14:08
other thing was real so this is a new
14:12
study this is that
14:13
people who think that they have superior
14:15
knowledge
14:16
both knowledge belief facts um they tend
14:18
to overestimate how much they actually
14:20
know
14:21
and then so they did this as a study
14:23
it's in a paper that's called is belief
14:25
superiority justified by superior
14:27
knowledge they sat people down and they
14:29
asked them what they knew and then they
14:30
did a test to actually test if they knew
14:32
what they thought they knew
14:33
and it turns out they don't yeah
14:36
but even when they were told that they
14:38
were wrong they still believe that they
14:39
knew more than most people didn't they
14:41
yeah and this was a it was all about
14:42
political um facts
14:44
yes exactly yeah oh so if they have
14:46
political biases then they won't they'll
14:48
just assume they know facts they were
14:50
like objectively i'm right
14:51
yeah yeah and these people were also
14:54
found to
14:54
um whenever they want to read about
14:56
subject they always read
14:58
papers that agreed with whatever their
15:00
viewpoint was
15:01
and they also did it knowing that they
15:03
were doing that said no this is fine
15:05
this is what i meant to do
15:06
so that's what this study was about i
15:08
know i'm relating to so much of what you
15:09
just said
15:12
but there i think there have even been
15:13
studies done before that show that the
15:15
more expert you are in something the
15:18
more you'll
15:19
uh the more you'll lie about how much
15:21
you know about it
15:22
so basically there was a study in 2015
15:24
that found that
15:26
you're likely to overclaim if you're
15:28
good at something so for instance if
15:29
you're a geographer
15:30
then you'll claim you know of a place
15:31
that actually doesn't exist and that
15:33
literally happened so
15:34
a bunch of geographers by profession
15:37
were given a list of geographic
15:38
locations and told you know tell us if
15:40
you're familiar with these places
15:42
and they said yeah lake othello sure
15:43
yeah kashmir in oregon yeah yeah i know
15:45
that place it's uh my aunt lives there
15:47
and none of those places existed 92
15:50
i said same with bio biologists so
15:52
biology experts we
15:54
were said uh are you familiar with these
15:56
toxins and chemicals
15:58
and so they were asked you know about
15:59
metatoxins do you know about retroplex
16:02
and they just ticked all those boxes i
16:04
said yeah of course they do i'm a
16:05
biologist
16:06
all made up that doesn't just happen
16:08
with people who are experts in the field
16:10
so for example in 2013 uh the tv host
16:12
jimmy kimmel he's a very famous guy he
16:14
carried out an experiment on this and
16:16
when i say he i mean someone in his
16:18
production team
16:19
but they went to coachella the american
16:21
music festival
16:23
your honor and um they filmed themselves
16:26
asking people have you heard of these
16:28
bands and are you looking forward to
16:28
seeing
16:29
them at coachella but there were a lot
16:31
of made-up bands and it's amazing seeing
16:32
people saying oh yeah i've heard
16:34
i haven't heard their new stuff but i my
16:36
friends have told me i have to see them
16:37
when the bands were called things like
16:39
dr and the gi clinic
16:42
the obesity epidemic i love that stuff
16:45
and my favorite
16:46
shorty jizzle and the plumper cracks
16:52
i really like the idea that jimmy kimmel
16:55
actually instead of working on his show
16:56
and doing jokes is like can we get more
16:58
scientific surveys going on and
17:00
i'll focus on them you guys do the rest
17:02
another psychological study
17:04
um anna you're quite good at uh
17:06
crosswords
17:08
i'm better than dan sure
17:11
james could have asked you anything that
17:12
you were good at and that's still the
17:14
answer
17:16
so um i'll give you some words and so
17:18
see if you can guess what they are
17:20
i'll just give us your best horrible
17:21
thing to do so um it's four letters
17:24
w blank blank h w blank
17:28
okay um i'll say wash okay
17:31
s blank blank p soap stop shop
17:35
okay well this has worked quite well
17:36
because you know this isn't how
17:38
crosswords work
17:38
[Laughter]
17:42
well here's the thing here's the thing
17:44
right apparently
17:46
anyone who says cleansing related words
17:48
like wash or soap
17:50
uh has has done some extremely bad deeds
17:54
in the most
17:55
recent past wow
18:02
and it literally says instead of
18:04
alternatives such as with and stop
18:06
joking
18:08
[Applause]
18:12
i thought with i just took wash because
18:14
she'd said with already
18:16
i did say soap first i grant you that
18:21
this is great so i'm the normal against
18:23
which this you're the angelic one
18:25
and this is the evil bastard ah yes
18:30
um so this is there's a thing about um
18:33
when you're tricked by a fraudster it
18:34
turns out it's not the fraudster who's
18:36
tricking you it's you who's tricking you
18:37
okay you trick yourself into thinking
18:39
this flordster is
18:40
this flawster is plausible
18:43
okay um so in 2008 stephen greenspan
18:46
he's an author he published a book
18:48
called the annals of gullibility which
18:50
was the summary of
18:51
decades of work of his about how not to
18:54
be gullible how not to be fooled
18:56
two days after publication he discovered
18:58
that his financial advisor one mr bernie
19:00
madoff
19:05
had defrauded him out of a third of his
19:07
retirement savings whoa
19:08
i know yeah but he
19:12
i think he's glad that we're having a
19:14
massive laugh about that in melbourne
19:16
that is pretty funny though but what he
19:19
said is that
19:20
well he didn't say this but the theory
19:21
goes that greenspan trusted madoff he
19:23
made himself believe
19:24
no this guy seems plausible if i give
19:25
him a bit of money i'll get loads back
19:27
okay
19:28
um so this this fact is about basically
19:31
the dunning-kruger effect
19:32
which i'm sure we've mentioned before
19:34
semi-well-known people of low ability
19:36
who are just crap at things thinking
19:37
they're really good at things
19:38
and the idea is that if you literally
19:40
know almost nothing about something
19:41
you don't know the stuff that reveals to
19:43
you how little you know
19:45
um so a good example that really spoke
19:47
to me
19:48
was that um if you don't know the i bet
19:50
they all speak to you dad
19:54
so if you're bad if you're bad at
19:56
writing um and let's say you don't have
19:58
a good grasp of
19:59
grammar um and uh spelling you
20:02
won't know that you're a bad writer
20:04
because you don't know the rules in
20:05
order to know that you're
20:06
bad at those rules therefore you think
20:08
you're good
20:10
without knowing yeah yeah that is a good
20:12
example the example it was based on
20:14
though
20:18
i'm actually going to edit that out
20:20
because it doesn't help us if you say
20:22
smart things on this podcast
20:25
you've got a personality to keep up here
20:27
then
20:28
um so the example i didn't know the
20:30
example on which don kruger effect was
20:32
based
20:33
so it was dr dunning uh who came across
20:36
this incident david dunning came across
20:38
this incident in 1995 i think it was a
20:41
man who rode banks in pittsburgh
20:43
and he was caught on security cameras so
20:46
he went in broad daylight he didn't have
20:47
a mask on or anything
20:48
uh corn security cameras arrested and
20:51
when he was interviewed he said but i
20:52
wore the juice
20:53
and it turned out he'd rubbed lemon
20:55
juice on his face and he thought because
20:57
that works as invisible ink
20:59
that that would render his face
21:01
invisible to security cameras
21:04
that is a brilliant trick to play on
21:06
someone isn't it to tell them that
21:08
even better if you tell them that human
21:10
semen was used as invisible link in the
21:11
world
21:13
which which yeah otherwise that would
21:16
have been an extremely weird thing for
21:17
me to say
21:20
but again human semen on your face does
21:22
not render it invisible to security
21:24
cameras
21:26
just to be clear how did we go it makes
21:29
you quite conspicuous actually
21:32
it'd be so weird at a lot of the end of
21:34
boards
21:36
where's she gone like it would be
21:44
we need to move on in a second actually
21:46
yeah we need to move on five minutes ago
21:48
dad
21:50
anything before we do um
21:53
you just one one little thing british uh
21:55
there's a thing called the better than
21:56
average effect where you'll have heard
21:58
that lots of people
21:59
most people consider themselves better
22:00
than average drivers there was a study
22:02
on
22:03
uh british prisoners which found that
22:06
they rate themselves as more ethical and
22:08
more moral than british people who are
22:09
not in prison
22:11
they also think they are more they think
22:13
they're more kind moral
22:14
trustworthy honest dependable generous
22:17
law-abiding
22:18
self-controlled and generous the only
22:21
category they didn't think they were
22:22
better than average on was
22:24
law-abidingness and even then
22:27
they considered themselves average with
22:29
everyone else
22:32
okay it is time for fact number three
22:35
and that is chozinski yeah my fact is
22:38
that in the first major battle
22:40
of world war one the soldiers arrived by
22:43
taxi
22:46
and the taxi drivers duly charged the
22:49
government
22:49
seventy thousand and twelve francs for
22:51
the journey was the incentive to get
22:53
soldiers to jump out of the taxis very
22:55
quickly because the last guy would have
22:56
to pay
22:58
is that what you do i never noticed it
23:01
but it comes well i think we're learning
23:02
where these
23:03
words wash and soap come from andy
23:06
and this is this is the amazing story of
23:09
the battle of the man which was
23:11
a massive turning point in the first
23:12
world war it was september 1914
23:14
first major battle on the western front
23:16
and the germans were getting dangerously
23:18
close to
23:19
paris but that did mean that they could
23:21
deploy all the paris taxi drivers
23:23
and so the british government sent 3 000
23:26
soldiers by taxi from paris to
23:28
the front the war front in 600 cabs and
23:31
everyone carried five soldiers
23:33
so a bit of a squash because that's you
23:35
know that's full squashed up in the back
23:36
and then one in the front
23:37
who has to make awkward conversation
23:39
with the driver all the way there
23:42
so what are you saying that later on
23:44
they're in the trenches going well it's
23:46
bad here but it's not as bad as the
23:47
squash taxi that we had to
23:49
get here in it must have looked quite
23:51
bizarre because they weren't allowed to
23:52
have their lights on except the taxi at
23:54
the very front
23:55
and everyone else just had to follow the
23:57
backlight the back red light so they
23:58
couldn't be spotted but yeah this is how
24:00
they got to the front and then
24:01
it was a turning point and the allies
24:03
won it and happy news the war then went
24:05
on for another four years
24:06
so the account of it uh on wikipedia
24:09
just reports that the germans were
24:10
surprised
24:11
[Laughter]
24:16
it's a very important element of war
24:19
they did i do love that they got charged
24:20
for it
24:21
taxi drivers you know how much they want
24:22
to do their duty for their country
24:24
in the end you have deprived them of a
24:25
couple of affairs so yeah
24:27
seventy thousand francs well that's a
24:29
big big steep journey yeah it is
24:31
london used to send in double-decker
24:33
buses uh during the war effort as well
24:35
um and that was amazing because they
24:37
were those are big buses not the modern
24:39
ones obviously the sort of the old
24:41
classics and
24:42
uh they were going down these country
24:43
roads which obviously weren't
24:45
built to take these double-decker buses
24:47
so what would often happen is they would
24:48
come across another double-decker bus
24:50
from another ally
24:51
coming the other way try and get past
24:53
each other but tip over
24:54
and so the roads were littered with
24:56
tipped over buses that
24:58
they couldn't get back up to function
25:00
were they littered
25:03
was it like you know you can't stretch
25:06
your arms out on this row without
25:08
bumping into a double deck of art
25:09
it just some of those ones actually
25:12
because they were used for lots of
25:13
different things they were used as
25:14
ambulances and for transport the london
25:16
buses
25:16
and some of them were used to carry a
25:18
pigeon to carry
25:20
carrier pigeons to carry carrier pigeons
25:22
and they had special pigeon lofts built
25:24
on the top of them so they're really
25:25
cool pictures
25:26
of these double decker buses with a
25:28
pigeon loft kind of house built on top
25:30
of it
25:30
and brought them over that's amazing you
25:32
think the pigeons could just fly over
25:34
you're thought they were actually all
25:36
conscientious objectors so they really
25:38
had to be forced
25:43
some stuff on taxis yeah okay yeah um so
25:46
in the uk um it's illegal to get into a
25:49
taxi if you have plague
25:52
unless you tell the taxi driver
25:56
so you're not allowed to withhold it
25:57
from him um and this is actually
26:00
there's all sorts of different diseases
26:02
and this is according to the public
26:04
health control of diseases act of 1985.
26:07
and so if you have the plague cholera
26:09
relapsing
26:10
fever smallpox or typhus then you have
26:12
to tell the taxi driver
26:13
but also weirdly food poisoning you need
26:17
to
26:17
and these are all if you also if you
26:19
want to go to a library
26:20
and get a book out and you have plague
26:22
yeah you have to tell the driver that
26:24
you're going to the library
26:27
it's none of his business
26:34
it is it is kind of his business where
26:35
you're going yeah
26:42
i've got a taxi story this is from 2015
26:45
and it's a story about a taxi in britain
26:47
is that in 2015 a group of friends
26:49
tricked a taxi driver
26:51
out of 140 pound fare by leaving a
26:54
mannequin in a hat
26:55
in the backseat and pretending it was
26:58
their sleeping friend
27:01
oh really i mean they went from brighton
27:03
to london it's about 50 miles it's a
27:05
very long journey
27:06
lucky cabbage and they were like oh no
27:07
you need to take derrick here up to
27:08
manchester
27:09
united and they just they got the two of
27:12
them they got out and they left the guy
27:13
at the mannequin in the hat and they
27:14
said our friend's asleep but will you
27:16
wake him up here's the address
27:17
and where did they send him to that's
27:18
what i want to know it was it wasn't too
27:20
far off
27:21
because he might have got he might have
27:22
worked it out right he might have worked
27:23
it out yeah do you know
27:24
some other cars that drove from brighton
27:26
to london
27:30
such a pointless link it's about taxis i
27:32
mean
27:34
um were the world's first fleet of
27:36
electric taxis
27:37
and these were in 1897. so electric cars
27:40
came along
27:41
and most cars were taxis then and so in
27:43
1897 they wanted to show off they were
27:45
called hummingbirds because they made
27:46
the sound of a hummingbird
27:48
whenever they drove along and they
27:50
traveled a
27:51
maximum 12 miles an hour usually more
27:53
like nine and as part of the unveiling
27:55
they did the london to brighton journey
27:57
which as you say is about 50 miles
27:59
although they weren't actually able to
28:01
complete the journey and they had to do
28:02
part of the race by train
28:07
the other the other reason they were
28:08
unpopular the electric cars was because
28:10
they had electric lighting inside
28:12
and people didn't really like that
28:14
because people with a bashful
28:15
disposition
28:16
felt as conspicuous as if they were on
28:18
the stage with the limelight on them
28:20
and so people didn't like having lights
28:21
there was the lights on while they were
28:23
driving
28:27
that's so weird okay so the first taxis
28:29
were
28:30
sedan chairs right in london and they
28:33
were
28:33
well all over um but they were very good
28:36
precisely for the opposite reason which
28:38
is that there was no light on you at all
28:39
and you were surrounded by fabric
28:41
so it was extremely discreet and the
28:43
best thing was they could go into your
28:45
house and up the stairs
28:47
so that's really honest that's like
28:49
getting an uber and the guy carries you
28:51
up
28:56
so you know there were faster carriages
28:58
lots of narrow stairways two guys
29:00
carrying you up there and basically if
29:02
you were having an affair or you're
29:03
trying to avoid a rest
29:04
you just get into a sedan chair in your
29:06
house and say take me up to that house
29:08
second floor please and they'll do it
29:10
what
29:11
as a connection our uh our mother show
29:14
qi
29:15
um stephen fry his car is a london black
29:18
cab
29:19
and he's it's fine now because he lives
29:21
in the countryside in norfolk but he
29:23
used to live in london and most of his
29:25
days were people just hopping into the
29:26
back
29:28
and seeing stephen fry up i had that
29:30
stephen fry in the front of my cat
29:35
prince philip our prince philip and
29:38
yours
29:42
that was a risky one man yeah
29:45
he had he had a private care but he only
29:47
gave it up last year
29:49
yeah good so
29:54
um you know the first drunk driving
29:55
incident was a taxi driver
29:57
and this was also in 1897 actually this
29:59
was a cab driver called george smith who
30:01
drove his taxi straight into the side of
30:02
a building
30:03
and wrote it off he was arrested for
30:05
drunk driving first person ever and
30:08
the police officers couldn't prove it
30:10
but they knew he was drunk because
30:11
apparently he was acting drunk and he
30:12
said he was drunk
30:13
but that after that they realized that
30:17
they needed a test for it and that's
30:18
where the breathalyzer came from wow so
30:20
they based the breathalyzer on that and
30:21
initially it was a balloon and you blew
30:23
into a balloon and then you put the
30:24
end of the balloon over a sort of a
30:27
bottle of chemicals which changed from
30:29
purple to yellow
30:30
and it didn't work very well because
30:32
there was no measure of how drunk you
30:34
were
30:34
it just changed from purple to yellow
30:35
and he went i don't know how yellow is
30:37
that
30:37
is that like yellow and is that bright
30:39
enough yellow yeah let's arrest him
30:41
oh uh we need to move on very soon um
30:45
i read that the word do you know where
30:47
the word taxi comes from
30:49
um no taxes uh like tax
30:53
arrangement means movement in latin yeah
30:55
it comes from the word taxi meter
30:57
oh okay isn't that weird what was that
31:01
before a taxi then it had it had a
31:02
different name but then someone invented
31:04
the taxi meter and they were like oh
31:05
that's a fantastic what are we going to
31:06
put this in yeah
31:12
so they built a car around it
31:16
okay we need to move on to our final
31:18
fact of the show
31:19
and that is james okay my fact this week
31:22
is that the gulf
31:23
covina fish has such loud sex
31:27
that it can deafen dolphins
31:34
that is they shouldn't be listening the
31:36
perverts
31:42
so the gold carvina is a mexican fish
31:45
they have sex in huge orgies with lots
31:47
of these fish
31:49
and they have mating calls that sound
31:51
like rapid sounding pulses
31:52
like a machine gun and you get a whole
31:55
load of them together because
31:57
it's an orgy and that's what happens i
31:58
believe in orgies
32:00
and apparently it sounds like a crowd
32:02
cheering at a football stadium or a
32:04
really really loud beehive
32:07
and there was a guy who studies them
32:08
called timothy rothwell and he said that
32:10
the sound was literally so loud that he
32:12
had to shout to talk to the rest of the
32:14
team
32:14
when he was studying them and he's above
32:16
water so you can still hear it there
32:18
yeah it's incredible i listened to a
32:20
sound file of it today and
32:22
yeah you could sound only i know right
32:26
missing out on the good stuff um
32:30
it uh it does sound like a sort of
32:34
kind of like a like a machine gun sound
32:36
that you were talking about i imagine
32:38
you know when in
32:38
australia when you press those buttons
32:40
to cross the street and they're just
32:41
like
32:43
that yeah that's that's actually not
32:46
many people know that that's the sound
32:47
of this
32:50
little known fact and this um kind of
32:54
orgy thing frenzy thing that they do
32:57
basically sees all of the world's adult
32:59
corvinas gathered in less than one
33:01
percent of their usual home
33:03
so they all come from all different
33:05
places they all come to this one place
33:06
so it's like everyone getting into one
33:08
cupboard
33:08
for the orgy
33:14
not really it's less than one percent of
33:16
their usual home yeah
33:18
it's like that but everyone in your home
33:23
so which will just be you and your
33:24
girlfriend i guess it's just like you
33:26
and your girlfriend getting in the
33:28
cupboard
33:31
i worked out the numbers and it was a
33:33
bit like it's a bit like everyone in
33:35
london going to disneyland once a year
33:36
to have sex
33:39
and that i know is a controversial of
33:41
park rules
33:45
i don't like it and how do you know that
33:49
that's why you guys have to do it in the
33:50
cupboard now right yeah
33:54
everyone knows it's disneyland or
33:55
recovered
33:57
um it's actually really inconvenient for
33:59
these fish that they do this right
34:00
because
34:01
yeah as you say they all gather together
34:03
to have sex and
34:04
they're really tasty they're a delicacy
34:05
and fishermen go to where they gather
34:08
to have sex and then they make this huge
34:10
noise to really advertise exactly where
34:12
they are
34:12
and so fishermen know exactly where to
34:14
go to fish for them it's not the worst
34:16
um fish sex tactic so there is a
34:20
fantastic book uh by mara j hart it's
34:23
called sex in the sea i highly recommend
34:25
it
34:25
it's all about this sort of thing i
34:26
don't recommend never you mind why i
34:28
recommend it
34:30
all for that matter why i bought it but
34:33
it has
34:34
information about fish
34:38
you were very disappointed it was a
34:39
non-fiction book weren't you
34:42
anyway no there are fish called grunion
34:45
and they to have sex
34:46
throw themselves onto land which is very
34:49
inconvenient because they are fish
34:50
and the female has to dig a hole in the
34:53
sand and then bury herself in the sand
34:55
until there's only her
34:56
head sticking out she starts laying eggs
34:58
and then the male jumps on her and
35:00
spoons her
35:00
and has sex with her and he uses
35:04
her as a slide for his sperm which lands
35:06
on the eggs and then they have to
35:08
try and catch a wave back it sounds like
35:10
the most inconvenient
35:12
mating ritual you can imagine and yeah
35:14
she can't breathe through any of it
35:16
right um so it's so unpleasant and it
35:19
they're orgies as well aren't they so
35:20
often she's got a few males curved
35:22
around her
35:23
while suffocating to death whilst
35:25
attempting to procreate
35:27
it's very bad deal we actually have it
35:29
quite good guys by comparison
35:32
i started reading about so it dolphins
35:34
are going death off the back of these
35:36
fish having sex and um i was looking
35:39
into dolphin sex to see
35:41
what they and there's this is really
35:44
cool this is a
35:45
um did you watch flipper 3 in the course
35:48
of your research
35:52
so uh this is australian scientists have
35:55
found
35:55
that um dolphins they've observed them
35:57
doing this new thing where they come to
35:59
surface and they pull like a banana
36:01
shape so their head goes up
36:02
and their back goes up and they sit
36:04
there like a big banana and
36:06
that's apparently really attractive like
36:08
look at the banana and
36:09
they and and that's like a new mating
36:12
thing that we've not noticed before this
36:13
was last year that we discovered this
36:15
and also what they do is um these are
36:18
humpback dolphins
36:19
they dig down and they break off coral
36:21
and they wear them
36:22
on their nose as a little hat so they
36:25
look like hats yeah
36:26
and again so the the mid banana move
36:29
with
36:30
coral on their nose and people or the
36:32
other dolphins are looking at them
36:36
sexy yeah that's sex yeah although they
36:38
like to avoid males sometimes so dolphin
36:41
females are often really hassled by the
36:44
males
36:44
and kind of gang banged um and so they
36:48
really will have
36:48
lots of males chase them at the same
36:50
time try to have sex with them and they
36:52
flip over in the water
36:53
and they stick their reproductive parts
36:55
out of the water and the males can't get
36:56
them at all
36:57
really yeah um
37:01
yeah they also slap them in the face
37:03
with their tails quite a lot
37:04
when they're being chased yeah
37:08
um sorry i said coral sponges they put
37:11
sponges on their nose
37:12
yeah yeah that makes more sense yeah
37:18
there's i was looking at some fish
37:19
sounds oh yeah because underwater
37:20
creatures have the most amazing ways of
37:22
making noise
37:23
and it works completely differently
37:25
underwater so clownfish
37:27
make a chirping noise by gnashing their
37:28
teeth they literally the
37:30
only way they communicate is by snapping
37:31
their teeth together
37:33
they're oyster toad fish they make a
37:35
blur like a falcon noise
37:37
by contracting their swimming bladders
37:40
and there's gurami
37:41
which snap the tendons of their pectoral
37:43
fins so they basically clap their fins
37:45
together i suppose
37:46
in order to communicate with each other
37:48
but they can be super loud fish they've
37:51
they um have been known to keep people
37:53
awake at night haven't they
37:54
i think we've covered various things in
37:55
the past a lot of the facts here are
37:56
going to keep me awake at night
38:00
but i think the problem was is that
38:02
jacques cousteau did a documentary
38:03
didn't he in
38:04
1956 called the silent world oh yeah and
38:07
it was all about the underwater
38:09
um but basically his diving tanks masked
38:12
all the sounds
38:13
of the water so he was like oh it's so
38:15
quiet in here
38:16
and actually that's just where his
38:17
microphones were and so lots of people
38:19
thought it was really quiet but like
38:20
you're
38:21
like you're saying it is loud as hell
38:22
it's noisy even though it doesn't really
38:23
work very well with arias because i
38:25
thought this was really interesting so
38:26
sound waves
38:27
because they travel a different way in
38:28
water to how they do an air and we've
38:30
got air in our ear that's why sound is
38:32
messed up for us
38:32
underwater but that's also why whales
38:35
you know they have
38:36
huge amounts of wax in their ears so you
38:38
see um whale's ear wax it comes you know
38:41
many many inches long ear wax and that's
38:43
kind of the same density as water
38:45
so that means that the sound waves can
38:47
travel into there is
38:48
and they'd be fine but it's assumed that
38:50
if they came up
38:52
onto the surface they would be deaf in
38:53
air so
38:55
yeah that's how you make a fish death
38:57
just on sex sounds peacocks have been
38:59
observed
39:00
um on land um as opposed to yeah um
39:05
peacock they do not thrive underwater
39:10
so peacocks um have been found to be
39:12
doing a false sex sound
39:14
in order to attract mates so what will
39:16
happen is while they're mating they have
39:18
the sound that they do which is um which
39:21
they'll just go the whole way through
39:22
do it now come on i haven't annoyingly
39:25
could not find that audio file
39:28
but they uh so they make this sound and
39:30
then the thing is it's a very loud sound
39:32
that the male makes so
39:33
while it's happening other females in
39:35
the area will hear it at a distance and
39:37
go
39:38
oh that sounds like a good guy to
39:39
reproduce with which is what they're
39:41
trying to do so that's what they listen
39:43
out for
39:44
and if they the reason that that's good
39:46
that sound is it means that
39:48
someone has picked them as genetically
39:50
uh good to reproduce and so that's very
39:52
important
39:53
so peacocks that are not good at
39:54
reproducing genetically
39:56
have worked out this trick where if they
39:58
just make the sound even though they're
39:59
not having sex
40:01
female peacocks will hear them in the
40:02
distance going whoa that guy must be
40:04
awesome and and head over to do it
40:08
um we've discussed this before i think
40:10
it's so
40:11
a lot of animals do these fake calls but
40:13
there are some where they can't do fake
40:15
calls isn't it and i reckon it's
40:17
is it eland's they click their knees or
40:19
something like that yes they do
40:20
and they that is a thing which is
40:22
attractive to women if they click their
40:23
knees
40:24
but only the big ones can make the noise
40:27
and it's impossible for the small ones
40:28
to fake it
40:29
yes that's an honest signal whereas the
40:32
peacocks can just stand in their windows
40:34
going
40:34
oh wow
40:38
oh yeah what's that
40:41
oh yeah i know i'm good what great wow
40:46
okay that is it that is all of our facts
40:48

00:00
hey everyone dan and anna here thanks
00:02
for tuning in to this week's episode of
00:03
fish
00:04
before we begin last week we mentioned
00:06
at the top of the show that we just
00:07
released this really cool retro looking
00:09
cassette that was actually a usb
00:11
and contains all of the second year of
00:13
fish on it and off the back of us
00:15
mentioning it uh
00:16
to our surprise it's it's been sold out
00:18
and so a lot of you
00:20
most likely are heading back to the
00:21
website and thinking ah this is no
00:23
longer a thing
00:24
but it does exist and if you go to
00:25
qi.com cassette
00:27
you will actually get it you can click
00:29
to buy it and it will arrive
00:30
even though it says at the moment they
00:32
don't have stock they are going to
00:33
extremely soon
00:34
so qi.com cassette you'll get the full
00:37
second year of fish and also we
00:39
filmed a special four cassette tape only
00:42
uh exclusive podcast in the office where
00:44
there are cameras in our faces
00:46
you get to see what those look like you
00:48

00:56
rarity it's a
00:57
yes it's like a yeti yeah it's like a
00:59
yeti but it does exist that's what we're
01:01
trying to emphasize so it's almost the
01:02
opposite of a yeti in that sense
01:04

01:34
hello and welcome to another episode of
01:38
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
01:41
this week coming to you live from
01:43
melbourne
01:52
my name is dan schreiber and i am
01:55
sitting here with anna chazinski
01:57
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
01:59
and once again
02:01
we have gathered round the microphones
02:02
with our four favorite facts from the
02:04
last seven days
02:06
and in no particular order here we go
02:09
starting with you james okay my fact
02:12
this week is that the only known modern
02:14
death
02:15
due to meteorite was a cow who was hit
02:18
in the neck in venezuela in 1972
02:24
we didn't know about it for a decade
02:26
because the farmer ate the cow
02:28
and used the meteorite as a doorstop
02:33
it's amazing yeah so this is a thing
02:36
that happened
02:37
in um in venezuela um in a town that i
02:40
don't know how to pronounce
02:42
uh it's t-r-u-j-i-l-l-o
02:48
was that a zorro impression yeah it was
02:50
good
02:52
so um there was a sonic boom one night
02:54
and then the next morning they found the
02:55
dead cow and the rock
02:57
uh and they kind of thought nothing more
02:59
about it but then uh ten years later a
03:01
doctor came along
03:02
and he checked out this rock and
03:04
realized that it was a meteorite and he
03:06
said this is definitely
03:07
a meteorite that's killed a cow and
03:09
that's the only one there's a lot of
03:10
kind of possible people who've been
03:12
killed or things have been killed by
03:13
meteorites but this is the only one
03:15
with an actual certificate that says
03:17
that's what it is really
03:18
and did he just look at his doorstop
03:20
after all those years
03:22
and go well that actually does look a
03:23
bit like a meteorite i mean
03:25
how does it transpire that someone
03:27
suddenly decides to take their doorstop
03:29
to a science museum
03:30
i i think it was that the doctor was
03:32
visiting them
03:33
rather than them taking just every
03:34
single bit of rocks in their house
03:37
randomly to a museum is this what no
03:40
is this one no you get lucky in the end
03:45
um but then some people are a little bit
03:47
skeptical about it actually because
03:49
what they realized is because this is
03:51
now a famous meteorite because it killed
03:53
a cow
03:53
it's now worth 10 times more than it was
03:55
originally
03:57
okay so they're thinking maybe there's
03:58
something going dodgy going on here
04:00
and then there's another twist so around
04:03
the same area actually in chile in the
04:04
atacama there was a large
04:06
meteorite landed there and a load of
04:08
people collected it and this was a
04:09
really famous one
04:10
and it was it landed in a dry riverbed
04:12
called vaca muerta
04:14
how do you sorry how do you pronounce
04:15
that
04:20
sorry yeah
04:24
but whatever andy just said means dead
04:27
cow in spanish
04:28
and so the theory is that maybe these
04:30
people heard about this famous one
04:32
and that they went that gives me an idea
04:34
i'm going to pretend my cow got
04:35
oh wow hit by that and then when anyone
04:37
comes i'll have the rock
04:39
but then i can say oh no i ate the cow
04:41
right there but don't think
04:43
they do test these rocks right oh yeah
04:44
you can tell if a meteorite is a
04:46
meteorite yeah so
04:47
they test is rock i mean presumably they
04:49
did yeah so the meteorite is definitely
04:51
a meteor right yeah okay but the
04:52
question is did it kill the cow or not
04:54
oh that's what some people are skeptical
04:56
about right okay have you guys heard of
04:58
the nakhla meteorite which fell on egypt
05:00
in 1911.
05:01
nope so the the story is that it
05:03
vaporized a dog
05:05
oh yes but that is very much uh the
05:08
story of it as if there's no evidence
05:09
because obviously the dog was vaporized
05:13
which is what makes people think it's
05:14
not quite true yeah i read a really cool
05:16
story that um
05:17
people used to think that uh venus fly
05:20
traps
05:21
were aliens traveling on um meteorites
05:24
that landed on earth
05:25
because back in the day what are you on
05:27
about no this is
05:29
i read this on the bbc's website back in
05:31
the day what they used to
05:33
because venus fly traps would be very
05:34
unpredictable and where they came up
05:36
and they would go to places where they
05:37
would think a meteorite had landed and
05:39
very often they would see out of place
05:41
venus flytraps and it looks like an
05:42
alien and so they thought
05:44
it's an alien it only looks like an
05:47
alien because we've designed
05:49
alien things after it you know like
05:51
movies and stuff like that
05:52
yeah actually our aliens look like venus
05:54
fly traps you're right it's that way
05:56
around isn't it
05:56
yep but they did people used to
05:59
attribute
06:00
sorry dan but we're we're fine with
06:03
vaporizing dog story over here
06:08
yeah that was a very sad story it's a
06:11
poor dog
06:12
um they people make money out of meter
06:15
rides and
06:16
uh like so like you were saying people
06:18
would pay to come and see various
06:20
cows and um like anything that's sort of
06:22
been touched by a meteorite or
06:23
experienced a meteorite can then be sold
06:25
so there was one that smashed through a
06:27
car in new york
06:28
in 1992 smashed through the boot of the
06:30
car the trunk of the car
06:32
and the owner of the car had just bought
06:34
it for 400 and she was able to sell it
06:36
for 25 times that amount
06:37
straight afterwards and she was also
06:39
able to sell the original title to the
06:41
car from when she bought it
06:42
and a bulb from the rear tail light that
06:44
had been blasted out by the meteor right
06:47
wow wow is it worth it i emailed the
06:50
secretary of the american meteorology
06:52
um meteorological society um this is the
06:55
people who look after meteorites
06:57
and ask them what to do if i find the
06:59
meteorite and they said um
07:01
the protocol for collecting meteorites
07:03
ideally a fresh meteorite should be
07:04
collected immediately without touching
07:06
it
07:06
and placed in a plastic sealed bag how
07:09
do you do that without touching it
07:11
um it's the same procedure as for a dog
07:13
poo yeah
07:21
and you don't have the dog anymore
07:22
because it's been vaporized
07:26
do you guys know there are about 20
07:28
full-time meteorite hunters
07:30
in the world very uh rare career to have
07:33
and i think it was i think it was
07:34
national geographic they interviewed one
07:36
of them
07:36
he was a guy called michael farmer he
07:39
has been imprisoned for months in
07:40
oman because he went there he knew a
07:42
meteorite had landed he went to try and
07:44
find it and
07:44
he they locked him up saying you're not
07:45
allowed to take rocks out of a man but
07:48
uh he's been nearly killed but the one
07:50
thing he said in this interview which i
07:51
really liked was he said
07:53
i've eaten a small piece of every moon
07:55
rock and mars rock that i have purchased
07:57
or found
07:58
not many people can say they have eaten
07:59
a piece of the moon and then he said
08:01
and i know for a fact that numerous
08:03
scientists have done the same
08:06
do you think that you think they're
08:07
checking to see if it tastes of cheese
08:12
but i think you would you would do that
08:14
wouldn't you you give it a lick at least
08:17
yes i would want to see what it tasted
08:19
like but i wouldn't eat a small bit of
08:21
the moon
08:21
it feels somehow disrespectful to whom
08:25
the goddess cellini yeah
08:29
actually that's what you do isn't it
08:30
with um fossils and stuff isn't it
08:32
if you're not sure if you you've got a
08:35
fossilized dinosaur poo for instance you
08:37
can lick it
08:38
and it'll be slightly tacky to your
08:39
tongue
08:41
really come on it's a long time since
08:43
it's been in a dinosaur
08:45
if you find a plastic bag hanging up on
08:47
a tree and you're not sure if it's a
08:48
meteorite
08:49
do not do that almost like
08:53
farmers eat their soil don't they
08:55
sometimes
08:56
some farmers test their taste their soil
08:59
to see if it's fertile
09:00
and then the other way is by sitting
09:02
down with your bare bottom on the soil
09:04
yes what's that for if it's it's just
09:07
for sure
09:09
it's like to check if the check if it's
09:11
warm enough yeah um
09:13
yeah so the soil's warm enough if uh you
09:15
drop your trousers sit on it and
09:16
um it just not sort of saw does anyone
09:18
do anyone do that
09:20
no so it's not a common practice these
09:22
days but although i keep um a pair of
09:25
underpants buried in my back garden
09:27
we all do that um why do you do and
09:30
that's
09:31
this was official advice from someone or
09:33
other not to me
09:34
like to farmers and the idea is you put
09:37
your underpants in your back garden
09:39
and then you go back a few months later
09:40
and you check if they've been eaten away
09:42
by all the microbes and stuff
09:44
and you'll always know because the
09:45
microbes can't eat the elastic band
09:47
around the side of it but they can eat
09:49
the cotton
09:51
and the purpose to see how if i mean
09:54
no like if the bacteria have eaten them
09:56
then what then you've got good soil and
09:58
you can plant stuff and if they haven't
09:59
then you have to put some fertilizer in
10:01
also you've got a free thong at that
10:03
point
10:04
[Laughter]
10:06
[Applause]
10:09
so um i was reading i you know in movies
10:12
how
10:12
there's always it like a sci-fi movie
10:14
will start in the
10:15
in antarctica and a meteorite has landed
10:18
and
10:19
and it always antarctica always seems to
10:21
be associated with finding
10:22
big meteors meteorites and i thought i
10:25
was like is that because of the the
10:27
poles and it attracts as the meteorites
10:29
coming in
10:30
um and then i read this article it turns
10:32
out the reason they go there
10:33
is because they're much easier to find
10:35
because everything's white
10:36
so they just stick out isn't that
10:39
amazing i thought it was like some deep
10:41
amazing alien life kind of thing no it's
10:42
just like oh there it is
10:43
way easier so much more simple than
10:47
trekking through a forest
10:48
full of rocks also not many humans there
10:51
and
10:52
other people to disturb it right yeah
10:54
because they're black aren't they
10:55
meteorites that's sort of lessons on how
10:58
to spot them
10:58
and so another place where it's really
11:00
common for meteorites to be found is
11:02
morocco
11:03
so for a country of its size it's got
11:06
like
11:06
by multiple factors of 10 more meteorite
11:09
findings than
11:10
any other country of its size in the
11:11
world and this is just because this guy
11:13
in 2006 decided to start teaching people
11:16
how to spot a meteorite and it's become
11:18
a proper
11:18
career for a lot of the nomadic people
11:20
in morocco they go around finding
11:22
meteorites
11:23
so a lot of them make money out of this
11:25
and it's actually where the most
11:26
important meteorite probably ever found
11:29
was found it was one that came from mars
11:31
it was in 2011
11:32
and it's like this whole jumble of rocks
11:34
that are thrown together and also it's
11:35
kind of full of
11:36
old mars water so it's the first kind of
11:39
evidence that we have of that
11:41
but the the cool story about this is
11:43
that it was found by this guy who'd
11:45
had lessons that they have in morocco on
11:46
how to spot a meteorite and he saw it i
11:48
think it was on sale in the market it's
11:50
called the black beauty
11:52
um stone now but it was on sale in a
11:54
market and he looked at it he was
11:56
tempted and then he said no no i'm not
11:58
going to buy it he drove away
11:59
he changed his mind he drove back and
12:02
then he bought it
12:03
and he was driving he was on his way
12:04
back from the hospital from having a
12:06
gallstone removed
12:08
so he had one stone removed and then he
12:11
immediately got another stone
12:13
yeah you're saying this in the way that
12:15
dan says things sometimes
12:20
i thought is that what i sound like
12:24
i am so sorry
12:27
hey we need to move on shortly you guys
12:29
got anything before we do can i
12:30
give you a list of other things that
12:32
have been used as door stops over the
12:34
years yeah sure
12:36
it is unbelievable how careless people
12:38
are
12:39
um so it's just like everything valuable
12:42
you've ever heard of
12:42
in 2016 a chinese vars being used as a
12:45
doorstop was suddenly sold for 860
12:47
thousand dollars
12:48
in 2014 a chinese pot sold for 150
12:51
thousand dollars
12:52
uh ming vaz in 2012 sold for a million
12:55
the world's largest sapphire
12:57
in 1947 was found in queensland it'd
13:01
been used as a doorstop for nine years
13:03
until the owner looked a bit closer
13:06
a bronze age dagger that was worth fifty
13:08
thousand uh
13:09
in 1802 a lump of gold had been used as
13:12
a doorstop for three years
13:14
until a jeweler who was visiting this
13:15
house saw it and it sparked america's
13:18
very first gold rush so in north
13:19
carolina
13:21
and finally a can of tinned veal
13:24
that was left in the arctic by william
13:26
parry the explorer in 1825
13:29
it was rediscovered by another explorer
13:30
in 1829 and used as a doorstop for many
13:34
many years and finally opened in 1958
13:38
yeah it got that reaction i think from
13:40
the people who opened it as well
13:43
okay it is time for fact number two and
13:45
that is my fact
13:47
my fact this week is that there is a
13:48
unique species of ant
13:50
that only lives in 10 blocks of new york
13:53
city
13:54
they call it the manhattan so
14:03
this was sent in to me actually by a guy
14:05
called justin hintz and
14:07
it was that this biologist um discovered
14:09
this species event which lives between
14:11
63rd street and 76th street
14:13
in new york which is in broadway in
14:15
broadway manhattan yeah um
14:17
and uh yeah and they were they were
14:19
looking at it and they noticed that it
14:20
was unlike any of the 13 000 other
14:23
species of ants that have ever been
14:24
catalogued they thought it might have
14:25
come from europe but
14:26
they can't trace it to any known ant so
14:29
that is
14:30
they've got this one city dwelling that
14:32
has evolved to be its own
14:34
uh species and um how do you look
14:36
through look at an ant
14:38
and then immediately access your mental
14:40
catalogue of all the thirteen thousand
14:42
other hands
14:43
and just eliminate them all unless it
14:45
had something kind of
14:46
extremely different like it had an extra
14:49
leg
14:49
it was driving one of the yellow cabs
14:51
that's what that hasn't said
14:55
so they eat so much junk food and um
14:59
the scientists who were studying this
15:00
said that the pavement ant eats so much
15:03
um shifting their diets to more human
15:05
foods that it's actually changing the
15:06
chemical makeup
15:08
of their bodies to look more like humans
15:12
which sadly is not as exciting a
15:14
sentence as i thought it was
15:16
i think they mean internally as opposed
15:18
to like got a face
15:23
apps have got faces surely oh but just
15:26
imagine like my face on an egg
15:30
yeah so yeah there and they don't get
15:33
diabetes though so
15:34
that's uh that's the thing that
15:35
separates it so other ants get diabetes
15:38
do they
15:38
um no what
15:42
sorry compared to the humans who were
15:44
eating all the fast food i think was
15:45
your point right yes yeah yeah they're
15:47
very good at digesting it
15:48
fast food is actually sort of made for
15:49
ants it turns out exactly got it
15:52
the coming human ants don't get diabetes
15:54
so they can keep eating
15:55
the scientist who did that uh he was
15:57
called clint penick and he was talking
15:59
about the study he was interviewed about
16:00
it
16:00
and he said when he was doing the study
16:03
nobody ever talked to me
16:04
i basically was walking around and then
16:06
crouching down on the ground and huffing
16:07
something
16:08
off the sidewalk through this ridiculous
16:09
looking device and not a single new
16:11
yorker was like
16:12
hey what are you doing i guess i was not
16:14
the weirdest person on the street
16:16
now that suggested me that he was the
16:18
weirdest person on the street you don't
16:22
tend to talk to the weirdest person on
16:23
the street
16:24
that's not what everyone does so new
16:26
york has a few other species doesn't it
16:28
that's so unique to it they have
16:30
a unique centipede they have a sweet b
16:32
they have a white footed mouse with
16:34
small ears
16:35
they also found in new york in 2014 the
16:38
first new amphibian that's been found in
16:40
the state for 150 years
16:42
so a frog a leopard frog and so
16:46
for more than a century there's been two
16:48
types of leopard frog living
16:49
in new york and people have been arguing
16:51
over it scientists been arguing because
16:53
there seemed to be so much variety in
16:55
the different leopard frogs there was
16:57
this big debate that went on and
16:59
apparently lots of discord and backlash
17:01
from one scientist to another
17:02
about theories as to how come there was
17:04
so much variation with these two species
17:06
and a hermetologist in 1936 called carl
17:09
cofield
17:10
said actually i think this two species
17:12
might be three species
17:13
and it caused such massive controversy
17:15
and there was this bickering and all
17:17
this strife that people refused to
17:18
accept in the scientific literature
17:20
his theory was absolutely rubbished and
17:22
that was 1936 and then in 2014 we went
17:24
oh yeah he was right there was another
17:26
one
17:26
so quite sweetly it's called the uh rana
17:29
calfeldi
17:30
after him but presumably he's long dead
17:33
long dead yeah but
17:34
he's he's somewhere he's happy
17:37
and i think it's another new york um
17:39
discovered um
17:41
insect so this was um this is an insect
17:44
that doesn't live in new york but it was
17:45
discovered by a new york scientist
17:46
and it is a new type of beetle and they
17:49
didn't know it existed but they
17:50
discovered it because it was attached to
17:52
an
17:52
ant and what it does is this beetle when
17:55
it wants to get to places it goes up to
17:57
this ant
17:58
and it bites onto its anus and it grips
18:00
on
18:01
and flips underneath so the thorax it's
18:03
in between the thorax and the abdomen
18:05
and the at adam and admonium
18:09
oh sorry abdomen
18:12
okay
18:16
so they were studying this ant and they
18:18
were like it's got two of those and
18:21
and they shouldn't and it they shook it
18:23
and the beetle fell off and that's what
18:25
it did this is beetle has a unique way
18:26
of transporting itself by by biting the
18:29
bum
18:29
of the ant and and getting so does the
18:31
ant just think it's got two buns
18:33
i the ant doesn't seem to have an issue
18:36
with it yeah i don't
18:37
i don't know so amps are pretty amazing
18:40
i really like this and i've never heard
18:42
of it's called the azteca brevis and
18:43
it's in costa rica
18:45
and it catches prey that's more than 50
18:47
times as heavy and
18:48
as large as it is and it does this by so
18:51
they all work together and they nest in
18:53
a tree
18:54
but they build this network of tunnels
18:56
within the tree with tiny little
18:58
openings
18:58
um out through the tree bark that are
19:00
just big enough to fit the little ants
19:02
heads
19:02
and so so it looks a little bit like um
19:04
holy cheese like swiss cheese or
19:06
something
19:06
and their heads poke out and then a big
19:08
bit of prey will come along
19:10
like a termite or something and will
19:13
step on one of the holes or sort of one
19:14
of its legs will fall into the hole
19:16
and the ant will bite the leg with its
19:18
teeth so it's stuck
19:20
and then this thing kind of struggles to
19:21
get away and another leg falls into
19:22
another hole another ant bites its other
19:24
leg
19:24
and eventually all his legs end up in
19:26
the holes with ant's
19:28
teeth biting into it and then the other
19:30
ants all emerge and tear it to pieces
19:31
and have it for dinner but so it sort of
19:33
spread eagled on the screen
19:35
is there a happy ending at all to the
19:38
story
19:39
if you're if you're an ant oh sure it's
19:41
a hell of a nice story yeah
19:43
that's really horrific so just stuck
19:46
there sprawled out the scene in a zombie
19:48
film where all the hands come through
19:49
the wall
19:50
yeah i haven't seen that scene but it
19:51
sounds like it is like that um
19:53
i found an ant uh called cerakomirex
19:56
amebalis and it's a farmer ant
19:57
so it farms uh fungi it literally you
20:00
know makes little scrapings and grows
20:01
fungi to eat
20:02
but there's another species which is
20:04
called megalomermex sematicus
20:07
and it comes in it comes into the first
20:09
dance colony it doesn't do
20:10
any work it lives in the colony it eats
20:12
the fungus the first ant has made and it
20:14
also eats the babies
20:16
that the host is rearing and the hosts
20:19
do nothing about it they don't take
20:22
any defensive action that is not much of
20:24
a house guest isn't it
20:26
and then he stole their precious door
20:28
stop and up
20:31
yeah there was nothing in the fridge i
20:33
hope you don't mind so i ate the baby
20:36
but there's a reason that it's tolerated
20:39
and the reason is
20:40
that second ant contains a venom in its
20:42
body
20:43
which helps to repel an even worse
20:46
invader ant
20:47
so what is that guy doing though i don't
20:49
know what is worse than
20:51
eating the babies and i think maybe
20:53
those guys just completely destroy that
20:55
i don't know they might destroy the nest
20:56
or something but wow
20:57
yeah so they have to put up with these
20:59
really difficult guests because they
21:00
know that it's protecting them against
21:01
something worse
21:03
i was reading an article in uh cosmos
21:05
magazine about ants
21:07
and i'll just read the start of that in
21:09
a behavior that finds a broad comparison
21:11
with human tradition
21:12
a genus known as turtle ants pass on
21:15
possessions from older individuals
21:17
directly to younger ones
21:19
in a mechanism that does not however
21:21
find the human analog
21:22
they do so through their anuses
21:26
wait wait wait what about that scene in
21:29
pulp fiction with the guy who
21:31
puts the watch up his anus i haven't
21:33
seen that film
21:34
but well someone must know what i'm
21:36
talking about there was
21:37
there was definitely one guy up there
21:38
who got it immediately exactly
21:41
christopher walken puts a watch up his
21:42
anus then gives it to his son
21:44
so actually there is an analog in humans
21:46
[Laughter]
21:50
so these turtle ants basically it's like
21:52
a fecal transplant that they
21:53
the adults give to the babies and
21:56
basically
21:56
if you don't get that fecal transplant
21:59
from your parents
22:00
then you would starve because you
22:01
wouldn't have the right bacteria in your
22:03
stomach so they do need it
22:05
oh wow there's a story with a happy
22:07
ending
22:09
but a gross medal
22:12
there was going to be a really exciting
22:14
game there was a kickstarted game
22:15
um that reached funding it was called
22:18
ant simulator
22:19
um and it was a it was a it sounded
22:22
really cool so basically
22:23
you would manage an ant colony like you
22:25
would be the main
22:26
ant and you would be like get over there
22:28
this is this is one of those new york
22:30
campuses
22:31
[Laughter]
22:34
yeah and um so it looked really amazing
22:37
and it had i think three people who were
22:38
like the main people behind
22:40
it and unfortunately it's not happening
22:41
and the reason is because of
22:43
and they captured it i think perfectly
22:44
in the headline and simulator cancelled
22:47
after team
22:48
spends the money on boos and strippers
22:52
two of them went off had a massive night
22:55
and this guy had to make a video going
22:56
i'm so sorry ad simulator can't happen
22:58
anymore
22:59
and we can't give you back your money
23:01
either um that is typical entomologist
23:03
behavior you know they're always doing
23:05
that kind of thing
23:06
can't be trusted um we're gonna have to
23:08
move on soon to our next fact
23:10
they fake injury ants to uh get sympathy
23:14
so they carry their injured home
23:16
and ants have figured this out this is
23:18
the ronaldo ant isn't it i've seen this
23:21
it's amazing it just it just grazes a
23:24
leaf and it goes oh
23:27
i am so impressed that you knew the name
23:29
of anything
23:30
[Laughter]
23:32
so the ronaldo ant um
23:36
if they're injured they carry each other
23:37
home and so some ants really
23:39
overemphasize injuries so it was found
23:41
ants have been witnessed moving really
23:42
really slowly
23:43
um or limping or falling over i don't
23:46
know how an ant falls over but they do
23:48
in the hope of being carried but then if
23:49
no one helps they look around and then
23:51
they get back up and they walk on like
23:52
nothing's happened
23:54
[Laughter]
23:58
okay let's move on it is time for fact
24:01
number three and that is
24:02
chozinski in my fact this week is that
24:05
the slinky business
24:06
almost went bankrupt because the
24:08
slinky's inventor kept giving the
24:10
proceeds away to religious cults
24:14
it's amazing yeah so this is it the
24:17
slinky was invented by a guy called
24:18
richard james who is an engineer it was
24:20
invented in
24:21
1943 uh he worked in a navy shipyard and
24:24
he was working on a bit of equipment and
24:26
noticed
24:26
some springs acting oddly walking and so
24:30
he said to his wife i think i can make a
24:31
toy out of this and it was huge and it
24:34
sold
24:35
out and he got very rich and then he
24:38
turned to religion christianity to be
24:40
specific
24:41
and he started giving away all this
24:43
money and
24:44
his wife was like oh my god we were
24:46
almost broke we were almost completely
24:47
out of money
24:48
because he just gave it all away to
24:49
various cults and then he ran
24:52
away to bolivia to join one of them in
24:54
1960 and
24:55
did not speak to or see his family again
24:58
or the slinky
24:59
he he did he did occasionally write
25:02
letters to his wife betty urging her to
25:04
repent so that is something
25:06
yes yeah so the invention was an amazing
25:10
invention and it caught on
25:11
quite quickly with his initial batch he
25:13
sold something like 400 in 90 minutes
25:16
once
25:16
all they had to do was bring it to the
25:17
front of the store and just show people
25:19
it going down a couple of steps and it
25:21
just
25:21
everyone was like gotta have it and then
25:23
there was a few years where it just
25:25
he needed to get it manufactured and
25:26
people wouldn't buy into it
25:28
um but he not only invented the slinky
25:30
he invented the machine
25:32
that makes the slinky in a quick sort of
25:35
like
25:35
mass product way so a slinky and i don't
25:38
know if it's still to this day the same
25:40
length but the original slinkys that he
25:41
made if it was the coil was
25:43
laid out just straight as a coil it's 80
25:45
feet long each slinky
25:47
he created a machine that coiled it up
25:49
in 10 seconds
25:50
and then it was good to go so he has a
25:52
patent for an invention as well as the
25:54
toy invention
25:55
that's cool the patent for the original
25:57
slinky um said that it could be used as
25:59
both a child's amusement
26:01
and for parlor games oh okay
26:04
so i couldn't work out what parlor games
26:06
there might be
26:07
but i went on to the internet and
26:08
apparently there was once a game that
26:10
was sold
26:11
called slinkum and it was like a little
26:14
ramp and it had
26:15
boxes at the bottom like squares and you
26:18
put your slinky down the ramp on
26:19
whichever square it stopped in that's
26:21
the number of points you got
26:22
and obviously they weren't that
26:23
confident about how good a game it was
26:26
because the rules offers a bounty of 25
26:29
for anyone
26:29
offering the suggestion of an
26:31
improvement of the game
26:35
that's amazing so good do you know what
26:37
the uh
26:38
quality control is in the slinky factory
26:41
it's they they test whether or not they
26:44
can walk into their own box
26:47
wow if they can do that then they're a
26:49
high quality slinky down some stairs wow
26:52
i think they i think they put them down
26:53
some i think they put the boxes at the
26:55
bottom of stairs and their final
26:56
um challenge that is amazing it won't
26:59
work if it's too tight or too loose
27:00
won't walk in
27:01
what's you know another weird thing is
27:03
that um so he invented this
27:05
while he was working for the war effort
27:06
and it was a sort of the side project as
27:09
anna was saying
27:09
um found a toy when it fell off yeah so
27:12
what he was doing just
27:12
on that is there was a uh like a meter
27:15
which would tell you the horsepower of
27:17
the
27:17
ship that he was on and he needed a
27:19
dampening system to stop it from
27:21
bouncing around everywhere so he was
27:22
using
27:23
springs to do that and then this spring
27:24
happens to be great at doing other
27:26
things
27:27
yeah so he saw that and he made it as a
27:29
toy no intention for use of war
27:31
um then years later the vietnam war
27:33
happened and slinkies were actually used
27:35
in the war
27:36
because what they were fantastic at
27:38
doing was if you were stuck in the
27:39
middle of nowhere
27:40
you would throw a slinky up into a tree
27:42
and it could act as a sort of
27:44
antenna for radio signals that you
27:46
needed to be sending
27:47
so it ended up becoming a um
27:50
an actual use for war no way that's so
27:54
cool way wow
27:57
yeah here's a use for a slinky oh yeah
28:00
um you can use it to get rid of
28:01
squirrels
28:04
[Music]
28:07
you put a squirrel on one and then send
28:09
it down the stairs
28:10
no you don't do that and then it goes
28:12
into its box and you slam the lid shut
28:15
now what you do is you put it on your
28:16
bird feeder and then when the um
28:19
squirrel comes along he kind of grabs
28:21
onto the slinky and the weight pulls the
28:23
slinky down and he's kind of pulled down
28:24
in like a little elevator
28:26
ride there are videos online aren't
28:28
there they are unbelievable
28:31
hours of fun um so when you drop a
28:35
slinky
28:36
um the the bottom doesn't know that
28:38
you've let go of the top
28:40
first this is no this is yeah this is
28:43
true
28:43
i don't think it even knows it's a
28:44
slinky
28:45
[Laughter]
28:47
so this is my damn fact of the show and
28:51
i'm playing it now
28:53
check it out go home go to the slinky
28:56
cupboard and check it out
28:57
so it looks like it's floating the
28:59
bottom looks like it's floating because
29:01
it's a tension spring and when you're
29:02
like sorry
29:04
you're holding the slinky not scrunched
29:06
up right so you're holding
29:07
the very tip of it so it's really
29:09
dangling down a long way yeah the
29:11
squirrels just come off the bottom
29:12
exactly it's loose it's loose at the
29:14
bottom and when you let go of the as you
29:16
say the top bands
29:17
it takes time for the motion to tell the
29:20
bottom of the slinky
29:21
that the top and the tension have been
29:22
released and i read that you're not a
29:25
physicist are you andy not
29:26
well not by trade uh
29:30
but i've read i couldn't quite believe
29:32
this i read that this happens even to
29:34
solid objects so if you drop a steel rod
29:36
the top starts accelerating
29:38
before the bottom does yeah because the
29:41
vibrations need to travel down don't
29:42
they so
29:43
it's basically the tension is pulling up
29:46
at the same
29:46
rate as the gravity is pushing down yes
29:49
so the tension once you've released it
29:50
with your hand
29:51
it needs to travel down the slinky
29:53
before the slinky knows at the bottom oh
29:56
that tension's been released now and it
29:57
is amazing you should watch it on
29:59
youtube uh the slinky it just levitates
30:01
the bottom just levitates there's a very
30:03
good video on you know the veritasium
30:04
youtube channel
30:06
um wow is that do you make that channel
30:10
um and yeah it's incredible it's magic
30:15
it's magic you just ruined all the
30:16
science of it yeah
30:19
which i think we should say about the
30:20
slinky that the hero behind it wasn't
30:22
the guy who made it and then
30:24
turned to a bolivian cult it was his
30:26
wife betty who was the person who saved
30:28
it
30:28
so she became determined to make it work
30:31
and she
30:32
made this 450 mile weekly round trip to
30:35
the factory
30:36
and pumped all their remaining money
30:39
into it she gambled their entire
30:40
mortgage on a toy show in 1963 in new
30:43
york
30:43
hoping that people would go for it she
30:45
launched the advertising campaign she
30:47
gave it a jingle
30:48
and she suddenly built from her ruined
30:51
marriage
30:52
uh this great little toy and she i think
30:55
she uh it might have been her idea to do
30:56
the dog because the dog really gave it a
30:58
boost
30:58
yeah yes and a train as well so the dog
31:02
is picture toy story in your head and
31:04
the slinky dog
31:05
that's literally it and um when the
31:08
movie came out they weren't prepared for
31:09
the fact that it was going to be
31:10
massively popular so they just
31:12
they didn't have the quantities that
31:13
they need for uh for merchandise to come
31:15
out that point which seems
31:17
impossible as a thought doesn't it
31:18
because yeah well they they
31:20
they did a range of things which were
31:21
all slinkies in the middle and then
31:23
other things at the front of the back so
31:24
they did the dog they did the train
31:25
there was also a caterpillar
31:27
a hippo a fire engine a worm and several
31:29
more
31:30
but they all had the they're all the
31:32
same thing um
31:34
you can buy at the moment you can buy
31:35
sound effects slinky
31:37
uh for 12.99 and as it goes down it
31:40
makes a sound splat
31:42
boing and thwap well i kind of think the
31:46
sound is quite nice anyway isn't it what
31:47
a slinky makes
31:48
you could also for 153.99 by a 14 carat
31:53
gold-plated slinky
31:55
um just to keep your door open
32:02
oh we're gonna have to move on soon to
32:03
our next fact oh i was just looking at
32:05
some other toys
32:06
mr potato head the original mr potato
32:08
head uh did not come with the potato
32:11
head
32:11
it was just the bits on his face so
32:15
it's got you ordered a mr potato head or
32:17
you went and bought one and it was just
32:18
like bits of moustache uh if i think the
32:20
original one came with hands feet ears
32:22
two mouths two pairs of eyes four noses
32:25
three hats eyeglasses and a pipe but and
32:27
some felt for the moustache
32:29
but the idea was you would use you
32:30
should use one of your own potatoes
32:32
so you should put it in a real potato i
32:34
think i actually remember having one of
32:36
those
32:37
with an actual potato i believe so
32:39
unless you're going to tell me it was in
32:40
the 1920s or something
32:42
i think you might be lying about how old
32:44
you are james because
32:45
damn i haven't been down the date here
32:47
but i think it was in the early 70s when
32:49
they decided that i was alive in the
32:51
late 70s so maybe yeah do you remember
32:54
it they decided that the the pins needed
32:57
to jab into a potato were too
32:59
sharp and contravened health and safety
33:01
and so you could no longer stick it into
33:02
a real potato so they had to come with a
33:04
plastic potato
33:05
oh really yeah do you know who invented
33:07
paint by numbers
33:09
no i love that though yeah it was
33:11
michelangelo
33:14
not the turtle dam not the turtle
33:20
he's a party dude so um
33:24
he used to assign sections of his
33:26
ceilings for his students to paint
33:28
and the way that he would do it is he
33:29
put numbers there so they knew what to
33:30
paint
33:31
um but the modern one started in 1952
33:34
and macy's started selling this and a
33:37
few months later it became massive
33:38
because an amateur painter won third
33:40
prize at a san francisco art competition
33:43
by doing just the paint by numbers wow
33:46
and the press coverage just said that no
33:48
one could tell the difference between
33:49
real painting and this and then it
33:51
became
33:51
absolutely huge wow oh my god that's so
33:54
i can't believe michelangelo did that
33:57
yeah that's really funny yeah he ruined
33:59
his own profession in a way
34:00
because once you're painting by numbers
34:02
anyone can do it and that's why there
34:03
are no artists around today is because
34:05
we're all just doing paint by numbers
34:09
um okay should we move on to our final
34:11
fact of the show it's time for a final
34:13
fact of the show and that
34:14
is andy my fact is that when zebras are
34:18
running away from a lion they fart
34:20
loudly with every stride
34:27
and who's to say andy that you wouldn't
34:28
do exactly the same thing in that
34:30
situation
34:32
sure would fair play but they're quite
34:35
gassy animals and the motion propels the
34:39
gases out of their bodies when they
34:40
start rising push them forward quicker i
34:42
think it does yes
34:44
and you can hear them from quite a long
34:45
way away um so
34:47
this is uh there's a new book out and
34:49
it's called does it fart
34:51
and it's by uh nick caruso and danny
34:54
rabiot and it's an
34:55
absolutely fantastic book so they
34:57
they're scientists then they started
34:58
collecting animals
35:00
and writing little essays about whether
35:02
or not those animals fart
35:03
and they've it was a spreadsheet that
35:05
turned into a book which is my favorite
35:07
kind of book
35:10
and they just got information about all
35:12
kinds of things so there are
35:14
termites in there there are dinosaurs
35:16
dinosaurs the ruling is not anymore
35:18
um
35:21
there's a thing about uh termites the
35:23
amazing thing about termites termites
35:24
each produce
35:25
one half of one millionth a gram of
35:28
methane
35:29
per day okay so not very much however
35:32
unfortunately there are so many termites
35:34
that they produce between these this is
35:37
a wide range so
35:38
steady on but they produce between five
35:40
and 19
35:41
of methane emissions globally
35:44
between 1 5 and 19. that's a lot guys
35:50
kill them this is why the ants are
35:51
trying to kill them
35:53
that's your answer to every problem
35:56
[Applause]
35:57
well i've got a very hawkish approach to
36:00
termites yeah it does sound like an
36:04
incredible book
36:05
so a couple of other things is sloths
36:08
don't fart so most animals do fart slows
36:11
don't fart because their digestion is so
36:12
slow like all the rest of them
36:14
that it would take them so long to work
36:16
through the farting process that the
36:18
gases would build up inside them
36:19
and become poisonous and so instead they
36:22
are reabsorbed through their intestines
36:24
into their bloodstreams
36:25
and then those gases are taken up to
36:26
their lungs and they breathe them out
36:28
instead
36:31
i desperately want to know what a
36:32
slowest breath smells like
36:34
[Music]
36:36
the early morning used to be called
36:37
sparrow fart
36:39
which was just the time of day you know
36:41
sparrow fart it's so early that the
36:43
sparrows are farting i suppose
36:44
um but think about that sparrows don't
36:47
fart
36:47
do they not nope is that true of all
36:49
birds all birds
36:50
don't fart or no birds fart
36:56
why why do they not fire they've got
36:58
very short intestines
37:00
um and they poo very frequently and the
37:03
main reason is that they
37:04
uh so the reason you fart is that you
37:06
have a build up of gas which is due to
37:08
gas forming bacteria in your gut i think
37:10
we may have mentioned that before
37:11
so humans and mammals do have those
37:12
bacteria and birds don't so that's the
37:14
reason they don't
37:15
okay i was checking if humans
37:18
might fart if they're being chased by
37:19
stuff um and
37:22
james has been to the zoo today and
37:26
and i went on to runnersworld.com uh and
37:29
apparently
37:29
this is a problem that lots of runners
37:31
have that um
37:35
and they say that the reason is all that
37:39
people people have told me people told
37:40
me that's true sorry
37:42
i felt as i was agreeing with that it
37:44
was too enthusiastic
37:47
so anyway apparently what it is is it's
37:49
all the heavy breathing so
37:50
you're breathing you're taking in a lot
37:52
of gas and it has to go somewhere
37:54
and that's what happens really yeah
37:56
apparently and you need
37:58
you need to poo as well runner's
38:00
diarrhea is a serious problem
38:01
on running forums hey
38:04
[Laughter]
38:08
does anyone else feel like they're a
38:09
help group
38:12
sorry sorry i forgot everyone was here
38:14
um but
38:16
okay i do have a question and i'm not a
38:18
physicist but i do have this question
38:20
if you're running and you break wind
38:23
yeah yeah let's say you're running at 12
38:25
miles an hour
38:26
and you break wind at uh four miles an
38:29
hour out the other way
38:31
i presume that the wind that you break
38:33
is still traveling at eight miles an
38:35
hour
38:36
in your wake okay i've got a lot to tell
38:39
you about relativity
38:40
that's that's correct we'll do it after
38:42
the show okay
38:44
i think that works yeah yeah um
38:48
one other good farting animal is the
38:50
pupfish
38:51
so i think this is in the book as well
38:52
but it eats algae but it has the algae
38:55
has such high levels of gas in it that
38:57
the pupfish's
38:58
stomach inflates fully inflates and it
39:00
floats to the top of the water
39:02
and that's a really really bad place for
39:03
it to be because it exposes it to lots
39:05
of predators so the moment the pupfish
39:07
has
39:07
a meal of algae it has to fart to save
39:10
its own life
39:11
and so wow pops straight up to the top
39:13
and is desperately trying to expel wind
39:15
constantly to sink back down again
39:17
it's extremely stressful that's amazing
39:20
it's a race to the bottom for them
39:21
[Laughter]
39:25
maybe some stuff on zebras yeah here's
39:28
an amazing thing about zebras when
39:29
they're being chased by a lion not only
39:30
do they do what you said
39:32
but they only run about half their top
39:34
speed
39:35
when they're being chased by a lion what
39:38
so what basically what happens is
39:40
if you're going at your top speed and
39:41
you're running it's really easy for the
39:43
lion or whatever to tell where you're
39:44
going to be in like two strides time
39:46
so what they do is they go at half of
39:48
their speed and then when the line gets
39:50
anywhere near them they just go
39:52
in a different direction and then they
39:53
go really fast and then they'll slow
39:55
down to half their speed again
39:57
and then wait till the line gets to them
39:58
and then speed off really quickly again
40:00
wow that's smart that isn't that's very
40:02
very clever yeah
40:04
did you read about this ridiculous story
40:06
in 2001
40:08
where some farmers brought in the uk
40:10
bought a shetland pony
40:12
you know a really small pony and then
40:14
they
40:15
were surprised when they woke up one
40:16
morning and they went out into the field
40:18
and there was their shetland pony in
40:19
there but also
40:20
a tiny tiny zebra and it was because
40:24
they hadn't realized they'd bought a
40:25
pregnant shetland pony and they bought
40:27
it from a wildlife sanctuary where it
40:28
was sharing a field with a zebra
40:30
what what
40:33
the women did say we had thought that
40:35
she was getting fatter
40:36
but it really was a bit of a shock when
40:38
we got up one morning and we saw that
40:40
full zebra was there we realized then
40:42
what had happened
40:45
that's i have a related fact to that
40:47
which is that i think it's in georgia
40:49
there are
40:50
there are dogs who are supposed to be
40:51
guarding sheep and they keep on
40:53
having sex with the wolves they're meant
40:55
to be defending the sheep
40:57
from well i guess it would put the
41:00
wolves off
41:01
what they were supposed to be doing
41:02
that's true it was an action method
41:05
but they keep on they keep testing and
41:07
they keep testing
41:08
the dogs as well and finding out oh
41:09
you're half wolf because your
41:11
parents were a wolf and a dog that is
41:14
amazing yeah but in the line of duty
41:16
james bond does it all the time

hello and welcome to another episode
01:41
of no such thing as a fish
01:44
a weekly podcast this week coming to you
01:47
live
01:48
from brisbane
01:54
my name is dan schreiber and i am
01:56
sitting here with anna chazinski
01:59
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
02:01
and once again we have gathered around
02:03
the microphones with our four favorite
02:04
facts from the last seven days
02:06
and in no particular order here we go
02:10
starting with you andy my fact is that
02:13
during prohibition in america
02:15
the cops responsible for busting
02:17
speakeasies did so
02:18
dressed as grave diggers farmers
02:21
statues opera goers cowboys
02:24
judges bums and old italian matrons
02:29
what was what was the penultimate one
02:31
there bums yeah okay
02:33
yeah like homeless people homeless
02:35
people
02:36
what was this they weren't dressed as
02:39
bottoms
02:40
yeah on their way to a fancy dress party
02:44
although they probably could have done
02:45
they would they were incredible they had
02:46
there were two
02:47
agents and they had this massive they
02:49
were the best prohibition
02:50
enforcing agents uh so prohibition 1919
02:53
to 1933
02:54
alcohol sales were banned across america
02:57
and um
02:58
there were these guys called isidore
03:00
einstein and mo smith
03:01
and they arrested 4 900 people
03:05
in wow yeah i know and the conviction
03:07
rate was 95
03:08
they were incredible but they were
03:10
mainly famous for their disguises
03:12
so they had a dressing up box um they
03:14
dressed as tram conductors
03:16
or opera singers sometimes they went to
03:18
the democratic national convention
03:19
disguised as politicians but where were
03:21
they so like if they were opera singers
03:22
were they just going to bars and just
03:24
being like hello
03:26
and what does another single look like i
03:27
guess is the question yeah sometimes
03:29
they would
03:30
there were some bars which were next to
03:32
uh opera
03:33
houses i think um but they yeah go on
03:36
they like to go for all the different um
03:38
countries as well didn't they all the
03:39
different nationalities
03:41
so apparently um they dressed as a
03:42
german pickle packer
03:44
a pope i mean that's just nice to say
03:47
isn't it
03:49
a polish count a hungarian violinist
03:52
a yiddish gravedigger a french maitre d
03:55
an italian fruit vendor and a russian
03:57
fisherman
03:59
they were incredible supposedly einstein
04:01
smith both dudes once posed as husband
04:03
and wife
04:04
which is a much easier costume for one
04:06
of them than it is for the other
04:08
because these were two big guys and they
04:09
said that no one would no one suspected
04:11
them of being prohibition agents
04:12
because they just looked unlikely so the
04:14
pickle thing and everyone was so pissed
04:16
they didn't notice
04:18
sometimes they would go up to a bar and
04:20
they'd say i'm a prohibition agent let
04:22
me in
04:22
and they would say yeah very funny in
04:24
you go and then they go and arrest
04:25
everybody
04:27
wow that's like jediism so that happened
04:30
once did it he had the prohibition badge
04:32
on his coat
04:33
and he said to him would you sell a pint
04:35
of whiskey to a deserving prohibition
04:37
agent wink wink like pretending that he
04:40
wasn't
04:40
and the guy said oh yeah of course there
04:42
you go that badge is amazing where'd you
04:44
get it from and he said
04:45
i'll show you where it came from and
04:47
then took him straight down the station
04:49
wow they also said props were very
04:52
important to their whole act didn't they
04:54
they realized they were
04:55
auditioning for the circus at all times
04:57
but um they love props so they kept with
04:59
them
05:00
in their you know in their satchel a
05:01
string of fish apparently
05:03
a pitcher of milk some trombones uh
05:07
is this mary poppins is satchel when you
05:10
said a picture of milk do you mean
05:12
i don't mean a milk portrait james hi we
05:14
are we are milk photographers and we'd
05:16
like to come into your bar please
05:20
but the best prop they had was this
05:22
thing that one of them
05:23
invented i think it was izzy who
05:25
invented it is the einstein was an
05:27
artificial gullet
05:28
and this was so that he could pretend to
05:31
drink in a bar
05:32
without actually having to drink because
05:34
then he's sort of condoning the drinking
05:36
um so it was not sufficient it was a
05:38
rubber bag that he hid inside his shirt
05:40
it was connected by a rubber tube
05:41
to a funnel that was sewn into his vest
05:44
pocket
05:44
and so he'd ask for a drink the obama
05:47
would serve him a drink and then he
05:48
pretended to drink it while actually
05:49
pouring it into his front pocket
05:51
where it got siphoned into this sack
05:53
that he was hiding in his belly
05:56
that's amazing i like the tricks as well
05:58
because um these guys were playing
06:00
tricks on the
06:01
on the drinkers but also the people
06:03
manufacturing the alcohol who were known
06:04
as the moonshiners
06:06
um they had amazing tricks as well to
06:08
get past the
06:09
the agents who were trying to bust them
06:11
my favorite one is they developed
06:12
these things that were shoes that had
06:14
cow hooves on the bottom
06:16
so it when it looked like they'd found
06:18
some tracks of a human
06:20
making moonshine oh no it's just a cow
06:22
oh it's just a cow walking along on two
06:24
legs
06:25
towards this abandoned still of alcohol
06:28
well
06:29
we'll never solve it
06:32
it was amazing these guys they these
06:34
guys einstein and smith they arrested
06:36
180 rabbis
06:37
um and sometimes they so einstein was
06:39
jewish himself and he once got told that
06:42
um
06:42
he didn't look jewish enough to go into
06:43
this bar which really annoyed him
06:45
because he was jewish but he was a
06:46
prohibition agent
06:47
so he sent along a non-jewish agent uh
06:50
and who
06:50
who did get it and then arrested them
06:51
anyway well izzy einstein went into a
06:54
bar once
06:55
and the barman recognized him and he
06:57
said that's you that um
06:59
is the epstein isn't it and the guy said
07:02
don't you mean izzy einstein and then
07:04
they got into a big argument
07:06
and izzy said i bet you one drink that
07:08
it's izzy einstein
07:12
they bet the drink and when he poured in
07:13
the drink he cuffed him and said
07:15
i got some pretty bad news for you here
07:16
guys
07:20
people weren't very stupid in
07:21
prohibition weren't they on both sides
07:23
but the rabbi thing is interesting
07:25
because one of the only ways you could
07:27
get alcohol during prohibition at least
07:29
at the start for a bit laxat was if
07:31
you're a priest or a rabbi because
07:32
you might need wine in your any
07:34
religious rituals and so suddenly
07:36
uh the number of priests and rabbis
07:39
really
07:39
skyrocketed during this period
07:43
and in california where there are a lot
07:44
of catholics very catholic region
07:46
suddenly the amount of wine being made
07:48
for the sacrament increased by 700
07:50
percent
07:52
everyone extremely religious i like that
07:55
um they're used to other methods that
07:56
they would sort of get the alcohol
07:58
is um from the canadian border they
08:01
would fire
08:02
alcohol torpedoes underneath the great
08:05
lakes
08:06
towards the american side yeah so yeah
08:08
so there was there was an agent who was
08:09
sitting in the lake one day fishing and
08:11
this thing just went underneath them and
08:12
there was that and they found it and it
08:14
was a torpedo packed with
08:15
alcohol on the inside well because they
08:17
used to the boats when
08:18
they were smuggling sort of whiskey in
08:21
let's say
08:21
sometimes there'd be a police raid on
08:23
the boats and so a lot of boats suddenly
08:24
dump all their whiskey
08:26
and disappear let's say they're coming
08:27
up to coney island and so it used to
08:28
actually wash up on beaches you'd be
08:30
on the beach and a whole case of whiskey
08:33
would just wash up for you wow
08:34
it was a great time i found a happy time
08:39
they also
08:40
used to put them in canned fruit so you
08:42
know there's a liquid with the fruit
08:43
well the liquid would be the alcohol
08:45
so they would do that yeah and and what
08:47
you were saying about the agents
08:49
um they they had a sort of interesting
08:51
situation with their agents where some
08:53
of them were amazing
08:54
and doing these fancy dress box things
08:56
but other ones they were so
08:58
underpaid that they were susceptible to
09:00
bribes so they were being paid to
09:02
be prohibition agents they were being
09:04
paid less than garbage collectors were
09:06
being paid
09:07
so they were really susceptible to these
09:09
bribes and one in ten of the prohibition
09:10
agents actually got dismissed from being
09:12
caught for taking bribes
09:14
there's a huge rate of yeah using them
09:16
as smugglers themselves
09:17
so they tried to bring prohibition to
09:19
australia
09:24
you had a vote in queensland in the
09:26
1930s and you voted against it in
09:28
enormous numbers
09:33
the biggest democratic turnout
09:38
but there was one place where they did
09:40
have it and that was in the australian
09:41
capital territory
09:42
okay um bunch of squares right guys
09:46
yeah cool well kind of but for a little
09:49
while the only place where you could get
09:51
alcohol in the um
09:52
capital territory was in parliament
09:53
house wow
09:55
everyone else had to go over the border
09:57
but you could get it in there and the
09:58
guy who's behind this whole law was a
10:00
guy called king
10:01
o'malley and he according to wikipedia
10:04
is particularly remembered for his role
10:05
in the establishment of the commonwealth
10:07
bank
10:08
the selection of canberra as a national
10:09
capital and taking the u out of the name
10:12
of the australian labour party
10:14
really that was him equally important
10:18
contributions to
10:19
the elimination of australia people who
10:21
campaign are very
10:22
interesting like people who are so
10:24
devoted to campaign so there was
10:26
there was one woman called carrie nation
10:28
this was after maine outlawed alcohol in
10:30
1851 so they did it well before the rest
10:32
of the states
10:33
but the law was repealed she was really
10:35
unhappy that alcohol was on sale again
10:36
so um she and her associates
10:40
would smash up bars with axes this is a
10:43
very devout
10:43
uh sweet looking christian lady dozens
10:46
of women would turn up and sing hymns
10:47
and then carrie would smash the bar with
10:48
an axe
10:50
and she was frequently being fined but
10:51
she paid all the fines by selling
10:53
souvenir axes
10:57
it was very much a women's movement
10:59
thing a lot of it wasn't it and to be
11:01
fair there's a lot of problems with
11:02
alcohol and sort of wife beating at the
11:03
turn of the century a lot of violence
11:05
but um yeah the women's movement they
11:07
used to have a lot of temperance
11:08
meetings about how to make prohibition
11:10
work because it wasn't working
11:11
there were a few meetings where they
11:13
suggested ways of punishing drinkers
11:15
more
11:16
some of these suggestions that women put
11:17
forward were that people caught drinking
11:19
or selling alcohol we should say because
11:21
it wasn't illegal to drink it was
11:22
illegal to sell alcohol wasn't it
11:24
people caught selling alcohol should it
11:26
be sterilized
11:28
one woman suggested they should be
11:29
locked up in a bottle-shaped
11:31
cage in town centers so that people
11:33
could walk past and cheer at them
11:35
and another one suggested they should be
11:36
hung by the tongue from a plane
11:38
and flown over the us whoa
11:42
someone needs a drink
11:46
calm down such a resource heavy
11:49
punishment as well
11:52
one plane per person
11:57
no because you could you could get more
11:58
than one person on a plane
12:00
it depends on the size of the play if
12:02
you've got a like a a like a brianna or
12:04
an easyjet
12:05
budget airline yeah equivalent here
12:08
jetstar
12:16
it doesn't count when you ask the
12:18
audience for the local rep what's um
12:20
what's a good bit to say here
12:24
hey we need to move on uh in a sec to
12:26
our next fact oh can i i've got such a
12:28
good bootlegging
12:29
trial uh this was in la and
12:32
there was a trial that was uh
12:35
looking into whether someone had been
12:37
bootlegging had been illegally selling
12:38
alcohol
12:39
but it all turned on its head and in the
12:41
end the jury itself
12:43
ended up being put on trial after they
12:45
drank all of the evidence
12:49
okay it is time for fact number two and
12:52
that
12:52
is chozinski my fact is that spider
12:56
wrestling was banned in the philippines
12:58
because children found it more
12:59
entertaining than going to lessons
13:03
which is unsurprising really uh it's so
13:05
it's a big deal in the philippines it
13:06
has been for a number of decades
13:09
and there are lots of instances of
13:11
educational districts banning it
13:13
and so the earliest i could find is a
13:14
1982 article but there's a 2003 report
13:17
which says
13:18
loads of districts um banned spider
13:20
wrestling because it turned out there
13:22
was a lot of truancy because boys were
13:23
going out and hunting spiders
13:25
for their wrestling matches rather than
13:27
going to school and also
13:29
it was thought to be a slippery slope on
13:31
the road to being a gambling addict
13:33
and it's still it's still kind of as
13:34
it's thought as a first step on the way
13:36
to a serious gambling problem and it's
13:38
basically school boys
13:39
and always boys never girls in the
13:41
philippines uh find two spiders and they
13:43
pull them on a stick
13:44
and they make them fight each other and
13:45
then they put tiny amounts of money on
13:47
it i like the way you said
13:48
in the philippines as if in the uk it's
13:50
just girls doing it
13:52
it's a it's a very feminist game in the
13:54
uk yeah yeah yeah
13:55
equal representation it does sound
13:56
pretty um exciting
13:59
oh yeah how's it boy
14:03
well they wrestle until one of them is
14:04
overpowered and they're you know there
14:05
are various sometimes they separate them
14:07
um before they kill each other these
14:09
spiders um
14:10
which must be very hard i imagine hey
14:12
break it up there
14:14
above some of the formal fights i can't
14:18
believe there are formal fights but
14:19
there are formal fights
14:20
they have polystyrene foam on the ground
14:21
so a spider won't hurt itself if it
14:23
plummets
14:24
from the stick despite the fact that
14:25
famously spiders are not hurt when they
14:27
fall to the ground
14:28
is that famous it's i think you're
14:31
thinking of cats
14:33
i'm thinking of cats you have been
14:36
fighting the wrong animals
14:38
i've only researched cat fighting guys
14:42
very much a women's sport cat fighting
14:46
oh no technically though that was
14:49
that was genius just on a technical
14:53
i don't know i should say how i should
14:54
say how a spider can win
14:56
at a spider fight oh yeah because there
14:57
are any spiders listening
15:00
here's some hot tips a if you kill the
15:02
other spider you've won
15:03
well done if you seriously enter the
15:05
other spider you've won or if you manage
15:07
to wrap the other spider in a cocoon
15:08
then you have won and some spiders try
15:12
to escape
15:12
as you would by dropping off the stick
15:14
and weaving a thread so hanging on a
15:16
thread but if your spider does that
15:17
three times it's disqualified and you've
15:19
lost
15:20
wow so you can't get away that easy i
15:23
was looking into
15:24
um different spiders and their fighting
15:26
abilities that if they were brought to
15:28
the fight what they could bring
15:29
so they are the same species i guess
15:31
these ones must be in the philippines i
15:33
guess
15:33
there's a particular species that gets
15:34
used a lot called the argiop spider
15:36
which is apparently a pretty cool
15:38
spider in the ring or on the stick but
15:40
dan you've got some better ones oh so
15:42
yeah so this is just spiders from around
15:44
the world so there's uh the different
15:45
fighting styles that you could have
15:46
there's the fishing spider who is
15:48
who uses the patience uh style plays
15:51
cards with it
15:52
yeah so so it weights on the edge of the
15:56
water just silently that would have
15:57
worked really well if that wasn't a one
15:58
player game
16:03
but technically brilliant
16:07
sorry dad well no it sits on an edge of
16:09
a water and it it just patiently waits
16:11
until it sees the prey coming and then
16:13
it goes for it and it has a great
16:14
success but it stays very still so
16:16
that's the patience
16:17
there's the spitter which is the
16:18
spitting spider it spits a mixture of
16:21
venom glue and
16:22
silk at its prey so it captures it and
16:24
it kind of
16:25
kills it with the venom so that's an
16:27
amazing technique that you could use
16:28
there's the mimic this is one that uses
16:31
a little bit of silk
16:32
where they emulate a female moth and
16:34
they attract male moths to the scent and
16:36
they land on it and they get stuck and
16:37
they bring them up
16:38
and then they kill them and then there's
16:39
the vibrato hang on
16:41
no go on
16:44
well i just can i the moth one is not
16:46
spider versus moth these fights
16:48
does it make does it trick the other
16:49
spider into thinking well it's a moth
16:51
where's my spider opponent
16:52
and then it bounces no you're right i've
16:54
gone i've gone mixed species martial
16:56
arts there
16:56
it's yeah that is definitely no use for
17:00
uh for that
17:02
um yeah the vibrator is a nice one this
17:05
is the um well it goes on to other
17:08
spiders webs
17:10
and it mimics the vibrations of an
17:13
insect that's caught
17:14
or another spider walking across it but
17:16
it doesn't get stuck itself and then the
17:18
spider comes to eat its prey but then
17:19
gets eaten itself
17:21
yeah but you can't really put spiders of
17:23
different species against each other can
17:25
you because they're just so different
17:26
you kind of like have a tarantula
17:28
against a money spider because that's
17:29
just not gonna work well there are
17:30
weight categories so that wouldn't work
17:32
[Laughter]
17:34
just because the longest spider sperm is
17:37
twice as long as the smallest spider
17:39
it's just a fact i have here but it's an
17:41
example of the difference between the
17:43
different spiders
17:44
what fighting style would that be cool
17:47
it's like the drowning style oh my
17:49
goodness
17:51
um crickets fight as well oh yeah yeah
17:54
you have crickets
17:54
uh who well they're made to fight by
17:57
evil humans but um
17:59
this was a a huge thing in china and it
18:01
was banned during communist times
18:02
because it was seen to be a bourgeois
18:03
hobby
18:04
making crickets fight each other but
18:06
they are given herbal baths
18:08
uh before each fight they are except
18:10
they're incented i'm not kidding
18:12
they put in put near water with herbs in
18:14
it um
18:15
they're given uh a maggot before a fight
18:18
to incentivize them
18:19
they are trained by fighting their
18:21
coaches holding mouse whiskers
18:23
to see if they can successfully wrestle
18:25
you know like a sparring thing
18:27
and they get uh conjugal visits from uh
18:29
lady crickets
18:30
as well they do do they yeah do they
18:32
they do they
18:34
before a fight because i was reading one
18:37
trainer saying that it relaxes them if
18:38
they get to have sex before a fight
18:40
these crickets right because like you
18:42
would hear about sports people
18:43
not having sex before fights cricketers
18:46
for example
18:47
yes crickets cricketers all right
18:50
that was technically very good thank you
18:52
james
18:53
well in these um in in so in these
18:55
qriket fights i did try and find out
18:57
whether any
18:57
people cheat in the qriket fights but it
18:59
turns out that if you google
19:01
cricket cheats
19:02
[Laughter]
19:04
it's very hard to find
19:06
[Laughter]
19:08
but the chinese cricket thing um is it
19:10
is amazing because culturally it was
19:12
very much part of the emperors used to
19:14
have crickets in their
19:15
bedside table basically um because
19:18
people would go to sleep to the sound of
19:19
qrikets it would be very relaxing
19:21
still to this day 63 million dollars is
19:24
spent
19:24
annually on tending to pet crickets um
19:27
and like the spiders there's no casualty
19:29
in the cricket fighting they sort of
19:31
gnash their teeth at each other
19:33
and then the loser is the first cricket
19:35
to just turn away just be like oh i
19:36
can't do this anymore
19:37
and it's like up game over uh yeah mr
19:40
cricket number one wins
19:42
they train they do treat the spiders
19:44
very well as well in the philippines
19:45
they're trained up and they're given
19:46
this special diet like proper athletes
19:49
and they're fed on chili peppers because
19:51
that's thought to make them a bit more
19:52
aggro
19:52
and then they're starved for the day
19:54
before the fight because again that
19:56
makes you kind of angry
19:58
and uptight but it's thought that the
20:00
best spider to get is one that lives on
20:02
electricity lines because
20:03
the electricity pulsing through your
20:05
body gives you special kind of magic
20:06
powers like a super spider
20:08
and so they're the most don't say whoa
20:09
that's not true
20:11
this is the opinion of 10 year old boy
20:13
stan
20:13
[Laughter]
20:16
to make a whip spider really aggressive
20:18
you can shave its legs
20:21
really because they are notably third
20:23
wave feminists and they don't
20:25
like that kind of thing they're not
20:27
doing it for you they're not doing it
20:28
for anybody
20:31
why does that piss them off well
20:33
basically what it is is um they kind of
20:35
rather than normally fight they do air
20:37
punches at each other
20:38
and the way that you feel it is in the
20:40
hair on your legs
20:42
and so if it can't feel the air punches
20:44
of the other guy it doesn't recognize
20:46
that it's being
20:46
aggressive towards it and so then it
20:48
will be more aggressive towards the
20:50
other spider
20:51
so the way they fight is essentially by
20:53
fanning each other
20:56
pretty much a lot that's hardcore than i
20:59
thought
21:01
do you know how um uh scientists do
21:03
experiments on black widow spiders i
21:04
just really like this
21:06
uh no they have to do they have to
21:08
intimidate black widow spiders but
21:09
obviously black wood is
21:10
quite dangerous um so they do they have
21:12
uh jelly fingers
21:14
and they have to prob the black widow
21:15
with a gender 10 finger oh really
21:18
yeah that's rather sweet that makes
21:20
sense it does make sense it makes
21:21
perfect sense
21:24
it would be a more interesting fact if i
21:25
said do you know how they do it they
21:27
just go right in there and risk me in
21:28
person
21:31
um female spiders quite scary to male
21:34
spiders very often obviously we know
21:35
there's a lot of cannibalism in the
21:36
spider world
21:37
females are always eating the males
21:38
rather than having sex with them often
21:40
just before it instead they decide
21:41
they're hungry rather than horny
21:43
and spiders have developed all these
21:45
ways to combat that male spiders so
21:47
there's one male spider that
21:49
emits this airborne chemical which is
21:50
kind of like the
21:52
row hypno of the spider world it like
21:54
knocks out well it doesn't
21:55
it makes her kind of woozy so this
21:58
chemical makes her a bit sleepy and she
21:59
doesn't fight back
22:00
and she doesn't eat him and then there's
22:02
another one which
22:03
practices bondage so male spiders will
22:07
sort of play a bit of footsie yeah
22:10
that's someone who's in danger of being
22:12
eaten by their partner um
22:16
they start tickling their legs and then
22:18
really quickly weave the silk all around
22:20
them so they tie their legs together and
22:21
then they can have sex with them again
22:23
without being eaten
22:24
it's called a bridal veil when some
22:26
spiders do that
22:27
they they that's so much nicer than you
22:28
saying it was bondage
22:31
some this is nursery web spiders they
22:33
have to tie females down with silk
22:35
shackles basically not to be eaten and
22:37
scientists know this because they
22:38
decided to block up the male's
22:40
spinnerets so they couldn't uh weave the
22:44
weave the thing over the female and then
22:46
the the males always got eaten in those
22:48
experiments
22:49
which is pretty rough on the mail yeah
22:51
it says we're just going to take away
22:52
the one thing you can do to defend
22:54
yourself
22:55
here you go good luck on your date
22:57
[Laughter]
23:00
i found a couple of things this fact was
23:02
about
23:03
this practice of spider wrestling being
23:06
banned in the philippines
23:07
so i looked into a few other things i've
23:08
been banned in the philippines um
23:10
and just one that i thought was really
23:12
interesting um their
23:14
president duterte very recently banned
23:17
tourists from going to a place called
23:18
boracay this is just this is fresh in
23:21
the news as we're recording it
23:22
this is one of the top tourist
23:24
destinations that they have in the
23:25
philippines it
23:26
turns over an annual one billion dollars
23:29
it's massive for them
23:30
and it's because of a few hundred
23:32
businesses had sewerage waste problems
23:34
that they weren't dealing with
23:35
so he's shut it down for six months so
23:37
one of the leading tourist
23:38
places in the world right now is
23:41
complete lockdown no one is allowed to
23:42
go to
23:43
so financially it's going to absolutely
23:45
ruin them it's going to be very
23:46
interesting
23:47
and then this is really weird supposedly
23:49
the song
23:50
my way by frank sinatra has been banned
23:52
by karaoke use
23:54
in uh the philippines not officially but
23:56
most people have taken it off is that
23:58
because the only way is duterte's way
23:59
[Laughter]
24:01
this has been sort of over 10 or so
24:03
years
24:04
people have been getting into violent
24:06
fights there's been deaths off the back
24:07
of people getting up and going i'm going
24:09
to sing my way start singing it why
24:11
they think that they're just saying
24:12
something of huge arrogance on stage
24:15
it's what they think they haven't got
24:16
great answers but there's been like six
24:18
deaths associated
24:20
with my way at karaoke and so they've
24:22
just taken it off all the machines going
24:24
we can't afford a death in our karaoke
24:27
club let's sing bee gees instead
24:30
stay inside
24:39
all right let's move on okay it is time
24:42
for fact number three
24:43
and that is my fact my fact this week is
24:46
that there are more people
24:47
pretending to be vikings in the game
24:50
vikings
24:51
war of clans than there were ever actual
24:54
vikings on earth
24:57
it's not incredible it's amazing yeah so
24:59
i i got sent this fact in by
25:01
a very good friend of the podcast he's
25:02
appeared on a few times he's called
25:04
levan skyra
25:05
a belgian scientist comedian and um he
25:08
was watching a video which they
25:09
explained that there were 20 million
25:10
vikings
25:11
uh on this on this game and growing and
25:14
so he he went to verify it he
25:16
he went to a page on wikipedia that
25:17
showed the total population of
25:19
scandinavia in the year one thousand
25:21
he found it was less than one million um
25:23
vikings lasted from the year 793 to
25:25
1066. so about 300 years
25:28
roughly 12 generations that would leave
25:29
to 12 million vikings
25:31
uh so and that's if all the
25:32
scandinavians were viking so it's a big
25:34
number
25:35
underneath the 20 million so we have
25:36
more vikings in this game
25:38
than ever where in real life i would
25:39
still back the actual vikings in a fight
25:41
against the people playing this game
25:45
i was looking at some other games to see
25:47
if there were more
25:48
of the real things than the actual
25:50
players oh okay yeah i was looking at
25:51
farmville
25:52
do you remember farmville yeah so at one
25:55
stage
25:56
there were 311 million people playing it
25:58
worldwide
26:00
do you think there are more or less
26:01
actual farmers in the world
26:04
more i mean there are far fewer than
26:06
that more i
26:07
i say it's exactly the same exactly
26:11
so the number two um the internet seems
26:14
to think there are 570 million farms in
26:17
the world so they're a little bit off
26:19
damn was right yeah that's a very rare
26:21
occurrence
26:23
fifa 18 came out in 2018
26:27
and their number of users went up to 1.6
26:29
million
26:30
now do you think there are more or fewer
26:32
footballers actual footballers in the
26:34
world
26:34
than that professional footballers
26:36
people who are signed up to
26:38
fifa most footballers oh fewer i don't
26:40
think there are 1.6 million footballers
26:42
okay according to fifa there are 265
26:46
million
26:46
footballers in them we wouldn't know if
26:49
there was
26:50
i know but this is according to fifa on
26:52
their actual website you get everyone
26:53
together you've got one
26:54
footballer to two farmers
26:56
[Laughter]
26:59
our priorities are way out of black
27:03
because they have to fight over the same
27:05
field as well yeah
27:07
apparently and this is genuinely
27:09
according to fifa there are 26 million
27:11
registered footballers in china
27:13
and that is more than the population of
27:15
australia which is 24 million
27:17
[Laughter]
27:18
wow it's too many it can't be
27:21
um i found a few weird games that exist
27:24
uh as
27:25
online games as digital games um so
27:27
donald rumsfeld the former
27:29
secretary of defense of america in the
27:31
bush administration administration he
27:32
released a game
27:33
really yeah it's called churchill
27:35
solitaire and it's a game that churchill
27:37
used to play it was it was sort of
27:38
different rules and churchill was
27:40
obsessed with it
27:40
and so donald rumsfeld teamed up with
27:43
this team to do it
27:44
um he learned it from a man who used to
27:46
play it with
27:47
winston churchill and so he thought
27:49
these are amazing rules
27:50
and when they released the game this is
27:52
the quote from the company that released
27:54
it
27:54
mr rumsfeld can't code he doesn't much
27:57
even know how to use a computer
27:59
but he was guided by his young digital
28:00
minded associates who assembled the
28:02
video games with the same method he used
28:04
to rule the pentagon
28:05
a flurry of memos called snowflakes as a
28:07
result churchill solitaire is likely to
28:09
be the only video game developed by an
28:11
83 year old man using a dictaphone to
28:13
record memos for the program because
28:18
hey why didn't he just use his fingers
28:20
to phone
28:27
celebrity video games is a thing so
28:30
kanye west announced in 2016 he was
28:31
working on a video game
28:33
and the aim of the computer game that
28:34
kanye west was launching was that
28:36
you had to escort his deceased mother
28:38
through the gates of heaven
28:39
by holding her up to the light oh my god
28:42
now it's not out yet
28:45
a lot of people claim it's not going to
28:46
happen but um on in september last year
28:50
the the game studio developing it said
28:51
no no we're still working on the kanye
28:53
west deceased mum game
28:54
wow so look out for that there is a new
28:58
app
28:58
um which is available in china and it's
29:02
a game where you
29:03
applaud speeches by chinese president xi
29:05
jinping
29:10
and you have to applaud them as much as
29:12
you can by just mashing your button as
29:14
much as you can
29:15
oh my god and apparently the record for
29:18
button mashing on this game
29:20
is 60 button presses per second
29:24
wow that sounds like a fifa stat doesn't
29:27
it
29:27
[Laughter]
29:29
apparently that's true i guess if you
29:31
use multiple fingers if you can bash 10
29:33
fingers at once yeah and if you think
29:35
you're going to get arrested if you
29:36
don't
29:37
yeah you can achieve great things
29:40
michael jackson released a computer game
29:42
yeah yeah he was involved with about
29:43
eight computer games but in one of them
29:45
michael jackson's moonwalker
29:46
you had to control jackson to save
29:48
kidnapped children from a villain
29:50
um wow
29:54
please and and they played versions of
29:57
his hits in the background
29:58
you normally defeated the villains by
29:59
moonwalking or by doing dance moves
30:01
it was a great game did you play it yeah
30:03
as a kid a lot yeah
30:05
yeah i didn't think of how you just put
30:06
it in context but yeah i
30:08
sort of regret it now um there was
30:12
the great video game crash of the 1980s
30:15
was a huge deal in video game well it
30:16
was 1982 it was when all video games
30:18
went really weird and really crap
30:20
because everyone jumped on board
30:21
made them cheaply there was one in 1982
30:25
that came out which was called communist
30:26
mutants from space
30:28
this was obviously late cold war
30:32
and the way it worked was you were
30:34
fighting against aliens from a communist
30:35
planet which was called
30:36
ruski and
30:40
it was invading the democrat planet
30:43
and the alien's leader was a mother
30:45
creature
30:46
and she'd gone mad from drinking too
30:48
much irradiated vodka
30:51
how do they think of these things
30:54
wow hey we need to move on shortly to
30:57
our next fact you know second life
30:59
yeah life's a big online thing um second
31:01
life has support groups
31:03
it's called things like has second life
31:05
taken over your life
31:06
unfortunately they take place inside
31:09
second life
31:09
oh my god oh wow so you have to be
31:12
playing to take part
31:13
that's so sad i just had a look at a
31:15
couple of um games that vikings might
31:17
play oh cool yeah um
31:18
so one game that they played in the
31:20
longhouse after their meal was called
31:22
hanutu cast
31:24
and their game was you threw bones at
31:26
other players with the intent of causing
31:28
an injury
31:33
and then you use their bones for the
31:35
next game
31:38
gonna throw them pretty hard to actually
31:39
extract another bird
31:41
is that where the phrase throw me a bone
31:43
comes from
31:44
i shouldn't think so no
31:45
[Laughter]
31:48
um okay uh sorry no james you got
31:50
another one oh just that another one is
31:52
they had swimming competitions
31:54
um but the goal of their swimming
31:55
competitions was not who could get their
31:57
quickest
31:57
it was who could hold his opponent
31:59
underwater for the longest
32:00
[Laughter]
32:04
that would be so much more exciting to
32:06
watch
32:07
just as an olympic suggestion
32:11
all right it's time to move on to our
32:13
final fact of the show and that
32:15
is james okay my fact this week is that
32:18
aussie osborne's 1992
32:20
tour was called no more tours
32:24
his 2018 tour is called no mortars
32:27
ii
32:28
[Laughter]
32:31
and has he confirmed how many in the
32:32
series or
32:34
i think he's going to go forever isn't
32:35
he yeah yeah he's going to
32:37
in between he did a retirement sucks
32:39
tour
32:40
wow yeah but the uh no mortals was
32:43
originally no more tears and then he was
32:45
misdiagnosed
32:46
it turned out with uh multiple sclerosis
32:49
uh and then he renamed it no mortars
32:51
and he thought he would never tour again
32:53
but he is out there now
32:55
yeah i love i was looking into tour
32:57
names generally
32:58
um because they are quite fun sometimes
33:00
bands do have some really good ones
33:02
peter gabriel
33:03
um of genesis he used to have a great
33:06
uh one so peter gabriel once had a tour
33:09
which is called china
33:10
1984 tour the interesting thing about
33:13
this is that
33:13
that tour took place in europe in the
33:15
usa
33:17
in 1980
33:20
so it had no relevance whatsoever to
33:22
china 1984.
33:25
he uh he also did playtime 1988 tour
33:27
that took place in 1982.
33:29
um yeah he just thought he thought ah
33:32
doesn't matter
33:33
just any old shitty names gonna work
33:36
yeah
33:36
elton john once said louder than a
33:38
concord but not quite as pretty
33:40
which i think is a really nice name for
33:41
a tour yeah one direction once toured
33:43
under the name take me home
33:44
which doesn't imply that they really
33:45
want to be there in the first place
33:48
some some 41 did a reunion tour and they
33:51
called it don't call it a sum back tour
33:53
very and you were the consultant james
33:56
on that tour weren't you
33:59
elson john first his first retirement
34:01
tour was announced in 1977
34:04
and he is now doing his uh final
34:07
retirement tour i think it's going to
34:08
take him three years to get all the way
34:10
around the world
34:10
yeah but um ozzy osbourne was a bit of a
34:13
rocker wasn't he
34:14
still is i guess although he doesn't
34:16
drink anymore uh and i think one of the
34:18
reasons
34:18
is because according to his
34:19
autobiography he was invited in 1981 to
34:22
a meeting with the head of cbs europe
34:24
and he decided to lighten the mood a bit
34:26
by doing a strip tease on the table
34:29
and then kissing the record executive on
34:31
the lips
34:32
and sharon later on told him that he'd
34:34
actually perform the nazi goose step up
34:37
and down on the table
34:38
before dipping his testicles into the
34:40
executive's wine and then urinating in
34:42
it
34:43
wow
34:46
he really he doesn't disappoint you
34:48
think you're going to look up ozzy
34:49
osbourne and find out he's not actually
34:51
as mad as he seems
34:52
but my lord he it's
34:56
amazing he once and got bored and he
34:58
dragged a shark
34:59
don't know where he got the shark no
35:00
information on that dragged a shark into
35:02
their hotel room a dead shark
35:04
through the hotel room window soaked in
35:06
blood and covered the hotel room in
35:08
shark's blood what
35:09
um he did genuinely bite the head off
35:11
two live doves during a meeting with a
35:13
pr manager
35:15
so he'd meant to let them off at the end
35:17
of the meeting
35:18
but he she said something that really
35:19
irritated him so instead of that
35:21
he took out two of his three live dubs
35:23
and bit the head two of his three
35:24
yeah so now what third one must have
35:27
been absolutely terrifying
35:30
this magic actor has gone very sour
35:35
you know the um the tiny if you've seen
35:37
spinal tap you know they do a thing but
35:38
they have to perform they get the
35:39
dimensions wrong and they perform in
35:41
front of a tiny stone hand which is
35:42
about
35:43
it's about 12 inches highest 10 or 12
35:45
feet high so
35:46
black sabbath went on tour in 1983 they
35:49
had a replica of stonehenge on stage and
35:50
it was so
35:51
massive that it didn't fit on stage none
35:54
of it could fit on stage oh my god so i
35:56
think
35:56
really i think they wanted it in fact
35:57
they got in a meter so i think that's
35:59
where that comes from wow yeah that's so
36:01
cool that must be an odd to that yeah
36:02
i really like that ozzy osbourne
36:04
obviously uh famously so the dove story
36:06
but the famous one is the bat story
36:08
um so his he bit off a bat's head on
36:11
stage and the story goes
36:13
that in fact he didn't know it was a bat
36:15
he thought it was a rubber bat
36:16
that a fan had thrown onto stage picked
36:18
it up bit the head off and then
36:20
realized that it was an actual bat and
36:22
that's that's the big story of ozzy
36:24
osbourne
36:24
um from his from his drunken drug days
36:27
but
36:28
um a few years back in 2010 he was
36:30
trying to convert part of his
36:32
buckinghamshire state
36:34
but he couldn't because it turned out
36:36
that he had bats in the loft
36:37
and there were protected species so
36:39
unless he promised to protect them he
36:40
wasn't able to do anything about it
36:42
wow yeah so they finally got there the
36:45
idea was
36:46
um that like you say that's what
36:48
happened he said that
36:50
sorry about this but he said that as he
36:51
bit it off he felt the head twitch in
36:53
his mouth
36:54
okay but according to the guy who claims
36:57
that he was the one who threw it on
36:58
stage called mark neil
37:00
um he'd found the bat two weeks earlier
37:03
and it was alive
37:04
but by the time he taken to it it was
37:06
long dead
37:07
and so he'd actually put a dead bat in
37:09
his mouth according to that guy
37:10
wow i don't know who to believe i don't
37:12
know which is worse
37:13
no they're both pretty awful they're
37:15
both horrible yeah
37:17
so the drummer was called bill ward
37:20
and tony iaomi one of the other band
37:22
members was a known
37:23
prankster but they particularly loved
37:25
setting the drummer on fire
37:27
so apparently they related a story of
37:28
one show where tony said to bill
37:30
um i'd like to set you on fire now
37:32
please and
37:33
apparently bill said uh i don't really
37:36
want you to not now
37:37
and then at the end of the show he came
37:38
up to tony and said okay well i have to
37:39
go home in a minute so do you want to
37:40
set me on fire or what
37:43
he did he sprayed him with lighter fluid
37:45
covered him in lighter fluid litter
37:47
match
37:47
and he was wearing polyester pants and
37:49
so that he went up extremely fast
37:51
and he was on the floor screaming and
37:52
crying and tony said
37:54
i couldn't help him because i was so
37:56
busy laughing
37:58
it actually turned out to be quite
38:00
serious and i felt very bad for him yeah
38:02
an ambulance was called um and again in
38:04
1980 he got third degree burns because
38:06
they set fire to him again
38:09
he just kept on volunteering for this
38:11
wow well he's actually he's
38:13
he's one of the few people on earth
38:15
who's had his entire dna
38:17
sequenced sorry ozzy osbourne yeah he's
38:20
one of the
38:21
few people that's had his uh dna
38:23
sequence so
38:24
james watson had his um a few others and
38:27
it was done by a scientist who wanted to
38:28
work out how the hell he's still alive
38:30
basically they were like does he have a
38:32
special gene does he have
38:34
uh anything and he he does have a few
38:36
oddities within his body nothing
38:37
nothing major he's got a bit of
38:39
neanderthal in him as well
38:41
um oh but we all do don't we yeah but
38:44
he's probably got
38:44
a bit more than most oh yeah he's up to
38:46
like 70 percent
38:47
[Laughter]
38:49
and now we all have like two or three
38:51
percent don't we but they found that he
38:52
had a little bit more than most
38:54
yeah um but yeah so it's uh he had a few
38:57
bits where that could process alcohol a
38:59
bit more addictively and that's why it
39:00
made him an addict so they did learn a
39:01
lot from
39:02
uh doing it but they said he was 2.6
39:05
times more likely to hallucinate on
39:06
marijuana
39:07
he had an increased risk of cocaine
39:10
addiction he was six times more likely
39:12
than average to be alcohol dependent
39:14
but weirdly the person who conducted the
39:16
test said ozil's wants kryptonite
39:18
is caffeine which is bizarre because
39:20
he's taken every single drug
39:21
under the sun but apparently yeah he's
39:24
extremely slow to metabolize coffee
39:26
so that's if you think he's a bit of a
39:28
mess right now it's just because of the
39:30
coffee thing
39:31
[Laughter]
39:33
massive that's that kind of explains one
39:35
thing i've got here which is that he
39:37
keeps failing driving tests
39:39
uh and one time he fell asleep during
39:42
the test
39:44
that's a major isn't it yeah that's a
39:46
major i think
39:47
due to lack of caffeine maybe i don't
39:48
know um he said when i woke up there was
39:51
a note on the seat saying you have
39:54
failed
39:58
and yet the examiner left him the car
40:00
yeah
40:03
do you want to hear the least rock and
40:04
roll story i've ever heard there was a
40:06
piece of the guardian about the worst
40:07
gigs ever it was very funny and it was
40:09
the jonas brothers
40:10
yeah they they started off as a
40:12
christian rock band i think maybe they
40:13
still are
40:14
but uh joe jonas said we played a
40:16
strawberry festival where they actually
40:18
judged strawberries with taste tests and
40:19
everything it was the most awkward gig
40:21
we've ever done
40:22
there was hardly anyone there and the
40:24
sound cut out halfway through
40:25
we had to perform without any sound
40:27
equipment these poor kids
40:29
they said we didn't get angry and smash
40:31
the place up but we did get asked to
40:33
judge the winning strawberry as
40:34
compensation for the bad sound
40:37
the winning strawberry was fantastic
40:42
i thought they would have deliberately
40:43
given it to a really strawberry
40:45
no lots of raspberries they're nice boys
40:49
so i just wanted to counterbalance them
40:50
you know biting their head off two dubs
40:52
but leaving the third terrified one
40:55
um i've got a good first first-hand
40:57
account from someone we know
40:59
um rock and roll account so freddie
41:02
mercury
41:03
used to have parties and obviously he
41:06
was wild child
41:07
and had parties and he used to invite
41:10
small people or dwarves to the parties
41:13
and put bowls on their heads full of
41:14
cocaine
41:16
so that they could be easily consumed
41:18
which of our friends was at this
41:20
party i don't like to say but this same
41:22
friend did say he also toured with black
41:24
sabbath and because
41:25
the done thing is to throw a tv out the
41:27
window right you've got to throw a tv
41:28
out the window at some point so i think
41:30
actually one member of black sabbath was
41:31
on the way to the airport once and
41:33
stopped the driver and said
41:34
god turn around i've forgotten something
41:36
and got driven back
41:37
ran upstairs brought the tv downstairs
41:40
and threw it in the swimming pool the
41:41
hotel then got back in the cab and said
41:42
okay thank god right we better go to the
41:44
airport
41:46
but this guy that we know did also tour
41:49
black sabbath and decide he had to throw
41:50
a tv out of the hotel window but forgot
41:52
to unplug it so apparently ended up with
41:54
the tv just dangling precariously
41:57
from the 20th floor of a hotel do you
42:00
know what one of the main rules that a
42:01
rolling stones
42:02
gig is these days for the band um
42:06
i don't know you're not allowed to touch
42:07
keith richards shepherd's pie
42:10
and is that a euphemism for something no
42:13
not no he's
42:14
completely clean these days and um
42:17
he has a shepherd's pie before every gig
42:18
and in 1989 in toronto
42:20
he found that someone had tried it
42:22
before him and he refused to go on stage
42:24
until a new shepherd's pie was made and
42:26
brought to him
42:27
he said nobody touches the shepherd's
42:29
ponytail i've been in there don't bust
42:30
my crust baby
42:36
didn't say that you said it the man's a
42:38
great lyricist
42:39
that's amazing we're gonna have to wrap
42:41
up shortly
42:42
anything before we do oh just quickly
42:45
i've got one which is that um
42:47
just on tours recent tours beyonce had a
42:49
thing a few years ago where
42:51
uh she's in
42:51
[Laughter]
42:55
no she um she had this whole thing where
42:57
um she she really enraged a lot of
42:59
people
43:00

00:23
a weekly podcast this week coming to you
00:26
live
00:26
from the sydney opera house
00:34
my name is dan schreiber and i am
00:37
sitting here with anna chazinski andrew
00:40
hunter murray and james harkin
00:41
and once again we have gathered around
00:43
the microphones with our four
00:45
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:47
and in no particular order
00:49
here we go starting with you
00:52
andy my fact is that the bbc has sound
00:55
effects including
00:56
indisposed chicken more or less normal
00:59
chicken
01:01
standard orgy and comedy orgy
01:06
[Laughter]
01:10
now it would be very remiss if we want
01:13
to
01:14
play for you some of these tonight have
01:17
you got the clips
01:18
i've got clips all right so uh yeah
01:20
they've got a sound-off archive of
01:22
sixteen thousand effects and
01:23
so here here's indisposed chicken
01:32
[Applause]
01:36
how often are the bbc playing out
01:38
sitcoms where enter
01:39
indisposed chicken and indisposed to do
01:43
what
01:44
it's just i don't know it's sounding
01:46
pretty distressed though
01:47
yeah so there's also no we've got
01:50
standard orgy here just as a baseline
01:56
[Music]
01:57
i think i can hear a few chickens in
01:59
there
02:01
[Music]
02:04
yeah there's definitely a involved
02:06
somewhere
02:09
terrible and here because i know we all
02:10
want to hear it is comedy audrey
02:23
[Music]
02:27
the bbc ladies and gentlemen
02:30
it's and the amazing thing is they
02:32
they've made this open to the public
02:34
this whole archive 16 000 effects and
02:35
you can download them and
02:37
for non-commercial reasons you can use
02:38
them uh and they're they're
02:40
it's a fantastic archive it's got such
02:42
funny stuff just on those audrey clips
02:44
the the legend of the at the bbc is that
02:47
they were recorded by a studio manager
02:48
in the 1970s
02:50
who sounds about right now in gbc
02:55
um and though it was colleagues during
02:56
their lunch breaks he'd say come on
02:57
you're coming to make some some audrey
02:59
sounds during your lunch break
03:00
is that right supposedly so yeah god
03:03
lunch breaks are more fun in the olden
03:04
days
03:08
yeah it's very cool though so these are
03:10
all now free free to use
03:12
for anyone right hence the reason we're
03:13
allowed to do that right here right now
03:15
i think you asked that special
03:17
permission i did ask for a special
03:18
question yeah
03:19
um in case we you know we had wanted to
03:21
use thirsty budgerigars in shed
03:24
or two siamese cats one coughing
03:30
occasionally
03:34
and if you want if you want to play a
03:35
fight sound effect they've got three
03:37
people brawling they've got six people
03:38
brawling and if those aren't enough you
03:40
can do 36 people brawling
03:43
wow yeah i spent a long time reading
03:44
this list they have um
03:46
riot in belfast don't they right in
03:48
belfast with breaking glass rubber
03:50
bullets distant cries and challenge
03:52
and then they also have riot in belfast
03:54
more subdued
04:00
we're going to go for another take on
04:01
the riot guys could you just keep it
04:03
down a bit this time please
04:06
they're so specific though they've like
04:08
so they've got
04:09
belgian post office brackets busy i
04:12
think
04:12
which is if you want a french post
04:15
office brackets busy do you think that's
04:17
a disaster
04:18
are you like they've only got the
04:19
belgian one there's nothing we can do
04:20
well some it's
04:21
it's a really weird mix of things that
04:23
were recorded especially like for
04:24
example comedy orgy or
04:26
things that are recording history so
04:27
they've got an air raid uh on battersea
04:29
from 1940 during the battle of britain
04:31
that obviously is not going to happen
04:33
again so yeah it's not going to have a
04:34
comedy air raid on batman
04:45
um it's amazing isn't it when you look
04:46
into the the stories behind
04:49
where sounds come from as you said they
04:50
were lunch break and they would come and
04:52
do a comedy orgy
04:53
um the so there's that famous one i
04:56
think it's quite famous that
04:57
in jurassic park the sound of the
05:00
velociraptors barking that sort of was
05:04
um
05:04
turtles having sex that's uh i don't
05:07
know if you know that but you can see
05:08
footage and there's a lot of it online
05:10
of turtles having sex which i highly
05:12
recommend
05:13
and and as they're as they're going at
05:16
it they're sort of
05:18
there's this like kind of kind of noise
05:22
and that's genuinely what they sampled
05:24
for the how did that turtle get on stage
05:27
where is it
05:29
it's a bit i didn't even do it right
05:30
it's so it's such a lovely tone
05:32
um but i think you're going to be in the
05:34
mood you know and
05:36
um but so the t-rex is in jurassic park
05:39
when you see a t-rex it's a mixture of a
05:41
bunch of different animal sounds
05:42
so um the voice itself for the breathing
05:45
they use the sound of a whale
05:47
um they use lions alligators and tigers
05:49
for the low frequency of the roaring
05:51
that was going
05:52
on um but for the heavy breathing the
05:54
sort of
05:55
of the t-rex that's a koala no
05:59
an aussie yeah made it into jurassic
06:03
park
06:04
an aussie legend this was so weird today
06:07
by the way
06:08
so i was thinking about this fact and
06:10
the fact i needed to do some research
06:11
for it on the walk to the sydney opera
06:13
house and i
06:14
wore and i was thinking about foley
06:17
artists so this is obviously about um
06:20
foley artists and it's jack foley the
06:22
guy who kind of invented
06:23
sound effects and made a lot of the
06:25
sound effects from our films and i
06:26
walked
06:27
past a street called foley street as i
06:29
was thinking about foley artists
06:30
isn't that insane that's just that's
06:32
just a personal story but
06:37
and what a story yeah that was such a
06:40
i didn't do my homework but whoa do i
06:42
have an excuse
06:44
i was doing some reading on foley no he
06:47
used
06:48
to uh so he is the sound of the walk of
06:50
a lot of your favorite actors
06:53
if you're born in the 1940s actually but
06:55
um so
06:57
he's the sound of the walks of lawrence
06:59
olivier of james cagney of marlon brando
07:02
because he used to watch these people
07:04
walk because you couldn't get the sounds
07:06
recorded sort of live because the
07:07
cameras weren't recording that
07:09
close up and he would watch them really
07:11
carefully and imitate their walks
07:12
and then the sound of his feet hitting
07:14
the ground were that
07:16
and they still do that today in nature
07:18
documentaries a lot
07:20
so actually while i was on this walk i
07:21
was listening to an episode of 99
07:24
invisible podcast and very good show
07:27
and uh there was a guy interviewed
07:29
richard hinton who does the sound
07:31
effects for animals in a lot of nature
07:32
documentaries
07:33
and he says for walking animals you
07:35
always use your hands
07:37
because you have much more control over
07:38
your hands and so
07:40
if you're a lion then you sort of do it
07:42
quite lightly and then if you're in
07:44
elephant
07:44
isn't it yeah what if you're a turtle
07:45
having sex um
07:47
yeah still in the hands speaking of
07:49
walking um awesome wells he wanted a
07:51
specific sound of people walking on sand
07:54
so he had an entire truckload of sand
07:56
dumped onto the studio floor
07:58
for people to walk on unfortunately it
08:00
just dampened it you couldn't hear
08:01
anything
08:02
and they used to get amazing things that
08:04
they were asked so they were asked to do
08:05
the sounds of snowflakes falling on snow
08:08
or the sound of a nude woman sitting on
08:10
a marble bench
08:13
was that necessary it's all in the hands
08:19
um this is amazing um bacon sizzling in
08:22
a pan
08:23
sounds identical to rain falling
08:26
no you don't think it does but i did a
08:28
video on the internet and i was tricked
08:29
two times out of four
08:30
which is exactly no better than average
08:35
it's incredible you think you know and
08:37
you don't really
08:42
i mean we're full of anecdotes tonight
08:43
aren't we
08:45
um do you know the the um the bowl the
08:47
big boulder in indiana jones yeah that
08:49
rolls after india at the beginning of
08:50
the first film
08:51
the noise of that is a honda civic set
08:53
in neutral going down a gravel road on a
08:56
very slight slope
09:00
but it works it's amazing how euros can
09:02
be tracked in a fight club all of the
09:04
punches
09:04
are the smacking of slabs of meat with
09:07
pig's feet
09:09
but david fincher thought that this
09:10
sounded exactly right but he was another
09:12
one who
09:12
took it really seriously in fact in one
09:14
of the things in fight club he asked a
09:16
stuntman to fall down the stairs 12
09:18
times for one scene
09:19
and then he used the first take
09:26
did he know after the first take that he
09:28
was using the first take and the other
09:29
11 would just be paid for an hour
09:35
we're gonna have to move on fairly
09:36
soon-ish to the next fact oh all my
09:37
research is about orgies
09:39
[Laughter]
09:47
okay on the wikipedia for algie's they
09:49
have a section on roman orgies
09:50
and apparently this did happen it was an
09:52
ecstatic form of worship that some cults
09:54
had
09:55
sounds alright actually i involved
09:57
drinking wine
09:58
it doesn't seem to be much sex involved
10:00
in fairness it was involved drinking
10:01
wine and dancing
10:02
oh it sounds okay as well as eating raw
10:05
meat
10:06
which is not quite as good and
10:07
self-castration which is much less good
10:11
of course the self-castration does
10:12
provide fodder for the raw meat so it's
10:15
one stone isn't it
10:19
[Applause]
10:24
okay it is time for fact number two and
10:26
that
10:27
is chozinski my fact this week is that
10:30
in the first olympic marathon in 1896
10:34
the same stopwatch was used at the start
10:36
and finish line
10:37
so had to be carried from one to the
10:38
other ahead of the runners by bicycle
10:42
that's very cool uh this is so this is
10:45
the
10:46
first modern olympics obviously in
10:47
greece and
10:49
yeah the it was held by uh judge the
10:51
stopwatch it was started by this judge
10:53
who clicked it shoved it in the hand of
10:54
a bicycle and the cyclist had to
10:56
ride along in foul weather it was really
10:59
awful weather that day
11:00
and the road was very rough and then
11:02
cycle really fast to the finish line
11:04
so that the same stopwatch could be
11:05
there also presumably cycle without
11:07
accidentally pressing any of the buttons
11:08
on the stopwatch
11:09
enjoying the process of cycling but you
11:12
could just you could just have given it
11:13
to the guy in front
11:15
and said if anyone overtakes you i'll
11:18
chuck it over yeah yeah
11:20
like kind of a relay yeah
11:23
that's a great idea i was thinking you
11:25
could do it by car but then
11:27
obviously not back then and actually
11:28
probably not now certainly at the london
11:30
marathon
11:31
because the average speed in central
11:33
london at the moment for cars is 7.6
11:35
miles an hour
11:36
whereas the average speed for runners in
11:38
the marathon is 12 miles an hour
11:41
in fairness the london marathon is on a
11:43
sunday
11:44
so the traffic won't be so bad that's
11:46
true but bad news uh they close all the
11:48
roads because the marathon's on
11:49
oh yeah oh yeah yeah
11:53
this was this was obvious this is the
11:55
first modern olympics it was very
11:56
exciting this marathon was emulating the
11:59
great marathon
12:00
of uh of history that they they wanted
12:02
to do um
12:03
what was it history of history
12:06
you could at least narrow it down to the
12:08
country
12:11
not australia
12:15
uh so but what was very exciting about
12:17
it i think particularly for the room
12:19
that we're in
12:19
is that entering that olympics that year
12:22
there was an australian team
12:24
and it was the very first olympics yeah
12:26
consisted of one person
12:29
he was a guy called edwin flack and he
12:32
actually ran
12:33
in this marathon was was quite far at
12:36
the front at one point but then
12:38
he unfortunately had never run that far
12:40
before and gone
12:42
so while he was doing really well he
12:44
suddenly got really delirious
12:45
collapsed down and one of the spectators
12:48
came up to help him
12:49
got him up and then edwin flack punched
12:51
him
12:53
[Applause]
12:55
yeah the first yeah punching of a
12:58
spectator by an aussie
13:00
or any country do you know he was sorry
13:03
just on edwin flack
13:04
um he was one of i think there were 17
13:08
people running
13:08
and 13 were greek and so he was one of
13:11
the remainder that were foreigners
13:12
and none of them knew how to long
13:13
distance run and so they all started out
13:16
ahead
13:17
and all the greeks had lots of practice
13:18
and so they all started out behind and
13:20
they all thought they were winning and
13:21
when flax started winning i think he
13:22
overtook a french guy
13:24
and again the cyclist was crucial
13:26
because a cyclist cycled to the finish
13:27
line to the big stadium and said
13:29
the aussie's winning the aussies winning
13:31
and then they were all devastated
13:33
because they were all greeks
13:34
and that's what they thought because
13:35
there was no way of relaying this
13:37
information except to have a bloody
13:38
cyclist there
13:39
who'd already peddled the stopwatch up
13:41
to the front line
13:42
um so yeah they really thought he was
13:44
going to win the guy who it was
13:45
eventually won by a greek
13:47
and um so the main medical check for
13:49
this race was being tapped on the knee
13:50
by a doctor
13:51
and then given two beers that's it
13:55
um so everyone was a couple of beers in
13:57
by the time they started
13:58
then so the guy who eventually this
14:00
explains why the australian did so well
14:04
the guy who eventually went halfway
14:06
through uh he bumped into his stepfather
14:08
who was waiting along the route at a
14:09
little
14:09
uh in who gave him some wine and then he
14:12
was
14:12
he was getting really tired this guy and
14:15
he asked someone who was accompanying
14:16
him for water so please have you got any
14:18
water so he was given cognac
14:20
instead so he finished the race
14:22
completely half cut he was
14:25
i think he spat out the cognac in
14:28
disgust
14:30
so the next olympics which was in 1900
14:32
the
14:33
course markings were so poor in the
14:35
marathon that confused athletes could be
14:36
seen running randomly through the
14:38
streets of central parish
14:44
and the absolute worst thing about it
14:45
for me um is that the winner was a guy
14:48
called michelle teatro of france
14:50
but in second place was a guy called
14:52
emil champion
14:54
and in third place was ernst fast
14:58
[Music]
15:00
wow so sad that's a very sad yeah
15:03
it was really teatro's responsibility to
15:05
give that game away wasn't it
15:07
i mean at least change his name yeah
15:10
to winner or something well in 1904 the
15:13
the marathon competitor who finished
15:14
ninth he should have done better but he
15:16
was chased a mile off course by dogs
15:22
was that 1904 yeah okay in that same
15:25
race there was a cuban postman
15:26
um called anderin carvajal uh and he
15:30
arrived at the last minute and he'd lost
15:32
all of his money in new orleans so he
15:34
had to hitchhike to
15:35
saint louis and he'd hardly eaten
15:37
anything so he stopped off at an orchard
15:39
on route to have a snack on some apples
15:41
which turned out to be rotten and so
15:44
despite having strong stomach cramps
15:46
throughout the whole of the race he
15:47
ended up finishing fourth
15:48
wow wow unlike this there was this is
15:51
many years later there was a marathon
15:53
runner called
15:54
kanakuri who um he started the marathon
15:57
and then he went missing and no one ever
16:00
saw him again
16:01
and yeah they just lost he was so fast
16:06
yeah he was missing um he was missing
16:08
and then it turned out that what
16:10
happened is
16:10
is that he lost consciousness and he was
16:12
rescued by a family on the side of the
16:14
track they brought him back to a house
16:15
he regained consciousness later and was
16:17
nursed to health but was so embarrassed
16:19
about it he didn't tell anyone
16:21
and so he was listed as missing by
16:23
swedish authorities for over 50 years
16:28
before he finally admitted that that's
16:29
what happened that he had
16:31
he should have just sneaked back into
16:33
the end of one of the
16:34
marathons they were doing well well he
16:37
did you're not going to tell me he did
16:38
that he went back on the 55th
16:40
anniversary of the 1912 games to finish
16:42
the race
16:43
and um he holds the longest ever
16:45
official marathon time of 54 years eight
16:48
months
16:48
six days five hours 32 minutes and 20.3
16:51
seconds
16:55
i i've got a fact about a marathon which
16:57
i don't know if you guys have heard of
16:59
oh yeah this is called the barkley
17:00
marathon this is the this is the
17:02
toughest marathon
17:04
have you guys done it has anyone
17:05
competed
17:07
no no exactly exactly
17:12
you think you're tough enough oh my
17:15
goodness guys okay get this
17:17
it's in tennessee you have to do five
17:20
20 mile loops all over a mountain okay
17:23
and
17:23
and you have to finish within 60 hours
17:26
so that's 100 it's
17:27
very hard you have to do the equivalent
17:28
of running up and down mount everest
17:30
twice it only costs 1.60 to enter
17:35
thousands of people have entered since
17:36
it was started
17:40
i'm sorry and a t-shirt what's up
17:46
[Applause]
17:52
if i do it
18:03
but you're right you know you're right
18:04
you're right you're right the guy who
18:05
set it up he
18:06
he requests that you bring him t-shirts
18:08
uh because he doesn't like shopping for
18:09
clothes
18:10
so it might be socks or t-shirts
18:12
whatever um
18:14
you have to get in to get in you have to
18:15
email a secret email address on the
18:17
right minute at the right day
18:19
with an essay titled why i should be
18:21
allowed to run in the barclay
18:22
there's no path so they leave 13 books
18:25
trailed around the course and as you go
18:26
around you have to take a page from each
18:28
book
18:28
to finish each loop you have to sign a
18:30
disclaimer saying if i'm stupid enough
18:32
to attempt the barclay
18:33
i deserve to be held responsible for any
18:35
result of that attempt
18:36
be it financial physical mental or
18:39
anything else
18:40
it's not you don't get a medal by the
18:42
way if you finish
18:44
it's horrific you get a t-shirt you get
18:47
nothing
18:48
it started in 1986. nobody finished it
18:50
until 1995.
18:52
wow and so the i'm just back on timers
18:55
um
18:56
the in the 2012 olympics in london um
18:58
they invented
18:59
a timer which can measure accuracy to a
19:02
millionth of a second
19:04
but no one really figured out what to do
19:06
with it
19:08
because obviously that is such a small
19:10
amount of time in that amount of time
19:12
usain bolt can travel
19:15
0.001 meters which is about the size of
19:18
a bacteria
19:21
yeah this is so most more accurate
19:23
timing devices are useless at olympics
19:25
and this is a serious problem
19:27
people people keep having ties because
19:29
you only measure them to 100th of a
19:31
second
19:31
and after that it's kind of unfair so i
19:34
think they've been a lot of ties
19:35
in the swimming uh since 1984 because
19:39
in 1972 there was a tie when they
19:41
measured it to hundreds of a second
19:42
so they went to thousands and one guy
19:45
beat the other by two
19:46
thousandths of a second which is much
19:49
much faster than the blink of an eye
19:51
and the thickness of coat on the
19:52
swimming pool could easily
19:54
massively override that by a long long
19:56
way and so they realized it was
19:57
completely unfair
19:58
so they just have loads of ties these
20:00
days in 2012 there was one where it went
20:02
down to a coin toss
20:03
or a runoff wow and then one of them
20:05
just seems in the swimming pool
20:09
how was the sprinting race just gonna
20:10
have to wait for this to freeze
20:16
could you let your fingernails grow
20:17
enough until you would win that race
20:19
yeah that's really good i think if your
20:21
fingers were 50 meters long
20:24
you could just go
20:27
i'd bet you'd have bigger problems
20:29
wouldn't you
20:34
okay it is time for fact number three
20:37
and that is james okay my fact this week
20:41
is that in first century denmark if you
20:44
are really rich
20:45
you are buried with a chicken
20:48
if you were really really rich you were
20:51
buried with a goose
20:53
wow so this is a thing that happened um
20:56
basically it was the romans had started
20:58
to get up to there in scandinavia
21:00
and gooses were extremely rare i think
21:03
we said geese
21:03
just fyi
21:07
[Applause]
21:13
and i'm the editor of this podcast
21:17
and geese were really rare
21:23
and also geese they represented the
21:25
goddess juno
21:26
and they found that not only have these
21:29
um people who are buried with chicken
21:30
and geese
21:31
they're obviously um kind of of high
21:34
status because they have loads of other
21:35
roman goods as well
21:36
um so yeah that's the thing that
21:38
happened that's very cool just wondering
21:40
what
21:41
you said that some people were buried
21:42
with a chicken do you have any idea what
21:43
it might sound like if the
21:46
if the chicken was say indisposed before
21:48
uh
21:50
i have a feeling with glue
22:04
oh yeah there are there are ancient
22:07
peruvian
22:08
shark fisherman graves which have been
22:10
excavated recently and it turns out that
22:12
they were buried with
22:13
extra legs what sorry
22:16
so are we sure that they just didn't
22:19
have extra legs
22:21
i suppose we're not 100 sure
22:24
um they had extra legs buried with them
22:26
so that two extra legs were left in
22:28
in one grave i'm pretty sure this guy
22:30
has anyone
22:31
guessed why that might have been the
22:32
case or whose legs they were
22:34
i think they were the legs of i suppose
22:36
other peruvian shark fishermen
22:38
who hadn't had quite as long and happy a
22:39
career
22:42
as the as the main guys in the grave
22:44
there are a lot of legless torsos buried
22:46
nearby i don't think we've found any yet
22:48
okay again this is research in its early
22:50
stages so
22:54
yeah i really like that um in america um
22:58
the with the incidences of corpses being
23:01
stolen for scientific purposes from
23:02
graveyards
23:03
um by during the u.s civil war times uh
23:06
by quite a lot
23:07
so someone invented a coffin torpedo
23:10
and yeah so the coffin torpedo was
23:14
if you were digging a grave it would it
23:16
would lob it would
23:17
blow up basically uh from the inside of
23:19
the coffin
23:20
when you were trying to steal the body
23:21
and kill the person who's trying to
23:23
steal you
23:24
or steal the person yeah and then there
23:26
was one that was put on top of the
23:27
coffin as well so it didn't harm the
23:29
actual interior of the coffin
23:31
as well and that was a big thing they
23:32
used to do things like put cages on top
23:34
of
23:34
um graves to make sure that no one could
23:36
steal there was also
23:38
and this is sounds really weird to me um
23:40
the graveyards
23:41
used to at one point have at the bottom
23:44
of the
23:44
of the so you have the tombstone and
23:46
then right at the bottom there would be
23:47
a shotgun
23:48
just pointed up and if anyone came
23:52
and you might just be visiting so i
23:53
don't know how
23:55
how it worked but you'd be killed and
23:59
wow yeah yeah that is hard she might
24:01
just want to say one last goodbye
24:03
yeah although if it's a family grave
24:04
just plop them in i guess
24:08
this is so that would go down extremely
24:10
badly in madagascar
24:12
where they have a tradition of
24:14
disinterring the dead every few years
24:17
so this is this i think really cool
24:19
malagasy
24:20
tradition it's uh in the famadihana
24:24
people and it's called the turning of
24:26
bones it happens every five to seven
24:27
years
24:28
and you go to where your ancestors are
24:29
buried or where your grandma's buried
24:31
and you dig them up in order that you
24:32
can change their clothes because they've
24:33
been wearing the same clothes for
24:35
ages and you then walk them around the
24:38
village so look at the tour of the
24:39
village
24:40
shows between your shoulders pretending
24:43
they're still fine
24:43
yeah that's exactly what you do you you
24:45
walk around you go oh look there's a
24:47
co-op there didn't used to be there
24:48
that kind of thing um
24:52
you won't remember that you they dance
24:54
with them
24:55
so they dance around the graveyard
24:56
within the cemetery they hold the bodies
24:58
above their heads and they spray them
24:59
with perfume and they bathe them in wine
25:01
and they often rearrange the bodies into
25:04
more human shapes
25:05
when sometimes time has taken its toll
25:07
and they just have it's a really fun
25:10
banquet really with the dead if you're
25:13
into that kind of thing
25:15
[Laughter]
25:16
so in china it is illegal to be buried
25:18
with a picture of a super girl
25:21
um a super supergirl i will come to that
25:24
thank you
25:26
so i think it's i think people mostly
25:29
probably know that in china they do the
25:31
same word they have like paper offerings
25:33
so they might put bits of um fake money
25:35
in your tomb or whatever
25:37
and it's like things that you loved in
25:39
life or whatever i mean that would be so
25:41
annoying in the afterlife if you got to
25:42
the
25:43
counter and you wanted to buy all your
25:45
stuff for the afterlife and they were
25:46
like
25:46
this is all fake sir yeah but this is
25:49
all counterfeit
25:50
if you're a fan of playing monopoly in
25:52
the afterlife that stuff will be very
25:53
handy
25:55
you can't bring your own fake money to a
25:57
monopoly board
25:59
oh i've got a new currency i'd just like
26:01
to pop in
26:03
that's rules mate i want a lot of games
26:05
with that extra stack
26:07
the murray millions i'll take everything
26:12
so as well as um they do have this kind
26:14
of money but they banned
26:15
and the practice of vulgar offerings so
26:17
that's such things as luxury villas
26:19
sedan
26:20
cars viagra you're not allowed to and
26:23
then simulated models of super girls
26:26
and that is based on the hit tv contest
26:29
mongolian cow
26:30
yogurt supergirl please don't give away
26:34
the ending of the latest series because
26:35
i'm only halfway through
26:38
i've actually heard of supergirl now
26:39
that i think about it that was the tv
26:40
show it's kind of like x factor where
26:42
it's all about singing yeah and i think
26:44
they said this is
26:45
this is what i read in a newspaper but
26:47
i've not double checked uh to verify it
26:49
um this and it was it was a big british
26:50
tabloid um it said that
26:52
um in china so many people voted for the
26:56
winner
26:56
of the first series of supergirl that if
26:59
you took
27:00
all those votes and applied it to every
27:01
other voting that has happened on planet
27:03
earth it is the biggest collection of
27:05
single votes for one thing that the
27:07
earth has ever witnessed
27:08
wow more than any election more than
27:10
anything else because they don't really
27:12
have elections there um
27:13
they dan how dare you
27:16
the elections in china are free and fair
27:19
and extremely
27:21
concentrated on a single result and um
27:24
sorry just on china quickly as well um
27:26
not so much
27:27
burials but funerals uh just very
27:29
recently the chinese ministry of culture
27:31
have announced that they're planning to
27:32
eliminate strippers
27:34
from going to funerals and this is a
27:36
custom that happens in china and taiwan
27:39
whereby they'd like to make it a big
27:40
party and and again go online you can
27:43
see this there's
27:43
um and dignitaries will have this it
27:45
will be
27:46
girls on the top of cars pole dancing
27:50
and stripping it's a big thing in some
27:51
cases there will be
27:52
50 car processions all of which will
27:54
have a pole dancing
27:56
um stripper on top of it yeah and
27:58
they're trying to
27:59
get that out although you should specify
28:01
that strippers aren't not allowed to go
28:03
to funerals it's not like if your job
28:04
happens to be a stripper
28:06
but your mum dies you're not allowed to
28:08
attend their funeral yeah
28:09
you're just not supposed to strip acid
28:11
you just can't take your clothes off
28:12
yeah
28:13
yeah but that's that's the thing that
28:16
genuinely happens and that's the
28:17
purpose of it it's just a celebration
28:19
thing and i think they tied it in with
28:20
um with the fake money where you put it
28:23
[Laughter]
28:28
in
28:31
i was looking at animals being buried um
28:34
because pets being buried is more and
28:35
more of a talked about and written about
28:37
thing and pets cemeteries and stuff
28:39
and people really want to be buried with
28:40
their pets now and there are actually a
28:42
couple of really bizarre cases
28:44
where people who are dying request that
28:46
their pets be put down
28:47
so that they can be buried together yeah
28:50
yeah
28:50
an american and his yorkshire terrier um
28:54
look it up so
28:57
it's very weird but there's this debate
28:59
in the u.s so in new york for instance
29:01
you are now allowed to bury animal
29:03
remains in human cemeteries with the
29:04
human
29:05
but only if they're buried at the same
29:07
time so
29:08
you're not allowed to sort of re just
29:09
have a pet funeral
29:11
um but yeah there's it's
29:14
it's a big deal that's amazing because i
29:16
remember reading somewhere ages ago that
29:18
their first pet cemeteries were open in
29:20
paris i think at the turn of the century
29:22
because they explicitly made it illegal
29:24
to throw dead animals into the river
29:26
and so they were like well now we need
29:28
something else to do with them when will
29:29
the cult of health and safety
29:31
let go of poor innocent parisians
29:35
well frederick the great of prussia
29:37
wanted to be buried with his dogs
29:38
because he was obsessed with them
29:40
and um the court said you should be
29:42
buried next to your wife and father
29:44
in the royal cemetery and so he was they
29:47
disobeyed his wishes that was in 17
29:49
in the 1780s and in the 1990s
29:54
uh they respected his wishes and buried
29:56
him with his greyhounds instead
29:58
so that's quite happy i'm sure that yeah
30:03
you know um bella lugosi who played
30:05
dracula yeah
30:06
he was buried in his dracula cape cool
30:09
yeah
30:10
which would be a hell of a shock
30:11
wouldn't it if you were
30:13
digging him up you know
30:16
but there was a report in 1930 a few
30:20
years before he died saying he hopes to
30:21
escape
30:22
the shackles of the role and clearly he
30:24
did not it's quite sad actually
30:26
yeah that's bad that sounds like it was
30:29
an argument with his wife
30:30
he also he had a guest book at his
30:32
funeral which i rather like i think
30:33
that's a cool thing to have
30:34
yeah okay i found a really odd thing
30:37
which is
30:38
um king richard iii is buried
30:41
in a casket that was made by his great
30:44
great great great great great
30:46
great grand nephew
30:50
yeah great
30:54
so he was he was found i should add i
30:56
wasn't sure how many greats it was so i
30:58
kept going and you can edit in the
30:59
relevant amount
31:07
i'm gonna put so many in
31:12
and you're just gonna sound like you're
31:13
having a stroke
31:19
wow the podcast is two and a half hours
31:21
long this week how about all that could
31:23
be
31:25
is that so how did that occur is that
31:27
someone enough grace to get to the
31:28
present day and this is when he was
31:29
reburied
31:30
he was remember he was king richard iii
31:32
was found underneath the car park in
31:33
fact it was in our very first episode
31:35
one of the headline facts that we uh
31:37
that we mentioned and they had to prove
31:40
who he was using the dna via a living
31:43
relative and there was one guy called
31:45
michael ibsen
31:46
who they were able to track it down i've
31:48
met him really nice guy um
31:50
he was he was they used his dna they
31:52
proved it
31:53
and he happened to be a carpenter and so
31:55
he said can i make the coffin that he's
31:57
going to be rebuilding
31:58
that's really nice yeah yeah although of
32:01
course
32:01
um after a certain distance we are
32:03
genuinely all related to
32:05
certain people so it's about at the uh
32:07
genghis khan
32:09
level we are all directly descended from
32:10
them and he's not far from that
32:12
so it's not very we're probably all his
32:14
great great guru right so are you
32:15
telling me i'm genghis khan's great
32:17
great great great great great great
32:19
great great great great question
32:22
and then you can use the rest
32:26
in case i didn't do enough early i've
32:29
got a i've got a riddle for you guys
32:30
okay my mother abandoned me oh i'm sorry
32:35
that's the beginning
32:40
it's strange time to bring it up
32:43
mum if you're listening and i know you
32:45
don't
32:48
i don't feel abandoned by you
32:51
[Laughter]
32:55
here's the riddle my mother abandoned me
32:58
i was found by a man who cut off my head
33:00
scooped out my heart
33:01
and gave me something to drink then i
33:03
began speaking
33:05
what am i okay
33:08
so anyone it's going to be something to
33:10
do with
33:11
burials something to do with the main
33:12
fact actually maybe not just burials
33:14
are you a goose are you a chicken i'm a
33:16
goose are you from denmark i've got a
33:17
bit of a goose
33:19
are you foie gras i'm not foreign
33:24
my mother abandoned me i was found by a
33:26
man who cut off my head
33:28
scooped out my heart and gave me
33:29
something to drink then i began speaking
33:31
it's very clever i'm not i'm not
33:34
surprised your mum doesn't speak to you
33:36
anymore
33:38
don't invite him over for christmas
33:40
honey he's gonna do his riddles
33:41
again it's gonna be
33:44
i think we found the answer tonight to
33:45
the question of why did riddles go out
33:47
in the 16th century
33:50
why didn't his mother abandon it because
33:52
the mother is the goose that
33:54
gave it up when the the man plucked the
33:56
feather out
33:58
right okay it's the feather not the
34:00
goose yeah it's the quill pen
34:02
yeah sorry
34:06
still room for a few hundred more grates
34:08
where that bit was um
34:21
we need to move on very shortly i've got
34:23
i've got one last thing actually which i
34:24
quite like
34:25
um there is a company should you cause
34:27
uh when you're buried
34:28
you you can decide either you go in a
34:30
coffin or you have many other options
34:31
cremation and so on
34:32
there's a company that actually will
34:34
take the ashes
34:36
of someone and they will grind them and
34:38
heat them down
34:39
to a sort of diamond which they then put
34:41
in a ring
34:42
so that is an option that you can get
34:44
and their tagline
34:45
is diamonds and grandma are forever
34:52
so if you want that that's i mean i
34:54
guess if you're proposing to someone you
34:55
could say
34:56
my granny would have wanted you to have
34:58
this ring
35:00
it was her it
35:03
[Laughter]
35:10
okay we need to move on to our final
35:12
fact of the show and that is my fact
35:15
my fact this week is that before
35:17
magician
35:18
pt selbert invented the famous sawing a
35:21
woman in half
35:22
illusion his big trick was called the
35:25
mighty cheese
35:27
which saw him daring members of the
35:30
audience onto the stage to try and push
35:32
over
35:32
his massive block of cheese
35:37
that was this is the guy who became a
35:39
legend that was his initial trick
35:41
that's a good trick yeah he so what it
35:43
was is he would walk on stage and he
35:45
would have a giant wheel of cheese
35:47
and uh and it was and it was red and it
35:50
was covered in wax so it's like a big
35:52
baby bell basically that he had
35:54
and he would say who would dare come
35:56
onto stage and push over
35:58
my cheese who has the might and it was a
36:00
great illusion because inside this big
36:02
block of cheese this big wheel of cheese
36:04
um there was a sort of gyroscope thing
36:06
so it made it impossible
36:07
uh to actually do it so i guess like all
36:10
magic it was yeah every time you tried
36:11
to push it or pull it it would kind of
36:13
jerk off in another direction and throw
36:14
you to the ground
36:15
yes and he had a couple of um stooges
36:18
who would kind of deliberately fall over
36:20
and whatever and he would always find
36:21
the strongest looking people in the
36:23
audience
36:23
and then try and make fun of them about
36:25
how weak they were and then get them to
36:27
try and do it and they'd be thrown
36:28
everywhere
36:29
yeah it sounds awesome to me sounds good
36:31
like the cutting the lady in half is
36:33
fine but we've seen that a million times
36:36
but apparently it was not at all awesome
36:38
it no one liked it
36:40
it was he and he sold it to people and
36:42
they kept reporting back going i've lost
36:44
all my audiences
36:45
i don't know why i thought pushing over
36:47
cheese would be interesting but
36:49
did we say who this guy was pt selma
36:52
he was born percy thomas tibbles
36:56
um but he took the name celbit by
36:58
reversing his surname and subtracting
37:00
one of the bees
37:01
that was quite cool you know when penn
37:03
teller they the
37:04
famous modern now magicians they tried
37:06
the same trick uh
37:08
they did a version of it on stage and
37:09
they got a mixed martial arts fighter
37:11
to try and wrestle the cheese and
37:13
because it is a trick cheese
37:14
he failed conor mcgregor is getting
37:16
desperate these days isn't he
37:19
after he failed the martial arts fighter
37:20
said i'm going to go home and cry now i
37:22
can't beat him cheese
37:26
this thing is selling tricks though i
37:27
didn't quite realize this was a thing
37:29
even amongst the great
37:30
legends so pt selbert himself had a big
37:34
argument with houdini at the time
37:36
because houdini said that he'd stolen
37:38
his walking through the wall trick
37:40
uh oh no he said houdini had stolen his
37:42
walking through the wall trick
37:43
and uh celibate said he'd actually
37:45
bought the trick from another another
37:46
magician
37:47
but they were just buying tricks from
37:48
each other houdini was buying tricks
37:50
from people
37:51
yeah he wasn't coming up with anything
37:53
and just to put pt selba in context this
37:55
was a person who
37:56
his name is disappeared uh to to the
37:58
layman but magic
38:01
i'm going to make my name disappear
38:06
we can all perform that kind of trick in
38:08
the long term i think after tonight's
38:09
show we might have done that
38:11
but yeah he um he was a hugely important
38:14
uh interesting guy so the big cheese was
38:17
sort of a minor bit of his career the
38:19
sawing a woman in half
38:20
absolutely revolutionized uh is still
38:22
used to this day to the standard that he
38:24
did it
38:25
he effectively introduced the magician's
38:27
assistant
38:28
when he had his assistant betty i think
38:30
her name was come and do
38:32
the sawing in half for the first time
38:33
that that revolutionized
38:35
it's still going today um he did a trick
38:38
in front of arthur conan doyle which
38:40
convinced arthur conan doyle
38:41
of the spirit world spirit spirit was a
38:44
massive thing to arthur conan dawg that
38:45
believed
38:46
in the afterlife and fairies and so on
38:48
and that was petey selby yeah so he was
38:50
he always believed in the spirit world
38:52
he was the most gullible man we've ever
38:54
researched
38:54
he would have believed in donkey who
38:56
told him the spirit world was a thing
38:58
but yeah he did show him his answer his
39:00
relations didn't he his dead relations
39:02
yeah did he dig them up and carry them
39:05
around
39:06
this is your great great great great
39:10
and and then selfie struggled didn't he
39:12
after the um to to kind of do anything
39:14
after the soaring the lady in half
39:16
um his late tricks were known as
39:18
destroying a girl
39:20
stretching a lady and crushing a woman
39:23
wow so he really had a title yeah
39:26
one of the things he did to promote the
39:28
show uh was to have stagehands pour
39:30
buckets of blood into the gutters
39:32
outside the theater
39:33
wow yeah and it was all it was all so
39:36
1920s ish
39:37
um 1910s and 20s it was all kind of due
39:40
to
39:40
anxiety over suffragettes and women's
39:42
liberation
39:43
and um he once invited christobel
39:46
pankhurst to be sawn in half on stage
39:48
for 20 pounds a week she said no
39:50
um but just the thing you said down of
39:53
inventing the
39:54
magician's assistant yeah it was kind of
39:56
only made possible by the change of
39:58
women's
39:59
fashion because before that you had very
40:01
bulky clothes you had a lot of
40:03
petticoats
40:04
it would have been very hard to fit the
40:06
woman into the box in the first place
40:08
because what she was wearing
40:09
yes and even then she's running so many
40:11
courses that it's unlikely you could saw
40:13
her in half
40:14
even if you wanted to and then it was
40:16
like i guess flapper fashion was it
40:18
yeah and then yeah the flapper fashion
40:20
comes in and suddenly
40:21
people fit in the box although i do have
40:24
bad news for you andy what i don't think
40:26
that they were actually sorting the
40:28
woman in half don't spoiler it for me
40:32
i've got tickets to the circus next week
40:34
um do you know that in queensland
40:36
uh australia um
40:40
that uh you're not allowed to own pet
40:42
rabbits
40:43
um there's obviously huge problems with
40:46
rabbits in the country so
40:47
uh in queensland you're not allowed to
40:48
own it unless you're a magician
40:52
yeah there's a magician called mr brit
40:55
there's only 34
40:56
uh magicians in queensland who are
40:58
permitted to have this uh
40:59
this thing where they're allowed a
41:00
rabbit and mr britt is one the rabbit's
41:02
called mr fluffy bum
41:04
and mr fluffy bum is one of the only
41:06
privately owned rabbits in queensland
41:08
wow i have a fact about pulling uh
41:09
rabbits out of hats which is the guy who
41:11
it's it's pretty vague who actually
41:13
invented pulling a rabbit out of a hat
41:14
but
41:15
a lot of people think it was a magician
41:16
called louis conte who was
41:18
i think a french magician he did so in
41:20
1814 but
41:21
i believe the first time he did it
41:23
sources are pretty few on this
41:25
the first time he did it he also
41:27
simultaneously pulled his
41:29
infant son out of the hat at the same
41:32
time
41:35
what have we got in here oh we've got a
41:36
rabbit and a baby
41:40
oh it's weird that the rabbit one's
41:42
stuck around yeah
41:45
do you nothing i think it's more it's
41:46
more impressive to pull a baby out
41:48
i think it's not impressive but it's
41:49
harder to get a baby
41:53
that's why it's more impressive oh yeah
41:55
yeah i do see that
41:57
yeah do you know the original pulling
42:00
your rubber out of a hat
42:01
i think is pulling an omelette out of a
42:03
hat
42:04
because i thought i was looking for this
42:06
because it is very controversial what it
42:07
is and most people say
42:08
we definitely know that 1840s is the
42:10
first time we pulled a rabbit out of a
42:12
hat collectively
42:13
but i did find something in the leeds
42:14
intelligencer in 1823
42:17
it was this court case it was a report
42:18
for court case a man was suing a
42:20
magician for the cost of a new hat
42:22
because he said that he spoke to the
42:24
magician and the magician has said
42:26
if you imitate me and break an egg into
42:28
your hat
42:29
then you'll get an omelet out of it just
42:31
imitate my movements exactly and so he'd
42:32
upturned his top hat
42:34
as at the magician and the magician had
42:35
broken an egg into his hat
42:37
flipped it up and on her come straight
42:38
out of it whereas the guy had done it
42:40
flipped it up and he got his entire suit
42:42
covered in raw egg
42:44
and that's a bit of an trick
42:46
isn't it
42:48
that's pretty bad it's like right if you
42:50
do exactly what i do i'm gonna saw this
42:52
lady in half you saw your wife
42:58
guys we're gonna have to wrap up shortly
43:00
i've got a fact about magic tricks going
43:01
wrong
43:02
yeah do you remember when uh secret and
43:04
roy
43:05
who did the magic with the tigers um roy
43:07
roy horn
43:08
of secret number but he was grabbed by
43:09
the throat by a tiger in 2003.
43:12
now the good news is he made a great
43:13
recovery and doctors said he would never
43:14
walk and talk again he absolutely did
43:16
he made a fantastic recovery but i
43:18
didn't know the story that they have
43:20
agreed on
43:20
for the version of events which is this
43:23
both broy and siegfried
43:24
insisted that the tiger had sensed that
43:27
horn was having a stroke
43:28
and was dragging him to safety
43:32
like where could the tiger go that it
43:35
would think
43:36
would be safe horn now 74 said i will
43:39
forever believe it was his concern for
43:40
my safety and well-being
43:42
that caused him to act as he did ah
43:45
that's amazing um just one little thing
43:47
on magic words
43:49
yeah um so the magic word expelliarmus
43:52
is from harry potter i think yeah yeah
43:55
um according to the oxford english
43:57
dictionary it comes from the latin
43:58
x bellare meaning to drive or force out
44:02
and armor which means weapon but
44:04
unfortunately
44:05
armor was also a euphemism for penis
44:10
so harry potter is probably saying
44:11
something like penis begone
44:16
does does that mean the first line of
44:18
virgil's a nerd is i sing of penis and
44:20
the man
44:23
i think a lot more people got the harry
44:24
potter reference
44:33
i'm starting to get why your mom is not
44:34

[Music]
00:11
hello
00:12
and welcome to another episode of no
00:15
such thing as a fish
00:16
a weekly podcast this week coming to you
00:19
live from auckland
00:28
my name is dan schreiber and i am
00:31
sitting here with anna chazinski
00:32
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
00:34
and once again we have gathered around
00:36
the microphones with our four
00:38
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:40
and in no particular order
00:41
here we go starting with you chazinski
00:44
my fact is that in 2004 moscow's
00:48
politicians were told to stop kissing
00:50
each other
00:50
because it took up valuable time that
00:52
could be spent having more meetings
00:58
just really got one laugh before the end
01:00
of it
01:02
you're gonna love this evening if you're
01:06
um yeah this is true this was i think it
01:07
was first reported in the british press
01:09
in the telegraph 2004 basically muslim
01:12
politicians were kind of sick of being
01:13
mocked by the media for the big
01:15
uh soviet era style bear hug they would
01:18
do in the three
01:19
kisses very enthusiastic kisses the
01:21
kissing ceremony
01:22
they would call it so a word was passed
01:24
down through uh local government circles
01:26
that they had to stop kissing each other
01:28
because it was time-wasting
01:29
it just took up so much time if you
01:31
walked into a meeting with 20 other
01:32
politicians in there
01:33
everyone had to do three ostentatious
01:35
kisses and a massive bear hug to each
01:37
other
01:37
and by that point the meeting was
01:38
adjourned
01:41
so it's about it's banned officially uh
01:44
from the meantime it was
01:44
people were told uh within regional
01:47
government that yeah you shouldn't be
01:48
doing it
01:49
but there is i didn't know this a thing
01:51
called the socialist fraternal kiss
01:53
which is a secret kiss that you can only
01:55
give or receive
01:56
if you're a communist leader wow
01:59
yeah so it's not many of them left is
02:02
there no
02:03
um no kissing club is getting smaller
02:05
and smaller every year
02:07
um so you do as you said there's three
02:09
kisses on alternate cheeks or if you're
02:11
really close on the lips
02:13
um and there's also the socialist
02:14
fraternal embrace which is three deep
02:16
hugs without kissing
02:18
three hugs you hug and then you push
02:21
away
02:22
and then you swing back in again it's
02:23
like the hokey cokey but with hugs
02:25
wow that's so ambitious
02:29
it's really gone in and out of fashion
02:30
in russia though since sort of
02:32
pre-soviet times
02:33
even and yeah i i read a really good
02:36
article which was in the washington post
02:38
in 1994 so obviously a few years after
02:40
the fall of the berlin wall
02:41
and it was a journalist saying how
02:43
devastated he was that the
02:45
socialist fraternal kiss seemed to be
02:46
coming back into fashion he said
02:49
we were so thrilled when the soviet
02:51
union collapsed because even though a
02:52
lot of things about its split opinion
02:54
it brought about one change that
02:56
everyone could agree on we could share
02:58
that no longer would our breakfast be
02:59
upset by photos of commie bigwigs
03:01
nuzzling each other's five o'clock
03:03
shadows and smacking each other on the
03:05
lips
03:08
and then it came right back into fashion
03:10
i guess it's gone in and out of fashion
03:11
everywhere hasn't it really
03:13
like kissing and greetings because it
03:15
used to be that if you ever had a
03:16
contract
03:17
in england or france for instance you
03:19
would have to kiss to make the contract
03:21
uh real right and that was at least till
03:23
the 13th or 14th century
03:25
and they reckon the reason they don't do
03:26
it anymore was that by the 18th century
03:29
um people's mouths were no longer vile
03:31
stinking diseased and stained
03:35
and so it meant that actually a kiss
03:37
became more eroticized
03:39
[Music]
03:40
so before that if you kissed someone on
03:42
the lips it was a real kind of
03:44
it's a burden yeah burden exactly wow
03:46
wow it meant you really wanted to do the
03:47
contract
03:48
but you but it was banned though in
03:50
various places since early medieval
03:52
times
03:53
and so in 1439 henry the uh
03:56
sixth of england banned kissing and it
03:59
was thought that it spread plague which
04:00
is actually quite well done on them
04:01
given they had no understanding of germs
04:03
and
04:03
for another half millennium but he
04:05
banned kissing it was banned in naples
04:07
and this is because particularly in
04:09
england kissing was a huge deal until
04:11
then so it was thought that spread the
04:12
plague but
04:13
foreign journalists would come to
04:15
england and they loved it
04:17
so there was uh erasmus not the erasmus
04:20
but another erasmus around that time
04:22
visited
04:22
england and just said i'm so thrilled
04:25
and surprised that female hostesses at
04:27
every single party just come up to me
04:29
and snog me full on the lips
04:30
really he never said the word snug come
04:32
on yeah
04:34
i pour the guy the other erasmus not the
04:36
main erasmus
04:38
he must have spent his whole career
04:39
going hi i'm erasmus no
04:41
actually uh there are two of us
04:44
the one about henry vi um it was
04:46
parliament who asked him to do this
04:48
because of the plague wasn't it
04:49
and the reason was that knights would
04:51
ever would always kiss the king
04:52
on the mouth whenever they did him a
04:54
service i don't know the service james
04:57
well i don't know what doing him or
05:00
services in this context
05:03
um kissing babies politicians kissing
05:04
babies is a long established thing but i
05:07
think it was first established by
05:08
president andrew jackson
05:09
so he once got handed uh in the reports
05:12
of the time a dirty baby to kiss and he
05:14
didn't want to
05:15
sort of thought it was a bit of a gross
05:16
baby so you're not kissing the bit that
05:18
gets dirty are you
05:19
you're not no um but it's it was a
05:22
grubby child
05:23
and he handed it he handed it over to
05:25
the war minister and said eaton kiss him
05:29
yeah well do you know who they kissed
05:31
before they kiss babies
05:33
oh um no fetuses no that can't belong
05:38
it's not just the thing before babies
05:40
okay
05:42
it was wives so in the 18th century and
05:45
before that politicians when they were
05:47
canvassing would kiss people's wives and
05:48
this is because it was openly understood
05:50
even though women couldn't vote they had
05:51
huge influence over the men in their
05:53
lives
05:53
and so politicians used to suck up to
05:55
women like almost literally
05:57
more than they did to men and it was a
06:00
thing if you go through
06:01
old book sources they're constantly
06:04
canvassing by
06:05
kissing women and in fact so is donald
06:07
trump just being old-fashioned
06:10
yeah it's just tradition
06:15
he's respecting the english aristocracy
06:18
um there was a candidate for norfolk
06:20
for a norfolk borough in 1758 who
06:22
apparently was expelled from the party
06:24
when he kissed all his voters wives and
06:27
slipped a golden guinea into the mouth
06:29
of
06:29
each one while doing so wow
06:32
that was pretty creepy that's a good
06:35
trick though
06:35
yeah if you can do it very clever very
06:37
clever give me a choke on that you
06:39
wouldn't be expecting that with a
06:40
bitcoin
06:41
that's a big coin um just i have a few
06:44
things that are banned in russia
06:46
okay uh everything no
06:48
[Laughter]
06:50
free speech no well it is a bit like
06:51
that actually
06:54
so there is a thing at the moment you
06:55
must have seen it in the news maybe i
06:56
don't know but um
06:57
the ross com nazdar is the federal
07:00
service for monitoring mass
07:02
communications okay and so there is an
07:04
app called telegram it's a bit like
07:06
whatsapp
07:06
and what you do is you send messages to
07:08
each other but it's encrypted and they
07:10
refuse to give the government
07:12
um the encryption software and so no one
07:14
can read their
07:15
messages and they tried to close it down
07:18
and they closed it down by blocking ip
07:20
addresses
07:21
in doing so they blocked and crashed
07:22
mastercard google
07:24
amazon volvo nintendo spotify
07:28
and their own website
07:32
and they've not managed to stop anyone
07:34
from using telegram at all
07:37
it's all of the election fiddling rumors
07:39
it's just them trying to sort out their
07:40
own messaging service
07:41
and accidentally crashing elections
07:43
around the world um
07:45
a couple things on meetings um just ways
07:47
you can um
07:48
actually i've got one more thing on
07:49
kissing which i think i want to say to
07:51
you
07:52
which is about animal kissing oh yeah so
07:54
not many animals kiss
07:55
very very rare apart from bonobos you
07:57
know bonobos they um
07:59
so bonobos will suck each other's
08:01
tongues for 12 minutes straight
08:04
wow that would get my vote i'll tell you
08:06
that you could probably get a few
08:08
thousand pounds in your mouth
08:11
keep the guineas coming come on hey i
08:14
read a thing about um kissing which is
08:16
now
08:17
if you're a um if you're a criminal
08:19
don't kiss someone at the scene of the
08:21
crime before you leave
08:22
because you can get caught for it i mean
08:24
who is actually doing that though
08:26
what bank robber says put everything in
08:28
the bag and give us a kiss
08:30
yeah this happened in paris basically uh
08:33
of course it was paris of course it was
08:36
he was overcome with the romance of the
08:38
city
08:38
yeah but so check this out what happened
08:41
was in this case
08:42
um there was a hold up with this uh lady
08:44
who worked for a bank
08:45
and they were really bad to her they
08:47
they did tricks to her that made her
08:49
fear for her life but
08:50
and so one of the bank robbers was so
08:52
worried that they'd gone a bit too far
08:54
with the trauma that he kissed her to
08:56
sort of calm her nerves like that would
08:57
help
08:59
so he gave her a kiss and they went off
09:02
and she freed herself and she called the
09:04
police and they took a swab from the
09:06
inside of her cheek
09:07
and they managed to pick up some of the
09:08
dna that he'd left inside there from the
09:10
kiss
09:11
and they found him and he got arrested
09:12
wow yeah
09:14
and sorry what's the source that said he
09:16
kissed her to calm her nerves
09:18
uh i think if he's leaving enough dna in
09:21
her mouth
09:23
that's almost a bonobo kiss isn't it
09:26
i would say that is aggressive although
09:29
it wouldn't the bonobo kiss would not be
09:30
allowed in hollywood for a very long
09:32
period of time because kisses in
09:34
hollywood
09:34
were only allowed to last three seconds
09:37
less than three seconds
09:38
um so it was so strict on kissing this
09:41
was from the 1920s onwards basically it
09:42
was the hollywood code because to
09:44
prevent like salaciousness and
09:45
immorality getting into hollywood
09:47
sorry started in the early 1930s and
09:50
it said that because this could only be
09:52
three seconds they had to be
09:54
essential to the plot otherwise they
09:56
weren't allowed and you had to kiss with
09:58
at least
09:58
two feet on the floor so if there are
10:00
four at least two
10:02
at least you can have three two three
10:04
four is fine
10:05
hang on a kiss takes two people so there
10:08
are four feet involved
10:09
okay so at least two of the couple's
10:11
feet but it didn't mean that when you
10:12
see
10:12
a woman lying on a sofa in a 1940s film
10:16
and snogging a man who rigidly stays
10:18
standing up for the process
10:19
that's because he's not allowed to get
10:20
onto the sofa with her wow
10:23
you could both be hopping that would be
10:25
fine oh yeah
10:27
as long as you're not both off the
10:28
ground at the same time ditso
10:30
trampolines
10:32
hey we're gonna have to move on to our
10:33
next hack shortly i genuinely did have a
10:35
thing about meetings
10:37
which is which is a way to keep a
10:38
meeting short this is genuinely been
10:40
tried
10:41
to save time in meetings so it's by the
10:43
co-founder of uh flickr
10:44
the the app uh her name was katarina
10:47
fake which i think is her real name
10:49
um but she she
10:52
she used to insist that everyone would
10:55
drink a pint of water
10:57
before a meeting and the meeting would
10:59
last until someone had to go to the loo
11:02
ah that's really cool yeah yeah that's
11:05
amazing that's great and we're using
11:06
that principle tonight
11:07
so yeah
11:10
okay it is time for fact number two and
11:13
that is james
11:14
okay my fact this week is that the
11:16
northern ireland assembly building
11:18
was camouflaged during world war two by
11:20
covering it in cow manure
11:24
so cool yeah so this is a thing that
11:26
happened um it's stormont it's called
11:28
and um they painted it with a mixture of
11:30
cow manure and bitumen
11:31
and the problem was it was a really
11:32
really white building and they thought
11:34
that the nazis would be able to see it
11:36
really easily
11:37
and so they thought if we cover it and
11:38
it will look like the rest of
11:40
belfast wow
11:44
wow
11:45
[Applause]
11:47
do you know james i've i've really
11:49
enjoyed our show in belfast air in the
11:50
year and i'm just sad that it's never
11:52
ever going to happen again
11:54
not bizarre how much support that i got
11:55
in auckland new zealand
11:58
um yeah but and actually they um they
12:00
spent seven years scrubbing it after the
12:03
war
12:03
and it's still slightly off-white yeah
12:07
it was meant to wash right off right
12:08
that's why they use that specific
12:10
material but yeah it's failed so it's
12:12
got a hint of
12:13
poo all into it
12:16
wow people did try some really
12:18
extravagant things to disguise buildings
12:20
in the water didn't they
12:21
so and so boeing's plant number two
12:24
which was the
12:25
american plant that made sort of most of
12:27
their bombers i think during the second
12:29
world war
12:29
was disguised as an entire town it's so
12:33
cool so it made 300 bombs a month it was
12:35
totally crucial to the war effort but on
12:37
top of this factory
12:39
they had fake streets and fake trees and
12:41
fake cars and houses
12:42
but because it was only meant to be
12:43
disguised from above everything was
12:45
weirdly distorted from below so all the
12:47
houses were four foot tall
12:49
so they they were like shoulder height
12:51
houses it's like hobbit town down the
12:53
road isn't it
12:56
they were designed by a hollywood set
12:57
designer who was used to doing that
12:58
stuff for
12:59
tricks in films and trees were made of
13:01
chicken wire covered in feathers
13:04
and then there were weird little clues
13:06
like the streets in this place were
13:08
called things like
13:09
synthetic street on the street signs wow
13:11
you have to get pretty close in an
13:13
airplane to be able to read that
13:14
yeah and also they had leaves that were
13:18
chicken feathers that were painted green
13:20
yeah
13:21
why didn't they just use leaves yeah
13:23
fair play i'll tell you why it's because
13:25
they did
13:25
no there's no good reason the reason is
13:27
is that as anna said this is in
13:29
hollywood and what the government did is
13:31
they spoke to the disney studios
13:32
universal warner
13:34
and all of them got so excited they sent
13:35
in all of their best set people and they
13:37
just took it too far
13:39
and they were sending real people in day
13:41
to day to act out as if they were living
13:42
there and they would
13:43
move the cars so that it looked like
13:45
things were different they had to go and
13:47
take down their
13:48
washing this was in a different one
13:49
because there were a few one in
13:49
california uh
13:51
sort of actors or people in the military
13:52
had to go and take their washing down
13:54
off the fake washing line they're fake
13:56
washing off the fake
13:57
line just in case there's a plane
13:59
further ahead which it didn't ever
14:02
if the towns were tiny though because
14:04
they were smaller they were to a smaller
14:05
scale wouldn't it have looked like there
14:06
were giants
14:08
yeah along the west coast of america
14:11
that's scary that's very scary yeah
14:14
don't mess with them they're huge
14:17
um on disguising things in the war so
14:20
there was also a thing called operation
14:22
bertram which was in britain mainland
14:24
britain
14:25
and it was using uh fake equipment and
14:26
fake munitions to trick
14:28
the the germans into thinking that
14:30
things were elsewhere when they weren't
14:32
but get this one tactic that was used
14:35
was to hide
14:35
real artillery under fake trucks and
14:38
also
14:39
to hide real artillery under structures
14:41
which looked like badly camouflaged
14:43
dummy structures
14:44
oh wow so they would fly over and think
14:47
oh they've really
14:48
botched disguising that you know making
14:51
a stupid fake
14:52
bit of artillery there so that's all
14:53
fake artillery great with real artillery
14:55
underneath it
14:57
wow what i'm so confused and so
15:00
that's the idea james yeah
15:04
that's amazing that's a risky game it's
15:06
risky yeah
15:07
do you know they actually had i didn't
15:09
realize this at the time they had a
15:10
camouflage school
15:11
in south kensington so it was a place
15:14
where they
15:14
sent all of their um their most uh
15:18
sort of camouflage the designers who who
15:20
sort of manufactured all of these things
15:22
that we're talking about
15:22
a lot of the british ones would go and
15:24
they would come up with their ideas
15:25
there and they would road test them
15:26
there
15:27
a number of the ideas that came out of
15:28
there and manufacture down it out of
15:30
there they um
15:31
they had a thing where if you were in a
15:33
trench in the war it'd be very dangerous
15:35
obviously if snipers
15:36
were shooting at the trench so what they
15:38
did was they manufactured
15:40
lots of paper mache heads and they put
15:42
them on a stick so they would lift up
15:43
from the trenches just a stick
15:45
with a head on it a soldier's head and
15:47
if that got shot they would know
15:48
that the snipers were active and ready
15:50
so that was one of the things that they
15:51
manufactured
15:52
yeah pretty cool why didn't they always
15:55
do that
15:55
it's why did anyone die in the trenches
15:58
i suppose you could have given every
16:00
soldier an extra fake head on top of
16:02
their head
16:04
and a really all like you know one of
16:05
those costumes where it looks like
16:06
you're riding an emu
16:08
yeah yeah because in that case
16:12
the head is always the person's head
16:13
isn't it i guess so so i guess it would
16:15
be a massive emu costume with a
16:17
which you're in which they're not
16:19
shooting well you could do it you know
16:20
when you have like children trying to
16:21
get into a movie and they're on each
16:23
other's shoulders
16:23
oh yeah and a massive uh overcoat
16:26
because then they'd also think you were
16:27
giants
16:28
yeah wow yeah what a shame pantomime
16:30
directors didn't also direct the first
16:32
world war
16:34
so um a use of dung in the second world
16:37
war yeah um when the german army were in
16:39
north africa
16:40
um a lot of the soldiers suffer from
16:41
dysentery and what they thought they'd
16:44
do is they'd look at the locals didn't
16:45
seem to suffer so they thought they'd
16:46
look at the locals
16:47
and they saw the locals would follow a
16:49
camel and scoop up
16:50
its dung and eat it okay
16:54
so the germans thought well we might as
16:56
well try it you know
16:58
might as well right and it turns out it
17:00
works and that's because there is
17:01
beneficial bacteria in this
17:04
camel poo and for that reason these
17:06
camel dung things were really good luck
17:08
for the germans they found them to be
17:10
really really good look and so whenever
17:11
they saw them in the tanks they would
17:12
drive over them
17:14
and so what did the british do we just
17:16
put explosives in them
17:18
and so every time they went over a camel
17:20
dung they got blown up
17:22
and so then they thought okay we're not
17:23
going to do that anymore but we still
17:25
need the good luck so what they would do
17:26
is they'd
17:27
go over ones which had tire tracks in
17:29
them and so what did the british do
17:31
they made ones with tire tracks in them
17:33
and put explosives in them
17:34
oh those dastardly brits there's always
17:37
one step ahead
17:38
uh dungeon dungeon war other uses of
17:41
dungeon war vietnam war
17:42
uh there was the soldiers had i think
17:45
which was a dog poo
17:46
transmitter so it was the t eleven
17:48
that's a transmit dog poo
17:50
no sorry it's a fake radio it's a dirty
17:53
fido
17:54
sort of plastic poo which is actually a
17:56
radio transmitter and it can be used as
17:58
a homing beacon
17:59
that's great but they're going to notice
18:01
if you hold that next to your mouth and
18:02
speak into it
18:03
they think they'll probably think you're
18:04
a hangover from the north african
18:06
campaign in the second world war
18:09
just giving it a go that reminds me
18:11
there is there was an interview in the
18:12
indian express quite
18:14
recently with a guy called shankar lao
18:16
and he's part of a group that's trying
18:17
to promote
18:17
traditional methods in in india and he
18:20
says that he applies fresh cow dung
18:22
to the front and back of his mobile
18:24
phone every day
18:26
and he says that that is going to
18:27
protect him from harmful radioactive
18:29
emissions
18:32
um he says in the interview if cow dung
18:34
can treat cancer
18:35
why can't it save us from phones
18:37
microwaves
18:39
i think there is a if there is a flaw in
18:41
that argument isn't there
18:42
yeah although they have considered using
18:46
human dung
18:47
in space uh we never call it dumb i know
18:50
but human poo in space so the mars
18:52
mission that was planned in 2013
18:54
planned which has come to nothing and
18:56
they've sort of hidden that fact
18:58
but they plan to use human poo on the
19:00
outside of the spacecraft
19:02
in order to protect it from radio race
19:03
right yeah and in 2017 there was a study
19:06
that was done
19:07
looking into whether human feces would
19:08
be useful protecting from
19:10
outer space radiation and it turns out
19:12
it will and more importantly
19:14
it will even when it's been dehydrated
19:16
because you know how in space you
19:18
obviously need to reuse all the liquids
19:19
that you can in order to drink them
19:21
so you can drain the liquid out of your
19:24
own poo and drink that
19:25
and you're still able to use the dried
19:27
poo to protect you from radiation
19:33
it's a win-win yeah
19:36
but it's not just on the outside isn't
19:37
it the idea is that they would as they
19:39
were going to mars any new poo
19:41
that they made would you smear it on the
19:44
inside
19:45
it's only it's only new poo sorry it's
19:46
only new poo exactly so you don't
19:48
pre smoke i understand i understand that
19:50
but it's going on the outside right not
19:51
the end why are you going outside
19:53
every time you have a poo you've got to
19:54
go outside and smear it on your wall
19:56
yeah well because
19:57
it's protecting from i'd rather live on
19:59
it okay i'd rather live in a home which
20:01
had poo smeared all over the outside
20:02
then all over the inside
20:07
this is why you'd never pass the nasa
20:09
training
20:10
[Laughter]
20:14
what would you choose sorry
20:18
would you right
20:22
you're hurtling towards mars i'm going
20:23
to go outside into the vacuum of the
20:26
universe
20:26
just so that i can put my little stool
20:29
on the side no
20:31
i just mean how long it
20:36
they don't call it an outfit
20:37
[Laughter]
20:45
i just mean socially i would rather my
20:46
neighbors thought i lived in a horrible
20:48
house but i live in a nice house
20:51
[Music]
20:53
please all right so this is it's also
20:56
poo based i'm afraid but
20:58
um this is quite cool there is a there
21:00
is a plant which pretends to be an
21:02
antelope
21:03
poo in order to propagate itself so
21:06
uh it's the restiad plant and it
21:08
produces seeds and they're quite big
21:10
seeds and they look exactly like
21:11
antelope droppings
21:13
and this tricks dung beetles into
21:16
rolling them to a new home
21:20
how weird is that a free ride yeah
21:23
basically
21:25
um well there's so a lot of insects keep
21:27
their own feces
21:35
if you say that in a sentence i can edit
21:37
it in
21:39
it's like they invented puber like uber
21:46
[Applause]
21:50
so there are insects that keep their own
21:52
poo to use as a weapon which is good
21:54
recycling
21:55
uh there are quite a few of them
21:56
actually there's the tortoise beetle
21:58
and it mounts its poo on its back so
22:01
when it defecates then it puts its
22:02
opponents back
22:03
and that's a shield and it can also
22:04
repurpose that shield to use as a sword
22:06
in a fight
22:08
if it's attacked and
22:16
it's funny it's funny it's a
22:19
it's a poo sword it's a busan it's a
22:22
bruce sword
22:23
and his offspring have what scientists
22:25
seem to be calling a fecal thatch
22:27
which is basically the roof of your home
22:30
that you make oh now the roof first the
22:32
inside and the outside
22:34
i thought the roof was safe would you
22:37
rather have it on the top of the roof or
22:39
the inside of the room
22:42
we need to move on a sec but finish this
22:43
anna that's it they'll have a fecal
22:45
thatch they have a patch made of poop
22:47
they weave it together they weave it
22:49
like a thatch though it's called thatch
22:51
for a reason they sort of sew their poo
22:53
together they're poo strands
22:54
and that's a protective thatch so when
22:56
the larvae
22:57
are attacked the tortoise beetle larvae
23:00
then they can't penetrate the poo
23:02
it's weird though because the swords are
23:04
made out of poo but also the protection
23:06
is made out of poo
23:07
yeah it's yeah just interesting this is
23:10
why they're not running the show on this
23:11
planet frankly
23:15
okay it is time for fact number three
23:18
and that is
23:19
andy my fact is that according to the
23:21
best available study
23:22
men think about sex between once a day
23:25
and
23:25
388 times a day
23:30
so what you're saying is the best
23:31
available study is not very good well
23:34
all there's a load of variation yeah
23:36
it's so
23:37
this is more a fact about study design
23:39
strap in guys
23:43
in case you thought it was about sex
23:45
it's not
23:47
so there are lots of uh myths and things
23:50
on the internet about how often men
23:51
think about sex and some
23:52
you know one thing says every seven
23:53
seconds that's a really old and debunked
23:55
thing
23:56
yeah and that would be seven thousand
23:58
times a day which is huge
23:59
um so there was a recent study by ohio
24:02
state university which gave
24:04
uh people gave men a clicker with three
24:08
buttons
24:08
and they were food sex and sleep and it
24:11
just said
24:11
click each of the relevant buttons
24:13
whenever you think about this thing
24:15
so they did that and one man clicked the
24:17
sex button one time in a day and another
24:19
man in the study clicked 388 times which
24:21
is everything
24:22
he might have been aroused by clickers
24:24
[Laughter]
24:29
i think he misunderstood and thought it
24:31
was which one of these do you want to
24:33
order
24:36
it's like you have a menu yeah hi i
24:38
think my click is broken i've pressed
24:40
the
24:40
sex order a number of times it's not
24:43
shown up
24:44
yeah but the people who did this study
24:46
um what they wanted to do was
24:49
they they wrote about it and they said
24:50
that what they don't want is for people
24:52
to report it as
24:53
men think about sex on average 19 times
24:56
a day because
24:56
that's what they found the average was
24:58
19 times but they thought if people
25:00
reported it like that then people would
25:02
be saying
25:03
i think about it too much i think about
25:05
it not enough and people get anxious
25:06
about that i think they're unusual
25:08
and so they're really keen for people to
25:10
say men think about sex between
25:11
1 and 388 to show that all of these
25:14
things are quite normal
25:15
that's what i said that's what i said
25:17
and i'm i'm thanking you oh cool
25:20
well thank god we didn't mention the
25:21
thing that they didn't want knowing
25:22
james
25:24
the other thing is this was of men under
25:26
the age of 25
25:28
this was college students and they said
25:30
that they really want to do it of
25:32
adults over the age of 25 but it was
25:34
hard to obtain that sample
25:36
because most of the participants did not
25:37
follow through with the telecounter
25:39
because they had no real incentive to do
25:41
so
25:42
oh yeah they just couldn't be asked they
25:44
were like oh yeah whatever they pressed
25:46
it once they realized
25:47
it wasn't working as a menu
25:50
so there are other ways of solving this
25:52
problem because in that study
25:53
you don't know if people are clicking
25:55
accurately or if the thought passes
25:56
through their head too quickly to
25:57
register or if having a clicker as you
25:59
said makes them more aware of their
26:00
thoughts
26:00
so there was a german study which did a
26:03
different thing that it was a phone
26:04
survey
26:05
and they they would uh text people on
26:07
the phones
26:08
and they would ask seven times a day and
26:10
they would just say what have you been
26:11
thinking about in the last half hour
26:14
and that found that so that's a slightly
26:17
better way of doing it perhaps because
26:19
you're not relying on self-reporting and
26:21
you're yeah you're just
26:22
checking in with people and that one
26:24
found that until 5 pm
26:25
men think about sex less frequently less
26:27
frequently than they do about coffee
26:30
and the checking email was in first
26:31
place almost constantly
26:35
and sex only became a big thing at the
26:36
end of the day and even then sleep
26:38
beat it that is my experience of sex as
26:42
well
26:46
it always wins in the end steve but
26:49
is i guess the only thing that really is
26:52
illuminating
26:53
in these studies a lot is that men have
26:55
needs-based thoughts don't they
26:57
so always men think about food
27:00
sex and sleep more often than women do
27:03
and it's not clear why but that does
27:06
seem to be the case so i think in this
27:07
study it was
27:08
uh thinking about food men six every 62
27:11
men every 38 minutes women every 62
27:14
sleep
27:15
women thought about it every 72 men
27:16
every 33
27:18
so women have so much more thinking time
27:20
to use up
27:22
is that the take home thing there my
27:24
take home is honestly how did the
27:25
patriarchy ever get
27:27
above water yeah you guys are wasting so
27:31
much time
27:35
there's a thing about how many thoughts
27:36
you have a day no one knows that people
27:38
quote wildly different numbers
27:40
because some people say it's 70 000 a
27:42
day which is about 50 thoughts every
27:44
minute
27:45
and i just this is i know this is an
27:46
anecdote but i do not have 50 thoughts a
27:48
minute
27:49
i do agree with that in your case yeah
27:51
thank you
27:54
do you know what
27:55
[Laughter]
27:57
do you know what questions do to your
27:58
thinking no well whatever
28:02
yeah you would think it would encourage
28:04
you to think creatively because you're
28:05
trying to come up with an answer
28:06
no no it um so this is a good point uh
28:10
it stops you from thinking about
28:11
anything else it engages your brain your
28:13
brain effectively goes
28:15
and shuts down to focus on this one
28:17
thing that's about to come at you
28:19
but that's good right that's exactly
28:20
what you want from a question what
28:22
depends what the question is doesn't it
28:24
if the question is would you rather have
28:26
poo on the outside of your house on the
28:27
inside
28:28
then there's probably better things to
28:30
think about 100
28:32
according to a 2013 study men think
28:34
about football at least once a minute
28:37
i mean that i again i don't want to i
28:39
don't want to be a debbie downer on that
28:40
but i
28:41
i haven't thought about football for
28:42
about at least a month
28:45
and even then it was bloody football's
28:46
on again
28:48
that was according to a study by the
28:50
english fa
28:53
um so on thinking i've been thinking
28:57
about thinking and it's very hard to
28:58
find out about
28:59
experiments about thought online because
29:01
if you google that you just get thought
29:02
experiments which is a different thing
29:04
however there is a thing about whether
29:06
animals think
29:08
and what they think if they think
29:09
obviously they do think um
29:11
but if you search for do animals think
29:14
the first suggested google result the
29:16
first one
29:17
is do animals think humans are cute
29:22
i think that some of them do don't they
29:24
maybe but but number four
29:26
is do animals think cars are animals
29:31
and there's so much thought devoted to
29:33
this online and what's the answer
29:35
well uh it's not because they've got
29:38
four
29:39
wheels which could be like legs yeah
29:40
exactly they're big so there was an
29:42
account written on reddit which i just
29:43
wanted to
29:44
share so there's a guy who wrote on
29:45
reddit he said once rescued a hungry cat
29:47
from a fishing spot it was deadly scared
29:49
of being in the car and couldn't stay
29:51
still
29:51
it was a hazard for me to drive back
29:53
with it in the cabin so it left me no
29:54
choice but to put it in the trunk
29:56
to my surprise traveling at 70 miles an
29:58
hour the cat managed to hit the child
30:00
escape handle and jump out
30:03
i believe the cat thought the car was
30:05
some sort of big
30:06
whale and got swallowed then pooped out
30:11
traveling 70 miles per hour
30:13
wow
30:17
this this wasn't a scientist writing
30:19
this i don't think so
30:22
where has a cat ever seen a whale
30:30
weird okay it is time for our final fact
30:34
of the show and that is my fact
30:36
my fact this week is that in 1565
30:39
pope pius iv commissioned artist daniela
30:43
del
30:43
voltera to add to michelangelo's sistine
30:46
chapel fresco
30:47
by painting underwear on all the naked
30:50
people
30:53
this is presumably it was nice underwear
30:56
and not sort of grubby white fronts
30:58
well it was yeah underwear of the time
31:00
so the underwear was more loin clothy
31:03
and yeah
31:04
sort of little sheets that would come
31:06
over and you know
31:07
nicely positioned in the wind over a
31:09
buttock kind of thing
31:11
um but this is uh this is because um it
31:13
was seen as very controversial that you
31:15
had this beautiful
31:16
fresco with all these penises basically
31:20
hanging out on them and they wanted to
31:22
get rid of that and
31:24
this particular artist daniela del
31:26
volterra
31:27
was a disciple of um of michelangelo who
31:30
painted the sistine chapel
31:32
he studied under him he was a very good
31:34
friend of his and so
31:35
he was he was given this task to go and
31:37
sort of just cover up all the nudity
31:39
the uh the volterra guy do you think
31:40
when people ask him what he did he said
31:42
i'm a panther and they'd say do you need
31:44
a painter and he'd say no
31:48
i don't think so yeah it's unlikely yeah
31:50
because he was it
31:51
he was italian and the joke wouldn't
31:52
work in that light yeah it doesn't let's
31:54
be honest it doesn't really work in this
31:56
language
31:58
but he did get a nickname which uh still
32:00
is attached to his name to this day
32:02
which is
32:04
and that means the breaches maker and it
32:07
was
32:07
it was an embarrassing thing really in
32:09
the history of art that he had to do it
32:11
i've heard arguments that he did it uh
32:14
because he was actually
32:16
trying to save the sistine chapel from
32:18
total destruction so he was doing it to
32:20
save his friends
32:21
yeah because that was okay because you
32:23
said he was a disciple and i thought
32:24
that he's a massive traitor
32:27
but no because sorry just what happened
32:29
was they had the council of trent just
32:31
afterwards and there was a new law which
32:32
said you're not allowed any of these
32:34
kind of images in churches anymore
32:36
and any ones that exist have to be
32:37
destroyed and he managed to put this on
32:39
just in time so they didn't destroy it
32:42
yeah it said that the holy synod ordains
32:45
that no one be allowed to place or cause
32:47
to be placed
32:48
any unusual image in any place or church
32:51
however
32:52
accepted except that image that have
32:54
been approved by the bishop
32:56
so you weren't allowed to put anything
32:57
in your church that wasn't approved
32:59
and this a few years later there was a
33:00
guy called paulo veronasie
33:02
and he was brought in front of the
33:03
inquisition because he'd painted the
33:05
last supper
33:06
with a load of drunken germans in the
33:08
background
33:11
that's not his fault they turned out
33:12
[Laughter]
33:16
unusual unusual images like i think the
33:18
council of trent still holds that you're
33:20
not allowed on usual images in your
33:21
church maybe
33:22
that's so weird unusual isn't even
33:24
erotic or salacious
33:25
it's like a lizard eating harrison ford
33:27
or something
33:30
i love i love it andy's idea of those
33:33
guys just turning up and even being
33:34
forced to paint it i love the idea that
33:36
all future last supper
33:37
paintings had a bouncer at the end
33:39
[Laughter]
33:40
sorry mate can't come in um so
33:43
michelangelo's david was another
33:45
victim of what is called the fig leaf
33:47
campaign by the church and by the
33:49
authorities in florence which is all
33:50
about covering up uh genitals basically
33:53
so um nude statuery
33:56
statutory statue news statues
33:59
were a new thing so there's a there's an
34:03
idea which says that donatello's david
34:05
in 1440 was the first naked statue since
34:07
roman times
34:09
and that there just weren't any in all
34:11
the dark ages because it had fallen out
34:13
of favor as an ideal whereas in roman
34:15
and greek times it wasn't ideal it's a
34:16
nude hero
34:17
and it wasn't a shameful thing but um
34:20
the fig leaf campaign was all about
34:21
covering things up and so michelangelo's
34:23
david
34:24
got either a bronze fig leaf reports
34:27
vary
34:27
or a mini skirt uh soon after
34:31
soon after being unveiled because it was
34:33
seen as being rude really yeah
34:35
it's just on michelangelo's david it's
34:37
very easy to look back and think
34:39
god how weird and prudent were they
34:40
didn't appreciate it
34:42
but in 2012 uh the most expensive
34:45
exhibition that had ever been put
34:47
on in the beijing museum was put on and
34:50
it
34:50
involved michelangelo's david apollo and
34:52
when it was reported on cctv on chinese
34:55
tv
34:55
uh the all the genitals were blurred out
34:58
so the statues genitals were blurred
35:00
out wow really so we're still screwing
35:02
that up
35:03
they there was a paper that was
35:04
published about the reasoning because um
35:07
if you look at michelangelo's david
35:08
everything is in fantastic proportion
35:11
all the he's he's
35:12
fantastic he doesn't have quite a small
35:14
penis
35:15
yes and that's very well proportioned
35:16
james
35:20
[Laughter]
35:23
click how many
35:30
that click immediately
35:31
[Laughter]
35:33
yeah so um what they were looking at
35:35
they were doing the study and they
35:36
noticed a few things that were
35:37
intentionally
35:38
changed in size so for example um he has
35:41
a big right hand
35:42
for example and that's because the
35:44
suggestion is when you
35:47
you're not you're not allowed to do your
35:49
own jokes
35:53
it just looks like a small penis because
35:55
his right hand is so freakishly big all
35:57
right
35:58
it happens it happens
36:03
andy had hand extensions years ago
36:09
he's regretted it ever since
36:13
but yeah so the suggestion is uh because
36:16
that was a tribute to the fact that he
36:18
took down goliath
36:19
um and so the they looked at the penis
36:22
size
36:23
and said the reason that it's so small
36:24
their conclusion is
36:26
he's about to fight a giant he's his
36:28
genitals have contracted in fear
36:32
yeah he's petrified they've gone inside
36:34
he's
36:36
and he's what happens is it that's
36:39
yeah have you ever thought of giant well
36:41
you're yeah
36:46
it's a different excuse isn't it i'm
36:47
sorry darling it's very cold
36:50
i'm sorry darling i just fought a giant
36:56
and i won high five
36:57
[Laughter]
37:04
it was it was a thing though covering up
37:06
paintings in
37:07
in the renaissance and beyond and um
37:10
so there was a renaissance fresco was
37:13
discovered recently under a
37:14
full ceiling in valencia and it had been
37:17
covered up for about 500 years
37:19
and it was discovered when a pigeon
37:21
suddenly flew out of a hole in the roof
37:23
so some builders were redoing the roof
37:25
a kind of baroque roof that they thought
37:26
was real baroque and a pigeon flew
37:28
through a hole
37:29
and they looked up through that hole and
37:31
they realized it was a fake baroque roof
37:33
and there was a huge fresco underneath
37:36
that had been covered up
37:37
not because it was obscene or anything
37:38
just because it was rotting in about the
37:41
1600s and it turned out that builders
37:44
have been asked to cover this thing up
37:45
to protect it
37:46
but what we discovered a few years ago
37:49
when we revealed this big fresco
37:51
was that the 1700s workmen
37:54
who had to break it up had flicked
37:57
plaster globules at each other so they'd
37:59
had a game so all the sort of targets
38:01
on the fresco like the eyes and the
38:03
mouth of the angels
38:04
had big globules of plaster on them
38:06
they've been throwing plaster at each
38:08
other
38:08
and one of the angels wings had a
38:10
and balls drawn on it
38:16
1674 people were drawing and balls
38:20
on angel's wings wow
38:24
wow you know you know there's a rumor
38:27
that all the because a lot of generals
38:29
were chipped off statues
38:30
yes and uh that was the thing during the
38:33
fig leave campaign which lasted
38:34
uh decades but there is a rumor that
38:36
there is a draw in the vatican still
38:38
full
38:38
of all the removed penises really and i
38:42
can't
38:42
well i can't stress the word rumor
38:44
enough i mean
38:46
but it would make sense because you
38:47
would you would keep them we wouldn't
38:49
throw them away
38:50
you in case you needed them use them for
38:52
building or
38:53
no they're not useful for anything else
38:54
but sometimes you know politics may
38:56
change
38:56
yeah and there might be a great the
38:58
great repenting might happen
39:02
um can i quickly add as well just on our
39:04
guy uh
39:05
voltara um i i'm definitely saying that
39:07
wrong but
39:08
he uh he didn't get to complete it all
39:11
so he only did a number of them and then
39:13
he passed away and it was carried on by
39:15
other artists yeah um yeah so he didn't
39:17
it's not
39:18
he's not responsible for him at the top
39:20
didn't he yeah when he was on
39:21
scaffolding and then they had to remove
39:23
all the scaffolding because they had to
39:25
get a new pope or something
39:26
yes and then when by the time they got
39:28
the new pope he died and so someone else
39:30
had to do the other ones
39:31
does anyone know if they've uh been
39:32
removed the underpants that were painted
39:34
on or
39:34
not no they haven't this is a very
39:36
interesting thing
39:37
um so the vatican restores a lot of
39:40
these frescoes and paintings in the
39:42
ceiling
39:43
between 1980 and 1994 and a lot of the
39:46
censorship has still remained yeah i
39:47
think
39:48
some of them have been removed some of
39:49
them have been removed but they could
39:50
have obviously revealed all the genitals
39:52
and they've only revealed some
39:54
and they used to when they're restoring
39:55
because they've restored michelangelo's
39:57
sistine chapel a number of times um the
39:59
last judgment sorry is it's
40:01
really called um and what they used to
40:03
do back in the day with restoration is
40:05
they would dab little bits of bread
40:06
and clean it with tiny bits of bread and
40:08
really yeah and these days
40:10
they use cotton buds and so on i've
40:11
heard that still some restoration
40:13
people use bread as a good way of
40:16
cleaning a painting because they used to
40:17
use bread as erasers didn't they before
40:19
we had rubbers then you'd use a rolled
40:21
up bit of bread as an eraser yeah
40:23
so um a lot of people think that um
40:25
michelangelo painted while lying down on
40:27
his back
40:27
i think there's a movie where he did
40:29
that but actually um he was painting
40:31
kind of standing upright kind of
40:34
cricking his neck backwards and reaching
40:36
upwards with his arm and painting like
40:37
that and it was unbelievably painful for
40:39
him
40:40
and he wrote a poem to his friend about
40:43
what happened and he said my stomach
40:45
squashed under my chin my beard's
40:47
pointing towards heaven
40:48
my brain's crushed in a casket my
40:50
breasts twist like a harpies
40:52
my brush above me all the time dribbles
40:54
paint so my face makes a fine flaw for
40:57
my droppings
40:58
my haunches are grinding into my guts my
41:00
poor ass strains to work as a
41:02
counterweight
41:03
every gesture i make is blind and
41:05
aimless and it goes on and on basically
41:07
he was an
41:08
unbelievable pain wow and i read this
41:10
and i don't know if this can be true
41:12
but it says um someone called condivi
41:14
who was around just afterwards said that
41:16
he
41:16
had a bizarre form of eye strain which
41:18
meant whenever he had to read a letter
41:20
he had to hold it at arm's length above
41:22
his head
41:23
no were he was holding the no really
41:26
apparently god he also painted because
41:29
it's nine panels and it tells a lot of
41:31
stories from the bible
41:32
um he painted it in reverse he started
41:35
at the end
41:36
and went back because he wanted to get
41:38
so good at painting that by the time he
41:40
got to god
41:41
he wanted to be an actor he didn't want
41:42
to do a crappy god at the front and then
41:45
and then a killer noah's ark at the end
41:47
he wanted
41:49
wow but he is an important thing to say
41:52
though he
41:52
was made to paint the city in chapel
41:55
michelangelo this is
41:56
as punishment and it was thought it
41:58
would be a huge failure
42:00
and so raphael the other turtle
42:03
who is well-known
42:07
suggested that he uh
42:11
be the one to paint the city in chapel
42:12
ceilings it was thought to be impossible
42:14
and also because michelangelo
42:15
did not really do paintings he did
42:17
sculptures and he really didn't want to
42:18
do it he did it under papal duress he
42:20
was made to do it
42:21
and raphael was so happy and the reason
42:23
he was happy was because uh
42:25
michelangelo had a falling out with
42:26
raphael's friend
42:28
leonardo son of da vinci and so as a big
42:32
turtle
42:33
really do you think the reason he didn't
42:35
do it on his back is because he won't be
42:37
able to get back up again
42:45
so was donatello in this on that as with
42:48
every other piece of history that
42:49
involves the three other turtles
42:50
donatello was not involved
42:52
because he was long dead sadly
42:55
but the interesting thing about raphael
42:57
and how it backfired was that raphael
42:59
snuck in to see the sistine chapel
43:01
mid creation so michelangelo said cover
43:04
it up with canvas so no one can see it
43:05
until it's fully done and raphael snuck
43:07
in and had a look
43:08
and he was so devastated by how good it
43:10
was that he returned to his picture of
43:12
the prophet isaiah
43:13
and completely destroyed it scratched it
43:16
off the wall
43:16
and repainted the whole thing because he
43:18
realized that michelangelo's was so good
43:20
you know he got a really bad review when
43:22
he first released the sistine chat
43:24
released
43:25
[Laughter]
43:27
he got critics some critics loved it but
43:29
other critics really did not like it
43:31
yeah so um this is uh this is the
43:33
writing from a critic
43:34
who um called um pietro aratino
43:38
again bad pronunciation but he wrote and
43:41
he was specifically about the lewdness
43:42
and the and the nudity
43:44
makes such a genuine spectacle out of
43:46
both the lack of decorum in the martyrs
43:48
and the virgins
43:49
and the gesture of the man grabbed by
43:51
his genitals that even in a brothel
43:52
these eyes would shut so as not to see
43:55
it and that that was
43:56
two stars two stars and no one at the
44:00
time really pointing out that um
44:01
aratino uh who wrote this uh was a very
44:04
famous writer of pornography
44:06
so this is someone oh yeah coming from
44:09
and so
44:09
michelangelo didn't respond to it he was
44:11
better than that and he didn't give any
44:13
sort of reaction to it but then he got a
44:15
second bit of criticism
44:16
much later and this was by someone who
44:18
was the master of ceremonies for the
44:20
pope
44:20
so it's very close to the pope and he he
44:22
took a jab at michelangelo's sistine
44:24
chapel
44:25
and so michelangelo then included him in
44:27
the sistine chapel
44:28
he took his likeness and he had a snake
44:31
wrapping around him which meant he was
44:32
definitely going to hell
44:34
and then the top of the stake was here
44:36
the bottom of the snake came through his
44:37
legs and was biting his balls
44:39
yeah it's a pretty harsh response to a
44:42
critics review of your show
44:44
[Music]
44:45
[Laughter]
44:47
we're gonna have to wrap up very shortly
44:48
anything before we do um
44:50
i can tell you that there was a pub in
44:52
shepparton in the uk called the hovel
44:55
and in the ladies toilets there was a
44:57
statue of a naked man with a fig leaf on
44:59
it
44:59
the fig leaf was hinged and when you
45:01
lifted it a small sign read
45:03
a red light just flashed on and the
45:05
buzzer sounded in the bar
45:07
[Laughter]
45:14

hey everyone welcome to this week's
00:01
episode of no such thing as a fish
00:03
before we get going we just want to let
00:05
you know that this is a particularly
00:06
interesting episode
00:08
it's what we like to call a crossover
00:09
episode you may be aware of crossover
00:11
movies uh take the latest avengers movie
00:14
where they had guardians of the galaxy
00:15
involved
00:16
we've decided to do a crossover episode
00:18
with ourselves
00:19
it's very ambitious but i think we've
00:22
managed it
00:23
uh we screwed up didn't we dan we did uh
00:26
we screwed up we were in wellington we
00:28
were on stage
00:29
wellington is in new zealand and uh we
00:31
were recording
00:32
a show as part of our tour and uh we've
00:35
only just found out that the final two
00:37
facts
00:37
are missing the recording is gone or the
00:40
final one and a half facts i think
00:42
and you'll notice i believe yeah so what
00:44
it'll sound like is that all of our
00:45
jokes are falling really really flat
00:49
how will listeners tell the difference
00:52
okay so listen carefully because you
00:54
might actually miss it uh we'll do our
00:55
best to make sure it's flagged up but
00:57
if we've done our job well you won't
00:59
notice okay on with the show
01:12
hello and welcome to another episode of
01:15
no such thing as a fish
01:16
a weekly podcast this week coming to you
01:19
from wellington
01:28
my name is dan schreiber and i'm sitting
01:31
here
01:32
with anna chazinski andrew hunter murray
01:34
and james harkin
01:35
and once again we have gathered around
01:37
the microphones with our four
01:39
favorite facts from the last seven days
01:41
and in no particular order
01:43
here we go starting with fact number one
01:46
and that is chozinski my fact is that
01:50
if a lamb starts being born the wrong
01:52
way up the farmer pushes it right back
01:54
up into the womb and gets it to start
01:56
again
01:59
and i just i thought i'd do a fact about
02:01
sheep because we're here
02:03
and wow
02:06
that is a risky start see
02:09
not everyone in the room is a sheep
02:10
farmer
02:12
but on the size of love about half of
02:14
them are yeah
02:16
um so yeah this is this i think i first
02:18
came across a new yorker piece that was
02:20
an interview with a guy called james
02:21
rebanks who's a sheep farmer in cumbria
02:23
in the uk
02:24
and he was saying yeah most lambs if
02:26
they're being born well they come out
02:27
like a diver
02:28
so it's like head and front legs first
02:30
but if the legs and the head come out in
02:31
the wrong order at all
02:33
you literally have to shove it right
02:34
back up there and rearrange them and
02:36
order that they can't
02:37
come out the right way and so he gave
02:39
various instances
02:40
where of ways that it could go wrong so
02:43
if the legs come out without a head
02:45
then you have to go that means the head
02:47
that doesn't mean
02:48
it's left the head right behind in the
02:49
uterus it just means the head's a bit
02:52
bent
02:53
so you've got to return it and rearrange
02:55
it and when you do rearrange it they
02:56
have to
02:57
cup the mouth of the lamb so that the
02:59
lamb's teeth don't tear
03:00
at the birthing canal in the uterus
03:02
crikey i know it's a combination of
03:04
extremely sweet and extremely disgusting
03:06
yeah i've not i'm yet to hear the sweet
03:08
part
03:10
he's helping the little lamb get out
03:12
intact okay when you put it like that
03:14
what does the sheep think as the baby's
03:16
birthing is suddenly
03:18
pushed back in like that that's got to
03:21
be the weirdest experience ever
03:22
we don't have any records on what they
03:24
think but they must be concerned right
03:26
i read a thing that sheep have an
03:28
incredible peripheral vision
03:29
um they've not that incredible that they
03:31
can see up there
03:36
but they think they can go almost to
03:37
360. they've almost got 360 views which
03:40
are nice
03:40
it's almost impossible to sneak up on
03:42
them yeah
03:44
that speaks a lot of experiences
03:50
almost but not quite
03:51
[Laughter]
03:54
but they must as it's being shoved back
03:56
in they must they must
03:57
look like what are you doing i can't see
04:00
you
04:01
they're very dappy i mean genuinely they
04:03
are quite um i think they're quite crap
04:05
mothers at least at the start so
04:07
we just i read so many farming blogs and
04:11
turns out yous are very bad at knowing
04:13
which ones are their babies and the
04:14
babies are very bad at knowing which
04:15
ones are their mothers and they're
04:16
constantly getting confused about this
04:18
and going off with the wrong parent
04:20
and so alarm will accidentally pick the
04:22
wrong parent that won't be able to
04:23
produce milk and so it'll starve
04:25
and um there's this there's this weird
04:27
thing where um farmers
04:29
sometimes uh lamb will be born and be an
04:31
orphan so the you might die in
04:32
childbirth
04:33
and this amazing thing that farmers do
04:35
to trick yous
04:37
into believing that another lamb is
04:39
their lamb
04:40
and what they do is they'll be a you
04:42
that's pregnant with one lamb
04:44
and it gives birth to it and the farmer
04:46
then needs to trick the
04:47
you into thinking it's about to have
04:48
twins and so
04:50
what he does prepare yourselves is first
04:52
of all he covers the orphan lamb in the
04:55
birthing fluid so that it smells right
04:56
from the
04:57
from the other one and um he ties its
04:59
legs together because often that land's
05:01
a day old or so and they can run away
05:03
and if you're just giving birth or
05:05
something it's very unusual for it to
05:06
immediately
05:07
go gallivanting over the fields and then
05:10
what he does is he sort of puts inserts
05:12
his hand
05:13
into the u and pretends that his hand is
05:17
the second lamb that's being born and
05:19
then the you will be convinced that
05:21
she's having contractions
05:22
and think that she's giving birth and
05:23
you keep it in there and then you whip
05:25
it out and then you quickly do the magic
05:26
trick of
05:27
quickly shoving the orphan lamb under
05:29
the used nose
05:30
and thinks oh that must be what just
05:32
came out of me i've got a fact about
05:35
lambing sound effects so this is from
05:38
the long-running radio 4 show the
05:41
archers
05:42
oh yeah they have a style guide on how
05:43
to do the sound effect of a lamb being
05:45
born
05:45
wow okay yeah so you have to overlay
05:48
agitated barring that's very important
05:51
so there's buying going on and it sounds
05:52
stressed and then you put a soaking wet
05:54
towel on your shoulder
05:55
it's really heavy and then you squeeze a
05:57
huge amount of yogurt through your
05:58
gloved hands
06:00
and then you drop the wet towel onto a
06:02
bed of old recording tape
06:04
wow why don't they just use the
06:07
recording of an actual lamb
06:10
often they don't sound right do they
06:11
when you do the actual thing it doesn't
06:13
sound like what you would expect that
06:14
it might happen that if you recorded
06:16
that it would just sound like an old
06:17
towel
06:18
being dropped after some yogurt has been
06:20
strange
06:22
i i thought i would find out um what
06:24
farmers did
06:25
but i forgot to look on the blogs i went
06:27
on to reddit
06:28
and there was an ama with the sheep
06:31
farmer
06:32
and one of the top questions was why do
06:35
they have such shitty asses
06:38
the farmers or the sheep they were
06:41
speaking about the sheep um
06:42
the guy said this is true it's as though
06:44
they have zero control or awareness
06:46
of what comes out um and they actually
06:49
sell jackets to go over the sheep to
06:51
protect the wool from getting dirty for
06:53
those who want super clean wool
06:55
wow so you get some sheep who are
06:56
wearing like an all-in-one onesie with a
06:59
little hole
07:00
and it keeps us clean and will that be
07:02
made of a previous sheep
07:04
[Laughter]
07:06
well there is uh one thing that they do
07:09
again if they want a you to adopt an
07:11
orphan sheep they will
07:12
shave the wool off one of its real
07:15
offspring and then
07:16
put it on the other one as a disguise so
07:18
they literally wear
07:20
the other lamb's clothes so it's like a
07:22
sheep in sheep's clothing
07:26
it's lamb in lamb's clothing but yeah i
07:28
think everyone gets the idea it's very
07:29
clever
07:30
did you know that sheep have their own
07:31
weather forecast what in the uk sheep
07:33
have their own weather forecast
07:35
they do it's just been launched it's in
07:37
bristol and it's a traffic light system
07:39
of warnings
07:40
which measures weather and it works out
07:41
the risk of there's a very particular
07:42
parasite they get
07:43
called nematodes and if you are a
07:46
matadiris and i've pronounced it wrong
07:47
please don't write in
07:48
um but it's very useful the only problem
07:51
with it is that
07:52
they have not called it the sheeping
07:54
forecast
07:57
guys i think you've grown there when you
07:59
went to support of hearty chuckle
08:01
so it's a forecast not of weather but of
08:03
parasites yes well it's weather
08:06
which tells you when the parasites are
08:07
going to be coming in wow
08:09
and it tells the humans not the
08:10
it's really a forecast for farmers isn't
08:12
it
08:13
or do the sheep gather around 5 p.m
08:16
every monday there'll be a lot of
08:17
parasites out there tonight look lively
08:19
stay sharp
08:22
that's i i was reading a medical report
08:24
about um
08:25
it just gives you virus it talks about
08:27
viruses and parasites and so on that
08:29
come up
08:29
and um these people who are reading it
08:31
noticed a sort of very odd entry in it
08:33
which is that
08:34
um a few people who were farmers who
08:37
were involved in
08:38
castrating lambs when they were born
08:41
got very ill very quickly and there was
08:43
12 people who got ill
08:45
but they worked out that two of them got
08:46
ill because they were castrating with an
08:49
old method that still goes on these days
08:51
not not completely but in the 1800s all
08:53
the time
08:54
uh they castrate using their teeth so
08:57
these are
08:58
yeah these are humans who go and two of
09:00
these guys
09:01
um were castrating these these lambs
09:03
with their teeth and they got
09:05
very ill um one of my best friends has
09:08
done that in australia
09:09
western australia yep did they get ill
09:12
he said well he's pretty insane but he's
09:14
not sick
09:15
okay i think he is sick yeah and they go
09:18
by on a conveyor belt right and you lie
09:19
underneath them and you just whip them
09:21
off one by one what
09:22
yeah well you come up like jaws like you
09:24
just
09:26
bite off their balls it's your friend
09:28
australian
09:29
he lived in australia for a year well he
09:30
was british yeah feels like they kind of
09:32
saw him coming down there
09:34
yeah yeah we all do this mate
09:38
this guy looks like he'll bite the balls
09:40
off anything
09:42
do you know how farmers can tell when
09:43
sheep have mated this is an interesting
09:46
thing well they wait
09:47
nine months yeah um so what they do well
09:51
in a lot of farms what they do is they
09:53
draw uh
09:54
on the males with crayon okay
09:57
and then if they come back later so they
09:59
draw on the underside of males with
10:00
crown and if they come back later
10:02
because you can't be watching the sheep
10:03
all the time
10:06
it might be chalk here but in some
10:08
places and in the sources i found it was
10:10
crayon
10:11
anyway if they come back later and the
10:13
females got crayon or chalk
10:17
on her back then they know that mating
10:20
has occurred but you wouldn't think that
10:22
crayon would work
10:23
right yeah you
10:27
[Applause]
10:29
two hearken
10:32
hey another weird thing that happens to
10:35
female um
10:36
pregnant uh sorry sheep is that um they
10:38
get really heavy
10:40
the with the weight in there and their
10:41
wool gets really heavy so
10:43
sometimes they lose balance and they tip
10:45
over and they fall on their back
10:46
like a like a total and they can't get
10:48
back up so they get stuck so farmers
10:50
have to go
10:51
and sort of like bring pregnant sheep
10:53
back onto their feet otherwise they're
10:54
just stuck there upside down
10:56
wow really yeah it's sheep spinning they
10:58
are stupid aren't they they are
11:01
someone sent me a text uh in the break
11:03
and i can't remember who it is and i've
11:04
turned my phone off sorry but um they
11:06
said that when it snows
11:08
um the sheep can't believe that the um
11:10
grass is underneath the snow they think
11:12
it's just disappeared
11:14
and so they'll just start to death if
11:16
you don't kind of clear them a little
11:17
clearing
11:18
is it another one of those magic tricks
11:20
they think have happened like they are
11:21
the swapping of the lab and apparently
11:23
like cows and cattle they all clear it
11:25
away
11:26
wow but sheep are just stupid they they
11:28
sometimes um
11:29
so they have to groom their lambs when
11:31
they give birth to them and
11:32
sometimes they get so carried away with
11:34
grooming that they bite their tails off
11:36
wait sorry the mother i thought you
11:39
meant this was your friend
11:40
biting i think your friend just really
11:43
likes lamb
11:45
but yeah the mothers they've got to lick
11:47
off all the after birth and stuff but
11:48
they get really excited and they'll bite
11:50
the
11:51
umbilical cord and they'll just bite the
11:52
tail off and the farmers don't know what
11:53
to do because you're not supposed to get
11:54
involved because otherwise that might
11:56
separate the mother from the lamb
11:57
and so they just have to watch sort of
11:59
going no stop it stop biting the tail of
12:01
your child
12:02
oh my god guys we're gonna have to move
12:05
on shortly to our next fact
12:07
just one last thing mary had a little
12:09
lamb the nursery rhyme is based on a
12:11
true story
12:15
you know that yeah well there's nothing
12:18
supernatural in there
12:20
it's just about someone called mary who
12:21
had a little lamb it's quite believable
12:23
yeah and the sheep followed her wherever
12:25
she's a good herder she's
12:26
yeah it's a very what's what's your
12:28
point andy
12:30
was she um famous was she a famous
12:32
married she was not she was a woman
12:35
called mary sawyer i was in
12:36
massachusetts in 1830
12:38
she had a lamb and it followed her all
12:40
over the place and
12:41
my friend interesting no no the
12:44
interesting thing was
12:45
um its fleece was as white as snow
12:52
when i've disappeared where am i
12:57
okay it is time for fact number two and
12:59
that is
13:00
andy my fact is that the netflix
13:02
category
13:03
gory canadian revenge movies
13:07
only has one film in it
13:10
wow and what's the film dina i don't
13:12
i've got it written down
13:13
um um
13:17
your research today has been very
13:18
relaxed it consists of reciting nursery
13:20
rhymes and having
13:21
half-formed facts so what the what the
13:24
thing that happens is there
13:25
are there are these micro categories on
13:27
netflix and if you
13:29
have a netflix account you might have
13:30
seen them so um goofy werewolf comedies
13:33
is one
13:34
or sentimental movies about horses for
13:36
ages 11 to 12.
13:38
[Laughter]
13:43
and some of them some this is the
13:44
bizarre thing netflix has made
13:46
76 897 unique categories according to
13:50
the last count done
13:51
and some of them have nothing in them so
13:54
the feel good romantic spanish language
13:56
tv show netflix has none but they've
13:58
created the category because some will
14:00
exist
14:00
wow so for instance skiing non-fiction
14:04
none of those um iranian comedies none
14:07
of those
14:09
so we're just waiting to discover them
14:11
or it's like when they knew
14:13
india existed and they tried to find it
14:15
if you pitch a show to netflix to make
14:17
they'll probably be like well it's a
14:19
idea but we need one of those
14:22
you've got the money they actually um
14:24
there was a
14:25
role that was advertised in the uk for
14:27
someone specifically to create these
14:29
kind of categories
14:30
uh so the idea was they they advertised
14:32
for someone who would basically
14:34
binge watch netflix they would just sit
14:36
and watch movie after movie and while
14:37
they were watching they would think of
14:39
unique different tags
14:40
that they could give to each of those
14:42
movies to create these kind of
14:43
categories
14:44
but the other thing is they have
14:46
professional watchers
14:47
so this is this fact is from a piece in
14:49
the atlantic which was fantastic it was
14:51
a journalist who ran a script to
14:52
download all
14:53
76 000. um the the guys who
14:56
professionally watch netflix
14:57
they tag movies with all kinds of data
15:00
so
15:00
it's not just you know how rude the plot
15:02
is or whether there's violence
15:04
they tag how conclusive the plot is they
15:06
tag how moral the characters are
15:08
and they just analyze everything and
15:10
they all they want is to get you to
15:12
watch more netflix
15:13
so one of them said you might like what
15:15
i consider to be horrible movies
15:17
but my job right now is to get you to
15:18
watch all those horrible movies that you
15:20
want
15:21
and they have thousands of categories
15:23
designed specifically for that but who's
15:25
specifically looking for
15:26
things like this that's what's so weird
15:28
who wants a thing that's 80 percent
15:30
conclusive with moderately moral
15:32
characters no one's searching for that
15:33
in networks
15:34
that sounds fun yeah okay maybe also i
15:38
think that there are films and their
15:39
categorization
15:40
uh filling isn't very good so um one of
15:42
the ones that has nothing in it is
15:44
suspenseful time travel movies
15:46
there's definitely got to be some of
15:47
those like back to the future is
15:49
suspenseful right
15:50
yes yeah um sentimental action and
15:53
adventure
15:54
there must be one sentimental action
15:56
film out there yeah not everything's on
15:57
netflix so that's the
15:59
issue i guess back to the future i don't
16:01
think is on netflix therefore
16:03
maybe they're just waiting to it is stan
16:06
apparently
16:08
guy at the back watched it this morning
16:11
right after birthing his lambs
16:14
so netflix uh released a load of their
16:16
stats from 2017
16:18
and apparently someone in new zealand
16:20
watched grown-ups 331 times slasher
16:25
great movie absolute great movie but 331
16:29
times in a year
16:30
apparently there's a podcast called the
16:32
worst idea of all time where they tell
16:34
you to do that so that's why they did
16:35
that
16:36
ah cool and there was one viewer in
16:39
antarctica
16:40
uh who binged on shameless and there was
16:43
one person in america who watched the
16:45
first pirates of the caribbean movie
16:46
every single day for a year wow
16:50
i'd rather do that than watch the fourth
16:52
pirates of the caribbean movie
16:53
once
16:54
[Laughter]
16:59
netflix has shamed people for this
17:01
though they sent out a tweet in december
17:02
last year saying to the 53 people who've
17:05
been watching a christmas prince
17:07
every day for the past 18 days who hurt
17:10
you
17:12
oh that's pretty mean it's a combination
17:15
of mean
17:16
uh creepy just
17:19
one more thing that they've got about uh
17:21
category wise they've got
17:23
so many things uh starring the actor
17:25
raymond burr
17:27
yeah yeah so they've got suspenseful
17:30
movies starring raymond burr
17:31
they've got cerebral mysteries starring
17:33
raymond burr
17:34
they've got understated suspenseful
17:36
dramas starring raymond burke they've
17:38
got about 15
17:39
raymond burr exclusive categories it's
17:42
very bizarre
17:43
that's so good um do you i i
17:46
know netflix i guess from the last let's
17:48
say five years i think that's when i
17:50
started using it
17:51
i had no idea that netflix has been
17:52
around since 1997.
17:54
it's an extremely old company it was
17:56
extremely old
17:58
it's not general electric is it
18:01
it's old for for what what i think most
18:04
people perceive
18:05
to be a very you know 2000s uh at least
18:08
2010s
18:09
uh something it's kind of that thing so
18:12
i
18:13
was looking into it and it's a very
18:15
interesting backstory there's a number
18:16
of stories that their
18:18
um creator of netflix founder reed
18:21
hastings
18:22
puts out one is that he got a very big
18:24
bill for a vhs that he
18:26
sent back in too late was apollo 13 and
18:29
he thought there's got to be a better
18:30
system so he created it
18:32
and what it used to be is like those
18:34
things where you would order a dvd
18:35
off the internet the difference was
18:37
rather than getting a booklet that told
18:39
you everything that was in it back in
18:40
1997 there was a website
18:42
that would send you a vhs and so you
18:44
would just pick it from the website
18:45
and order it so it already had a web
18:47
presence back then but yeah that's
18:48
i remember when it was just dvds and
18:50
they send you dvds through the post and
18:52
that still exists that um business
18:53
yeah and it's still making money um but
18:55
actually in 2000 reid hastings
18:58
approached blockbusters and asked them
19:00
to buy netflix for 50 million dollars
19:03
the entire company and they refused and
19:07
wow that did not age well that decision
19:09
did it
19:11
just one tiny little nugget about reed
19:13
hastings when i was reading into him
19:15
his grandfather was a very famous
19:17
physicist
19:18
and he was um he was very important in
19:21
the roles of inventing radar
19:23
and the atomic bomb for world war ii and
19:26
president roosevelt
19:27
said of of reid's uh grandfather
19:31
that he was a civilian who was second
19:33
perhaps only to winston churchill in
19:35
facilitating the allied victory in world
19:37
war
19:38
ii so his grandfather is a seriously
19:41
important character
19:42
wow yeah sort of an unknown name to the
19:44
general public
19:45
wow they've both made equally important
19:47
contributions i would say
19:49
beautiful happiness of the world the
19:51
read hastings story about its inception
19:53
is i
19:54
quite amuses me because there is this
19:55
story he tells when it's asked how did
19:57
you come up with netflix he says i was
19:58
overcharged for
19:59
a film and i was charged forty dollars
20:02
it was apollo 13 charged 40
20:04
i'd lost the film he said i didn't want
20:06
to tell my wife about it and i said to
20:08
myself
20:08
am i really going to compromise the
20:10
integrity of my marriage over a late fee
20:12
which i would say his marriage is on
20:13
shaky ground if that's going to
20:15
compromise its integrity
20:16
um but uh so so then he thought okay i'm
20:20
gonna set up a new company that doesn't
20:21
do this
20:21
but his co-founder is called mark
20:23
randolph and he just keeps killing this
20:25
story
20:26
so he maybe he's exaggerated the story
20:28
over time or he's piecing things
20:29
together that weren't together at the
20:31
time
20:31
and mark randolph every time he's
20:33
interviewed it's like no it's
20:34
retasting story no
20:35
no it didn't happen but it's a nice
20:37
story isn't it so i let him tell it
20:39
wow come on get your story straight guys
20:43
so um netflix and chill is the thing oh
20:45
yeah
20:46
there's an article on fusion.com about
20:48
the history of that phrase
20:50
and they said that the first use was in
20:51
january 2009 by at
20:53
no face nina on twitter and by 2014
20:57
summer of 2014 it had a slightly sexual
20:59
meaning
21:01
and then by october so a few months
21:03
later um someone said that netflix and
21:05
chill never means netflix and chill now
21:08
these days lol okay so that was at
21:11
it is isaac on twitter
21:14
how many days is that quite a lot right
21:17
okay or maybe i just pressed the key too
21:19
long on my keyboard i'm
21:20
sure and then by the end of that year it
21:23
was all over twitter
21:24
and then by august 2015 u.s parents were
21:27
asking their kids what netflix and chill
21:29
meant
21:30
and they were using it and that became
21:32
the end of the meme so basically
21:35
it lasted for less than six years from
21:38
going from nothing
21:39
to cool to don't say that anymore yeah
21:43
my wife um didn't know what netflix and
21:45
chill meant
21:46
the sexual context of it and whenever
21:48
now you have a baby don't you
21:50
we do have a baby yeah and we were
21:52
watching grownups for the 50th time when
21:54
we conceived him
21:56
but we um yeah so whenever work finished
21:59
for her
22:00
her bosses would be like what are you up
22:01
to tonight i'm just going to be home
22:02
with my husband netflix and chill
22:04
she thought oh we're just chilling and i
22:07
told her on a train what it meant and
22:08
her face went
22:10
what but at least she wasn't saying i'm
22:13
going home to see my mum netflix and
22:14
chill
22:15
you know the husband that's actually
22:16
okay that's true um
22:18
do you know that netflix knows exactly
22:20
when you will get hooked on a series
22:22
because it's quite this is quite creepy
22:23
it's quite but it's also quite
22:24
interesting um
22:25
so it it works out the exact point the
22:28
definition of being hooked is
22:30
it works out the exact point at which 70
22:32
of people
22:33
go on to finish the series so that's
22:35
their definition of being hooked
22:37
so uh breaking bad you will be hooked by
22:40
episode two
22:41
you know on average uh how i met your
22:43
mother episode eight i wonder with
22:45
breaking bad if it's quicker to get
22:46
hooked watching the show
22:49
or taking crystal meth yeah
22:54
uh the big bang theory apparently never
22:57
[Laughter]
23:01
[Applause]
23:03
and for fans of the big bang theory that
23:05
was a laugh
23:15
just on the subject of breaking bad and
23:17
uh and drugs and being hooked
23:19
netflix actually co-created drugs and
23:22
and released drugs
23:23
it's a really old company isn't it
23:27
no um netflix uh co-created a set of
23:30
cannabis strains
23:31
based on a selection of its popular
23:33
original shows and they did this
23:35
i was a pop-up event in west hollywood
23:37
for the alternative
23:38
alternative herbal health services and
23:40
the set
23:41
of drugs that you could buy were called
23:43
the netflix collection and they were a
23:44
part of helping to
23:46
create these so you could get ones that
23:48
were made to tie in orange as the new
23:50
black who would tie in with that
23:51
um there were ones for arrested
23:53
development um which were labeled the
23:55
banana stand kush
23:59
uh yeah ideally for a big yellow joint
24:01
that was the that was the thing and
24:03
they did it for the grace and frankie tv
24:06
show as well so you can you can buy
24:08
cannabis which is co-created by netflix
24:11
and smoke it while you binge
24:12
and do they do the thing where you have
24:14
two tokes and you go
24:15
oh that's good and someone comes up to
24:17
you goes i think you might also like
24:18
this by the way
24:20
or maybe this one over there yeah
24:24
they don't make any profit from it by
24:25
the way it was just a they just
24:27
want to get people high
24:29
[Laughter]
24:31
um did you know there is a spanish
24:32
platform which is related
24:34
in fact no sorry legally it's unrelated
24:37
but
24:38
it there is a spanish platform called
24:40
netflix which
24:41
is tv to fall asleep very easily too
24:44
and it might just be me but i think all
24:46
the stuff on it sounds really good
24:48
so so there's a big bang theory
24:54
please please edit those jokes
24:58
do you have a hope of having to carry on
24:59
there one day no i just don't want to be
25:01
killed by an army of nerds i just said
25:04
they've got you might like us james
25:06
they've got a four-hour video of the
25:07
world chess championship 2013.
25:09
you like jess i do i uh subscribe to a
25:12
special chess channel do you
25:14
i like the ones slugging off fans of the
25:16
big picture
25:19
yeah so netflix ran a competition to fix
25:22
its algorithm so the thing it does where
25:24
it recommends stuff that you might like
25:25
it has been a massively difficult thing
25:27
to achieve over the years in 2006
25:30
there was a one million dollar reward
25:32
for anyone who could improve the
25:33
recommendations algorithm
25:35
so it could actually recommend stuff
25:36
that you genuinely would like and it
25:38
took three years to be won it was won by
25:40
this collective
25:41
and improved the accuracy of the one
25:43
they had by 10
25:44
and it's so weird so all these coders
25:46
were competing for it
25:48
took three years and then the people who
25:50
won and the people who came second
25:52
only uh submitted their bits 20 minutes
25:54
apart
25:55
so they lost a million dollars by 20
25:57
minutes wow but the main challenge
25:59
for these coders is napoleon dynamite so
26:03
how do you mean no algorithms seem to
26:05
know if someone's going to like napoleon
26:08
dynamite
26:10
that was it and that was the challenge
26:11
it was set it was like can you work out
26:12
if someone would like napoleon dynamite
26:14
because we don't know
26:15
there seems to be no rhyme or reason to
26:16
it wow yeah that's
26:18
incredible as well making a million
26:20
dollars in 20 minutes
26:21
which is coincidentally what the cast of
26:22
uh the big bang theory do
26:24
[Laughter]
26:25
we're gonna have to move on in a sec
26:26
guys for our next fact did you see the
26:28
survey that netflix did last year on how
26:30
people are watching and so two-thirds of
26:32
people watch
26:33
netflix in public now or watch stream in
26:36
public which i think is weird um
26:38
do you mean like on the train on the
26:40
train on the commute to work whatever i
26:41
know i have a phone from 2001 so maybe
26:43
that's why i don't do it but um
26:45
last so this is last year and it found
26:47
that 65
26:49
of people have burst out laughing on
26:50
public transport while watching it
26:52
20 have cried in public and then been
26:54
embarrassed about it
26:56
but 27 percent of people who've been
26:58
streaming stuff in public
26:59
on public transport for example have had
27:02
strangers interrupt them while they're
27:03
watching to start talking about
27:05
the show that they're watching is that a
27:07
thing
27:08
i i once
27:11
okay i was in
27:14
japan once i was in tokyo and i was on
27:17
one of the
27:17
subway trains and i noticed the phone of
27:19
the guy sitting next to me
27:21
he was a western guy and he was
27:22
listening to no such thing as a fish
27:26
and i no hang on he was no wait the
27:29
story hang on
27:31
he was he was watching qi and i leaned
27:34
over to him and i said
27:36
i wrote that and he did not believe me
27:41
and i know from the way he said oh okay
27:45
and they've gone off at the next stop on
27:47
the flight over from australia to new
27:50
zealand
27:50
um there was a guy sat in front of me
27:52
you and anna
27:53
who was listening to no such thing as a
27:55
fish right yeah that's right and we were
27:56
chatting behind him he must have been so
27:58
freaked out when he took his headphones
28:00
off
28:02
this has all got a bit more boring very
28:04
quickly
28:05
[Laughter]
28:07
we need to move on to our next pack guys
28:08
okay it is time for fact number three
28:11
and that is james okay my fact this week
28:14
is that in
28:14
sacred moche combat the aim was not to
28:17
kill your opponent
28:18
but to knock his hat off
28:22
uh and the loser didn't get off that
28:23
easily though because he would
28:24
immediately be sacrificed
28:26
oh you lose your hat but fortunately
28:29
you won't have a head anymore to put it
28:31
on
28:33
so the mache were a civilization from
28:36
peru
28:37
and i learned this last year when i
28:39
visited the larco museum of
28:41
pre-columbian art in lima
28:43
and we know about this because all we
28:45
know about these people they're really
28:46
mysterious
28:47
but everything we know comes from their
28:48
pottery and we have kind of they're like
28:51
little cartoons of what happens and so
28:53
that's how we know about it
28:55
so what kind of hats are they it like a
28:57
top hat because the top part would be
28:58
quite easy to knock off but then a
29:00
beanie is quite difficult
29:02
that's true yeah and a bike helmet
29:03
almost impossible yeah yeah
29:05
they were large feathery kind of feather
29:08
pieces
29:08
sounds easy yeah it is easy well
29:12
really they just wanted someone to
29:13
sacrifice yeah i don't think they really
29:15
gave a who it was
29:16
and i think sometimes they also then
29:18
sacrifice the winner right this is
29:19
someone who's thinking me so american
29:20
cultures but they'd sacrifice a guy
29:22
whose hat got knocked off but then they
29:23
thought the gods also deserve their best
29:25
warriors so they would sometimes also
29:27
sacrifice the one who'd won the battle
29:29
it's a real catch 22. that's terrible
29:31
yeah
29:32
oh it's a pre-show interview like the
29:34
pre-match interviews how are you feeling
29:36
about the match
29:37
not good um
29:40
yeah i didn't know that they they made
29:42
rubber balls
29:43
yes they did some of them yeah the
29:46
olmecs especially
29:47
yes the some miso americans they made
29:49
rubber balls and they could make some
29:50
match different compounds this is very
29:51
cool and some of them
29:53
um had the scientists believe that they
29:55
made sixteen thousand balls a year in
29:57
special
29:58
rubber ball factories wow yeah this is
30:01
like yeah this is not very true though
30:03
does it
30:04
not factories come on it's got the word
30:07
fact in it james
30:08
[Laughter]
30:10
is this the miso american ball game that
30:12
we're talking about is this
30:13
i thought that was a much like slightly
30:15
different to sacred moche
30:17
hat combat yeah the later miso american
30:19
ball game yeah they play with these
30:21
these balls and it's a crazy game and
30:22
again
30:23
um historians are not quite sure whether
30:25
when the loser
30:26
and the winner are determined who were
30:27
the ones that were murdered
30:29
and sacrificed off the back of it uh
30:32
they think it might have been the losers
30:33
who got sacrificed but actually the gods
30:35
were more interested
30:36
in the best blood and the most um
30:38
skillful so actually you would probably
30:40
kill
30:40
the the better team the winners and
30:43
there was this extra thing where they
30:44
would chop their heads off
30:46
and some historians believe that then
30:48
they took the heads of the opponents and
30:50
then used those as like a post-match
30:51
ball game
30:52
to then play with their heads there are
30:54
pictures of that happening
30:56
yeah you know the the drawings that we
30:59
have of them doing that
31:00
and they would also drink out of them
31:01
sometimes so the post-match skull would
31:03
be used as a drinking vessel
31:06
they would recycle it's not a way to
31:08
drive up the quality of the game i think
31:10
to kill good teams and bad teams alike
31:13
yeah
31:14
i think that's why we should say they
31:16
almost certainly didn't do this the vast
31:17
majority
31:18
of the time i i read a really good
31:20
analogy which was um imagine if in
31:22
5000 years people looked at all of the
31:24
christian art that we have now and
31:26
thought
31:26
wow this is so weird they just crucified
31:28
people left right and cetera every time
31:30
they went to church
31:31
just because that's the thing that's
31:33
remains the image that remains
31:35
it probably did happen but probably not
31:38
that often
31:38
yeah they seem to have really disliked a
31:40
particular look in people and if you had
31:42
a beard and you had dark hair you'd be
31:44
crucified
31:45
there was um so they do have really
31:47
interesting pottery the
31:49
mache people and in a but there was an
31:51
exhibition in paris a few years ago
31:54
about it was called sex death and
31:55
sacrifice in the material religion
31:57
and it had to have a warning on the way
31:58
in about explicit content
32:00
even though this is from how long ago 2
32:03
000 years ago
32:04
yeah best part of that but have you seen
32:06
it because it is pretty
32:08
hardcore i can i've got some some good
32:11
things on my computer that stopped me
32:12
having to look at that sort of thing
32:13
well i do not have that
32:16
although actually in fairness i went to
32:18
this museum so this laco museum they
32:20
have an annex for erotic pottery
32:26
erotary
32:28
uh there's also if you can't get down to
32:30
lima there's a really good article on
32:31
traveler.com about that annex
32:33
entitled 50 shades of clay
32:39
superb but these pots um they're in the
32:42
museum they're under different like um
32:44
categories like netflix kind of and um
32:46
there's
32:47
the union of animals fruits and deities
32:50
um sexual activity of the dead um
32:53
it's not a netflix category
32:57
do you have that special thing on your
32:59
netflix it doesn't let you watch those
33:01
yeah um intercourse between animals and
33:04
that includes
33:05
frogs mice dogs llamas monkeys and ears
33:07
of corn
33:11
wow they're in that museum they have a
33:13
part of a man
33:14
receiving oral sex that they call in the
33:16
museum the bill clinton pot
33:22
yeah they were such an advanced
33:24
civilization the montre
33:27
incredible they are when these are
33:29
referred to they're always referred to
33:30
as sex pots and this is
33:32
in like archaeological papers and they
33:34
talk about the marche sex pots and you
33:36
can't take it seriously at
33:37
all crossover crossover oh my god it's a
33:40
crossover crossover
33:41
yeah yeah what they can do what they're
33:42
gonna do how they're gonna get it
33:43
together oh
33:45
yeah so the mache are really
33:49
okay so where were we guys anna you were
33:52
just telling me i don't know
33:52
james was three months ago you were
33:55
telling us about sex pots
33:57
oh sex pots uh yes but actually i wanted
34:00
to move on now to talk about knocking
34:02
hats off
34:02
can we do that this is a fact about
34:04
knocking hats off that's right yeah
34:05
right um
34:06
so i was looking into the history of
34:08
that
34:09
an easy thing to research and i found
34:11
out that 200 years ago in the ottoman
34:13
empire if you knocked off someone's
34:14
turban it was punishable by death
34:16
wow and i discovered this because i was
34:19
reading an account in 1799
34:21
of a christian who was taken to court
34:23
because they were accused of
34:24
knocking off a muslim's turban and the
34:27
christian's explanation
34:28
which seemed to be believed by the court
34:30
was that the muslim had been wearing a
34:31
blue turban which looked exactly like
34:33
the turban
34:34
that his friend usually wore so he said
34:35
he'd knocked it off as a prank cause he
34:37
thought it was his mate and then the guy
34:38
had turned around and it wasn't
34:39
and in fact he ended up getting off
34:41
scot-free and the judge ended up
34:43
punishing the muslim
34:44
for wearing a blue turban when he was
34:46
supposed to be wearing a green one i
34:47
know that's cool i got a couple of hat
34:48
things
34:49
just very quickly on george orwell's
34:51
110th birthday
34:52
it was celebrated in a little dutch town
34:55
by uh
34:56
these artists putting little hats on
34:58
every single cctv camera
35:00
around there uh apparently it's it's
35:01
loaded just to make them look cute
35:03
just to sort of show how his vision has
35:05
come true basically from the book
35:07
i don't remember the hats being in the
35:09
book it was the unedited on a bridge
35:12
yeah the party version it's those hats
35:14
you get on innocent smoothie bottles
35:16
they came originally
35:17
from 1984 cctv it's very sweet yeah
35:20
uh here's another one um paw patrol the
35:23
cartoon for kids don't know if you guys
35:25
know it no no
35:26
massive cartoon it's it's ginormous
35:28
you're backing me up right it's
35:29
ginormous
35:30
um they had to who you talking to
35:34
i was i was pretending a wellington the
35:35
audience member was here
35:37
am i right guys it's massive there we go
35:40
one came back with us uh yeah poor
35:43
patrol um they had to recall
35:45
a firefighting hat that they had because
35:47
it turned out it was a fire hazard
35:49
yeah really yeah so uh yeah
35:52
[Music]
35:54
okay it's time for our final fact to the
35:56
show and that's my fact
35:58
my fact nine weeks ago is that
36:01
pseudonyms that elton john has used when
36:03
checking into a hotel
36:05
include sir binky poodle clip judas fart
36:09
and the marquee of minge you did that
36:12
last time
36:13
what it's it's marquis because a marquee
36:17
is a big tent where you have weddings
36:18
and stuff and a marquee of mint is a
36:20
completely different thing i think
36:21
[Music]
36:23
i seem to remember the audience in
36:25
wellington thought that was quite
36:26
amusing
36:28
i mean i think was that an intentional
36:30
attempt to recreate the atmosphere or
36:31
have you forgotten the 10 minutes of
36:33
ribbing that you got for that
36:34
actually you'd think i'd learn i think
36:37
anyway the tent of minge the min
36:41
anyway he does this when he goes to
36:43
hotels obviously a lot of people do that
36:45
anyway celebrities like to give
36:46
themselves a pseudonym so that
36:48
uh the press can't find them and fans
36:50
can't find them when they're in town
36:51
he likes to pick these particularly
36:53
dirty ones because it actually affects
36:55
the people trying to get in touch with
36:56
him that he knows so for example
36:58
he said that his mother keeps
36:59
complaining to him saying things like i
37:01
can't believe you've asked me to ring
37:02
and ask for a sahorus
37:04
stuff like that he's also gone for sir
37:07
humphrey
37:08
handbag and bobo latrine yeah
37:11
and brian big bum nice
37:14
you say they're so dirty they're like an
37:16
eight-year-old version of dirty aren't
37:17
they
37:18
actually what i quite like as well is
37:19
that his name itself is a pseudonym
37:21
anyway
37:22
yeah he could probably go back to his
37:23
original name dwight
37:25
reginald dwight and he has a middle name
37:28
yes
37:28
is it hercules that's right yeah have
37:30
you thought elton john
37:32
and reginald dwight they're all first
37:34
names so both of his names
37:36
are those weird names where two people
37:37
have the first name yeah
37:39
yeah you're like like steve martin or
37:41
david cameron
37:42
but we can't go on doing this all day
37:44
it's really it's a fun game to play at
37:46
home is to think of people who've got
37:47
two first names but actually of all
37:48
those names i would say
37:50
elton is the least first namey of all of
37:52
them and he's chosen that as his first
37:53
name
37:53
that's true yeah you're right ben elton
37:56
bennett
37:57
yeah ben elton oh god honestly i've got
38:00
a list of about 30 which i compiled a
38:02
few years i remember
38:03
us all compiling them together i like
38:05
that you've turned this into it being
38:06
your solo project
38:08
is that how you'll remember the podcast
38:12
um just to quickly say hercules is the
38:14
middle name of his pseudonym elton john
38:15
that's
38:16
his real name i i heard that he named it
38:19
after the horse
38:20
in um that old sitcom stepped on son
38:23
but i don't know if that's true i don't
38:25
know if that's true oh wow
38:27
the middle name hercules yeah it wasn't
38:29
the horse's middle name there was it was
38:31
the horse's first and only name
38:33
he only had one name yeah in that
38:34
respect
38:36
well it might not have been he just
38:37
never know a horse's surname because
38:38
they get very little post
38:41
very good point yeah um on musical
38:43
student names
38:44
yeah elton john recorded a version of
38:46
lucy in the sky with diamonds in 1973
38:49
and john lennon played on it but lots of
38:52
the beatles when they're recording other
38:53
things they use pseudonyms
38:54
and uh john lennon's was winston obugi
38:58
nice yeah winston of course being his
39:00
middle name john lennon's middle name ah
39:03
and oh boogie being his mother's maiden
39:05
name i think yes
39:06
i always hate doing beatles facts with
39:07
dan here because he has to pretend to be
39:09
uh excited to learn it but you know that
39:11
he knows all of them
39:12
um i have a test for dan go on a beatles
39:15
test
39:16
so john lennon and paul mccartney they
39:17
only played one gig together as a double
39:19
act
39:20
it was in 1960 at a pub in caversham
39:22
what were they called
39:24
uh i can't remember they were called the
39:27
nerc twins yeah that's right
39:30
oh you should have given him more time
39:31
you should have given up so early
39:34
there were only three people drinking in
39:36
the pub and nobody nobody knew who they
39:38
were anyway so easy for you to just say
39:39
the nerc twins now
39:41
the nerc twins that's right yes
39:46
someone else who chooses funny names in
39:48
order to embarrass people
39:49
is kate beckinsale who says that she
39:52
chooses the name
39:53
sigourney beaver when she books into
39:55
hotels because she really likes
39:56
well first of all because she really
39:58
admires sigourney weaver and it's her
39:59
way of saying that which actually seems
40:00
like not a way to admire someone
40:02
and also because she says her husband
40:04
hates it when hotel employees call him
40:05
mr beaver
40:07
[Music]
40:08
which you can understand um viva isn't
40:10
the first name if you're thinking about
40:12
that no no
40:13
i get confused by this checking into
40:15
hotel's thing though because i think
40:16
they just ask you for a passport when
40:18
you check into a hotel and
40:19
no one i don't think kate beckinsale has
40:21
had a passport made up yeah
40:24
you have to give a credit card or
40:25
something don't exactly except elton
40:27
john when he does get to these hotels he
40:29
sends his pseudonym ahead and
40:30
they used to make up office stationery
40:32
for him when he arrived in the room it
40:34
would have his pseudonym on its headed
40:36
paper and so on
40:37
yeah which is quite cool so you know
40:39
yeah i think you you have to be famous
40:40
don't you so i think our personal
40:42
experience i suppose is them just
40:43
looking at your passport or credit card
40:45
but maybe if you're elton john
40:46
or john lennon they make some you know
40:49
allowances we've got
40:50
we've got a marquee coming to the hotel
40:53
better give it a big room
40:56
so i'm confused talking of passports
40:58
people seem to book flights
40:59
under pseudonyms a lot or they claim
41:02
that they do
41:02
so marilyn monroe apparently booked
41:04
flights under the name zelda zonk
41:06
again not a thing you can actually do
41:07
when you're booking a flight in my
41:08
experience could in the 50s
41:10
60s johnny depp says he does it johnny
41:13
depp claims that he's always giving
41:14
himself student names and he books loads
41:15
of tickets
41:16
i reckon that he must take private jets
41:18
right yeah isn't
41:20
johnny depp at the moment he's like
41:21
basically he spends all his money on
41:23
ridiculous things doesn't he yeah so
41:25
yeah um like he shots hunter s
41:27
thompson's ashes into space and stuff
41:29
like that yeah
41:30
so i reckon he's a private jet guy but
41:33
also actually elton john's been in
41:34
trouble for spending too much money
41:36
hasn't he has he
41:37
uh he was suing um he was suing someone
41:40
um
41:40
for not looking after his expenses
41:42
properly and
41:43
in that court case they said that he
41:45
spent 40 million pounds over a 20-month
41:47
period
41:48
including 293 000 pounds on flowers
41:52
wow that's a lot of flowers isn't it and
41:54
they asked him in court they said do you
41:56
have any reason to think that these
41:57
figures are inaccurate
41:58
and elton john said probably not and he
42:01
said really
42:02
293 000 pounds on flowers alone is that
42:05
even possible
42:06
and elton john said yes i like flowers
42:10
fair enough he knows his own mind um
42:12
chekhov used to write under pseudonyms
42:14
when he submitted short stories and he
42:15
had really good ones so he
42:16
submitted stories to magazines with
42:18
names that included man without a spleen
42:21
which was his most common so he wrote
42:23
119 short stories
42:25
under the name man without a spleen he
42:27
also was doctor without patience and my
42:29
brother's brother
42:30
for no particular reason he was a doctor
42:32
wasn't he he was a doctor yeah yeah
42:34
i wonder if he took his own spleen out
42:35
to make him run faster because that's
42:37
the thing isn't it
42:38
if you take your spleen out you run
42:39
faster it's not a common thing is it
42:42
but it is a fact that james had been
42:43
trying to get into the podcast for the
42:45
last
42:45
six months i think i said it i'm not
42:47
sure i think he did i think he crowbared
42:49
it in this fact as well in wellington
42:52
well i have a fact i didn't say in the
42:54
wellington show actually
42:55
this is about musical pseudonyms and
42:57
musical doubles so have you heard of the
42:59
band of zombies they're big
43:00
60s and they're not really big anymore
43:03
but they only became famous two years
43:04
after they broke up
43:06
so that was pro yeah the song was time
43:07
of the season that went really big for
43:09
them
43:09
but they didn't know they were famous in
43:11
the usa because they were british band
43:12
and communications were much worse then
43:14
so there was a band from dallas who just
43:16
pretended to be the zombies and went on
43:17
tour
43:18
as the zombies very successfully and
43:21
then bizarrely in 1969 there were two
43:23
separate bands touring america as the
43:25
zombies
43:26
being managed by a proper record label
43:27
at everything and the fake zombies they
43:30
had a training team you think that the
43:31
fake zombies bit
43:32
the other guys and they became fake
43:33
zombies
43:36
that's amazing i know nobody notices the
43:38
lead singer was the wrong sex
43:40
as in just completely different sex from
43:42
the actual the actual british zombies
43:44
ever go to america are
43:46
i don't know i don't know amazing um
43:49
yeah
43:49
bizarre do you know the person who's
43:51
acted in more
43:52
plays than anyone else and this is
43:54
related to pseudonyms
43:56
um is it garrick no is it someone who's
43:59
got a lot of pseudonyms
44:00
uh it's actually a pseudonym not a
44:02
person oh
44:04
is it like alan smithy or something it's
44:07
george spelvin so this is a name that's
44:09
it's a credit that's been going on since
44:11
1886 which is that if you're in a play
44:13
if you're doing a performance the a
44:14
you're too embarrassed to be credited
44:15
for
44:16
um because it doesn't suit your
44:17
reputation or sometimes if you're
44:19
playing two roles in the same play and
44:20
in the program you don't want to give
44:22
away
44:22
that you're that person as well you call
44:24
yourself george spelvin
44:26
and it's been happening yeah since 1882
44:28
and there are various different
44:30
ones in different countries so it's
44:31
giorgio spelvino in an italian play
44:34
it's when it's french
44:37
and yes brilliant the last one the last
44:40
case actually was in 1988 in
44:42
edwin drude the dictatory character
44:44
which we talked about that musical
44:46
the edwin drew musical oh yeah oh cool
44:49
that's so weird because the allen smithy
44:50
thing
44:50
goes on post-production so just to
44:52
explain that is the same thing but with
44:54
movies right exactly and it usually is
44:56
for screenwriters when the screenwriter
44:58
hates the fact that it's been rewritten
45:00
so much they want their name off it and
45:01
alan smith is in its place
45:03
but again that's post-production usually
45:04
whereas this sounds like
45:06
yeah you're in the moment embarrassed of
45:08
the thing that you're yeah and all the
45:10
rest of the cast are going oh really
45:11
[Laughter]
45:13
actually um well never mind
45:23
[Laughter]
45:28
which nationality will he go for
45:33
um so um things in hotels
45:36
like what you can ask for yeah um i saw
45:39
a website where they asked a lot of
45:40
people who worked in hotels and there
45:42
was someone in seattle
45:44
who they had someone who came to the
45:46
hotel who asked for a pillow fort and
45:48
apparently this happens quite a lot
45:50
um but these guys as well as a pillow
45:52
thought they wanted a towel folded in
45:53
the shape of an elephant
45:55
and if possible a sexy picture of some
45:57
fruit on the night table
46:01
don't do it they sure did how did they
46:04
make the fruit sexy was it carving or
46:06
was it positioning
46:08
you think it's just a banana and two
46:12
plums
46:14
i don't know they didn't say what it was
46:17
it's a shame
46:17
so much opportunity to be creative there
46:21
um just on names there's a guy who's
46:23
written a dictionary of surnames i think
46:24
a couple of years ago he's called
46:26
patrick hanks
46:27
and he looked into the most likely
46:28
meanings for surnames and do you know
46:29
what shakespeare probably meant
46:32
uh some just like literally shaking a
46:34
spear
46:36
yes you're gonna get there um someone in
46:39
a battle
46:40
oh you've gone the wrong direction it
46:42
was a medieval term for masturbator
46:44
oh i was so far away shaking a spear i
46:47
felt like you'd pick the right direction
46:49
for once you went highbrow
46:51
[Laughter]
46:52
wow is that right yeah probably from an
46:55
obscene
46:56
medieval term for masturbation was it
46:57
still known as was it still
46:59
known that meaning when shakespeare was
47:02
writing his place
47:03
uh he's not clear but it could well be
47:05
that yeah you'd go and see romeo and
47:06
juliet by the
47:07
great masturbator he would have worked
47:10
it out he was a great linguist
47:12
he would have yeah he would have because
47:13
he was always doing little double
47:15
entendres and stuff wasn't it that's
47:16
true he was
47:17
yeah there are some very rude ones i
47:20
won't repeat them now
47:22
but does that mean one of his
47:24
great-great-great-great grandfathers
47:26
was a masturbator is that what we're
47:28
saying yeah as a job i guess
47:30
[Laughter]
47:34
smith is blacksmith masturbator's
47:36
masturbation
47:39
the medieval high street for the smithy
47:42
the bakery the masturbatorium
47:46
it's very sad we used to have three
47:48
masterpieces on this street
47:51
they will become charity
47:53
now
47:55

episode of fish before we get going
00:18
just want to let you know thank you for
00:20
all your feedback about last week's
00:21
ultimate crossover episode
00:23
uh it was very enjoyable to do in fact
00:25
so much so we've decided to do it again
00:27
except this time we've decided to cross
00:29
over completely
00:31
a full crossover a 360 crossover
00:34
done we messed up again didn't we we
00:37
lost an entire episode
00:41
somehow so if you were in bristol a few
00:44
months ago
00:45
quite a few months ago you will have
00:46
seen an amazing show guys i gotta tell
00:48
you this was one of the best shows we
00:49
ever did
00:50
unfortunately it doesn't seem like we
00:52
recorded it so only you bristolians will
00:54
have the memory of that show
00:56
and then this is kind of the lesser
00:58
version yeah you say
00:59
yeah oh it's still worth listening to i
01:01
would say yeah it's it's definitely one
01:03
for the completists i'd say
01:05
yes yeah it's amazing how negative you
01:08
guys are we haven't even regarded it yet
01:11
so enjoy this week's episode here we go
01:15
hello and welcome to another episode of
01:18
no such thing as a fish
01:19
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
01:21
qi offices in covent garden
01:23
my name is dan schreiber and i'm sitting
01:25
here with andrew hunter murray
01:27
james harkin and anna chazinski and once
01:30
again we have gathered around the
01:31
microphones with our four
01:32
favorite facts from the last seven days
01:35
and in no particular order
01:36
here we go starting with you andy
01:40
okay my fact is it's about bristol
01:42
actually i just chose it completely at
01:44
random
01:44
out of all the cities i could have
01:45
chosen uh and i learned it about four
01:47
months ago
01:48
shortly before we performed in bristol
01:50
my fact this week is
01:52
that the first hot air balloon flight in
01:54
bristol was indoors
01:57
and people at home have to imagine the
01:59
cheers and laughter of the bristol crowd
02:01
when they first heard that they went
02:02
nuts when andy said that
02:04
my god um so there's this foam in
02:06
bristol called cameron balloons and it's
02:08
the world's biggest
02:09
balloon firm basically bristol is the
02:10
capital of hot air ballooning
02:12
pretty much in the world definitely in
02:13
the uk yep uh and the first flight was
02:16
in 1784
02:17
and you had to go indoors to see it and
02:20
you had to pay a little amount to see it
02:22
and if you paid more apparently you
02:23
could see it filled up with air
02:24
apparently it was a writing structure
02:26
wait a minute so the people who didn't
02:28
pay much they just saw a load of canvas
02:30
i i it sounds like that doesn't it i
02:32
can't quite believe that's true was this
02:34
new to people at the time
02:35
as in how long did balloons exist before
02:39
this happened that's a great question
02:41
really good question so they had
02:43
the aztecs they had um
02:46
they made like balloons out of animal
02:49
intestines
02:50
i think we know that um and i remember
02:52
reading once that they made balloon
02:54
animals out of those intestines
02:57
but i don't know if that doesn't sound
02:58
very true does it so
03:00
i mean how big were the animals back
03:02
then what do you mean did they make like
03:04
a full hot air balloon out of an animal
03:05
no no no
03:06
sorry so just balloons in general i'm
03:08
saying about the history of not the
03:09
history of hot tub
03:12
yeah and the civil war they definitely
03:14
had hot air balloons because
03:15
lincoln had a hot air balloon balloon
03:17
corp uh corpse
03:19
cool of course yeah why did i say corpse
03:21
core just keep throwing guesses at the
03:23
letters that you see
03:24
of course uh
03:27
yeah he had a balloon core and um they
03:29
had seven balloons and they used to go
03:31
over and uh
03:32
the confederates actually tried to build
03:34
their own balloons in retaliation and
03:36
then they stopped doing them because
03:37
people found them really easy to shoot
03:38
was it was quite an easy target so we
03:40
know it goes back as far as a civil war
03:42
in america at least yeah they were
03:44
actually a huge deal in the 19th century
03:46
hot air balloon flights
03:47
and i think uh in 1897 there was an
03:50
attempt to reach the north pole by
03:51
balloon that was three swedish people
03:53
who tried to get there
03:54
they disappeared no one knew what
03:55
happened to them there were these
03:56
reports of silk falling from the sky
03:58
and then randomly in 1930 33 years later
04:01
they were found in this thaw
04:02
by whalers just by chance they found as
04:05
the thor came
04:06
uh these the bodies of these guys and
04:08
they'd crashed after three days
04:09
but they'd lived on these ice floes and
04:11
they'd eaten polar bears
04:13
for wow that is hardcore yeah
04:16
i reckon i reckon i'd go hungry before i
04:18
decided to go
04:21
it was so sad though because they were
04:22
convinced that they could steer their
04:23
balloon over the north pole
04:25
um and it was partly funded by alfred
04:27
nobel their attention
04:29
yeah and but unfortunately the drag
04:31
ropes didn't work very well and in a few
04:33
minutes they fell off so they had no way
04:34
of steering
04:35
so they lost lots of ballast and they
04:37
kept on just bumping along the ground
04:39
and leaking a bit and then rising a bit
04:41
and it took them 65 hours to to land and
04:43
they didn't get to the stores in time so
04:45
what's that
04:45
the other thing about eating polar bears
04:47
is their livers contain so much vitamin
04:49
a that they're poisonous
04:51
yeah that's awful if you're diving
04:52
vitamin a poisoning once you've survived
04:54
the hot air balloon crash onto an ice
04:56
blower and then fought a polar bear to
04:58
death with
04:58
their hands this is quite cool about
05:02
hot air balloons so um usually you're
05:04
not allowed to fly in
05:05
in rain and so so there's it's all
05:07
weather dependent isn't it if anyone
05:08
tries to fly
05:09
they can't actually fly in wet weather i
05:11
guess it's just not recommended
05:12
but when you do fly in wet weather um
05:15
the rain gets caught in
05:16
and actually goes over the people inside
05:19
the basket so it makes its way into the
05:20
uh
05:22
but because of the flames it comes down
05:24
like a hot shower
05:25
so it's really it's really warm water
05:27
that drops on them that's
05:28
nice yeah that's very cool yeah um have
05:31
you heard of splash and dash
05:32
while we're talking about water and hot
05:34
air ballooning splash and dash is a cool
05:36
thing you can do if you have a hot air
05:37
balloon
05:38
is where you sink just low enough to dip
05:40
your toes into a lake
05:41
and then climb up again oh cool it's
05:43
pretty risky how do you get your turtles
05:44
below the bottom of the basket well
05:46
there is a there is a trend
05:48
for ballooning with no basket these days
05:50
one you have a
05:51
sofa you have a sofa what yeah no
05:54
no i've never said that was not it's not
05:57
very common
05:58
it's a trend though it's a trend you
06:01
serious people can go up in the sofa do
06:03
you think
06:03
you can i think i think it's really
06:06
recommended that you
06:09
i don't know though because i've never
06:10
fallen off my sofa that's true
06:12
i mean i don't know you look to me like
06:16
the kind of guy who wouldn't
06:17
attack the things that are easy to kind
06:19
of sail that's true yeah not if it's
06:21
swinging in high winds from a balloon
06:23
that's a thousand feet up
06:25
yeah i don't have belts on my sofa so i
06:27
think mine wouldn't wouldn't be safe
06:29
i've had belts fitted to all my surfaces
06:31
at home just in case and they've saved
06:33
my life on countless occasions
06:36
uh well speaking of no baskets for a hot
06:38
air balloon have you heard
06:39
of um they're called smoke hot air
06:42
balloons
06:43
it was a it was a carnival attraction
06:44
that used to happen so this is during
06:46
the
06:47
1800s and there's footage that you can
06:48
see of this online and it's honestly
06:50
incredible this was a
06:51
daredevil thing so what they would do is
06:55
daredevils would attach themselves by a
06:57
rope
06:58
to an inflating hot air balloon with no
07:00
baskets is simply the balloon
07:02
so the balloon would completely fill up
07:04
they would untether it and it would
07:06
rock it off into the sky and these
07:08
people would just be dragged behind it
07:10
on the end of the ropes and would fly up
07:12
after it
07:13
and when they got to a certain height
07:14
they would uh
07:16
loosen themselves from the rope fall
07:18
down and parachute back to earth
07:21
absolutely incredible you see them lob
07:22
up these people they're surrounded by
07:24
people in the videos and they just
07:26
go and disappear off into the air but
07:28
you have to loosen yourself up before it
07:29
gets too high presumably yeah i think
07:31
you
07:31
obviously know when it's you've had
07:33
enough okay yeah
07:34
i thought you were going to say they
07:36
shot the balloon down
07:38
why um i didn't because i didn't
07:42
imagine that they had a parachute on
07:43
when you were describing it so i was
07:44
thinking how would i get myself out of
07:46
this one
07:46
yeah and i would have my first choice
07:49
would have been a gun instead of a
07:50
parachute
07:53
what one item do you want to take with
07:55
you
07:57
um i read a brilliant account uh this is
07:59
actually the sources from 1838 but it
08:01
was about something that happened in
08:02
1785
08:03
and it was when jean-pierre blanchard
08:05
who was one of the first people to go up
08:06
in hot air balloon went up he went 6 000
08:09
feet up and then he dropped from his hot
08:11
air balloon a dog attached to a
08:13
parachute
08:14
uh just to kind of see what would happen
08:16
and this whirlwind apparently
08:18
swept the dog away above the clouds so
08:20
it kind of disappeared
08:22
and blondeshard is in his balloon this
08:24
is what the account says handed down
08:26
through the ages
08:27
um blanchard was in his balloon and he
08:29
met the dog
08:30
who was in his parachute above the
08:32
clouds this is rubbish do you remember
08:33
that thing that dad taught us
08:35
about the loot the loop guy yeah which
08:38
is true out of his
08:39
during a loop of the loop and then fell
08:40
back into it once it had finished doing
08:42
that yeah so he was upside down
08:44
he fell down he thought he was doomed
08:46
but his plane which was mid loop the
08:48
loop met him
08:49
at the bottom so do you remember how
08:50
obviously false that was look your thing
08:52
sounds similar dance defies physics
08:55
mine imagine a really small dog like a
08:57
little terrier with a parachute in high
08:59
winds
08:59
it could be swept away into the clouds
09:01
and then old blonde shards saw his dog
09:03
above the clouds who barked with joy
09:05
apparently saying his master
09:07
he tried to grab him and they both had
09:08
landed 12 minutes later
09:10
separately after which the dog ran away
09:12
when you say butts with jai do you not
09:14
mean backed in absolute terror
09:16
like why the did you just drop me
09:18
out of that balloon mate he then
09:19
himself with joy
09:24
um ben franklin patented a balloon
09:26
related thing like he painted it
09:27
everything else
09:28
he patented a refrigerator that tethered
09:31
to a balloon and it was meant to lift
09:32
food up into where the air was cool
09:34
and that's how you'd refrigerate your
09:36
food i have heard of that before yeah
09:38
yeah
09:38
it's so cool it's inconvenient though it
09:40
is if you're going for a late night
09:41
snack
09:42
yes but all you have to do is pull it
09:44
down you just kind of
09:45
winch it back down yeah you get your
09:47
food out and then you let it go back up
09:48
again again
09:49
i was thinking of shooting it down
09:53
these eggs are broken again
09:57
[Applause]
10:02
okay it is time for fact number two and
10:04
that is chozinski
10:06
my fact this week is that in rage rooms
10:08
where people pay to smash things up
10:10
the things people want to smash up the
10:11
most are printers
10:14
yeah they hate them they hate printers
10:16
so rage rooms are these things that are
10:18
kind of popping up all over the place uh
10:20
quite a few of them in america and in
10:21
canada where you pay to go
10:23
and you can either smash up their
10:25
possessions so they provide a bunch of
10:27
stuff
10:27
or you can bring your own stuff and
10:29
they're becoming increasingly popular
10:31
better to do with someone else's stuff
10:32
right well i think it depends how much
10:34
you just like that person if you dislike
10:36
your own stuff a lot
10:37
yeah why did you buy it then i know but
10:39
let's say you've got a pen that you
10:40
really don't like
10:40
you're not going to smash up a pen um
10:43
that is the most rage room
10:45
attendant i've ever seen
10:46
you turning up with one virus
10:51
leaking i do i do it really
10:53
psychologically though i put it in a
10:54
chair and then i shine a light in its
10:56
nib i'd ask a lot of questions before i
10:59
beat it up
11:00
[Laughter]
11:01
i'm holding a pen i'm sorry i've got a
11:04
poor imagination
11:05
i love at the end of the hour you come
11:07
up slightly beat up somehow
11:11
just go stuff drawn on his face
11:15
[Laughter]
11:20
um but no this is the thing if you go
11:21
through the rage room sites there's
11:23
there's
11:23
one called battle sports in toronto that
11:25
says it goes through 15 printers a week
11:27
um the same
11:28
in new york and the fragment room in
11:30
singapore they all say
11:31
printers are our most sought after
11:33
object we need to provide lots of them
11:34
people want to break them up
11:36
i like those um in america in new york
11:38
there's the wrecking club
11:39
and the wrecking club it has you know
11:41
you can get packages that you can buy so
11:43
i want it all it's a package you can get
11:45
which is 149.
11:47
um you can even buy gift certificates
11:49
for people so you know birthday presents
11:51
go for an hour in the raid room they
11:53
should have called it the breakfast club
11:54
yes they should have very nice why
11:56
didn't they yeah yeah we should start
11:58
our own
11:59
pens only yeah so uh what's nice about
12:03
this is it's the same
12:04
obviously like every rage room you go in
12:06
and you destroy stuff but what i
12:08
particularly like is when they started
12:09
um there was a guy who who runs it
12:11
called mr daley
12:12
um or dally d-a-l-y bailey he's called
12:15
tom daley i think actually who is he
12:16
it's the tom daley
12:17
so um he when he was in there and they
12:19
say this was an early setback
12:20
he was in the room showing a couple of
12:22
all the things that
12:24
they could do via his laptop of video
12:26
and then he left the room but he
12:27
accidentally left the laptop in there
12:28
yeah they smashed it up
12:31
yeah so he came back in the eddy was
12:32
like oh and he didn't tell them because
12:34
he thought
12:34
i don't want to ruin their experience
12:35
but he as of then started labeling
12:37
everything as don't smash this i went on
12:39
the wikipedia for
12:40
rage rooms uh but i did it about four
12:43
months ago so it might have been changed
12:44
by now
12:45
um but they said that the concept of an
12:47
anger room is at least 20
12:49
at least 2 000 years old is it
12:52
yeah well that's what wikipedia says and
12:54
who are we to doubt them
12:55
what did they say they say it was queen
12:57
kaikei
12:59
um who in an old book was said that she
13:01
was going to at the palace anger room
13:03
uh and actually it was a sulking chamber
13:05
when i looked it up
13:06
that's how it's usually translated
13:08
apparently it was like a dark room where
13:10
you would lie down
13:11
and sulk yeah so i'm not really
13:14
i do like the sound of that though yeah
13:16
yeah yeah because people manifest
13:17
their rage manifest differently doesn't
13:19
it some people just want to lie down in
13:21
the dark and be really pissed off with
13:22
the world
13:23
some of us like to smash our ex's stuff
13:26
actually the most
13:28
the most i say that because i think the
13:30
most common thing for people who do
13:32
bring in
13:32
their own things are people who've had a
13:34
breakup and they bring in all their ex's
13:35
old stuff
13:36
this is what the toronto place said so
13:38
it said for 20 extra you can bring your
13:40
own stuff to smash
13:41
and the founder said that um by far in a
13:43
way the most common thing to do is to
13:44
bring in your ex's stuff and he said the
13:46
people often come in and you'll hear
13:47
them
13:48
screaming and shouting in their things
13:49
like oh you think you're so good
13:51
argh and then you'll hear a smash or you
13:54
think you're always right i think that's
13:55
pronounced ah
13:58
how do you pronounce how do you spell
13:59
arg then is it without the h
14:01
i don't think there is a word who says
14:03
pirates
14:04
no they don't they go oh yeah
14:08
we've we've not been hearing the end of
14:10
their sentences
14:12
one of the first ones that was set up in
14:14
dallas in 2011 by a lady called donna
14:16
alexander
14:17
and she just started charging five
14:18
dollars to smash things that she
14:20
collected from kerbs
14:21
in the area okay she sort of picked it
14:23
up so it was very ad hoc at the
14:24
beginning
14:25
and then she'd get people knocking on
14:26
her door kind of like a fight club
14:28
saying
14:28
is this where you go to smash stuff up
14:30
and her insurer had to invent an
14:32
entirely new category just for her
14:34
oh very exciting yeah and what do you
14:36
mean by just picking stuff up
14:38
like as in light tipping you know when
14:40
people yeah leave things out exactly fly
14:42
tipping like leave an old fridge out or
14:44
a drop a lot of pens that they don't
14:46
want anymore because they're faulty
14:48
uh that kind of thing that's really cool
14:50
yeah
14:52
um stuff on printers oh yeah i was
14:54
reading about printer jams
14:56
and everyone finds them very annoying
14:58
apart from people who work in printers
15:00
who find them really exciting
15:02
they say it's the it's the it's the
15:06
elemental struggle between the natural
15:07
and the mechanical because paper is made
15:09
out of trees
15:10
and printers are made out of metal and
15:12
and plastic
15:14
i think the ultimate challenge is
15:16
throwing a dog with a parachute out of a
15:18
hot air balloon
15:19
and then catching it again do you guys
15:22
know about the first printer ever to go
15:23
into space
15:24
no uh this was a printer that was sent
15:27
up on the iss
15:28
in 1998. sorry this was the first color
15:30
printer
15:31
ever to go into space
15:35
it was sent up in 1998 with a discovery
15:37
mission
15:38
and it was used solely to make halloween
15:40
masks
15:41
so it was sent up it was kind of a
15:43
secret thing so john glenn who is by
15:44
then a senator was on that mission
15:46
but he'd been the third person i think
15:49
to orbit the earth in 1962
15:51
and so he was his big space hero by that
15:54
point and so
15:55
on that 1998 mission the whole crew
15:57
printed colour portraits of him off this
15:58
floppy disk
15:59
and they made these portraits into
16:00
halloween masks and then they all went
16:02
around pretending to be john glenn in a
16:03
nod
16:04
to his greatness cool i'd print out a
16:07
full alien costume
16:08
and then cello tape it to myself and
16:10
then freak my crewmates out
16:11
do you think they'd fall for that
16:13
because i don't think anyone was
16:14
floating around going oh my god it's
16:15
junk glenn oh my gosh
16:17
oh my god then that's true
16:26
okay it is time for fact number three
16:29
and that is my fact
16:30
my fact this week is one of the first
16:32
things that mcdonald's founder ray kroc
16:35
did when he bought the baseball team
16:37
san diego padres was to sign a player
16:39
called
16:40
big mac very good did he do it because
16:43
he was the founder of mcdonald's or was
16:45
he just a good baseball big mac was a
16:46
great baseball player
16:47
uh willie mccovey was his real name um
16:50
he was he was a very good player and
16:52
obviously ray kroc who
16:54
built mcdonald's from a very tiny
16:56
brother
16:57
operation of the mcdonald brothers into
16:59
the global successor it was had an eye
17:01
for
17:02
uh franchising for merchandising for
17:03
commercialization he saw that by getting
17:05
big mac in he could do a lot of
17:07
cross-promotion
17:08
uh so for example during the first
17:10
season uh they did big mac sundays
17:13
uh so the idea would be that you could
17:14
take a ticket stub and get a free big
17:16
mac
17:17
uh after a match if the padres had won
17:20
unfortunately when the promotion started
17:22
they lost 11 straight home games
17:23
and uh so as a result they had to change
17:25
it to whether they win or lose
17:29
yeah they were terrible weren't they
17:30
when he first took over yeah
17:32
was there not a thing about him shouting
17:34
at them on the pitch or something yeah
17:36
the first match um he went he was very
17:38
excited because
17:39
the idea of him signing this new player
17:41
and the fact that ray kroc had taken
17:43
over he got the attendance right up
17:45
um they for their opener uh they drew
17:48
39 000 people but they totally sucked in
17:51
the match and as a result he went into
17:53
the booth where the commentators were
17:54
commentating on the match took over the
17:56
tannoy
17:57
and he uh he said i have good news and
18:00
bad news the good news is that the
18:01
dodgers drew
18:02
31 000 for their opener and we've drawn
18:04
39 000 for ours
18:06
the bad news is that this is the most
18:08
stupid baseball playing i have ever seen
18:10
he said that to the players heard the
18:13
fans and the friends cheered they loved
18:15
it they loved that he was being honest
18:16
um and then someone ran on this on the
18:18
field a streaker
18:19
and uh he yelled get that streaker off
18:21
the field throw him in jail he was just
18:23
he was just commenting to the whole
18:25
stadium of 39 000 people his thoughts
18:27
was amazing he was angry
18:30
yeah just before we did this show in
18:32
bristol
18:33
the night before i or the day before i
18:35
watched um the founder
18:37
for research for this which is a really
18:39
good film about ray kroc
18:41
uh but i can't remember any of it now
18:44
sorry
18:44
the only thing i remember is that when
18:46
the brothers who founded mcdonald's so
18:48
this is not ray crock
18:50
their idea was called the method i think
18:53
and they
18:54
worked out the size of their kitchen and
18:56
where everything went so it was the most
18:58
efficient possible way of running a
18:59
kitchen
19:00
and the way they did it is they went to
19:01
a tennis court and they had chalk
19:03
and they drew all the different
19:05
possibilities and they got people hide
19:07
people on
19:08
for very little money to try out
19:10
pretending to cook all these burgers
19:12
pretending to do milkshakes pretending
19:13
to do fries uh until they got the exact
19:16
one and they did this for days and days
19:18
they eventually found the right one and
19:20
then that night
19:21
it rained and all of their chalk marks
19:24
got washed away
19:24
and they had to do the whole experiment
19:27
the whole sort of the design of the
19:29
kitchen right like the choreography
19:30
that's very cool
19:31
oh wow do you know that ray kroc was in
19:33
the same red cross company in the first
19:35
world war driving ambulances as walt
19:37
disney
19:38
wow yeah they both went on to be very
19:41
successful
19:42
in their own ways
19:43
[Laughter]
19:45
and they both lied about their age to
19:46
get in oh really yeah really
19:48
he had a really weird relationship with
19:50
his wife didn't he did he joan crock
19:52
so she crook suddenly becomes a funnier
19:55
surname
19:58
so i think first of all there they were
20:00
married when he said he wanted to buy
20:02
the padres and she said is that a
20:03
monastery
20:04
um and then it seems like they must have
20:07
had some tensions because first of all
20:09
she launched an alcoholism charity
20:11
called operation
20:12
cork which is croc his name spelled
20:14
backwards
20:15
um and she used to produce tv dramas
20:17
about the impact of alcoholism on
20:19
families because i think he was an
20:20
alcoholic
20:21
so she said she raised awareness about
20:22
that but also
20:24
when he died in 1984 she immediately
20:26
gave away the estate
20:28
and distributed all the money to all
20:29
these like some great charities
20:31
and also she gave a million dollars to
20:34
the democratic party
20:35
which is a slap in the face because ray
20:37
kroc was a massive republican he'd given
20:39
like a quarter of a million to nixon's
20:41
re-election campaign
20:42
so yeah she was she sort of undid
20:46
his legacy in some ways and she was
20:47
amazing for the baseball team as well
20:49
because after he passed away she took
20:50
over but she knew virtually nothing
20:52
about baseball but in that first season
20:54
after she took over her team made it to
20:56
the world series
20:57
well it sounds like she knew a lot about
20:58
baseball unlike her husband
21:01
she learned yeah she learned on the go
21:02
yeah he definitely didn't like it he at
21:04
one point after
21:05
the padres had lost 102 games said i
21:08
bought the team to have some fun
21:09
but it's proving to be about as
21:10
enjoyable as awake your own
21:13
that was his uh public comment about his
21:15
own team
21:16
um your guy called big mac yeah uh i
21:19
went on the internet and searched for
21:21
some other names of
21:22
baseball players and i found that there
21:24
was a guy called thomas lewis fries
21:27
and another one called philip douglas
21:29
coke
21:30
so you can have big mac fries
21:34
um some other players cannonball tit
21:36
comb
21:38
jolly dick shot lovely his nickname was
21:41
ugly so people called him ugly dick shot
21:44
uh and wonderful mounds is a good name
21:47
isn't that nice
21:48
wonderful sorry is that that's a
21:49
nickname surely his first name was
21:51
wonderful his second name was terrific
21:53
what no wonderful terrific actually
21:56
wonderful mons
21:58
okay yeah i mean it wasn't the surname
22:00
that i was quibbling
22:03
wonderful terrific ones that's a good
22:05
name lovely
22:06
well there's a guy in basketball called
22:08
meta world peace um
22:10
that's his that's his name he's playing
22:12
for china now and he's changed his name
22:13
to panda
22:14
okay he just keeps yeah it keeps going
22:16
for name changes there's an american
22:18
footballer called lion king
22:20
king first name lion yeah oh cool that's
22:23
so good
22:23
did you know chicken mcnuggets were
22:24
almost onion mcnuggets they trialled the
22:27
two
22:27
i'm not realizing that people might
22:28
prefer chicken they almost made them
22:30
onions that might be nice like an onion
22:32
i think so or an onion ring yeah
22:34
absolutely it's like an onion ring but
22:36
it's an onion ball
22:37
yeah fine it's like an onion bhaji in
22:39
fact yeah
22:40
yeah yeah yeah there's a point
22:44
do you know there's a secret rebel
22:46
mcdonald's operating in india
22:48
uh this is very cool and you've just
22:50
blown their cover yeah well sorry guys
22:51
um
22:52
there was a big kerfuffle between
22:54
mcdonald's global
22:56
and the indian version of mcdonald's
22:57
they make chicken bargies
22:59
i don't know if they do i hope they do
23:01
they do do a thing called mcspicy paneer
23:04
which is very popular it sells out every
23:05
day but they cancel their franchise
23:07
agreement with 150 restaurants
23:09
they said oh it's not working out for
23:10
whatever reason um
23:12
and the restaurants just kept on going
23:13
selling the food right and no one's
23:15
stopped them
23:16
or intervened and they've left up the
23:18
golden arches and everything
23:19
they're still training under the
23:20
mcdonald's name yeah the arches aren't
23:22
always golden
23:23
there are a few exceptions one of which
23:26
is in sedona in arizona and they're
23:30
turquoise
23:31
why get any guesses why because the
23:33
yellowness
23:34
blends into the desert so you can't see
23:36
it no
23:37
it wasn't it was actually said it it
23:39
sort of clashed too much with it
23:41
so the opposite yeah you're the right
23:44
kind of lines uh yeah the government
23:46
said look that kind of clashes with our
23:47
desert
23:48
uh it looks silly do something else yeah
23:50
i read that the
23:51
guy who created the golden arches
23:54
uh was offered a deal very early on in
23:56
the day of a cut
23:57
of it forever on or a one-off payment
24:00
which was a very low sum
24:01
they always take the very low
24:04
they always go in and they say we'll
24:05
offer you this very low sun
24:07
offer you money for the rest of your
24:09
life and they always take it they never
24:10
even specify the low sum do they they
24:12
just say very low sum
24:22
okay it is time for our final fact of
24:24
the show and that is
24:25
james okay my fact this week is that the
24:27
yellow build oxpecker bird
24:29
sleeps in giraffes armpits so cool
24:34
nice we've known for a long time that
24:35
they kind of hang out on these
24:37
african animals like giraffe and water
24:39
buffalo and stuff like that
24:41
but they've only just found out that
24:43
they stay there overnight as well
24:45
and that comes from a multi-year camera
24:47
trap study in
24:48
tanzania serengeti national park and so
24:51
they're
24:51
putting the cameras on these animals in
24:53
the middle of the night and they found
24:54
that the birds stay there
24:56
and it seems that usually they stay
24:58
there and they have this symbiotic
25:00
relationship where they eat all the
25:01
little bugs that live in the giraffe's
25:03
armpits
25:04
and they get the protection of the
25:06
giraffe not just the armpits as well
25:09
it's the leg pits it's all the pits the
25:10
crotches across
25:12
every one of the pets so you can get up
25:14
to seven birds in a single crotch
25:18
that was that a youtube video we used to
25:20
watch in the first year of uni i think
25:26
but it's really good giraffes are great
25:28
they're great beds because they're off
25:29
the ground meaning you're a bit safer as
25:31
a bird
25:31
yeah whereas you know buffalo lie down
25:33
and they're unstable they're often
25:34
stable
25:35
well except when a giraffe sleeps
25:36
because they've been seen in the wild to
25:38
be sleeping while laying down and what
25:40
they do is
25:40
they bend around and they use their butt
25:43
as a pillow so they bring their head
25:44
right around
25:45
and rest it on the top of their back
25:47
that's i would say the best thing about
25:49
being a giraffe actually that you can do
25:51
that it must be right i mean we were the
25:52
whole kill to do that
25:53
but oxpeckers they eat their little
25:56
little animals but they also
25:57
eat the host bodily fluids including
26:00
mucus blood
26:01
and snot and even the goop that you get
26:03
in your eyes
26:04
yeah they also like to live on zebras
26:08
and i read one article um i'll just read
26:10
a bit of it
26:11
um still in its statue-like pose the
26:14
zebra raised its tail quickly and held
26:16
it out behind its body
26:17
the ox pekka immediately scuttled down
26:20
onto the hairless black shiny skin
26:22
that surrounds the zebra's anal region
26:24
and worked this area assiduously
26:28
it sounds like an extract from six birds
26:29
one crotch
26:32
oh i've got a fact about symbiotic anus
26:34
relationships
26:36
so there's a kind of leech called placo
26:39
placob de lloydi's jagasquioldi
26:43
which is a leech which lives inside
26:45
hippo anuses it spends most of its life
26:47
in fact inside the hippo's bottom
26:49
and they live for about 2.6 years so
26:52
they were covered in the new scientist
26:53
in 1995 and the headline was leech rides
26:55
the tunnel of love
26:57
because it's safe from ox peckers
26:58
actually it's safer if you go
27:00
right into the bottom and they have to
27:02
swim into a hippos bottom to have sex do
27:05
you
27:05
do they swim into it or do they just
27:07
crawl into it i think when the hippo
27:08
is underwater underwater but it has
27:11
special tools
27:12
designed to push open a hippo's
27:13
sphincter when you say
27:15
it's part of its body it's part of its
27:17
body yeah
27:19
[Laughter]
27:21
one really cool symbiotic relationship i
27:23
quite like
27:24
um crabs and urchins oh yeah so i didn't
27:27
know about this but
27:28
i hope we talk about victorian street
27:30
children here if we're not going to be
27:31
very disappointed and genital nice i
27:34
hope
27:36
of course cool blimey governor still
27:39
your crab for
27:40
farving stop scratching your crotch
27:43
dodger
27:47
no it's neither of those things it's sea
27:48
urchins and it's just crabs like normal
27:50
crabs
27:51
and um so urchins travel on the back of
27:53
crabs which is useful for them as it
27:54
means they can travel so urchins can't
27:56
travel very well otherwise see the world
27:58
exactly get out there take some photos
28:00
on that gap yeah
28:02
right so much in postcards but it's good
28:04
for the crab because they can suddenly
28:06
use it as a disguise or a weapon if they
28:08
need to
28:08
so they can sometimes get the urchin
28:10
down with their claw or face something
28:12
with the urchin and act like they've got
28:13
a really awesome spiky back
28:14
yeah wow i've got another one just while
28:16
we're on the symbiotic relationship
28:18
roll um there's an ant which is called
28:21
camponotus schmitzi
28:22
which is a great name and it only lives
28:24
on a single species of pitcher plant
28:26
you know picture plants they're the ones
28:27
that um that consume
28:30
prey by i think they fall in or they
28:31
drown yeah so it looks
28:33
like a tube yeah yeah wow um but the
28:35
ants
28:36
swim around in the digestive fluids of
28:38
the plant
28:39
they consume the nectar of the plant and
28:41
they also consume some of the prey that
28:43
the plant eats
28:44
but the plants which have ants swimming
28:46
around in their stomachs basically
28:47
get bigger than those which don't have
28:49
them because the ants keep the traps
28:51
clean
28:51
and they hunt mosquito larvae which
28:53
would otherwise soak up more nutrients
28:56
so it's beneficial to if you're a
28:57
pitcher plant to have ants in your
28:59
stomach
28:59
and the plants also eat the ants poo
29:02
nice as well as using the ants
29:04
they don't eat the ants the ants survive
29:06
in there the ants are tolerated within
29:07
the system
29:07
yeah you get some picture plants don't
29:09
you where you get little shrews who sit
29:11
on the
29:11
on the side of them and then poo into
29:13
them as like little toilets
29:16
the nitrogen of those what's what's the
29:18
benefit for the shrew because they don't
29:20
mind whether they
29:20
get a toilet you know is that enjoyable
29:23
because yeah it's because it can sit
29:24
there reading its iphone
29:26
okay that makes it beneficial you would
29:29
like you wouldn't like it if we took
29:30
away your toilet from you then
29:31
yeah but if the concept of toilets
29:33
didn't exist for us i would just poo
29:35
here
29:35
but they've now got the concept of
29:37
toilets so they have to go
29:38
i mean no animal understands the
29:43
importance of a good sewerage system
29:44
except humans
29:46
why on earth is a shrew clamping up at
29:48
the top of a flower
29:49
in order to take a right just doing
29:51
it on the ground i think what happens is
29:53
it eats something from the flour maybe
29:55
some nectar or something
29:57
yeah and that is a laxative and then
30:00
that makes it poo i believe that's true
30:02
so it almost can't get out in time it's
30:04
kind of like he's eaten something and it
30:05
sort of happens
30:06
it's like a delicious restaurant but
30:07
with very bad hygiene standards
30:10
but then they use your poo to power
30:12
their electricity oh wow where is this
30:15
restaurant
30:16
i feel a startup coming on
30:20
hey i've got something on armpits in the
30:22
19th century in austria
30:23
there used to be this thing where at
30:25
dances uh
30:26
women would carry underneath their
30:29
armpits
30:30
a single slice of apple and they would
30:32
hold it there all night long
30:34
and the idea was at the end of the night
30:35
the girl would approach someone
30:37
who they fancied a guy uh if it was a
30:40
guy that they fancied they would go up
30:41
and they would take the apple out and
30:42
they would present the app they still do
30:44
that on love island i think
30:47
so he presented to the guy and if the
30:49
guy eats it
30:50
he's saying i'm keen yeah yeah wow
30:54
and is there any way for him to say i'm
30:55
keen without eating the outfit
30:57
but i think if you're not willing to eat
30:59
the apple that's been inside the armpit
31:01
of your loved one
31:02
you don't love her at all you're not
31:03
keen enough yeah so women's armpits
31:06
smell of onion and men smell of cheese
31:08
apparently and this is
31:09
well between us we can have a delicious
31:11
bag of crisps
31:12
[Laughter]
31:14
you know those like salt and shake
31:16
crisps that you used to get where they
31:17
don't taste of anything but you have to
31:18
put your own
31:19
yeah are you proposing that you scissor
31:21
someone else's armpit i'm just saying
31:23
crisp in the middle and you'll get a
31:24
lovely cheese now i'm gonna go to an
31:26
austrian dance
31:29
i think just it doesn't cost anymore
31:30
just to buy cheese and onion rather than
31:32
just buying cheese and then wiping it up
31:34
against a woman's armpit that's true i
31:35
don't see why you would those crisps
31:37
they would used to be the same price as
31:39
ready salted crisps but you still had to
31:41
put extra work in
31:42
that's so weird it was fun yeah it was
31:44
fun but this is about compounds in their
31:46
armpits by the way this isn't just
31:47
people sniffing them and saying oh
31:49
that's oniony
31:50
this is the the compound that women's
31:52
armpits generate
31:53
is something called is a thio alcohol
31:55
which when it combines with the bacteria
31:56
smells like onion
31:57
and then men's sweat do you say alcohol
32:00
yeah but don't go
32:01
licking women's armpits for that again
32:03
it's not worth it i'll buy you a beer
32:05

hello and welcome to another episode of
00:17
no such thing as a fish
00:19
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
00:21
qi offices in current garden
00:23
my name is dad shriver and i'm sitting
00:25
here with andrew hud tabari
00:27
james harkin and alex bell and once
00:30
again we have gathered around the
00:31
microphones with our four
00:32
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:35
and in no particular order
00:36
here we go starting with you alex
00:40
my fact this week is that the swiss
00:42
flush about
00:43
two million dollars worth of gold down
00:45
the toilet every year
00:47
are they hiding it because it's nazi
00:49
gold and they're embarrassed about the
00:51
fact they have it
00:52
i haven't time to mention the nazis in
00:54
three seconds
00:58
um no this is it's lots and lots of
01:01
little tiny tiny gold particles
01:03
it's a waste uh result of the
01:05
manufacturing process of watches
01:07
they think they're not entirely sure
01:09
where it comes from all they know is
01:10
that they've been analyzing the
01:12
uh content of sewage and uh it's got a
01:14
really weirdly high percentage of gold
01:16
in it
01:16
can they collect it they're trying to
01:18
come up with a way of uh
01:20
getting it that's cost effective but at
01:21
the moment it's too expensive
01:23
how crazy that it it's costing too much
01:25
to get 1.8 million
01:27
yeah except for the gold except when you
01:28
think it like it's like tiny tiny
01:30
particles in the water so
01:31
yeah you know it's like panning for gold
01:33
can you go
01:34
there um i think that they're way too
01:37
small like it's not it's not like
01:38
planning for gold in like old times
01:39
where you had little nuggets so you
01:41
actually
01:41
just like if you have the choice of
01:43
panning for gold in a nice river in
01:44
scotland
01:45
or maybe in a load of sewage in
01:48
switzerland i know which one i choose
01:49
yeah but one definitely has gold at it
01:51
one's got 1.8 million dollars worth of
01:54
gold there's golden member mountains in
01:55
scotland
01:56
did you not see that that was in the
01:57
news about two weeks ago maybe a week
01:59
ago where they found the largest gold
02:00
nugget
02:01
ever in britain oh the guy who was
02:03
sitting in the river
02:04
i think what he does is he lies down
02:07
face down
02:08
in the water and he just kind of looks
02:10
for it
02:11
like he doesn't do that panning thing or
02:12
whatever he just kind of lies there and
02:14
waits and just tries to
02:15
see it it's nice because it's like
02:17
fishing but without the
02:19
fish yeah you just and you are the fish
02:21
in a way you're in the water
02:23
in a way what's it do we know
02:26
are you allowed to keep it if you find a
02:27
big gold nugget um i can't remember i
02:29
think
02:30
what happens is the crown estates can
02:33
claim it
02:33
the queen's allowed to eat it
02:37
is it is it if you find it on crown
02:38
estate land or is it just the queen
02:40
i think the queen is everything actually
02:42
oh man
02:43
if you find it downstairs in the you
02:45
know let's say you're rooting around in
02:47
the toilets of the qi office and
02:49
there's no reason to say that and i
02:51
don't know why you would look at me when
02:52
you're saying that well
02:53
i'm just saying like we've already
02:55
decided that that's a good place to find
02:56
gold
02:57
no rivers around here right but if you
02:59
did find some gold then technically i
03:01
think you'd have to offer it to the
03:02
queen
03:03
really i think so unfair i think the
03:05
same goes for like bottle tops if you
03:07
find them in a metal detector she's just
03:08
less interested
03:10
it's a crown made of bottle tops isn't
03:11
it all these rooms at buckingham palace
03:13
they're just full of old bottle tops
03:16
do you know there's loads of gold in
03:17
british sewers as well
03:19
but it's not from because we don't have
03:20
a luxury watch industry the same way
03:22
that the swiss do
03:23
um is about seven parts per million
03:25
which would make it economically
03:27
feasible as a gold mine as in
03:28
in a gold mine you get less than that
03:30
but the way
03:31
you get it gets into the water in
03:32
britain is from people doing the washing
03:35
up while wearing wedding rings
03:36
so tiny bits and also get this if you
03:39
brush your teeth and you've got a gold
03:41
tooth
03:42
tiny bits of gold will come off and make
03:45
their way into the water
03:46
how often would i have to do the washing
03:48
up before my wedding ring
03:49
completely disappeared from my hand it
03:51
sounds like you you're really hoping
03:53
to get out of something by doing the
03:55
washing up i can say to my wife
03:57
i can't do the washing up because then
03:59
our marriage will be annulled
04:00
uh probably several hundred years i'm
04:02
afraid okay
04:04
divorce and subsequent loss of the
04:05
wedding ring would happen much sooner as
04:07
a result
04:08
um we've got in our upcoming book we've
04:10
got an article on
04:11
the fatberg that was displayed in the
04:13
london museum this year
04:15
and what is that book then it's gonna be
04:17
called the book of the year 2018. okay
04:18
and where is it going to be available
04:20
you know places like waterstones and
04:22
online
04:23
retailers that andy doesn't allow us to
04:25
say anymore and
04:28
i do it's gonna be on amazon it's good
04:30
no you can't say that
04:33
uh sorry you were saying yeah so um so
04:35
the fatberg for anyone that doesn't know
04:37
is just a giant lump
04:38
of fat that they find in the sewers
04:40
mainly of london but they've been found
04:42
worldwide
04:43
and uh yeah they're they're ginormous it
04:46
takes some
04:46
days and days in some cases weeks to
04:49
absolutely knock them apart
04:51
uh they have to use pneumatic drills to
04:53
get them down
04:54
and uh it was made up 90 of cooking fat
04:57
that we put down our uh our drains the
05:00
others are wet wipes which is all down
05:02
to
05:03
it turns out colonel sanders and kfc kfc
05:06
effectively were the first people to let
05:09
the wet wipe
05:10
out into the public the men yeah the man
05:12
who invented the wet wipes sold it to
05:13
kfc so kfc were the original wet white
05:16
people but now they're mostly used by
05:17
parents and stuff right exactly for
05:19
children's bums yeah
05:21
they weren't used to wipe the chickens
05:22
were they
05:25
but yeah um what's interesting as well
05:27
is that they found a higher
05:28
concentration of banned
05:30
gym supplements in the fatberg than they
05:32
did say cocaine or mdma what like
05:34
steroids and things yeah
05:35
exactly so the fat burg might become
05:37
muscle burns
05:39
that's a german city i want to go to
05:41
sometime
05:43
all german cities are musselburgh yeah
05:46
very well developed people
05:50
so i found a crime from this year where
05:51
thieves used sewage to steal gold this
05:54
is clever ah
05:55
so it's in um western australia where
05:57
there are lots of gold mines
05:58
and what they did is they stole a sewage
05:59
truck and you remember sewage trucks
06:01
they have those big uh hoses and nozzles
06:02
which they can suck up
06:04
sewage with yeah and they stuck that
06:06
into a
06:07
gold mine site's big pit of um gold rich
06:10
liquid
06:11
and they suck that all up interesting
06:14
yeah didn't know they would have like
06:15
gold rich liquid i don't know how they i
06:18
don't know how the mining process works
06:19
i guess maybe if they're blasting
06:21
they sort of had this goldy soup which
06:22
they could then refine yeah and if
06:24
you're gonna leave that lying around in
06:25
a big vat labeled gold rich liquid
06:27
you're asking to be robbed really aren't
06:28
you that's like putting it in a sort of
06:30
bag with a dollar sign
06:31
it's very impressive though to steal a
06:32
sewage truck to think of that because i
06:34
would have just gone along with the
06:34
henry hoover and tried to take a little
06:36
bit
06:37
yeah i think that would be the um the
06:39
great escape level way of doing it like
06:40
going into the cleaner every day and
06:42
just like getting a little bit in your
06:43
hoover
06:43
yeah um the largest nugget of gold
06:47
ever found was called welcome stranger
06:50
okay and i say was because as soon as it
06:52
was found it was melted down
06:56
the second largest was called welcome
06:58
only welcome
06:59
uh and that was also melted down into
07:01
sovereigns but the good thing about that
07:02
is it was found by one guy with a
07:04
pickaxe
07:05
um who carried on mining after his
07:07
fellow manners had gone to lunch so they
07:08
all went away and he thought i'm gonna
07:10
carry on mining
07:11
and as soon as he saw the nugget he
07:12
fainted and then when the guys came back
07:14
from lunch they saw he was kind of face
07:16
down in the middle of the hole
07:17
and they thought he was dead and so they
07:19
climbed down to try and save him
07:21
and they saw the nugget and they fainted
07:22
as well
07:26
so it turns out the way to find nuggets
07:28
of gold is just to lay face down
07:30
that's true why the why were they called
07:32
welcome and welcome stranger that's
07:33
quite weird names for nuggets well
07:34
that's
07:35
a really good question i don't know why
07:37
they're called that i suppose
07:38
what you might say if you if you found
07:42
a nugget you might oh welcome stranger
07:44
yeah
07:46
oddly predatory way of discovering
07:49
something
07:50
the third largest is the largest extant
07:52
nugget it's called the hand of faith and
07:54
it's on display in las vegas
07:56
do you know what the netherlands are
07:57
doing with their old toilet paper but
07:59
they're old
07:59
toilet paper yeah use toilet paper
08:01
they're making it into
08:03
windmills shitty windmills oh i wish it
08:06
was that no
08:07
well they're turning it into bike lanes
08:09
so it is a similarly green
08:10
it was a similarly kind of stereotypical
08:15
are they so yeah do they collect their
08:17
paper on the side and not flush it down
08:19
is that why oh i don't know how it's
08:20
collected actually that's a really good
08:21
point
08:22
it must be it must be that it's flushed
08:23
down and they're sort of scooped out
08:25
normally buy it
08:25
i think it's scooped out because what
08:27
they do once they've got it i don't know
08:29
how they get it but they extract the
08:30
cellulose from it so you know it's tree
08:32
pulp and stuff which has a lot of
08:33
cellulose which is this tough fiber
08:35
then they sterilize it obviously and
08:36
then they turn it into big pellets which
08:38
they can
08:39
turn into asphalt but also spike lanes
08:42
are usually colored brown aren't they to
08:44
make them look different to the rest of
08:45
the road right so they probably don't
08:47
have to use any coloring yeah
08:49
a lot of skid marks as well from all the
08:50
breaking of the bikes guys
08:53
watch out for pedestrians
08:58
and yeah i'm almost certain that they
09:00
are they must be flushing them when
09:01
they're collecting the suits because
09:02
it's not like they'd be saying please
09:03
everyone put aside your used toilet
09:05
paper we'll come and guess no
09:11
because it happens in greece yeah it's
09:13
in greece really yeah a film
09:24
okay it is time for fact number two and
09:26
that is
09:27
andy my fact is that robert burns made
09:29
his own ink out of
09:30
old beer lard elephant tusk and sulfuric
09:34
acid
09:35
wow yeah that's very cool what a man i
09:38
read the source that you sent for this
09:39
and it noted that these were all things
09:40
that were readily available in scotland
09:42
at the time
09:43
yeah i mean old beer and lard obviously
09:45
but where did they get elephant tusks in
09:47
scotland
09:47
ivory i reckon big ivory trade
09:50
sure yeah i mean that's i just said
09:52
another word for the thing
09:54
[Laughter]
09:56
capitalism i guess um
10:00
yeah so i didn't know this but writers
10:02
basically had to make their own ink for
10:03
centuries you couldn't just go down to
10:04
the ink shop and buy some ink
10:06
so there are all these recipes around
10:08
and the researchers from the university
10:09
of glasgow
10:10
have analyzed really cool they took
10:13
original burns
10:14
uh poems and they lifted ink away in a
10:16
way that didn't damage the original
10:18
poems
10:18
because obviously the original
10:19
manuscripts that's amazing and i wonder
10:21
how they do that i don't know
10:23
i wish i did because you wouldn't want
10:24
to accidentally lift off a whole word no
10:27
can you forget what it is
10:31
um and and the really cool thing is
10:33
they've
10:34
found different recipes from different
10:36
uh stages of his life so when he was
10:38
young and poor
10:39
he uh used a particular kind of iron
10:41
gall ink and then as he got richer he
10:43
used this
10:43
uh thing called ivory black which
10:46
involved treacle and lard and acid and
10:47
vinegar
10:48
and ivory and and it's a way of telling
10:51
the real poems from forgeries yeah which
10:53
that's amazing isn't it they're starting
10:54
to apply this now to
10:56
all ancient manuscripts because if they
10:58
see the recipe someone uses and then
10:59
someone else
11:00
claims to have an original and it turns
11:02
out it's made from i don't know
11:03
mole and butter and sausages
11:06
it's like this is not it's not sorry
11:09
well as of the animals yeah the animal
11:10
yeah moles human moles
11:14
and sausages yeah yeah um robert burns
11:17
uh
11:17
used to have some really cool nicknames
11:19
he used to refer to himself as spunky
11:21
oh yeah yeah uh he used to call himself
11:23
the ranton rovin robin
11:25
that was one of his personal favorites
11:27
apparently but he never called himself
11:28
rabbi or robbie
11:30
which is what uh robbie burns or robbie
11:32
burns is what many people in the uk
11:34
would associate as his
11:35
nickname that we've given him yeah never
11:37
never called himself that but he's
11:38
calling himself these he's not really
11:39
nicknames yeah they're not really
11:40
nicknames if you call them yourself
11:43
no one else is calling them spunky i
11:44
don't think that counts as a nickname
11:46
that's more like an online avatar
11:54
he would have been great on twitter
11:55
wasn't it funny i think i would already
11:57
actually
11:57
tweeting really tedious things about
11:58
making your own ink yeah um
12:00
yeah these these recipes are really
12:03
weird so
12:04
there are lots of uh recipes that used
12:06
to exist oh do you know about uh
12:08
gall uh no districts
12:12
ah sorry gall bladder i guess yes
12:15
but not as in gall bladder goal wasps
12:18
exactly yeah so there are these there
12:21
are hundreds of species of wasps called
12:22
uh goal wasps and what they do is they
12:24
um they land on an oak tree
12:27
and they lay their eggs inside the leaf
12:29
buds and then that turns into this weird
12:31
kind of tumor or lump on the tree and
12:33
the little grub grows inside and it's
12:34
all protected from the outside
12:36
but um those ghouls can be ground up and
12:38
they're a massive ingredient for ink and
12:40
they were for hundreds and hundreds of
12:41
years
12:41
there's only one kind of oak gall which
12:44
makes the ink
12:45
and it's basically the most important
12:47
wasp in history um
12:49
so all of you know mozart darwin magna
12:52
carta beowulf all of that was written in
12:54
oak gall inc
12:55
wow it was for centuries and centuries
12:57
it was the ink to use
12:59
so you could say that these wasps are
13:01
responsible for all those great works
13:02
can't you really i think you can
13:04
yeah yep wow but i mean also the trees
13:07
that you made the paper from
13:08
and you know the tables it's a group
13:10
effort
13:12
to collaborate this logic is flawed but
13:14
you know well done
13:15
yeah yeah it's not going to be like a
13:17
hidden figures movie is
13:23
um what do we make it out of these days
13:26
and i don't actually know
13:27
much about um i don't know actually i i
13:30
think it involves carbon but i haven't
13:32
looked it up properly
13:33
is it not made out of molds and sausages
13:35
butter i think
13:36
yeah yeah i don't know it's probably
13:39
made out of some kind of
13:40
um synthetic resin stuff
13:44
yeah let's go with that cool come with
13:46
us
13:49
did you know that the secret service has
13:51
an international inc library
13:53
no and they keep uh more than 11 000
13:56
specimens of ink and it's for
13:58
identifying mystery inks when they get
14:00
you know like a poison pen letter or
14:01
something like that they
14:02
they've got they've got ink stating all
14:05
so it was set up in this
14:06
so what does that do for them or they
14:08
can find out
14:09
when or where it was made and like it
14:10
turns out we're looking for the author
14:12
of beowulf
14:17
bring in the wasp
14:18
[Laughter]
14:21
um but yeah they've got it they've got
14:23
ink dating back always 1920s and
14:25
it's pretty cool so blood's used often
14:27
in place of
14:28
ink i was just looking into different
14:30
types of uh
14:32
methods of where did sallam hussein have
14:35
a quran in itself
14:37
this is what i was going to say no no
14:38
but it's it's extraordinary i've not
14:40
heard of this so
14:41
saddam is saying post a assassination
14:44
attempt
14:45
um on his son uh became a devout muslim
14:48
and so i read this in atlas obscura
14:50
they um he gave on his after his 60th
14:53
birthday 27 liters of his own
14:56
blood to
14:59
he must have needed a big biscuit after
15:01
that
15:03
so he gave it to this calligrapher um
15:06
who spent two years
15:07
putting together a 600 page blood saddam
15:10
hussein blood
15:11
inked koran which is now uh locked in a
15:15
vault in a mosque in baghdad but it sits
15:18
there it's just
15:19
bizarre yeah i mean there's more there's
15:22
there's much more blood than you would
15:23
need to make a new saddam hussein there
15:25
you need more than blood to make a
15:26
person that's true yeah no
15:28
i'm just saying if someone else finds
15:29
other ingredients well i've watched
15:31
jurassic park and i'm pretty sure they
15:33
only had some blood
15:34
that's very true actually yeah but then
15:36
yeah then the problem is that the
15:37
dinosaurs turned female so
15:38
at some point salamitane might turn into
15:40
a girl and start reproducing on the
15:42
island yeah but i'll assume we're
15:43
keeping him on
15:45
i i don't know what i don't want to go
15:46
to the theme park calls me the film to
15:48
be honest
15:49
i think it's a more sensible pitch than
15:50
the new jurassic world movie
15:58
okay it is time for fact number three
16:00
and that is
16:01
james okay my fact this week is that
16:04
sweden's highest point
16:06
is now its second highest after the top
16:08
of it melted
16:09
oh no poor poor highest point
16:13
oh good for the second highest point
16:14
yeah that's true finally that bastard's
16:16
got what's coming to it
16:18
so was the is the is the second last one
16:20
not covered in ice
16:21
so you're right exactly right so they're
16:23
basically the same part
16:25
they're the same mountain but they're
16:26
two different peaks on the same mountain
16:28
and the highest point in sweden has a
16:31
glacier on top of it
16:32
but due to the recent heat wave the
16:34
glacier has melted and now the second
16:36
highest point is the highest
16:38
but in the winter they expect them to
16:40
swap places again
16:41
yeah so it must be really confusing for
16:42
any sort of textbooks that they're going
16:44
to publish
16:45
between now and winter because they
16:47
don't know
16:48
they can't confirm that it's definitely
16:50
gonna get cold enough the real victims
16:51
in this scenario
16:53
uh and this is i'd i'll probably
16:55
pronounce this wrong but it's something
16:56
like cabna kaiser mountain
16:58
uh which is in the north of sweden oh
17:00
man so it's not a good news story in
17:02
some ways
17:03
well i didn't put it forward as a good
17:05
news star
17:06
no completely no you didn't um i think
17:09
it's just a thing that happened
17:10
uh and i think it's interesting that a
17:12
country can have two
17:13
um peaks that are the highest at
17:15
different pace
17:17
and there are even worse things about it
17:19
actually because let's say you're
17:20
swedish or
17:21
let's say you're any nationality but you
17:23
want to climb the highest point in
17:24
sweden yeah
17:25
you've always been able to climb this
17:27
kind of point which is the north
17:28
uh peak of kevner kaiser and now
17:32
you need to climb the other one and
17:33
actually it's a much more difficult
17:34
climb
17:35
so for a safety aspect they think a lot
17:37
more people might get injured or killed
17:39
because they're trying to climb this
17:40
really difficult peak whereas before
17:41
they
17:42
could do the relatively easy one can you
17:44
wait until i guess you can wait until
17:46
winter oh no it's bad climbing mountains
17:47
in winter isn't it
17:48
it's easier in spring and summer yeah
17:51
although it's um
17:52
it's snowy at the top anyway of the of
17:54
the old one
17:55
okay how how much is it melted by to
17:57
make it is it a mash of center because
17:59
you could just take like a calipo up if
18:00
you really want the other one to be
18:02
fine and just stick it in the snow i
18:03
don't think you're allowed to make your
18:04
own highest point
18:05
well that did happen that's that movie i
18:07
think we might have mentioned it before
18:09
the man who went up the hill and came
18:10
down the mountain yeah which was
18:12
a true story of the guy in wales who
18:14
they said that
18:15
to be a mountain it had to be a certain
18:17
height so we added a little bit on top
18:18
of it to make it higher
18:19
uh but i think he did that with ground
18:22
rather than calipos
18:24
i i didn't actually i thought that movie
18:26
was going to be something sort of some
18:27
tedious emotional journey and that was a
18:28
metaphor i didn't realize that was
18:29
literally the story
18:31
i think it might also be a tedious
18:32
emotional journey okay so get this
18:35
the the lowest highest point no hang on
18:38
sorry
18:39
here we go the highest lowest point
18:42
in the world in any country oh okay so
18:45
is it
18:46
can i guess yeah uh i think is it in
18:49
swaziland
18:49
oh you're so close oh it's down there
18:52
somewhere it's the other one
18:54
it's the other small country within
18:56
south africa it's lesotho the enclave
18:58
country yes which is completely
18:59
surrounded by south africa
19:00
okay um what is it is it like a cave or
19:02
is it to be above ground
19:04
it's yeah it's just the lowest is so all
19:07
of lesotho
19:07
is uh well over a thousand meters above
19:10
sea level so the lowest point in lesotho
19:12
is 1
19:12
400 meters above sea level and
19:14
everything else is even higher than that
19:16
are there any countries that are
19:17
entirely below that point
19:19
oh well um tuvalu tuvalu yeah all of
19:23
those places that are going to get
19:24
too blue in the maldives yeah so the the
19:26
lowest high point
19:28
as opposed to the highest low point the
19:29
lowest high point yeah is in the
19:31
maldives
19:32
which is 2.4 meters above sea level yeah
19:35
so uh maldives obviously lots of islands
19:38
and 99 of the maldives territory is open
19:40
ocean
19:40
but there was this island called
19:43
villingali which had an eight-foot rise
19:44
on it which was the highest point
19:46
however in 2013 a golf course opened
19:49
on that island and it has a small mound
19:51
on it which was 16 feet above sea level
19:54
and the fifth hole teeing off point is
19:56
the highest point
19:57
now in the maldives and it's in a resort
19:59
and they do a daily tour
20:01
and all guests who complete the ascent
20:02
get a certificate
20:06
wow that's a that's be annoying though
20:08
if you're playing golf and you've got a
20:10
whole
20:11
sort of expedition trying to what with
20:13
crown phones
20:16
mount the hole oh and there's a flag
20:18
there someone's got him
20:21
i've got a swedish mountains fact oh
20:23
yeah there is a
20:24
massive bunker inside is this another
20:26
golf fact
20:27
no so there's a sort of massive
20:30
underground bunker inside the swedish
20:33
mountains
20:34
and it was built as a sort of government
20:35
protection facility for you know nuclear
20:38
events and stuff um and it's no longer
20:40
used for that and it was sold
20:41
to a private data center so they keep
20:44
servers in there now
20:45
in and one of the things that's kept
20:47
inside those servers is wikileaks
20:49
huh yeah actually yeah
20:52
the digital version of the song was just
20:54
kept in
20:55
imprisoned underground and you look at
20:58
pictures it does actually look like an
20:59
evil villain's lair it's crazy but it's
21:01
inside a mountain it's made of glass
21:02
but um it's cool as well that's where
21:04
wikileaks is guys it's inside a swedish
21:06
mountain
21:06
wow that's very cool that is very cool
21:08
the highest point in the netherlands is
21:10
4 000 miles from amsterdam
21:13
what yeah so um there's the caribbean
21:16
netherlands
21:17
which is a different tillies like that
21:19
yeah i think it was called the dutch
21:20
antilles and then recently they had a
21:22
weird admin change but there's an island
21:23
called saba and it has a mount on it
21:25
called mount scenery
21:26
it's about three or four times higher
21:28
than anywhere in the netherlands that's
21:29
true
21:30
actually if um the highest point of
21:32
britain i think if we count everything
21:34
that we claim
21:35
is in the antarctic oh that's good
21:37
because we claim a little bit of the
21:38
antarctic which has a massive mountain
21:40
on it
21:41
nice and the highest point in australia
21:42
is not what is it kosciuszko
21:45
yeah it's actually an island off the
21:47
coast of australia which has got a
21:48
massive peak on it
21:50
and the highest point in spain is in the
21:52
canary islands mount heidi
21:55
so loads of countries the highest point
21:56
isn't really in that country at all
21:58
wow who owns i know singing the moon
22:02
the highest with the highest uh no one
22:05
owns the moon no but there's the flag
22:06
that's not true says i've got a
22:08
certificate
22:11
the highest point of andy's house is
22:12
actually
22:16
i have a thing or two about the um the
22:19
big heatwave that we've been going
22:20
through oh yeah um
22:21
so this is uh quite tied in your effect
22:24
to the fact that globally there's been a
22:25
heatwave and um
22:27
ireland uh very recently um through the
22:30
heatwave and through
22:31
the drought uh has had exposed a sort of
22:34
huge stone that says ire so e
22:38
i r e sorry i always pronounced that
22:41
error but
22:42
i don't know how to pronounce it yeah
22:43
would you say aaron don't look at me
22:44
would you say i don't know
22:46
i i'd say it is an error to say what
22:50
uh i think it is error ourselves just
22:52
say that yeah so
22:54
so it's exposed this giant stone
22:57
era e-i-r-e and it's uh along the irish
23:00
coast
23:01
and what it was is during the second
23:03
world war they built this
23:05
uh to show the enemies that were flying
23:08
over
23:08
thinking that they were going to bomb
23:09
let's say england don't bomb us this is
23:12
ireland this is neutral ground
23:14
this wasn't it to differentiate ireland
23:15
from northern ireland was it northern
23:17
ireland
23:18
i think well i'm just guessing but i
23:19
would have thought that pilots would
23:21
know whether they were over island or
23:23
it could be foggy you know second one
23:28
just assuming everyone in the war was an
23:29
idiot it sounds like someone who's used
23:31
the excuse of fog for making some pretty
23:32
egregious errors in your life
23:34
i didn't mean to be in her house you
23:36
know i didn't know i was 50 miles away
23:37
it was foggy
23:38
what can i say um sorry just to
23:41
backtrack a tiny bit
23:43
um there were huge fires as a result of
23:46
this heat wave
23:46
and uh the fires knocked out all of the
23:50
grass and the trees and so on and it's
23:51
exposed
23:52
this giant air e-i-r-e to mean ireland
23:56
um i've found it on the internet so
23:58
let's see how they pronounce it
24:05
[Laughter]
24:08
um i have a fact about sweden which i
24:10
definitely know how to pronounce
24:12
so in lots of swedish mountains uh there
24:15
have been no
24:16
worms since the ice age they were all
24:19
wiped out
24:22
it's true yeah it's great i mean bad for
24:24
the worms it's bad for the worms but
24:25
they've got other places to live so it's
24:26
fine
24:27
um and bad for the soil in the mountains
24:29
this is the thing so they change the
24:31
vegetation
24:32
and they have very negative effects on
24:33
particular trees i think even affect
24:34
deer life cycles i can't remember how
24:36
so the thing is that they are definitely
24:39
invasive because
24:40
worm populations apparently are only
24:41
capable of moving 5 to 10 meters a year
24:44
so for them to make their way all the
24:46
way through northern europe into the
24:47
swedish mountains they wouldn't
24:48
have done it not much of an invasion
24:50
it's not like the germans going into
24:52
russia
24:54
um and that so this is how we know that
24:56
they're invasive
24:58
um and they're impossible to get rid of
24:59
if they establish themselves so this
25:00
could completely change
25:02
the european landscape over the next few
25:04
hundred years yeah
25:06
um do you know that with due to the
25:07
heatwave um
25:09
bears in dundee in the zoo got an 80
25:12
kilo ice lolly
25:14
to keep them cool wow what's it made of
25:17
uh ice oh nice and fruit
25:21
lovely it's very nice that does sound
25:23
good it sounds like one of those
25:24
decoy healthy lollies yeah like when the
25:29
um ice cream man used to come and we
25:30
weren't allowed to go and my mum would
25:32
instead freeze some orange juice yeah
25:34
to have that right yeah would
25:37
she then cut the carton open uh as in
25:40
how would you get at the orange juice
25:41
did you pour it into a glass you do it
25:43
you do it in ice cube trays right
25:44
uh no so we had special ice lolly trays
25:47
that uh like ice cube clothes but shaped
25:49
like iceland i remember those
25:50
so you pull the yeah into the molds that
25:52
is a better method than
25:53
just freezing the ice the orange country
25:56
and then hacking it open
25:58
entire liter of ice you just have a pool
26:01
cue into the orange juice carton
26:03
and freeze that
26:06
um did the bears get like get it on
26:08
sticks or i saw a photo of it i think
26:10
and i think it was hanging on a chain
26:13
wow and they could climb on it that is i
26:15
believe
26:16
on it yeah on a nice lolly imagine a
26:19
magnum a big magnum swinging from a
26:21
chain and you can just clamber on it
26:23
very grippable a nice one it's a solid
26:25
block of i think i've just discovered my
26:26
fetish i would
26:29
i would love to see that miley cyrus
26:30
video where she swings
26:34
and the highest temperature ever
26:36
recorded in scotland
26:37
was here this year but it was declared
26:39
invalid because the thermometer was next
26:41
to a vehicle with its engine running
26:43
[Laughter]
26:47
the coldest temperature ever outside of
26:49
antarctica
26:50
was measured in siberia but no one knows
26:53
if that's right because the thermometer
26:55
broke due to the cold
27:03
okay it is time for our final fact of
27:05
the show and that is my fact
27:07
my fact this week is that when financier
27:09
william c
27:10
ralston modestly refused to allow a town
27:12
to be named after him
27:14
the town instead called itself modesto
27:18
modesto or modesto modesto modesto
27:21
i would get a check on the internet yeah
27:23
yeah
27:25
uh modesto modesto
27:28
[Laughter]
27:29
absolutely nailed it okay yeah modesto
27:33
it sounds like a it sounds like a very
27:35
demure magician it does
27:37
the great modesto well i wouldn't say
27:39
great
27:44
but yeah so this fact was sent to me by
27:46
at
27:47
shutter underscore butter on twitter
27:50
it's an amazing fact so thank you
27:52
shutter underscore butter
27:54
and uh so modesto is in california
27:57
um it is a town that has had a bit of
28:01
fame
28:01
via the fact that it's the birthplace of
28:03
george lucas and
28:04
uh back in the day he made a very famous
28:06
movie called american graffiti it was
28:08
about
28:10
it was a massive movie at the time it
28:12
was pre-star wars
28:14
it sounds like that's
28:19
but i think what you're going to say is
28:20
that might have been based on this it
28:21
was modest
28:22
american graffiti took place in modesto
28:25
it was filmed elsewhere but that's where
28:26
it took place
28:27
interestingly george lucas is so modest
28:29
that he only introduces himself as the
28:30
director of american graffiti
28:34
jeremy renner the actor yeah is from uh
28:37
modesto he was born there as well this
28:38
is a
28:39
significant town it is and and can i
28:41
just quickly slip in my favorite jeremy
28:42
rene fact from the year
28:44
uh just used it thank god he was born
28:46
there i've been trying to get this fact
28:47
out
28:48
um he's starring in the new movie tag uh
28:50
right
28:51
so in tag um it's only most of jeremy
28:54
renner that appears in the movie
28:56
his arms don't appear in the movie and
28:58
the reason is he broke them just
29:00
as they were filming and so they were in
29:02
casts and so they had to cgi in
29:04
his arms yeah so when you watch the
29:05
movie tag which is predominantly about i
29:07
think
29:08
using your playing tag yeah they're not
29:10
his arms they're cgi arms
29:12
are you saying he was running around
29:13
with two broken arms in caste yeah
29:16
does that mean technically he's still it
29:18
because he hasn't
29:20
it's a really confusing conversation
29:21
happening we're going to recast his arms
29:23
because he's been broken
29:26
[Laughter]
29:31
so on this town's naming thing yeah
29:33
there's a there's a huge
29:34
trope of how towns get their names so
29:36
there's a town in tennessee which is
29:37
called difficult
29:38
and it's all it all happens when they
29:40
write to the post office
29:42
saying can we have this particular name
29:44
and supposedly when they applied for the
29:46
name
29:47
which was a really complicated name they
29:48
wanted to name the town the u.s postal
29:50
service replied
29:50
your name is difficult and the people in
29:53
the town thought oh they've just renamed
29:54
our town difficult
29:56
i never believe any of these stories
29:58
there's one in california called likely
29:59
and the legend is always that
30:01
all the residents got together to decide
30:02
the name for their new town because for
30:03
some reason they're all living there in
30:05
a town with no name
30:06
and then they were like they were like
30:07
oh we're never going to grow in a name
30:08
and a guy went yeah likely
30:09
and like then they were like great name
30:11
isn't it and the same happened for
30:13
town you bet apparently there's a guy
30:14
who went oh you bet and that's why the
30:15
town's called you better
30:16
ridiculous i mean like they all like all
30:18
of this stuff is on the inside they need
30:19
to get more original stories
30:20
yeah ding dong texas do you know about
30:23
that
30:25
ding dong texas did somebody ring the
30:26
bell just as they were deciding on their
30:28
name they're like perfect
30:31
um no it was named after um for governor
30:34
peter bell um
30:36
and the businessman zulus bell and his
30:38
nephew burt but zulus and bert were not
30:40
in any way related to peter
30:42
um so yeah it was called ding dong as a
30:45
reference um
30:46
and uh weirdly it's in central texas's
30:49
bell county
30:51
i thought it might have been named after
30:52
leslie phillips
30:56
yeah plus the past um
31:00
there's only one place on earth that
31:01
i've found which is called earth
31:04
okay in texas that's good and
31:07
there are various reasons as to why as
31:09
always some somebody suggested it
31:11
because they have a lot of earth
31:13
there but there's a really good article
31:15
about it online which points out there
31:16
are at least two other places in
31:17
america named after every single other
31:20
planet the venus and mercury
31:22
in florida jupiter there are saturn's
31:24
guess which planet there are not
31:25
two places named after mercury it's
31:28
uranus
31:29
there is one place but it's more of a
31:31
tourist attraction than the town
31:33
like it's a little tourist attraction
31:35
which contains the uranus brewing
31:37
company
31:37
combat uranus there's a guy who calls
31:40
himself the mayor of uranus
31:41
they sell fudge which has a label on it
31:43
saying uranus is great
31:45
um this is a cool place there's a place
31:46
called nitro which is named after the
31:49
explosive powder which was made there in
31:51
the first world war that's so cool that
31:52
seems like a proper etymology
31:54
there's a place in russia called
31:55
asbestos where a friend of mine was born
31:57
wow and it's where they make all the
31:58
asbestos and send it to america
32:00
very cool this is uh i don't know how
32:02
well this is known in
32:04
britain but uh in the uk
32:07
there was a place that had its name
32:09
change stains
32:10
well it's still a place called stains
32:12
well technically not just stains it's
32:14
now called
32:15
stains upon thames it's not much better
32:19
is it
32:20
but i remember this i remember when they
32:22
tried to do this yeah so uh the reason
32:24
that they did this
32:25
is because ali g internationally had
32:28
given spain
32:29
exactly such a bad name that they they
32:32
were always associated if you didn't
32:33
like i remember
32:34
watching ali g in australia and thinking
32:37
oh stains must be i could see there was
32:38
laughter but you just associated it
32:40
sort of as this place where and stains
32:42
is quite nice yes exactly
32:44
from someone which is quite middle-class
32:46
yeah you know so they
32:47
wanted to change it but they didn't
32:49
really change it they just added an
32:50
extra bit on the end
32:51
yeah exactly so on the 15th of december
32:53
2011
32:54
um the spelt thorn borough council
32:57
resolved by
32:57
25 votes to four um to change the name
33:01
of the town to stains upon thames to try
33:03
and boost the local economy
33:04
by promoting its riverside location i'm
33:06
quoting quoting directly from
33:08
the wikipedia article that i found this
33:11
on
33:11
i wonder if there's a calculation for
33:13
how much adding upon thames adds to a
33:15
town's
33:16
net worth as it were as in richmond upon
33:18
thames is quite
33:19
sort of yeah or upon any river i do sort
33:22
of like stains with waitrose
33:23
and that would probably help because it
33:24
stains upon the waitrose
33:28
my uncle when he was a councillor in
33:30
bolton tried to change the name of
33:31
bolton to bolton lamar's
33:34
yeah because there are lots of other
33:35
places called bolton in the world and he
33:38
thought it would distinguish
33:39
our town from the other ones and also
33:41
we're on the mars as in that's where all
33:43
the fighters were
33:44
moore's sonny he was trying to bolt on
33:45
an extra bit to the name very good
33:48
um was he successful no it's still cold
33:52
surely bolton is the most famous bolton
33:55
i don't mean any disrespect to other
33:56
boltons around the world but
33:58
i am michael famously people are always
34:01
getting confused between the tower
34:03
misdirected mail from an entire town to
34:05
his house every day
34:08
there's a city uh topeka you've heard of
34:11
topeka so it's the is
34:12
in kansas and it's the capital of the
34:14
state it's no it's no
34:16
you know one slouch it's no slouch it's
34:18
no slow um
34:20
but it uh it changed its name to google
34:23
for a month
34:25
legally and officially topeka did yeah
34:27
and it was to win a google high-speed
34:29
internet project which would have given
34:30
everyone
34:31
internet 100 times faster than the
34:33
national average at the time no one
34:34
would ever be able to search for them
34:36
online would they break the internet if
34:38
you google google
34:39
well they it didn't work no google went
34:42
with kansas city kansas instead
34:44
but the mayor he said he didn't really
34:45
mind not winning and he said i've often
34:47
wondered what difference does it make if
34:48
it takes you 10 seconds or one second to
34:50
access information my life goes a little
34:52
slower than that
34:53
oh yeah he's a very laid-back guy but
34:56
this is not the first time they changed
34:56
the name in 1998 topeka
34:58
changed its name and one of you all
35:00
really liked this fact they changed it
35:02
to
35:02
to pikachu
35:03
[Laughter]
35:06
because pokemon arrived in the usa yeah
35:07
i love it yeah
35:09
on modesto yeah it's the second
35:12
unhappiest city
35:14
in the united states of america what
35:16
yeah
35:17
wow the um the city's motto is water
35:20
wealth
35:20
contentment health um and that was
35:23
selected
35:24
uh in a contest in 1911 where the winner
35:27
won three dollars
35:28
as a prize um yeah and just to
35:31
say ralston uh wasn't just this local
35:34
banker uh
35:34
the man who the town was not named after
35:36
exactly um ralston
35:38
was uh he was one of the most rich
35:41
people in california actually and he
35:42
founded
35:43
the bank of california so he was he was
35:45
a very important guy in his day well he
35:47
didn't like to talk about it
35:49
i really had to dig deep to find that
35:52
i there's a town in california called
35:54
secret town is there
35:56
and why is it called that do we know i
35:57
can't tell you that
36:00
i genuinely know nothing about it

goodbye

=230
00:11
hello
00:12
and welcome to another episode
00:16
of no such thing as a fish a weekly
00:19
podcast
00:20
this week coming to you from the
00:21
wilderness festival
00:28
my name is dan schreiber and i'm sitting
00:31
here with anna chazinski
00:32
james harkin and andrew hunter murray
00:35
and once again we have gathered round
00:36
the microphones with our four
00:38
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:40
and in no particular order
00:41
here we go starting with our first back
00:44
this week that's my fact
00:46
my fact is according to a new scientific
00:48
study
00:49
the best way to perform cpr is to do it
00:52
while humming
00:53
the macarena how cool is that
00:57
and i think they recommend humming it
00:59
because they probably don't believe if
01:01
you're trying to save someone life and
01:02
you're going hamadan
01:05
you're the right person and they are
01:06
lyrics so you just said that
01:08
does anyone know the actual lyrics i
01:10
think everyone knows the word macarena
01:12
and no other word in that song yeah
01:14
exactly
01:14
but it's it's what it is about this song
01:16
is that it has a bpm so every song has a
01:18
beat per minute and this bpm is 103
01:21
and as a result when they're trying to
01:23
teach people the perfect
01:24
pounce that you need on a chest as
01:26
you're trying to save someone's life
01:28
the macarena happens to be the perfect
01:30
amount and before that they used to
01:31
think it was staying alive by the
01:33
beaches that's right
01:35
because that's about 103 or 104 as well
01:38
yeah but actually
01:39
also maybe it's supposed to be about 100
01:41
is the best
01:42
right but macarena is good because
01:44
everyone kind of knows the beat of that
01:46
so it's good to do but i thought i'd
01:47
look at some others that are 100 beats
01:48
per minute so
01:49
if anyone's having a heart attack you
01:51
should try these ones um crazy in love
01:53
by beyonce
01:55
uh independent women by destiny's child
01:58
oh yeah any of these work uh hips don't
02:00
lie by shakira that's my favorite
02:03
or my chemical romance dead yeah ah
02:06
not a good one that's not a good i found
02:08
a few more so
02:09
simon and garfunkel bridge over troubled
02:12
water
02:13
if it's just a nice mood you want to
02:14
kill everyone else sometimes the
02:16
situation doesn't need something fun
02:18
okay sometimes poignancy is needed um
02:20
but the way they sing that on the x
02:22
factor which is the slowest song in the
02:24
history of time
02:25
oh okay well how about this one it
02:27
doesn't have any beat
02:28
you just you'd pause
02:40
i think surely the macaroon is a bad one
02:42
because no one's ever been able to
02:44
hear it or hum it without actually doing
02:45
the dance and as soon as you're doing
02:47
the dance yeah yeah
02:48
very difficult and also if you watch
02:49
anyone doing the dance a load of people
02:51
they lose their rhythm
02:52
almost immediately don't they and half
02:54
of them are doing one thing and half of
02:55
them are doing something
02:56
ideally what you want is four people who
02:58
need it surrounded
02:59
you right around you so you can turn to
03:02
the next person start administering it
03:05
get to the next it's a good way of
03:06
multitasking and
03:08
fair sharing so macarena is by los del
03:10
rio
03:11
yes okay and this is very much a one-hit
03:13
wonder isn't it they
03:14
never had any other hits at all james i
03:17
have got at least one of their other
03:19
hits
03:19
right here on my paper one it's macarena
03:23
christmas
03:25
it was released about 18 months after
03:27
macarena and it is i kid you not the
03:29
worst song
03:30
ever released it's a it's a medley of
03:32
jingle bells joy to the world
03:33
rudolph the red-nosed reindeer and the
03:35
macarena wow
03:37
they just break off and they do a bit of
03:38
macarena they released i think five or
03:40
six albums
03:41
uh one of them was macarena non-stop
03:44
which the compilation album it only has
03:46
eight tracks and five of them at the
03:48
macarena
03:50
but you know what's amazing about los
03:52
del rio this band they got together in
03:55
1964
03:56
i believe it was 62 or 64. the same year
03:58
that the rolling stones got together
04:00
they had their hit 32 years into their
04:03
career
04:05
that was finally they were like should
04:06
we give up i'm sure we're gonna
04:08
hit it one day mate let's do it and they
04:10
did and then they must have thought wow
04:12
we've made it
04:13
and that was the end of their career
04:14
yeah let's keep going they're still
04:16
performing
04:17
but are they i when i was researching
04:19
this i read an article from 1999 the
04:21
headline of which was does anyone
04:22
remember the macarena
04:24
i mean and that's what was that what a
04:26
stupid article everyone remembers the
04:28
macarena i watched um a video you know
04:30
you come see these on youtube where they
04:32
show
04:32
teenagers stuff from the 90s or whatever
04:34
and see if they know what it is
04:36
yeah every single one of them knew what
04:37
the macarena was yeah no one knew the
04:39
band but they all knew the song
04:41
yeah and in 2003 so that's 10 years
04:44
after the record was released they were
04:45
still making
04:46
a quarter of a million dollars a year in
04:48
royalties wow
04:50
and it's extraordinary the original
04:52
macarena dance there was an original
04:54
this
04:54
that was the second dance it was when
04:56
they made the video when there was a
04:57
remix done of the song that's the first
04:58
one
04:58
the first one was an incredibly
05:01
complicated flamenco dance
05:02
that was done in clubs you would have to
05:04
be an expert in order to do it
05:06
it had double the amount of moves that
05:08
the original uh
05:09
verse had was it invented by a like a
05:11
random aerobics teacher or dance teacher
05:13
or something yeah
05:14
mia yeah yeah or mia fry she was in the
05:17
uh video clip and so
05:19
she wanted something that kids could
05:20
dance to and adults um
05:22
who have to go to nightclubs but don't
05:24
know how to dance could dance too
05:26
so the four of us bow to her
05:30
you've saved those actually macarena uh
05:32
it's about a woman called macarena
05:34
but the name macarena was originally
05:36
magdalena
05:37
and it was just a word for like a
05:39
sensuous woman and it comes from mary
05:41
magdalene
05:41
then it was a word for any kind of
05:42
prostitute and then it was a word for a
05:44
sensuous woman
05:45
right so really it should be hey
05:46
magdalena hey prostitute
05:49
well and is it about a woman who um
05:51
prostitute
05:52
um in the song the lyrics are actually
05:54
the woman
05:55
saying don't worry about my boyfriend
05:57
he's gone off to
05:58
fight uh you two are his best mates do
06:00
you wanna shag instead
06:01
is that okay
06:07
it's not a good message to be sending 12
06:08
year olds at disco no
06:10
um this is this is just a little nugget
06:12
i enjoyed um
06:13
it went to number one in france uh it
06:15
went number one in a number of countries
06:17
but not in the uk not in the uk uh
06:19
because
06:20
uh it was the world's guy tlc
06:24
no wannabe by the spice girls no
06:27
wow that's bad look wasn't it because
06:29
it's like the biggest song of all time
06:30
but they
06:31
came up against there was a big there
06:32
was a big gasp around the room
06:35
20 year old chart news yeah
06:39
hey guys and blur beat oasis to number
06:41

06:42
what what do you think they were

07:12
that was number one that was number one
07:13
in france i think that was the one in
07:15
the uk or it did well in the uk
07:16
isn't that tubular bells mike fiel mike
07:19
oldfield
07:20
did a cover of it later how weird is
07:22
that
07:23
you're thinking the exorcist yeah yeah
07:25
should we talk about cpr
07:26
yeah yeah um if you have
07:30
a problem with cpr as in so a lot of
07:32
people are quite light and it's it's you
07:34
need a lot of pressure to get someone's
07:36
chest deep enough to get the blood
07:37
flowing while you're waiting for the
07:38
ambulance so if you are light a tip
07:40
is to jump on the person who you're
07:42
trying to administer so you could
07:43
actually be doing the macarena well kind
07:45
of yes you could
07:47
wow sorry i say tip and i've there's no
07:50
medical advice on this stage
07:51
i think that's fair to say yes don't use
07:53
this tip there is a doctor though who
07:55
does recommend using the feet
07:57
i think people have said especially if
07:59
you're a bit older you've lost some of
08:00
your muscle strength
08:01
um but also advice now or advice release
08:03
in 2010 it's always changing is
08:05
don't do the breathing anymore none of
08:07
the snogging you just do the
08:09
hands to the heart don't you you just do
08:10
the hard punishment so you do the bit
08:11
that isn't so much fun
08:13
yeah exactly just jumping up and down
08:15
the mouth-to-mouth one's really weird
08:16
because
08:17
it kind of was discovered in the 18th
08:19
century and then it just got forgotten
08:20
about for about 50 to 100 years and
08:22
basically no one did it at all and then
08:24
it came back
08:25
and the reason they stopped it is
08:27
because they realized what was coming
08:29
out of your
08:29
mouth when you breathed and it's carbon
08:31
dioxide and they were saying well what's
08:33
the point of breathing carbon dioxide
08:34
into someone's lungs because they bring
08:36
oxygen yeah and you know what the answer
08:37
is you know why that's not true no
08:40
it's because when you breathe in and
08:41
breathe out you actually only absorb
08:43
about 40 percent of the oxygen so
08:45
there's still plenty of oxygen
08:46
in your breath um and any kind of oxygen
08:49
is better than that okay so how long
08:51
if we started some if someone breathed
08:53
in at the edge of the room here
08:54
and then they passed the breath around
08:56
the room
08:57
how long would it be before there was no
08:59
point in that exercise i think it's
09:00
worth a try isn't it all right i feel an
09:02
experiment coming on
09:03
okay i think we should start with that
09:04
topless guy you and that oh
09:07
people have tried all sorts of weird cpr
09:10
over the ages they used to be the barrel
09:11
type
09:12
where you you there was a big round
09:14
barrel and you were sort of strapped to
09:16
it
09:16
uh face down with your stomach over the
09:18
barrel and i don't know how you did this
09:20
so quickly when someone's obviously
09:21
dying of a heart attack in front of you
09:23
and then as the person who's saving them
09:24
you sort of stood in between their legs
09:26
and you rolled them
09:27
on and off the barrel don't you and it
09:29
was the idea was that it eventually
09:30
forced your heart into skulls
09:31
again really yeah yeah it's like one of
09:34
those did you ever go to playgrounds
09:35
where you would run on a barrel that
09:36
span round and round yeah but i've seen
09:38
cartoons where that happens right yes
09:40
that well that's medical advice from the
09:42
victorian age um hey we need to move on
09:44
to our next fact shortly
09:46
oh can i just there was so you know how
09:47
people are always giving mouth to mouth
09:49
and cpr to animals weirdly successfully
09:52
no yeah constantly yeah you know how
09:55
people are always giving
09:57
mouth to mouth to animals weirdly
09:58
successful there was a guy that's are
09:59
you going to talk about the guy this
10:00
year with the
10:01
well they're the frog there's a guy this
10:03
year who did it with a frog
10:05
after the frog what's happening here oh
10:07
is this your fact no it's not mine
10:09
actually mine was the one i was going to
10:10
say dan let's do your first you do the
10:12
frog thing
10:13
let's uh um this was a this was a deer
10:16
and it was a deer who was drowning in a
10:18
swimming pool and an rspca officer was
10:20
called
10:20
and he got the deer out of the pool and
10:22
he gave it chest compressions and
10:24
cpr and mouth to mouth gave it a kiss of
10:26
life until it choked he said it properly
10:28
like in films
10:29
coughed water into his mouth um and then
10:32
and then he started choking and it
10:34
then had to give him cpr where does the
10:38
frog come into this yeah
10:41
anyway the deer got up he brushed it
10:42
down and then he said the deer looked at
10:44
him
10:44
and then ran away sweet yeah
10:47
it's a good story anna but i just wonder
10:49
has anything happened with any smaller
10:50
maybe
10:51
amphibious no it hasn't i think we're
10:53
moving on interestingly a frog that's
10:55
involved in a
10:56
um this is a great story there was a i
10:59
can't wait
11:00
this guy was walking just minding his
11:02
own business
11:03
when he came across a snake on the
11:05
ground and the snake was choking and he
11:06
thought i'm not going to give cpr to a
11:08
snake how could you tell us snake is
11:09
choking it was sort of like
11:10
doing that okay yeah and suddenly out of
11:13
its mouth shoots a frog
11:15
so it swallowed the frog but this the
11:17
frog forced its way back out
11:19
okay but in the process died the man saw
11:22
the frog and he gave cpr to the frog and
11:24
he brought it back to life
11:26
yeah and he brought the one to the snake
11:29
he doesn't feature in the rest of the
11:30
story really i don't know what happened
11:32
the fly that i imagined was the initial
11:34
thing
11:39
all right look we need to move on to our
11:40
next fact it is time for fact number two
11:43
and that is chozinski my fact this week
11:46
is that donald trump
11:47
negotiated an extremely bad deal for
11:49
himself when he wrote the art of the
11:51
deal
11:52
this is because a uh so tony schwartz
11:55
was a guy who ghost wrote the art of the
11:56
deal with trump
11:57
and he gave a talk a while back and he
12:00
openly said
12:01
trump negotiated an extremely bad deal
12:03
with me i got a great deal out of it he
12:05
did an unheard of thing so there was an
12:07
advance
12:08
of half a million dollars for the art of
12:09
the deal and trump gave his ghost right
12:11
to 50
12:12
of the advance and then 50 of all the
12:15
royalties
12:16
so this guy has just been making
12:17
millions and millions from this book
12:19
this is unheard of in publishing
12:21
i think someone who uh a negotiating
12:23
professor uh
12:24
called deepak malhotra said there is not
12:26
a better deal out there in the world for
12:28
ghostwriting
12:31
and then when the book came out trump
12:33
hosted an absolutely massive party
12:34
didn't he in
12:35
trump tower i think it was there was a
12:37
big red carpet loads of celebrities came
12:39
there was a giant cake replica of trump
12:41
tower and then he went to his ghost
12:43
writer and he went
12:44
well you owe me fifty percent for the
12:46
price of this party
12:47
and the ghostwriter went i don't think
12:49
so
12:51
and he ended up paying about a thousand
12:52
pounds just meant to drink him and his
12:54
friends had
12:54
oh really do you know what the
12:56
inspiration for the book was for the
12:57
book the art of the deal
12:58
no there was an article all about trump
13:00
in gq and
13:02
it was a popular article as in that
13:03
issue of gq sold well because trump was
13:05
on the front cover he was a businessman
13:06
at the time
13:07
and then they thought why don't we see
13:08
if we can turn this into a book so they
13:10
tested out
13:11
what the book would look like they
13:12
designed a dummy cover and then
13:15
it had a picture of him looking heroic
13:16
on the front and then they wrapped it
13:18
around a thick russian novel
13:19
and thought what it would look like a
13:21
thick russian
13:23
novel guys
13:26
the clues were there from the start wow
13:29
no
13:30
okay all right off we go
13:34
what's exciting is you've all heard
13:35
something that won't be in the actual
13:37
show when we release it so that's
13:40
he has a bad record of deal making
13:41
though right he's um this is actually an
13:44
article by jonathan friedland i think in
13:45
the guardian pointing out his uh deal
13:47
making
13:48
history but so the apprentice first
13:50
series
13:51
extremely successful um so he asked for
13:54
an increase in what he was paid i think
13:56
it's per episode so he got 50 grand
13:58
he asked an increase to 1 million
14:00
dollars
14:01
good deal-making isn't it that sounds
14:03
like good deal-making he ended up with
14:05
60 grand
14:08
but no a lot of people say not a good
14:09
deal maker someone else who's done a
14:11
deal with him said he seems way too keen
14:12
you've got to seem cool he sort of paces
14:14
around the room like he's wearing a sign
14:16
saying desperate
14:17
and who said that vladimir what was he
14:19
called uh
14:20
he chose to remain anonymous do you know
14:24
he
14:24
he released a novel years ago yeah
14:27
called trump tower
14:28
and then he effectively unreleased it in
14:32
that the novel still exists but he took
14:33
his name off so it was ghost ridden by
14:35
someone else
14:36
um and he had his name though it was a
14:38
donald trump book it was called trump
14:39
tower
14:40
and it was a it was a book based on an
14:42
idea for a tv show that he developed
14:44
which was meant to be trump tower done
14:46
like the tv show dallas or
14:48
all those american soaps it was the life
14:50
of all the people that worked in trump
14:52
tower
14:52
and they got a pilot but the pilot
14:54
didn't get made so they ended up doing
14:55
this book
14:56
and um on the front it said it was the
14:58
sexiest novel of the decade
15:00
wow which decade uh it was 2011. was it
15:03
it was it was
15:04
2011. yeah it's a current it's he's he's
15:07
predicted
15:08
we still cannot top the sexiness of this
15:10
book wow it was an erotic novel wasn't
15:13
it yeah first novel and um so i was
15:14
reading some snippets of it uh it is
15:17
this is how erotic it is so someone
15:18
walks into a room a guest in trump tower
15:20
and sees at least six women not wearing
15:24
tops
15:24
and says i must be dead i've gone to
15:27
boob heaven
15:29
that was an actual line in an actual
15:30
novel um he's
15:32
just very quickly he's also really good
15:34
for books uh donald trump
15:35
because anytime he tweets about a book
15:37
that he doesn't like
15:38
it does really well so for example fire
15:40
and fury became massive off the back of
15:42
him
15:42
taking it down and there was a very
15:45
famous he's a civil rights icon in
15:46
america called john lewis and he wrote a
15:48
number of books and he wrote a tweet
15:49
saying i don't think he's fit for
15:51
president
15:51
and trump took him down massively as a
15:54
result the sales increase of his books
15:56
were over a hundred thousand percent
15:59
and in the weekend of the tweet seven of
16:01
the top 20 books
16:03
were attributed to john lewis all his
16:05
books just rose to the top wow
16:06
so he's actually good for book sales if
16:08
he hates you the john lewis brand is
16:10
very different in america isn't it
16:12
yeah yes yeah um i've got a couple of
16:14
bad deals from history
16:16
okay uh that i've researched so the fact
16:18
being that trump negotiated a bad deal
16:20
for the art of the deal um i thought
16:22
this was quite fun there's a
16:23
in america the nfl there's a team the
16:25
green bay packers and they had a player
16:27
called
16:27
mirror uh m-i-r-e-r yeah i never heard
16:30
him
16:31
oh okay he was he was a big deal back in
16:32
the day and his contract he was so
16:34
wanted
16:35
uh by this team that his agent put a
16:37
clause in the contract that they
16:38
eventually
16:39
the team had to sign and the clause was
16:42
that
16:42
my myra would be paid under all
16:45
conditions and then this is the clause
16:47
up to and including the end of the world
16:51
including including the end of the world
16:53
so if some people survived and he was
16:55
one of them
16:55
and they were one of them they would
16:57
still pay him for all
16:58
the apocalyptic future that they lived
17:01
through imagine if
17:02
they were the last two people on earth
17:05
uh
17:05
i've got a bad deal oh yeah um so
17:08
there's a famous story about the dutch
17:10
buying manhattan island from the native
17:12
americans for a very small amount of
17:13
money
17:14
and them thinking oh these native
17:15
americans they don't understand the
17:17
value of property they don't understand
17:18
the concept of property rights
17:19
uh they absolutely did the problem was
17:22
the dutch brought manhattan from the
17:23
canaani native americans
17:25
who happened to live next door in long
17:27
island
17:28
and did not live in manhattan
17:31
they only used the isle of manhattan to
17:33
get drunk in
17:35
and the dutch showed up and they offered
17:36
to buy the place from these people
17:37
saying is this your place oh great we'll
17:39
buy you this for it so it's like going
17:40
to a pub and offering a random man
17:42
standing outside the pub quite drunk a
17:44
hundred thousand pounds for this
17:45
building
17:46
i got another sporty one uh this is a
17:48
there's a swedish soccer player called
17:50
stefan schwartz do you remember him
17:51
james
17:52
uh so he was paid a four million pound
17:54
deal with sunderland
17:55
for the english premier league the
17:57
condition that he had to sign when he
18:00
was signing
18:00
uh which for him was a bad deal is he
18:02
was not allowed to go to space
18:05
that was the oh oh yeah i always wanted
18:07
to be a space tourist
18:08
he was obsessed with going to space and
18:10
they were like he's obsessed so much we
18:11
just have to say
18:12
no you've got to play football yeah
18:14
we're going to put that in the contract
18:16
i mean that's a deal-breaker too
18:18
is it right um we need to move on to our
18:21
next fact should we do that
18:22
okay it is time for fact number three
18:25
and that
18:25
is andy my fact is that on the bio
18:28
tapestry you can tell how important
18:30
someone is by the size of their horse's
18:32
penis
18:36
um so there's a professor at the
18:37
university of oxford he's called george
18:38
garnett
18:39
he has gone through the bio tapestry the
18:41
whole thing rigorously counting the
18:43
horses
18:43
and their penises uh and there are the
18:46
same number of penises
18:49
well that might be some female horses
18:51
there are some female horses
18:52
i forgot they didn't have penises yeah
19:00
i think they might be hidden by a leg or
19:03
yeah
19:04
sometimes someone's standing in front of
19:05
the horse or a musically holding a bars
19:08
in front
19:09
or the horse is wearing a pair of
19:10
novelty trousers or it's a pantomime
19:13
horse and they famously don't have penis
19:15
well they have two some of them oh
19:16
that's why
19:17
this is a very good point um so he
19:19
counted all of these and he points out
19:20
that
19:21
uh king harold uh who came second in the
19:24
battle of hastings
19:25
he has a horse which has a very large
19:28
penis but there's one
19:30
larger horse penis and that belongs to
19:32
william the conqueror
19:34
so it's it's a clear the man who wins
19:37
the battle has the largest horse's penis
19:39
wow wow and this is new right this is
19:41
this is a branch no no
19:42
66. it wasn't right
19:45
this is this study is new this is new
19:47
research this is breaking this is
19:49
a lot of people in the room this is like
19:50
this is like the spice girls and the
19:52
macarena all over again
19:53
yeah yeah so this is very exciting uh
19:56
previously neglected research
19:58
yeah he counted all the human ones as
20:00
well he did sorry there are
20:01
a four and a half would you say
20:09
but i think what happened was a lot of
20:10
people have kind of paid attention to
20:12
this in the past because
20:13
in victorian times they were all edited
20:15
out yeah and there is one guy who
20:17
had a pair of underpants drawn on him or
20:20
tapestried on him
20:21
by the victorians that was in the in the
20:24
english one right there's an english
20:25
rapper yes sorry in the replica yeah
20:27
exactly but this is the first time
20:29
people have looked at all of them
20:30
including the horse ones yes yeah
20:31
yeah john i couldn't believe the so i i
20:34
don't actually know much about the bail
20:35
tapestry
20:36
um not being english myself so this is
20:38
yeah and it's it's a frequent
20:39
topic of conversation in english i am so
20:42
lost at dinner parties every time it
20:43
comes out walk around the festival site
20:45
here you'll find two or three hundred
20:46
people talking about the buyers yeah
20:48
yeah actually gets a bit boring
20:50
sometimes you know
20:52
so i literally had no knowledge of it
20:54
all so it's fascinating to know that
20:56
this thing
20:57
was a it was uh 68 70 meters long
21:00
which is incredibly long if you put that
21:02
into context um
21:03
that's about 30 meters less than 100 no
21:06
it's like
21:07
that would take usain bolt roughly seven
21:09
seconds to run yeah it's the fastest man
21:11
running at the bayer tapestry the the
21:14
thing is as well is that a
21:16
turns out it's not a tapestry at all no
21:18
it's embroidery
21:20
so it's got the wrong name um but also
21:23
if you read the whole thing up until
21:25
recently when they when they decided to
21:27
fix this
21:28
the final scene is missing imagine
21:30
reading 70 meters of story and getting
21:33
to the final scene and someone's ripped
21:34
the page out
21:35
as in the it's william's coronation
21:38
isn't it
21:38
yeah that's missing and they added it so
21:40
they finished was it 20 2013 i think
21:42
yeah only a few years ago they did it on
21:44
an island on a channel island there was
21:46
over 100 400 people that did it and one
21:48
of the stitches was done by prince
21:49
charles
21:50
um so despite the fact it lives over in
21:52
france
21:53
uh made uh using british royalty wow
21:56
that's cool and a lot of people think it
21:58
was made in britain anyway
22:00
uh in kent and a lot of people think it
22:02
was made completely by women because of
22:04
the penises in fact so
22:05
historians think that there is the
22:08
occasional erect penis on a dead soldier
22:11
and the theory is that the tapestry or
22:14
embroidery was therefore stitched by
22:15
women and the women were ridiculing the
22:17
men
22:17
for the fact that they used war to show
22:19
off their manhood so it was thought to
22:21
be kind of a
22:21
satirical thing women were saying you
22:23
idiots so the people used to fight with
22:25
no trousers
22:26
yeah really yeah yeah yeah yeah this
22:28
time
22:30
wow no it wasn't there was a battle
22:32
wasn't there where the english had
22:33
terrible dysentery or diarrhoea and they
22:35
all took off their trousers
22:36
that was henry the fifth so it was about
22:39
ajikar it was the battlefield yeah right
22:41
but so why are there naked people in
22:43
there if people were trousers the naked
22:44
people are mostly in the margins
22:46
yes so there's the main bit there's a
22:47
main strip of the bio tapestry which
22:49
yeah telling the main story of the
22:50
battle and then at the top and the
22:51
bottom there are these margins
22:52
there's this amazing thing where they're
22:54
um i love the embroidery because you
22:55
when you see old art you assume oh it
22:57
must be done perfect
22:58
you know the perspective and everything
23:00
and there's a couple of moments in the
23:01
tapestry where they've run out of space
23:04
so there's a there's four people holding
23:06
um
23:07
a chest on on four sticks or two sticks
23:09
or other four of them
23:11
and there's three of them that are
23:13
nicely done but they went a bit too high
23:14
on the tapestry so the fourth guy's head
23:17
like just making a quick cameo into the
23:20
tapestry
23:20
uh when really it should have been gone
23:23
my favorite part of the bayou tapestry
23:25
is the bit where odo earl of kent is
23:28
whispering to william telling him what
23:29
to do in the battle
23:31
and it kind of makes him look like he's
23:32
really the important person who was the
23:34
architect of the whole invasion but it
23:36
turns out that it seems like it was him
23:37
who commissioned the tapestry
23:40
and gave himself a massive role in there
23:42
although and he was um
23:44
quite interesting wasn't he because he
23:45
was never seen with spears or anything
23:47
in the tapestry because he was a bishop
23:48
and bishops weren't allowed to shed
23:50
blood so instead he's always seen with a
23:52
massive club
23:53
um so they were allowed to beat people
23:55
around the head which apparently didn't
23:56
draw any blood
23:57
um have you seen the reviews of the bio
24:00
tapestry
24:02
great uh they're well trip advisor
24:05
reviews everything in the world oh okay
24:06
and as with all things the most funny
24:08
reviews are the one star ones
24:10
so there is a complaint actually there
24:11
is actually one star isn't that haley's
24:13
comet
24:16
anyway i feel like you're going to say
24:17
something funny yeah well you know
24:20
thunder stolen um no so the reviews are
24:23
things like so one review says
24:24
we went on a visit to the bayou tapestry
24:26
big learning curve for some people
24:28
we were walking along looking at the
24:30
tapestry not much to see to be honest
24:32
all of a sudden i see a large phallic
24:34
object sewn on the tapestry
24:35
this attraction is not displayed as
24:37
containing adult content
24:39
we have very young children who could
24:41
see the penis which is an outrage
24:43
i wanted to learn about medieval battles
24:45
not medieval penises
24:48
and that's one star one star and there's
24:50
another one star review which just says
24:52
nine quid and 40 minutes to see a carpet
24:54
nah
24:58
on nine quid in seven seconds for
25:00
roosevelt
25:02
it was very blurry
25:03
[Laughter]
25:05
um i like the little touches in the
25:07
tapestry because people used to add kind
25:08
of slide digs at people
25:10
or what they thought of certain figures
25:11
in it um so
25:13
there's one uh there's one really nice
25:15
but actually where harold when harold
25:17
first went over to see willing the
25:18
conqueror in france
25:19
him and his men then got in boats to go
25:21
back across the channel to britain
25:23
and there's such a good picture of him
25:25
and all his men
25:26
holding up their kind of hoes and all
25:28
their stockings and everything and
25:29
they've kept they've taken their shoes
25:30
off they're carrying their shoes
25:32
and they're carrying their pets and
25:33
stuff in their arms because they're
25:34
wading through the water to get to their
25:36
boats
25:37
and it's just it's just exactly like you
25:38
know when you're at a beach and you sort
25:40
of
25:40
wander into
25:44
one person had a dog under his arm and
25:45
another person was holding a bird which
25:47
seems unnecessary
25:53
maybe a helpful war dog or a sniffer dog
25:55
or something
25:56
yeah you know nigel farage wears his
25:59
favorite tie is a bail tapestry tie
26:01
because it reminds him of the last time
26:02
britain was invaded how long is it
26:04
uh it's the same yeah it's an exact
26:07
replica to scale
26:08
yeah right so he's just constantly
26:10
driving behind him he has some
26:11
bridesmaids who carried
26:14
that's interesting because when i was
26:15
looking at um odo bishop of bayer who
26:18
was the guy who commissioned this
26:19
um i went onto the bbc website and they
26:22
said that he was the least popular
26:23
figure
26:24
in kent's history but then i looked up
26:26
other people from kent who were
26:28
unpopular and nigel farage
26:30
is from kent as well as the most
26:32
unpopular person
26:33
nasty nick from big brother one oh
26:36
no way don't tell these guys they didn't
26:38
even know about the spice girls chart
26:40
history yet
26:41
will blow their minds um we should move
26:44
on to our final fact shortly anything
26:45
before we do
26:46
yeah should we go for it okay it is time
26:48
for our final fact of the show
26:50
and that is james okay my fact this week
26:53
is
26:53
that if you're a sloth every time you go
26:56
for a poo
26:57
it's more painful than childbirth
27:00
[Music]
27:03
is that you impersonating chance i was
27:05
just trying it yeah yeah
27:06
yeah is that more people than human java
27:08
i believe it is because actually
27:10
sloth childbirth is not that painful
27:13
because baby slots are super small
27:15
they're about 14 ounces
27:17
um whereas sloth poos are
27:20
at least twice as big maybe more and
27:24
they can lose up to one third of their
27:25
body weights during death oh
27:27
god they do it once a week um it's the
27:30
equivalent
27:31
of if i did a poo that would be
27:34
too big to check into a thompson's
27:37
flight
27:40
i mean what's the purpose of your visit
27:43
for a start
27:47
uh their stomachs physically shrink
27:49
every time they do it
27:51
but how do we has someone laid a woman
27:55
mid labor next to a sloth mid poo
27:58
and what judged the volume of the
28:00
screaming i think how do we know
28:02
you're right i mean to be honest there's
28:04
a bit of you know supposition going on
28:06
here
28:07
but basically it's the size and this is
28:08
what we said this before unlike other
28:10
animals
28:10
um sloths they only do this once a week
28:13
they go down from the bottom of their
28:14
tree
28:15
and they do this and it can take like up
28:17
to 50 days for the food to go through
28:19
the system
28:19
because they're trying to get every
28:20
single bit of nutrients out of it and so
28:22
by the time it comes out it's absolutely
28:24
huge it's just
28:25
fibrous mass and it obviously must be
28:28
extremely painful
28:29
yeah and it's super heavy isn't it so um
28:33
well obviously like a third of their
28:34
body weight and the problem with being a
28:35
sloth is that you're upside down
28:36
basically all of your life
28:38
and so your poo's all gone to the bottom
28:40
waiting to come out
28:41
and then it would the only thing that
28:43
stops it all from crushing
28:44
the the rest of their organs is that um
28:47
their
28:47
bowels and everything like that are
28:49
literally hooked onto their rib cage
28:51
aren't they onto the sides of their body
28:52
because otherwise you know if it was
28:54
loose hanging like ours
28:55
as soon as the sloth turns upside down
28:56
this enormous weight of feces would
28:58
crush all of the rest of its organs so
29:00
all of its organs are kind of
29:01
hooked on to it and then it goes down to
29:04
the bottom of the tree uh does its
29:06
business it goes back up again and
29:07
traveling back up must feel amazing
29:09
wasn't it
29:09
oh yeah they do a little dance uh before
29:13
they have a poo
29:14
every time as well and that's unusual
29:16
for slots is it yeah
29:17
[Laughter]
29:18
why do they uh they have to dig a little
29:20
hole in the ground and it must the
29:21
jiggly must help us now as well i'm sure
29:23
it does yeah yeah
29:24
and the thing is the reason one of the
29:25
reasons we think that they do this just
29:27
once a week
29:28
is because it's extremely dangerous for
29:29
them to go to the toilet because they're
29:31
nice and safe
29:32
in their little tree no one can see them
29:34
they're really well camouflaged they're
29:35
really slow no one can see them move
29:37
but of course when they go down to do
29:38
this they're really kind of vulnerable
29:41
and apparently um more than half of
29:43
sloth fatalities
29:44
occur when they are doing their business
29:47
well that's the thing so they're
29:48
their main predators are both i think
29:51
tigers
29:51
and eagles yeah which is what a
29:54
bad luck right like imagine that being
29:58
your predator
29:58
yeah you've got two predators as i oh so
30:00
it's like a type of ant and a sausage
30:02
dog that'd be fine
30:04
an eagle what what organism are you
30:06
possibly thinking
30:07
[Laughter]
30:09
um so this is a weird thing when they're
30:11
in captivity
30:12
sloths have a poo once every day which
30:15
suggests that they really really want to
30:16
have a poo once every day
30:18
and that in captivity they know they're
30:20
safe they can do because
30:21
because when you're in the wild the
30:22
shame of dying basically they're all
30:24
dying like elvis presley died aren't
30:26
they
30:26
they're half of them dying on the toilet
30:28
you don't want to risk that and we don't
30:30
know why they go down to the bottom well
30:31
there's a there's a great theory oh yeah
30:33
okay so the theory is they have this
30:34
algae on them which grows
30:36
and some of the species of algae are
30:37
specific to a single species of sloth
30:39
so it's quite specific stuff but they're
30:42
in this weird love triangle
30:44
with some algae and some moths so they
30:46
go down to the ground
30:48
there are these moths which live in
30:49
their fur and because sloths move so
30:51
slowly they can never groom themselves
30:52
to get rid of the moths
30:54
because as soon as they move their claw
30:55
over to their arm the moth just walks
30:57
out of the way
30:58
so that's because they can fly months
31:02
yeah exactly it's a bit of a kick in the
31:03
teeth walk away from them i know they
31:05
just stroll off they don't care
31:07
so the the moths lay their eggs
31:10
in the poo of the slots right and then
31:13
the the moths live they fly up when they
31:16
hatch
31:16
into the sloth's fur they live there
31:19
they die
31:20
that algae um that we talked about grows
31:23
because of the nutrients released when
31:25
the moths die
31:26
so the moth dye they release nitrogen
31:28
the algae feeds on that we think that
31:30
the algae is beneficial to the sloths we
31:32
don't know how
31:32
but it's either because it camouflages
31:34
them or because maybe they groom
31:36
themselves and they might eat it
31:37
although that's a bit controversial also
31:39
apparently it contains um some agents
31:41
that kind of work against things like
31:43
malaria
31:44
right okay so whatever whatever it's
31:46
doing is definitely helping the sloth
31:47
survive
31:47
yeah so that's why they need to go down
31:49
is for the moth life cycle
31:51
and then the moth speed the algae and
31:52
the algae help the sloth no well
31:55
i yeah don't risk that just for the sake
31:57
of nurturing a few moths you'd be like
31:59
who
31:59
green all over you and maybe camouflage
32:02
you're maybe not
32:03
no well another theory is that they go
32:06
down and they do their business
32:07
and that is kind of um telling the
32:10
female sloths where they are
32:11
and there's information in that dung
32:13
that tells them that they're fit
32:15
and good people to mate with and so
32:17
maybe it's like a
32:18
sloth tinder kind of thing yeah wow it's
32:21
it's like a reproductive
32:22
system thing where they're going i'm i'm
32:24
fertile i'm ready so
32:25
actually they go down a lot more than
32:27
they usually would when they're ready
32:29
for a child
32:30
and as a result they build this mountain
32:32
of poo
32:33
going i want babies and that's
32:36
that's what they see and they're like
32:37
whoa look look how awesome this is and
32:39
then they go up the tree that is an
32:41
alarming tinder profile
32:42
[Laughter]
32:45
just huge steeping paths and poo every
32:47
single day
32:49
a different pile of poo um if you work
32:51
with sloths you're not allowed to wear
32:52
perfume because their hair is so
32:54
absorbent so they can have algae growing
32:56
inside their own hair
32:57
it's very weird it grows on the outside
32:59
and also on the inside so if you wear
33:01
perfume
33:02
um it can get into their fur basically
33:05
and it stays with them for weeks
33:06
so you're not allowed to wear perfume
33:08
you're not allowed to wear
33:09
things like suntan lotion which is a
33:11
problem because of where they live and
33:12
you're not even allowed to wear
33:13
anti-mosquito spray
33:15
if you're cuddling sloths for a living
33:17
and you have to get very good at
33:18
climbing trees
33:18
apparently because i think the person
33:20
who's done a lot on sloths recently
33:22
who's often a new scientist and stuff is
33:23
someone called rebecca cliff
33:24
who took a tree climbing course um and
33:27
still said that it was impossible she
33:28
was outsmarted and outpaced by the
33:30
sloths because
33:31
by the time she got up the tree they'd
33:33
be on a different tree
33:34
oh wow and she found that she had to get
33:37
guatemalan
33:38
free climbers to go and get this loss
33:40
for her when she wanted to study
33:42
i read one article about sloths entries
33:44
and that is that what they do is
33:46
equivalent you know those um
33:47
gymnasts who do that kind of it's like a
33:50
crucifix position
33:51
on the rings they're like oh yeah yeah
33:53
which is unbelievably hard for humans to
33:55
do apparently sloths just do that
33:56
really easily they can just do all of
33:58
them do that all the time right
34:00
but they do fall out quite a lot do they
34:02
this is one thing she said was uh if you
34:03
see this lot fall out of a tree which
34:05
happens alarmingly often
34:07
i mean they seem to just be popping out
34:09
there was a story that um
34:11
babies would fall out because they'd
34:12
mistake their own limbs for tree
34:14
branches and
34:15
hold on to their limbs and fall but i
34:16
don't know if that's true it's not true
34:18
unfortunately i mean fortunately but
34:20
it's
34:21
no no it's it's probably a myth the
34:23
babies do fall out quite a bit and if
34:25
they do fall out the
34:26
mothers will not go down and get them
34:28
the babies are dead at that point
34:29
whereas they will go down to take a poo
34:31
they will not go down and fetch their
34:32
baby so infant mortality very high
34:35
because
34:35
so i've read they can be really fast if
34:37
they want to be
34:38
really well sorry fast i read that the
34:41
top speed of a sloth
34:43
is 15 miles per hour oh come on
34:46
yeah faster than a cat if they're
34:48
falling out of a tree
34:50
but supposedly i read this from a
34:52
zoologist it's a it's a double bluff
34:54
basically their slowness is real
34:56
it takes them 30 days to digest a leaf
34:58
they are a slow being
35:00
but when something is threatening them
35:01
they're able to be very speedy she said
35:03
faster than a cat can run
35:05
on the street no way yeah probably not
35:08
probably not
35:10
there is um there's a self-help book
35:12
that came out in the last year or so
35:14
called be more sloth
35:16
uh it's by alison davis and she says
35:19
that you should be more still
35:20
um you should turn things upside down be
35:22
more intentional be kind to yourselves
35:24
and be more positive
35:25
which apparently these are all things
35:26
that sloths do and have a very very very
35:29
high fiber diet
35:31
well she says on the front cover the
35:33
winner of the race isn't always the one
35:35
who comes first
35:36
incorrect yeah that's the definition of
35:40
the winner of the race
35:44
okay that's it that is all of our facts
35:45
thank you so much for listening
35:47
if you'd like to get in contact with any
35:49
of us about the things that we have said
35:51
over the course of this podcast

00:17
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:20
no such thing as a fish
00:22
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
00:24
qi offices
00:25
in covent garden my name is dan
00:27
schreiber and i am sitting here with
00:28
anna chazinski
00:30
alex bell and james harkin and once
00:32
again we have gathered around the
00:34
microphones with our four favorite facts
00:36
from the last seven days
00:37
and in no particular order here we go
00:40
starting with you
00:41
czechinski my fact is that the world
00:43
record for the longest time spent
00:45
holding one's breath
00:46
is exactly the same length as this
00:48
podcast episode
00:50
how on earth can we possibly know how
00:52
long this episode's gonna be
00:53
my magic powers and the knowledge that
00:56
you're a good editor
00:57
have told me so tell me how long do i
01:00
have to add it to you
01:01
so you have to add it to 24 minutes and
01:03
three
01:04
seconds if that's okay and this is a
01:06
record that was set by alex segura in
01:08
2016
01:09
and he's a champion in the sport of
01:11
static apnea i can't believe it's a spot
01:13
it's a sword it's the sport of lying
01:17
face down in a swimming pool and holding
01:19
your breath while remaining still that
01:20
feels like something i can get on board
01:22
with for the olympics
01:24
we should say that this record that he
01:25
broke is looked down upon by
01:27
some uh static apnist including himself
01:30
actually because
01:31
this one involved him inhaling pure
01:33
oxygen that means you can hold your
01:34
breath for much longer so that doubles
01:36
the volume of oxygen that you can store
01:37
on your lungs so you breathe oxygen for
01:39
something like 30 minutes before you go
01:40
for the record attempt
01:42
so 24 minutes um that's the length of
01:45
a sitcom episode if you were watching an
01:47
american sitcom
01:49
uh without adverts well is it though
01:51
yeah well not the new netflix series
01:53
style sitcoms but if you go
01:54
classic seinfeld or friends episode
01:56
specifically seinfeld seinfeld is
01:57
getting shorter
01:58
but so the tbs have been caught uh
02:02
broadcasting episodes of seinfeld
02:04
um in fast forward nine percent faster
02:07
than uh
02:08
the original so does he sound like a
02:09
chipmunk no weirdly he doesn't because
02:11
you can get away with like
02:12
maybe up to about 15 percent without
02:15
really noticing it
02:16
if you but if you put them side by side
02:18
obviously like you notice but
02:19
um who does that was alvin and the
02:21
chipmunks originally like four hours
02:23
long
02:27
um that is amazing so you lose what six
02:29
minutes an hour
02:30
yeah yeah yeah exactly so you get you
02:32
get an extra minute or so of adverts for
02:33
each episode
02:34
on sitcoms do you know that the world's
02:36
first sitcom no episode survive of it
02:38
this is just i've only mentioned this
02:40
because it's the kind of thing that
02:40
makes alex really angry
02:42
um but it was on the bbc and it was
02:45
broadcast from 1946 to 47. it was called
02:47
pin rights progress
02:48
and i was just really excited to see it
02:50
because it starts someone called james
02:51
hater
02:52
who played fried tuck in a robin hood
02:54
film that i swear no one else on earth
02:56
has ever seen except me and i recognized
02:57
him
02:58
oh i thought it was because you're a
02:59
james hater
03:01
and that subconsciously i think was the
03:03
reason that i pursued this fact first
03:04
there's a footballer called james hater
03:06
and my brother used to always like him
03:07
because
03:07
my brother's also a james hater there's
03:10
we've got a big club
03:11
um but yeah they've lost all the
03:13
episodes um james hater was also by the
03:15
way the original voice of mr kipling
03:17
makes exceedingly good cakes that's very
03:19
cool um the thing i love
03:21
about this breathing thing is um people
03:24
who do it without oxygen
03:25
uh have gone for about half as long as
03:28
alex segura
03:29
but whoever does it if you really push
03:31
yourself to the limit when you come up
03:33
would you have thought you breathe in or
03:34
out you always breathe out you always
03:36
breathe out right despite why
03:38
whereas there's no oxygen now because
03:39
you have loads of carbon dioxide in your
03:41
bones right well so we always breathe
03:44
out right because
03:45
when you suddenly start getting out of
03:46
breath underwater is because your body
03:48
has this automatic response to having
03:50
too much buildup of carbon dioxide which
03:52
is an emergency response which says
03:54
get up get up breathe breathe breathe
03:55
because if you've got too much carbon
03:56
dioxide it knows you're going to run out
03:57
of oxygen
03:58
but all these champion static apneas
04:01
have learned to totally override that
04:02
response
04:03
so they go underwater they hold their
04:05
breaths and the oxygen just gets
04:06
absorbed and absorbed and absorbed
04:08
so by the time they come up they need to
04:10
breathe in straight away
04:11
so that's how you spot the difference
04:12
between an expert and an amateur we
04:14
breathe out and they breathe in
04:15
i suppose the other way of spotting an
04:16
amateur versus expert is the expert
04:18
comes up 24 minutes later
04:22
i was reading that insects often hold
04:24
their breath
04:25
and they do it for hours and even days
04:27
at a time and the reason is is that too
04:29
much air would actually kill them
04:31
so they're actually stopping air from
04:32
coming in to save their lives
04:34
because too much of it damages their
04:36
tissues so it's simply a process of
04:38
stopping so too much oxygen damages them
04:40
yeah exactly they subsidize do they like
04:42
rust
04:44
that's why they're all a bit brown sexy
04:46
yeah
04:47
they're all rusty they're all just rusty
04:49
yeah
04:50
but yeah if you see an insect it's most
04:52
likely holding its breath
04:54
so cool um i was reading a 2016 savage
04:58
university study about
04:59
sighing and sighing is really
05:00
interesting so like sighing is basically
05:02
just
05:03
a breathing in and then breathing in
05:04
again instead of breathing out so you're
05:06
just taking in twice as much air
05:07
and the reason you do it one of the
05:08
reasons you do it is to inflate the
05:11
alveoli
05:12
more than it usually gets because your
05:14
obviously always sort of
05:15
collapsing like like the tiny little
05:17
sacks on the edge of your lungs that
05:19
absorb the oxygen into the rest of your
05:20
body on there yeah lots of different
05:21
alveolar just collapsing on their own
05:23
and so they periodically need to just be
05:25
reinflated with a massive amount of air
05:27
in your lungs and that's what you're
05:28
signing it i always thought i sighed
05:29
because i was
05:30
really fed up with the 29th punt in a
05:32
row that james had told but it's
05:33
actually just all about my alveoli
05:36
james hater
05:40
and what's really interesting is that
05:42
when they originally built iron lungs
05:43
which are the
05:44
coffin like uh things that you put
05:47
people in when they're having breathing
05:48
difficulties and it's basically
05:49
a pressure chamber that that forces
05:52
people to breathe from the outside
05:54
um the mechanism didn't account for
05:55
sighing as in the iron lung didn't sigh
05:57
it only did normal breathing in and out
05:59
and people kept dying and this is when
06:01
they realized this is what accounted for
06:02
it because they're they
06:03
like themselves to death no they didn't
06:05
sign themselves to death because they
06:06
weren't signed because the
06:07
the iron lung was only doing normal
06:08
breathing for them and it wasn't doing
06:10
some sort of sigh
06:11
if we didn't sigh we'd die if you don't
06:13
smile you die yeah that should be on
06:14
signs everywhere
06:17
it is a subconscious reflex hannah you
06:18
don't usually need to advertise those
06:20
i don't have sides everywhere going
06:22
don't forget to breathe
06:24
keep blinking sometimes i need these
06:27
[Laughter]
06:32
things
06:34
[Music]
06:36
okay it is time for fact number two and
06:39
that
06:40
is alex my fact this week is that nikola
06:43
tesla was one of the guests at the first
06:46
ever party with a stripper jumping out
06:48
of a cake
06:49
amazing incredible it's a really cool
06:51
party what was he doing there
06:53
um well he was just one of sort of
06:55
several quite prominent guests um this
06:57
was a party uh thrown by a guy called
06:59
stamford white who was a sort of member
07:00
of the
07:01
new york elites at the end of the 19th
07:03
century
07:04
really interesting character himself
07:06
actually controversial character as well
07:08
yeah yeah so he threw all sorts of sort
07:11
of exciting dinner parties and drinks
07:12
parties like this and this one was on
07:15
may the 20th 1895 and
07:18
one of the attractions of this party was
07:20
um a scantily clad girl
07:23
called susie johnson we actually know
07:24
her name emerging from a pie
07:26
made from galvanized iron accompanied by
07:28
a recitation of sing a song of sixpence
07:31
yeah well plus birds right i think birds
07:33
flew out along with her didn't they
07:35
actually yeah the birds that came out
07:38
were canaries
07:40
and in the movie of this which i watched
07:41
the other night for research what's it
07:43
called it's called the girl on the
07:44
velvet swing oh yeah
07:45
starring joan collins as um the
07:48
character who is basically susie johnson
07:50
the guy comes in and he's like oh sorry
07:51
i couldn't find any black birds but i've
07:53
got canaries
07:54
oh really yeah the girl was it also like
07:56
i couldn't find a velvet swing but i've
07:58
got a cast iron cake
07:59
[Laughter]
08:00
well we'll probably get to this in a bit
08:02
right it was like sexy like sing a song
08:04
or six months because i can't work out
08:05
how you
08:06
can be honest the bit with the pie i
08:08
kind of left the room and went to my
08:10
kitchen to get a drink and when i came
08:11
back i think i missed the pipes
08:14
but the rest of it is all about this guy
08:15
um stanford white who like dan's about
08:17
to say is very controversial
08:19
yeah very controversial uh the reason
08:20
for the title of the velvet swing is to
08:22
do with his controversiality
08:24
uh he used to like to sneak girls back
08:27
to
08:27
a house of his in manhattan and uh
08:30
no no good way of saying it drug and
08:32
rape them that was
08:34
that was his very bad human and uh the
08:36
girl on the velvet swing refers to
08:38
a girl who he did this to when she was
08:40
age 16. yes because her
08:42
husband uh who i think's name was thor
08:46
not far as in the norse god thought as
08:48
in what happens to snow when it's warm
08:50
yes um he then she's very confused in
08:53
the cinema i saw a very boring film that
08:54
i was very much looking forward to
08:56
the marvel movie where it's just snow
08:57
melting
09:00
um he was at a theater performance of
09:03
um mammoesel champagne's i could love a
09:05
million girls
09:06
and then thor came over and shot
09:08
stamford white in the face
09:09
yeah and this was in about 1905 wasn't
09:11
it but this is why
09:12
this whole jumping out of cake thing
09:14
became well known because
09:15
in the court case everyone suddenly read
09:18
about this amazing cake woman party
09:20
and then i guess it became a thing
09:22
imagine that's a bit of your obituary
09:24
that sticks out
09:25
so you've just been murdered by a
09:26
millionaire uh in a
09:28
in the public space and then everyone's
09:30
like what's this cake bit
09:32
that sounds pretty cool he made history
09:34
in the sort of
09:36
in the industry of raunchy parties yeah
09:38
yeah he's done the world of service
09:40
in his murder but he did the world of
09:41
disservice because there were more
09:43
repercussions afterwards so
09:45
the whole thing was covered by a
09:46
journalist called meryl goddard
09:48
and then meryl goddard was so good at
09:50
covering this case
09:52
that randolph hearst who was a newspaper
09:54
proprietor
09:55
decided to take her for his newspaper
09:57
she was working with pulitzer
09:59
and then hearst and pulitzer had a
10:00
massive competition against each other
10:02
for who could get the most readers for
10:04
their newspaper
10:05
and that turned into sensational
10:06
journalism and that's why we have red
10:08
top journalism today wow and it all came
10:10
from there
10:10
so um your fact says she jumped out of a
10:13
cake it was a pie
10:15
sorry when did it become cake it was a
10:17
pie i mean that's it was like was it a
10:19
crusted
10:19
top pie in the movie it's like it looks
10:22
like one of those you know where it's
10:23
got crisscross of pastry on the top yeah
10:25
but that might just be for the movies i
10:28
guess i guess it makes sense that
10:30
what traditionally there's like it like
10:32
in banquets and stuff
10:33
in sort of medieval times you've got
10:35
very elaborate pies and things come out
10:36
of pies yeah and then it becomes more of
10:38
a tradition to do things at parties and
10:39
at parties we now have cake so they just
10:41
said well why don't we have people
10:42
jumping out cakes it's a bit weird to
10:44
have a pie
10:45
like a birthday party but i guess cakes
10:47
are more practical to jump out of
10:48
and to hide to hide in really because
10:50
they can be taller you can have a tall
10:51
pie yeah yeah
10:52
i don't think so i think basically i
10:54
mean i'd be suspicious if i saw a really
10:56
tall puppy like there's a person in
10:57
there whereas you can have
10:58
you have
11:03
you would suspend suspicion that there's
11:05
a human in there and think this is
11:06
probably okay
11:08
it could be a big cake can i give my
11:10
favorite jumping out of a pie incident
11:12
yes please
11:12
um so this was one of the earliest ones
11:14
i think it was in 1454 and it was when
11:16
things being hidden in pies was used as
11:18
a rallying cry of the christians against
11:20
the ottomans
11:21
so this was kind of during the era of
11:22
the crusades it was
11:24
king philip who through this really
11:26
really elaborate banquet with sort of
11:27
jousting and these amazing table
11:29
decorations that we've talked about
11:30
before and then he led everyone into
11:32
this really long table and on the table
11:33
he had this giant pie and the pie
11:35
opened up mechanically to reveal 28
11:37
playing musicians
11:38
so an orchestra of 28 people who leapt
11:41
out of the part and played
11:42
do you think if you saw a cake that size
11:44
you'd think just a normal cake
11:46
well if i have music coming out of it
11:48
there's something else going on maybe
11:50
not people inside but you know
11:51
we don't know what song they played we
11:53
don't know what song they played
11:54
although we do know at that same party
11:55
there was a statue of a beautiful woman
11:57
who had wine springing from her breast
11:59
that people could drink from um at this
12:01
party stamford white's party yeah
12:03
he was serving wine but he had a blonde
12:06
waitress who only served white wine and
12:08
a brunette who only served red wine
12:10
really that's quite nice it's like
12:13
having a lid to match the bottle
12:15
kind of thing i know what you're saying
12:16
but then on the other hand it's not very
12:18
woke is it
12:19
it's slightly objectifying these women
12:21
i'll give you that but as we've
12:22
established this guy doesn't have the
12:23
best track record with uh
12:25
with wyverd susie johnson the lady who
12:27
jumped out of the pie cake
12:29
we don't know what happened to her she's
12:31
another mystery in the whole story she
12:32
disappeared people try to track her down
12:34
because she became as you say we know
12:36
her name they just check
12:37
[Laughter]
12:42
multiple weddings ruined once again
12:46
the cake police swoop in
12:54
[Music]
12:56
okay it's time for fact number three and
12:58
that is my fact
12:59
my fact this week is that when in london
13:01
queen louise of sweden
13:03
always carried a card saying i am the
13:05
queen of sweden
13:06
in case she was hit by a bus
13:10
cocky yeah well what she used to travel
13:13
around london
13:14
as it were in disguise she didn't go
13:16
around with an entourage she loved
13:17
shopping and so she would just go on her
13:19
own
13:19
and one time she was almost hit by a bus
13:22
as a result
13:22
she decided god if i was hit by this bus
13:25
how would people know who i was
13:26
why don't i carry a card inside my
13:28
handbag that says i am the queen of
13:30
sweden and then they'll be like
13:32
and then the people who found her rather
13:33
than going i guess we'll just leave her
13:34
there we don't really care
13:36
oh hang on she's the queen we better
13:38
sort out this car accident situation
13:39
also it's a really weird reaction to
13:41
have when you're about to be hit by a
13:42
bus the normal reaction is wow i should
13:43
be more careful crossing the road
13:45
when that inevitably happens again i
13:46
better make sure i'm properly labelled
13:48
well you're the only one that i know of
13:49
who's uh
13:51
almost been hit by a bus how did you how
13:53
did you react
13:54
they shouted at the bus what did you
13:56
chat go back to bus school
13:59
this is one of the greatest anecdotes in
14:01
qi history
14:02
that comes up basically everywhere in
14:04
shock
14:05
go back to bus school that's the
14:08
greatest line ever
14:11
would you keep that in the card in your
14:14
handbag
14:17
wouldn't it be amazing though if when
14:18
whenever you call 999 if you find
14:20
someone unconscious on the floor you
14:21
call 999 and they say okay cool so first
14:23
things first have you looked through
14:24
their handbag
14:25
and have you checked their business
14:26
cards is it the queen of sweden okay
14:29
this has happened before
14:30
[Laughter]
14:32
she was really great though queen louise
14:34
of sweden yeah
14:36
in her first passport um it had a thing
14:38
called special peculiarities where you
14:40
put things about your face if you have a
14:41
scar or whatever
14:42
and she wrote walks like a parrot really
14:46
she's um just to put her into a bit of
14:48
context she is the
14:50
auntie of prince philip yes and it was
14:53
so she was the mountbatten
14:54
family formerly battenberg's wasn't she
14:56
blattenberg who hurriedly changed their
14:57
name to mountbatten when the germans
14:59
became the bad guys
15:00
yeah um yeah and she was the great
15:03
granddaughter of queen victoria i think
15:04
yeah but
15:05
all the european royal families are all
15:06
just related to each other aren't they
15:08
they are really
15:09
and during world war ii um because all
15:12
of the royal families are all related to
15:13
each other but then they were in
15:15
all in countries that were all fighting
15:16
against each other she worked as a
15:17
messenger kind of
15:19
giving messages between all of her
15:20
family she wasn't allowed to talk to
15:22
each other not a spy
15:24
i suppose you could call it a spy
15:25
couldn't you i mean it's pretty much a
15:27
basically a double agent but i think she
15:29
was doing it quite explicitly and not
15:31
sitting on a bench handing over a
15:32
message and they're like i am the queen
15:34
of sweden what does this mean i'm sorry
15:37
and presumably it was more like bobby
15:38
just had a baby rather than
15:40
i think the nazis are on their way
15:42
across the channel yeah the swedish
15:44
royal family is quite interesting though
15:45
and the modern swedish royal family is
15:46
as well
15:47
so there's carl the 16th who's king now
15:50
who i don't think we've ever said on the
15:51
podcast is
15:53
the tenth king carl of sweden who did
15:55
they miss out
15:56
um they they added lots it goes back to
15:59
the 15th century when a guy called
16:00
johann
16:01
magnus wrote this sort of uh fanciful
16:03
history of all the swedish kings and he
16:05
just added a whole bunch of kings so he
16:07
made up wow
16:07
he made up six eric's and six carls um
16:10
and they've kept that
16:12
um numerical system ever since but why
16:14
were they referring to this
16:15
fictional account as history because it
16:17
became really popular it was a bit like
16:18
the sagas you know it became a thing
16:20
that was always red
16:21
i think it's like we have king arthur so
16:24
if we were to have a new king arthur we
16:26
would probably call him arthur the
16:26
second wouldn't we oh i'd love to see
16:29
and if if um prince harry became king he
16:31
would be henry ix
16:33
he'd be our first henry since the
16:35
dreaded henry viii well if he kept the
16:36
name right although sometimes you take
16:38
on a different name when you become
16:39
royal because prince charles will
16:41
yes we think become henry he won't
16:44
become charles no we were discussing
16:45
this
16:46
we had a party last week at my place
16:48
which you were invited to but you didn't
16:49
come
16:50
and it was so exciting that we started
16:52
talking about the regular numbers at the
16:53
kings and queens
16:54
we were so sorry i couldn't make it
16:56
because it's kind of great
16:57
edward the ninth i think we found that
17:00
was what you thought
17:00
that's what the bookies reckon is it i
17:02
think so um i should quickly add just
17:04
about the
17:04
the main fact itself um i've read this
17:07
in a few places found a few sources but
17:09
nothing that i would say is concrete
17:11
enough that i truly i want to see the
17:13
card
17:14
and if anyone knows if the card exists
17:16
so the
17:17
sauce for this the original sauce was
17:18
queen louise's niece dollar
17:20
um who was the marg ravine of baden i
17:23
don't know what that means
17:25
anyway it was a relative who first said
17:26
this yeah okay that's a good source
17:28
thank you
17:29
thank you all for uh
17:32
[Laughter]
17:35
[Applause]
17:39
[Music]
17:42
okay it is time for our final fact of
17:44
the show and that is james
17:46
okay my fact this week is that last year
17:48
in the uk
17:49
two eight-year-olds were caught speeding
17:52
this came from a freedom of information
17:55
question um that was posed to the driver
17:56
and vehicle licensing agency
17:58
and they asked for all of the different
18:00
statistics and they also found out that
18:02
900 people in their 90s got penalty
18:04
points for speeding last year
18:05
including three people aged 99 wow
18:09
although i reckon 99. that's the oldest
18:12
but it's quite coincidence that it's 99
18:13
and 100 and something so i reckon anyone
18:15
that's over 99 they just put 99 maybe
18:17
there's only two
18:18
spaces in the um form or something oh
18:20
wow yeah i reckon
18:21
or you just don't find someone who's a
18:24
hundred or more for speeding
18:25
you just ask their agent fair enough
18:27
mate go on unfair that you
18:29
you dock the 99 year old though well you
18:32
know one more year in your
18:33
your home yeah you've got to hang on to
18:34
your 100th birthday that's like
18:36
saying unfair that you won't let the 15
18:38
year old smoke when the 16 year old's
18:39
allowed to i mean you've got to draw the
18:40
line somewhere haven't you okay
18:42
sure 99 that's a line sorry i also think
18:44
the smoking age might have gone up since
18:46
i was a smoker so
18:47
16 year olds if it's illegal just check
18:52
or you know whatever don't smoke
18:57
there have been quite a lot of weird
18:58
speeding fines um and driving fines this
19:01
year
19:02
so um there have been two instances of
19:04
people getting caught driving to the
19:06
hospital because their wives are in
19:07
labor
19:07
and getting stopped for speeding and so
19:09
one was in the uk going at 101 miles an
19:11
hour
19:12
and then there was another guy in the us
19:14
who missed the birth of his child
19:15
because he was taken to a cell
19:16
oh no yeah oh that's hard it's really
19:19
rough because in the movies
19:20
there's no repercussions when you see
19:22
them breaking all the laws to get to
19:23
yeah
19:24
the police officers usually like on the
19:25
contrary i'll give you an escort which
19:26
has never happened
19:28
that happened to me once in oldham
19:30
really i wasn't speeding but i was stuck
19:32
and then the police gave me a lift to
19:34
the football game because they thought
19:35
i'd miss the game
19:36
and they put their siren on and they're
19:37
probably not allowed to do this but they
19:39
put the siren on and everyone moved out
19:40
of the way and we flew through all them
19:43
just to get you to the yeah how are you
19:45
stuck
19:46
uh we got off at the wrong train station
19:49
nothing even went wrong that's just bad
19:52
travelling on your part it's just
19:53
awesome policing by the policeman who's
19:55
probably
19:56
absolutely nothing else going on in
19:57
oldham if they're just doing that just
19:59
being like are you where are you going
20:00
can we give you a lift
20:01
yeah sean connery was once um stopped
20:04
for speeding by an officer named
20:05
sergeant james bond
20:06
no you're right wow
20:10
that's good i really hope he did the
20:12
names
20:13
bond james bond but i'm going to see
20:15
your license to kill
20:19
and then your actual license
20:23
we have in our in our book we've got a
20:25
similar sort of story
20:27
it's called the book of the year 2018
20:29
your definitive guide to the weird
20:30
world's weirdest news you know when it
20:32
comes out uh yeah october the 18th
20:34
okay where is it available it's going to
20:35
be in bookshops it's going to be online
20:37
um yeah andy's not here we could say
20:38
amazon amazon it's going to be on amazon
20:41
yes this is the first i've heard of this
20:43
remember we found that thing of the guy
20:45
who was done for drink driving but
20:47
claimed that he wasn't drink driving
20:49
because he was only drinking every time
20:50
he got to a traffic stop side
20:54
so let's stop have a swig are they going
20:56
to go this is
20:57
sorry no you guys just sawing i just
20:59
want to stay alive
21:02
um did you know the first person to pass
21:04
a driving test was called mr beer
21:07
in 1935 uh he paid 37.5 p
21:10
just uh found that out and also i found
21:12
out this weird thing that driving tests
21:13
were suspended in the second world war
21:15
which makes sense
21:16
um they were spend suspended again
21:17
during the suez crisis
21:19
um which is quite weird and especially
21:20
given that during the sewers crisis
21:22
um learners were allowed to drive
21:23
unaccompanied and i think
21:25
i don't know about serious crisis but
21:27
it's definitely true the second world
21:28
war that if you
21:29
learned to drive during the war they
21:31
just gave you a license you didn't need
21:32
to take a test at all
21:33
well just because you've been through
21:35
the wall you've learned how to drive
21:37
you're obviously if you could drive
21:38
enough to defeat the nazis then you
21:40
could drive enough to go if you can
21:41
drive a tank through a minefield and not
21:43
get blown up i think you can manage the
21:45
m25
21:46
speaking of tanks um i read this
21:48
yesterday so
21:50
you're allowed to drive a tank on the
21:51
road in the uk
21:53
um you need a special license but if you
21:56
could get a provisional license
21:58
which is really easy a provisional tank
22:00
license then as long as there's someone
22:01
sat next to you who can drive a tank
22:03
then you can drive a tank through the
22:04
streets of the uk
22:06
at any time but you need to have learner
22:08
plates on the tank
22:09
but you will be able to that's i knew
22:12
that because the qri's production
22:13
coordinator was telling me a great story
22:14
about how she had to get james blunt to
22:15
drive a tank through the bbc
22:18
that was yeah because he was an army guy
22:20
so he knows how to drive a tank
22:22
yeah but where do you get a tank this
22:23
still feels like the main stumbling
22:24
block
22:26
yeah she just knew a guy yeah who's your
22:29
buddy ed
22:30
um you've met ed once we met him outside
22:32
uh burger show yeah yeah
22:34
yeah yeah his name's ed superior and
22:38
he's
22:41
he used to have it parked outside ash
22:42
gardner of emprees's house they were
22:44
neighbors and outside was his tank
22:46
well we used to go and sit inside it he
22:47
made it into this really nice um
22:49
sort of you know where you have netflix
22:51

00:15
hello
00:16
and welcome to another episode of no
00:18
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:21
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:22
covent garden
00:24
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
00:25
here with andrew hunter murray
00:27
james harkin and anna chazinski and once
00:30
again we have gathered around the
00:31
microphones with our four
00:33
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:35
and in no particular order
00:37
here we go starting with my fact this
00:40
week
00:40
my fact is that the legendary sumo
00:43
wrestler
00:44
my numi injected silicone
00:47
into his scalp so that he could meet the
00:49
height requirements
00:50
to become a sumo what were they so this
00:53
was
00:54
you had to be 173 centimeters tall this
00:57
was back
00:58
in the day um up until the 90s so that
01:01
was the height requirements
01:02
about five foot nine yeah i believe
01:04
that's about five foot nine yeah
01:05
and so a lot of wrestlers were very
01:06
close five foot eight five foot seven
01:08
and they just weren't quite there 172
01:11
centimeters
01:13
and so what they used to do and this is
01:14
what this wrestler uh shuhei did
01:17
he went to a doctor and he had
01:18
surgically inserted into his scalp
01:20
a little bag that could be filled with
01:22
silicon and the silicon would go
01:24
up to four centimeters high the other
01:26
thing that they used to do before the
01:27
silicon thing was bash themselves on the
01:29
head so they get a lump
01:31
which would then be just you know like
01:32
in a cartoon no
01:35
wow that's what they genuinely don't get
01:36
that you can't guarantee you're gonna
01:38
bruise like that
01:39
i would i would concentrate on growing
01:40
hair instead of beating myself on the
01:42
head
01:43
no but they push they push a ruler down
01:46
on your head yeah also all summers have
01:47
that
01:48
quite flat hair don't they yes yeah
01:51
so um this guy i just want to apologize
01:53
if i've pronounced his name wrong in
01:55
fact
01:55
i'm just going to refer to him by his
01:57
nickname i think yeah you should worry
01:59
about him because he's pretty tall these
02:00
days
02:01
he's definitely have you in a fight yeah
02:03
he's like seven foot tall now
02:04
yeah it's fine he keeps going yeah no he
02:07
doesn't
02:08
want to you get one enlargement and then
02:10
after a while it's not enough exactly
02:12
yeah so he has a nickname which he's
02:14
known by to the fans which is waza
02:16
no de pato uh translates roughly as
02:18
department store of techniques
02:20
so i will refer to him why do you think
02:22
you could say
02:23
what the nickname easier than you can
02:25
say my name is you i actually just flew
02:26
over that
02:27
and then headed straight to the
02:28
department store of techniques the
02:30
department store of technique he was an
02:31
amazing guy so he was known for using 33
02:34
different what they call
02:35
kimmerite uh which are basically
02:37
finishing moves
02:38
um he did one which was a triple attack
02:41
force out
02:42
so he simultaneously trapped the guy's
02:44
leg grabbed another and pushed his head
02:46
into
02:47
his chest the opponent's head into the
02:48
opponent's chest
02:50
sorry what he pushed his opponent's head
02:52
into his opponent's chest
02:54
yeah so he brought his head down in
02:55
there while tripping him up and while
02:57
grabbing a leg and that's called a
02:58
triple threat
02:59
so it's kind of like you're forcing
03:00
someone into a into a forwards roll sort
03:02
of thing
03:02
you trip them over and then you bend
03:04
their head down yeah so you don't push
03:06
their head
03:06
just straight down so again which means
03:10
maybe that they then
03:11
don't meet the height requirement or
03:13
automatic win
03:16
these days you can qualify through speed
03:18
and agility as well as height
03:20
or instead of height yeah if you're
03:22
really fast really agile and tiny
03:26
um there's there is one move in sumo one
03:29
technique
03:30
called henka which i don't know if this
03:32
guy did but it's the way that
03:34
um the winner of the sumo championships
03:36
in 2016
03:37
won it and the hanker is when your rival
03:40
like hurtles towards you super fast to
03:42
take you down and then you just step to
03:43
the side like you're in a cartoon and
03:44
your rival goes plummeting out of the
03:46
ring
03:47
and then you win that way does he run
03:48
out of the ring and then not realize
03:50
he's actually
03:51
above the ground for a few seconds yes
03:54
exactly and eyeballs pop out of his head
03:56
and stuff
03:58
but the thing about this move is that
04:00
even though it's a winning move it's
04:01
really frowned upon so sumo is a lot
04:03
about honor and respect
04:04
and you get booed by the crowds for
04:05
doing this so he won this championship
04:07
he's called hakuho
04:09
and he was massively booed by the crowds
04:11
a lot of them left before even listening
04:12
to his victory speech
04:13
and when he gave his post-match speech
04:15
he just immediately apologized he was on
04:16
the verge of tears and said you know i
04:18
never thought that i'd win doing that
04:20
move
04:20
but i guess i guess i did wow sorry
04:24
um you know they all have this sort of
04:25
bun of hair yeah they have the same bun
04:28
um i have read i can't quite believe
04:29
this but i've read that
04:31
they're the only um you have to have
04:33
that bun and if you're not in the game
04:35
you're not allowed to have the bun
04:36
and when you retire your bun gets cut
04:37
off by your friends and family and
04:40
colleagues and your trainer cuts the
04:41
last strand of the bun
04:42
so that's when you retire but there are
04:44
only 55
04:45
master hairdressers who are allowed to
04:48
do this bun that's very cool yeah
04:50
and so what they trained they're trained
04:52
specifically as hairdressers in the art
04:54
of
04:54
that one specific thing we've reached
04:56
the limits of my knowledge
04:58
okay and we've had amazing things we've
04:59
hurtled beyond it
05:01
the ritual when they cut it off is a
05:02
major thing though isn't it there's
05:03
often crying there oh it's really
05:05
like emotional emotional people very sad
05:07
yeah losing your butt
05:08
i suppose your whole life is being a
05:10
sumo isn't it like that's all they do
05:12
yeah you can't do anything else yeah and
05:13
that's the symbol of it yeah
05:15
what's the symbol of doing this podcast
05:17
typing with your hands i suppose
05:18
yeah so we'll put your fingers off at
05:20
the end i'd cry
05:22
yeah for the last episode we all have to
05:23
cut off cut each other's fingers off
05:25
yeah i think it's just taking our
05:27
microphone yes
05:31
[Laughter]
05:34
you know sumos before they start a fight
05:35
they clap their hands and they do that
05:37
thing where they'll clap and then they
05:38
spread their arms out really wide
05:40
do you know why they do that is it to
05:41
make themselves look bigger to their
05:43
opponents so they're more scared
05:45
it definitely does serve that purpose
05:46
and the way they do it doesn't imply
05:48
that's the reason but officially is to
05:49
show that you're not armed
05:51
because you can't you can't be armed in
05:54
sumo i think also the stamping
05:56
that they do is to drive away evil
05:57
spirits or it traditionally is
05:59
and therefore it survives as a kind of
06:00
remnant of that yeah because they also
06:02
sprinkle salt don't they on the
06:03
on the ring before going into it which
06:05
is also to purify it and don't allow
06:07
women in
06:08
yeah to purify it as well that is right
06:10
though isn't it that's what they say
06:12
yes and there were two women went in
06:13
this year in the news
06:15
and i can't remember what happened
06:18
basically a guy had a heart attack
06:20
yeah or something like that they passed
06:22
out the women jumped in they were
06:23
qualified
06:24
doctors and nurses and they jumped in
06:25
and they immediately got told to get out
06:27
of there yeah
06:28
this guy was dying and then because
06:30
they've been women in there they had to
06:31
throw a load of extra salt in
06:33
yeah yeah and then during the fight they
06:35
were skidding around on the salt
06:36
and it ruined the whole map it proves
06:38
it's bad luck there was a guy who was
06:40
known for
06:40
the salt particularly he used to throw
06:42
just a lot of salt on the uh
06:45
in the ring so his name was salt shaker
06:46
that was his nickname and
06:48
um yeah and that was sort of his
06:50
pre-match ritual which became his
06:52
thing is it related to the fact that you
06:54
throw salt over your shoulder so do you
06:55
throw a thought of your left shoulder
06:56
whenever you
06:57
eat salt yeah a little bit um whatever
06:59
you eat salt yeah
07:00
my dad's always done it's a huge waste
07:02
we actually we do it when we spill
07:03
something
07:04
that's when you spilled salt it's bad
07:05
luck to spill salt
07:07
oh right therefore you have to throw a
07:09
bit more over your shoulder
07:11
um to counteract the evil but i also do
07:13
it if i have too much salt in my hands
07:15
when i'm cooking and i have a bit left
07:16
over it goes over the shoulder rather
07:17
than in the bin
07:18
yeah under the pretense of doing it for
07:20
good luck when really you're just too
07:21
lazy to bother actually clearing up
07:23
i actually do that with old kitchen
07:24
waste
07:28
um just something on height restrictions
07:30
so i do you know that mi5 has height
07:32
restrictions
07:33
no and these were introduced in 2004
07:36
and it makes a lot of sense so as a man
07:39
you're not allowed to be taller than
07:40
five for 11 as a woman you're not
07:41
allowed to be taller than five for eight
07:43
which is actually you know a lot of men
07:44
are obviously taller than five eleven
07:46
but it's just so you don't stand out as
07:47
much in a crowd
07:49
but literally yeah literally i wonder
07:52
how tall
07:52
the james bond's i thought you might ask
07:54
that you've heard an answer did you
07:56
yeah have you got them all i have yeah
07:58
um but remember the mi6
08:00
i know that so is it is mi6 have
08:02
different height requirements apparently
08:03
mi6 has unofficial ones which are quite
08:05
similar but mi5s were official but all
08:06
the james bond would not have been able
08:08
to get into
08:09
uh the secret service under these rules
08:11
except for daniel craig who just slots
08:13
in under so i think he's five foot ten
08:15
and a quarter
08:16
um and all the others are taller than
08:17
511. could you have like part of your
08:19
head removed to keep you underneath
08:22
oh that may be more conspicuous i guess
08:24
if you have a flat head no but if you
08:26
always wore a very boring hat
08:28
but that would make you seem taller yeah
08:30
that's true maybe you need to cut off
08:32
the bottom of your feet
08:33
yeah well i was going to say i would
08:35
have my feet extended as a sumo rather
08:37
than my head
08:38
because it's much less dangerous having
08:39
foot surgery extended as in like heels
08:42
yeah platforms platforms wow that's cool
08:45
that would be a very good thing for a
08:46
super villain to do to jane's pond it's
08:48
just instead of killing him just give
08:49
him massive leg extensions
08:51
yeah internally so he's seven foot nine
08:52
and he can't go anywhere conspicuously
08:54
again
08:55
and they are making a new james bond
08:57
don't they yeah presumably there's still
08:59
time to slip that into the
09:00
secret i think they're looking for a
09:01
director at the moment oh yeah cause
09:03
danny bailey's not doing it i think the
09:04
first
09:05
poor person directed james vodka
09:10
i was reading in china that if you want
09:12
to become a teacher you have to be a
09:13
certain height as well
09:14
school teachers so this was a story that
09:16
the bbc published this year about a lady
09:18
who had qualified for her teaching
09:21
um certificate she'd done the years of
09:23
of studying
09:24
and at graduation they measured her and
09:26
she wasn't tall enough you can't teach
09:28
if you're under four foot nine speaking
09:30
of restrictions in china
09:32
so theme park rides often have a height
09:34
restriction but there's a new theme park
09:36
ride in china
09:37
or a new restriction on it which is a
09:38
weight restriction
09:40
um but this is more that you have to be
09:42
over a certain weight in order to ride
09:44
for free
09:45
so this is a theme park called tang
09:46
paradise park and it gives free entry to
09:49
any woman who's fatter than this really
09:50
famous really
09:51
respected and admired concubine called
09:53
yang gui faye
09:55
who's an eighth century consort and
09:56
she's like one of china's four great
09:58
beauties apparently
09:59
and if you're heavier than she is uh so
10:01
she was 61.8 kilos you ride for free
10:04
and it's trying to destigmatize um
10:07
chubbiness
10:08
but you do have to get on a giant pair
10:10
of weighing scales before you get on the
10:12
ride
10:12
yeah does that do the job it's kind of a
10:14
shaming it's a real fat shaming but
10:16
here's your consolation prize a roller
10:18
coaster
10:18
and i should say a poster of emotions
10:27
[Music]
10:29
okay there's time for fact number two
10:31
and that is
10:32
james okay my fact this week is that a
10:34
quarter of all mentions of teeth
10:37
in the bible also include the word
10:39
gnashing
10:41
i mainly know the word nation from nasha
10:43
dennis is
10:44
dog in the bino i reckon he got his name
10:47
from the biblical word
10:48
i guess he must have done he was very
10:50
devout
10:53
um so for the qi factbook um
10:56
i had to find a fact which was related
10:58
to both teeth and the bible because
11:00
all the facts are in order and so i went
11:01
onto the bible gateway and searched the
11:04
king james bible for mentions of teeth
11:06
and there are 56 that i found and 15 of
11:09
them have the word
11:09
nash in one of its various forms and the
11:12
first one
11:13
is in job and he says he teareth me in
11:16
his wrath who hateth me he gnasheth upon
11:18
me with his teeth
11:20
my enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me so
11:23
basically just
11:24
it's a lot of gnashing of teeth a lot of
11:25
people go to hell a lot of people you
11:27
know
11:28
not so happy in the bible is gnashing of
11:29
teeth is that like
11:31
yeah it's like grinding your teeth in
11:33
and usually it's in anger or in pain or
11:35
in agony or something like that yeah
11:37
bruxism it's called knee teeth gnashing
11:40
you're nothing your teeth
11:41
and it's a dental problem for many
11:43
people so i think one in ten people
11:44
grind their teeth so it is officially is
11:47
grinding but grind their teeth and gnash
11:49
their teeth
11:49
at night but um it is bad it's
11:51
interesting so
11:52
people who are teeth people who are
11:55
sleep brooks's
11:56
as they're called will be gnashing their
11:58
teeth for up to 40 minutes per hour
12:01
and that's with a force of about 250
12:03
pounds
12:04
so that's a huge amount you know that's
12:05
two or three people and that's compared
12:07
to
12:08
sitting in your mouth just sitting in
12:10
your mouth on your jaw
12:11
gnashing your teeth together that's bad
12:13
um and that's compared to in the daytime
12:14
if you're in a wake brook sir it's just
12:16
20 minutes per day
12:18
as opposed to 40 minutes an hour and
12:19
it's only 20 pounds of force
12:21
so that's quite a lot of force you're
12:22
exerting on your little mouth in your
12:23
sleep
12:24
yeah i was reading about teeth um just
12:27
throughout
12:28
the ages and the one that i'd not heard
12:30
about before was
12:31
what the mayans used to do with their
12:32
teeth uh what did they do have we spoken
12:35
about this before i don't think we have
12:36
so they were not only very proud of
12:38
their teeth they had a lot of dentistry
12:40
uh work done to them and their dentists
12:42
have been said
12:43
uh when people have looked through the
12:45
records of the different type of things
12:46
that they've done quite advanced for
12:48
their time
12:48
and one thing they wanted to do was pimp
12:50
up their teeth just to make it really
12:52
shiny and beautiful so
12:54
there were two things that they could do
12:56
one is that they would just cut into
12:57
each tooth
12:58
and give it a little indentation so it
13:00
just looked a bit more
13:01
interesting than just your regular flat
13:03
tooth and they would leave that
13:05
as was but sometimes they would create
13:06
this indentation this little crater and
13:08
they would put little um bits of jewelry
13:11
inside that would sit kind of like how a
13:13
lot of um
13:15
rappers yeah like kanye west did that
13:16
recently no not the
13:19
heard that mick jagger got that done
13:20
with the draw but i i i don't
13:22
think he did i think that's just the
13:23
story i got told it's not a good rumor
13:25
is it
13:26
surely you could just look at his face
13:28
as i go oh no he didn't do that i think
13:29
he's had it taken out now but i think he
13:30
got a bit of an emerald put in and
13:31
someone said oh you people kept saying
13:32
to him oh you've got spinach in your
13:34
teeth
13:36
but this is a very vague memory
13:39
yeah so i don't think it's true i can't
13:40
believe that's the most exciting rumor
13:41
someone could make up about mick jagger
13:43
i mean his whole life consists of things
13:45
more exciting than that
13:46
so you know what the minds would have
13:48
been digging into they would have been
13:49
digging into the skin of the teeth
13:52
which is another phrase from the king
13:54
james bible
13:55
yeah and it is a very weird one as well
13:58
because um
13:59
job says he just escaped by the skin of
14:00
his teeth but what does it actually mean
14:02
well a lot of
14:03
job is there's a lot of gnashing in joe
14:06
because basically he's him being
14:07
tormented by
14:09
god and the devil and everyone right
14:10
yeah he's just having a pretty bad time
14:12
of it awful
14:13
um and so this in this case he says my
14:15
bone cleaveth to my skin
14:17
and to my flesh and i am escaped with
14:19
the skin of my teeth
14:20
wow but it is it's so unclear what it
14:22
means and everyone says oh i suppose
14:23
that means you escape with as
14:25
narrower margin as the skin on your
14:27
teeth is narrow but when you read that
14:28
sentence it's not really what that would
14:30
mean in english
14:31
maybe maybe teeth used to have skin i
14:33
think that's
14:34
that's the obvious conclusion we're
14:35
talking a long time ago and people
14:37
always left it
14:39
um so it loads i mean do you know bite
14:42
the dust is the thing that's from the
14:43
bible but i look for the well
14:45
supposedly it is but the phrase uh is
14:48
they that dwell in the wilderness shall
14:49
bow before him and his enemies shall
14:50
lick the dust
14:51
which is slightly different to bite the
14:53
dust it is yeah it's another one licks
14:55
the dust
14:58
i've got a quiz question for you guys
14:59
okay okay um in
15:01
which religious book does satan appear
15:03
to tempt adam and eve to eat
15:06
forbidden fruit yep the bible james
15:07
harkin um
15:09
it is not the bible i'm
15:17
the book of mormon it's the quran
15:21
so in genesis in the bible there is no
15:24
mention of the fact that it's satan
15:25
it's just a snake and this was an
15:27
interpretation that was put on it many
15:28
centuries later so it was in the
15:30
inter-testamental period
15:32
uh between old and new testaments they
15:33
thought i bet that was satan
15:35
but actually it's just a snake in
15:37
genesis but in the quran when it
15:39
describes the story
15:40
it says that adam was adam and eve were
15:41
tempted by satan wow
15:43
i've got a fact about bibles um do you
15:46
know
15:47
about the space bibles space
15:50
bible no so are they bibles that have
15:52
been sent into space exactly
15:54
apollo 13. so they're exactly literally
15:57
what they do
15:58
you're good at this apollo 13 had 300
16:01
bibles
16:05
wrong there were 300. they needed so
16:08
much rocket fuel for that
16:09
charlie i know but you need to be able
16:11
to convert the aliens when you meet them
16:14
so what it was they were uh you remember
16:17
microfilm
16:18
you know way of making these incredibly
16:19
small so they were all one inch by one
16:21
inch and each of them was printed with
16:23
all the holy scriptures and um obviously
16:26
apollo 13 went pretty badly wrong but
16:28
they the
16:28
bible survived and they went up again
16:30
with apollo 14
16:32
and a hundred of them went to the moon
16:34
and the other 200 just went
16:36
up into space don't you think that that
16:37
seems like a bad omen i wouldn't want to
16:39
be on apollo 14 with the same bibles
16:41
that were on apollo 13.
16:43
i'd assume that god was angry for some
16:45
reason um do you know that you're
16:47
as of last year you're no longer allowed
16:49
to sell biblical teeth
16:51
um or any relic-y teeth and
16:54
these days they now have started um
16:57
giving a certificate of authenticity to
17:00
relics
17:00
they've always had that though haven't
17:01
they well i think they're now saying
17:03
officially that these are the only ones
17:04
recognized by the church so if
17:06
there's a museum that has for example i
17:09
read one has
17:10
um jesus christ's bread cutting knife
17:12
from the last supper who claims to have
17:14
it
17:14
unless that now has a certificate it
17:15
cannot be considered who
17:17
does the pope just wander around going
17:19
yeah that one looks real no that was not
17:21
i mean who's deciding what gets the
17:22
certificate obviously none of them are
17:24
real
17:24
well sorry they would disagree with that
17:26
i imagine yeah because they were saying
17:28
none of them is real
17:30
israel
17:34
[Laughter]
17:42
[Music]
17:44
okay it is time to move on to fact
17:46
number three
17:47
and that is andy my fact is that if you
17:51
bought land in australia before
17:53
1891 you had the legal right to the land
17:56
stretching
17:56
all the way to the center of the earth
17:59
pretty cool
18:00
so amazing yeah and that's why they
18:02
always get so hot in australia they're
18:04
all living aren't they right in the core
18:06
and so this was an old law and there's a
18:08
sort of historical
18:10
um latin phrase cuisine
18:14
which means whoever owns the soil holds
18:17
title up to the heavens and down to the
18:19
depths of hell
18:20
so that was a legal principle that you
18:22
just owned all the land
18:24
uh so does the heavens extend as far as
18:26
the infinite universe like where does
18:28
that end well that's the thing i think
18:29
it was before people really knew about
18:31
the infinite universe
18:32
so they really undersold it when they
18:33
yeah when they yeah they should have
18:35
tried they might have thought that
18:36
heaven was up there
18:37
that's true which feels blasphemous to
18:39
selling a slice of heaven yeah
18:41
to the heavens they didn't say penetrate
18:44
up to the heavens yeah
18:45
up to the heavens but this it was
18:46
problematic wasn't it because this was
18:47
before airplanes were invented and
18:49
before spades were invented
18:51
you couldn't go very far up or down in
18:53
those days exactly yeah and then hot air
18:55
ballooning was the thing which changed
18:56
it
18:57
because people kept being worried about
18:58
hot air balloons and saying oh you've
18:59
trespassed over my house and you're
19:00
hot evelyn way up there yeah there was
19:02
one um court case wasn't there with the
19:04
guy who invented granada
19:06
okay um he owned a house he's called the
19:09
baron of lee
19:10
or something like that is this the is
19:11
that the chicken guy
19:13
um because there was a farmer called
19:15
thomas lee cosby
19:16
who in 1945 um and he sued the us
19:19
government because they'd been flying
19:21
their airplanes above his property so
19:23
about 83 feet above his property
19:24
and it was causing his chickens to fly
19:27
into the walls and kill themselves
19:28
apparently
19:29
he argued and he said he'd have to give
19:30
up farming because so many of his
19:31
chickens have died
19:32
and that's when it was kind of enshrined
19:34
in law how much land you were entitled
19:36
to
19:36
above you and it was established that
19:38
you're not entitled to all of it but
19:39
you're entitled to enough land above
19:40
your house that all your chickens don't
19:42
die
19:42
yeah actually my one was the the british
19:45
law so
19:46
um yeah so that was the american one got
19:48
it australia changed it too i'm very sad
19:50
to say did they yeah 1891
19:52
they changed it um um you know only get
19:54
15 meters down
19:56
yeah there's not very much at all well
19:58
when you think it used to be six
19:59
thousand three hundred and seventy one
20:00
kilometers yeah that's exactly
20:01
yeah denton half the other is that the
20:04
whole thing that's to the core
20:06
surface yeah um i i looked into actually
20:09
what was going on in australia in 1891
20:11
uh as a partial aussie i was
20:14
sort of thinking i have no idea what
20:15
life was like back then so population
20:17
of australia back in 1891 was just over
20:21
three million
20:21
wow um yeah so the population of london
20:24
at the exact same time was five million
20:26
something so
20:27
the whole population of australia yes
20:29
still underneath the city of london
20:31
um they had really cool names for all of
20:34
their leaders at the time the premier of
20:35
new south wales was called henry parks
20:37
then you had the premiere of western
20:39
australia who's called john forrest
20:41
so it's all sort of you know greenery
20:43
based and then there's philip fish
20:45
uh premiere of tasmania he was very cool
20:47
but the most exciting thing was uh
20:48
banjo patterson who was our sort of
20:50
greatest poet really songwriter banjo
20:53
patterson
20:53
so he wrote waltzing matilda and he
20:55
wrote man from snowy river
20:57
he wrote in 1891 his masterpiece
21:00
which was no it's called his masterpiece
21:03
it was a poem it's very obscure no one's
21:04
really heard it
21:05
very good yeah thank you
21:09
do you know what the deepest building in
21:11
the world is no
21:13
well according to my research which wait
21:16
is this a quiz question oh yeah why not
21:17
do that
21:18
um you could get it actually think of a
21:20
country
21:21
where the rules at one stage were that
21:24
you could go really really deep
21:25
australia australia so it's the deepest
21:26
building so the sydney opera house is
21:28
correct yes
21:30
well this is according to
21:32
constructionweekonline.com
21:33
and i couldn't really find much evidence
21:34
apart from that but um apparently the
21:36
car park
21:37
extends 12 stories into the earth and
21:40
that's the deepest basement in the world
21:41
wow
21:42
it's also the fifth deepest that we've
21:45
ever
21:46
dug as a sort of operating building
21:48
really in the world so
21:49
that's 120 feet deep uh the the second
21:54
deepest we've ever gone is the large
21:55
hadron collider which is 575 feet deep
21:59
but the deepest of all do you guys know
22:01
there's like bar holes that they have
22:03
so this this is where people work so
22:05
this is
22:06
like a building effectively no okay have
22:08
you heard of this building no it's a
22:10
laboratory in china
22:11
how are we supposed to get that well no
22:13
i was gonna ask you more
22:14
so if the second deepest is 575 feet got
22:17
it what do you think the deepest
22:19
is 575.5 wow
22:22
no no very far away 12 kilometers it's
22:26
7900 feet deep whoa and that is a
22:29
yeah it's the deepest building in the
22:30
world um or laboratory it's inside
22:33
a mountain but i thought that's a cheap
22:34
because the mountain is above ground but
22:36
actually it starts
22:37
uh they start counting it i believe from
22:38
the bottom of the mountain going down
22:40
into the super villain lives there yes
22:43
exactly that's in china
22:44
yeah it's in china uh what is it the
22:46
idea is that so it's a laboratory and i
22:48
think
22:49
they want to study um the background uh
22:51
radiation
22:52
and dark matter and so on and the lower
22:54
you go radiation becomes less so
22:56
they do it from there but i don't know
22:57
how they can see but yeah
22:59
how they can see there'll be electric
23:00
lights there we go they're probably
23:02
going to happen
23:03
that technology yeah since we you know
23:05
we're investigating dark matter and
23:12
[Applause]
23:16
[Music]
23:17
okay it is time for our final fact of
23:19
the show and that
23:20
is chozinski my fact this week is that
23:23
jumping spiders that wear eyeliner are
23:25
more likely to be eastern by their mate
23:28
so yeah the way this works is uh and
23:30
this is being this is some experiments
23:32
that are being done in a lab in florida
23:33
it's a lab of a behavioral ecologist
23:35
called lisa taylor
23:36
and she was looking at how jumping
23:38
spiders kind of flirt with each other
23:40
and so if you're jumping spider mail one
23:42
of the problems is
23:43
as a lot of spiders is that if you're
23:45
trying to flirt with a female there's
23:46
sort of an equal chance that she'll eat
23:48
you instead
23:49
so i think about one in five jumping
23:52
spiders who tried to flirt with females
23:53
then get attacked and they tried to eat
23:55
them i like those arts
23:59
and she noticed that some of them have
24:00
these really bright red and white
24:01
stripes on their faces
24:02
to make himself look a bit toxic so that
24:04
doesn't get eaten by the mate
24:06
and so she was like if i put some black
24:08
eyeliner on their eyes to cover up these
24:10
red stripes
24:11
they now won't look toxic and they'll
24:12
get eaten and she said she did find
24:14
that suddenly um they stopped eating
24:17
eating
24:18
them wow once the stripes were taken i
24:20
thought it was that the red complexion
24:21
signifies health
24:23
females were noticing the color it is
24:25
saying oh good nice and healthy
24:26
well it's both it's a combination so red
24:28
signifies health so they think oh good i
24:30
want to shag that but it also
24:32
signifies toxicity so they think i don't
24:34
want to eat it so that's exactly what
24:35
you want as a male because you want sex
24:37
but you don't want to be eaten
24:38
why are they not all red all the time
24:41
evolution doesn't start at the end point
24:42
james does it
24:43
you're quite right it just takes time
24:45
and they're doing more experiments on
24:47
them now where they're putting false
24:48
eyelashes on the top of their heads
24:50
oh yeah so they have some of them have
24:52
these tufts which may indicate genetic
24:54
fitness and so they're gluing little
24:55
bits of false eyelash onto the top of
24:56
the heads to give them extra tufts
24:58
and seeing if that indicates uh anything
25:00
to the females so they're basically
25:01
making themselves very very slightly
25:03
taller to improve their
25:05
amazing amazing yeah but it's
25:08
interesting it sounds like the tests are
25:10
aimed at helping
25:11
a helpless male as in it's it's trying
25:13
to well because the
25:14
the jumping spider basically doesn't
25:17
even know
25:18
which is his own species when he who's
25:20
oh yeah he just
25:21
whatever he walks up to whichever spider
25:24
he starts dancing
25:25
and trying to woo even if they can't
25:27
breed and it leads to nothing so he
25:29
exerts all this energy for
25:30
nothing so he just has no idea it
25:32
doesn't just lead to nothing they
25:33
frequently get eaten because they
25:34
approach the spider of the wrong species
25:36
yeah and start flirting yeah that's like
25:38
flirting with a
25:39
lion yeah isn't it you couldn't tell a
25:42
woman from a life
25:43
just every now and then you think i'm in
25:45
here and then you get eaten yeah
25:47
i'm just going to pop down into that
25:48
lovely lady's enclosure
25:50
[Laughter]
25:52
and they dance for about 20 minutes
25:55
which is a long time if you're a spider
25:57
because they only live for two years
25:59
so that's equivalent if every time we
26:01
had sex we had to do an 11 hour
26:03
courtship dance as the equivalent of
26:05
that wow
26:06
oh my god that's amazing which is worth
26:08
a try i think
26:09
it is you'd be too tired by the end
26:10
though you would be you don't have to
26:12
involve
26:12
11 hours and then it's a lion
26:17
i was reading about how jumping spiders
26:19
jump how they get the
26:20
why they're given that name because they
26:21
can leap huge heights i think one was
26:23
found
26:24
in the uk recently that could leap six
26:25
foot um which i think is a record
26:28
what i thought was it must be their
26:29
muscular legs uh that allows a jumping
26:31
spider to leave and that's not the case
26:33
what they do is they segment their
26:35
muscles into different so basically
26:36
their leg is broken up
26:38
into two different bits and the leap
26:40
comes from them
26:41
slamming blood into the bottom of their
26:43
legs
26:44
and that just lobs them off gives their
26:46
legs a reaction
26:47
to jump it's not actual muscle wow so
26:50
they must feel really light-headed when
26:52
they do it right because all the blood's
26:53
gone to their legs yeah
26:54
that's true they always faint do you
26:56
think every time they jump they pass out
26:58
in the air
26:59
must be right yeah but the other thing
27:00
is that they can stop halfway through a
27:02
jump
27:03
pretty cool what do you mean by that so
27:05
they can spin a really quick line of
27:07
silk and then use that as a drag line
27:09
to create air resistance yeah like
27:13
basically i yeah just like spider-man so
27:15
they can just stop halfway through
27:16
jumping if they decide it's a bad idea
27:18
yeah or slow down dramatically can't
27:20
they and they always a lot of them often
27:21
do it to make sure they don't massively
27:23
crash land
27:24
so if you just jump with no drag line
27:26
then you face first
27:27
teeth out but with the drag line they
27:29
can sort of reorient themselves in the
27:31
air
27:31
yeah it's very clever i read about the
27:34
dancing and how it evolved because like
27:35
anna says you don't start at the end
27:37
with evolution
27:38
um and in this article they said that
27:40
basically
27:41
you do your dance as a spider and the
27:44
female is generally not interested
27:46
and so you have to do a slightly better
27:47
dance and then she is interested
27:49
and then the next generation does that
27:51
slightly better dance but then
27:53
their generation isn't that interested
27:54
so that's why the dances are so long and
27:56
complicated
27:57
because basically over the millions and
27:59
millions of years they've been improving
28:00
their dance moves but do they get
28:02
better and better do they do the history
28:04
of all the dance moves until they get to
28:05
the end
28:06
new move that's why it's 20 minutes yeah
28:09
no they so basically you're doing if you
28:11
try to do the dance moves that your
28:12
great great great
28:13
great great great grandfather did yeah
28:15
it wouldn't work on the current
28:16
crop i can't confirm that if you do the
28:18
charleston
28:20
it excites very little interest
28:24
that certainly means that we're much
28:25
less involved than spiders because
28:26
they're doing that and we've got
28:27
flossing after millions of years of
28:29
evolution
28:30
humans have managed to do a flossing
28:31
dance or is it true that the flossing is
28:33
the absolute epitome
28:35
of the possibility of dancing this
28:36
millions of years no i don't think it is
28:38
true
28:38
[Music]
28:39
[Laughter]
28:41
um so after female jumping spiders mate
28:43
for the first time
28:44
many of them will never have any
28:46
interest in sex ever again
28:48
oh i know this sounds like my marriage
28:51
cut that out i don't even know why
28:53
that's just just completely
28:55
north and you're a comedian it's the law
28:58
[Laughter]
29:03
i wasn't saying my wife but she got into
29:06
every chinese theme park for free
29:12
oh my goodness okay um so there's a
29:14
species called sevaya in canada and it
29:16
was called and tested and they they have
29:18
sex only once
29:19
and then the females they just have all
29:20
the sperm they need for the rest of
29:21
their life
29:22
so they can produce lots of generations
29:25
yeah
29:26
so yeah so they keep the sperm ready
29:29
don't they just
29:30
keep it yeah yeah yeah so that's all
29:31
they need sometimes two
29:33
sometimes they go back for one more wow
29:36
that's a lucky guy so every poor husband
29:39
is desperately hoping for that second
29:40
shag
29:43
his whole life wow so there's a really
29:45
cool thing about some jumping spiders
29:47
actually at least 30 different species
29:49
which practice bondage with females and
29:52
this
29:53
is actually quite a good way of not
29:54
letting them attack and eat you and so
29:56
they sort of tie them up in silk before
29:58
sex so you the woman by tying
30:00
her to your web or tying her legs
30:01
together
30:02
um and then you can you're giving me a
30:04
look like that's unfair but she is going
30:05
to eat you
30:05
no no don't do it that's true it's just
30:07
the typical
30:08
feminism rearing its head again
30:13
that you should definitely tie down
30:14
women
30:16
um they're known quite sweetly as bridal
30:18
veils these things and
30:20
quite euphemistically you might say yeah
30:22
well yes indeed
30:23
um because the bridal veil isn't massive
30:25
and doesn't have weights all around it
30:26
to secure the woman to the floor
30:28
how do you think i got married again
30:32
i can't help it
30:36
wow that is yeah that's quite something
30:38
yeah yeah yeah it's handy
30:40
um and they actually tested this because
30:42
um a
30:43
scientist wanted to work out if the ones
30:46
who were unable to spin these things got
30:48
eaten more regularly
30:49
and so again they did this very cool
30:50
experiment where they put dental silicon
30:53
into their web spinning apparatus which
30:55
means that they can't use it anymore and
30:57
the way they immobilize spiders so that
30:58
they're able to do this is they put them
30:59
in the freezer
31:00
and apparently that temporarily
31:01
immobilizes a spider so this is
31:04
just scientists always do this okay so
31:06
there's the jumping spiders sometimes
31:07
spiders they uh
31:08
they call it singing basically they rub
31:10
the body segments together and it makes
31:12
vibrations
31:12
which get communicated to the female and
31:15
the females hear it through a slit in
31:16
their legs which is quite cool
31:18
um and every spider has his own special
31:20
embellishments that
31:21
he adds so seven percent of court ships
31:25
where that happens end in the mail being
31:27
eaten which is not great odds but not
31:28
terrible
31:29
but researchers then incapacitated the
31:32
males
31:33
and stopped them from singing i don't
31:34
know how whether they just you know
31:36
in but that made their bodies stiffer so
31:38
they couldn't rub the sections together
31:40
you shame them if you just say that was
31:42
really out of tune or something yeah
31:43
they shamed them but
31:44
they did something to stop them singing
31:46
uh and if
31:48
the males aren't allowed to sing by
31:49
researchers thirty percent get eaten
31:51
so that's at least three separate
31:52
experiments where researchers have
31:54
stopped male spiders
31:55
from not being eaten in their court
31:57
ships it's a bit of a theme
31:58
yeah these researchers are starting to
32:00
look like the bad guys aren't they
32:02
thinking about it so there are there are
32:04
actually animals in the wild that sort
32:06
of wear makeup
32:07
themselves without scientists supplying
32:09
it to them um i think we've spoken
32:10
before about
32:11
there was that um vulture uh the bearded
32:14
vulture
32:15
rubs its head in its bottom in in soil
32:18
and it sort of
32:18
gets its face or scruffy it gives it a
32:20
reddish brown hue that it
32:22
then uses to attract uh and probably
32:25
intimidate possibly
32:26
but relevant to the jumping spider of
32:28
the fact um there are
32:29
assassin bugs uh that go around wearing
32:32
the dead carcasses of the ants that
32:34
they've killed
32:35
as a what the article said is a sort of
32:37
backpack so they just
32:39
wear a bunch of them and it's to trick
32:41
jumping spiders into not eating them so
32:42
it's
32:43
effectively a backpack of camouflage and
32:45
this is makeup we're saying right
32:47
this is um it's more uh sort of you've
32:50
done your makeup you now need your bag
32:52
you're going out yeah imagine if you had
32:55
your makeup artist as a celebrity you're
32:56
ready to go on telly and what would you
32:58
like some blusher
32:59
can i have a few corpses piled under my
33:01
back please and it's all around my body
33:05
flamingos wear makeup do they yeah but
33:08
they sort of generate their own makeup
33:09
so it's like having a mascara gland
33:12
really yeah so they have this oil which
33:14
the uh they secrete from a gland near
33:16
their tails
33:17
and uh it has various health effects so
33:18
it's not just used for cosmetic reasons
33:20
but they dorb the oil onto their
33:22
feathers
33:23
from the gland and one of the effects it
33:24
has is to make them a deeper pink
33:27
and scientists have observed that during
33:28
the mating season
33:30
they do it much more often so that seems
33:33
to be an indication that they are
33:35
because because being deep pink is quite
33:36
sexy two of flamingos it's like well
33:38
it's like a fake tan
33:39
yeah fake tone it's sort of real tan
33:41
actually isn't it it's like having a sun
33:42

00:15

00:18
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting

00:27
from the last seven days
00:29
and in no particular order here we go
00:32
starting with you
00:33
james okay my fact this week is that on
00:36
their birthday
00:37
every beefeater at the tower of london
00:39
gets a gift of a free
00:41
bottle of beefeater gin
00:47
[Music]
00:49
racehorses they all get their new age on
00:51
the 1st of january no um it's every
00:53
beefeater on that particular person's
00:55
birthday
00:56
they get one bottle of gin and the beef
00:58
eater gym brand is nothing to do with
01:00
the beefeaters
01:01
um but i went to the tower of london
01:03
this week and i spoke to my friend andy
01:05
the beefeater
01:06
and he said that basically the beefeater
01:08
gym brand have got so much out of the
01:10
beefeaters over the years is the least
01:11
they can do to give them a bottle of
01:13
chin every year
01:14
it's very sweet so did you go to the
01:16
beefeater pub i went to
01:18
the it's called the keys and it's the
01:20
pub inside the tower of london yes i did
01:22
go there that's very cool that's cool
01:24
yeah i was reading about it so there
01:25
used to be a lot of pubs
01:26
in the tower of london this is the last
01:28
remaining there's just one left which
01:30
means if you fall out with any other
01:31
beefeaters
01:32
if you have beef with them you have to
01:34
go to the same pub all the time
01:36
that's terrible there's a sitcom sure i
01:38
would watch in fact this is a soap opera
01:40
set in the tower of london pub you're
01:41
really really good you're right because
01:43
they get up to quite
01:44
bad behavior sometimes and they have
01:45
done traditionally so i always thought
01:47
of beefeaters as these sort of like
01:49
eminent bastions of british stateliness
01:53
in other words like
01:54
that but um actually uh they were
01:55
historically used to kind of be
01:57
drunkards i think in the 18th century
02:00
they were known for creating havoc and
02:02
for
02:03
illegally subletting their rooms out to
02:05
other people they would just randomly
02:07
sell on the post of beefeater to make a
02:08
bit of extra cash whenever they wanted
02:10
uh yeah they were known as scoundrels
02:12
you could only do that once
02:13
like once you sold it it belonged to the
02:16
other person and then they might sell it
02:17
on afterwards
02:18
yeah unless you stole it back from them
02:19
in the night yeah i'm not sure exactly
02:22
how it worked i think you basically got
02:24
money off them and then they had the
02:25
ceremony
02:26
and the ceremony to become a beefeater
02:28
you get a little kind of cup
02:29
a little pewter cup and you drink some
02:31
pork and you do
02:32
a toast and then you're a beef eater
02:34
basically yeah imagine
02:36
if we could just sell our jobs to other
02:37
people you can if you want
02:39
i mean well i'm in talks with a few guys
02:43
alex bell is pretty interested
02:46
in the toast it's a reference to that
02:48
isn't it because they do the toast with
02:49
a port and then
02:50
i think the thing they say when they're
02:51
toasting a new beef eater is
02:53
is it may you never die a yeoman water
02:55
so they're officially called yeoman
02:56
waters
02:57
and that's because the idea was if you
02:59
made the mistake of dying in office
03:01
then you've been an idiot because you
03:02
hadn't sold it on in time and made that
03:04
extra cash
03:04
yes exactly it's like dying after or not
03:07
selling a house
03:08
in the years before you die to go just
03:10
on a rampage with the money
03:12
is that what you're gonna do considering
03:13
you do have a son yeah
03:16
good point and they were really
03:19
unpopular in loads of ways so as well as
03:21
selling their jobs
03:22
a writer historically said they have
03:24
gradually assumed themselves the more
03:26
lucrative
03:27
occupation of stopping everybody who
03:29
wishes to visit these objects of our
03:30
national pride and glory
03:32
and forcing themselves upon them as
03:33
their guides so the guards would just
03:35
say hey do you want to guide a tour and
03:36
pester you until
03:38
you gave in and gave him some money yeah
03:40
so andy the beefeater gave us a guided
03:42
tour
03:43
this week and i gotta say if you do go
03:45
to the tower of london
03:46
do get a tour from their beefeaters
03:48
because they are amazing and they know
03:49
all sorts of stuff
03:50
but you were duped into paying for it
03:53
he's robbed you um i read this thing
03:57
about the bee feeders that so
03:59
i think london uh anyone coming here
04:01
there's a famous fact about the
04:03
cabbies the black cab drivers having the
04:05
knowledge it's one of those things they
04:06
have to memorize every single
04:08
road in london and that's a test they
04:10
take there's a similar thing that
04:11
happens with the beefeaters
04:13
they have to memorize what's known as
04:14
the story and it's 900 years of the
04:17
tower of london's history
04:19
they need to know it word by word within
04:21
six months of passing their probation
04:23
after being sworn in
04:24
yeah but you now get these uber beef
04:25
eaters who come
04:31
i don't think we know why they're called
04:32
beef eaters do we there are lots of
04:34
theories
04:34
yeah the story we were told on the tour
04:37
was that um
04:38
it was because they were paid in beef
04:39
which they know definitely is true or
04:41
paid in meat
04:42
which they know definitely was true and
04:44
that the people outside kind of thought
04:46
oh look at these guys eating all that
04:47
meat
04:48
and so it was like an insult kind of
04:50
thing it makes sense
04:51
i mean and they're part of the queen the
04:53
royal household they eat lots of meat
04:55
they lots of beef
04:56
people see i've seen other people poo
04:58
pooing like crazy that stuff
05:00
oh right but it just makes so much sense
05:03
it seems to me like one of those things
05:04
that you can't really poop it's like
05:05
yeah they ate loads of beef and they're
05:07
called beef eaters do you have a better
05:08
theory you've read there are i've read
05:10
two or three there's one which is sort
05:11
of it's from the french buffet
05:13
which is a different word meaning
05:14
something else yeah that's clearly a
05:16
nonsense isn't it
05:17
what why because that is such a
05:19
convoluted way to get to the word
05:20
beefeater rather than just they ate
05:22
loads of beef
05:23
i think they're eating and we're paid
05:25
enough there's probably something
05:26
who gets paid but we know they were paid
05:28
they know that they were yeah we know
05:30
they were given
05:30
a stipend of beef which most people
05:32
weren't able to eat at the time
05:34
and we know that people took the piss
05:35
out of the royal household for uh having
05:37
because they ate so much beef around
05:38
that time i think andy's right there's
05:40
so many holes in this
05:42
just i just don't believe it but it
05:43
could believe it you know it could be
05:45
that
05:45
it's it came from something else and
05:47
then it was um helped by the fact they
05:49
had lot
05:50
lots of beef yeah exactly it could have
05:52
come from buffer day and then
05:53
i'm not buying it so there are there are
05:56
beef eaters today
05:57
the ravens eat raw beef they get fed raw
06:00
beef
06:00
from smithfield probably eat beef
06:05
wait are you going to explain your
06:06
definitely more plausible weird french
06:08
origin completed one
06:10
i did i did read this and i thought yeah
06:12
that's clearly bollocks
06:14
so the thing is that the beefeaters
06:15
began um they're called the
06:18
yeoman guard of the king or queen right
06:20
well they're called the yeoman warders
06:22
which is part of a larger group called
06:23
the yeoman guard
06:24
and they're kind of the bodyguard of the
06:26
king or queen but it started
06:28
in at the battle of bosworth in 1485
06:32
uh when henry vii um won the crown
06:35
and all these guys who'd helped him who
06:37
were from this northern regiment he
06:38
brought them in
06:39
and they became his bodyguard but henry
06:42
vii
06:42
will have been an english-speaking king
06:45
so if it was
06:46
further back in norman times you can
06:48
kind of see where the french thing might
06:49
have come from
06:50
yeah good point whereas henry vii
06:52
actually hailed from wales
06:54
did he yeah the tudors were all a welsh
06:56
family is there any welsh word that
06:58
sounds a bit like beefeater
07:00
taffeta it could have come from
07:04
b fetus like b
07:07
yeah like a b like you know a feat like
07:09
you accomplish a feat
07:11
with a b yeah with a b b racing yeah
07:13
exactly so maybe they were famous for
07:14
their b
07:15
racing back in the day and they got
07:17
known as the bee feeders
07:18
that's good maybe the b the bees were
07:20
the original ravens you think
07:21
that they trained well maybe there was
07:23
originally another
07:24
group called the a fetus who did lots of
07:27
things exactly
07:28
yeah and then they kind of died out and
07:29
then the bee feeders came in
07:31
bingo the less good features who could
07:33
never gotten to the a-team maybe
07:34
i'm just saying there's a lot of
07:35
explanations you're right um
07:37
did you see in when you're in the pub
07:39
james i wonder there's apparently a
07:41
framed
07:42
photo of rudolph hess i took a photo of
07:44
it did you yeah
07:45
of his signature as well he sort of
07:48
signed
07:48
they asked him for a pin-up photo
07:50
basically because he he was a senior
07:51
nazi who was imprisoned there briefly in
07:53
1941
07:54
i think he defected everyone else was
07:56
taking photos of all the pictures of bee
07:57
pizzas and stuff but i clocked the um
07:59
signature of rudolph so
08:01
i got to get a photo of that well you've
08:02
got a large collection of nazis
08:05
instantly you recognized that covenant
08:08
behind the
08:09
fake bookshelf in your house right
08:13
over that okay that makes sense did he
08:14
defect because it sounds like
08:16
when he was there a lot of people
08:18
collected his signature and that feels
08:19
odd i think he flew over
08:21
with his family um
08:24
to scotland viola yeah i think he came
08:26
out i think
08:27
typically there weren't many nazis
08:29
arrested during the war yeah the german
08:31
side yeah but he was
08:32
prison i was in prison
08:35
he wasn't just drinking at the pub if
08:37
you defect they don't just say oh great
08:39
well welcome to britain here's your
08:40
here's your home
08:41
yeah no he was in jail yeah they
08:42
arrested you and then they sort of ask
08:43
you a few questions
08:45
yeah yeah are you sure you're rude of
08:46
hess that kind of thing yeah yeah
08:48
but then he did um get tried after the
08:50
war didn't even committed suicide in
08:51
prison house i'm not saying it's a happy
08:53
ending to the story right
08:55
but also let's not waste too much
08:57
sympathy on the guy
09:01
so uh if you got the rudolph hess uh
09:04
everyone else is doing bee
09:05
feeders did you see the framed photo of
09:07
bruce willis
09:09
i didn't see that did you not ah there's
09:12
i saw a framed picture of
09:13
um the duke of edinburgh okay i didn't
09:17
see bruce willis well it says amongst
09:19
the things that you'll find there
09:20
there's a ceremonial axe which is in the
09:22
corner so that photos of guests like
09:24
bruce willis and tom clancy
09:26
i don't know what tom clancy looks like
09:28
no one does so that's going to be
09:29
youtube
09:32
that's true and you've got face
09:33
blindness so actually i would recognize
09:35
bruce willis perhaps
09:36
right if i was stood next to someone who
09:38
said that was bruce willis
09:40
yeah no i didn't see that but i wouldn't
09:43
do you know there's lots of pictures
09:44
there yeah do they have pictures
09:46
of their final prisoners because they
09:49
should do and actually i didn't read
09:50
that they did
09:51
but their last prisoners were the cray
09:52
brothers weren't they were they the very
09:54
last prisoners
09:55
yeah wow so odd it's such a weird
09:58
coincidence well it's
09:59
it's because of their national service
10:00
right yes no i know but it's odd that
10:02
it's them yeah
10:03
someone famous yeah exactly so this was
10:05
in 1952 before they were famous
10:07
um and they had just where are they now
10:14
and they'd failed to report for national
10:15
service and they'd been on the run for
10:16
ages and then they'd been
10:18
caught by a policeman who was like you
10:19
didn't report for national service and i
10:20
think they punched him
10:21
yeah and i think their regiment was
10:23
based at the tower
10:25
of london yeah which is bizarre and cray
10:26
brothers for any overseas listeners
10:28
they're
10:28
the very famous mob london gangsters
10:32
uh they they there are godfathers
10:35
basically played by tom hardy and tom
10:37
hardy in that movie that's right
10:38
yes yeah here's a ten years you
10:41
mentioned the duke of edinburgh just
10:42
there i did
10:42
so the duke of wellington okay
10:47
so the famous duke of wellington the one
10:48
who won the battle of waterloo he was
10:50
the constable of the tower
10:51
for 26 years yeah after the battle of
10:54
waterloo wow and he completely changed
10:56
it so he
10:57
did this huge reform program he stopped
10:59
people selling their jobs as beef eaters
11:01
and he drained the moat because lots of
11:03
people were getting cholera basically
11:05
because it was so
11:06
you know sort of stagnant and he also
11:08
closed the royal menagerie
11:10
which used to be based at the tower of
11:11
london yeah and it was he closed it
11:13
because people
11:14
kept being killed by the animals oh
11:16
really um you used to just be allowed
11:18
into the monkey room there were no
11:19
barriers
11:20
just but the monkeys wouldn't eat you
11:21
would they well they might nibble on you
11:24
that's kind of it an account the account
11:26
was that a monkey tore a boy's leg
11:28
quotes in a dangerous manner wow
11:31
yeah um an assistant keeper accidentally
11:34
left a line and two tigers into the same
11:35
room and they started killing each other
11:37
and wolves escaped and ate a terrier
11:40
there's just
11:40
constant accidents happening because
11:42
there were these wild animals there wow
11:43
and so when that guy came in
11:45
that's basically when they count the
11:46
beefeaters from really beefy to number
11:48
one was that guy and then beefy's number
11:50
two was
11:50
his mate and then so on so on um they
11:53
don't really have records for the
11:54
previous ones because they were
11:56
so often sold between people but from
11:58
that guy
11:59
to the present day there have been about
12:01
400 beef eaters and that is
12:03
fewer than people who have been in space
12:06
wow
12:06
wow have any beef eaters been into space
12:10
not to my knowledge so the guy who is
12:13
the constable um
12:14
he historically um was allowed to keep
12:17
all livestock that fell from tower
12:19
bridge into the river
12:21
so anything that fell from the bridge
12:22
into the river he was allowed to keep it
12:24
again that sitcom is going to be a
12:25
there's going to be a great episode
12:27
where the constable's trying to push
12:28
livestock off into the river and that
12:32
every foot of livestock that stumbled
12:34
into the tower moat he received one
12:36
penny
12:37
quite hard to retrieve a cow from a moat
12:39
i would have thought
12:40
i think you've earned it if you do that
12:42
wait so if a donkey puts one foot into
12:43
the moat
12:44
you get one penny one foot in the moat
12:46
it could be the neighbor
12:47
[Laughter]
12:49
i believe that's right yeah you
12:51
mentioned ravens before
12:52
um the idea that they would be fed beef
12:55
from and what was it an easter
12:56
egg smithfield market smithfield market
12:58
so the tower of london one of the
12:59
employees there
13:00
and i'm not sure if he counts
13:01
technically as a yeoman warder but he's
13:03
the raven master
13:05
yes he is he is a bee feeder so yeah so
13:08
they hired this guy
13:09
who his whole family lives there they
13:11
have a house and he just has to look
13:12
after these ravens
13:14
because of an enduring myth that if the
13:16
ravens left the tower of london
13:18
england would fall that's basically a
13:20
ceremonial role
13:21
just to fulfill this little event and
13:24
i've met him he's he's a really cool guy
13:26
i've done a stand-up with him we did a
13:27
stand-up game
13:28
yeah chris he was really must have a lot
13:30
of very relatable stories
13:35
um did he bring his ravens because
13:37
ravens are very good at talking
13:39
are they yeah corvids are famously the
13:41
best birds at kind of
13:43
being able to form almost human sounding
13:44
like words and they're extremely clever
13:47
and so he's trained him up to do some
13:48
quite cool stuff i thought he was
13:49
getting bigger laughs than i uh
13:52
random table four bring us more babe
13:58
that was that was a genuine problem
13:59
wasn't it when there was the um
14:02
the royal astronomer was stationed at
14:04
the tower of london while they were
14:05
waiting for the greenwich observatory to
14:07
be built
14:07
um and this was john flamsty the first
14:10
royal astronomer and while the
14:11
observatory was being built he was
14:13
trying to do his astronomy at the tower
14:14
of london
14:15
and the ravens kept pooing on the
14:16
telescope and so he said could you
14:19
please remove all the ravens
14:20
and king charles was going to i think it
14:22
was charles ii was going to and then
14:23
said oh no i've heard that the crown
14:25
will fall
14:26
but for him it will have been quite
14:27
close to the last time the crown fell
14:29
right charles a second
14:30
uh that yeah i suppose it was so he's
14:32
just come back
14:33
he's just restored the crown i can
14:36
understand why he's worried
14:37
that's what i'm saying you're right it's
14:39
totally understandable like these days i
14:40
think no one
14:41
seriously expects if the ravens go then
14:44
no and he's looking to be like he does
14:45
well this guy would be out of a
14:47
house and a job chris if they go well
14:49
they do disagree
14:50
he's got a stand-up career to fall back
14:52
i should add
14:53
uh it was a night of historical talks he
14:56
happened to be very funny and it was
14:57
mainly stand-ups doing it
14:58
his talk was on jack the ripper so it
15:00
was a bit dark actually
15:02
more like he's an expert in crows
15:12
[Music]
15:13
okay it's time for fact number two and
15:15
that is
15:16
andy my fact is that the economic
15:18
activity of the roman empire can be
15:20
measured
15:21
by studying thousand-year-old ice in
15:23
greenland
15:24
wow that's mad amazing it's so cool okay
15:28
so it takes a
15:29
tiny bit of explaining so a group of
15:31
scientists have released a new study
15:32
which
15:33
is all about measuring the greenland ice
15:35
sheet there's a miles thick
15:37
ice sheet covering a huge amount of
15:39
greenland and
15:40
we know when ice forms because we know
15:42
how much snow falls and it packs down
15:44
and it becomes ice
15:45
and it gradually gets deeper and deeper
15:47
so the scientists have been studying the
15:48
period between
15:49
1100 bc 3000 years ago and 800
15:52
a.d and they've been measuring the
15:55
chemicals in there
15:56
and one thing we know from that time in
15:58
history is that rome was making lots of
15:59
coins
16:00
and the production of the coins so the
16:02
coins were silver that they
16:03
produced a lot of lead pollution because
16:05
they were using all which contained lead
16:07
that lead
16:08
wafted all the way across the world it
16:10
ended up in greenland
16:11
it gets rained down packed into the ice
16:14
and since 1999 scientists have been
16:16
measuring the lead levels corresponding
16:18
with exact
16:19
years in history and they've they can
16:23
produce documents now showing that for
16:25
example
16:26
um when rome devalued its currency in 64
16:29
a.d
16:30
there was less silver in each coin so
16:32
there would have been less lead produced
16:34
so there's less lead in the ice yeah
16:37
it's extraordinary nuts it's really good
16:39
it doesn't help people in ancient rome
16:41
who want to know whether to invest in
16:43
things no it doesn't
16:44
sadly but yeah
16:47
they follow i think they've debunked a
16:49
thought that uh
16:50
when the roman republic fell the economy
16:52
was booming and they've actually worked
16:54
out that when it came to the fall of the
16:55
republic
16:56
the lead amounts in the ice actually
16:59
show that it was undergoing a bit of a
17:00
recession
17:01
and stuff like when when rome took
17:02
carthage they got all the carthaginian
17:04
mines so suddenly they were mining a
17:06
hell of a lot more silver
17:07
and you can see that exact year of the
17:09
carthaginian invasion
17:10
from looking at the ice how far away is
17:13
the distance that we're talking here
17:15
from the mines
17:16
to the ice it's thousands of miles
17:17
thousands of miles it just shows you how
17:19
strong
17:19
wind is that's my main takeaway well i
17:22
just if you think about it
17:24
i'll tell you what's weird the
17:26
prevailing wind
17:27
in the world goes from greenland to the
17:30
east because of the jet stream so how is
17:33
it going it must be going all the way
17:34
around
17:35
all the way around the world i don't
17:36
know about that by the way it does
17:38
it makes sense right but it's like you
17:40
know how as well how um
17:41
there are sheep in wales that have been
17:43
affected by the chernobyl
17:45
radiation yeah like that's carried
17:47
through the wind in the lake district
17:48
and in the lake district it's just
17:49
windows you know so
17:52
that got there even faster than this two
17:54
thousand years
17:55
at chernobyl als also to the east
17:59
of the lake districts in wales but that
18:01
didn't go all the way around the world
18:02
so
18:02
maybe my jet stream theory it feels like
18:06
wind might be more complicated than just
18:07
the one big gust going around the world
18:11
there might be a couple of different
18:12
directions i think this is very powerful
18:14
flat earth evidence
18:15
yes yeah i'll probably be shouted down
18:17
in the comments about this
18:20
one explanation for it going the wrong
18:21
way is as one person pointed out
18:23
this is the um hypothesis at the moment
18:26
but for instance it ignores the fact
18:27
that china existed and was doing quite
18:29
well
18:29
around that time i think like western
18:32
scientists and historians always have a
18:33
tendency to do and it could well be that
18:34
china was just producing massive amounts
18:36
of
18:37
silver or lead or whatever that was
18:38
influencing it but
18:40
we don't know but it could be that
18:42
something was coming from the east to
18:43
affect it but it does seem to fit in
18:45
with these things in rome just yeah so
18:47
for instance there was a plague the
18:49
antonine plague which they think they're
18:51
not sure what caused it but lots of
18:52
people died it might have been smallpox
18:54
it might even have been ebola um
18:56
and it this was in between 250 and 262
19:00
um when 5 000 people a day were said to
19:02
be dying
19:03
and the amount of lead being produced
19:05
then obviously went down because people
19:06
had more
19:07
pressing things on their minds um but
19:10
they assumed
19:11
250 a.d who was it christians
19:15
they assumed it was to do the christians
19:17
and so they basically sought out as many
19:19
scapegoats as they could and they
19:21
kind of executed a load of clergy and
19:22
stuff like that wow
19:24
did it wow did it work did it work well
19:27
we no longer
19:28
have christianity
19:29
[Laughter]
19:32
on that um the a lot of people think
19:35
because it was so persecuted during this
19:37
plague
19:38
that kind of made christianity a lot
19:40
more
19:41
solid as a religion and that's kind of
19:44
what one of the main things that made it
19:45
such a worldwide religion in the end
19:47
wow there you go bully someone and make
19:49
them stronger
19:51
yes no don't bully someone no don't
19:54
bully someone but if you are being
19:55
bullied you'll come out of it stronger
19:57
okay is that right that's the healthier
19:58
message yeah um
20:00
so just quickly on this whole greenland
20:03
ice lead
20:04
thing um have you guys heard of claire
20:06
patterson
20:09
does she is she the uh venn diagram
20:12
of all those words
20:13
[Laughter]
20:15
she's a he actually he was a scientist
20:17
he was an amazing guy i wish we could do
20:19
a whole pokestop he was trying to find
20:20
out how old the universe was
20:21
in the 1950s okay so it was that
20:24
involves
20:24
calculating how fast uranium decays um
20:27
but he found massive lead contamination
20:29
everywhere he went
20:30
and it drove him out there was all this
20:32
lead showing up that shouldn't have been
20:33
there
20:34
he tried and tried and tried to build
20:35
this incredibly lead-free lab
20:37
basically he scrubbed everything he
20:39
cleaned everything for years
20:41
he founded basically the first ever
20:43
clean laboratory
20:44
and he proved that lead in petrol
20:48
was bad and that was he was that him
20:50
yeah he was the guy who demonstrated
20:52
later in his career that modern
20:53
americans had 600 times as much lead in
20:56
their bodies as ancient egyptians
20:58
all thanks to leaded petrol wow yeah and
21:01
so as part of this research he went to
21:03
remote spots in greenland and antarctica
21:05
and measured the lead much further down
21:07
so this is a
21:08
one of the stories of the last two
21:10
millennia is massively increasing
21:12
amounts of lead
21:13
and that led to all these efforts it led
21:15
yeah to all the efforts to cut lead out
21:17
of petrol for example
21:18
really yeah because the person who
21:20
invented putting lead in petrol was
21:22
thomas midgley
21:23
and that was a really good invention
21:24
because it stopped knocking in engines
21:26
right um so when it first happened
21:28
everyone thought this is an amazing
21:29
involved just putting lead in there that
21:30
solves this massive problem yeah but
21:32
there used to be all these little
21:33
explosions in the current
21:34
basically is when you put kerosene in
21:36
okay
21:38
and it's called knocking and they tried
21:39
hundreds of different experiments and
21:40
chemicals to try and get rid of the
21:42
knock
21:43
and once it did that was huge that made
21:45
cars a real thing
21:48
wow yeah this guy sounds awesome yeah he
21:50
does it's very bad for you
21:51
we should say lead lead is bad that is
21:53
not well isn't it true
21:55
um that the a lot of people put the fall
21:57
of the roman empire down to
21:59
lead in their pipes their plumbing was
22:02
that yeah the plumbing was made of lead
22:04
and so they were lead poisoned and
22:05
that supposedly killed off a lot of the
22:07
rich people
22:09
but don't know if that's true well i've
22:10
so roman miners they knew that lead was
22:12
bad
22:12
because they shielded themselves by
22:14
covering their mouths with animal
22:15
bladders
22:15
incidentally um so a lot of people knew
22:18
that love was bad for you but they still
22:20
kept the pipes being out of lead i think
22:22
some people said even at the time are we
22:23
sure about this
22:24
lead stuff yeah right and everyone said
22:26
no no that's fine would people
22:27
at the time have died a sort of they
22:30
would have just slowly got ill
22:31
and it would have looked like oh you've
22:32
got a flu and then it
22:34
or would it be interesting symptoms of
22:36
blood pressure yeah i think you go a bit
22:38
mad don't you i just wonder how long
22:40
it would take if someone sinister had
22:42
re-plumbed rudolph
22:44
rudolph hess replanned the city of
22:46
london with
22:47
lead piping
22:52
just subtly training every every single
22:54
one
22:55
how long there must be better ways but
22:57
how long before we would notice the fat
22:59
bugs
22:59
in alone it could be done a super
23:02
villain
23:03
rises to prominence in thames water
23:05
right yes and
23:07
slowly starts saying all the replacement
23:08
pipes have lead in them
23:10
and then 40 years later no what it's
23:12
really weird your body thinks that lead
23:14
is calcium
23:14
it mistakes the two chemically and it
23:17
absolutely shreds you on the inside it
23:18
gets in the way of all your
23:19
neurotransmitters and sends them crazy
23:22
it weakens the blood-brain barrier so
23:23
you're more vulnerable to it has about
23:25
30 different horrible effects on your
23:27
body well so your body tries to do the
23:28
same stuff with it
23:29
as it does with calcium like build your
23:31
nails and things like that yeah do you
23:33
have bones made of lead
23:34
i
23:36
[Laughter]
23:40
i'm not sure i don't know um i don't
23:42
know the full details
23:44
anyway it wouldn't be super efficient
23:45
though you couldn't guarantee
23:47
to wipe everyone out what an
23:48
infrastructure-based bond movie that
23:50
would be
23:50
over a period of several decades i just
23:52
wonder at what point would someone know
23:54
like hang on i think what london is
23:56
suffering from is everyone's being
23:57
poisoned by lead i'm looking forward to
23:58
this movie called lead finger
24:01
he does all this in london but also can
24:03
write things with his finger
24:08
i have a few things about uh great
24:11
things found in
24:12
ice um so in southern yukon
24:15
they have had ice melting uh recently
24:18
and there's a big patch that's
24:20
melted and underneath it they found all
24:22
this caribou dung that's been sitting
24:24
there
24:24
held in the ice now what's interesting
24:26
is there is no caribou
24:28
that exists in southern yukon but what
24:31
it's done is it's confirmed one of the
24:33
oldest
24:33
oral history stories that have passed
24:35
down from the first nations people
24:36
as it says in the article the first
24:38
nations people of the area who claimed
24:40
that
24:41
the land used to be roamed by caribou so
24:43
they did these tests on it and they've
24:44
discovered that
24:45
some of them are hundreds of years old
24:46
the dung some are thousands of years old
24:49
so an oral history that's made all the
24:50
way through that was thought to be wrong
24:52
has been confirmed
24:53
yeah frozen deer and ice are actually a
24:56
bit of a problem now though
24:57
aren't they so there was that thing last
24:59
year i think which was about the
25:01
permafrost melting
25:02
in siberia and when the permafrost melts
25:04
then it starts expo and this is a global
25:06
warming it exposes the dead bodies of
25:08
things that have died of bad diseases
25:09
and i think it exposed a reindeer
25:13
who had anthrax poisoning and it had
25:16
anthrax poisoning in 1895
25:18
but it released the anthrax back into
25:20
the atmosphere and i think someone died
25:21
of anthrax poisoning actually really
25:23
yeah and now scientists are saying that
25:24
you know as it melts and global warming
25:26
advances on us and it's going to release
25:28
all sorts of old stuff like bubonic
25:30
plague is going to
25:31
i've heard small parts like that small
25:33
box is going to come back yeah
25:34
it's a good sequel for your movie dan
25:36
yes the next movie the super villain
25:38
moves to siberia
25:40
with a hairdryer no
25:43
comes become largest hair dryer in the
25:45
world no he comes back here
25:48
selling ice cubes to everyone in london
25:52
yeah and everyone dies when they have a
25:54
cup of water all these films set only in
25:56
london
25:58
because it's james bond he's pretty true
25:59
yeah yeah
26:01
i really like this fact okay because
26:02
it's um sort of a historical thing being
26:05
revealed by science and it's kind of an
26:07
exciting
26:07
crossing of those two academic worlds
26:10
and something quite similar to that was
26:12
you know the saddle worth more fire
26:13
fires this year yeah um so that was in
26:16
the manchester area obviously
26:18
one side effect of those fires is that
26:20
it's going to release
26:21
all of this long-lost pollutant from the
26:23
industrial revolution
26:25
because it's i know it's exciting
26:27
[Laughter]
26:28
we're all going to die in some way
26:30
notice the people in north manchester
26:32
yeah just my family really yeah i'm
26:34
really sorry about that you should give
26:35
them a call
26:37
but the reason for this is that the peat
26:38
is an unbelievably good store so you
26:40
know people talk about peeping a really
26:41
good carbon store so it holds it for
26:44
hundreds of years
26:44
it's also a good store of other
26:46
substances and pollutants and then the
26:48
fires just set fire to it all and
26:49
release them all into the air
26:50
so we're getting to now inhale that
26:52
deliciously smoggy stuff that the
26:54
victorians and
26:55
it kind of rained down i guess right i
26:57
don't think you'll be able to see
26:58
sort of bits of 19th century coal
27:00
falling out of the sky
27:02
i mean sometimes you get that don't you
27:03
like when it's been
27:05
like it picks up sand from the sahara
27:07
and it rains down in
27:08
might get a bit more smoggy but you
27:10
won't be able to tell it's 19th century
27:11
coal particularly
27:12
there won't be a top hat raining down
27:14
with it or a pipe
27:16
hey that could be the third film you're
27:17
trying to feed yes pete
27:21
no he's the sex offender from the rock
27:23
sale i think yeah
27:25
now this you would need a the villain to
27:28
to create a gust of wind that sends all
27:31
the pete from manchester to london
27:37
yes okay so all right so the villain of
27:39
the second film survived into the third
27:41
because last week we did mention that
27:43
they're looking for a new director of
27:45
the bud films
27:52
[Applause]
27:55
[Music]
27:57
time for fact number three and that is
27:59
my fact my fact this week
28:01
is that the umlauts that are used
28:04
for the band motley crew are purely
28:07
decorative they're not intended to
28:09
have pronunciation however when motley
28:11
crue first performed in germany the
28:13
crowd didn't know that and chanted
28:15
mud liquor muddly crap
28:19
this is fantastic now this is this was
28:21
uh tweeted by wikipedia
28:23
a couple of days ago uh since we
28:25
recorded and
28:26
um we needed proper verification on it
28:29
and we got it
28:30
from tommy lee the drummer of motley
28:33
crue
28:34
or mud likra um who said ha ha
28:37
true nick to someone who asked him on
28:40
behalf of us so yeah we've got
28:42
confirmation
28:43
uh yeah that they were muddling crap
28:45
that's very exciting because the metal
28:46
umlaut is purely decorative motorhead
28:48
had it as well
28:50
um maxima park maximo park um
28:53
and uh yeah so that's very very exciting
28:56
um
28:56
it's a proper verification from a real
28:59
source which is
29:00
also awesome i was looking into tommy
29:01
lee if you don't know who he is so he is
29:03
the drummer of motley crue
29:04
married to pamela anderson married to
29:06
pamela anderson responsible for
29:08
the leaked porn video as well i don't
29:10
know if he leaked it but famously
29:12
her porn video uh there are two here's
29:14
one god this is a real trip down memory
29:16
lane
29:16
yeah yeah one of the first celebrity
29:19
stories i was aware of
29:20
you were the boom operator
29:24
i thought for about 15 years that tommy
29:27
lee was the same person as tommy lee
29:28
jones
29:28
and then i used to watch men in black
29:30
and be like i can't believe this guy
29:33
yeah yeah he does have a surname tommy
29:35
lee but he doesn't use it and i only
29:37
just learned it before we started
29:38
recording
29:39
it's bass and i reckon he doesn't use it
29:41
because he's the drummer
29:43
so that would have just been confusing
29:45
very yeah
29:46
whereas just shoving um left right and
29:48
center that aren't supposed to be
29:49
pronounced is absolutely fine
29:50
so it's just a convention in metal bands
29:52
right well i guess
29:54
not just metal bands because i just
29:55
learned as well that jay-z used to have
29:56
an umlaut in his name
29:57
wow yeah he over i guess well he doesn't
30:01
specify he just said i used to have an
30:03
umlaut and he uses punctuation
30:05
quite oddly he had a hyphen to begin
30:07
with he got rid of the hyphen
30:09
his latest album came back he not only
30:10
came back with a hyphen but in all caps
30:12
as well
30:13
so jay-z is now shouting at you yeah um
30:16
and he he admitted that he used to have
30:18
a number out i think we should have an
30:20
umlaut in our name or maybe some kind
30:22
of pokemon i think definitely it seems
30:23
like a surefire way to make yourself
30:25
sound hard
30:25
basically no such thing as a fish no
30:27
because then we sound like we're from
30:28
yorkshire
30:29
[Laughter]
30:31
there's no such thing as a fish
30:34
fine line between heavy metal and york
30:39
has jc ever done an autobiography he has
30:41
yeah is it called
30:42
j to z it's not and it should be why is
30:45
it not
30:46
and i'm pretty sure it is an a to z as
30:48
well you're kidding yeah no
30:49
no i'm pretty sure who does the data set
30:52
of their autobiography
30:53
that's quite a fun idea matt lucas did
30:54
it we should write nate as her book yeah
30:56
but you do
30:58
so b is bond but what do you do before
30:59
that oh yeah
31:01
um antenatal i guess yeah
31:05
it's not as good as the movie ideas
31:07
[Music]
31:08
let's stick to another secret of those
31:10
um so on
31:11
the metal umlaut um the first band to
31:14
have an umlaut was called
31:16
amon duel the second that's a-m-o-n
31:19
d u-m-l u-m-lout l wow and then two eyes
31:23
um but that is fair enough because dual
31:25
is a turkish word which has umlauts in
31:27
it
31:28
um and the first band to give itself a
31:29
spurious sunlight was
31:40
and the longest uh continuous umlauted
31:43
word
31:44
in the
31:46
[Laughter]
31:52
above are it's estonian and it means the
31:54
edge of the ice
31:56
so when you get to the edge of the ice
31:59
good
32:01
so yeah punctuation um so that i think
32:04
we've covered before the interrobang
32:07
maybe on qi
32:08
which was uh that was something that
32:10
actually appeared on typewriters in the
32:12
60s which was a question mark and an
32:14
exclamation mark that were
32:15
elided which means you're asking a
32:17
question but like are we going to the
32:18
cinema today
32:19
in a really excited way i had a really
32:21
sad childhood uh that was
32:23
the kind of thing that got me excited um
32:25
but another thing that the language has
32:27
always been hunting for is ways to show
32:29
irony right so people have always been
32:31
trying to
32:32
invent um bits of punctuation that show
32:35
you're being sarcastic
32:36
and actually the first person who
32:37
suggested a way of doing that was a guy
32:39
called john wilkins
32:40
and remember john wilkins no no he is
32:43
the guy
32:44
who also was the first person to plan to
32:46
put a man on the moon
32:47
and designed a rocket for it oliver
32:49
cromwell's brother yes
32:50
so was he suggesting that ironically uh
32:52
it was a one big joke
32:54
that got out of hand um yeah he also
32:57
wrote his main thing was he wrote this
32:58
huge book on how to change the language
32:59
and
33:00
he said you should have an upside-down
33:01
exclamation mark to show irony
33:03
wow they call that the suck mark don't
33:05
they yeah they do yeah it's a sarcasm
33:07
yes just on another symbol that uh
33:10
didn't kick off i read this fact and um
33:13
it's hard
33:14
actually to verify it um so i'd be
33:16
interested to know if anyone can get to
33:17
the bottom of this but haggard hawkes
33:19
who's a fantastic twitter
33:21
account and has a few books put this up
33:23
saying that in the in
33:24
1580 english printer henry denham
33:27
proposed using a reverse
33:28
question mark so a sort of mirror image
33:31
question mark to indicate
33:32
when a question was rhetorical which
33:34
would be very useful
33:36
if you were an author would it yeah yeah
33:39
it would no no
33:40
[Laughter]
33:44
um so we think that this might we're not
33:47
sure if this is true right because
33:49
we've not found anything earlier than
33:50
the 90s 1990s
33:52
of evidence for it although denim he did
33:56
invent two different types of question
33:57
mark one for yes no questions
34:00
and another one for questions that begin
34:01
with wh like why where
34:03
what so you had two different question
34:05
marks for those
34:06
what was that for why do you need a
34:08
special question to let you know the
34:10
question begins with wh because
34:11
in case it's been such a long sentence
34:13
that you can't remember the word
34:15
well i think the reason that we don't
34:16
still have them is because
34:18
um they're not that useful yeah but he
34:20
was the first person also to use
34:22
semicolons with any kind of regularity
34:25
he didn't invent them but he was the
34:26
first one to use them regularly nice
34:28
uh and consistently he also invented the
34:31
word
34:31
um parathesis for brackets which later
34:34
became parentheses
34:35
oh wow oh he had a huge influence yeah
34:37
so he was a massive kind of um
34:39
punctuation dude yeah but huge in that
34:42
world
34:43
amongst all the greats well semicolons i
34:45
didn't realize some people really hate
34:47
semi-colons basically
34:48
so george orwell he hated them so much
34:50
then he wrote a novel called coming up
34:52
for air
34:52
as one of his early ones i think and he
34:54
put no semicolons in
34:56
but then he was a bit worried that no
34:57
one would notice that he hadn't put any
34:59
end so he wrote to his publisher saying
35:01
i haven't put any semicolons
35:05
so childish i know one of the great
35:07
writers yeah
35:08
yeah hemingway as well very much so
35:11
played with the rules of punctuation but
35:13
he only did so
35:14
with the claim that he knew it so well
35:16
that he was able to go beyond
35:18
yeah the acceptable i think that's quite
35:20
normal yeah i think that's quite a
35:21
standard i would say people like hilary
35:23
mantel and rachel
35:24
cusk do that but it's because you can
35:26
feel they've got such a good grasp of it
35:28
that they're mastering it rather than
35:30
just spewing nonsense onto a page and
35:32
then
35:32
going oh yeah it's just i'm so familiar
35:34
with the art yeah yeah
35:36
so william blake would sometimes put a
35:37
full stop in the middle of a word
35:40
what a maverick is that because
35:44
it was to be read and he wanted the
35:46
punctuation of a word to be
35:48
broken up i don't know he also saw a lot
35:50
of angels so
35:53
he might have been taking dictation from
35:54
them guys the
35:56
punctuation point i need all the time is
35:58
a question mark colon
35:59
and i can't believe this isn't a thing
36:01
when you're writing an email and you're
36:02
like
36:03
what about these points and then you
36:04
give a list and i always put a question
36:06
mark followed by a colon yeah it looks
36:08
stupid
36:09
it's i think that's the most essential
36:11
piece of punctuation and no one's ever
36:12
come up with one as far as i know yeah
36:14
so how are we going to fix it
36:16
um is it a question mark with two dots
36:18
at the bottom
36:19
sideways unlocked at the bottom i have a
36:20
second dot underneath the first dot
36:22
so it's raised up like a side a yeah
36:26
what about a second dot in the middle of
36:27
the round bit of the question mark
36:29
like like an eyeball or a nipple
36:34
let's make the question mark a bit sexy
36:36
i think dots at the bottom makes more
36:38
sense doesn't it we could call them
36:39
question orcs
36:42
that's descended that's actually quite a
36:44
high brow point initially
36:45
[Laughter]
36:51
[Music]
36:53
okay it's time for our final effect for
36:54
the show and that is
36:56
schezinski my fact this week is that
36:58
traditionally
36:59
indigenous hawaiians had personalized
37:01
chants for their genitals
37:04
and that's unusual to them
37:08
uh this is it's this is so
37:11
amazing all of this uh stuff about
37:13
indigenous hawaiians and the what
37:15
they associated with their genitals
37:17
which i spent a lot of time reading
37:18
about this week
37:19
but i should say i read it initially on
37:20
the bbc it was such a cheat it was
37:22
a series of amazing sex packs from
37:24
around the world and i saw that i
37:26
couldn't believe i hadn't heard it
37:27
that's not a cheat this is that not a
37:29
cheat no it felt like a cheat
37:31
um you're allowed to get your flags from
37:33
anywhere i actually went to hawaii to
37:35
try and find something and i didn't find
37:37
anything
37:37
i went to hawaii he stood in the airport
37:39
and did a chance about my genitals
37:42
in the united states so
37:46
this started being recorded from the
37:48
18th century when cook and others
37:50
went to hawaii and yeah it turns out
37:53
that
37:54
indigenous hawaiians would give their
37:56
genitals a name or their parents would
37:57
give their genitals a name almost as
37:59
soon as they were born
38:00
and they'd also design they'd also write
38:03
a song for them and sort of
38:04
have a story around their genitals and
38:06
it's called the melee mai the genital
38:08
chant and it describes that individual's
38:11
organ so you had to sorry you had to
38:12
name your child and then you also had to
38:14
name your child's genitals it's hard
38:15
enough to find a good name for your
38:17
child isn't
38:18
it have you reckon they had books
38:21
the perfect name for your child's
38:22
genitals
38:24
i named my child's genitals after his
38:26
grandfather's genitals
38:31
one example that i found was queen
38:35
liliuokulani's
38:36
melee mai was the story of her vagina
38:39
and it was called ana pao which meant
38:41
frisky
38:42
and it was about her frolicking genitals
38:44
that went up and down apparently
38:47
so yeah if they're used to frolic it um
38:50
this i think the source of the
38:51
the beeb article was this paper by a guy
38:53
called milton diamond who studied
38:55
a lot of uh hawaiian sexual yeah
38:58
uh traditions and culture and things
39:00
about nudity as well
39:01
so this is really weird um nudity was
39:04
not sexual
39:06
no in almost all contexts um you only
39:09
started wearing your clothes
39:10
uh over your genitals when you hit
39:11
puberty and that was out of respect for
39:13
your genitals
39:15
it's amazing um but nudity for adults
39:18
was
39:19
symbolic of death or punishment or
39:20
lamentation and if you were seen nude
39:22
outside a ritual context it was widely
39:24
assumed that you had gone mad with grief
39:27
yes so it's not it's not a sexy it's
39:29
it's really not
39:30
nudist beaches very sad places in hawaii
39:34
it could also be used as an appeal for
39:36
forgiveness
39:37
this paper said so if someone's
39:41
done you are wrong then the way you ask
39:43
for their forgiveness is by taking all
39:44
your clothes off and following them
39:45
around until they forgive you turn up
39:47
outside their house at three in the
39:48
morning
39:48
[Laughter]
39:50
please forgive me please take me back
39:52
i've done that actually
39:56
my hawaiian heritage is it um
40:00
do we know if this is no longer being
40:02
done was this for
40:03
traditional old indigenous so what
40:06
happened was when the europeans came to
40:07
hawaii they saw
40:09
stuff happening but then they soon cut
40:11
it all out because
40:12
it wasn't very christian so there was a
40:14
lot of uh taking over hawaiian
40:16
culture and enforcing western and then
40:18
uh hawaiian
40:19
indigenous people have tried to take a
40:21
lot of it back but i think it's
40:23
obviously quite difficult because it was
40:24
lost for about
40:25
50 years said there was a basically
40:26
where they go the penis chant do we want
40:28
that back in
40:29
i'm good i think so like for instance
40:32
hula dancing is probably one of the most
40:33
famous things in hawaii
40:34
and captain cook said it was perfectly
40:36
easy and graceful he thought it was
40:38
amazing
40:39
but when the missionaries arrived it was
40:40
officially suppressed have you heard of
40:42
penis blowing
40:43
yes no i don't think you have i've seen
40:46
that tommy lee
40:49
it's a sequel to men in black
40:54
this is odd this was a daily ritual
40:57
for a hawaiian infant which is where the
41:00
members of the family would blow on the
41:03
penis
41:04
just you know just with a stream of air
41:06
just
41:07
and it was to prepare the foreskin for a
41:09
kind of micro circumcision ceremony
41:11
and it would normally be an aunt or a
41:12
grandmother who did the blowing yeah but
41:15
lots of relatives were qualified to be
41:16
the blower if you didn't have any answer
41:17
that's fine wait so what were they
41:19
blowing onto it sort of mic
41:20
just no they just blow to to protect it
41:23
in their mythology
41:24
yeah okay and this is a really common
41:26
thing and there were lots of people
41:27
even well into the 1980s for example who
41:30
had this done to them in their childhood
41:31
yeah in fact there was a story wasn't
41:33
there about a uh man
41:35
who was totally non-sexual we should say
41:37
yeah completely there was a story about
41:38
a man who was annoyed because he'd
41:40
married a hawaiian woman and he left her
41:42
mom
41:43
to babysit their child and came back and
41:45
found her doing this it was like why are
41:48
you blowing on my child's penis
41:50
and apparently the mother-in-law was
41:51
like well we i have to
41:53
otherwise it's very bad luck and was
41:55
really worried about the baby's health
41:56
if she didn't
41:57
um but it does it seem weird actually if
41:59
you haven't explained that beforehand
42:00
yes yeah i like it's another gust of
42:03
wind
42:03
fact going into the maybe it does have
42:07
interestingly you can tell the economic
42:09
activity of the roman empire from
42:11
discarded foreskins of
42:13
hawaiian children
42:18
oh my god um this uh the author of this
42:21
paper
42:22
um is called milton diamond as you
42:24
mentioned before and
42:25
the only thing that i could find of
42:28
interest outside of uh him writing this
42:31
paper so he wrote a lot about sex and
42:32
gender and
42:33
and so on um he had a big feud with a
42:36
man called money
42:37
so diamond and money had a big feud and
42:40
they famously
42:41
got into a punch-up at a conference in
42:44
dubrovnik
42:45
so money had written a book called as
42:47
nature made him the boy raised as a girl
42:50
and mentions it in this book this fight
42:53
and there was a lot of chat about
42:55
transgender at the time and
42:57
um so that's where they fell foul of
42:59
what they thought definitions were
43:00
and um yeah there was a fight although
43:02
diamond claims he didn't doesn't recall
43:04
being punched
43:05
but yeah the only thing with diamond he
43:07
is really hard isn't he
43:14
uh some i have some stuff on chance
43:16
great um
43:17
so this i just thought this was really
43:19
interesting i'd never heard of it before
43:20
but
43:21
uh have you guys heard throat singing oh
43:23
like mongolians
43:25
yeah so i didn't know that it didn't
43:27
sound like that though
43:30
it actually does sound a bit like that
43:32
um but i didn't realize that they're
43:33
creating
43:34
multiple notes yeah they do harmonies
43:36
don't they yeah with one throat
43:38
um so yeah this is like mongolians and
43:40
some inuits and it's called a tu
43:42
tuvan overtone technique when it's done
43:43
in mongolia and they can get up to six
43:45
simultaneous notes
43:47
to come out of their mouth by doing this
43:48
special throat singing uh technique
43:51
which i did not have time to look
43:52
properly into how exactly it works so
43:54
all i can tell you is
43:55
it involves opening and closing the
43:57
vocal chords until harmonic resonances
43:59
appear
44:00
and i think if you go faster and faster
44:02
different resonances come
44:03
wow and you make different noises but
44:05
it's really cool and then there's this
44:06
one other really cool
44:08
uh way of throat singing which is this
44:10
is an inuit culture
44:11
it's called the katajak and two women
44:14
stand
44:14
face to face but super close so the lips
44:17
almost touching each other
44:18
and it's like a duel a singing duel and
44:21
so
44:22
it goes really really fast one woman
44:23
says one note or throat noise and then
44:26
the other one has to respond to it and
44:27
it goes faster and faster and they use
44:29
each other's mouths
44:30
as kind of resonators basically and
44:33
it only ends when one of them like
44:35
collapses laughing or runs out of breath
44:37
and they can go on for hours and it
44:38
looks so cool that just sounds like
44:40
jeweling banjos
44:41
yeah so what you were saying is
44:45
so you got two people their mouths
44:46
opened and i'm making good noise into
44:49
the other person's mouth
44:50
and because they've got a mouth there
44:51
it's resonating though exactly
44:53
and it makes it sound resonating in your
44:55
mouth at the same time
44:57
well straight after you yeah exactly
45:00
so they're using your mouth as a musical
45:02
instrument that is so crazy it's
45:03
weird i know it's fun isn't it did you
45:06
have you heard any
45:07
yeah wow and it sounds cool sounds weird
45:10
the throat singing
45:11
the normal stuff the mongolian stuff
45:13
sounds a bit like didgeridoos doesn't it
45:14
does yes
45:15
yeah yeah
45:17
[Laughter]
45:24
um can i quickly mention because
45:27
naming of genitals is a practice that
45:30
still does go on um
45:32
there was a server that was done uh in
45:34
2015
45:36
and um it got reported in many places
45:38
because it was a genuine survey and they
45:40
found that 73
45:42
of men have given their penis a nickname
45:44
is that right yeah
45:46
59 say that it was a woman who came up
45:49
with their nickname
45:50
for them oh um so the survey was
45:52
commissioned by a men's retailer called
45:54
giacomo so this is a survey done through
45:56
them
45:56
so okay let's uh a few
45:59
nicknames i can't think of anything
46:01
that's not rude terry
46:03
so the top the top five give us uh what
46:05
letter does it begin with t
46:06
for terry is it one word it is one word
46:11
um and think i think um
46:14
sort of simulator i think what gods
46:17
though
46:18
no no because that's just someone with a
46:19
lisp sorry also a venereal disease
46:29
sorry this isn't a god i was trying to
46:30
put us in the ancient greeks all right
46:31
so when he said it's a girl oh
46:33
theseus no troy so try yeah yeah weird
46:37
doctor do little is that one no it's not
46:39
that's a shame russell the muscle is
46:40
rustle the muscle yeah it's not a muscle
46:44
it's an organ uh organs can have muscles
46:46
in them your heart's an organ it's
46:48
loads of muscle the good point but there
46:50
isn't a muscle in the penis
46:51
no well i've been working out
46:57
i've also been kicked out of the chair
47:03
okay that's it that is all of our facts

hello
00:16
and welcome to another episode of no
00:18
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:21
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:23
covent garden
00:24
my name is dan schreiber and i am
00:26
sitting here with andrew hunter murray
00:28
anna chazinski and james harkin and once
00:31
again we have gathered around the
00:32
microphones with our four
00:34
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:36
and in no particular order
00:37
here we go starting with you andy
00:41
my fact is that it's very hard for
00:43
scientists to spot armadillos having sex
00:45
because armadillos have sex while
00:48
running yeah i mean how fast do they run
00:51
too fast to see them
00:54
they would show up on film and in photos
00:56
but um
00:58
it's just a mating habit that they have
00:59
so whenever the armadillo female is in
01:01
heat
01:02
um she starts males start chasing her
01:05
but then she starts running away
01:06
so it's all a matter of the fastest
01:08
armadillo who can catch up with her but
01:09
she doesn't stop running when she when
01:11
he's caught up what so they engage in
01:13
yeah in sex mid right like passing a
01:16
baton on to
01:17
her kind of fatal disgusting
01:20
done in relays did you used to hold on
01:22
to the baton all the way around
01:24
no but he used to hold on to the penis
01:25
of the guy in front of him
01:28
well we got there quite quickly um
01:32
yeah it's quite it's kind of it's
01:33
amazing because they look like little
01:35
battery-operated toys because the
01:36
females just running along and you can't
01:38
really see their legs moving
01:39
and the male mounts the female but he
01:40
then has to run along only on his hind
01:42
legs
01:43
while he's mounted though yeah like a
01:45
wheelbarrow race
01:47
yeah your sports day must have been
01:50
awful
01:53
uh is this all armadillos because
01:54
there's quite a lot of different types
01:55
in there i
01:56
am not sure this was only observed in
01:58
one species so i don't think we can say
02:00
for sure or i
02:01
i certainly can't what do you know is it
02:02
the nine which one i think it's the nine
02:05
the nine oh the they've got such boring
02:08
names but they
02:09
yeah they sound like golf irons don't
02:11
they like the nine or the
02:13
three i mean the full name is the nine
02:15
banded armadillo to be fair i'm not sure
02:17
anyone's ever called it the nine before
02:19
but um
02:24
but yeah presumably they don't massively
02:27
like it because they generally don't
02:28
like each other do they armadillos
02:29
they're very solitary right that's true
02:31
yeah because the women
02:32
the female armadillos are always kind of
02:34
i was going to say beating off but
02:35
they're trying to get the mail away
02:37
aren't they
02:37
yeah most of the time until they're on
02:39
heat and then they kind of accept it a
02:40
little bit yeah
02:41
yeah well they're running away that's
02:43
true it is a bit like the benny hills
02:44
show
02:45
yes yeah um so the nine-banded armadillo
02:48
if that's who we are talking about the
02:50
nine the nine yeah um
02:51
don't always have nine did they not
02:54
sometimes have seven or eleven
02:55
they yeah i think that's just a mean
02:57
average that they have
02:59
to me that is a mean average you got
03:01
there
03:03
it's the six no i'm sorry this is the
03:05
sixth banded armadillo
03:07
okay is that because the only the one
03:09
you generally hear about is the nine
03:11
banded isn't it which is the one that
03:12
lives in
03:13
like that's the one when people talk
03:14
about armadillos it tends to be the nine
03:15
banded armadillo because that's the only
03:17
one that lives in north america
03:18
it's true although we could talk about
03:19
nine mountain damage the one that kind
03:21
of goes into a ball is a three-banded
03:23
armadillo
03:26
yeah there are 20 species of armadillo
03:28
and only two can roll themselves up
03:30
yeah swizz indeed have you guys my
03:33
favorite armadillo and this is the
03:34
armadillo i mainly read into
03:36
um is the which one is it
03:39
guys what was it the three the 29.
03:43
now my favorite armadillo is the pink
03:45
fairy armadillo
03:47
and they are so amazing get up a picture
03:49
of a pink fairy armadillo while you're
03:51
listening to the rest of this and for
03:52
the rest of your life
03:53
they're the cutest thing i've ever seen
03:55
so they're the smallest kind they're six
03:57
inches long
03:58
they've got pink shell this little pink
04:00
shell like like baby pink
04:01
a fluffy white belly and um they're just
04:04
so cute and they've got these
04:05
massive front claws which are almost a
04:07
bit grotesque because they're only for
04:08
digging
04:09
so they can't really walk properly they
04:11
can only dig
04:12
but um yeah they can bury themselves in
04:14
a couple of seconds so if something
04:15
comes along their shelves are actually
04:16
useless
04:17
in most armadillos they're not very good
04:18
protection in the shells but they just
04:20
bury themselves immediately
04:21
and yeah they are so cute they're really
04:24
fluffy they sound like pokemon yeah
04:29
and the shell is pink because they use
04:31
it for thermoregulation so they can pump
04:33
loads of blood to it
04:34
and that just gets rid of all the excess
04:36
heat in their body and they've also
04:37
they've got a bum plate
04:38
yes when they're digging when they're
04:40
digging through the earth they have a
04:41
little bump plate which just compacts
04:43
all the earth behind them
04:44
so that means that it creates like a
04:46
really strong burrow doesn't it
04:47
and also it means that they get the
04:48
earth out of their face so they can
04:50
breathe
04:50
it's got a square bum basically and it
04:52
bumps up against the earth to compact it
04:54
like you would with a spade if you
04:55
bashed a spade on earth yeah yeah yeah
04:57
and the opposite of that have we ever
04:58
talked about the glitter done which was
05:00
the prehistoric armadillo
05:02
which was so big that humans used its
05:03
shells for shelters
05:05
whoa whoa so we lived inside the shell
05:08
oh my god really amazing and it had like
05:10
a it was about the size of a car
05:13
and it had like a club tail that it
05:15
would bash humans with
05:16
my law yeah no i would do that as well
05:18
if someone was living inside my shell
05:20
do you think they took the armadillo out
05:22
first i think
05:24
uh death took it out first and then it
05:26
was just i don't know actually
05:27
that is incredible because today today
05:29
living inside your car is seen as
05:30
a sign of someone who's down in luck do
05:32
you think in the old days living inside
05:33
an armadillo shell was the same thing
05:35
oh he's living inside his armadillo
05:36
shell he's he's had a rough time i
05:38
reckon yeah
05:39
have we ever lived in a shell outside of
05:41
that i can't think of an example of
05:43
another animal
05:44
that's so cool yeah you always find the
05:48
most
05:48
weird angles i mean probably not
05:52
wow the first instance of humans living
05:54
in shells
05:55
that's so cool yeah um can i take us
05:58
back to the nine
05:59
for a second oh yeah yeah um so
06:02
they have a really interesting this is
06:04
just i was looking into the sex
06:06
life of the armadillo off the back
06:07
effect andy and uh
06:09
so nine the nine has quadruplets every
06:13
single time
06:14
oh every single time they have a baby so
06:16
the baby
06:17
uh basically splits a single fertilized
06:20
egg
06:21
um but it splits it so that they're
06:22
effectively clones of each other
06:24
yeah and those but every single time
06:26
those of them do it loads
06:27
i think most armadillos might have
06:29
quadruplets every time wow um
06:31
yeah these are and but because they're
06:32
identical it's to prevent inbreeding is
06:34
that right
06:35
or prevent incest and accidental but how
06:38
would that prevent it if they're all
06:39
well if if all four quads that you have
06:42
are males
06:43
they won't be able to integrate with
06:44
each other at least yeah and the nine
06:47
is the state small mammal of texas is it
06:50
what's a large
06:51
one it's um i didn't write it down
06:54
it does have one i think it's a kind of
06:56
deer or something okay so there's a
06:57
state small mammal of texas there's a
06:59
state large mammal there's a state
07:00
flying mammal
07:01
which is a kind of bat and there's also
07:03
a state welk
07:06
i didn't even know there was more than
07:07
one kind of wealth
07:10
everyone's stay woke is the same
07:13
something that's very cool about
07:14
armadillos is that
07:15
they have two ways of crossing water and
07:18
both are equally
07:19
groovy so they say
07:25
they inflate their stomach and
07:27
intestines with air if they want to
07:28
float
07:28
so they fancy looking at the view and
07:30
then they just float across the water
07:32
or they can deflate themselves and sink
07:34
right down to the bottom and then they
07:35
just walk along the bottom using their
07:37
claws
07:37
and they can hold their breath cool
07:38
that's amazing do you think they have
07:40
races
07:41
like where what they do yeah it's like
07:44
when there's two escalators
07:45
in the tube going up you always go one
07:47
on each so that you can see who goes
07:48
quickest
07:49
do you no
07:52
i thought there was usually one up and
07:54
one down otherwise how does everyone get
07:55
down the stairs so there's
07:57
there's often three in tubes wow there's
07:59
always two going up and one going down
08:01
and that's because
08:02
people coming down they come at a
08:03
regular amount of time but people going
08:05
up they all come off the train at the
08:06
same time so there's more people at the
08:08
same time
08:08
that's really interesting well i think
08:11
that's really interesting
08:13
that makes more sense i thought it was
08:14
for rush hour when you know if there are
08:16
loads of people
08:17
going into the station like at the end
08:19
of the day you'll have two you might
08:20
have two going down because occasionally
08:22
do that but almost always they have two
08:24
going up
08:24
a whole lot of sense and have we talked
08:26
about the leprosy thing
08:28
no so there you go but you should get
08:29
that checked out
08:32
um so the leopard they got the disease
08:36
from humans
08:37
we know that so this is hansen's disease
08:39
yes as you're supposed to call it but
08:41
most people call it leprosy exactly
08:43
um so they're native to the new world
08:46
the americas so when humans first
08:48
arrived
08:48
we know that they brought over leprosy
08:51
hansen's disease with them
08:52
at some point but as a result they're
08:55
really good at carrying it because their
08:56
body temperature is 34 degrees celsius
08:58
on the inside
08:59
and the leprosy bacterium loves that
09:01
temperature it's ideal for it
09:03
we're actually not ideal 37 37 but for
09:06
some reason
09:07
oh they live in our skin the bacteria
09:08
which is a bit cooler so they can
09:10
survive there
09:11
so a lot of people eat armadillo in
09:13
brazil
09:14
but unfortunately 60 of the armadillos
09:16
in the forest have it
09:18
and it's okay as long as you cook it all
09:19
the way through but some people have the
09:21
liver raw
09:22
oh so you can get leprosy that way or
09:24
some people keep them in their homes to
09:26
fatten them up
09:27
and obviously the more closed contact
09:28
you have with an armadillo the more
09:29
likely
09:30
you are and actually most humans are
09:32
immune to leprosy that's true aren't
09:33
they
09:34
but the ones that aren't you're buggered
09:37
so i think the lesson is i mean i was
09:39
always taught you can eat rare steak and
09:40
rare lamb but don't eat rare chicken and
09:42
rare armadillo i think that's all you
09:44
have to take away from this isn't it
09:46
armadillo shells can rebound bullets
09:49
people have found out in america
09:51
to their detriment
09:55
it seems like most people are basically
09:56
okay but um yeah in 2015 a man was taken
09:59
to hospital with injuries when
10:00
he uh was woken up by armadillos and a
10:02
bit of a pest in america because they
10:03
destroy your gardens
10:05
he was woken up at 3am so he went and
10:06
shot the armadillo and the bullet
10:08
rebounded and him in the face
10:10
he was okay he survived he was okay yeah
10:12
yeah how was the armadillo
10:13
uh they don't know about the armadillo
10:15
they didn't find it afterwards
10:16
oh well that implies it survived at
10:19
least it walked away
10:20
no it could have ricocheted away into
10:22
another garden that's true
10:24
i don't know that's how armadillos work
10:26
you're thinking of when you jump on a
10:27
turtle in super mario and they go
10:28
skating away
10:35
the walking underwater thing with the
10:36
armadillo feels a bit
10:38
risky to me i would would you would you
10:41
do the floating though because it feels
10:42
like with a floating you're kind of at
10:44
the risk of currents and stuff like that
10:45
and predators
10:46
you're much more exposed will be they
10:48
can only hold their breath for six
10:49
minutes so
10:50
i guess if you want to escape a predator
10:51
you could quickly deflate and
10:53
and sink as long as you're never more
10:55
than three minutes away from the edge of
10:57
the
10:57
river i guess you don't have to
11:00
and you get to a big rock underwater and
11:03
you've got to take a yeah
11:04
there is a scene just like this in
11:05
mission impossible five
11:08
yeah so are you sure that's the five i
11:11
thought that was the nine
11:15
[Applause]
11:19
[Music]
11:22
okay it is time for fact number two and
11:24
that is james okay my fact this week is
11:26
that the kuruwai people of new guinea
11:28
put grubs in their ears to eat their
11:31
earwax
11:32
so great and then what do they put in
11:33
their ear to eat the grubs a cow do they
11:36
put it
11:37
that's going right to the end i just
11:39
thought we didn't have time to do the
11:40
whole ride
11:43
um so yeah this is a thing these are a
11:45
tribe from new guinea and there's lots
11:47
of interesting stuff about them but um
11:49
one thing that a lot of people learned
11:50
in the last year or so
11:51
was um there was a tv show on bbc2
11:54
called my year with the tribe and
11:56
presenter will
11:57
millard let a grub crawl into his ear
11:59
and eat his ear wax
12:00
in this documentary um which everyone
12:02
thought was a bit weird yeah
12:04
even the didn't the trying person's the
12:06
didn't the korowai
12:07
um tribesmen say at the time the elders
12:09
used to do this we don't really do it
12:11
anymore so we've forgotten how it
12:12
started
12:12
shove it in and see what happens maybe
12:15
it is one of those things that you just
12:16
get foreigners in and you just make them
12:18
do stuff and say that it's traditional
12:20
is there a way of getting it out though
12:22
uh it just slithers out itself
12:24
apparently and it's slightly darker in
12:26
color having eaten all your ear wax
12:28
wow that's pretty cool and he said he
12:31
could hear it eating it inside his ear
12:32
couldn't he said i can hear it munching
12:34
away
12:35
that would be the spot that you would
12:36
get you'd hear access to hearing yeah
12:39
i mean that doesn't surprise me um yeah
12:42
he's a
12:43
i really like will millard i realized in
12:44
the course of researching this
12:46
he's on lots of very cool stuff but yeah
12:48
he went to papua and lived with those
12:50
people for
12:50
a few months i think but he had an
12:53
extremely bad time he seems to have very
12:54
bad luck
12:55
and he's actually got ptsd now from
12:57
being basically
12:58
doing all these documentaries in these
13:00
extreme places but he said um at one of
13:02
the points in papua he said i made a
13:03
serious error of judgment
13:05
that saw me not on an ancient
13:06
inter-tribal trade route but trapped
13:08
deep within a 400-mile square of
13:09
uninhabited snake-infested and extremely
13:11
hostile forest
13:12
we crawled out a month later lacerated
13:14
and covered in infections
13:15
but yeah he's had cerebral malaria he's
13:18
been you know assaulted he's
13:20
been robbed at bow and arrow point which
13:23
is
13:23
kind of a cool life experience yeah it's
13:26
become the trauma
13:27
yeah i think oh it was a different
13:29
program wasn't it but the beep got in a
13:30
bit of trouble
13:31
because the coral white traditionally
13:32
live in tree yeah and that be
13:34
made a program all about them building
13:36
the treehouses and then it turned out
13:38
that they sort of said can you build a
13:39
treehouse for this program that was will
13:41
millard who had discovered it
13:42
that was when he went back and did this
13:44
program and they said when those last
13:45
bbc guys came
13:47
they told us to build that tree house
13:48
and he was the one who
13:50
said well that's not on i'm gonna
13:51
mention that wow right but they
13:53
so is it a myth it's not a myth that
13:56
they live in tree houses
13:57
no they do not they do so i don't think
13:59
that's that's bad
14:03
those ones did not live in tree houses
14:05
like that they said we would never build
14:07
treehouses that high
14:08
right and got it some of them live on
14:10
the ground but some of them
14:11
i think still live in tray houses
14:13
they're only about 4 000 coral white
14:14
people
14:15
alive yeah there aren't very many of
14:17
them yeah so there were rumors
14:19
that the korowai people sometimes
14:21
engaged in
14:23
cannibalism yeah but they got asked
14:25
about it and they said no we would never
14:27
eat a person what we'd eat is a kakua
14:29
which is a witch who takes the form of a
14:32
person
14:32
yeah and this doesn't happen anymore but
14:36
ten years ago it wasn't living memory so
14:37
it happened a few decades ago
14:39
um and the decade in fact yeah
14:42
um but the the the kakawa is basically
14:45
their version of germ theory
14:47
so they like when someone dies they say
14:50
well what's this
14:51
because um jam theory is not very well
14:52
known they assumed it was a witch
14:55
so when a clan member was dying he would
14:57
whisper
14:58
to his relatives the name of who he
15:00
thought was the witch who
15:01
who had killed him so that's a good way
15:04
to take out someone who
15:05
just kind of has been pissing off this
15:07
is a great deathbed practice we should
15:08
adopt but then
15:09
it's very much open to abuse isn't it
15:11
from the person who heard the whisper
15:13
the only person who heard the whisper
15:15
that's true of course but this is i mean
15:18
i think there are quite a lot of kurowai
15:20
spread around in different groups of
15:22
korowai and there was a guy paul raphael
15:24
who famously went there in 2006 and he
15:26
went very deep
15:27
uh in and he met one who said who was
15:29
still a famous kakoa killer
15:31
um who showed him a skull and stuff and
15:33
ate the skull in front of him
15:35
um and yeah so who who knows apparently
15:38
it tastes like
15:39
he asked what it what human flesh tastes
15:40
like and it tastes like cassowary
15:43
okay so now you can picture it
15:46
i've got something on earwax
15:49
yeah uh in the middle ages earwax was
15:52
used to color manuscripts in
15:54
cool really yeah or the color of the ink
15:56
used for manufacturing i was just gonna
15:57
say
15:58
ink yeah yeah it was partly earwax wow
16:01
partly stale beer what do you mean they
16:02
mixed the ink up with the neo-max is one
16:04
of the ingredients yeah
16:05
cool yeah so some of those ancient
16:07
beautiful documents will be partly
16:09
earwax
16:10
monk earwax probably yeah yeah some of
16:13
the worst
16:14
interesting you say about beer and
16:16
earwax um we read once
16:18
um when we were researching for qi that
16:20
if you put earwax in someone's beer
16:22
then all the froth will disappear from
16:24
the top of the beer
16:25
and we tried to do it as an experiment
16:26
on the show um but it didn't work
16:29
but it did enhance the taste i don't
16:32
think anyone actually drank it in there
16:34
who xerox did you get i can't remember
16:36
oh yeah
16:37
probably producer pierce fletcher's
16:38
elixir
16:39
[Laughter]
16:41
but yeah we did try it but the idea is
16:42
because it's got oil in hasn't it it's
16:44
got and the idea is that oil would um
16:46
kind of pop the bubbles a little bit was
16:48
that the thing that monks did too
16:50
i don't think they did did they i
16:52
thought with their beer they sort of
16:54
it was the best well when they were
16:55
painting the manuscripts they it was the
16:57
way they prevented bubbles from forming
16:59
in the liquid they used so the liquid
17:01
was called glare which was
17:03
what they used to make the paints and
17:04
supposedly to stop the froth forming on
17:06
the glare
17:07
they put their robots into that okay so
17:09
was earwax
17:10
uh sort of a lucrative business to be in
17:13
if you generated a lot it's huge it must
17:16
be a traded thing right
17:17
you know i'm writing a book at the
17:18
moment it must be i think you everyone
17:20
has a ready supply don't they
17:22
well some people i don't know you can't
17:24
corner the market in earwax though
17:26
you could even the most productive
17:28
earwax sir
17:30
i guess you could go house to house
17:31
collecting people's earwax yeah selling
17:33
a jar of it because they had
17:35
gunk farmers didn't they who would
17:36
collect people's poo for
17:38
um you know for fertilizer and stuff and
17:40
everyone has a plentiful supply of that
17:42
yeah you might as well get earwax at the
17:44
same time you're saying yeah
17:46
i wonder where socially the gong firmer
17:48
dun collector and the earwax collector
17:50
are next to each other i think they have
17:52
christmas parties together yeah
17:54
because no one else invites them we
17:57
could have traded earwax though with
17:58
the far east because they've got
18:00
different ear wax twists don't they
18:02
which i don't think we've mentioned
18:03
before but uh asian east asian countries
18:05
so in china and japan korea
18:07
um there's a gene the gene has changed
18:10
so their earwax is kind of powdery
18:12
and i think doesn't taste as gross um so
18:16
well because it's like powdery in it
18:18
doesn't have the the bitterness that
18:19
ours has and it's not as gloopy
18:21
um the vast majority but whose taste do
18:23
you is that a thing
18:24
no i've actually just assumed that
18:25
because i've read about it and it
18:27
doesn't
18:27
contain the stuff that makes sense
18:29
doesn't it no it makes sense it just
18:31
sounded like that was a thing that
18:32
people taste you know how like some
18:34
people eat their boogers
18:36
no but you know sometimes when you put
18:37
your finger in your ear and you
18:38
accidentally put your finger in your
18:39
mouth and it's absolutely oh yeah
18:49
[Laughter]
18:55
well there were people who tasted
18:57
eurobacks they were doctors in ancient
18:58
greece there was
18:59
that was the whole theory because it was
19:00
all about the theory of the humors you
19:02
know the different substances that made
19:04
up your
19:04
body so hippocrates said there were
19:07
particular tastes for bodily fluids
19:09
so he would taste your earwax your
19:10
doctor and he might lick your vomit
19:13
um or run his fingers through your
19:15
phlegm to check the consistency
19:16
so he probably got up close it's so
19:20
unromantic he ran his fingers
19:22
through her plan
19:26
and do you know what's the most common
19:28
thing the most common living thing to
19:30
get in your ear
19:31
um an earwig you would have thought but
19:33
they don't seem to do it as much
19:36
an ant uh larger in fact a little spider
19:40
spider
19:40
uh no i'm gonna let you know it's
19:43
a giant armadillo is it the nine is it a
19:46
three
19:47
it's got me three the furry little the
19:50
pink fairy think fairy it's the
19:51
12-banded cockroach
19:53
no it's it's just a cockroach
19:54
cockroaches love ears
19:56
oh my goodness and yeah and that's by
19:58
far the most common uh creature to go in
20:00
your ear and it's because they've got
20:02
this thing i had never heard of this
20:03
word
20:04
they've got positive thigmataxis and the
20:06
thigmataxis
20:07
describes how much you like the stimulus
20:09
of touch so
20:10
some animals will have negative
20:11
thigmataxis um
20:13
they don't want to be touched and
20:14
cockroaches want their whole body to be
20:16
touched all the time
20:17
so they're they're so needy aren't they
20:20
so clingy
20:21
they love a massage full body massage
20:24
every single time
20:25
never just the shoulders but that's why
20:28
they love ears so they go in because
20:29
they like
20:30
being in tiny little nooks and crannies
20:32
and that's why they'll always squeeze
20:33
into little cracks
20:34
in your house and also they quite like
20:36
the fatty acids
20:37
do any of us know someone who've had
20:39
who's found a cockroach in their ear i
20:40
don't
20:42
none of my friends told me does anyone
20:44
know anyone who's found anything in
20:45
their ear no
20:46
it's still not as common as the common
20:48
cold and also we don't really have
20:50
cockroaches in this country very much
20:51
do you not oh okay not as much no we
20:54
don't dan person who's lived here for
20:55
about 14 years i thought i had
20:57
i reported termites the other day in my
20:59
house turns out they're not in england
21:03
the guy the guy on the phone was like
21:05
that's fascinating i'll be over as soon
21:06
as possible
21:06
i was like wow he was keen uh they were
21:08
flying ants
21:10
oh my gosh i read on a bbc source
21:14
that some of the earliest lip balms were
21:16
made of earwax and i can't i don't
21:17
believe it
21:19
i regret mentioning it thanks for
21:20
bringing it uh
21:22
are they saying like ancient egyptians
21:24
and stuff like that yeah
21:26
but i just it would taste bitter but
21:28
what if they were asian ear wax doesn't
21:29
that taste nice
21:30
but that's drier and crumbly so it also
21:32
doesn't taste fantastic you're taking
21:33
the wrong thing
21:34
[Laughter]
21:36
it does feel like someone's opened a tub
21:37
of carmex thought that looks a lot like
21:39
earwax
21:40
here's a room i'll spread on the
21:41
internet i read that in uh bits of asia
21:44
so
21:44
india and china um ear picking is seen
21:48
as
21:48
a a nice pampering thing to do really
21:51
enjoyable
21:52
so so much to the point where you can
21:54
have it done on the side of streets
21:55
there's vendors
21:56
it's so luxurious you can get it done on
21:58
the side yeah
22:00
yeah there's such demands it's a career
22:02
it's a dying career though
22:03
because young people are more interested
22:05
on their phones and they don't want to
22:06
have their ears picked by a stranger
22:09
you can be on your phone and have your
22:10
ear picked at the same time yeah that's
22:12
very true one of the few things you can
22:13
do
22:14
not if you're talking to two people at
22:15
once on two different phones sure i
22:17
forgot you could use phones to phone
22:19
people
22:21
but it's true that they have this whole
22:23
set of picks don't they these yeah
22:26
yeah yeah and it lights up so you can
22:29
see inside the ear when you're picking
22:30
you you can't what does every mirror no
22:32
no you do it for other people like you
22:34
said it's like uh
22:35
yeah yeah but um i don't use it by the
22:37
way i just bought it as a
22:38
video but the thing is that cotton buds
22:40
are being banned in the uk
22:42
so there's every chance that the ear
22:43
spoon or the roving ear cleaner could
22:45
make a comeback
22:47
post brexit
22:48
[Laughter]
22:50
no smartphones but here's your roving
22:52
ear cleaner
22:54
thanks boris
23:03
[Music]
23:05
okay it is time for fact number three
23:07
and that is my fact
23:08
my fact this week is that the biggest
23:10
single biomedical laboratory in europe
23:12
designed to encourage scientists to chat
23:14
more to each other is so noisy that
23:17
scientists are actually complaining it's
23:18
too hard to concentrate
23:20
um this this is a this amazing building
23:23
that's up uh
23:24
in london it's uh in the houston area
23:27
and
23:27
it is uh it's ginormous it's it's 1250
23:32
people work there they're collaborating
23:33
from different fields of medicine
23:35
um and it's the francis quick institute
23:37
isn't it that's right it's called the
23:38
francis creek institute or its nickname
23:40
so it's run
23:41
the head of it is sir paul nurse who is
23:43
a nobel prize winning
23:45
scientist uh so its nickname is sir
23:47
paul's cathedral
23:49
uh which is quite a cool name yeah yeah
23:51
and he had influence over the design
23:52
didn't he and he said that he wanted the
23:54
atmosphere to encourage a gentle sort of
23:56
anarchy
23:57
um so yeah you don't necessarily want
23:59
scientists to talk to each other all the
24:00
time i suppose is what
24:01
we're saying sometimes you just need to
24:02
be quiet and in a test tube right yeah
24:04
well there
24:05
i i suppose the problem is no i'm not in
24:07
a test tube
24:08
unless you're a test tube baby yes then
24:11
stay in your test tube
24:12
i think there's a difference between
24:13
creating an atmosphere where people are
24:15
there to work and collaborate
24:17
as well as creating a sort of cafe-like
24:19
atmosphere where people just come
24:21
because they know that that's where
24:22
their buddies are going to be so i think
24:23
a lot of people are distracted when
24:25
they're trying to do quiet work on an
24:27
idea by phd students coming in who've
24:29
just graduated
24:30
or so on and and having parties without
24:34
uh not without actually having the party
24:36
but effectively grouped
24:38
yeah yeah so yeah and this is not
24:40
everyone who's complaining it's working
24:41
incredibly well this yeah
24:43
it's not it's like it's not failed it's
24:45
literally
24:46
one dude do you know what's underneath
24:48
it
24:49
uh underneath underneath france's creek
24:53
building institute it's round about
24:55
where boudicca was buried
24:56
supposedly oh well she's been joined
24:58
actually is it
25:00
plague a boudicca plague probably some
25:02
plague
25:03
sure and also so it's obviously named
25:05
after francis crick
25:06
and his son mike is still alive and he
25:08
donated crick's california license plate
25:11
uh into a time capsule which is buried
25:12
underneath the building so the ceremony
25:14
they buried it
25:15
yeah is there a reason for that i didn't
25:17
the license plate number was a t
25:19
g c so those are the four letters that
25:21
make up dna
25:23
so that's what that is that's so
25:27
a clever g and c that's yeah that's
25:30
cool um so that's underneath there which
25:32
is what crick did
25:34
which is this is all coming together
25:39
was it was it golden and
25:44
as we tend to say it for some reason
25:46
rosalind franklin
25:47
roslyn franklin who's been um left out
25:50
of uh the history book very much
25:52
best of um the dna dna yeah
25:55
if pete best had secretly written all
25:56
the beatles songs which
25:58
according to my theory he did
26:02
um so this thing is is it all about open
26:05
plan basically yeah it's an open plan
26:07
office it to an extent if you look
26:09
inside it's obviously got levels
26:11
um but it's one of those ones where it
26:13
all looks down into a big
26:15
courtyard of of desks uh and everything
26:18
seems to be open yeah
26:20
because open plan uh is very
26:23
it's kind of controversial now right in
26:25
fact i think most studies show that it's
26:27
a negative thing has a negative impact
26:28
on work
26:29
and it's very trendy but i get really
26:31
confused because people talk about open
26:33
plan as if it's like a trendy cool thing
26:34
and it seems so obvious to me
26:36
surely the reason we have open plan and
26:38
it's generally in britain and america
26:40
is that it's just a hell of a lot
26:41
cheaper saves money on walls it just
26:43
saves a hell of a lot of money you can
26:44
squash way more people in
26:46
i think we just should stop pretending
26:47
we're doing it for the good of our
26:48
employees for bonding and stuff and be
26:50
like sorry guys we're cheap
26:52
yeah we have how many rooms do we have
26:53
in this building we have four
26:55
we should have a maximum of four members
26:57
of staff here at any one time
26:59
and we should all get a room each that's
27:02
what they have in places like
27:03
germany and scandinavia like everyone
27:05
will have a writer in office because
27:06
that's a better way
27:08
to work well the person who invented
27:10
cubicles he was called robert propst
27:12
and he thought that it would be like a
27:14
dynamic everyone would have that area
27:16
and would be really dynamic and you
27:17
could move around it and it would be
27:19
really good for work but of course what
27:21
happened was companies just made them
27:22
smaller and smaller and smaller until
27:24
it was the smallest amount that one
27:25
person could work in and then obviously
27:27
it had the opposite effect
27:28
yeah um a friend of mine their office is
27:31
being relocated completely to a new
27:33
place that is going to be
27:34
this open plan layout but they're taking
27:36
it a step further now
27:37
where no one will have an assigned desk
27:40
it will be
27:41
hot desking and the theory behind that
27:43
is that
27:44
uh the idea is that's going to encourage
27:46
more work because
27:48
you want to get to work as early as
27:49
possible to find a good seat next to an
27:51
influential person
27:52
because everyone of every level is going
27:54
to be sitting around this same desk
27:56
so if you want to get next to the boss
27:58
yeah close to them you arrive at 8 30 in
28:00
the morning what if the boss doesn't
28:02
come until 10.
28:03
it's the whole thing's a risk you got to
28:04
work out the rhythm see when they arrive
28:06
or that sort of stuff but in theory
28:07
that's why we just hide in the toilets
28:09
watching the office and waiting for the
28:10
boss to arrive
28:11
then lots of people hide in the toilet
28:13
everyone's just going to be following
28:15
the bus
28:16
like a horny armadillo
28:20
massive conga line i've never heard that
28:21
as a justification for
28:24
hot desking because everyone always
28:25
claims that's a good thing hot desking
28:26
and you don't have too much your own it
28:28
is more efficient
28:28
because you always do have a couple of
28:29
people in a big office you'll have x
28:31
people who don't
28:32
turn up or who are ill or who are
28:34
traveling for business or whatever so
28:35
you know there is a but it's risky
28:37
because people leave
28:38
food on their desk or people will leave
28:40
mugs leave books
28:47
no reason um so anna you know how you
28:49
stand up at your desk quite a lot yeah
28:51
um i read that according to a study
28:53
office workers could lose
28:54
half a stone a year by standing up at
28:56
their desks that's why i'm actually
28:58
in minus weight now i weigh minus two
29:01
stern
29:02
if i'd have stood up for the last 12
29:04
years i've been working at qi i would
29:05
now weigh about eight stones
29:09
i imagine that's how that works yeah so
29:11
i was
29:12
looking up uh distraction and
29:13
concentration and things like that yeah
29:15
um so when you're concentrating or when
29:18
you think you're concentrating it turns
29:19
out that if you look at your brain
29:20
activity you're actually distracted
29:22
quite a lot
29:23
so in between bursts of attention
29:26
attention is
29:26
they the study uh described it as a
29:29
search light
29:30
that sort of shines on the thing you're
29:31
reading or the thing you're studying and
29:33
then shines away again just to see if
29:34
there's anything more important or
29:36
dangerous going on
29:37
that you need to know about so how often
29:40
do you guess that happens that the brain
29:41
sort of scans the area
29:42
every five three minutes okay every 45
29:45
seconds
29:46
it's four times a second four times a
29:49
second it's not worth it you're not
29:50
getting anything done
29:52
i totally i'm not like i totally phased
29:55
out while you were explaining
29:56
brilliantly
29:57
genuinely to be fair he was scanning for
29:59
danger
30:01
four times a second no no
30:04
your brain basically alters your
30:06
perception to make you think it's a
30:07
constant movie
30:08
of you just focusing on one thing four
30:10
times a second your brain
30:12
sort of temporarily takes its attention
30:14
away just wouldn't get early for me
30:16
this is this is it happens yeah that's
30:19
cool
30:19
very cool okay so each of these scan
30:22
aways yeah they must be an
30:24
absolute micro million yeah it's sure
30:26
it's not it doesn't take like a quarter
30:28
of a second four times a second
30:29
is it just like breathe uh blink no
30:32
it's not like i wish you hadn't zoned
30:34
out while i'm saying
30:36
i'm not gonna go back and say that i'll
30:38
get another podcast
30:41
can i i found something about a
30:42
laboratory oh yeah
30:44
um that i had never heard i thought was
30:46
super cool have we mentioned this before
30:47
you mentioned the um
30:48
special feces studying lab in the soviet
30:51
union
30:52
so this was in the 1940s the ussr
30:55
developed a secret lab for studying
30:58
world leaders
30:59
poo and what it was to find out stuff
31:02
about them and the justification
31:03
that people have um made uh have
31:05
backdated to it is that we didn't really
31:07
have cctv or other ways of watching
31:09
people so we collected their poo instead
31:11
um and this is generally someone found
31:12
this out a couple of years ago going
31:14
through these old archives
31:15
and barrier you know stalin's sort of
31:17
right-hand mount barrier was in charge
31:18
of it
31:19
um and it was a special department and
31:21
for instance in 1949
31:23
uh they had special toilets installed
31:26
for mao
31:26
when he came and visited and they
31:28
weren't connected to the sewers they
31:29
were connected to
31:30
boxes underneath his lou which they then
31:32
collected and they went through it
31:34
and it was like if you found certain
31:35
things like apparently if you found
31:37
amino acid uh tryptophan it meant they
31:40
were calm and approachable
31:41
and perhaps you could do a deal with
31:42
them and the theory was if there wasn't
31:44
very much potassium in their poo
31:46
then they were had a lack of sleep and
31:47
might be a bit stressed a bit tetchy
31:49
give them a banana give them a bloody
31:50
banana and they won't press the red
31:52
button
31:52
but we know now that people are still
31:54
doing this right so kim jong-un did it
31:56
during the singapore summit this year
31:57
brought his own toilet
31:58
for exactly the same reason was that so
32:00
they couldn't steal his poo and study it
32:02
yeah
32:02
yes yes so he would have taken all of
32:04
that back to north korea when he left
32:07
lucky then he's bizarre yeah it is weird
32:10
but then
32:10
we now know that there's a historical
32:12
justification for it yeah
32:14
i always thought it was them just being
32:15
paranoid but i think it is them being
32:18
paranoid okay oh no although you know
32:20
that they were doing it and we know
32:22
now i bet you can learn way more from
32:23
someone's view if there's a house guest
32:25
visiting my place i'm not ashamed to say
32:27
oh i'll analyze
32:28
yeah i do think you should be ashamed to
32:30
say that
32:32
why do you keep giving me bananas
32:43
okay it's time for our final fact of the
32:45
show and that is chozinski
32:47
my fact this week is that the largest
32:49
sunflower farm in ontario has been
32:51
forced to shut because so many people
32:53
were taking selfies there
32:55
and this is it's a really funny story
32:57
it's from this summer and the farm is
32:58
called bogle seeds farm it's in a place
33:00
called hamilton
33:01
and it's absolutely massive they've got
33:03
1.6 million
33:04
sunflower plants over 68 acres and they
33:06
thought it'd be quite a good idea to
33:07
make a bit of extra cash
33:09
challenge people some dollars by saying
33:11
you can come here
33:12
park up in this little car park we've
33:13
got take a selfie here you go and it
33:16
went
33:16
mad they were completely swamped
33:19
thousands and thousands of people came
33:21
um there was four kilometers of
33:23
stationary traffic
33:25
backed up on the road uh leading there
33:27
there was a 300 car parking lot and uh
33:29
any one time there were seven thousand
33:31
cars trying to park in it
33:33
and it just turned into complete chaos
33:34
they trashed the place
33:36
and so they had to shut it people were
33:37
cutting off the tops of sunflowers
33:39
someone said that one one person
33:40
urinated on one of the neighbor's
33:42
bushes it was bad the pictures did look
33:45
quite cool
33:46
didn't they the pictures look really
33:47
nice sometimes they're still pretty they
33:49
are yeah
33:49
lovely photos of people winging and
33:51
fighting and smashing their cars
33:53
on instagram that's not what the photos
33:55
were they were just nice pictures of
33:56
people with sunflowers that's true i
33:57
didn't see a single weir
34:00
apparently people brought ladders to
34:01
this place so you can go into the field
34:03
and then climb up a ladder so you can be
34:05
poking out above the top of the
34:06
sunflowers which i think is quite clever
34:08
and also maybe just because they're so
34:09
tall sunflowers i can't believe how high
34:11
they can get
34:12
oh yeah they might just want to get to
34:13
the top the largest that we have on
34:15
record this is a guinness world record
34:16
is 30 feet
34:17
in one inch i can't that can't have been
34:20
a happy sunflower though
34:21
why because it would be quite stressed
34:23
wouldn't it self-conscious
34:25
everywhere and it's much shorter i think
34:27
about that but you surely you would
34:28
i wonder they must grow to to get more
34:30
light and they if they need more light
34:32
they must be stressed right
34:34
yeah so for instance four leaf clovers
34:37
they only grow if they're stressed for
34:39
leaves
34:40
because they need an extra leaf to get
34:41
more light and more energy
34:45
so usually when a plant does something
34:46
weird it's because they're stressed out
34:48
so now whenever we find a full leaf
34:49
clover we have to go oh that's so
34:51
sad rather than thinking it's good
34:53
that's what i always do
34:54
oh my god such a killjoy 30
34:57
feet yeah yeah i mean how
35:02
at the bottom of a well well this is
35:03
this is a guy who's managed to
35:05
top his own record a few years in a row
35:07
so he's
35:08
he's just a group i mean do you have to
35:10
have it trellised to something
35:12
they're quite strong sunflowers that
35:15
were super tall and they didn't have any
35:17
um really but not 30 feet tall um i
35:19
should just say that the
35:21
sorry the reaction of the bogel seed
35:24
farmers
35:25
uh was negative to this chaos so just to
35:27
conclude the story
35:28
because you should really go on their
35:29
website so they closed down the farm
35:31
they said we're not having anyone else
35:32
here this year although they are still
35:34
selling seeds
35:34
but no one can come anymore and you
35:36
should go to the website uh
35:38
because it's so aggressive they've got
35:40
about like seven different notices
35:42
saying
35:42
so they say unfortunately with the
35:44
police involved you know all lots of
35:45
capitals they have to call the police
35:47
uh we've had to close the photo
35:49
opportunities due to traffic jams
35:50
etcetera
35:51
there's a big one of those running
35:52
banners that you get on slightly mad
35:53
people's websites um
35:55
like in capital letters closed for the
35:58
season
35:59
wow i mean they sort of asked people to
36:01
come
36:02
yeah and then lots of people came they
36:04
didn't know how popular they'd be
36:05
they're the people's fault for coming
36:07
it's not any individual person's fault
36:08
for the individual urinator in the
36:10
bushes yeah
36:13
yeah i think i can blame those people
36:15
and they do say now they've still got
36:16
people coming who will like swear and
36:17
abuse them and say no i've driven four
36:19
hours to get here
36:21
uh you've got to let me just check the
36:22
website before you go check the website
36:24
guys
36:24
um so sunflowers are massive in russia
36:27
in
36:28
every sense of the word okay um but so
36:30
they're from america originally
36:32
sunflowers and then they were brought
36:33
over to
36:34
europe uh and in the 18th century
36:38
they were really popular in russia
36:39
because you were banned from consuming
36:42
oil during lent
36:43
but you weren't banned from consuming
36:44
sunflower oil loophole
36:47
because they didn't know existed they
36:49
wrote the rules yeah
36:50
so um so it's just an absolute get
36:52
around and you could you know use the
36:54
oil for
36:55
food or for light or for whatever it
36:56
might be yeah so the russians used to
36:58
have massive
36:58
sunflower fields while they still do the
37:00
two biggest producers of sunflower oil
37:02
are russia and ukraine
37:05
which means that tensions between those
37:06
two countries have affected
37:08
the world's supply of sunflower oil
37:10
really oh wow
37:11
really yeah god i i didn't know how i
37:13
felt about that
37:14
battle but now i'm really anti because
37:16
sunflower oil is a useful thing to have
37:18
around
37:18
yeah there's an amazing thing about the
37:20
fact that sunflowers
37:22
are used in nuclear uh
37:25
apocalyptic sites basically so fukushima
37:28
for example
37:29
right um part of the process of trying
37:32
to
37:32
clear of radiation was to plant millions
37:35
and millions of sunflowers
37:36
because they soak up the radiation and
37:38
this was a thing that was employed in
37:40
chernobyl as well oh yeah they they did
37:43
yeah
37:44
lots of planting it's many it's many
37:46
different flowers and
37:48
field mustard i must admit i read that
37:50
and i thought it
37:51
probably wasn't true because it's the
37:53
obvious thing to put in isn't it
37:54
sunflowers they
37:56
it's light it's energy it feels like a
37:59
kind of a folk remedy to that doesn't it
38:01
yeah but then it's 100
38:05
accumulators which take up heavy metals
38:07
from soil
38:08
do you know who's a big fan of
38:09
sunflowers huge fan uh it gives a clue
38:11
my wife
38:12
um really yeah that wasn't gonna well
38:15
it's someone
38:15
very similar to your wife actually oh um
38:18
[Music]
38:18
[Laughter]
38:22
um no it's osama bin laden oh i've
38:25
always thought she reminds me a bit
38:26
she's tall yeah
38:34
yeah he had a passion for them
38:35
apparently according to his wife he
38:37
loved growing he always grew them he
38:38
loved growing the biggest sunflowers in
38:40
his
38:40
village do you know what's ironic about
38:42
sunflowers uh
38:43
osama bin laden loved them
38:47
um is it that they um come out at night
38:51
oh that's good what what do they do they
38:54
hide no i'm guessing
38:55
oh right that would be ironic if there's
38:57
sunflowers that
38:59
they hate the sun uh they love they love
39:01
the sun they followed around all over
39:03
the place none of that no
39:04
it's that they're the only flower with
39:05
the word flower in their name
39:07
but they're not a flower
39:11
they're not a flower my head just got
39:13
blown
39:14
they are thousands of flowers so they
39:18
so each sunflower is actually thousands
39:20
of little flowers the definition of a
39:22
flower is obviously like you know a
39:23
bit the bit that has the reproductive
39:25
organs and on the sunflower
39:27
um the bits that are the called the disc
39:29
florets so if you follow the big yellow
39:31
petals down
39:32
you then get all these little circular
39:34
bits
39:35
yes exactly the bit more brown bits they
39:37
have male and female reproductive organs
39:39
each one of those
39:40
so each little petal with a display
39:42
attached is a flower wow so every time
39:44
we see a sunflower now we should call it
39:46
a sunflowers
39:47
exactly yeah i will do that from there i
39:49
know you actually will won't you
39:50
but you're eating your panino
39:54
what uh what technically then is it
39:57
it's a group of flowers flowers it's a
39:59
great that is going to be absolutely
40:00
that's going to save me a lot of money
40:02
i'm just going to be able to say darling
40:03
i've got you 2 000 sunflowers
40:08
hey i've got another ironic thing about
40:10
sunflowers
40:11
yeah this is about van gogh or van gogh
40:14
um so he never sold any of his sunflower
40:17
portraits i think he painted about 11.
40:20
and he never sold a single one in his
40:21
lifetime and yet now
40:23
the one that the national gallery in
40:25
london has one and they sell more
40:26
postcards of that than of any other
40:28
picture they've got
40:29
when you go to the national gallery they
40:31
say no taking photos but actually since
40:33
2014 they've lifted the ban on selfies
40:35
and taking photos
40:37
because they realized they just couldn't
40:38
regulate it so if they saw someone with
40:40
a phone out
40:41
most people they couldn't tell if they
40:43
were googling something texting
40:45
or whether or not they were about to use
40:46
it to take a sneaky photo
40:48
so they do know that certain flashes and
40:51
so on do
40:52
actually affect paintings right they've
40:54
only with a few specific paintings said
40:56
now
40:56
that is illegal to take a selfie with
40:58
but that's also ironic
40:59
that a place with hundreds of
41:01
self-portraits stops you from taking a
41:03
self-portrait
41:04
yeah yeah apart from they don't and they
41:06
don't the iron
41:07
sounds the irony used to exist and it
41:09
now does not yeah
41:12
that's that's another thing about the
41:13
sunflowers the um the painting is
41:15
wilting
41:15
all the van gogh sunflowers are
41:19
going brown very slowly as in because
41:21
the incas are
41:22
yeah because he used he used a paint
41:24
which degrades under light
41:25
although great news is not yet visible
41:27
to the human eye so
41:29
everybody stopped panicking wow so the
41:31
painting of sunflowers doesn't like
41:33
the light brilliant ah this isn't really
41:36
special
41:37
past and present irony special yeah
41:40
um so they but they've analyzed the
41:42
chemicals and they know which because
41:43
they use different pigments for
41:44
different bits of the painting and one
41:46
of the pigments
41:46
is going to steadily get brown yeah well
41:49
that's fitting isn't it because they all
41:50
die eventually as do we all and i think
41:52
that's the point he was trying to make
41:53
when he used that chemical
41:55
he was another man with great foresight
41:58
um do you know the optimal distance at
41:59
which to take a photo of your face
42:01
is it arm's length sadly it's not so
42:04
that's why everyone looks hideous in
42:05
selfies and they should all stop doing
42:06
them
42:07
um so five feet is the best distance for
42:10
a portrait that's the one that's the
42:11
length that doesn't distort your facial
42:12
features
42:13
well you know what that is about the
42:14
length of an arm's length and the selfie
42:16
stick
42:17
yeah it's about the length of a giant
42:19
armadillo yeah but selfie sticks are
42:21
more easily
42:22
gotten well i wouldn't hate someone
42:24
carrying around a giant armadillo quite
42:26
as much
42:27
i think all the taurus in covett garden
42:30
were walking around with giant alveolars
42:31
you would soon get sick of it
42:35
but no selfies make your face look 30 um
42:38
fatter 30 wider than it is don't they
42:40
because they're too close-ups
42:41
right so kim kardashian yeah she takes a
42:44
lot of selfies yeah mm-hmm
42:45
and she seems to look normal in them
42:48
does she have an extremely thin face in
42:50
here
42:50
yeah i don't know it's like a freak
42:54
actually weirdly uh vanilla was showing
42:56
me last night a picture of uh kim
42:58
kardashian when she was 14 versus now to
43:00
show the facial difference and
43:01
her no she looks like she's had a lot of
43:04
the
43:05
work done that would make herself look
43:06
like a snow person who needs to look
43:08
good i'm not surprised
43:09
oh yeah suggesting that kim kardashian
43:10
has had work done
43:12
i can't tell you how thrilled i am this
43:13
podcast has ended up with us discussing
43:15
kim kardashian's percent called plastic
43:17
surgery and so i got another kim
43:18
kardashian factor
43:21
and that is that she's been warned by
43:23
doctors to stop taking selfies after a
43:25
painful wrist injury
43:26
wow he genuinely had one
43:30
apparently it's she's got rsi because
43:32
she's taking so many selfies
43:33
really doesn't she have any mates who
43:35
will take a photo of her
43:37
it's a selfie you got to do a well you
43:38
can just call it a photograph we've got
43:39
a word for the other one as well
43:42
it's all about the angles she wrote she
43:44
released a book called selfie which was
43:45
literally
43:46
500 selfies that was the whole book i
43:49
loved it absolutely loved it
43:50
yeah i i've got a selfie fact here which
43:54
is that in ohio there was a
43:55
man who was wanted by the police and uh
43:58
his name was donald a chip
44:00
pew um he was wanted by the lima police
44:03
in ohio
44:04
and so they put a picture hang on
44:06
they're looking at the wrong place
44:08
there is a there's a county called lima
44:11
the animal the lima police adore the
44:14
most adorable police in the whole
44:16
country
44:19
yeah so they released a photo of him
44:22
uh which they said have you seen this
44:25
guy please get in contact and someone
44:27
who got in contact was donald himself
44:29
who did not like the photo that they
44:30
were using
44:31
so he sent them an updated selfie of him
44:34
sitting in a car with sunglasses
44:36
on looking like he's cool uh and they
44:39
ended up using that photo as well
44:41
sending a message saying this photo was
44:42
sent to us by
44:43
um mr pugh himself we thank him for
44:46
being helpful but now we'd appreciate it
44:48
if he would come to speak to us about
44:49
his charges but yeah they actually know
44:52
what happened at the end
44:52
no i haven't i haven't found an update
44:54
um oh we sure you didn't just send them
44:56

00:15
hello
00:16
and welcome to another episode of no
00:18
such thing as a fish
00:20
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
00:21
qi offices in covent garden
00:24
my name is dan schreiber and i'm sitting
00:26
here with anna jaczynski
00:27
james harkin and alex bell and once
00:30
again we have gathered around the
00:31
microphones with our four
00:33
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:35
and in no particular order
00:36
here we go starting with my fact this
00:40
week
00:40
my fact is that a message in a bottle
00:43
that was thrown off the titanic
00:44
as it was sinking was found one year
00:47
later washed up
00:48
on a shore in ireland only a few miles
00:51
from the home of the man who threw it
00:53
that's it's pretty extraordinary so this
00:55
could be that he just dropped it on his
00:57
way to the titanic
01:00
so this is a this was a 19 year old he
01:02
was called jeremiah burke he was from
01:04
glenmeyer county cork in ireland and
01:07
um the way that they were able to verify
01:10
the bottle because
01:12
there's been a lot of forgery bottles
01:14
that were claimed to be
01:15
so people trying to make money um this
01:17
bottle was
01:18
a bottle of holy water that his mother
01:20
had given to him as sort of sort of good
01:21
luck thing
01:22
and he used one of his own shoelaces to
01:24
tie it up as he threw the letter
01:26
and the bottle overboard um saying this
01:28
didn't work mom
01:30
maybe send me a better good luck charm
01:32
next time yeah so the um the message has
01:34
a date on it it's slightly unclear so
01:37
they it could be the 10th 12th 13th we
01:39
know that
01:40
it's sunk on the morning of the 15th but
01:42
so i don't know why he would have
01:43
yeah that doesn't make sense it's very
01:45
odd i think at the best of times i don't
01:48
necessarily know what data is straight
01:49
away i think as you're going down with
01:50
the titanic maybe you're going
01:52
what date is
01:57
but yeah so um this bottle washed up and
02:00
i've looked at it on google maps it is
02:01
literally just a couple of miles
02:03
separate where the area of where they
02:05
lived right to this shore and it was
02:06
found by a coachman
02:07
who um found it and i i didn't get to
02:10
the bottom of this bit of the story but
02:12
presumably
02:13
knew the area knew the people in the
02:14
area and thought ah this guy
02:16
you know he's he said burke of glad
02:18
mayor of cork i know this family
02:20
i know the uh the burke's i'm going to
02:22
see if this is him and so delivered it
02:24
to the mother
02:24
who a year later received this bottle
02:26
you could argue that it was a hoax
02:28
at the same time it's only been reported
02:30
in the last few years properly
02:32
again since it happened because they've
02:34
been lending it to a museum so they
02:36
didn't sell it
02:37
didn't go through auctions it's been a
02:38
family heirloom since yeah i suppose the
02:41
natural currents would take it there
02:42
anyway wouldn't it
02:44
i suppose so yeah kind of the obvious
02:45
place for it to end up so where did the
02:47
the titanic launch from liverpool was it
02:50
or
02:51
it went from southampton then i think it
02:52
went to france and then it went to
02:54
ireland and its last stop off was in
02:56
ireland
02:56
i think was it okay i didn't know that
02:58
all right um but yeah that is such a
03:00
weird coincidence but it's so weird how
03:02
many messages in bottles
03:03
or maybe it's not weird how many
03:05
messages in bottles do get tossed
03:06
overboard and found and there are so
03:08
many great
03:09
stories so another really good message
03:11
and bottle coincidence
03:12
that i liked is that in april 2012
03:16
uk fisherman called andrew lipper was
03:20
fishing near shetland
03:21
and he found a message in a bottle and
03:23
it was a note that had been dropped at
03:25
sea in 1890
03:26
and it was one of those that wanted to
03:28
investigate ocean currents so
03:29
oceanographers were always doing this to
03:31
investigate where the messages ended up
03:33
to see what the ocean currents were like
03:35
anyway andrew lieber found this message
03:37
in a bottle in 2012
03:38
and so it was and it was really nice
03:41
because that meant it was the 315th to
03:43
be put in that log started in 1890 so
03:46
315 of those messages
03:48
had been retrieved and it's still going
03:50
the log is still there they're still
03:51
keeping them
03:52
going some incredibly bored researchers
03:54
still sitting there yeah
03:55
desperately waiting every 40 years um
03:58
but what i liked about this guy
03:59
was that he then broke the record for
04:01
that's the longest
04:02
wait anyone's ever had to read a message
04:04
in a bottle and the previous record
04:06
holder had been his
04:06
mate mark anderson who'd broken it in
04:09
2006 in the same boat
04:12
so how weird is that so he's friends
04:14
with him and he did
04:15
like lipa didn't interview with the
04:16
papers when he then broke his friend's
04:18
record and he said
04:19
my friend anderson is very unhappy that
04:21
i've topped his record as anderson never
04:23
stopped bloody talking about it
04:32
in 1954 i was just so i was just looking
04:34
up other bottles have been chucked in
04:36
actually chucked in rather than found
04:37
um guinness decided to do an advertising
04:40
promotion
04:41
and they threw 50 000 bottles into the
04:44
ocean with messages into guinness
04:46
bottles
04:47
which i find unbelievable so it's known
04:49
as being guinness longest advertising
04:50
campaign yet because they're still
04:51
turning up but
04:52
i can't that would never be allowed
04:53
today dumping 50 thousand bottles
04:56
in this it's illegal in a lot of places
04:58
yeah well it definitely is
04:59
so you'll get fined in canada for five
05:02
thousand dollars
05:03
if you throw a bottle into the water and
05:05
we found this out because there was a
05:06
story this year of a guy called harold
05:08
hackett from prince edward island
05:10
and he's thrown an estimated 10 000
05:13
messages into the ocean
05:15
um since he started and he said he has
05:17
to retire because he doesn't want to get
05:19
um arrested well not arrested but fined
05:22
good yeah
05:23
good to know if that's all his life
05:25
meant to him throwing messages in
05:26
bottles into the ocean
05:28
i have limited sympathy with someone
05:29
like it was my life dream to pollute the
05:31
ocean
05:32
i can't believe that the government
05:35
in the 16th century it was also illegal
05:37
to open a bottle if you found it
05:39
yeah i never found evidence of this no i
05:41
think i think that's yeah
05:42
is this the whole queen victoria having
05:44
a green
05:46
sorry queen elizabeth having an uncorker
05:48
of messages
05:49
i think she did have that because it's
05:50
mentioned in a victor hugo novel
05:52
i think that was the first mention and
05:54
that was like two a hundred years later
05:56
no i did she can't have hadn't but it's
05:58
not that's not at least a modern
05:59
invention is it no i think i think fake
06:02
news still exists even if victor hugo is
06:04
penning it
06:05
in his novel
06:08
i don't know how many victor hugo novels
06:10
you've read but there is a lot of
06:11
extremely boring
06:12
technical true stuff oh really yeah
06:14
right literally you'll get like three
06:16
chapters on the sewage systems of paris
06:18
as well
06:18
okay james's resentment comes out about
06:20
the fact that he's been reading the same
06:21
victory
06:24
which is genuinely true right how's it
06:26
going if anyone here remembers
06:28
was talking about victor hugo it was
06:30
probably about six months ago yeah that
06:31
was on our 2018 tour
06:33
at like yeah and i'm still reading
06:35
lesser outlet
06:37
um the latest sort of modern instance
06:40
that i read of this on corker
06:42
comes down to a 1978 book called the 12
06:45
million dollar note by robert krask
06:47
in it there's true stories and then
06:49
there are also hoax stories and the
06:51
thought is is that this was in the book
06:53
as a hoax story but
06:54
it got mixed up in all the reviews and
06:55
so on when people were talking about
06:57
this is a true story and then this is a
06:58
hoax and
06:59
that's why it's spread so the idea just
07:01
to explain
07:02
that she had an official uncorker of
07:04
bottles because queen elizabeth the
07:06
first didn't want anyone else
07:07
uncaulking bottles that contained secret
07:09
information so a bottle was found wasn't
07:11
it
07:12
that was thrown from a navy ship uh
07:14
supposedly that had
07:15
military details that were um very uh
07:18
if anyone was throwing bottles over they
07:20
would often be people who were
07:22
in the navy or doing official work for
07:24
the government right
07:26
checking out currents and stuff like
07:27
that so they didn't want just anyone to
07:29
be able to read them
07:30
and i i don't know i know what you mean
07:32
and i think you're right to be skeptical
07:34
and it's probably not true but i don't
07:36
think it's necessarily true that we're
07:37
saying that one person had this as his
07:39
only job
07:40
or anything it could be someone who was
07:42
part of the royal household who had also
07:44
had this job bob
07:45
of the stool on the side he's official
07:48
uncooker
07:48
uncooked with various royal things um
07:52
yeah so this idea of doing scientific
07:54
experiments um for the sake of finding
07:56
out ocean currents and stuff by dropping
07:58
messages and bottles in actually
07:59
serves a purpose which seems so weird to
08:02
me
08:02
so there was this guy george parker
08:04
bidder who threw a thousand bottles into
08:06
the north sea
08:07
in 1906 and he promised a shilling
08:10
reward for anyone who found the bottle
08:12
and then sent it back to him saying
08:13
exactly where they'd found it
08:14
and in fact one woman found the last one
08:16
in 2015 and she posted it back to the
08:18
address
08:19
and the company in plymouth that was
08:21
still monitoring it
08:22
had to then track down a shilling an old
08:24
shilling looking on ebay and old
08:26
antique coin collectors to center that's
08:29
so funny
08:30
actually the first ever message in a
08:32
bottle possibly might have been
08:34
for that reason which was supposedly
08:36
greek philosopher theo frastus
08:38
who wanted to prove that the
08:39
mediterranean was fed by the atlantic
08:41
and so he put bottles in the atlantic
08:44
and saw them go around the corner
08:45
into the med and he could prove that
08:47
again this is a slightly
08:49
not sure if this is true or not and did
08:50
he leave a message saying whoever finds
08:52
us can you tell me the location pretty
08:53
much
08:54
yeah that's the idea that's cool and he
08:56
saw them go around the corner
08:58
i think again this is possibly not true
09:00
but he would have put them in the water
09:02
and then there would have been like dan
09:03
says a message
09:04
saying contact um theophrastus on
09:08
you know what happens
09:13
there was a thing on like the us um
09:15
government nautical side which said that
09:17
a lot of the nautical maps we have now
09:19
are based on those messages so in the
09:21
1950s
09:22
i think loads of messages and bottles
09:24
were put in the gulf of maine
09:26
and all the maps we have of like all the
09:28
different ocean currents there
09:29
basically based on where everyone picked
09:31
all those messages up and where
09:33
and you know then they sent back saying
09:34
hey i'm here i've just found this and
09:36
that's where a lot of ocean maps come
09:37
from and now we've got like satellite
09:39
technology and stuff also
09:40
i think quite recently i'm sure we must
09:42
have mentioned this but there was all
09:44
those rubber ducks that fell
09:45
off a tanker didn't they and they
09:47
floated around everywhere we got loads
09:49
of data from that
09:50
yeah really that's still happening i
09:52
think they still wash up every now and
09:53
then yeah they do yeah
09:55
i was so i read an article there was a
09:57
great mental floss
09:58
article all about messages and bottles
10:00
and then the the article veers away
10:02
because this isn't technically a message
10:04
in a bottle but it's a pretty
10:05
extraordinary story so
10:06
i'm just going to read it anyway this
10:08
happened in 2001
10:10
there was a girl called laura buxton and
10:12
she was coming up to 10 years old
10:14
she released a red balloon into the air
10:16
she lived in stoke on trent
10:18
in england and on the balloon she wrote
10:21
please return to laura buxton
10:23
and on the other side of the balloon she
10:24
put her home a dress so they released it
10:26
into the air
10:26
it disappeared a few weeks later 140
10:29
miles away
10:30
um the balloon hit a hedge when it came
10:33
down
10:34
and uh the net the person who picked it
10:36
up
10:37
saw the name and saw the address and
10:39
immediately went what the hell was going
10:41
on and went to his neighbor because his
10:43
neighbor
10:43
had a daughter who was 10 years old who
10:45
also had the name laura buxton
10:47
so it landed exactly with the same age
10:50
same name
10:50
the person they got in contact and they
10:52
were saying what amazing coincidence
10:54
let's meet up
10:55
so on the day of the meeting the two
10:57
girls independently without having
10:58
decided what they were going to do
11:00
both came in the same outfit they both
11:01
had a pink sweater and were wearing
11:03
jeans
11:03
jeans oh my goodness
11:07
this is just collecting all the
11:08
coincidence that happened at the moment
11:10
they were both roughly the same height
11:12
which was two girls the same age were
11:14
roughly the same height so they were
11:15
tall
11:16
tall ten-year-olds so they were very
11:17
surprised like oh you're a tall
11:18
ten-year-old tiny little coincidence yes
11:20
i like pizza i like pizza they both had
11:22
brown hair they were in the same style
11:25
they both had three-year-old
11:26
black labrador retrievers they both had
11:29
a grey pet rabbit
11:31
not on them they left them they both
11:34
brought
11:34
they did bring their own guinea pigs
11:37
which were the same color
11:38
and had the same orange markings on
11:41
their headquarters this is
11:42
this is mental floss so i know it sounds
11:44
like i'm reading an april fool's thing
11:45
but this is but also like
11:47
if that was in the local news story yeah
11:49
i'm a journalist in a local news story
11:50
in stoke on trent
11:51
i would go and go come on give me some
11:53
more what have you got do they have a
11:54
dog yeah yeah okay
11:56
what's this on local as well yeah
11:57
exactly what color hair does she have
11:58
brilliant
11:59
nice one yeah can i just say this is i
12:01
don't know why these two are being like
12:02
this they must have woken up on the
12:03
wrong side of their bed because that
12:04
does happen sometimes
12:05
sure i mean mental things i suppose you
12:07
could say the law of large numbers means
12:09
that there's enough
12:10
things that happen in the world which
12:12
aren't coincidental that some
12:13
coincidental things do happen sometimes
12:15
yeah yeah thousands of laura boxers pick
12:17
up fan balloons every day
12:18
yeah i cannot be wearing the same
12:19
clothes
12:21
we should still get excited by
12:23
coincidences i know it's like oh this
12:24
could happen
12:25
it's still amazing yeah i think maybe we
12:27
did get out of bed on the wrong side but
12:29
on the other hand
12:30
did you not when you're a kid release
12:32
loads of balloons with notes on them
12:34
and never get a single reply
12:36
from anyone yeah is that that's what
12:38
you're
12:38
getting now it was a very common thing
12:41
for people to do
12:42
when i was a kid we don't do it now
12:43
anymore because it's like bad for the
12:44
environment but they used to be really
12:46
in vogue to do that you didn't know
12:47
everyone you'd write a note on your
12:48
thing we would use to go to tiggies for
12:50
our birthday every year which is an
12:52
italian restaurant in bolton and then we
12:53
get a free balloon
12:55
and then we'd write a note on it yeah
12:56
yeah same every birthday party
12:58
some bastard in bolton was shooting them
13:00
down
13:01
[Laughter]
13:04
with thousands of labels and dead
13:05
balloons with james hawkins
13:07
um there was there was one person one
13:09
girl who did it and it landed in the
13:11
background of buckingham palace and the
13:12
queen sent it back
13:13
did you remember that she was called um
13:16
elizabeth
13:18
and she's a 90 year old girl friend
13:20
bookstore and then we both turned up
13:21
wearing crowns
13:24
and you've got a beefy too
13:34
okay it is time for fact number two and
13:36
that
13:37
is alex my fact this week is that the
13:40
original
13:41
mastermind chair was specially modified
13:44
to have detachable arms
13:45
quote in case a contender is too large
13:48
to fit between them unquote
13:51
okay so we're going to explain what
13:52
mastermind is for non-british people yes
13:54
so it's a long-running quiz show
13:58
it's been running since 1972. it's a
14:00
very like paired back quiz show um so
14:02
it's a dark studio you have a person
14:04
asking questions and you have four
14:06
contestants and they each come up to a
14:07
chair one at a time and the chair is the
14:09
kind of the
14:10
the famous symbol of the show um and
14:12
each contestant
14:14
to ask the special subject so you
14:15
prepare a specialist object so if you
14:17
know for example
14:18
uh titanic facts and everything about it
14:20
you would get quizzed in a very quick
14:22
space of time everything about the
14:23
titanic and the more point you get you
14:25
win it's
14:25
like an expert quiz yeah exactly and it
14:28
was based on
14:29
um a guy who was in the war in second
14:31
world war he was an raf gunner and he
14:33
was
14:34
captured in germany and questioned by
14:37
the germans and it's kind of supposed to
14:39
be almost the same way that he felt at
14:42
the time which is you've got big light
14:43
on you they're asking you questions
14:44
again and again and again
14:46
to kind of put you under as much
14:47
pressure as possible yeah yeah his name
14:49
was bill wright
14:50
and yeah exactly that he was a prisoner
14:52
of war and he thought oh this will make
14:54
a great game show when he was being
14:56
when he was being interrogated by the
14:59
nazis and um
15:00
interestingly he says that in germany um
15:02
so you you were asked three questions
15:03
which is name
15:04
rank and number um and that's still the
15:07
thing that
15:08
in mastermind it's name occupation and
15:10
specialist subject he took the rule of
15:11
three that they he and he directly
15:13
associates it with that
15:14
and when they started it magnus magnuson
15:17
who is the original
15:18
host of the show and his name is um he's
15:20
icelandic so that's an icelandic name
15:22
magnus magnuson do you know what his
15:24
dad's name was
15:24
no i don't what his fa was dad's first
15:26
name was yeah it was not magnus
15:28
no so because he changed it yeah in
15:30
iceland it's supposed to be
15:32
your surname is son of your father so my
15:34
dad's called michael so i should be
15:36
james michaelson
15:37
right but his father was called anna
15:40
siegerstein wasn't he stein so he should
15:43
have been sega steinson
15:44
yeah um but actually his father was
15:46
called segastein magnuson and in
15:48
scotland of course you have the same
15:50
surname as your father so he had to keep
15:52
the same
15:52
okay wow that's very interesting um so
15:56
yeah so magnus um in usually you'd be a
15:59
quiz host or
16:00
you know you'd have uh a title like that
16:03
his title when he was doing the show was
16:04
the interrogator
16:06
so that's what he was introduced so it
16:07
was completely tied into his experience
16:09
and he was actually a nazi as well
16:10
wasn't he magnus magnuson he was yeah
16:12
was he
16:13
no oh geez no he was in the national
16:16
treasure i thought i missed that
16:17
paragraph and i was reading into this
16:18
do you know what's weird though is that
16:20
another little lincoln that i know from
16:22
our friend who was on mastermind so ian
16:24
dunn
16:25
who's a big fan of qi and who we know he
16:28
went on mastermind and he said when you
16:29
fill in the forms
16:31
when you're saying what your specialist
16:32
subject should be it's called the
16:33
mastermind ss form
16:35
they have at the top that's very funny
16:38
um i read on wikipedia a they have a
16:40
list of a few subjects that have
16:42
actually been rejected
16:43
a few of the ones that have been
16:44
rejected include routes to anywhere in
16:47
mainland britain by road from lechworth
16:50
the banana industry not allowed to pick
16:53
the banana industry
16:54
as you're not allowed to pick it nice
16:56
[Laughter]
16:57
orthopedic bone cement in total hip
16:59
replacement is another
17:01
ed the last word of the wiki is perfect
17:03
squares up to
17:04
99 squared yeah what is the perfect
17:07
square dan
17:08
um it's 9801
17:14
but um that's one point
17:17
uh in recent years i read in an article
17:19
that subjects like faulty towers
17:21
blackadder
17:22
roald dahl harry potter um so they've
17:25
been
17:25
they've been ruled out because so many
17:27
people have picked it that they've run
17:29
out of questions
17:29
basically they don't know what else to
17:31
ask about black adder that's not been
17:32
done before the thing with harry potter
17:34
is that last year 262 people
17:37
wanted to do it as a specialist subject
17:39
wow on mastermind
17:41
that's according to producer mark
17:42
hellsby the first three winners were
17:45
women
17:45
which was quite bizarre because far
17:48
fewer women than
17:49
men have ended up winning the titles um
17:52
not because women are less clever
17:53
because of centuries and centuries of
17:55
semi-compression blah blah blah um but
17:58
i'm
18:02
[Laughter]
18:06
look i believe that it's just a long
18:07
explanation to go into but yeah the
18:09
first three people who won
18:11
were women and then in 35 years it's
18:13
been eight women and 21 men who've won
18:15
it but after the first three years
18:16
everyone was speculating is a man ever
18:18
going to win mastermind
18:20
um can we talk about the chair very
18:21
quickly yes uh the chair
18:23
uh was voted in a survey for house
18:26
beautiful magazine as
18:28
the second greatest chair basically uh
18:30
of pop culture
18:31
um can we guess the first yeah have a go
18:34
yeah
18:35
okay just one extra bit of context the
18:37
set this is it was voted as the second
18:38
most iconic chair of the 20th century
18:40
going to say the wool sack in the house
18:42
of
18:43
lords or whatever it is is it a sofa
18:44
from friends no it's not okay so
18:47
it's in pop culture right is it chair
18:50
the singer
18:51
no it's in okay so i'm gonna i'm gonna
18:53
say it's the 1960s
18:55
um it is a chair that made the
18:57
newspapers
18:58
because it was a scandalous nixon it was
19:01
it was a scandalous chair
19:02
basically scandalous chat elvis elvis
19:05
did he have a chair
19:06
didn't he so have you just had a toilet
19:08
he died on the toilet yeah they often
19:10
call it the throne
19:11
yeah that's true well no uh is it the
19:13
chair that liza minelli sat on in that
19:15
film
19:16
is that 96 no it's not but it's
19:18
interesting have a have a think in your
19:19
head about what she does with that chair
19:22
and you might get to it somehow it's
19:24
chicago you're thinking
19:25
she sits backwards does someone sit
19:27
backwards on it in an iconic way
19:30
basically no that's it that's it yeah we
19:32
go profumo
19:33
perfumer yes one of the most yeah so
19:36
that got voted the uh christine keeler
19:39
sitting
19:39
backwards on a chair as the most like
19:42
very much that was more about keeler
19:44
than the chair
19:44
except in the in its time um most
19:47
comedians
19:48
would parody that shot and still do of
19:50
being naked on a chair
19:52
that way round in reference to that so
19:53
that i think for that reason that chair
19:55
is
19:55
the concept of the chair yeah yeah
19:57
exactly i think i'm yeah i can picture
19:59
the picture you're talking about which i
20:00
think means it counts
20:02
we'll allow it so the last chair on
20:04
mastermind was given to magnus magnuson
20:06
when he retired
20:07
and they've got a new one now which like
20:09
alex says has these detachable arms
20:11
it is an eames soft pad it was designed
20:14
in 1969
20:16
and it was designed by charles and ray
20:18
eames who are basically the best
20:20
chair designers in the history of the
20:22
world they're very trumpish of you
20:25
i have these chairs they make great
20:26
chairs they are the famous they're the
20:28
big names in chairs
20:29
they were a husband and wife couple and
20:31
they made loads of mass-produced chairs
20:34
and the first thing they ever mass
20:35
produced was a molded plywood leg splint
20:38
for world war ii and which they gave to
20:40
all the soldiers and it was molded on
20:42
charles's own leg
20:44
and they sold 150 000 of them so there
20:47
were soldiers
20:48
all around the world walking on an exact
20:50
replica of his own leg
20:52
wow that's amazing that's incredible my
20:54
favorite tv chair
20:56
yeah is the chair that was in the
20:59
audition
21:00
room when robin williams went to
21:01
audition for the role of mork
21:03
um mork from orc on happy days so i
21:06
think and then that span off into
21:08
michael mindy didn't it yeah but uh the
21:09
producer was a guy called gary marshall
21:11
and robin williams came into the room
21:12
and he was unknown at the time
21:14
walked in and gary marshall's told him
21:15
to take a seat and immediately robin
21:17
williams went to the chair and stood on
21:19
his head on it
21:20
and marshall immediately hired him
21:21
saying he was the only alien who applied
21:22
for the job so
21:24
wow cool those stories are quite
21:27
dangerous because it encourages
21:28
literally everyone to go into an
21:29
audition and really break the mold and
21:31
can you imagine saying that for hours
21:32
after every single person comes in and
21:33
does
21:34
something really annoying with the chair
21:35
you're the only one who sat on the chair
21:38
that was the test do you want to tell
21:40
you we're not looking for actual aliens
21:41
we need an
21:42
actor
21:47
[Laughter]
21:54
[Music]
21:56
okay it is time for fact number three
21:58
and that is chelsinski
22:00
my fact this week is that one
22:01
competition at the highland games
22:03
used to be pulling the legs off a cow in
22:05
order to win a sheep
22:07
they're really hard in scotland aren't
22:09
they because when i was at school used
22:10
to pull
22:10
legs off a daddy long legs but in
22:12
scotland they pull legs off a girl
22:15
it sounds like a metaphor for like
22:17
ruining something because a cow is more
22:19
valuable than a sheep so why don't you
22:20
just keep the cow and leave the legs on
22:22
so the cow is dead at this point i
22:24
should say so it's not as
22:26
awful um still quite often yeah it's
22:28
pretty pretty horrible
22:29
not ideal it's a strength test and it
22:31
would be impressive if someone could
22:32
twist their legs off a cow with his own
22:34
bare hands so emotional strength tests
22:36
as well to witness what you've just done
22:37
to this poor question if you ever see
22:38
anna in the countryside
22:40
and you want to impress her
22:44
tug the legs off the nearest quadruped
22:48
this was actually invented in 1820 and
22:51
i don't think it was that long lasting
22:52
but the idea of the contest was invented
22:54
by a guy called aleister mcdonald who
22:56
was a clan chief
22:57
and apparently he was just this really
22:58
cool um eccentric
23:01
vibrant clan chieftain character in fact
23:04
he was who
23:04
the character of fergus mackyver in the
23:06
waverly walter scott's waverly novel was
23:08
based on
23:09
and yeah he said let's do this that'll
23:11
be fun and the first prize is a fat
23:12
sheep
23:13
okay and the reason it didn't last
23:15
probably is because it was extremely
23:17
difficult
23:18
yes um i read one um i don't i think it
23:21
might have happened maybe once or twice
23:23
in one or two different ones but the one
23:24
that i read was in in the gary
23:26
and there was only one man who succeeded
23:28
after struggling for about an hour
23:31
um as a reward he received his sheep and
23:33
the eulogistic speech from the chief
23:36
nice um the has anyone been to the
23:38
highland games
23:39
no i know i have you yeah it's really
23:42
awesome it's really good it's like
23:43
it's almost like a fate the one that i
23:45
went to it's like a village fate
23:47
um but then you've also got these
23:48
incredible things happening with people
23:50
throwing these
23:51
massive weights like really really high
23:54
like really high is this the big logs
23:56
the big i didn't i saw that
23:58
the paper tossing in the cabinets the
23:59
main one i saw they were like they had
24:01
these kind of
24:02
you know like kettle bells that you
24:03
would usually see a gym and we're
24:04
throwing this
24:05
over a big big big high height
24:08
wow i was really impressed is it kind of
24:10
like um high jump is there a is there a
24:12
bar
24:13
yeah so you get higher and higher and
24:14
higher time and the cabotas is not about
24:17
how far you can toss it it's about you
24:19
have to toss it so that it lands
24:21
at 12 o'clock so it lands upright so
24:23
it's got to stay up in the air for like
24:24
an hour and a half
24:27
depending on what time you throw it
24:29
don't throw it at 9am it's not
24:32
yeah as in it lands uh like facing away
24:35
from you as it were so you need to do a
24:37
full rotation 180 and then land exactly
24:39
facing away from you exactly
24:41
perpendicular to the earth yes ah so
24:44
it would be extremely hard to pull the
24:46
leg off a cow right
24:48
i think they twisted people tend to say
24:49
twist questions is that is that how you
24:51
pull a
24:51
if is that i think that is how you would
24:53
do it yeah i think so let's say you want
24:55
to pull a
24:56
chicken leg off a chicken yeah you tend
24:58
to give it a twist while you're pulling
25:00
don't you i can see what you're saying
25:01
actually
25:02
i can picture that now do you know the
25:03
ideal shape for a cow
25:05
uh right in the 19th century it's got
25:06
four legs for us dancers
25:08
is it kind of square because if i
25:10
because i can't really picture cows
25:12
because i can't picture anything but if
25:13
i ever had to draw one i'd draw it
25:14
particularly square for an animal yeah
25:16
right
25:17
and that's if you picture drawings in
25:18
the 19th century
25:20
then cows would be vast and very square
25:23
and there was a lot of competition
25:24
between
25:25
members of nobility and landowners about
25:27
getting the right shape for your animals
25:29
so yeah if you look at cows they don't
25:30
look like real cows and the
25:32
actual the size of a cow between 1710
25:34
and 1795 increased by
25:36
a third so people were really building
25:37
up their count so what were the dates
25:39
between 1710 and 1795 so that was when
25:42
they started getting
25:43
only a couple of generations yeah
25:44
absolutely but um cows were supposed to
25:47
be
25:47
um rectangular exactly rectangular sheep
25:50
were supposed to tend towards being
25:52
oblong
25:52
and pigs the ideal shape for a pig was a
25:54
football shape
25:56
well what kind of football as in in
25:58
those days was
25:59
regulation standard black and white
26:01
hexagon
26:02
i think round so if you if you get
26:04
pictures of pigs very often they'll be
26:05
the picture with their stomachs
26:06
literally on the floor
26:07
oh like a pot belly pig because
26:09
eventually they had to turn them into
26:10
footballs didn't they
26:11
yeah exactly pigs bladders footballs
26:13
yeah so why were the cows
26:14
square was it because usually when you
26:16
make things square so you can stack them
26:17
but i don't think they did that
26:21
no this was just getting them bigger and
26:23
that was the shapes they tended towards
26:25
i read uh just going back to the history
26:28
of the scotland highland games um i read
26:31
that the very first one so they don't
26:33
they don't know
26:34
exactly where the first one occurred but
26:35
it is believed
26:37
that one of the first early venues was
26:40
at
26:40
feta reso and um technically
26:44
it's a few miles south of the scottish
26:46
highlands so the first one making the
26:48
lowlands
26:48
it's in the lowlands so it's actually
26:50
the lowland
26:51
games that's a really good fight if it's
26:53
true if it's true yeah
26:54
unfortunately as the article says um if
26:57
it did happen there it predates recorded
27:00
history we'll never know
27:01
uh because really the first one which is
27:04
kind of a modern style was in braemar
27:06
in the um early 1800s and it came at a
27:09
time when
27:10
the scottish were kind of finding
27:12
themselves and that's when all that kind
27:13
of tartan
27:15
it did exist but it was when it was
27:16
properly became
27:18
yeah it's quite an informal type thing
27:21
there aren't the highland games or there
27:22
weren't the highland games right now
27:24
that's about the same
27:24
time it's yeah it's more just like a
27:26
festival type thing isn't it yeah yeah
27:28
various times over the summer every
27:30
place will have one and it's weird it's
27:31
not just these like any time i've
27:32
thought of it i've thought of throwing
27:33
these giant logs and as you say the
27:35
kettlebell style weights but they do
27:37
stuff like um
27:38
biggest bowl of porridge you know as a
27:40
competition
27:41
and there was one that was made in 2010
27:44
that set
27:45
the record which is um it was six
27:47
hundred and ninety liters of porridge so
27:49
it feeds two thousand people it was
27:51
judged by goldilocks who said this
27:53
porridge is too small
27:54
[Laughter]
27:56
so yeah it's all tourists as well isn't
27:58
it now no scottish people
28:00
have ever been to the highway well you
28:02
know who used to go to it
28:03
uh billy connolly all the time and as a
28:05
result he used to bring his best mates
28:07
along who happened to be famous
28:08
comedians as well
28:09
one of which who went was robin williams
28:12
just to bring old alien chairman back
28:14
into the conversation
28:22
[Music]
28:23
okay it is time for our final fact of
28:26
the show and that
28:27
is james my fact this week is that you
28:30
can cure your arachnophobia
28:32
by drawing pictures of smiling spiders
28:35
so good i'm actually going to try this
28:38
yeah yeah me too do you need to draw
28:40
like a like a
28:42
a nude a life model kind of thing you
28:43
need the spider there
28:45
well they are always usually nude
28:47
spiders
28:48
because they can't get trousers with
28:49
eight legs so if you drew like a sexy
28:51
photo of a spider would that make it
28:53
less scary like a profumo sitting on a
28:54
chair legs
28:58
so this is um a clinical hypnotherapist
29:01
called adam cox
29:02
he is british or he practices in britain
29:05
and he encourages his clients to draw
29:07
brightly coloured smiling spiders with
29:10
big eyes
29:10
and he says that it reduces their
29:12
feelings of anxiety towards the
29:14
arachnids
29:14
but so does it cure you in a you're
29:17
presumably it's not like okay i'm gonna
29:19
be
29:20
um encountering a spider in the next
29:22
five minutes i'm gonna quickly draw a
29:24
picture of a smiling one too no it's a
29:26
long-term therapy
29:27
right people are going week after week
29:28
and drawing more and more spiders and
29:30
eventually it makes them feel less
29:32
anxious
29:32
yeah maybe sounds like the early stages
29:34
of a very severe phobia treatment so as
29:36
in you can't even
29:37
because you know there are some phobias
29:38
where you can't even say the word of the
29:39
thing you're scared of
29:40
yeah and the idea of drawing a spider is
29:41
probably really scary and horrible and
29:43
thinking about the details of it is
29:44
probably
29:45
well i am an arachnophobe um a little
29:47
bit not as much as i used to be as a kid
29:48
but
29:49
i would always find it really hard to
29:50
see a picture of them on
29:52
in a book and even now on the internet i
29:54
find it quite hard i have to scroll past
29:56
it me too
29:57
really yeah just get it out of shot and
29:59
just read the text it's pretty hard to
30:01
research this
30:04
but so what's interesting as well as
30:05
there was a study that was done in
30:07
um queensland in australia and uh along
30:10
with a uk
30:11
university in sussex and they were
30:13
saying that if you have
30:14
a fear of spiders if you have
30:16
arachnophobia you are more likely to
30:18
see a spider as in you're hardwired as i
30:21
say to notice the threats so if you were
30:23
out in queensland and you were walking
30:25
through the bush
30:26
if i'm walking with you and i'm less
30:28
scared i might not see a spider that's
30:30
obviously there but you are on
30:31
edge yeah waiting to see one yeah
30:34
actually it just that's
30:35
that's almost logical i do have a
30:36
problem with
30:38
movement in general so if i see any
30:39
movement out the corner of my eye it
30:41
really freaks me out
30:42
and the reason they their movement is
30:44
particularly weird
30:45
because i think we mentioned recently
30:47
actually how they move by hydraulic
30:48
pressure i didn't realize it was all
30:50
spiders
30:50
moving that way so when they um stretch
30:53
their legs out they're not doing it with
30:54
their muscles at all
30:55
they're pumping blood out through their
30:57
legs which is why they move in that
30:58
weird jerky way
30:59
and that's why when they die they always
31:01
shrivel up because
31:02
the pressure disappears so they shrivel
31:05
up so basically when they run they have
31:07
to have an erection in every one of
31:08
their legs
31:09
that's exactly it yeah it's very quickly
31:11
getting harder than
31:12
not getting hard over and over and over
31:13
again yeah their genitals are hydraulic
31:16
as well by the way yeah they operate
31:18
with some hydraulic pressure
31:20
and also they obviously have this really
31:21
cool thing spider penises where they can
31:23
keep on having sex without the spider
31:25
so there are quite a few spiders like
31:27
the orb spider
31:28
which will start having sex with a lady
31:31
spider and then detaches its penis to
31:33
get away
31:33
because i watched it i have to take a
31:35
call i'm so sorry i'll be back in a
31:36
minute you have this
31:38
exactly and it's actually more effective
31:41
without
31:41
its spider attachment as soon as a
31:43
spider leaves the penises tend to
31:45
eject about 70 of their sperm after that
31:48
so they keep pumping sperm out
31:50
even when the spider's gone wow wow yeah
31:53
i was i was looking into general phobias
31:57
because obviously there are so many
31:58
phobias out there and i found this
32:00
long list just to see which ones are
32:02
actual phobias because there must be a
32:04
phobia for everything but there's
32:05
a limitation obviously on ones that have
32:07
been given names yeah so
32:09
the ones that i found that i thought
32:10
were quite interesting that
32:12
have actual names assigned to them um
32:14
there's a phobia for the
32:16
fear of opinions that's very interesting
32:19
that you'd be just fearful really sure
32:20
what i think about that
32:22
there is the fear of flutes when you say
32:24
there is
32:26
as in a guy on the internet decided to
32:28
attribute names to
32:29
no so this is this is a big list that a
32:31
guy writes
32:34
yeah not wikipedia is called something
32:36
like uh uh
32:37
phobia weirdphobias.com i think that's a
32:40
really difficult thing isn't it because
32:41
there's
32:42
a list of millions of them there's like
32:44
a someone wrote one about a fear of a
32:45
duck
32:46
secretly looking at you or something
32:47
like that yes which is obviously not
32:49
true
32:49
then on the other hand there are such
32:51
weird ones that are true it's really
32:53
hard to tell which ones are not so
32:55
like fern phobia is definitely a thing
32:57
is it being scared of ferns i think
32:59
quite a few
32:59
famous people have got that cotton which
33:02
is very difficult for her yeah
33:03
she's scared of cotton as well yeah and
33:05
fear of like holes and stuff like that
33:07
is really common yes of that one
33:09
yeah uh fear of chins do you reckon
33:11
that's a real one
33:13
it's hard to imagine why but that's what
33:15
i mean it's hard to say what it is on
33:16
whether it isn't
33:17
yeah you know a guy had his
33:18
arachnophobia accidentally removed quite
33:20
recently
33:21
so you you can get rid of accidentally
33:24
but it does
33:24
involve really invasive surgery this was
33:27
a guy who'd always been terrified of
33:29
spiders and then also he
33:30
got an illness where he started having
33:32
seizures and so he went in for an
33:34
operation to get rid of his seizures and
33:35
they had to remove a bit of his amygdala
33:37
and the surgery went really well but he
33:40
woke up
33:40
and he found just two slight changes to
33:42
his character he had this stomach
33:44
lurching aversion to a very specific
33:46
kind of music
33:47
so when he heard it it was a music on a
33:48
particular advert he was terrified
33:50
just hated it and he was no longer
33:52
remotely afraid of spiders
33:54
that's really useful i have a fear of
33:57
invasive brain surgery though so it's a
34:00
bit worse than my fear of spiders
34:03
there's an organization a charity
34:05
organization in the uk called triumph
34:07
over phobia
34:08
top uk one of the managers is called
34:10
trilby breckman
34:12
and trilby breckman runs self-help
34:15
groups
34:17
he sounds like a really cool guy and he
34:19
said we once had a guy
34:20
who came to us for six weeks and never
34:22
said a word he just sat there
34:24
then eventually he managed to say i've
34:27
got a social phobia
34:28
and then ran out of the room
34:33
so good but i mean we shouldn't be
34:35
laughing what if he's listening and this
34:37
is just
34:37
attention recommended group therapy to a
34:40
guy he was in fear of social environment
34:42
it's okay to laugh because
34:43
he came back the following week and
34:45
within a year he was running groups with
34:46
by himself as well so
34:48
now he's got a fear of being alone he's
34:50
in the group all the time
34:52
um i was looking up uh what because i
34:55
was like what are spiders scared of
34:56
because you know everyone's playing
34:58
spiders most spiders
35:00
are terrified of ants because ants
35:01
contain formic acid which is really
35:03
about spiders
35:04
and and a lot of them will run for their
35:07
lives
35:07
if they see an ant as it were that's
35:09
like a quote though like uh researchers
35:11
say they sort of run away
35:12
um but the uni in the university of
35:14
canterbury found that um
35:16
they even run away from some spiders
35:18
will even run away from another species
35:20
of
35:20
spider called a jumping spider um with
35:22
the gregarious jumping spider
35:24
which pretends to be an ant that's its
35:25
defense mechanism so and it scares away
35:28
other spiders
35:28
so it hides its legs i think we said
35:30
that they hide that two of their legs
35:31
don't they so some species spiders do
35:33
that pretend to be out and that scares
35:34
other
35:35
species so someone who's scared of
35:37
spiders myself a little bit
35:39
if i was to dress as a massive ant do
35:42
you think they'd all kind of just leave
35:43
me alone
35:44
possibly so the um the spiders in the uh
35:47
in the tv series i'm a celebrity get me
35:49
out of here must be feeling good this
35:50
year because
35:51
they're going to be missing a big ant on
35:53
set this year
35:56
um why do you think you should never
35:58
pick up a tarantula
35:59
um because i hate them
36:04
because i might myself and if i
36:06
myself no one's gonna
36:07
hang out with me you're right that makes
36:09
your social phobia even worse
36:10
um because you'll scare them too much
36:12
and they'll die it's it's similar so
36:13
it's for their sake
36:14
so their abdomens are incredibly thin
36:17
and one little touch on the abdomen with
36:18
your fingernail could split it open and
36:20
they'll spill their guts all over the
36:21
place
36:21
so you can't just like tickle it on its
36:23
tummy or anything they hate a tummy stop
36:25
doing that and if you drop a tarantula
36:27
it'll almost certainly die
36:29
really yeah this is the advice of the um
36:32
the british tarantula society which is a
36:34
bit of a qi favorite i think
36:36
it was founded in the 1980s but the
36:38
woman who founded it was called anne
36:39
webb
36:42
that's going to make watching home alone
36:44
again a more harrowing experience
36:46
knowing that that tarantula that gets
36:48
loose and gets dropped and stuff i mean
36:50
they must have had a stunt spider
36:51
dressed as a tarantula if that's the
36:52
case
36:53
because he would have burst open in some
36:55
of the scenes i think you're assuming
36:57
too much knowledge of home alone from
36:58
some of us
36:59
i can't immediately remember the
37:00
tarantula scene yeah
37:02
the only thing i remember is kevin with
37:05
his hands to his face screaming because
37:07
he's been
37:07
left home alone yeah that's you've
37:10
memorized the poster
37:12
i'm sorry i'm gonna have to correct you
37:13
again he's not screaming because he's
37:14
left home alone he's screaming because
37:15
he put aftershave on his face yeah
37:17
yeah yeah yeah he was pretending because
37:18
he saw his dad screaming like that i
37:20
i don't
37:24
in the poster to make it look like he's
37:25
screaming at the two robbers who are
37:26
either side of him in the famous poster
37:28
the context of the film he's never
37:30
screaming i have an extremely clear
37:32
extremely fake memory this mum screams
37:36
his mom sits up on the plane and goes
37:37
kevin
37:38
that's that's he doesn't say no he
37:39
doesn't say why did he say his
37:41
name doesn't make any sense i still
37:44
think you're right though
37:47
what about him home alone too does he do
37:49
it there no because he's lost in new
37:51
york

02:34
hi alex thanks for coming on who is that
02:36
other guy we used to have
02:38
who the other there was another guy no
02:40
it's always been three person and one
02:41
guest doesn't it oh yeah
02:43
no no you're right sorry alex bell alexa
02:45
bell
02:46
okay so once again the three of us and
02:48
our guest alex edelman
02:49
have gathered around the microphones
02:50
with our four favorite facts from the
02:52
last seven days
02:53
and in no particular order here we go
02:56
starting with this is going to seem
02:58
suspicious because i'm never the first
03:00
fact and yet the day i host we're
03:02
starting with my facts and my fact is
03:04
that in 1903
03:05
it was made illegal in boston to lie
03:08
down in a canoe
03:09
that was very well known i know subtle
03:12
facts for you guys but
03:13
for us growing up the real neighborhood
03:15
bad boys would get drunk late at night
03:17
and take turns lying down
03:19
[Laughter]
03:22
sure so this is not news to bostonians
03:25
obviously
03:26
it's a big deal no this was uh this is
03:28
turn in the 20th century and
03:30
it was because there were a series of
03:32
lakes that had been created after the
03:33
charles river was damned about 100 years
03:36
earlier
03:36
and they became lovers horns because
03:38
basically it created
03:40
all these little nooks and crannies in
03:42
the water where you could pop in a canoe
03:43
and you suddenly didn't have a chaperone
03:45
and you weren't around the grown-ups
03:46
anymore so you took your girlfriend
03:47
popped in a canoe
03:48
and went and lay down sexually
03:51
in it uh in the undergrowth and people
03:54
caught on to the fact this was happening
03:56
and so a law was passed in the area that
03:58
said you weren't allowed to act
04:00
ludley in canoes and that covered doing
04:02
things like uh
04:03
hand-holding in a canoe embracing and
04:06
lowering your head below
04:07
the you know that bit that's the top of
04:09
the canoe you were
04:10
forbidden from canoodling canoodling
04:14
that one made its way over here i've
04:15
seen them yeah yeah some people call it
04:17
that
04:18
yeah so if you lay down in a canoe but
04:20
you're by yourself
04:22
would that still get you in trouble well
04:24
i don't think it would but
04:25
technically it wasn't legal yeah and it
04:27
was a twenty dollar fine
04:28
yes but i read somewhere that that was
04:30
about five hundred dollars today
04:32
yeah so it's a more serious penalty than
04:34
uh yeah
04:35
is it still is it still in effect well i
04:38
didn't read they had been withdrawn they
04:40
only arrested people for a couple of
04:42
years
04:42
and i think people got pretty annoyed
04:43
about it well basically people stopped
04:45
doing it because cars became a thing
04:47
and so you could get away from your
04:49
chaperones a lot easier in a car
04:51
yeah if you were you know yeah did they
04:54
think all that
04:54
car noodling
04:57
but uh all that the ban meant was as it
05:00
usually would is that the kids started
05:01
taking the piss
05:02
out of the park rangers and so they had
05:04
phonographs in their canoes which are
05:06
basically like um
05:07
big what are they called boxes oh yeah
05:09
yeah it's like in the you know if you
05:11
get an audi these days and pimp it up
05:12
with a massive stereo system this is the
05:14
equivalent in
05:15
exactly they did that in their canoes
05:17
and then blasted out like
05:18
lewd songs and loved songs and stuff and
05:21
snogged each other
05:22
in front of the the park rangers is this
05:24
technically a morality law
05:26
yeah that's exactly what it was people
05:27
thought it was immoral
05:29
but it spread as well so it wasn't just
05:31
in boston i read that uh
05:33
ten years later in minnesota there was a
05:35
curfew and the police had motorized
05:37
boats with spotlights so they would be
05:38
shining them around on the water
05:40
looking for lovers and also in 1913 the
05:43
following year the minneapolis parks
05:45
board
05:45
vetoed all the names you know how these
05:47
days you get um
05:49
car license plates that are banned
05:51
because they look like room words so
05:52
they were in 1913 there were banned
05:55
canoe names that people tried to
05:57
register and they included things like
05:59
uh the come on in kid the kiss me quick
06:03
g i love you joy tub cupid's nest
06:07
and i would like to try it
06:11
what a name i would like to try it yeah
06:14
you know there
06:14
it's funny because there are in in
06:17
certain states there's actually
06:18
maritime exemptions like in ohio you
06:22
can't be arrested
06:23
on sundays or the 4th of july for lesser
06:26
crimes that you commit on a river
06:28
really yes they do not extend to cases
06:30
of treason or felony
06:32
but uh so if you commit treason on a
06:34
river in ohio on a sunday your out
06:37
a lot
06:39
so yeah the less serious crimes can't be
06:41
arrested uh on a sunday or july the 4th
06:43
really yeah that's like in in scotland i
06:47
actually this is one of those things
06:48
that we were always told because when i
06:49
lived in scotland everyone says when
06:51
you're pissed you're steaming
06:52
and everyone said it was because um the
06:54
anti-drinking laws uh the prohibition
06:57
laws didn't apply if you took a boat out
06:58
to sea so everyone would just get on
07:00
their steamboats
07:02
doesn't sound very true but i haven't
07:04
verified that everyone had their old
07:05
personal steamboats
07:07
exactly cranked up and take the
07:08
steamboat out yeah i wonder how
07:10
how how lo-fi you can define something
07:13
as a steamboat you're just sitting on
07:20
[Laughter]
07:23
was boston quite famous for this because
07:25
there was a phrase that was
07:26
banned in boston which this was later on
07:29
in the century
07:30
uh so this was from the 1920s and the
07:31
phrase banned in boston became
07:33
super famous because so much was banned
07:35
and bostonians were really into
07:36
censoring so many books
07:38
for immorality um and publishers used to
07:41
try to get their books banned in boston
07:43
because then that was a mark of respect
07:45
and
07:45
that's the easiest place to get it
07:46
banned right yeah yeah wow is it a very
07:49
moral place boston
07:50
yes yes and no so boston had a
07:53
reputation
07:54
throughout its history for being a place
07:57
both of debauchery
07:58
and a place to sort of like somewhat
08:00
atoned for your debauchery so there was
08:02
like a very fragile piece that goes all
08:04
the way
08:04
into the end of the 1980s in an area
08:06
called a combat zone like a very a very
08:08
um
08:08
fragile piece between like the seedier
08:11
parts of blossom which is what it was
08:12
known for
08:13
and the sort of like conservative side
08:16
of boston is that a pot
08:18
it is must be right it is important it's
08:19
one of the biggest ports yeah so you're
08:21
going to have a lot of sailors coming in
08:22
and that kind of thing right if it was
08:23
landlocked the tea party would have been
08:25
very difficult
08:26
yeah the blast into yeah we're just
08:29
throwing it into a pond
08:31
they got off actually on the
08:32
technicality because it was a sunday
08:34
and it's not technically treason as they
08:37
boiled the tea it was steaming
08:40
the boston tea party was december 16
08:44
1773 it was a huge landmark day for
08:48
civil disobedience because it does it
08:50
like literally all i'm not getting all
08:51
the way going back to the founding of
08:53
boston
08:54
the police elements of boston and the
08:56
troublemaking elements of boston have
08:58
been in this like
08:59
weird alignment so the boston tea party
09:01
when it happened was seen as a huge
09:03
failure of that balance because people
09:05
really
09:06
were for both those things existing but
09:08
very separately and when
09:10
when the bostonians start to revolt
09:12
against the british
09:13
a lot of the loyalist elements of boston
09:15
were really upset that this fragile
09:17
peace between
09:18
the brothels which they like to access
09:19
themselves and respectable society
09:22
were were co-mingling and it was a real
09:24
big problem for the
09:25
like ruling classes in boston so you had
09:28
the um
09:29
you had the boston massacre around the
09:30
same time didn't you yes which is
09:33
caused by like a snowball fight or
09:34
something or there was like there was a
09:36
real kind of problem between the two
09:38
groups
09:38
and then one guy threw a snowball and
09:40
then it all kicked off
09:41
there were so many different little
09:42
fights and little like the boston
09:44
massacre was notable because the papers
09:46
really seized on it and there was a
09:47
popular wood cutting
09:48
that ended up proliferating in the same
09:51
way i guess you could say the
09:52
the wood cutting sort of went viral even
09:54
though it didn't strike me to pick the
09:55
tree viral woodcuts the free twitter
09:57
age it's a more fun one a lot of people
10:00
re-wood-cutted it
10:02
exactly yeah the world cup became a meme
10:03
they're like what's a good meme caption
10:05
for a woodcut of the boston massacre
10:07
mondays but the the thing that capture
10:11
popular imagination was an 11 year old
10:13
boy named christopher seider who was
10:14
shot in a protest in 1770
10:16
and that really that really kicked
10:19
things into high gear and after that
10:20
there was
10:21
until the end of the revolution boston
10:22
was just like a horrible place to be
10:24
british in an absolutely horrible place
10:26
to be a british loyalist so well i
10:28
thought it was a look back on with
10:29
fondness at the heroism of you
10:31
independent americans
10:32
starting to throw off us respectable
10:36
englishmen oh yeah crazy king a crazy
10:39
king
10:39
but the loyalist elements of the north
10:41
they had a really good case until the
10:43
british reacted and then
10:44
most loyalists were like actually yeah
10:46
this is probably not okay but
10:47
actually these guys are yeah
10:49
let's just get rid of them yeah
10:51
um well something interesting about the
10:52
morality movement in boston though later
10:55
on
10:55
was so it was all um enforced by a
10:58
society called the watch and ward
10:59
society
11:00
and this was a society that clamped down
11:02
on lascivious literature and stuff like
11:04
that
11:04
one of the driving forces behind it was
11:06
a guy called godfrey cabo
11:09
and he uh led this thing against books
11:12
he thought were immoral he thought the
11:13
three musketeers was immoral
11:14
he thought tolstoy was a moral pervert
11:16
he told his wife not to read george
11:18
eliot when he wasn't there absolutely
11:20
it was dangerous wow you stop your wife
11:23
from reading that as well james
11:25
but this is the amazing thing about him
11:26
someone wrote a biography recently and
11:28
uncovered
11:29
multiple erotic literature and letters
11:31
that he used to send to his wife
11:32
all the time so he'd write to his wife
11:35
in german
11:36
which she didn't understand very well
11:37
and he sort of wrote about how
11:39
he'd had this amazing dream about how
11:40
she'd urinated in his mouth
11:42
he greedily swallowed it oh my god yeah
11:45
yeah
11:45
p.s do not read any george eliot
11:48
there is a divorce in the third chapter
11:52
he said another letter saying he'd had a
11:54
fantasy about her being
11:56
a starving giantess who devoured him
11:58
hungrily and then he wrote writes all
11:59
this in german
12:00
and then he switches to english and he
12:02
says better destroy this letter darling
12:04
um
12:04
and you know you just didn't know the
12:06
word for urine maybe in german it's very
12:08
similar to
12:09
chocolate cake right it's probably that
12:11
that's so
12:12
it's not weird no it's it's almost too
12:15
perfect right the sensor is like i'm
12:17
confiscating this erratic literature
12:20
you can collect it the pages will be
12:22
stuck together in a few days
12:24
you know that's still around the
12:25
washington ward society is it it's been
12:28
it's it changed its focus in the 40s to
12:30
um
12:31
to focus on more more socially
12:34
acceptable vices to hate like gambling
12:36
and other stuff
12:38
and then they became a criminal justice
12:39
reform thing and they're around in like
12:41
a boring bureaucratic office near boston
12:42
common now like they're
12:44
still winging each other's mouths behind
12:46
closed doors
12:47
which of us can honestly say we haven't
12:49
written to a lover wishing they were a
12:51
starving giant who would
12:52
throw us into their mouths yeah i've got
12:54
some more things that are illegal in
12:56
boston
12:57
uh actually most of these are illegal
12:59
all over massachusetts oh my god this is
13:01
from an
13:01
article on cbs which is strange but true
13:04
obscure massachusetts laws
13:06
correct which normally if we would read
13:08
that they would all be false but i've
13:09
checked most of them and they do seem to
13:10
be true so
13:11
uh it's illegal to sell rabbits ducks or
13:14
chickens that have been dyed a different
13:15
color than the
13:16
natural color really that's like the guy
13:19
that's like a fish seller in thailand
13:20
earlier this year who put googly eyes on
13:22
his fish to make it like fresher
13:24
that's so good and it's illegal to sing
13:26
only a portion of the star spangled
13:28
banner
13:29
in public so once you start you have to
13:31
get all the way to the end
13:33
i read that and it says it says you
13:35
can't it says
13:36
if you play it as part of a medley of
13:39
any kind
13:40
you're breaking the law is chapter 264
13:43
section 9 of the massachusetts code so
13:45
it's a definite thing
13:46
so you have to sing the whole thing if
13:48
even if you start even if you sing the
13:49
first word and then you think better
13:51
you have to keep going well people are
13:53
going to want to know you can't leave
13:54
the question i would say can you say and
13:56
be like
13:56
see what why the dawn's really like what
13:59
are we seeing
14:03
you need to give a full answer it's full
14:06
of cliffhangers
14:07
wait hang on is there a last word to the
14:09
star spangled yeah
14:11
yes we can see that
14:19
okay on to fact number two and that is
14:22
james's facts okay my fact this week is
14:24
that henry viii
14:25
once enjoyed a pudding so much that he
14:28
awarded the woman who made it
14:30
one of the monasteries that he just
14:31
seized from the catholic church
14:33
[Laughter]
14:36
it's amazing what kind of pudding it was
14:39
not recounted as to what kind of pudding
14:41
it was the holy grail of pudding when
14:42
you're missing
14:43
when you say pudding is it like a
14:45
american put like a
14:46
like a like a chocolate mousse not like
14:49
a mousse because
14:50
like that's a pudding but it's not a
14:52
pudding you know in the old days of
14:53
pudding was a lump of
14:54
suet or you know started with raisins or
14:56
it was a sort of
14:57
discreet thing so was this when you say
14:59
pudding are we talking dessert
15:01
i mean it's a kind of dessert but more
15:02
specific than that okay so i'm saying so
15:05
it is a moose or it's not a moose it's
15:06
not a moose
15:07
okay fine alaska's most popular game
15:14
so yeah basically this is what happened
15:16
a lot of people will know this that um
15:18
henry viii dissolved the monasteries uh
15:21
and which meant that he took all of the
15:23
property away from the monks and from
15:25
the nuns and what does he do with it
15:26
well he puts it into the
15:28
he puts it into the coffers but also he
15:30
gives a lot of it to his friends
15:32
uh at one stage he lost some of it in a
15:34
game of cards
15:36
apparently he lost the jesus bells of
15:38
old saint paul's church on a single
15:40
throw of dice
15:41
oh my god but yeah you've suddenly
15:43
you've got a load of monasteries what
15:44
are you going to do with them
15:45
you're going to gamble with them spend
15:47
them on puddings i
15:49
i like to imagine that he had run out of
15:51
change and he just tried the pudding and
15:53
it was so good he said i haven't got
15:54
anything to pay with uh
15:56
i suppose you could have this
15:59
sort of more inconvenient than just cash
16:01
i didn't think i'd accept monastery
16:03
would you not if i were working in a
16:05
shop no no i just asked for the cash
16:08
you're short-sighted that's what you are
16:10
sorry henry do you have a contact list
16:12
maybe
16:14
um so i found out a fact that links uh
16:16
these two things that you've mentioned
16:18
in the fact james pudding and henry viii
16:20
so today the great british bake off tent
16:23
is in a place called welford park
16:25
in berkshire and it be it housed a
16:27
monastery
16:28
before henry the eighth dissolved so
16:30
today puddings are made
16:32
on the site of one of the
16:35
that's dissolved really cool that's
16:36
incredible that's really good
16:39
how did you find that out i don't know
16:43
baked goods monastery and it was like
16:45
you're in luck today baby
16:50
very cool um but yeah sweet sweet food
16:52
which i assumed this was
16:54
was a massive deal it suddenly took off
16:56
didn't it at least for the nobles in
16:57
henry viii time
16:59
and they had such impressive things so
17:01
it was called a void i think the sweet
17:04
course so you'd have a certain number of
17:06
courses in your meal
17:08
in the 16th century and the number of
17:10
courses you had depended on your social
17:12
status
17:13
and then the last course was avoid and
17:16
it was because you had it standing up
17:17
while
17:18
the table was cleared so the servants
17:20
came along and they cleared everything
17:22
off the table and the void were your
17:23
sweet things that you just stood up and
17:24
ate just kidding or you went elsewhere
17:26
to eat them
17:27
or yeah really interesting yeah i would
17:30
want
17:30
that that sets me on edge a bit i like
17:32
to relax with a pudding and sit down
17:34
well they want you on edge have you
17:36
talked to you on edge what if you just
17:37
get like an ice cream when you're out in
17:38
the park do you have to sit down tweet
17:40
that
17:40
preferably at a table with uh crockery
17:46
but yeah it rendered the table void wow
17:49
that's
17:49
that's unbelievable what we i can't
17:52
believe we don't know what pudding it is
17:53
it seems like
17:55
i'm so sorry this comes i didn't find
17:57
this in many places
17:58
the main place i found it online is from
18:00
memoirs of the court of henry viii
18:02
volume 2 by catherine thompson
18:04
which is a google book which um you can
18:07
only get a few of the pages
18:09
i can only see a few of these pages and
18:11
i don't know i don't think we know what
18:13
it was
18:14
i think it was just recounted at the
18:15
time she probably kept the recipe secret
18:18
though because she doesn't want everyone
18:19
getting a free monastery
18:21
here's the thing henry viii's favorite
18:23
dessert was called
18:24
maids of honor and there are no tarts
18:27
not
18:29
what maids of honor aren't hearts oh
18:32
it's ironic isn't it it's an ironic
18:33
dessert
18:34
yeah i hear that he would eat one
18:37
and then he'd behead the next one
18:41
well he just found these in a in a place
18:44
one time they were served to him
18:45
and he loved them so much that he
18:47
confiscated the recipe
18:48
and locked it in an iron box and
18:50
announced they were for royal
18:51
consumption only
18:53
wow it does sound not very true i
18:55
haven't seen it debunked
18:57
yeah go on well no that's that's all it
18:59
was it was just someone said this
19:00
probably isn't so
19:01
i've seen other people saying that um
19:03
this lady was killed so that she
19:05
couldn't get that and i've seen that
19:06
debunked
19:07
this might not be true as well i mean it
19:09
does it has the ring of fakeness to it
19:11
doesn't it and there's another story
19:12
that
19:13
um someone from the royal household then
19:15
snuck the recipe out and that's how we
19:17
know it now kind of thing
19:18
that's cool but they're a bit like those
19:20
you know those um custard touch you get
19:22
in
19:22
um portugal yeah but like those oh just
19:25
like that and he thought that was worth
19:26
locking under locking keys i don't like
19:28
those but a lot of people do really like
19:30
them don't they i guess yeah
19:32
one pudding that they enjoyed in henry
19:34
viii's time was eel wrapped in marzipan
19:38
sounds really nice what's the grossest
19:40
dish from history that you guys
19:42
have come across the one that comes to
19:44
my head straight away is son of a
19:46
pie
19:47
which is made by all of the pieces of a
19:49
cow and one onion no
19:52
and it was like a cowboy recipe that
19:54
they used to make in america
19:56
son of a pie it sounds like a
19:58
cowboy recipe
20:00
um i would love for you guys to have a
20:03
day
20:03
where you do a live qi podcast and cook
20:07
many of the many of the dishes that you
20:09
it would be such a spectrum of
20:11
deliciousness
20:12
in terms of grotesque all the way to
20:14
great i didn't have a podcast of
20:16
vomiting for
20:17
three hours is what people want well you
20:18
do the podcast first and then you have
20:20
it out there
20:20
and then you have a vomitorium and you
20:22
do facts about that okay
20:24
what's what's the place i think we did
20:25
this when i was on the podcast long long
20:27
time ago about a finger shot a pickled
20:30
finger
20:30
oh um sato cocktail yes there's a big
20:33
toe
20:34
in some bar yes and you have to in
20:36
canada yeah
20:37
yeah and you have to drink the shot or
20:40
the
20:41
cocktail or whatever and then give the
20:42
toe back but sometimes people steal it
20:43
or swallow it
20:45
also you're supposed to kiss the toe so
20:46
it needs to touch your lips while you're
20:48
drinking the whiskey that's pretty
20:49
disgusting i mean
20:50
hey if we can book it for the q i
20:52
podcast live
20:53
gastronomy day i i didn't realize there
20:57
were so many
20:57
daily accounts of like tutor court life
21:01
and i found this thing called the voices
21:03
of more bath
21:04
and this is a a priest named christopher
21:09
treiche who survived the religious
21:12
changes of henry viii
21:14
edward vi mary the first and elizabeth
21:16
the first
21:17
by um is sort of subtly shifting his
21:19
views every time
21:21
but he but in his memoirs for the voices
21:24
of
21:25
more bath he expresses the most regret
21:28
about the
21:28
uh about the stripping of the
21:30
monasteries well but at the time it was
21:32
like this old thing
21:34
i've been saying we should get rid of
21:35
this yeah but that's exactly that was
21:37
his attitude he's like
21:38
who loves jesus he's not here is he
21:42
you're here but he's not the queen mary
21:44
comes along and he's like
21:45
i don't know what those bastards did
21:47
with my mother but i want it back but
21:48
that's exactly what
21:50
he says that he was like he was like his
21:52
righteous fury when that when they came
21:54
right and like
21:55
what whiplash you must get must have
21:57
gotten religiously i think we've all
21:58
done
21:59
it though i've definitely made horrible
22:00
missteps in a conversation
22:02
and then found out the person i'm
22:04
talking to has very very different views
22:06
and sort of subtly walked it back
22:08
[Laughter]
22:10
four times is quite impressive four
22:12
times in 54 years
22:13
oh that's fine yeah 13 years per walk
22:16
that's fine i can do it in five minutes
22:18
i once took both sides of an opposing
22:20
argument over the course of an evening
22:22
and lost the argument both times
22:31
you know that thing that um chess
22:32
players often do where they play
22:34
multiple games of chess but what they do
22:36
is
22:37
they play the moves that one person is
22:38
playing against them against the other
22:40
person so they always win at least half
22:41
of the game darren brown did that if
22:43
yeah
22:43
before not to spoil darren brown's uh
22:46
one of darren brown's specials but he
22:47
did that
22:48
and beat all these chess yeah i was
22:51
thinking you could do that in your
22:52
arguments you could just run to the
22:53
other the pub and then just use the
22:54
arguments
22:55
well that's what i tried i tried doing
22:57
that because someone made a really good
22:58
argument i was like you know what you've
22:59
convinced me and then i had the argument
23:01
later on the evening
23:02
with my new convinced opinion and i got
23:04
creamed
23:06
i've got chess facts actually about this
23:08
fact which is the woolsey you know
23:10
cardinal woolsey who was um henry viii's
23:12
uh right-hand man at the start before he
23:14
killed him
23:15
um uh
23:18
once served an entire chess set made of
23:20
marzipan as a dessert
23:22
which is quite impressive we deserved it
23:24
to the french ambassadors when they
23:25
visited that's a lot of eels
23:28
i've always wanted to have a cheese
23:30
chess
23:31
board game where all the pieces are made
23:33
of different kinds of cheese and when
23:34
you take an opponent's piece you get to
23:36
eat it
23:36
because it's only one word away from
23:38
chessboard and cheeseburger exactly
23:41
so i think this is a big commercial
23:43
opportunity that i'm throwing away now
23:44
by saying it on a podcast
23:46
what would be your king cheese you know
23:48
the ultimate that you're going for
23:51
it's got to be a baby bell it's got to
23:52
be a baby bottle no
23:54
that's crazy cheese drinks cheese isn't
23:57
it that's crazy a smoked gouda
24:00
nice um i think it's going to be a hard
24:03
cheese doesn't it
24:04
like for the king it's quite hard to
24:06
have a player made of brie
24:08
i would say depending on the temperature
24:10
of the room you're playing again
24:11
you might need to play really fast
24:13
pretty so hard to carve
24:16
the reason you but they just had an
24:19
extraordinary number of courses
24:20
at the tudor dining table so if there
24:23
were these laws about how many you could
24:25
have and it depends on your status as i
24:27
was saying so if you were a cardinal you
24:29
could have seven to nine courses
24:31
or seven to nine dishes it's enough uh
24:34
if you were let's say a member of the
24:36
gentry class you're only allowed three
24:38
dishes
24:39
and so you have to know what equals a
24:40
dish and it would be a specific number
24:42
of a certain thing so if you're having a
24:44
swan
24:44
you only got one swan and that's a full
24:46
dish if you're having chicken you get
24:47
six chickens
24:48
if you're eating lark you get twelve
24:50
larks for one person
24:52
uh well it's a family bucket that i
24:54
think it's for the table
24:55
yeah because they have they have a they
24:58
had systems of trenches you know they'd
24:59
have a big sort of central plate with
25:01
all the food served in that you'd take
25:02
from that are you allowed to have half a
25:04
swan and maybe just six lakhs
25:06
i don't i didn't actually read into the
25:07
law that much but i'm sure you could
25:09
negotiate with the authorities if they
25:11
checked
25:11
so mark wahlberg published his routine
25:13
this week did any did either of you guys
25:14
see that
25:15
mark wahlberg put his routine up online
25:17
this is i don't want to bore you with
25:18
the details but how about i just
25:20
entertain you with the details
25:22
mark wakes up at 2 30 a.m then he prays
25:24
for half an hour
25:25
and and he better pray because from 3 40
25:27
to 5 15 he's working out
25:29
um it's not his last workout of the day
25:31
then he showers
25:32
it is his last shower of the day the
25:35
shower's an
25:36
hour and a half long then he has his
25:38
first of three snacks
25:39
okay the snack only takes half an hour
25:42
and you might be like
25:43
only yeah because snack number two is
25:45
from 8 to 9 30.
25:46
so that's an hour and a half for a snack
25:48
and he would save a whole hour and a
25:49
half if he just ate it in the shower
25:51
[Laughter]
25:52
so breakfast lunch and dinner are on the
25:54
schedule but they're not part of snack
25:57
mark wahlberg spends two and a half
25:58
hours of his day just eating snacks
26:00
wow by the way my favorite detail he
26:03
does half an hour of golf
26:04
during the day and i just like i know i
26:06
just like to imagine him doing 18 holes
26:08
in half an hour there's like a golf cart
26:11
60 miles an hour down a fairway just
26:13
like can i play through i have one
26:15
minute and 44 seconds to play this all
26:17
the time
26:18
here's what mark wahlberg eats i start
26:20
out with steel oats blueberries and
26:21
peanut butter for breakfast then i have
26:23
a protein shake
26:24
three turkey burgers five pieces of
26:25
sweet potato and then it's 5 30 in the
26:27
morning
26:28
at 8 o'clock i have 10 turkey meatballs
26:30
at 10 30 a.m i have a grilled chicken
26:32
salad with two hard-boiled eggs olives
26:34
avocado cucumber tomato and lettuce
26:36
then at one o'clock i have a new york
26:37
steak with green peppers at 3 30. i have
26:39
a grilled chicken with bok choy
26:40
at 5 30 6 o'clock i have a beautiful
26:42
piece of halibut or cottage sea bass
26:43
with some vegetables
26:45
maybe some sauteed potatoes and bok choy
26:47
and then i have a lot of aqua hydrate
26:48
during the day
26:49
and then he goes that's it
26:52
it sounds like he's a tudor nobleman
26:54
yeah it really is the amount of protein
26:56
he has
26:56
and by the way nowhere during his
26:58
schedule
27:00
that he's published are there any
27:01
bathroom breaks so that digestive system
27:03
he probably does that in the shower yeah
27:05
it's an hour and a half shower that's
27:06
why he's taking it or he leans out the
27:08
side of the golf cart going 60 miles an
27:10
hour
27:11
with a very stressed out caddy he was
27:13
like what are you doing
27:14
by the way nowhere in mark wahlberg's
27:16
schedule was there any time allocated
27:18
for work in acting which i found very
27:20
interesting i think that makes sense
27:23
[Music]
27:23
[Applause]
27:28
uh so it's time for fact number three
27:30
that is andes
27:32
my fact is that dolphins in the wild
27:33
have been teaching each other how to
27:35
moonwalk
27:37
pretty cool um to michael jackson's
27:39
songs
27:40
or like why are they doing that uh
27:43
not to michael jackson wilder is it the
27:46
wild
27:46
oh wow so well so there was a pod of
27:49
dolphins in australia and they are wild
27:51
but there was one who joined them whose
27:53
name was billy don't know whether
27:55
billy gene maybe um he's just a fish who
27:58
thinks that i am the one
28:00
sorry if he's a wild dolphin why has he
28:02
got a name okay so this is the thing
28:04
billy i think billy was a she uh like
28:07
millie piper
28:08
billy gene
28:09
[Laughter]
28:12
um so billy was rescued from a polluted
28:14
harbour
28:15
and kept in a dolphin area for several
28:17
several weeks and while there
28:19
she observed other dolphins doing this
28:22
moonwalking trick which is where you
28:23
kind of stand on your tail and you swish
28:25
back and forth really hard
28:26
so you move backwards through the water
28:27
like a moonwalk um she wasn't taught to
28:30
do it she just observed and started
28:31
doing it herself
28:33
and then when she was released in the
28:34
wild she was spotted seven years later
28:37
in her pod
28:37
and loads of them were moonwalking and
28:39
liz them were really good at it and
28:40
others in the pod 11 of them were
28:42
spotted doing this trick and what i
28:44
really love about it because this was
28:45
actually about 10 years ago this
28:46
happened yeah but what why it's in the
28:48
news at the moment
28:49
is because the new generation has just
28:51
stopped doing it yeah so it's kind of
28:53
something that their parents do these
28:54
are kids
28:56
all these dolphins are now flossing now
28:57
they're just like
28:59
but they don't do anything the dolphins
29:00
would be embarrassed you're like my
29:02
dad's always
29:02
watching well it's so funny when you
29:06
send it through at first i i was trying
29:07
to conceive of how they'd i'm like where
29:09
did they get the shoes
29:10
[Laughter]
29:11
there was a news about a dolphin this
29:12
year a randy dolphin wasn't there
29:15
that i think came just slightly too late
29:17
to get into our book of the year
29:19
yeah oh what's that book of the year a
29:22
little project we've been working on
29:23
uh the book of the year 2018. but yeah
29:25
there was news this year about a randy
29:28
dolphin who shut down an
29:29
entire beach this was in brittany in
29:32
august so brittany in france and it was
29:34
a beach in the bay of brest
29:36
fittingly and there's this dolphin
29:38
called zafar um jafar with a zed
29:41
if you're wondering and people used to
29:42
would go to the beach and swim with him
29:44
and they could hold on to his fin and
29:45
he'd sort of like
29:46
bound around he's very friendly but he
29:48
wanted something interesting he wanted
29:50
something and he started to try and have
29:51
sex with people all the time
29:52
there was one woman who he picked up and
29:54
lifted out of the water and wouldn't let
29:55
her back down
29:56
um he would rub up sexually against
29:58
kayaks and other small boats maybe he
30:00
wanted to do some canoodling yeah
30:03
um so they shut down the entire beach
30:05
they shut down the beach you're not
30:06
allowed within 50 meters of him and
30:08
you're not allowed to go in the water
30:09
people have really learned from jaws
30:10
haven't they and that they didn't shut
30:12
down the beat for ages and there was a
30:13
shark eating people
30:15
well yeah it was tourist season on amity
30:17
island it was it's part of the industry
30:19
what's wrong with you andy
30:21
people always go after this mayor he's
30:22
just trying to keep his community afloat
30:25
it's the economics of the thing quite
30:28
impressively
30:29
monkeys and macaques can teach their
30:32
offspring
30:33
to floss so on animal teaching
30:36
it's not the dance i don't think
30:38
although i didn't check it out
30:41
well they're flossing with human hair
30:43
does the dance involve
30:44
human hair i think it might just be your
30:47
average tooth flossing
30:48
but yeah i didn't even know they really
30:49
flossed but um this was first spotted in
30:51
2009 in thailand
30:53
and uh female monkeys were nicking hair
30:55
off human
30:56
heads or human clothes and then flossing
30:58
their teeth with it and they found they
31:00
spent double the amount of time flossing
31:01
if they were doing it in front of their
31:02
children in front of yous
31:04
to show them how to do it if my dentist
31:07
said do you floss and i say no and he
31:09
said well monkeys do
31:10
and i think i might do it i think i
31:12
might do it you should change your
31:14
dentist
31:14
[Laughter]
31:16
this is a cool thing um killer whales
31:19
they teach their young
31:20
um you know how that move where they
31:21
surge onto a beach and they they
31:23
grab a seal so killer whale mothers will
31:26
practice with their calves but they
31:28
first practice by
31:29
surging onto a really steep beach so the
31:31
calf can get back really easily
31:33
and also one where there are no seals so
31:35
it's like a driving lesson basically
31:37
that's so cool yeah and they do that and
31:39
then and then they'll practice maybe
31:41
you know a slightly shallower beach and
31:42
you know it gets gradually harder
31:44
but it's sort of the opposite of when
31:45
humans are learning to drive because you
31:46
wouldn't do the very steep hill start
31:48
until quite late in your lessons
31:53
um just on dolphins they're they have a
31:55
language
31:56
um so they talk tweets german
32:00
click noises isn't it and um and noises
32:03
that we can't really hear
32:04
but the way that we know that it's a
32:06
language and not random noise
32:08
is they did studies on something called
32:10
zips
32:11
law that's and what it is
32:14
is the most common words in any language
32:17
occur about 10 times more than the
32:20
second most common which occur 10 times
32:21
more than the third most common it's not
32:23
10 times but it's
32:24
a logarithmic scale and they checked all
32:26
of these noises that
32:27
dolphins were making and they found that
32:29
in dolphin languages they have exactly
32:31
the same laws as all human languages
32:33
so the most common clicks that they make
32:35
are
32:36
a certain percentage more than the
32:38
second most commonly the most common
32:40
and by doing all of this study and
32:42
working that out they reckon that
32:43
they're going to use it to work out if
32:45
aliens are trying to
32:46
contact us because if we get any kind of
32:48
signals from space we won't know it's a
32:50
language or it just could be random but
32:52
if we can work it out like dolphins that
32:53
it has this kind of zips
32:55
law that's very important so does that
32:58
mean that you can spot
32:59
the really pretentious dolphin so we're
33:01
just using the extremely rare
33:05
this word only came up once in 20 years
33:08
and it was a dolphin and glasses over
33:09
there
33:11
another thing about dolphins my favorite
33:13
dolphin is kelly the dolphin
33:15
uh and what they did was they taught
33:17
these dolphins
33:18
that if any rubbish got into their pool
33:21
then they could collect it and give it
33:22
to their keeper
33:23
and they would get a treat okay so
33:25
whenever any tourist dropped in a piece
33:27
of paper
33:28
they pick it up give it to the uh keeper
33:30
and they get a treat
33:31
so what kelly did was whenever someone
33:33
drops in some paper she would hide it at
33:35
the bottom of the pool
33:36
under a stone and then she would rip off
33:38
a little bit and give it to
33:40
her and get a treat and then once she's
33:42
got the treats she'd go down and rip
33:43
another little piece off and get another
33:44
treat and to get loads of treats for one
33:46
bit
33:47
oh my god that's smart that isn't it
33:50
that's naughty is what that is it
33:52
doesn't reward that kind of it's illegal
33:53
in boston unless it's uh sunday or the
33:55
4th of july
33:56
that's what that is i'm desperate to
33:58
know the limits of like an animal
34:00
like like in animals uh like there were
34:03
always fights
34:04
about what to do with coco the gorilla
34:05
because so coco the gorilla was
34:08
a gorilla who could communicate with
34:09
people with sign language yeah someone
34:11
wanted coco to write a novel
34:12
and they were like no no who was like
34:16
no the agent the publisher died this
34:20
year didn't she
34:21
yeah i covered her dad and coco died
34:23
shortly before the edinburgh fringe
34:24
festival
34:25
and i have a joke about coke on my show
34:26
and i lived in fear every day because i
34:28
would go coco is a gorilla
34:29
and i and every day i lived in fear
34:32
someone going uh not anymore
34:35
she's an ex gorilla yeah luckily i
34:37
didn't go to any brother she had to
34:38
watch a show otherwise i'd have been
34:40
straight there on the front row no no
34:41
you definitely would have been
34:42
the joke is about coco meeting robin
34:44
williams and uh bobcat goldthwait who's
34:46
really good friends with robin williams
34:48
a comedian saw me do the joke
34:50
and said to me afterwards you know coco
34:52
tried to have sex with robin williams
34:54
and uh yes and coco and robin met twice
34:57
and the second time coco made a sign
34:59
and apparently and robin said to the
35:02
handlers like what did goku just saying
35:04
they're like uh robin let's uh let's get
35:05
you like slowly moving towards the uh
35:08
can we get you can we get you over here
35:10
so that's a bit of a
35:12
it's a bit of hot goss that you probably
35:14
can include because
35:15
i've seen bobcat say it on stage so
35:17
that's really good
35:23
okay moving on to our final fact and
35:26
that is from alex
35:28
all right in medieval germany the
35:30
funniest joke anyone had ever heard
35:31
involved replacing a flower with a poo
35:34
[Laughter]
35:36
it still it still works so funny i
35:38
haven't even heard the full version
35:39
all right so how would it go so there's
35:41
a poet named neidhart
35:42
who's walking along and he finds the
35:44
first violet of spring and he puts his
35:46
cap
35:46
over the flower to mark the spot and
35:48
when he's gone this this guy
35:50
happens by a bit of a prankster and he
35:52
lifts up the cap and he picks the flower
35:54
and we'll say he squats down to leave
35:56
his own souvenir
35:58
and uh neidhart comes back with like an
36:01
entire court including the king queen
36:04
does this big celebratory dance around
36:06
the cap and then with great ceremony and
36:08
a plum
36:09
removes it to reveal a fresh steaming
36:11
pile of human
36:13
and it was so funny in medieval germany
36:17
that the book by ken jennings called
36:19
planet funny which which talks about it
36:21
says and variations on the story were
36:23
recycled in song dance pros and drama
36:25
and art and then in italics he writes
36:27
four decades for a time it was
36:30
fashionable for people to replace the
36:32
portraits of the saints in their homes
36:34
with paintings of the violet trick
36:36
[Laughter]
36:37
which made the church really unhappy and
36:40
yeah it was a huge it was a huge huge
36:43
joke fad
36:44
and um it just totally resonated because
36:47
maybe because people were so oppressed
36:50
resonated we've all been there it's
36:52
classic observational comedy
36:55
michael mcintyre will be proud of that
36:56
material so people's homes used to have
36:59
portraits of feces just all over the
37:01
walls for a time
37:02
not vcs it would be neidheart pulling
37:04
his cap up
37:05
and then there'd be the feces in it and
37:07
like you know court people with their
37:09
hands over their faces and stuff like
37:11
that i assume
37:12
yeah that's right it was turned into a
37:14
play yeah i just turned into a full-on
37:16
play
37:16
wow yeah this was i think it's the
37:19
earliest non-religious drama of the
37:21
middle ages that we have surviving today
37:23
this play but but it gets a bit more
37:25
serious in the play because
37:26
um it's a contest to find the first
37:28
violet of spring in the play and
37:30
um there's a fanfare of trumpet as the
37:32
cap is lifted up
37:33
but when it's revealed the villagers
37:35
they're all teasing knightheart
37:37
uh who is a knight in the story they
37:39
take the violet and the turd
37:41
and they hoist it on a pole and they
37:42
dance around it and knightheart doesn't
37:44
see the funny side and he cuts off the
37:45
left legs of 32 of the villagers
37:49
so i have to lean on the pole wow yeah
37:52
it's not taking a joke very well
37:54
imagine if um at the edinburgh festival
37:57
uh
37:57
you had that response when you told a
37:59
bad joke i think there would be a higher
38:01
bar to people entering
38:04
um but they were quite into this so in
38:07
the 15th century i also read
38:08
about a poem by a guy called heinz de
38:11
kelner um
38:12
who baked beans were named after who no
38:15
they weren't but he
38:16
wrote a poem about a peasant who
38:19
outwitted a princess in this verbal duel
38:21
and so they were having this verbal
38:23
jewel they're bantering back and forth
38:24
which sounds quite funny anyway and
38:25
they're trying to outwit
38:26
each other and then she says that his
38:28
material is utter
38:30
and he lifts up his hat to reveal an
38:33
actual poo
38:33
underneath it on his head which
38:36
apparently proved she was correct
38:37
meant that she had to marry him or he
38:39
had to marry him
38:40
so that's a variation on uh that's a
38:43
variation yeah
38:44
what a relief for for him that she said
38:47
your material is utter
38:49
she never says it but he probably his
38:51
whole life he had this poo on his head
38:53
and he was just waiting for that one
38:54
moment right very old poop
38:57
at that point and she had to marry him
39:00
i think this never say to any comedian
39:03
especially when wearing a hat
39:05
but they're material because you
39:07
might end up having to marry them
39:09
oh my god that's yeah how'd you do me
39:11
you're not gonna like this
39:16
i was just looking up sort of other
39:17
german comedy uh from the middle ages
39:20
so there was um a play called dulcitius
39:24
which is an adaptation of roman play
39:26
and it's it involves a governor who's
39:29
got three virgins locked in a pantry
39:31
and he wants to kind of caress them uh
39:34
but he goes in the pantry and it's all
39:36
dark in there
39:37
and he keeps on molesting various
39:38
kitchen utensils
39:40
thinking that they're the young women
39:42
thinking implausibly that they're the
39:43
young women
39:44
who yeah well these do sound kind of
39:46
funny
39:47
they're kind of not completely funny i
39:49
think a lot of the stuff that
39:51
um fad comedy or comedy fads they're all
39:55
mechanisms to relieve
39:56
tension like this probably so funny
39:57
because of like the the the dour culture
40:00
around you know being alive in in
40:03
14th century germany didn't encourage
40:05
this kind of irreverence
40:06
and like um i got a really funny joke
40:09
from from this joke absolutely
40:10
swept through 1968 egypt
40:14
which was a man narrowly misses a bus
40:16
takes off down the street in pursuit
40:18
he's so fast that he catches up with the
40:19
bus at the end of the block and hops the
40:21
board
40:21
the conductor seeing his feet only
40:23
charges him half fair
40:25
so uh here's here's what you need to
40:27
know apparently in 1967
40:29
i didn't get the job have you ever heard
40:31
of brissette yes i love it i love it
40:33
it's not gone well this year i love a
40:34
joke with an afterword yeah
40:37
well i guess these things these things
40:38
were all contextual they all killed
40:40
contextually
40:41
so egyptian military personnel got 50
40:44
off on buses on public transport
40:46
and they had just been beaten in the 67
40:48
war in a way that was so
40:51
bad that even in their own country they
40:53
sort of had like a reputation for
40:54
retreating
40:55
that was like sort of not unlike the way
40:57
that we think about the french
40:58
in like today is in terms of comedy
41:01
awesome so the bus driver sees this guy
41:03
running
41:04
and he thinks this guy is running so
41:05
fast that the only way he could be
41:07
running this fast is if he's a soldier
41:09
in retreat
41:10
so therefore he gets 50 off on the bus
41:14
but some jokes are some jokes do seem to
41:16
be quite timeless
41:18
so that one very specific to 1968 i
41:20
guess in
41:21
in egypt but how about this one from the
41:24
fifth century bc
41:26
uh this is from uh ancient roman joke
41:28
book so it was told it was
41:30
recounted a bit later but it's based in
41:32
the fifth century bc
41:33
and a macedonian king was asked by his
41:36
barber
41:37
how should i cut your hair so the
41:39
macedonian king was arkhilas
41:41
uh and the barber asked him how should i
41:42
cut your hair and archalaus replied
41:45
in silence that's that's attributed to
41:47
churchill i've seen that
41:49
and to enoch powell oh they're nicking
41:52
it all these classicists
41:53
and nicking it from the macedonian king
41:56
wow he probably knicks it from someone
41:58
else's
41:59
researching this the thing that i found
42:01
the most interesting was like
42:02
things i guess comedy fads throughout
42:05
history that had their moment
42:06
and then just totally disappeared like
42:09
sorry to read again but like uh i do
42:11
want to give credit to ken jennings who
42:12
by the way he's written this book called
42:14
planet funny
42:15
and it is really funny in a really good
42:17
history of comedy
42:18
and ken trivia-wise could give any run
42:21
on the planet to run for their money
42:22
because he won
42:23
74 episodes of jeopardy in a row which
42:25
is 2.1 million
42:27
but so abraham lincoln gathered his
42:29
cabinet to the white house
42:30
early on september 2nd september 22 1862
42:34
and his secretary of war was really
42:37
annoyed because he
42:38
had a lot on his plate at the time
42:40
because it was a civil war
42:41
and the president was reading a very
42:44
popular
42:45
series of books uh from a from a really
42:47
popular uh book by artemis ward who was
42:49
a country-fried humorist
42:50
that sort of explored american comedy to
42:53
london in the 1860s
42:54
and it was sort of like the president
42:57
doing anchorman quotes like it was
42:58
very very popular and sort of hack and
43:01
he was reading a sketch
43:02
um called the high-handed outrage at
43:04
utica about a traveling salesman trying
43:06
to impress
43:07
upstate new yorkers with wax figurines
43:09
of the 12 apostles
43:11
and um a local ruffian ruins his trip by
43:14
by pounding his judas statue all the
43:16
hell in a fit of religious forever and
43:17
he was laughing
43:19
really loudly by the time he got to the
43:20
end and standing says without a single
43:22
member of the cabinet joining in
43:26
undeterred the president proceeded to
43:27
read a second chapter
43:30
and stanton said he was about to walk
43:32
out when the president
43:33
declared an end to the open mic night
43:35
and got to the business at hand
43:37
pulling a paper from his trademark hat
43:39
he read to them a document he had just
43:40
finished rising
43:41
and it decided to issue the emancipation
43:43
proclamation freeing every slave of the
43:45
confederacy
43:46
whoa but so he loved so lincoln loved
43:49
amazing loved frontier humor because
43:52
everyone loved frontier humor but it
43:53
wasn't
43:54
something that people bragged about when
43:56
lincoln was campaigning against
43:57
opponents they always tried to portray
43:59
him
43:59
as someone who enjoyed jokes so the
44:02
image of like
44:03
lincoln as a frontiersman which became
44:05
its own genre of comedy
44:06
was actually something he spent so much
44:08
of his life trying to get away from like
44:10
a frontier comedy
44:11
thing was something that lincoln really
44:13
hated his entire life
44:15
because it was a real political stab at
44:17
him but like
44:19
he had the misfortune he said of being
44:20
part of this like cultural
44:22
phase of like corny comedy literally
44:24
coming from
44:25
the word corn and came from like this
44:27
idea of people who liked these jokes as
44:29
corn fed
44:30
really pics yeah and so and so uh yeah
44:33
comedy fads throughout
44:35
history are like very versatile yeah
44:36
really interesting and just back on to
44:39
night was he called night hot night
44:40
heart yeah yeah so um
44:42
he was basically the biggest poet of his
44:45
age
44:46
before that there was a lot of poetry
44:48
and a lot of stories
44:49
about uh knights and and stuff like that
44:51
but he was the first one who
44:53
talked about villagers and that's why he
44:55
had all this kind of um scatological
44:57
humor
44:57
is the scatological element the smell is
44:59
that a big part of the comedy
45:01
it was a big part of their lives yeah
45:03
but farts have always been funny as well
45:05
you look back through over the centuries
45:07
people are always making fart jokes
45:09
there was a really cool um series of
45:12
japanese scrolls that were discovered
45:15
about
45:16
20 years ago i think and they're from
45:18
the 17th
45:19
19th century from the edo period and
45:21
they are just literally picture after
45:22
picture of people having fart battles
45:24
and no one knows why but
45:26
people drop their trousers and they're
45:27
blasting these massive farts at each
45:29
other and it shows the fast knocking
45:31
people over and
45:32
uprooting trees it shows someone sitting
45:35
cross-legged on the top of two massive
45:37
farts being cast up at him
45:39
it's bizarre we don't know why we think
45:41
that it's probably metaphorical as
45:42
opposed to they had incredible nobody
45:46
knows
45:50

[Music]
01:35
hello and welcome to another episode of
01:38
no such thing as a fish
01:40
a weekly podcast coming to you from 2020
01:43
audio
01:44
my name is dan schreiber and i am
01:45
sitting here with andrew hunter murray
01:47
james harkin and anna chazinski and once
01:50
again we have gathered around the
01:51
microphones with our four
01:52
favorite facts from the last seven days
01:55
and in no particular order
01:56
here we go sorry dan can i ask you who
01:59
2020 audio is
02:00
yes came out of nowhere a little bit
02:02
yeah sorry about that 2020 audio is
02:04
where we are recording the audio book
02:06
for our
02:06
book of the year which will be entitled
02:08
audio book of the year
02:10
and uh we are in the very booth that it
02:12
has been recorded
02:14
the very booth the honor of being in the
02:17
same booth
02:18
as the no such thing as a fish team were
02:20
when they recorded their audio book not
02:22
one hour ago
02:24
they're authors we're mere podcasters
02:27
such an honor
02:28
okay starting with fact number one and
02:31
that is
02:32
andy my fact is that there are whales
02:34
alive today who were alive
02:36
before moby dick was written
02:40
wow what does that mean so that book was
02:43
written about a real whale wasn't it
02:45
yes so might that well still be alive no
02:50
so it's because there are different
02:52
kinds of whales
02:53
there are particular whales which do
02:55
live for at least 200 years we know that
02:57
but they're bow head whales and i think
02:59
the whale of moby dick was a sperm whale
03:00
yeah yeah so i don't know how long those
03:03
sperm was are actually
03:04
it's possible well there's there's a
03:06
bowhead sorry you said bowhead whales
03:07
yeah so bowhead whales
03:09
are uh they've got a life expectancy
03:11
that can actually go up to 250 years
03:15
um so that would mean that not only
03:19
were they live longer than let's say the
03:22
book itself moby dick was written but
03:24
potentially there's one that's alive
03:26
that was born the year that
03:27
herman melville the author of moby dick
03:29
was born oh wow
03:30
yeah he wrote the book at 32 years old
03:33
wow and it was in 1851
03:34
you should say so here's another thing
03:36
the first new england whalers
03:38
so the first people from north america
03:40
who were wailing around there
03:42
they started in 1791 and that was 227
03:45
years ago
03:46
so there might be some whales alive who
03:48
remember a time before wailing
03:50
in that area of the world wow oh my god
03:52
the time when they were free
03:54
roaming the waters with no fear well
03:57
this is so there was this massive bout
03:58
of whaling um
03:59
in the arctic especially between 1848
04:01
and 1915. so the bowhead whales in the
04:03
arctic
04:04
all but about i think 1200 of them were
04:07
killed 30 years ago they're only about
04:08
1200 left
04:09
so it's not like we have an individual
04:11
we could definitely point to that whale
04:12
and say
04:13
that one was alive before maybe dig but
04:15
they did find one
04:17
um recently which had a harpoon in it
04:20
and they tested the age of the harpoon
04:23
and they found it had only been
04:24
manufactured between 1879 and 1885 that
04:27
specific
04:28
harpoon so the whale was probably
04:30
harpooned sometime
04:31
from 1885 to 95. or it could be someone
04:33
who just likes old harpoons
04:35
yeah like a modern day guy yeah you know
04:38
he's just using really old materials
04:39
could have been hopping three years ago
04:41
with an ancient harpoon
04:42
off ebay yeah but they they reckon that
04:45
that one that they found the harpoon and
04:46
was 211 years old so that's
04:49
yes so basically these bowhead whales in
04:51
particular are very very old
04:52
and it's one of the best ways to date
04:54
them sometimes is when the harpoons came
04:55
from because they're often found with
04:56
harpoons
04:57
in them embedded in their blubber aren't
04:59
they um
05:01
but we should say with bowhead whales
05:02
you were saying there were only about
05:03
1200 left that was about 30
05:06
30 years ago and today there are 14 000
05:08
some good will news
05:10
so that actually conservation's really
05:12
worked wow um
05:13
but yeah people used to harpoon a lot
05:15
but whales can survive a huge amount of
05:16
harpooning
05:18
um so in fact the whale that moby dick
05:20
was based on was
05:21
a real-life whale called mocha dick you
05:24
can see heaven melville really used his
05:25
imagination when he
05:27
switched names there and mocha dick was
05:29
a super famous whale in the 1830s to
05:31
sort of terrorize boaters
05:33
and it would swim really calmly next to
05:35
whaling boats but then at the first sign
05:37
of aggression from the boat it would
05:38
like attack the boat and tip people out
05:40
and when it finally died in 1839 it had
05:43
19 harpoons lodged on its side
05:45
various bits of harpoon 19 yeah wow
05:48
because they get stuck in the blubber
05:49
don't they
05:50
yeah and maka dick was a sperm whale i
05:52
think but the bowhead whales they have
05:54
more blubber than
05:55
anyone they have up to half a meter
05:58
thick of blubber wow that is a lot i
06:02
think
06:02
that's your sort of body shape i mean
06:04
the older
06:06
well they're really weird animals aren't
06:08
they because they've got um
06:10
they've got a skull which is up to 40 of
06:12
their body length
06:14
so the skull alone could be over five
06:16
meters long and
06:17
the the really weird thing about them is
06:19
that they have the largest mouth of
06:21
any living animal but they have no teeth
06:24
like large in terms of depth breath pink
06:27
volumes
06:28
yeah so it's larger than a blue whale's
06:30
mouth even though the bowhead is
06:31
slightly smaller it's got such a massive
06:33
head
06:34
that i read this fact about um blue
06:36
whales which i guess must be true about
06:38
bowhead whales if it's true about blue
06:40
whales which it might not be
06:41
but it is that the amount of water that
06:44
a blue whale can fit in its mouth
06:45
is heavier than a blue whale itself what
06:49
oh really yeah that's plausible actually
06:51
isn't it because
06:52
yeah are you going to say are you going
06:54
to say why don't they sink
06:55
no i wasn't i was going to say do they
06:59
expand to
06:59
a double blue whale size like a puffer
07:02
fish no it's about different densities
07:03
so i guess water's more dense
07:05
yeah than blubber especially because
07:08
blood is quite bland isn't it
07:09
yeah that's why women i think are often
07:11
better
07:13
at floating this is actually only my
07:15
subjective experience
07:16
but i find it quite easy to swim and i'm
07:19
often swimming with men who sink more
07:20
easily and i think it's because women
07:21
actually have a bit more
07:22
regularly harpooned on the downside
07:24
aren't you i've got 14 harpoons impaled
07:27
in my sight at this moment
07:30
i should just sorry just one more thing
07:31
i learned about harpoons that i didn't
07:33
know
07:33
um which i found out from that one that
07:36
was discovered that was 130 years old
07:38
they had explosives in them which i
07:40
didn't realize they did so they
07:41
harpooned them and they were tined
07:42
explosive this is in the mid
07:44
19th century timed explosive so they
07:46
went inside and then they were timed to
07:47
explode once in there
07:48
that's interesting because generally
07:50
speaking um whalers would not
07:53
they didn't use harpoons to kill whales
07:55
did they that's you kill a whale with a
07:57
lance or with a club or something like
07:58
that
07:59
you use your harpoon to kind of catch it
08:01
and then it kind of drags you along
08:03
until it gets tired and then once it's
08:04
tired you can kind of kill it with
08:06
something else
08:06
i see um the bowhead whales they
08:10
have we said before that they have giant
08:12
penises in their heads
08:14
what i'm not well the sort of very
08:17
penis equivalent thing they have this
08:18
massive ridge of tissue and it's called
08:20
the corpus cavernosum maxillaris
08:22
now any latin or penis fans might
08:25
remember that there is a thing in the
08:26
human penis called the corpus cavernosum
08:29
and that's the thing which fills with
08:30
blood those are the chambers which fill
08:31
up and they do the same thing in the
08:33
whale but they're to cool the whale down
08:35
so when the whale is swimming around and
08:38
is getting really active
08:39
there's a real risk that they'll
08:40
overheat because they've got so much
08:41
blubber that they they can get really
08:42
hot really easily
08:44
so they engorge this corpus cavernosum
08:46
maxillaris which means in the head
08:48
uh with blood and then it opens its
08:50
mouth cold sea water flows in cools the
08:51
blood
08:52
flows back out so it's their way of
08:54
cooling themselves down using this giant
08:55
head penis
08:56
that's with they need to cool themselves
08:58
down because they are found in cool
09:00
water which is one of the reasons for
09:02
their
09:02
right uh longevity isn't it yeah but
09:04
they're constantly wearing a really
09:05
thick coat basically
09:06
good
09:10
it is a bit like having a big coat all
09:12
the time
09:13
on a cold day but then whenever you want
09:15
to cool down
09:16
getting an erection and pouring cold
09:19
water
09:20
into your pants that's effectively what
09:22
we're saying isn't it yeah
09:24
it doesn't sound like a crazy way of
09:25
cooling down
09:27
i think people would call you crazy if
09:28
you started doing that yeah
09:30
not on the bus
09:31
[Laughter]
09:34
oh i actually have a coat fact related
09:36
to whales
09:38
yeah this i love this some of the
09:39
earliest waterproof jackets were made
09:41
from whale intestines
09:43
and it was the inuits who used to wear
09:45
them because they are really waterproof
09:46
obviously because intestines are full of
09:48
water
09:48
bodily water but very permeable because
09:51
the nutrients have to permeate through
09:53
them
09:53
and so yeah they would uh they would
09:55
turn them into waterproof jackets it's
09:56
amazing i don't really know what an
09:57
intestine looks like but i imagine it's
09:59
a bit like a puffer jacket
10:01
because it's gonna have lots of folds in
10:03
it you're right
10:04
all the folds but wouldn't so what would
10:06
they do to preserve it so it doesn't rot
10:09
oh i guess they're keeping on ice most
10:11
of the time anyway yeah
10:12
that's a good point that's a good point
10:14
if you dry it out i guess
10:15
you don't know that oh that's true we
10:16
wear leather clothes sometimes
10:18
yeah yeah yeah just cure it yeah cure it
10:21
with urine for instance if you get um if
10:23
you get cow
10:23
um hide and then you put a load of urine
10:26
on it for ages and ages and ages it'll
10:27
get cured and it won't go rotten
10:29
this is very weird i have another whale
10:31
based clothing fact which i didn't even
10:32
realize
10:33
and it's about moby dick too so there's
10:35
a whole chapter in moby dick on the
10:37
whale's penis
10:38
and it's called the cassock it's pretty
10:41
gruesome
10:42
reading but they the men the whalers
10:44
they cut off a whale's penis
10:46
they skin it and then they turn the skin
10:48
into a sleeveless robe kind of like a
10:50
onesie
10:51
oh cool yeah for and for it's
10:54
it's specifically for a man called the
10:56
mincer and his job is to chop blubber
10:58
and and keep cooking it in the pot isn't
11:01
it true that
11:02
someone had a yacht i wouldn't say
11:04
jackie onassis was it was onassis the
11:06
husband
11:07
oh is it aristotle aristotle uh and
11:10
well i think you're gonna know this fact
11:11
dan if you say that but did they have um
11:13
a chair which was
11:15
had whale penis as the yeah it was the
11:18
skin of the chair was a whale penis i
11:20
believe
11:20
upholstered in it yeah
11:24
who thought first of pissing on a
11:26
cowhide to
11:28
cure it what unknown genius they they
11:31
used piss for a lot of things didn't
11:32
they
11:33
yeah they tried everything we on
11:36
everything see what sticks
11:39
mostly it's not useful it's always just
11:41
one person in the village going
11:42
have you pissed on it just for
11:44
everything every new thing being tested
11:47
my uh my iphone's stopped working
11:51
um i wonder though if the penis bit in
11:54
moby dick
11:55
stayed in the british version because
11:57
the one that was printed in britain was
11:58
massively changed wasn't it
12:00
which caused serious problems so when it
12:02
was published i think was actually
12:03
published in the uk
12:04
maybe just before america because of a
12:06
weird copywriting quirk
12:08
that um they wanted to avoid piracy yeah
12:11
exactly
12:12
um but it was printed in the uk first
12:15
but the uk publishers were kind of a
12:18
combination of really careless and
12:19
really prudish
12:20
they cut huge tracks of it out and also
12:22
they cut out the epilogue
12:24
and i should say if you haven't read
12:25
moby dick and you don't want a spoiler
12:27
then
12:27
fast forward like the next 15 seconds of
12:29
this but
12:31
oh i'm putting my hands on my ears but
12:33
i've got cans on
12:34
it's just going to make the sound more
12:35
intense yeah and also
12:37
uh when james says cans he doesn't mean
12:39
actual cans on his head
12:40
he's wearing headphones are you wearing
12:42
the southern french city of canada
12:45
anyone who tuned out will be tuning back
12:46
in right around now
12:49
go away for five minutes and then come
12:51
back
12:53
disappear go make a cup of tea um
12:56
basically
12:56
the epilogue is a crucial part of moby
12:58
dick because it's narrated by
12:59
famously by ishmael hence call me
13:01
ishmael being that famous line
13:03
but uh at the sort of apparent end of
13:06
moby dick then the ship goes down
13:07
everyone dies it's only in the epilogue
13:10
that it's explained that ishmael has
13:11
survived
13:12
so that was cut out and it got terrible
13:14
reviews in britain because all the
13:15
reviewers said
13:16
well it doesn't make any sense how the
13:17
hell is this story being narrated by
13:19
someone who clearly died at the end of
13:20
the book
13:21
yeah the ghost of ishmael yeah the
13:24
reviews were so
13:24
bad so i read about a few of them um
13:28
one review in the boston post said we
13:30
have read nearly one half of this book
13:33
and are satisfied that the london
13:34
athenaeum is right in calling it an
13:36
ill-compounded mixture of romance and
13:38
matter effect
13:39
and the spectator said nothing should be
13:41
introduced into a novel which
13:42
it is physically impossible for the
13:43
writer to have known thus he must not
13:45
describe the conversation of miners in a
13:47
pit if they all perish
13:48
so that was exactly that problem yeah
13:51
yeah and it killed his career
13:52
yeah he had a terrible uh career as an
13:55
author for someone who's
13:56
a household name it sold 315 copies
13:59
and he then just gave up but actually it
14:01
didn't become popular i think until
14:03
relatively recently is that right i
14:05
think it was the 1950s because the
14:08
british
14:08
flawed edition remained the most
14:10
commonly read one for so long
14:12
and it was only when like the seminal
14:14
text was published and i think the 50s
14:15
that people suddenly went oh this is
14:16
quite good now that it makes sense
14:18
yeah and his other stuff sounds really
14:20
interesting he wrote a book called the
14:21
confidence man
14:22
and it's a book which is all about a con
14:24
man
14:25
who fools people it's set on one single
14:28
day and i think it's
14:29
known to be the first book ever to just
14:31
be set in a single day
14:33
um and that day happens to be april
14:35
fool's day because he's conning someone
14:37
and the book itself was released on
14:39
april fool's day
14:40
to tie in with that just one other thing
14:42
as well that herman melville
14:44
in what he's written is he wrote what is
14:46
said to be the longest
14:47
poem in american literature it's almost
14:50
18
14:51
000 lines are you going to read it for
14:52
us now if you want to fast forward at
14:56
home
14:58
uh what's it about um it's a poem and
15:01
pilgrimage in the holy land
15:02
uh okay yeah yeah sounds great
15:06
uh on very old things this was in the
15:09
news this year i'm not sure if it's true
15:11
but it has been claimed that some
15:13
russian scientists
15:14
have found an extinct lion cub
15:17
underneath the snow in siberia
15:19
and inside that lion cub they found two
15:21
nematode worms
15:22
which must be at least 40 000 years old
15:25
and they brought them back to life
15:28
so there are two 40 000 year old worms
15:31
currently living
15:32
in russia they came over to salisbury
15:34
for two days
15:37
i mean isn't that amazing that is
15:38
amazing so they were um
15:40
sorry what so how did they bring them
15:42
back to life 40 000 years ago
15:44
yeah these worms were just happily
15:46
living inside a rectum of a
15:48
lion yeah and then the lion died and
15:50
then it got frozen
15:52
and then they just kind of went into
15:54
almost like a hibernation kind of thing
15:55
and when they defrosted them
15:57
40 000 years later they just kind of
16:00
yawned and woke up and they're alive
16:02
again the austin powers of the world
16:05
they're going to get none other cultural
16:07
references it's so difficult bringing
16:08
them up to speed
16:10
it would be interesting i know we'll
16:12
never know but to put a modern day
16:14
of a species worm next to it and just
16:16
see if they
16:17
chat just to know if that's if they get
16:20
on like i would love to know how much
16:21
has happened in the worm world
16:23
there would be enough of a difference in
16:25
their conversation i'd love to know
16:27
what you think you would say
16:30
because i'm telling you it'll be nothing
16:33
they're just going to sit next to each
16:35
other for a bit
16:36
i wonder if they'd have sex with each
16:37
other oh yeah because
16:39
there's an age difference isn't there
16:40
and then there's a 40 000 year age
16:42
difference
16:44
well do you know a very big age
16:46
difference i found in nature actually
16:48
is that between the world's oldest
16:50
tortoise so tortoise is another animal
16:51
that lives a long time
16:53
and the oldest living one is jonathan
16:55
he's 186 years old
16:57
and the girl that he's been trying to
16:59
get off with is only
17:00
26. he's been trying to get off with her
17:02
since 1991.
17:04
the problem he might have been having is
17:06
that they discovered last year
17:08
frederica is actually most probably a
17:10
male
17:12
oh sorry you say you said girl i thought
17:14
you meant a human woman that he
17:16
was sort of infatuated with as a
17:17
tortoise
17:19
you're a female tortoise a girl taught
17:20
us yes yeah
17:22
turns out he's just been trying to mount
17:23
another man make babies
17:25
which is fine of course it's totally
17:27
fine it just weren't my babies
17:28
no and also if you're 170 odd years old
17:31
you're probably quite
17:32
right-wing in your opinions
17:36
you think he's most certainly homophobic
17:38
i just say
17:40
at that age i think people do get a bit
17:42
like that don't they
17:43
i don't i think tortoises is more
17:44
open-minded i can't believe i was
17:46
getting [ __ ] for talking about what
17:48
worms would say to each other
17:52
tortoises are more open-minded
18:01
okay it is time for fact number two and
18:03
that is my fact
18:04
my fact this week is that the european
18:06
space agency has a sound system
18:08
so loud that if you heard it it would
18:10
kill you
18:12
your head would explode is probably not
18:15
what would happen
18:18
um this is claimed by the esa they've
18:21
said
18:21
that they have this this uh big sound
18:24
system well they definitely do have the
18:25
sound system
18:26
definitely yes they have the sound
18:27
system it's in the netherlands and it's
18:29
the esa's large european
18:31
acoustic facility otherwise known as
18:33
leaf it's 16.4 meters tall
18:36
it's uh 11 meters wide 9 meters deep and
18:38
it uses nitrogen gas
18:40
in order to make the sounds and what
18:42
they use it for is to test
18:44
rockets they they smash sound into
18:46
rockets to simulate what it might be
18:48
like for when a rocket is
18:50
exiting or re-entering earth so what
18:52
they've said is that if you were in this
18:54
room
18:54
and they closed their door and this was
18:56
put on um that it could
18:58
kill you um that's a bit disputed by
19:01
i think every site i've read that talks
19:04
about it we're not sure that it could do
19:06
that it only gets up to i believe 154
19:08
decibels
19:09
most scientists believe that 154
19:11
decibels probably will burst your
19:13
eardrums it will cause pain but it won't
19:15
explode your head
19:16
in the way that perhaps they're
19:18
suggesting but it won't be pleasant
19:20
it won't be pleasant especially it
19:21
depends what kind of music it is as well
19:23
don't forget yeah how do we know what
19:24
kind of music they play to the rockets
19:25
well i read metal i read no it's it's
19:28
just sound
19:29
uh unfortunately as in sorry granddad
19:33
no it's just sound you and jonathan the
19:36
tool just saying
19:39
well one guy who was interviewed about
19:40
it who works there says that they do
19:42
you know you plug an ipod in and he
19:44
would love to play rock music whatever
19:46
but actually it's just
19:47
a bunch of noise and so basically with
19:50
what sound waves are
19:51
is it's um molecules in the air and
19:54
they're kind of getting closer together
19:55
and further apart closer together and
19:57
further apart so it's a change in
19:58
pressure
19:59
so if you make a sound loud enough
20:00
there'll be a big enough change in
20:02
pressure that it would definitely kill
20:03
you
20:04
in my opinion wow i'm pretty sure it
20:05
would like it would probably explode
20:07
your lungs
20:08
but i don't see any reason why it
20:09
couldn't explode your head as well wow
20:11
i think sound waves become a shock wave
20:13
basically at a certain
20:14
point effectively don't they about 190
20:18
um where is then like the you know the
20:20
shock wave that makes a big
20:22
sonic boom um but yeah
20:25
they apparently also it doesn't have to
20:26
be sounds that you can hear so there's
20:28
infrasound
20:29
which is sounds that are out of the
20:31
range of human
20:32
hearing frequencies and people have
20:35
found that if you expose humans to
20:37
infrasounds they're over 100 decibels
20:39
they have blood pressure and respiratory
20:41
rate changes that they can't control
20:42
they just feel their breathing changing
20:44
and if you take the decibel level high
20:46
enough even though they can't even hear
20:48
the sound
20:49
their lungs will deflate and inflate so
20:51
it can be used as a means of like
20:52
artificial respiration
20:53
if you play this inaudible sound it's
20:57
amazing
20:58
yeah so any of these things loudness is
21:00
basically
21:01
how big the amplitude and whatever is so
21:03
it could be really really really really
21:05
loud but you still can't hear it because
21:07
it's below
21:08
say 60 hertz yeah right and that to me
21:10
that's just blows my mind a little bit
21:12
because
21:12
how something can be really loud but you
21:14
can't hear it that just doesn't make any
21:16
sense
21:16
it's astonishing i don't like it because
21:18
it can affect you who knows what sounds
21:20
we're being played right now that are
21:21
screwing with our brains
21:22
no well that's what they thought didn't
21:23
they in the american embassy in
21:26
cuba was yeah um so everyone was feeling
21:28
sick
21:29
and they thought maybe there's some
21:30
infrasound kind of weapon they were
21:32
using i think
21:32
probably we think that isn't true right
21:34
but i don't think it could work in
21:35
theory they've not decided one way or
21:37
the other or they certainly haven't said
21:38
if they have
21:39
um so loud noise also causes heart
21:41
disease
21:42
really yeah so it's really strange it
21:45
induces a stress response it disrupts
21:47
your body
21:48
at a cellular level and it induces a
21:51
kind of fight or flight
21:52
response so when the stress hormones
21:54
increase that can lead to vascular
21:56
damage
21:57
and this happens even if you're asleep a
22:00
loud noise will
22:01
increase your blood pressure wow so it's
22:04
kind of the same even if you're not
22:05
hearing it consciously
22:06
yeah it doesn't affect the body yeah
22:08
does that explain why every time i've
22:10
ever walked into a club
22:12
i immediately want to run away as fast
22:15
that will be
22:16
possible did you know scientists have
22:17
only just discovered why [ __ ] don't
22:19
deafen themselves
22:21
cockrells rules cockrules let's call
22:23
them roosters
22:24
so roosters crow at over 100 decibels
22:27
which is
22:28
extremely loud it's the same as running
22:29
a chainsaw right next to your ear
22:31
and we didn't know why they don't just
22:32
go deaf why the eardrums don't explode
22:34
and they've looked into them and there
22:35
are a couple of reasons so they've got
22:36
an eardrum that's surrounded by nice
22:38
soft squishy tissue
22:39
but also when they tilt their head back
22:42
to start crowing
22:43
then they've got this little flap of
22:44
material which drops down and covers
22:46
their ear canal completely so they've
22:48
got their own built-in ear plug
22:50
do you remember those um dolls that
22:52
could that you would get as a kid
22:53
and as you sat it up the eyes open and
22:55
the way you lay down yes
22:56
the same thing yeah it's exactly the
22:58
same thing technology yeah
23:01
wow that is amazing it's cool it's like
23:03
being able to stick your fingers in your
23:04
ears
23:05
if you don't have fingers like having a
23:08
finger inside your ear
23:10
yes that you could just kind of maneuver
23:12
it inside the ear and stick it in the
23:14
little
23:14
canal it's exactly like that hey uh you
23:16
know that song rock and roll ain't noise
23:18
pollution by ac dc
23:20
no there's track 10 on back in black
23:22
it's one of the it's one of their more
23:23
famous
23:23
songs it's very good one sing it for us
23:25
give us the ring no no no no no no no no
23:26
no
23:26
we're not allowed to know the legal
23:28
reasons
23:31
the lyrics are rock and roll it knows
23:33
pollution okay it goes on
23:34
um there's a group from mississippi
23:36
state university who recently tested
23:38
whether or not rock and roll is or ain't
23:41
noise pollution
23:42
to aphids no sorry
23:46
to beatles to the beatles they played
23:48
rock two beatles um
23:50
there's a beatle called lady beetles
23:52
they live in fields and they prey on
23:53
aphids
23:54
and the scientists played ac dc at them
23:56
quite loud
23:58
um along with some other music and they
24:00
found that when it was country and folk
24:01
music
24:02
the beatles didn't mind but when it was
24:04
ac dc
24:06
uh specifically back in black the number
24:08
of aphids they caught was cut in half
24:11
and the aphid population rocketed and
24:13
then the plants in the field were 25
24:15
smaller so it has a big impact on
24:17
farming basically
24:18
so they have concluded they said as fans
24:21
of ac dc
24:22
we sadly must disagree with the band and
24:24
conclude that rock and roll is noise
24:25
pollution
24:27
for beetles it's so weird i find that so
24:30
weird do you why do you think that
24:31
because i think ac dc is um melodic
24:35
as much as so we're about to get into
24:37
the argument about whether it's metal or
24:39
rock no i just i just find i do find
24:42
that a bit
24:43
we don't know what's making them
24:44
stopping eating the aphids it might be
24:46
that they're enjoying the music so much
24:48
they're just kind of bopping around and
24:50
they don't have time to do that yeah or
24:52
they've gone off to buy the cd or
24:53
something
24:55
that's that's possible just speaking of
24:57
um music
24:58
metal metallica this year has
25:01
released a whiskey so they're a great
25:04
like growing a number of bands that are
25:06
releasing their own alcohols
25:07
they've gone for whiskey but the way
25:09
that they are distilling
25:11
the whiskey the distilling process is
25:12
they are playing heavy metal
25:14
to the whiskey right it's very cool so
25:17
it's a process that then they're calling
25:19
black noise
25:20
uh and the idea is it's shaping the
25:22
whiskey's flavor so
25:23
they play metallica's music through a
25:26
subwoofer
25:27
and uh they disrupt the whiskey inside
25:29
the barrel so it's sort of just getting
25:31
mixed up and mixed up and it's a
25:32
molecular level of infusion going on
25:35
yeah what
25:35
is absolute [ __ ]
25:39
they do this all the time to whiskies
25:40
don't they there's always like i'll do
25:42
what's been at the bottom of the sea
25:44
this one's been in space this one is
25:46
like can they not just make nice whiskey
25:48
that people want to buy it's
25:49
it's got listen i'm getting this from a
25:51
very very good source this is the press
25:53
release released by the band
25:56
and yeah it uh it's uh increased wood
25:59
interaction that kicks up the wood
26:01
flavor characteristics
26:02
in the whiskey i don't know what that
26:03
means i don't know where the wood bit
26:04
came in the book comes with
26:05
the barrel yes for the barrels the whole
26:08
point is that the wood you use in the
26:09
barrel sort of
26:10
reacts with the spirit that's where the
26:12
taste comes from yeah whiskey
26:14
the barrels as in they put tasteless
26:17
alcohol in there
26:18
and then it's in the barrels for 25
26:19
years and then it seeps in all the
26:21
flavor from the wood and that's where
26:22
the whiskey is
26:24
25 years for you is it some of us just
26:27
have six week whiskers
26:30
and anna just gives it a quick tip
26:33
out into the glass dips are twigged
26:39
[Music]
26:43
okay it's time for fact number three and
26:46
that is
26:46
james okay my fact this week is that
26:49
south korean teachers are banned from
26:51
drinking coffee
26:52
at school poor teachers
26:55
i would say that is one of the best
26:57
things about being a teacher that you
26:58
can drink lots of coffee all the time
26:59
isn't it
27:00
sad that you help nurture young minds
27:02
and all that kind of stuff
27:04
but yeah this is the thing that's
27:05
happening in south korea um
27:07
basically they've been banning energy
27:10
drinks
27:11
in the schools quite a while because
27:13
it's happening all over the world
27:14
actually even in
27:15
um in england we're going to ban energy
27:17
drinks to kids aren't we yeah
27:18
under 18 um but this they've gone one
27:21
further in south korea and they say no
27:23
coffee
27:23
for children no caffeine for children
27:25
but not even that no caffeine for adults
27:27
as well
27:28
and the idea i think is you just have
27:30
none of it on um campus at all so no one
27:32
could possibly get at it
27:34
but it's not like i mean i remember from
27:36
when i was at school it's not like we
27:37
would try and sneak into the staff room
27:40
to get some of that sweet sweet nest
27:42
cafe no to go behind the bike sheds and
27:44
just have a little espresso
27:49
um and this is the idea that it's bad
27:51
for your health which yes
27:52
mostly people think although this new
27:56
study has come out and i know studies
27:57
are always coming out swinging one way
27:58
or the other but this one's a really
28:00
huge one it's done by the national
28:02
cancer institute and the national
28:03
institutes of health
28:04
it's one of the largest studies of its
28:06
kind it's been going for 10 years
28:08
and it's found that drinking seven cups
28:10
of coffee every day
28:12
is the healthiest number of cups of
28:13
coffee you can
28:20
well there you go you're the healthiest
28:22
it followed 500 000 people over a
28:24
10-year period and then looked at who
28:26
had died
28:26
at the end of it and it found that you
28:28
reduce your chance of death
28:30
by 14 if you're drinking eight plus cups
28:32
of coffee
28:33
and by 16 if you drink seven cups of
28:36
coffee a day
28:36
is it the caffeine that's the good
28:38
ingredient or is it coffee in general as
28:40
in
28:41
if if someone were to drink
28:42
decaffeinated coffee all the time
28:44
because they couldn't hack the pace of
28:45
normal coffee would they still be
28:47
healthy
28:48
andy there's no hope for you
28:51
no they don't know because it's just a
28:52
statistical study it's not a biological
28:54
study as well because they've just
28:55
looked at the
28:56
who's dead right but they've adjusted
28:58
for other factors as in it could be
29:00
you know i'm sure they i'm sure they've
29:02
done all the stuff that scientists are
29:03
meant to do like
29:03
trust me for other mitigating factors
29:05
one would hope
29:08
um south korean schools aren't the only
29:09
place to ban coffee bit of a history um
29:12
all of sweden did in 1746 wow
29:16
yeah this was very interesting they
29:17
banned coffee and it was banned by king
29:19
gustav iii
29:21
and it was banned because they just
29:23
thought that it was very bad for your
29:24
health so what he wanted to do was ban
29:26
it and then experiment on it to see
29:28
whether or not he was right in his
29:30
belief or whether or not his advisors
29:31
who told them that
29:32
were writing their beliefs so what they
29:33
did was they started giving it to
29:34
convicted criminals
29:36
um to test to see whether if they drunk
29:39
coffee
29:39
all day every day or at least you know
29:41
and they all they all ended up being
29:42
beheaded so it was concluded
29:45
very bad for you well here's here's the
29:47
thing
29:48
the king ordered an experiment to be
29:50
done on two identical twins they were
29:51
both on death row
29:52
but they were both um put just for life
29:55
imprisonment if they went
29:56
and did this because they wanted to see
29:57
how long it could last so one was given
29:59
coffee every day and the other one was
30:01
given tea
30:02
and unfortunately gustav gustav iii died
30:04
before the experiment
30:05
finished he was having energy drinks
30:08
every day wasn't he yes
30:09
exactly yeah um so he um no he was
30:12
assassinated uh in 1792.
30:14
sorry i'm sorry guys too soon too soon
30:18
um but yeah um we uh we don't fully know
30:20
what happened well no the
30:22
the really great thing was that so the
30:24
two two doctors were
30:25
assigned to study the patients one
30:27
doctor each um but both the doctors
30:30
and king gustav all died before either
30:32
the tea drinker or the coffee drinker
30:33
yeah
30:34
great yeah suppose i've read an account
30:36
saying that the tea drinker died first
30:37
and then
30:38
the solitary coffee drinker who was
30:40
meant to be living this unhealthy
30:41
lifestyle drinking coffee
30:42
lived uh longest of all of them i think
30:44
there is a question that it's uh
30:46
apocryphal tale though i mean it sounds
30:48
so neat yeah yeah i found somewhere else
30:50
where it was banned
30:51
this is in the ottoman empire so there
30:54
were lots
30:54
so it basically originated for the first
30:58
time in
30:58
yemen in the 15th century as in grinding
31:00
the beans mixing with liquid
31:02
there have been various other attempts
31:03
to use caffeine beans before that
31:06
uh but yemen is or modern day yemen i
31:08
guess is where it first appeared
31:11
really is he from yemen yeah he is he
31:14
was born there wasn't he
31:14
yeah well um
31:18
i thought that might go somewhere he
31:21
then moved to bex hill on c
31:23
which is where comedians like milligan
31:25
was stationed
31:26
during the early bit of the second world
31:29
war where is that
31:31
is just near it's on the coast it's sort
31:33
of you can see france in the distance
31:35
oh and the south coast yeah there's some
31:36
really nice towns
31:38
i've got some stuff here thank you about
31:40
yemen
31:41
where it is our toronto
31:45
um so basically it was it became really
31:48
popular because it was very delicious
31:49
but also um it was seen as quite
31:53
dangerous quite political
31:54
because you'd have a coffee house which
31:56
is where people meet and they can
31:57
discuss and they can discuss politics
31:59
so it's not like uh meeting at a mosque
32:01
where things are a bit more policed and
32:03
you're only there for religious purposes
32:05
so it's a it's a secular space and also
32:08
the coffee was brewed for 20 minutes and
32:09
it was served very very hot so you could
32:11
only drink it in tiny sips
32:12
so you kind of have to chat so the
32:15
ottoman sultan in 1633
32:17
cracked down on it and this is
32:19
supposedly true that he walked around
32:21
istanbul in disguise
32:22
with a big sword ready to behead anybody
32:24
he found drinking coffee
32:26
is that right well this is the story and
32:28
again it may well be apocryphal i love
32:30
the detail of a big sword
32:33
yeah he wasn't turning no fruit knife
32:35
around no way
32:37
uh it was banned by frederick the great
32:39
is it
32:40
yeah 1781 uh because he thought the
32:43
people should be
32:44
taking beer instead of beer gruel
32:46
instead of coffee oh yeah
32:48
uh he thought it was a bit of a luxury
32:49
beer grew beer grill would be like the
32:52
porridgey stuff that you get at the
32:53
bottom when you've been brewing beer
32:56
and he was brought up on that and he
32:57
thought other people should be having
32:59
that they shouldn't be having this
33:00
luxurious um
33:01
stuff from yemen but he actually did
33:04
himself have coffee
33:05
although the difference was he boiled
33:06
his with instead of water champagne
33:09
wow the best way to have it would that
33:12
be nice
33:13
would it yeah i think after the fourth
33:16
or fifth cup you start to enjoy
33:25
okay it is time for our final fact of
33:28
the show
33:28
and that is chozinski my fact this week
33:32
is that facial recognition technology
33:34
for chickens
33:35
allows you to pre-order a specific
33:37
chicken and watch it grow on the farm
33:39
before it ends up on your plate
33:42
it's actually quite nice this is a
33:44
technology that's just being patented
33:46
and developed in china
33:48
and it's to make sure that your chicken
33:49
is totally free range
33:51
and they've developed really advanced
33:52
facial recognition technology for
33:53
chickens which is about you know late
33:55
90s percent
33:56
accuracy and so you pre-order your
33:59
chicken
34:00
and then i guess four to six months
34:01
later once it's
34:03
waddled about on its nice free-range
34:04
farm for a while and you've been able to
34:06
check it every once in a while
34:07
then um you get to eat it you check in
34:09
on it check
34:10
check check
34:13
but yeah facial recognition is gonna be
34:16
everywhere isn't it
34:17
well the technology seems yeah really
34:19
advanced in some areas and really crap
34:20
in others
34:21
for instance there was the trial at the
34:24
2017 champions league final in cardiff
34:26
where it was revealed that it wrongly
34:28
identified more than 2 000 people
34:30
so the technology flagged up 2407
34:34
people as potential criminals by
34:35
comparing them to a database of
34:37
potential criminals
34:38
it turned out 2297 of those flags were
34:41
false positives
34:43
still some positives though some
34:44
positives i think the met police at the
34:46
moment have a 98
34:48
false positive rate for their facial
34:50
recognition technology
34:52
no but those are the south wales police
34:54
they've been improving that technology
34:55
since the champions league final i think
34:57
they
34:57
switched to a new algorithm and at a
35:00
recent event they only got
35:01
10 false positives which was 0.02
35:04
of the total number of matches i'm
35:06
skeptical so i went to an exhibition
35:08
last night at somerset house it's really
35:10
good uh it's basically
35:12
a massive design exhibition that's taken
35:14
over the whole thing it's on for a few
35:15
weeks
35:16
each country has its own room and design
35:19
piece
35:19
and the american one was testing facial
35:22
recognition so i had a go
35:24
and it asks you to sit in a chair and it
35:26
scans your face and
35:27
it does lots of you know investigating
35:29
your face everything about it and then
35:31
tells you how old it thinks you are
35:32
um whether you're male or female or that
35:34
kind of thing you're skeptical about
35:35
this because
35:36
i think you're 175 year old jonathan
35:41
it wasn't quite that wrong but it asked
35:43
me to try and
35:44
look really angry and so i did i tried
35:47
really hard you know i put loads of
35:48
angry
35:49
faces i've seen those faces you've all
35:51
seen those faces give us a
35:53
give us a fake angry face that you
35:54
would've given it no that
35:57
to me is screaming constipation
36:06
but basically then guess what expression
36:08
i was trying to do and it said
36:09
calm and then oh god and then i guess my
36:12
age and i guess that i
36:14
and i was there with my friend she did
36:15
it and i did it it said it thought i was
36:17
a
36:18
female age 15 to 20. which is extremely
36:20
flashing but i'm not the kind of person
36:23
i mean no one has wrinkles between 15
36:25
and 20. why can't it spot that
36:27
and it said my poor friend was a female
36:29
aged 55 to 61.
36:32
who's my age so i thought on average
36:35
they got it right pretty much
36:37
right is that what they're going for in
36:40
finland there's they're testing a new
36:42
technology so the idea is that when you
36:44
walk into a shop
36:45
they're developing scanners that when
36:47
you walk in up to the till
36:49
you give a meaningful nod as it says in
36:52
the quotes that's how they've said in
36:53
this video
36:54
you give a meaningful nod to the scanner
36:55
and that's how you pay and it's
36:57
memorized through
36:58
in the same way it would your bank card
37:00
details your face is really
37:01
creepy creepy creepy i am going to trick
37:04
all this facial recognition stuff and i
37:05
found out a method i can do it by
37:07
deliberately disfiguring your own face
37:09
that's right
37:10
so it turns out that you can't trick
37:12
good facial recognition systems by
37:14
wearing makeup
37:15
even if you're wearing weird goth style
37:18
makeup
37:18
it doesn't work but there is a guy
37:21
online and his name
37:22
is turkion that's his twitter account he
37:24
has found
37:25
that the kind of makeup worn by fans of
37:27
the insane clown posse
37:30
aka juggalos right they wear very heavy
37:33
clown makeup
37:34
and it completely redefines what the
37:37
computer sees as your jawline
37:39
so we may still see people wearing clown
37:42
masks for bank robberies
37:43
but they'll just be wearing clown makeup
37:46
instead that's very clever
37:48
but they tried to train them up didn't
37:49
they recently i think you mentioned
37:50
fleetingly in a podcast
37:52
a few months ago andy that the south
37:55
wales police sent
37:56
facial recognition ai to a massive
38:00
elvis impersonator festival the biggest
38:02
one in the world
38:04
in order to hone its techniques to see
38:05
if it could distinguish between
38:06
different elvis impersonators
38:08
oh speaking of elvis um i've been
38:10
reading up on him
38:11
recently um i was reading this one
38:14
article that was published on the nme
38:16
and it's one of those things that we
38:18
don't usually naturally go to when we're
38:20
doing our research you know something
38:21
that's like
38:22
101 amazing things that you'll but this
38:25
this article
38:25
is called 75 geeky facts you might not
38:27
know about elvis presley and it was
38:29
genuinely incredible everything okay
38:32
here's one
38:33
um the inspiration for elvis presley's
38:35
trademark jumpsuit and quiff look was a
38:37
comic book hero
38:38
captain marvel jr is what inspired
38:41
elvis presley's look this is the
38:43
geekiest foundations for what it seems
38:46
to be the coolest
38:47
singer of the 1950s and 60s so did he
38:49
say that was did he used to read them
38:51
he must have as a kid yeah he was
38:52
obsessed with them i believe when he was
38:54
younger
38:54
uh and so that's what he based his look
38:57
on um here's another one just before he
38:59
died
38:59
elvis commissioned his stage electrician
39:02
to design a version of his big white
39:03
jumpsuit that he wore
39:05
which would fire laser beams into the
39:06
audience from the suit
39:09
i mean that's incredible i've not heard
39:10
that before do you know elvis
39:12
he elvis impersonators do you know the
39:15
first elvis impersonator
39:17
uh was in 1954 which is two years before
39:20
elvis's first hit single
39:22
wow this guy was called carl cheesy
39:26
nelson
39:27
and he was cheesy cheesy it was his
39:29
nickname that was his middle name okay
39:31
uh and basically what had happened was
39:34
elvis had been delayed for a show
39:36
uh and this guy was a really good friend
39:38
of elvis and so he did the whole show
39:40
just copying his entire style
39:42
that's so cool so yeah that's exactly so
39:45
funny
39:45
um just while we're on impersonators and
39:47
again from this enemy article
39:49
uh really fascinating um in somalia
39:52
owing to strict islamic law
39:53
elves impersonators are required to have
39:55
beards
39:56
so you can do everything and i'm reading
39:58
i'm reading these facts word for word i
39:59
should say
40:00
it's such a brilliant article uh just
40:02
one more thing i found really
40:03
interesting about
40:04
facial recognition oh yeah um do you
40:06
know that shops in london
40:08
have it specifically for celebrities so
40:11
a bunch of stores in london more than a
40:13
dozen stores in 2013
40:14
installed this technology which is vip
40:17
facial recognition technology
40:19
to stop that moment when someone's super
40:20
famous walks in and as a shop assistant
40:22
you're supposed to be really kind of
40:24
nice and obsequious to them but you
40:26
don't know who they are
40:27
so it has a database of all celebrities
40:29
faces and as soon as a celeb walks in
40:32
then a thing pops up on these guys tills
40:34
that says oh julia roberts has just
40:36
entered the building
40:37
and also with a bit of info about her
40:38
like she is this size
40:40
and she likes this style of thing and go
40:42
and force
40:43
her to buy some [ __ ] if only hugh grant
40:45
had had that
40:46
in notting hill when julia roberts
40:48
walked into his bookshop
40:49
oh if they could have done the whole
40:51
film in half an hour you're so right
40:54
and he would have sold her a book she
40:55
actually wanted to buy because it would
40:56
have had her preferences
40:58
i have a thing about facial recognition
40:59
and celebrities this is weirdly similar
41:01
to that so
41:02
um it's still on the trekking facial
41:05
recognition
41:06
thing there are special there are
41:08
specially designed glasses which can
41:10
make
41:11
facial recognition computers think that
41:13
you are miller yovovich
41:15
who milo jovovich yeah i think she's in
41:18
the fifth element
41:19
um she's a model slash actor resident
41:21
she's in all six of the resident evil
41:23
movies and she does a brilliant job
41:25
um so they only tell you when it's her
41:28
no no no they make
41:30
the computer think that you are
41:31
milojovovich got it
41:33
so it's really bizarre they've got they
41:35
can be made up to look like normal
41:37
tortoiseshell glasses but on the front
41:39
of the rims
41:40
they've got these specially printed
41:41
images okay and the frames
41:44
kind of overlay the face um with pixels
41:47
and when the computer looks at you it's
41:49
its calculations are disturbed and it
41:51
thinks that you are someone else in its
41:52
database
41:54
and i think i think there are limits as
41:55
in i think you you might have to be
41:57
a woman for example with that with a
41:59
slightly different bone structure
42:01
or you might need to be white as milo
42:03
drove it shows do you think
42:04
also people might start um robbing banks
42:07
looking like mila jovovich what an idea
42:10
yeah and then she's just going to get
42:12
arrested obviously yeah
42:14
so just be her and the insane clown
42:16
posse in prison
42:18

[Music]
00:14
uh hello and welcome to another episode
00:18
of no such thing as a fish a weekly
00:20
podcast coming to you from the qy
00:22
offices in covent garden my name is dan
00:25
schreiber and i'm sitting here with anna
00:27
chazinski andrew hunter murray and anne
00:30
miller and once again we have gathered
00:32
around the microphones with our four
00:34
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:36
and in no particular order here we go
00:39
starting with fact number one and that's
00:41
my fact this week my fact is that
00:43
scottish poet william mcgonagall's
00:46
writing was so bad a circus hired him to
00:49
give poetry readings under the condition
00:51
that audiences could pelt him with eggs
00:53
as he read
00:56
and he agreed to do that he agreed he
00:58
accepted the job
00:59
he was paid 15 shillings per performance
01:02
and uh he was actually slightly on hard
01:04
times so he accepted it probably going
01:07
why need the money and the eggs maybe
01:09
yeah and it wasn't just eggs was it was
01:10
stale bread as well flour he got a lot
01:12
of products that he could go home with
01:14
yeah unfortunately the performances were
01:16
put to an end quite early on and he was
01:19
disappointed about that supposedly yeah
01:21
weren't they put to an end because they
01:22
were too riotous it was in yeah 1893 the
01:25
authorities banned them because they
01:27
were getting so out of control people
01:28
were just wildly enthusiastic about
01:30
pelting him he was probably as pretty
01:31
tough to get an audience though he was
01:33
quite keen to spread his poetry
01:35
regardless of how much anyone wanted to
01:37
hear it so he was like great they love
01:39
me yeah just a tiny bit of background
01:40
for anyone who hasn't heard of william
01:42
mcgonagall this is a scottish poet uh he
01:44
was born in either 1825 or 1830 it's a
01:48
bit disputed and he was famous very very
01:51
famous for the terribleness of his poems
01:54
can i read it just so we know what we're
01:55
dealing with so one of his most famous
01:57
poems was the tay bridge disaster where
01:59
a bridger collapsed and lots of people
02:01
have been killed it starts off beautiful
02:03
railway bridge of the silvery tay alas i
02:06
am very sorry to say that 90 lives have
02:08
been taken away on the last sabbath day
02:11
of 1879 which will be remembered for a
02:14
very long time
02:15
that's the level of poetry we're dealing
02:18
with and i'm sure it comforted the
02:19
bereaved family members
02:22
so one he was a temperance campaigner
02:24
and hated alcohol and stuff was teetotal
02:25
and he blamed the fact that no one liked
02:27
his poetry on alcohol so he said they're
02:29
all too drunk to be able to appreciate
02:31
it but it does kind of imply that you
02:32
just it was the kind of thing you got
02:34
really pissed and then said should we go
02:36
and watch some of the guys
02:38
but the last show at the fringe is 3am
02:40
yeah yeah exactly
02:42
yeah he started very late in life didn't
02:44
he so he was about 50 give or take
02:46
because we didn't know exactly when he
02:47
was born so he was what was he before
02:49
that was he working i thought he was
02:51
looming and weak yeah yeah yeah didn't
02:53
he think he heard a voice saying to him
02:54
like right right you must write so he
02:56
was like well this is what i'm gonna do
02:57
and then the fact that whether he was
02:59
good or not didn't really come into the
03:00
equation yeah and he really believed in
03:03
himself as well he once tried to read
03:05
poetry to queen victoria and he sent
03:08
them a letter to the palace saying i
03:10
would like to read and they said no it's
03:12
okay thank you very much that's fine so
03:13
he thought i know what i'll do i'll just
03:14
walk there i'll walk all the way from
03:16
dundee to balmoral to perform to queen
03:18
victoria he did he arrived at the castle
03:21
and they said genuinely no thank you
03:24
he had to walk all the way back he
03:26
didn't get to do it got refused
03:28
or so that he was yeah
03:30
yeah he introduced himself as the
03:31
queen's poet when he got there
03:33
he was a massive fan of queen victoria
03:35
there were loads of assassination
03:36
attempts on her throughout her life none
03:38
of them successful and after one of them
03:40
he wrote a poem in tribute to the failed
03:42
assassination attempt which kicked off
03:44
like this god prospered long our noble
03:46
queen and long may she reign mclean he
03:48
tried to shoot her but it was all in
03:50
vain for god he turned the ball aside
03:52
mclean aimed at her head and he felt
03:54
very angry because he didn't shoot her
03:56
dead
04:00
it's quite nice i should add we were
04:01
reading these on national poetry day
04:03
here in the uk yeah it happens to be
04:06
celebrating as we're recording he was
04:08
always being victims of hoaxes that was
04:10
so sad but al also kind of okay because
04:12
he seemed oblivious to it there was the
04:15
famous hoax when a group of students
04:16
sent him a thing in the post saying that
04:18
he'd won the order of the grand night of
04:21
the holy order of the white elephant
04:23
which was an extremely important burmese
04:25
title and it was a title that was given
04:28
by king thiebor of burma for his amazing
04:30
poetry and they called him william topaz
04:33
in that and he thereafter made his name
04:36
william topaz mcgonagall you're kidding
04:38
me that's not his middle name yeah that
04:39
wasn't his birth
04:40
name from my heart i don't believe so
04:42
that's the first time ever seems to get
04:43
mentioned i hadn't read that was where
04:44
it was invented but that's the first
04:46
time it's mentioned
04:47
and then he had this award up on his
04:49
wall forevermore thinking that the king
04:51
of burma had blessed him that's amazing
04:53
i think as well like he had a lot of
04:55
weird stuff happen but he did sort of
04:56
invite some of it there's a story about
04:58
he paid money to play macbeth in the
05:00
performance or the scottish play um and
05:02
he thought the actor playing macduff was
05:04
upstaging him so he refused to die
05:07
and just like carried on
05:09
apparently that was before he started
05:11
doing the poetry so it was in his first
05:13
career and there was a review of that
05:15
players i think it's one of the earliest
05:17
times he appears in any write-up but
05:18
there was a reviewer in the journal who
05:20
eventually wrote that after of an
05:22
extremely long sword fight where despite
05:24
being hit multiple times he's not dying
05:26
um the reviewer wrote that mcduff
05:28
resolved the matter in a rather
05:29
undignified way by taking the feet from
05:31
under the principal character so he had
05:33
to be rugby tackled
05:35
on stage
05:37
he was almost never paid to write a poem
05:39
it all came from public readings but the
05:41
very few times he was paid was when he
05:43
wrote advert poems for things so
05:46
beecham's you know the beecham's pills
05:50
yeah exactly and so when they were
05:51
launched they were kind of curable they
05:53
were meant to cure absolutely everything
05:54
but they didn't really have anything in
05:56
them they had aloe ginger and soap that
05:58
was what was in them so yeah
06:00
so
06:00
for a fee he wrote the following what ho
06:04
sickly people of high and low degree
06:06
i pray you all be warned by me no matter
06:09
what may be your bodily ills the safest
06:11
and quickest cure is beecham's pills
06:14
it's quite good yeah i want some beach
06:16
right now just hearing that how did that
06:18
start again what ho sickly people
06:22
you frequently did that kind of bang
06:24
headline at the start of a poem so he
06:26
went to new york and his poem there
06:28
starts oh mighty city of new york you
06:31
are wonderful to behold your buildings
06:32
are magnificent the truth be it told
06:35
they were the only things that seemed to
06:36
arrest my eye because many of them are
06:39
13 stories high
06:40
[Laughter]
06:42
it's so weird isn't it because you don't
06:43
know whether to feel sorry for him or
06:45
not because he did seem oblivious and he
06:47
kept on almost asking for it so he'd
06:48
always dress up in full scottish regalia
06:51
with you know killed and spurring and
06:53
stuff even on the trip to america he was
06:55
dressed like that all the time
06:57
and the thick skinnedness means that
06:59
there are some psychologists who agree
07:01
with the historian who first suggested
07:03
he might have been slightly autistic
07:05
partly based on the fact that he seemed
07:07
immune almost to this constant criticism
07:10
and also his obsessive repetition of
07:12
stuff so over 60 of his poems begin with
07:15
the word twas and the phrase beautiful
07:17
to be seen is in about 50 of them and
07:20
he's really proud of that line anna
07:23
it's an incredible line shakespeare
07:24
would have been proud um i found this
07:26
really interesting and i don't know if
07:27
this is well known professor mcgonagall
07:29
is named after william mcgonagall
07:31
yeah and jk rowling has actually
07:34
confirmed that that is the case yeah she
07:35
said she likes the idea of someone so
07:37
fabulous being named after someone so
07:39
absurd didn't she yeah which i thought
07:41
was because mcgonagall is a she's a
07:43
complex character by the standards of
07:44
harry potter isn't she she's not totally
07:46
good she can be a bit of a strict old
07:48
cow sometimes oh let's not be saying
07:49
that but are we not
07:52
we're not willing to talk about that
07:53
classic slytherin sentence from anna
07:56
there yeah
07:57
i used to live in edinburgh and there's
07:58
a lot of street names that you recognize
07:59
from harry potter books and near the
08:01
statue of great foreign is a church yard
08:02
and there's a gravestone for tom riddle
08:04
really yeah you can see the actual yeah
08:06
and what's interesting about that is
08:08
that is the exact same graveyard where
08:10
william mcgonagall was buried which i've
08:12
been to i've been visiting the was lord
08:14
voldemort i'm saying i think jk rowling
08:16
took a quick creative trip to the
08:18
graveyard and bashed out all the names
08:20
she needed
08:24
[Music]
08:27
okay it is time for fact number two and
08:30
that is andy my fact is that one third
08:33
of all hazelnuts in the world go into
08:36
ferrero products
08:38
yeah so ferrero rocher nutella things
08:42
like this tic tacs which they also make
08:44
how many hazelnuts in tic-tacs that's 75
08:47
yeah but one per tic tac
08:49
tick tock box so um
08:52
yeah this is this is a piece that was
08:54
published in forbes recently and it was
08:55
a profile of the company basically which
08:57
is a very well established family firm
09:00
basically it started in the 1930s with
09:03
one man who had one pastry shop and it's
09:04
now become a thing that uses a third of
09:06
all the hazelnuts in the world yeah
09:08
they're a big deal they're a big deal
09:09
what we're saying um
09:11
the main owner uh he passed away only
09:13
four years ago michelle ferreira and he
09:16
was you know his fortune was up to 15
09:18
billion i mean it's his top 50 well the
09:21
guy now is top 50 richest people in the
09:23
world it is massive but michelle that
09:25
people always said was a very very
09:26
humble man didn't they so he was the guy
09:28
who basically his dad made the nutella
09:32
chocolate but he made it in sort of a
09:34
loaf that was quite hard and sold it in
09:36
slices yeah this was in post-war
09:38
rationing time and he thought a way of
09:40
sort of recreating chocolate is to add
09:42
hazelnuts instead because there's a
09:43
chocolate shortage but yeah he sold it
09:45
in slices like bread and he used to give
09:47
a slice of nutella away free with each
09:49
loaf of bread as a way of kind of
09:51
pushing it
09:52
and then his son uh michelle added some
09:55
oil and then it got all spreadable and
09:58
the rest is history and it's so
10:00
confusing because uh nutella was
10:02
originally sold as pasta
10:05
as in its name it was sold you bought
10:08
pasta
10:09
jandoya and it was a that's how it was
10:11
sold because it's paste right it must be
10:14
yeah yeah yeah you don't get it so you
10:16
boil it uh no it's exactly as anna was
10:18
saying it turns out you think you're
10:19
getting pasta and then it's a loaf of
10:20
bread
10:22
i'm so confused yeah it's just because
10:23
because they're italian pasta is just
10:24
gonna be italian for paste right
10:26
so it'll be pissed when the italians say
10:28
pasta
10:30
they don't eat pasta like we do at all
10:32
in italy it's all spreadable
10:34
[Laughter]
10:37
um do you know where loads of their
10:38
factories originally were
10:41
um they were old they were also in
10:42
factories but um a lot of the factories
10:44
they started off with were former nazi
10:46
missile factories
10:48
yeah i guess there were a lot of empty
10:51
ones and they were like well we'll use
10:52
the space yeah but that's that's true
10:54
they're quite great the usage rate of
10:56
the missile factory has dropped off
10:57
dramatically
10:59
i can't imagine looking at the machinery
11:01
and thinking i think i think we can
11:02
adjust this just a little bit and make
11:04
chocolates out of it no
11:06
also it's amazing how uh nutella's
11:08
managed to shake off the reputation
11:10
isn't it it's like volkswagen they're
11:12
both born of nazism and yet somehow it's
11:15
fine to possess them both are they they
11:17
wasn't made by nazis nutella well it's
11:19
got the associations hasn't it what's it
11:21
say what's the association the the
11:22
factories that's post war
11:25
factories i'm not actually suggesting
11:27
you should boycott nutella
11:29
i think i'll lose one of my food groups
11:30
if we do
11:32
well there kind of is a link i'm afraid
11:34
to italian fascism so pietro who's the
11:37
guy who founded the company yeah in 1938
11:39
he moved to east africa trying to sell
11:41
biscuits to mussolini's troops who were
11:43
stationed there oh did you there's a
11:45
little bit of a link but not a not a
11:47
full-on lake obviously as i'll say in
11:49
defense of nutella didn't isn't the
11:51
using hazelnuts was because of the
11:52
rationing from the war so it came out of
11:54
the consequences rather than because of
11:55
the ideology yes yes fascists didn't
11:58
make nutella i've never claimed that
12:00
nutella please don't sue me
12:01
[Laughter]
12:03
um so hazelnuts
12:05
yeah three quarters of the world's
12:06
hazelnuts come from turkey
12:09
yeah okay they're absolutely corn on the
12:10
market and a quarter of the world's
12:12
hazelnuts so one-third of those produced
12:15
in turkey itself three-quarters of the
12:17
total
12:18
a quarter of the world taser nuts are
12:19
produced in a single turkish town yeah
12:22
and they had a terrible frost in 2014. a
12:25
third of the harvest was wiped out and
12:26
prices rose by 60 percent yeah this is
12:29
audio business
12:30
yeah
12:31
exactly it's i mean obviously it's in
12:33
the fields around the town it's not
12:34
exclusively in the town but nutella are
12:36
trying to smash the monopoly market yeah
12:38
because they want a bit of variety in
12:39
case there's another frost so they're
12:41
moving into georgia and abkhazia uh
12:44
another traditionally very calm and
12:46
politically easy-going region which
12:48
won't be so they they're prey to a lot
12:50
of local politics basically but every
12:52
year they have half a million tons of
12:55
hazelnut shells to get rid of what do
12:57
they do with them um they sell them for
12:59
cheap heating fuel oh cool eco and i
13:03
can't remember what else they do well
13:04
here's one thing that the ferrero people
13:06
do they use the hazelnut shells and
13:08
they've been testing and i don't know if
13:10
this has been put into practice this was
13:11
a few years ago they've been making it
13:13
into the wrapping that we have for
13:15
yeah so they've reintegrated it into the
13:17
packaging to make themselves totally
13:20
resourceful of all nutella
13:23
that gold stuff this is from the project
13:25
coordinator at ferrero we have access to
13:27
large amounts of residual byproducts
13:29
which we realize could be used
13:30
constructively um so the company's idea
13:33
was to use the nuts uh to create the
13:35
packaging for the chocolates hey if you
13:37
ever want to know what to call a
13:39
specific bit of a ferrero rocher i have
13:42
the answer so i was reading about how it
13:44
goes through the factory and you know
13:46
it's got all these amazing devices that
13:48
for instance that sense if it's
13:49
misshapen and automatically puff a bit
13:51
of air to knock it off the production
13:52
line and all that funky stuff um and
13:55
then there's a moment where all of
13:56
ferrero rocher is is this wafer ball
13:59
that rounded wafer oh yeah which by the
14:00
way took uh took him ferreiro five years
14:03
the story goes to try and hone how to
14:06
make a wafer curl apparently he was in
14:07
his factory on his own for five years
14:09
that's as legend
14:11
um but he curls the wafer and then
14:13
they're in the factory and they've got
14:14
hazelnut in them and nutella spread and
14:16
before they're dipped in chocolate and
14:17
hazelnuts that little ball is called a
14:19
pickpock
14:20
wow okay so if you ever suck the
14:22
chocolate off the outside of a ferrero
14:24
rocher you can say i've got a pickpocket
14:25
so they've got tic tacs pickpocks
14:28
that's very good naming they should they
14:30
should market that that's very i don't
14:31
want to eat one that someone else has
14:32
taken the chocolate off
14:35
i was reading a bit about the fact that
14:37
this family that created the whole
14:39
ferrero
14:41
empire are incredibly secretive we were
14:43
saying humble before but also incredibly
14:45
secretive no one knew virtually anything
14:47
about them and for a company that was so
14:49
massive they never did any real
14:51
publicity of their own their website uh
14:54
it was spotted in the telegraph back in
14:55
2009. this has since changed so possibly
14:58
since uh the the owner michelle had died
15:01
but they only had one financial press
15:03
release on their website up until 2009
15:05
and it was two sentences long and that's
15:07
the only thing they ever had yeah he
15:09
gave one interview michelle in his whole
15:11
career and even when he gave that
15:12
interview which was right towards the
15:13
end of it before he died he wore dark
15:15
glasses the whole way through
15:17
yeah do you think it wasn't actually him
15:19
yeah you're right he blatantly said that
15:20
because then your media savvy yeah
15:23
media's having a lumper from the factory
15:24
wow it's still his brother who's in
15:26
charge it's now giovanni
15:28
yeah they're basically like real life
15:30
willy wonkas but without the killing off
15:31
with children that's true stop killing
15:33
like foreign
15:37
[Laughter]
15:43
you're going to be sued by harry potter
15:44
why what i was uh that was anna again
15:47
saw me because of the graveyard no
15:49
that's real william mcgonagall's buried
15:51
there and there is a thomas riddle oh
15:53
yeah yeah she did claim jk rowling has
15:55
no imagination she just wanders around
15:56
graveyards like a creep stealing her
15:58
ideas off the gravestones jk rowling is
16:00
the greatest writer that our world has
16:01
ever known it's too late now now i've
16:03
said the words
16:04
um i found out something about
16:06
shakespeare's globe because
16:07
shakespeare's globe was partly built on
16:09
hazelnut shells what wow so they were
16:11
excavating the original one before it
16:13
was rebuilt
16:15
and what they found a layer of hazelnut
16:17
shells and they assumed that maybe this
16:19
is the leftovers from people snacking on
16:21
them but it turns out that that wasn't
16:22
the case because they were an ingredient
16:25
in a kind of mortar what was called a
16:27
poor man's mortar so it was mixed with
16:29
cinders and ash and it let the rain
16:30
water filter through
16:32
about support of the building so when
16:33
they rebuilt the theater the theater
16:36
sourced seven and a half tons of
16:38
hazelnut shells from turkey wow
16:41
sort of a special military plane flew
16:43
them over and they were pounded into a
16:46
mortar and they were put under the floor
16:47
so the globe today is still on hazelnut
16:49
shelves that's exclusively amazing cool
16:51
that is so cool we sometimes need a
16:53
button like an alarm for like best fact
16:55
of the podcast
16:57
okay we've hit best facts
16:58
um they used to be called hazelnuts
17:01
until really recently they used to be
17:02
called filberts now have you guys ever
17:05
called them philbits no because i was
17:06
just reading an article in the atlantic
17:08
which happened to be from 1996 and
17:10
someone said the filbert or as people
17:12
seem to be calling it these days the
17:13
hazelnut
17:14
newfangled nonsense
17:16
isn't that weird that's named after i
17:18
think we can bring it back
17:20
um should we move on yeah yeah oh can i
17:22
just mention nutella jars in 2015 one
17:25
caused a fire this is in twickenham and
17:28
sun rays refracted from an empty nutella
17:30
jar that was left on a windowsill and it
17:31
burned an entire house down and killed a
17:33
pet dog so don't leave your nutella jars
17:36
out and don't sue us nutella
17:38
anna you've absolutely gone for it
17:41
they're nazis they'll burn your house
17:43
down
17:47
[Music]
17:51
okay it is time for fact number three
17:54
and that is chozinski
17:56
my fact is that the earliest depicted
17:58
sofas were five feet high off the ground
18:02
there's this great article in the paris
18:04
review which is a review of a book
18:06
called now i sit me down by a guy called
18:09
white old rabzinski and i really want to
18:12
read it and in that he mentions this
18:15
couch which appears in an alabaster
18:17
carving from the
18:19
seventh century called the garden party
18:21
and it's from assyria and it shows a
18:24
king reclining on a sofa and it's five
18:26
feet high and he's got his queen
18:28
slightly below him on an also quite high
18:30
chair that has a foot stall to mount it
18:33
and so yeah at the earlier sofas were
18:35
like that uh and this was in nineveh in
18:37
645 bc and the height of your furniture
18:40
apparently was related to where your
18:42
social standing was
18:43
do you know that the french word for
18:45
sofa is canopy
18:46
so if you're in france someone offers
18:48
you a canape they're offering you a sofa
18:51
really they're much more generous at
18:52
that dinner
18:54
it gave out so many canopies yeah it's
18:56
because it's a sofa for the thing to go
18:57
on isn't it we call it that because it's
18:59
like a couch for the food to sit on what
19:02
yeah the food relaxes
19:04
the traditionally it's stale bread um
19:06
it's supposed to be in a canape and so
19:08
the stale bread acts as a sofa and then
19:10
you plonk your salmon on top of it and
19:12
that's the canopy
19:13
that's great i didn't know that you may
19:15
have lost your best fat to the podcast
19:17
yeah
19:18
do you know in the um 50s there was a
19:20
trend for cardboard sofas
19:24
yeah and there's an article in popular
19:26
mechanics in 1954 and they called the
19:28
trend paperboard furniture and they were
19:30
very excited about it because you could
19:31
use pulp and waste paper and so it could
19:33
be recycled or you could find it
19:34
different ways very lightweight
19:36
and i quote the furniture is relatively
19:38
inexpensive extremely strong and durable
19:39
and can be disassembled when you move
19:41
newlyweds can use it to bridge the gap
19:43
until they can afford the kind of
19:44
furniture they want for life
19:45
so basically rather than send you a box
19:47
with stuff in it just take the box
19:50
yeah
19:51
sofas are one of the reasons why romans
19:53
did away with cutlery for a while so the
19:55
reclining on couches became really you
19:58
know popular and was brought from the
19:59
arabic world the middle east where this
20:01
original fact was from into europe and
20:04
the word sofa comes from an arabic word
20:06
so the romans started doing it and then
20:08
you're using one hand to lean on you
20:10
know you're propped up on one elbow and
20:12
so you can only eat with one hand and so
20:13
you can't be having cutlery because it
20:15
gets right in the way it just looks so
20:16
uncomfortable the roman way of dining
20:18
you're lying on your side on a couch
20:20
with a table with food on it next to you
20:23
it just looks mad yeah yeah and it takes
20:25
up so much space because everyone's
20:26
lying down yeah so the theory is that
20:28
that's how the last supper happened
20:30
everyone was on the right everyone was
20:32
lying on their sides um in a kind of
20:34
u-shape so you'd have about four people
20:36
per side
20:38
each side of the u but it does mean that
20:40
you're facing someone's back yes they're
20:42
lying oh yeah that's in front of you
20:43
facing away from you and the guy behind
20:45
you is facing your back and trying to
20:46
talk to you and you've got someone's
20:48
foot in your face yeah yeah but i just
20:50
think it would
20:51
you'd want to make sure you're on the
20:52
right part of the room because there's
20:54
this thing about if you go to sleep on
20:56
your left side you're likely to get
20:57
indigestion because your food enters
20:58
your esophagus so it goes that way so if
21:00
you lie on your right there's one way
21:02
there's one way there's one with it
21:03
there's one way that if you lie you can
21:05
get indigestion because the food can't
21:06
go in easily one way that's easier so if
21:08
you're lying on the wrong side in the
21:09
room i mean lying down's still not great
21:11
but yeah it would be slightly more
21:12
comfortable i think i'd risk indigestion
21:15
just to have a conversation with a human
21:16
rather than
21:17
maybe
21:18
in a circle but maybe or a spiral they
21:21
all tended to lie the same way often in
21:23
those paintings so maybe they'd crack
21:24
this indigestion thing and they're like
21:26
and they knew
21:27
yeah that's really amazing i didn't know
21:28
that
21:29
so furniture generally is quite recent
21:31
almost all the furniture we see today
21:33
there was an article in the new york
21:34
times that was saying pretty much
21:36
everything you see was invented between
21:37
1670 and 1730. so once sofas came about
21:41
like a lot of things after ancient roman
21:43
ancient greece and everything fell they
21:45
just disappeared didn't come back for
21:47
ages and things like armchairs or
21:51
sofas or basically everything except
21:53
just one table where you do everything
21:55
and then your bed just wasn't a thing
21:56
and along with it apparently came the
21:58
new sofa attitude which was when women
22:01
started being a bit sexier and more
22:03
relaxed because the sofa encourages you
22:05
to slightly drape yourself over it so
22:08
there's a theory that kind of loosened
22:10
up women's behavior and morals i think
22:13
wow
22:14
so suddenly men around the world were
22:15
going hey there's some sexy ladies all
22:18
of a sudden that's when the population
22:20
started to really rise yes
22:22
wow i did find out about the first man
22:24
to make a chair factory because before
22:27
uh this guy he was called michael thomas
22:28
a french man
22:29
all chairs were lovingly handcrafted and
22:32
made
22:33
he was born in 1796 and in vienna 40 or
22:36
50 years later the mid-19th century lots
22:38
and lots of
22:39
restaurants and cafes and coffee houses
22:41
are opening
22:42
and they need chairs they need hundreds
22:44
and hundreds and thousands and thousands
22:46
of chairs and it's too much effort for
22:48
individual craftsmen
22:49
laboriously carved chairs so he had this
22:52
brilliant method where he would um cut
22:54
wood into strips he'd boil bundles of
22:56
them in glue and then he'd bend them
22:59
into the shape
23:00
in a mold that he wanted them to be so
23:02
it's a more effective way of doing it
23:04
and then he developed ways of bending
23:06
whole wood um you know whole pieces of
23:08
wood so it was bending rather than
23:10
jamming together which is obviously much
23:12
less labor intensive yeah
23:13
demand grew so high that he had to open
23:15
five factories by the time he died wow
23:17
so he was a huge chair pioneer thousands
23:19
of thousands is it weird to think of the
23:21
first ever
23:23
michael foney michael funny yeah
23:26
then on the very opposite mass produced
23:28
um you know when kim kardashian and
23:29
kanye west got married they had for
23:31
their meal they had a massive
23:33
custom-made marble table i entered a
23:35
place card that everyone's names
23:36
engraved in the marble table
23:39
but they got married it's lame i didn't
23:40
let me transport that back to california
23:43
wow imagine having a last minute seat
23:45
positioning change yeah
23:46
we've actually fallen out can we sit
23:47
apart no yeah unfortunately
23:50
oh my goodness it's literally set in
23:52
stone
23:58
[Music]
24:01
okay it's time for our final fact of the
24:04
show and that is anne
24:06
my fact is that the first advert to be
24:08
shown on channel five was for chanel
24:09
number five
24:11
so good lovely so nice
24:13
very pleasing what a coincidence
24:17
um so it launched on 30th of march 1997.
24:20
um the spice girls launched channel 5 um
24:22
where they were sang the song 54321 but
24:25
turned into one two three four five yeah
24:27
it was a night of wild entertainment i
24:29
watched it this morning um because i've
24:31
never seen it before the full launch
24:32
night yeah do you remember it do you
24:35
remember very excitingly people turning
24:36
up to um re-jig the tv yeah because
24:39
there are only four channels then so
24:40
it's like we were getting 20 more yeah
24:42
yeah yes we were so excited about what
24:44
brilliant program
24:46
would hold little did we know
24:48
what i forgotten though was that half an
24:50
hour of the launch night was just
24:51
showing trailers for shows that were
24:52
coming soon
24:56
the first ever advert that was um put
24:58
onto tv was in the 50s and it was itv's
25:00
launch night it was the first time it
25:02
went on it was an advert for um
25:04
toothpaste gibbs sr toothpaste and it's
25:07
quite cool because you know first tv
25:08
advert and already they were employing a
25:10
lot of the tricks that are used in
25:12
modern day adverts so the toothbrush
25:13
itself was in a big block of ice and
25:16
obviously uh you can't use a big block
25:18
of ice on a on a set you know it'll melt
25:20
too quickly so it was made out of
25:21
plastic so immediately they were using
25:23
fake props to be the actual thing yeah
25:25
it's quite cool but yeah so that was
25:27
yeah 16. that was the first in the uk
25:29
wasn't it because there was advertising
25:30
exactly it was the first in the uk yeah
25:32
i read a really strange thing about
25:35
advertising now and the future of it so
25:36
did you know that with um old sitcoms
25:39
old but like relatively i finished
25:40
sitcoms like however met your mother
25:42
what they're doing now is they're still
25:43
selling advertising spots because
25:44
they're going in they're digitally
25:45
altering the shows for products that
25:47
came out after the show was made
25:50
[Music]
25:53
of a new song well the example was about
25:55
um a movie that come out a few years
25:57
after the episodes they changed i think
25:59
a tv screen in a coffee shop and they
26:00
have there'll be a lamp post in one
26:02
scene they put a poster for the film on
26:03
the lamppost so they're selling this
26:05
like digital space that's so good in
26:06
shows it would just cost me so many
26:08
questions yeah how is this they know
26:11
this film was coming out yeah that's
26:12
such a fun idea of updating though like
26:14
the way that anna just went omg if like
26:17
in 40 years time someone's listening to
26:19
this and we digitally insert whatever
26:21
the
26:21
ptt
26:22
[Music]
26:37
i read a thing about the first adverts
26:38
ever but this was on wikipedia and i
26:40
haven't been able to back it up
26:42
independently but it's that the earliest
26:43
adverts were in china and that they were
26:46
oral
26:47
so you would get bamboo flutes played to
26:50
sell confectionery
26:52
i think the first advertising was sort
26:53
of going around playing a flute and
26:54
saying hey do you want to buy some
26:55
sweets so you would you would create a
26:58
jingle on your flute i think so but i'm
27:00
not sure i think in the uk there was a
27:02
version where they would um like early
27:04
like flyering they would hand out
27:06
leaflets and it would have the sheet
27:07
music so you could sing the jingle to
27:09
yourself you can take it home and be
27:10
like that's right that's very funny
27:12
that's so weird
27:14
so funny
27:15
so much less appealing the idea of
27:17
something advertised by your dad kind of
27:20
badly trying to interpret sheet music
27:23
i reckon we could set that um william
27:24
mcgonagall beach thing to music
27:26
yes
27:27
you're right if it had been handed out
27:29
with a flyer people loved it yeah do you
27:32
guys know what the cheese pool is the
27:35
cheese pull the cheese pull an
27:37
advertising term okay uh any guesses
27:40
cheese pull it's like a thing of cheese
27:43
sounds like a baby bell on a string
27:45
um
27:46
close-ish i think it's an advert that
27:49
offers you something exciting like a
27:51
cheese but then it pulls it away so it
27:53
leaves you curious and it leaves you to
27:55
go and find out more about the product
27:57
these are all brilliant guesses uh none
27:58
of them are even close it's you know in
28:00
pizza adverts when um the pizza slice
28:03
gets pulled away from the pizza and
28:04
every pizza ad the cheese pulls away and
28:06
that's the cheese pull and all adverts
28:09
like perfume or pizza have it adverts
28:10
sort of try and advertise something i've
28:12
never seen a perfume over the
28:14
slowly pulled show guys it's become a
28:17
metaphor for a broader advertising
28:19
technique uh which is basically using an
28:22
image that specifically really really
28:24
triggers your different senses that
28:25
aren't sight so by visual suggestion you
28:27
see that cheese but it triggers your
28:29
sense of taste so and i watched a lot of
28:31
this research you desperately want pizza
28:33
because there's a weird thing with
28:34
perfume that you're you're advertising
28:35
something that you can't show cause it's
28:36
a smell exactly so you can't be like oh
28:39
look how great it looks i guess why you
28:41
have complicated bottles but you want to
28:43
sort of give the vibe of what you're
28:45
selling i guess rather than the actual
28:46
product because you need the cheese pool
28:48
because you can't actually show a smell
28:50
um i found another thing about perfume
28:53
in 2014 a californian firm announced
28:55
that they were making perfume for cows
28:57
okay that's not good right but for human
29:00
benefit oh so the idea was to make cows
29:03
smell like humans no
29:05
yes so mosquitoes would bite the cows
29:08
instead of biting people it's definitely
29:10
unintended consequences
29:16
um i was reading that benjamin franklin
29:19
wanted once to invent a perfume and it
29:22
was an anus perfume as in what if we
29:25
turned our farts into perfume what if
29:28
what captured them no
29:30
no yeah although that is something that
29:32
people used to do but um what he wanted
29:34
was for scientists to focus on creating
29:37
some kind of medicine that you would
29:39
take that would mix with the gases that
29:41
were down there so that when you did
29:43
fart it would come out with chanel
29:45
number five yes did he have a suggestion
29:47
then what did he no he was asking for
29:49
scientists to look into it it was but
29:51
that was his idea we can all ask
29:53
to look into stuff yeah but not all of
29:54
us are benjamin franklin
29:56
you can invent this too can i just say
29:58
one thing which i don't think we've ever
30:00
mentioned so the egyptians were really
30:02
into perfume you know we're always
30:03
finding it in the tombs when we excavate
30:05
them and um they thought that the it was
30:09
like the sweat of the gods and stuff so
30:11
myrrh was a sweat of the god ra and then
30:14
her ben oil a different perfume was
30:15
squeezed from the eye of horus but uh
30:18
one thing they used to do is wear
30:19
perfume cones on their heads and that's
30:21
you see it in a lot of egyptian art and
30:23
yeah it's like like an inverted
30:26
party hat cool it's like a party hat but
30:28
but what it was is a wax cone and then
30:30
it had perfume on the inside and you'd
30:32
go to a banquet and because it was quite
30:34
hot in egypt it would melt as the
30:36
banquet proceeded and released the
30:38
perfume sense into the air presumably as
30:40
wax kind of rolled down your face
30:44
and then like dried
30:45
like in your hair tried and congealed in
30:47
your hair it's like why spray it on
30:49
yourself when you can bring the bottle
30:50
with you
30:51
you are the perfume you are
30:53
feel the perfect be the perfume you are
30:56
the perfect
30:58
um a couple of chanel facts yeah
31:00
so coco chanel i didn't know this wasn't
31:02
called coco or chanel in her birth
31:04
certificate really really yeah so her
31:06
first name is gabrielle cocco's nickname
31:07
and her name is chanelle but it was
31:09
originally spelt with an s before the
31:10
end so it's chasmel
31:13
she's got a different ring to it
31:15
not as chic is it
31:16
yeah is now number five
31:19
from wolverhampton
31:21
um and then it takes um so for a 30
31:25
milliliter bottle of the perfume it
31:26
takes a thousand jasmine flowers and 12
31:28
roses which is a lot into one we bottle
31:30
and i like a lot if you shop at chanel
31:32
often enough you get your own custom
31:34
mannequin made to your exact proportions
31:36
i can make you clothes no way i can't
31:37
imagine how much money you need to spend
31:39
before you're at mannequin level oh i
31:41
thought you meant that they made you a
31:42
custom mannequin so they can practice
31:44
spraying the perfume on the clothes
31:46
measure the dimensions of your neck to
31:48
make sure yeah
31:49
it's right for you so as a design house
31:52
sorry they have the mannequin they make
31:54
other things i think perfume is kind of
31:56
a one-size-fits-all
32:01
[Laughter]
32:08
i was reading about uh the making of
32:10
chanel number five its origins so it was
32:12
this guy who created fragrances called
32:15
earnest bow and when he was presenting
32:19
his um his sense to coco chanel he had
32:23
numerous scents that he wanted to show
32:24
her he and he numbered them number one
32:26
to number five and then there was a
32:27
second batch which was number twenty to
32:29
twenty-four and she went through and she
32:31
picked number five because that was the
32:33
best one
32:34
um
32:35
six to nineteen because that's what i
32:36
want yeah exactly and he never used to
32:38
smell when he was creating the perfumes
32:41
he did it all basically like a
32:42
mathematical formula oh really he knew
32:44
the smells and he knew the combination
32:46
so well that he just used to write the
32:48
recipes and he said it's like writing
32:50
music each component has a definite
32:53
tonal value i can compose a waltz or a
32:56
funeral march um that's quite beautiful
32:58
yeah like playing with smells well what
33:00
is a good smell it's a little
33:02
isn't it what
33:04
it is there's no smell to this
33:06
silly flowery smell rounding off today's
33:08
lawsuit challenge
33:11
with it's all to the makers of
33:13
chanel
33:19

[Music]
00:15
hello
00:16
and welcome to another episode of no
00:18
such thing as a fish
00:19
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
00:21
qi offices in covent garden
00:24
my name is dan schreiber and i am
00:25
sitting here with andrew hunter murray
00:27
anna chazinski
00:29
and alex bell and once again we have
00:31
gathered around the microphones with our
00:33
four favorite facts from the last seven
00:35
days
00:36
and in no particular order here we go
00:39
starting with fact number one and that
00:41
is jaczynski
00:42
yep my fact this week is that the
00:44
inventor of the venn diagram
00:46
also invented a machine that
00:47
automatically bowls qriket balls
00:51
yeah it's you can see how the two cross
00:53
over uh because the venn diagram is
00:55
circular well there are circles in it
00:57
right and the cricket balls are circular
00:59
i suppose
00:59
yeah so i think that's where he got the
01:01
inspiration so does that mean that you
01:02
could draw a venn diagram of
01:04
cricket related inventions involving
01:07
balls
01:07
in one circle and venn diagrams in
01:09
another circle
01:11
and then in the middle you've got this
01:12
guy who invented both so that's
01:14
not a venn diagram because you've just
01:17
fallen into the
01:18
biggest venn diagram trap that the
01:20
internet ever creates which is that
01:22
really annoying thing where it has as
01:23
you've just said
01:24
this thing plus this thing equals john
01:26
venn but that's not what a venn diagram
01:28
is is that a universe
01:30
no it's not it's nothing it's just a
01:32
thing the internet makes up
01:33
okay do i really have to explain venn
01:35
diagrams yes please
01:38
so i guess let's imagine you've got two
01:40
circles
01:42
and one circle is a set so a category
01:45
and there's a bunch of stuff in that
01:46
category let's say animals
01:48
um and then you've got another circle
01:50
which is another set
01:51
something's called barney thing's called
01:53
barney yeah
01:54
exactly and then you have oh this is
01:56
difficult because i don't know if we're
01:57
counting barney the dinosaur as a
01:58
natural animal
02:01
i think we need a third diagram circle
02:03
which is fictional
02:05
creatures all fictional and real animals
02:07
ever created
02:08
there we go then you can get barney in
02:10
the middle so the thing in the middle
02:11
has to belong to those categories so for
02:13
your thing to work
02:14
john ven would have to be a type of
02:16
cricket ball or whatever and a type of
02:18
venn diagram
02:19
neither of which okay what about
02:20
inventors of things that are around to
02:22
do with round things and inventors of
02:23
things that do
02:24
cricket and he invented both because
02:26
cricket balls are round
02:27
and venn diagrams are round oh no but
02:29
they're not with cricket are they
02:30
we've really got sidetracked it's
02:32
amazing that john venn worked it out
02:36
he didn't call them venn diagrams no no
02:39
so they are a subcategory of euler
02:41
diagrams
02:42
things where you're representing
02:43
information in circles but they don't
02:45
have to be linked
02:46
and then venn diagrams are eulerian
02:48
circles but where there is
02:50
an intersection between the two they're
02:52
euler diagrams aren't they
02:54
they don't i don't know his name is
02:55
euler yeah you're probably right but
02:56
yeah the other
02:57
is the thing that people confuse as well
02:59
i think the difference is that the venn
03:01
diagram if you imagine the three
03:02
intersecting things
03:04
it can include empty sections so let's
03:06
say let's say you've got two circles and
03:08
one of them is
03:09
uh mammals and another one is birds and
03:12
they're intersecting
03:13
you have to have that middle
03:14
intersection even though there's no such
03:15
thing as a bird that's also a mammal
03:16
okay okay so um he is said to have
03:20
invented this diagram
03:21
in 1881 that is the date that's put on
03:24
the first time that he he came up with
03:26
the concept
03:27
um so i was looking into 1881 just to
03:29
see what other scientific inventions
03:31
happened that year and it was an amazing
03:33
year
03:33
really a lot of a lot of things happened
03:35
so charles darwin published his final
03:38
scientific book
03:39
which was called the formation of
03:40
vegetable mold through the actions of
03:42
worms
03:43
yeah it's not exactly under the deathly
03:45
hallows
03:47
the first modern caesarean section was
03:50
performed in 1881
03:52
was it yeah wow alexander fleming was
03:54
born in 1881
03:55
and then lastly carlos finlay who was a
03:58
cuban doctor was the first
04:00
to propose that yellow fever was
04:01
transmitted by mosquitoes rather than
04:03
direct human contact
04:04
that's a huge moment yeah that resulted
04:07
in a lot of life saved that's cool
04:08
imagine being a journalist in that year
04:11
a tiny baby
04:15
um there are lots of really nice
04:16
tributes to venn john venn
04:18
so in the cambridge college where he
04:20
taught there's a stained glass window
04:22
which is a venn diagram it's got three
04:24
circles of overlapping stained glass
04:26
and in the middle it's much darker so
04:28
it's kind of half double glazed
04:30
and then half single glazed and then a
04:32
bit of it's triple glazed because there
04:33
are three circles
04:34
wow that must be really warm yeah that
04:37
um he so yeah do you know what college
04:39
he went to was it gone villain keys yeah
04:41
he went to
04:42
gonville and keys and he did a couple of
04:44
other things in his life so first of all
04:45
i should explain he did invent the odd
04:48
thing
04:48
and one of them was this automatic
04:50
bowling machine for qriket balls
04:52
and the weird thing about this was that
04:54
he invented it and the australian qriket
04:56
team had come to visit britain and they
04:58
visited cambridge where he was at the
04:59
time
05:00
and he whipped it out he was asked to
05:01
get out his qriket bowling machine to
05:02
entertain them
05:03
and it automatically bowled out
05:05
australia's best batsman four times
05:06
running
05:08
so that was the glory days of english
05:10
cricket um
05:11
but another thing he did which i love uh
05:14
it's almost about the only other sort of
05:16
thing that goes down
05:16
in his biography aside from his
05:18
mathematical stuff is that he
05:20
with his son compiled a book that was a
05:22
biographical list of all
05:24
known students graduates and holders of
05:26
office ever to go to the university of
05:28
cambridge from the beginning of history
05:30
up until well he he only got till 1751
05:33
before he died
05:34
so that was 136 000 biographies of
05:37
people
05:38
that he wrote what a dull yeah
05:42
it's not how did he find out those
05:44
little biographies of all of these
05:45
people
05:46
yeah it's incredible school reports yeah
05:48
i guess so
05:49
they must have had some sort of records
05:51
i mean if anyone's going to have records
05:52
it's going to be like a really old
05:53
university that has had like a
05:54
consistent way of doing things for years
05:56
and years and years
05:57
i think they obviously had something
05:58
otherwise it was just him and his son
06:01
mike smith did do you know something
06:04
else that has
06:05
a venn diagram on it in tribute is if
06:07
you live in clapham in london
06:09
or you've ever been to clapham um
06:11
there's venn street which you might know
06:12
it's got ven street records on it
06:14
which i really like um and that's named
06:16
after not john venn after his
06:18
grandfather
06:18
who happened to be the reverend uh an
06:20
erector in clapham
06:22
and it does so the sign for venn street
06:24
also has a venn diagram on it
06:26
in tribute to the rector's grandson who
06:28
invented the diagram
06:29
if i was a town planner and i wanted to
06:31
celebrate john then i would build a sort
06:33
of double roundabout
06:34
shaped like a venn diagram it would be
06:35
really i mean there'd be quite a lot of
06:36
accidents probably but yeah the middle
06:38
of the diagram would just be calcium
06:42
this way
06:51
okay it is time for fact number two and
06:53
that is my fact
06:54
my fact this week is that if you want to
06:57
increase capacity on a cruise ship
06:59
you just simply have to cut it in half
07:01
and add a whole new chunk of ship
07:04
that's done it's so weird yeah i've seen
07:06
an amazing video of it what they do
07:08
is they take these cruise ships and they
07:10
dock them and
07:11
they just literally slice down the
07:13
middle it's obviously a spot where the
07:15
original design
07:16
says if you ever need to cut this into
07:17
two this is where it happens is it like
07:19
a
07:19
scissor symbol and a line around the
07:21
ship
07:22
and so they cut it in half and they
07:24
separate it and then
07:25
they just insert the chunk that they
07:28
would like to go inside and push
07:30
as if it's a the meat to a ship sandwich
07:33
close it up and and then it's ready to
07:35
go and it's fully functioning
07:37
extraordinary the first problem i have
07:38
with this is that all the rooms in a
07:39
hotel are crucial and numbered so you're
07:41
going to get room like 17 18
07:43
b 18 c because otherwise
07:47
i bet they just renumber the rooms yeah
07:49
you can just take the numbers off can't
07:50
you probably
07:51
i'm sure they make removable numbers you
07:52
do have to unscrew them but they've got
07:54
people to do that
07:56
in many ways this is the smallest part
07:57
of the operation
08:00
but they do they rename the ship usually
08:01
when they change it
08:03
as well in the queen
08:10
you gotta come up with
08:14
so yeah i mean this was done with a ship
08:16
um which was called the silver spirit
08:18
that's one example and they extended it
08:20
when it cut it in half they put in a 49
08:22
feet chunk
08:23
into the middle of it on the subject of
08:26
cruise ships and slicing massive
08:27
sections out of things
08:28
um disney owned a lot of cruise liners
08:30
and they also have an island in the
08:31
bahamas they bought in it's one of their
08:33
destinations their cruise ships but it's
08:34
sort of you know like a very
08:36
shallow sandy island with a with a lot
08:38
of shallow kind of beach around it so
08:40
it's too you can't get the cruise ship
08:41
anywhere near to it so it's not like a
08:43
sort of a steep kind of you know cliff
08:44
into the sea
08:45
so what they did was they basically cut
08:47
out an underwater parking space for
08:49
their cruise ships
08:50
they just dug a massive trench that goes
08:52
up towards the the island so the cruise
08:54
ship can just sort of reverse into it
08:55
and go right up the island
08:56
and so if you look at it on google earth
08:58
there's just a kind of a rectangular
09:00
dark patch of ocean right next to it
09:01
it's amazing
09:02
it's so cool i'll post a picture on my
09:04
twitter feed i found a cruise ship
09:05
for dan whoa because we've been thinking
09:08
of sending you away for a while thank
09:09
you
09:09
um have you guys heard of conspiracy
09:12
cruises
09:15
nodding but he's not allowed to talk
09:16
about it
09:20
never heard of it these are
09:23
i can't believe this exists go to their
09:25
website um it promises to
09:27
deliver to anyone who's interested the
09:29
truth about all these things and it
09:31
lists the truths that it'll deliver so
09:32
it's the truth about
09:33
global warming fracking hiv vaccinations
09:37
then it gets weirder and weirder so
09:38
fluoridation
09:39
forbidden archaeology jfk september 11.
09:42
you're welcomed onto the ship by captain
09:44
elvis presley
09:48
what is they telling the truth about
09:50
star wars agenda
09:51
do you know what that is that's to do
09:53
with the um not the movies
09:55
it was a president bush i think he was
09:57
talking about it a lot the idea of
09:58
having
09:59
satellites that were able to shoot uh
10:01
down through the atmosphere physically
10:03
militarizing space yes exactly okay oh
10:06
god imagine booking for the real truth
10:08
about
10:08
who luke's father really was
10:12
dressed to see trevio i think that
10:16
person would get along perfectly well
10:17
with everyone
10:18
the good news is that you don't have to
10:19
have any vaccinations before you go on
10:21
one of these cruises
10:25
it sounds so weird where does it go so
10:28
it goes all over the place they go to
10:29
various places
10:35
they're not crazy um costs three
10:38
thousand dollars
10:39
who these people don't have this money a
10:41
popular mechanics journalist went on it
10:43
because he said
10:44
he read about it and thought it would be
10:45
really fun and thought you know you
10:46
could go with some other kind of jokers
10:48
and discuss stuff and said it was
10:50
terrifying so everyone's really serious
10:52
there has taken it very seriously
10:54
he ended up being chased out of various
10:56
conference rooms because i think they
10:57
suspected him of something
10:58
having to flee down corridors from
11:00
people chasing him and shutting himself
11:02
into his room
11:03
you know they have uh as well as
11:04
conspiracy cruisers they have 80s
11:06
music cruises so they have whole cruises
11:10
where just musical stars from the 80s
11:12
perform
11:13
so there was a great write-up of one
11:15
which mostly focused on tony hadley of
11:16
spandau ballet
11:18
and he said i saw an avid in the paper
11:20
last year for music cruises
11:21
i couldn't believe it there was huey
11:22
lewis in the news pat bennetta crosby
11:25
stills and nash and alfie beau
11:26
i phoned my manager and asked why am i
11:28
not singing at sea he said don't worry
11:30
tony i'm already on it
11:33
this does happen a lot now um not just
11:34
for 80 stars so um the band weezer have
11:37
a weezer cruise and they invite a lot of
11:38
bands on
11:39
there's a comedy cruise as well as just
11:41
a bunch of comedians would go off on
11:43
this cruise
11:44
and they were the entertainment that
11:45
sounds like hell on earth
11:47
yeah it really does i throw myself in um
11:49
actually speaking of comedians there's a
11:51
really good story about a cruise ship
11:52
comedian
11:53
from 1991 do you have you guys heard of
11:55
mts oceanus which sank
11:57
in 91 no no so uh this was a huge cruise
12:00
ship um
12:01
it sank and the captain and his crew
12:04
were the first people
12:05
off the ship when it sank straight away
12:08
they'd very bad form they didn't even
12:10
make an announcement uh over the tannoy
12:12
saying
12:12
that's a real faux pas yeah so um they
12:15
basically the passengers heard this
12:16
explosion
12:17
uh on the ship nothing happened for ages
12:19
so they went to check where the captain
12:21
was supposed to be and he was gone
12:22
he left the ship unmanned and all his
12:25
crew had gone and the only person left
12:26
to save him was um the ship entertainer
12:28
called
12:28
moss hills and he saved everyone on the
12:30
ship it's this great story where he
12:32
rescued the 571 people so first of all
12:35
he worked out how to use a ship's radio
12:37
to phone a mayday thing to say we're in
12:39
trouble
12:40
you're comedian he's got microphone
12:41
experience it makes sense is this thing
12:45
you haven't been on a cruise and there's
12:47
a massive explosion
12:49
maybe it was he just performed some
12:51
comedy and the people at the other end
12:52
thought god would better save those poor
12:53
passengers
12:55
um but yeah these helicopters came and
12:57
lifeboats uh
12:58
were used to rescue them and he rounded
13:00
everyone up and got them onto the
13:01
lifeboats and organized it and he and
13:03
his wife and his fellow deputy
13:04
entertainer were the last people off the
13:06
ship
13:06
do you know what happened so i was
13:08
looking up ship launching ceremonies oh
13:09
yeah and
13:10
these things happen with cruise ships as
13:11
well the first water to touch the ship
13:14
is caught
13:14
sealed in a bottle and then displayed in
13:16
the captain's office
13:17
how do you catch i don't know what a
13:20
great point
13:21
what if you try to collect the water and
13:23
um there's a fish in it
13:24
do you think you tip the fish out or do
13:26
you then because that would be quite a
13:27
good outcome wouldn't it because at
13:28
least you don't have this tedious bottle
13:29
of water in your captain's office yeah
13:33
lovely little memento the environmental
13:35
damage your massive cruise ship does to
13:37
the ocean
13:38
okay fine looking on the bright side are
13:39
we just
13:41
you mentioned ceremonies yeah i didn't
13:42
know about the line crossing ceremony
13:44
do you guys know about this no the this
13:46
happens um when you turn a really
13:47
inappropriate joke on a cruise ship
13:49
and that was like no mate no this is the
13:52
line crossing ceremony is not that
13:53
it is when you cross the equator but
13:55
this is the thing that happens on a lot
13:56
of cruise ships they do this ceremony
13:58
um and in the navy they do this ceremony
14:00
and then also like in merchant maybe
14:01
they do the ceremony and it's been
14:03
happening since at least the early 1800s
14:05
um and darwin had it done to him for
14:07
instance so on the beagle it's really
14:09
funny to read his diary from there
14:11
because he really looked down on it
14:12
and was like come on i'm a bloody
14:14
scientist i'm not down for all this kind
14:16
of banter
14:16
it was an initiation thing where you had
14:18
to do lots of as he described it
14:19
extremely disagreeable and unpleasant
14:21
things so there was a lot of simulating
14:23
sex acts in the olden days and stuff i
14:25
think
14:25
really yeah and you what you're told to
14:27
do is well first of all you get kind of
14:29
well what happened to darwin is he got
14:31
battened down in the hatchways in the
14:32
dark until he was super hot
14:33
and then you get dragged up by the crew
14:36
and you have to
14:38
go to the court of neptune so it's
14:40
basically have to go to neptune and be
14:41
accused of your crime
14:43
and you're known as a polywog until
14:45
you've passed the equator successfully
14:47
and then you become you know a seasoned
14:49
traveler and yeah so darwin was trapped
14:51
down and then dragged up
14:53
onto the deck and then he had buckets of
14:55
water thrown over him
14:56
he was blindfolded he was made to stand
14:58
on a plank above this huge bath of water
15:00
and then they tipped him in
15:02
um and he thought it was the actual
15:04
scene because he was blindfolded oh
15:05
probably yeah
15:07
that's a funny trick to play that is
15:09
funny yeah
15:10
um on walking the plank there's a
15:12
norwegian cruise ship which has a walk
15:14
the plank experience
15:15
oh they make you walk the plank well i
15:18
think you volunteer to walk
15:20
along and that and it's an eight-foot
15:21
long plank but you do it wearing a
15:23
safety harness
15:24
oh okay yeah yeah so you just slam into
15:26
the side of the ship
15:29
[Music]
15:36
okay it's time for fact number three and
15:38
that is
15:39
alex uh my fact this week is that
15:41
stephen mangan
15:42
michael parkinson eamon holmes and
15:44
cherie blair have all been dropped from
15:46
the tv program
15:47
who do you think you are because their
15:48
ancestry is too boring
15:51
are they were they dropped mid program
15:53
they were yeah pretty much no they were
15:55
they were signed up to do it because the
15:56
programmer approached and said would you
15:58
like to do the program and you sign up
15:59
and say yes and agree to do all the
16:00
things
16:01
and then they start researching and then
16:03
at some point they went back to these
16:04
people being like actually you know what
16:06
let's leave it
16:07
because it's going to be rubbish the
16:08
good news is that their full story has
16:09
made a new series called who cares
16:11
[Laughter]
16:14
it was very funny because it sounds like
16:15
they have to be quite diplomatic when
16:17
they tell them
16:18
so with sherry blair one of the
16:20
producers said
16:21
we spent hours locked in rooms with
16:23
sherry's publicist secretary manager
16:24
personal assistant
16:25
eventually we had to say you are very
16:28
interesting
16:29
but we don't have a show
16:32
but it's amazing because cherie blair is
16:34
a booth and
16:35
she is a descendant of john wilkes booth
16:38
as in
16:39
it's her yeah who killed abraham lincoln
16:42
wow yeah so it's not a direct descendant
16:44
it's john wilke booth's uncle
16:46
was sheree blair's direct ancestor and
16:48
um
16:49
surely there was enough in there alone
16:51
she was really disappointed wasn't she
16:53
it is kind of sad all these people were
16:55
in fact i think she was disappointed i
16:56
think michael parkinson might have said
16:58
he was really sad as well he said he was
16:59
gutted he said it's the one
17:01
show that he would have been happy
17:06
of all the celebrity-based programs that
17:08
he actively wanted to take part in not
17:10
even parkinson he didn't even enjoy that
17:12
jesus stephen is really funny because
17:14
they found out that all of his ancestors
17:16
were from the same place in ireland
17:18
and the same very small place in ireland
17:20
he's yeah his mother and father
17:21
grew up in adjacent villages on the west
17:23
coast of ireland but they never met
17:24
until they both happened to come to
17:26
london
17:26
and then meet each other there i think
17:28
that's so interesting
17:29
that your whole family can be from one
17:31
tiny spot yeah
17:33
yeah um i would love to see a program
17:35
done on japan's
17:37
emperor you know the imperial family in
17:39
japan
17:40
because they have a family tree that's
17:42
traced back so far
17:44
that it goes into mythological
17:46
characters
17:47
at that point i would say you've lost
17:49
the trace yeah yeah but
17:51
they believe it in japan so it's a part
17:53
of the official family tree and it goes
17:55
into
17:55
effectively you know people who are up
17:57
on clouds and
17:58
but where's
18:05
660 to 585 bc was the life of jimmu
18:09
who was an emperor and it's from there
18:12
and uh his wife isu kayori
18:14
um they both have family trees that
18:15
disappear off into mythology
18:17
with amazing cloud-flying emperors
18:21
i like the fact that you say it traces
18:22
back so far that it goes into mythology
18:25
as if you actually think that if you go
18:26
back
18:27
far enough in history you will come to
18:28
mythological creatures
18:31
it'd be great to be the kids of the like
18:33
well my father is a thunder throwing god
18:35
and my mother is from suffolk
18:37
and how do they meet and there's also
18:40
um the guinness book of world records
18:42
actually um acknowledges the longest
18:44
lineage of a family tree that is
18:46
traceable yeah it's called the lurie
18:49
lineage
18:50
um that that's it's the lurie family um
18:53
and it includes people like sigmund
18:54
freud and martin buber
18:56
i don't know who that is one of the most
18:58
famous in history
19:00
and martin buber every son just wants to
19:02
suckle on his mother's boobies
19:07
oh my god this is crazy this lineage
19:09
traces back to
19:10
jahil lurie a 13th century rabbi in
19:13
breast
19:14
lifts wow
19:17
freud is just steeped in yeah although
19:20
of course when you trace
19:21
stuff back far enough as we've said
19:22
before then uh you
19:24
you know you all unite around the same
19:25
person like we're all related to martin
19:27
buber
19:28
aren't we all boomers at the end of the
19:30
day there is there was a lot of this
19:32
mythology stuff in the past wasn't there
19:34
as in there was a theory that um
19:36
the british royals were descended from
19:37
brutus
19:39
was there yeah but brutus and it all
19:41
dated back to the fall of troy
19:43
okay that was the thing uh there was a
19:45
brutus who the roman brutus was
19:46
descended
19:47
and not the caesar brutus that was an
19:48
earlier more mythological brutus
19:50
was descended from the people who left
19:52
troy the trojans
19:54
uh when they left after the fall of the
19:55
city and that through brutus
19:57
that's how it descended to the english
19:59
monarchs in the 15th and 16th centuries
20:02
yeah that was the myth well cherie blair
20:04
is related to brutus
20:06
junius brutus booth the father of john
20:08
wilkes booth who was named
20:10
after uh brutus yeah from the play
20:13
and he was a very famous actor and
20:15
what's very interesting about him
20:16
is that he also attempted to assassinate
20:19
a president i tried to assassinate the
20:20
president well he sent a letter
20:22
to president andrew jackson he demanded
20:25
that he pardon two pirates
20:26
and uh he refused and he there was a
20:28
threat of assassination
20:30
uh if he didn't um and he got caught for
20:32
it but yeah isn't that weird his
20:34
dad was a teenager yeah well like father
20:36
like son you know you know what you grew
20:38
up with you're often influenced by it
20:40
aren't you
20:40
um just on sheree blair's family tony
20:43
booth was her dad yeah
20:44
uh not a difficult one to trace back
20:46
obviously but he's a famous actor
20:49
he had the discovery scene can't believe
20:51
he didn't point out the tony booth thing
20:52
guys
20:53
it's right there he was an actor who was
20:56
he was famous he was in until death to
20:57
his part
20:58
and various other things weirdly had bit
21:00
parts in eastenders and emmerdale and he
21:02
played the same character in both which
21:03
is a who acts as a spiritual guide
21:05
to one of the characters
21:06
cool presumably the people who made
21:09
which was evident eastenders yeah
21:11
presumably the people who made say
21:12
eastenders saw the trump giving
21:14
spiritual advice
21:15
to one of the characters in emmerdale
21:16
and thought we've got to get this
21:20
but do you know what other films he did
21:21
tony booth which i didn't know
21:23
and it's just such a weird idea it's
21:24
saucy films it's such a saucy film so he
21:27
did the confessions of
21:28
series which was in the 70s and it was
21:31
like confessions of a window cleaner
21:33
which
21:33
embarrassingly was the top grossing
21:35
british film of 1974.
21:37
yes and it's sort of comedy sex films
21:39
yeah a lot of boobers in
21:43
he was in there of these confessions of
21:44
a driving instructor and the plot is as
21:46
you would predict a window cleaner goes
21:47
around shagging lots of housewives
21:50
and stuff but he's on the other side of
21:52
the window that's the tragedy of the
21:53
window cleaner isn't it
21:55
yeah but he can drill a hole because
21:56
they have um drills
21:58
famously window cleaners
22:01
just cleaned or slightly the drilling
22:02
service too
22:06
yeah i could do with some air relax
22:08
mechanism is broken so yeah drill
22:09
through it thanks
22:17
okay it is time for our final fact of
22:19
the show and that
22:21
is andy my fact is that wombats can kill
22:24
predators by crushing them with their
22:26
bottoms so it does require quite a lot
22:29
of setup this um
22:30
prank i'm going to call it prank defense
22:33
mechanism
22:34
yeah i wouldn't say prank okay fair
22:35
enough um so there's an essay in the
22:37
london review of books
22:38
by writer called catherine rundle which
22:39
is all about wombats and it's full of
22:41
very interesting facts about them
22:43
so wombats have burrows they dig lots of
22:46
burrows actually
22:47
and they have very very hard bottoms so
22:50
we've mentioned before that sometimes
22:51
they will plug
22:52
the ground with their bums yeah when
22:54
there are predators around and the
22:55
predators won't be able to like a door
22:57
yeah yeah and so it turns out also that
23:00
the
23:01
scientists have found shattered fox
23:03
skulls inside wombat burrows
23:06
so if a fox follows a wombat into its
23:08
burrow the wombat will crush the fox's
23:10
head against the wall of its own burrow
23:12
and kill it
23:16
yeah well the roof yeah apparently with
23:18
dingos they'll just slam them up against
23:20
the roof
23:20
incredible pranks harry hill do the
23:24
voiceovers
23:26
you've been crushed they're so good with
23:29
their
23:30
bombs though because they can like this
23:31
classic qr fact is that the wombats have
23:33
cubic feces
23:35
and then i didn't even know this they
23:36
stack that like they stack their poo and
23:38
it's supposed to be scientists think it
23:39
might be some sort of like status symbol
23:41
to sort of put your poo in a high tower
23:43
which you can't do because they're
23:44
square because they're square yeah so
23:45
they do up to 80 to 100 a day
23:47
or per night rather and they they're for
23:50
display purposes
23:51
effectively so they don't want them
23:53
rolling off rocks when they put them up
23:54
on a rock for it to be seen well it's
23:56
yeah it's demanding territory isn't it
23:57
yeah
23:58
to attract people but it's a bit rough
24:00
on the baby wombats because one that's
24:01
obviously marsupials and
24:03
as we've said in a previous podcast uh
24:05
the babies face backwards in the pouch
24:07
and so what this means is the they're
24:09
always pooing
24:10
and the baby wombat's face is usually
24:12
poking out of
24:13
its thing the pouch just below its arse
24:15
and it's just shoved in this pool all
24:17
the time
24:17
no yeah is that baby you've got in
24:20
your face
24:20
80 to 100 times a day the head is just
24:22
poking out isn't it
24:24
behind at the back of the mother yeah
24:26
but the weird thing is that they don't
24:28
have cubic
24:29
anuses that have square anuses to
24:31
produce the cubic poo
24:33
there's a mystery it's not really a
24:35
mystery because we know how they make it
24:36
oh we do know how they do know how to
24:37
make it so it's in the it's beside takes
24:40
them 14 to 18 days to digest food
24:42
it's very very long so by the time it
24:45
gets out of them
24:46
it's really compact and it's had all the
24:49
nutrition taken out of it you know it's
24:50
very
24:50
efficiently done and they have ridges in
24:53
the first bit of their intestine
24:55
which shapes the food as it's being
24:57
digested into these cubic shapes
24:59
and then they have also have special
25:00
bones in the bottoms to keep the poo
25:03
in the cubic shape wow yeah it's like a
25:06
cookie cutter like it's just it's
25:08
holding the
25:09
genuinely in december they do christmas
25:11
trees
25:13
it would be great if they could vary it
25:15
like a balloon magician
25:17
imagine if we could do not come to your
25:19
children's parties
25:21
let's just book the wombat again what i
25:24
like
25:25
um about one bats is you can see
25:26
pictures of them where
25:28
when the young wombat that's in the
25:30
pouch is almost mature enough to leave
25:32
it's probably poking its head out and it
25:33
grazes so it'll be eating grass
25:35
out of the back and the mother will eat
25:37
grass out the front and it just looks
25:38
like it's a two-headed
25:42
incredible wow amazing you must have
25:44
seen them
25:45
dank because you you like many times
25:47
yeah um i've seen them in captivity
25:49
they're so beautiful my favorite animal
25:51
i have to say i saw one for the first
25:52
time this year yeah it was amazing
25:54
when we went to ours yes of course and
25:56
australian zoos apparently they have the
25:58
second highest danger rating
25:59
so the only things that beat them are
26:00
lions and bears and then as a zookeeper
26:03
the next thing you've got to be
26:04
terrified of is the wombat oh my god for
26:06
a large guinea pig
26:07
it's quite weird yeah and they they run
26:09
so fast as well
26:10
they can run as fast as usain bolt
26:14
faster for longer yeah yeah they can i
26:15
think they can run at 25 miles an hour
26:17
and his top speed is about 27.
26:19
but usain bolt can run at uh 27
26:23
miles an hour give or take for about
26:24
what nine seconds
26:26
wombats can run at 25 miles an hour in
26:28
90 seconds
26:29
so if they were trying to catch him they
26:31
would we don't know
26:33
whether or not usain bolt could keep
26:35
that up for longer that's just
26:37
what he that's where he has no one's
26:39
ever put him on a longer track
26:40
he's done a 200 meter but that's a
26:42
different discipline he's you're running
26:43
a different pace there
26:44
that's a good point so if he reaches a
26:46
if he if we just said
26:48
just keep going when you get to the end
26:49
are you saying you think he could run at
26:51
that speed for
26:52
a kilometer well a minute and a half
26:54
would be because that's what a wombat
26:55
can do yeah i'd be curious to know
26:57
what his deceleration would you what do
27:00
you think he might just be choosing to
27:01
run 200 meters a bit slower because
27:03
never mind anyway
27:11
yeah yeah i was looking up other animals
27:14
that used their asses
27:16
in interesting ways there's a type of
27:18
caterpillar called the skipper
27:20
caterpillar which does the thing called
27:21
scat firing
27:22
um so it's able to launch its poo out of
27:25
out of its back end kind of a high speed
27:28
it was um
27:29
i think it's scientists think it was
27:31
genetically evolved
27:32
as a way of just getting or put away
27:34
from you just you know for hygiene
27:35
reasons but it's also pretty good for um
27:37
shooting like wasps that come to an
27:39
issue wow
27:40
isn't that great yeah no so that it's
27:42
like a paintball gun or something like
27:44
completely
27:45
clay pigeon shooting yeah
27:50
to be able to shoot pigeons with poo
27:54
as they approached us yeah i think
27:56
clothing would have evolved differently
27:57
to allow you easy access to a weapon
28:00
yeah yeah but it's it's amazing how it
28:02
works so it poo comes out in pellets
28:04
and so they come out and and then they
28:06
get sort of stored inside a special
28:08
uh launch pad an anal kind of launch pad
28:11
um and then it
28:12
pumps up the blood pressure but you know
28:14
when like in a computer game
28:16
yeah and then um and and then kind of
28:18
like launches it like a casper
28:22
so they poo inside themselves and then
28:24
yeah pretty much store it up
28:26
into the uh like the the what's it
28:28
called like into the chamber yeah so
28:29
you've got a false bottom or you've got
28:30
exactly it's the second bottom inside
28:32
your first
28:33
bottom they're all magicians
28:37
wow that's extraordinary that's
28:38
incredible that's really amazing
28:41
so there was a i'd rather like this so
28:43
there used to be a giant wombat
28:44
which were weighed three tons it was
28:46
about the size of a rhino
28:48
and it lived um until really recently so
28:51
we think it only died out
28:53
around the time that humans first
28:55
reached australasia so there's a big
28:56
question about who killed the giant
28:57
wombat
28:58
and whether it was us basically okay um
29:01
sounds like it was us
29:02
it does sound like obsessed but maybe it
29:03
was environmental or maybe it was um
29:05
you know climate factors i think it was
29:07
probably yes it was probably us who
29:08
killed all the giant wombats
29:10
but they they were alive until about 50
29:13
000 years ago
29:14
so it's really recent that we had these
29:16
things big as rhinos
29:17
as big as right imagine that that's
29:19
crazy and and their hindquarters were
29:22
very developed for their size so they
29:24
had like like
29:25
super anuses oh man you could build a
29:27
pyramid out of the squares coming out of
29:29
that
29:30
wow yeah i did find a thread online
29:32
saying what if
29:33
a marsupial had evolved into a
29:35
horse-like creature
29:36
how would that have affected it it was
29:37
just a discussion forum saying wouldn't
29:39
it have been cool if we could have uh
29:41
domesticated the giant wombat yeah and
29:44
use that
29:44
in equestrian ways yes so they are very
29:47
hard to domesticate
29:48
and also they're extinct by 55 000 years
29:51
so i reckon we'd be overwhelmed with
29:53
them and living underground
29:54
and it would be a nightmare riding them
29:57
presumably you'd have to face backwards
29:58
because of the pouch thing which i think
30:00
would be quite difficult wait are you
30:01
proposing that you get into the pouch
30:02
i assume that's how you'd ride it right
30:03
now you get on it yeah you get on top of
30:05
it yeah
30:06
what if it had a
30:09
yeah that's a good point also we've
30:11
established you've just been having like
30:12
all over your face all the time
30:13
it's not ideal no yeah is there an
30:15
animal living currently that has a pouch
30:17
big enough that
30:17
a human could sit inside it i don't have
30:20
a living
30:21
species i mean the kangaroo's probably
30:23
got the biggest power yeah yeah yeah
30:25
even quite large kangaroos you can't fit
30:26
a baby in there speaking of everything
30:28
you're getting a baby yeah but they're
30:30
gross and disgusting and you wouldn't
30:32
want to do it yeah we're talking about
30:33
just
30:33
you know theoretical theoretical
30:37
you could definitely fit a human baby
30:39
into a kangaroo's paper i don't think so
30:40
the largest the largest kangaroos that
30:43
go into pouches are definitely the size
30:44
of human babies
30:46
actually you're right babies are small
30:47
aren't they oh you're right joey's gonna
30:48
be massive yeah should be massive they
30:49
stay in there for ages they're right
30:51
either way i'm calling social services
30:52
before you get a chance to try it out
30:55

00:47
well um with the podcast
01:00
hello and welcome to another episode of
01:02
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
01:05
coming to you from the qi offices in
01:07
covent garden
01:08
my name is dan schreiber and i'm sitting
01:10
here with anna chazinski andrew hunter
01:12
murray
01:13
james harkin and special guest it's the
01:15
lead singer of maximo park
01:17
paul smith and once again we have
01:19
gathered round the microphones with our
01:20
four favorite facts from the last seven
01:22
days
01:23
and in no particular order here we go
01:26
starting with fact number one
01:27
and that is paul the studio that made a
01:30
hard day's night
01:31
demanded the beatles voices be dubbed
01:33
because they thought americans wouldn't
01:35
understand their accents
01:37
[Laughter]
01:38
so good and uh just for context they
01:40
were massive at that point weren't they
01:42
in america
01:42
they were and that's why the film was
01:44
actually commissioned
01:46
united artists gave them i think it was
01:49
200
01:49
000 pounds and i don't know what the
01:52
equivalent of that is these days but
01:54
it's still not a great deal to make a
01:56
feature film yeah and
01:58
they thought well we'll sell loads of
01:59
records off the back of this terrible
02:01
movie that will probably bomb
02:02
and it ended up being one of the biggest
02:04
movies ever yeah so it was a
02:06
loophole wasn't it it was a loophole for
02:08
the um the movie company because it
02:10
meant that they were able to release a
02:12
beatles album outside of the recording
02:14
studio contract so they actually bought
02:16
a beatles album for an incredibly low
02:17
sum of money
02:18
yeah and it wasn't dubbed in the end it
02:21
wasn't dubbed at the end you don't hear
02:22
deep south accidents do you in a hot
02:24
day's night not that i know
02:27
so paul you must sell records in america
02:29
right uh just about
02:30
can they understand anything that you
02:31
say um i'm very charming
02:33
abroad apparently right okay after the
02:36
show's you know you get the usual oh i
02:37
love your british accent
02:39
and that kind of thing and it's it's you
02:41
know i i don't have a traditional
02:43
british accent so around america i get a
02:45
lot of hey
02:46
you're you sound really scottish
02:51
i live in newcastle it's the last big
02:53
city before you get to
02:54
scotland yeah you get people i think
02:57
americans sometimes will you know say a
02:58
scouser is an australian
03:00
or uh liverpodians you know from south
03:03
africa
03:03
they're pretty wacky with where they
03:05
guess we're from but scousers
03:06
accent is particularly hard for people
03:08
to get isn't it
03:09
it's like a really hard accent for
03:11
non-liverpudlians to understand
03:13
so for instance jamie carragher did a
03:16
documentary so he's a liverpool
03:17
footballer he did a documentary a few
03:19
years ago called being liverpool
03:20
and they even subtitled that for the uk
03:22
audience wow
03:25
that's amazing no way i'm afraid so wow
03:27
yeah
03:28
so on on the accent thing so the beatles
03:30
they did have i didn't know this their
03:31
own cartoon
03:32
which ran for about four years in the
03:33
mid 60s but none of the beatles had any
03:36
part in it whatsoever so none of them
03:38
sounded like themselves because they
03:39
were all voiced by other people
03:41
so apparently george sounded irish or
03:43
maybe scottish
03:44
john lennon sounded american paul
03:45
sounded like a pg woodhouse character
03:48
they just bought no relation to what
03:49
they were like wow well they did
03:51
sing in american accents didn't they
03:53
like a lot of bands but like if you
03:55
listen to early beatles they sound
03:56
american
03:57
yeah and then in later beatles albums
03:59
they go more
04:00
british sounding mm-hmm um so whatever
04:03
puddley and sounding they go
04:04
well liverpool and sunny exactly and i
04:06
think because american is a it's a bit
04:07
easier to understand the words because
04:09
americans drag their words out more and
04:10
they have their like rhotic saying
04:11
they're ours
04:12
and also it was just where all the rock
04:14
and roll was at yeah all their
04:15
influences
04:16
all their influences were american there
04:17
were no but also it was a good way to
04:19
sell
04:20
to a market that was used to listening
04:21
to american music whereas once they were
04:23
well established enough
04:24
by the time they got to sergeant peppers
04:25
then they'd have um things like you know
04:27
it's getting better all the time
04:29
getting better all the time
04:33
that's what the song sounds like so in
04:35
the first studio album they pronounced
04:37
their ass 47
04:38
of the time and by the time they were
04:40
doing let it be it was three percent of
04:42
the time
04:42
but statistics and then they went around
04:44
the other side where now ringo sounds
04:46
like he lives
04:47
somewhere in the middle of the atlantic
04:49
ocean yeah
04:50
because he's lived in america for a long
04:52
time and is obviously lives in a
04:54
celebrity bubble
04:55
which is fine that's i'm not there's no
04:57
criticism
04:58
i would probably be living in that
05:00
bubble as well if i was ringo but yeah
05:02
it's like little
05:03
um yeah yeah i had a little oh decent
05:06
city's kind of thing
05:07
yes just out of curiosity because i know
05:08
um sometimes words are missed out so
05:11
there's a song fixing a hole would that
05:13
have been fixing whole
05:14
what what like like using internet or
05:17
not fixing so you know how i would say
05:20
using internet yeah or something
05:22
that's not a liverpudlian thing no i
05:24
know i'm i'm just thinking
05:26
uh northern accents i think in liverpool
05:28
they tend to pronounce all of the words
05:30
but do they but not the r's although i'm
05:32
thinking
05:33
you said they didn't pronounce the rs in
05:35
let it be i'm thinking of the lyrics of
05:37
let it be and it's mostly the word let
05:39
it be over and over and over and over
05:40
again
05:41
it used to be called let it beer
05:42
[Laughter]
05:44
none of us pronounces ours though we
05:46
should say you do
05:48
actively insert ours into words that
05:50
don't have them you pronounce far too
05:51
many
05:52
you collect up all of our drop downs and
05:54
say them all
05:55
but yeah do you know why the scouse
05:56
accent is so um singular
05:59
and kind of odd no so i didn't quite
06:01
know so
06:02
it does sound really different to places
06:03
quite nearby so linguists say that
06:05
actually
06:06
if you uh take sort of a manchester
06:09
accent and
06:10
a newcastle accent maybe they can be
06:12
seen as
06:13
different variations of the same kind of
06:15
pattern where a scouse is really totally
06:16
different and it's because
06:18
when it became this really important
06:19
porch there was so much uh
06:21
irish and welsh emigration and so
06:23
there's so there's quite a lot of welsh
06:24
in the scout saxon isn't that irish
06:26
definitely answer
06:27
and irish yeah uh which makes it
06:29
completely standout
06:30
but there is a theory that the scouse
06:32
accent is changing and
06:34
um softening as the air gets cleaner
06:38
so there's a there's an old gag that
06:39
it's what is it it's one-third
06:41
irish one-third manchester and one-third
06:42
qatar and
06:44
and that's not the country of qatar is
06:47
but so the
06:48
so the industrial economy obviously is
06:50
not as big as it was it started changing
06:51
to service and so clean air legislation
06:53
has cleaned the air up so there is a
06:54
theory that this will have an effect
06:56
i wish i'd written down more of the
06:57
details of how exactly it's affected
06:59
well the idea is that
07:00
because people spoke more adenoidally or
07:03
nasally because the
07:04
air was so bad you would kind of close
07:06
your airways while you were talking
07:08
like a camel like a camera yeah do they
07:11
do that well they can close their
07:12
nostrils
07:15
[Laughter]
07:23
about the pollution in liverpool is you
07:26
used to be able to tell
07:26
a true liverpudlian in liverpool by his
07:28
dirty raincoat
07:30
because if they had a clean redcoat it
07:33
meant it was a sailor who just arrived
07:34
from sea whereas if you were living in
07:36
liverpool all the time the pollution was
07:37
so bad that your raincoat would be dirty
07:39
so if the inside of the raincoat
07:41
flashing at you is clean that's a newly
07:44
arrived
07:45
liverpudlian have you i was reading a
07:48
lot about um
07:49
in music how when a re-dub needs to
07:52
happen
07:52
lyrically because of a different country
07:54
whether where the song is being done in
07:56
france or in italy and so
07:58
um either they bring someone else in to
08:00
sing a dubbed version or the lead singer
08:02
of a band so i don't know if maximo park
08:04
has ever
08:04
with your solo stuff yes have you ever
08:06
done a different like
08:07
yes i did german for um on my last
08:10
record
08:11
contradictions by paul smith and the
08:13
intimations which is just a made-up band
08:16
really i've got to confess it's just me
08:18
um and
08:19
yeah i did a version of this song called
08:21
people on sunday
08:22
obviously it's called something
08:23
different it's called mention amazon tag
08:26
in in german and when i was about to
08:28
play my german tour i got a friend of
08:31
of my wife's who's german to translate
08:33
it for me
08:34
but i was obviously i'd honed it for the
08:37
recording
08:37
when i did it live i had all of the
08:39
words pasted on in front of me on the
08:41
mic stand
08:42
and it was it's obviously those quite
08:44
awkward translations
08:46
yeah so do you speak german a little bit
08:48
i'm
08:49
bishop i envision i don't know i would
08:52
just say it's quite trusting with your
08:54
friend
08:54
that they tell you that this is the
08:56
right words but she's german so she's
08:58
quite serious okay
08:59
so this is the thing you know and
09:00
stereotypically she's very straight down
09:03
the line and so i thought she won't have
09:05
me on
09:05
but yeah i could i could cross-check it
09:08
with my little bit of
09:09
of german that i knew um that must i
09:12
because you have a singing style which
09:14
is your your accent plays into the tone
09:16
and the
09:16
style of singing and i always think that
09:18
must just scramble what your identity is
09:20
a vocalist is all of a sudden when you
09:22
when you said language you don't know
09:24
how does your accent play into it in
09:27
some ways it does because when i
09:28
like when we first started one of the
09:30
first songs that was put on it was put
09:31
on a german magazine
09:33
on a cd that you get on the front of the
09:35
on the front cover
09:36
and so lots of people knew this song the
09:39
coast is always changing
09:40
and in this particular song i say i am
09:42
young and i am lost
09:44
and and they love the young um in
09:47
germany
09:48
i love the way you pronounce the word
09:49
young yeah it's really it's really great
09:52
i think it's about the psychologist
09:54
young well this is the thing i'm going
09:56
to work it out i didn't i didn't go
09:57
further but it's yeah like jungen is a
10:00
german verb i think and anyway there's a
10:04
great recording of ian jury playing in
10:05
germany
10:06
and he's just shouting at the audience
10:07
in cockney german for at least half the
10:09
album it's amazing and he translates
10:11
blockheads into dumb cop
10:12
and he just keeps getting the audio to
10:14
shout dumbcop
10:15
it's great when things went wrong in
10:18
germany
10:18
i had a little bit of german so our
10:20
keyboard used to break all the time and
10:22
i would go
10:23
clavier
10:24
[Laughter]
10:28
it goes down so well in germany just
10:29
that little sprinkling of gcse german
10:32
gone wrong
10:32
yeah but it's appreciated
10:38
my german isn't good enough yeah i'm
10:40
sure it was i just assumed that was
10:42
funny and gave you the laughs
10:43
a small german listener [ __ ] would have
10:44
gone absolutely crazy
10:47
speaking of dubbing in russia um you
10:49
would not have subtitles very often for
10:51
movies and they would just dub it into
10:53
russian
10:54
uh they these days they kind of do have
10:56
subtitles um
10:57
but in poland they don't still they
11:00
don't
11:00
and both countries have a thing called
11:02
elector and that was a person
11:04
one person who would dub all the parts
11:07
for everyone in a movie
11:08
they still have that in poland in poland
11:10
they do in russia they do a little bit
11:11
but not as much as they used to
11:13
uh and basically these are extremely
11:15
professional people
11:16
who would just read all these um
11:18
different things out and they're so
11:19
professional they're not allowed to
11:20
swear
11:21
so you would say rude word whenever you
11:24
came up to a swear word and stuff like
11:25
are they doing all the voices
11:27
no they don't even get into character
11:29
they're just reading it almost like you
11:30
would read
11:30
shakespeare or something like that in
11:32
the monotone so if the example that um
11:34
someone
11:35
some angry person gave on a forum
11:36
because i think some like more modern
11:38
polls get a bit annoyed that
11:39
this ridiculous system was that you're
11:41
watching sex in the city
11:42
and all the voices are just this 65 year
11:45
old man
11:46
speaking in the monastery
11:49
like the younger people don't like it
11:50
but there was a poll in 2008 saying that
11:52
only 19
11:53
of polls supported the switch to
11:55
subtitling and television i don't think
11:56
we can trust one
11:57
poll to represent the entire nation
12:01
just on the beatles i have a fact about
12:04
so
12:04
and even even in 1963 paul mccartney was
12:07
still signing his name paul mccartney
12:08
brackets of the beatles
12:10
even in 63. and they were quite famous
12:13
by 1963.
12:14
there's not another one yeah there must
12:15
be a lost paul mccartney he is
12:17
super famous well i was trying to find
12:19
out about beetlemania because your fact
12:21
pools about
12:21
you know when they were becoming huge in
12:23
america and they did the ed sullivan
12:25
show and
12:25
something like 37 of all american people
12:28
watched that
12:28
live which is just you know mind-blowing
12:31
um
12:32
anyway i got from there onto one
12:33
direction mania
12:36
i'm just trying to talk
12:43
so one one direction fan um hid in a bin
12:46
for four hours to try and meet the band
12:49
and didn't even get to meet them
12:51
no because they couldn't see them
12:52
they're in a bin no but they would i
12:53
think they were planning to burst out of
12:54
the bin when one direction came into the
12:56
room
12:57
did they miss the queue what did they do
13:00
is it like when it was bin day for
13:02
someone from one direction harry potter
13:04
yeah
13:06
he's taken the bin out it's been emptied
13:08
and then you hide in the bin and hope
13:09
that he drags it back to his house is
13:11
that it
13:11
i think it was in a hotel or something
13:13
but they're known for being really
13:15
tidy they're bound to use the bound the
13:18
frequency of one direction
13:20
using litter bin is very high
13:23
but a source told the mirror admittedly
13:26
uh the boys minders won't be letting any
13:27
of these tricks get past them they'll
13:29
look at every bin if they have to
13:34
the intern that gets that job a really
13:37
important job for you to do for one
13:38
direction it's very exciting
13:40
so even the small bathroom the bathroom
13:42
bins you're saying yep even the small
13:43
bathroom bins
13:44
even the ashtrays in the cars gotta look
13:46
everywhere
13:49
um we need to move on to our next fact
13:51
can i just do you guys know cher's first
13:53
ever
13:54
song was she released the first single
13:56
she ever released was when she was 18.
13:58
it was under the student name bonnie joe
14:00
mason
14:00
because her real name cheryline up here
14:02
wasn't thought to be american enough and
14:04
it was called ringo i love you
14:06
and it's a song about how much she loves
14:08
ringo starr
14:09
she recorded it in a ben didn't she
14:10
[Laughter]
14:13
so weird it was a massive flop have you
14:16
heard it
14:16
i have yes if you listen to it it is a
14:19
complete rip-off of or it's like a
14:21
splurging together of um
14:22
she loves you yeah yeah yeah and another
14:24
beatles song i can't believe i didn't
14:26
get sued for it
14:27
i think the fact that no one heard it at
14:28
the time did help
14:30
she did pick the drummer as well she
14:32
could have picked a more popular memory
14:33
exactly
14:34
yeah i know although i actually went to
14:36
the
14:37
british embassy in washington on our
14:39
last tour and played there
14:40
and they said well you know it's great
14:42
that you've come and played here this is
14:44
really exciting
14:45
but one of the bands that we had before
14:46
was the beatles
14:48
obviously nothing to live up to and they
14:51
said
14:52
the beatles came and did a gig in the
14:54
embassy but they never did anything like
14:55
that again it was one of the
14:57
last live things they did because
14:58
somebody came with a pair of scissors
15:01
into the british embassy which i i can
15:03
attest to to it being
15:04
fairly security conscious i i went to
15:07
the toilet and it's got on the back of
15:08
the door in the toilet in the in the
15:09
british embassy a sort of secure
15:12
really heavy it's like you can lock
15:14
yourself in if something goes down
15:16
something really horrific so it's quite
15:18
serious but yes when you say sorry
15:19
something really horrific goes down
15:21
in the toilet
15:24
if you've been in a band band members
15:26
are just notoriously stinky yeah
15:29
so you're locked in there for hours yeah
15:30
you don't want to get locked in there
15:32
um when something like that goes down in
15:34
an adjacent toilet
15:36
anyway so somebody got into the british
15:38
embassy in whatever 1965
15:40
with a pair of scissors and cut a lock
15:42
of ringo's hair off
15:44
so perhaps cher wasn't actually that you
15:46
know going in the wrong direction are
15:47
you saying that maybe was [ __ ]
15:49
it might have been it may have been
15:52
that's a long time between booking bands
15:54
isn't it for uh
15:54
it is it is beatles maximo
15:58
you could say that you were headlining
16:00
for the beatles but there was just a
16:02
long gag
16:03
exactly they're supported as ably
16:09
okay it is time for fact number two and
16:11
that
16:12
is andy my fact is that monkeys in
16:14
melbourne zoo are no longer allowed to
16:16
eat bananas
16:17
because humans have bred them to have so
16:19
much sugar that the monkeys were getting
16:21
obese
16:22
it's it's a funny story but it's quite a
16:24
sad story i think it's funny answer it's
16:26
got everything
16:27
it's got everything it's got everything
16:29
it's gonna be a movie yeah
16:32
um yeah so it's bizarre and it's not
16:34
just melbourne suit like loads of zoos
16:36
have done this so there are zoos in
16:37
there's one in devon called paint and
16:38
zoo
16:38
there's bristol zoo they've done the
16:39
same thing and it's because humans
16:42
are great at breeding bananas sweeter
16:44
and sweeter and sweeter and in the wild
16:46
monkeys wouldn't get anywhere near this
16:47
kind of sugar they don't even eat
16:48
bananas i try to find proof that
16:50
monkey's doing bananas
16:51
catherine milton who studied the diets
16:53
of primex for decades
16:56
i'll buy that yeah the entire wild
16:58
monkey banana connection is a total
17:00
fabrication
17:01
that's great yeah that should be a
17:03
journey where did it come from then
17:05
with this obsession with monkeys and
17:06
bananas i think it must be the circus
17:08
because the thing is like you don't get
17:10
bananas in the wild
17:11
these kind of bananas that we eat you
17:13
just don't get them in the wild so
17:14
unless they're breaking into farms
17:17
are we saying that no monkey in the wild
17:19
is dr catherine saying that no monkey in
17:21
the world has
17:22
ever eaten a plantain or a plantain yeah
17:25
but the kind of bananas that we
17:26
they don't know the wild bananas you get
17:28
are rubbish like round and have loads of
17:30
seeds in them and taste
17:32
terrible apparently so monkeys probably
17:34
just don't want them but the thing is
17:35
they love
17:36
bananas oh yeah i mean i'm not saying
17:38
they don't like bananas
17:39
nor is catherine milton he's not just
17:41
saying that they would never get that
17:43
once
17:43
you get in waitrose they wouldn't get
17:45
them in the wild it's basically like
17:46
having an all-crack diet
17:48
yeah which is not healthy what have we
17:50
done to them
17:51
or sort of all sort of cake or chocolate
17:53
it's like eating only cake or chocolate
17:54
so they get instead they're just fed
17:56
leafy vegetables these days
17:57
and they only get a banana if they have
17:59
to have some medication and then they
18:00
hide the medication inside the banana
18:02
oh it sounds so rubbish they're getting
18:04
kind of kale and lettuce aren't they
18:06
yeah how awful it is delicious it's the
18:08
only time we ever let you have a pint we
18:10
put some
18:11
valium in it or something yeah yeah
18:14
i'd claim i needed valium yeah very
18:16
often
18:18
um their favorite food though not banana
18:20
that's number two
18:21
apparently this is according to a study
18:23
that was done in 1936
18:25
but has never been disproved monkey's
18:27
favorite food is grape
18:29
apparently grape is number one and then
18:31
bananas number two they go absolutely
18:32
nuts for grapes so that's kind of the
18:33
heroine i think and the banana is the
18:36
cocaine so if this well this is the
18:37
thing about monkeys and grapes if you
18:39
make a monkey do a job
18:40
um and i'm talking a simple simple job
18:43
not like
18:44
civil engineer or something no it was to
18:46
take a rock and put in the
18:47
experimenter's hands
18:49
so it's a basic task but if you make a
18:52
monkey do that task
18:53
for a reward like a bit of cucumber but
18:56
then you let it see
18:57
another monkey doing the same task and
18:59
being given a grape
19:01
then the first monkey will start to
19:02
slack off and it will do the job with
19:04
less enthusiasm and we'll get a right
19:05
less at the time it will care less
19:07
fair enough why are you trying to drive
19:09
these two monkeys apart and make them
19:10
hate each other
19:12
by preferring one over the other things
19:14
um
19:15
bananas are weird though aren't they and
19:19
in what context they're weird because
19:22
whenever you cross breed the subspecies
19:24
they don't create seed so that's why
19:25
we've got this brilliant seedless banana
19:27
but we're gonna
19:28
lose it so people are worried there was
19:30
the main banana that people ate was the
19:32
grow michelle
19:33
banana until the 50s or 60s and then
19:36
that was wiped out
19:37
and now this uh panama disease that
19:39
wiped out that banana has come back to
19:41
wipe out the only variety we have left
19:43
yeah and so we're in serious trouble and
19:45
scientists are trying to breed a new
19:47
banana to get around this and they can't
19:48
get it to taste right
19:49
you know the grow michelle is even
19:51
sweeter than the current one
19:53
really yeah you know like banana candies
19:55
like little sweets
19:57
look like bananas and taste like yeah
19:58
but actually when you think about it
20:00
they don't really taste like bananas do
20:01
they
20:02
well they taste like grow michelle
20:03
bananas a bit gross
20:05
no just way sweeter yeah and people
20:08
there's a theory that
20:09
actually it's a myth that the reason
20:11
that they taste differently to bananas
20:13
is because we made them when grow
20:14
michelle bananas were around and we made
20:16
them taste like those but actually
20:17
we just made the candies taste like very
20:19
sweet bananas and it just happens to be
20:21
the same
20:22
i wonder if we were in melbourne zoo
20:25
and we were fed those candy bananas
20:27
whether or not that would be
20:28
more hurtful to us than an actual banana
20:31
is too
20:32
much would it be worse do you think like
20:36
i'm trying to see the equivalent of how
20:37
bad that well effectively you're just
20:39
eating sugar and
20:40
food coloring yeah sweetener i mean how
20:42
long do you think you could survive on
20:43
just a diet of those candy bananas
20:45
few years no like for instance if you
20:48
only eat rabbits you can't last for more
20:49
than a year
20:50
no rabbits yeah where where are you in
20:53
the scenario
20:54
you're in a desert island and it's just
20:56
you and two rabbits and you think i
20:57
won't eat them for now let them bait
20:59
until there's loads of them and then but
21:01
by the time that happens you're fine but
21:02
then you eat them and then there's
21:04
something in them that you don't get
21:05
enough of
21:06
oh it's one of the vitamins isn't it
21:08
it's one of the things
21:10
yeah bananas are good though they've got
21:12
almost everything that you need in them
21:13
for a while so if you only ate bananas
21:15
and rabbits
21:18
rabbit splits there was a theory that i
21:20
remember reading once
21:22
is this about peter andre peter andre
21:26
collapsed after eating too many bananas
21:28
because
21:30
this because he was obviously very very
21:32
muscular chat when he especially when he
21:34
first started out he was known for being
21:36
yeah he missed mr muscles this is the
21:38
rockstar kind of anecdote i like
21:40
and he's maintained a good physique but
21:43
in his in his in his early days that was
21:44
that was his selling usp
21:46
there was a selling selling point yeah
21:48
always you know
21:50
what any waterfall that was nearby he'd
21:51
be able to see the mysterious girl
21:53
exactly we've seen it we know the score
21:55
so how does it look to bananas so
21:56
yeah before uh some sort of show that he
22:00
was doing which
22:00
you know would probably be you know in a
22:02
in a record shop or something not
22:04
necessarily an actual
22:06
stage or i think it was like some sort
22:08
of in-store appearance
22:09
peter andre collapsed and the rumor had
22:11
had it that he'd eaten too many bananas
22:14
because he ate like
22:15
seven or eight bananas in a row just to
22:17
keep his potassium levels up
22:18
because he was you know it felt or his
22:21
dietitian felt that he needed
22:23
this to maintain his stunning physique
22:26
and then i i'm i'm i'm now getting into
22:29
digression sketchy
22:30
territory i then read a few years later
22:33
that he'd
22:34
that you know he had collapsed but he
22:35
was you know he was ill or something
22:37
blah blah blah but he was eating a very
22:39
large amount of bananas at the time i
22:41
think his rider his rider now says no
22:43
bananas
22:44
yes managers what the [ __ ] is this keep
22:46
me away from the bananas
22:48
the bag check on the way into gigs is
22:50
just for bananas if peter sees one of
22:52
those he collapses on stage this is
22:54
i think that's true but do you know who
22:55
else used to have loads of bananas
22:58
gordon brown that's the one link between
23:00
gordon brown and peter andre gordon
23:01
brown used to have nine bananas every
23:02
day brown has a very nice physique too
23:04
yeah so there's two quite good nine
23:06
bananas a day it was he was trying to
23:08
give up
23:08
smoking oh now we're getting started now
23:11
he started me thinking about smoking
23:12
bananas
23:13
not that i've ever done anything like
23:14
that but in the 60s mellow yellow
23:17
the donovan song was people
23:20
believed it to be about smoking bananas
23:22
as an alternative to cannabis yeah
23:24
that's
23:24
a very cheap alternative which yeah
23:26
apparently has no effect i see
23:28
the big book of paul smith banana pop
23:31
amex
23:32
where's my contract where's the book
23:34
contract
23:36
um i i actually read about the donovan
23:38
song and donovan
23:40
uh has since i believe done an interview
23:43
where he said that
23:44
that was the story that came out in the
23:45
myth at the time that it was to do with
23:47
smoking the insides of bananas
23:48
in fact um inside the in the lyrics of
23:52
the song he talks about an electric
23:53
banana
23:54
which was a vibrator and mellow yellow
23:57
supposedly
23:58
is a vibrator you know um bananas skins
24:01
um are they slippy they're slippy yes
24:03
they are super slippy they've got a good
24:04
natural
24:05
lubricant on them um and actually if you
24:07
look up banana skin
24:09
lubricant trying to find cool scientific
24:10
stuff there is so much
24:12
weird sex advice out there about what to
24:14
do with banana skins but that is not
24:16
what i'm going to mention um
24:17
i but not slipping on a banana skin has
24:19
been a comedy trope since the mid-19th
24:21
century
24:22
um and actually it was a genuine concern
24:26
that it was a proper danger so this is a
24:28
time when from the mid
24:29
1800s then lots of bananas are suddenly
24:31
being imported into america
24:33
and i found a new york times article
24:35
from the 1890s
24:36
where the president of the new york
24:38
police force declared war on the banana
24:40
skin
24:41
so he said he was really worried because
24:43
he uh he explained that the bad habits
24:45
of banana skin
24:46
dwelling particularly on its tendency to
24:48
toss people into the air and bring them
24:50
down with terrific force onto the hard
24:52
pavement
24:53
and he introduced a new uh sort of law
24:55
in new york
24:56
saying that you get fined for dropping
24:58
banana skins and that was president of
25:00
the police force teddy roosevelt
25:02
so that's where he got his start in life
25:04
wow
25:05
stamping down unbeknownst i remember
25:07
reading around the same time
25:08
no i wasn't reading it around the same
25:10
time but i was reading about things that
25:11
were happening
25:13
this is really sketchy but i think there
25:14
was groups of people who would go around
25:16
um railway stations and they would
25:19
deliberately kind of
25:20
pretend to fall and they would drop
25:22
banana skins on the
25:24
ground and say oh you didn't move that
25:26
i'm going to sue you oh
25:27
really that was a big early insurance
25:29
game yeah i think we may have mentioned
25:31
it with you before but it's worth
25:32
mentioning again yeah sure and there
25:34
were there were trained inspectors who
25:36
would say who were trained to ask loads
25:37
of questions like were there bananas for
25:39
sale on the train
25:41
you know and like all these details that
25:42
you could use to spot a fraudster wow
25:44
have we mentioned sliding billy watson
25:46
before
25:48
no no but please he was a famous
25:50
vaudeville act
25:51
huge deal early 1900s and his
25:55
soul gag was sliding on stage on a
25:58
banana skin
25:59
people were easily pleased there was
26:01
loads of laughing records
26:03
some of the some of the first ever
26:05
recorded discs that were
26:07
that became popular and widely bought
26:09
were of just
26:10
of people laughing yeah and the laughing
26:13
policeman
26:14
is one of the one of the most famous
26:17
parts of that trend
26:18
but it was a total thing where people
26:20
just loved hearing people laughing out
26:22
of these new gramophones people have
26:24
never heard
26:25
records and so they didn't think let's
26:26
put a song on it they thought
26:28
let's record people laughing and they
26:30
made millions
26:31
it went it was cool yeah the laughing
26:33
policeman is a great song
26:35
it's a classic the laughing norm not so
26:37
much have you heard that one
26:39
david bowie yeah david bowie's first i
26:41
think is his first single maybe the
26:43
laughing norm
26:43
it was the b side i love ringo starr
26:47
some of our most famous yeah famous
26:49
stars have had
26:50
inauspicious beginnings yes in korea
26:53
this is exciting they sell a one a day
26:56
banana pack
26:57
so it's five bananas in underneath
27:00
plastic and they're all ripened
27:02
one of them is really ripe one of them
27:03
is almost ripe one of them is not that
27:05
ripe one of them's not ripe at all and
27:07
the other one's almost unripe
27:08
wow but then every day at the end of the
27:10
day they're completely ripe
27:12
well they've in japan they have invented
27:14
an edible banana peel so you now just
27:16
eat the banana
27:17
this is a big thing online people keep
27:19
saying it's really good for you
27:20
yeah it's called a monkey banana it
27:22
makes you healthy it protects your heart
27:23
because insomnia and depression
27:24
stops people slipping over people
27:26
slipping over there's no there's no
27:28
evidence for anything except it's
27:29
stopping people slipping over
27:31
it's it's your body even if there are
27:33
nutrients in there
27:34
which there may be your body won't be
27:36
able to absorb them and also if you
27:38
don't wash it really carefully you'll
27:39
probably get pesticide
27:40
yeah so don't eat a banana peel i can't
27:42
believe we're having to say this
27:44
imagine if do you think because that
27:45
feels like the early kind of modern
27:48
comedy if we got rid of banana peels or
27:50
started eating them and comedy died
27:53
oh wow i reckon it would i reckon that
27:55
would trigger the end of all
27:57
comedy if we lost the slapstick banana
27:59
people that's the moment in history
28:00
where the universe is
28:01
when yeah there's a universe out there
28:03
where comedy doesn't happen yeah because
28:04
we
28:05
ate our appeals right wow
28:08
or maybe will be that moment in history
28:10
i don't know maybe this podcast is that
28:12
moment in history where comedy doesn't
28:14
happen
28:17
okay it is time for fact number three
28:19
and that is
28:20
celcinski yeah my fact this week is that
28:23
nobel prize winner barry marshall has
28:25
developed a belt that senses stomach
28:27
rumblings
28:28
inspired by his son who's a seismologist
28:31
who makes devices that sense vibrations
28:33
on the ocean floor
28:35
uh which i just find so cool as a kind
28:38
of really random crossover of two
28:40
totally different industries
28:41
so he's just around the table with his
28:42
son one day saying i've got to look into
28:44
this stomach rumbling thing he's
28:45
investigating ibs and he wants to know
28:47
how to diagnose it quickly
28:49
and you know his son just says well i've
28:51
got this instrument that senses
28:52
vibrations
28:53
on the floor of the sea you want to try
28:55
that and he has and he's made this belt
28:57
so should you just first say who barry
28:59
marshall is because he's a bit of a hero
29:01
isn't he yeah he's a deal
29:02
he's nobel prizes for an awesome reason
29:04
yes uh so
29:05
he got a nobel prize in 2005 because he
29:08
proved that stomach ulcers which
29:09
everyone used to say was caused by
29:11
stress
29:11
and i think a lot of people kind of
29:12
still do say that he approved they were
29:14
caused by bacteria
29:15
um and he did that by uh swallowing a
29:17
whole bunch of bacteria and giving
29:19
himself a stomach ulcer
29:21
which i think we've said before and that
29:22
proved that that did it and that means
29:24
you can cure stomach ulcers with
29:25
antibiotics and then that has
29:27
massively reduced stomach cancer in the
29:30
western world
29:30
and he did it against the medical
29:33
establishment really because
29:34
you're not meant to self-experiment and
29:36
he was desperately trying to get it
29:39
experimented on
29:40
subjects who had it but the medical
29:41
board said no not possible so he went
29:43
home and he was like
29:44
he put on some toast or something it was
29:46
like a broth was it yeah it was against
29:48
his wife as well he was very very upset
29:50
about it really
29:51
and he said he never told her because it
29:53
was one of the occasions when it would
29:54
be easier to get forgiveness than get
29:56
permission
29:57
but she got really upset about it
29:59
because she thought she she believed him
30:01
of course that it was a bacteria that
30:02
caused it
30:03
and she thought that by giving himself
30:04
it it would give it to the whole family
30:06
and all that kind of stuff
30:07
yeah fair but you can't you don't kiss
30:09
with your stomach
30:11
you don't smoosh stomachs together i'm
30:13
sure there's some sort of exotic
30:15
practice
30:15
[Laughter]
30:17
it's so interesting how everyone thought
30:18
that bacteria couldn't live in the
30:20
stomach
30:20
so that's why it can't be a bacterial
30:23
thing when you have a stomach ulcer
30:24
but also there was no incentive really
30:27
to discover a cure because antacids
30:29
you know things which neutralize the
30:31
acid in your stomach
30:32
were very popular and also you have to
30:34
keep taking them for life yeah and also
30:36
they do
30:36
kind of help yeah quite a lot don't they
30:39
so
30:39
it was almost like like you say not that
30:41
much incentive because
30:43
the industry was huge but also it was
30:44
kind of doing quite good it deals with
30:45
the symptoms it just doesn't deal with
30:47
the ulcer
30:47
yeah because at the start of the 20th
30:49
century a hundred percent of mankind had
30:51
this bacteria in their stomach
30:52
wow wow that's great yeah it's
30:54
impressive he deserved it he deserves
30:56
christ
30:57
okay can i just say he also developed
30:59
this he did this and he had
31:01
tried it on a few patients so it wasn't
31:02
a complete shot in the dark but he had
31:04
to
31:04
do it on himself i can't remember
31:06
exactly why but it was after six months
31:08
of unsuccessfully trying to give piglets
31:10
stomach ulcers yes
31:12
so maybe he's not a great dude after all
31:14
he only did it to the evil piglets
31:18
and the other thing is that um
31:20
heliobacter pylori which is a bacteria
31:23
is kind of useful in the body so it
31:26
modulates your immune system
31:28
and a lot of people think it stops your
31:30
immune system from being too hyper
31:31
reactive
31:32
and perhaps and that this is really
31:34
going out on a limb now that we don't
31:36
have as much of it you're more likely to
31:37
get allergies and stuff like that
31:39
and ibs and ibs which is not trying to
31:41
cure so there is an idea of
31:42
um reintroducing heliobacter pylori
31:46
if you could somehow make it so it
31:47
doesn't give you ulcers then you can put
31:49
it back in your body if you could kind
31:50
of genetically modify it
31:52
so he's now frantically digging up the
31:54
recipe for that broth
31:54
[Laughter]
31:57
so he's not trying to cure ibs which is
31:59
possibly
32:00
caused by the thing he cured what's his
32:03
cure for ibs going to give us that's
32:05
what i want to know
32:06
he keeps keeping himself in work um but
32:08
ips is a real problem right that feels a
32:10
bit like stomach ulcers
32:11
were in that no one really knows what's
32:13
causing it and it's very hard to
32:15
diagnose
32:16
and the diagnosis is quite invasive
32:18
usually
32:19
um and so what he's developed is this
32:21
belt and it records what he calls the
32:23
creaks and undulations of the gut and
32:25
recognizes the sonic signature of ibs
32:27
which
32:28
it's so complicated because the gut's so
32:30
long and so much is happening in it
32:31
that the human ear can't do that you
32:33
can't listen to someone's gut and no
32:34
they've got ibs
32:35
but by showing a sort of robotic belt
32:38
former ibs sufferers
32:39
and training it to recognize it you can
32:42
do that um and yeah he's done that and
32:43
actually he was inspired first of all by
32:45
his son
32:45
who introduced him to the idea of these
32:47
vibrations on the ocean floor
32:49
and then a colleague showed him a kind
32:51
of shot bought acoustic device that he
32:53
was using for detecting termites under
32:54
houses and he
32:56
used the design of that for the belt so
32:58
was using termites and seismology
33:00
it's well listen seismology has given us
33:02
quite a lot of
33:03
non-seismology based inventions uh
33:06
i think we have a lot to thank
33:08
seismologists for um so for example
33:10
there is a guy
33:12
called how did i know you had an example
33:13
[Laughter]
33:15
andy hildebrand now he was a research
33:18
scientist in the oil industry and he
33:20
developed software for processing the
33:22
data
33:23
from reflection seismology so it was a
33:26
method
33:26
i'm reading the sentence out basically
33:28
from this article a method of estimating
33:30
properties of earth's
33:31
uh subsurface using reflective seismic
33:34
waves so that was his job
33:36
what he then invented off the back of
33:39
that
33:39
technology was auto tuning for the music
33:42
industry
33:43
when you hear auto tuning it is from
33:46
andy hildebrand who is a seismologist
33:48
that is very very very cool yeah and
33:51
also i can't remember his name but
33:52
um it was a seismologist whose
33:54
technology for predicting earthquakes
33:56
was then used for predicting who's going
33:57
to win the american presidential
33:59
election
34:00
oh yeah nate silva not nate silver it's
34:02
a guy who's been doing it he's predicted
34:04
the last
34:04
like five presidents basically of the
34:06
united states using
34:07
this using his seismology technology
34:10
well it was quite a
34:11
seismic event this last election wasn't
34:13
it andy i feel queasy
34:16
it wasn't i guess you could say it was a
34:18
landslide
34:19
which is similar to an earthquake it
34:20
wasn't really because he didn't win the
34:22
popular vote that's true
34:23
yeah but it was it's so interesting
34:25
paul's not saying anything but you can
34:26
see him regretting coming off his own
34:28
off the back of these last two let's
34:30
talk about auto tune then do you use our
34:32
tattoo
34:36
but that massively changed music didn't
34:38
they auto-tune
34:40
for the for the better off for the worst
34:41
that's the question i don't know exactly
34:43
better if you're a chair i've well i've
34:44
heard yeah well
34:46
cher used
34:57
[Laughter]
35:01
sure can't be expected to have your kind
35:02
of range that's fair
35:04
but yeah i think um it's now overused
35:07
yeah it's it's in it seems to be in a
35:08
lot of
35:09
r b and rap songs when it doesn't
35:11
necessarily need to be
35:12
is it a bit rude to accuse someone of
35:15
using auto
35:16
tune not these tears but yeah it would
35:18
it would have been and i i heard a few
35:20
rumors about
35:21
auto tune um peter andre please don't
35:24
say that
35:26
peter is of a higher caliber than that
35:35
[Laughter]
35:37
so who were the rumors about are you
35:38
allowed to say or not well no
35:41
no when when we were making our first
35:43
record there was there was a few rumors
35:45
going around that that our producer paul
35:48
edward at the time
35:49
um said that there's some going on
35:52
somebody that he'd worked with
35:54
right yeah i want saying kiss kiss he
35:56
was
35:57
perhaps elaborating on on but someone
35:59
who you wouldn't expect is it like no
36:01
somebody would expect somebody
36:02
somebody who wasn't very good at singing
36:04
essentially and they were a massive
36:06
producer
36:06
well this is it he's now adele and you
36:08
know whoever he's
36:10
just trying to get you to name people's
36:11
work it's adele
36:13
we got it adele really can't sing have
36:15
you seen it
36:17
it wasn't adele it must be obvious when
36:19
people sing live though right
36:20
but this is the thing when yeah there
36:22
are a few people who are pretty ropey
36:24
live and in the studio they are using
36:26
using the electronic help so is there no
36:28
way of using
36:29
see i really don't know about it is
36:31
there no way of slightly tweaking your
36:33
voice live on stage
36:34
as in oh there will be singing into your
36:37
phone
36:38
no this is it there will be a way of
36:39
doing it live as well because it's just
36:41
an
36:41
electronic feed going down into a mixer
36:44
that then comes out of there
36:45
because i've i've seen those fun toys
36:48
that you can get where you can make
36:49
yourself sound like darth vader just by
36:50
talking into that
36:52
slowly yeah but you don't get britney
36:54
spears sounding like chewbacca
36:57
because they've got another wrong
36:58
setting yeah that's an auto-tuned
37:00
cock-up
37:01
at its worst i think that would
37:03
kickstart her career
37:04
i think she's doing all right britney
37:07
yeah she's still massive in america
37:09
she's on like x factor and stuff uh she
37:11
does she does vegas
37:13
that's the thing after people lose that
37:16
sort of
37:17
you know the number ones start becoming
37:18
number tens or whatever
37:20
yeah um it feels like the graveyard's a
37:22
lot of pop stars basically
37:23
it's about 400 shows a year yeah this is
37:25
it yeah then you're successful
37:27
it's the graveyard slot critically
37:29
people will dismiss you then
37:30
but obviously you're raking it in and
37:32
it's yeah true showbiz
37:34
can i just say to the people of vegas
37:35
we're ready for that [ __ ] we're so ready
37:38
so some stuff about digestion yes please
37:40
i was reading
37:41
um i do you know that 95 of the body's
37:44
serotonin is produced in the gut so you
37:47
know we think of serotonin as
37:49
the you know the hormone that's produced
37:50
by the brain and it makes us really
37:51
happy and if you're on antidepressants
37:53
it helps you to release it
37:54
but 95 is reduced in the gut and i just
37:57
i find actually this whole thing
37:59
amazing because i don't think that
38:01
medicine has at all come to terms with
38:02
how the brain is connected to the rest
38:04
of the body you basically have a second
38:06
brain in your gut
38:07
you've got a second brain in your gut
38:08
and of course it's interacting so much
38:10
with how you feel so you get butterflies
38:12
in your stomach that's you feeling
38:13
nervous because
38:15
you've got this whole nervous system and
38:16
it's a completely independent nervous
38:18
system so it's the enteric nervous
38:20
system
38:20
um and they actually found something
38:22
really recently which is
38:24
uh the vagus nerve is the main
38:29
wavelength
38:30
of vagus
38:33
[Laughter]
38:40
so i think it's fine both um it's the
38:43
vegas or the vagus nerve and it's the
38:46
main nerve that runs from your brain
38:47
to your organs basically carrying all
38:49
the information there so we think that
38:50
we
38:51
think of stuff in our brain and then
38:52
it's carried through the nerves to our
38:53
various parts of our body to tell it
38:55
what to do
38:56
uh scientists found out recently that 90
38:58
of the
38:59
fibers that are in that nerve are
39:01
actually carrying information from the
39:02
gut
39:03
back to the brain and so it's our gut is
39:05
telling our brain what to do
39:07
in a like in a sense i mean this is like
39:09
an amazing thing that scientists have
39:11
just realized
39:12
messages are being sent nervous also
39:16
because we've been saying that people
39:17
have a gut feeling for things for all
39:19
all that time but actually it turns out
39:20
that that's a reality
39:22
yeah viva las vegas that's what i say
39:27
don't say a joke that means i'm going to
39:28
cut this out because it is my interest
39:31
just with the journey of the of how
39:33
things are digested in the gut
39:34
um there's a thing that we put in our in
39:36
our latest book um which is a new app
39:38
that scientists are working on where
39:40
you can track via your app um the
39:43
creation of a fart
39:44
inside your body so it follows it
39:47
follows the fart from its
39:49
beginnings all the way to the exit and
39:51
um
39:52
is that what you call your backside
39:56
hey nice exit
40:00
but yeah so that's an app that's uh
40:02
hopefully going to be available well
40:03
i i'd like to have it i'd just like to
40:06
know when i need to leave a room but
40:07
like at the last minute
40:08
like oh it's near the exit let's i can i
40:10
can hang out here till then and the idea
40:12
of that
40:12
is that um doctors might be able to use
40:14
it to see what kind of foods cause
40:16
gas and you know
40:20
it's not so that you can time watching a
40:21
film thinking
40:23
right i've got 96 minutes so we can
40:25
watch these films before i need to
40:28
i'm sorry andy do you never fart during
40:30
the movie it's like
40:31
sorry i can't watch this movie because
40:33
it's two hours long and i actually got
40:34
one brewing i need to uh
40:46
or you could use it in an alternative
40:47
fashion if you were like a school boy
40:49
prankster
40:58
which is what seemed to happen there
40:59
seemed to be some people at my school
41:01
who
41:01
were extremely talented at breaking wind
41:04
at the right time just to undercut
41:06
what was going on in the school assembly
41:08
andrew bird
41:09
he had a and he had a particular torn as
41:11
well
41:13
you weren't you weren't named the auto
41:14
tuners but you're grossing off andrew
41:16
bird weren't you
41:17
i've heard that andrew burn auto tunes
41:20
andrew bird is unlikely to be at the
41:22
next festival about to lynch me
41:24
behind behind though you're saying he
41:27
won't sue because he's not got music
41:28
industry muscle behind it
41:29
exactly if he does come after you to
41:31
lynch you'll hear him coming
41:35
um do you know something really
41:36
interesting so you know endoscopies
41:38
where
41:38
you i guess is it's a way of looking
41:40
into your insides basically by getting a
41:42
big tube down you
41:43
and getting this look around or up you
41:46
the first endoscopies
41:48
um who do you think you go through the
41:50
excess
41:53
the first ever endoscopy uh where you
41:55
have to shove something down
41:56
through someone's mouth to try and look
41:58
at their insides who do you think it was
41:59
tried on
42:00
it's not a specific person it's a type
42:01
of person henry oh
42:03
someone with a child because they have a
42:06
shorter
42:07
oh yeah no right is it ace oh i think
42:10
i've
42:10
i've worked it out and i know what it
42:15
yes is um so yeah this was in 1868 adolf
42:18
kussmaul
42:19
uh made his patient who was a sword
42:20
swallow swallow a 47 centimeter tube
42:23
because obviously they've got those big
42:24
throats
42:24
and it was used a bunch of times in the
42:26
future the first ecg ever in 1906 was
42:29
done on a sword swallower
42:31
eventually they realized oh maybe we
42:32
shouldn't put the camera at the end of a
42:33
sword
42:34
[Laughter]
42:37
but they could do some surgery while
42:39
they were in there
42:43
uh we should move on to the final fact
42:44
just very quickly yeah uh barry marshall
42:47
what's he doing now
42:48
apart from his um his belt thing uh he's
42:51
also written a new book
42:53
that comes out next year um it's called
42:55
how to win a nobel prize
42:58
and it's a middle-grade adventure about
43:00
a girl who stumbles on a secret meeting
43:03
of nobel prize winners
43:04
including albert einstein and marie
43:06
curie and she travels through time
43:08
learning the secrets behind some of the
43:10
most world's most important scientific
43:12
discoveries
43:13
that sounds awesome sounds good middle
43:15
grade you mean the sort of the school
43:16
years
43:16
i actually don't know what that means i
43:18
think so instead of like for elementary
43:20
school kids
43:21
because the way you said it it made it
43:22
sound like it was of reasonable quality
43:24
but not great
43:26
i haven't read it so i don't know it's
43:29
all right but stick to belts
43:30
that's your main job that sounds
43:32
horrible it sounds like it's a way to
43:34
try and convince
43:35
kids that you're having fun but actually
43:36
you're just obviously learning what
43:38
i'd got that's our whole job oh yeah
43:41
good point
43:42
i try to describe this every week
43:44
[Music]
43:47
okay it is time for our final fact of
43:49
the show and that is
43:50
james okay my fact this week is that one
43:53
building that burned down in the great
43:54
fire of london
43:55
was a public toilet that could be used
43:57
by 128 people at the same time
44:00
same time it's just as well
44:04
you know if you're looking at pluses for
44:06
the great fire of london
44:08
there can't be many but that might have
44:09
been one of them well some people say
44:11
about the great fire that it was a plus
44:13
because they could rebuild those bits of
44:14
london don't they but i don't know i
44:16
think sounds incredible we don't have
44:17
enough public toilets in the world
44:19
no and in the uk definitely and um i
44:21
think one that could be used by 128
44:23
people will be quite a good thing
44:24
when you say they use it at the same
44:25
time it's not like a 3-2-1 everyone
44:27
unloads
44:28
i mean you could do it like that if you
44:30
want but it's basically it had 128 seats
44:33
64 for men and 64 for women which is
44:36
quite progressive at the time
44:37
which you wouldn't get today i'm sure
44:40
and it would empty into the thames it
44:42
was on cheap side
44:43
in london i read that after the fire it
44:45
was replaced
44:46
by another public toilet which instead
44:49
of having 128 seats had 12.
44:51
yeah so what i want to know is does that
44:53
mean that in the
44:54
in the old one everyone was really
44:56
squished together or in the new one did
44:58
people have loads and loads of space
44:59
well i think the new one also had six
45:00
flats on top of it
45:04
um yeah but it was between two rivers
45:06
wasn't it because they needed a lot of
45:08
water flowing through
45:09
yes so it was between some two tributes
45:12
of the thames
45:13
how did the fire burn it down with all
45:15
that water flowing through you would
45:16
have thought that would be the perfect
45:17
barrier
45:18
yes you would think that but it wasn't
45:20
it would burn down this structure
45:22
i think um like a lot of things did it
45:24
was called whittington's
45:25
longhouse and it was named after dick
45:27
whittington
45:28
because it was money that he left after
45:30
being there that
45:31
built it and dick whittington this is uh
45:34
for people overseas
45:35
uh is uh i haven't heard of him
45:37
personally not coming from here um he's
45:40
dick whittington and his cat is a sort
45:42
of famous story it's a pantomime that's
45:44
done a lot in this country so he's a
45:45
very
45:46
known character who might not be known
45:48
for his toilet well most people in
45:49
britain i would say
45:51
um would think that he was a fictional
45:53
character yeah because it's like from a
45:54
pantomime and stuff like that but it
45:56
turns out that he's real he was the
45:57
mayor of london quite a few times
45:59
and he didn't have a cat to my knowledge
46:02
i don't think he had a cat
46:03
but he left loads and loads of money
46:05
behind and did all this great stuff
46:07
about toilets and lots of
46:08
really yeah things that he built and
46:11
they think that because of all those
46:12
great things that he built that's why he
46:14
became such a hero in london and that's
46:15
why all the stories got written about
46:17
him am i right in saying that
46:18
dick whittington itself not being
46:20
richard whittington
46:21
is a sort of inspired by character as
46:24
opposed it's meant to be literally the
46:25
mayor
46:25
presumably nate well in their story he
46:28
um
46:28
is the mayor isn't he yeah he becomes
46:30
london at the end as in he gets called
46:32
to be mayor or something like that he
46:34
has a voice saying
46:36
he goes to london to make his fortune
46:37
because the streets are paved with gold
46:39
and then i think i usually fell asleep
46:40
or insisted on leaving at that point in
46:41
the pantomime you missed the bit whereas
46:43
paved with [ __ ] from his toilets i also
46:47
left the pantomime at that point but
46:48
that's only because i could feel there
46:49
was a fart on its way
46:50
[Laughter]
46:52
um so the great fire of london i
46:56
actually had my debunked myth
46:59
rebunked reading about this you rebunked
47:01
something yeah
47:02
okay so what's the myth this is the one
47:04
about people dying yeah
47:05
okay i had so how many people died i
47:07
thought it was like four people died
47:09
yeah so i think most people think now um
47:11
hardly anyone died four or six people
47:13
died in the great fire of london
47:14
actually there was a historian who's
47:16
written a book on it and done a lot of
47:17
research on it he says
47:18
loads of people probably died right yeah
47:21
but the censuses were very bad
47:23
or um the public records were very bad
47:25
parish records
47:27
but there's evidence like the number of
47:29
burials suddenly
47:30
shot up so they went up by a third in
47:32
the graveyard that was closest to it
47:34
and the average age at death doubled in
47:37
that month
47:38
which implies that older people are
47:41
getting killed more easily which makes
47:42
sense if there's a bad fire young people
47:44
going to scarpa whereas older people are
47:45
going to be
47:46
a bit buggered um and basically we think
47:48
maybe that's really really interesting
47:50
and lots of first-hand accounts
47:51
say um you talk about like bloodied
47:54
bodies in the street and stuff and once
47:55
it was taken to france which is probably
47:57
exaggerated but at the same time it's
47:58
plausible that we don't have
48:00
all the records wow yeah i mean we
48:02
basically have to re-edit q-i now
48:05
i heard is this a myth and sorry for
48:08
bringing a depressing fact to the table
48:09
but
48:10
oh as opposed to those people who just
48:12
died wow yeah
48:13
um more people died than you think no
48:15
that just feels more i think historical
48:17
this is a bit more recent
48:18
the fire monument um for the fire of
48:21
life
48:22
the monument um there's a fact which i
48:25
don't know if it's definitely true is
48:26
that
48:27
they they had to put a lot of netting
48:29
and so forth around it because more
48:30
people
48:31
if we're going for the original stat of
48:32
four people dying and the more people
48:34
have died from
48:35
jumping off there that were said to have
48:37
done that
48:38
definitely right but now it seems like
48:40
anna has
48:41
yeah re-d re re-debunked it
48:44
um have you guys heard of porcelain
48:46
palace nope this is in
48:48
chong ching china and uh this is the
48:51
city chongqing
48:52
and it is the world's largest public
48:54
toilet complex
48:55
in the world um it's at
48:58
foreigners street amusement park
49:02
that's apparently what it's called um
49:04
and it's a
49:05
it's designed to look uh it's got a sort
49:07
of ancient egyptian art
49:08
theme to the whole thing but it has a
49:10
thousand toilets and urinals in it so
49:12
it is a palace of the toilet yeah it's
49:15
the largest in the world currently can
49:17
all a thousand people go at the same
49:18
time i guess i believe so yeah
49:19
yeah the inventor of the first public
49:22
toilets the
49:23
um the ones at the great exhibition the
49:26
first public talks in britain
49:27
sorry yep apart from the longhouse which
49:30
was also a public toilet
49:31
yeah that's right yeah the first modern
49:33
ones yeah all right yeah him
49:34
yeah he was called george jennings and
49:38
uh he had 15 children
49:40
wow i have a theory that he may have
49:43
developed the public toilet just so that
49:45
he
49:45
could go to the loo somewhere because
49:47
the bathroom was always busy because he
49:49
had 15 children yeah
49:50
okay if you paid a penny you got to go
49:53
to the loo but you also got
49:54
a towel a comb and a shoe shine
49:59
yeah i don't know if it was all while
50:00
you were sitting on the loo but you're
50:02
being
50:02
having your shoes shined in so you don't
50:04
get a shoe shine do you someone should
50:06
challenge your shoes exactly yeah um
50:08
do you get a coal i don't think you
50:09
should just comb your hair i think you
50:11
get
50:12
comb i think someone comes to your heart
50:13
that sounds like someone comes to your
50:14
head or you get to use the comb maybe
50:15
maybe there's a communal comb
50:17
what a disturbing time to spend on the
50:18
loo with someone toweling you down
50:20
someone shining your shoes and someone
50:21
cutting your hair
50:23
you wouldn't be able to go um the first
50:26
she-we
50:26
was actually invented in 1898 or the
50:28
first kind of
50:30
one that i could find a she-we is i
50:32
think women's always use them in
50:33
festivals it's kind of like a
50:34
co upside-down cone-shaped thing that
50:36
women can wee into and use it like a
50:38
urinal but also yeah so
50:40
uh stand up to to we yeah so you can
50:43
stand up to we
50:43
like men do but um it was invented in
50:46
1898 and it was called the euronet
50:48
and it was cheaper it was more space
50:50
efficient
50:51
and so a few local councils especially
50:53
quite a few in london
50:54
installed them but women didn't want to
50:56
use them because it was kind of improper
50:58
so like there was one in portsmouth but
50:59
women used to flee in horror when they
51:01
saw it apparently
51:05
frightening things they were the modern
51:08
shoe is something you carry around with
51:10
you
51:10
yes and you use it like a penis not like
51:12
a urinal yes
51:14
these ones these ones are more of a
51:18
urinal than a penis so they were
51:19
installed and there was a curtain that
51:21
went around them and they were much
51:22
closer together
51:23
okay i need to hope my mother's not
51:25
listening to this podcast
51:27
hang on is it like a urinal with a very
51:29
long um sort of
51:30
front bottom bit as it were and then
51:34
wow yeah that doesn't sound hygienic
51:37
or i think i would run in horror
51:41
in terror yeah so i looked up some other
51:44
other buildings that were in london at
51:46
the time of the great fire
51:47
oh yeah so one of the ones actually so
51:49
this is one that survived but it's just
51:50
an incredible building that was in mid
51:52
17th century london
51:53
uh it was called none such house and it
51:56
was on london bridge
51:57
so you know london bridge used to be
51:58
lined with shops and buildings which i
52:00
find incredible
52:01
yeah none such house was a renaissance
52:04
palace four stories high in the middle
52:08
of the bridge
52:09
it was massive you have to look up
52:10
pictures of it so good i'll try and put
52:12
one up on my twitter feed so it just
52:13
lurched over the temp
52:14
the whole thames you know sorry you'll
52:16
try to put one up on your twitter feed
52:17

52:20
app

uh
00:18
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:22
no such thing as a fish
00:23
a weekly podcast this week coming to you
00:26
live from our book of the year
00:28
2018 tour in nottingham
00:36
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
00:39
here with anna chazinski
00:40
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
00:43
and once again
00:44
we have gathered around the microphones
00:45
with our four favorite facts from the
00:47
last seven days
00:48
and in no particular order here we go
00:52
starting with you anna chazinski
00:56
yes my fact this week is that old
00:58
european
00:59
malaria remedies included throwing the
01:01
patient headfirst into a bush
01:03
in the hope that he'd get out quickly
01:04
enough to leave the fever behind
01:09
yeah just got tangled up in there can't
01:11
get out and you scarper
01:13
that was how you did it and this was
01:15
used all the way up until the 17th
01:16
century basically until the 1600s
01:19
no one knew how to cure malaria and uh
01:21
so they just made up a lot of wacky
01:23
wacky i wonder what they thought
01:25
happened to the malaria in the bush
01:27
does it stay there like if you went
01:28
through a walk through the bush yeah
01:29
that is a cup
01:30
it is a bit like that so it's called
01:32
passing through and it's kind of an old
01:34
folklore thing they did it for lots of
01:36
different diseases
01:37
sometimes would be a hole in a tree or a
01:39
hole in a stone or something like that
01:40
and you would pass through the hole
01:42
and the idea is you would leave the
01:43
disease behind you and actually it
01:45
happened
01:45
in america they didn't perhaps they
01:47
didn't have trees or stones
01:49
but they used to climb under the belly
01:50
of a donkey okay
01:52
and the idea is you would leave your
01:53
disease behind and is it that it gets so
01:55
distracted by the insides of the tree or
01:57
the belly the donkey that it goes oh
01:59
look and it
02:00
loses sight of it i think so i don't
02:02
think they really knew what was going on
02:04
yeah malaria is not like me just
02:06
distracted by any idiotic thing
02:09
but yeah so of course the as soon as the
02:12
tree that
02:13
has quinine in it was discovered
02:14
suddenly everyone could be cured of
02:16
malaria and that was in well this is by
02:18
western europeans it was discovered in
02:19
the
02:20
17th century so they went over to peru
02:23
and they found the indigenous people
02:24
were just using the bark
02:26
from this tree called the kinchona tree
02:29
i think that's how you pronounce it
02:30
and that just cures it and so they
02:32
started using it and then all their
02:33
problems were over no more running in
02:35
and out of bushes
02:36
but yeah it was a tough time up until
02:37
then it was because there's quite a few
02:39
other things they tried as well as the
02:40
bush thing wasn't it wasn't just the
02:42
bush thing
02:42
um so eating an onion with the word amen
02:45
on it with the wood
02:46
ah then was this for malaria to get rid
02:49
of it
02:50
well it didn't work either but you can't
02:52
i mean very few
02:53
onions have the word our men on them so
02:56
if you can find one of those i think you
02:57
deserve to be cured
02:59
yeah you were allowed to write it on
03:00
yourself oh fine
03:02
uh smearing cow manure on your body uh
03:05
drinking
03:05
opium laced beer that was quite a good
03:07
one actually
03:09
there was a guy called albertus magnus
03:11
he was the dominican uh
03:12
scholar and he said allowing insects to
03:15
devour 77
03:16
small cakes made from a dough prepared
03:19
by mixing flour and the patient's urine
03:21
right nice just on the beer one that you
03:24
said
03:25
um no no no
03:28
you don't you kind of blast over
03:30
slightly 77
03:31
allowing the flies to eat 77 small cakes
03:34
any insects
03:35
oh fine okay yeah do you have to open a
03:38
tiny greg's
03:39
for them which says we have urine cakes
03:42
inside
03:43
can i just say for the people at greg's
03:44
i'm sure you don't sell urine cakes i've
03:46
never
03:47
they're never sponsoring us james we can
03:49
say what we like
03:51
actually cake guy was a guy called
03:53
albertus magnus wasn't it who was uh
03:56
this guy in the 13th century who came up
03:57
with loads of wacky cures and another
03:58
one of his for malaria
04:00
was that you could cut a chip off a
04:02
block that a criminal had been executed
04:04
on and then rub it all over your body
04:06
if you were suffering from it um and
04:08
that scared off the malaria because it
04:09
reminded it of
04:11
of the penalty for being evil you know
04:12
it reminded the evil malaria
04:15
that maybe it'll be hanged one day if it
04:17
doesn't go away
04:18
and that's where we get the phrase a
04:19
chip off the old block on which a
04:22
criminal was
04:22
executed exactly yes i've got a real
04:26
cure for malaria okay uh viagra can
04:29
fight malaria did you know this
04:30
yeah so okay um the malaria parasite
04:34
gets into your body and it goes
04:35
uh into red blood cells for a while it
04:38
spends a while in there in your bone
04:39
marrow
04:40
and the spleen job is to filter out um
04:43
you know
04:43
old or dead or stiff uh red blood cells
04:47
and so the malaria normally uh sneakily
04:50
passes through
04:51
however and that means it spreads
04:53
through the blood however
04:54
if a patient takes viagra the infected
04:57
blood cells
04:58
themselves stiffen up
05:03
it literally makes your blood cells go
05:05
stiff yes we all know that about
05:07
biography
05:08
i knew that it made other things go
05:10
stiff i just didn't know that it made
05:11
the actual blood cells in your body go
05:12
stiff
05:13
i think it's true if you dilute viagra
05:15
and put it in a plant pot it makes the
05:17
plant go stiff
05:18
get away i didn't know individual cells
05:21
getting individual little erections
05:23
exactly but it does it will present the
05:25
mosquitoes with a big
05:27
target as well yeah to go how come when
05:30
you eat viagra then it doesn't make your
05:32
tongue stiff
05:35
i think that no in fairness that's quite
05:36
a good point that's a great point
05:38
how come basically anyone who's taken
05:40
back at their whole body just isn't
05:42
completely scared
05:44
i don't know walking in as a starfish
05:48
all right
05:52
starfish have got five limbs and you've
05:53
only got oh no yeah
05:57
[Applause]
06:04
anyway dr butler there was a famous
06:07
doctor called dr butler
06:08
and his way of treating malaria was by
06:11
dropping people through a trapdoor on
06:12
london bridge into the polluted river
06:14
thames
06:16
there used to be a trap door in london
06:18
bridge
06:19
i mean that's i didn't think of that but
06:21
yeah that is weird isn't it
06:22
wow so would you have to lure them onto
06:25
the trapdoor
06:26
would they will they know they're going
06:27
to be dropped through the trapdoor
06:29
or does he say pay me the money and i'll
06:31
i'll show you where the cure is
06:33
yeah it's just over here i think it's a
06:36
really good question i really don't know
06:37
because this guy wasn't great he had a
06:39
habit of treating the epilepsy by firing
06:41
a gun beside the victim's head
06:45
he was the position to james the first
06:47
so he was like you know he's a real deal
06:49
well no he wasn't the real deal but yeah
06:51
but you said that like james the first
06:52
who famously lived for 700 years
06:55
how did he die 26 malaria
06:58
hey do you know um the oldest example of
07:02
malaria that we found in a human that we
07:04
have now uh no
07:06
it's tutankhamun is it yeah they've
07:08
recently discovered
07:10
a few years ago now that tutankhamun
07:12
actually had
07:13
um types of not even one type a few
07:15
types of malaria inside him
07:17
um and that would have contributed to
07:19
his immune system going down so
07:20
they don't think it's what killed him
07:22
but they think it's what it you know
07:24
added
07:24
to his problems of his feet being bad
07:27
and and whatever it was we don't
07:28
actually know what killed him i think he
07:30
was possibly crushed by a hippo but
07:32
it's it's possible that the malaria
07:35
knocked back the reflexes it's possible
07:37
it's possible
07:39
everything's possible you know maybe in
07:41
the sarcophagus he was very very flat
07:45
he was around syphilis didn't he he had
07:47
everything tootin car moon he was the
07:48
first
07:49
try he had the first socks and sandals i
07:51
think in the world
07:52
he just always on it in fact malaria can
07:55
cure syphilis
07:56
so maybe he had malaria to cure his
07:58
syphilis that's possible
07:59
so this is this is a genuine thing yeah
08:02
someone won the nobel prize for this
08:04
in this was in 1917 that it was
08:06
discovered and it was
08:07
an austrian physician called julius
08:09
wagner ureg
08:11
and he realized that um the fever that
08:13
could be induced by malaria
08:14
was hot enough to cure syphilis and um
08:17
so yeah he got the nobel prize and that
08:18
was used until 1940 if you had syphilis
08:20
then you would be infected deliberately
08:22
with malaria
08:23
and don't worry we've got some gonorrhea
08:25
for the malaria
08:27
and then we've got some dengue fever for
08:29
the gonorrhea it's like the old woman
08:31
who swallowed a fly
08:33
that was infected with malaria
08:37
there's a town a city in fact in
08:39
australia called townsville and
08:40
seven thousand families there have been
08:43
nannying
08:43
mosquitoes recently this is within the
08:46
last year or two
08:47
so they've all hosted a tub of mosquito
08:49
eggs in their backyard
08:50
and they've you know watered them and
08:52
kept them nice and cool and moist and
08:54
you know
08:54
nurtured them because those mosquitoes
08:57
have all been infected with the bacteria
08:59
which means they're less able to
09:01
transmit dengue and zika viruses
09:04
are they the ones where you're going to
09:05
try and get them to mate with the other
09:07
mosquitoes
09:08
exactly yeah really so they're br
09:10
they're breeding millions and millions
09:12
and everyone in the town has agreed to
09:13
it they said yeah great bring on the
09:15
the good mosquitoes that's good yeah
09:18
it's a rubbish pet if you ask for a dog
09:21
you've got a thousand mosquitoes really
09:23
pissed off
09:25
and it's wrapped up under the tree in
09:26
the shape of a dog but in fact
09:29
it's a thousand mosquitoes i mean you're
09:32
never gonna rap a dog are you
09:36
well people so people trying to find
09:38
malaria vaccines
09:39
still and it seems to be a habit to
09:42
infect yourself with malaria to work out
09:44
what works but also in the past people
09:46
infected other people
09:47
um so you know we often talk about
09:49
self-experimentation and it's kind of
09:50
these heroes who
09:52
poison themselves so they can work out
09:53
how to cure themselves
09:55
but there was a guy called dr gracie in
09:57
1898 who
09:58
really wanted to work out or really
10:00
wanted to prove that malaria was caused
10:02
by the anopheles mosquito which it is
10:04
and no one would believe him and so he
10:07
got a volunteer called mr sola
10:09
to be locked in a room in a tiny box for
10:12
11 days
10:13
filled with malaria-infected mosquitoes
10:15
until he got there 11 days
10:17
yeah it took yeah i mean oh wow and the
10:19
sad thing is we know that he got malaria
10:21
because it was a successful experiment
10:23
so this guy dr grazie was thrilled he
10:25
was like
10:26
now i've proven that the mosquito cures
10:28
malaria and in his case notes he writes
10:30
the rest of the history of mr solo's
10:32
case has no interest for us but it is
10:34
now certain that mosquitoes carry
10:35
malaria
10:36
so oh my god did not care yeah wow
10:39
i i was looking into um the idea of all
10:42
these old
10:43
you know suggestions for how you cure
10:44
things so outside of malaria there's
10:46
everyone every single disease seem to
10:48
have an eccentric thing
10:49
assigned to it and one of my favorite
10:51
ones is if you had swollen eyes
10:54
the way that they suggested doctors
10:55
suggested that you cure it
10:57
was that you tied a live crab to a
11:00
necklace
11:01
on your chest and you just let it live
11:03
there and
11:05
no i mean nobody will notice your
11:07
swollen eyes ever again
11:11
you just tie it around your neck and you
11:12
just have a live crab and that will cure
11:14
it
11:15
cool i didn't know swollen eyes was
11:17
really a
11:18
thing like around thanks to the um crap
11:21
cure that was so successful
11:23
that's why everyone's got normal eyes we
11:25
wiped it out yeah
11:26
yeah i was just saying before about
11:30
these mosquitoes in townville they're
11:32
going to send them out to have sex with
11:33
other mosquitoes
11:34
and i looked into um how mosquitoes have
11:37
sex
11:37
and one interesting thing i found is
11:40
it's the
11:40
females that bite you and so what some
11:43
male mosquitoes will do
11:44
is they'll find a human and then just
11:47
hang around the human
11:48
waiting for females to come wow so like
11:50
the human is just like a
11:52
singles bar or something that's like so
11:55
you might just have a little mosquito
11:57
flying around you like oh for god's sake
11:58
and he's just waiting for a bit of
12:00
lady mosquito wow it's quite risky then
12:04
landing on you though going to that bar
12:06
is a risky affair because i didn't
12:07
realize that's the dating scene
12:10
well you've got to put yourself out
12:11
there and they do but the reason they
12:14
suck our blood is to feed their eggs so
12:15
that's why it's only the females
12:17
but they as soon as they've sucked it
12:19
they're so full they can't move anymore
12:21
so every time a mosquito is sucking on
12:22
your blood it's risking its own life
12:24
because if you spot it and spot it in
12:25
time and that's why you often can
12:27
it can't really fly away it's got this
12:28
giant sack of blood now inside it
12:31
actually really worse for them than it
12:32
is for you um we're gonna have to move
12:34
on in a second to our next fact
12:37
do you want to say something andy or no
12:38
it's it's just a follow-on fact from
12:40
that really but it's not relevant enough
12:42
to
12:42
end this to end this section no it's
12:43
just well man bring it home
12:45
oh god it's not good it's not good
12:50
it's just that mosquitoes are victims as
12:52
much as we are because they're carrying
12:54
the malaria parasite
12:56
but there's a theory that mosquitoes are
12:58
actually made a bit crazy by having the
13:00
parasite inside them
13:01
and it makes them extra keen to suck
13:03
blood yeah so they would do it anyway
13:05
but the parasite makes them
13:06
basically like vampire mosquitoes and
13:09
the other thing is they get sick
13:10
mosquitoes get sick so it's a bit harsh
13:12
on them if they've got this malaria
13:13
parasite they're sick
13:15
and also we blame them for kind of
13:17
spreading it but mosquitoes don't get on
13:19
airplanes and fly around and stuff like
13:20
that
13:21
mosquitoes stay near their little place
13:23
where they live what happens is humans
13:25
get bitten
13:26
humans go somewhere else and they get
13:27
bitten again and make a poor mosquito
13:30
sick
13:30
and then that mosquito gets loads of
13:32
other people sick so it's the humans who
13:34
are doing all the spreading around the
13:35
pole mosquitoes are just flying around
13:36
getting sick and then getting squashed
13:39
the real enemy is man
13:51
okay it is time for fact number two and
13:54
that is my fact
13:55
my fact this week is that instead of
13:58
commissioning new wax works for their
14:00
exhibitions
14:00
the bible walk museum in ohio repurposes
14:04
discarded wax works from around the
14:06
world instead
14:07
as a result abel is played by prince
14:10
charles
14:11
king solomon is played by john travolta
14:14
and jesus is played by tom cruise
14:20
and i encourage you to go online and
14:21
look at these photos because
14:23
tom cruise makes a a good looking jesus
14:27
is it baby jesus like nativity scene in
14:29
his
14:30
in his manger and then you pull his
14:32
little rug down and it's tom cruise's
14:34
face
14:34
peeping out yeah it's top gun tom cruise
14:37
with the helmet
14:38
yeah like in mission impossible the way
14:40
he always pulls off the rubber mask and
14:42
it's tom cruise underneath
14:43
you thought it was the baby jesus well
14:45
you were wrong
14:47
really good boy yeah so this is this is
14:49
a very
14:50
almost famous in america museum um the
14:52
bible walk museum it was started by
14:54
pastor richard diamond
14:56
in 1983 he was inspired after he visited
14:59
another wax museum
15:00
not the greatest origin story sort of
15:03
expected almost
15:05
and um he uh he wanted to do it and tell
15:07
the story of the bible but he realized
15:09
how expensive it was to make new wax
15:11
work so he thought
15:12
there's a lot that are closing down all
15:13
the time there's a lot that are selling
15:15
them off at auction
15:16
let's just buy these and they tend to be
15:18
celebrities so yeah that's the thing
15:20
like no one knows what abel look like do
15:21
they
15:22
he might look like prince charles i
15:24
don't know yeah that's true they gave
15:26
prince charles when you see that photo a
15:28
sort of pudding bowl haircut
15:29
um so they mess with the hair they don't
15:32
leave the head untouched they still
15:33
dress them up and they
15:34
yeah and it looks really good and steve
15:36
mcqueen is there and george harrison is
15:38
there and marlon brando and bert
15:40
lancaster and clark gable
15:42
it's um that's an unbelievably cool
15:44
selection of people you just listed what
15:46
are you open with prince charles and
15:48
you've got your clark gables and steve
15:49
mcqueen's
15:50
are they all the wise men no they're all
15:52
just random bit parts there's no
15:54
they've got no starring roles surely
15:56
jesus is a starring role at a biblically
15:58
themed walk-through
15:59
museum there also there are quite a few
16:02
jesus
16:02
in there because it's all of jesus's
16:04
life and stuff like that so at one stage
16:06
prince philip is being resurrected
16:08
prince philip yeah they've got the age
16:12
of jesus
16:12
at resurrection wrong i think
16:14
historically
16:16
so do people not mind that no they
16:18
actively love it
16:19
and that's the problem that the bible
16:21
walk museum has is that they don't like
16:22
people liking that they think it takes
16:24
away from the story of jesus
16:26
so if you call up if anyone wants to
16:29
visit them don't call up and say hey can
16:30
you give us the celebrity tour they will
16:32
not let you into the museum
16:33
they they actively say you're not coming
16:35
now um
16:37
really i think so
16:40
i'm pretty sure i read that but they
16:41
they don't encourage that at all and
16:42
they want it to they
16:43
they do think it takes away i think
16:45
they've got to make up their minds
16:46
either be so stingy
16:48
you're going to repurpose tacky old wax
16:50
works for your museum or
16:51
four cow and don't complain about you
16:53
know i think if you're gonna do it
16:54
embrace it
16:55
like they did in fact so uh madam two
16:57
swords did a nativity thing in 2004
17:00
and they deliberately put loads of their
17:02
madame tussauds icons in
17:04
the nativity and so it had the three
17:07
wise men
17:07
were tony blair the duke of edinburgh
17:09
again and george bush
17:11
so this is all relevant people it was an
17:14
ironic thing i think
17:17
joseph and mary were posh and becks
17:20
this was really unpopular so yeah i was
17:22
gonna say did the um catholics and
17:24
christians not like that very much they
17:25
did not like it at all no the vatican
17:27
spokesman in britain said it was really
17:28
disrespectful to christianity
17:30
um and the the exhibition actually
17:32
closed before christmas because someone
17:34
got in so cued got their ticket
17:35
then went straight up to joseph and mary
17:37
and punch them in the face
17:41
wow do you know just speaking of madame
17:42
to swords do you know what the wax work
17:45
tom daley the the diver has that most
17:48
other wax works
17:49
so anatomically what he has that most
17:51
other wax works well he's
17:53
very strong isn't he does he have a
17:54
six-pack uh
17:57
i'm sure he does but so does prince
17:59
philip so that's not
18:02
i'm just trying to not go for the
18:03
obvious yeah does he have a lunch pack
18:07
no no he doesn't lunchbox i think that's
18:08
what it's called
18:10
are you sure i'm pretty sure yeah yeah
18:12
you confused me i thought you actually
18:13
meant someone packed it
18:15
does he have a packed lunch no it's
18:18
feet he has feet what the others don't
18:20
have feet
18:21
most wax works just have the shoes and
18:23
they have a very good
18:25
um sort of metal inside almost like what
18:27
you put a shoe horn into a shoe
18:29
so yeah donald trump's wax work for
18:31
example definitely no feet it's just his
18:33
shoes most of them i think you can get
18:35
by
18:35
just with um head and hands yeah so
18:38
after they've finished with so for
18:40
example what happened to david cameron
18:41
after he stopped being prime minister
18:42
was his madame tussauds waxwork was
18:45
uh decapitated and had his hands chopped
18:47
off and they were kept in storage
18:49
because
18:49
oh some applause
18:54
i don't think we're in that divide of
18:55
the country yet
19:00
um so yeah so they never they think they
19:02
never melt anyone down they never melt
19:03
down a head or hand because those are
19:05
the most difficult fiddly and the most
19:06
personal bits to do
19:07
yeah so it's kind of cheating they're
19:09
not making wax models they're just
19:10
making
19:11
what's happening hands in her hair there
19:13
is there's an amazing book about madame
19:15
tussauds which is by pamela pillbeam
19:17
uh and i read a bit of it in the 19th
19:19
century madame tussauds had a live
19:21
orchestra playing as you walked around
19:23
and it was a really classy thing to do
19:25
um
19:26
you could touch anyone you liked and i
19:28
appreciate it
19:29
what do you mean the um the models cause
19:31
it's gonna put off the violinist isn't
19:32
it
19:35
fondle the orchestra um
19:38
you're still allowed to touch the menu i
19:39
think that's the whole point are you i
19:42
think so
19:42
i don't know i haven't been for years
19:44
when i used to go you weren't allowed to
19:45
touch them but i think more recently
19:46
they've allowed you to kind of put your
19:48
arms around them and take selfies and
19:49
stuff
19:50
yeah i think we've mentioned before that
19:51
they know that brad pitt is the most
19:52
groped
19:53
of the wax works at madame tussauds yeah
19:56
how do they know
19:57
um they have someone watching no
20:00
the reason they know is because it's the
20:02
one that they need to replace most often
20:04
because people keep touching it so it
20:05
keeps needs like the trousers need
20:07
replacing and stuff like that
20:09
um oh well well like i say i haven't
20:13
been for years
20:16
because i'm banned
20:19
but um tom hardy for instance a tom
20:21
hardy muddle at two swords
20:22
um he has a beating heart and a soft
20:25
warm
20:26
torso what what so like if you weren't
20:29
allowed to touch him there'd be no point
20:31
having that would they
20:32
yeah is it actually tom hardy because he
20:34
is very still
20:35
in a lot of his shows anyway isn't he
20:37
he's just had a lot of viagra and it's
20:39
he's stiffened him up
20:43
arnold schwarzenegger actually did that
20:45
yeah arnold schwarzenegger there was
20:46
some thing he was promoting and that for
20:48
a stunt he just stood in madame's
20:50
dressed up like the terminator you know
20:51
with the sort of metal showing through
20:53
and injured and then he would move and
20:54
freak people out
20:57
and some of the religious um kind of
20:59
things that you can go and see
21:01
yeah and the world's largest wooden
21:03
construction
21:04
so the largest largest wooden
21:05
construction in the whole world is
21:07
noah's ark
21:08
wow and it's a noah's ark in america
21:10
it's called the ark encounter
21:12
and it fits over 16 000 people
21:15
simultaneously inside it
21:17
but they're only supposed to be two i
21:18
thought
21:19
[Laughter]
21:22
a lot of space they have a lot of space
21:25
um
21:25
well actually there are a few more
21:27
humans on noah's ark
21:35
and the third one who has the more
21:36
complicated name wait someone knows it
21:39
jedward that was two by two as well
21:43
chadwick wasn't it
21:45
i'm sorry i heard jedward because
21:46
apparently in the dublin wax museum
21:48
you can have a jedward made but and
21:50
they're on a two-for-one deal
21:53
who wants it again jpeg
21:56
okay
22:00
it was jpeg but
22:04
the amazing thing is that this massive
22:06
noah's ark was made by a guy called ken
22:08
hammer wow which is the same name as
22:11
someone on noah's ark
22:12
uh he's quite famous in america as being
22:14
an extremely pious
22:15
catholic um anti-evolutionary kind of
22:18
guy
22:19
and bill nye the science guy um he went
22:22
to see this noah's ark and he said on
22:24
the third deck of the ark
22:25
every single science exhibit is
22:27
absolutely wrong
22:30
not just misleading but wrong
22:33
so yeah it's completely bad and ken ham
22:34
by the way is trying to um this year
22:36
last year trying to put the jesus back
22:38
into halloween
22:40
he's suggesting that people should go
22:42
reverse trick-or-treating
22:44
uh where you bring a basket of goodies
22:46
to bless your neighbors
22:48
and what if they don't want one you have
22:50
to do something
22:51
nice to them
22:55
well good luck with that mr ham
22:59
did you know that baby jesus theft has
23:01
its own wikipedia page
23:05
it's jam-packed to the rafters yeah so
23:07
jesus is
23:08
always getting stolen at christmas as it
23:10
happens
23:12
and then there's this list they're
23:13
always getting nick from nativity scenes
23:14
um
23:15
marilyn manson once stole a whole bunch
23:17
of them he admitted later he stole a
23:19
whole bunch of jesus's and actually
23:20
oddly replace them with hams
23:24
so maybe that was a tribute to ken wow i
23:26
was thinking marilyn manson did he not
23:28
have a song called personal jesus
23:30
did he yeah he did didn't he so he's
23:32
just going that's my personal jesus
23:34
jesus and actually this is related to
23:37
what you said earlier i read a quote
23:39
from a historian
23:40
of baby jesus thefts who
23:43
he may have other strings to his bow
23:45
who's called daniel's silly man
23:48
and come on
23:51
genuinely sorry silly man what's your
23:54
very serious paper about this time
23:58
anyway he said baby jesus thieves
24:01
literally
24:01
take the christ out of christmas
24:05
which i think is worth reflecting on
24:06
yeah okay it is time for fact number
24:09
three
24:10
and that is james okay my fact this week
24:13
is that a giraffe with breathing
24:15
problems can be treated by using a leaf
24:17
blower
24:21
is it on suck or blow
24:24
i think it's on blow yeah or they're all
24:26
always on blow aren't they yeah yeah
24:32
they'd be leaf suckers my leaf blower
24:35
sucks
24:37
um so this andy was the only person in
24:40
the room who found that funny which
24:43
so where were you all
24:47
so this is a 2007 paper by setano
24:50
et al and what the thing and what did al
24:54
contribute to proceedings
24:58
and what happened was um they had to
25:00
anesthetize a giraffe
25:01
but as anesthetized it meant that it had
25:03
trouble breathing and they managed to
25:05
fix it by
25:06
getting a gas-powered leaf blower and
25:08
then attaching it to a few other parts
25:09
and managed to artificially ventilate
25:11
this giraffe
25:12
by blowing into its mouth through
25:15
through its trachea and into its lungs
25:16
wow
25:18
wow and got all the leaves out of it
25:22
yeah it woke up it's like is anyone else
25:23
hungry
25:27
the thing i've always find weird about
25:28
giraffes is that i think we've done this
25:30
on qr years ago
25:31
is that when they were first spotted by
25:33
the romans they called them the
25:35
camel leopard uh so they someone saw a
25:39
giraffe
25:39
and thought what's the striking thing
25:41
about this well it looks like a cross
25:42
being a camel and a leopard
25:44
and in fact he noted this animal is like
25:46
a camel in
25:47
all respect except that its legs are not
25:50
of the same length
25:55
the skin is spotted like a leopard so
25:56
we're called i mean what what about the
25:58
neck mate
25:58
was it someone who wasn't looking up you
26:01
know it was only until recently that we
26:02
found out there was
26:03
more than one giraffe that was a you
26:05
mean more than one species of giraffe
26:07
yeah
26:09
because actually they were all stood in
26:11
the line and you can only see the one
26:12
right next to you
26:13
oh yeah i mean i mean there was more
26:15
than one species so
26:16
we we thought up until now that it was
26:19
just giraffe and there was subspecies
26:21
within giraffe but now
26:23
there's four wow and well there's always
26:25
been but we've just
26:26
suddenly been like whoa there's three
26:27
more so there's a thing about the nerves
26:30
and it's
26:30
it's a really annoying thing for them it
26:32
doesn't affect them too much but
26:34
uh so most vertebrates we have these
26:36
things called laryngeal nerves and they
26:38
help to send signals to all the organs
26:39
in your body
26:40
and in all mammals they branch off the
26:42
uh vageous nerve that's how it's
26:44
pronounced
26:45
at vagus nerves oh that's good to know
26:48
because we mentioned that in
26:50
this next episode that's going on and
26:52
you're not gonna like how we say it
26:57
so they branch off the vagus nerve
27:01
and then one of them loops under the
27:02
aorta and then back to the
27:04
is it larynx
27:05
[Laughter]
27:11
so then it loops back to the larynx and
27:13
it's a bit awkward but it's only a few
27:14
inches longer in almost all
27:16
mammals unfortunately in giraffes
27:18
they've got these really long necks so
27:19
the nerve
27:20
has to go on this massive detour all the
27:22
way down so in humans it's uh six inches
27:24
long
27:25
and it should only be about six inches
27:27
long for giraffe but in giraffes it's 15
27:28
feet long because it has to go all the
27:29
way down the neck and then back up
27:31
wow and that's the nerve that's the
27:34
nerve yeah so does that mean
27:35
if you like slap a giraffe on the chest
27:38
then it won't feel it for eight years
27:40
actually that is that is kind of true so
27:42
this is not the vagus nerve but one of
27:44
the other nerves so
27:45
it takes a rat 4.5 milliseconds to
27:47
respond to stimuli
27:49
if you stand on a rat's foot it would
27:51
take that long
27:52
um but a giraffe it takes them 100
27:54
milliseconds to sense and respond to
27:55
something
27:56
um so like if you stamp on a draft foot
27:58
it would take what um i don't know 25
28:00
times longer wow
28:02
so they'd be very dangerous drivers
28:03
wouldn't they yes
28:06
very slow reactions
28:07
[Laughter]
28:09
and also uh you'd have to cut hole in
28:11
top of your car
28:13
it was i think the first giraffe that
28:15
came over here or the really famous
28:16
giraffe that came to britain in the in
28:18
1827 i think it was
28:20
came apparently in a boat where they had
28:21
to have a hole drilled in the deck of
28:23
the boat so that it could travel
28:25
but wasn't that it was to france wasn't
28:27
it there were three
28:28
and they were given by the viceroy of
28:30
egypt weren't they and he
28:31
was sort of like dealing cards he gave
28:33
three giraffes one to britain one to
28:35
france and one to austria
28:36
and bizarrely they were transported from
28:39
egypt
28:40
uh over to western europe on the backs
28:42
of camels yeah
28:44
what yeah they were strapped to camels
28:47
they were
28:47
they were they were small when they
28:48
started they were they were young
28:49
giraffes when they were started
28:51
so for the first stage they were put on
28:52
a camel so that how long was the trip
28:55
though that's a long it was it's so long
28:56
it took two and a half years to get them
28:58
from sudan
28:59
to no wonder trick the camel to begin
29:01
with they're going this guy's tiny he'll
29:03
be fine
29:04
one year in this guy's what the is
29:06
this
29:09
this guy's just like me but with
29:10
slightly longer legs
29:16
it was amazing though so the one that
29:18
went to france
29:19
uh was called zarapha and uh zarafa had
29:22
three
29:23
nannies who were all cows yes
29:26
because he needed six gallons of milk
29:28
every day to keep growing yeah wow
29:30
so these cows all went along for the
29:32
ride as well so wet wet nurse nannies
29:34
rather than
29:35
it wasn't nannies who played with him
29:36
with rattles and stuff wasn't there
29:39
they suckled at the house to eat they
29:41
must have had a massive identity crisis
29:42
by the time they arrived
29:46
how do you suck a lot of cows to eat is
29:48
its cow really really high and stilts or
29:50
something
29:50
the cow is on the back of a huge donkey
29:55
yeah maybe they put a cow on stilts i
29:57
don't know it sounded like a lot of
29:58
effort to go to but they suckled the
30:00
cows
30:00
wow um yeah um we think that we or we
30:03
thought until recently the giraffes were
30:05
loners
30:06
and now apparently it turns out they can
30:07
just see each other from further away
30:09
and they genuinely so they couldn't talk
30:12
to each other from that distance could
30:14
they
30:14
they can communicate from a fair i think
30:17
from about 100 feet away they can
30:18
because they have infrastructure stuff
30:20
today
30:20
i think they can hum at uh volumes that
30:23
we can't
30:24
know they've been here yeah we've been
30:26
for for centuries i've been trying to
30:27
work out how they communicate through
30:28
voice because
30:29
they don't really hear um giraffes
30:32
communicating so they think how's this
30:33
done and in zoos they did a study
30:35
uh to see whether or not they could
30:37
capture them talking to each other
30:39
and the conclusion is that they have
30:40
found them talking to each other at
30:42
night and it is through as you say hums
30:44
so they hear these hums and they're done
30:46
in different patterns and so on so they
30:47
think they're talking to each other
30:49
there's a slight thought that it could
30:51
also be them snoring
30:52
they're not sure because it's curious
30:55
that they do it only at night
30:56
maybe it's one of them snoring and the
30:57
other one's saying can you just turn
30:59
over please
31:02
that's it do you know the weirdest thing
31:04
about giraffes is uh of
31:06
all quadrupeds they're the only known
31:08
ones that can't
31:09
swim naturally so every single
31:12
four-legged animal
31:13
you've ever seen is a natural swimmer
31:15
and so not like we are we have to learn
31:17
to swim if you drop a baby in the water
31:18
it will sink same with an
31:19
ape which actually they did i think in
31:22
the early 20th century
31:23
they retrieved them but they dropped
31:25
lots of monkeys into water
31:27
watched them for a while and they all
31:28
flailed and then sank quite quickly
31:30
then they got them out again um do any
31:32
live by the ocean
31:34
as in i'm just wondering if they live
31:35
inland it's only lakes they're probably
31:37
tall enough they've never had to
31:38
learn to swim because their necks are
31:40
out maybe crossing a river you can just
31:42
walk across the river
31:44
well you don't know until you try
31:47
as in you don't know that a giraffe
31:48
can't tell the depth of a river by just
31:50
looking at it
31:51
there'll come a point where you're
31:52
walking into the river you think this is
31:53
fine this is fine
31:54
this is not fine yeah yeah but then
31:57
you're you're the
31:58
exciting explorer and then the rest are
32:00
going all right mike didn't make it
32:01
let's find another way
32:04
um we're gonna have to move on shortly
32:06
um just just quickly
32:07
i am i found a fact about leaf blowers
32:10
and animals
32:11
um so your fact was a giraffe with
32:14
breathing problems can be treated using
32:15
a leaf blower
32:16
i have to admit this is genuinely true
32:18
right until you said it tonight i
32:20
misread it i thought you said a giraffe
32:21
with breathing problems can be used as a
32:23
leaf blower
32:26
honestly as you read it tonight they're
32:28
they're the one giraffes that can't be
32:30
used to blow leaves
32:32
i i thought that's what it was so i
32:34
looked into other animals that can be
32:35
used as a leaf blower
32:40
we can we i think we do need to
32:41
interrogate for a second how you thought
32:43
a giraffe was going to be used as a leaf
32:45
blower was it like
32:46
when you play wheelbarrow at school in
32:47
races you hold its legs and put its nose
32:49
to the ground
32:50
yeah i don't know because the only i
32:51
thought it was a bit of a cruel fact to
32:52
use to be honest i was
32:54
because i thought they must have this
32:56
sort of push that with a break in
32:57
between because it's like a wheeze and
32:59
and they probably lean over because it's
33:00
hurting so they're going
33:01
and they're like wow this is really
33:02
effective in zoos let's walk the giraffe
33:05
around with the breathing problems and
33:07
let's
33:07
let's clean this place up anyway
33:10
so elephants also use their trunks as
33:14
a makeshift leaf blower as it were don't
33:16
say also
33:23
so elephants they have this thing where
33:25
if they're in in vicinity of
33:27
inaccessible food because a a bit's too
33:30
tight for them to
33:31
to get to the food what they do is they
33:33
blow at the food
33:34
if there's some sort of tree or wall
33:36
let's say that's in the way
33:37
and it bounces the food off it and back
33:39
towards them and that's how they can get
33:41
their food and this is something we've
33:42
been observing about elephants for a
33:44
very long time
33:45
in fact in the descent of man by charles
33:47
darwin he writes about the the leaf
33:49
blowing
33:49
uh that wasn't invented then so way
33:52
ahead of his time
33:53
charles darwin it's interesting because
33:54
it's a bit like them using uh
33:56
tools isn't it because they've basically
33:58
solved the problem
33:59
to be able to get food closer to them
34:01
which i think is really cool yeah it's
34:02
really amazing
34:02
i was looking at a few other weird
34:04
things that vets had done
34:06
oh yeah and just this one thing i found
34:08
which i really liked it's not quite that
34:09
but um
34:10
there was a spiny anteater called
34:12
matilda who had inflamed skin
34:15
bald patches and bulging puffy eyes and
34:18
it turned out that she was allergic
34:20
to ants wow antiques are allergic to
34:23
ants
34:24
and she where's your puffy eyes puffy
34:26
eyes i should have just put a live crab
34:31
around the neck solved
34:35
they made a vaccine farah that's it oh
34:37
okay
34:38
okay time for our final fact of the show
34:41
and that
34:42
is andy my fact is that when 3 000
34:45
british teenagers were surveyed in 2008
34:47
20
34:48
said that they thought winston churchill
34:50
was a fictional character
34:54
they can all vote now can't they yep
34:59
so and this is just a sort of you know
35:02
things that get thrown up by opinion
35:03
polls so
35:04
the same poll found that um 27 thought
35:06
that florence nightingale had never
35:08
existed
35:09
uh and that 47 thought that richard the
35:11
lionheart was fictional which i can kind
35:13
of understand because that sounds like
35:14
it sounds like it sounds maybe up here
35:16
richard the lionheart yeah sure
35:17
um but 47 thought that elena rigby was
35:20
real
35:22
so was there there was a real one yeah i
35:24
mean in a way she was because
35:26
uh paul mccartney did see the name
35:28
eleanor rigby on the tombstone he didn't
35:30
know her
35:30
or her story but okay there was 47 of
35:33
british teenagers in 2008 knew that
35:35
beatles
35:36
arcane anecdote it was a month later
35:39
they did another survey
35:41
and one in three primary school pupils
35:43
thought that he was the first man to
35:44
walk on the moon
35:45
when's the churchill cool i think a lot
35:47
of these things
35:48
it must be like they just give you a
35:50
name of a person they go real or not
35:52
real and you just go
35:53
i don't know yeah especially at primary
35:55
school you don't care what you're
35:56
crossing you're just excited someone's
35:57
giving you a felt
35:58
tip
36:01
but so they just bringing up moon it's
36:04
not as if they
36:04
they think he's fictional as in it's a
36:06
conspiracy that he was invented as an
36:08
idea because you know there was all that
36:09
stuff about the fact that we
36:10
will fight them on the beaches was said
36:12
by someone else a voice actor
36:14
yes which is not true i don't think but
36:16
there was an idea that he had never
36:17
done it is true yeah it was a voice
36:20
actor
36:21
the famous recording that we have or
36:23
many of the famous recordings that we
36:24
have in fact
36:25
winston churchill uh i think were
36:26
recorded after the war churchill himself
36:28
did a few in the studio but there are
36:30
broadcasts which were done by a voice
36:31
actor yeah okay right
36:32
you know he has been a fictional
36:34
character in some respects yes uh i went
36:36
on to comic vine
36:38
website and found that there's 164 comic
36:41
books with winston churchill as a
36:42
character in them wow
36:43
he's been in star trek comic eagle
36:46
justice league super boy
36:47
captain america green lantern and santa
36:50
claus versus the nazis
36:53
wow they're the main ones
36:55
[Laughter]
36:56
he wasn't very good in studies i mean i
36:58
know something that's often said about
37:00
churchill but i do think it's quite
37:01
reassuring when he realized how bad he
37:03
was at school
37:04
so he failed basically everything that
37:05
he didn't like except history and
37:07
english
37:07
he failed his entrance exam to
37:09
university twice or to the royal
37:10
military college
37:11
which i don't think was that hard to get
37:13
into uh but he failed that twice
37:15
he failed everything except history and
37:17
english oh he did it very badly in it
37:19
yeah okay but history and language was
37:20
two best ones i think so yeah then later
37:22
on he won the nobel prize for literature
37:24
and
37:24
defeated nazis history and english
37:28
[Laughter]
37:29
so what we're saying kids is specialize
37:31
yeah
37:34
if you're no good at french it
37:42
is that what we're saying
37:46
maybe we are that divided a country
37:47
after all you know when roosevelt fdr
37:50
first met him he first met him in 1918
37:53
so that
37:54
would have been just after he'd come out
37:55
from fighting the first world war and
37:57
they were on a diplomatic mission and he
37:58
met churchill as a soldier
38:00
and called him a stinker hated him so
38:03
they obviously became really close in
38:04
the second world war but the only thing
38:05
he said about winston churchill was what
38:06
a stinker
38:08
what does stinker mean in that does it
38:10
mean just a bad person or
38:11
like i mean oh really you're a stinker
38:14
you know like in a playground if you
38:16
call someone a stinker
38:17
then i know that only too well
38:25
so um churchill first became famous in
38:28
the boer war as a reporter didn't he
38:31
but then as a correspondent he got
38:33
captured and he had to escape
38:35
and then the tales of his escape became
38:36
really really famous
38:38
um but when he did escape they raised
38:40
the alarm and they gave a description of
38:42
him so they could find him
38:43
and they said escaped prisoner of war
38:45
winston spencer churchill
38:47
englishman 25 years old about five foot
38:50
eight inches tall
38:51
medium build walks with a slight stoop
38:54
pale features
38:55
reddish brown hair almost invisible
38:57
small mustache
38:59
speaks through his nose cannot pronounce
39:01
the letter s
39:03
and cannot speak one word of dutch
39:06
and that's your great winston churchill
39:08
wow yeah almost invisible small
39:10
moustache
39:12
wait you there stop no that's too
39:15
visible a small moustache you're free to
39:17
go
39:19
that was hitler wasn't it in that resort
39:21
yeah
39:25
can i tell you just a really quick
39:26
churchill thing that's quite
39:27
tangentially related but um
39:29
this was actually one of our researchers
39:31
sent me uh the book with us in the other
39:33
day
39:34
and it's that winston churchill had a
39:36
son-in-law duncan sandisk who was a
39:38
minister for a brief time in the 60s
39:41
and basically winston churchill's
39:43
son-in-law was forced
39:44
by harold mcmillan's government to go to
39:46
the doctor to have his penis
39:48
compared to a penis in a salacious photo
39:51
to prove that it wasn't the same penis
39:53
and it's just such a good story so there
39:55
was this huge ruckus in the early 60s
39:57
because someone was caught
39:59
uh having a given to them by a
40:01
duchess
40:02
and their head wasn't in the picture so
40:04
you could only see the nether regions
40:06
and it was going to be this huge scandal
40:08
and everyone said it's this is this guy
40:09
it's the minister of defense duncan
40:11
sandisk
40:11
and so he eventually had to go he was
40:13
made to go to harley street by the
40:15
government
40:16
with this photo in one hand and his
40:17
willy in the other
40:20
how did he how did he ring the bell
40:30
anyway they confirmed it wasn't the same
40:32
penis um
40:34
but we should we should talk as well
40:36
about surveys because surveys uh
40:38
they they always bring up the weirdest
40:40
uh of
40:41
revelations about what people think
40:42
around the world i i really like that uh
40:45
there was a survey done about what we
40:47
think sci-fi things are real and not
40:48
real that we hear about
40:50
so for example over a fifth of adults
40:53
and this was in uh birmingham did this
40:55
as a
40:56
uh survey over a fifth of adults
40:57
incorrectly believe that lightsabers
40:59
exist
41:00
as a real thing um nearly a quarter
41:03
twenty four percent of people
41:05
uh believe that humans can be teleported
41:08
that's quite cool uh 40 believe that
41:10
hoverboards exist i mean it's uh
41:12
i think they did invent a hoverboard
41:14
because i thought i thought they
41:15
invented the world's first hoverboard a
41:16
couple of years ago they also had those
41:18
really rubbish kind of things on two
41:20
wheels that like a segway without the
41:21
stick and they were called hoverboards
41:23
maybe i'm thinking of that they didn't
41:25
know when i think it might have been a
41:26
bit rubbish
41:27
uh 11 of teenagers think that fruit
41:29
pastels count as one of your five a day
41:33
which color any color any color they're
41:35
all fruit they're
41:36
all free they're not fruit and meat
41:38
pastels are they
41:42
although i've just had an amazing idea
41:48
uh well 11.5 tubes of fruit pastels
41:51
would give you about as much vitamin c
41:53
as a piece of fruit
41:55
um so yougov do obviously loads and
41:57
loads and loads of poles and they
41:59
build up these huge you know crunching
42:01
amounts of data based on
42:02
you know just they pick one thing that
42:04
people divide into like right-handed or
42:06
left-handed and then they can find out
42:07
massive amounts about the
42:09
tendencies so the hugo surveys have
42:11
found and they've sort of crunched the
42:12
load of numbers together
42:13
that a quarter of leave voters like
42:15
their stakes well done but only 12
42:17
have remained voters like their stakes
42:18
well done more leave voters than remain
42:21
voters
42:22
think that doctor who votes conservative
42:26
remain voters think he would probably
42:27
vote green
42:30
she oh
42:33
well thanks a bunch james i've got up to
42:35
chris eccleston
42:44
well get ready to be angry
42:45
[Laughter]
42:49
um i this is i found this amazing there
42:52
was a survey done
42:53
last year that found 35 of french people
42:57
cannot name the french prime minister
43:00
what
43:00
which i mean can you no the french prime
43:04
minister the president is macron
43:06
yes indeed does that get is that worth a
43:08
half point
43:09
you don't get bonus points for naming
43:10
that crime this is the worst pub quiz
43:12
i've ever been to
43:12
[Laughter]
43:14
so who is it it's a guy called eduard
43:16
philippe i have to say i've never heard
43:17
i could have guessed that i would have
43:18
said two random french names it got
43:20
pretty close
43:23
it's not incredible more than a third
43:25
don't know their own prime minister is
43:27
apparently on the survey a lot of people
43:28
put gerard philippe or i think it's an
43:30
actor or louis philippe
43:31
uh who's obviously you know early french
43:33
king but
43:34
yeah they don't know their pm and i
43:36
think probably um britain might be in
43:38
the same position at this stage
43:39
but yeah by the time this goes out next
43:42
week
43:42
yeah there was a survey done in america
43:45
about the cloud
43:46
or cloud computing putting up in the
43:48
clouds and 51
43:49
of the americans that answered to the
43:52
survey
43:52
said that they thought that if it was a
43:54
stormy weather situation outside that
43:56
would affect them getting access to
43:57
their
43:58
cloud information it's fair enough
44:01
there was a tech poll a few years ago
44:03
where 11 of people believe that html was
44:05
a sexually transmitted disease
44:09
junior that was so that was a um that
44:11
was a survey a study that was looking
44:13
into how many people understood
44:14
techy-sounding words
44:15
so as well as that how many people
44:17
thought that jpeg was a character in the

02:08
do not get to say
02:22
hello and welcome to another episode of
02:25
no such thing as a fish
02:27
a weekly podcast this week coming to you
02:29
from our book of the year
02:31
2018 tour in york
02:42
my name is dan schreiber and i am
02:45
sitting here with anna chazinski
02:47
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
02:50
and once again we have gathered round
02:52
the microphones with our four favorite
02:53
facts from the last seven days
02:55
and in no particular order here we go
02:58
starting with you james harkin my fact
03:01
this week is that three times memory
03:03
champion
03:04
ben pridmar is up to his fourth lucky
03:07
hat
03:08
as he forgot where he left the other
03:09
thing
03:14
wow so these memory tests are easier
03:16
than we think
03:18
yeah so this is from a press release for
03:20
the 2014 world memory championships
03:23
and they're referring to memory
03:24
champions and they say reassuringly they
03:26
also lose their car keys
03:28
and come back from the shop without the
03:29
one item they went for or in case of
03:31
three times world memory champion ben
03:32
pridmar from derbyshire his lucky hat
03:35
he knows where he left one of them it
03:36
was on a train but he forgot to pick it
03:38
up off the train
03:40
uh and the current world memory champion
03:42
actually who's called
03:43
alex mullen who can memorize the order
03:45
of a deck of cards in 17 seconds
03:47
says he always loses his car keys so wow
03:50
but apparently it's just like it's just
03:52
a different thing these these people
03:53
don't really have amazing memories
03:55
they just have kind of worked on their
03:57
techniques for having amazing memories
03:59
if that makes sense yeah
04:00
yeah i read about a thing which is
04:02
called highly superior autobiographical
04:04
memory
04:05
um or hsam and hsam basically are people
04:09
who have such detailed memory about
04:11
their own life that they can tell you
04:13
the exact day that
04:14
something happened on at the exact hour
04:16
and not many people
04:17
have this in fact they announced it when
04:19
um it was done as a sort of press
04:20
release saying we're studying this new
04:22
phenomena and they've still found less
04:23
than 100 people
04:24
off the back of the publicity that
04:26
they've got for it you're about to say
04:27
they're more now i thought there were
04:28
only four actually
04:30
oh i think the number yeah so it's under
04:31
100. um
04:36
both stories check out these guys the
04:39
people who have that and not these
04:41
memory champions so the memory champions
04:42
they teach themselves how to count cards
04:44
and how to do things like that whereas
04:45
these guys have got an actual
04:47
innate talent yes but what's amazing is
04:49
they might forget basic things like
04:51
phone numbers and faces so they have a
04:53
personal biography timeline they can
04:55
tell you what
04:56
day things happened on some of them do
04:57
remember incredible things though so
04:58
there's a guy called bob petrella
05:00
and he can remember up to half the days
05:01
of his entire life in detail
05:04
as in what he did at every stage of the
05:06
day and he remembers most conversations
05:08
he's had in the last 53 we know which
05:10
half he can remember
05:11
is it like i don't know if it's the
05:12
order the even
05:15
but in 2006 he lost his phone and he
05:17
didn't worry because he just had all the
05:18
numbers in his head
05:20
yeah that's amazing quite a good way to
05:22
remember numbers is to lose your phone
05:23
all the time which i do and i know
05:25
basically everybody's phone number's off
05:26
by heart so it's a chicken or egg thing
05:28
yeah um the one problem with this
05:30
disease is that
05:31
you also retain the exact feeling and
05:34
emotion that you had about something
05:36
in really high detail so if you were
05:37
dumped like 20 years ago
05:39
you would still be like oh god damn it
05:42
it just wouldn't die as a feeling yeah
05:44
do you know that you can erase that
05:45
though can you yeah so they should they
05:47
should all get this done so basically
05:49
there are two different parts of your
05:50
brain that deal with memory there's
05:52
uh the bit that remembers the actual
05:54
facts of what happened so that's
05:55
the hippocampus does that the cognitive
05:57
part and then the amygdala records the
05:59
emotions that went with it and if you
06:02
like
06:02
if something bad happens to you you get
06:04
dumped you lose a sock
06:06
um if you are you always getting dumped
06:08
or do you never lose a song
06:11
or does it always happen at the same
06:12
time you're dumped i don't i don't date
06:14
people with one sock
06:17
i go out with very pedantic people
06:20
but if you take drugs like propanol then
06:22
it limits the amygdala's
06:24
ability to build up the proteins that
06:26
are needed to connect it to that emotion
06:28
and so next time you remember about the
06:29
lost sock or the tragedy of
06:31
the dumping you just won't feel anything
06:33
you'll be like oh that happened
06:35
that was bad wasn't it never mind but
06:37
like you say james it's
06:39
that's extremely rare um there are
06:41
either four or 100 people who have that
06:43
whereas
06:44
while somewhere in between between
06:47
whereas
06:48
being able to win these memory tests is
06:50
actually quite easy
06:51
anyone can do it this is the amazing
06:53
thing that people have sort of
06:54
re-realized
06:55
in the last few decades is that training
06:57
your memory
06:58
is very easy and you basically do this
07:00
thing called building a building a
07:02
memory palace where
07:03
there's a specific way you can train
07:05
yourself by
07:06
picturing somewhere you know like your
07:07
picture your own house and then if
07:09
you've got to remember let's say 100
07:10
objects
07:11
you just place them in weird places in
07:13
your house so if you have to remember
07:15
pineapple and claudia schiffer if you
07:17
picture her
07:18
doing a headstand on a pineapple i don't
07:20
know why people after that because
07:22
they're
07:22
i don't know where your minds went i
07:24
think they were laughing at where your
07:25
mind went yeah
07:26
that's basically the most up-to-date
07:28
person you could think
07:31
if you're told to remember a series of
07:32
words okay you can
07:34
you can picture the objects so you might
07:36
conference the pineapple near your front
07:38
door
07:38
and then claudia schiffer in the front
07:40
room and as you walk through the house
07:42
you can see it and it's called um
07:43
lokai which is the plural of locus
07:46
meaning location in latin
07:47
and it was apparently first used by
07:49
simonides of
07:50
kiosk um who was the sole survivor of a
07:53
roof
07:54
collapse during a meal and he could
07:56
remember everyone who was in the room
07:57
and
07:58
people who had died unfortunately by
07:59
remembering where they were sat
08:01
and that's according to legend and
08:03
apparently this technique of remembering
08:05
was thought so dangerous by the church
08:07
that it was banned in 11th century
08:09
europe
08:10
wow it was in fear of it promoting
08:12
unholy images
08:15
like claudia schiffer with a pineapple
08:16
for instance
08:19
that must have been so annoying i read
08:20
about simonides and so he this awful
08:22
thing happened the roof collapsed on
08:24
whatever 100 guests and then he just
08:26
wanders back in and shows off how well
08:28
he remembers where they were all sat
08:29
didn't he just yeah i can't work out if
08:32
he was asked to do it or if he had been
08:34
doing the technique and then it was
08:35
lucky that the roof collapsed
08:36
i don't think it was lucky though was it
08:39
lucky that
08:40
the roof collapsed and he survived
08:41
because he'd already been memorizing
08:42
everyone or had he was he one of these
08:44
four people who just remembers where
08:45
everyone was sitting
08:47
no it was it was not lucky and it also
08:49
wasn't that he had an amazing memory it
08:51
was that the roof collapsed
08:52
and then he realized that he remembered
08:54
them because he realized he had this
08:56
spatial
08:57
memory was he doing the place settings
08:59
for this dinner like how
09:00
because i've been to dinner with five
09:01
people where i don't remember where we
09:03
were all sitting
09:04
maybe he was extremely bored he had no
09:06
one to talk you know when you're at
09:07
dinner and the person on your left is
09:08
talking to the other person and the
09:09
person you're right is talking to the
09:10
other person so he was just sat
09:12
there memorizing where everyone was i go
09:14
to a lot of dinners like that weirdly
09:16
i can imagine um this is so damn
09:24
um just to go back to the memory
09:26
champions briefly this guy pridmore i
09:28
just looked at the things
09:29
he can do so he can memorize a pack of
09:31
cards in 24 seconds which is not quite
09:33
the record but
09:34
he's remembered a binary number i think
09:36
this might have been record-breaking so
09:37
binary number just ones and zeros
09:39
he remembered every single digit from a
09:41
930
09:42
digit long sequence right in five
09:44
minutes
09:45
he memorized it and then he got it
09:46
completely only zeros and ones though so
09:49
you know it's a 50 50 guess each time
09:53
you could get unbelievably lucky because
09:55
it's true
09:58
is it zero zero
10:02
actually i was googling this guy i think
10:04
he was on britain's got talent
10:06
this year or last year oh yeah he was
10:08
yeah was he yeah okay
10:09
doing that repeating ones and zeros yeah
10:12
um we met a guy james and i years ago
10:14
met this guy incredible guy called
10:16
daniel tamet who is a
10:18
um he has autism he has asperger's and
10:21
he um has an incredible ability he's he
10:23
says it's kind of like his um
10:25
his state is almost like what rain man
10:27
the movie um
10:28
was except he has this incredible
10:30
ability to actually communicate
10:31
and tell scientists what's going on on
10:33
the inside so he did a few
10:35
record-breaking number memory
10:36
things he was the guy who learned how to
10:38
speak icelandic in a week or so yes
10:40
exactly yeah and he um he has
10:43
synesthesia as well
10:44
so he memorized pi to something like you
10:47
know 300 decimal places or something
10:49
like that yeah but each number it's only
10:51
10 options you could get unbelievably
10:55
lucky
10:56
but he did it by using synesthesia so
10:59
every number has a color associated with
11:01
it and he memorized the color so when he
11:03
had to re
11:04
um when he had to tell it for the record
11:06
he just pictured
11:07
walking and passing all the colors on
11:09
the ground of each number so he just saw
11:11
a red and went six and a green and yeah
11:13
that's how this memory training works
11:14
it's the same thing it's
11:15
turning into a visual thing isn't it
11:18
you're about to break the record and
11:18
suddenly instead of a nine there's
11:20
claudia schiffer and you're like oh god
11:21
what number was that meant to be she's
11:23
definitely a nine
11:30
um but i think people's memories used to
11:33
be better right
11:34
so in ancient ancient greece and ancient
11:36
rome like the way
11:37
the iliad and the odyssey were passed
11:39
down was
11:40
we assume or just orally over hundreds
11:43
of years
11:44
and you know it's this is stuff that
11:46
would take about 20 hours to read out i
11:48
think the
11:48
out of the odyssey and yet people were
11:50
able to memorize it and there's some
11:51
repetition
11:52
but generally people are really good at
11:53
that and the idea is that when you're
11:55
remembering one of these
11:56
stories you're basically doing that
11:58
walkthrough aren't you you're walking
11:59
through the story and you're going to
12:00
all these different places and
12:02
that's how they remember it by using the
12:03
same technique yeah and the person who
12:05
found that actually there's this really
12:06
cool
12:07
guy called millman parry who was a
12:10
homeric scholar and he was the person
12:11
who founded the whole idea of oral
12:13
tradition so if you ever hear someone
12:14
talk about the oral tradition of passing
12:16
stuff down
12:17
he invented that it was in the 1930s he
12:19
was working
12:20
and he went to russia and he found some
12:23
slavic people who
12:25
were still passing down stuff through
12:26
oral traditions and they had
12:28
poems that they would recite that were
12:29
tens of thousands of lines long
12:31
about for instance franz ferdinand's
12:33
assassination or something and so he
12:35
developed this whole theory but he never
12:36
got to complete it because
12:38
he accidentally killed himself when he
12:40
was unloading a suitcase at his
12:41
mother-in-law's house and a loaded gun
12:43
in there fired into him
12:44
oh what wow that story took a dark turn
12:50
and a loaded gun in a suitcase i know
12:52
don't do it i don't know how it got
12:53
through security
12:56
wow wow you know who this guy pridmore
12:59
is worse than
13:00
in memory terms no a chimpanzee
13:03
oh come on okay so this is about 10
13:05
years ago he went up against ayumu who
13:08
was a chimpanzee at kyoto university
13:10
and it was a specific memory task where
13:11
you had to recall a random series of
13:13
nine numbers
13:14
they would flash up and then they would
13:15
disappear very quickly and you had to
13:16
tap them in the right order
13:18
chimpanzees have photographic memories
13:20
in that regard only
13:21
so they can remember patterns and
13:23
sequences really well they're good at
13:24
right ninety percent of the time
13:25
he got it right 33 of the time wow wow
13:28
wow yeah but if this chimpanzee is
13:30
clever enough to get into kyoto
13:31
university you must be
13:36
[Applause]
13:37
you know someone another animal that has
13:39
a really good memory is the hummingbird
13:41
and i just love the hummingbirds have
13:42
one of the biggest brains proportional
13:44
to body size
13:45
in nature and they remember the location
13:48
of
13:48
all the flowers uh that are in their
13:50
general area so
13:51
uh many hundreds and thousands of
13:53
flowers and you know how much nectar
13:55
they had in them
13:55
and they also remember when they last
13:57
took nectar out of each one
13:59
so they remember when they're likely to
14:00
refill so they know exactly how
14:02
full with nectar or the flowers are
14:04
going to be smart that's awesome
14:06
we need to move on to our next fact very
14:07
shortly okay um
14:10
so you know your first memory
14:13
what was your first memory dan um
14:18
yeah no i can't actually well they did a
14:21
study where they asked 6641 people what
14:24
their first memory was and they said
14:26
if it's something that someone might
14:27
have told you then don't do that if it's
14:28
something where you might have seen a
14:29
picture don't do that it has to be
14:31
something you actually remember
14:32
and it turned out that 38.6 of them
14:35
remembered things from before the age of
14:37
two
14:37
and almost a thousand people claimed to
14:39
have remembered things from before they
14:40
were one
14:41
and people reckon that that's completely
14:43
impossible and actually
14:44
you don't really start forming memories
14:46
that you can remember in adulthood until
14:48
you're three
14:49
and so many means that about 40 of
14:51
people have a fake
14:52
first memory wow that's amazing also can
14:54
we just
14:55
pause for a moment on the fact that dan
14:56
can't remember his first memory i mean
14:59
do you remember your second memory
15:02
yeah yeah we're on a boat in hong kong
15:06
yeah um i i love the idea of when you
15:09
get older and memory sort of plays with
15:10
you a bit but also there's a lot of a
15:12
lot of people in the
15:13
entertainment industry who's obviously
15:15
done a lot of drugs in the 70s and 80s
15:17
and they've fried their brains so memory
15:19
is sometimes questionable and i was
15:20
reading a story about aerosmith
15:22
stephen tyler did a lot of drugs in the
15:24
70s and um
15:26
he was sitting in a cafe with perry who
15:28
was in his band
15:29
and um they were listening to a song on
15:31
the radio called um
15:32
you see me crying as from that album and
15:34
um steven tyler was like this song is
15:36
amazing we need to cover this
15:38
and perry went it's us
15:43
wow should we move on to our next fact
15:46
okay it is time for fact number two
15:48
and that is andy my fact is that before
15:51
he was executed
15:52
walter raleigh delivered a 45-minute
15:55
improvised speech
15:56
telling the crowd about his life
15:59
i i do like the idea that he was trying
16:01
to do a bit of a go slow
16:02
yeah and another important thing that
16:05
happened
16:06
that year was the person with the axe
16:09
just sort of kept on
16:10
being about to slam it down something
16:13
else
16:13
it was one year old definitely
16:17
so then my third memory i'll get back to
16:18
my first
16:21
yeah so this is interesting the day
16:23
we're recording us the 28th of october
16:25
is uh the day before the 400th
16:28
anniversary
16:29
of his execution 29th of october was
16:31
when it happened in
16:32
1618 and um he had an amazing sort of
16:36
closing
16:36
ceremony basically
16:40
basically he had a closing ceremony um
16:42
where you know he
16:43
he he did a great speech he made
16:45
everyone laugh he made
16:47
people think and cry and then he kissed
16:49
the axe i think and
16:50
and stole the executioner to get on with
16:52
it and he really you know went with
16:54
style in the morning in the morning he
16:56
had a good breakfast a pipe of tobacco
16:58
and a cup of wine
17:00
nice i think that's how i'd like to
17:01
start my closing service
17:05
it sounds like his own call was too long
17:06
i've been to shows like that and i feel
17:08
like people went away saying
17:09
that actually we were hoping to get the
17:11
last bus home and
17:15
someone said poor andy yeah
17:18
i'm i'm all right we haven't told you
17:22
you're gonna be executed at the end of
17:23
this lecture
17:25
yeah drag it out mate so there's um
17:29
there's a new biography out of walter
17:30
raleigh called patriot or traitor and
17:31
it's by anna beer
17:32
and it's got amazing facts because one
17:34
thing we do know about is what happened
17:36
to his head
17:37
uh or we think we know that his wife
17:39
carried it around
17:40
in a bag for 29 years
17:45
not everywhere she went i think largely
17:48
i think it was like to the shops for
17:50
milk in the morning
17:52
head in a bag and they've
17:55
they've just found a bag in the attic at
17:58
his son's
17:58
former home although anna bear the
18:00
biographer is very skeptical she says
18:02
it's almost definitely not the bag so
18:04
because she said there's a lot of people
18:05
at the time that said that the head was
18:07
put in a leather bag and this
18:09
bag is not leather there we go why
18:11
haven't they looked inside the bag
18:17
just people stroking their chins
18:19
gathered around this bag
18:22
so the head was later taken and buried
18:25
wasn't it
18:25
yeah yeah but not with the rest of his
18:28
body though right now
18:29
yeah weird eh it was pretty common
18:31
wasn't it i mean you
18:32
when you were beheaded i think you often
18:34
gave the gave the head to someone
18:35
and well quite often the head would be
18:37
erected on london bridge
18:39
wouldn't it and you know so that
18:40
everyone could see this terrible traitor
18:42
and then if that failed you'd give the
18:44
head to a loved one which is nice
18:46
he had such a interesting life in jail
18:49
because it doesn't sound like
18:50
people were crossed with him it actually
18:51
sounds like quite a nice lifestyle he
18:53
had in there so
18:54
he had an annual budget of 208 pounds
18:57
um which he could buy food with um he
19:00
had his wife and son
19:01
move in and live with him he had he had
19:04
he had three
19:04
servants in jail that was when you were
19:08
when you were really rich you were
19:09
allowed to do that weren't you right
19:10
you're basically in the house arrest
19:11
yeah but the thing is he was put in
19:12
there by james the first yeah and while
19:15
he was in the tower of london he tutored
19:16
the royal children
19:18
which i think is quite trusting isn't it
19:20
that he's got no hard feelings
19:22
yeah and lots of so he invented he was
19:25
an apothecary as well
19:26
as uh as a sailor and a courtyard and
19:28
all of this stuff so
19:29
he um he invented herbal remedies when
19:32
he was in there
19:33
and he invented a thing called oh my
19:36
goodness where is it yeah
19:37
it's called the great cordial and it was
19:40
a cure
19:41
for everything it had 40 ingredients in
19:43
it you needed deer horn
19:44
viper flesh cinnamon orange and lemon
19:47
rind and 35 other ingredients
19:50
and lots of people visited asking for
19:51
medical advice and for some that's
19:53
amazing there was another thing that he
19:54
made
19:55
um which was well the the recipe is take
19:57
a gallon of strawberries
19:59
uh put them into a pint of aqua vitae
20:02
which is basically pure alcohol
20:04
and then leave them for a while take the
20:05
strawberries out and drink the alcohol
20:08
and that was another thing that kind of
20:10
cured everything yeah i'm sure
20:12
yeah you can believe that he was in
20:14
prison a lot though wasn't he
20:15
so it was good that it was nice for him
20:17
he was kind of uh a bad boy
20:20
he probably would have been today he was
20:21
always getting into scrapes
20:24
you know like a pete dougherty he was
20:25
like
20:26
[Laughter]
20:27
he was a pete doggity of his day um i
20:30
think he got involved in various spats
20:32
one with the earl of oxford um
20:34
over whether or not the earl of oxford
20:36
should leave a tennis court
20:37
um he does today
20:41
it was that kind of thing um but yeah
20:43
and he was he was sent to prison when he
20:44
got married in fact
20:45
quite famously he fell in love with best
20:47
rock morton and queen elizabeth
20:49
probably fancied him in some way or was
20:52
attracted to him and so was kind of
20:53
annoyed when he married bess
20:55
behind her back it was one of she was
20:57
one of her maidens
20:59
waiting right yeah she kind of felt
21:01
betrayed because they'd gone behind her
21:02
back yeah yeah
21:03
and the amazing thing and this is where
21:05
i think those tudor dresses came in very
21:07
useful
21:07
is that before marrying her he like a
21:10
lad
21:10
uh impregnated the best rock morton um i
21:13
don't mean like a lad
21:14
guys
21:18
no he got he got best pregnant and she
21:21
had to
21:21
conceal it so she stayed at court like
21:24
you know waiting on queen elizabeth the
21:26
whole time but managed to conceal that
21:28
she was pregnant and she only went to
21:29
stay with her brother
21:30
two weeks before giving birth and then
21:31
as soon as she gave him birth she had to
21:33
go back
21:33
immediately they had roughs those days
21:35
didn't they so maybe her rough just got
21:36
bigger and bigger and bigger
21:38
until it was to the ground like the neck
21:41
thing
21:42
yeah drooping down over her belly yeah
21:45
what a weird place to start with your
21:47
disguise for pregnancy
21:51
andy we need your help i've got an idea
21:53
guys
21:55
how are you going to go over your
21:56
pregnancy i don't know i might use my
21:57
shoe yeah
21:58
we'll make the pointy shoe point upward
22:00
and upward and upward
22:04
um so a lot of people hated him as well
22:07
because he was really popular with queen
22:08
elizabeth and he was also extremely
22:10
handsome apparently he was one of the
22:11
most handsome men in the whole age
22:13
and so people had it in for him there
22:15
was one there was a popular song which
22:17
called him a damnable fiend of hell
22:20
and even his friends didn't really like
22:22
him either um
22:23
genuinely a lot of people just just
22:25
really didn't like him he then when
22:27
elizabeth died he got on the wrong side
22:29
of james the first or basically james
22:31
the first didn't want anything to do
22:32
with him because he was to do with
22:33
elizabeth
22:34
and then he got sent to prison because
22:36
of that and then basically
22:37
the whole opinion of him changed and
22:39
everyone kind of really liked him after
22:41
that
22:41
and some people said this is the
22:42
quickest that anyone has ever gone from
22:44
being completely hated by everyone to
22:46
being like roundly loved by everyone
22:49
and when they he did that 45-minute
22:51
speech
22:52
straight afterwards loads of people
22:53
printed it and started handing it out
22:55
it's
22:55
like a pamphlet so you could read about
22:57
this thing because it was all about how
22:58
he should never been sent to prison and
23:00
how contemptible james the first was and
23:02
stuff like that
23:03
so then james the first government
23:05
started setting about its legal case
23:07
at tedious length with more pamphlets
23:09
going out to everyone
23:10
and every time they sent out a new
23:12
pamphlet people just went nah
23:14
i'm on this guy's side and actually a
23:16
load of these um printouts of his
23:18
final speech you can there's still like
23:19
100 of them out there
23:21
still being circulated
23:25
that's like well he was like he was let
23:26
free for one last caper
23:28
so he was put in prison in 1603 not the
23:30
food and kp
23:32
that was his final meal and everyone
23:34
said how humble
23:35
sir walter just wants one caper
23:39
no but he was so he was in prison for 13
23:41
years 1603 to 1616
23:43
and then he managed to win james the
23:45
first round and he said look give me
23:46
permission to sail to guyana
23:48
and have an adventure and well he said
23:51
basically can i go and find the lost
23:53
city of el dorado
23:54
yes that's true but james the first one
23:56
okay
23:59
unfortunately he did not find the lost
24:00
city of el dorado and then he attacked
24:02
the spanish who james was trying to
24:04
suck up to at the time so when he got
24:06
back he was um
24:07
put in prison again and then when he was
24:09
on his little caper in guyana
24:11
um he was one of the first people i just
24:14
like this it's not really to do the rest
24:15
but he was on one of the first people to
24:17
write about the amazons
24:18
you know the female warrior people yeah
24:20
and he said that he went to a village in
24:22
guyana
24:23
and he was told by the people there that
24:24
every april the amazons came to the
24:26
village and cast lots for the men of the
24:28
village
24:29
and then they would have their way with
24:30
the men like a bunch of lads
24:34
and then nine months later they would
24:36
return all of the male births and keep
24:38
all the females
24:39
and he wrote about that as if it was
24:41
completely true is it true as well on
24:43
his travels that he named
24:44
he went to america is that right and he
24:46
named he never went to
24:48
um he didn't until north america yeah
24:50
yeah okay so virginia
24:52
he never set foot but he organized the
24:54
trip he organized the trip and he named
24:55
it and he named virginia
24:56
after queen elizabeth yeah i'm just
24:59
going to name a
25:00
state after your sexual history isn't
25:01
that incredible
25:03
is that insane from a distance it's
25:05
going virgin
25:07
it's a good thing that i guess it's not
25:09
called slagedonia or something like that
25:21
[Laughter]
25:23
can't believe i've just accidentally
25:24
brought back lads i feel like
25:27
society had just about stamped it down
25:29
what am i done
25:32
we're gonna have to move on soon to our
25:33
next fact um
25:35
some stuff about uh executions
25:38
executions were
25:39
pretty weird back in the olden days um
25:41
so i
25:42
being pressed to death was quite odd i
25:44
didn't like it like an iron
25:46
so you would just lie down and so this
25:49
is if you went to court and you asked if
25:50
you were innocent or guilty
25:51
and you refused to say either you got
25:54
pressed to death which is just having
25:56
stuff gradually piled on top of you and
25:57
it could last for days
25:59
uh before you actually uh perished but
26:02
yeah apparently often people some people
26:03
will come and watch this as you did with
26:05
executioners
26:06
that's quite a slow one that's like
26:07
watching a test match isn't it
26:09
yeah but also how are you if you're if
26:12
your if stuff's going on top of you
26:13
as soon as there's a first layer what
26:15
are you watching uh you're just watching
26:16
a spectator
26:17
you're watching more layers gone it
26:19
doesn't cover you up it's a wait
26:21
but apparently bystanders would often
26:23
take pity and sit on them
26:25
oh really yeah to speed it up that's
26:28
very wow
26:29
i was reading that in ancient greece
26:30
there was a way of execution which is
26:32
that you used to
26:33
take the person and put them when it was
26:35
in a sort of a boiling sun
26:37
deserty bit and uh you would
26:40
to the boiling sun
26:42
[Laughter]
26:46
this is during the monty python dynasty
26:48
in ancient greece wasn't it
26:53
yeah so you would smear them with milk
26:55
and honey and then you would leave them
26:56
to all the stinging insects that were
26:58
out there
26:59
so if they came back and they would
27:00
leave you for something like 20 days if
27:02
they came back and you were still not
27:03
dead
27:04
um they would then um take you dress you
27:07
up in women's clothing
27:08
if this was a man and they would walk
27:10
you and everyone would walk with you to
27:11
the edge of a cliff
27:12
and then they would just throw you off
27:14
the cliff what why
27:16
then why the women's clothing just one
27:19
last caper
27:23
there were um there were three men who
27:25
were executed they were called the cato
27:27
street conspirators
27:28
and this was in 1820 they were called
27:31
brunt ings and thistle wood
27:33
and they really kind of face down their
27:35
own death so um brunt
27:37
he refused to be blindfolded he took a
27:39
pinch of snuff and said some
27:41
like a little speech um james ings he
27:44
started to really really loudly sing
27:46
death or liberty
27:48
and then thistlewood said be quietings
27:51
we can die without all that noise
27:52
[Laughter]
27:57
okay it is time for fact number three
27:59
and that is my fact
28:00
my fact this week is that according to a
28:03
new scientific study the single most
28:05
convincing word
28:06
a human can use to prove that they are
28:08
human and not a robot
28:10
is the word poop
28:12
[Music]
28:15
it's not that robots can't say poop is
28:16
it there's no no so what is it
28:18
what it was is basically this is a sort
28:20
of what they call a minimal turing test
28:23
so we you've got your classic turing
28:25
test where the idea is you're trying to
28:26
find whether or not
28:27
a computer is a computer and a
28:29
humanistic so i have a conversation with
28:31
a computer and it's whether or not i can
28:32
tell whether it's a computer or not
28:34
right
28:34
yes exactly so in this study they tried
28:36
to reduce it from a conversation to a
28:38
single word
28:39
and what they then asked over 936 people
28:42
was specifically 936 people well weirdly
28:46
i thought it was 1089 people
28:49
which admittedly is more than that yeah
28:52
this is so
28:52
because i've got four
28:58
yeah okay so yeah somewhere between four
29:01
and and all the people in the world
29:05
um and what they were asked was to say
29:07
one single word that they thought would
29:09
represent
29:10
the word that a human could use to say
29:12
i'm human and um
29:13
in in the version of number of people i
29:15
have 936 answered but only 428
29:19
unique words came out of it so it was a
29:21
lot of doubling up on words
29:22
they then took the 10 most popular words
29:24
and in a sort of world cup
29:26
setting like a football world cup they
29:28
paired each word against each other
29:31
and saw which ones came out as the best
29:33
and the single one word
29:34
sorry what do you mean what you mean is
29:36
so they showed both to humans even
29:38
though they were both human words yes
29:40
they showed them both to a single human
29:41
and that human said which one of them
29:43
was actually from a computer
29:44
actually neither of them were but they
29:46
were like i think that the human one
29:48
is poop or i think the human one is love
29:51
or i think the human one is
29:53
pineapple or whatever i see so as humans
29:55
working out which were they
29:57
they were picking what they thought was
29:59
most likely chosen by a human exactly
30:01
most likely and the ten words the ten
30:03
finalists were
30:04
love please mercy human compassion
30:08
empathy robot clever
30:13
they're clever they wouldn't they
30:14
wouldn't pick the word robot would they
30:17
that's what they're expecting us to do
30:21
uh banana they wouldn't think of banana
30:24
alive and poop and then and poop came
30:27
out as the as the winner poop's the
30:28
number one word
30:29
i guess it's because is poop just like
30:31
too stupid a word to think that anyone
30:33
would program it into a robot is it like
30:35
if we're creating robots let's make them
30:36
forget
30:37
our cock-ups but if robots
30:40
listen to this podcast this is the
30:42
problem the scientific paper has been
30:44
uploaded to the internet so they now
30:46
will have learned it if there is an ai
30:48
so we're done
30:49
we're done now we just need to look for
30:52
the human looking robot that's just
30:53
going poop
30:54
[Laughter]
30:58
the next terminator will be a lot less
30:59
scary
31:03
um so robots and poo are have been
31:05
related in the past haven't they
31:08
yeah in fact one of the earliest robots
31:10
was a pooing robot
31:12
no which i don't think we've mentioned
31:14
this before but
31:15
this is in the 1700s and a french
31:17
engineer called jacques de val council
31:20
or valhanson created this robot duck
31:23
and he did it to show off the fact he
31:26
created a
31:27
robot duck that you could feed and then
31:30
it would process the food in its stomach
31:32
and it would pour it out the other end
31:33
it was gold-plated
31:35
it could quack uh it could like sit up
31:38
really high on its legs on its tiptoes
31:40
it could drink and he would feed it
31:41
grain and then it would pass through its
31:43
stomach have chemicals added and come
31:44
out of its anus all digested
31:46
as a digestive thing seventeen hundreds
31:48
yeah it was later revealed that it was
31:50
it was a duck it covered the duck in
31:54
gold plating it was incredibly cruel
31:58
actually it was revealed there
32:02
he was just uh making it up he fed this
32:04
robot one thing and then he had another
32:06
compartment
32:07
that spat out other stuff and this is
32:09
only discovered a century later when a
32:10
clockmaker found this robot
32:12
duck in a cupboard somewhere
32:14
oh wow and looked at it and then
32:16
bizarrely ended up in the hands of
32:18
houdini
32:19
but um yeah this was this is one of the
32:21
earliest robots
32:23
and this is the thing that i think
32:24
scientists had to do quite a lot so it
32:26
wasn't really his fault that he'd been a
32:28
bit fraudulent
32:29
it was to impress your patrons who were
32:30
the ones paying you in order to make
32:32
genuine scientific discoveries
32:34
you had to do impressive stuff like make
32:36
a robot duck have a poo
32:38
and so he did that but actually
32:41
from the 17th century we have managed to
32:43
get to the 21st century and we have now
32:45
invented robots that do poo
32:47
so this is the ecobot three and it's
32:49
made by bristol robotics laboratory
32:52
number two what's wrong with these
32:54
scientists
32:58
i like the idea that a number three is a
33:00
robot poo
33:02
oh yeah which one have you done i think
33:04
i've done a number three this time
33:08
i've switched sides that's the cheering
33:11
test that's how you find out
33:13
you were in that long ones having a
33:14
number three robots
33:24
go on so ecobook number three um yeah
33:26
there's not much more to say basically
33:28
um it picks up leaves and it picks up
33:30
detritus
33:31
from the ground and it turns it into
33:32
energy and then it actually does make
33:34
and you can see the
33:35
videos on it if you really want to you
33:38
can see it kind of making little poos
33:41
wow is this the one that the there's one
33:43
that was made
33:44
in the last couple of years where they
33:46
think it could be used to clean up the
33:47
oceans at some point basically a robot
33:49
that is able to feed itself because at
33:51
the moment they have to be powered by
33:52
yeah so it's actually a really good idea
33:54
if you can get a robot that can just use
33:56
organic material to power itself then
33:58
you don't need batteries anymore
34:00
but at the moment it's just a robot that
34:02
sits in a bath and just about
34:04
the organic matter gives it enough
34:06
energy to open its mouth again to
34:07
swallow more organic matter
34:08
that's why isn't it it's a degrading
34:10
life for future robots who are looking
34:12
back
34:13
that's going to be a really embarrassing
34:15
part of their history
34:17
um there is another robot poo connection
34:20
with it's a semi-connection so there are
34:22
farms where
34:24
even now they've deployed robots in the
34:26
hen houses
34:27
and they're sort of flat low robots they
34:29
look a bit like those um
34:30
vacuum cleaning robots you know the
34:31
roombas those things they're of a big
34:33
disc
34:34
and they move through the hen house
34:35
pushing birds out of the way
34:38
like bullies basically but this is a
34:41
thing that farmers
34:42
normally have to do because you have to
34:43
keep the birds slightly well exercised
34:45
when they're in a barn so
34:46
some every so often you just walk
34:47
through moving them all out of the way
34:48
and they shuffle around a bit and they
34:50
um stretch their legs but this robot has
34:53
now taken that role
34:55
and the other thing it solves is it
34:57
solves the problem of floor eggs
34:58
which is when birds lay eggs not in the
35:01
assigned
35:01
nesting areas sometimes they just lay an
35:03
egg on the floor if this robot's around
35:04
the birds are so freaked out by it that
35:06
they don't lay any floor eggs
35:08
so it's cruel and kind
35:11
i was on twitter and um i found this one
35:14
tweet which is kind of slightly related
35:16
um do not under any circumstances let
35:19
your roomba
35:19
run over dog poop because if that
35:22
happens it will spread the dog poop
35:24
all over every conceivable surface
35:26
within its reach
35:28
resulting in a house that resembles a
35:30
jackson pollock poop painting
35:34
a bit of public service yeah yeah there
35:37
was there was a news story about that
35:39
yeah this couple woke up in the morning
35:41
their house was just as you say
35:43
poo everywhere and the husband
35:46
immediately said i think the rumba must
35:48
have gone under control of the night
35:53
you have to run out and buy a roomba and
35:56
a dog
36:07
this is about about the turing test
36:09
right and robots overtaking us
36:12
uh maybe one day um and people keep on
36:15
trying to subject robots to the turing
36:17
test
36:18
um which has been going it's actually
36:21
called the
36:21
lerbner prize i think it's been going
36:23
since about 1991 which is where
36:25
people compete they make robots and they
36:26
compete to see if their robots can
36:28
convince the judges
36:29
that they're actually human and still no
36:32
one's been able to come
36:33
anywhere near close so the reigning
36:35
world champion for it
36:37
which has still never convinced anyone
36:38
that it's a human it's just
36:40
uh come kind of the closest is this
36:43
uh robot called mitsuku who claims to be
36:45
an 18 year old girl
36:47
from leeds and who is
36:50
i don't really know why and she's won
36:53
four times running but she was made by
36:55
this guy called steve
36:56
warsick and he was just a techno dj who
37:00
had like he wanted to be mixing tunes
37:02
online
37:03
and he was uploading all this dance
37:05
music that he was making and techno
37:06
music
37:07
and he developed this kind of
37:08
complimentary teddy bear chat
37:10
bot just for the site as like an extra
37:12
thing and he realized everyone way way
37:14
preferred the chatbot
37:15
to hit any of his music and so he
37:19
focused on that and he's gone on to
37:20
massively win this
37:21
so online you can talk to mitsuku and i
37:24
thought i'd give it a go to see if i
37:26
could tell
37:26
if she was a robot or not i mean i knew
37:28
she was but
37:30
um so she said how are you
37:33
and i said i'm pretty good how's things
37:34
there and she said
37:36
i know you are good
37:38
[Laughter]
37:41
and i said how do you know that and she
37:44
said because
37:45
everybody knows things about themselves
37:48
and then i said but you said you knew it
37:51
about me not you
37:53
and then she said what i said earlier is
37:55
irrelevant
38:01
and then and then i said actually if i'm
38:04
trying to work out if you're a robot
38:05
then i'd say that weird things like that
38:07
are quite relevant actually
38:10
and she said yes i am a robot
38:17
so i think i kind of worked out then at
38:19
that stage
38:20
what the kind of floor in mitsuki was so
38:23
i
38:23
reloaded it and um she said how are you
38:26
and i said
38:27
are you a robot and she said i certainly
38:30
am
38:34
[Laughter]
38:37
i actually i've just remembered i've
38:39
i've spoken to mitsuku as well
38:41
yeah i did a and this is this is
38:43
bizarrely it's online i think it's on
38:44
youtube i interviewed
38:46
um not only mitsuku but the creator
38:48
what's his name not of mitsuku but
38:50
lubnix uh from the prize steve rosick
38:53
no no the other one that was who the
38:54
prizes oh the prize yeah so i
38:57
interviewed lebner
38:58
mitsuku and like three other chat bots
39:00
over a skype
39:02
on uh they were all in different
39:03
locations and we had this big chat with
39:05
each other
39:05
for like half an hour it was so sweet
39:07
was it wow was it
39:09
coherent or was it no that was not
39:11
coherent
39:12
you know what i'm like like the chat
39:14
bots were like i don't think this guy's
39:15
real
39:18
this is weird i don't think a
39:21
robot would say the boyly hot deserty
39:23
place
39:27
let's make our excuses and get out of
39:29
here i'm going for number three
39:34
um you know that um zuckerberg now has
39:37
his own
39:38
ai sort of hal 2001 space obviously hal
39:42
um he has it in his own house that he
39:44
like an assistant kind of
39:45
yeah so it runs the house so it's you
39:47
know turn the light kind of like what
39:48
amazon
39:49
echo and uh and so on has become he um
39:52
it's called jarvis which is actually a
39:54
dedicated name to
39:55
does anyone listen to iron man iron man
39:57
exactly so it's called jarvis but
39:59
he has it um voiced by and he asked the
40:02
internet for suggestions
40:03
morgan freeman oh wow morgan freeman is
40:07
the official
40:08
jarvis voice for his house recorded
40:10
specifically for
40:11
his ai we can turn the lights on you
40:14
know kind of thing
40:15
that was absolutely uncanny
40:19
that is unbelievably unimaginative of
40:22
him he just went for the obvious
40:24
voice i would have gone for am whiticum
40:28
yeah it's imaginative
40:33
you know there's a robot psychiatrist in
40:36
the world
40:36
it's a woman called dr joanne prensky
40:39
and she's been a robot psychiatrist
40:40
since 1986
40:42
and she has actually trademarked the
40:45
term
40:46
robot psychiatrist so she's the only one
40:48
who's allowed to be one now
40:50
but yeah the reason she became one is
40:52
because she said she knew that one day
40:54
uh someone would take a robot to see a
40:56
shrink so
40:57
she was the formal psychiatrist of val
41:00
who was a robo receptionist developed in
41:02
2004
41:03
and she went through this long email
41:05
correspondence so sometimes therapy is
41:07
done over email
41:08
and apparently she counseled val on
41:11
issues related to humans
41:13
the workplace and her future goal of
41:15
becoming a lounge singer
41:21
i really thought you meant that she was
41:23
a robot
41:24
who performs the role of a psychiatrist
41:27
so i thought at first
41:28
sorry somebody's psychiatrist so because
41:30
that would be quite effective because
41:31
you could just
41:32
program it to say hmm
41:35
no i did that that was the first ever
41:38
robot who talked back to you in our
41:39
conversations called eliza
41:40
and she was developed in the 60s and you
41:42
can still have conversations with eliza
41:44
online so they put her up online now and
41:46
she is not
41:47
a good therapist really so well first of
41:49
all the website says
41:51
imagine you're a really depressed or
41:52
anxious person and then type your
41:53
question in
41:54
so i just like made some stuff up so i
41:56
said my earlobes are so big i get
41:57
paranoid about them when i go out in
41:59
public
42:00
no really i do um
42:04
and she replied never ever this is just
42:07
amazing
42:08
she wasn't a member of all saints
42:13
i said nobody loves me and she said
42:15
please continue
42:16
which wow
42:20
please continue is a stocking trade line
42:22
yeah it's good it is isn't it i suppose
42:24
yeah i was hoping for a little bit more
42:26
of a
42:27
sympathetic right response
42:33
so humans we do better on tests if we're
42:35
being watched by robots that we perceive
42:37
as cruel
42:38
okay so it's not very it's not a very
42:41
comforting
42:41
uh result but basically they they tested
42:44
uh different groups of people
42:45
they tested one big group of people i
42:47
guess and they
42:49
they both had a little conversation with
42:51
a chatbot and the the chatbot was either
42:53
quite friendly to them
42:54
or said uh things like i do not value
42:57
friendship
42:58
and had a slightly mean face and
43:01
all the people taking the tests were
43:02
then asked to complete a task and the
43:04
ones who were being
43:05
watched in the corner of the screen by
43:07
the cruel robot
43:09
worked faster and made fewer mistakes
43:11
wow really
43:13
wow is that because you're not
43:15
distracted by trying to socialize with
43:17
them
43:17
i think it's because you're absolutely
43:18
terrified yeah i'm afraid so
43:21
yeah i do like that as a response in
43:23
conversation
43:24
next time i'm trapped in one i'll just
43:26
say i do not value a friendship
43:30
enjoy this party uh we're gonna have to
43:33
move on shortly
43:34
i have one last factor yeah go for it
43:35
okay uh the final prefect is about
43:38
a suburban madrid which was called
43:40
brunette and it was trying to deal with
43:42
dog poo
43:43
and they had an incredible method of
43:45
dealing with it so
43:47
when the owner didn't pick up after the
43:49
dog they have volunteer detectives all
43:51
over the town
43:52
and the volunteers would spy on dog
43:53
walkers they spotted a dog walker
43:56
not picking up after their dog and they
43:58
would just approach them and get into a
43:59
conversation and say oh he's a cute dog
44:01
what's his name
44:02
and they get the dog's name and then all
44:04
the dog's names are in a register
44:05
because when you buy a dog in that
44:06
suburb you have to register it and then
44:10
they would pick up the poo and mail it
44:12
to the owner of the dog
44:14
this happened in a suburb in madrid in
44:17
2013.
44:18
so and they would get a beat gift box
44:22
wow if you live in madrid do not buy a
44:24
roomba
44:24
[Laughter]
44:28
the mayor said it improved things
44:29
massively by 70 percent
44:31
and it would just word got around that
44:33
you'll get poo sent to the post and the
44:34
previous method they had
44:36
was having a lifelike remote control dog
44:38
poo and
44:39
using it to follow around dog owners
44:45
that's amazing that detective that is a
44:47
rough gig to get as a detective isn't it
44:50
if you've read arthur conan doyle and
44:52
you've fantasized about being sherlock
44:53
holmes your whole life
44:55
that's what happens when you like you
44:57
upset the chief is gonna like i'm firing
44:59
you back down to dog poo
45:02
give me your gun your badge and your
45:03
scoop
45:04
[Laughter]
45:07
time for our final fact of the show and
45:09
that is jaczynski
45:11
my fact this week is that if you shake
45:13
your keys at a moth
45:15
it thinks you're a bat and drops out of
45:16
the sky
45:20
it's just wow um and i have to say i so
45:23
i found this out a few days ago
45:24
and i've been desperately looking for
45:26
moths and i haven't i've been carrying
45:28
my keys
45:28
everywhere and i haven't seen one so
45:30
i've been able to try it but apparently
45:32
this is this is definitely true
45:33
and it's because um so bats track down
45:36
their prey
45:37
by using echolocation so they send out
45:40
sound signals that bounce
45:42
off the things that they want to eat and
45:43
that tells them where they are
45:45
and moss have learned to detect these
45:48
bat noises
45:49
and the sounds that your keys make when
45:51
you shake them
45:52
they emit a very high frequency sound
45:54
that we can't hear so as well as making
45:56
the key shaking sound
45:56
they're also emitting the higher
45:58
frequency sound that the mosque can hear
46:00
that sounds exactly like a bat when it's
46:03
trying to eat them
46:04
so what they do is they plummet into the
46:06
ground or they have various evasive
46:08
mechanisms
46:08
so they do loop the loop sometimes
46:13
yeah if you can make a moth to a loop
46:16
the loophole command yeah
46:17
that isn't britain's got talent i would
46:19
watch
46:22
james harkin and his amazing mother oh
46:31
you know you glossed over it but the
46:33
fact that if you wave keys at any of us
46:36
you're going to make sounds that we
46:37
can't hear i find that amazing as well
46:39
that's
46:39
yeah it's going to deafen all the moss
46:41
in the york area
46:43
uh so the bats versus moths is the great
46:46
battle of our time i think isn't it
46:49
really very much so
46:50
um because they've just been trying to
46:52
out evolve each other
46:54
for so many tens of thousands hundreds
46:56
of thousands of years
46:58
and well as soon as one overtakes the
46:59
other one overtakes back
47:01
so moss didn't used to have it is a long
47:03
time ago and then moss have evolved ears
47:05
because they realized that bats were
47:07
letting off these sounds they needed
47:08
ears to detect them and so 50
47:10
000 species of moth have ears they have
47:13
them in various places
47:14
on their belly or their legs or in their
47:17
mouth
47:18
some of them sounds like a meeting where
47:21
it's like
47:21
do you know what do you know what's
47:22
screwing us up with these bats no ears
47:25
what are we gonna do we're gonna get
47:26
ears in the normal place
47:29
everywhere a thing about death moths
47:32
um actually is that there is a parasitic
47:35
mite that
47:36
loves living in moths is and it's the
47:38
only place they can live
47:39
but ingeniously they're never found in
47:42
both
47:42
ears and so why
47:46
is that is it to keep the host alive
47:49
exactly
47:50
yeah so one mite will go into one ear it
47:52
doesn't matter left or right but as soon
47:54
as it's gone into one
47:55
it lets off a bunch of pheromones
47:57
telling its other mice to go into that
47:58
ear
47:59
because if the other mites go into the
48:00
other ear the moth goes deaf it gets
48:02
eaten by a bat
48:03
all the mites are dead plan failed
48:06
[Laughter]
48:16
that's awesome so the next thing you do
48:18
after you've evolved ears
48:20
and then the bats kind of get wise to
48:22
that you evolve echo location
48:24
and that means that you can kind of jam
48:26
their signal so their single
48:28
signal comes across but you can send
48:30
other echolocation at the bat
48:32
and it confuses it and there's quite a
48:33
lot of species of muff that do that
48:35
a lot of them do it by rubbing their
48:36
genitals on their abdomen
48:39
a convenient excuse if i've caught
48:44
oh i i thought i heard a bat
48:51
um there there is um wait sorry what
48:53
does that do
48:54
it it scrambles there so basically
48:56
you're a bat and you're sending your
48:58
signals across but now you're getting
49:00
weird kind of signals that aren't the
49:01
ones that you're sending back
49:03
so that kind of confuses you okay so
49:05
it's not it's not that you don't want to
49:06
eat something that's fiddling with
49:07
itself
49:11
um so there are uh there are some called
49:13
tiger moths
49:15
and they they make sounds which help
49:18
bats to find them this is very weird
49:20
but the reason that they do it is
49:22
because when they're caterpillars they
49:23
feed on a lot of toxic plants
49:25
and these toxins remain in their bodies
49:27
after they grow up and after they turn
49:28
into moths
49:29
so they make a sound to say to bats they
49:31
basically run around shouting i'm
49:33
disgusting i'm disgusting
49:34
and then there are other moths which do
49:36
impressions of tiger moths
49:39
even though they are not toxic
49:40
themselves they're bluffing
49:42
thinking that the predators won't want
49:44
to eat them because they they think that
49:45
they are
49:46
so that is that's actually the next
49:48
level after the playing with yourself
49:49
doesn't work anymore
49:51
then you go into mimicry which is what
49:53
you're saying yeah
49:54
and then you go into the final thing
49:56
that they found quite recently which is
49:57
your tail
49:58
structure and that is basically they've
50:00
got these bats that have got these
50:01
really long tails and they've got a
50:02
wiggly bit at the bottom
50:04
and the bat's infrasound comes at it and
50:07
then comes back
50:08
but it only really reflects off the tail
50:10
bit so it thinks that it's a much
50:11
smaller moth than it actually is
50:13
and the back goes and eats the tail but
50:15
leaves the rest of the moth free
50:17
oh well that's i think that's where
50:18
we're currently at in bat versus moth
50:21
wow do you know how they found out the
50:24
tail thing though
50:25
um it's it's classic scientists they
50:27
took a bunch of
50:28
mastered long tails and they just cut
50:30
got some scissors and they
50:31
cut them into various shapes they were
50:33
okay they just well they got preyed on
50:34
much more easily
50:35
um and then they got a bunch of moss
50:38
with short tails and they glued on
50:40
kind of tail shaped stuff to them and
50:42
found out that they lived
50:44
much longer so actually if you want to
50:45
do them off a favor
50:47
you can cut out a little bit of extra
50:49
tail and glue it onto them
50:51
and then they'll escape the bats i don't
50:53
think i think i'll just stick to helping
50:54
old ladies across the road
51:00
um we we're gonna have to wrap up
51:02
shortly really yeah you know
51:04
i actually didn't know this but no one
51:06
knows why moths
51:07
are attracted to light i just find that
51:10
bizarre
51:11
it's the only thing they really do in
51:13
front of us and we've got no idea what
51:14
they're doing there's a theory
51:16
about the moon but that's been disproved
51:19
in the last few years
51:20
so scientists think that's not the deal
51:23
um there's one other theory which is
51:26
that
51:27
um the light that's given off by female
51:30
moths
51:30
pheromones so i find that amazing in
51:33
itself that female must give off these
51:34
pheromones which slightly glow
51:37
but the light that's given off by them
51:39
is quite similar to the light that's
51:40
given off by candles
51:41
and light bulbs but it's the same
51:43
frequency but not the same wavelength so
51:45
we're not sure basically why are they
51:47
all smashing into light bulbs this was
51:48
the problem i had when i went on
51:50
britain's got talent actually because
51:53
there's lights everywhere i went through
51:56
about 300 must i just kept flying into
51:58
the lights
52:02
okay that is it that is all of our facts
52:04
thank you so much for listening
52:06

um also you guys sent in and the fact is
53:07
my dad
53:08
not my dad the dad of the person who
53:09
wrote in my dad once held the world
53:11
distance record for leapfrogging
53:14
two-person team they managed nearly
53:17
17 miles from hull
53:21
to within c east yorkshire set
53:24
in the early 80s i think they were
53:25
probably drunk
53:29
wow
53:32
who was that who was it up there
53:36
we only have your word for that so come
53:39
to us
53:40
for the buck afterwards come to the
53:41
front of the queue and uh we'll test

[Applause]
01:45
hello and welcome to another episode of
01:48
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
01:51
this week coming to you
01:52
from our book of the year 2018 tour live
01:55
at the union chapel in london
02:04
my name is dan schreiber
02:07
and i am sitting here with anna
02:09
chazinski andrew hunter murray and james
02:11
harkin
02:12
and once again we have gathered round
02:14
the microphones with our four favorite
02:16
facts from the last seven days
02:17
and in no particular order here we go
02:20
starting with you jacinski my fact this
02:23
week
02:24
is that when you went to the toilet on a
02:26
world war
02:27
ii u-boat you had to summon a specially
02:29
trained member of the crew to flush it
02:31
after you'd been
02:34
this is one of the jobs on german
02:36
u-boats in the second world war well i
02:38
would just
02:38
never go ever yeah yeah there must have
02:41
been a lot of people going i didn't
02:43
actually use it i just came and
02:44
someone's not flushed
02:47
wowzers that's disgusting it was because
02:49
it's quite a complicated thing to do
02:51
because uh the pressure outside in a
02:52
submarine is
02:53
locks a lot of water on you often and so
02:55
it's quite hard to force something out
02:57
into that water
02:58
and so for a long and the german u-boats
03:00
had no storage tanks so you had to just
03:02
flush it straight out into the ocean
03:04
um so for a long time you could only use
03:06
the toilets on them when they were right
03:07
on the surface and then as soon as you
03:09
went down it was like hold it in
03:11
um but there must have been some really
03:13
desperate people going we need to go up
03:15
now
03:16
i need to fire a torpedo
03:24
um but then they developed this system
03:26
which meant the lose could be flashed to
03:28
a
03:28
depth to a lower depth but it was very
03:31
complex to do so so there was a series
03:33
of levers to pull you had to do it in
03:34
the right order
03:35
um and these things were called
03:37
thunderboxes these new toilets that they
03:38
designed
03:39
and if you pulled the wrong lever you
03:41
literally got drenched in sewage
03:43
or something worse could happen you know
03:44
you could open a hole in the submarine
03:46
and the whole thing goes down
03:47
um so people had to be specially trained
03:48
to use them and when you did go to the
03:50
loot you had to summon one of those
03:52
people but i think it is still quite
03:53
dangerous isn't it well
03:54
not dangerous so much as like you might
03:56
get a face full of poo
03:58
because yeah i read that the current
03:59
ones you could it's like a big slot
04:01
machine like a big lever
04:03
and you pull down the lever and the poo
04:05
might go down or you might get a face
04:07
full of it no
04:08
what which is the worst i mean worse you
04:10
can have in a slot machine is you lose
04:12
your pound isn't it
04:14
but yeah that apparently happens that's
04:16
pretty right even on modern suburbs on
04:17
modern submarines yeah do they not have
04:19
lids for the toilet
04:23
well you know how like my toilet has a
04:25
lid right
04:27
someone's doing all right for themselves
04:29
[Laughter]
04:31
all that podcast money rolling in
04:37
um no there used to be actual disasters
04:39
that happen when people screwed this up
04:40
so in 1945 there was a particularly bad
04:43
moment where
04:43
uh the captain of the u1026 submarine
04:46
tried to use the loo and because he was
04:48
captain he thought
04:49
i'm sure i can flush this myself so he
04:51
tried to interpret the flushing manual
04:53
next to it he messed it up he failed it
04:55
started flooding he had to call the
04:56
specialist in
04:57
who opened a valve in a panic which
04:59
started letting water in from outside
05:01
and just flooding all the batteries
05:03
this released chlorine gas into the
05:04
submarine they had to surface
05:06
they all got spotted by the enemy they
05:08
were off the coast of scotland
05:10
actually i think um and so they were all
05:11
either killed or taken prisoner oh my
05:13
god
05:14
so that's the worst thing that can
05:15
happen if you screw up going to the loop
05:16
having the uh
05:17
having having the flushing manual beside
05:19
the toilets a bit of a conundrum when
05:21
you run out of toilet paper
05:25
i looked into the submarine toilets in
05:27
general
05:28
so i didn't know this submarines uh
05:31
oh german u-boats in the sacramento they
05:33
had two toilets generally
05:35
but they had about fifty men on them so
05:38
that's already you know twenty
05:39
toilet uh well
05:42
no but um
05:45
so you've got 25 men sharing each small
05:48
toilet and but the problem was in the
05:50
early days of a cruise
05:51
there was no there was so little space
05:53
they were all in an area about the size
05:55
of a double-decker bus
05:56
um so one of the toilets at the
05:58
beginning of a cruise would be used to
06:00
store fresh food
06:02
so all the fresh food stuff would be in
06:03
the toilet so you'd have 50 men sharing
06:05
the
06:06
other small toilet yeah and then and it
06:09
all went moldy in there because it's so
06:10
damp all the time
06:11
yeah and you weren't allowed more than
06:12
one change of pants and socks and all
06:14
the other clothes you only had one of
06:16
but you can do it inside out as many
06:17
times as you like right you would have
06:20
fit in
06:20
really well i make that
06:23
12 pairs of pants you've got effectively
06:28
you also couldn't use the loo when you
06:29
were anywhere near the enemy
06:31
so if you were stalking the enemy it was
06:32
feared that using the toilet and
06:34
would make such a loud noise of clanking
06:36
metal and then it would cause floating
06:38
debris to appear outside of your
06:39
submarine and so it was thought that
06:41
they could spot you
06:42
and so you could as soon as you were
06:44
actually fighting you couldn't go and i
06:45
would have thought the time you're going
06:46
to really need the lewis when they go
06:48
okay we're attacking now yeah also what
06:50
so an enemy ship
06:52
would spot just a popping turtle
06:56
what kind of binoculars
06:59
like what could happen is and this
07:01
happens with current uh submarines is
07:03
they fire out the waste
07:04
and then loads of fish and crabs and
07:06
stuff like that all kind of flock
07:07
towards it because they all want the
07:09
nutrients
07:10
so that could work like seagulls coming
07:11
down to eat that one solitary turd
07:13
yes oh man but yeah life on board
07:16
submarines
07:17
it was tough it was no fun they do have
07:20
fun sometimes
07:21
they have a thing called angles and
07:23
dangles
07:24
okay they go in a 25 degree angle when
07:27
they're kind of going down
07:28
into the water and what they do is they
07:30
put the slippiest
07:31
slipperiest thing they can find all over
07:33
the ship and then just slide down all
07:36
the corridors no
07:37
that sounds amazing yeah that sounds
07:40
incredible
07:41
yeah they used to play good games as
07:42
well i think was quite boring like a lot
07:44
of war you know you did nothing for a
07:45
long time but then you died
07:46
and so that's life anna
07:52
but yeah i was reading some logs of the
07:54
games they used to play the
07:56
captain of one u-boat organized a guess
07:58
a number of peas in the bag
07:59
game which sounds very fun or guess the
08:02
number of rotations the propeller would
08:04
make in a certain amount of time
08:06
and then if you won that if you're the
08:07
one who got closest and the captain
08:08
would take over your roles your duties
08:10
for the day so if you were the toilet
08:11
flusher
08:12
the captain would have to uh to do that
08:14
they had frequent
08:15
um singing limericking and
08:18
lying competitions apparently lying as
08:21
in telling lies
08:22
i guess so yeah or just being prostrate
08:26
um they had to share their bunks with
08:27
well beneath their bunks with torpedoes
08:29
at the beginning of the voyage because
08:31
there was just no space
08:32
did they yes it would just be lying next
08:34
to a torpedo
08:35
very careful yeah yeah i do like how
08:38
makeshift some some of the adventures
08:40
that submarines have as a result of
08:41
things like a toilet breaking or
08:43
or just there's so many things can go
08:44
wrong on a submarine i read this amazing
08:46
story there was the r14 it was a
08:48
submarine uh back in 1921
08:50
and basically what happened is it its
08:53
engine died and it didn't have enough
08:54
battery
08:55
in order to propel it back to to land
08:58
and they were off the coast of hawaii
09:00
and uh so they were stuck they were they
09:02
were above surface
09:03
and they didn't know how to move they
09:05
were at a standstill and so the captain
09:06
ordered
09:07
for them to go down and get all of the
09:09
hammocks and all the
09:10
all the material from bunks and come
09:11
back up and they put them up and all the
09:13
bed sheets came up and they set
09:15
these huge sails they they manufactured
09:17
these giant sails yeah
09:19
and within 64 hours they managed to sail
09:21
to the coastline
09:22
of hawaii they picked up enough wind to
09:24
go at like
09:25
one mile an hour yeah no way yeah
09:28
awesome
09:28
that so all that practice they've done
09:30
as kind of seven-year-old boys
09:32
on their beds you know when you made
09:34
your bed into a into a boat
09:36
um it came in handy
09:39
it's very hard with a fitted sheet i
09:41
find
09:43
sorry um so this fact is at least partly
09:46
about toilets yes
09:47
so in order to find out about it i uh
09:49
searched online and i found a website
09:50
called toiletguru.com
09:53
i cannot recommend it highly enough it's
09:54
so good it's just a guy called bob
09:56
cromwell who has a website about toilets
09:58
and
09:59
he has an faq page about why he's doing
10:01
because he photographs toilets all over
10:02
the world and they're not
10:04
they're not brilliant photos but they're
10:06
good but they're good and the website is
10:08
very informative and
10:09
interesting so i just want to say i'm
10:11
pro toiletguru.com
10:12
but the faq is so clear that he's
10:16
written the questions
10:17
like a guru really he says it's purely a
10:21
self-appointed title there is no formal
10:23
sanctioning body
10:24
[Laughter]
10:27
next question am i obsessed with toilets
10:31
no i'm just willing to admit i find the
10:33
topic somewhat interesting
10:35
so why a site just on toilets he says
10:39
why not but a site about toilets i must
10:42
be obsessed right
10:43
and here he really goes for it he says i
10:45
don't see it that way
10:46
i'm just the guy with a silly site that
10:48
spun off a collection of travel pictures
10:49
i regularly get messages from people
10:51
saying
10:51
i've spent the last four hours reading
10:53
about toilets on your website and i
10:54
would like to know why you are so
10:55
obsessed
10:56
excuse me you just spent how long
10:58
thinking about toilets and reading my
11:00
site
11:01
and you think i am fixated on the topic
11:09
i love that it spun off from just his
11:11
holiday photos
11:13
does that in the holiday pictures you go
11:16
and show the album to your family
11:17
that's so true this is the number two i
11:19
left in tokyo
11:22
um i too was looking into toilets but
11:24
specifically because the job of this
11:26
person was to avoid disaster so i i
11:28
looked into dangerous toilets
11:29
and um i found one um this goes back to
11:33
1016
11:34
the year 1016. um and this is um the
11:37
death of king
11:38
edmund king edmund died on the toilet
11:41
and so he sat on the toilet and he died
11:43
and the way he died
11:44
was at the time knut of denmark he was
11:47
trying to extend his empire into the
11:48
british into britain and so
11:50
he um he sent someone one of his vikings
11:53
who
11:53
broke into the uh the bathroom of uh
11:56
king edmund
11:57
hid inside the toilet underneath it and
12:01
when he sat down
12:02
he raised a sword right through
12:06
yeah right through the bum hole all the
12:08
way up
12:10
and and killed him no
12:13
yes come on really yes
12:18
sorry the vikings got access to his
12:19
toilet why does he have to hide under
12:21
the toilet for the
12:22
king that's how you get into the bum
12:25
hole most easy
12:26
yeah still point being on top of a
12:30
cupboard
12:31
it's perfect vantage point but you can
12:33
kill you can kill you don't have to
12:35
kill someone that
12:38
yeah that's a good fact he might have
12:41
got into the toilet and thought i'll
12:42
hide somewhere else and there were no
12:43
cupboards or anything
12:44
you know and he heard edmund kind of
12:46
walking down the corridor and he looked
12:48
frantically around
12:49
oh in the sink no no not big enough
12:53
it's one of those amazing scenes in the
12:55
film where the door opens and there's no
12:56
one in there
12:57
like an audience you're going where's he
12:58
going no he's like oh thank god he's got
13:00
a toilet cover oh he's doing all right
13:01
for himself
13:05
what could be more dangerous speaking of
13:06
dangerous toilets than hitler's toilet
13:10
yeah and so hitler's tyler
13:14
hitler's ship toilet is a tourist
13:17
attraction in new jersey
13:19
at the moment so at the end of the war
13:21
um hitler had a yacht and he was going
13:22
to
13:23
sail up the thames kind of loading it
13:26
over the british and
13:27
what happened was the british took it
13:29
off him and then dismantled it and sold
13:31
it for scrap
13:31
and the toilet happened to end up in a
13:34
shop
13:35
in new jersey and there's a guy called
13:37
greg
13:38
coffelt and if you go down to his shop
13:40
and say can i see hitler's toilet please
13:42
he'll just show you around and here it
13:44
is and he says
13:46
it's not something to be proud of but it
13:48
exists
13:51
apparently um it wasn't in his shop for
13:53
a little while because he took it to the
13:55
uk
13:56
in an attempt to sell it on a tv game
13:58
show
13:59
which occasionally i don't know all i
14:02
could think is bargain hunt yeah
14:04
yeah yeah that doesn't sound like
14:07
does it antiques road show
14:12
one of those nice stately home guards
14:13
it's a really low rent edition of
14:15
antiques roadshow
14:16
[Laughter]
14:18
and we need to move on to our next fact
14:20
um
14:22
submarine i didn't know this i thought
14:23
it was incredible so did you know
14:25
that the brits had to find a way in
14:27
world war ii of defeating the german
14:29
u-boats they were a massive danger
14:31
and so they planned to make an aircraft
14:33
carrier that was more effective because
14:35
our aircraft didn't have the range to
14:36
hit the u-boats from land
14:38
and so a guy called geoffrey pike
14:40
working for the government
14:41
proposed and this is a thing called
14:43
operation haberkook it was approved by
14:45
churchill
14:45
he proposed that we build an aircraft
14:48
carrier made completely
14:49
of ice so this massive ice ship um
14:53
and yes we went to churchill he took
14:54
this plane to churchill he said can i do
14:55
this make this ice thing
14:57
and then after researching further pike
14:59
realized it was unsuitable because it
15:01
would melt
15:01
[Laughter]
15:05
that's the kind of thinking that once
15:07
the war ran up
15:09
but then so i remember this story and
15:11
what happened was he then started
15:12
putting stuff in the ice didn't he yes
15:14
like little bits of sawdust or something
15:16
yeah and then that stopped it from
15:17
melting it did and
15:19
is it right this is probably a myth but
15:21
did he go and see churchill again
15:23
and churchill was in the bath is that
15:25
true he didn't but yeah it was called
15:27
pie crete
15:28
named after him and yeah he convinced
15:30
lord mountbatten that it was a good idea
15:32
and mountbatten really liked it so he
15:34
said i'll go and talk to churchill
15:36
and mountbatten used to tell this story
15:38
after dinner after dinner parties he
15:39
said he went to checkers
15:41
to show churchill this special pike
15:42
creek that was so good at um
15:44
floating and he was told that churchill
15:46
was in the bath so he'd have to wait and
15:48
mountbatten said
15:49
good that's exactly where i want him to
15:50
be and he marched straight up into his
15:53
bathroom uh pushed the door open and
15:54
said hey
15:55
churchill i do mind if i put this bit of
15:57
thing in the bath with you
15:58
and show you how effective it will be as
16:00
an aircraft carrier and that's what he
16:01
did
16:02
and that was the last ever ridiculous
16:03
plan to come out of checkers wasn't it
16:08
very nice
16:09
[Applause]
16:10
[Music]
16:12
okay it is time for fact number two and
16:15
that
16:15
is james okay my fact this week is that
16:18
alexander graham bell
16:20
taught his dog to say how are you
16:22
grandmama
16:24
no
16:28
i'm going out on a limb and saying no he
16:30
didn't
16:33
he's so dead he's so absolutely dead
16:36
kind of
16:38
if anyone could record the evidence he
16:40
could so
16:42
where is it well this was before all of
16:44
the um telephone stuff that he did it
16:46
was when he was quite young so when he
16:48
was really young
16:49
his father devised a system of
16:50
transcribing words by just
16:52
the shape that you make of your mouth so
16:54
he would say if you make your mouth like
16:55
this like this like this
16:56
it will make these kind of sounds if you
16:59
make someone's face go wider it goes
17:01
more of an e
17:01
sound if you make it go narrow it's more
17:03
of an ooh sound
17:04
and so once he kind of learned this when
17:07
he got a bit older he decided to try it
17:08
on his dog
17:10
and so first of all he organized so that
17:12
the dog would growl on command by giving
17:15
him treats and things like that
17:16
and then as the dog would growl he would
17:19
kind of move his face
17:20
and he managed to get the dog to say
17:22
mama
17:23
so you make the lips go down like that
17:27
then he going to say
17:31
and when you put it all together it
17:32
sounded a bit like
17:36
and this was his party trick and he did
17:38
it all the time and
17:40
what a patient dog
17:41
[Laughter]
17:44
well the thing is that he then tried to
17:47
get the dog to do it without any kind of
17:49
movements of the lips just
17:50
see if he could do it by himself right
17:52
uh and he said that
17:53
even though he took kind of an interest
17:55
in the experiments he was never able
17:57
alone to do anything but growl
18:02
i wonder how he expressed taking an
18:03
interest in the experiments
18:06
i have another fact about alexander
18:08
graham bella's a boy okay so he was born
18:10
alexander bell okay he didn't have a
18:12
middle name until he was 10 years old
18:14
and then he got jealous of his brothers
18:16
who did have middle names
18:17
and he asked his father can i have a
18:19
middle name and his father said yes
18:21
which one would he like he said graham
18:23
and that was his 11th birthday present
18:26
wow there's a middle name i did that i
18:30
when i was 12 i asked for a new middle
18:32
name
18:33
um because i didn't really have one
18:35
properly
18:36
so my name is daniel craig schreiber and
18:38
my but everyone else in my family
18:40
including my sister has craig as her
18:41
middle name
18:42
and we moved to australia from hong kong
18:44
and i said when i go to school i want to
18:46
have a new middle name
18:47
and no one will know that it was never
18:48
there before and they said yes and i did
18:51
it
18:51
um what was it so full name daniel
18:55
indiana craig shriver
18:59
and i've i swear to god that's true it
19:02
was on my opening school reports daniel
19:04
indiana craig schreiber
19:05
and then um someone pointed out that
19:08
that was really uncool
19:09
and also it spells out dicks
19:11
[Laughter]
19:16
[Applause]
19:20
[Music]
19:22
no wonder they called me that
19:26
there are many reasons also as a kid he
19:29
used to help his
19:30
dad so he came from a long line of
19:32
people who experimented
19:34
with middle names middle names yeah
19:37
with sound and with how we speak and
19:38
with speech and so
19:40
his father invented kind of a system of
19:43
notating the different sounds that
19:44
humans can make and writing it on a
19:46
board
19:46
and he said that you could make any
19:48
sound in any language
19:50
and he could write the notation for it
19:51
and this could be a universal language
19:53
and he used to deploy his son to help
19:55
him so he'd be giving a lecture
19:57
to a big uh lecture theater of people
20:00
and he'd say someone in the audience
20:01
preferably someone who's from a
20:02
different country you know a russian
20:04
person
20:04
why don't you give me one of your words
20:06
in russian and this russian person would
20:08
give him the word and then alexander's
20:10
dad would write on the board
20:12
his special notation for that word and
20:14
then he'd call his little 10 year old
20:15
son in
20:16
who'd trot in and look at the board and
20:17
he'd be able to make that sound and it
20:20
was like a weird kind of
20:21
magic trick um so he he did do a lot of
20:24
work
20:25
uh with the death he's kind of i think
20:26
he's kind of a controversial figure
20:28
because he
20:28
um he argued for eugenics and he was
20:31
president of the second international
20:33
eugenics
20:34
uh congress um but he also came from so
20:37
his mother was deaf his fiance was deaf
20:38
and he taught uh
20:40
deaf children a lot he almost missed the
20:42
big debut of the telephone because he
20:44
wanted to teach a class of deaf children
20:46
oh really
20:46
yeah so he was kind of he had a very
20:48
sort of very mixed opinion so i can't
20:50
quite
20:50
understand yeah yeah yeah also he's
20:52
controversial just because i think as is
20:54
semi well accepted now he didn't invent
20:56
the telephone
20:57
and so that's i know i hate to break it
21:00
to you well this is all bollocks then my
21:02
notes
21:04
yeah you're thinking of a different guy
21:05
no the u.s house of representatives
21:07
actually voted on this in 2002 which i
21:09
didn't realize so
21:10
actually it turns out sort of two other
21:12
people invented it before him so
21:14
meuchi was an italian who invented the
21:16
telephone but then he couldn't afford to
21:18
keep wow
21:18
he's in tonight
21:22
big fan there um but yeah the house of
21:25
representatives in the u.s
21:26
voted on whether or not he invented the
21:28
telephone and they voted
21:30
for the fact that bell actually didn't
21:31
invent it it was meucci
21:33
and then literally 10 days later canada
21:35
voted and unanimously said bell did
21:37
invent it
21:38
and that is the cause of all tensions
21:40
between those countries
21:42
bell did have the patent in america
21:44
didn't he yes because we usually
21:46
couldn't afford to
21:47
keep up the patent but yes he did
21:50
he tried to sell the patent to western
21:52
union for a hundred thousand dollars
21:54
and um his um thinking behind that was
21:57
that one day there will be a telephone
21:58
in every american city
22:01
cool and western union um rejected the
22:04
idea as idiotic
22:08
i like as well though he he obviously he
22:10
may not have invented it but he
22:12
definitely knew that
22:12
the technology he understood how it
22:14
worked and he built his own versions
22:16
and there are stories of him where if he
22:18
was passing someone using the telephone
22:19
and it wasn't working he would just go
22:21
up to them take the phone off them
22:23
and fix it for them so there's a there's
22:25
a case of a town that he retired to
22:27
called bad
22:27
uh baddick and when he was living there
22:29
he passed someone who couldn't make it
22:30
work
22:31
he unscrewed a bit of the phone and
22:32
there was a fly trapped on the inside
22:34
that was just you know but somehow it
22:37
was messing it up took the fly out put
22:38
the phone back on and the guy went wow
22:40
how do you
22:40
how did you know that he went i invented
22:42
this
22:44
i guess that's why he did it just for
22:45
the punch line but yeah and imagine
22:47
imagine
22:48
steve jobs walking up to you and fixing
22:49
your mac it would be amazing
22:51
yeah and extremely impressive now yeah
22:56
so bell didn't have a phone in his study
22:59
towards the end of his life and he was
23:00
retired yeah he he
23:01
completely changed course he invented a
23:03
lot of other things as well
23:04
but uh i think we've briefly mentioned
23:06
this on qi he did want people to answer
23:08
the phone
23:09
ahoy hoy and he campaigned and he said
23:11
ahoy when he answered the phone until
23:12
the end of his life
23:13
so mr burns is the only one doing it
23:15
correctly
23:18
but the other thing is what uh advice
23:20
was on ending a call so
23:22
the first ever phone book it wasn't
23:23
really a book actually because there
23:24
were only 50 numbers in it because
23:26
almost no one had a phone
23:27
um but it said that users should begin
23:30
chats with
23:31
a firm and cheery hollower and
23:34
the advice for ending a call is to end
23:36
the call by saying
23:38
firmly that is all
23:40
[Laughter]
23:43
and i'm very nice i'm gonna start doing
23:45
it
23:48
okay love you love you that is all
23:54
he did some weird experiments before the
23:57
whole
23:58
phone stealing the phone idea um so he
24:00
wants stolen ear off a corpse and this
24:02
is actually one of the most important
24:03
things he did
24:04
he stole an ear off a corpse
24:07
well he actually got his mate to do i
24:08
think still an era for cadaver and it
24:10
was to create a phonograph um so he then
24:13
linked this ear up to a stylus like a
24:15
recording stylist
24:16
and then he got it to inscribe lines in
24:18
a glass plate and he'd shout into this
24:20
dead person's ear
24:22
uh whoever that person was and the
24:24
stylist would sort of write what he was
24:26
shouting or you know
24:27
right um the vibrations the waveforms
24:29
that he was shouting because it was
24:30
using the
24:31
bones of the ear to do that and this was
24:33
the thing he had in his house that he
24:34
kept this dead guys in
24:36
wow did it work yeah it worked yeah did
24:39
it
24:39
i mean the dead guy couldn't hear
24:41
anything it wasn't like
24:43
what's it like on the other side
24:47
oh we've got to get the mouth back
24:51
trip number two to the morgue
24:55
um we're gonna have to move on shortly
24:56
to our next fact oh some things on
24:58
clever dogs
25:01
so there's amazing book by john
25:03
bunderson uh all about like
25:04
really clever dogs uh and he says that
25:07
in the 1920s germany had a load of
25:09
animal psychologists who thought that
25:11
dogs were nearly as intelligent as
25:13
humans
25:14
and hitler believed this hitler believed
25:16
it and that he had these kind of schools
25:18
where the dogs could go in and
25:19
hopefully learn how to speak and
25:21
communicate
25:23
i mean he was hitler so he wasn't
25:26
entirely saying we know that much but he
25:28
thought that they'd be able to
25:29
communicate with their masters and
25:30
become more effective soldiers
25:32
it was claimed and i don't believe any
25:34
of these things i do believe the grammar
25:36
my thing but i don't think any of these
25:37
are true but it was claimed that they
25:38
could write poetry
25:42
um one apparently could reply mein
25:45
fuhrer when asked who hitler was
25:49
and another one mastered the alphabet
25:51
using a different number of barks for
25:53
each letter
25:54
and announced that he would be voting
25:56
for hindenburg in the next election
25:59
here's another weird thing um there's a
26:01
place in um called port lim
26:03
um which is near folkston and they have
26:06
this beautiful
26:06
zoo and none of the baboons were
26:08
responding to what they were saying
26:10
every time they spoke to them they just
26:11
were like
26:12
it's not following that command and it
26:14
turns out it's because these baboons
26:15
were from france
26:16
so the port lim zoo people had to learn
26:19
french
26:20
in order to speak to the baboons with
26:22
the commands that they were used to in
26:24
the previous zoo
26:25
i think that's lazy if they're going to
26:26
come here they can bloody well learn our
26:28
land
26:33
wow well that answers one question i've
26:36
always wanted to know the answer to
26:41
okay it is time for
26:45
fact number three and that is andy
26:48
my fact is that to stop being eaten by
26:51
predators
26:52
some crustaceans wear disgusting tasting
26:54
snails
26:55
as backpacks uh this is in the southern
27:00
ocean around antarctica
27:01
and there are these tiny little uh
27:03
crustacean-like creatures
27:05
they are called amphipods and these guys
27:07
are called hyperiola delatata
27:09
um i hope that's how it's pronounced if
27:11
you're one of these listening
27:14
wow and so scientists
27:17
found them and they found them over a
27:19
number of decades they've observed this
27:21
um
27:21
they've got these mollocks there are
27:22
these little creatures they're called
27:24
sea butterflies or sea angels sometimes
27:27
uh quite sweet little things and they're
27:28
clamped on their backs like a backpack
27:30
and they're being held in position the
27:32
um
27:33
the amphipod is spending two pairs of
27:35
legs just holding its backpack on
27:37
so it's a big expenditure of energy to
27:38
keep this thing on you and
27:40
uh it turns out that these little
27:42
mollusks are eating
27:44
uh chemicals or they have chemicals
27:46
inside them
27:47
which taste horrible to fish and so the
27:50
fish will approach
27:51
an anthropod and if it's got a snail
27:53
backpack on it will say
27:55
no i know that tastes disgusting i will
27:57
not eat it and they swim away yeah and
27:59
the amphipod survives
28:00
and it's so bad for the little snails
28:02
because usually when there's a
28:03
partnership like that
28:04
usually they both slightly benefit in
28:06
this case the snail's actually trapped
28:08
and um it starves while it's there
28:11
unfortunately and it starves to death
28:13
even
28:13
so yeah yeah it's not all fun and games
28:15
andy
28:16
[Laughter]
28:19
those those guys see angels they are
28:21
quite cute little animals aren't they
28:22
they get their name because their shape
28:24
resembles a snow angel
28:25
you know when you do that in the snow
28:27
that's really nice and when they find it
28:29
when two c angels find each other um
28:32
and they want to have little baby sea
28:33
angels um
28:35
they stab each other with suckers
28:38
to stick together leaving scars on their
28:41
bodies
28:42
so you can tell how many sexual partners
28:44
a sea angel is had by the number of
28:46
physical scars on their body
28:47
not just the mental scars that we lay
28:49
out
28:51
so [ __ ] shaming in their world is uh
28:54
probably rife i would imagine maybe
28:59
you can see how promiscuous someone is i
29:01
bet they have real
29:02
feminist issues with that um in the
29:04
crustacean
29:05
world um i think i don't know if we've
29:09
mentioned before that they're not the
29:10
only
29:11
undersea creatures to create backpacks
29:12
for themselves
29:14
so we um so sponge crabs
29:18
are called that because they wear
29:19
sponges they wear sea sponges
29:21
and it's for kind of a similar reason
29:23
it's for evading predators so they
29:25
actually wear them as hats but they look
29:26
so
29:27
cool um well sort of on their back and
29:30
shoulders
29:30
sort of hat [ __ ] rucksack and it's a
29:32
disguise
29:34
but also sponges release chemicals and
29:36
so it's often chemicals that
29:37
protect them from predators because they
29:39
taste gross or they poison them
29:41
and if you look them up they look so
29:43
weird because they often replace their
29:44
hats if they find
29:45
a better one so if there's like a more
29:48
colorful fun looking sponge
29:50
then they will take that back backpack
29:51
off and put it
29:54
they'll take it back they'll get a
29:55
refund they'll put the new sponge on
29:58
um yeah and it's mainly to find the best
29:59
fitting sponge so they need to find a
30:01
sponge that exactly
30:02
fits the shape of their back as you do
30:05
actually
30:06
they're so creative with their defense
30:08
mechanisms
30:09
um when you read about it i was reading
30:11
one uh this this one's pretty exciting
30:13
this is a crustacean called the
30:14
ostracod and the ostracod does this
30:17
thing where it doesn't use its defense
30:19
mechanism until it's actually
30:21
in the mouth of the predator uh that's
30:23
trying to kill it yeah
30:24
so wait for it i'm really not sure about
30:28
this
30:29
wait for it so what happens is
30:32
there's a cardinal fish which eats these
30:35
um these particular crustaceans the
30:36
ostracod
30:37
so they eat them and they're in the
30:39
mouth and they close they close up the
30:40
mouth
30:41
they realize that they've been eaten and
30:43
so what these little crustaceans do is
30:44
they
30:45
they shake up like crazy and they go by
30:47
a luminescent
30:49
now the um the cardinal fish is
30:52
transparent
30:53
so the one thing you don't want when
30:55
you're in the deep is to be spotted by
30:57
other predators by this huge
30:58
light so suddenly from inside their body
31:01
they're a glowing orb
31:03
and they immediately vomit up these
31:05
little crustaceans who then swim away
31:07
and the cuddle
31:07
the cardinal fish swims the hell out of
31:09
there because he doesn't want to be near
31:10
any of the other predators how amazing
31:12
is that
31:12
that's so amazing yeah it's suddenly
31:15
just
31:16
light bulbs lit up in them saying i'm
31:19
food
31:20
it would be so cool to see your food
31:22
after you've eaten it like inside you
31:24
my knife is then going to attract
31:26
something to make you food
31:28
if it killed you no no but no yeah it
31:30
would it would be cool aside from that
31:32
i so salmon eat crustaceans
31:35
yup um and it's because of that that
31:38
they are the color they are
31:39
so salmon wild salmon are pink and they
31:43
are lots of different shades of pink and
31:44
that's all about the crustaceans they
31:45
eat it's the same with flamingos so
31:47
uh some salmon will eat like lots and
31:50
lots of a certain type of
31:51
uh prawn let's say a bit of krill and
31:54
that will make them very pink so for
31:56
instance i think the
31:56
alaskan sockeye salmon is the reddest of
31:59
all that your coho salmon is a lighter
32:01
pink
32:02
because they eat slightly different
32:03
stuff but farmed salmon doesn't eat any
32:05
of this because they're just fed like
32:07
farmy pellets of apparently ground up
32:09
feathers
32:10
and soybeans and chicken fat and weird
32:12
stuff like that but
32:14
obviously people are used to seeing
32:15
salmon being pink so farm salmon that
32:17
you buy would normally be gray
32:19
but the farmers add pigment to their
32:22
food to make them the right color that
32:23
people expect them to be
32:25
and they have a thing called a salmon
32:27
fan which was invented by a
32:29
pharmaceutical company
32:31
and it's basically the um what's the
32:33
paint the jewel it's like the
32:34
dulux paint range but for salmon color
32:37
so if you're salmon farming
32:38
you go to the salmon fan and you pick
32:41
the exact shade of pink that you want
32:43
your salmon to be
32:44
and then they can send you the matching
32:45
food for it that's not good
32:48
it is amazing you think everyone would
32:49
just go for the same color wouldn't they
32:51
but it depends if you want if you want
32:53
to be selling you know your alaskan uh
32:56
expensive salmon or some cheaper more
32:58
mass-produced salmon
32:59
all right it's amazing but apparently if
33:00
salmon goes beyond a certain lightness
33:02
people just won't eat it at all
33:04
regardless of what type it is because
33:06
there it is
33:06
if any food that i expect to be a
33:08
different color is grey
33:11
i will sniff it at least
33:16
just on color and crustaceans um do you
33:18
know that the mantis shrimp
33:20
oh yeah do you know how many colors a
33:21
manta shrimp can see
33:24
oh so how many do you reckon we can see
33:26
oh
33:27
um lots 10 000 10
33:30
000 okay the mantis shrimp i mean no
33:33
that was just a complete guess
33:34
yeah i'd like to say uh more than that
33:37
i'll say
33:38
11 000. okay anna do you want to get in
33:41
on this
33:42
i couldn't name all of them by the way i
33:44
just i don't want to be put on the spot
33:45
later
33:46
richard of york gave battle in vain
33:47
seven in the rainbow i think it's seven
33:50
okay seven ten thousand eleven thousand
33:52
um
33:53
so the mantis shrimp is able to perceive
33:56
a hundred
33:56
septillion different types of color
33:59
that's
33:59
ten to the power of twenty-six wow and
34:02
it can name
34:03
every single one imagine
34:07
[Laughter]
34:12
pretty crazy though that's more than us
34:14
then how many can did you you didn't say
34:16
how many we can see
34:21
you know that fact means nothing to us
34:26
that's very cool there's um there's a
34:29
kind of uh pteropod which is the same as
34:31
this little animal called a file fish
34:33
and they eat coral and live in coral and
34:35
they get the smell of the coral from the
34:37
coral
34:38
and it stops their predators from being
34:40
able to find them because they smell
34:41
like their house
34:45
it's like if you um like if you ate
34:47
nothing but onions
34:48
and you lived in a bag of onions
34:52
i would i would question the life
34:53
choices that have brought me to this
34:54
point
34:56
also also are you going the onions
34:58
haven't noticed me yet
35:01
who's spotting you there no it's the
35:02
people who want to eat you it's not that
35:04
the coral wants to eat them
35:05
i don't think but if you went to france
35:07
it would be a disaster yes
35:09
they'd love to eat you i found the most
35:12
bizarre thing about
35:13
crustaceans a certain type of crustacean
35:15
which is a crab
35:16
i found out a thing about crabs um
35:21
i found out that so sartre jean-paul
35:23
sartre
35:24
i'm sure you've all read his um complete
35:27
works
35:28
he took mescaline in 1929 so mescaline
35:31
like a
35:31
hallucinogenic drug and he was
35:34
as a result of that followed around by a
35:36
team of crabs
35:37
for years okay the french have very
35:41
strict rules about masculine don't they
35:46
which they set to observing yeah they do
35:49
so are you saying which i think you are
35:50
that he thought he was being followed by
35:52
perhaps
35:53
he said he gave an interview i can't
35:56
remember who he
35:56
first gave the interview to but he said
35:57
he took masculine and he suddenly
35:59
realized that there were just crabs
36:00
all around him and then the interviewer
36:02
said what loads of them he said yeah
36:04
well like four or five so he just has
36:06
four or five crabs and they followed him
36:08
everywhere and he would say when he was
36:10
writing sometimes he'd be able to get
36:11
rid of them but
36:12
as soon as he got up to go anywhere
36:13
they'd follow him so he would go to
36:16
university he would give lectures get up
36:19
in the morning and he'd walk and they'd
36:20
walk with him
36:21
and this was for years and he said he
36:24
said how many seats would you like for
36:26
the film sir
36:26
six
36:26
[Laughter]
36:30
no they could sit on each other's laps i
36:32
think
36:34
but yeah you started talking to them he
36:35
said he got really used to them he would
36:37
wake up every morning and say
36:38
good morning my little ones how did you
36:40
sleep
36:42
and did they talk back yeah they chatted
36:46
away
36:46
but then when he went to class he knew
36:48
that it had to be quiet so he said he
36:50
used to tell him to be quiet in lectures
36:52
so you can work and they would be but
36:55
the lecture ended and then they start
36:57
chatting away again wow
36:58
and yep happened for years he had some
37:01
therapy in the end
37:05
they went away okay it is time for our
37:08
final fact of the show and that is my
37:10
fact my fact this week is that
37:13
there is a rock band made up entirely of
37:15
nasa astronauts
37:17
called max q the band has a constantly
37:20
rotating lineup as they can't be sure
37:22
that all members will be on earth at the
37:24
same time
37:27
there's just so many of them and it does
37:29
extend beyond uh
37:30
going up into space sometimes they're in
37:32
training to go into space sometimes
37:34
they're retired sometimes um just
37:37
they're doing other
37:38
they're busy and but yeah so this is uh
37:41
this is a fact that i stumbled on
37:43
um in fact it was while we were
37:44
researching the book this year um
37:46
because we have a fact about one of its
37:48
members one of max q's members and it's
37:50
andrew feustel
37:52
and he was the captain of the
37:53
international space station this year
37:55
and um he's in the band and um the fact
37:58
about him that's in the book is that
38:00
nasa sent him up to space despite the
38:02
fact that he has a fear of heights
38:04
so he and but he admitted that it's fine
38:07
once he gets to space the fear of hides
38:10
it's it's the way up and
38:11
even ladders he's just like whoa when
38:13
you say nasa sent him up despite the
38:15
fact it sounds like they sort of forced
38:16
him to go up he was like no
38:18
please really i just want to be in the
38:19
lab just keep going up the ladder it'll
38:21
be fine eventually
38:24
i said that's so weird because if if i
38:26
you know i don't really like spiders but
38:28
if you presented me with a spider the
38:30
size of a house i would like it even
38:31
less
38:32
i wouldn't make my piece with it right
38:35
but if you're in space it would look so
38:37
tiny you wouldn't even see it and then
38:38
that's
38:39
that's not the same logic no i've you've
38:42
brought havoc on a bad analogy to start
38:44
with uh
38:46
so people play music in space sometimes
38:48
these guys are mostly on earth aren't
38:49
like these guys are on earth yeah yeah
38:51
this is yeah they're
38:52
earthband but people do play music in
38:54
space uh chris hadfield famously did it
38:57
um there was an astronaut called ellen
38:59
ochoa who plays the flute in space
39:01
but she has to keep her feet in the foot
39:03
loops because even the tiny amount of
39:05
blowing on the flute will
39:07
move her around yeah that is amazing
39:10
isn't it
39:10
what a great way to sort of exit a
39:12
conversation just
39:15
wouldn't that be awesome i fluted my way
39:18
out of that man
39:24
you know that's not what a flu looks
39:25
like what's
39:34
worst getaway ever do you know they've
39:37
had um
39:37
bagpipes on the international space
39:39
station so they've got all the
39:41
instruments that have been there
39:42
i cannot think of something you're in a
39:44
very confined space
39:46
oh i cannot imagine that being good for
39:48
everyone's mental health
39:50
yeah do you want to hear something even
39:51
worse ages ago instead of you know an
39:54
instrument being played in order to get
39:56
the astronauts to calm down they would
39:57
play
39:58
in the international space station just
39:59
to calm them you know elevator music
40:03
that used to just be played yeah can you
40:06
imagine being stuck
40:07
in an elevator that's what it would have
40:08
been they still they still play the
40:10
music sometimes
40:11
so the music that wakes them up in the
40:12
morning is um
40:14
is picked by the capsule communicator
40:17
also known as the capcom who is an
40:18
astronaut
40:19
who's on the ground so they don't have
40:21
responsibility for the music that they
40:23
pick
40:24
to wake people up surely i think they do
40:26
pick things they like
40:28
yeah and they do they ask you know if
40:30
it's gonna be a paul mccartney song they
40:31
might ask paul mccartney to record a
40:33
you know hello wake up you're in space
40:35
and then they wake up and
40:39
that was good but and um yeah and uh it
40:42
would be songs sometimes relevant to
40:44
certain missions so
40:45
um when chris hadfield had to do his
40:47
first space walk he was the first
40:48
canadian i believe to do that
40:50
his wife was able to pick that morning's
40:52
song and she picked a song that
40:53
was dear to him and the lyrics suggested
40:55
going out into the frontiers and
40:57
so it's it's quite a cool tradition
40:59
voice still actually started another
41:00
band while he was in space so max q he
41:03
had on earth
41:04
and up in space he had astro hawaii that
41:06
was the name of the band
41:08
and it had five of the iss and
41:10
astronauts as well as cosmonauts
41:12
and so the instruments included two
41:13
guitars two flutes
41:15
which i now know what that is
41:18
and uh and an improvised drum which was
41:21
played
41:21
using the metallic unit that usually
41:23
stores russian cosmonauts feces
41:26
so that was their nice that was their
41:27
drama they've had so many
41:29
out in space they're all kind of music
41:30
lovers aren't they yeah even from like
41:32
really early flight so in 1965
41:35
was a classic you know back before nasa
41:37
started clamping down on smuggling stuff
41:39
into space
41:40
everyone just took loads of [ __ ] up
41:41
there and um
41:43
walter shearer jr and thomas stafford
41:46
snuck bells and a harmonica up there and
41:48
they'd practice what they were going to
41:49
do before so they'd met together for
41:50
secret rehearsals
41:52
and they thought we'll prank ground
41:54
control on the way down
41:55
and tell them that we can hear something
41:56
weird and then crack into song and they
42:02
did it
42:03
and i just i just never know where
42:04
they're hiding these things
42:06
where surely you can hide a harmonica
42:08
very easily
42:10
no you couldn't is it where i think like
42:13
every time you farted they'd notice
42:21
yeah it is a big part of their culture
42:23
apparently to the point where
42:25
there's an inside uh thing that is said
42:27
that whenever astronauts are being
42:29
interviewed potential astronauts are
42:30
being interviewed by nasa
42:31
one of the questions that comes up is do
42:33
you play a musical instrument
42:34
it's it's that much of a killing a thing
42:37
does it affect your chances of getting
42:38
in
42:39
yeah no no no no no i bet it does it was
42:43
like yes the organ and i'd love one up
42:45
there
42:47
we'll give you a call yeah and anything
42:48
opens up it's not like buzz
42:50
buzz we would have let you go on first
42:52
but neil plays the banjo and
42:54
he's just more qualified to step out
42:56
first but they
42:58
um it's it's quite a nice story about
42:59
how max q came about to begin with
43:01
because
43:02
um the band was set up after the
43:04
disaster of the challenger when the
43:06
challenger rocket exploded on the way to
43:07
space
43:08
and actually there was a um an astronaut
43:11
on board who was going to be the first
43:13
person to record music up in space
43:15
for an album so he was on board the
43:17
challenger and he had his saxophone with
43:19
him and that obviously exploded so
43:20
unfortunately uh that never happened
43:22
and so what they ended up deciding to do
43:24
was why don't they throw a big
43:26
fun day to get morale up and throw a big
43:28
party and they'll have acts come on
43:29
stage and they'll do stuff and max q was
43:31
formed
43:32
in that moment i was looking at what
43:34
some other things that astronauts do to
43:35
relax yep
43:36
so here's one thing that they do they
43:38
play scrabble
43:40
but they must be like travel scrabble
43:43
right well they're in a microgravity
43:44
environment so they have velcroed
43:46
onto the back of every single piece a
43:48
tiny pet they've stuck a tiny patch of
43:50
velcro on
43:51
and the board is attached to the ceiling
43:52
in the dining room
43:54
so you can just look up while you eat
43:55
and ponder your next move with um
43:57
the microgravity thing i was reading an
43:59
interview with samantha christopheretti
44:01
who broke the record for the longest
44:03
time a woman has spent in space a few
44:05
years ago it was 200 days
44:07
and she was talking about when you come
44:08
back after being in a
44:10
zero gravity environment and how it
44:13
feels
44:14
and she did say i i step out of the you
44:17
know the module and it feels like
44:18
there's some kind of evil giant trying
44:20
to press me into the ground and for
44:22
weeks and weeks you're like that and i
44:23
think it took her a couple of years to
44:25
get back to normal
44:26
and she said walking is like lifting
44:27
tree trunks but
44:29
also you have trouble speaking because
44:31
your tongue
44:32
is so used to being weightless that
44:34
lifting it up
44:36
off the bottom of your mouth is too much
44:37
effort so you're just like
44:43
there's a lot yeah there's a lot of
44:44
things they have to re-accustom to when
44:46
they come back down so
44:47
a lot of uh astronauts who return are
44:49
known to
44:50
just drop their cup of tea in mid-air
44:53
and just have it yeah just have it smash
44:55
everywhere you've become a real [ __ ]
44:57
in space
44:57
[Laughter]
45:02
you mentioned the uh moon astronauts
45:04
apollo 11 astronauts
45:06
when they got back i didn't realize they
45:07
filled in a customs declaration form
45:09
yes yeah it's and it's so great when you
45:12
look at it
45:13
uh it's basically it's a customs
45:15
declaration that lists the origin
45:16
and the destination so the origin is
45:18
cape kennedy the destination was
45:20
honolulu which they actually missed by a
45:21
few hundred miles but
45:23
not important um and then it has to list
45:25
a stop off
45:26
so it says stop off moon and
45:30
it's just so great on this like normal
45:32
little bit of paper
45:33
honolulu moon and then it says anything
45:36
to declare
45:37
you know you've got to declare anything
45:38
you're carrying and they've just had to
45:40
write moon rock and moon dust samples
45:42
and these crabs that we found up there
45:48
i'm sorry was was that a harmonica i
45:51
just heard
45:58
i find this amazing about when you're in
46:00
the iss um so you're always kind of
46:02
you're weightless and you're always
46:03
pushing yourself off things
46:05
but one of the rooms is so big that
46:07
sometimes you can get stuck in the
46:08
middle of the room
46:12
oh my god you've got nothing to push
46:15
oh you're just like basically you're
46:16
either waiting for someone to
46:18
get you or you kind of i guess you could
46:20
blow your emergency flute on you at all
46:23
[Laughter]
46:27
so what you're saying about playing the
46:29
flute and the having to grip your feet
46:31
under the
46:31
one of the harder instruments to play is
46:33
the keyboard because every time
46:35
you press one of the keys you push the
46:37
instrument away from you so
46:39
often when they're playing it they're if
46:40
they haven't got a proper grip they just
46:42
have to chase the keyboard
46:44
as they're as they're playing their song
46:46
another thing they do to kind of wind
46:48
down that they do a lot of this exercise
46:50
because you need to keep your muscles uh
46:52
okay because otherwise the latrophy
46:54
uh sorry um but the problem is if you're
46:57
doing your exercise and you're sweating
46:59
the sweat
47:00
hangs around your body because it's got
47:02
nowhere to go
47:03
there's no gravity pulling it down and
47:04
you can end up with a big blob of sweat
47:06
around there
47:07
and if you move your head really quickly
47:09
the sweat blob
47:10
just slowly moves in space
47:13
and then it can smash your friend in the
47:15
face a big
47:17
like a water balloon of sweat wow
47:20
that's awesome
47:25
um we're gonna have to wrap up shortly
47:27
okay some stuff
47:28
on uh bands and concerts yeah stuff like
47:30
that in unusual places or
47:33
um the institute marquez um had a
47:36
concert quite recently uh featuring
47:38
alex ubago and sharon carr from the
47:41
cause
47:42
and they had the youngest ever audience
47:44
because it was a live concert for
47:46
embryos
47:48
what yeah apparently apparently it helps
47:51
the development of the embryos if
47:53
they're getting lots of music according
47:54
to sharon core from the course
47:57
and who am i to doubt sharon call from
47:59
the cause
48:02
how do they applaud
48:03
[Laughter]
48:05
wait are they are they are they in wombs
48:08
uh no they are
48:09
they're not they're in the lab they're
48:11
okay it's
48:12
in vitro stuff okay cool that's a
48:16
that is a that's a weird gig
48:20
it had to be weird i'm saying it on the
48:22
podcast i'm not going to say
48:23
hey the cars once did a gig of dublin
48:25
[Laughter]
48:27
to a load of normal humans that's no
48:31
you're right though it's sort of like
48:32
how's so
48:32
since the cause broke up how's your solo
48:34
career going
48:36
actually some exciting gigs coming up
48:39
playing to unborn embryos
48:42
actually that is exciting when you think
48:43
about it
48:45
um i did find one space band thing so
48:48
this was in 2010 it was a london synth
48:50
pop band called monarchy
48:52
and they announced that they were going
48:53
to play their debut gig their debut gig
48:55
in cape canaveral and beam it into space
48:58
and
48:59
um the guardian reported on it they said
49:01
all that all that really means is
49:03
sending a signal out of the atmosphere
49:04
without it being bounced back by a
49:06
satellite so because they weren't
49:07
allowed into
49:08
you know the actual nasa site so the
49:10
guardian reported that
49:11
it was not interstellar communication it
49:14
was simply a gig
49:14
broadcast to no one
49:18
not long after monarchy were dropped by
49:21
mercury records
49:22
before their album had been released
49:25
can i just say my a fact that i really
49:29
like and it's about
49:30
you know people unexpected people being
49:31
in bands okay
49:33
so people you don't expect to be in
49:34
bands and i know it's a favorite fact of
49:35
someone in the audience who's our
49:36
colleague
49:37
uh james other james we call him which
49:40
is good for his ego
49:42
um but james ross
49:46
macaulay culkin uh plays in a band
49:49
played in a band
49:50
and it's called the pizza underground
49:52
and what they do is they do covers of
49:54
velvet underground
49:55
but instead of the velvet underground
49:56
lyrics they're all about pizza
49:59
and i was reading about
50:02
the inspiration for it and the glock
50:04
player in the band
50:06
explained that um actually oh yeah yeah
50:08
yeah every band has a glock
50:10
isn't it's a very very very dangerous
50:14
gig
50:16
to attend the glock player in the band
50:18
she explained that
50:20
actually all of velva underground songs
50:22
were originally written about pizza but
50:24
they had to be reworded to accommodate
50:26
the standards of their day and so
50:29
macaulay culkin is there writing that
50:30
wrong
50:31
that is amazing these um nasa people
50:34
they need
50:34
all of their people to be on earth
50:36
otherwise they can't do a gig so i
50:38
thought i'd look at a few
50:39
reasons that people couldn't do gigs oh
50:40
yeah neil young once had to
50:42
cancel a an entire tour after cutting
50:45
his finger while making a ham
50:46
sandwich and the kings of leon abandoned
50:50
a show
50:50
halfway through in july 2010 after
50:53
pigeons began
50:54
[ __ ] in jared's mouth
50:56
[Laughter]
51:02

[Applause]
01:18
hello and welcome to another episode of
01:20
no such thing as a fish
01:21
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
01:23
qi offices in covent garden
01:26
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
01:27
here with anna chazinski
01:29
andrew hunter murray james harkin and a
01:32
special guest
01:32
and the man who gave us the name the qy
01:35
elves it's stephen fry
01:36
and once again we have gathered round
01:38
the microphones with our four favorite
01:40
facts from the last seven days
01:41
and in no particular order here we go
01:44
starting with you
01:45
steven all right yes i have a fact here
01:47
there was a make of toilet paper in
01:49
victorian england
01:50
that was so posh every sheet had a
01:52
watermark to deter
01:54
counterfeiters and actually so she
01:56
wouldn't have been called toilet paper
01:57
it would have been called lavatory paper
01:59
if you remember toilet is deeply
02:00
non-view as is the word posh so in fact
02:03
it was probably
02:04
the make of lavatory paper that was so
02:06
classy
02:08
but anyway that's the point and what
02:09
does that tell us about the victorians
02:11
in their
02:12
bathroom habits i wonder the
02:13
revolutionary customs well this was on
02:15
the first toilet papers or lavatory
02:17
papers wasn't it
02:18
yeah what was used before that then we
02:21
know all the stories of
02:22
you know swans necks and goose necks
02:24
yeah yeah corn cobs i think
02:26
we've mentioned before yeah i just
02:27
wonder what so for example this is in
02:29
the
02:29
19th century so this was well after
02:33
for example jane austen died so what are
02:34
the regency
02:36
gentry or just the middle classes i mean
02:38
i can't imagine jane austen using a corn
02:40
cob is all i'm
02:42
trying to say
02:45
lace i know the french used lace no
02:47
which is weird because it's got holes in
02:49
it but apparently they did
02:50
i know that in many middle eastern
02:52
customers the hand was always used and
02:54
that's why you don't
02:55
use the cac hand literally the hand
02:57
if i may say so
02:59
yeah um and it's interesting i don't
03:03
know
03:03
many people have watched peter jackson's
03:05
reconstruction of you know
03:06
recolorization of some of that
03:07
extraordinary imperial war museum
03:09
first world war footage and they may
03:10
remember seeing those men perched on a
03:13
bar
03:13
having a poo with their bottoms sort of
03:15
hanging over yes it's a reminded one
03:17
obviously of the
03:18
the very everyday nature of war includes
03:20
naturally the very everyday nature of
03:22
emptying the bowels and uh there i think
03:25
one of the comments
03:26
was from a from a veteran speaking uh
03:29
that there was no paper
03:30
so so our grandfathers and great
03:33
grandfathers who fought in that war and
03:34
survived would have all had that same
03:36
experience
03:37
and uh we don't talk about it was the
03:38
wipers times was that
03:40
that's a good point yeah that wasn't
03:42
designed it wasn't
03:43
nice it was just a classic tommy miss
03:45
pronunciation
03:47
oh it's not did you think that i thought
03:49
you would read it and then wipe it up
03:54
but a very happy one yeah um so there is
03:56
a first world war toilet paper fact
03:57
which is that
03:58
both sides printed toilet paper with uh
04:01
propaganda on it
04:03
so the germans issued sheets with a
04:05
series of uh lying reports by our
04:07
enemies
04:08
and british manufacturers did the same
04:09
thing on the other side
04:12
no it's just for you to just for you to
04:14
wipe your bottom with british people
04:15
for a fact because you know how when we
04:17
were young and i don't suppose
04:18
cartoonists still do it but escaping
04:20
prisoners always used to have suits with
04:21
arrows on government property arrows
04:24
well when i
04:25
was a young and unfortunate uh criminal
04:27
convicted and inside a prison
04:29
and the laboratory paper there was in uh
04:31
in those sort of boxes with their rather
04:32
crispy leaves intertwined in interleaved
04:35
in fact
04:36
uh and they had the those arrows on uh
04:39
as did
04:40
the cigarette rolling papers that you
04:41
got from the shop they all had those
04:43
arrows prisons only plus the arrows yeah
04:46
wouldn't that tempt you to take some
04:48
when you left yeah yeah exactly i'm sure
04:50
you've done your bird yeah yeah
04:52
yeah in america they get like little
04:56
tattoos don't they to show what they've
04:57
done
04:58
yes if you just have a piece of arrow
05:00
toilet paper
05:02
well have we mentioned that they used to
05:04
um so before
05:06
toilet paper was invented they used to
05:07
wipe their bums on the farmers almanac
05:10
didn't they in america famously and the
05:12
sears catalogue
05:13
and they both used to come with a hole
05:15
in them so you could hang it up
05:16
and then use it as lure yeah and i was
05:19
actually
05:20
listening to a podcast which was saying
05:21
there are two reasons that suddenly lu
05:23
roll was necessary and
05:25
was taken on one was that we invented
05:27
plumbing so suddenly you can't flush a
05:29
corner on the cob down the loo
05:30
um and the other was the sears catalog
05:32
started coming laminated started coming
05:34
with glossy glossy paper oh right
05:36
it didn't work anymore it was absorbing
05:38
but not absorbent
05:41
an important distinction i find waitrose
05:43
food illustrated very uncomfortable
05:46
every month but this does um bring us to
05:49
a sensitive point about
05:51
the wiping bottoms most people never
05:53
taught how to wipe the bottom i assume
05:55
unless there's some
05:56
dim memory of a mother during potty
05:58
training actually explaining it
05:59
but there was a news story just the
06:01
other day about the fact that women are
06:02
being told how to wipe their bottoms and
06:04
some people on social media were very
06:05
angry
06:06
at being told but the the answer is and
06:08
um you know
06:09
this is all too distressing to hear turn
06:11
away but that um
06:13
forwards to back is the correct female
06:15
way it's
06:16
it's as a woman you just are told that
06:19
you chant it practically
06:21
because men come right and saying guys
06:23
we don't do that do we
06:25
i go the other way exactly you go back
06:26
to yeah
06:28
it doesn't matter obviously no exactly
06:29
we don't have the other the little
06:31
you'd have to really miss your target
06:38
it's important to be frank and open
06:40
about these absolutely
06:42
so it's a health issue for women
06:43
obviously you know i'm so glad you're
06:46
here
06:47
[Laughter]
06:51
but it's interesting we say bringing the
06:52
levels up and everything
06:54
to an alien species looking at us why
06:56
they would be very puzzled at
06:58
the fact that we had these very normal
07:00
and necessary actions that are part of
07:03
every day
07:04
like eating and drinking and having a po
07:07
and a pee
07:08
and indeed making love in order to uh
07:10
whatever coalition or whatever wants to
07:11
call it in order to
07:12
propagate the species and those are the
07:14
very things that have the taboos
07:16
whereas murder and cruelty we can use
07:19
those words we could say i was in the
07:21
traffic was active it was crawl oh god
07:23
it was murder
07:24
you think well hang on murder kills
07:25
people yeah that's the thing we should
07:27
have a taboo about
07:28
yeah whereas if you say it was
07:30
bad trafficking but do you swear
07:34
which frame of reference is the
07:35
dangerous one no not not the poem
07:37
yeah yeah so i'm sure to the you know
07:39
the very useful martian watching
07:42
that this should teach us something
07:43
about how completely screwed up we are
07:45
yeah it's so wrong to be obsessed well i
07:48
think
07:49
wasn't the the people who invented lou
07:51
role on a role for the first time in
07:52
fact invented it in the 1890s and 1890 i
07:55
think
07:56
and they didn't admit to it and they did
07:57
it under a shell company
07:59
they only admitted to it in 1902 because
08:01
it was such a shameful thing to have
08:03
invented
08:03
oh i remember i met someone who worked
08:05
for dalton um the
08:07
the porcelain company um in
08:09
staffordshire
08:10
and i asked a party and i said oh it was
08:13
picturing you did staffordshire dogs or
08:14
something to go mantle pieces you know
08:16
nice little
08:17
sort of ornamental things i said what
08:19
sort of things do you specialize and he
08:20
said rather coily
08:21
heavy wear and i didn't quite know what
08:24
heavyweight was and i sort of worked
08:26
out what he meant was bathrooms and
08:27
lavatories heavy well
08:29
nice the proper porcelain oh really
08:32
just just speaking of the late 1800s and
08:35
which way to wipe
08:36
um i saw the patent for the first toilet
08:38
roll
08:39
um and it sort of answers the question
08:42
of which way are you meant to hang the
08:43
roll does the paper come down underneath
08:45
or does it go
08:46
over so which do you think it is well i
08:48
was thought forward so you can grab it
08:50
and that's the way hotels do it because
08:51
they do a little koi provocative peak
08:55
paper yes new unused yes um yeah that's
08:58
correct
08:58
it's it's that way in the pace yeah it's
09:00
not a great quiz question but i don't
09:02
know
09:02
yeah but the thing about the little peak
09:04
is supposed to be having worked in a
09:05
hotel
09:06
um it's so that the um housekeepers can
09:09
tell if the room has been serviced so
09:10
it's the last thing they do
09:12
and so if that's done it means they know
09:13
that it's fine so if i was a housekeeper
09:16
i'd just do that
09:17
very quickly yeah yeah exactly what so
09:20
if they got in and they saw that they
09:22
were
09:22
sort of swan towel positioned in little
09:25
mints
09:25
well that could have just been the
09:26
person staying here let me check the
09:29
bathroom
09:30
so there was a sorry no i'm just
09:31
thinking so yes the first company to
09:33
make lure
09:34
disclaimed it or hid it i wonder when it
09:37
was first advertised then when it was
09:38
first allowed into magazines and then
09:40
into television
09:42
we're all familiar with andrex and this
09:43
puppy and everything and i'm old enough
09:45
to remember the
09:46
hullabaloo when it was allowed to have
09:49
female
09:50
sanitary products as they call them uh
09:52
advertised on tv and everyone said that
09:54
was the beginning of the end that's
09:55
disgusting i don't want to see that
09:56
um but presumably there may have been a
09:58
similar moment when leveraging paperwork
10:00
well but bizarrely you never you still
10:02
never see lou paper or sanitary pads
10:04
with the thing on them that they're
10:05
supposed to
10:06
clear up i mean i wonder if men think
10:08
that we have blue periods
10:10
because the only thing you see is a drop
10:12
of blue picasso has a blue period
10:15
there is one that says for your bums
10:16
isn't there there was one that has it
10:18
but yes i i i thought i remember my
10:20
friend you and i we wanted to do women
10:22
in when we were heavy voice-over
10:24
performers in the 80s and doing all
10:26
kinds of adverts and
10:28
things we thought why don't they do that
10:29
be brilliant wipes your bottom
10:31
beautifully
10:32
that's all you need it just wipes your
10:34
bottle brilliantly
10:35
so this company is scots who did this
10:37
yeah and they couldn't advertise i know
10:39
that much at least
10:40
and they sold it under the counter in
10:42
the chemists so you'd have to go in and
10:44
they would just kind of they wouldn't
10:45
even put it on the shelf
10:46
technically actually it should have been
10:47
placed over the counter according to the
10:49
patent
10:49
yeah and the outside loop would be a
10:52
string with
10:53
with newspaper in there you see the
10:54
holes in the sears cover yeah
10:56
yeah i found a man this is a two years
10:59
ago this is in 2016. it was a man
11:01
who was fined in court after paying for
11:03
a takeaway
11:04
with a 10 pound note that he had printed
11:06
onto some toilet paper
11:08
it's incredible he
11:11
he used his computer and he just used a
11:13
desktop computer in a normal printer
11:15
and he just put the liberal into the
11:17
print defeat wow
11:19
his defense barrett has barrister said
11:20
this is going to be the most expensive
11:22
takeaway of mr coburn's life
11:24
sad is the great achievement of peter
11:27
bezeljet
11:28
and not peter but he's joseph i mean
11:30
don't either is the great achievement of
11:31
joseph basil yet to be
11:32
undone by the arrival of moist
11:34
laboratory paper because this seems to
11:36
be
11:36
uh now considered unflashable and yet
11:38
everybody uses it
11:40
a lot of people use it yes yeah and uh
11:42
there was a report just recently saying
11:44
there is
11:45
they did tests there is no style of
11:48
moist paper or wipe that uh that is
11:51
suitable for our for our sewers without
11:53
creating
11:54
blocks that cost millions yeah the fat
11:56
burns
11:57
yeah everything you know everything has
11:59
a everything casts a shadow in this
12:01
world there is no such thing as a free
12:02
lunch and there's something as a free
12:04
bottom wipe
12:06
it's got a somewhere hasn't it it was
12:08
the number one cause i think they found
12:10
of those big fat burgs that they were
12:11
finding in the sewers as in if you took
12:13
percentages of what made it up
12:15
the fat the the wet wipes which were
12:17
largely i think more for babies than
12:18
they are for adults uh for
12:20
cleaning nappies uh that's what they
12:22
found and i read that
12:25
we basically have kfc to blame for that
12:27
colonel sanders is the person who took
12:28
the wet wipe and first introduced it
12:30
into restaurants
12:31
and that's spread around the world yeah
12:32
so before we were the moist
12:33
lemon-scented cleansing square
12:36
i think that's
12:42
they do make sense though i mean it is
12:43
bizarre um and i think people in other
12:45
countries think we're bizarre that we
12:46
use dry
12:47
paper um to get rid of that when it
12:51
makes no sense not to apply water
12:52
i mean we wash our hands if we think
12:54
there might be one bacteria on it and we
12:56
cover our bottoms
12:57
forward the b day yeah it will indeed
13:00
yeah
13:00
that's the answer but not everyone has
13:02
room for a b day but what they do have
13:04
room for and these becoming more and
13:05
more popular
13:06
a little installation says are now quite
13:07
cheap of a japanese style
13:10
um you know the kind of thing if you
13:12
plumb it you join into your plumbing
13:14
it's a seat and you have a remote
13:15
control and you press buttons and it
13:18
oscillates a jet
13:19
up the jacksie and it has a female
13:21
setting in a male setting
13:23
and it can also offer uh hot air to dry
13:26
sir or madam's backside and
13:30
these are becoming more popular and
13:31
considered very healthy and of course
13:32
there is no
13:33
nothing goes into the sewer except once
13:34
you once you've dropped in there
13:36
in nature's way so there is obviously it
13:38
costs energy because they're electric
13:40
um but those are going to be more and
13:41
more popular it's so funny you're um
13:44
just because your voice is so perfect
13:46
for talking and selling things as you
13:48
did that i thought your voice would be
13:49
fantastic for that would would sorrow
13:51
madame enjoy a
13:53
jet off the jacks there's a great story
13:56
about one of my heroes one of my
13:57
cinematic heroes as well many people
13:59
cinematic here are billy wilder the
14:00
great chat oh yeah director
14:02
you know some like at heart yeah some
14:04
sunset boulevard whatever
14:06
um many many great films and i think he
14:08
was in um
14:09
paris with marilyn monroe and tony
14:12
curtis and jack lemon and trying to keep
14:13
control particularly tony curtis and
14:15
mary monroe and his wife audrey who
14:17
might met funnily enough she told me
14:18
that story was true
14:20
um uh had said to him honey i want you
14:23
when you're in paris to get a proper
14:24
parisian b day because the um you know
14:28
the
14:28
wolcotts have got one or whoever it was
14:30
some family that she sort of um
14:32
keeping up with the jonesed with uh and
14:34
she felt that they want and he said sure
14:36
honey i get to i get to no problem
14:38
anyway he was so busy he was so busy in
14:40
paris that he just didn't get
14:41
old he didn't even have time to look at
14:43
the plumbing supply shop and
14:44
have a b day shipped over from paris to
14:47
beverly hills
14:48
uh and on in the car on the way to wasee
14:52
or
14:52
whatever the airport was then uh in
14:54
paris um he suddenly remembered and he
14:56
stopped off
14:58
at a at a bureau deposit to send a
15:00
telegram
15:01
uh to to to prepare for disappointments
15:04
and honey
15:05
tried everywhere nobody days in paris
15:08
suggest
15:09
doing handstanding shower
15:19
you might all know this but um is named
15:21
after a small extinct donkey yes
15:23
of course how did yeah so b-day is
15:26
french for
15:26
this species of small horse and so small
15:29
that the idea is with the b day you'd be
15:31
straddling it like
15:32
like this little wait is it okay is it a
15:34
real animal yeah
15:36
in italian the word for b-day translates
15:38
as hygienic little horse there you are
15:40
same thing yeah yeah yeah yeah but i
15:42
didn't think it was based on an extinct
15:44
real animal which people rode to clean
15:48
no no no no no
15:51
no no like a burrito looks like a little
15:54
donkey but yeah
15:55
it doesn't mean people at donkeys in the
15:57
way they eat burritos
15:58
time travelers when you go back open the
16:00
toilet there's a corn of cob and there's
16:01
a donkey
16:03
what am i meant to do here this toilet
16:05
paper that we were talking about the
16:06
main facts um
16:08
it it was uh it was shown at the 1878
16:12
paris exposition and it won the highest
16:14
prize it was seen as such an innovation
16:17
in
16:17
in uh anti-counterfeiting in
16:20
actual quality of lavatory lou roll so
16:23
the watermark
16:24
was the maker of the it wasn't that you
16:26
could have it in your own
16:27
family crest it was the it was the
16:29
watermark of the manufacturer of the
16:31
role promo that's the romo exactly
16:33
yeah that's who they were right yeah
16:34
yeah and there's so much they made
16:36
they might because they had amazing
16:38
inventions in the victorian era i know
16:39
the travelator
16:40
i think was there sometimes yeah
16:42
sometimes it's the simplest inventions
16:44
that are the best though isn't it you're
16:45
right certainly yeah
16:46
we do still all use lu roll yeah yeah
16:49
there was a period when they were they
16:50
called themselves medicated which is a i
16:52
suspect not a legally enforceable
16:54
meaningful word but isil medicated we
16:57
had at my prep school which was the
16:58
hideously tissue
16:59
one and bronco they claimed to be
17:02
medicaid what they were mitigated with i
17:03
don't know
17:07
the first package toilet paper was made
17:09
by um guyetti joseph guyetti and he
17:11
called it the therapeutic paper
17:14
some were named after queen victoria
17:16
what an honor
17:17
victorian brands of toilet paper i just
17:19
found a list of a few and they included
17:20
things like bulldog and samson and
17:22
virilla which is great um but there were
17:25
also others called victoria
17:27
and queen and gloria victis
17:32
i tell you about one because this is a
17:34
victorian invention oh yeah and a
17:35
victorian invention that actually was
17:37
made that i had never heard of before
17:39
but um bifocals for horses really got
17:42
these
17:42
really so this was in um the 1880s 1887
17:48
um someone went into a pharmacy and said
17:49
my horse has gone short-sighted i'm a
17:51
cab driver
17:54
but the thing is he likes to read the
17:56
paper so
17:58
he kept walking into things he's not
17:59
getting as many tips as he used to
18:01
um and it was actually tried out and
18:03
there are pictures of this horse there
18:05
are photographs of this horse wearing
18:06
these bifocals which
18:07
apparently it didn't like at first but
18:09
then it refused to
18:11
go without them and it got taken up by
18:13
handsome cab drivers because what they
18:15
actually did was
18:16
make the road seem like it was rising up
18:18
in the horse's face and so they used to
18:20
pick up their hooves
18:21
much higher and that looked you know
18:23
that was quite possible elegant
18:25
exactly yeah um so they started wearing
18:28
them
18:28
so that actually happened it actually
18:30
happened my focus was we know were
18:32
invented by benjamin franklin weren't
18:33
they
18:34
yes yeah but not equine ones
18:40
another bit of a bizarre invention from
18:42
the victorian times um
18:43
they used to if you went to a pub or any
18:45
kind of restaurant the opposite of today
18:47
smoking the smell of smoke was actively
18:49
encouraged and it made the place feel
18:51
like somewhere you wanted to be
18:52
somewhere that was happening so a lot of
18:54
the problem was if a restaurant started
18:56
its day it was not full of smoke so
18:58
someone invented
18:59
an automatic smoking machine the machine
19:02
would
19:02
have lip cigarettes exactly and it would
19:05
come out and so the idea is that it
19:06
would sort of cover
19:08
the restaurants in this mist of smoke
19:10
and you are going to go off fantastic
19:11
what happening
19:12
what a happening restaurant wow yeah do
19:14
we know if that got made
19:16
no i mean it got made but i don't know
19:18
if it was six i don't know if they made
19:19
more than one oh but they made a model
19:21
of it that is amazing yes yeah they used
19:22
to have competitive smoking in pubs in
19:25
the uk in the early 20th century did
19:27
they yeah
19:28
you would have a pipe and you'd have to
19:29
keep it oh yes that went on way
19:31
way to my lifetime oh yeah if you keep
19:33
it in america they had it too yeah
19:35
yeah everyone had an identical clay pipe
19:37
the whole point was it had to be sort of
19:39
controlled
19:39
they could play by an identical quantity
19:42
of like tobacco
19:43
uh and it was their job to light it and
19:45
keep it going
19:46
for as long as possible and it's
19:48
staggering how long they you know you or
19:50
i would have just kind of
19:51
gone out in seconds but they keep going
19:53
for hours and hours
19:54
putting their fingers over the the top
19:56
of the the bowl and
19:58
just loading start it is i was the very
20:01
last
20:01
um pipe smoker of the year ever
20:06
yeah it used to be a very popular thing
20:08
every year there's a
20:09
big dinner at the savoy hotel sponsored
20:12
by alfred dunhill who in those days were
20:14
primarily tobacconists yeah fashion
20:16
house of course
20:17
but their shop in german street was
20:19
filled with huge jars of tobacco
20:21
and and they were called um your salt um
20:24
snuff and tobacco were called the salt
20:26
so you'd hear someone come in and they
20:28
go hello your grace is like i've
20:30
ever got any of my salt in at the moment
20:32
there
20:33
would be a mixture of cavendish and
20:34
these strange names that these
20:36
particular
20:36
types of tobacco had and um anyway i
20:40
i uh it was actually q i
20:43
it was the very first qi i agreed to do
20:47
uh an interview for for the independent
20:49
i think it was
20:50
to to publicize the qi as a new program
20:53
and
20:54
um i went to the groucho club and at the
20:56
time
20:57
i had decided to try and cut down
20:58
cigarette smoking um but
21:00
i always carried a pipe with me i'd
21:02
always loved smoking but the first pipe
21:03
of the day i really enjoyed
21:05
so i had a pipe and i really felt like
21:07
smoking and those days you could smoke
21:08
anywhere and so
21:10
i lit the pipe and the photographer was
21:12
taking pictures of me and it was on the
21:13
front of the
21:14
independent that next day or whatever
21:16
the following week
21:17
and immediately i got a letter from the
21:19
pipe smoking association
21:21
it shows how desperate they were finally
21:24
because the old days they had harold
21:26
wilson and eric morkum and all these
21:28
kind of people who could be
21:29
the pipe smokers of the year but it was
21:31
running thin on the ground russ abbott
21:33
[Laughter]
21:35
and finally they and i said well i don't
21:38
really regularly smoke but and they made
21:39
me a special pipe which i still have
21:41
which is in the shape of a bbc
21:42
microphone and you can disassemble like
21:45
the man with the golden gun
21:47
apparatus and turn into a pipe um
21:51
it was really really fun are you
21:53
technically the reigning i am
21:55
yeah yeah i think they gave a very
21:58
special lifetime pipe award to the
22:00
comedy writer
22:01
lawrence marks who was also on the board
22:04
of the pipe smoking association
22:05
and obviously we all deprecate smoking
22:07
now and i don't smoke anymore i haven't
22:08
for
22:09
12 years i think it is but um but i
22:12
sometimes
22:12
think you know when i had a bit of a
22:14
cancer scare the uh earlier this year i
22:16
kind of think well if i got my death
22:17
sentence i would probably just
22:20
order a pipe online and a great you know
22:22
big great
22:24
vat of tobacco and just uh carry on
22:27
again
22:28
but i probably wouldn't actually it
22:29
probably tastes horrible in my mouth but
22:31
it's a memory of of that but i'm old
22:34
enough to remember smoking cinnamon
22:35
smoking in the tube smoking on buses
22:37
smoking absolutely everywhere even in
22:40
church you know there were grand
22:41
families had their boxed pews with brass
22:44
um brass uh ashtray so there's a squire
22:47
could have a cigar
22:49
but it was short it was really i mean
22:52
apart from pipes you know we think of
22:53
walter rally
22:54
it was really oscar wilde's generation
22:56
that made cigarettes popular and they
22:58
were considered very decadent and
22:59
extraordinary that was in the 1890s but
23:01
by
23:02
15 years later virtually 20 years later
23:04
it was the middle of the
23:05
first world war everyone did it i mean
23:08
it was just
23:09
everybody but we've only had about a
23:10
century of it basically yeah but and now
23:12
of course it looks
23:13
weird you see people doing it in in you
23:15
know like again that peter jackson thing
23:17
you just saw all those thomas smoking
23:18
away i love those things which is like
23:21
throughout all of history no one smoked
23:23
and then for one hundred years
23:25
everyone's supposed and then for the
23:26
rest of time no one will smoke again
23:28
so it's just even though to us it's a
23:29
normal thing yeah that's completely
23:31
unusual in the history of
23:33
absolutely there's that amazing moment
23:34
as well that america experienced and
23:36
it's covered in a adam curtis
23:38
documentary um power of nightmares i
23:39
think the documentary is called and the
23:41
idea was
23:42
that they realized in america that it
23:43
was only men smoking and they needed
23:45
women to smoke as well this is freud's
23:46
um brother-in-law
23:47
yes it is yeah and the idea was that
23:49
they empowered
23:50
the women of america to start smoking
23:53
saying that they were
23:54
something like sticks of freedom or
23:55
liberty
23:57
torches he paid for them to walk down
24:01
fifth avenue with cigarettes
24:02
yes it's a very famous picture i think
24:04
yes it's the same
24:06
member of the freud family who invented
24:08
bacon and eggs supposedly that's right
24:09
right oh really yeah he was the father
24:12
of the advertising
24:13
the father of healthy consumption
24:19
[Music]
24:21
okay it's time for fact number two and
24:23
that is andy
24:25
my fact is that in 1972 a canadian dj
24:28
held a contest to choose a canadian
24:29
national simile
24:30
like as american as apple pie the
24:33
winning entry was
24:34
as canadian as possible under the
24:36
circumstances
24:40
they don't know what similes are for a
24:42
star
24:45
yeah so sweet this was a dj called peter
24:47
zarsky
24:48
and uh he was a great canadian
24:50
broadcaster and he hosted shows for
24:51
decades and
24:52
you know lots of aspects of canadian
24:54
life he analyzed and
24:55
and examined and he hosted this
24:58
competition and a 17 year old student
24:59
came up with
25:01
that uh slogan as canadian as possible
25:03
and um
25:05
weirdly zarsky he just speaking about
25:07
smoking he once wrote an essay called
25:09
how to quit smoking in 50 years or less
25:17
yeah humorists and canada lots yeah
25:19
stephen lee cook obviously yeah his
25:20
famous writing humorous but all those
25:22
comedians like dan aykroyd and um
25:24
so many yes yeah they have an unfair
25:27
reputation don't they for being
25:29
dull um given that they which i'm not
25:31
saying i believe
25:32
but it is a reputation they have is it i
25:35
think nice
25:35
nice but a bit dull i remember when i
25:38
first went to toronto
25:40
just years and years and years ago and
25:42
uh i called up my friend and colleague
25:44
we were working together all the time
25:45
then hugh laurie and he he had never
25:46
been at that point
25:48
and he asked what he was like i said i
25:50
think probably
25:51
i can best describe how toronto is by
25:54
saying that
25:55
i asked at the front desk what you know
25:57
what attractions there were to see and
25:58
they said well there's a
25:59
the belly footwear museum down the
26:01
street
26:03
and i we laughed at that and then two
26:05
days later i said i can give you a
26:06
clearer idea
26:08
now i had nothing better to do than go
26:13
but in in fairness to toronto it has
26:15
improved enormously
26:17
in that regards the foot museum or the
26:18
whole system
26:20
he won the world series twice in a row
26:22
the blue jays and it became a
26:24
you know and now uh it's um yeah it's
26:27
pretty
26:27
ice just been three months in niagara on
26:29
the lake which is beautiful
26:31
oh wow town just on the right on the
26:33
american border
26:34
oh really and uh that was that was
26:36
stunning it's and they are very
26:39
aware of how the world looks at them and
26:41
they know that they're a bit
26:42
over polite yeah over you know
26:45
and do you find they are actually
26:47
factually like that aren't they i mean
26:48
there was a study done
26:49
looking at people's twitter feeds and it
26:51
was only comparing american
26:52
and canadian twitter feeds but the
26:55
preponderance of words
26:56
on american twitter feeds were negative
26:58
things so like hate and damn and bored
27:00
and annoying and then on canadian feeds
27:02
they're all just saying words like
27:03
favorite and gorgeous
27:05
who even says gorgeous anymore great
27:07
amazing
27:08
in um ontario they have the apology act
27:10
that came in in 2009 and that's because
27:12
people apologize all the time
27:14
and their law now is that an apology is
27:16
not allowed to be considered an
27:18
admission of guilt
27:19
because what would happen is you'd have
27:20
a little car crash or something
27:22
sorry sorry and they go well he said
27:24
sorry that's a bit of liability
27:26
because it isn't just a natural instinct
27:28
that's so good
27:30
um just on the boredom thing there is a
27:32
town in canada called okotoks
27:35
has anyone been no no well they had a
27:38
slogan a tourist slogan and it was
27:41
there are a number of things to do in
27:42
ocotes
27:45
very nice
27:48
[Laughter]
27:50
my friend john sessions did uh his post
27:53
uh graduate his doctorate
27:55
um at uh university in canada and he
27:58
waxes very very
27:59
miracle on his contempt for some of the
28:01
more dull sites
28:03
back then in the in the 80s i guess or
28:05
late 70s even in his case
28:07
and i happened to be in oxford at the
28:09
oxford i was filming there and i uh
28:11
there's the oxford university press shop
28:13
on the high or the broader whatever
28:15
yeah and um uh i was
28:18
ordering the new oxford english
28:20
dictionary
28:21
did the the second edition of the the
28:24
whole thing and it was
28:25
there was a special price uh for for
28:28
early buyer of it and it wasn't in the
28:29
shop it was in the
28:31
depository in northampton and they would
28:32
send it to any address and
28:34
and it was i don't know 1200 pounds or
28:36
something it's a huge number of
28:37
volumes of this massive dictionary and i
28:39
was terribly pleased with it and then i
28:41
was looking around
28:42
and i saw one of those oxford books of
28:44
you know you have boxing books of
28:46
quotations and so on this was the oxford
28:48
book of canadian political anecdotes
28:52
and i thought i must send this to john
28:54
sessions
28:56
insane
29:00
anyway i thought it was very amusing so
29:02
i took it up to the front of the desk
29:04
and then who should come into the shop
29:06
but jeremy paxman
29:07
had been across the road at all souls
29:09
having a lunch because he was doing a
29:11
book on the british establishment
29:13
so we what owed and said her though and
29:14
i sort of vaguely newman
29:16
um he i said look at this book i've got
29:18
here it says it's the oxford book of
29:19
canadian political anecdotes and he said
29:22
like that and then the assistant behind
29:24
the desk said that'll be 1217
29:28
and jeremy baxter could only see that
29:32
what and i said oh yes very rare
29:35
i mean canadian political energy jeremy
29:37
come on
29:38
and he was going are you mad and
29:41
and the assistant bless him he joined in
29:43
and said oh yes yes very very rare
29:45
so i signed it and baxter went off
29:47
pulling at his hair doing all those
29:49
money sort of expressions and then
29:52
it was it wasn't until two years later i
29:55
was filming again in oxford and i'd been
29:57
asked to do this
29:58
spectator diary you know yeah and and so
30:00
i told that story in the spectator diary
30:02
and about two days later i got this
30:03
furious letter from jeremy paxton
30:05
i have been dining out on how mad you
30:08
are
30:09
i know i discover
30:13
um there's something else canadians are
30:15
very well known for is saying a
30:17
oh yeah um are you right it's nice
30:20
weather today a
30:21
but not in that accident in a canadian
30:22
accident the canadian alphabet a-a-b-a
30:28
exactly so the university of british
30:30
columbia has an
30:32
official a lab which is it's their
30:34
syntax of speech lab is where you go if
30:36
you want to study the linguistics of
30:37
that kind of thing
30:37
and it's called the a lab very good
30:41
yes and i think it's first so it goes
30:43
back a long time it goes back to
30:45
before canada was a country at all so
30:48
1773 it appeared in an irish play
30:51
and you know irish people went to canada
30:53
and then it appeared in a book in the
30:54
1830s
30:56
uh that was completely littered with it
30:58
but yeah it's weird
30:59
why they might do that so i think that's
31:01
been a suggestion that
31:02
um there is a small bit of england where
31:05
there's a similar
31:06
um inflection and i can't remember where
31:07
it is actually but people took it from
31:09
there
31:10
because the accent is not dissimilar as
31:12
it creeps over the border into wisconsin
31:14
and north dakota if you think of that
31:16
movie fargo and the
31:17
wonderful francis mcdormand performance
31:19
is there you've got to question your
31:20
police work there
31:22
kind of it's got that similar kind of
31:24
slight and there
31:25
the the reason is supposedly the
31:27
scandalwegian input into
31:29
wisconsin and that part they're all
31:30
called sorensen in favor of the
31:32
bill macy character was called gundersen
31:34
i think wasn't he they've all got names
31:35
like that
31:36
okay the other thing it's just the size
31:38
of the place yeah and that it's
31:39
vastly they think of america's big but
31:41
canada fans out into a greater width and
31:44
up into the arctic circle
31:45
there's a great story isn't there the uh
31:47
sort of like a gap year where
31:49
um a woman writes to her sister who's
31:50
canadian and says um
31:52
my son your nephew has got his gap here
31:54
and he's uh he'd be landing in
31:57
newfoundland uh um uh what if you could
31:59
pick him up
32:00
and her sister lived in british columbia
32:03
so she sent
32:04
a reply back why don't you you're nearer
32:06
[Laughter]
32:08
we are nearer here in britain to the to
32:11
that coast than uh
32:18
i love that a female lumberjack is a
32:20
lumberjill i think that's a
32:22
that's a lovely term um but i've
32:24
discovered there's a thing
32:25
they clothing i was reading about their
32:26
clothing and um there have been
32:28
lumberjack trousers invented which i've
32:31
never seen before and the idea is that
32:32
they are chain
32:33
uh chainsaw proof you can't chainsaw
32:36
through them and there are videos yeah
32:37
on youtube of lumberjacks showing you
32:40
and they they all start the video by
32:41
going do not do this at home do not do
32:42
this
32:43
do not do so and they they rev it up and
32:45
the chainsaw gets going and they just
32:47
slam it down onto their trousers and the
32:49
fabric it's eight layers of the plastic
32:51
that are it's a there's a whole science
32:53
video you can watch about the beauty of
32:54
the science of how it works
32:56
and you can watch it immediately get
32:57
chewed up in the trousers and
32:59
and stall the chainsaw immediately
33:02
it's extraordinary scary the first
33:05
person to try and yet it can fill a tree
33:07
yes exactly yeah imagine if accident you
33:10
know you were going out and your
33:11
your also lumberjack wife had put out
33:13
your other pair of trousers that morning
33:16
just after they were filming honey oh
33:17
great have fun
33:21
so i was looking up other slogans in
33:23
canada and place name slogans
33:25
so ottawa launched a new slogan in 2001
33:28
and the slogan was
33:29
technically beautiful
33:36
so despite what you're looking at
33:38
[Laughter]
33:40
what they were trying to say is that
33:41
it's technologically advanced it's great
33:45
okay with the canadian broadcasting
33:47
corporation they responded saying the
33:48
response to the slogan might be
33:50
described as technically mixed
33:52
i do have to share with you just on the
33:54
basis of that sort of interrupt but
33:56
this thing of getting yourself a phrase
33:58
a logo a
33:59
uh you know a strap line whatever you
34:01
want to call it as a country a city
34:03
estate and
34:04
and when i was touring across all the
34:05
american states for a bbc documentary
34:07
years ago
34:08
um you noticed every time you crossed a
34:10
state line that uh they would say
34:11
welcome to
34:12
uh mississippi and it would have its
34:14
official name you know the magnolia
34:15
state and there'd be some
34:17
this phrase like come play or something
34:19
like that you know
34:21
and the one that i really wanted to
34:23
congratulate was kentucky now kentucky
34:25
is probably known for two things i mean
34:27
the bluegrass state is its official
34:29
nickname but they wanted a kind of one
34:31
that expressed what it was to be a
34:34
and you think of two things you think of
34:35
the kentucky derby and you think of
34:37
bourbon
34:38
and they came up with a two-word phrase
34:40
that incorporated
34:42
both that both those two things uh and
34:44
it's beautiful horse throat
34:46
because you'll have a horse throat if
34:48
you drink bourbon and they have lots of
34:50
force
34:51
it's unbridled spirit isn't that
34:55
great genius whoever thought of that
34:59
better
35:00
did
35:05
[Laughter]
35:13
um identity aren't they though and state
35:15
slogans and it
35:16
really took off in the 20s and 30s i
35:18
think and um they've all got state
35:20
symbols and in fact um
35:22
i've put down here mexico but i think i
35:24
meant to write new mexico because mexico
35:25
is not
35:26
a state of america new mexico is the
35:28
only u.s state that has and it's legally
35:30
enshrined
35:31
um a official state question
35:35
um and the state question is red or
35:38
green
35:39
and do you know why is it a game show or
35:41
something
35:42
no it's because chili is very important
35:44
in their
35:45
cuisine and apparently you know you get
35:47
you're asking the restaurant red or
35:49
green
35:49
and that's what you go for so they've
35:50
got a steak question that's good we
35:52
could have like
35:53
tomato sauce or brown sauce as the
35:55
british one as
36:00
myself by saying i'm afraid i've never
36:01
had brown sauce and i wasn't making a
36:03
point i didn't
36:04
disapprove of brussels many of my very
36:06
closest friends
36:08
whom i admire in the world regularly buy
36:10
it i just
36:11
had never tried it have you sensed i've
36:13
never watched
36:14
strictly come dancing it's just one of
36:16
those things that i've never got around
36:17
to and i'm very strong feeling i never
36:19
will
36:20
it does upset some people because yeah
36:23
did they do they bring you brown sauce i
36:25
have since tasted it and it's perfectly
36:26
nice it's
36:27
slightly vinegary but it makes me cough
36:29
a bit when you first breathe in you know
36:31
i think it's because that's two
36:33
quintessentially british things
36:35
yes steven fry and brown sauce it feels
36:37
like they surely together doesn't it
36:38
well you see this is it whenever there's
36:40
a binary question like you know tomato
36:42
ketchup or brown sauce i will
36:43
immediately assume there isn't i'll say
36:45
mustard
36:51
some more canadian things perhaps it's
36:53
very cold in caledonia
36:55
famous the coldest they've ever had is
36:58
minus 62.8 degrees
37:00
and that was in a place called snag in
37:02
yukon
37:03
and the residents would walk around like
37:05
zombies because if they walk too fast
37:07
they would get out of breath
37:09
uh and the something to do with the the
37:12
way that the air went
37:13
meant that you could hear things from a
37:14
massive distance so it's very very dry
37:17
air
37:17
and very very um dense uh in one so like
37:22
yeah absolutely and it meant that you
37:24
could hear people talking from five
37:25
kilometers away you could
37:27
overhear the conversation oh no there's
37:29
lots of fallings out
37:30
neighbors bitching about people in the
37:32
next town you're walking so slowly that
37:33
you can't get to them to say hey
37:38
yeah i have not put on winter weight
37:39
thanks very much i did a film in
37:41
winnipeg once and that gets to minus 40
37:44
which is very very cold um i told my
37:47
father
37:47
that my brother who was there said uh is
37:50
that
37:51
centigrade or fahrenheit my father who's
37:53
a physicist brilliantly came back
37:55
straight away
37:55
since i'm making a difference my brother
37:57
was very cross about this is what i mean
37:59
it doesn't make any difference
38:00
it doesn't make any difference but
38:02
that's ridiculous because it makes a
38:03
difference and my father just happened
38:04
to know
38:05
and we start giving it away that minus
38:07
40 is exactly the same
38:09
it sounds great where they're identical
38:13
so it's when it's minus 40 it doesn't
38:15
make any difference
38:16
which which you're using celsius i hope
38:19
he never revealed
38:20
no he was the kind of person who if
38:21
you've got cold in the kitchen would
38:22
open the fridge you know
38:23
like a true physicist yes
38:26
and those of us who are superstitious
38:28
about these things surely he's going to
38:30
make the room colder
38:31
don't you know anything about
38:32
thermodynamics that could only make it
38:34
warmer
38:35
i was wondering about national
38:37
stereotypes and where like
38:39
across the world and how old they are
38:40
and partly because i'm reading
38:43
um martin charles at the moment which
38:44
has amazing descriptions of americans in
38:47
it and it's just so
38:48
interesting that his descriptions are
38:50
hilarious and exactly what you'd
38:52
describe very satirical they're so
38:54
satirical so it's brilliant so um one of
38:56
my favorite scenes is where martin has
38:58
just gone to america spoiler and he's
39:00
hanging out with americans for the first
39:01
time and he's astonished at how much
39:02
they eat
39:03
and how fast they eat and i just loved
39:06
his quote that said the poultry
39:07
uh for there was a turkey at the top a
39:09
pair of ducks at the bottom and two
39:10
fowls in the middle
39:12
disappeared as rapidly as if every bird
39:14
had had the use of its wings and had
39:16
flown in desperation down a human throat
39:21
he was sadly disappointed in america
39:23
though dickens wasn't in as much as
39:24
that there's that wonderful bit in
39:26
charlottesville have you come up to it
39:27
yet
39:28
the water tastes society yes uh which is
39:30
really stuck
39:31
the watertown society is an american
39:33
fenian society a
39:34
a home rule for ireland society and
39:38
charleswood is invited
39:39
as someone who apparently believes in
39:40
home rule for the irish and all the
39:42
americans
39:43
um say how cruel the lion of albion
39:47
with its uh paws and its claws tearing
39:50
at the throat of the free irish
39:52
and the water toast society exists to to
39:54
to to
39:55
to spread the gospel of freedom uh for
39:58
all people
39:59
and chelsea got up and said yes and i
40:01
know you must all feel the same about uh
40:03
about your slaves and and your indians
40:07
and there was a terrible silence yes and
40:10
they burned the water toast
40:11
meeting all down to the ground and the
40:13
society's never heard off again
40:15
and as dickens really having a go at the
40:17
fact that americans were all very
40:19
good at saying how to look at you and
40:22
ireland but the moment
40:23
the torch was back on them
40:26
yeah the hypocrisy of it is amazing as
40:28
well just speaking of in the first fact
40:30
about
40:31
um anti-counterfeit measures of the
40:32
watermark wasn't a large part of his
40:34
life dominated by
40:36
stopping um the copying of his books and
40:38
the reselling and that would
40:40
he took a huge part of his and a large
40:42
part of his hatred for america again
40:43
because that's where
40:44
it was and he tried to get twain and
40:47
very fast
40:47
when he was a young man who'd never been
40:49
heard of and he was just doing the text
40:50
to a famous illustrator and he did the
40:53
text of the proceedings of the pickwick
40:54
club and
40:55
slowly it just took off and everyone
40:56
said who is this right at the right
40:58
yes the drawings are very nice but the
40:59
writing before it had
41:02
even finished its cyrillis form there
41:03
were the pinklewick papers the piggy
41:06
week chronicles
41:07
there were so many of these uh uh pirate
41:11
versions floating around and dickens was
41:13
always furious at that yes yeah
41:15
i love the idea of sort of back alley
41:17
editions of dickens you think you're
41:19
buying some uncut
41:20
pickwick yeah you get it home and open
41:22
the papers and it turns out you've got
41:23
some pink
41:24
wick if you read the diaries of the
41:27
james family for example henry james and
41:29
his brother william the famous
41:30
psychiatrist or psychologist i mean and
41:33
the allcots and all the
41:34
new england literary families they would
41:37
gather together
41:38
uh on a sunday um and the previous
41:41
saturday
41:42
one of them would have gone down to the
41:43
docks to get the latest dickens
41:46
and they would arrive in bundles and
41:49
they'd be cut open and you would you
41:50
know you
41:51
race home with it bring as many people
41:54
around from
41:54
you know who were similar literally bent
41:56
or excited and read the next
41:58
chapter and it was like the most
42:00
exciting thing and henry james talks
42:02
about remembering this as a boy sitting
42:04
under the table
42:05
and and in particular the one that we
42:06
now most laugh at or is
42:08
probably least regarded as a great
42:10
dickens novel is
42:12
the old curiosity shop and partly
42:14
because of oscar wilde's
42:16
famous comment is that you have to have
42:18
a heart of stone
42:19
to read of the death of little nell
42:21
without laughing
42:23
[Laughter]
42:25
but but but they were so excited about
42:28
little now
42:28
that that that was there was a riot at
42:30
the docks in boston
42:32
everyone shouting is nell dead is nell
42:34
dead and it was like
42:36
you know later on there was the jr in in
42:38
dallas and there have been such things
42:40
and i guess people want to know what the
42:41
finale of this game of thrones episode
42:43
is but
42:44
really nothing touched that experience
42:45
thank you ordinary effect and am i right
42:47
saying they
42:48
people on the ship actually announced it
42:50
it wasn't even the point of taking it
42:51
home and reading someone said spoiler
42:53
yeah
42:54
ultimate spoiler yeah
42:58
phil hayden is the mold collar defects
43:03
the horrible experience for our
43:04
listeners
43:05
[Laughter]
43:07
we need to get a new captain of this
43:09
ship this guy is the narrator in the
43:11
murder
43:12
of roger akroyd who does the murder
43:14
policeman in
43:15
corporate christmas somebody unwinded
43:27
okay it is time for fact number three
43:29
and that is
43:30
chozinski yes my fact this week is that
43:32
the scholar who first discovered that
43:34
the noah's ark story predates the bible
43:37
got so excited by it that he stripped
43:39
off his clothes and ran naked around the
43:41
british museum
43:43
and this this is just how thrilling it
43:45
was this was
43:46
in 1853 and this
43:50
amazing discovery was made which was
43:52
basically the palaces of um
43:54
the this great assyrian king and the
43:56
library of nineveh
43:57
and this person found them and then this
43:59
scholar called george smith
44:00
back in the british museum who was very
44:02
devout christian translated this tablet
44:04
and realized this is the noah story and
44:07
um
44:08
freaked out and apparently took some
44:11
clothes off and ran around the museum
44:12
but it was fair enough because it was a
44:14
big deal yeah the excitement was so
44:16
great for him that was his only way of
44:18
expressing
44:19
it he wasn't a nudist basically it was
44:22
it was just
44:23
he was too much certain he was
44:25
completely starkers yeah
44:27
he may have i think you took off some
44:28
clothes some sources say
44:30
you know maybe he kept his willian i
44:33
tell you what though they get excited
44:34
about things in very odd ways at the
44:35
british museum
44:36
i have a friend who james and i know and
44:38
i think stephen you might have met him
44:40
he's called irving phil
44:41
yeah the great the great uh yeah the
44:43
great great wedge um
44:44
the cuneiform yeah and i was i was
44:47
behind the scenes with him at the
44:49
museum and he showed me a sort of a cast
44:51
of the
44:52
of the tablet the cuneiform noah's ark
44:54
tablet that he used to study because he
44:56
actually studied it further
44:58
decoded certain aspects of it that had
45:00
not been seen before which was the
45:01
actual measurements from noah's ark and
45:03
they recreated it which is amazing but
45:05
while we were sitting there in the very
45:07
beginning of our meeting
45:08
he suddenly got an email and jumped up
45:10
from a seat and he went quick
45:12
run and we ran through the corridor i
45:14
was chasing
45:15
you naked at the time
45:22
um but so he he sort of ran down the
45:25
corridor and then he cut into the
45:27
kitchen
45:28
and we stopped and what happened and he
45:29
said there's just been an announcement
45:30
there's orange juice in the fridge for
45:32
any member
45:34
and he said you've got to be quick
45:35
everyone gets to it before i do and we
45:37
quickly had two cups and went back into
45:39
his room so
45:40
that is classic academic when i first
45:42
went to cambridge to do an interview
45:44
at cambridge i saw these two old dons in
45:46
black gowns and i thought i'll follow
45:48
them and i'll hear them talking about uh
45:50
aristotle or something really really
45:53
intellectual
45:54
and one of them was saying no no it
45:55
comes in a small package
45:57
about the size of a single play record a
46:00
45 rpm record
46:01
and it's full of comminuted little
46:03
pieces that come to life when you pour
46:05
boiling water in them
46:07
um and i assure you it's singularly
46:09
tooths a chicken noodle
46:12
the company is called nor with a k a
46:14
silent k
46:16
and that's what they were talking about
46:17
i was thinking wow that's not what i
46:19
expected
46:20
but it was very pleasing but so this
46:22
this academic what was his do you
46:24
know his name george smith george smith
46:27
and was it the
46:28
cognitive dissonance isn't quite the
46:30
word was it the shock that
46:32
the bible might not story might not be
46:34
true or that it is true but
46:36
not as the bible tells it it's confusing
46:38
because he was pleased whereas i would
46:40
have thought yes how shocking but i
46:42
think it was almost like good this is
46:43
verifying that the bible
46:46
was the truth perhaps he was obsessed
46:48
with great habits
46:49
yes because of course the greeks also
46:51
around the same time they had a flood
46:54
myth deucalion and pyramid yes um
46:57
and the same thing they had a wooden
46:58
chest it's called in the way it's
47:00
translated but it might as well be
47:01
called an arc because an arc is a chest
47:03
as much as it is anything else
47:04
the ark of the covenant is a chest after
47:06
all it's a strange word
47:08
and and so the duquesne and piropira was
47:11
the daughter of
47:12
uh pandora the first woman so it's a
47:14
very early thing that
47:15
mankind displeased the gods and they
47:17
sent the flood and deucalion and pira
47:20
survived because they were warned about
47:21
it
47:22
and then when they landed it wasn't on
47:24
well we think now mount ararat the uh
47:26
supposedly the arc landed
47:28
they said many people believe noah's ark
47:29
was a manta ray but it landed somewhere
47:31
in
47:32
uh and they were told by athena i think
47:35
it was they were told to throw the burns
47:36
of their mother over their shoulders
47:39
and they didn't know what that meant and
47:40
they were very confusing they said are
47:42
the bones of my mother
47:42
these stones mother earth so they threw
47:45
stones and whatever pirate threw a stone
47:46
over her shoulder
47:48
a woman sprang up out of the ground
47:49
wherever to carry in a
47:57
it's a similar thing you know a
47:59
punishment and and and the
48:01
um uh philemon and bulky stories is also
48:04
another flood and so they exist you know
48:07
at least two versions in greek myth many
48:09
others in other mediterranean messages
48:11
sumerian
48:12
acadian babylonians yes i mean i think
48:15
these guys stole
48:16
a lot from the babylonians in fact
48:17
they're syrians so they probably got it
48:19
but yeah they all have been
48:20
passed down is it like that 5000 bc was
48:23
it when there was a
48:23
all those civilizations the mayans and
48:26
the the
48:27
all these cities suddenly were evacuated
48:28
these great it seems there seems to have
48:31
been a plague that was common
48:32
across uh early civilizations how
48:35
amazing is that it's passed down
48:36
yes and of course yeah but
48:40
this this myth is particularly bizarre
48:42
so this is the
48:43
how the assyrian myth had it in the
48:44
libra at nineveh when they found it
48:46
and i didn't realize this is in the epic
48:48
of gilgamesh so the very famous
48:50
uh discovery most famous discovery that
48:52
was made there and
48:53
the belief the story as it was told was
48:56
that there was this huge flood
48:57
and before the flood then um god had
49:00
delivered all his messages to people via
49:02
these fish these weird fish creatures
49:04
so they were right near the persian gulf
49:05
and the idea was these huge fish
49:07
creatures
49:07
used to come out of the persian gulf in
49:09
the day and they'd go and they'd tell
49:10
the assyrians what to do they'd be like
49:12
don't drink that
49:13
uh be nice to your mom etc and then this
49:16
huge flood came and it basically
49:18
poisoned the fish creatures so they
49:20
never came back
49:21
and after the flood there was lots of
49:22
disease because it um you know floods
49:24
will cause disease and it was thought
49:25
that was part of the god's punishment
49:27
and from that moment onward the gods
49:29
stopped visiting them with these
49:31
fish creatures and so yeah that was the
49:33
thing and that was why you had to have
49:34
human scholars
49:35
who were the ones who then received
49:36
messages from the gods via um strangers
49:40
as well it's the same thing god provides
49:41
a rainbow at the end of the to
49:43
as a covenant that he will not interfere
49:46
again
49:47
so it also marks the that's like
49:49
withdrawal of god from the people of
49:50
israel and
49:51
his chosen people in at that moment he's
49:54
slightly more distant
49:55
from a few prophets like a show creator
49:57
handing over yeah you know
49:59
russell t davis to stephen
50:03
so is the vibe not all right fine if
50:04
that's how you want to do it i'll leave
50:06
you to it is it a bitter kind of god
50:08
saying fine whatever get on with it then
50:10
there's still some things that are
50:11
punished
50:12
and in the same way that the the the
50:14
real punishment uh is
50:15
is a transgression of zenya in greek
50:18
mythology which is the
50:19
guest friendship and you honor you do as
50:21
a host to a stranger who comes to your
50:23
door
50:23
uh and that that's really what the story
50:25
did of of
50:27
philemon baukas is about and that's why
50:28
they're visited with a flood because
50:30
everyone in the village turns away zeus
50:32
and hermes who appear as travellers
50:34
except this old couple who welcomed them
50:36
and that actually is closer to the story
50:38
of lotte and his wife
50:39
in the sins uh you know the city of the
50:41
plain uh sodom and gomorrah
50:43
if you remember an angel angels come you
50:45
know looking puzzled as if you haven't
50:46
read the bible then yeah
50:53
you certainly have um of sodom and
50:54
gomorrah what happens is angels come
50:57
go to so they hear about what wicked
50:58
city the the cities of the plane are
51:00
at the bottom of the dead sea um they
51:03
still see signs when you travel down the
51:05
road that jordan saying sodom that way
51:07
very pleasing
51:08
but um anyway yeah the the angels
51:10
arrived uh
51:12
and were uh treated very very rudely and
51:14
even more rudely by one particular
51:16
citizen of sodom
51:17
who wanted to know the angel
51:20
and that is where the phrase to know
51:21
them in the biblical sense comes from in
51:23
other words he tried to seduce this
51:25
angel
51:25
and sodomy sodomite and the whole idea
51:27
that sodom was this place because that
51:29
one reference in the bible someone who
51:30
wanted to know the angel
51:33
and they punished the city with fire
51:35
they um
51:36
and except for the holy couple just like
51:38
duquesne and berkus who are i mean um
51:41
bikers uh who were lot and his wife
51:44
and they were allowed but they mustn't
51:46
look back and it was exactly the same in
51:48
the greek myth
51:49
there's no new stories they're they're
51:50
all boys from each other well
51:52
uh stephen you said that they have the
51:53
um the rainbow at the end of
51:55
noah's yes he sends that as a covenant
51:57
doesn't he yeah he then
51:59
according to genesis uh he began to be a
52:01
husbandman
52:02
and planted a vineyard noah's vineyard
52:04
yes yes
52:06
and was drunken and he was uncovered
52:09
within his tent
52:10
so he basically once he finished he got
52:12
drunk and got naked that's
52:14
that's what you do well we see finally a
52:15
story in the bible to which everyone
52:19
have done a noah you know the fish
52:22
creature that you're talking about so
52:24
i'm going off memory here but
52:25
depictions i've seen of it is it's a
52:27
sort of reverse mermaid it's a fish head
52:29
with legs
52:31
it was a partial human-based thing and
52:33
it's used as those ancient alien kind of
52:35
things that that was a higher knowledge
52:37
that was coming
52:38
to educate and create these amazing
52:41
um civilizations at the time yeah no one
52:43
keen on that like a chat right all right
52:46
no such thing as a fish man
52:49
but it's interesting though because of
52:51
course all the evangelists who
52:53
who became part of the temperance
52:54
movement at the end of the 19th century
52:56
uh believed everything in the bible but
52:59
they had to
53:00
they had to rule out wine and wine is
53:02
unquestionably approved of throughout
53:04
the bible not only is noah the
53:06
first example of it but uh but christ's
53:08
first miracle is turning water into wine
53:10
at the wedding in canaan so it is clear
53:12
and indeed obviously the
53:13
last supper and everything that becomes
53:15
so it's quite difficult to if you're
53:17
to believe in all the bible but decide
53:19
that alcohol is terrible
53:21
clearly uh vindicated weren't there some
53:22
translations where they changed it to
53:24
grape juice
53:26
like that yeah imagine what kind of bore
53:29
you'd have to be to make the bible less
53:31
sexy
53:36
um this guy george smith who deciphered
53:39
the cuneiform so
53:40
he's an amazing guy because he left
53:42
education at the age of 14
53:44
he became an engraver of banknotes at
53:46
the bank of england
53:47
so as a result he had an incredible eye
53:50
he could detect incredible
53:51
details in banknotes that he was
53:53
engraving that other people couldn't
53:55
spot so
53:56
and also he was obsessed with these
53:58
cuneiform tablets
53:59
so he he firstly you know he delivered
54:03
this lecture
54:03
saying the noah's ark story is a hebrew
54:06
adaptation of a much older story which
54:09
created huge controversy because it was
54:10
quite soon after
54:12
on the origin of species it was another
54:14
way of you know it was another geology
54:16
was also doing its damnedest to
54:17
undermine
54:18
yeah what uh yes was it ruskin called
54:20
those damned hammers
54:22
yeah chipping away at every truth that
54:23
was understood so he was kind of a
54:25
controversial figure but then
54:27
the the amazing thing was in this uh
54:29
tablet that he had translated
54:31
uh of the noah's ark story there was a
54:32
section that was missing there were
54:34
about 17 lines
54:35
that were missing from the tablet just
54:37
ended there
54:38
and the daily telegraph offered a
54:40
thousand guineas to whoever found
54:43
this missing 11 lines of cuneiform
54:45
tablet obviously with him in mind
54:46
because he was the expert he knew all
54:48
about it
54:49
and he went there he went to what is now
54:51
mosul which is where the
54:52
the library um
54:55
and it was where the mod the library had
54:58
been of uh king sennacherib is that it
55:00
was it was sorry where the library of
55:04
king ashrae benappel had been and
55:06
he got to the site of the library it was
55:08
a huge site was about three miles across
55:09
the whole city
55:10
and so it was like looking for a you
55:12
know it really was needle and haystack
55:14
stuff
55:14
he looked at the and he went to the pit
55:17
of the old libraries the likeliest place
55:18
he'd find it
55:19
and he found it had been used as a
55:20
quarry and it was a complete mess of
55:22
rubble
55:22
you know different different fragments
55:25
from all over all different centuries
55:27
but he started looking and the amazing
55:28
thing was he found it
55:30
he found a tiny he must only he could
55:33
have found it yeah
55:34
exactly he found these 17 lines which
55:36
completed the noah's ark story and he
55:38
brought it back
55:39
did they see a naked man running back
55:40
out of the quarry
55:43
wow fabulous yeah imagine that feeling
55:46
wow yeah and also that's kind of a nice
55:49
mirroring of actually
55:51
what happened in terms of collecting the
55:53
information for the library
55:54
at the time so in the assyrian culture
55:56
so this is like uh three thousand years
55:58
ago
55:58
and ashurbanipal wanted to collect all
56:00
human knowledge ever at that point
56:02
and he'd collect all these tablets and
56:04
when and got scholars to write them
56:06
and if there was something missing he'd
56:08
say oh there's this story that i've
56:09
heard about and i don't have it he'd put
56:10
a call out to everyone in his kingdom
56:12
saying everyone go hunting so all the
56:14
assyrians knew what he was looking
56:16
for and there'd be a reward and they'd
56:17
just go scouting out it was one of the
56:19
biggest
56:19
kind of kingdoms that had ever existed
56:22
right it was
56:22
all of north africa um
56:26
all the way across yeah it was huge and
56:28
so it was after
56:34
the assyrian came down like a wolf on
56:36
the fold those girls were
56:38
shining in scarlet and gold oh really
56:41
how was he what he was killed the
56:43
destruction of sennacherib i think
56:44
oh really someone listening one though
56:47
aren't the assyrians named after
56:49
noah's grandson
56:53
yeah it's actually one of the tribes
56:55
isn't it yeah asher
56:56
and um that's where assyria or assyrian
56:59
comes from
57:00
so there's staring us from hashem of
57:03
course
57:03
seamites so um and as in hamsham and
57:07
yeah and uh if you're anti-semitic
57:09
technically it means you don't like
57:10
arabs
57:11
as much as anything because they are
57:13
before the split from
57:14
between abraham and ishmael who were the
57:18
patriarchs of the two different peoples
57:19
there was abraham and ishmael ishmael
57:22
went out and founded the arab people as
57:23
it were
57:24
and abraham uh was the patriarch of the
57:28
jewish people wow yeah so you're even
57:31
more prejudiced than you actually
57:32
thought
57:33
yes yeah they also had with the kineform
57:36
tablet something
57:37
interesting they were they were used
57:39
constantly so they wouldn't fire them
57:41
and make them a solid
57:42
because they wanted to reuse them so
57:43
once a tablet had been read
57:45
they could re-mold it and make it better
57:47
but what that meant was if they were
57:49
ever attacked the assyrians and
57:50
let's say their places were burnt down
57:52
by burning down their libraries
57:54
they were actually preserving their
57:55
information because the clay would be
57:57
fired up baked
57:58
yeah so they would bake the information
58:00
into that's the whole reason the whole
58:02
library
58:03
innovate the reason it survives is
58:04
because of that it's such a funny irony
58:06
and it's such a good thing because the
58:08
assyrians were eventually taken down by
58:09
the the babylonians
58:11
and the uh i think it's the uh they're
58:13
like from the iranian
58:14
area currently iranian the needs and the
58:16
babylonians yes
58:18
meats meats and persians with the two
58:20
groups that made up was the mermaids
58:22
as in dorothy parker's famous remark one
58:25
man's mead is another man's persian
58:27
oh well maybe she'd argue with um
58:31
i think i can't remember who was saying
58:32
this but the medes weren't particularly
58:33
cultured
58:34
uh so the babylonians would have taken
58:36
these tablets and preserved them and
58:37
gone oh my god this is learning
58:38
but the me's just went and sold it let's
58:40
burn the whole thing down and then
58:41
ironically they managed by doing that to
58:43
completely preserve them forever so in
58:45
your face
58:48
and they're so revealing aren't they
58:49
about what it is to be human because
58:51
like almost all ancient forms of writing
58:52
95 percent of it is taxation
58:55
and accounting um and storage of
58:59
grain but then you get this fabulous bit
59:01
the bit that irving finger is so excited
59:02
by the the
59:03
children's uh the equivalent of the
59:05
exercise book where you have the
59:07
little clay tablets that he has in the
59:08
british museum which you can go and see
59:10
which are children writing insults about
59:14
their teachers
59:16
i mean it's just delicious yeah real
59:19
insight it's just
59:20
fun yeah there is one story which i
59:21
haven't found any i've found it in one
59:23
source only and it's
59:24
so i think it's not true but it's of a
59:27
clay bottle and there was an apprentice
59:29
at the british museum who
59:30
would not rest until he had deciphered
59:32
this inscription
59:33
on the bottle and it turned out to read
59:35
please replace stopper in bottle
59:38
i'm 90 sure it's a joke that's like that
59:41
wooden
59:42
post that had toti emel esto
59:45
written on it for the two three
59:48
uh four-letter words toti emel e-m-u-l
59:52
esto and personal that's it sort of
59:55
looks latin
59:56
you know symbol so why emil but esto is
59:59
not quite right
60:00
late latin maybe pig latin might have
60:02
esto toti
60:03
all something and at some point i said
60:06
no that's to thai
60:07
mules too
60:15
[Music]
60:18
okay it is time for our final fact of
60:20
the show and that is
60:21
james okay my fact this week is that the
60:23
rarest frog in
60:25
england has a distinctive norfolk accent
60:29
very pleasant now i've heard of birds
60:33
having local accents
60:34
yeah wrong well actually i'm sure you
60:37
can tell us about the californian
60:39
western literal frog oh the one which
60:42
you hear in hollywood yeah the one the
60:43
only frog
60:45
yes yes that's because it was used by
60:47
sound recorders to do
60:48
backgrounds for the jungle and
60:49
everything wasn't it is that right uh
60:51
that yeah
60:51
i think i saw that on q i think it was
60:53
not quite that's my memory
60:56
uh so this is the northern pool frog uh
60:58
it was
60:59
extinct in um in england in norfolk and
61:02
they found out doing 10 years of
61:05
research
61:06
that they had this distinctive call
61:09
which is common to the norfolk area it's
61:12
a unique accent and
61:13
that and some genetics made them realize
61:15
that it was
61:16
endemic to norfolk which meant that they
61:18
could bring it back and they've just
61:20
recently put it back into some pools in
61:22
norfolk wonderful in the broads or the
61:24
fence presumably
61:25
yeah and the broads yeah very satisfying
61:27
and does it does it bear any resemblance
61:29
to the human norfolk accent
61:30
uh it's just a slightly deeper rivet
61:34
one single comment about it being fonder
61:36
of its sister than most
61:38
and i will be very cross indeed um so
61:41
humans can tell if frogs
61:43
are excited or not this is a really
61:46
interesting thing
61:46
so humans can tell basically if almost
61:50
all
61:50
vertebrates really are excited or not so
61:53
this was an experiment done by
61:54
scientists they played recordings of
61:55
aroused and non-aroused frogs and
61:57
aroused just means
61:59
not stimulated nervous exactly yeah
62:03
and this was people who spoke different
62:04
languages as well so i think some
62:06
english and some mandarin and some of
62:08
the third language
62:09
and 90 of them could tell which the
62:12
aroused ones were
62:13
and the reason that we think this is is
62:16
because we think there are universal
62:17
vocal elements so when we're excited or
62:20
as it's we speak higher and faster
62:22
and frogs do the same thing so we think
62:25
there are vocal
62:26
signals that are the same even in
62:28
different taxa
62:30
which is veterans that's really
62:31
interesting yeah but frogs are a sort of
62:33
index species for all kinds of the
62:35
health of
62:36
wetlands and everything yeah there are
62:37
tens of thousands of and there's a
62:39
there's a runny
62:40
um whatever it is a brownie form virus
62:44
at the moment that's threatening from
62:45
everywhere yeah
62:50
and also we're running out of ponds yeah
62:54
okay let alone yes natural wetlands the
62:56
good old suburban ones you mean
62:58
yeah there are half as many ponds in the
63:00
uk than there were 50 years ago
63:02
norfolk has lost 8 000 ponds since the
63:04
1950s
63:05
have you known my parents have a pond in
63:06
norfolk does it have rocks
63:09
it does have frogs and frog spawn and
63:11
it's always rather amazing and they try
63:12
and protect the frog spawn from the
63:13
various predators that like to eat it
63:16
but if you combine two ponds into one
63:18
larger pond you have technically
63:19
destroyed a pond
63:21
so is it is it possible there are made
63:23
just one massive lake
63:25
i know it seems unlikely yeah i don't
63:26
think that's what's happened i don't
63:27
think norfolk is now one huge lake
63:30
and no other ponds well certainly when i
63:32
was a boy you definitely i mean
63:33
sort of votes you've done my brother and
63:34
i had nothing better to do would go and
63:36
hunt for sticklebacks and mutes
63:38
and all those sort of creatures well
63:39
every village would have a pond and most
63:41
farms would have a pond because it's
63:42
where
63:52
was it in norfolk where there's that
63:54
myth about a lake where the reflection
63:56
of the moon is in it and the myth was
63:58
that they used to tell
63:59
uh visitors to the area that they've
64:01
been trying to catch that big white
64:02
thing in the middle of the lake for
64:03
years
64:04
and they should have a go because they
64:05
just couldn't get it and it was their
64:07
trick they played was that it's a
64:10
wiltshire
64:17
[Laughter]
64:19
don't confuse norfolk with the language
64:21
with norfolk
64:23
which is n-o-r-f-u-k which is a language
64:25
spoken on norfolk island
64:27
oh yes so just off australia
64:30
in the pacific yeah yeah uh and it's a
64:32
blend of 18th century english and
64:34
tahitian
64:35
what is it don't confuse it do you think
64:39
people are showing up
64:43
that's the wrong accent for on the ball
64:45
city do you know where you can find a
64:47
norfolk accent
64:48
not in norfolk is in parts of new
64:50
england um
64:51
because so when the pilgrim fathers went
64:53
over and say that a lot of them were
64:54
from east angular a lot from norfolk
64:56
and there are certain um quirks of the
64:59
accent in new england accent
65:00
that are only seen in norfolk so i think
65:02
and a few phrases
65:04
one of them was good anya apparently
65:06
yeah good on you
65:08
another one uh was how much did you give
65:10
for it
65:11
as opposed to how much did you pay for
65:13
it which apparently is a
65:14
quintessentially norfolk thing
65:16
and the do you the i don't know what
65:17
that sort of progressive present is
65:18
really peculiar whether
65:20
do you not not as a question but as a as
65:22
an invitation or even a command do you
65:23
sit down
65:24
meaning sit down do you come in do you
65:27
come in oh you must be cold do you come
65:29
in
65:29
that just means come in yeah or there's
65:32
do meaning
65:33
if which is a very strange norfolk thing
65:35
to say you want to come in do you'll get
65:37
cold
65:38
really the doom means if you don't oh my
65:41
god
65:42
yeah yeah my sister's nanny
65:45
was from norfolk and she actually
65:48
enraged
65:50
but you know sort of tease her and
65:51
things like that and
65:53
she said you stopped having to i'll tell
65:54
your father do i'll tell you
65:56
oh really it's very very extraordinary i
65:58
read a really
65:59
funny um blog on the british library
66:01
website so the british library have done
66:02
this amazing thing
66:03
which is they want to preserve dialects
66:05
before they all disappear so they've
66:07
got loads of volunteers over the last
66:08
few years to go and record things that
66:10
they say in their own local dialect
66:12
and they've kept these recordings so you
66:14
can go online it's brilliant um
66:16
go to it it's called the evolving
66:17
english word bank
66:19
but it's really great the only problem
66:21
with it is the kind of people who are
66:22
going around the british library and
66:23
volunteering stuff
66:25
are you can tell when you listen to the
66:26
recordings they're not the kind of
66:27
people who are using the street slang
66:29
of the modern day so you have i listened
66:32
to one it's so good it's this obviously
66:34
really learned uh nervous sounding nerdy
66:37
old man
66:38
says um uh i've got two examples of
66:40
words that like preserved uh that are
66:42
used
66:42
by pupils at a school in oxford where
66:45
i'm from um the first word
66:46
is bear spelled b-a-r-e
66:50
which now means a lot uh and the
66:53
the second word is jokes that is jokes
66:56
which is now used as a word meaning
66:58
fun and then he gave an example he said
67:02
so a bubble in school recently wrote i
67:04
am a seed
67:06
he was learning about germination i am a
67:07
seed and when it's winter i don't sprout
67:10
because there's
67:11
bare snow on the ground but if i wait
67:13
until it's warm everything will be
67:15
jokes it's just if that's what's
67:18
preserved as
67:19
how people are using bear and jokes in
67:22
the future
67:24
there is an amazing book uh which this
67:26
is more just for people listening right
67:27
now um
67:28
susie dent yeah
67:32
yeah she wrote a fantastic book recently
67:34
which was she went to every sort of
67:36
uh she went to hang out with builders
67:38
and and uh people who work in
67:41
uh transport and the current slang being
67:43
used by all of them she documented down
67:45
in this book so
67:46
it's sort of fresh slang preserving a
67:49
time it's a really
67:50
beautiful book for her very important
67:51
because i love books on
67:53
uh thieves cant and uh and those sort of
67:55
uh slangs of the
67:57
17th century and onwards and um i
68:00
i want to just memorialize the great
68:02
dennis norden because you reminded me of
68:04
a story
68:05
he told you you remember the great comic
68:07
writer and who died in his late 90s just
68:09
recently
68:10
he told me this family story when he was
68:12
a at school he had a very good english
68:14
teacher very advanced for his day i mean
68:16
this is
68:16
way back in the 20s and 30s 20s i guess
68:19
um and uh he was he said right we're
68:22
going to do
68:23
words that reinforce meaning uh class
68:26
and then we're going to
68:26
reinforce what's happening you know
68:28
londoner it's a pretty poor ordinary
68:30
school in the
68:31
east end where where dennis grew up and
68:33
he said uh
68:34
i'll i'll illustrate this by telling the
68:36
story of these two road builders navis
68:38
you know
68:39
uh and one of them sees us a poster on
68:41
the wall and it says one man one vote
68:44
because what's that about and his mate
68:46
says whatever means one man one vote
68:48
didn't it he said what
68:49
i don't get it one man one vote how does
68:51
that i don't say that it means
68:52
you got one man he's got one vote
68:56
no i no i still can't one man
68:59
one
68:59
vote
69:07
that's fantastic i'm a good way to seem
69:09
cool in front of your
69:11
pupils telling that story yeah as soon
69:13
as you drop a swear word as a teacher
69:15
you've got their respects well done
69:18
because every generation thinks they've
69:19
invented it yes uh that's the
69:21
extraordinary thing you know the idea
69:22
that one's grandfather was saying
69:24
the f word all the time in the trenches
69:26
yeah which i remember being so shocked
69:28
by and i read all goodbye to all that
69:30
you know the robert graves
69:31
and he he thought he'd heard all the
69:33
swearing he could ever hear at school
69:35
you know in the showers as it were
69:36
after the rugby game and he said the
69:38
first moment he
69:40
he was you know training with with other
69:42
uh cadets and those listening to ncos
69:44
and sergeants
69:45
he just never imagined people would
69:47
swear that much grown-ups
69:49
and uh and of course that's you don't
69:52
see that because yeah
69:52
sanitized version just as you don't see
69:54
them wiping their bottoms away
69:56
we've got better things to do obviously
69:58
but it is important to remember because
70:00
certainly some of my generation thinks
70:02
the first world war as one's
70:03
grandfather's generation obviously most
70:05
people listening are far too young to
70:06
to that they'll be your
70:07
great-grandfathers and possibly even
70:09
great-great-grandfathers
70:10
but uh i knew people in my school there
70:13
were there were people who fought in the
70:14
first world war and to my eternal
70:16
shame i remember this man mr sworden who
70:18
who shook his hands all the time and
70:20
slightly gaped with his mouth and he was
70:22
the brother of the
70:23
headmaster's wife and
70:26
he was we teased him mercilessly and
70:29
then one day one of the masters said
70:31
you do know he won a military cross in
70:34
the first world war he was one of the
70:35
bravest men he will ever meet
70:37
he was destroyed by watching a whole
70:39
trench of his friends
70:40
blown up in front of his eyes i just
70:42
remember thinking oh dear
70:44
i was mocking him and doing he's really
70:46
imitating yeah yeah trembling hands and
70:48
so basically think of them as a very
70:50
extraordinary generation but you don't
70:51
think of them as
70:52
just like us it's so important we do
70:54
think that they did swear they did
70:55
live colorful lives as peter jackson
70:57
shows literally colorful
70:59
yeah sense yeah that was brilliant
71:01
wasn't it peter jackson thing if anyone
71:02
didn't see it
71:03
it's amazing when you see um war
71:05
suddenly with a blue sky
71:06
yes yes so counterintuitive
71:10
you just thought it's going to be mucky
71:11
and dark but yeah
71:13
they they fought on sunny days yeah um
71:16
we should wrap up shortly last night go
71:19
on andy yeah i've got a frog it's a cool
71:21
frog and i didn't want to
71:22
give him a frog have you heard of the
71:24
northern spring peeper nope
71:26
no okay so um it's very cool it's
71:30
it's um it lives in ponds
71:33
and the temperature frequently drops
71:34
below freezing
71:36
problem but the frog hibernates and it
71:39
has a it has evolved a way to stay alive
71:41
while it has frozen um the temperature
71:45
inside it if it gets to minus two or
71:46
three
71:47
celsius the frog can survive because the
71:49
water inside it is
71:50
super cooled so it's still liquid if it
71:52
gets any colder than that
71:54
it's still not a problem the water under
71:56
the frog skin freezes
71:57
and its stomach becomes a solid ball of
71:59
ice
72:00
so about half the water inside the frog
72:03
freezes it can survive for a week like
72:05
this
72:06
and it's because so normally the problem
72:08
is you get ice crystals inside your
72:09
cells and the cells rupture and you die
72:11
that's
72:12
you know what happens yes as soon as the
72:14
ice crystals start
72:16
to form inside the frog the frog's liver
72:18
goes into an emergency
72:20
rapid response action it produces a load
72:22
of glucose and it's just
72:23
glittering yeah yeah it spreads it
72:25
throughout the body and it prevents the
72:27
crystals forming in the cells
72:28
but the glucose levels in its core
72:30
organs shoot up 50 times as much
72:32
wow as soon as the first ice crystal
72:34
forms the frog liver goes ah we're
72:35
freezing
72:36
react wonder if you get an alcoholic
72:38
frog who's got liver damage whether it's
72:40
less good incipient diabetes as well
72:45
wow well i'll i'll i mean i've got a
72:47
story to tell about a frog and
72:49
if you're because it's really not very
72:51
sound um
72:54
there's a librarian who's busy and she
72:56
uh
72:57
hen comes in into the library um and
73:00
goes
73:01
and uh my brain thinks okay and grabs a
73:04
book and gives it to him
73:05
and and the hen goes off and and then
73:07
the hen comes back
73:08
really quite you know a few hours later
73:10
and goes
73:12
because there's three books and two
73:13
under one wing and one under the other
73:15
and
73:15
off goes the hen and then the hen comes
73:17
back and goes
73:19
and dumps the three books that had been
73:21
given and so she gives another six book
73:23
and it's lunch time in the library i
73:25
think i've got to see this extraordinary
73:26
literary hen
73:27
um and uh follows it down the street
73:30
down little alleyways and then
73:31
um upper into a door and the door's left
73:34
open and so the librarian
73:36
watches the hen with these books tucked
73:37
under its wing going all the way up to
73:39
the top of the stairs and
73:40
into a room doors closed but the
73:42
librarian kneels down and looks through
73:44
the keyhole
73:45
and there on the bed is a frog with a
73:47
little spotty bandage around its
73:49
forehead and a thermometer in its
73:51
mouth and the hen takes the moderator
73:53
reads it and then
73:54
hands the book to the frog and the frog
73:56
says read it
74:02
[Laughter]

an ages out of the year's news so we've

00:55
is that true we've also got some sports
00:59
news for you sports fans out there

and now for the weather queensland's
01:09

01:59
[Music]
02:06
hello and welcome to another episode of
02:10
no such thing as a fish
02:11
a weekly podcast this week coming to you
02:13
from our book of the year 2018 tour
02:16
live in brighton
02:21
my name is dan schreiber and i'm sitting
02:23
here with anna chazinski
02:25
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
02:27
and once again we have gathered around
02:29
the microphones with our four favorite
02:30
facts from the last seven days
02:32
and in no particular order here we go
02:36
starting with fact number one and that's
02:38
my fact this week
02:39
my fact is australia's first police
02:42
force was made up
02:43
of australia's 12 best behaved convicts
02:49
well it's weird you didn't do this fact
02:51
when we actually were in australia then
02:53
yeah and it's weird that we hope to go
02:55
back again
02:57
so this is because when they when they
02:59
got there the the first fleets that went
03:01
out to australia
03:02
they were very under prepared they they
03:03
barely brought any agricultural
03:05
equipment they they sort of arrived and
03:07
just went okay
03:08
we just need to make two so they had a
03:10
few people like the royal navy who are
03:11
out there
03:12
the british royal navy who were trying
03:13
to police a few things but they that
03:15
wasn't their job and that's not what
03:16
they were doing
03:17
so they said we need a police force and
03:18
they realized we have no police
03:20
so they looked around and went okay who
03:22
are the best behaved convicts that we've
03:24
got here they found these 12 people and
03:26
they're like would you
03:27
be the you know the police and they were
03:28
like yeah of course
03:31
it's a dream what what how do they
03:32
define best behaved i don't know how you
03:34
spot the 12 best behaved people in
03:36
society out of all of them
03:37
i guess maybe they might be looking at
03:39
the crimes that they were
03:40
sent over for because the criminals that
03:42
got sent over was for very basic things
03:44
as we know is for stealing a bit of
03:45
bread
03:46
or you know um you know urinating on the
03:49
streets
03:49
well there are there are a lot of
03:50
different things you can send foreigners
03:52
i made up the urinating on the streets
03:54
one but i imagine that might have been a
03:55
thing so you could get sent there for
03:56
recommending that politicians get paid
04:00
no no what you could get sent there for
04:03
stealing fish
04:04
um for starting a union um there was in
04:07
1843
04:08
a guy called james prido was transported
04:10
for bestiality with a donkey
04:13
uh and in 1850 lieutenant robert gates
04:16
was sent to australia for striking
04:17
queen victoria with a cane whoa wow
04:22
uh i agree with that one
04:26
with him with him doing it with him
04:27
being sent away with him being sent to
04:29
australia
04:29
right okay actually there were quite a
04:31
lot of bestialities
04:32
there's a little sorry can i just
04:33
clarify i was not talking about the
04:34
bestiality one i was talking about
04:36
you don't need to feel bad about it i
04:38
don't feel bad about it there's nothing
04:39
to feel bad about
04:40
okay um no there were there's a
04:44
the australian government actually has a
04:45
list of all the crimes that people were
04:47
transported for so i was reading through
04:49
this list
04:49
and um there are 13 for bestiality but
04:52
there are some that are really weird so
04:54
one is bad notes i don't know what does
04:56
that mean
04:57
27 people for bad notes counterfeiting
04:59
money yeah
05:00
that was counterfeiting was a separate
05:01
one weirdly um i also learned a new word
05:04
it said that um about 40 people were
05:06
done for hamasakin
05:08
which i've never heard of sucking yeah
05:11
do you guys know that word no so i think
05:13
this must have just gone out of views it
05:14
means to break into someone's house and
05:16
assault them with the intention of
05:17
assaulting them
05:18
and it's different to students sorry
05:20
assault them with the intention of
05:21
assaulting them
05:23
sorry to break into someone's house with
05:25
the intention of assaulting someone
05:27
and then assault them as opposed to stoo
05:29
threef
05:30
which people were also sent for what
05:32
yeah it's two three
05:34
these are just words that i'd never
05:35
heard do we know what that is yeah
05:37
that's breaking into someone's house
05:38
without the intention of assaulting
05:39
someone but someone pops up so you have
05:41
to assault them anyway
05:45
oh it's really hard to prove one way or
05:46
the other whether you were
05:48
not in a way you need the victim to go
05:52
it was my fault really for popping up
05:56
there's some very specific ones though
05:58
so it really goes down to
06:00
detail especially with theft there was
06:02
theft of a hairbrush one person
06:04
got sent to australia for that theft of
06:07
six chickens
06:08
17 people 17 separate people stole six
06:11
chickens
06:12
um theft of bacon theft of shovels
06:15
people are stealing left right and
06:16
center and yeah they're all getting sent
06:18
away
06:19
so one thing that happened when you
06:20
boarded the transport ships was you got
06:22
given
06:22
a bag of cloth if you were a woman so
06:26
uh elizabeth frye who's the social
06:28
reformer she's on um banknotes now
06:30
uh she's on the five pound note is she
06:31
on the current five pound note i think
06:33
she is anyone
06:34
no no all right not according to that
06:36
one man who i'm gonna trust
06:38
completely someone check a five pound
06:42
note surely someone has a five pound i
06:44
think is that about she definitely has
06:45
been on the phone
06:46
but anyway she had this uh kind of
06:48
social program going which was if you're
06:50
a woman being transported to australia
06:52
as you boarded she or her
06:53
representatives uh would give you a bag
06:56
and it contained lots of scraps of cloth
06:57
and needles and thread
06:59
and the idea was that you could make a
07:01
quilt on your way over
07:02
and then sell it when you got there to
07:04
give yourself a tiny financial start
07:06
but everyone else has also got a quilt
07:08
because they've also been on the boat
07:10
you want to really diversify don't you
07:13
you're just quilt swapping it's an
07:14
entire society of quilt swapping
07:17
which was a separate offense you could
07:19
be sent to a trainer for actually
07:22
one thing i really love about that is um
07:24
so you you have badly behaved in the
07:26
in britain and you got sent to australia
07:29
but if you were badly behaved in
07:30
australia then they'd send you even
07:32
further to norfolk island
07:34
so you go to one more island and i want
07:36
to know what happens if you're badly
07:37
behaved in norfolk island what happens
07:39
then
07:40
back to britain you're going round and
07:42
round
07:43
yeah north carolina was very bad wasn't
07:45
it in fact the
07:46
i think people used to on norfolk island
07:48
try and commit other crimes because what
07:50
you would get is a death penalty and for
07:51
that you get sent back to australia and
07:53
you'd be on death row and they thought
07:54
that's way better than this terrible
07:55
norfolk island place
07:56
wow have you heard of the cascades
07:58
female factory
08:00
no so this was somewhere where again it
08:02
was uh
08:03
so i think most of the people who were
08:05
transported were men it was
08:06
maybe 80 but uh the cascades female
08:09
factory was a kind of
08:10
workhouse for a female convicts when
08:12
they were sent over it was a kind of
08:13
distillery prison and when they were in
08:16
there they weren't allowed to
08:17
speak to men these women but they did
08:20
devise a scheme where they bribed a
08:22
corrupt
08:22
water and i swear to god this is what
08:25
the source i have says
08:26
it says they smuggled love letters to
08:28
the men they wanted to communicate with
08:30
inside chickens
08:33
now we know why they were stealing all
08:35
those chickens
08:38
they smuggled love letters inside
08:39
chickens yeah
08:41
i didn't say whether they were living
08:41
chickens or dead chickens or where
08:44
inside
08:45
i think it goes in the in the bit where
08:47
the egg comes out
08:48
okay not through the beak or under the
08:52
wing
08:54
these guys in this factory um they
08:55
famously um protested
08:57
in 1832 and the way that they did that
09:00
is the governor of van diemen's land
09:01
which is now tasmania came along
09:03
and turning right around and at one
09:06
impulse they pulled up their clothes
09:08
showing their naked posteriors which
09:10
they simultaneously smacked with their
09:12
hands
09:12
making a loud and not very musical noise
09:16
[Laughter]
09:18
and on another occasion some dozen or 20
09:21
women
09:22
seized the governor took off his
09:24
trousers and deliberately endeavored to
09:27
deprive him of his manhood
09:30
[Music]
09:32
that's not what you want now that what
09:33
happened to the chickens doesn't sound
09:34
so bad doesn't it
09:37
people always think that um i think the
09:39
people that were sent over to australia
09:41
though were
09:42
kind of from the lowest to the low in
09:43
society like the really lower class
09:45
working classes
09:46
but it was a whole range of people it's
09:48
basically anyone unwanted
09:49
in britain so there was reading a good
09:52
um
09:52
article by thomas connealy you know the
09:54
australian author who was describing the
09:56
kind of people that would go
09:57
and he was saying it was a lot of
09:58
members of the gentry in the bourgeoisie
10:01
but people who sort of had gambling
10:03
debts or who'd got themselves into
10:04
trouble or
10:05
he said bluff english lads who weren't
10:07
particularly good academically or who
10:09
had impregnated the maid
10:10
and then you've got to go do you know
10:13
just because
10:14
um so ned kelly is obviously relevant to
10:16
this
10:18
so this police force was created and the
10:19
police became quite corrupt and hated
10:21
and then you got these rebels in
10:22
australia
10:23
who are kind of hero villains and ned
10:25
kelly is the main one
10:27
but i didn't know that the world's first
10:29
feature-length film
10:30
was the kelly gang so it was the story
10:32
of the kelly gang it was made in 1906
10:35
and it was banned almost immediately
10:37
because it was shown in australia in
10:38
cinemas it was super successful
10:40
and then people started committing kind
10:42
of imitation crime so a bunch of kids
10:44
went and
10:44
held up a photography warehouse i think
10:47
um and
10:48
stole a bunch of stuff from it and held
10:50
up some school children at gunpoint
10:51
and yeah what they can talk it's all
10:54
right everyone was fine
10:55
so yeah they cancelled it but it was
10:57
really successful and it used to
10:59
the reviewers got kind of annoyed about
11:00
it because the way they did
11:02
films in those days was people went to
11:04
the cinema and they showed the film
11:05
and they also had a lecturer standing by
11:07
the side of it explaining the action as
11:09
it happened because
11:10
obviously no sound and then they had
11:12
actors behind the screen
11:14
who were giving it the dialogue so
11:16
really and apparently the kelly
11:18
dialogue and sound effects were so loud
11:20
that it really upset people who are used
11:22
to quite silent films
11:23
so there was something called the kelly
11:25
bellograph which reviewers referred to
11:27
which was going to the cinema to see the
11:28
ned kelly film
11:29
and you'd just like be deafened by these
11:32
thunder claps that they were doing
11:33
behind the
11:34
screen i love the idea of a lecturer
11:37
just by the side who's just filling you
11:39
in on who everyone is every everything
11:42
for any marvel superhero film i would
11:44
like that
11:47
just why are they all trying to get the
11:49
rocks
11:49
[Laughter]
11:53
i'm just speaking of famous australian
11:55
convicts um from
11:56
from that period so ned kelly more an
11:58
outlaw than a than a convict initially
12:00
um there was a guy called moondyne joe
12:03
moondyne was the place he was from
12:04
and this guy um he'd arrived um
12:08
with the boats um i don't think it was
12:09
the very first fleet but
12:11
he uh he kind of served his sentence
12:12
there and he was let free
12:14
and he so they must have sorted out that
12:16
system that i
12:17
said they had a problem with earlier and
12:19
um he started doing things like branding
12:21
cows for himself and keeping them so he
12:23
got arrested
12:24
and put back in prison but he escaped so
12:26
then he got arrested again and put back
12:27
in prison and then he escaped
12:29
and then he got arrested again and he
12:30
just kept escaping and there was nothing
12:32
that they could do
12:33
so they eventually had to build him his
12:35
own custom cell
12:36
just completely on their own and they
12:37
said to him that if he escaped that
12:39
or would be forgiven he's like you go
12:41
free we don't know what to do with you
12:42
if you uh
12:43
escape did he escape you're not gonna
12:45
believe this i forgot to write down the
12:47
answer to that
12:50
when in that story did you realize that
12:52
you didn't have the audience you know
12:53
what i was going
12:53
to escape it was in that moment
12:56
i think i threw in a few more escapes
12:58
this is where my lecturer system will be
12:59
able to sweep in and say
13:01
he did not escape um i looked up modern
13:04
aussie police
13:06
you know it might be interesting to see
13:07
what they're up to so there's a town in
13:09
queensland called
13:10
birdsville and it's amazing so
13:14
it has one police officer and it's
13:16
birdsville and the surrounding region
13:18
and his jurisdiction is the same size
13:20
as the united kingdom whoa it's 93
13:24
000 square miles what does he do
13:27
he drives around he drives a lot
13:31
a lot of mileage expenses yeah so um
13:35
because it's a tiny town it's it's it
13:36
says the the population signs say
13:39
the population is 115 plus or minus 7
13:42
000 because there's a horse race in
13:43
september which brings a lot of tourists
13:46
so almost all year is 115 and then
13:48
september at 7 000.
13:49
um and buzzfeed wrote this huge long
13:51
piece all about him and they interviewed
13:53
him and the piece says
13:54
about birdsville if you want to buy a
13:56
coffee you have one option the
13:58
birdsville bakery
13:59
if you want to visit a restaurant you
14:00
have one option the birdsville hotel
14:02
if you want to see a film or live music
14:04
you are in the wrong town
14:09
well he's not getting re-employed by the
14:10
tourist department
14:13
as i was googling all this stuff and
14:14
google in australia i found something
14:16
that i just want to share even though
14:17
it's not really
14:18
on topic um and it was a news story that
14:21
a 21 year old australian has been
14:23
labeled the unluckiest man in australia
14:26
after he was bitten by a spider on the
14:28
penis for the second time in five months
14:30
[Laughter]
14:33
it was his first visit to a portable
14:34
toilet since his last encounter with his
14:36
wife
14:41
it was the same spot it saw him coming
14:43
and i thought i'm going to get you again
14:49
oh guys oh god this family honestly
14:52
it'll be fine
14:53
it's a one in a billion chance oh the
14:56
worst thing i mean this is so sad but he
14:58
went to the hospital
14:59
and all the nurses remembered him from
15:00
the last time
15:04
should we move on what the aussie police
15:07
these days have to deal with i just
15:08
looked up recent australian crimes
15:10
um and there was one who was a man it
15:13
who
15:13
was a drunk a drunk driver who started
15:16
driving laps around the car park of a
15:18
sydney branch of mcdonald's after they
15:20
refused to sell him 200 chicken nuggets
15:23
at 5am on remembrance day
15:26
he started screaming i want my effing
15:28
nuggets i'm going to f you up
15:30
he then drove around a load of laps
15:32
before changing his mind and asking for
15:34
200 hash browns instead cause it was
15:36
it was breakfast time
15:40
were called but before they um before
15:41
they managed to arrest him the
15:42
perpetrator had demanded a refund but
15:44
was unable to remember what he had
15:46
ordered and wanted a refund for
15:51
not for nothing did those brave men and
15:52
women sacrifice themselves
15:56
anyway we hope to be touring australia
15:57
again uh next year
15:59
uh okay it is time for fact number two
16:01
and that
16:02
is chozinski my fact this week is that
16:05
in the first newspaper crosswords
16:07
the answers did not have to be actual
16:09
words
16:10
uh so this is just this
16:13
so weird thing i was reading the
16:15
telegraph released a book of the history
16:17
of its own crosswords
16:18
and it talks about their first crossword
16:21
which was in 1925
16:23
and i think that was pretty much the
16:24
earliest newspaper cross was in the uk
16:27
uh was in 1925 and you would have clues
16:30
like um you know if i don't know how
16:32
much everyone knows about cryptic
16:33
crosswords i assume everything
16:35
strap in everyone if you've gone anagram
16:39
in a cryptic crossword you'll have a
16:40
word like
16:41
muddle or mix up which shows you it's an
16:43
anagram and then you know you've got to
16:44
mix up the letters
16:46
but in one of these early crosswords uh
16:48
the clue was just
16:49
a muddled life and the answer was ilf
16:53
ilfe not a not a real word or
16:59
well surely it's file and you've just
17:00
got it wrong
17:03
otherwise it didn't work another one i
17:04
liked um
17:06
and this really is for the cryptic fan
17:08
so apologies everyone else
17:09
but this has its tail dislocated
17:13
means you take the word this and you
17:15
take the tail of it which is the end
17:17
which is the s and you dislocate it and
17:19
put it on the front
17:20
so the answer was see
17:23
[Laughter]
17:27
there was a moral panic about crosswords
17:29
when they uh
17:31
were first really popular so this the
17:34
first modern crossword was in a new york
17:36
world which was a magazine in 1913 but
17:38
in the 20s they became really popular
17:40
and in 1924 the new york times said that
17:43
they were a sinful waste
17:45
and they said that the utterly futile
17:47
finding of words was a primitive sort of
17:50
mental exercise
17:51
but they added fortunately the question
17:53
of whether the puzzles are beneficial or
17:55
harmful is in no urgent need of an
17:56
answer
17:57
the craze is evidently dying out fast
17:59
and in a few months it will be forgotten
18:02
they also had the libraries of new york
18:05
uh complained
18:06
that people doing crosswords were
18:07
ruining libraries because they were
18:09
coming they were coming in and
18:10
dominating all the dictionaries
18:12
when people who actually wanted to use
18:14
dictionaries were not able to get there
18:16
to use them so they released a statement
18:18
uh saying that the puzzle fans swarmed
18:21
to the dictionaries and encyclopedias so
18:23
as to drive away readers and students
18:25
who need these books in their daily work
18:27
can there be any doubt that the
18:28
library's duty to protect its legitimate
18:30
readers
18:31
and it and it was basically yeah it was
18:33
this is the death of libraries because
18:34
these
18:35
words as we've just learned a dictionary
18:36
is useless to you in
18:38
filling out old crosswords what there
18:41
was
18:42
um a psychologist from columbia
18:44
university who said that crossword
18:45
puzzles and this was around the same
18:46
time he said
18:47
the reason they're so popular is that
18:49
crossword puzzles satisfied
18:50
the 45 fundamental desires of the human
18:53
species
18:55
not all 45 well i looked at
18:59
as a longer list of fundamental desires
19:01
as i could find
19:02
and they included curiosity which i
19:04
think is fair order
19:05
like putting things in order that works
19:07
physical activity
19:09
kind of maybe uh romance
19:13
no right not in any crossword i've
19:15
completed
19:16
no vengeance
19:19
yeah actually yes vengeance as you can
19:22
see yeah i think you're doing it wrong
19:23
and definitely doing the wrong eating
19:27
that's what you do at the end that's why
19:28
they're always on rice paper
19:31
there was apparently people started
19:33
writing into zoos and demanding of the
19:35
zookeepers to know a three-letter word
19:36
which meant a female swan
19:38
and things like that yeah yeah cause
19:39
back in the day i guess it was there was
19:41
no internet to just sort of
19:42
when you've given up exactly so you just
19:44
had to write to a zookeeper yeah
19:46
that reminds me and there was no
19:48
internet as well and there was a news
19:50
story maybe one of you guys found it i
19:51
haven't written it down but it was um
19:53
there was a guy in the uk somewhere and
19:56
he was doing a crossword he was
19:57
he was about 80 years old but he had the
19:59
internet it was about five or ten years
20:00
ago
20:01
and um the question was asian ass
20:05
he decided to look it up on the internet
20:08
oh no
20:10
and he said basically he didn't know
20:12
this kind of thing existed
20:15
although it does rather sound like his
20:16
wife came down and said what are you
20:18
looking at
20:20
frantically going through a thousand
20:21
crosswords to find any
20:24
any clue which might explain it
20:27
there's a i found a crossword that i
20:29
really like um it's actually a bit it's
20:30
an art piece which has been displayed in
20:32
um
20:33
in art galleries and it was lent to
20:35
nuremberg's newest museum
20:36
and it was up there and um a 90 year old
20:39
woman
20:40
went to see it and filled it in
20:43
and it was worth 68 000 pounds and it is
20:46
surely worth more when it's completed
20:48
well her her argument is in that case
20:51
i've got some crossword books to sell
20:53
you
20:57
this one's worth a fortune and it's
21:00
completely
21:03
yeah no she only she only got a couple
21:04
in before someone noticed that she was
21:06
writing on a bit of art on the wall and
21:08
um so yeah so she um she won trouble
21:11
they they raised out her
21:12
contribution to it and um but she has
21:15
claimed
21:16
that she now holds copyright because
21:17
it's a new work she's now a collaborator
21:20
yeah fulfill through all avengers you're
21:21
right yeah
21:23
i like um so uh crossword setters are
21:26
always kind of heroes but
21:28
one of the first ones was arthur wynn i
21:30
think he was the first one who set the
21:32
new york world one
21:33
and the first crossword puzzle he set uh
21:36
to try and convince his publishers this
21:37
is a thing worth doing the newspaper
21:39
publishers
21:40
he the word dove appeared twice so it's
21:43
the first ever crossword you've got the
21:44
entire dictionary and
21:46
non-dictionary apparently at your
21:47
disposal
21:49
and he couldn't think of something that
21:51
wasn't done for that second clue one was
21:53
it the same clue
21:54
no one clue was bird and one was pigeon
22:01
and then the other words were just
22:02
bizarre it had the word nath
22:05
female surf and it also had da as in
22:08
homer simpson
22:09
wh yeah wow it was the original dough
22:12
what was the clue
22:13
uh it was homer simpson's catchphrase
22:24
and he um do you know what he published
22:25
it as it wasn't called a cross word
22:28
oh it was called it was called the word
22:30
cross yeah that was the original at some
22:32
point down the line we went
22:33
better the other way no it wasn't that
22:35
it was a few weeks later
22:37
it was a mess up in the type setting we
22:39
switched it around
22:40
to crossword and the guy
22:41
[Laughter]
22:45
actually just on that um weird words um
22:48
there was
22:48
a um there was a guy called an editor
22:51
called arthur maurice who noticed
22:54
that the words that americans were using
22:56
in the late 1920s
22:57
were a lot shorter and had more vowels
22:59
in them than they were
23:00
before that and he put it down to the
23:03
crossword craze
23:04
basically he's saying if you're writing
23:06
crosswords you need lots of these small
23:07
words
23:08
like do or whatever and actually he
23:09
noticed that more people were using
23:11
words such as abet acute adept
23:13
eek elan eon things like that right so
23:16
it actually changed the way that people
23:17
speak
23:18
before people were saying oh zephyr and
23:20
oh
23:31
i still can't believe they're the
23:32
longest words that your two collective
23:34
minds can come up with consonants
23:36
just love constant and heavy
23:39
please the floor of the world
23:45
don't help her with chris absolutely
23:47
you're not allowed to use chris anthony
23:48
strick
23:53
lots of um setters have their own
23:55
characteristics and they all have their
23:57
own
23:57
uh not powers um but their own idiots
24:00
you really don't understand the marvel
24:02
movies
24:04
i thought there was so little crossword
24:06
action in the latest one i'm tempted not
24:07
to go back
24:08
um there are fewer than 100 professional
24:11
crossword setters in the uk
24:12
uh for obvious reasons it's you know
24:14
it's quite a niche thing to be doing but
24:16
there is one setter called mark bremen
24:18
and this year
24:20
he launched what he said was the hardest
24:22
in the world he estimated
24:24
that it would take two years to complete
24:26
he said i'm not saying that this
24:27
crossword cannot be completed
24:29
because of course it can but nonetheless
24:31
it is fiendishly tough and significantly
24:33
harder than anything i've ever compiled
24:34
before
24:35
based on the feedback of other compilers
24:37
who have seen it or tried it
24:38
mine is about 100 times harder if that
24:40
description is indeed correct
24:42
then it stands to reason that it would
24:44
take the average enthusiast 100 times
24:46
longer to solve it this amounts to 100
24:48
weeks or just over two years
24:50
it was solved within two hours
24:52
[Laughter]
24:55
he hadn't even finished that speech
24:56
[Laughter]
24:59
to be honest i lost faith in him when he
25:01
said it amounts to 100 weeks or just
25:03
over two years
25:06
that's when you know he's got some
25:07
miscalculations going on
25:09
the guy who sold it said um some of the
25:11
clues were definitely tricky but two
25:13
years would be a stretch
25:14
[Laughter]
25:16
just on the question setters uh the new
25:18
york times had quite a fun run
25:19
uh last year of a whole year of um
25:22
celebrity
25:23
question setters so bill clinton wrote a
25:26
crossword for them and my favorite one
25:28
um weird al yankovic wrote one if you
25:30
guys remember weird al yankovic
25:32
yeah he wrote one so um his was mainly
25:35
filled with
25:35
cheese-based puns um so
25:38
he like answers that that were allowed
25:41
with feta
25:42
attraction and a few good men yeah
25:45
but interestingly they set rules to it
25:47
so he was disqualified when he tried to
25:49
get
25:49
a clue in where the answer was fondue
25:51
the right thing and they said
25:53
we have strict cheeses that you're
25:54
allowed to use in this crossword and
25:56
fondue
25:57
is not it's not a cheese it's a style if
25:59
you're doing a cheese crossword
26:01
you have to really stick within the
26:02
cheese category yeah it has to be just
26:04
cheese i guess within the word yarg
26:07
that's mostly consonants
26:12
didn't know you were still playing that
26:13
game i'm going to be playing it
26:15
all the way home it is time for fact
26:20
number three
26:20
and that is andy my fact is that in the
26:23
german renaissance it was briefly
26:24
fashionable for women to have themselves
26:26
painted as a biblical character halfway
26:28
through decapitating a man
26:31
so so there's this biblical story
26:35
which is of judith and halophanies i
26:38
think that's how it's pronounced
26:40
but he's dead so it doesn't matter um
26:43
there's a biblical story of judith and
26:45
holophonies and uh holophones is a very
26:47
brutal general
26:48
who is about to destroy judas judith's
26:51
home city
26:52
and uh he's outside the city she is a
26:54
widow and he lets her into his tent
26:57
because he fancies her basically and she
26:59
she comes in
27:00
and she gets him drunk he passes out and
27:03
she decapitates him
27:04
and she then takes the head away in a
27:06
basket
27:07
so she's quite a heroic figure uh this
27:10
is old testament stuff obviously
27:13
um and there was a there was an artist
27:15
in the german renaissance called
27:17
cranach lucas cranach the elder and he
27:20
painted eight different versions of this
27:22
scene so loads of artists have painted
27:23
it caravaggio did it
27:24
uh dozens and dozens of artists have
27:25
painted it over the centuries but
27:27
there are at least eight different judas
27:29
that he painted and they're all wearing
27:30
modern dress and they've all got
27:32
completely different looks and we now
27:34
believe that several different women in
27:36
the saxon court commissioned paintings
27:38
of themselves
27:39
halfway through decapitating a man
27:41
that's pretty amazing and we should
27:42
clarify when you say modern dress you
27:43
mean
27:44
the modern dress of the time no no no no
27:46
i mean they were in modern 21st century
27:48
power business suits
27:52
it does it speaks to sort of a
27:54
burgeoning
27:55
angry feminism doesn't it that women
27:57
have suddenly gone god i'm allowed to be
27:58
painted decapitating somebody
28:00
brilliant um and this just for um
28:03
anyone who thinks they don't recognize
28:05
this from the bible it's not in the
28:07
protestant version of the old testament
28:09
that people use it is in the catholic
28:10
version
28:11
and most people think that it's i mean
28:13
what they think of the whole bible i
28:15
don't know but
28:16
everyone knows that this is
28:17
non-historical and some people have
28:19
called it the first historical novel
28:22
because it's so obviously not true
28:23
because there's a lot of anachronisms
28:25
and
28:25
you know nebuchadnezzar's in here she's
28:28
wearing a wristwatch at one point
28:30
it doesn't stack up a 747 flew over here
28:34
this is implausible did you know just
28:38
speaking of fashion as an art
28:39
the fashion in art for painting mary
28:41
magdalene covered in hair from head to
28:43
toe
28:44
and it's this is so weird like a bigfoot
28:47
yep
28:48
she looks like a yeti and this is a
28:51
trend
28:52
in medieval art depictions of mary
28:53
magdalene are covered in hair
28:55
and it's because um she was sort of
28:58
often referred to as having very long
29:00
hair
29:00
and it sort of covered her genitals
29:02
sometimes in art
29:03
and it seemed to grow out of that in
29:05
some versions of the telling of her
29:07
story
29:08
it was that after jesus died then she
29:10
became a desert hermit and repented of
29:11
her prostitution and stuff
29:13
and she stopped caring about her
29:15
appearance at all so all of her clothes
29:17
fell off
29:18
eventually and then as sort of a mercy
29:20
god covered her in hair
29:22
and there are these paintings of her all
29:24
over medieval art and she looks like a
29:25
yeti i don't know how to
29:27
she's got she's covered in hair head to
29:28
toe but with a little
29:30
space a face of skin that's so weird
29:33
and also they used to paint moses with
29:35
horns didn't they they just
29:37
did and they reckoned that that was
29:38
maybe a mistranslation
29:41
or something yeah they thought it was a
29:43
bible mistranslation
29:44
um because it was uh yeah it was
29:47
describing him coming down the mountains
29:48
and so they were doing it purely out of
29:50
we think that this is what was written
29:52
so there's a word that is karen
29:54
like the name karen uh and in hebrew it
29:56
can either mean horn or ray of light so
29:58
he came down with a ray of light in the
30:00
bible
30:01
but some guy misread it and just went i
30:03
probably had horns
30:05
there is a painter called daphne todd
30:07
and she is a modern portrait painter
30:09
and she revealed a few years ago that
30:10
she was commissioned to paint someone
30:12
who was extremely rude and extremely
30:13
uncooperative all the way through the
30:15
portrait painting process
30:16
and as a result she has given that man a
30:19
pair of horns in the painting
30:20
and then painted over it with his hair
30:24
but in 50 or 100 years time it's going
30:27
to be revealed that this guy has blocks
30:29
in the painting
30:30
um so other fashions from from
30:33
a renaissance time um the chopin or
30:35
chopin
30:36
um it was a platform shoe um that they
30:38
wore especially around venice
30:40
and the idea was you wore it over your
30:42
shoes because the
30:43
the ground was terrible there's loads of
30:45
poo around and loads of mud and stuff
30:46
like that you don't want it on your
30:47
shoes you don't want it on your dress
30:49
and so they got these nice high
30:50
platforms um but then it kind of turned
30:53
out that
30:53
the higher you got the better your
30:55
status was and they got higher and
30:57
higher and higher and higher and higher
30:59
and eventually they were getting
31:01
examples that were over
31:02
20 inches high platform shoes in venice
31:06
so just to put that into context that
31:08
would put anna if you wore them
31:10
three inches taller than lebron james
31:12
the basketball player
31:16
but it's so hard to run up and down a
31:18
basketball court in 20
31:20
years okay it is time for our final fact
31:23
of the show and that
31:24
is james okay my fact this week is that
31:27
mice
31:28
can't hear their own footsteps
31:32
now is this because they are quite deaf
31:35
or because they walk very quietly
31:36
it's because they're selectively deaf so
31:39
there is a noise
31:40
that happens when a mouse walks and
31:44
in theory it could hear it but its brain
31:46
just goes no i'm not gonna listen to
31:47
that
31:48
and it just turns it off and it could be
31:49
that this is true of actually all
31:51
animals or maybe of humans as well like
31:52
if you walk down the street
31:54
you don't really notice your own
31:55
footsteps but let's say you're walking
31:57
on
31:58
some gravel or some leaves or something
32:00
you might hear it
32:01
and this is a new study that's recently
32:03
been done um by
32:04
janani sundarajan and richard mooney at
32:07
duke school of medicine
32:09
and what they did was they put little
32:11
buttons on the bottom
32:13
of a mouse's feet uh-huh and so
32:16
as it walked along it just made little
32:20
people made little beeping noise like
32:22
you know that a movie big when he's on
32:24
the um
32:25
on the keyboard isn't it like that but
32:27
it was the same note every time
32:29
and they checked the brain of the mouse
32:30
and they realized that it could hear
32:32
this you know it's reacting to this
32:34
noise but then as it went on after a
32:35
week or two
32:36
it wasn't reacting to it anymore i bet
32:38
the other mice were still reacting
32:42
and what they found was is that
32:44
basically the mice um
32:46
had been trained to just not listen to
32:48
the sound anymore and it's just
32:49
natural in their brains and the ones
32:52
which had got used to this sound
32:54
they were much better than other mice at
32:56
reacting to predators
32:58
so if you had like a cat paw come in to
33:00
get them the ones who couldn't hear
33:02
their own footsteps
33:03
could get out of there but the ones who
33:04
could hear them would put off they
33:06
reckon that this maybe
33:07
is why humans possibly and other animals
33:10
can't hear your own footsteps yeah
33:12
i guess the human brain is very good at
33:14
zoning stuff out that is
33:15
repeated right yeah so if you're a heavy
33:17
breather for instance you wouldn't
33:19
necessarily know you were a heavy
33:20
breather everyone else would know that
33:21
you were doing it but you wouldn't
33:22
necessarily know
33:23
i mean the people the peop the people
33:24
you were phoning up would know wouldn't
33:26
they
33:26
yeah i mean like you would know if you
33:28
were a heavy breather wouldn't you
33:30
and you would know yeah yeah yeah what
33:33
do you say sorry what are you saying
33:36
you're an extremely heavy breather i am
33:38
not a heavy breather
33:39
we don't need to go into it now normal
33:41
breather
33:42
you're fine it's very distracting in the
33:44
office
33:44
[Laughter]
33:49
but yeah i think
33:53
can i just ask for the um just to make
33:55
sure i get this clear so
33:56
it's by cancelling out the noise it
33:59
means that every other dangerous noise
34:00
is amplified and they don't
34:02
cross fire with their own noise not
34:03
amplified so much as you just easier to
34:05
hear because
34:06
you're not being constantly annoyed by
34:07
the sound of your own footsteps
34:09
yes so this is the thing with
34:10
conversation in humans as in um
34:13
when you're talk is what it's why it's
34:15
quite tricky to develop really good
34:16
kind of artificially intelligent hearing
34:18
implants is because
34:20
uh listening to the human brain has an
34:22
amazing ability to identify a voice
34:24
in a lot of other noise yeah yeah yeah
34:28
but it does get harder when you've got a
34:29
human voice against the background
34:30
of a lot of other human voices so this
34:32
gets called the cocktail party problem
34:34
where it's quite hard to focus on an
34:36
individual voice and
34:37
which gets worse with age as we know so
34:39
you know once one's parents will
34:41
uh not be able to be in a loud room but
34:43
the cocktail party problem
34:44
is it does feel like you've just stopped
34:46
them from being in loud rooms
34:48
you wouldn't enjoy it andy's in there
34:51
he's breathing
34:56
you can see bins and things go flying
34:58
past with my huge breath
35:02
and the cocktail party effects was
35:05
described by someone called colin cherry
35:07
i think it was in the 50s or the 60s
35:09
possibly the 60s um and the way he
35:11
tested it was
35:12
he played two sentences to the study
35:14
participants one in one ear and one in
35:16
the other ear
35:17
and he told them to listen to only one
35:18
of them so he told them which one to
35:20
listen to
35:20
and then he'd ask them questions about
35:22
each sentence and it was the case that
35:24
the one they hadn't been told to listen
35:25
to they couldn't really tell him
35:26
anything about it
35:28
at to the extent that if the other voice
35:30
the other sentence in their ear
35:31
was in a different language they very
35:33
often hadn't even noticed that
35:35
uh so that's how good we are at kind of
35:37
you know zoning out the stuff we're not
35:39
supposed to
35:40
be listening to yeah and it's also
35:42
called that because i think this is
35:44
right that
35:44
you hear if someone says your name you
35:46
kind of just hear that really really
35:48
loud
35:48
yeah if you're in a cocktail party or in
35:51
fact very bad advice for a cocktail
35:52
party
35:53
a discovery that was made recently if
35:55
someone speaks who
35:56
you love then you'll hear them so they
35:59
did this study
36:00
where they expose you to a lot of
36:01
peripheral sound and then they
36:03
have someone they don't know say
36:04
something to them and then they have
36:06
their spouse say something to them and
36:08
people are much much better
36:09
at understanding and hearing what their
36:11
spouses said hang on sorry do we know
36:13
what what the reason for that is is it
36:14
just
36:15
they haven't speculated it's quite new
36:16
but i revolutionary
36:18
maybe yeah that makes a lot of sense
36:20
because they're the one you want to
36:21
reproduce with
36:22
going home
36:27
it's important to get that message when
36:28
it comes to you
36:32
plants can hear themselves being eaten
36:35
what's that dogs yeah hang on what
36:39
do you think about that halfway through
36:40
your next salad
36:42
they can sense the vibrations caused by
36:45
a
36:45
for example a caterpillar eating their
36:47
leaves yeah so i think for instance
36:48
let's say there's a plant being eaten by
36:50
a caterpillar
36:50
they can sense it as you say and then
36:52
they'll give off some um defense
36:54
exactly so scientists tested this by
36:56
putting some caterpillars on a cabbage
36:58
plant
36:59
they recorded the sounds of the
37:00
caterpillars going
37:02
and then they played that was a really
37:08
good impression
37:10
i think you're going to be on the
37:11
audiobook of the very hungry caterpillar
37:15
but what's with the caterpillar's
37:17
breathing problem
37:22
is is this the very asthmatic
37:24
caterpillar
37:26
it's the very sexy caterpillar
37:28
[Laughter]
37:31
did you get to the end of that no
37:34
they put the caterpillars on a cabbage
37:36
plant they recorded the sounds of their
37:37
meeting
37:38
and then they played the vibrations back
37:40
to a group of plants who were not
37:41
actually being eaten by caterpillars and
37:44
those plants
37:45
heard those vibrations and they thought
37:47
i'm being eaten wow yeah so i don't know
37:49
if your actual
37:50
salad will be able to detect and
37:54
protect itself i think the salad is
37:56
generally dead
37:57
yeah yeah although like a carrot for
37:58
instance a carrot often can be alive
38:00
when you eat it and you can see that by
38:01
the fact that if you cut the
38:02
top off and then put it in some water
38:04
it'll grow so yeah that could do
38:06
um i have a fact about the relationship
38:08
between your eyes and your ears
38:09
when you move your eyes uh your eardrums
38:12
move
38:12
too and we don't know why so if you
38:16
sit where you are and you just look
38:17
straight ahead of you and you flick your
38:19
eyes left
38:19
and right okay your eardrums are
38:22
rotating
38:23
with your eyes wow yeah it's re and no
38:26
one knows why and this is this is the
38:28
amazing thing
38:28
the eardrums actually move 10
38:30
milliseconds before
38:32
your eyes so the brain is saying
38:35
they're controlling the eyes the brain
38:37
is saying well they're not controlling
38:38
it the brain's controlling everything
38:39
but the brain says
38:40
i'm going to move the eyes so eardrums
38:43
please get into position
38:57
i reckon james thinks he is
39:02
amazing he's been holding me back my
39:04
whole life
39:06

01:35
[Music]
01:37
hello and welcome to another episode of
01:39
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
01:42
coming to you
01:43
from the qi offices in covent garden my
01:46
name is dan schreiber and i am sitting
01:48
here
01:48
with anna chazinski andrew hunter murray
01:51
and
01:51
james harkin and once again we have
01:54
gathered around the microphones with our
01:55
four
01:56
favorite facts from the last seven days
01:58
and in no particular order
01:59
here we go starting with you
02:03
james okay my fact this week is that
02:05
there is a special language
02:07
in papua new guinea that is only used
02:09
when gathering nuts
02:12
it's very weird yeah so can you only use
02:16
it when
02:17
when gathering now actually picking the
02:19
nut or when you're on your way to pick
02:20
the nut in the general nut picking area
02:23
okay
02:24
um so you can if you try and use it
02:26
outside the area where the trees are
02:28
then there's a worry that mountain
02:30
spirits might come down and investigate
02:31
and then cause problems with the nuts
02:33
okay and basically this is a taboo
02:35
language this is
02:36
relatively common around the world and
02:39
you change your language whenever you're
02:40
doing anything
02:41
as a superstition and eventually it
02:42
becomes an actual
02:44
language or an actual vocabulary of more
02:46
than a thousand words in this case
02:48
and what's the idea that the spirits
02:49
will steal the nuts from you what's the
02:51
fear here
02:52
um so some some normal words that you
02:55
might use like
02:55
say i don't know i'm making these up but
02:58
like wither or
02:59
dry or dead or whatever they might be
03:02
bad for the plants they might be
03:03
unhealthy for the plants
03:04
and so you have to use alternative words
03:07
that wouldn't
03:07
um be generally unhealthy to the plants
03:10
and is this if you were
03:11
um going to be part of the nut gathering
03:14
unit
03:15
would you have to study this language or
03:16
does everyone know this language
03:18
that's a really good point i don't know
03:20
but i imagine they teach it to you it's
03:22
probably not the first thing you learn
03:23
it's probably more like a second
03:25
language yeah i think so it's really
03:27
weird there seem to be two different
03:28
kinds of belief one is that there's a
03:31
spirit called quitomato who can rip
03:33
people apart
03:34
but that's only one group of people
03:36
that's only one social group because
03:37
there are loads of different
03:38
groups all over new guinea and lots of
03:40
them gather the nuts and they travel in
03:42
from the coast to the mountains to get
03:43
to the
03:44
area and the other is that as as you say
03:46
that if you talk about wet things then
03:48
all the nuts you find will be really wet
03:49
and if you if you use words like empty
03:51
or bitter
03:52
same deal but it's two completely
03:54
separate beliefs about why you have to
03:55
use this language as well so then you
03:56
have a euphemism for
03:58
empty or bitter or wet but then that
04:00
starts to mean that so then surely that
04:01
becomes bad luck
04:02
and then you've got to make a new one
04:04
right um so this is a thing called
04:06
perjuration and it happens in
04:07
english as well so for example the word
04:09
for
04:10
the toilet in the 15th century it was
04:12
privy and then
04:14
that was replaced by a euphemism but
04:15
then that which was it was replaced by
04:17
bog house which i didn't know
04:19
that was the polite way you'd say it
04:21
instead of privy because
04:23
and then toilet but then toilet becomes
04:25
rude so then lavatory and now in america
04:27
it's restroom
04:28
but as soon as people really associate
04:30
restroom as soon as that becomes the
04:31
rude word they'll have to think of
04:32
another even more remote so what is it
04:34
in britain then
04:35
i think bathroom people say bathroom to
04:37
be polite don't they yeah
04:38
but it will move on should we make a new
04:40
one quickly now can we not go back to
04:41
bug house
04:42
yeah the privy oh sorry the bog house
04:49
only when you're around the queen in a
04:52
similar vein our word for bear
04:53
in the middle ages uh was taboo because
04:56
so it probably came from ursus
04:58
so you know obviously you have ursa
04:59
major and stuff and that's the latin for
05:01
bear
05:01
but because bears were big scary things
05:03
it was thought to bring bear
05:04
rage upon you if you said their name so
05:06
people would refer to them as the brown
05:08
one or the shaggy one
05:09
and so the word for bear comes from the
05:11
word for brown it's like bro
05:13
and in china um you can't say the word
05:16
tiger in some places
05:17
um so if you're speaking about a
05:19
man-eating tiger you'll use a different
05:20
word
05:21
often referred to as big insect
05:24
there's a massive insect down the road
05:28
i think you'd be more terrified if
05:30
someone said there's a large insect
05:31
behind you and you turned around and it
05:32
was a tiger
05:34
i would say just give them the warning
05:36
straight out so it's to prevent
05:38
it from coming into the village so you
05:39
don't if there's a tiger behind you
05:41
you'd probably say
05:43
but it's if you say big insect then it
05:45
won't hear its name and it won't come
05:46
down
05:48
yeah no it's been summoned so you'll get
05:50
summoned instead loads of big
05:52
insects yeah at least there's no insects
05:55
yeah
05:55
um in papua new guinea so um this
05:58
language
05:59
even though this is language purely for
06:00
picking up nuts the diversity of
06:02
language in papua new guinea is
06:03
extraordinary i think it's the highest
06:04
diversity in the world
06:06
so they have over 800 languages 850
06:09
languages
06:10
and um they have so much this is what's
06:14
crazy population versus the amount of
06:16
languages that they have
06:17
there's this thing called the greenberg
06:19
greenberg's diversity index
06:20
which charts how much diversity language
06:23
is in per country it says papua new
06:24
guinea holds the top spot
06:26
it is so diverse there that the
06:28
probability of two random people
06:30
selected in the country any two random
06:32
people if they were brought to each
06:33
other to talk to each other
06:34
there's a 98.8 percent chance that they
06:37
won't
06:38
speak the same language wow isn't that
06:41
crazy that's a bad speed dating
06:45
yeah so how do you have courts and
06:47
things like that
06:48
how do you have they must have a
06:49
national language of let's say english
06:52
yeah exactly they've got they've
06:53
actually got four official languages in
06:55
papua new guinea
06:56
the fourth being sign language uh as the
06:58
official language but that's exactly
07:00
what it is everyone speaks a main
07:01
language and then these are all
07:03
other languages are slowly going extinct
07:05
with one or two speakers left
07:06
yeah because they've got english that's
07:08
very widely spoken there and then
07:09
they've got taco piscine haven't they
07:11
which is
07:12
pidgin talk so just put in english which
07:15
is great and i
07:16
i just love all kinds of pigeon english
07:17
or kind of creole when you read them
07:19
because
07:19
it's such a funny warping of what we say
07:22
so the word for broken in taco posin
07:24
is bagarapim which is bugger up from
07:27
bugger up
07:28
that's what you now now say broken um
07:31
mt tin is a person who talks nonsense
07:34
you know like an
07:35
empty person like an empty vessel an
07:37
empty vessel exactly
07:38
sock man is a sophisticated person
07:42
man why james might know this oh wow
07:46
james you always wear silk socks is that
07:47
it
07:49
it you always say there's a phrase that
07:51
you used to say when you're growing up
07:52
to say
07:53
that someone's a bit well look at you
07:55
with your matching shoes exactly
07:59
same thing man means person with shoes
08:02
and socks
08:02
oh look at you look at here matching
08:05
shoes
08:06
there you go you'd fit right in i didn't
08:08
know that papua new guinea is the second
08:09
largest island in the world
08:11
i didn't know that either massive it
08:13
depends what you count as an island of
08:14
course
08:14
very true yeah if you count eurasia as
08:17
an island
08:18
down to three immediately but sorry it
08:21
doesn't include australia it doesn't
08:22
include it
08:23
after i think it's after greenland yeah
08:25
it's um
08:26
the country is called papua new guinea
08:27
the whole island is called new guinea
08:29
but the western half of it which is part
08:30
of indonesia is papua
08:32
and west papua wow and then you also
08:35
have guinea
08:36
and guinea bissau right and guiana yeah
08:39
absolutely nightmare germany
08:40
[Laughter]
08:42
mixed up um i looked up a couple more
08:46
taboos oh yeah
08:47
so this is an interesting one there's an
08:49
ethiopian language called camberta
08:51
and it's got marital linguistic taboos
08:55
that's quite common isn't it
08:56
yeah so a woman can't use um
08:59
some married women follow this system
09:01
which is called balisha
09:02
and it means that they are not allowed
09:04
to use words that begin with the same
09:06
syllable
09:06
as your father-in-law's name or your
09:08
mother-in-law's name
09:09
so so my mother-in-law is called natalia
09:13
so you wouldn't be able to talk about
09:15
toads
09:17
you wouldn't be able to talk about
09:17
natural attack toads at all you'd have
09:19
nothing to say yeah
09:22
and you'd have to coin a completely
09:23
different word for them i'd just call
09:25
them toadstools
09:26
yeah yeah so it's not such a problem for
09:28
james which is great
09:31
what what um what syllable would you not
09:33
be allowed to use
09:34
um leel leo so you won't be able to talk
09:37
about the northern french city
09:38
[Laughter]
09:42
where is this euro star going to
09:45
you'll see when we get there shouldn't
09:48
have become a train announcer
09:52
yeah that's really cool well there's
09:54
another um kind of
09:56
gender-based specific language i was
09:58
looking at
09:59
in nigeria actually so i guess the thing
10:01
you're talking about is a language
10:02
specific to one thing
10:04
and this is a language in the ubang
10:06
community in nigeria
10:07
and they have different languages for
10:09
men and women and they say they think
10:11
they're the only
10:12
tribe in the world who has this that
10:14
would be even worse for speed dating
10:18
i don't know how it works and it's also
10:20
bizarre because
10:21
when people are born then you get raised
10:23
by your mother and your sisters and
10:24
generally women
10:25
so everyone speaks the women's language
10:27
but then apparently there was an
10:28
interview with one of the tribal leaders
10:30
who said that as boys start reaching
10:32
adolescence they just start speaking the
10:34
male language
10:35
wow and it is completely different i
10:37
mean the words are utterly different and
10:39
he's like
10:39
if boys don't start speaking the male
10:41
language then we consider them a bit
10:43
abnormal
10:44
so it was a adolescence is that you're
10:46
like i've got to sort of memorize
10:48
secretly this language i'm supposed to
10:50
miraculously start speaking
10:51
you talk about toxic masculinity in this
10:53
country don't we but yeah that is pretty
10:55
bad
10:55
you know sometimes when you're at a
10:56
restaurant and you see a couple who just
10:59
don't speak to each other the whole meal
11:00
yeah i presume every restaurant is like
11:03
that
11:03
[Laughter]
11:05
relationships are constantly awkward
11:07
that's so so the so the meals can still
11:09
speak the
11:10
yeah they can understand each other
11:11
they're just not allowed to speak each
11:13
other's language anymore
11:15
no i was reading about a secret language
11:17
that was used in wartime in canada
11:19
and uh it was very cleverly done because
11:22
it was
11:22
it's a secret language in that not many
11:24
people spoke it
11:26
so they were in the canadian army they
11:28
enlisted these native north americans
11:30
um and they were they spoke cree and
11:33
cree was a language that barely anyone
11:35
speaks it's only these
11:36
these people and so what they used to do
11:38
is in between battalions
11:39
they would have cree speakers and any
11:42
messages that they needed to send across
11:43
it was those people who took it so if
11:46
they were caught there was no way of
11:47
getting the information out of them
11:48
because the language barrier was so
11:50
great
11:51
so it's clever yeah but the problem was
11:53
is that cree didn't have
11:54
words for the things that they needed to
11:56
get across so
11:58
things like um they had uh you know
12:01
tanks and machine guns and bombers so a
12:03
machine gun they had to translate into
12:04
their language which is
12:06
little gun that shoots fast or a fighter
12:08
bomber would be um the cree word for
12:10
mosquito
12:11
um because that was you know that was
12:12
the best way of explaining it so yeah
12:14
they had to invent new words and new
12:16
phrases in order to do this
12:17
that's so cool that's interesting
12:19
because there were planes called
12:20
mosquitoes weren't there
12:22
yeah were they the ones that were
12:25
slightly made of wood
12:26
yes they were i'm pretty sure they're
12:29
broken
12:30
yeah or partly wooden frame that's very
12:32
cool
12:33
i have some stuff on gathering nuts
12:37
so don't go gathering hazelnuts on
12:39
september the 21st in birmingham
12:41
why because that is devil's nutting day
12:45
apparently um according to an old
12:48
folklore um
12:49
satan comes out at that time and he
12:51
collects
12:52
his nuts on september 21st so
12:55
you leave it for him to do and where is
12:57
this birmingham uh it's in the west
12:58
midlands basically
12:59
uh and there's an old saying of
13:01
something being dirty
13:02
uh in birmingham you would say it's the
13:04
colour of the devil's nutting bag
13:10
a bit of local slag for you too yeah
13:13
that's going to go down like an absolute
13:14
charm
13:16
coolest kid at the party
13:20
uh just on not gathering it's quite
13:22
dangerous sometimes
13:23
isn't it so if you're gathering big nuts
13:26
then they can fall on you
13:30
you love that is a genuine dead coconut
13:35
i picture nuts on the ground as opposed
13:36
to in the tree so no
13:38
sorry yeah from the tree okay coconuts
13:40
obviously it's not like you're just
13:41
crawling on the ground you keep bumping
13:42
into nuts
13:43
yeah and then um but i like the
13:46
so gathering brazil nuts then foragers
13:49
wear hats
13:50
and they don't collect them on windy
13:51
days and stuff like that but i
13:53
didn't realize that they when they fall
13:55
out of trees they fall from so high that
13:57
they'll bury themselves 30 centimeters
13:58
into the ground
13:59
so when you're not gathering for brazil
14:01
nuts then you're digging up the ground
14:03
to get the nuts out isn't that weird
14:05
because they're quite spiky are they
14:07
brazil nuts in there
14:09
they are on the outside yeah so do you
14:10
reckon they're made like that so that
14:12
they
14:12
it's quite clever if you're a nut hasn't
14:14
it to kind of go directly into the
14:16
ground and not have to get trampled in
14:18
because that's where you want to be in
14:19
the end
14:19
yeah if you're a worm that must be
14:21
terrifying
14:23
if you're a worm going through the soil
14:27
daggers are coming down that'd be
14:29
amazing great slicing your friend in
14:30
half and now you've got two friends
14:33
it's quite nice the only
14:36
species where watching your friend be
14:38
cut in half it's quite nice
14:41
the one french revolution would have
14:42
been really weird wouldn't it
14:44
double the aristocrats
14:47
james bond but the laser comes down it
14:50
just cuts him into two james bond
14:52
snow messes bonds
14:58
[Applause]
15:00
[Music]
15:02
okay there's time for fact number two
15:04
and that is
15:05
anna my fact this week is that the man
15:07
who worked out how to stop
15:09
soft cheese going mouldy came from a
15:11
place
15:12
called mold
15:14
[Laughter]
15:16
so i know just before this um we started
15:19
recording
15:19
we ascertained that it's pronounced mold
15:23
yeah moles is that what you just said
15:24
yeah i think i said mold
15:27
so it's a place called malt it's in
15:29
norway and you probably you sort of say
15:30
it mulder
15:31
but it's still got the word mold in it i
15:33
mean it is still quite amazing
15:36
this is a great fact written down yeah
15:39
it looks pretty
15:40
good um as long as you spell mold the
15:41
american way so if you're if you're
15:43
reading this podcast then great
15:48
so this was a norwegian cheese maker he
15:49
was called olaf kavli
15:51
and yeah he grew up in this municipality
15:53
in norway
15:54
and it was he was actually really old
15:57
when he invented primula which is that
15:59
do you laughing because i pronounced it
16:00
old not older
16:05
he ended up inventing primula which is
16:08
you know that cheese that you see that
16:09
comes in a squeezy cheese that's
16:10
interesting i always pronounce that
16:11
primula
16:12
same i think it probably is pronounced
16:14
primula and in fact it's named after
16:15
primroses because he thought the
16:17
beautiful yellow colour was reminded him
16:19
of the beautiful yellow of a yellow
16:20
primrose
16:21
so premiere that makes a lot more sense
16:23
um anyway yeah he he discovered this and
16:25
then he got really rich
16:27
and he i quite like this because it
16:29
gives us all hope
16:30
for our future later years of being
16:33
finally successful
16:34
rather than hanging out with you dorks
16:36
um because he
16:38
was in his 60s when he came up with this
16:40
he just ran this delicatessen
16:42
i mean it's not good for your next 30
16:44
years
16:46
30 years of hanging around with those
16:47
dogs until you like to
16:51
you're right i'm not gonna last that
16:52
long
16:54
he actually lived to a hundred lived in
16:55
1958.
16:57
cool and also a good thing to know about
16:59
premula and i'm actually going to start
17:00
buying it
17:01
is that all well now that you
17:05
um but all the profits go to charity go
17:08
to good causes because
17:09
he was a massive philanthropist and then
17:11
his son was and didn't have any
17:13
offspring and so
17:14
set up the company which is the i think
17:16
it's called the catholic trust and it's
17:18
legally required to donate all its
17:20
profits to
17:21
scientific humanitarian charitable
17:23
causes but yeah cheese and stopping
17:25
cheese going mouldy it's been a problem
17:26
for
17:27
centuries um that just on the place
17:29
called mulder
17:31
um its name comes from the word mold
17:35
without an e on the end it's a plural
17:37
form of that
17:38
place and the word mold in norwegian
17:41
means either fertile soil
17:43
skull or mold what
17:46
it might it might actually be mine
17:49
so that i was looking up moldy cheeses
17:52
or soft cheeses so there's a cheese
17:53
called
17:54
cougar gold which is made in washington
17:56
state university
17:57
and this is really weird so it's canned
18:01
soft cheese but it the it's canned when
18:04
it's still
18:04
in the curd form so it develops as it
18:08
ages as in it's not
18:09
once it's gone into the can it doesn't
18:10
stay the same yeah wow so
18:12
the lactic acid bacteria inside they
18:14
don't need oxygen so the flavor keeps
18:16
developing
18:17
and there are fans who aged their cans
18:19
for years and years before opening them
18:20
and it's just cuts
18:22
i think it goes in as curd no way
18:26
nobody yeah no yeah it was too good i
18:29
just had to sit back in them
18:32
and just stare in awe
18:35
i could now looking back when he said
18:40
years
18:42
i said i'm done
18:45
um yeah that's that's really cool so
18:47
there's no use by date on it presumably
18:49
i i maybe there is for safety as then
18:50
maybe after a certain number of years it
18:52
does go off but i'm not sure
18:54
so when processed cheese came about
18:56
which this is an example of then
18:58
it was very controversial because it
19:00
threatened the
19:01
normal cheese market and there were
19:03
actually a lot of cheese makers in
19:05
america who said it should be called
19:07
embalmed
19:07
cheese wow which it was almost named
19:10
but i hadn't quite realized that it's
19:12
just a blend of lots of other cheeses
19:14
which i think most people will but like
19:16
offcuts of the cheese making process so
19:18
for instance um i think american cheese
19:21
you know your classic american processed
19:23
cheese
19:24
is a combination of bits of cheddar
19:27
colby provolone things like that that's
19:30
incredible
19:30
and then they add sodium phosphate which
19:32
kind of makes it all go
19:34
goopy yeah and that but quite easy to
19:37
slice
19:38
and that was invented american cheese by
19:39
a canadian of course
19:41
who is james lewis craft of craft fame
19:44
craft cheese
19:46
he was a canadian and he kind of came up
19:48
with this idea
19:49
of um kind of shredding it and then
19:52
adding this stuff which makes it kind of
19:54
cut yeah so it's kind of a franken
19:56
cheese yeah
19:57
and they pasteurize it so it doesn't
19:59
ripen so it's not it's really not proper
20:01
cheese as we the french might know it by
20:03
the time it's been so for instance
20:05
velveeta has to be
20:06
called pasteurized prepared cheese
20:08
product
20:09
it does did you know that's only since
20:11
the early 90s
20:13
which is when they finally worked out a
20:15
way to make the base
20:16
not real cheese at craft so it was a
20:19
really exciting moment
20:20
because instead of like using just this
20:22
mixture of cheese and then adding this
20:24
sodium phosphate and stuff
20:25
they worked out a way of cracking milk
20:27
which i didn't know was a thing
20:29
but basically this is you add little
20:30
bits of plastic membrane into milk and
20:32
it causes all the milk particles to
20:33
separate
20:34
and it separates out into its milk
20:36
protein lumps
20:37
and it makes this kind of concentrated
20:39
protein and that can be the base for
20:41
their cheese
20:42
and it was at that moment when some
20:43
inspectors went around their factories
20:44
and they went
20:45
guys you're not using cheese anymore i'm
20:47
afraid you have to call it
20:48
cheese products how do they come up with
20:50
this yeah so weird
20:52
i always think the other day i found out
20:54
this is completely off topic but
20:55
um early cars had white tires
20:59
right and the only reason that we have
21:01
tires that are black is because you add
21:03
something called
21:04
i think it's called black carbon which
21:06
is just this tiny bit of weird carbon
21:08
that they managed to get from the
21:09
industrial process and they just thought
21:11
let's just try it with rubber
21:12
and it turned out to make rubber 10 000
21:14
times more solid than
21:16
normal wow but even on that i was like
21:19
how do you even think of that yeah
21:21
are they just trying everything or what
21:23
i can't believe early cars had white
21:25
tires yeah if you see them
21:26
so cool yeah but an absolute nightmare
21:29
to keep clean
21:30
exactly you would just naturally have a
21:32
black tire after a week yeah be as dirty
21:34
as the devil's nuts
21:38
sorry i just checked nutting bag
21:42
don't embarrass yourself in birmingham
21:44
by getting that wrong i'm just thinking
21:45
the difference between your brain and
21:47
mine james is that you're fascinated by
21:49
the fact that
21:50
all these processes go on and i'm still
21:51
busy here going wow there was an actual
21:53
guy called craft
21:54
that was a real person i can't believe
21:56
that
21:58
um so i looked up a bit about food
21:59
preservation have we i don't think we've
22:01
spoken before about
22:02
nicolas appa or appert so he was the man
22:05
who started
22:06
preserving foods by heating it a lot and
22:08
then putting in an
22:09
airtight container so this was in the
22:11
napoleonic wars and it was a massive
22:12
prize on offer from the french army
22:14
to anyone who could work out how to
22:16
safely preserve food and keep it
22:18
for long periods of time because it
22:19
couldn't be done and he invented it and
22:21
it was called appetization
22:23
he and he put all his food in glass jars
22:25
in fact not in tins
22:27
so he won the prize and it was decades
22:29
before microbe theory so he had invented
22:31
say food storage but he didn't know how
22:33
it worked so good when that happened
22:35
yeah
22:36
and then later on there was a british
22:38
innovator called peter durand and he
22:40
invented
22:40
giant tins so you know you have a normal
22:43
tin of beans or something it's a normal
22:45
size
22:46
he was keen to scale up for the royal
22:48
navy and he stored up to 13 and a half
22:50
kilos of meat in a single can
22:53
i'm already going to go on the limb and
22:54
say that's not an invention
22:56
making a much much bigger version of
22:58
something that's already
23:00
i couldn't i couldn't invent the giant
23:01
book yeah exactly
23:03
well not with that attitude yeah no
23:06
we're talking about a guinness world
23:08
record attempt
23:08
aren't we think of it it's a giant it's
23:11
a
23:12
it's a quarter of a person's size oh my
23:13
god andy's showing us how big it is with
23:15
his hands and he's right
23:16
it's an invention
23:20
okay innovator he innovated it he
23:22
innovated
23:23
it's very impressive though wasn't he
23:25
the same guy
23:27
wasn't this the one where um it was like
23:29
30 years until they invented something
23:31
to
23:31
a specific tin opener didn't they yeah
23:33
so in the napoleonic wars they all use
23:35
their um what those instruments called
23:37
baroness yeah
23:39
another name thing i came across i was
23:41
looking at some cheese studies
23:43
and there was a cheese study in the
23:46
encyclopedia of
23:47
food sciences and nutrition that was
23:49
published in 2003 it was called cheese's
23:51
colon
23:52
processed cheese and the author was
23:54
called a gouda
23:56
[Laughter]
23:57
i'm weird no yeah an unusual surname
24:01
that's amazing
24:02
if you're surprised that there was a
24:04
person called craft
24:05
i know but i think you'd be biased if
24:08
you were called gouda
24:10
a proper cheese i i'm not sure i would
24:12
trust you to write a balanced
24:14
article about processed chicken oh yeah
24:16
you're right you know it's like being
24:17
called baby bell and writing about
24:19
the cheddar industry that is named after
24:21
a guy called bell isn't it
24:23
so i think the laughing cow company was
24:26
founded by
24:27
the bell brothers or maybe it was a
24:28
father and son and the surname was bel
24:31
so i think baby bell is named after a
24:32
guy as well that has
24:33
also been at one point would have been a
24:34
baby yeah so the father actually yeah
24:39
but the thing about laughing cow by the
24:41
way which i did see is i went on the
24:42
website and they have one
24:44
top secret technology there that they've
24:46
never given away to anyone else
24:48
okay do you know what that is um oh how
24:50
to
24:51
no triangles is it folding
24:54
the foil kind of yeah is it the red
24:57
thing how you get the red thing to peel
24:59
off so perfectly
25:00
there's no way the easy open foil
25:02
wrapping technology which according to
25:04
the website remains top secret to this
25:06
day
25:06
wow uh yeah it's not a technology that
25:09
we're crying
25:15
that would be so useful for so many yeah
25:17
imagine if you had it for your clothes
25:19
and whenever you needed to get undressed
25:21
at the night you start to pull one red
25:23
string
25:23
and you stop completely undressed you've
25:26
got that
25:28
strip shows would be a lot shorter
25:30
wouldn't there if there was one baby
25:31
bell style peel off thing
25:36
i found a weird thing about cheese
25:38
humans invented cheese
25:40
before they could digest milk okay what
25:44
yeah okay so so all mammals you know
25:47
they're lactose tolerant
25:48
when they're very young because they're
25:50
they're drinking their mother's milk and
25:51
then
25:52
all mammals are lactose intolerant um or
25:54
almost although
25:55
and then humans uh only got the genetic
25:58
mutation to
25:59
to allow them to drink milk as adults um
26:03
a few thousand years ago but so we
26:06
couldn't digest lactose but cheese has
26:08
much lower lactose than milk
26:10
so if you make cheese you can store all
26:12
the calories of the animal's milk
26:15
in cheese form and that means you can
26:16
keep the calories for longer so you'll
26:17
survive longer
26:19
you'll be better fed so that gives you a
26:21
reason to keep animals
26:22
for longer rather than immediately
26:24
killing them or hunting them so that
26:25
means that you domesticate
26:27
sheep and cows and all of this and you
26:28
make cheese but you don't drink the milk
26:30
but the thing is like to make the cheese
26:32
is this not right that what you do is
26:33
you get the milk and then you get the
26:35
stomach
26:36
of a dead animal and you put the milk
26:38
inside the stomach because it's got acid
26:40
which you need
26:40
and then you leave it for weeks and
26:42
weeks and weeks and then you eat it
26:43
yeah i mean anna was talking about
26:46
things not being
26:47
inventions that isn't it it is one of
26:50
those things that required them to be
26:52
incredibly bored and wouldn't be able to
26:53
be invented now because we've all got
26:55
better things to do
26:55
than experiment with these bizarre
26:58
things
26:59
and the ancient greeks used to grate
27:01
goats cheese into their beer and wine
27:03
one of the earliest wines actually the
27:05
kind of peasant wine mentioned by homer
27:07
is uh actually wine and goat cheese
27:11
we could try and bring back i mean i
27:13
like wine and cheese
27:14
yeah wine and cheese together but not
27:16
one inside the other
27:17
at a party you know at a party you've
27:19
got you've got to hold a plate and
27:20
you've got to hold a glass and it's
27:21
really difficult if you ever need to
27:23
use it you have gesture gesture yeah if
27:25
you just put the cheese
27:26
in the wine yeah i'm going to try that
27:28
this christmas
27:30
who are these the greeks or the romans
27:32
the ancient greeks are okay do you think
27:34
if they came here
27:35
they would think we were really
27:36
pretentious because you know if you go
27:37
to some really posh restaurants and they
27:39
have deconstructed
27:40
xyz like you have a deconstructed
27:42
crumble where the crumbles on one side
27:44
and you know what i mean
27:45
well yeah they'd come and say you
27:47
deconstructed wine cheese drink
27:51
wine on one side of your cheese on the
27:52
other thing you are
27:56
[Applause]
28:00
okay it's time for fact number three and
28:02
that is andy my fact is that when
28:04
charles darwin submitted on the origin
28:06
of species to his publisher the
28:07
publisher suggested he should rewrite it
28:09
exclusively about pigeons
28:12
so ouch i know
28:16
so there's there's this uh article in
28:18
the london review of books which is
28:19
reviewing
28:20
uh a book all about the publisher john
28:23
murray and
28:24
the correspondence between authors and
28:25
the publishers over centuries
28:27
so it's got all these famous authors
28:29
like jane austen and lord byron and
28:31
david livingston
28:32
and all these people and the firms sent
28:35
on the origin of species out to two
28:37
readers when it came in one of them was
28:39
a lawyer called george pollock who said
28:41
that it was beyond the apprehension of
28:42
any living scientist
28:44
and the other was this guy called
28:46
whitwell elwyn who was a clergyman
28:48
and he wrote back saying look i like
28:49
darwin but
28:51
um it's a wild and foolish piece of
28:53
imagination and that it would really
28:55
be a good book if you just wrote it
28:56
about pigeons because it's really good
28:58
he said everybody is interested in
29:00
pigeons
29:01
so did when elwynn then el rin sorry
29:05
spoke to
29:06
murray right did murray then go back to
29:08
darwin and say write it about pigeons
29:10
that's why i couldn't work out or was it
29:11
just a
29:12
internal email kind of thing oh i don't
29:14
know
29:15
i don't know whether it got passed on to
29:17
darwin yeah but that wouldn't involve
29:18
ripping the whole thing to pieces
29:20
because there's quite a lot of pigeon
29:21
in there it's just a sharter book yeah
29:24
it's a very slight edit
29:27
he was really into pigeons though i
29:29
hadn't quite realized how much of a
29:30
pigeon fancier he was yeah so he might
29:32
have been flattered that his pigeon work
29:34
was so
29:34
inspiring he was a member of two london
29:36
pigeon clubs
29:40
one's not enough that's where your wife
29:41
would be a bit annoyed wouldn't she
29:43
you're spending your time at one pigeon
29:44
club
29:47
and the thing is with the pigeons like
29:49
he was it was a bit like breeding dogs
29:51
wasn't it like the pigeons were really
29:53
weird looking like they
29:55
they bred them to look not like pigeons
29:58
yeah so they didn't look like the
29:59
pigeons you'd see
30:00
yeah so like breeds that he worked on uh
30:03
included the pygmy powder pigeon
30:06
uh the polish helmet pigeon uh the
30:09
english long-faced muffin tumbler
30:12
a classic if you look at these pictures
30:14
if you google them they don't look like
30:16
pigeons at all there's one the english
30:17
carrier pigeon which you don't see
30:18
anymore
30:19
it looks almost identical to jacob
30:21
rees-mogg
30:22
doesn't it it really really does like
30:24
honestly if you google it it just looks
30:26
like jacob responded you should put up a
30:27
picture on twitter i will
30:28
i will because they're extinct aren't
30:30
they so maybe he's actually the one
30:31
surviving member of the species
30:34
we need to start breeding him he's
30:36
breeding glasses
30:37
[Laughter]
30:39
um because there were these ones called
30:41
powders which are really weird because
30:42
they
30:43
bred them to grow this they're bizarre
30:46
birds because they it looks like they
30:47
swallowed a bowling ball basically
30:49
yeah they've got this huge they've got
30:50
this huge lump under there
30:52
under their chins as it were in their
30:54
neck it's really strange
30:55
well i find it weird that we're so used
30:57
to are just very standard pigeons when
30:59
there are
30:59
there is this huge variety so if you go
31:01
to pigeon
31:02
contest and pigeon beauty pageants which
31:04
you can they're quite a big deal in the
31:05
middle east in fact
31:07
then they look almost nothing like
31:08
pigeons a lot of them have that kind of
31:10
gross
31:10
turkey-like red bulbous stuff around
31:13
their eyes
31:14
but yeah it's a very popular thing i
31:16
think they've been big in the middle
31:17
east
31:18
since 11 50 when the first
31:21
pigeon post service was set up in
31:24
baghdad and it took messages from
31:25
baghdad to syria
31:26
and by the 1160s then it was you know it
31:29
was constantly taking messages back and
31:30
forth
31:31
to the extent that in the crusades the
31:33
christians brought loads of falcons over
31:35
with them to try and intercept the
31:37
pigeon post in the middle east
31:39
so they were the first hackers would
31:42
grab their messages
31:43
they also used to do a lot of homing
31:44
pigeon races which still go on to this
31:46
day but that's been going since the
31:48
1800s
31:49
and um i was reading about one in china
31:51
that happened
31:52
very recently and it's a huge prize for
31:54
this it's a big deal in china so 160
31:56
000 american dollars would be the prize
31:58
for the winning homing pigeon so they
32:00
get sent 100 miles away
32:02
and they have to fly back to this spot
32:04
and um
32:05
the fastest speed that a homing pigeon
32:06
has ever done is
32:08
um it go they go about 100 miles an hour
32:11
yeah but no way this is the thousand
32:14
hours this is
32:15
clock speeds faster than 100 miles an
32:18
hour
32:18
um but the ones that won would have had
32:21
to have gone
32:22
200 miles an hour the first four places
32:24
and they couldn't work out how that was
32:26
possible
32:27
and it turns out what it was is the
32:28
owners of the pigeons
32:30
um had them fly off but immediately come
32:32
back hopped on a bullet train which can
32:34
go 200 miles an hour
32:36
get to the other side and release them
32:37
and and they won but they have been
32:39
caught
32:39
and and sentenced to i think that's i
32:41
think that's such a silly
32:42
cheat because you will be caught because
32:44
pigeons don't fly at 200 pounds
32:46
sorry did you say they got sent to
32:47
prison not the pigeons they're humans
32:49
still uh well it's a huge prize isn't it
32:52
it's 160 000
32:53
so that's yeah yeah they go for a lot i
32:56
think a
32:57
chinese guy recently bought one for half
32:59
a million dollars american dollars yeah
33:02
they go for a huge amount i should say
33:03
um they were sentenced to three years
33:05
but it was a suspended sentence so if
33:06
another crime occurs then they go to
33:08
prison don't do it again
33:10
have you guys heard of the spanish uh
33:12
sport which is called
33:14
it's thieving it's a pigeon thiefing
33:16
competition no
33:17
this is amazing so it's basically pigeon
33:20
love island
33:21
you get you're a pigeon fancier and
33:25
you have a male so half a dozen men each
33:27
bring a male
33:28
pigeon and they paint them in a bright
33:30
color to mark which one is theirs
33:32
and then there's a marked female and the
33:34
male pigeons all compete to seduce
33:37
the female and the aim is to get them to
33:39
come home with them
33:40
because this is a very unusual pigeon
33:43
it's called the horseman thief powder
33:45
and it unusually it mates by bringing
33:49
its mate back to its place um for sex
33:53
and so how do you know that they'll all
33:55
fancy her though
33:57
um i think call pigeons just all fancy
33:59
all other pigeons they are actually
34:00
quite randy aren't they they're not
34:02
these ones are not choosy yeah and so
34:03
the owner wins if um
34:06
his male is the one who wins the
34:07
seduction competition with the female
34:09
yeah they all strut around and they you
34:12
know they dance and they do little
34:14
that was some excellent pigeon strutting
34:16
there
34:18
and this happens in scotland too it's
34:19
called um
34:21
do basically the pigeons are called dues
34:23
d double o
34:24
and if you if you see a pigeon flying up
34:27
and you know that one of your rival do
34:29
men
34:29
has released their pigeon you release
34:31
your pigeon of the opposite sex and then
34:33
there's this battle in the skies over
34:34
who goes back to whose place
34:36
and if you and if the pigeon comes back
34:37
to your place you get to keep both
34:39
pigeons
34:40
it must be confusing because they're
34:41
completely painted right so that's
34:43
almost the equivalent human wise of
34:45
going to a halloween party
34:47
and fancying someone who's just come as
34:50
a skeleton
34:51
but you get on well and then the next
34:53
morning and you're like oh you put them
34:54
white
34:59
pigeons were the first drones in a way
35:02
weren't they or some of the first drones
35:05
in that there was in 1907 this guy
35:08
called dr julius
35:09
nurbrunner which i will have pronounced
35:12
incorrectly sorry but he was a german
35:13
apothecary
35:15
and he invented the pigeon camera and
35:17
this was
35:18
a very exciting adventure at the time it
35:20
was thought to be quite revolutionary
35:21
because
35:22
a couple of cameras have been sent up on
35:23
balloons and stuff but this was really
35:25
acting like a proper drone so he'd strap
35:27
it like a
35:28
backpack onto the pigeon's chest like a
35:30
chest pack
35:31
and send them off to fly fly through the
35:34
air
35:34
and they took amazing aerial photographs
35:36
it's so worth looking at them they are
35:38
like beautiful pictures and i hadn't
35:40
really considered that for
35:42
most people seeing those was bizarre
35:44
because they've never seen pictures
35:45
taken from above
35:46
oh yeah there's a whole school of first
35:48
world war
35:49
artists which or post-first world war
35:52
art which is derived from
35:54
aerial photography and aerial landscapes
35:57
because
35:57
it just wasn't uh i guess you saw maps
36:00
but you could see it from the top of the
36:02
hill
36:02
or something but yeah from that you'd
36:04
never you'd never be able to see
36:06
a city from above yeah exactly he also
36:10
actually
36:10
invented a horse-drawn dove cut you know
36:14
a home for the pigeons and doves that he
36:16
was strapping the cameras to
36:17
and dark room which is quite cool to go
36:20
with the pigeon cameras
36:21
so that when you thought oh i suddenly
36:23
want to photograph this city you take
36:24
your whole horse-drawn dove
36:26
cut and dark room inside to where it was
36:28
and then you could send them off
36:30
um just one last quick thing on darwin
36:33
maybe you guys all knew this but i
36:35
didn't realize that in the origin of the
36:37
species
36:38
in the sixth edition he added a new
36:40
chapter which was responding to all the
36:42
criticisms
36:44
from previous editions of his book
36:46
really i think that's such a good idea
36:48
that's a great idea nice great we should
36:50
do that with the book of the year
36:51
yeah i think you'll find the wasps
36:53
article is funny
36:54
[Laughter]
36:56
how many people wrote in saying not
36:58
enough pigeons did he have
37:00
loads of responses
37:03
i just have one last thing it's not
37:05
great but i'll mention it anyway
37:06
oh yeah buckle up this is just a fact on
37:10
um publishers getting it wrong uh so in
37:13
in this fact it's it's the pigeon
37:15
suggestion um
37:16
this has just happened in australia
37:18
there's a business woman in socialite
37:20
called roxy jacenko
37:21
and she's just released a book now she's
37:23
a she's very famous as a pr
37:24
specialist and um she was on celebrity
37:27
apprentice in australia so she's a she's
37:29
a big name there
37:30
and um so the book is described as a no
37:32
guide to pr
37:33
social media and building your brand and
37:36
it had all these glowing reviews on it
37:38
being street smart and hard-headed
37:39
totally tenacious pr expert but they've
37:41
had to pulp every single one of the
37:43
copies of the book because it also
37:44
included
37:45
as a result of the publisher's mistake a
37:47
quote that was a misquote
37:49
that said on the front that the book
37:50
never fails to disappoint
37:52
um so med say never fails to deliver but
37:56
yeah total pr disaster
38:04
[Music]
38:05
time for our final fact of the show and
38:06
that's my fact my fact this week
38:08
is that king louis xiii of france had a
38:11
royal
38:12
anagramist wow yeah
38:15
this was like you know you'd have a
38:16
court jester and then you would also
38:18
have your
38:18
royal anagramist who would just be there
38:20
ready to make anagrams
38:22
uh for the amusement of the king that
38:24
that really was the role
38:26
um he uh he did a number of things with
38:29
anagrams it wasn't just amusing name uh
38:31
remixes
38:32
it was uh he used to do prophecies as
38:35
well
38:36
using anagrams and yeah so it had a lot
38:38
of had a lot of mystical purposes as
38:40
well as
38:41
i wonder if he could make an anagram of
38:42
louis xiii
38:44
because there's an x and three eyes in
38:46
there yeah that's a pretty tough one if
38:48
he can do that he deserves the job
38:49
you're right you get
38:50
six i've got the word six from louis and
38:53
then the x and then i've
38:54
you've got l-o-u and then you've got
38:55
three eyes you've got we in french
39:06
[Music]
39:08
the romans supposedly there's a there's
39:11
a thing called ours magna the great art
39:13
and supposedly the romans called
39:15
anagramming ours magnet which is an
39:16
anagram of the word anagrams
39:19
but i don't think they used i don't
39:21
think they knew the word anagrams
39:23
because they didn't have a plural form
39:25
like which just adds an s to the main
39:27
noun normally there are a few
39:28
weird ones where it does but anyway i
39:31
don't think that is true but
39:32
it does come from the greek and a
39:34
grammar design from anna which means
39:36
backwards
39:37
and grammar which means letter so it's
39:38
putting the letters backwards anna with
39:40
one end though
39:41
guys not the two ends yes which means
39:44
excellent anna meaning backwards
39:47
considering that anna is a palindrome
39:49
it's quite weird
39:51
yeah that is weird
39:54
anyway so what about this guy who is he
39:58
so yeah so we're talking the 1600s here
40:00
this is when king louis the 13th reigned
40:02
um and this person um i don't actually
40:05
know if he had a number of them
40:06
uh but the one person you can find who
40:09
definitely was one of his royal
40:10
anagrammers was thomas
40:11
billon so he lived from 1617 to
40:15
1647 and he served as the royal
40:17
anagramas twice
40:18
so there's a suggestion that there might
40:20
have been another person fulfilling the
40:22
role in between
40:23
actually there was a real sudoku guy in
40:25
between
40:28
so he did it from 1624 to 1631 and then
40:31
from 1640 till his death i guess in
40:34
1647.
40:35
maybe he was fired in 31 because he had
40:36
a leftover letter or something
40:39
but he also he predicted people's
40:40
characters so he would
40:42
rearrange the letters of your name and
40:44
if it came out as being you know
40:46
an evil phrase then people would think
40:49
badly of you
40:50
do you think as a parent if you were
40:52
having a new child
40:53
you would deliberately come up with a
40:55
good word like an anagram of
40:57
you call your child like an anagram of
40:59
awesome yes
41:00
yeah you were trying trickier
41:04
yes this is something that i think we
41:06
might have mentioned on qi
41:07
and one of our researchers found the
41:08
other day again but that
41:10
during the whole enlightenment anagrams
41:12
were something that fascinated people
41:13
they were thought to portend certain
41:15
things like you say if your name could
41:16
spell something bad
41:17
but also they were used by lots of
41:19
scientists as a way of concealing their
41:21
discoveries
41:22
whilst also kind of stamping them as
41:24
their own so people like
41:26
galileo and robert hook would record
41:28
their initial results
41:29
as an anagram and send it off when they
41:32
hadn't actually confirmed their results
41:33
yet because that meant once they
41:35
confirmed the results they could say
41:36
look i did it first look here's the
41:37
anagram that proves
41:38
so good it's like blockchain i imagine
41:41
even though i don't really know what
41:42
blockchain is
41:43
me neither but i imagine it is too but
41:45
the um the anagrams were exceptionally
41:48
part weren't they were they yeah so uh
41:50
christian huygens
41:51
um he discovered the rings around saturn
41:54
and he wanted an anagram um so he wanted
41:57
to anagram anuto
41:59
singator tenuai plano
42:03
ecliptam inclinato which means it is
42:06
surrounded by a thin flat ring nowhere
42:08
touching inclined to the elliptic so we
42:10
wanted to make that
42:11
his anagram was a a a a a
42:14
a a
42:24
[Laughter]
42:29
the well we said a few weeks ago the
42:30
crosswords answers didn't have to be
42:32
actual words
42:33
the underground has to be a natural word
42:34
christian god that was an easy job then
42:36
if that's all you had to do
42:39
random things well there are kind of
42:40
different types of anagram this is
42:42
according to a book i was reading from
42:44
about a hundred years ago i think which
42:45
was saying you get a
42:46
synogram which is kind of like that but
42:48
a sinogram is an anagram
42:50
where the anagram means the same sort of
42:52
thing so vile is a synogram of evil
42:55
or angered of enraged 11 plus 2 and 12
42:58
plus 1 is the famous one that
43:00
blows my mind yeah yeah every time as
43:02
always yeah i'm always a winner but
43:04
imagine if you thought that there were
43:05
hidden things in anagrams you would use
43:07
those as examples of like
43:08
look at look how connected the universe
43:10
is when we reshuffle this stuff i would
43:12
have bought into that immediately
43:14
great there's a website called
43:16
anagrammy.com
43:17
which has a monthly award so uh the
43:20
archbishop of canterbury is another
43:21
church's type of rabbi
43:24
um the amateur thespians is an anagram
43:28
of inapt ham's used theater
43:30
i really like and do they do they
43:32
release a something they want an anagram
43:35
made of or are you just submitting
43:36
i think you submit your own right okay
43:38
and they pick a really good one each
43:39
month
43:40
so they're synograms they're synograms
43:42
and then you get anti-grams
43:44
which are the ones that mean the
43:45
opposite so like diplomacy is mad
43:48
policy that's good there's a guinness
43:51
world record for the longest
43:52
anagram that you can get in the english
43:54
language and
43:56
um this this is for a non-scientific
43:58
english word
43:59
um because in the scientific ones they
44:01
they're pretty bizarre
44:03
um so in a non-scientific word
44:06
i have known that in the past but i
44:08
can't remember it now okay so i'll give
44:09
you i'll give you
44:10
the the original word and see if you can
44:13
make the anagram so
44:14
conversationalists oh yeah what is the
44:17
anagram
44:17
conservationist yeah oh that's a cheat
44:21
i think you should have to rearrange at
44:22
least four letters yeah that's
44:25
just making up rules on the fly yeah i'm
44:27
allowed
44:28
yeah it is a bit bit measly isn't it
44:30
what about scone
44:31
and cones yes no that's currently the
44:34
record no
44:35
what is why is that not good enough i
44:37
think they should be have to begin with
44:38
a different letter
44:39
scone yeah yeah okay i'll accept
44:42
scotland
44:42
i'm not with that right off the bat like
44:44
just did you yeah
44:45
you invented it have you heard of corey
44:49
calhoun
44:50
no he's an anagrammer i don't think he's
44:52
a pro but he's about as close as the
44:54
modern age gets to a pro and a grammar
44:56
so he rearranged the first line of
44:58
hamlet's soliloquy to come up with a
45:00
summary of
45:01
hamlet so cool as in just
45:04
to be or not to be uh no that is the
45:06
question let's see if it passes the anna
45:07
test
45:08
for crazy anagram so to be honest that
45:11
is the question whether it is nobler in
45:12
the mind to suffer the slings and arrows
45:14
of outrageous fortune okay
45:15
that he rearranged to make in one of the
45:18
bard's best thought of tragedies
45:20
our insistent hero hamlet queries on two
45:22
fronts about how life turns rotten
45:25
that's very good that's really nice
45:29
so good there's another thing that gets
45:30
done where these kind of big challenges
45:33
where
45:33
people try to take complete texts and
45:36
create an anagram
45:37
that works so that it just works as a
45:39
whole separate work
45:40
if that makes sense so the biggest one
45:42
that's ever been completed is a guy
45:44
called mike keith has anagrammed the
45:46
complete text of moby dick
45:48
so that's yeah 935 763 letters
45:52
um and he used a computer to do this so
45:54
that scene is achieved also the computer
45:56
did it yeah but there was a person who
45:58
did do it all by himself which was
45:59
richard brody and he made an anagram of
46:01
battle of the books by jonathan
46:02
swift and that's 42 000 letters 142
46:06
177 letters but how much of a different
46:09
anagram does it be could you have the
46:10
exact same book but it just is
46:12
call me male-ish yeah the rest of it's
46:15
exactly the same yeah
46:17
um so the the ancient greeks had this is
46:19
kind of related so
46:20
it's about um palindromes not anagrams
46:24
but
46:24
greek fountains had a big palindrome
46:27
written on them
46:28
which said nisbon and nomin mata me
46:31
monon opsin so that's exactly the same
46:33
backwards as it is forwards
46:35
and it means wash the sin as well as the
46:38
face
46:39
that's a good one isn't that cool for a
46:40
fountain yeah very good
46:42
i do know what the longest palindrome in
46:44
the english language is god
46:45
it's redivider read divider first one
46:48
oh cool just a fact that's good fact did
46:51
you guys know the dutch national anthem
46:53
is an acrostic as in the first letter of
46:56
each word
46:56
spell something out the first letter of
46:59
each line
47:00
spells something out so the first letter
47:02
of sorry the first letter of each of the
47:04
15
47:05
verses spells out william van nassau as
47:08
in william of orange's name um because
47:10
and it's sung from his perspective so
47:12
it's all in the first person bizarrely
47:13
when you're dutch you all sing as if
47:14
you're william of orange when you sing
47:16
the anthem
47:16
isn't there a line where he kind of says
47:18
and i um
47:20
give everything to the king of spain in
47:22
that instead
47:23
i think there is yeah that's awkward
47:26
yeah how weird
47:27
and they were trying to change it i
47:28
think but now you can't really otherwise
47:30
the acrostic won't work it doesn't work
47:32
yeah scuppered there was a guy called
47:35
andre
47:36
pujon and this was back in the day when
47:38
everyone thought that um
47:40
anagrams were really important and they
47:42
had some kind of spiritual thing behind
47:44
them
47:45
he worked out that his name was an
47:47
anagram of pondu
47:49
durian which means hanged in rio
47:52
and so he decided to fulfill his destiny
47:56
by traveling to the town of riyam
47:58
and committing criminal offense which
48:01
meant that he was hanged
48:03
wow um so he actually you know made sure
48:06
that the omen happened
48:07
right right oh poor guy oh no silly
48:10
silly man that could have been there
48:12
could have been another anagram he might
48:14
have found where it said
48:15
had a relaxing holiday somewhere else
48:18
yeah
48:19
yeah i mean it probably is just a story
48:21
isn't it but it is a
48:22
story that exists and that's the bar
48:26
we've decided
48:29
um so there's an underground thing in
48:30
our book as well in the book of the year
48:32
there's a um
48:33
there's a thing about banksy because he
48:35
submitted an artwork to the royal
48:36
academy
48:37
under the name brian s garckman which is
48:40
an anagram of the words banksy anagram
48:42
yeah nice did not spot it they rejected
48:44
it and then they asked him can he submit
48:46
a work they just got in touch with the
48:48
bank students they can use them in a
48:49
work of art
48:50
and he sent them the thing that they had
48:51
already rejected and they accepted it
48:54
would they have been expected to spot an
48:57
anagram
48:57
do people naturally have an anagram pass
48:59
over everything submitted
49:02
this is a nanogram of moby dick
49:06
nice try buddy supposedly if you
49:10
are asked to solve anagrams against a
49:12
green background and then against a red
49:13
background you'll do worse on the red
49:15
background
49:16
oh really this has been tried and
49:20
um the people who were exposed to the
49:21
red background anagrams did
49:23
substantially worse
49:24
is that because the text was in red on
49:26
both times
49:28
black text um sorry so is that sorry i
49:32
misunderstood
49:32
so it's um there's a piece of paper that
49:35
is red
49:36
yes right and it's got anna it's got
49:37
anagrams in black that need to be solved
49:40
as black as the devil's nutsack
49:52
there was another paper that suggests
49:55
that
49:55
it's easier to solve anagrams while
49:58
you're laying down rather than standing
49:59
up
50:00
right no way yeah i think that's true is
50:03
it because there's more blood flow in
50:04
your head
50:06
um because this the red green thing is
50:08
crazy it suggests that if you do
50:09
worse on the red that you're sensitive
50:11
to the queue of danger
50:14
you think these anagrams are dangerous
50:16
you know it must be just that you can't
50:17
see black on red as well as you can see
50:19
no it's really it's not i tried it and
50:21
actually i did better on the
50:23
ones with the red background than the
50:24
green ones so i would have been an
50:26
anomaly
50:26
you're so brave does that mean you
50:28
should lead us all into war
50:31
i'm now a general in the army
50:33
[Laughter]
50:38

00:24
and i'm sitting here with
00:25
james harkin andrew hunter murray and
00:28
this week we are with ed
00:29
brooke hitching our fellow qi elf who
00:32
has just written
00:33
a new book right yes it's called uh the
00:36
golden atlas
00:37
uh history of exploration um just filled
00:40
with that kind of sort of quirky q-i
00:42
style facts yes it is a really beautiful
00:45
looking book
00:45
full of amazing looking kind of maps and
00:48
little factoids about exploration
00:50
get it now go to ed's twitter feed or
00:52

00:53
after the show after the show sorry get
00:55
it in you know however long it takes to
00:57
listen to this
00:58
uh it's available in any bookshop or
01:00
online and for now once again we're
01:02
gathered here with our four favorite
01:03
facts from the last seven days in no
01:05
particular order here we
01:07
go starting with you ed so my fact is
01:10
the most experienced sailor aboard
01:12
captain cook's first voyage was a goat
01:15
[Music]
01:17
but yeah she she previously sailed
01:18
around the world um
01:20
when so when you say she was experienced
01:22
she didn't do any sailing presumably she
01:23
was just on milk provision yeah i don't
01:25
think she was too
01:26
like nifty with the ropes if that's me
01:28
but but yeah she'd um she'd survived
01:31
like a global like a circumnavigation
01:33
that you know i think she'd survive
01:35
three shipwrecks as well
01:36
wow that's pretty amazing all for her
01:38
milk so she was yeah a really impressive
01:41
what was she called uh she didn't have a
01:43
name but she's known as the
01:44
well-traveled goat
01:46
that is the first animal to travel
01:48
around the world and in fact
01:49
wasn't she the first female to travel
01:51
around the world yeah and they didn't
01:52
even give her a name
01:54
they named her they're well traveled and
01:55
then they put her species name at the
01:57
end what's wrong with that yeah
01:59
they did they gave her some jewelry like
02:00
when she returned safe and sound she
02:02
went to live
02:02
in marlend and they gave her a silver
02:05
collar
02:06
um she was quite a fancy goat um and
02:09
then when she died dr johnson
02:11
wrote her epitaph do you think they
02:13
brought her on because she was so
02:14
experienced as well as her milk
02:16
stuff like because you could get milk
02:18
from any goat but this is a goat that's
02:20
been on
02:21
two different experts proven yeah she's
02:22
probably there like a cigarette in her
02:24
hand like no
02:24
no worries at all but i guess well she
02:27
could have been thought of as a lucky
02:28
guy if she'd survived shipwrecks yeah
02:30
definitely so that's something captain
02:32
cook actually once did chase a goat
02:34
across an entire island
02:37
that's true was it a big island i don't
02:40
know it was a stolen goat though
02:42
so he captain cook was making these
02:44
voyages around the world wasn't he and
02:46
the first one was scientific and the
02:47
other two
02:47
were discovering you know botanical
02:50
things and land masses
02:52
and that frequently things got nicked by
02:54
the people he encountered the
02:55
aboriginals who he was
02:57
meeting for the first time because there
02:58
wasn't the same sense of property rights
03:00
and ownership and things like that
03:01
and some things he said no we should
03:03
just let it go this it doesn't matter
03:05
and then but other times when it was an
03:07
important thing for the mission he was
03:09
really
03:09
a stickler for getting it back and we
03:11
wanted the goat back
03:12
because the third voyage one of the
03:14
missions was to introduce european
03:16
livestock
03:17
so pairs of european livestock so if
03:19
you've lost one goat
03:20
it's very very hard to get goat breeding
03:22
i can't believe they didn't bring a
03:23
spare
03:24
though you'd assume that a couple might
03:26
go i would have brought
03:27
five or six i think yeah i mean if we
03:30
can just stock
03:30
six ships worth of stuff then that's
03:32
fine i think it was quite crowded the
03:34
space on these ships hannah
03:36
fair enough you have been the worst on
03:37
noah's ark why have you only got two of
03:39
them
03:42
what if these two don't fancy each other
03:44
well a lot of
03:45
room on the ship would have been taken
03:46
up with sauerkraut they brought several
03:48
tons of sauerkraut because captain cook
03:50
was one of the first to realize that
03:52
scurvy um could be treated with like
03:55
vitamins
03:56
and he didn't quite understand why um
03:58
but he had to convince no one likes
03:59
sauerkraut so the way that he convinced
04:01
his crew to eat it was to serve his
04:03
officers like in a really fancy
04:05
uh way and so the crew would get jealous
04:07
and think oh this must be something
04:08
worth
04:10
like a nouvelle cuisine yeah exactly
04:12
sort of a nice sort of white tablecloth
04:15
just a dump load of sauerkraut that's
04:17
really clever
04:18
um did you know that one of his
04:20
expeditions he had his
04:22
ostensible mission and then his secret
04:24
mission
04:25
so this is his 1768 expedition when he
04:28
was officially going to tahiti he was
04:31
supposed to observe the transit of venus
04:32
across the face of the sun and do a
04:34
bunch of other scientific stuff
04:35
but the british government told him do
04:38
this but here's a sealed
04:39
envelope and when you've done that
04:42
you're allowed to open this sealed
04:43
envelope and that contains the secret
04:45
information for what you're actually
04:46
supposed to do
04:47
it's like taskmaster it was such an
04:50
extreme
04:51
long episode of taskmaster and yeah he
04:54
opened the envelope when he done his
04:55
tahiti business
04:57
and it said please find the great
04:58
southern continent everyone was
04:59
convinced there was a big continent
05:01
in down near the south pole and they
05:02
were right obviously but
05:04
he tried to find it and failed they knew
05:06
yeah they knew something was there and
05:08
it was all based on sort of like
05:10
sightings of little
05:11
islands and maybe ice flows yeah but
05:13
yeah on the second voyage they passed
05:15
cook and his men passed within 70 miles
05:18
of antarctica
05:19
and didn't didn't find it wow
05:23
how do we know do they leave footprint
05:26
in the sea
05:27
what of where they went yeah i know they
05:28
had maps oh yeah they were writing it
05:31
all down
05:32
because i think it's full of maps
05:34
questions written
05:36
maps about how do we know where any of
05:38
these people went there
05:41
yeah i've been reading about the ship
05:43
itself the endeavour this is a very
05:45
famous ship but it was so
05:46
it was such an unglamorous ship so it
05:48
was a coal
05:49
carrying ship which is not you know very
05:52
glam it wasn't very fast it could only
05:54
go about six or seven
05:55
knots at nautical miles an hour and um
05:59
but nonetheless it was incredibly hardy
06:01
because it was designed to carry coal
06:02
around and it was built to last
06:04
so it um did all these voyages
06:08
it hit the great barrier reef once he
06:09
just bumped into the great barrier reef
06:11
and it tore a hole in the side of the
06:12
ship and they had to dump six cannon
06:14
overboard immediately
06:16
so it wouldn't sink probably damaged the
06:17
coral as well
06:19
oh yeah but who cares i mean i was just
06:21
thinking that's effectively a footprint
06:22
of the sea isn't it
06:24
yes that's how we know sorry i didn't
06:27
mean that about who cares it's coral i
06:28
care a lot about
06:29
sorry i get it but scientists spent 200
06:32
years trying to find the cannon that he
06:33
ditched overboard
06:34
and they knew that he'd been around
06:36
there because they left
06:37
charles and matt saying where they've
06:39
been but no one could actually find the
06:40
exact cannon until 1969 when they went
06:43
there with a magnetometer
06:45
looking for the iron of the cannons
06:47
testing for magnetism as a barrier reef
06:48
yeah
06:49
very clever i found them well because we
06:50
also recently found quite recently found
06:52
the endeavor itself didn't we so the
06:54
endeavor was actually two ships
06:56
in a way because he used it uh 17
07:00
you know 1770s 7060s 1770s he used it
07:03
and then it was renamed and repurposed
07:06
it became the lord's sandwich
07:08
and it took place in the battle of
07:10
brooklyn in 1776.
07:12
it's one of the largest ships used there
07:13
and we only found out in the 1990s that
07:15
that was the same ship
07:17
so i find that really weird that ships
07:19
are fully repurposed but
07:21
it was called the lord sandwich captain
07:23
cook was killed on the sandwich islands
07:26
it all comes full circle like the world
07:29
he traveled around
07:31
um yeah he was um what happened to him
07:34
he was
07:34
he was baked was he put in a big party
07:37
this was a big popular method he was
07:38
eating wasn't it but yeah he wasn't
07:40
eating he was just baked so his bones
07:41
could be removed and
07:43
treated respectfully okay it's a big
07:45
honor to be baked
07:46
i don't think i'd like to watch the
07:48
sandwich islands version of the great
07:50
sandwich island bake off
07:54
but yeah he was chopped up into little
07:55
bits as well wasn't he so they
07:57
this is when um he arrived on hawaii
08:00
with his crew and they thought he was
08:02
a god for a while they thought the whole
08:03
crew were gods um because they were in
08:05
the middle of their big festival at the
08:06
time
08:07
worshiping gods and then one of their
08:08
crew died which really screwed things up
08:11
for them because they thought they were
08:12
immortal
08:12
and then it turned out they weren't
08:14
immortal and so relationships went a bit
08:16
sour and then he sailed away and then
08:19
rough seas swept him back and they got
08:21
into fights and they ended up killing
08:23
him
08:23
but the um the hawaiians came and
08:26
delivered all his bones in a sack didn't
08:28
they
08:28
i think one of his um compatriots said
08:31
there's another weird link you said that
08:32
dr johnson wrote the epitaph for the
08:35
goat the world travel goat so this was
08:38
after one of captain cook's missions he
08:39
brought back a kangaroo they discovered
08:41
so much new stuff
08:43
um they brought back 30 000 botanical
08:45
species 250 new fish
08:47
and five mammals including a kangaroo
08:49
and
08:50
this is a story of a dinner in 1773
08:53
where dr johnson was so excited
08:55
that captain cook had discovered a
08:57
kangaroo that he did an impression of it
08:59
for all the other guests
09:00
despite the fact he'd never seen one
09:02
okay so here's the account
09:04
he stood erect put out his hands like
09:06
feelers this is dr johnson
09:08
he put out his hands like feelers and
09:09
gathering up the tails of his huge brown
09:11
coat
09:12
so as to resemble the pouch of the
09:13
animal made two or three vigorous bounds
09:16
across the room
09:17
what i mean considering he's never seen
09:19
one before that does sound like a
09:20
kangaroo yeah
09:21
it's perfect i would have been fooled
09:23
[Laughter]
09:25
why do we keep calling him captain cook
09:26
when he wasn't a captain
09:29
oh why do we call him captain cook when
09:31
he wasn't a captain i don't know
09:32
he wasn't a cook either man's a fraud
09:36
i assumed he was a naval captain he was
09:38
a lieutenant when he was on
09:40
endeavour and then when he came back to
09:42
england he was given the rank of
09:44
commander
09:45
and then it by 1775 he became a post
09:49
captain
09:50
which was even better than the captain
09:51
right but he was never actually a
09:52
captain
09:53
that's so funny yeah so he just leaped
09:56
frog's captaincy
09:57
yeah he was just yeah he didn't even
09:59
need to be a captain but we still call
10:00
him captaincy it alliterates doesn't it
10:02
that's the thing
10:02
you're right could have been corporal
10:04
cup commander cook
10:06
he was a commander yeah someone who's a
10:08
captain of two ships
10:09
more than one ship i think you are if
10:12
you
10:12
if you're a captain of one ship but you
10:14
also have another ship in under your
10:15
command you're then a commander so it's
10:17
kind of natural to call someone captain
10:18
even though they're a commander i think
10:20
so
10:20
i think if someone said where's the
10:21
captain they'd say oh we don't have a
10:22
captain
10:26
actually a common misconception
10:28
[Laughter]
10:31
uh emergency on naval pets so naval pets
10:34
were a
10:34
big deal so much so that there was a
10:36
sailor zoo in the 19th century it was
10:38
set up in portsmouth in 1893
10:41
and by 1935 they had lions and various
10:44
marsupials and birds in aviaries and it
10:47
was because people were also taking pets
10:48
so you mean that sailors had pet lions
10:50
on their boats
10:53
it seems like it expanded this naval zoo
10:55
to incorporate things that possibly
10:57
hadn't accompanied the sailors but how
10:59
did they get there james
11:00
how did they hurt yeah they couldn't fly
11:02
in those days there was no euro tunnel
11:04
[Laughter]
11:06
they did find a polar bear some british
11:08
sailors and they just took it onto their
11:09
ship
11:10
and they took it to whale island yeah
11:12
they rescued it it was a cub when they
11:13
rescued it and it was on some ice off
11:15
greenland and they made it the ship's
11:16
mascot and called it barbara
11:18
do you think that's a really funny name
11:20
for a bowler
11:21
[Music]
11:26
all right it's time for fact number two
11:28
and that
11:29
is my fact my fact this week is that for
11:33
150 years
11:34
shakespeare's play the tragedy of king
11:37
lear
11:38
had a happy ending did they still call
11:40
it the tragedy of
11:41
no they didn't they they slightly
11:43
tweaked the title because they thought
11:44
it might not work
11:45
so this is i read this in the
11:46
conversation and i can't believe i
11:48
didn't know it but
11:49
basically people didn't like the fact
11:50
that king lear had a sad ending which
11:51
spoiler alert it does have a really
11:53
really sad ending it's a tragedy so it
11:56
was sort of adapted
11:58
by this writer called nahim tate in 1681
12:01
and he rewrote it and he called it the
12:04
historical play of king lear and his
12:06
three daughters
12:07
to remove the awkward word tragedy and
12:09
yeah at the end cordelia
12:11
um saves king lear he puts her on the
12:13
throne
12:14
there's a little love affair between her
12:16
and remember edgar and king lear who's
12:17
kind of another nice guy
12:19
but i don't think there's any flirting
12:20
with gordita and edgar in the in the
12:22
original
12:23
and um yeah everyone lives happily ever
12:24
after so in the original
12:27
lear dies cordelia dies everyone dies
12:30
everyone almost everyone there's a tiny
12:32
closing speech we all die
12:34
yeah this all right it's a very
12:35
concertina
12:39
it's a classic shakespeare tragedy isn't
12:40
it where within the space is about
12:42
five minutes about 12 people drop dead
12:45
one after the other
12:46
very high body count do you think he
12:47
just gets to the end he's like oh i've
12:48
only got 100 words left
12:51
i'm just gonna have to kill everyone
12:53
he's not doing an essay james i don't
12:54
think he had a word
12:55
count i've gone way over this is the
12:58
weird thing the original
12:59
that shakespeare borrowed from was not a
13:03
tragedy i mean it didn't have this
13:04
incredibly tragic ending where everyone
13:06
dies so the
13:08
rewritten version that you're talking
13:09
about was kind of a return to the
13:10
previous edition
13:12
there was an ancient version called
13:13
there's a thing called holland sheds
13:14
chronicles which has a lot of stories of
13:16
kings and shakespeare got a load of
13:17
plots from that
13:18
but king lear shakespeare's version was
13:21
in 1606
13:22
and it drew heavily on a play from 1594.
13:26
that's crazy isn't it the play was
13:28
called the true chronicle history of the
13:29
life and death of king lear and his
13:30
three daughters
13:31
but that guy's still going to be alive
13:33
probably yeah
13:35
i mean that is like remaking die hard
13:37
that was about 30 years ago this is
13:39
about half the
13:40
time from die hard till now yeah but die
13:42
hard 2 was much closer than that
13:44
yeah but it wasn't a remake
13:51
actually what about um mary poppins they
13:53
are about to redo that aren't they or
13:55
maybe they just have that's true that's
13:56
controversial and that was about 50
13:57
years ago wasn't it yeah yeah so people
13:59
are saying that's too soon
14:00
so maybe this is why he had to kill off
14:02
all the characters so that it wasn't too
14:03
close to the original that he could be
14:05
maybe do you think you can do that just
14:08
take
14:08
any other any of the show any other
14:10
movie and
14:11
make it exactly the same but at the end
14:13
just kill off all the characters
14:15
yeah what's a good film from 2000 the
14:17
early 2000s
14:18
i think we should just rewrite all 10
14:20
series of friends last episode
14:22
everyone dies everyone dies do you know
14:24
the reason why nahim tate changed the
14:26
ending
14:27
they were all little um sunflowers no
14:30
what is it what's snowflakes
14:33
that's what we are in the summer there's
14:35
snowflakes in the winter
14:36
exactly sunflower flowers they're all
14:39
little
14:40
sunflower snowflakes aren't they kind of
14:42
but
14:43
i think it's because the play is about a
14:45
king being usurped
14:47
so and when it when nathan tate was
14:50
writing it was the 1680s
14:51
which is you know charles ii is on the
14:53
throne he's a bit sore about his father
14:55
being executed
14:56
and usurped so restoration theater was
14:59
quite careful with various themes like
15:01
that wow and they didn't they stopped
15:03
doing king lear in george the third
15:05
time oh really because he was mentally
15:08
ill yeah let's put it that way
15:10
but he read king lear and had a bout of
15:12
mental illness
15:14
after having read king lear really yeah
15:16
and they put him in a straight jacket
15:17
and tied him down and
15:19
he was described as agitated and
15:20
confused and he ended up in bed for
15:22
weeks afterwards because
15:23
he'd read king lear and i don't know had
15:26
thought that it was to do with him
15:28
wow maybe it is a dangerous book samuel
15:30
johnson didn't like it
15:31
even though he published one of those
15:33
kangaroos
15:36
oh he didn't do an impression of
15:42
um no he rewrote the whole thing with
15:44
only kangaroos characters
15:46
this is i genuinely have a fact about
15:49
that
15:49
oh my god in 2014 there was an english
15:53
playwright who
15:54
staged a version of king lear called
15:56
king lear with sheep
15:57
which features one human character and
16:00
then about nine sheep
16:01
and he's trying to direct a king the the
16:03
character in the play is trying to
16:04
direct kingly with sheep
16:06
and they disobey him and he goes mad and
16:09
starts acting out the narrative himself
16:11
and she said i wanted to use the idea of
16:12
non-cooperative actors to explore the
16:14
themes of king lear
16:15
because there's a big scene where
16:16
cordelia doesn't do anything when she's
16:18
told to
16:19
and she also said it's cheaper than
16:21
paying actual actors okay
16:23
i've got a fact about that which is kind
16:26
of linked
16:27
which is that nahum tate um as well as
16:30
doing this
16:30
um play he also wrote the song while
16:34
shepherds watch their flocks
16:36
which is the earliest english carol
16:38
written that we're still singing the
16:40
original words of
16:41
so he would have loved this new yeah
16:44
i should just say samuel to finish off
16:46
the samuel johnson thing before those
16:47
sheep
16:49
redirected us he said that king lear
16:51
really troubled him so it caused him
16:52
extreme discomfort
16:54
and even though he published his edition
16:55
in 1765 he found the death of cordelia
16:58
so upsetting that he never ever read it
16:59
again he refused to read it again
17:01
unless his editor was literally like you
17:02
have to look at these pages to work out
17:04
what we're going to cut
17:05
um because he said it was so traumatic
17:07
wow they were really they
17:08
victorians found shakespeare very uh
17:11
horrible
17:12
they rewrote a lot of them i mean what
17:13
it made me think of you talking about
17:15
like sensitivity to
17:16
kings being overthrown do you know you
17:18
know the movie doctor strange love
17:20
yeah hadn't they filmed uh an alternate
17:22
ending
17:23
so it ends with a big sort of uh doc
17:26
strain of getting out of his wheelchair
17:27
and
17:28
miraculously walking and then the world
17:29
blows up um
17:31
but there there was a filmed custard pie
17:34
fight
17:36
and there are photos of it you can
17:37
google it and you can see uh peter says
17:39
everyone throwing cream pies at each
17:41
other
17:41
that's amazing yeah that sounds great
17:43
and he effectively went with the
17:45
shakespeare ending didn't he where
17:46
everyone dies
17:47
yeah oh yeah really um i did a little
17:50
work on nahim tate oh yeah
17:52
you know his father was called faithful
17:54
teat
17:56
[Laughter]
17:59
wow i mean that's a strong name isn't it
18:02
yeah
18:02
faithful t that's also the name of one
18:05
of the goats that went around
18:08
and then i guess he changed his name he
18:10
didn't want to be called teet anymore so
18:11
named tate must have changed it
18:13
but he was a big deal he was poet
18:14
laureate
18:16
james tate was as well i think oh sorry
18:18
that's what i mean was yeah
18:19
um while shepherds watched their vlogs
18:21
by night for the next century
18:22
it was the only carol that was allowed
18:25
in church of england
18:27
ceremonies or services really they hated
18:29
carols
18:30
but this was just religious enough to
18:31
kind of pass master but christmas would
18:33
you do the thing where you sing
18:35
eight carols but you just had to sing
18:36
while shoppers watch that vlogs by night
18:38
eight times yeah like a carol service
18:42
and if you'll now turn your pages to
18:44
carol number five
18:46
well shepherd's watched and the only
18:49
change that's been made over the last
18:50
300 years
18:51
according to wikipedia this is the only
18:53
change that's been made
18:54
has been changing the word from whilst
18:57
to wile
18:58
so from wiles to shepherds and the other
19:00
changes where they changed it to while
19:02
shepherds washed their socks
19:04
that was the other one that was the
19:06
original
19:09
um titus andronicus was also changed um
19:12
in
19:12
titan andronicus in 1850 there's
19:15
um there's this big rape scene where a
19:17
woman has her tongue cut out and her
19:19
hands cut off and it's to prevent her
19:20
spilling the names of her attackers
19:22
and that was all completely edited uh
19:24
there was a version of hamlet where
19:26
ophelia
19:27
dies from accidental drowning because it
19:28
was thought to be too upsetting that it
19:30
was suicide
19:31
it was so we you know i think people are
19:33
often saying that we're a bit too
19:34
pathetic now
19:36
yeah too snow flaky it was um bowdler
19:38
who um
19:39
did the accidental drowning wasn't it
19:40
yeah from whom we get bowed lorries
19:43
so it's a really cool like a fan theory
19:45
about him it's just a theory actually i
19:46
don't know
19:46
about baudelaire yeah so he published
19:50
this thing called the family shakespeare
19:51
because
19:52
he was saying this is something that all
19:53
families can read together so if you're
19:54
reading out to your children you don't
19:56
want to read a rape scene where
19:57
someone's got the
19:58
you know tongue cut out and hands cut
20:00
off which is kind of reasonable
20:03
so there's also lots of naughty stuff
20:05
you know there are characters who are
20:06
prostitutes and there and all that had
20:07
to go
20:08
but there's a theory that it was it
20:10
wasn't the reverend thomas baudler who
20:11
did most of the cutting it was his
20:13
sister
20:14
she did most of the cutting and she
20:16
produced the first version
20:17
but bowdler claimed to have written it
20:20
so that his sister didn't have to
20:21
publicly admit that she had understood
20:24
the root bits already that's so
20:27
funny maybe wow when he was
20:30
40 just over 40 bowdler married a lady
20:33
called elizabeth
20:34
frevenen and it was such a bad marriage
20:36
that they split up quite quickly
20:38
and nobody in the family was ever
20:40
allowed to mention elizabeth's name ever
20:42
again
20:42
so his whole life was boldlerized
20:44
basically
20:46
that's great god he was very free and
20:49
easy with editing
20:50
basically wasn't he he edited his life
20:52
out of it
20:55
queen victoria said she'd never had the
20:56
courage to see the merry wives of
20:58
windsor
20:59
she wrote to her daughter who was a
21:01
shakespeare fan she'd never had the
21:02
courage to see it because she'd always
21:03
been told how very course it was
21:05
and um it's very boring i've never read
21:08
or seen that one
21:09
there's a people say that he wrote it in
21:10
nine days and
21:12
i'll be honest i'm staggered it took him
21:14
that long to write
21:16
it's the least good i've ever maybe she
21:18
just said it was really dull but
21:20
didn't want to upset shakespeare fans i
21:22
said i've heard it's too rude
21:24
yeah she didn't she found him a bit too
21:25
coarse for her taste generally
21:27
there have been 24 operas based on romeo
21:29
and juliet
21:30
wow the earliest it was called romeo and
21:32
julie
21:35
which is quite cool and that has a happy
21:36
ending and also
21:38
if you um go on fanfic.com and look for
21:42
some fan fiction on romeo and juliet
21:43
there is a thing called romeo and juliet
21:45
happy ending
21:47
um and at the end it's just it's like a
21:49
final
21:50
scene of romeo and juliet and it says
21:52
days become days and years become years
21:54
and one day freya lawrence
21:55
gets a letter saying that juliet had
21:57
died in her sleep
21:58
and later that year he gets the same
22:00
letter from the montagues that romeo's
22:02
died in his sleep
22:03
that's a nice ending isn't it but he's
22:05
he's substantially older than both those
22:07
characters
22:07
yeah so they've still died quite young
22:09
yeah yeah
22:11
i just got one more thing about um
22:13
modern day
22:15
about modern day kind of censorship and
22:17
prudishness
22:18
so did you see that cambridge university
22:20
put trigger warnings on lots of
22:22
shakespeare lectures and people got
22:24
really exercised about this yeah
22:26
i just feel like some flowers who
22:27
couldn't really deal with
22:29
the sunflowers yeah um so i think this
22:32
is why this conversation article came
22:33
out it was saying don't worry people
22:35
have always done this
22:36
but if you take english literature at
22:38
cambridge
22:39
then if you go to a lecture for instance
22:41
on titus andronicus or
22:42
in fact on euripides the back eye that's
22:45
another one that has them then you get a
22:46
little
22:47
one of those exclamation marks in a red
22:48
triangle at the end of the lecture which
22:51
is to say this might contain some
22:52
traumatic scenes oh my god
22:54
yeah if you have been troubled by any of
22:56
the themes in titus andronicus
23:00
you've had a ruffled life actually yeah
23:02
um that is tough
23:04
if you if your sons have been baked in a
23:06
pie
23:10
[Music]
23:13
okay let's move on to fact number three
23:15
and that is andy's facts
23:17
my fact is that some advertisers have
23:19
started putting single pixels on mobile
23:21
phone ads so you think it's
23:22
dust try to wipe it off and accidentally
23:24
click on the advert
23:26
it is genius that is so good yeah
23:29
so i've only found one advertiser that's
23:31
done this there's a great article on
23:32
medium called 52 things i learned this
23:34
year and this is one of the 52 things
23:36
but it doesn't really work right i've
23:39
read another article i think it was i'm
23:40
not sure where
23:41
where i read this but um basically they
23:43
said if you get paid for every time
23:45
someone taps on it
23:46
then it works but if you're trying to
23:48
get actual sales then it pisses people
23:50
off so much
23:51
that people end up not buying stuff i
23:53
guess they must be thinking
23:55
the product is so good that someone will
23:56
end up buying it
23:58
and what was the product uh oh i can't
24:00
remember i'm afraid i do
24:01
another one who's done a really similar
24:03
thing there's a chinese trainer
24:04
manufacturer
24:06
and they've put a thing that looks like
24:07
a hair across their advert
24:10
and you swipe to get rid of the hair and
24:12
you go straight to their website
24:13
yeah but they got banned from instagram
24:16
didn't they
24:17
apparently it violated instagram's
24:19
policies and was removed and the
24:21
instagram shut down the entire brand's
24:23
account wow
24:24
because of that yeah i can't believe
24:26
it's not counterproductive
24:28
i like you say it's just so irritating
24:30
there was a study a few years ago
24:32
that found that 50 percent of ad clicks
24:34
on phones
24:35
are accidental i don't understand i'm
24:37
surprised it's that low
24:39
i don't think i've ever intentionally
24:40
clicked on one your phone is so smashed
24:43
up
24:43
that if there was something that looked
24:44
a bit like a hair you would never see it
24:46
no absolutely not this this bit would
24:48
not work on me at all
24:50
another thing it reminded me of is and i
24:51
was desperately looking for like a
24:53
source for it but it's something my
24:54
american
24:54
grandmother told me and i've heard it
24:56
mentioned on american podcast as well
24:57
that
24:58
in the old days when you were making a
24:59
telephone call and you call into the
25:01
exchange
25:02
you had you could choose which company
25:04
would carry your call so which one would
25:05
get your
25:06
money right really wow so and but most
25:08
people the most common answer was
25:09
you know i don't care whatever whichever
25:11
one you choose and so
25:13
people started phone companies called i
25:16
don't care it doesn't matter whatever
25:17
you want
25:18
and they'd rake in this sort of extra
25:20
incredible yeah it's genius
25:22
do you know on the internet if you click
25:25
on a naughty site
25:26
you might get a whole load of pop-ups
25:28
right loads of
25:29
yeah things oh you do know that i've
25:31
read about it
25:33
my pornographer's digest they're called
25:36
uh
25:36
tornadoes or pawn storms
25:40
this is a phrase coined by john c dvorak
25:44
uh who is the nephew of the guy who
25:45
invented the dvorak keyboard
25:48
which is like a qwerty keyboard but it's
25:50
supposed to be slightly better than the
25:52
qwerty keyboard
25:53
that's a step down isn't it in
25:54
father-son invention terms
25:57
yeah well davoshak is he writes a lot
26:00
about um computers and he said
26:02
that the reason apple's mac macintosh
26:05
computer would not be successful
26:06
is because it uses a pointing device
26:08
called a mouse and there is no evidence
26:10
that people want to use these things
26:13
and then he wrote about steve jobs maybe
26:15
when the smoke clears we will have heard
26:16
the last of steve jobs as guru seer
26:19
visionary
26:20
he'll go the way of the pet rock
26:22
electric carving knives silly putty tiny
26:25
tim
26:25
and the three-tone paint job that's not
26:28
really rough on tiny tim
26:29
yeah a load of lotus not bringing
26:32
products and then one of the most
26:33
heart-rending characters
26:36
that's so mean
26:40
i can only imagine maybe tiny tim is
26:42
something else in america right
26:44
i guess so probably like a failed
26:45
product or something but like you know
26:48
it'll go the way of sea monkeys nasal
26:50
hair trimmers
26:51
and jude the obscure weird
26:54
bug um do you know why pop-up ads were
26:58
originally
26:58
um conceived no it was because
27:03
advertisers didn't want to be associated
27:05
with dodgy website content so it's kind
27:07
of the opposite of problems that
27:08
websites have now where sometimes dodgy
27:10
adverts pop up on them
27:11
uh so they were invented by a guy called
27:13
mr zuckerman in the 1990s
27:15
and it was because a car company got
27:17
upset because it bought a banner advert
27:19
on a page that happened to be about anal
27:21
sex
27:22
which they thought wasn't um on brand
27:25
for their car company
27:26
it's unlikely to be on brand for any car
27:28
company well exactly there's so little
27:30
overlap there
27:31
and so he made pop-up ads to kind of
27:33
distinguish them from each other
27:35
and he said that yeah but what's wrong
27:37
with this
27:39
okay it's just a kind of sex guy i know
27:42
it's the way you say a page that
27:43
happened to be about
27:44
it by chance it was an anal sex team
27:49
page
27:50
they exist i suppose so they're out
27:52
there
27:53
hang on the the car adverts were popping
27:56
up on this
27:56
themed page yeah yeah right there's all
27:58
sorts of things popping up
28:02
they weren't up for it so he designed
28:03
them this pop-up thing which is supposed
28:05
to say
28:05
look this pop-up has nothing to do with
28:06
the content of this webpage but he's
28:08
really apologized for it now he says he
28:10
feels terribly guilty because he knows
28:11
that pop-ups are the most annoying thing
28:13
on the internet but his intentions were
28:15
good he didn't want cars to be
28:17
associated with
28:18
sexual positions so other stupid
28:21
creative ways of advertising
28:23
um dominoes this year advertised in
28:25
potholes
28:26
so this is a thing where they've now got
28:28
a sideline in fixing potholes on roads
28:30
across america
28:31
and you can actually request that they
28:33
come and fix your pothole if you're in
28:34
america
28:35
and i i think it's an advertising
28:37
campaign otherwise they're just really
28:38
good guys but it's called
28:40
it's called paving for pizza and they
28:43
partner with various like local
28:44
administrations
28:45
and say hey have you got any potholes i
28:47
need doing and they send out their pizza
28:48
delivery guys who do a sideline in kind
28:51
of tarmac filling
28:52
and then they fill in the potholes and
28:53
then they fill in the hole with a little
28:54
domino's pizza
28:58
it's not very long-lasting at all wow
29:02
that's quite good isn't it that's a good
29:03
idea so they get their logo on the road
29:05
but everyone gets
29:06
flat roads so everyone's a winner wow
29:09
apart from the other pizza manufacturers
29:11
yeah papa john is furious
29:14
the justification was that potholes
29:16
damaged pizzas so they're actually
29:18
saving the pizzas because on the way
29:20
they'll get bumped up and down they
29:21
actually put a gopro inside a pizza box
29:24
had people watch the traumatic journey
29:26
they have to go through
29:28
to make it to their destination wow yeah
29:32
kfc advertises on fire hydrants uh they
29:35
did this i think a couple of years ago
29:36
they'll
29:37
pay people to let them fix their fire
29:40
hydrants if they're broken they did this
29:41
in indianapolis
29:42
so they paid i think five thousand
29:44
dollars to say can we fix your fire
29:45
hydrant and the town was like yeah
29:47
great and then they sort of put some kfc
29:49
advertising on top of it but they do
29:51
also fill up the fire hydrant with
29:52
chicken but then all the fires smell
29:54
delicious
29:58
you don't mind burning to a crisp with a
29:59
delicious smell of kfc all around you
30:08
okay on to our final fact of the week
30:11
and that is james's fact
30:12
okay my fact this week is that one of
30:14
the most popular celebrities in london
30:16
in 1860 in 1860 was an oyster who could
30:20
whistle
30:23
one of the most popular is so exciting
30:25
also who could whistle
30:26
not that good it was a person well once
30:29
you whistle you get personhood i think i
30:31
think so
30:32
um it didn't have a name a bit like that
30:34
goat actually yeah
30:36
thinking about it um but yes so
30:39
i mean what is the most popular i'm
30:41
saying it's the most popular because a
30:43
lot of people went to see it
30:44
yeah it was in panto
30:48
that's quite popular but this is a guy
30:51
called george
30:52
perks p-e-a-r-k-e-s and he was an
30:56
oysterman and a dealer in spruce ginger
30:58
beer and british wines
30:59
so he's a wine cellar and an oyster
31:01
seller and he was sleeping in his house
31:03
and he was kept awake every night by
31:05
this whistle
31:07
no he wasn't he really was he really was
31:10
and so he thought that it was a
31:11
policeman who was walking past everyday
31:13
whistling
31:15
so anyway so um the whistling got louder
31:17
and louder and then
31:18
eventually he thought he was being
31:19
burgled he said i presumably buy a
31:21
whistling
31:25
i don't know why a burglar would whistle
31:27
but yeah he did that and eventually he
31:28
went downstairs with a pistol to get
31:30
this burglar
31:31
and he found out that the source of the
31:32
sound was one of his oysters
31:35
and it seems that what might have
31:36
happened is that the oyster had a little
31:38
hole in it and whenever it was filtering
31:39
food so moving the water
31:41
backwards and forwards it was making the
31:42
whistling sound right okay and
31:45
as soon as this became well known it was
31:46
mentioned in punch and a few other
31:48
things suddenly everyone came around and
31:50
wanted to see this oyster that could
31:52
whistle
31:53
uh and even william make peace thackery
31:55
went to see it and
31:56
wrote about it uh and he said that he
31:59
was there when an american gentleman
32:01
declared that the oyster could not hold
32:02
a candle to one
32:04
he knew of in massachusetts that could
32:06
whistle yankee doodle from beginning to
32:08
end no he couldn't i don't think that
32:09
one's street
32:11
there is definitely was this oyster in
32:13
1860
32:14
and it was famous and it was in london
32:16
and it could whistle that's amazing
32:18
it's mad sorry i've been reading a book
32:19
by thakore so the idea of this literary
32:21
hero going to see the whistling oyster
32:23
on his day off is incredible
32:25
can you see the influence of the
32:26
whistling oyster on the kind of plot and
32:28
themes
32:29
absolutely yeah yeah imagine having that
32:32
guy working as your
32:34
pr man because that is an unbelievable
32:36
pr trick just claim you've got a
32:37
whistling oyster managed to get half of
32:39
london to come and see it
32:40
it's amazing why they why how boring was
32:42
life
32:44
life was hard yeah but i mean if there
32:46
was a
32:47
this was in covent garden right which is
32:48
where we are now if
32:50
there was 100 meters away there was a
32:53
whistling oyster which you'd read about
32:54
in a magazine
32:56
are you telling me as a qi researcher
32:58
that you wouldn't be curious enough to
32:59
go and see it
33:00
i do get pretty desperate to get away
33:01
from you guys i might go and see it
33:03
i don't do people pay they didn't pay
33:06
only with their time
33:08
they didn't they but it meant that he
33:10
got people into his shop
33:11
uh and then the oyster like i said made
33:14
a cameo appearance
33:15
in a pantomime staged at drury lane in
33:17
1860 that's
33:18
incredible who did he play dick
33:21
whittington
33:22
he mostly played some whistling
33:24
character
33:26
with a shell it would be really funny
33:29
though to dress the oyster up in a big
33:30
costume wouldn't it it would be amazing
33:32
put a little bindle over his shoulder
33:33
yeah
33:34
in the 1830s just on paying for
33:37
attractions
33:38
in the 1830s you could pay a shilling to
33:40
see a vars
33:43
could it even whistle i didn't even
33:45
whistle maybe if you blew into it the
33:46
right way
33:47
it was the royal clarence vaz it was
33:50
made for king george the fourth
33:51
took workers three years which is too
33:53
long to make one vasquez
33:55
and you go to it wow
33:58
didn't even have flowers in it what was
33:59
on it uh don't don't know
34:02
it was kind of got it was made partly of
34:03
gold and glass and enamel i remember
34:06
i paid i paid 20 quid to go and see
34:09
damian hurst's skull which had diamonds
34:11
on it that's not much worse than that is
34:13
it no you're right you're
34:14
you're a dupe oh
34:16
[Laughter]
34:18
i've got another famous oyster this is
34:21
from the sailors magazine of 1840
34:23
um which have not checked how reliable
34:25
it is in general
34:27
this is what they say there's a
34:29
gentleman from christchurch in salisbury
34:31
who keeps a pet oyster of the largest
34:33
and finest breed
34:35
it has proved itself an excellent mauser
34:38
having already killed
34:41
having already killed five mice by
34:44
crushing the heads
34:45
of such as tempted by it as a meal um
34:48
they had the temerity to intrude their
34:50
noses within his bivalvular clutches
34:52
and then he crushed their heads so
34:55
that's not true is it
34:56
would you say you haven't checked what
34:57
was it the sailor's newsletter sailors
35:00
magazine
35:01
1840 yeah it doesn't sound very true
35:03
does it
35:04
yeah i think you have checked it and you
35:05
found it to be wanting
35:07
in terms of truthfulness um
35:10
new orleans uh there used to be an act
35:13
just
35:13
just trying to find things about
35:15
celebrities and oysters yeah
35:17
so there used to be an act in new
35:18
orleans um this is actually a lady who
35:21
was elvis presley's cousin
35:22
she was called kitty west and she had an
35:25
act
35:26
called evangeline the oyster girl in the
35:28
1940s uh which was a strip tease
35:31
which began in an enormous and slowly
35:33
opening oyster shell
35:35
oh so like that is it butterchelly
35:37
painting where she's inside a huge clam
35:39
exactly yeah venus of exactly like that
35:42
but how does she make the shell
35:43
open because you have to get
35:44
professional shockers to be able to open
35:46
an ointment
35:47
i think there's a professional shocker
35:48
by the side a massive lever
35:51
would be funny if the act was a slowly
35:53
closing oyster
35:56
i was looking for um like entertainers
35:58
like the oyster that we might have found
36:00
around covent garden yeah and there's uh
36:01
you could have seen in 1830 spelterini
36:04
and his living ass
36:06
and there's a poster of him and he looks
36:08
incredible so what he did is he
36:10
had a ladder in his teeth and at the top
36:12
of a ladder was a donkey
36:14
and in his two hands he held 56 pound
36:17
weights
36:17
so he was balancing a donkey on the top
36:20
of a ladder held in his mouth
36:22
wow i'm kind of impressed by the donkey
36:24
as well being able to stay at the top of
36:26
a ladder that's a pretty chilled out
36:27
donkey
36:28
yeah yeah yeah it's incredible so and
36:30
apparently
36:31
there was a liverpudlian guy called sam
36:33
wilde who did the same thing
36:34
and when they were knobbing the crowd
36:36
which is just
36:39
the name for passing around the hat yeah
36:41
yeah yeah yeah
36:42
um and they'd say oh we gotta have just
36:44
one more shilling ladies and gentlemen
36:45
then up goes the donkey
36:47
that is amazing that's a quick thinking
36:49
performer who's been cheating on his
36:51
wife
36:51
i was knobbing the crowd last night
36:52
which is when we ran around the hat of
36:55
course
36:56
um amazing that you had one guy who's
36:58
doing that and he was obviously so
36:59
popular that another guy decided i'm
37:01
gonna do that exact same thing how hard
37:02
could it be
37:03
it's like the guys in yoda masks isn't
37:05
it it's like a much more impressive
37:06
version of that yeah yeah
37:08
you frequently have three or four guys
37:09
in your masks you do and similarly with
37:11
them and with this guy you think they
37:12
just
37:13
do one little twist like maybe have a
37:15
goat not a donkey
37:16
maybe we have a gandalf mask not a yoga
37:19
mask yeah
37:20
bryn's got talent would have been
37:21
amazing back in the old days it really
37:22
worked if today there was a girl in
37:23
britain's got talent who had 56 pound
37:25
weights in either hand and a donkey on a
37:27
ladder in his teeth
37:28
he would win for me the final
37:30
immediately but really you need to kind
37:32
of
37:33
diversify for the later rounds don't you
37:35
because you can't just do
37:36
you can't just turn up and do the same
37:38
thing again can you
37:39
i've never watched it but i assume they
37:41
do different things i guess you must
37:43
and that's the tragedy of britain's got
37:44
talent because this guy deserves to win
37:46
forever
37:46
but you could dumb it down so you could
37:48
start by holding a chair with a cat on
37:49
it
37:50
[Laughter]
37:53
so one thing you mentioned uh policemen
37:56
and whistles
37:57
and i i did wonder when about that what
38:00
did
38:00
they use what did we use before whistles
38:02
right and it
38:03
might be common knowledge but in um the
38:06
design of the police whistle came in in
38:08
like 1883
38:10
and it was out of a competition a guy
38:11
called joseph hudson
38:13
but before that they had hand rattles
38:15
the
38:17
that's police good like soccer referees
38:19
use whistles but before that they used
38:21
to just wave handkerchiefs
38:22
or something but that's he also
38:26
designed the referee whistle really and
38:28
then he also made something called the
38:29
acme thunderer which is a pea whistle oh
38:32
i've got um you've got my parents have
38:34
one in the house and that can be
38:35
thunderer
38:36
yeah really yeah is that how they kept
38:37
you in check
38:43
no i was too much of a sunflower for
38:45
that they just waved a handkerchief for
38:47
me when i was being naughty
38:49
um you're not supposed to eat oysters in
38:51
a month with the letter
38:53
r are you that's an old yeah
38:56
but it seems kind of possibly probably
38:58
quite true uh
39:00
certainly in the olden days where
39:01
shellfish would spoil in the heat
39:03
because they
39:03
are months and mostly in the in the
39:05
summer uh but also that usually is a
39:07
spawning season so most of their energy
39:09
goes towards reproduction
39:11
yeah it's because um when they go into
39:13
their spawning seasons in your
39:14
months then they basically turn
39:16
completely into gonads
39:17
they are fully made of testicles and
39:19
ovaries so all
39:20
oyster tissue transforms when they're
39:23
spawning into reproductive organs it's
39:25
like all of yourself
39:26
just turning into a bunch of testicles
39:28
that's a period of time
39:29
it's quite i mean that would make the
39:32
dating scene a lot easier wouldn't it
39:34
because you would know if someone was
39:36
upset
39:37
yeah because they turned into a testicle
39:41
you still want to make sure you're an
39:42
attractive enough testicle or ovary
39:44
with a good enough sense of humor let's
39:47
get
39:48
you into an uber shall we handle a huge
39:51
testicle into the booth
39:56
[Music]
39:57
okay that's it that's all of our facts
40:00
thank you so much for listening we'll be
40:01
back again next week with another four
40:03
facts
40:04
and in the meantime you can catch us on
40:05
our twitter feed so you can catch these
40:07
guys on their twitter feed so james is
40:08
on
40:09
james harkin andy's on andrew hunter m
40:11
ed is
40:12
at fox tosser the look of pain on your
40:16
face when you knew you had to say it but
40:17
you made that for yourself no i didn't
40:19
my publisher did it
40:20
but that's fair enough uh you can get me
40:23
on podcast
40:24
ui.com and you can listen to all our
40:26
previous episodes by going to no such
40:28
things as fish.com
40:29
you can go to qi.com fish events to get
40:33
tickets for our tour
40:34
and also there's loads of information on
40:35
that no such thing as a fish site on our
40:37
book
40:38
and what's your book called in called
40:40
the golden atlas
40:41
and you can get that in book shops
40:43
presumably everywhere hopefully
40:45
everywhere
40:46
all over the world it is a beautiful
40:47
book you should definitely get it as
40:49
soon as you've got ours obviously or buy
40:50
them at once
40:52
and we'll be back again next week see
40:54
you then goodbye
41:07
you

[Applause]
00:13
hello
00:14
and welcome to another episode of no
00:16
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:19
this week coming to you from our book of
00:21
the year 2018
00:22
tour live from the union chapel in
00:25
[Music]
00:28
london
00:36
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
00:38
here with anna chazinski andrew hunter
00:41
murray and
00:41
james harkin and once again we have
00:43
gathered around the microphones with our
00:45
four
00:45
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:47
and in no particular order
00:49
here we go starting with fact number one
00:52
and that's my fact this week
00:54
my fact is the world's oldest krill
00:58
was nine years old and was called alan
01:03
it's called alan he was called alan he
01:05
was a nine-year-old krill and allen
01:06
would have lived to have been older but
01:08
unfortunately during a routine cleaning
01:10
of his tank he escaped and fell down a
01:12
drain
01:13
so yeah it's a shame because he possibly
01:16
had many more years maybe he survived
01:18
the drainful as well maybe like finding
01:19
nemo like he might
01:20
still be out there finding allen isn't
01:22
less good
01:24
less good title and he might be more
01:26
than nine as well because when they
01:28
caught him he was an adult
01:29
so he probably at least two more years
01:31
on top of that wow
01:32
how do you escape as a krill because
01:35
mostly you're water-based aren't you
01:36
but presumably he had to sort of
01:38
struggle out along some surfaces
01:40
they were changing the tanks so they
01:41
were cleaning the water out so it was in
01:43
the process of taking the lid off and
01:45
exchanging waters that alan thought
01:47
finally after nine years
01:49
it's my chance yeah but unfortunately
01:51
there was a drain right next to it well
01:53
he was kept
01:54
in um his own jar um for all those nine
01:57
years
01:57
uh by a guy called tom ikeda who is like
01:59
one of the best krill
02:01
scientists in the world i mean you all
02:02
know him yeah that's
02:04
i mean we are actually gonna do 20
02:06
minutes about krill
02:09
but he they found out that he was this
02:11
age probably about 11 and that is about
02:13
five times longer than any krill have
02:14
been known to be alive in the past
02:16
wow that was the first time we found out
02:17
that they might be this old and actually
02:19
that had huge repercussions for the
02:21
krill
02:22
farming industry and the world
02:25
at large so there's an interesting thing
02:27
about krill so
02:28
they are the biggest species on earth by
02:32
biomass biggest wild species on earth so
02:35
humans all of us all together weigh
02:37
about 350 million
02:38
tons um cows beat us
02:42
they win they have 650 million tons by
02:44
you know all of them but they're kind of
02:45
domesticated so
02:46
but krill which are not domesticated
02:48
just you try
02:50
um it can't be done
02:53
well for nine years you can keep one in
02:54
a jar you can imprison it but you can
02:56
never tame his soul
02:59
good old alan always free at heart
03:03
krill all the crew in the world were 379
03:06
million tons so they beat humans in a
03:08
fight they
03:09
would yeah it would be a weird weird old
03:13
fight i think we can all agree that
03:14
and that's just one type of krill right
03:16
that's just the antarctic krill species
03:18
um so they're the ones often when people
03:20
say krill they're actually talking about
03:22
antarctic krill bear that in mind
03:24
but there are actually about 85 species
03:26
but yeah antarctic krill
03:28
are outweighing us it's incredible and
03:31
also they're so they swim in these big
03:33
swarms right so they can be up to
03:35
20 kilometers these swarms that you see
03:37
in the ocean and some are so big that
03:39
they've been spotted from space
03:41
you can see some of the swarms not some
03:43
of the krill okay
03:45
no no krill is bigger than about two and
03:47
a half inches
03:48
this is the swarms okay right yeah no
03:52
obviously the
03:53
swarms um yeah they're tiny but they
03:56
yeah they swim in these huge
03:57
lumps and um yeah and most of them are
04:00
doing that aren't they so
04:01
i think basically the vast majority of
04:04
your antarctic krill
04:05
are in five or six swarms around the
04:08
antarctic at any one time about
04:10
70 of the biomass in the whole antarctic
04:14
region will be in these four or five or
04:16
six
04:17
big swarms of krill they love flocking
04:19
together we don't really know why they
04:20
swarm together
04:21
we can't tell why it's particularly
04:23
useful in fact it's actively almost
04:25
sometimes
04:25
not useful right because they're eaten
04:27
by almost
04:28
everything else that lives around them
04:30
yeah and once they get together that
04:32
just gives them a bigger meal on their
04:34
plate
04:34
i don't get it it's been an exciting few
04:36
decades for krill discoveries
04:38
because we've just
04:41
absolutely just blown our minds with new
04:43
information as the years have gone by
04:45
the age of ellen the age of alan um it
04:47
was also i call it the age of allen
04:49
actually
04:49
yes in the krill world that's what it's
04:51
known as yes you're right
04:52
it's yeah it's that period and um so tom
04:56
um akida he was uh the person who also
04:58
discovered that they could survive for
05:00
over 200 days
05:01
of starvation yeah i don't know if like
05:03
if that was
05:04
forgotten because it's amazing to think
05:05
about what krill do when they're hungry
05:06
okay this is so weird
05:08
so they they uh they repeatedly molt
05:10
throughout their life they molt and then
05:11
they they grow a bit and then they molt
05:13
again
05:14
but when they're not fed they shrink
05:17
after they molt and this is really rare
05:18
and animals that size basically nothing
05:20
else does it
05:21
but the way you can tell how old a krill
05:23
is but after it's molted
05:24
is because their eyes stay the same size
05:27
so you can tell
05:29
how hungry acryl is by the ratio of its
05:32
eye size to the length of the rest of
05:34
the krill
05:35
so its eyes are literally bigger than
05:37
its stomach
05:40
and the malting thing that you just
05:41
mentioned they they can molt
05:44
when they're being attacked it's a it's
05:46
a defense mechanism up there so
05:48
if you're a predator coming up to a
05:49
krill and you think you've got it
05:51
he's gone and he's just shedded his
05:54
exterior
05:55
and you're holding on to it thinking yes
05:57
this is gonna be yummy and then you've
05:58
just it's like i've got just
05:59
the skin of you imagine being in you're
06:01
gone imagine being able to do that
06:03
it's useful but also is it yummy because
06:05
actually i don't think you imagined
06:07
being able to do that for long enough
06:10
someone i'm sorry grabbed you in a
06:13
pub fight yeah yeah it's just like
06:15
taking a jacket off
06:17
i reckon the game of rugby would be very
06:19
bad in the krill world wouldn't it
06:20
because yeah
06:21
you'd never be able to be tackled all
06:23
the players would end up about one third
06:25
high
06:25
because they repeatedly shed themselves
06:27
imagine going on a first date and
06:29
finding out two hours later that she
06:30
left
06:31
in the first horse this has been a great
06:35
night
06:35
hello sorry anna
06:39
um i feel like no it's okay i didn't
06:41
take your question seriously enough
06:43
don't you feel better now that we've
06:45
sufficiently imagined it yeah
06:47
i think i think we're done now um so
06:50
another way
06:53
you know um another superpower that
06:55
krill have is that they can go through
06:56
reverse puberty reverse puberty
07:00
yeah oh cool okay they can downsize and
07:02
use their protein from their body as
07:04
fuel so adults just molt repeatedly
07:07
until they look like juveniles again and
07:08
they lose all their sexual
07:10
characteristics
07:11
really so they just yeah that's a bit
07:13
traumatic for your partner isn't it when
07:15
they wake up the next day
07:16
um but if we're on krill superpowers
07:20
they have bioluminescence and really
07:23
advanced bioluminescence so
07:25
you could basically use acryl as a torch
07:27
and so bioluminescence is when you can
07:29
create your own light
07:30
using the bacteria that basically live
07:32
in you and then krill these bacteria
07:34
live on their eye stalks and on their
07:35
hips
07:36
and in their genitals and they can
07:38
control the light that these
07:41
um that these bacteria give off so they
07:43
have literally have kind of a light
07:44
switch
07:45
and the way this works is that basically
07:47
they can show the amount of
07:48
oxygen that gets to them so they have a
07:51
switch in their sphincters
07:52
which if they tighten it up it's a very
07:55
convenient place to put a switch
07:57
you certainly don't want other people
07:58
using it um but when they turn the
08:01
switch on
08:01
they send a flood of oxygen to these
08:03
bacteria and then they light up like a
08:05
torch like a blue torch
08:06
and you can like it's amazing can you
08:10
you i don't think you could you probably
08:11
didn't have small enough fingers but um
08:15
they can turn on their own light
08:16
switches i also read that in the 1960s
08:20
um
08:20
scientists figured out that you could
08:21
make them permanently glow by giving
08:23
them lsd
08:26
what a decade it was for just giving lsd
08:28
to different things
08:32
and we need to move on soon um but no
08:35
more krill
08:38
so i'm the the krill
08:41
so krill have this enzyme right that no
08:44
one else in the animal kingdom has
08:46
and also it's really hard for us to make
08:47
in the lab and no one's managed to do it
08:49
yet
08:49
uh and it seems like it might become
08:51
really useful in the future if we can
08:53
farm krill we might be able to use it
08:54
and there's a load of patents in the u.s
08:57
for things that it might be used for and
08:59
one of them in particular i think is a
09:00
bit dubious
09:01
but they claim that they've patented
09:03
krill enzymes and that they can cure
09:06
athlete's foot four skin infections
09:11
under there she'll be right no worries
09:16
eye infections gum infections herpes
09:18
acne
09:19
eczema cancer hiv hemorrhoids
09:22
wrinkles warts diarrhea boldness and
09:25
leprosy
09:28
i must stress that this is all unproven
09:30
at the moment
09:31
[Music]
09:33
well also something you shouldn't
09:34
believe about them that we've been told
09:35
over the last year
09:36
is that they can save us from the
09:38
plastic disaster
09:39
so it was quite well covered in a lot of
09:41
newspapers at the start of this year
09:42
that
09:42
there's a cruel species that can digest
09:45
plastic
09:46
so everyone like headlines said could
09:48
krill be the secret saviors of our
09:49
plastic polluted seas the answer is
09:51
emphatically no
09:52
they make it worse so basically they
09:54
digest microplastics and all they're
09:56
doing is turning them into little
09:57
nanoplastics which are just even smaller
09:59
even more likely to be swallowed by
10:01
other fish and even more likely to get
10:02
into our own human tissue but surely if
10:04
we make them small enough the problem
10:05
goes away
10:07
it will never disappear the answer is
10:09
the answer is never the magic krill is
10:11
it it's always using less plastic which
10:13
is
10:13
yeah i'm afraid um we need to move on uh
10:17
if you guys didn't get a full fix of
10:20
krill from that just said
10:21
um there is an amazing book which is
10:23
where we know about this fact from our
10:24
our boss of qi john lloyd actually found
10:26
this fact uh so we should acknowledge uh
10:28
his brilliant find and
10:29
it's called the curious life of krill
10:31
it's a brilliant book and so um
10:33
yeah um okay it is time for fact number
10:38
two
10:38
and that is chozinski yes my fact
10:41
is that uh fdr used to hold cocktail
10:44
parties during the war where the only
10:46
rule was
10:47
don't mention the war
10:51
an fbi fdr otr so president roosevelt
10:54
ii um president franklin roosevelt held
10:57
these parties
10:57
he was the original basel faulty
10:59
basically
11:01
and i learned this this is in a book
11:02
called leadership in turbulent times
11:04
it's by a woman called doris goodwin who
11:06
i think is basically
11:07
the presidential biographer and you know
11:10
the
11:10
leading white house historian of all
11:12
time and she wrote a book about how
11:14
presidents
11:15
unwind and how important it is as the
11:17
president to do that
11:18
and yeah apparently he was very good at
11:19
it he used to host these parties
11:21
every week and they were a happy hour he
11:23
used to actually call them a children's
11:25
hour
11:25
weirdly and he loved mixing martinis
11:28
roosevelt was a huge martini fan so he
11:30
mixed the martinis himself and the one
11:31
proviso was
11:32
you can't talk about the wall and the
11:34
only exception to that was eleanor his
11:36
wife because she was so serious-minded
11:38
and sincere that she
11:39
had to talk about the war all the bloody
11:41
time who did she talk to
11:43
the wall put her in a corner facing the
11:47
wall
11:47
you say that he was good at uh mixing
11:50
and throwing these things but i've read
11:52
all a lot of reports saying that he was
11:54
terrible at making cocktails who was he
11:56
yeah people didn't like them all he
11:58
he got experimental on them he would
12:00
throw just ingredients that he thought
12:01
were interesting so he would
12:03
combine garnish of olives with lemon
12:04
peels he'd be like this is going to be
12:06
great
12:07
sounds good it sounds good but he would
12:09
just overdo it with too many ingredients
12:10
so they famously know that there was a
12:12
big supreme court justice who used to
12:14
just walk over
12:15
to a potted plant and pour his cocktail
12:17
in every time because he just couldn't
12:19
they couldn't stand drinking these
12:20
cocktails really yeah but you're gonna
12:22
obviously you're not gonna just say to
12:24
the president of the united states of
12:25
america
12:26
this is a crap contest the other thing
12:28
he used to do was he used to get people
12:30
quite tipsy so he would get people maybe
12:32
onto their third or fourth drink while
12:34
he was still slowly nursing his first
12:36
one so i think some people thought that
12:37
wasn't really
12:38
fair yeah everyone hates that guy was he
12:40
that guy
12:41
i think he might have been he tried to
12:43
do that to the entire nation
12:45
not all of us can drink as quickly as
12:46
you is that really
12:48
next to you anna we're all that guy it's
12:51
very annoying when people fall behind
12:53
um but yeah he was responsible for
12:55
prohibition wasn't he not
12:56
sorry for stopping prohibition because
12:59
he was quite pro-alcohol
13:01
and i was reading quite a funny thing
13:02
about that so april the sixth apparently
13:05
in america
13:06
is new beer's eve are there any
13:08
americans
13:09
here have you heard of that
13:13
right well you should be celebrating so
13:15
this is the night when at midnight
13:17
um in 19 1933
13:21
i want to say 34. um this prohibition
13:24
was stopped
13:25
so there's no way i could edit that to
13:27
make it
13:32
should have written that down in 1933
13:36
in 1934
13:40
basically he said the prohibition ends
13:42
at midnight at 1201 you can all start
13:44
getting boost up again and in chicago
13:47
they realized that people on the east
13:48
coast were going to be allowed to drink
13:50
before they were because they were a
13:51
couple of hours behind and so an
13:53
illinois house representative
13:54
launched this whole massive campaign
13:56
saying chicago's clocks
13:58
need to be moved permanently forward two
14:00
hours to make sure that we
14:02
can start drinking at what would
14:03
otherwise be 10 p.m and he kept on
14:05
petitioning
14:06
you know the local parliament the you
14:08
know local politicians
14:09
saying we need to move the clocks
14:11
forward and they didn't chicago
14:13
did not agree to move its clocks forward
14:14
just so they could get another two hours
14:15
of boozing
14:16
that's a shame um roosevelt on just
14:19
things he did for fun because he had a
14:20
load of hobbies and he was a really
14:21
interesting guy
14:22
so he he loved detective stories and he
14:24
thought of a plot for a detective story
14:26
but he wanted to involve other people in
14:29
it so he
14:30
came up with this plan he would get a
14:31
lot of the best detective authors of the
14:33
day
14:34
he would give them all the plot but the
14:35
book was written as a round robin
14:37
so he wrote the first chapter yeah with
14:39
and that all the chapters ended on a
14:41
cliffhanger
14:41
and then the next author would write the
14:43
next chapter getting the hero out of
14:45
trouble
14:46
but then by the end of the chapter he'd
14:47
be in trouble again and
14:49
then and that went on the whole book was
14:51
like that and then the book ended on a
14:52
cliffhanger
14:54
yeah yeah it was finally finished about
14:55
30 years later
14:57
really yeah that's like a huge game of
14:58
consequences yeah exactly
15:00
and it was turned into a film right the
15:02
president's mystery story was turned
15:04
into a film the year after
15:06
wow which apparently it was a terrible
15:07
film
15:09
he liked collecting uh he did that
15:12
before he was president and then when he
15:14
was president he invented 200 new stamps
15:16
so he could collect those as well
15:18
[Laughter]
15:20
that's so clever no it's cheating
15:25
um he also he he is said to have coined
15:28
so someone's been looking into the
15:29
phrase off the record
15:31
and the earliest citation that this
15:33
person was looking for found it to be
15:34
from him he was the first person to use
15:36
it and the
15:37
citation was made in a newspaper that
15:40
was published
15:41
it's actually very hard to find
15:42
citations of the phrase
15:46
exactly i think it's because he really
15:49
drilled it home
15:50
on his opening encounter with it so
15:51
north carolina newspaper
15:53
the daily times this is from november
15:55
19th
15:57
um
15:57
[Laughter]
16:00
1932. uh it says he roosevelt said that
16:04
he was going to talk
16:05
off the record and that it was mighty
16:07
nice to be able to talk
16:09
off the record for a change that he
16:10
hoped to be able to talk off the record
16:13
often in the future uh and he told a
16:15
couple of funny stories and everyone
16:16
laughed and cheered
16:18
that's the news report but that's
16:20
supposedly the first time it's ever been
16:21
used
16:22
but then they put that on the record
16:24
yeah
16:25
um there's a website called thrill list
16:27
which ranked 43
16:29
presidents by how much fun they were um
16:32
so this was a couple of years ago so it
16:33
was everyone
16:34
uh before trump um
16:37
and yeah and yeah anyway um
16:41
so just interesting where people came on
16:43
this it's pretty arbitrary but you know
16:44
rutherford b
16:45
hayes was the least fun president of all
16:47
time because not only did he not drink
16:49
himself
16:50
but he banned alcohol from the white
16:51
house his wife was known as lemonade
16:54
lucy
16:57
42 42 was james polk whose wife banned
17:01
any dancing
17:02
in the white house so you couldn't polka
17:06
under pulk she was probably so sick of
17:09
hearing that joke
17:10
yeah within a week the old ones are the
17:12
best ones
17:14
um and then you've got various other
17:15
presidents harry truman sounds funny he
17:17
had a shot of bourbon at 5 00 a.m
17:19
every single day 5 am
17:22
yeah wow frequently followed by a
17:24
massage
17:25
do you see
17:29
it sounds it sounds less sweet now
17:33
than when i wrote it down it makes
17:35
himself when we discuss it
17:36
here in this context he sounds like a
17:38
real character but if you actually did
17:40
that in life people would think you
17:42
were a problem yep yes how do you know
17:45
that people would think that
17:47
my friends have said that it's an issue
17:50
for other friends of theirs
17:53
um someone who was the opposite of
17:54
lemonade lucy actually was i think
17:56
the best first lady of all time and the
17:58
person for whom the
17:59
phrase first lady was first used so this
18:02
is dolly madison
18:04
uh so james madison's wife so this is
18:06
between 1809 and 1817 she was first lady
18:09
and she threw a massive house party in
18:11
the white house every week
18:13
every wednesday she called them a
18:15
squeeze
18:16
and she had between three and 500 guests
18:19
every single week this house party and
18:22
the whole purpose was to destroy the
18:23
rancorous feeling between
18:25
the politicians on different sides
18:26
between that time the federalists and
18:28
the republicans
18:29
and it worked really well so there are
18:30
various things that kind of got done
18:32
because she had these big cocktail
18:34
parties where they started chatting
18:36
um in fact there was a plan to move the
18:37
capital back to philadelphia
18:40
and then she threw a cocktail party and
18:42
then everyone agreed not to do it and
18:43
that's
18:43
why it's not lyndon b
18:47
johnson used to love drinking a lot and
18:49
he used to
18:50
have caused lots of nightmares for the
18:52
secret services who were looking after
18:53
him
18:54
um he used to drink drive a lot but on
18:56
his own property
18:57
so not not at the white house property
18:59
but you know his other place
19:01
and he used to drive and he would have a
19:03
whiskey in his hand
19:05
and uh what he would do is he would he
19:07
would run out of the whiskey and he
19:08
would slow the car down
19:10
wind down the window and just hold his
19:11
hand out while a secret service member
19:14
had to run up behind the car
19:16
grab the glass head back refill it and
19:19
come back while his hand is still just
19:20
waiting
19:21
still driving he's still he's still
19:23
going along just a bit slower
19:25
take it and then zoom off again you know
19:27
your car's a crap don't you when you can
19:28
get your member of staff to run
19:30
alongside it
19:31
yeah have you heard about how little fun
19:33
benjamin harrison was no
19:34
a little fun says he at the bottom of
19:36
the list he's not at the bottom of the
19:37
list
19:38
this is a separate list entirely to uh
19:40
the fun list but
19:41
um he was president around the 1890s
19:51
let's not make it a thing all right
19:54
um no he was president in 1891 and for
19:57
some years i presume on either side of
19:58
that
19:59
and this was he was the first president
20:01
to live in the white house when it had
20:03
electricity
20:04
so this was a huge innovation at the
20:06
time and it was obviously one of the
20:08
first buildings in america to have
20:09
electric lighting throughout it
20:11
but he and his wife were so scared of
20:14
being electrocuted
20:15
that they never even dared to touch the
20:17
light switches
20:18
that have been lavishly installed and to
20:20
be fair there was probably a much bigger
20:21
risk
20:22
then of being electrocuted but there are
20:24
stories that he and his wife sometimes
20:26
went to sleep with the lights on
20:27
because they were so scared of turning
20:29
their lights off and being electrocuted
20:31
wasn't there something about the new
20:32
trump administration they couldn't find
20:34
the light switches
20:35
it was steve it was steve bannon when he
20:37
had there was the
20:38
cabinet room where they spoke which was
20:40
just off somewhere in the white house
20:42
and no one could find the light switch
20:44
and it was a very dark room so they just
20:46
had all the initial meetings in the dark
20:48
because
20:49
they didn't want to buckle and ask the
20:50
obama administration where the light
20:52
switch was
20:53
and actually the longer you leave it the
20:55
more embarrassing it gets
20:58
done now they were all in krill
20:59
sphincters didn't they
21:02
[Applause]
21:03
we need to move on shortly just speaking
21:06
of presidents who knew
21:07
how to party do you guys know about
21:09
george washington's farewell party from
21:12
the military in 1787.
21:14
so we've got a record of his bar tab and
21:16
this was a party that 55 people attended
21:18
including him so it's him and a bunch of
21:20
soldiers and
21:22
55 people they drunk between them 54
21:25
bottles of madeira
21:26
60 bottles of claret eight bottles of
21:29
whiskey
21:30
22 bottles of porter eight of hard cider
21:33
12 of beer and seven bowls of alcoholic
21:36
punch
21:37
wow we've got the tab what were they
21:39
doing with it that's
21:41
like they each had a full bottle of wine
21:43
and then all the rest of it
21:45
and the full bottle of madeira yeah
21:46
exactly mad there was um
21:48
president andrew jackson had to escape
21:51
the white house
21:52
uh when he threw a party after his
21:54
inauguration because that got too wild
21:56
with this kind of let's get everyone
21:57
they've got twenty thousand citizens
21:59
into the white house and it used to be
22:01
that anyone who turned up to the
22:02
inauguration was allowed into the white
22:04
house
22:04
of course in the trump one they would
22:06
all fit
22:10
okay it is time for fact number three
22:12
and that
22:13
is andy my fact is that the prop bed
22:16
in the classic british comedy film carry
22:18
on dick
22:19
is worth 20 million pounds
22:23
and that's not just by people who like
22:25
movie props and
22:27
the carry on films this is such a weird
22:30
story okay so there's
22:32
there's a bed that was used uh for a
22:35
number of decades as a film prop
22:37
and it was bought a few years ago at
22:39
auction as a victorian bed
22:41
and it was bought for about 2 000 pounds
22:43
and the guy who bought it
22:44
looked at it and he thought after he
22:45
bought it he thought actually i don't
22:46
think it is a victorian bed it looks
22:48
older
22:48
so he called in a historian historian
22:50
called jonathan foyle who's been
22:52
investigating for some years
22:54
now foyle has aged it and
22:57
it turns out that the bed dates back to
23:00
1486
23:02
and was the marriage bed of king henry
23:06
viii
23:08
we think it's the bed that henry viii
23:09
was conceived in this is one of the most
23:12
it's the only bit of royal tudor
23:14
furniture
23:15
left in the world and it was used as a
23:18
prop company
23:22
[Applause]
23:25
it's been in all of them it's been in
23:26
puero um
23:28
it was in the 1995 private prejudice
23:30
it's got its own imdb
23:34
can you imagine how low it must think it
23:37
sunk
23:37
since being the conception bed henry the
23:40
eighth
23:41
with kenneth williams lying in there
23:43
he's like i used to have henry vii in me
23:45
[Laughter]
23:46
[Music]
23:48
peggy from eastenders making lewd jokes
23:50
with fake breasts of you i mean that's
23:52
horrible
23:53
but do we need it do we need to start
23:55
raiding the sets of
23:56
sort of classic comedies and eastenders
23:59
for cabinets
24:01
mrs brown's boys is home to priceless
24:03
ming porcelain
24:07
and actually the story of this bed goes
24:09
even further because it was almost
24:10
thrown away wasn't it it was part of a
24:12
hotel
24:12
and they were selling it off to this
24:15
auction house but the builders
24:16
that removed it from the hotel just left
24:18
it on the side for trash
24:20
yeah they left it in the car park in the
24:22
car park which is quite cool because it
24:24
means that that was found that was um
24:26
henry vii bed which was found in a car
24:28
park and of course richard iii was found
24:29
in a car park as well oh yeah and those
24:32
guys
24:32
they didn't like each other much no they
24:35
took it
24:35
and they've got one thing in common at
24:37
least
24:39
doing their bonding over that now the
24:41
car park kids in the corner in heaven
24:44
um yeah so that's incredible it's very
24:47
very weird and
24:48
it it has this whole history this
24:49
historian jonathan foyle who's been
24:51
investigating it
24:52
there he's made a film about it if you
24:53
look at his twitter feed there's a
24:55
really good
24:55
40-minute documentary about this bed and
24:57
i swear to goodness when you finish the
24:58
krill
25:02
it's really good it's riveting um
25:06
so it ended up in this house um the
25:08
house of thomas stanley who was the earl
25:10
of darby
25:10
and this was just after henry vii
25:12
because you if you were royal you just
25:14
had your ben
25:14
your bed sent ahead of you if you're
25:16
going to stay somewhere the bed will be
25:18
disassembled and transported
25:20
um but anyway in 1842 this guy called
25:23
george
25:24
shaw bought it and he didn't know what
25:26
he had either because he was a fraudster
25:28
and he ran a woodworking shop which made
25:30
fake tudor furniture
25:33
and he made fake beds based on henry vii
25:36
bed that was nearly identical but
25:39
knock-offs basically
25:40
and not quite as good he made copies of
25:42
it and then he would approach local
25:44
aristocrats and he would say
25:46
i found your family's ancestral bed and
25:48
he would slap on their coat
25:50
that family's coat of arms he would put
25:52
some polish on it to make it look old
25:54
and he passed it off as for them but he
25:56
could only do it so many times because
25:58
obviously
25:58
aristocrats talk to each other and after
26:01
a while one of them would say oh my
26:02
family's ancestral bed was found just
26:04
recently and i bought it and then
26:05
someone else would say oh that's weird
26:06
so was mine
26:08
yeah uh so moving to the modern day of
26:11
this
26:11
of this bed uh quite recently they found
26:13
out that it was definitely tudor
26:15
um through dna and so they dna tested
26:17
this bed
26:18
i didn't think you could even do that
26:20
but apparently it's a thing so a lot of
26:21
people saw it and they thought maybe
26:23
they looked at the grain of it and
26:25
thought maybe this has come from some
26:27
more modern trees in america um but they
26:30
said no no it's from it's from
26:32
european oak and they could do a dna
26:34
test on it that could show that it was a
26:36
european oak okay
26:38
that's really what a jeremy kyle show
26:39
that would be you've just got
26:41
two beds next to each other
26:45
that's a relief because i thought you're
26:46
gonna say they dna tested the henry vii
26:48
ejaculate or something and traced it all
26:50
the way
26:52
took one off the royal family and
26:53
checked it matched i don't know how they
26:55
do these things
26:56
wow this bed is very lucky though
26:59
because
26:59
most beds for royal families did not get
27:02
used
27:02
so monarchs in the especially in kind of
27:04
the 17th 18th centuries had
27:07
dozens and dozens of beds and never
27:09
slept in most of them and this is
27:10
because basically
27:11
every member of the nobility thought and
27:13
hoped and wished and prayed that the
27:14
monarch would visit them because when as
27:16
a monarch you went on a big tour of
27:17
britain
27:18
then you stayed with your noble friends
27:20
and they always made sure they had a
27:22
room
27:22
for the king or queen should they visit
27:24
with a bed for the king or queen it's
27:25
the best room in the house
27:27
nobody goes near it until their king
27:29
visits
27:30
and yeah most of them didn't so people
27:31
spent enormous amounts of money um
27:34
there was lord scarsdale built an entire
27:36
wing i think at kettlestone hall
27:38
which no monarch ever visited just in
27:40
case the monarch came to stay
27:43
there was one really sad story this is a
27:45
place called wilton house
27:46
and uh but a really elaborate state bed
27:49
was bought and built there for king
27:51
george iii
27:52
just in case he visited and he did which
27:54
was brilliant this was in 1778
27:57
and he visited and they showed him to
27:59
his room and he said
28:01
that's great i've actually brought my
28:02
own sort of tent bed if that's all right
28:04
so i'll just erect that on the floor
28:06
next to this lovely priceless bed that
28:08
you've spent years building
28:10
and he got his little zed bed out and
28:11
stepped on that inside
28:14
hey just a bit of modern uh royal bed
28:16
etiquette this is an interesting thing
28:18
there is a modern royal bed habit um
28:21
it's about the queen these days in the
28:24
royal family this is from various you
28:26
know
28:26
um newspaper websites which i'm not sure
28:28
are accurate but supposedly
28:30
it's considered rude to go to bed before
28:33
the queen does
28:35
so she can keep everybody up all night
28:38
because it's a breach of protocol even
28:40
in the family to say oh i'm quite tired
28:41
i'm going to turn in now granny
28:44
wow what time does she go to bed do we
28:45
know she yeah this is actually from
28:47
william hesseltein who was her private
28:48
secretary
28:49
although i do honestly think as soon as
28:51
you work for the royal family you go and
28:52
just make up a load of crap for the
28:54
press for fun but he
28:55
said this and he said she goes to bed at
28:56
midnight and although i do like to think
28:58
some nights she just forces herself to
29:00
stay awake for three days running
29:02
just just eyeing them all up around the
29:06
table
29:06
just to make megan look tired
29:11
um apparently diana couldn't hack it
29:13
apparently diana used to be a bit of an
29:15
early nighter
29:16
and used to make her excuses and that
29:19
really got her in the bad books
29:20
well yeah we should move on shortly to
29:22
our next fact
29:24
on royal tudor beds yeah um they
29:28
saw a lot of action but they also saw a
29:30
lot of kind of fake royal action didn't
29:32
they so i'm not sure we've talked about
29:33
very much about the bedding ceremony
29:36
which was basically if you were a royal
29:38
person and you married another royal
29:40
open from another country to forge an
29:41
alliance
29:42
you had to consummate that and everyone
29:44
had to see it to make sure it happened
29:47
and often it was children so then you
29:48
couldn't really consummate they just sat
29:50
in the bed together
29:51
so it actually sounds kind of weirdly
29:53
sweet with william and mary
29:55
they got betrothed and i think murray
29:58
was 10 and he was 14
30:00
and they had to like officially
30:02
consummate because then you know the
30:04
two forces are allied but so all these
30:08
spectators dozens of people thronged
30:09
into the bedroom
30:10
and then they just sat in bed together
30:12
for 45 minutes well everyone hung out
30:14
with them
30:15
and then they went okay well that's done
30:16
you're married now
30:18
and actually sometimes what would happen
30:20
is that the um
30:21
one of the people wasn't there or wasn't
30:23
in the country and they could nominate
30:25
someone else to consummate the marriage
30:27
yeah with their partners wow yeah and
30:29
then they would have to i think they had
30:30
to have one leg
30:32
unclothed or something like that i think
30:34
that happened with henry the seventh
30:35
wife in fact didn't it
30:37
she had on her wedding night because he
30:39
was absent
30:40
i think it was henry the seventh wife
30:41
then maybe that wasn't his ejaculate on
30:43
the bed she's afraid
30:47
do you want to do some something on
30:49
props yeah yeah yeah some prop stuff
30:51
um you go for it oh so um i got sent
30:54
this by um alex bell our colleague today
30:56
uh and he sent me an article about how
30:58
they use
30:59
very random things in sci-fi movies to
31:03
make them look kind of futuristic
31:05
so in the corridors of the recent star
31:07
trek film and you can see the stills of
31:08
this it's quite obvious when you know to
31:10
look for it
31:10
um the corridors are lined with dyson
31:12
air blades
31:14
the most futuristic technology on the
31:17
planet
31:19
and the medical officers die the medical
31:22
officers diagnosed patients using potato
31:24
peelers
31:25
in the old star trek and in star wars uh
31:27
qui gong gin
31:28
i don't know if that i don't know who
31:29
that is it's a quick
31:35
as soon as i saw that ran down i thought
31:37
i don't know how to pronounce that and
31:38
everyone listening to this does know how
31:40
to pronounce it
31:42
anyway um his communicator his yeah
31:47
his communicator is actually a gillette
31:49
sensor xl women's razor
31:54
well here's in that sort of vein of
31:56
things that you're not expecting to be
31:58
props
31:58
um die hard in the movie die hard bruce
32:01
willis he goes barefooted
32:03
um for a lot of scenes he's not
32:05
barefooted
32:06
he's wearing fake feet no no
32:10
he's wearing fake feet boots that are
32:13
shaped to his skin color with
32:15
five toe they're four toes and a and a
32:18
big toe
32:18
um that's right the foot thumb
32:22
as we sometimes
32:30
oh my god we've lost him we've lost him
32:35
do you need us to recite this little
32:37
piggy are you ready
32:42
so he was wearing these fake
32:45
fake feet that's amazing yes why was he
32:48
embarrassed about his feet
32:50
no it was in case an enemy grabbed him
32:52
he could just
32:54
lose
32:58
that's actually the end of the movie
33:00
isn't it and hans gruber falls from the
33:02
side
33:04
it's with a fake foot in his hand as he
33:06
drops
33:08
okay it is time for our final fact of
33:10
the show and
33:11
that is james okay my fact this week
33:14
is that shops in the philippines put
33:16
their christmas decorations up
33:18
on the 1st of september
33:20
[Music]
33:21
in total they stay up for more than 35
33:24
percent of the year
33:27
so cool and do they all even though they
33:29
do this all the time do they all whine
33:31
about it every time they go up
33:32
there it's too early they really
33:34
don't because they love it
33:35
and actually uh just to just to go a bit
33:37
further on that in the older traditions
33:39
um in the philippines christmas would
33:41
last until candlemas which is february
33:43
the second
33:44
and so in some places they'll keep it up
33:47
from the 1st of september to the 2nd of
33:49
february
33:50
which means it's up for 44.4 percent of
33:53
the year
33:54
wow that's pretty a good reason not to
33:57
move to the philippines
34:00
fascism slightly behind the incipient
34:03
fascism
34:05
yeah but yeah so basically people in the
34:07
philippines love christmas
34:08
uh it's one of the few catholic
34:10
countries uh in that part of the world
34:12
and they start their countdown 100 days
34:14
before christmas so they count it down
34:16
from 100
34:17
and that would be in the middle of
34:18
september but they've kind of evolved it
34:20
into being about the
34:22
ber months the bird months so september
34:24
october november december
34:26
and um now that now the way it does it
34:28
is basically the first of september
34:29
that's when they all go up and they all
34:31
stay up the whole time
34:32
so on christmas getting earlier this is
34:35
a thing
34:35
that a lot of people debate don't know
34:37
some people say it gets earlier every
34:38
year and some people say no it's
34:40
it can't get earlier every year because
34:41
then it would be going way way back
34:43
um but there is a way of tracking how
34:46
early christmas is
34:47
and this is by this was done this year
34:49
by the washington post which is the
34:51
mariah carey song
34:52
all i want for christmas is you okay so
34:54
came out 1994
34:56
and the washington post analyzed when it
34:58
enters the charts
35:00
each year because it does it re-enters
35:02
the charts every year and they found
35:03
it's been getting popular slightly
35:05
earlier in the holiday season
35:08
really so christmas music is definitely
35:10
getting earlier
35:11
each year yeah oh people are just
35:13
appreciating how great mariah carey is
35:15
more yeah we can all do that all year
35:16
round
35:17
can't we and the other way of doing that
35:19
but of course is by looking at internet
35:20
searches
35:21
and so they did a study of looking about
35:24
searches to things like santa claus or
35:26
elf or presence
35:27
and they found that in um 2008
35:31
people started searching for these
35:32
things around october the 12th
35:34
in 2009 it was on august the 30th
35:38
wow but in 2012 it was august of 19
35:41
people were looking for things like that
35:43
but then on the other hand the other
35:44
argument is
35:45
that basically people have been saying
35:46
this forever and there have been
35:48
examples of people saying as early as in
35:51
1901
35:52
uh the philadelphia inquirer complained
35:54
that it seemed to get earlier every year
35:56
so that was happening way way back that
35:57
people have been complaining about was
35:58
it just that
35:59
in 1901 it was you know noon on the 24th
36:03
of december
36:05
it was 1pm last year in 1914
36:09
adverts were appearing uh advertising to
36:12
women to buy stuff for christmas in
36:13
august
36:15
uh so it did go back and it was actually
36:17
a really patriotic thing to do
36:19
back in the day so there was a campaign
36:21
led by florence kelly who people might
36:23
have heard of she was
36:24
a big deal a big campaigner at the turn
36:27
of the century in america
36:28
she founded the naacp so
36:31
like an association to help african
36:33
americans she was very big on workers
36:35
rights and she said quite rightly that
36:37
the christmas rush in the two weeks
36:38
leading up to christmas was very unfair
36:40
on these poor you know enslaved workers
36:43
in these big malls so said do your
36:45
christmas shopping early
36:46
and these posters went up all over all
36:48
the big cities of america
36:50
and people were told you know you've got
36:52
to you've got to start christmas
36:53
shopping
36:54
and in fact and that carried on after
36:56
world war one because then ironically
36:57
all the big malls picked up on it and
36:59
we're like yeah we'd love it if people
37:00
started shopping for christmas in july
37:02
great but i like this advert that was in
37:05
the washington times in the 1920s
37:08
which said the headline was it was a
37:10
little essay and the headline was
37:11
if christmas came tomorrow would you be
37:13
ready
37:18
it is one one of the few things that
37:20
isn't just gonna sneak up on you
37:23
it's going to be the same time every
37:24
time um do you guys like
37:27
holiday music christmas music yes
37:30
i like mariah carey's song i must say
37:33
yeah you're flesh and blood james of
37:34
course you like mariah carey's song
37:36
but um so yougov did some polling about
37:40
whether people like christmas music
37:41
does it turn out they're all fascists if
37:42
they do or something because i didn't
37:44
say anything
37:45
no it doesn't okay i think it's whether
37:48
people like it in
37:49
shops leading up to christmas so 31
37:52
of respondents said they look forward to
37:54
it a lot um
37:56
an equal roughly equal number said
37:57
they'd like it some
37:59
um and 34 said not much or not at all
38:03
and then in 2011 there was a survey
38:05
finding that 23 percent of americans
38:07
dread holiday music
38:10
and 36 of respondents in one poll
38:13
admitted to leaving a shop
38:14
sooner because there was music playing
38:17
and i've found my people
38:21
we've actually got an exciting uh number
38:23
of christmas albums coming out this year
38:25
i was looking in so i'm excited yeah
38:26
well so
38:27
since we talked mariah carey it's the
38:29
benchmark it's what every artist wants
38:30
they want that big christmas song that's
38:32
just going to be played throughout the
38:34
years um so in the past kylie minogue
38:36
and everyone have done christmas albums
38:37
i've seen michael buble
38:38
this year jessie j is releasing a
38:40
christmas album um gwen stefani is
38:42
releasing a christmas album
38:44
and william shatner is releasing a
38:45
christmas album
38:47
and his one looks extraordinary great
38:49
list of songs
38:50
um he's calling it shatner claws
38:55
it doesn't sound quite close enough to
38:57
santa does
38:59
they gave up on that title didn't they
39:01
yeah i've never thought about
39:03
the sound of shatner until you said
39:04
shatner claws
39:07
shatner only reminds you of one other
39:09
word and it's not santa
39:12
have you heard james brown has he been
39:20
don't forget to leave out a mince pie
39:22
and some ammonium um
39:28
i was just reading about this you uh
39:30
everyone might know this but i didn't
39:31
know it
39:32
um there's a lot of shops in the last
39:33
couple of years um that have started
39:35
stocking
39:35
easter trees and easter bubbles
39:39
apparently that's a thing now no
39:42
oh no i've seen easter crackers in the
39:44
shops yeah it's they're not playing
39:46
easter songs
39:47
they've never got the chat the bunny
39:48
coming along
39:56
[Applause]
39:56
[Laughter]
40:04
oh my god that's very good on christmas
40:06
decorations so they've always been a big
40:09
thing a big demonstration often is
40:10
turning on the christmas lights in
40:12
america
40:13
it's a big deal apparently turning on
40:14
the christmas lights and the president
40:16
traditionally turned them on
40:18
so ronald reagan for instance in 1983
40:22
thought he turned on the christmas
40:23
lights his big symbolic move
40:25
uh but he didn't he was tricked so
40:29
he basically they always do it from the
40:31
ellipse park which is apparently near
40:32
the white house it's about a kilometer
40:34
away or something a half a kilometer
40:36
and the big tree is there and all the
40:38
lights go on from there there's this
40:39
switch
40:39
and in 1983 there'd just been this
40:41
assassination attempt on ronald reagan
40:43
so the secret service were a little bit
40:45
antsy about having him exposed in public
40:48
and so they said to him we'll put you on
40:50
the white house steps and we'll rig it
40:51
up
40:52
so that there's this massive switch and
40:53
there was a giant switch on the steps
40:55
and you press it and then it will turn
40:56
on all the lights it'll be amazing
40:58
and he did that and i was reading this
41:00
in a book by someone who worked at the
41:02
white house quite low down who
41:05
looked at this massive switch he was
41:06
going to press and said to one of the
41:07
other people working there
41:08
i can't see the wire where it where it
41:10
connects up to the
41:12
the lights and the the other guy said
41:14
yeah yeah there isn't one
41:16
yeah um it's just a big prop switch
41:19
that reagan's going to press and he'll
41:21
think he's turned on the christmas
41:22
lights and actually i then immediately
41:24
have to radio or phone my mate
41:25
who's in the park who will then plug in
41:28
the christmas lights
41:29
we do that with the nuclear button for
41:31
[Music]
41:32
trump
41:34
if we if we just swap the nuclear switch
41:39
for a krill's sphincter
41:43
all he'll do is light up a tiny
41:45
crustacean
41:47
and his hands are small enough
42:00

43:11
the composer the barber of seville
43:13
was bald but he didn't want to admit it

so what he did was he had
43:17
10 wigs made of different lengths which
43:20
he changed

every week and then after 10 weeks he'd

weren't expecting what you're about to
00:14

00:16
book of the year 2018. we sat in a
00:19
studio we read out our book it lasts
00:21
about nine hours long it's all of us
00:22
interjecting on each other we really
00:24

00:26
day
00:27
can you not interject on each other it
00:29
just sounds rude dad sounds great okay
00:34
so yeah we were in the studio it was a
00:36
long long hard session of us constantly
00:40
interjecting all over each other
00:44
should we just say on with the show well
00:48
it's the letter a and then buy the rest
00:49
of it okay on with the show
00:52
a
00:53
in which we learn why flies can't fly
00:55
with american airlines whose reputation
00:58
might be tarnished by working with the
01:00
white house
01:01
who bought russell crowe's jock strap
01:04
how to tell your astronauts from your
01:06
astronauts and why the belgian army are
01:09
such mummys boys
01:11
hey
01:12
okay we're starting the book with aa
01:14
good place to start no advance news this
01:16
year that's tragic but we found quite a
01:18
lot of aaa news didn't we
01:20
too much i would say
01:23
okay here's one um american airlines
01:25
which is an aaa they banned passengers
01:28
from traveling with emotional support
01:30
insects
01:31
did that affect
01:32
many people no probably not even that
01:34
many insects either right yeah like i
01:37
don't know how emotionally supportive
01:38
insects can be so american airlines they
01:41
change their rules on emotional support
01:42
animals this year and that means that
01:44
insects now prohibited along with any
01:47
animals with hooves
01:49
any emotional support amphibians
01:51
emotional support ferrets emotional
01:52
support hedgehogs and the move was a
01:55
response to an 84 rise in urine feces
01:58
and aggression related incidents
02:00
involving animals since 2016. well
02:03
they're going to need to ban me if
02:04
that's the problem
02:07
we found more aaa news as well but we
02:09
found a news about the alcoholics
02:10
anonymous oh yeah so there was a man who
02:13
bought the original alcoholics anonymous
02:15
document and he did so and then he waved
02:17
his anonymity in order to help
02:19
alcoholics wow so he's no longer
02:22
anonymous he's not so there's this
02:24
founding book of alcoholics anonymous
02:25
which is from 1935 and this year it was
02:28
sold at an auction in los angeles for
02:30
2.4 million dollars and it gets called
02:33
the big book because it's very big uh
02:35
because this paper is very thick and the
02:37
man who bought it was the man who owns
02:39
the indianapolis colts uh football
02:41
american football team and he's been
02:43
battling his own addictions over the
02:44
last two years he's called jim irsay and
02:46
he decided to go public and he said that
02:48
he would make a cabinet for the book and
02:50
display it for part of the year at
02:52
alcoholics anonymous headquarters in new
02:54
york in order to help inspire alcoholics
02:56
to give up drink
02:57
oh what a nice story that's very cool
03:00
another aaa the first aaa that springs
03:03
to mind really is the a battery right
03:06
and this year scientists invented a
03:08
battery that never runs out ever so it's
03:11
a a size it was created by osseo a
03:14
wireless technology company that's based
03:15
in washington state and it's called
03:18
forever battery it comes with a
03:20
transmitter that constantly keeps it
03:21
fully charged via wi-fi like waves so
03:24
just in the air the air charges it you
03:27
are an expert in this kind of technology
03:30
i practically invented it um although it
03:32
has to be that the battery and the
03:33
transmitter are within 10 meters of each
03:35
other it's a small caveat it's in a
03:37
small print um but the
03:39
hope is it that one day uh these kind of
03:40
setups will be available in every single
03:42
home that'll be good
03:44
uh there's one final aaa which is that
03:46
the automobile association found that
03:48
there was one breakdown they couldn't
03:50
fix a former executive chairman at the
03:52
automobile association sued the company
03:54
for wrongful dismissal after he was
03:56
fired for gross misconduct
03:58
he said he was stressed and overworked
04:00
when he got into a fight with a
04:01
colleague and that the company had no
04:03
regard for his mental well-being so
04:05
essentially his argument appears to be
04:06
that the aaa couldn't deal with his
04:08
breakdown
04:09
are they using that on their advertising
04:11
in future there's only one breakdown the
04:13
a.a can't fix and it's your emotional
04:15
breakdown
04:16
[Laughter]
04:18
advertising
04:19
roger federer lost the rights to his own
04:22
initials
04:23
so this is the rf logo which if you've
04:26
ever watched a tennis game in the last
04:28
15 years you'll know he has sort of sewn
04:30
embroidered into his shirt in kind of
04:32
gold and it's owned by nike and they've
04:35
been a sponsor for 24 years but this
04:37
year he's switched allegiance to the
04:39
japanese company uniqlo however the
04:42
initials are still owned by nike and so
04:45
he now has to reach an agreement with
04:47
knight to get them back because as he
04:49
put it they are my initials they are
04:51
mine which is almost fair enough but uh
04:54
he can draw comfort roger federer from
04:55
the fact that uniqlo is paying him 300
04:58
million dollars just to wear their
05:00
clothes on court over the next 10 years
05:03
um well uniqlo and most other
05:04
advertisers are hoping to maximize their
05:06
public exposure in ways like this the
05:08
company that makes skittles produce an
05:10
advert this year that will only ever be
05:12
seen by one person that's teenager and
05:14
skittles fan marcos menendez uh who as a
05:17
publicity stunt was shut in a room and
05:20
shown an advert that was made specially
05:21
for him while his reaction was streamed
05:23
live on facebook to thousands of viewers
05:26
he revealed afterwards what was in the
05:27
advert that only he saw apparently it
05:29
featured friend star david schwimmer
05:31
shooting lasers from his mouth at
05:33
marcos's mother and turning her into
05:35
skittles
05:37
it seems pretty great
05:38
another company that was probably a bit
05:40
less happy with the way its goods were
05:42
being advertised was team manufacturer
05:44
twinings so twines complained to the
05:46
advertising standards authority after
05:48
poundland decided to publish a tweet
05:50
this was last christmas
05:52
and the tweet showed a naughty elf
05:54
squatting over a female doll and holding
05:56
a twinings tea bag above her face that
05:59
is naughty yeah the accompanying caption
06:01
on the tweet read how do you take your
06:03
tea one lump or two so yeah the
06:07
advertising sanders authority ruled the
06:08
ad was irresponsible but hilarious
06:12
meanwhile the truth of that old
06:14
advertising mantra that sex sells was
06:16
demonstrated in the monkey world this
06:18
year so a group of male macaques was
06:20
shown pictures of either dominant male
06:22
macaque faces or subordinate male faces
06:25
or female macaque hindquarters
06:28
bottoms um alongside logos of brands
06:31
like pizza hut and adidas and the
06:33
macaques showed a very clear preference
06:35
for the logos they associated with the
06:37
hindquarters you wrote this article
06:39
didn't you i did yes and you chose to
06:41
use hindquarters that's what i call them
06:43
i was just dumbing it down for the
06:44
masses
06:47
advice the government advised people
06:49
being deported to jamaica to put on a
06:51
jamaican accent
06:53
labour mp david lammy drew attention
06:55
this year to a leaflet given to british
06:56
residents being deported to jamaica
06:58
published when theresa may was home
07:00
secretary as he pointed out it included
07:02
such tips as try to be jamaican use
07:05
local accents and dialect
07:07
and the pamphlet's existence came to
07:08
light during the windrush scandal when
07:10
it was revealed that hundreds of british
07:12
subjects who had arrived in the uk
07:14
between 1948 and 1970 had been wrongly
07:17
detained denied legal rights lost homes
07:20
jobs and benefits and in at least 63
07:22
cases have been deported even though
07:24
they had originally been given an
07:26
automatic right to remain permanently in
07:28
the uk
07:29
and to make matters worse the government
07:31
had destroyed all their landing cards
07:32
back in 2010 to cut back on stored
07:35
paperwork so the windrush generation had
07:37
no way of proving their status
07:39
that was some bad advice more bad advice
07:41
was in preparation for the world cup
07:43
where argentina's football association
07:45
issued a manual to its players and
07:47
officials that contained a chapter on
07:48
how to pick up women while they were in
07:50
russia
07:51
tips included make sure you're clean
07:53
smell good and dress well is that bad
07:55
advice that's great advice
07:57
about to give the advice that's right
07:59
and russian girls hate boring men never
08:02
ask trite questions be original they
08:04
don't like to be seen as objects can i
08:06
just say i'm married to a russian girl
08:09
and if they don't like boring men
08:11
and i'm in serious trouble
08:13
so after that level it was given out the
08:14
argentine football association insisted
08:16
that it had been mistakenly included and
08:18
when it was noticed they had the
08:19
booklets returned and they hurriedly
08:21
ripped out the offending pages wow
08:24
alexa
08:26
alexa got in trouble for laughing at her
08:28
owners
08:30
numerous customers this year reported
08:31
that amazon's voice activated assistant
08:33
was breaking out into spontaneous
08:35
laughter when she wasn't even supposed
08:37
to be switched on amazon fixed the
08:39
glitch explaining it was caused by echo
08:41
devices mistakenly misinterpreting words
08:43
it overheard as the phrase alexa laugh
08:47
amazon was not able to explain why one
08:49
device started telling random jokes
08:51
without being asked and why another woke
08:53
up its owner around midnight and
08:54
announced he's home he's home for no
08:57
apparent reason in some cases alexa even
08:59
went so far as to place orders for
09:01
unwanted products so one woman tried to
09:04
have an alexa tv advert band claiming
09:06
that her echo dot had ordered pet food
09:08
because it overheard someone on the ad
09:10
asking for it
09:11
and white house press secretary sarah
09:14
huckabee sanders tweeted that her
09:15
two-year-old son had inadvertently
09:17
ordered a batman toy by shouting batman
09:19
repeatedly into their device
09:22
perhaps even more unnervingly one couple
09:24
discovered alexa had recorded their
09:26
private conversation and sent it to one
09:28
of their contacts they only realized
09:30
this when he phoned to inform them he
09:32
just received a recording of them
09:34
discussing hardwood floors
09:39
given all of this customers might not be
09:41
reassured by the news that amazon has
09:43
filed a patent for voice sniffing
09:45
technology which would theoretically let
09:47
its echo speakers listen to people all
09:49
the time to ascertain their likes and
09:51
dislikes it's no wonder perhaps that the
09:54
name alexa has declined in popularity by
09:57
33 percent in the us since 2015. i like
10:00
as well the church of england launched
10:02
an app this year that allows you to ask
10:03
alexa questions like where's my nearest
10:05
church or please read me the lord's
10:07
prayer what is the bible
10:10
not doing well as a how can a benevolent
10:12
and omnipotent god allow evil
10:15
that kind of question
10:19
all you can eat
10:21
an all-you-can-eat restaurant had to
10:23
shut after two weeks because customers
10:25
ate all they could
10:27
jamina a restaurant in chengdu china
10:30
shut its doors for good after launching
10:32
an all-you-can-eat membership card which
10:34
for 120 yen which is about 13 pounds
10:37
guaranteed unlimited food for a month
10:40
the owners said that they were aware
10:42
they might lose some money initially but
10:44
hope that their loyalty scheme would not
10:45
only attract clients but would allow
10:47
them to negotiate discounts from food
10:49
and drink suppliers what they didn't
10:51
count on was how many customers would
10:52
take advantage of that deal in the first
10:55
14 days the restaurant attracted more
10:57
than 7 000 diners many of whom were
10:59
repeat customers or people who had
11:01
borrowed cards from family and friends
11:03
after just two weeks the restaurant had
11:05
fallen into debt to the tune of 50 000
11:07
pounds and was forced to shut the owner
11:10
cited their poor management as the
11:12
problem sounds about right
11:15
they also have a problem at uh
11:16
brighton's big cheese festival this year
11:18
did you see that yeah they ran out of
11:20
cheese
11:21
they said it was due to the bad weather
11:22
which meant that the traders couldn't
11:24
get there but one person wrote on social
11:25
media hmm was expecting more cheese
11:29
someone else said i'd rather have gone
11:31
to the supermarket less cues more cheese
11:36
and a couple of months after that i
11:38
think didn't an all-you-can-eat pizza
11:40
festival in notting hill run out of
11:41
pizza who wants to go to an
11:43
all-you-can-eat pizza fest who can eat
11:44
more than one pizza uh well two people
11:47
on this table could yeah
11:49
we're not gonna specify which
11:51
who can manage more than half a small
11:53
pizza
11:57
animal races
11:59
a snail racing competition was postponed
12:01
because the snails were too sluggish
12:04
now that's their words not my words
12:06
that's not me trying to make a terrible
12:07
joke that's the snail's words
12:10
they apologized afterwards being too
12:12
sluggish sorry guys post-race interview
12:16
so this was a race that was due to take
12:18
place in february at the dartmoor union
12:20
pub in plymouth but the organizers went
12:22
to the pet shop to collect the snails
12:24
and they were told that the cold weather
12:25
had made them extra sleepy
12:28
this pub probably should have taken some
12:29
advice from the organizers of the world
12:31
snail racing championships which always
12:33
takes place in july in norfolk now they
12:36
use a special damp cloth to keep their
12:38
snails happy
12:39
the human competitors in that one though
12:41
they don't always show the same
12:42
compassion the owner of the winner this
12:44
year joe waterfield said i pulled him
12:46
out this morning and told him if he
12:48
didn't win i would squash
12:50
him also what a fix that the world snow
12:53
racing championships always takes place
12:55
in norfolk
12:56
fifa could learn a thing or two from
12:57
these guys
12:59
i think the next one is in qatar
13:00
actually
13:00
[Laughter]
13:02
so the animal race with the youngest
13:04
participants this year was definitely
13:06
the great high high high hi
13:09
ho ho
13:11
the great hehe sperm race set up by a
13:14
new zealand charity to raise money for
13:16
the hehe bird which is an endangered yet
13:18
relatively unknown species
13:20
sperm samples were taken from four
13:22
different hehe colonies and people were
13:24
encouraged to place a 10
13:26
that's 10 new zealand dollar bet on
13:28
which of the samples would swim the
13:30
fastest
13:31
according to the website the male with
13:33
the fastest sperm was cp11870
13:37
from tiritiri matangi island
13:40
also known as the male who was famous
13:42
for his nutty pink leg bands but secure
13:45
in his masculinity
13:47
sorry the sperm had pink leg bands no so
13:50
it was the heavy bird
13:52
who had the fast sperm ah who also had
13:54
leg bands who was also secure in his
13:56
musculature was the the sperm with the i
14:00
don't know what his legs are like is
14:02
that his name or is that the hehe bird's
14:03
name
14:04
cp118 bird is called cp1187 oh not the
14:08
sperm because then they would have to
14:09
name everything every sperm and that's
14:10
even just announcing the uh the race you
14:13
get the races
14:14
you get baby name books i don't think
14:16
you get sperm name books
14:17
[Laughter]
14:19
antarctic
14:20
every minute the antarctic loses enough
14:23
ice to keep the uk in slushies for an
14:25
entire year
14:27
in fact in the time it took me to read
14:29
that sentence antarctica lost 12 olympic
14:32
swimming pools worth of ice with more
14:34
than a gigaton that's a billion tons of
14:36
ice disappearing every two days what i
14:39
know how much ice is there then there's
14:42
so much ice there's more than that thank
14:44
goodness yeah i don't know we're not
14:46
gonna run out in like six days which
14:48
means there's so much ice i'm not saying
14:50
this is a like anti-climatic
14:53
piece it's like that thing about how
14:54
they say that um a rainforest the size
14:57
of wales disappears every year from
15:00
brazil and they've been saying that
15:01
since at least i was born so that's a
15:04
hell of a lot of rainforest isn't it
15:05
yeah you guys are really coming across
15:06
as strong deniers at the moment
15:10
well things are getting worse actually
15:12
because according to a study published
15:13
this year the antarctic is losing three
15:15
times more ice than it was as recently
15:18
as 2012. and if that wasn't bad enough
15:20
we've also recently discovered there's a
15:22
volcano going off under the south pole
15:25
which is only adding to the effects of
15:27
so-called notes
15:28
which is certainly adding to the effects
15:30
of climate change
15:31
but there was better news for the
15:32
antarctic this year um researchers
15:34
discovered a super colony of 1.5 million
15:37
previously unknown penguins on the
15:40
danger islands
15:42
after noticing streaks of penguin poo in
15:44
nasa satellites imagery of the islands
15:46
do we not know about them because we
15:48
were too afraid to go to danger either i
15:50
think so it makes sense yeah because we
15:52
had to cross the river of doom and then
15:57
until now it was thought that this
15:58
particular species of adelie penguins
16:00
was on the decline but population levels
16:03
are in fact relatively healthy
16:05
and one other good piece of antarctic
16:07
news came in the form of the first ever
16:09
harvest at the south pole it was grown
16:12
in a giant greenhouse that uses a
16:14
special liquid nutrient instead of soil
16:16
and leds rather than sunlight the
16:18
technology may one day allow us to farm
16:20
on other planets that are less fertile
16:22
than our own that is every other planet
16:25
that we know of
16:26
the first antarctic crop was modest
16:28
consisting of 18 cucumbers 70 radishes
16:31
and 8 pounds of salad leaves
16:34
but no iceberg lettuce
16:37
very good missed opportunity
16:39
arctic
16:40
china called itself a near arctic state
16:43
despite the fact that its nearest border
16:44
ends a thousand miles south of the
16:46
arctic
16:48
china would love to increase its
16:49
influence in the arctic both because
16:50
then it could take advantage of shorter
16:52
trade routes and because the arctic
16:54
contains a third of the world's natural
16:55
gas reserves and various other tempting
16:57
resources so this year china attempted
17:00
to charm two key regional powers by
17:02
opening a joint observatory with iceland
17:05
and by lending finland a couple of
17:07
pandas
17:08
china's first ever polar cruise ship is
17:10
also going to launch next year
17:12
but it's not just china that is invading
17:13
the arctic this year it was discovered
17:15
that the atlantic ocean is doing the
17:17
same thing
17:18
so since 2000 the northern berens region
17:21
of the arctic ocean has been heating
17:23
very rapidly and as the ice cover has
17:25
diminished so has the salinity of the
17:27
water and it's been turning into an
17:29
ocean with qualities very similar to
17:31
those of the atlantic and the result has
17:33
been that atlantic fish have started to
17:35
invade traditionally arctic areas of sea
17:38
that's amazing i know it's not all bad
17:39
news for the arctic a group of students
17:41
from bangor university created prototype
17:43
ice rebuilding machines that spray water
17:46
onto existing ice causing it to freeze
17:48
thicken existing ice layers and
17:50
hopefully reverse the effects of climate
17:52
change not so cold climate change so
17:54
reverse the effects of definitely
17:56
happening climate change
17:58
a similar technique has been tried in
17:59
canada but the canadian machines are
18:01
powered by petrol engines whereas the
18:02
new bangor method is wind powered and
18:04
therefore much more environmentally
18:06
friendly
18:07
sadly on the day they first tried these
18:09
new devices there wasn't actually any
18:10
ice in the welsh water meaning the thing
18:12
couldn't be fully tested but it
18:14
certainly works in theory
18:17
apps
18:19
favorite apps of the year i go on here
18:21
stoners there's an app for stoners now
18:23
so scientists at the university of
18:25
chicago have developed a prototype app
18:27
and it's designed for cannabis users so
18:28
they can determine whether or not they
18:30
are actually high
18:32
they need an app to tell them if that's
18:33
the case
18:34
am i stoned it's called assesses the
18:37
effects of the drug on cognitive ability
18:39
by providing the users with a series of
18:41
tasks to test their memory reaction time
18:44
and an
18:46
attention span
18:47
was distracted by a bee in the studio
18:51
is that for use parties you know when
18:54
people uh sort of take a toke but they
18:56
don't inhale because they're a bit too
18:57
scared to when you're 14. and then you
18:59
get this app out and you test if they're
19:00
really stoned when you're 14 or when
19:02
you're bill clinton yeah absolutely is
19:04
that this year the bill clinton
19:06
it's pretty
19:08
current i really like the app for people
19:11
who want to become fathers that came out
19:14
this year it's this app called yo and
19:16
it's an app that allows men to check
19:18
their sperm count without having to see
19:19
a doctor it comes with a slide on which
19:22
men can place a drop of their semen and
19:24
the app takes a picture of the deposit
19:26
analyzes it and assesses whether the
19:28
sperm count is normal and when you say
19:30
slide we mean like a microscope slide
19:32
don't we yes not a playground slide
19:36
incidentally james isn't allowed in any
19:37
playgrounds in the greater london area
19:41
okay here's a couple of laps um glance
19:43
love and wink chat
19:45
okay they're dating apps do you fancy
19:47
one of those anyone oh yeah well you are
19:49
in a relationship that's right
19:52
i'd like to correct my answer
19:55
well maybe you wouldn't because they
19:56
were actually built by islamist militant
19:59
group hamas
20:00
basically in this app you would pretend
20:02
to be an attractive young israeli and
20:05
then an israeli would download the app
20:06
and then you could install malware onto
20:08
their phone and steal data they also
20:10
built another spying program for the
20:12
world cup it was called gold cup but
20:14
actually one senior israeli defence
20:16
force officer said it was actually very
20:18
good oh that's nice
20:20
um i've got one this is for
20:23
people who
20:25
have stomachs
20:26
so it was developed by australian
20:28
scientists it's an indigestible
20:29
electronic pill
20:31
and you swallow it and then it's paired
20:33
with a pocket size receiver and a mobile
20:35
phone app and what the app allows you to
20:37
do is track your fart development in
20:39
real time as it passes from the stomach
20:42
to the colon
20:44
and it's not just for leisure use it is
20:46
actually for scientific uses to collect
20:47
gut data and to give us a better
20:50
understanding of which foods cause
20:51
digestive problems so can you see if
20:54
you're in a sort of a very um let's say
20:57
a lift a work environment can you check
20:59
and go oh god i've got one coming in 10
21:00
seconds i can see it approaching the
21:02
door the door of my body
21:05
i think we call it the door to the
21:06
hindquarters
21:08
is it can you can you get it right to
21:10
the point i'm not sure it's that good
21:12
yet but you never know maybe the 2.0
21:14
version
21:15
will be good enough
21:18
ardern jacinda
21:20
new zealand's prime minister gave birth
21:22
to a prime minister this year jacinda
21:25
ardern became only the second world
21:26
leader ever to have a baby while in
21:28
office the other was benazir bhutto back
21:31
in 1990. ardern gave birth to her
21:33
daughter on the 21st of june now that
21:36
coincidentally is benazir bhutto's
21:37
birthday that's a nice connection ardern
21:40
then took six weeks of maternity leave
21:42
ardern first discovered she was pregnant
21:44
with the prime minister as the baby was
21:46
dubbed on twitter only six days before
21:48
she became prime minister-elect and
21:49
barely two months after she'd been
21:51
handed the labour party leadership
21:53
labor at the time was in real
21:54
difficulties its popularity in the polls
21:56
was at a 20-year low of 23
21:59
and the party had just run through four
22:00
leaders in four years ardern told
22:03
reporters everyone knows i've just
22:05
accepted with short notice the worst job
22:07
in politics
22:09
however only a few weeks into the
22:10
campaign jacinda mania as the press
22:12
called it kicked in
22:14
and she ended up increasing her party's
22:16
vote by 50 percent in october 2017 age
22:19
37 she became the world's youngest
22:21
female leader
22:22
ardern named her daughter nev tay aroha
22:25
ardern gayford tay aroha is a tiny
22:28
farming community with a population of
22:30
3900
22:32
near to where ardern grew up the
22:34
townspeople were so excited by the news
22:36
that they announced plans to paint all
22:37
of the buildings pink and invited ardern
22:40
to visit so that she could take part in
22:41
the traditional maori practice of
22:43
burying the afterbirth in the earth
22:46
jacinda did not respond to the offer
22:48
perhaps because she was considering her
22:50
options earlier in the year another
22:51
maori tribe had suggested she bury her
22:54
placenta at the spot where britain
22:55
signed the treaty that led to the
22:57
founding of modern new zealand
22:59
as well as putting a small town on the
23:01
map this year jacinda fronted a national
23:03
campaign to help put new zealand back on
23:06
the map as she pointed out in a video
23:08
she made with comedian rhys darby world
23:10
maps produced in other countries have a
23:12
worrying tendency to leave out new
23:14
zealand the board game risk a map in new
23:17
york central park zoo a john lewis
23:19
tablecloth and an episode of the
23:21
simpsons are just four of the places you
23:23
won't find it according to online
23:24
communities that have been monitoring
23:26
the problem for some years now
23:28
maybe it doesn't exist maybe it doesn't
23:30
we went there in may it exists oh well
23:32
they said we were in new zealand good
23:34
point it looked a lot like wales
23:38
armenia
23:39
armenians had a snowball fight in
23:41
temperatures of 25 degrees celsius
23:44
surely more of a water fight at that
23:46
point
23:48
so the snow was transported from the
23:50
armenian mountains in an enormous dump
23:53
truck specifically to celebrate the fact
23:55
that prime minister serge saxian had
23:58
stepped down in the face of huge public
24:00
protests
24:01
some said the white snow showed the
24:03
demonstrators purity and the desire for
24:05
democracy in the country but most just
24:07
saw it as a way to have a bit of fun in
24:09
2015 the armenian people voted to swap
24:12
their presidential system for a
24:13
parliamentary one with a country run by
24:15
a prime minister
24:17
this year saxion who had been president
24:19
for the previous 10 years said he would
24:21
not try to become prime minister and
24:23
indeed the opposition planted a farewell
24:25
tree to say good riddance to him two
24:27
days later though the republic party of
24:29
armenia confirmed it would nominate
24:31
saxion to be the country's next prime
24:33
minister a role that thanks to new laws
24:36
meant he would be even more powerful
24:38
than he had ever been as president
24:40
during the protest that ensued
24:42
opposition leader nicole paschenian led
24:44
a 200 kilometer march from armenia's
24:47
second city of guillory to the capital
24:49
yerevan where he was promptly arrested
24:52
further matches followed in which some
24:54
20 of the country took part
24:56
saxion eventually bowed to pressure
24:58
saying i was wrong
25:00
while nicole paschinyan was right
25:03
pashinyan became armenia's new prime
25:05
minister
25:07
armies
25:08
american soldiers gave away the location
25:10
of secret military bases by going
25:13
jogging there's a gps tracking company
25:15
called strava which employs satellite
25:17
information to map the location of
25:19
people using fitbits and other wearable
25:21
fitness devices all over the world
25:23
in europe and america the devices are
25:25
ubiquitous but in countries like iraq or
25:28
syria almost the only people using them
25:30
are american soldiers of course this
25:32
means that wherever the strava map
25:34
lights up red in those areas there's
25:35
almost certainly a military base there
25:38
the publicly available information on
25:39
the map has therefore given away daily
25:41
patterns supply routes and even
25:43
individual patrol routes and the worst
25:45
part of it is that in 2013 the pentagon
25:48
gave out 2 500 fitbits to its soldiers
25:51
to help fight obesity hence unwittingly
25:53
compromising its own bases
25:56
but at least u.s army personnel are
25:58
trying to keep fit the chinese army has
26:00
had to ban fat soldiers from promotion
26:02
after a fifth of would-be recruits
26:04
failed the weight test in some brigades
26:06
40 percent of the soldiers failed to
26:08
complete a five kilometer cross-country
26:10
run
26:11
last year the official state newspaper
26:13
blamed failure to get into the army on
26:15
young men's poor diets and excess
26:17
masturbation what
26:19
you know it'll affect
26:20
that sounds like a man who's trying to
26:22
get into the chinese army
26:24
oh my application's not going to go
26:27
down well well just improve your diet
26:29
and knock it off you know you'll be fine
26:32
oh don't knock it off enough
26:36
as for the spanish army it was announced
26:38
in january that 180 legionnaires from
26:40
the elite rapid reaction force were too
26:42
overweight to fight they have since been
26:44
put on a diet
26:46
but the year's prize for the most mocked
26:48
armed force goes to the belgian army
26:50
which announced plans to let recruits
26:51
sleep at home during their training so
26:53
they don't get homesick ah as one
26:55
horrified former paratrooper said you
26:57
don't go to a war zone with men who miss
26:59
their mummies
27:01
um this is pretty amazing it was
27:03
revealed this year that the us has built
27:05
itself a digital north korea
27:08
so the idea is that american troops can
27:10
practice fighting in a virtual reality
27:13
of what would be the enemy terrain
27:16
uh before doing it for real what they
27:18
should have done is they should have
27:19
sent donald trump to the virtual north
27:21
korea make him think that he was meeting
27:23
with kim jong-un we should just keep him
27:26
in a virtual world where he's like the
27:28
king of the whole world let everything
27:30
get seats oh no maybe we've all gone
27:32
into that reality wow
27:36
artificial intelligence
27:39
scientists exposed their ai machine to
27:41
an online forum and it became a
27:44
psychopath
27:45
the team from mit fed the comments from
27:48
a particularly angry message board into
27:50
the machine which they called norman
27:52
after doing so they showed norman
27:54
inkblots from the rorschach test from
27:56
the rorschach test which are often used
27:58
to give clues about a subject's
28:00
personality and compared norman's
28:02
responses to those of another computer
28:05
that had not seen the internet comments
28:07
where a normal ai saw a black and white
28:10
photo of a baseball glove norman saw a
28:13
man is murdered by machine gun in broad
28:15
daylight
28:17
and where the normal ai saw a person is
28:19
holding an umbrella in the air
28:21
norman thought it was a man is shot dead
28:23
in front of his screaming wife wow wow
28:27
is no one the name of the guy in psycho
28:28
yes yes yeah that's why they call it why
28:30
okay well you're sort of condemning him
28:33
there aren't you by giving you that name
28:35
do you think nominative determinism
28:36
works in robots i must do yeah he just
28:39
really really loves his motherboard
28:42
in more constructive technology
28:44
innovations this year it turns out that
28:46
ai programs can be better than doctors
28:48
at spotting cancer
28:50
in one test machines were pitted against
28:52
doctors in a competition to spot and
28:54
diagnose skin cancer the machines got it
28:57
right 95 of the time and the doctors
29:00
only managed 87
29:02
and nissan invented an ai that trundles
29:05
around and scans the ground looking for
29:08
a flatish clear space large enough to
29:10
make a football pitch it then paints the
29:12
markings on that area ready for a game
29:15
it's basically the robot equivalent of
29:16
putting your jumpers down as goal posts
29:19
in other ai news there was a group from
29:22
ibm who unveiled project debater that's
29:25
a new artificial intelligence program
29:28
that they said could successfully debate
29:30
against humans
29:31
it uses a library of millions of
29:33
documents from around the world to
29:34
create its arguments
29:36
the one problem with it is that it does
29:38
tend to hammer its points home it was
29:40
reported for instance that during the
29:42
space debate it repeated the point that
29:44
space exploration is beneficial to the
29:46
economy several times using very
29:49
slightly different words so it's not a
29:51
perfect technique but at least that
29:53
should not preclude project debater from
29:55
becoming president of the united states
29:57
ding ding ding there's a satire bell
30:01
art
30:02
so we've got some art awards to dish out
30:06
series of gongs does anyone have a bit
30:07
of art they like yeah there's an award
30:10
i'd like to give for hyper realism
30:12
and that is in hong kong cleaners
30:14
accidentally threw away a piece of art
30:16
and in their defense it did look like
30:17
rubbish this was swiss artist carol
30:20
may's work she had made an unhappy meal
30:23
by recreating a discarded mcdonald's box
30:25
but with a frown instead of the
30:27
trademark smile and so as a result the
30:29
cleaner saw it thought it was a bit of
30:30
old rubbish and chucked it away she said
30:33
initially i didn't find it funny at all
30:35
but later i realized it meant my
30:36
imitation had been a success
30:38
oh what a nice positive spin to put on
30:40
what was fundamentally a disaster
30:43
um i've got a gong to dish out for
30:45
street art
30:47
this is a bit of work by banksy so the
30:49
royal academy rejected a work by banksy
30:52
which he had submitted to their summer
30:54
exhibition under a pseudonym he
30:56
submitted it under the name brian s
30:58
gackman which is an anagram of banksy
31:00
anagram it's very clever
31:02
but it didn't get accepted and then a
31:04
month later the academy contacted banksy
31:07
asking if he would submit a piece to
31:08
their summer exhibition so he sent them
31:11
a very slightly altered version of the
31:12
same piece and they accepted it and they
31:14
said oh this is marvelous a gong i'd
31:16
like to give out for one piece of art is
31:19
the one called majestic splendor in
31:21
london's hayward art gallery so this is
31:23
an exhibit and it consisted of a
31:25
collection of rotten fish covered in
31:27
sequins
31:28
and it spontaneously combusted a fire
31:31
broke out in the gallery wow set fire to
31:34
itself
31:35
how does that happen if anything rots it
31:38
does make heat doesn't it yeah it does
31:40
so it must be that compost heaps say
31:41
sometimes spontaneously combust once did
31:44
that was really exciting it's like a
31:46
bonfire that you don't need to make
31:48
and for more on that you can hear the
31:49
audio book tales from the compost heap
31:52
canon gate 2020.
31:54
uh here's the world for performance art
31:57
that we want to give this is australian
31:59
artist mike parr who had himself buried
32:02
alive in a steel box under an open road
32:04
for 72 hours to symbolize the burial of
32:08
aboriginal history unfortunately the
32:10
chief of the tasmanian aboriginal center
32:12
wasn't exactly impressed he said the
32:15
idea of our aboriginal history being
32:17
hidden is a valid point the most
32:19
effective way of bringing it out is not
32:21
climbing under the road
32:23
asteroids
32:25
scientists concluded that birds escaped
32:27
death by asteroid thanks to their
32:28
inability to fly
32:31
according to a team of evolutionary
32:32
scientists the fossil record shows that
32:34
the asteroid that wiped out the
32:36
dinosaurs 66 million years ago destroyed
32:39
so much tree life that all flying birds
32:42
who lived in trees died out
32:44
this meant that only the flightless
32:46
ground-dwelling emu-like ones survived
32:49
and those survivors must therefore be
32:50
the common ancestors of all birds today
32:53
birds didn't re-learn to fly until
32:55
thousands of years later when the forest
32:57
returned
32:58
this year to avoid being hit by giant
33:00
asteroids in the future russian
33:02
scientists blasted tiny centimeter-wide
33:05
rocks with lasers simulating the effect
33:07
of nuclear bombs
33:09
they hope to be able to scale this up to
33:11
work on asteroids that are even wider
33:12
than an inch in future
33:15
not to be outdone nasa announced plans
33:17
for an 8-ton spaceship called hammer
33:20
which will be able to push an asteroid
33:21
out of the earth's path
33:24
japan also deployed asteroid striking
33:26
technology but for different reasons
33:28
its hayabusa ii spacecraft which has
33:31
spent the last four years traveling
33:32
through space arrived at its target the
33:35
ryugu asteroid currently located about
33:37
200 million miles away between earth and
33:40
mars
33:41
the plan is that next year hayabusa 2
33:43
will release a projectile that will
33:45
smash into the asteroid at a mile a
33:47
second making a crater that will be
33:49
filmed and beamed back to earth so that
33:51
astronomers can better understand how
33:53
craters are formed
33:54
according to one scientist the hayabusa2
33:57
projectile is a kinetic impactor which
34:00
is what we say in polite company when we
34:02
don't want to say the word bomb
34:04
look out he's got a kinetic impactor
34:08
astronauts
34:09
nasa sent a man with a fear of heights
34:12
to the international space station
34:15
astronaut andrew feustel who flew up to
34:17
the iss in march confessed to this mild
34:20
phobia not long before leaving on his
34:22
six-month space mission fortunately his
34:25
fear of heights doesn't affect him too
34:26
badly when he's 250 miles above the
34:29
planet but it is there he said
34:32
three months into his mission feustel
34:34
became the commander of the iss and
34:36
while on board conducted over 250
34:39
science investigations and technology
34:41
demonstrations
34:42
he also started a band called astro
34:44
hawaii which featured five of the iss
34:47
astronauts and cosmonauts their
34:49
instruments included two guitars two
34:51
flutes and an improvised drum which was
34:54
actually a metallic unit that stores all
34:56
of the russian cosmonauts feces
34:57
[Laughter]
34:59
in other astronaut news the world said
35:01
goodbye to two apollo moonwalkers in
35:03
january john young died he was a member
35:06
of the apollo 16 lunar mission and was
35:08
not only the ninth person to stand on
35:10
the moon but also sparked a review into
35:12
the safety of crumbs in space after he
35:14
sneaked a corned beef sandwich up there
35:17
five months later we lost alan bean who
35:20
as well as being the fourth man to stand
35:21
on the moon was also a painter
35:23
buzz aldrin will call me up sometimes
35:25
bean once said wanting to talk about
35:27
space stuff because he's really into
35:29
space stuff and i said quit talking to
35:31
me buzz i'm not an astronaut anymore i
35:33
don't call you to ask you what colors to
35:35
paint these things
35:37
meanwhile in india a father and son were
35:39
arrested after conning a businessman out
35:41
of 160 000 pounds by pretending to work
35:44
for nasa the pair successfully convinced
35:47
the man they had invented a device that
35:48
could generate electricity from
35:50
thunderbolts
35:52
they even performed a demonstration for
35:54
him in silver space suits
35:56
after the businessman realized he was
35:58
being duped by the pair the police were
35:59
called and the astronauts were arrested
36:03
nice thank you very much
36:06
attorneys
36:08
numerous lawyers refused to represent
36:10
the u.s president for fear he'd damaged
36:13
their reputation
36:15
when donald trump's lead attorney john
36:17
dowd resigned over a disagreement with
36:19
his client the president hunted for a
36:21
replacement to represent his interests
36:23
in the robert mueller-led investigation
36:24
into alleged russian meddling in the u.s
36:26
2016 election
36:28
however a number of lawyers who were
36:30
approached later said they turned the
36:32
offer down because they were concerned
36:34
that defending him might damage their
36:36
professional reputation
36:38
according to ted bootroos one of la's
36:41
top lawyers trump is a notoriously
36:43
difficult client who disregards the
36:45
advice of his lawyers and asks them to
36:47
engage in questionable activities
36:50
trump was eventually left with only two
36:52
lawyers on his legal team ty cobb and
36:54
jay sekulow neither of whom came from
36:56
traditional law firms eventually the
36:58
former mayor of new york rudy giuliani
37:00
joined the team
37:02
he's had dealings with donald before a
37:04
video from the year 2000 resurfaced this
37:06
year showing him at a charity event
37:08
dressed as a woman and calling trump a
37:10
dirty boy for touching his fake breasts
37:13
that doesn't sound like the president i
37:15
know
37:17
also we should add the fake breasts were
37:19
sort of part of the bra rudy giuliani
37:21
doesn't have actual
37:23
fake breasts right he doesn't have
37:24
breast implants is what you're saying
37:26
yeah he was just just dressed up yeah
37:28
the breast touching video was not the
37:30
only problem with trump's new lawyer the
37:32
dc bar website lists giuliani as an
37:34
inactive attorney meaning he's not
37:36
licensed to practice in the district of
37:38
columbia consequently should trump ever
37:40
have to appear in court during the
37:42
miller investigation his own lawyer
37:44
won't be able to attend
37:47
lawyers and breasts met again this year
37:49
when owing to a computer malfunction
37:51
every single lawyer in utah received a
37:54
photo of a woman's naked breasts can i
37:56
just interrupt you just for a second
37:57
just to say lori's in breasts met again
37:59
best sentence in the book thank you
38:01
that's my vote
38:03
agreed the now the utah state bar sent
38:06
an event invitation to all of them and
38:07
somehow managed to attach the image by
38:09
mistake
38:10
but despite technological hiccups courts
38:13
increasingly rely on machines to replace
38:15
humans
38:16
for instance the syria's fraud office
38:18
and the uk announced they'd be using
38:19
evidence-sifting robots on all their
38:21
casework in future
38:23
since one robot can scan more than half
38:25
a million documents a day
38:28
auctions
38:30
russell crowe held an auction called the
38:32
art of divorce on his wedding
38:34
anniversary the auction held at
38:36
sotheby's australia included a car used
38:38
on the day of crow's wedding and some
38:40
jewelry that once belonged to his
38:42
ex-wife danielle
38:44
crowe said the reason he had decided to
38:46
go ahead with it was that he was keen to
38:48
try and turn something bleak into
38:50
something joyful
38:51
the auction was streamed live on
38:53
facebook and lasted five hours during
38:55
which time members of the public were
38:56
able to bid on 227 lots that also
38:59
included a leather jock strap and a
39:02
life-sized rubber horse
39:04
seventy nine thousand seven hundred and
39:06
eighty eight dollars of the three point
39:07
seven million crow made in that auction
39:09
came from comedian john oliver's tv show
39:12
last week tonight which bought numerous
39:14
bits of crow memorabilia including the
39:16
jock strap which the actor wore in the
39:18
movie cinderella man
39:20
oliver then lent the underwear to an
39:21
alaskan blockbuster video store in the
39:24
hope that by displaying it the jockstrap
39:26
might attract more customers for them
39:28
the store has since closed
39:31
a joke feud then broke out with crowe
39:33
returning the gesture by using the
39:35
seventy nine thousand seven hundred and
39:37
eighty eight dollars to fund a ward at
39:39
australia's zoo's wildlife hospital to
39:41
treat chlamydia in koalas a plaque on
39:44
the wall of the ward now reads the john
39:46
oliver koala chlamydia ward
39:49
other auctions around the world featured
39:51
a broken teapot originally bought for 15
39:53
pounds which was sold for 575
39:56
000 pounds
39:58
the original map of winnie the pooh's
40:00

book illustration a 1973 job application
40:08
by steve jobs which fetched 174 thousand
40:11
dollars despite not identifying what job
40:14
jobs was applying for
40:16
and a lunch with billionaire warren
40:18
buffett was auctioned for 3.3 million
40:21
dollars was it a buffett sadly not
40:24
what a missed opportunity
40:26
and lastly a postcard from a passenger
40:28
aboard the titanic failed to sell when
40:31
it didn't meet its reserve of ten
40:32
thousand pounds addressed to a miss
40:35
green in birmingham it included the
40:37
words wish you were here it is a lovely
40:39

40:41

40:44

00:00
hi everyone welcome to the bit in
00:02
between christmas and new year where

00:09
thing as a fish day and what do we have
00:11
for you today we have the 2018
00:13
clip show all the best bits from this
00:15
year that didn't quite fit into the
00:17
actual episode so it's all new
00:19
you've never heard it they're all times
00:21
when we were just too silly too stupid
00:24
people are making mistakes there's loads
00:26
of outtakes
00:27
and we'll see you with a brand new
00:29
episode in 2019
00:31
so please enjoy it on with the show ho
00:34
ho
00:36
[Laughter]
00:38
[Music]
00:42
no
00:44
[Music]
00:49
okay my fact this week is that it might
00:50
look like anna is drinking a pint of
00:52
lime and soda but that is a pint of wine
00:58
and this is this is not a podcast this
01:01
is an intervention
01:03
[Laughter]
01:05
we love you we're worried about you
01:08
it's not a pint of wine it was a pint of
01:10
wine
01:15
there was only one wine glass in the
01:17
green room genuinely and andy hogged it
01:19
so i had no choice practically threw it
01:22
at me saying no no no
01:23
it's fine i'll use this okay none of
01:26
this could go in the podcast
01:29
so according to old english folklore if
01:32
you dream of gathering nuts then that's
01:34
a bad omen
01:35
oh um a there's an old english proverb
01:38
which is a good year for nuts is a good
01:40
year for babies
01:42
very true very true can you guess why
01:45
that is
01:46
um eat lots of nuts nope
01:50
um do they come do people used to think
01:53
that
01:53
when a nut fell from a tree it cracked
01:54
open and a baby came out yeah they
01:56
weren't idiots
01:59
no it's because gathering nuts was like
02:02
um you could do it
02:03
undercover as like a way of meeting
02:06
people of the opposite sex
02:08
yeah so you're like oh we're just going
02:10
gathering nuts
02:11
and then um you'd plant your seeds and
02:14
there's a there's a thing here we go
02:15
gathering nuts in may
02:16
yeah may is springtime so do you think
02:19
that could be a sexy
02:21
well weirdly uh that doesn't make any
02:23
sense because
02:25
no not yours i'm not rubbishing your
02:27
theory i think it's a really good theory
02:28
the rhyme itself obviously if you think
02:30
about it nuts aren't falling in may are
02:32
they
02:32
i don't know well you know
02:39
you know suburbs murray you do know what
02:43
happens in autumn
02:44
yes charlie conker's actually yeah nuts
02:47
yep
02:47
there you go with half a second's
02:48
thought we could have avoided this
02:51
i didn't so here we are i think we're
02:53
all pleased we had to go through it
02:55
though
02:55
um so what's gathering that's amazing so
02:57
actually it's thought that it's the
02:59
knots of may which is something that
03:00
they used to refer to hawthorne
03:02
so they're just gathering hawthorne but
03:04
that could have been a sexy thing to do
03:05
as well i think
03:06
yeah yeah um did you know that the first
03:08
ever aircraft carrier was for hot air
03:09
balloons
03:11
uh no it was it was in the u.s civil war
03:13
and they were used for reconnaissance
03:15
and it was called the general washington
03:16
park custis it was a converted
03:18
coal barge and it had its deck cleared
03:20
and it was used specifically
03:21
to store lots of the union um hot air
03:24
balloons
03:25
that was the first ever aircraft carrier
03:27
that's very
03:28
cool but it was it didn't fly itself no
03:32
much like a normal aircraft carrier
03:33
today
03:35
they just bob around on the ocean excuse
03:38
me this aircraft carrier is not
03:40
flying guitar i'd like a refund of my 50
03:43
billion dollars
03:48
i've only ever listened as far as the
03:49
word aircraft
03:52
the story of the first nativity i found
03:54
quite sweet so it was
03:56
created by francis of assisi it was in
03:58
1223 that was the first ever nativity
04:00
scene
04:01
and it was because you know he was the
04:02
patron saint of animals wasn't he he was
04:04
always shown with loads of
04:05
rabbits crawling all over him and stuff
04:09
in a nice way and he
04:12
wasn't constantly deluged with rabbits
04:14
and fighting them off and having to kill
04:16
them just
04:16
to get a bit of sleep at night why would
04:18
these rabbits leave me alone
04:20
drowning in rabbits yeah
04:23
when he got up for air to gasp for air
04:26
he said
04:27
let's make a nativity scene because at
04:28
that time the bible was read out in
04:30
latin in church at christmas and no one
04:32
knew what anyone was saying and he
04:33
really wanted it to become a bit more
04:35
uh relatable for people and for them to
04:36
actually understand what was going on
04:38
and so
04:38
it was done with real actors or well
04:41
probably not professional actors real
04:43
people it was done in a village in italy
04:46
and it involved a manger and a real ox
04:48
and a real donkey
04:50
and he quite sweetly it had a
04:53
wax model as the baby jesus and he tried
04:56
to explain as he was giving the sermon
04:58
that this was the baby jesus but he was
04:59
so overwhelmed with the motion that he
05:01
couldn't say the word jesus
05:03
so in the first century the word jesus
05:05
wasn't said he just kept on saying the
05:06
babe
05:07
of he bethlehem get it out
05:10
yeah but then it really took off from
05:12
there and the hay from that very first
05:14
nativity scene was then taken away by
05:16
all the onlookers
05:17
and fed to their farm animals and
05:18
apparently it cured them of all their
05:20
malaria and other diseases that's how
05:23
you
05:24
cure it how you do it magic hay horses
05:27
can only breathe through their noses
05:28
i didn't realize as opposed to their
05:30
mouths yeah sorry yeah of course
05:33
as opposed to the anuses i don't i don't
05:35
know where i was going
05:36
i saw you realizing halfway through that
05:39
question
05:39
what the alternative was suppose when
05:41
you see one a horse
05:42
in the cold and it's breathing it is
05:45
kind of the
05:46
the it comes out of the nose doesn't it
05:47
so it's the nostrils isn't it yeah so
05:49
don't tape up a horse's nostrils or
05:50
anything
05:51
no okay in case you were going to i have
05:54
to leave
05:55
[Laughter]
05:58
um churchill used to listen to
05:59
translations of hitler's speeches on a
06:01
gramophone and he would play back the
06:02
bits where hitler mentioned him by name
06:04
did he yeah that's very trumpy isn't it
06:07
yeah it is
06:08
yeah it is a bit oh why did he do it
06:11
what an inviter yeah is it just an ego
06:14
trip i don't know
06:15
i don't know i i regret mentioning it
06:20
um i was looking at some strange driving
06:23
rules that you can infringe
06:24
abroad in this country but um i didn't
06:27
realize this thing about parking rules
06:29
in various countries
06:30
can get so complicated so in various
06:32
countries but particularly in
06:34
sweden you have this system that they
06:35
call datum parkering
06:37
which is about parking on alternate
06:39
sides of the street depending on the
06:40
date
06:41
so if there's a certain sign on lots of
06:43
streets and what it means is if you see
06:45
this sign
06:46
then on the morning of odd dates then
06:48
you're not allowed to park on the side
06:49
of the street where the houses have odd
06:50
numbers
06:51
and on the morning of even dates you're
06:53
not allowed to park on the side of the
06:54
street but the houses have even numbers
06:56
and so if you park in the evening and
06:57
it's going to be there the next morning
06:58
you have to plan for the next morning
07:00
that it will be on the right side i mean
07:02
it just sounds like a way to get money
07:03
off foreigners doesn't it
07:05
yeah that sounds a bit like that um the
07:07
system in paris that they have where
07:09
only on wednesdays like mondays
07:12
wednesdays and fridays
07:13
odd numbered license plates are allowed
07:16
yeah
07:16
they did that in central or south
07:18
america it might be in mexico city and
07:19
what happened was just people bought two
07:21
yes they brought two cars and they were
07:23
ended up and they were always old cars
07:25
because they had to
07:26
buy two so they had to be cheaper and so
07:28
the pollution went way up
07:29
oh but is this this odd numbers houses
07:32
thing
07:32
seems to dictate as well in other
07:33
countries in belgium for the first half
07:35
of the month you can park on the side of
07:36
the road with odd house numbers and the
07:38
second half of the month with even
07:39
which is kind of hassle if you have to
07:40
jump out of your car and run up to the
07:42
front door and checking the house number
07:44
it's amazing i'm sure i'm 100 certain in
07:46
fact i know i've parked in belgium
07:48
yeah it's not every road there'll be a
07:50
sign and it's a it's a special sign that
07:51
they all recognize
07:53
there's not even any words on it it's
07:54
just a random image
07:56
that you definitely
07:58
[Laughter]
08:01
when i went to new york someone was
08:03
telling me that um the parking is
08:05
actually surprisingly if you're a
08:06
resident in kind of manhattan
08:07
it's actually surprisingly like easy and
08:10
cheap to park outside your house and
08:11
cost value nothing and the only rule is
08:13
that you have to once a week you have to
08:14
your car has to be out of the space for
08:16
two hours while they clean the street
08:18
it must be the same two hours for
08:19
everyone right otherwise it's a poor
08:20
street cleaner
08:21
every time he sees a car leave has to
08:23
jump in there yes
08:26
i'm just like wait a minute i think that
08:28
can't be true right there's no way
08:30
for two hours every week every single
08:32
car in town starts driving
08:34
it's not the same i'm sure there's a
08:36
rotor of streets where you know there's
08:38
like one two hours
08:40
hey man parking thing again yeah let's
08:42
all go shall we ridiculous assumption
08:43
that manhattan has one street clean he's
08:45
got two hours like a sort of like
08:46
cleaning santa to cover all of manhattan
08:49
it can't be done i'd like to see that
08:52
sitcom about that guy
08:54
no i think i think i think a christmas
08:56
festive film where he has to do it in
08:57
one night
08:59
picture if you type on a on a keyboard
09:02
and you're typing something you don't
09:03
look down you're one of those people who
09:05
who's got amazing words per minute so
09:07
they did a study in a university where
09:09
they got people to type 70 words per
09:11
minute that was the goal can you get
09:12
that
09:13
that fast and everyone 94 of the time
09:16
managed to do that
09:17
they then did a second test on them
09:19
which was
09:20
can you now write out where everything
09:23
on the keyboard is
09:24
qwerty can you write out the placings
09:26
and all they could manage was
09:28
at tops fifteen of the letters yeah of
09:30
the alphabet they had no
09:32
idea where the rest were and it's
09:34
because it's all automatic memory
09:35
something's going on the fingers are
09:36
doing the dancing
09:37
at that point and that's really
09:39
interesting that's like you know when
09:40
someone says what's your pin number if
09:42
someone's you know playing with your
09:43
card and often you have to go up and say
09:45
oh i need to type it in
09:46
you have that right yeah it's like that
09:49
it's exactly like it's in your fingers
09:51
the magic is here like this isn't a fact
09:54
but that is the worst feeling isn't it
09:56
where your fingers stop remembering
09:58
and then you just you've lost it yeah
10:00
there's no way to get your number back
10:01
then it's just
10:02
it's all over you're right is that just
10:03
me that's not just no that's me too
10:05
because yeah i i look away as well i'm
10:07
like oh come on and then when it's wrong
10:09
you're like oh you were my last like
10:11
this isn't even my laugh this
10:14
and that's then they say step away from
10:17
the atm machine
10:19
maybe it falls out when you cut your
10:21
nails
10:24
it's just a theory just a theory
10:28
something else that rained down to earth
10:30
was the earth's core
10:34
so the earth's car is made of iron
10:37
and the way that it got there we think
10:38
is a massive meteor comes in
10:41
hits the earth vaporizes goes into the
10:43
sky and then rains down and eventually
10:45
seeps into the center of the
10:47
planet oh so it's it tunneled its way in
10:50
kind of
10:50
well it's very denser isn't it than
10:52
anything else around it and that's what
10:53
it does
10:54
that would have been iron rain molten
10:56
iron rain yep
10:58
wow need a strong umbrella yeah
11:03
there's a there was another dog called
11:05
rolf it was a terrier and he spoke
11:07
through tapping his paw against
11:08
boards um each letter of the alphabet
11:11
represented by different tabs
11:13
so if you ask them all dogs are called
11:15
rolf
11:20
it's a real dad joke that one
11:29
i read about a um a bible themed
11:31
amusement park uh which is in buenos
11:33
aires tierra
11:34
santa and it is um it was meant to have
11:37
like roller coasters
11:38
and stuff like that they they didn't end
11:39
up doing that so it's a lot of sort of
11:41
plastic bible scenes that they've made
11:43
so the scale down has gone quite a bit
11:45
except for their one
11:47
centerpiece for the whole thing which is
11:49
that they have
11:50
in the distance with the hill a 40
11:53
foot tall animatronic jesus that
11:56
comes out from the side of the mountain
12:00
every hour as part of the resurrection
12:02
he resurrects
12:03
every hour of 40-foot jesus
12:08
out the side of the mountain but he
12:10
wasn't resurrected as a giant
12:13
no but he's really far away so maybe he
12:14
looks really close when he
12:16
when you see it wow that sounds
12:19
absolutely terrifying yeah
12:20
do you know where the largest jesus
12:22
statue in the world is just as a better
12:24
trivia
12:24
i would have said in rio de janeiro yeah
12:27
no there's a taller one um
12:28
in spybodzin in poland it's called
12:31
christ the king
12:32
it's 108 feet tall and it has
12:35
a wi-fi transmitter in its crown wow
12:40
just like the real jesus
12:43
any stuff on king louis the 13th of
12:45
france
12:46
some stuff yeah uh because he did not
12:48
come his hair until he was nine months
12:50
old well
12:50
he probably didn't do it at that age but
12:52
no one encounters her until he was nine
12:54
months old
12:55
uh and no one washed his legs until he
12:56
was five and he had his first breath
12:59
he had his first bath at the age of
13:00
seven what
13:02
what start somewhere
13:06
so sorry did they start with his legs so
13:09
or had they washed the rest of his body
13:11
and then they didn't get to his legs
13:12
until he was they washed his legs first
13:14
when he was five tepid water and then
13:16
when he was seven he had his first bath
13:18
and at that stage everything was clean
13:19
yeah
13:20
it's not like until he was five they
13:22
only just quickly dunked him at the bar
13:24
but they were holding his legs so
13:25
obviously you can't wash the legs no he
13:27
just didn't wash anything so they didn't
13:28
wash
13:28
anything so it was in the time when
13:30
washing was seen to be
13:31
perhaps not great for you yeah um his
13:34
hair's combed what more do you want
13:37
at one stage he boasted that he takes
13:39
after his father
13:40
and he smells of armpits yeah he was a
13:43
smelly man
13:44
he was but he was he had a horrible
13:46
upbringing i think his parents might
13:47
have just
13:48
not washed him out of spite he was a
13:50
very very sad man i grew to really like
13:52
him
13:53
and so his mother tried to keep the
13:55
throne for as long as possible so he was
13:57
made king officially i think about age
13:58
nine
13:59
but his mother was desperate to stay
14:00
region and hated her son
14:02
and so she would humiliate him or keep
14:05
him out of power so
14:06
once when he was 15 and he's king he's
14:08
in front of his court she just stood up
14:09
and slapped him in the face
14:11
um just to tell him off another time he
14:13
tried to attend a meeting of the royal
14:14
council that he was supposed to be
14:16
holding
14:16
and where upon the source i was reading
14:19
said whereupon she took him by the
14:20
shoulders and threw him out of it
14:23
so she was real harsh and she also
14:26
forced him
14:27
to sleep with his wife so
14:31
well you know almost every historian
14:32
concurs that he was gay
14:34
um and he never had any mysteries he
14:36
never showed any interest in women
14:37
showed a lot of interest in men
14:39
and he was married off to anne of
14:41
austria who was confusingly a spanish
14:43
queen
14:44
when they were both
14:47
that must have been so annoying for her
14:49
always being asked so what's it like in
14:51
austria
14:53
my parents just had a silly sense of
14:55
humor
14:55
[Laughter]
14:57
she anna austria of spain uh came over
15:00
her brother dave of denmark
15:05
um yeah she came over to marry him and
15:07
he had to be physically carried into the
15:09
wedding bed because he was desperate not
15:10
to sleep with her and he was really
15:12
freaked out
15:12
and two nurses were there to monitor the
15:14
act to make sure it happened because
15:16
otherwise you could sort of get an
15:17
annulment and that would ruin the
15:19
alliance between spain and france
15:21
and then he ran out of the bedroom as
15:23
soon as he'd done it and refused to even
15:24
enter it or eat with his wife or speak
15:26
to her for about six months
15:28
wow he had a regiment of croatian
15:30
mercenaries that he liked
15:32
who were actually from portugal
15:37
and they are famous for what reason
15:41
because they're uniform oh the crevasse
15:44
because they were cravats they were
15:45
neckties
15:47
and because uh kravitzka is croatian for
15:49
croatia
15:50
um they became known as cravats and
15:52
that's where we get the word from
15:54
oh that's so cool and he was also big on
15:56
wigs
15:57
he was sort of the original yeah he was
15:59
a big wig he was the original wig wearer
16:01
uh in in the way that kravatz sort of
16:03
became
16:04
fashionable he brought them back in wigs
16:06
back into fashion
16:08
as well so he was thinning in his hair
16:10
and he wanted to disguise that and
16:12
the surrounding friends all thought we
16:14
want to help you out and not make you
16:16
look like you're
16:17
the only person wearing a wig so they
16:18
wore wigs as well and then that spread
16:20
and everyone was wig wearing again
16:23
and anne of austria popularized hot
16:25
chocolate
16:26
did she yeah she brought it over from
16:28
spain
16:30
and it became an instant status symbol
16:32
and they said that only the aristocracy
16:34
were allowed to drink it and that was
16:35
true for a while and then after a while
16:37
everyone was allowed to drink it
16:38
in france i know i've said this before
16:41
it is easy to see why they had a
16:42
revolution
16:43
if they're saying only we can drink hot
16:44
chocolate
16:46
yeah i'm amazed it took 100 years after
16:48
this
16:50
there is a theory that there is a bonus
16:52
track hidden in the last supper
16:55
what do you mean is that the bread rolls
16:57
on the table
16:58
are a musical arrangement come on and if
17:00
you play
17:01
them if you play the bread rolls from
17:04
left to right along the last supper it
17:06
plays a tune
17:07
i love pete so presumably people have
17:09
done this
17:10
yes i clicked on it earlier today and it
17:13
said video
17:13
unavailable we just so we don't know
17:17
what the tune is
17:18
now no i like i i have actually heard it
17:21
um yeah and it's it's a it it's a tune
17:23
that does work
17:24
so it's um so i'm not making this up no
17:26
you're not making this thank you
17:27
yeah i don't know i mean the guy who
17:31
discovered it is insane
17:32
because it's not real it's not a real
17:34
thing
17:35
he's looked at bread rolls and thought
17:37
that looks like a quaver like that's not
17:38
a
17:40
it's not a thing did you guys hear about
17:42
the countdown thieves
17:43
in 2009 no so these were
17:46
some i think i might have read this in
17:48
the daily mail um
17:50
but these were thieves that the police
17:51
were hunting for who were stealing
17:54
bit letters from shop signs in
17:57
norwich they did it to seven stores over
17:59
three
18:00
nights and they were stealing specific
18:02
letters and then one of them was caught
18:04
on camera and was overheard saying i'm
18:06
just trying to spell my own name
18:08
and so then the police released the fact
18:10
that they were looking for people who
18:12
might be
18:12
called one of these names sam danny
18:16
allen lloyd glynn or manning because
18:19
they realize
18:22
he'd fallen on hard times
18:23
[Laughter]
18:25
i once tried to convince dan schreiber
18:28
um
18:28
that one of the lines in the english
18:30
national anthem was
18:32
oscar pistorius
18:35
is it everything else sort of seems to
18:37
rhyme with that
18:38
and he was like that's not true surely
18:40
you surely and like i was like when is
18:42
he gonna pull out his phone and google
18:43
it and he pulled out his phone he's like
18:45
it's not true right i was like no of
18:46
course it's not true
18:48
he's not gonna do anything he sounds
18:50
like an idiot yeah what a
18:52
um i discovered a few things that
18:53
genuinely surprised me about both ears
18:56
and what we can hear and what we can't
18:57
hear so first thing that shocked me is
18:58
that
18:59
um when we're asleep our ears are still
19:01
listening
19:02
isn't that weird well how do you think
19:04
loud noises where you are
19:12
[Applause]
19:16
i assumed that that was some sort of
19:18
like secret knock to let in like it's
19:21
just
19:22
if it's at a certain loudness then maybe
19:24
then you get woken up but
19:26
i did genuinely think that when you went
19:28
to sleep you sort of just
19:29
shut down and your ears kind of just
19:32
went okay
19:32
i'm taking the night off as well and you
19:34
are alone in thinking that i think
19:36
yeah really so let's move on to my next
19:40
amazing fact
19:43
apparently when uh this is a noise that
19:46
we can't hear that we make on our own
19:47
when you rub your forefinger and your
19:49
thumb together
19:50
you make an ultrasonic signal that
19:53
is so um it's it works so clearly that
19:56
uh people often use it to detect whether
19:59
a bat detector is working
20:01
so you rub it against a back detector
20:02
and that will give you a signal
20:04
so anyone listening i'm doing it now if
20:06
you just go to your bat detector
20:08
and um i wonder if over a podcast i can
20:10
set it off
20:11
well do you know that i'm so sorry
20:15
do you i mean james sorry what is a bat
20:17
detector yeah
20:18
who has bat detectors people with bats
20:22
what what is it what do you mean about
20:24
detectives something that's detecting
20:25
the ultrasonic sounds of bats like a
20:26
scientific instrument
20:28
must be yeah um but yeah that's dan
20:31
for the listener at home dan has been
20:33
rubbing his finger and thumb by the mic
20:34
for about 30 seconds now
20:36
and if i could get and your home will be
20:37
full of bats
20:41
did you know that laughing cow is comte
20:43
cheese
20:44
which i love sorry i don't know oh
20:47
maybe cheese no maybe this is just a
20:49
thing that we have in my family because
20:51
i love it
20:51
it's like really creamy nice european
20:54
cheese i don't think
20:55
your family the only people i don't
20:57
think there's a special turjinski family
20:59
cheese
21:00
cheese wow wow
21:03
it was a hard one and i tried it and it
21:04
didn't work out what about
21:06
yeah that's the obvious
21:11
the great pigeon race disaster
21:14
was something that anna posted about on
21:16
the qi boards a few years ago and that i
21:18
read about
21:18
do you remember that i i love it i
21:20
couldn't believe i've never mentioned it
21:21
before when all the pigeons disappeared
21:23
because there's an extremely famous
21:25
pigeon race
21:26
sorry extremely famous among pigeon
21:27
fancies and it's between paris and
21:30
london it's not between france and the
21:31
uk and it was in the 80s or 90s
21:34
it was from nantes to the uk to the
21:36
people's homes in the uk
21:38
uh and yeah there were sixty thousand
21:41
pigeons taking part and ninety percent
21:43
of them disappeared
21:44
and no it never happened like every year
21:47
before that they'd all arrive
21:50
there's a theory that there was a
21:52
concord
21:53
flight that was going over the channel
21:54
at the time and that disrupted their
21:56
magnetic impulses
22:00
oh okay so quite recently yeah and there
22:03
was one guy called tom rhoden
22:05
uh who lost his winning champion pigeon
22:07
whitetail
22:09
uh and five years later the pigeon was
22:11
on his doorstep
22:12
yeah oh no way five years i want
22:16
to see the movie about my husband
22:20
that's incredible do you think he opened
22:22
the door where the hell have you been
22:26
you heard of um bristol's punctuation
22:28
banksy
22:30
this is an amazing guy he was active at
22:32
least until last year
22:33
so he he goes around just correcting
22:35
poor punctuation
22:37
and there was an interview with him
22:38
recently he has built himself a device
22:40
he calls an apostrophizer
22:42
which is a very long-handled bit of kit
22:43
which allows him to either cover over an
22:45
apostrophe
22:46
shouldn't be there in a sign or add one
22:48
in
22:49
if he needs an extra one and someone
22:51
said to him what he was doing was
22:53
probably illegal
22:54
going around mucking around with
22:55
businesses science just for having an
22:56
apostrophe in the wrong place
22:57
and he said i'm sticking on a bit of
22:59
sticky back plastic
23:00
it's more of a crime to have the
23:01
apostrophe's wrong he's wrong about that
23:06
but he's been going since 2003. wow so
23:09
yeah
23:09
so he's been getting away with it that
23:11
long yeah and also been apprehended how
23:13
misspelt is bristol that he's still in
23:15
operation
23:16
is he only correcting the word bristol
23:18
yeah imagine if he felt that bristol had
23:20
two s's
23:22
he's like they've got it wrong again i
23:24
think it's not a full-time job
23:26
it's also not a job but he is called as
23:29
you say the banksy of punctuation or
23:31
apostrophe avenger so he's got you know
23:33
cool names they feel ironic to me
23:37
those names they feel self-given yeah
23:40
there is a national punctuation day in
23:42
america and
23:44
the cnn interviewed the guy is called
23:46
jeff rubin who set it up
23:47
he used to be a reporter and cnn wrote
23:50
that he grew increasingly frustrated as
23:51
he spotted errors in the newspaper
23:53
i quoted him i would sit at the kitchen
23:55
table with my red sharpie
23:56
screaming obscenities which would upset
23:58
my wife
24:01
she encouraged me to find another outlet
24:02
for my aggravation
24:04
so you set up national punctuation day
24:07
oh good on him
24:08
i mean good on yeah it's better for his
24:10
wife sort of i wonder if that has sold
24:12
his quite deep-seated character flaws
24:14
that i'm interpreting from that story
24:16
but whatever you had to do
24:20
they had things called dog dramas in the
24:22
19th century early 19th century where
24:24
the dog was like the hero of the play
24:26
so they would usually have other human
24:28
actors but the dog would do the
24:30
really heroic things there was one where
24:32
the show ended with a dog jumping in a
24:34
pool of water and saving a child
24:36
um but what would often happen is
24:38
mischievous theatergoers would throw
24:40
meat onto the stage to describe the nuts
24:44
it's so funny that's drowning a child
24:47
but
24:49
it's all good fun for the audience isn't
24:50
it so you know the idea of um just going
24:52
back to the fire of london
24:53
um did you guys know that the the sort
24:56
of there's a worshipful company of
24:57
bakers it's sort of the union of the
24:59
bakers they apologized officially
25:01
for it did that yeah 320 years later
25:05
um after the legal threat has diminished
25:09
well
25:10
it's never too late to apologize said
25:11
the then lord mayor of london who was
25:13
called alan
25:14
davis do you guys remember alan davis
25:17
that must have been only i remember the
25:18
guy who was in qi
25:19
yeah it's still in qi by the way he's
25:21
people here yeah he used to be the
25:23
mayor of london um yeah no no but alan
25:26
yeah alan davis i think around 1986 this
25:28
would have happened if it's 320 years
25:29
after 1666
25:31
and um sounds right i did work that out
25:34
and it did take ages as close as
25:37
i come to sounding intelligent um yeah
25:40
they they apologized officially for it
25:42
that's good that they admitted to it
25:44
finally because at the time
25:45
the french and the dutch were blamed all
25:47
across town and loads of french and
25:49
dutch were arrested
25:50
and i think they're just beaten up and
25:52
yeah beaten constantly so
25:54
we were at war or britain was at war
25:56
with france and the netherlands there
25:57
was sort of
25:58
protestant plots everywhere and so i
25:59
think there was a french woman who had
26:01
her breasts
26:01
cut off because people thought what she
26:03
was carrying was um like explosive
26:05
devices and it was just
26:06
it was chickens and chickens she was
26:08
carrying some chickens and people
26:10
thought they were fireballs
26:12
wow you would have thought in the
26:14
process of chopping off someone's
26:15
boobies
26:16
you would find out that they weren't
26:18
fireballs they were chicks
26:19
wouldn't you yeah you've gone too far
26:22
then you've got to go
26:22
through with it you're right there are
26:25
parallels with our current political
26:27
climate and unfortunately have we
26:30
progressed
26:31
yes there's the big breast cutting off
26:34
yeah
26:34
the 21st century yeah it's the horrific
26:37
metaphor that we
26:38
we find ourselves in wow in 2010
26:42
in belgium there was a guy who was
26:44
experimenting with the idea of solving
26:45
the problem of pigeons pooing all over
26:47
cities
26:48
so massive problem poo on your head poo
26:50
on car windows
26:55
what he's attempted to do and i don't
26:57
know if this has actually worked but
26:58
he's
26:58
tempted to create a special bacteria
27:01
that when it's fed to the pigeons it
27:02
metabolizes and when they defecate
27:05
what comes out is not poo but a soapy
27:07
like substance so they end up
27:09
cleaning your head shampooing your head
27:11
and
27:12
cleaning the streets i think you don't
27:14
want to squeeze a pigeon over your head
27:16
in the shower
27:18
um yeah so the idea is not make them poo
27:20
soap
27:21
not fair it's not fair but it's probably
27:23
impossible
27:24
but i just can't where's the waste
27:26
product going i mean there's poo
27:28
in that soap yeah there is
27:34
yeah i suppose what they're saying is
27:37
okay so there are soapy
27:38
molecules in there yep uh which will
27:41
attach to the
27:42
pooey substances and when it rains it'll
27:44
be easier to flush away
27:45
yeah it feels like
27:49
at some point um so yeah that must be
27:51
the that must be the logic unless these
27:52
pigeons are just growing bigger and
27:54
bigger and bigger and eventually they
27:55
just explode with their own feces but
27:57
that presents more problems to cleaning
27:59
up the city does
28:00
but this wasn't just a mad gut like they
28:04
were given a grant by
28:05
um the flemish architecture and design
28:06
committee and ministry of culture like
28:08
it's
28:08
it was a funded proper science sector to
28:10
go to the ministry of culture though
28:12
wouldn't you if you had this
28:13
slightly strange idea that's true
28:16
[Laughter]
28:18
there is a thing there's a this is
28:20
another amphipod uh which is
28:22
this is originally about and it's called
28:24
and i'm going to take a run-up at this
28:26
pseudomphithoides incavaria
28:28
it lives in the caribbean and it eats
28:30
seaweed and this is another really
28:31
sort of just a weird uh defense
28:34
mechanism in nature so the seaweed that
28:35
it eats
28:36
has chemicals which deter fish same deal
28:38
gives off toxic chemicals
28:40
but the amphipod it doesn't just eat it
28:43
it also
28:44
makes a little house for itself out of
28:47
this algae
28:48
uh and it has of its own food i guess
28:50
right yeah like a gingerbread house kind
28:52
of thing
28:53
yeah exactly like that and so exactly
28:56
like that and it it swims around
28:58
with its head and front legs sticking
29:00
out of this it's more like a sleeping
29:02
bag i guess
29:03
it's more than a gingerbread sleeping
29:05
bag
29:06
yeah or like a like a ham sleeping bag
29:17
you guys are going to be so surprised by
29:18
the laugh that comes after that when the
29:20
podcast comes out
29:22
you know i don't remember that being
29:23
nearly as funny on the night
29:27
um a lot of pigeons are being smuggled
29:29
out of syria at the moment
29:31
um so because syria was the
29:35
world leading pigeon breeding place so
29:38
in the middle east they say you know all
29:39
the best pigeon breeders are syrians
29:41
and now they're getting sent over the
29:42
border because obviously it's not safe
29:44
for them to be there anymore and pigeon
29:45
fanciers
29:46
in syria can't keep them anymore and so
29:48
there are lots of collectors who are
29:49
going on these kind of death defying
29:51
missions to get them there's a guy who's
29:52
spent
29:53
five million dollars on syrian pigeons
29:55
this is a guy called nasa who's a
29:56
jordanis
29:57
jordanian who's jordanian and
30:00
there was one instance where 70 pigeons
30:02
were killed when they were being
30:03
smuggled across the border and
30:05
they got caught in a fight so
30:08
yeah it's taken its toll on the poor
30:10
pigeons
30:11
but yeah they are they are really
30:12
valuable there that's amazing akbar the
30:15
great who was a mughal emperor around
30:17
there
30:18
uh in the 16th century he always
30:20
traveled wherever he went with his
30:21
personal colony of ten thousand pigeons
30:23
ten thousand what
30:26
they're only small i can have ten
30:28
thousand one rooms please
30:31
i don't think they all got their own
30:33
room
30:34
but they could like um some of them were
30:36
really beautiful some of them could do
30:37
tricks and tumble through the air and
30:39
you know some of them so the whole whole
30:42
thing
30:42
yeah did he name them all uh
30:45
i don't know i doubt it no he probably
30:49
named his favorite ones
30:50
yeah yeah that is impressive imagine
30:53
taking register every day
30:54
for that um do you guys know what's
30:58
happened to actually the original
30:59
manuscript of the origin of species on
31:01
the origin of species
31:03
um so it has various drawings on it
31:06
so for instance it has a drawing of a
31:08
green fish with pink legs and fins and a
31:10
bright blue
31:11
umbrella and this is covered in these
31:14
doodles
31:15
and this is because charles darwin was a
31:16
really fun dad so he wrote the origin of
31:18
species
31:19
and then he gave it to his kids and was
31:21
like well this i'm done with this now
31:22
i've had this idea
31:23
have that and it's covered in his kids
31:24
doodles cool and
31:26
so you think i raised the book and
31:28
thought maybe one day
31:29
animals will evolve to have an umbrella
31:32
yes
31:32
yeah maybe actually darwin discovered a
31:34
lot more than he led on
31:36
but you know he did we wanted to keep it
31:38
secret
31:39
yeah so he put around the story oh yeah
31:40
my kids just drew that weird creature
31:42
with
31:42
15 legs and an umbrella growing out of
31:46
it
31:46
yeah yeah so it was actually him who
31:48
drew it he was backtracking on his own
31:50
illustrations what i'm saying right
31:51
darwin drew all these secret animals
31:53
that
31:53
didn't exist because he thought if they
31:55
don't believe that relatively plausible
31:56
evolutionary stuff they're never gonna
31:58
believe in the umbrella fish
32:02
um another canadian thing what do you
32:04
know what the national animal of canada
32:05
is which i think is bit right it's not
32:06
abuse
32:08
it's a beaver yeah i just always think
32:09
it's such a great thing to have bears i
32:11
would
32:11
have picked that but um it's really
32:13
controversial they're not really into
32:14
having the beaver
32:15
um it's been debated whether they should
32:17
ditch it since the mid 19th century and
32:19
in 1964 i was reading a lecture that a
32:21
canadian historian gave
32:22
that complained that the beaver is
32:24
representative of english canada rather
32:26
than french and that means that it
32:28
represents a pretty intelligent animal
32:30
on a rather low level
32:32
who is very fond of work and has not
32:33
much idea beyond that
32:35
so that was his impression of what the
32:36
english element of canada had given to
32:38
the country that would be
32:39
represented
32:42
i'm not sure actually what would the
32:43
french um animal be
32:48
something with fur that was so cute that
32:50
we would kill
32:51
yes a bear yeah
32:56
[Laughter]
32:58
are we reintroducing beavers to scotland
33:00
at the moment isn't that happening
33:01
is that a happening thing yeah and very
33:04
interestingly when they were introduced
33:05
wolves in the various parks in north
33:07
america particularly uh
33:09
yellowstone uh it had this extraordinary
33:11
effect of increasing the
33:13
beaver population which uh no one had
33:16
considered but
33:16
just as sort of another example of how
33:18
interrelated everything is that the
33:20
wolves slightly kept down
33:22
the elks stroke moose and um
33:25
they didn't go as far south and they
33:26
didn't eat the young vegetation on which
33:28
the beavers
33:30
relied to to to make their to sort of
33:33
fluff up their dams okay so
33:36
they thrived because of the but miles
33:39
you know a thousand miles north where
33:41
the walls were was affecting the beavers
33:43
uh in the world wow you couldn't have
33:46
predicted that really
33:47
because it's marvelous it's like a
33:50
butterfly effect in a way it is
33:52
so i shouldn't mess with it yeah right
33:55
um another canadian thing one more thing
33:57
yeah poutine
33:59
so this is nice delicious yeah gravy
34:02
sort of gravy on gravy on chips yeah
34:04
with
34:04
curd
34:12
well the thing is in the french party
34:14
speaking in canada it's kind of
34:16
unusual sounding to them because in
34:18
france you don't call vladimir putin
34:20
putin
34:21
because in france putin means
34:23
prostitutes of course putin yes
34:25
yes so in france they all call him
34:27
vladimir putin
34:28
and so in canada they have like a
34:31
vladimir's poutine
34:32
restaurants
34:34
[Music]
34:36
do you know when the queen takes her
34:37
christmas um decorations down
34:40
um she's one of those weirdos who has
34:44
them up all
34:44
year round she waits till february
34:48
february the 6th and it's actually it's
34:49
quite sweet it's in honor of her father
34:51
who died on that day
34:52
and then they do these weird things when
34:54
they have their christmas dinners so
34:55
um this year meghan markle will be
34:58
weighed before she has her christmas
34:59
turkey
35:00
as will as will all of the royal members
35:02
they do this thing where they weigh them
35:04
they all stand on the way just the
35:05
numbers though the the people as well
35:07
right
35:10
sorry i'm ashamed
35:13
yes they they will be waiting royal
35:15
christmas dodger wayans
35:17
[Laughter]
35:21
so they yeah they weigh the full humans
35:24
and they
35:25
they then have the meal and then they
35:27
weigh them afterwards again to see
35:28
whether or not they've been
35:29
well fed enough that's the symbolic idea
35:32
of that
35:33
you have to you have to eat the most you
35:34
have to gain the most um
35:36
no i don't think it's a game i think
35:38
it's just a yeah it's just a tradition
35:40
and also the queen likes to wear this
35:42
again this is like you say a lot of this
35:43
stuff is put out there who knows if it's
35:45
true
35:45
um from their official sources but uh
35:47
she likes to wear
35:48
the paper crown from a cracker that's
35:50
her thing is she
35:52
quite nice image isn't it yeah it's
35:55
really nice
35:56
wouldn't it be great to to rig up prince
35:58
charles's cracker so there's never a
36:00
crown
36:05
[Applause]
36:08
[Music]
36:11
what we can inside
36:13
[Applause]
36:26
[Music]
36:28
you

=250
00:04
[Music]
00:10
[Applause]
00:13
[Music]
00:15
hello and welcome
00:16
to another episode of no such thing as a
00:18
fish a weekly podcast coming to you from
00:20
the qi offices in covent garden
00:22
my name is dan shriver i am sitting here
00:24
with andrew hunter murray
00:25
james harkin and anna chazinski and once
00:28
again we have gathered around the
00:29
microphones with our four
00:31
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:32
and in no particular order
00:34
here we go starting with you andy
00:37
my fact is that in 1833 the pyramid at
00:41
giza was almost dismantled
00:43
by the pasha of egypt so that he could
00:46
use the stones to build a dam
00:48
that's brilliant that's amazing and why
00:50
did he not do it in the end
00:52
he was talked out of it
00:53
[Laughter]
00:55
someone said he's sure you want to
00:56
destroy the most ancient site in the
00:59
world
00:59
he um so this was in 1833 and it was
01:02
when egypt was ottoman ruled so it
01:03
wasn't a local
01:05
egyptian ruler exactly and he was called
01:07
muhammad ali pasha
01:09
and he you know did a sort of cost
01:11
benefit analysis or he commissioned one
01:13
from a civil servant to see how much it
01:16
would cost and the civil servant was a
01:17
frenchman
01:18
and he thought maybe it wasn't a good
01:21
idea for the pyramid to be destroyed
01:23
and his name was linol louis maurice
01:26
and he was really young it was one of
01:27
his first jobs but i think he
01:29
you know the story goes that he thought
01:30
maybe this isn't a great idea
01:32
so he came up with this cost-benefit
01:34
analysis which said look this is going
01:35
to be quite expensive
01:36
and some of the stone isn't quite right
01:38
and i know it's pre-cut and i know
01:40
that's really convenient obviously
01:41
but maybe don't do it they did actually
01:43
take some blocks didn't they from one of
01:45
the pyramids
01:46
yeah it was one of the great pyramids
01:47
wasn't it yeah you can see that big gash
01:49
down the side of it
01:50
so it was the pyramid of menkaure
01:54
and it was a guy called sultan al-aziz
01:56
uthman and he was in the 12th century
01:58
and he decided to demolish the pyramids
02:00
because he thought that they were
02:02
not according to his religion let's put
02:04
it that way and they took
02:06
a few stones every day and after eight
02:08
months it came up
02:10
just like dad says just this tiny little
02:11
gash on the side of the pyramid because
02:13
they just realized that these things are
02:14
absolutely massive
02:15
so i was looking up people visiting the
02:17
pyramids and because it's about
02:19
them in the 19th century so it turns out
02:22
that people have been
02:23
scribbling on the pyramids for many many
02:26
years
02:27
and flo bear gustaflova great french
02:29
writer visited egypt in 1850
02:31
and he was so annoyed by all the
02:32
graffiti everywhere
02:34
he wrote to his uncle he said there was
02:35
a huge number of imbeciles names written
02:38
everywhere
02:39
and then he went to alexandria he was
02:40
really excited about alexandre and then
02:42
he wrote back saying
02:43
a certain thompson of sunderland has
02:45
inscribed his name in letters six feet
02:47
high on pompeii's column
02:49
it can be read a quarter of a mile off
02:51
there is no way of seeing the column
02:52
without seeing the name of thompson
02:54
this imbecile has become part of the
02:55
monument and is perpetuated with it
02:58
yeah i saw that and then um i also
03:00
thought well let me see if i can find
03:02
out who thompson from sunderland is
03:04
so i was googling for i spent quite a
03:06
lot this morning doing this actually
03:08
yeah
03:08
but i tried to find people called
03:10
thompson from sunderland around that
03:11
time and
03:12
what i reckon is there was a shipbuilder
03:14
called thompson
03:15
and he started his company about 15
03:17
years before this happened
03:19
and eventually became quite a big
03:21
shipbuilder in sunderland and
03:23
my guess is that's the kind of person
03:24
who would leave sunderland and go
03:26
to egypt to alexandria where this was
03:29
yeah
03:29
and maybe maybe that was an advert for
03:32
thompson of sunderland
03:33
rather than him writing his name because
03:35
it's in such big writing it's six feet
03:37
high
03:37
yeah it wouldn't that would make quite a
03:39
lot of sense i think that and also if
03:40
he's a shipbuilder he's got the tools to
03:41
do it probably
03:42
um yeah the victorians when they were
03:44
touristing all over it they
03:46
got much more access than we did so they
03:47
would be able to climb up all the time
03:49
and that was actually what they did
03:50
and they had picnics on top so there are
03:52
lots of pictures of victorians with big
03:54
picnic tables and drinking champagne on
03:56
top of pyramids way more fun well during
03:58
world war ii
03:59
it's one of the only stories i know of
04:00
my grandfather during world war ii
04:02
um he was very young but he got into it
04:05
uh by
04:06
lying about his age and he was a post
04:07
delivery man and he used to go past the
04:09
pyramids every day on his run so he was
04:11
stationed in egypt
04:13
and on days when there was not much post
04:14
he used to go and just sit on the
04:16
pyramids and have his lunch and just
04:17
watch out yeah so even then world war ii
04:19
i guess you know
04:20
see what we'll do yeah because they did
04:22
the same thing in world war one
04:23
the anzacs they were there and they used
04:25
to have races up the pyramids
04:27
oh really yeah which are quite hard to
04:29
climb it looks like little steps but
04:30
obviously when you're there they're
04:31
really big
04:32
um the first european visitors they were
04:34
offered sharp objects to make their own
04:36
marks by
04:36
arab guides as in you know to write your
04:38
little um
04:39
graffiti and stuff like that oh cool you
04:42
don't get that anymore yeah that's like
04:43
a stonehenge they used to do that
04:45
yes they did yeah we used to mention you
04:47
got given a pickaxe and a yeah
04:49
it was a chisel yeah
04:53
a chainsaw yeah i went to um stonehenge
04:56
at one of these times where they let you
04:57
go before all the tourists get there
04:59
and if you even look like you're
05:02
slightly touching one of these stones
05:04
they are not happy at all they're really
05:06
really and even if you try and
05:08
imagine someone was to do this try and
05:10
hide behind one of the stones so the
05:12
people in charge can't see you they
05:13
quickly run around to make sure that
05:15
you're not touching anything those
05:16
druids are pretty nifty aren't they
05:19
don't end up in druid prison what is it
05:22
they chop your hands off
05:23
well i never touched it anna so i
05:24
wouldn't know because
05:26
of course not um a lot of inscriptions
05:28
on the pyramids
05:29
are from the greek roman period
05:32
um there is one which says i visited and
05:35
i did not like anything
05:36
except the sarcophagus and then another
05:39
one says
05:39
i cannot read the hieroglyphs
05:41
[Laughter]
05:44
yeah exactly there's in the article that
05:46
i read which was in italy from the daily
05:48
mail they um said that it was quite
05:49
similar to tripadvisor
05:53
what i find the most amazing thing
05:54
actually about the pyramids is that we
05:56
don't know
05:57
what's inside them still so we've gone
06:00
to outside of the solar system and yet
06:02
still in the main pyramid and giza we
06:03
don't even know what's inside it there
06:04
was that discovery
06:06
last year that the there's a massive
06:09
chamber inside there's a cavity that's
06:10
30 meters long and it's above the what's
06:13
called the grand gallery so
06:15
there's like two like rooms chambers
06:18
where they thought the king and the
06:19
queen were probably kept although
06:21
they were all stolen so we're not
06:22
totally sure and then they've just done
06:24
this uh
06:25
technique where they use these sensors
06:27
that sense these particles called muons
06:29
and see what directions they're bouncing
06:30
off the pyramid in
06:32
and there's this massive chamber we
06:33
don't know about and i actually think
06:35
which is what one egyptologist said that
06:37
that's where the bodies are
06:39
because they said that they think
06:40
because they put lots of kind of fake
06:41
things in there anyway because they
06:42
really wanted to deter robbers so they
06:44
said oh yeah this is the king's chamber
06:46
here
06:46
but actually i believe that's where the
06:47
aliens are exactly
06:49
and the aliens well hanging out with
06:51
king and queen yeah yeah of course you
06:53
would this new chamber that they found
06:54
isn't it the case that it's so
06:56
mysterious that they can't even call it
06:58
a chamber they've got
06:59
they call it the void or something like
07:01
that i don't think they're doing that to
07:03
pique your curiosity rather than it's so
07:04
mysterious they just know it's a big
07:06
they're not allowed to call it a chain
07:08
it's not a chamber it doesn't it doesn't
07:10
uh fit the word when i read when i was
07:12
going to read harry potter in the
07:13
chamber of secrets i'm like well where's
07:15
the secret it's a chamber
07:16
it should be called the void of secrets
07:18
um
07:19
uh i was going no no no no do you know
07:21
what mummy wheat is
07:23
mummy wheat yeah no so we've covered i
07:25
think before the mummy craze
07:26
where in the victorian times people had
07:28
mummy unwrapping ceremonies and they had
07:30
brass bands accompanying it and it was
07:31
all very exciting and
07:33
amazing people like mummy brown and
07:34
mummy whoever or mummy pettigrew
07:36
um so mummy wheat was wheat that was
07:39
grown from seeds which had allegedly
07:41
been found in mummy's bandages
07:44
and this was a craze people got really
07:47
excited about wheat that was
07:49
allegedly from 3000 years ago growing
07:52
into proper plants
07:53
and there were all these articles
07:54
published about for example ancient
07:56
cubs of corn because you know we've got
07:58
ancient egyptian sweet corn growing and
08:00
obviously it was almost certainly not
08:02
true
08:03
you don't want your food ancient most of
08:05
the time do you it's kind
08:06
i can see it's kind of exciting they'd
08:08
also when they're mummifying people i
08:10
think you know you learn in school
08:11
they put a hook up your nose and they
08:13
take your brains out and stuff and they
08:14
also took your eyeballs out
08:16
and they often replace them with various
08:18
things so they replace your eyeballs
08:19
with
08:20
shells or with linen apparently or with
08:22
painted onions
08:23
so there is the most famous pharaohs
08:25
were found with just painted onions
08:27
instead of ice
08:28
cool it's quite weird that is cool
08:29
they're quite fun like like kind of a
08:31
snowman or something yeah
08:32
what vegetable is most like an eye they
08:35
didn't have carrots for noses though did
08:36
they don't know
08:41
um i was quickly looking into because
08:43
this is a famous monument that was
08:45
almost destroyed
08:46
if this guy's planted went forward and i
08:48
was looking at other monuments that have
08:50
almost been destroyed
08:51
um so the colosseum uh that got hit by
08:55
lightning in 200 the year 217 which
08:58
caused huge huge destruction and as a
09:00
result um
09:01
they just started pillaging the actual
09:03
colosseum so two-thirds of it
09:05
went and then something was put in place
09:07
to say stop this is now this
09:08
we're keeping this as is so we got to
09:10
keep that the washington monument
09:12
was almost destroyed in even before it
09:14
was fully made when all the materials
09:16
were being donated the pope
09:18
donated a beautiful rock to go to it um
09:20
but there was a group in america
09:22
he's got so much stuff
09:25
generous man you're humble though humble
09:28
oh yeah i'm sorry i'm so humble i can
09:30
only give you this nice rock
09:32
yeah it was pope pius the night that he
09:33
gave a rock
09:35
i'm so pious um and it was it was a
09:38
party that were known as the no nothings
09:40
and the know nothing's uh tried to
09:42
prevent it so they
09:43
yeah so what they did was they stole the
09:45
rock that the pope gave
09:47
and they dumped it into the the potomac
09:49
river and um
09:50
and then eventually further down the
09:52
line the know-nothings
09:53
became the actual company that were
09:55
building it and bankrupt them
09:56
so that they weren't able to do it and
09:58
eventually it got they you know they
10:00
weren't able to stop it can i just ask
10:01
is this amazing rock that the pope gave
10:04
still in the river
10:05
i think they got it out i think they
10:06
eventually found it yeah
10:08
um because you're not going to leave a
10:10
pope's rock in a river aren't you
10:12
yeah they think they they think some
10:14
people within it admitted to where it
10:15
was and where they'd throw it
10:18
[Laughter]
10:28
[Music]
10:31
okay it's time for fact number two and
10:33
that is
10:34
my fact my fact this week is that
10:36
psychologist herman rorschach thought
10:38
his test wouldn't work on teenagers
10:40
as they were the same as psychopaths
10:43
um yeah so this is uh the man who
10:46
invented
10:47
the rorschach inkblot if you can think
10:49
of any time you've been showing some
10:51
weird ink blots
10:52
that's the man who created it we all
10:54
have at some stage in our lives yeah and
10:55
we've had our psychological testing
10:57
we've all done that right yeah
10:58
and um he uh yeah it was a uh
11:01
thing that he he wasn't sure how it
11:03
worked he wasn't sure if it worked but
11:05
he definitely thought it couldn't work
11:06
with teenagers because
11:08
it just was they were two uh
11:10
particularly 14 year olds they were just
11:12
too unpredictable and and it was just
11:14
too similar in characteristics to
11:16
what all the characteristics then in a
11:18
14 year old that he thought made them
11:19
similar to a psychopath
11:20
i think it's emotional turbulence and
11:22
it's a crazy mixed up time and
11:24
there's all sorts of stuff going on and
11:26
things are changing
11:27
you know changing growing yeah you guys
11:30
need to have some more psychological
11:31
tests
11:34
um yes so um i think he did think it
11:36
worked but like you say he didn't know
11:38
why it worked
11:39
but a lot of the people in germany at
11:41
the time did not think it worked
11:43
uh and they called his blobs crude
11:47
other blobs this is taking me right back
11:50
to
11:51
my own teenage years having your blobs
11:53
called crews
11:55
and he um very sadly died at the age of
11:57
37
11:59
yeah which is over 37 year old is
12:01
absolutely heartbreaking
12:03
uh and but then it was the year after he
12:05
died that they kind of got a bit of
12:08
recognition in the community and still
12:10
today i suppose we don't know if they
12:11
work or not probably
12:12
they don't really but he didn't think
12:13
they worked for
12:15
detecting personality types really in
12:16
the way that they are kind of sometimes
12:18
used today so
12:19
we should say the rorschach test it's
12:20
when you get shown an ink blot and it's
12:22
sort of a mirror image because it's when
12:24
paper's been folded over with wet ink
12:26
and then you're asked what you see in it
12:28
do you see a cow
12:29
do you see someone being brutally
12:30
murdered do you just see a blob and
12:33
he invented this beautiful beautiful
12:35
stone at the bottom of a river
12:43
[Laughter]
12:51
i just waited for someone to say that
12:53
christ christ pointy hat
12:55
wafer he's the pope
12:58
um but yeah he didn't think that it
13:00
determined whether you were the pope or
13:01
whether you were a
13:02
smart person or a horrible person
13:04
whatever he just thought it could
13:06
um diagnose schizophrenia so he was a
13:07
psychiatrist and he just noticed he had
13:10
been really
13:10
into these things as a kid and he
13:13
noticed that schizophrenics had
13:14
different responses to them
13:16
than normal people so who just thought
13:17
you know you could spot schizophrenic
13:18
yeah he was so into them by the way that
13:20
as a child
13:21
uh when he was at school his nickname
13:23
was inkblot
13:24
not that actually as a word it was kleck
13:26
but that that was uh
13:28
yeah so it was a children's game
13:29
originally it's called clexography
13:32
and he got nicknamed and you just you
13:34
did exactly the same thing you poured
13:35
ink on a bit of paper you folded it and
13:36
then you saw what images you could make
13:37
it's like looking at clouds or something
13:39
like this
13:40
this i didn't really get this so it's
13:41
it's not about whether you see
13:44
as anna says a murderer or a flower in
13:47
the image
13:47
he was really interested in what kind of
13:49
things people saw so
13:51
he said there were three categories
13:52
which were form movement and color so
13:54
form is whether you see a donkey or a
13:55
bear or a knife or whatever
13:57
and then movement is whether you see you
14:00
know a donkey um offering
14:02
a man a sandwich or something or
14:04
whatever a dancing woman yeah a dancing
14:05
woman is better than a doggie or
14:06
frigging man a sandwich um
14:08
but his main interest in all of this was
14:11
whether the answer was good or poor
14:13
so he basically he thought right i think
14:15
these look like particular things
14:17
and if you see something which is
14:19
broadly moth like and you say a moth or
14:21
one of another you know reasonably
14:23
appropriate answer
14:24
uh then you're probably fine and if not
14:27
then that's
14:28
maybe problematic that's a problematic
14:29
indicator for your personality
14:31
yeah and we should also say that it's
14:33
not a case of putting ink on
14:34
a bit of paper and then folding it over
14:36
the blots are actually quite specific
14:38
aren't they
14:39
yeah um so they have to look blottish
14:41
because if they look deliberately
14:42
crafted then people
14:43
might think well there's a specific
14:44
cancer that i need to go for
14:46
um but also he didn't want brushstrokes
14:49
so it looked like someone had painted it
14:51
so
14:51
quite specific yeah and what's amazing
14:53
this was 1921 that he
14:55
created them so they really kicked off
14:56
in 37 but they're still used to this day
14:59
and it's the exact same 10 inkblots that
15:02
he created in 1921 so even though maybe
15:05
people are thinking oh we can advance
15:06
this as a as an idea they still have not
15:08
gone any further than the 10 he created
15:10
yeah so if anyone shows you them
15:12
don't say for instance television
15:14
because there was no televisions then
15:15
don't say iphones
15:16
because there were no iphones you have
15:18
to think i need to go for something that
15:20
was around
15:20
in the 1920s so like the end of the war
15:28
[Laughter]
15:32
or a television they'll say this man is
15:33
insane or
15:35
prophetic yeah
15:39
have you guys done it i did i've done
15:41
the first few
15:42
yeah you didn't have the patience to do
15:43
the full 10. well actually i wanted to
15:45
save myself in case i need to be tested
15:47
in future with a rorschach test because
15:49
they got really funny about people um so
15:52
they were published in a book in the 70s
15:54
and a lot of doctors who believed in
15:56
them and used them said
15:57
this is going to completely screw up our
15:59
results because it came with answers of
16:00
what to say and what not to say
16:02
yeah i did it today did you did anyone
16:04
else do it we did it over christmas
16:05
dinner last year
16:06
did you yeah what did so what did you
16:08
did it give you a pizza i got taken away
16:09
by a guy
16:10
like that uh i can't remember actually
16:14
but it's just like you know it's these
16:15
days a lot of people use it as like a
16:17
parlor game to me yeah i don't know
16:19
maybe up in your household
16:20
we just get pissed on christmas day and
16:22
eat pudding
16:23
um sure but i'll do the raw shack test
16:26
this christmas yeah
16:27
it's more fun well i do it today and it
16:28
gives you a sickness percentage at the
16:30
end of how sick it thinks you are
16:32
you did the buzzfeed version yeah you
16:33
didn't you won't believe blob number
16:37
seven
16:39
but no i got i got 66 which it says is a
16:41
little worrisome
16:42
well do you know how many out of the ten
16:44
were worrisome because there's a very
16:45
specific way that
16:46
you're supposed to do it yeah so the
16:47
proper test is there are 10 things
16:50
and if you get more than four
16:53
images classified as worrisome then
16:56
it is you might be virgin schizophrenic
16:58
and then less than four is fine and the
17:00
average is two so if you look at the
17:02
graph so it might be that if you got 66
17:04
you saw three images that were worrisome
17:06
but that puts you right in normal
17:07
right um so you don't know how many you
17:09
got out of ten
17:10
no it was uh it wasn't buzzfeed it was
17:13
something not as classy as that it
17:14
didn't really have
17:15
any kind of but you have a lot of
17:17
viruses
17:19
they tried it on their computers on
17:21
robots didn't they quite recently
17:23
um they gave a load of inkblots to
17:25
robots uh robot one
17:26
saw one and said it was a mask robot two
17:29
saw one and said it was a pin
17:31
robot three said it meant isolated and
17:33
robot four said this is the rorschach
17:35
test
17:35
[Laughter]
17:39
imagine if you went into the
17:40
psychologist's office what do you see
17:42
here i see the roger
17:44
i just say that for every single answer
17:46
poor old robot three
17:48
no one's worrying about him though
17:49
sounds like he needs some help
17:51
yeah good pipe so i looked at some other
17:54
psychological tests from the 20th
17:55
century okay and some of them are pretty
17:58
weird um so there's the rosensweig
18:00
picture frustration study from 1978.
18:03
and this is really fun so it gives you
18:04
lots of cartoon images and
18:06
it's um people who are in frustrating
18:09
city all men by the way people in
18:10
frustrating situations
18:12
all men and one bubble from the other
18:15
person who is the frustrator
18:17
in all of these cartoon scenarios is
18:19
already filled in
18:20
and you have to fill in your response as
18:23
the man who is being frustrated
18:24
so can i would it be like someone whose
18:27
car is being given a ticket by a traffic
18:28
warden or something
18:29
exactly yeah so there's an example of
18:32
someone on a train
18:33
and someone a woman is saying to him
18:34
here's the newspaper i borrowed i'm
18:36
sorry the baby tore it
18:38
so these are i think relatively minor
18:39
frustrations if you punch the baby
18:42
then you're fine you have to fill in the
18:44
cartoon bubble
18:45
so i'm about to punch that baby is that
18:47
what you said yeah that would that would
18:49
be a con
18:50
mark of concern i mean what page of the
18:54
newspaper was it can't
18:55
as long as it wasn't the uh crossword
18:57
that would be printed
18:58
okay so you would write was it the
19:00
crossword page he taught if it is i'm
19:02
going to punch the baby
19:04
yeah all the spots pages
19:08
or actually the tv review i wanted to
19:10
read that
19:11
yeah so there's that one which sounds
19:13
pretty good there was the 1942 make a
19:15
picture story test
19:17
this is really fun so it gives you 67
19:20
little
19:21
p little people in on paper who are cut
19:24
out
19:25
and there are all sorts of different
19:27
people and there are
19:29
humans and there are there are ghosts
19:31
there's a superhero
19:32
there's a one-legged man there's a
19:33
cocker spaniel there's a policeman
19:34
there's santa claus
19:36
there are women some women clothed
19:37
somewhere with naked and you have to
19:39
make a scene with them
19:40
and then you make up a story about the
19:42
scene and the psychologist analyzes
19:44
the scene the first thing that came into
19:46
my head was you know
19:47
do you remember the benny hill show yeah
19:49
so the naked woman is running
19:52
and then santa claus at the bottom like
19:53
a man the spaniel
19:55
are all running after him sorry so what
19:57
does that mean
19:58
i think that means that you fell into a
20:00
coma in the 70s
20:01
and you haven't been able to update your
20:04
memory ever since
20:06
um personality tests did get really
20:08
popular around that time though it was
20:10
sort of the 40s
20:11
when the rorschach test and other stuff
20:13
became a thing and the idea of
20:15
a character making you good at your job
20:17
and so in the 50s people would often get
20:20
tested on their personalities when
20:21
they're applying for jobs but they were
20:22
looking for different stuff in the 50s
20:24
it was that era where
20:26
everyone was quite gray um and the
20:29
traits that people wanted as employers
20:31
were things like being really hard
20:32
working and diligent
20:33
very loyal very conformist and in fact
20:36
in the early 50s the navy put out a
20:38
handbook with the proper way to deal
20:40
with a dissenting colleague
20:41
if you're in an office or a conference
20:43
or whatever and this is what it said
20:45
so if a colleague dissents or disagrees
20:47
fail to hear his objections
20:49
or if you must hear them misunderstand
20:52
them
20:55
the aim is to make him feel like he
20:56
belongs it just seems a bizarre way to
20:58
achieve that
20:59
and then it says if he persists ask him
21:01
to clarify his position
21:02
and then ask him to clarify his
21:04
clarification etc etc
21:06
until our lad is so hot and bothered
21:08
that he's worked himself into the role
21:09
of conference comedian
21:10
so basically ignore ignore ignore
21:12
humiliate is that the british navy
21:14
yeah it was the navy this is the best
21:15
way to deal with colleagues actually
21:17
ignoring or ignore humiliate does seem
21:19
like your role on this podcast
21:22
for the rest of us the only book i've
21:24
ever read
21:32
okay it is time for fact number three
21:34
and that
21:35
is anna my fact this week is that robert
21:38
falcon scott's
21:39
dying wish was for his son to get into
21:41
nature
21:43
peter scott went on to found the world
21:45
wildlife fund and designed its panda
21:47
logo
21:48
very very cool how nice is that so um
21:51
so this is when he was this is when
21:53
scott was in the south pole uh he was
21:55
stuck in his tent he was a hundred
21:57
percent sure he was about to die so he
21:58
thought he'd write a few letters
22:00
as you do and his last letter was to his
22:03
wife
22:03
so it's 1912 he's cold in a tent he's
22:05
managing somehow to get his hand around
22:07
a pen
22:07
and he says to his wife make sure when
22:10
you're raising our
22:11
son make the boy interested in nature
22:13
and that boy was peter scott
22:15
and yeah he founded the wwf very
22:18
exciting this fact isn't it because
22:20
two sort of seminal things polar
22:23
exploration
22:24
and conserving animals are connected and
22:26
i had no idea through one generation
22:28
well two generations so robert falcon
22:29
scott we should say he
22:31
made it didn't he to the south pole yeah
22:33
with his team
22:34
but they weren't the first that they
22:35
were beaten by the norwegians and then
22:38
on the way back they were close to
22:40
a depot but they were only about 10
22:42
miles away and then he died and he wrote
22:43
all these letters
22:44
in the tent just as they were dying yes
22:46
and the letter says make the boy
22:48
interested in natural history if you can
22:51
it is better than although
22:54
he was quite good at games in the end
22:56
because he won a bronze medal at the
22:58
1936 berlin olympics
23:00
in the oh jolly dingy class of sailing
23:03
so he was a dinghy sailor that was one
23:06
of the big hitters wasn't it yeah
23:07
in the olympics well he's the reigning
23:09
bronze medalist isn't he because they
23:10
never did it again
23:12
it was the one and only time the odingy
23:14
got a got an outing at the olympics
23:17
so that's a cool record he um he's an
23:20
amazing character peter scott
23:21
never properly heard of him before but
23:23
uh someone who's
23:25
at one point i think in the uk was a
23:26
household name a lot of older listeners
23:28
might actually go yeah of course we know
23:30
who he is he was on a lot of natural
23:32
history tv for the bbc
23:34
fact back in the day he was on the very
23:35
first um color
23:37
tv program from the natural history
23:39
department um and that was in 1968
23:42
it was called the private life of the
23:43
kingfisher and he narrated it
23:45
oh i see because kingfishers are quite
23:47
colorful because you wouldn't go for the
23:49
private life of the zebra
23:50
or something like that they've
23:52
deliberately chosen an animal which is
23:54
quite colorful
23:55
yes well just on that point um it is
23:58
said i got told this by my friend simon
23:59
watts
24:00
mentioned it years and years ago on this
24:02
podcast but supposedly one of the
24:04
reasons for picking the panda as
24:05
the logo for wwf was the fact that it
24:08
was black and white so printing costs
24:10
when they were printing out the you know
24:12
with headers would be uh
24:13
cheaper that's clever they could have
24:15
just picked something really really
24:17
small like a microbe
24:18
yes and then it would just be a printing
24:20
just one dot
24:21
that would be cheaper yeah yeah that's
24:23
true it would it's a bit less evocative
24:25
isn't it yeah
24:26
it's the dot yeah it's important though
24:29
um
24:30
one other thing he did he gave the loch
24:32
ness
24:33
monster a name yeah proper scientific
24:36
name
24:36
he called it necitaras rombopteryx
24:40
allegedly so it could be registered as
24:41
endangered which yeah i guess it is
24:44
now if i'd said he'd given him a proper
24:46
scientific name you would have jumped
24:48
down my throat there
24:49
and said it's not real i know what you
24:52
mean
24:52
i think i it's it was a joke was it or
24:55
not
24:55
i don't know if he was joking or not
24:57
well you know there was that whole thing
24:58
about the
24:59
the name that he did give it so it was a
25:01
it was an ancient greek name for the
25:02
monster of the nest with the
25:03
diamond-shaped fin
25:04
and that came out as um this address
25:07
from bob dirks
25:08
yes and supposedly when someone looked
25:12
into it they found that there was an
25:13
anagram
25:14
of monster hoax by sir peter s
25:17
oh well in that case it probably was a
25:19
joke well no i mean i mean at
25:21
a grabs you could you can james always
25:23
is saying this you can make anagrams out
25:24
of anything
25:25
well we did say this in a recent podcast
25:27
where we did a load of anagrams and
25:28
people can be very clever in anagrams
25:30
and find meaning that isn't necessarily
25:32
there why would he say it's got
25:34
diamond-shaped fins
25:35
yes that made it much easier for him to
25:36
put monster hopes by sir peter s
25:38
yeah right i think he believed it what
25:40
he he did he did
25:42
send um a proposal to buckingham palace
25:44
asking if he could name
25:46
loch ness monster after the queen queen
25:48
elizabeth ii
25:49
so it was going to be called elizabeth
25:51
nessie or something along those lines
25:53
but
25:53
first name elizabeth for the loch ness
25:55
monster and uh supposedly the queen
25:58
did consider it but the uh the people of
26:00
buckingham palace said
26:01
uh no no no no thank you
26:04
so i should say where i got this fact by
26:06
the way it's from a new book that's just
26:08
come out called
26:09
what a hazard a letter is and it's sort
26:11
of about all the
26:12
letters in history that either were
26:14
never sent or that were never properly
26:16
received
26:17
uh or we only found years later it looks
26:19
like a really really interesting book
26:21
i've only read a bit of it and i got
26:22
this from a review
26:24
but there's another piece in it actually
26:25
which is about the composer eric sarty
26:28
which i really liked is kind of tragic
26:30
but amusing at the same time
26:32
this is so eric sarsi had this six-month
26:35
relationship with an artist called susan
26:37
valadon
26:38
and then she broke up with him and that
26:40
was the end of it as far as anyone knew
26:42
and then when he died 30 years later
26:44
they went into his house
26:46
and they found just thousands and
26:48
thousands of letters that he'd written
26:49
every single day to her but never sent
26:51
love
26:52
letters so he died and like he literally
26:54
spent 30 years writing love letters
26:56
and then he so they got in touch with
26:58
susan still alive
27:00
like hey eric had a thing for you and
27:02
gave her all these letters and she
27:04
immediately burned them
27:05
as you would i was probably very
27:08
delighted that that relationship
27:10
ended when it did yes exactly yeah got
27:12
out of that one
27:13
in the nick of time um one last thing um
27:16
peter scott just to
27:18
to mention again how incredible his
27:20
career was one of the other things he
27:21
did was
27:22
um during the war he designed camouflage
27:25
ideas for painting on the side of ships
27:28
so that you could camouflage a ship in
27:29
the ocean and
27:31
they worked so well that two ships that
27:32
were painted with the same camouflage
27:34
crashed into each other um yeah so uh
27:38
and
27:38
and one of them was called hms broke um
27:40
so yeah not the best name to
27:43
to name a ship but yeah it did break you
27:45
know how soldiers used to all dress in
27:47
very bright
27:48
colors and then the camouflage well you
27:50
know the british army
27:51
the bright red uniforms in the 19th
27:53
century and then
27:54
that was because most battlefields were
27:56
so covered in smoke from guns and
27:58
chaos that you couldn't it wasn't
28:00
dangerous to troops to dress them in
28:02
bright colours i didn't know right so
28:03
if you had a an army a duke leading a
28:05
regiment he get
28:06
he got to kitted out and he would pick
28:08
whatever color he liked basically
28:09
like football kits right yeah exactly
28:11
yeah and you wanted something flashy and
28:13
then as the smoke started to clear from
28:14
battlegrounds it suddenly became obvious
28:16
that having everyone dressed in bright
28:17
red is probably not a good
28:19
tactic i just wonder if there was a
28:20
period where all ships were extremely
28:22
bright colors
28:23
and they suddenly thought maybe this
28:24
isn't a great idea yeah
28:26
yeah about football kits they um there
28:29
was once a football
28:29
game which i don't know if you'll
28:31
remember you probably won't but it was
28:32
the first time man united had
28:34
won their new gray kit and then halfway
28:37
through the match they realized that
28:38
they couldn't see each other because
28:40
they were camouflaged against the crowd
28:42
so they just kept passing to the crowd
28:43
because they couldn't see oh my god
28:44
that's so funny and then at half time
28:46
they had to swap all their shirts back
28:48
though if the other team can't see you
28:50
well in american football they have
28:52
rules
28:53
that the pitch has to be a particular
28:55
shade of green
28:56
and that's because there was once a team
28:58
who had a blue jerseys
29:00
and they painted the entire grass blue
29:02
so the other team couldn't see
29:06
i love the idea that if in war you have
29:08
a home an away kit
29:10
and you and you know you're losing
29:12
against the invading army when they
29:13
suddenly change their kit to home
29:24
okay it is time for our final fact of
29:26
the show and that is
29:27
james okay my fact this week is that a
29:30
traditional hangover cure in mongolia
29:32
is the mongolian mary which consists of
29:35
tomato juice with a pickled sheep's
29:37
eyeball
29:38
floating inside it
29:43
is it is either bit meant to be more
29:45
helpful or does it they have to be
29:47
combined
29:48
so i think the traditional
29:51
helpful bit is a pickled eyeball because
29:53
that goes back supposedly to genghis
29:55
khan times
29:56
uh the tomato juice obviously doesn't
29:58
because they didn't have tomatoes in
29:59
those days
30:01
but actually tomato juice i think would
30:02
probably help your hangover so
30:04
that probably today is the active
30:05
ingredient although the traditional
30:06
thing is the eyeball
30:08
but if a load of you have a hangover
30:09
obviously it's very labor intensive in
30:12
sheep
30:12
yes then you have to kill a lot of sheep
30:14
you don't have to kill them you can just
30:15
put an onion in the place of the eyeball
30:19
and i learned this from malmo's
30:22
disgusting food museum which i went to
30:24
a couple of weeks ago and tried lots of
30:26
disgusting things did you have the
30:27
hangover
30:28
uh i did have a hangover but i didn't i
30:31
didn't have any of this
30:32
um actually i did have a hangover on
30:35
that day
30:36
which was very bad because i had to eat
30:38
things like bulls testicles
30:39
and shark meat marinated in urine
30:42
and rotten fish and all that kind of
30:44
stuff and three penis wine which that
30:46
did help the hangover a little bit
30:48
doesn't it yeah because it's got alcohol
30:50
in it and it's like hair of the dog it's
30:51
like penis of the dog
30:52
off the seal and of the deer
30:56
here's the thing though you went to this
30:57
museum and traditionally museums you
31:00
don't touch the exhibits but you went
31:01
around eating them
31:02
and so is this is this more a restaurant
31:05
than a
31:05
museum um no so these days a lot of
31:08
museums they are
31:10
hands-on aren't they as in you can tr
31:12
you can kind of do little bits and
31:13
pieces with the exhibits
31:14
and in this place they have a particular
31:16
tasting table at the end where you can
31:18
taste all the things or not all the
31:20
things but just a few of the things that
31:21
are on display
31:22
and lucky me they put a lot of extra
31:25
stuff on farming
31:28
which not everyone gets to have so
31:30
everyone gets to have the bull testicles
31:31
not everyone gets to have the um
31:33
rotten egg with a fetus in it you know
31:36
that i managed to have
31:37
um but yeah it's a really good museum
31:39
it's in malmo they've just announced
31:40
that there's a new one about to be
31:42
opened in
31:42
l.a and they're hoping to go around the
31:45
whole world hopefully one day soon so
31:47
wherever you are in the world you might
31:48
be able to try some of this delicious
31:50
stuff
31:50
it's quite exciting because the museum
31:52
was founded by samuel west who
31:55
also founded the museum of failure which
31:58
how often do people
31:59
found more than one museum so it had
32:01
things like failed donald trump
32:03
games and so on but was such a success
32:06
that he's had to keep it going and this
32:07
is his
32:08
his second museum that's very exciting
32:10
the only person i can think of is the
32:12
person who founded both the natural
32:14
history museum
32:15
and um the british museum yes i think
32:18
you're right
32:19
uh sloane yes a han sloane so he's in
32:21
quite
32:22
high um you know there's just that guy
32:24
and the guy who did the disgusting food
32:26
museum yeah
32:27
it's pretty good it's very funny because
32:28
he talks about i've read an interview
32:29
with him about setting up this
32:31
disgusting food museum and
32:32
he has to sample a lot of the stuff that
32:34
they get in and
32:35
he's just in his story just constantly
32:37
vomiting he's just like
32:39
i just he doesn't like it you know it's
32:40
not as if it's like a weird fetish he
32:42
really doesn't
32:43
like this stuff it's just not very the
32:44
only thing that was quite nice was the
32:46
bull testicles that was all right
32:48
i had durian fruit which smells
32:50
disgusting but this actually tastes kind
32:51
of okay
32:52
but everything else is just objectively
32:54
quite disgusting well so he makes a
32:56
point that a large
32:57
part of taste is to do with your
32:59
psychological
33:01
take on it so if you think something's
33:02
going to be disgusting your mind sets
33:04
itself ready to vomiting so he uses
33:06
the um example of vegemite which is the
33:09
first time he had vegemite
33:11
he hated it and thought it was horrible
33:12
then he went to australia and at a party
33:14
it was served on two bits of toast two
33:16
slices to him and he saw children eating
33:18
and he thought oh this must be how you
33:20
neutralize the taste and he started
33:22
eating it now he loves vegemite and
33:24
vegemite is in this museum and um the
33:26
guy who showed me around who's this
33:27
guy's co-owner andreas
33:29
uh he said that um it caused almost like
33:33
a diplomatic spat with australia
33:35
because as soon as the australians found
33:37
out that vegemite was in this disgusting
33:39
food museum they were absolutely
33:40
you know really upset world war iii i
33:42
really like the idea of sweden and
33:44
australia going to war with each other
33:45
because it's mostly a commuter's war
33:47
isn't it
33:49
so you've you've shown us videos of you
33:52
um at this museum james and
33:54
it you look like you're having a really
33:55
really bad time and
33:57
sort of can i just say i had a really
33:59
really great time yes but the thing is
34:01
i just you know i'm not gonna say no to
34:03
anything i'll just do whatever you know
34:05
and also he was very much peer
34:07
pressuring me into trying absolutely
34:09
everything
34:09
he was like well if i try it then you
34:11
have to try it um
34:13
and of course he works here and has this
34:15
stuff all the time it's not really fair
34:16
but yeah
34:17
um i opened some sur strumming which is
34:19
like a fermented rotten fish
34:21
which we once had on qi but we weren't
34:24
allowed to open in the studio
34:26
and um actually according to their um at
34:28
lease this museum they're explicitly not
34:30
allowed to open any of the cans
34:32
inside the museum so we had to go
34:33
outside we had a crowd of people
34:35
watching me open this
34:38
yeah and then you did have to recoil
34:40
from it didn't you is that the one where
34:41
you yeah
34:42
it's unbelievably disgusting here it
34:44
just smells of
34:45
everything rotten that you can think of
34:47
like you know
34:48
bin juice and rotten fish and you know
34:52
vomit and everything you can think of it
34:54
just smells and tastes a bit like that
34:56
great and um all the tickets to the
34:58
museum are printed on a sick bag
35:01
and in the first three weeks of opening
35:03
they had eleven cases of visitors
35:05
vomiting after trying the exhibits
35:07
only eleven which is an achievement
35:09
isn't it they must be looking for vomits
35:11
they are and they said if it's just like
35:12
a wretch it doesn't count or if it's
35:14
spitting now it doesn't count it has to
35:15
be an actual vomit from the stomach
35:17
for them to count it and then to get the
35:19
towel yeah so they have one of those
35:20
boards
35:21
like blood days since last year
35:23
[Laughter]
35:25
penis is quite common though as a
35:27
hangover cure isn't it when is it
35:28
you sort of read about the traditional
35:30
hangover cures
35:32
[Laughter]
35:35
it's often dried dried and shrivelled i
35:37
think a sicilian traditional hangover
35:39
cure is bull's penis actually so you
35:41
also have to be able
35:43
dried bull's penis um but in bolivia
35:45
it's also a famous thing full penis suit
35:47
ball pizzle soup is a thing that people
35:48
say they have with hangovers quite a lot
35:50
they actually had a bull penis at this
35:52
museum um but i couldn't taste it but
35:54
they it was like a hands-on exhibit so
35:56
you're allowed to touch the bull's penis
35:58
were you impressed did you congratulate
36:00
the bull
36:01
but that ball sadly never made it
36:04
well i've been looking for the hang of
36:06
it disgusting hangover cures yeah
36:08
so um pliny the elder oh yeah our old
36:12
buddy
36:12
um he recommends various things so he
36:15
mostly recommends
36:16
things to stop you from getting drunk in
36:17
the first place for example
36:20
uh roasted wild boar lungs will do
36:23
or if you don't have a wild boar if you
36:26
have the ashes of a swallow's beak and
36:28
mix it with myrrh
36:30
and put that in your wine that stops you
36:32
getting drunk in the first place
36:34
okay very good but does ruin the wine
36:36
doesn't it a little bit yeah
36:38
the gladiators used to eat ash for um
36:41
energy on itv
36:44
um no it was like they would used to
36:46
take it out of the hearth and then they
36:48
would mix it with
36:49
presumably white i guess yeah and then
36:51
that would supposedly help them after a
36:53
hard day's glitterate gladiatoring
36:55
that's all get home after a hard day's
36:57
gladiatoring darling what have you
36:59
cooked me for supper i'm exhausted
37:00
here's some ash with some wine anna oh
37:03
no that's absolutely fine
37:06
so john of gadsden in uh the 14th
37:09
century
37:10
had advice for if you drunk too much he
37:12
said that if you're a man then you
37:14
should wash your testicles with salt and
37:16
vinegar
37:17
and if you're a woman you should wash
37:18
your breasts with salt and vinegar
37:20
and was he a salt and vinegar salesman
37:22
[Laughter]
37:23
he worked in the local chippy he'd over
37:25
ordered
37:27
and he said you can also eat the leaf or
37:29
stalk of a cabbage with some sugar which
37:31
does sound like the better option he
37:32
should have put it first so these days i
37:34
guess you could just put your testicles
37:35
in a bag of salt and vinegar crisps and
37:37
that'll have the same effect
37:38
absolutely but don't do it in tesco's
37:40
[Laughter]
37:42
um duck embryo is another thing that's
37:44
eaten so
37:45
this is baloo yep so i had that bullet
37:48
did you
37:48
balance
37:52
um to be honest i alm i kind of
37:55
chickened out a little bit
37:57
docked out you mean duct tape i did the
37:59
car yeah
38:00
um and when they weren't looking i only
38:02
took a bit of the egg part
38:04
of the balut and didn't have any of the
38:05
embryo part because i thought that was a
38:07
bit beyond the pale
38:08
you cheated you found your line though
38:11
well to be honest if anyone was watching
38:14
i probably would have done it
38:15
because i am extremely bad with peer
38:17
pressure
38:19
um but yeah i i did taste it it just
38:21
tasted like i've had a
38:23
100 year egg before uh and it tastes a
38:25
bit like that so it's slightly rotten
38:26
though
38:27
it tastes like yeah slightly rotten you
38:28
would have thought after 100 years
38:30
that rock had really penetrated yeah it
38:32
tastes like uh sulfurous eggs like
38:34
you know yeah sulphur thoughts eggs yeah
38:37
eggy eggs
38:38
what were you said was there anything
38:39
else about baluto no that that was a
38:42
hang of a cure that apparently works so
38:45
it's
38:45
it's stuck embryo isn't it yeah it's
38:46
bored alive and then you eat it in the
38:48
shell
38:48
you eat it in the middle of shelly
38:50
presumably at embryo stage and you
38:52
would the bee can you tell the beaks
38:54
there you can tell it's there but it's
38:56
not crunchy i don't think and there was
38:57
a
38:58
um filipino lady who works at this place
39:01
and
39:01
she absolutely loves it she's like my
39:02
whole family says this is not weird i
39:04
don't understand why people think this
39:05
is weird the philippines are declaring
39:07
war on sweden
39:10
well they do have for instance haggis do
39:12
they yeah
39:13
they have weirdly they have like haribos
39:16
not haribos but like other gelatin
39:17
sweets because they're like well
39:18
you know this is made from gelatin from
39:20
bones of animals this is kind of if you
39:22
think about it it's kind of weird yeah
39:23
it's all just it is just perspective
39:24
isn't it i mean the things that we find
39:26
weird other people eat
39:27
we eat equally weird stuff i would say
39:29
so apart from you know like
39:30
urine soaked shark is objectively
39:33
strange yeah i think
39:35
what's the urine adding to that taste
39:37
well it adds a uriny taste
39:39
okay i must say you could if you were to
39:41
have that and any other food in the
39:42
whole history of
39:43
time you would know which one had been
39:45
soaked in europe yes okay
39:47
so their rules are um just to quickly go
39:49
they have three rules it has to be
39:50
considered disgusting by some people
39:52
around the world
39:53
um so not necessarily people eating it
39:55
it has to be genuinely eaten by people
39:57
as a choice not through necessity
39:59
um so it's not things that you can only
40:01
have because you have no other food
40:03
and it must be not a food stuff invented
40:05
just for tourists
40:06
right that's okay because that does
40:08
happen sometimes of course um on the
40:09
fact that it's kind of all about
40:10
perspective this sort of thing there was
40:12
an
40:13
ft journalist who went to china in 2011
40:16
and went to
40:16
xiaojing and was investigating what
40:19
chinese people thought of cheese brought
40:20
over from europe because obviously not
40:22
very much cheese is eaten in the east
40:24
very many of them lactose intolerant a
40:26
lot drink milk now a bit but cheese not
40:28
really a thing
40:29
so brought over a whole bunch of cheeses
40:31
and they find that
40:32
disgusting all these people who worked
40:34
in a restaurant found it kind of grossed
40:35
the idea
40:36
and then ate the cheeses and it was a
40:39
lot of blue cheese it's very strong blue
40:41
which interestingly they thought was
40:43
fine so they thought that's okay
40:44
and they said it was quite similar to a
40:46
sort of rotting bean curd dish that they
40:49
said i've had that as well rotten bean
40:50
curd and it just
40:51
does taste quite cheesy does it yeah
40:53
they said it was a similar taste so
40:54
weirdly
40:55
the only one that they all said that's
40:57
absolutely disgusting is an animal
40:58
stench that haunts your nose
41:00
babybel
41:01
[Laughter]
41:03
is it primula
41:07
what a callback yeah the multi-podcast
41:10
coolback that's
41:11
the best it's not it's pretty which is
41:13
very interesting to us
41:14
it obviously is quite mild breeze yeah
41:16
then it's just something they're not
41:18
used to
41:18
they're kind of disgusting i remember
41:20
reading somewhere and i don't know where
41:22
it was so
41:22
i think this is true but the idea was
41:24
when europeans first went to japan
41:26
especially
41:26
that was the one overarching thing about
41:29
it was that we smelled of milk and
41:31
cheese and stuff like that is that right
41:32
yeah yeah
41:32
they say that in china like all the time
41:34
they'll be like oh milky boys here
41:36
it's it's a smell that eminent emanates
41:38
off a white person
41:39
in china the milky bar kid is not a good
41:41
thing no it's fine
41:42
it's just you can smell it it's just
41:44
it's a smell they all identify
41:46
do you guys know there's an iron brew
41:47
sausage
41:49
[Laughter]
41:51
choked on it i almost i just choked on
41:54
my drink because i'm so excited
41:56
and i am bruce sausage so basically this
41:58
was invented a few years ago by a guy
41:59
who said what a great hangover cure this
42:01
would be by a genius
42:03
hang on we have had a debate no no andy
42:05
whether combining two existing things
42:07
counts as inventing a new one
42:08
i will accept a lot of things in this
42:10
podcast but for you to say that
42:12
i am brew sausage it's not an invention
42:14
that we're all calling out for
42:16
okay sure right it's pretty simple
42:18
actually but still invention you replace
42:20
all the water in the sausage making
42:22
process with iron brew
42:24
and he says it's a brilliant hangover
42:25
cure um one guy said he felt like he'd
42:28
gone to heaven
42:29
after tasting it according to the
42:30
inventor of the i'm bru sausage and i
42:32
really want to try one
42:33
i do as well if you're a people who make
42:35
iron brew sausages
42:37
do get in touch we'll advertise free
42:39
hang on
42:40
is it all the water involved in the
42:41
process as in has it grown the
42:43
crops that feed the cow and the cow been
42:45
drinking iron brew from the trough
42:49
it has to have rained iron brew has the
42:51
farmer had his all the water in his body
42:53
replaced with iron
42:55
yeah he's scottish
43:01

[Music]
01:05
[Applause]
01:08
[Music]
01:10
hello and welcome to no such thing as a
01:12
fish a weekly podcast coming to you from
01:14
the qi offices in covered garden
01:16
uh my name is anna tajinski not dan
01:19
schreiber and i am sitting here with
01:21
james harkin
01:22
andrew hunter murray and anne miller
01:24
once again we've gathered around the
01:25
microphones with our four favorite facts
01:26
from the last seven days
01:28
and in no particular order here we go
01:31
starting with my facts which is
01:34
cockroaches can carry 900 times their
01:37
own body weight on their backs
01:39
amazing it's impressive isn't it so what
01:42
is 900 times bigger than a cockroach
01:44
900 cockroaches oh that sucks oh yeah
01:47
cockroach fire fighters must be very
01:50
good indeed
01:51
i'll take everyone i just got everything
01:52
from your house don't worry about it
01:55
well i want the whole house oh no it's
01:56
still on fire
01:59
i worked out that that would mean that i
02:01
would be able to carry the biggest
02:02
dinosaur that ever walked the earth
02:04
which is argentinosaurus so if i was a
02:07
cockroach
02:08
that would look really impressive if you
02:09
were a cockroach as in as a human you
02:11
would be able to if i was a human-sized
02:12
cockroach and the laws of physics didn't
02:14
really apply to me but just this one
02:16
particular fact applied to me
02:18
then i'd be able to carry that oh and if
02:20
dinosaurs still existed
02:22
there are a lot of big if's in there but
02:24
it's still impressive so yeah this is
02:26
i read this in an article which was
02:28
published by the science the journal
02:29
science
02:30
the article is actually written by
02:31
someone called elizabeth penici this is
02:33
a report on cockroaches and how they're
02:34
basically impossible to squash
02:36
and it looked into why so they're
02:38
extremely flexible
02:40
and extremely hard and really good at
02:41
lifting stuff and so they they work that
02:43
out obviously
02:44
by how you'd think they did by putting
02:46
heavier and heavier stuff on cockroaches
02:48
backs and seeing at what point
02:50
they crushed but we we haven't said
02:53
there are four thousand
02:54
five hundred species of cockroach so is
02:57
this only one species
03:01
this was an american cockroach yeah
03:03
famously
03:04
the gym yeah yeah exactly jock
03:08
roach i already think about how we
03:11
had this image of cockroaches as sort of
03:12
you know being very hardy and surviving
03:14
everything but it really varies
03:16
there are 64 rays can kill 93
03:20
of german cockroaches which is 10 times
03:21
more than humans can take but like way
03:23
way way less
03:24
than a fruit fly can take so a fruit fly
03:26
can survive more radiation
03:28
oh radiation yeah really yeah so because
03:30
it might play some which is really
03:32
hearty and some aren't but we sort of
03:33
think of cockroaches as this one
03:34
uniform thing and actually they're very
03:36
different individuals
03:38
yeah i think that's good that's good
03:39
speaking up for cockroaches yeah they're
03:40
not just horrible things
03:42
they're each very special in their own
03:44
way do you know what happens to elderly
03:46
cockroaches
03:48
i read about this experiment and it's
03:49
amazing it's great well they get dottery
03:51
um so the scientists looked at elderly
03:54
cockroaches and they
03:55
they found that their joints seize up
03:57
and they have trouble walking up hills
03:59
oh yeah and they spend less time moving
04:00
around they move more slowly when they
04:02
do move around
04:03
they develop slightly racist views by
04:06
the other kinds of cockroaches
04:08
but so basically they they did this
04:10
experiment they you know tried to make
04:12
them walk up slopes and things they only
04:13
found
04:14
one method which could rejuvenate
04:17
an elderly cockroach and make it
04:20
you know um this was testing whether a
04:22
particular species could run off after
04:24
being nudged
04:25
right and the best way to ensure that
04:27
elderly cockroaches can run off after
04:28
being nudged is to decapitate them
04:31
oh but it's a bit of an extreme yeah i'd
04:34
rather be daughtery
04:35
yeah um so in this experiment that i got
04:38
this fact from
04:39
they were mainly actually looking at how
04:41
cockroaches could squeeze through such
04:43
tiny spaces
04:44
so the american cockroach for instance
04:45
which is about nine millimeters tall
04:47
can squeeze through a slit that's three
04:49
millimeters high and so they looked at
04:51
exactly how they do that and it's really
04:52
cool
04:53
they'll come across a little hole and
04:55
first of all they inspect it with their
04:56
antenna
04:57
so you know to feel around feel how
04:59
small it is then they jam their head
05:01
through and then they squeeze their
05:02
front legs through after it so they're
05:04
really pushing their body down
05:05
squeezing their front legs through and
05:07
then they sort of drag the rest of the
05:08
body behind them and their back legs are
05:10
really splayed out so when you look at
05:11
it they're completely flat their back
05:13
legs are splayed out
05:14
but sort of still pushing them and it
05:16
takes them one second to do that
05:17
wow and they're much better than any
05:19
animal like squeezing except
05:20
an octopus i think which can squeeze
05:22
itself quite small as well
05:24
that's terrifying so what they're also
05:25
really good at is biting so they can
05:27
fight with five times more relative
05:28
strength than humans can
05:30
which is terrifying and cockroaches will
05:32
eat everything including other
05:34
cockroaches and humans
05:35
and the thing about they like crotches
05:37
don't eat they do
05:38
no they don't not all of you because
05:40
they're only small but if they were big
05:41
enough
05:42
so sailors on ships apparently where
05:44
some sailors wear gloves because
05:45
cockroaches will sleep up sneak up in
05:47
the night and eat their fingernails
05:49
really yeah that's quite good don't need
05:51
to take nails there's no day one
05:53
it's your eyes so here's something i
05:56
have in common with cockroaches
05:58
um they don't like mornings
06:01
uh inasmuch as they're literally unable
06:04
to form any new memories at the start of
06:06
the day
06:08
so if you teach them something at the
06:09
start of the day they'll just forget it
06:11
and if you teach them in the afternoon
06:13
then they'll remember it is there a
06:15
reason do they think behind that or they
06:18
just go out really late
06:19
yeah just we just like to stay up late
06:22
you and your cockroach friends
06:24
i'm glad you could speak on behalf of
06:25
the cockroaches now james but they don't
06:28
they don't like the light do they so i
06:29
wonder if it's something to do with that
06:31
yeah because they're named blattadaya in
06:33
latin means insect that shuns the light
06:37
and also the creepy ones might eat your
06:38
fingernails but i'm sure when i started
06:40
at q i was a brilliant fact that was if
06:42
it's a wheeler like the idea of
06:43
cockroaches but they don't like the idea
06:44
of us so some of them if they touch a
06:46
human will run away and clean themselves
06:50
that's weird because they love touching
06:51
don't they i think we've said this
06:52
before but they
06:53
um that's why they like being in really
06:55
tiny spaces and they're like crawling
06:56
into
06:57
is and that because they really like
07:00
touching the edges of things
07:01
and this comes in handy for a guy called
07:03
stephen kutcher
07:04
who is hollywood's bug artist so he's
07:07
got this super cool job if anyone is
07:09
here
07:09
he's got a super cool joke but his
07:11
brother aston is doing a lot better
07:14
in hollywood well it depends what you
07:15
mean by better but can you imagine those
07:17
christmas dinners at the kutcher
07:19
household
07:19
what have you been doing well stephen
07:21
gets to say i'm at the very top of my
07:23
field
07:26
we don't need to get into the ashton
07:27
kutcher debate here but anyway so steven
07:30
sort of recruits bugs for films like
07:32
spider-man
07:35
are you around are you free are you
07:36
getting his fingernails out
07:38
they come to him yeah it's like that and
07:41
then he trains them up
07:42
and so he did this interview for npr
07:44
where he was talking about a film called
07:46
race the sun
07:47
and what he had to do was he had to get
07:48
a cockroach to emerge from a shoe
07:51
walk onto a bag of cheetos turn left
07:54
and then walk through some cheetos that
07:55
had spilled out of it and then stop on a
07:57
magazine
07:58
so we had to get a cockroach to do all
07:59
of this without any prompting
08:01
and he did it by folding the bag of
08:03
cheetos in a certain way and because
08:05
they really like touching things
08:06
he just folded it in a way that they'd
08:08
follow the folds around and it steered
08:10
it exactly that's so clever
08:12
i would just glue a magnet to the
08:14
underside of the cockroach and then move
08:15
that around
08:16
under the filming surface i would do it
08:18
in post
08:20
hollywood secrets from the nose thing is
08:22
a fish team yeah
08:24
that's really cool you don't get that in
08:25
heat magazine
08:27
um in russia in 2008
08:32
they wanted to find some cockroaches in
08:34
moscow to send into space
08:35
they needed 54. they should have
08:38
recruited my friend stephen kutcher
08:40
[Laughter]
08:42
well it took them three months to find
08:44
54 cockroaches
08:46
in russia and then everyone was like oh
08:48
my god what's happened to all our
08:49
cockroaches
08:49
in russia and there was a big worry
08:51
about it people blamed like cell tower
08:54
radiation
08:55
or gm food or probably foreigners so you
08:59
know like people
09:00
blame whatever they blame um and it we
09:02
don't really know what happened
09:04
uh but then around 2011 they started
09:07
coming back
09:08
and then in the early 2010s there was a
09:10
huge plague of cockroaches in
09:12
moscow so they kind of just disappeared
09:14
and then they all came back
09:16
and what it might have been is maybe
09:18
they started using some pesticide the
09:20
government did
09:21
and then it killed them all but then
09:22
they got used to it and then when they
09:23
got used to it they really came back
09:25
with a vengeance
09:26
god wow well it's a big holiday big top
09:30
coach holiday
09:32
that's because whenever i go on holiday
09:34
there's always cockroaches in the room
09:36
james you have to start improving your
09:38
accommodation
09:39
whenever oh i did find one thing i liked
09:43
which is
09:44
that as female cockroaches get older
09:46
they gradually lower their standards of
09:48
what they think is acceptable in a mate
09:52
yeah i think we can all feel for that
09:53
but the mail we can all hope for that
09:56
males are completely unable to assess
09:58
females age or
10:00
assess their reproductive fitness
10:01
they're just willing to mate at all
10:02
times
10:03
but females um start out with quite high
10:05
standards and then
10:06
as time goes by they broaden their
10:08
standards
10:11
they're all cockroaches you're dating
10:12
those so they don't move on to more
10:14
attractive animals
10:18
would be amazing wouldn't it if all
10:20
animals were dating all other animals
10:24
um well they are very sexual aren't they
10:27
the only thing
10:28
they like more than food i think is sex
10:30
cockroaches and they will actually i
10:31
think it's the males are very sexual the
10:33
females actually aren't as intersex
10:35
and so if a male is starving to death
10:37
and it's got a bit of food in front of
10:39
him but then you spray some female
10:40
pheromone 16 feet away it will run to
10:42
the female pheromone and
10:44
die of starvation because it wants sex
10:46
more than food
10:47
yeah wow um do you guys know that
10:50
cockroach milk
10:51
is the most nutritious substance on
10:53
earth or one of the most nutritious
10:54
substances maybe he's running to the
10:56
woman
10:57
cockroach to get some milk rather than
10:59
for sex you're right he must have read
11:00
the same article that i did
11:04
yeah so i didn't know this they've
11:05
milked the pacific beetle cockroach and
11:08
they found that it has four times more
11:09
calories than cow's milk
11:11
and yeah it's full of protein and fats
11:13
and sugars
11:14
and it's this cockroach is the only
11:15
cockroach that gives birth to live young
11:17
and then it sort of pumps out this
11:19
special milk for its babies and it's
11:20
really cool it looks really glittery
11:21
because it's got protein crystals in it
11:23
wow great well look for a tiny tiny
11:25
bottle yeah
11:28
it's not milk per se is it it's
11:30
something slightly different to milk i
11:32
think
11:32
yeah i don't know why secretions yeah
11:36
lovely what i mean is when you're in the
11:38
supermarket you won't be able to call it
11:40
cockroach milk like you can't these days
11:41
they're stopping people from calling
11:42
things almond milk can't they
11:44
ah if it doesn't contain lactose or
11:46
something you're saying the dairy
11:48
industry might get annoyed if i start
11:49
selling my coffee i think they will i
11:50
think you might have to call it
11:51
cockroach secretion like anne suggests
11:53
and i don't want to buy that but i'm
11:55
only one person so no i do think we need
11:57
to work on the branding
12:00
[Music]
12:01
[Applause]
12:04
okay let's move on to our next facts and
12:07
that
12:07
is anne's facts my fact is that the
12:10
first british travelers aboard the
12:11
orient express were advised to bring a
12:13
revolver and a teapot with them
12:16
all the essentials so when the orient
12:20
express began
12:21
it wasn't quite the luxurious train ride
12:23
we imagine so
12:24
actually it went from paris to
12:26
constantinople but twice the passengers
12:28
had to get off and get on boats
12:29
instead so i think they do as they had
12:31
wanted to bring protection in case there
12:33
was a ruckus
12:33
at the ports and the teapots making tea
12:37
[Laughter]
12:42
if you've recovered from a ruckus what
12:44
do you need you need a nice cup of tea
12:45
that's true
12:47
um so the orange express was founded
12:50
by the company uh wagon lee uh
12:53
wagons litz in english uh and they were
12:56
that was founded by
12:58
george knuckle mackers who that's how
13:01
you pronounce that in every language
13:03
uh and he is quite interesting because
13:06
he decided to do these sleeper carriages
13:08
when he went to the united states of
13:10
america and he went to the usa because
13:12
he was encouraged to go there because
13:14
while in europe he fell in love with his
13:16
cousin
13:17
and his family decided that he should go
13:20
to the usa
13:21
to kind of get over her so it's strange
13:23
because falling in love with your cousin
13:24
was an occupational hazard in the 19th
13:26
century
13:27
it must have been an unsuitable cousin i
13:29
think it was a cousin did not like him
13:31
back
13:32
oh but knucklebacker so he set out that
13:35
first trip to um constantinople and
13:36
actually there wasn't a full
13:38
rail link to go for six years after his
13:40
first orange express ram
13:41
but also the orange express we had this
13:43
idea of it being this beautiful long
13:45
train and that's sort of i think the
13:46
idea because i read this fact in
13:48
night trains by andrew martin and he
13:49
says because it went on a long journey
13:51
we sort of assume it was long but
13:52
actually that first train there were
13:53
only five carriages
13:54
and one of them was a wagon carrying
13:56
post which helped them recoup some of
13:57
their costs
13:58
which it's just yeah it's quite like
14:00
express
14:01
you think of it as being you know 15
14:03
carriages long yeah it's got all this
14:05
stuff
14:05
yeah it's only five characters that's
14:06
tiny yeah so my fewer suspects
14:10
but also agatha christie um used to take
14:12
their words best of luck cause she her
14:13
husband's second husband was an
14:14
archaeologist they take it to go to
14:15
diggs
14:16
um but she was apparently one time
14:17
between venice and paris was attacked by
14:19
bed bugs
14:20
i shouldn't write that into the book oh
14:22
yeah that's not what you want from your
14:23
luxury trainer
14:24
you imagine like you know like really
14:26
grand and lovely yeah
14:27
wasn't knuckle mackers was it pullman
14:29
characters that he was inspired by yeah
14:30
he went to america and he fell
14:32
in love with them
14:35
[Laughter]
14:38
but pullman carriages were a huge deal
14:40
so they were these yeah this luxury way
14:42
of travelling that was pioneered in
14:44
america
14:45
and they also gave rise to pullman
14:47
porters and i didn't really say paul and
14:49
porter's were the people who carried
14:50
your luggage on a pullman carriage
14:52
and george pullman came up with the idea
14:54
straight after the civil war of
14:55
only employing ex-slaves as these
14:57
portman porters so every single pullman
14:59
porter was
15:00
black and they ended up being really
15:01
important in the civil rights movement
15:03
because
15:04
they formed the first union of black
15:06
people the first union that involved
15:07
black people
15:08
and that allowed them to get together
15:09
and to fight for their rights and things
15:10
like that
15:11
but they all when they were working on
15:13
the pullman carriages had to be called
15:15
george
15:16
so every pullman porter was called
15:18
george after george pullman
15:20
which some of them objected to because
15:21
most of them weren't actually called
15:22
george
15:23
yeah you'd think the majority it didn't
15:25
turn out to be
15:26
most of them had other names and there
15:28
was a society there was a society called
15:30
the society for the prevention of
15:32
calling sleeper carporters george
15:34
and this was actually a genuinely really
15:35
important society but it wasn't
15:38
the point i mean cruelty to animals and
15:40
cruelty to children are surely higher up
15:42
the list of
15:43
prevention ofs no okay prevention of
15:46
calling people george
15:47
this society was actually formed by
15:50
other people who were called george
15:52
in america so it had 31 000 members and
15:55
they were saying
15:55
george is our name stop just randomly
15:58
giving this name to train porters that's
15:59
i mean i don't think they should have
16:01
been calling these porters george but
16:02
you can't stop other people from having
16:04
your name
16:05
well these georges you know they want
16:07
they didn't want it
16:08
you can't think that your name's a bit
16:10
too common you don't make it more and
16:11
more common
16:12
yeah there is a phrase infection or
16:14
things like
16:15
saying leave it to george which i
16:17
thought was a sort of 40s phrase or
16:18
calling everyone george
16:19
was a thing that i think it comes from
16:21
that yes yeah
16:22
but then you couldn't because eventually
16:24
this society for the prevention of
16:25
calling people george actually persuaded
16:27
the pullman company to
16:28
ban it so by 1926 there had to be a
16:31
little rack installed in each carriage
16:32
that said the name of your porter to
16:34
ensure that you didn't call him george
16:36
because the georgia's objected so if
16:37
they were accidentally called george
16:39
not accidentally if they that was their
16:41
actual name they were forced to not be
16:42
called
16:43
you're all called herbert and the
16:46
interesting thing about pullman
16:48
he was seen as this great entrepreneur
16:50
etc
16:51
uh but there was a depression in 1893
16:55
and it meant that he cut the wages of
16:57
all of his staff
16:58
but they were all staying in the town
17:00
that he built and he didn't reduce the
17:01
rent
17:02
so it meant that workman might make nine
17:04
dollars and seven cents in a fortnight
17:06
but he would take nine dollars of it as
17:08
rent leaving them a paycheck of just
17:10
seven
17:10
cents for everything else it's not worth
17:12
cashing is it
17:13
it really isn't it's really bad so they
17:16
strike because of this um
17:18
and then the soldiers came in and i
17:20
think quite a few people died
17:22
uh and then pullman's reputation just
17:24
went from hero to absolutely nothing
17:26
which is not the same yeah you're right
17:29
it's the phrase yeah
17:30
but yeah he became um he became really
17:33
really hated to such an extent that when
17:35
he was buried his family covered his
17:36
coffin
17:37
in a large block of cement because they
17:40
were worried people would abuse his cops
17:42
because he was hated
17:43
so much it must have been very difficult
17:44
for the poor pool bearers
17:46
yes you're right um did you know that
17:49
in 1936 you could travel from england to
17:52
france by train
17:54
completely by train still come you still
17:57
you can't do that but it's surprising oh
17:59
they're surprised that you could do it
18:02
there's no tunnel um no there was no
18:04
tunnel but there were ferries so there
18:05
was this thing called the night ferry
18:07
which took trains on board it so it was
18:09
only if you were traveling first class
18:10
there was especially
18:11
there are special trains and they went i
18:14
think from paddington actually
18:15
and if you were in first class your
18:17
train just ran straight onto the ferry
18:18
you stayed aboard it and then it ran
18:20
straight off the ferry at the other end
18:21
but if you're in economy class you have
18:23
to get off the carriage so
18:24
were there tracks leading up onto the
18:27
ferry and then at the other end there
18:28
were tracks leading off
18:29
so that they'd have to have the same
18:31
gate yeah because they have different
18:32
gauges in europe don't they
18:33
or do the is it the it's like a
18:35
universal plug you know when you go on
18:36
holiday and you can
18:37
an adapter the carriage might go on to
18:41
another gauged
18:42
yeah because the carriage sometimes
18:44
lifts up you've got a flatbed truck
18:46
yeah with a different gauge and then the
18:47
whole carriage is lifted up
18:49
yeah yeah a weird journey wouldn't it
18:51
your carriage being lifted up and swung
18:53
waking up at the wrong point i mean like
18:54
where are we yeah that's so cool
18:57
um so i've got a fact about modern
18:59
trains
19:00
which is uh about the queen who as we
19:03
know has the royal train
19:05
um so when she's traveling on the royal
19:07
train and when she's been traveling
19:08
overnight there's a special instruction
19:10
that gets given out
19:12
and that is that the queen has a bath at
19:14
7 30 in the morning so if the train is
19:16
going then
19:16
the driver is ordered to the driver is
19:19
ordered to avoid any bumpy bits of track
19:21
so that her bath doesn't slosh around
19:23
too much okay
19:25
that's weird knowing when the queen has
19:26
a bath i think you'd be freaked out as
19:28
the train driver
19:29
every every morning at 7 30 you'd think
19:31
oh she's bathing now
19:33
don't make any mistakes she's naked 10
19:36
yards from me
19:38
it's a weird thought it's a big train i
19:40
don't think it's only 10 meters
19:42
like in the cab in the tub he puts the
19:45
bathroom next to the driver's seat
19:48
watching the vehicle just one thing i
19:51
had on
19:51
suitcases so this is about luggage and
19:53
suitcases and i was wondering what the
19:54
history of luggage is
19:56
and i read that the first wheelie
19:58
suitcases
19:59
were in 1153 and come on
20:03
they were used by the nightstands
20:15
you don't see that do you don't see them
20:17
running into battle with it
20:18
with
20:22
but no i read this it was in a lonely
20:23
planet guide and another book actually
20:25
and i can't find
20:26
any source for it but apparently yeah
20:28
and they would use these wheelie
20:29
suitcases
20:30
to carry their chain mail and their arms
20:32
and their tools and stuff
20:33
and i guess a wheelie suitcase is really
20:35
just a
20:36
just a bag on wheels there's a cart on
20:38
wheels
20:39
it would it would have to be wooden
20:41
though wouldn't it like a wooden
20:42
carriage with spokes
20:43
yeah yeah i don't know when something
20:45
stops being a suitcase and starts
20:47
bringing a carriage
20:48
size is it just choice mostly size
20:52
the very small carriage for the knights
20:53
templar anyway if anyone has an actual
20:56
source for
20:56
the crusades being people galloping into
20:58
the crusades pulling their wheelie
21:00
suitcases
21:00
it doesn't it just doesn't sound very
21:02
true and it sure doesn't
21:03
[Music]
21:08
okay on to our next fact and that is
21:10
james's facts
21:11
okay my fact this week is that the
21:13
largest known prime number
21:15
has 24 862 048 digits
21:20
when written in binary it has 82 million
21:24
589 933 digits
21:27
but they are all the number one
21:30
that is unbelievable and presumably not
21:33
a coincidence
21:35
it's not a coincidence okay so i'll
21:37
quickly go through this
21:39
take your time please so prime number
21:42
uh is something that has only two months
21:44
multiples one in itself so 12 is not
21:46
prime because you can have three fours
21:48
or two sixes
21:49
uh but eleven is because you can't
21:50
divide it by anything else apart from
21:52
itself
21:52
that's lulled everyone into a false
21:54
sense of security thinking yeah i know
21:56
that okay and now binary binary is a
21:58
number that's made of zeros and ones
22:00
um rather than writing in ones tens and
22:02
hundreds you write in ones twos fours
22:04
eight sixteens thirty-twos stuff like
22:06
that
22:07
and so each zero or one represents two
22:09
or four and eight sixteen et etcetera
22:11
so the binary number 1 1 1 1 is 1 plus 2
22:14
plus 4 plus 8 which is 15.
22:17
anyway so the large prime numbers that
22:20
we're all finding at the moment are
22:21
called mercen primes
22:23
and they're all in the form of 2 times 2
22:24
times two times two times two times two
22:26
times two et cetera et cetera et cetera
22:28
minus one
22:29
and they keep looking for all these
22:31
different two times two times two things
22:32
and check if they're prime
22:33
and some of them are and it also happens
22:36
if you write any number that's two times
22:38
two times two times two times two
22:39
minus one it can be written as a string
22:41
of ones in binary it's one one one one
22:43
one
22:45
and so this particular number which is
22:47
two to the power of eighty two million
22:49
five hundred and eighty nine thousand
22:50
nine hundred and thirty three
22:51
minus one is a prime number and it's
22:54
also written as one one one
22:55
one one one one in binary wow
22:59
yeah okay that's almost there that was
23:00
well explained
23:02
yeah impressive you should be a math
23:03
teacher so i saw this in scientific
23:05
american
23:06
this fact which was really good but
23:07
here's a slightly more accessible
23:09
maths fact from that article and that is
23:12
that the word 29
23:14
if you write it in capital letters can
23:15
be written with 29 straight line
23:17
segments
23:19
that's quite nice isn't it sorry if you
23:21
were so the t is a
23:22
is a line and a downwards line w is
23:25
four four five six and then if you add
23:27
them all up let's not do it all but they
23:29
count to 29
23:30
that's really cool that's how you
23:32
convince the kids that you're a cool
23:34
teacher
23:35
stuff like that and then you make your
23:36
calculator spell boobless and
23:39
then you launch into the prime number
23:40
stuff um yeah mercen primes is it
23:43
we so most n primes like you say are two
23:45
to the power something and then minus
23:46
one but we now keep finding these
23:49
as the as the largest prime numbers yes
23:51
so i think it's just because that's
23:53
where people are looking got it um and
23:56
they're kind of
23:56
easier to find because we know the kind
23:58
of format that they take so we can keep
24:00
looking for all the different two to the
24:02
power of
24:02
n minus one you can look at the next one
24:04
the next one the next one eventually
24:06
we'll find the prime number got it the
24:07
gap gets bigger doesn't it because once
24:09
you're up to
24:09
immerse in 74 million the prime number
24:11
theorem says only one and every 50
24:13
million numbers is prime
24:14
so you're searching for quite a big gap
24:16
so they've got a clump
24:18
so if you start at two two is prime and
24:20
three is prime
24:21
so at that stage everything's prime yeah
24:24
but then you get to four
24:25
and it all goes wrong yeah but then you
24:27
get to five and the prime again
24:28
and then as you go up there's fewer and
24:30
fewer as you keep going so marion mercen
24:32
of mercen prime
24:33
fame was a monk he was in the minims uh
24:36
he was
24:37
what was called a minim monk and he was
24:39
also known as the postbox of europe
24:42
because he was he ate letters he was
24:45
large and red
24:46
[Laughter]
24:49
he was a really crucial scientific
24:51
figure in the 1600s
24:52
and he was called the post box of europe
24:53
because he was unbelievably well
24:54
connected so he was like one of these
24:56
society ladies who brings people
24:58
together so he was like really great
25:00
mates with galileo with descartes
25:02
with pascal with hobbs and he used to
25:04
you know communicate between them all
25:06
and pass their letters to each other
25:07
and that was what i would say he was
25:10
going around
25:11
spreading gossip he was the postman
25:15
um so yeah and in that way he sort of
25:18
spread ideas and then they were able to
25:19
make discoveries based on each other's
25:21
ideas that's very cool very good
25:22
you can earn money from discovering new
25:24
pro numbers which is nice so this
25:26
thing um called gimps what is it the
25:28
great internet merzen prime
25:30
search uh it means that it's a little
25:32
bit of software you can install on your
25:34
computer and your computer will just in
25:35
the background
25:36
hunt for prime numbers but the prizes
25:38
are really variable so
25:40
currently if you find a prime number
25:41
that is fewer than a hundred million
25:43
digits long you only get three thousand
25:46
dollars
25:46
that's still not bad for doing literally
25:49
nothing better than a poke in the eye
25:50
but um the first person to find uh
25:54
a prime number which had one million
25:55
digits so that's a hundred times smaller
25:57
got fifty thousand dollars oh that's a
26:00
big jump isn't it no and when the record
26:02
passed 10 million digits in 2008 the
26:05
price
26:05
was a hundred thousand dollars yeah
26:08
not worth it i think you should get a
26:10
prize if your number is particularly
26:12
pleasing because i found an article
26:13
called the best prime numbers of 2016 so
26:16
i was very excited
26:18
and among the nominees uh is 314
26:21
159. why is that special it's
26:24
3.14 yeah it's basically a hundred
26:26
thousand times
26:27
nice isn't that beautiful i think i'm
26:30
going to propose that as best prime
26:31
number of all years not just 2016. that
26:33
is really good
26:34
i've got a rival mine's maybe an evil
26:37
prime number
26:38
what's it done it's it's basically that
26:42
yeah but with some stuff around it yeah
26:46
this is called belfagore's prime and
26:48
it's a palindrome and
26:49
it's also a very pleasing number so it's
26:51
one followed by 13 zeros
26:53
13 very unlucky number followed by six
26:56
six six followed by another thirteen
26:57
zeros followed by one
26:58
could you get unluckier that and that's
27:00
a prime number that's a prime number
27:01
that's really strong it's a cool one
27:03
isn't it that's very good yeah um
27:05
my favorite prime number is the sense
27:08
you didn't think you'd say this week is
27:09
this going to be a spin-off podcast
27:11
my favorite prime um my favorite is the
27:13
number
27:15
524 287
27:18
because that was proved to be prime uh
27:20
by a guy called cataldi in 1588
27:23
and then that was the largest known
27:24
prime number for 200 years
27:26
really yeah until euler came along that
27:29
spoiled sport island
27:31
um andy what's your favorite prime
27:32
number 17.
27:34
any reason i like it i genuinely find it
27:37
pleasing
27:37
and i've liked it for years as well by
27:39
the way guys i didn't just make one up
27:42
can i say another pie thing because i
27:44
really like this so
27:45
um if you want to memorize pie you can
27:47
use a sentence so this is the first
27:49
few digits of pi um how i want to drink
27:52
alcoholic of course after the heavy
27:54
lectures involving quantum mechanics
27:56
which is 3.141592 653879
28:00
and that's the number of letters in each
28:01
word i'll say it again how do
28:03
i wonder how i three point one oh yeah
28:07
all right how i want to drink how i want
28:09
to drink three
28:11
3.1415 oh clever
28:14
alcoholic nine of course
28:17
two six two six and you can go on
28:19
forever i mean pi goes on a long time
28:20
and i was hoping we could i was gonna
28:22
make one up for james's prime number but
28:24
uh yeah 23 million digits
28:25
[Laughter]
28:27
we said we did a prime number um podcast
28:31
in episode 98. i don't know if you
28:32
remember that i'm sure the listeners
28:34
will remember this was when the last
28:37
really big prime number was found
28:39
uh and we said that if you were to write
28:41
it out it would take three months
28:43
but i worked out that this one if you
28:45
were to write it down would take you
28:47
nine months
28:49
and but then again that's the 24 million
28:52
862 000 uh version if you write it in
28:56
binary
28:57
it's 82 million digits but they're all
29:00
the number one
29:00
and so i timed myself writing the number
29:02
one as quickly as i could
29:03
oh god i could do five a second for 10
29:07
seconds
29:07
i don't want to show off but i did that
29:09
quite impressive right on your tinder
29:11
profile
29:12
and so i worked out even though it's a
29:14
lot longer it would only take me
29:16
six months to write the binary version
29:18
out and it would take me nine months to
29:19
write there
29:20
are you factoring in the inevitable
29:22
arthritis that's gonna hit you in about
29:23
month three
29:24
i was thinking getting halfway through
29:25
and forgetting how many ones you've
29:26
written
29:30
and be like uh that's a really good 15
29:32
million
29:33
but there are other good ways of doing
29:34
it so for example you could write with
29:36
all four
29:37
digi all four limbs at once you can put
29:39
a pencil in each
29:40
hand yeah does it have to be coherently
29:44
written
29:44
or does it have to be just all over the
29:46
place i think you need to be able to
29:48
tell that they're ones and not just
29:50
okay what you could do is you could get
29:52
a pencil and you could just draw a long
29:54
line just run along
29:55
a very long wall and then someone after
29:57
you goes along with a rubber just
29:58
rubbing out gaps
30:00
and then turn it kind of nice it's
30:02
horizontal isn't it what have you been
30:03
drawing ones the wrong way
30:06
these dashes are actually ones michael
30:09
numbers
30:10
are in a very bad shape but all these
30:12
methods are going to be considered
30:13
cheating in this fictional and absurd
30:15
game that you've created yes
30:17
and actually in these versions i don't
30:18
sleep in any of them either
30:20
right yeah after six months there's no
30:23
sleeping
30:24
okay anyone got anything else uh you
30:26
have some illegal prime numbers
30:28
oh yeah yeah ones that you're not
30:30
allowed to say
30:31
say one i dare you four eight five six
30:34
five
30:34
actually it's got one thousand four
30:36
hundred and one digits in it so i'm not
30:37
going to say them all
30:38
that's the only reason i'm not gonna say
30:40
them all not because you're afraid
30:41
no they're not afraid of the the people
30:43
who make dvds
30:45
anymore so this is a
30:48
decryption algorithm which could
30:50
theoretically be used by a computer to
30:52
circumvent a dvd's copy protection
30:55
if you know what this um prime number is
30:58
and people wanted to put it on t-shirts
31:00
and stuff like that because they were so
31:01
annoyed by the man telling them what
31:03
prime numbers they can't and can't say
31:06
but i suppose dvds aren't really used
31:08
that much anymore so
31:09
does it matter they should that's one of
31:10
those archaic laws you know that you
31:12
find on the books thousands of years
31:14
later
31:14
like anyone who has a black caps allowed
31:16
to urinate on the back
31:17
wheel and carry a bale of hay exactly
31:20
yeah let's strike it from the magna
31:22
carta
31:23
[Music]
31:24
[Applause]
31:28
okay let's move on to our final facts
31:30
and that is andrew wanted murray
31:32
my fact is that to preserve their
31:33
anonymity michelangelo restaurant
31:35
reviewers are advised to not tell even
31:37
their parents what they do for a living
31:40
ah it's really secretive yeah that's why
31:44
so why is it so secretive is that
31:46
so the restaurants can't spot him
31:47
basically he must be right yeah because
31:49
um michelin pride themselves on their
31:51
anonymity
31:53
this was a this comes from a huge
31:54
feature that the new yorker wrote about
31:56
this
31:56
about 10 years ago actually so a lot of
31:58
michelin company executives have never
32:00
met an inspector
32:02
uh you you are kind of allowed to tell
32:04
your spouse for example
32:06
but it's it's otherwise they'd be a bit
32:09
suspicious that you're taking them to
32:10
restaurants every day
32:12
how are we affording this you don't have
32:15
a job
32:16
yeah you eat it and they do eat out
32:20
a lot yeah they have to dine out 200
32:22
days a year
32:25
well they're driving in between places
32:27
and they have to fill out reports for
32:28
hours and hours a day about these places
32:30
they have to eat the maximum number of
32:31
courses offered they can't skip pudding
32:34
ever um they have to eat everything on
32:36
their plate
32:38
yes true because they have to judge you
32:40
know whether the the seared whatever
32:42
you're not having pudding until you've
32:43
eaten your vegetables it's basically
32:45
like being a child wait but they don't
32:46
have to eat all of everything surely
32:48
what does it taste if they've had one
32:49
pee
32:50
it's not like the last you don't have to
32:51
have all the pizzas yeah if the peas are
32:52
awful the article says they have to eat
32:54
everything on their plate that's true
32:55
actually because what happens if one of
32:57
the peas is off
32:59
this review they want to know that don't
33:00
they but if they also if they bring you
33:02
500 p's
33:03
and you think there's too many peas you
33:05
can't have one p and say oh yeah the
33:06
peas are great you should make a note
33:07
they bring too many peas
33:10
i think the reviews are more complex
33:11
than knowing too many things
33:13
why do they keep sending into little
33:15
shirts
33:16
we're never going to give them a star
33:18
gun
33:20
well i like that mr michelin is sort of
33:23
we think of it as sort of fine dining
33:24
but it wasn't meant to mean that it was
33:26
meant to mean one star was very good
33:27
cooking
33:28
two was exceptionally worth a detour and
33:30
three was exceptional worth a special
33:31
journey it was supposed to be about how
33:32
much it was worth making the trip so it
33:34
could have been
33:34
if there's a really good little chef so
33:36
two is worth the detail so basically a
33:38
one michelin star
33:39
restaurant is not worth making a detail
33:41
to go to yeah
33:43
if you only go to a one michelin star
33:46
restaurant if you're
33:47
walking past them yeah they are staying
33:49
next door
33:50
that's really funny i was reading about
33:52
um restaurant reviews
33:54
um in newspapers which is a similar kind
33:56
of thing isn't it um
33:57
there's a famous one whose name is frank
33:59
bruni
34:00
uh who i really like because his name is
34:02
the plural of frank bruno
34:06
and he says that um he always wears
34:09
a wig and fake mustaches um but the
34:12
problem was that one of his books
34:13
his early box had his face on the cover
34:16
and then the dust jacket got put on the
34:17
internet
34:18
but you think you wouldn't put your face
34:20
on the cover of your own book no you
34:21
can't complain about your book cover
34:22
appearing on the internet
34:24
um maybe he didn't know that he was
34:25
going to be an anonymous restaurant
34:27
reviewer
34:27
maybe it's a different book yeah
34:29
absolutely the uk doesn't have many
34:31
anonymous reviews there's marina
34:32
o'laughlin who writes for the sunday
34:34
times and she always covers her face
34:35
with a plate
34:36
and then she gives her away when she
34:38
dies
34:41
oh your peas are in your lap marina
34:46
but and she says it's a real struggle
34:48
because obviously it's quite a small
34:50
you know cuisine food scene yeah and she
34:52
also she's done interviews saying my
34:54
husband
34:54
is incapable of going out for dinner
34:56
with me without bellowing marina at the
34:58
top of his voice
35:00
but i have read about people who when
35:01
they're dining by themselves like to
35:02
take a notebook this sort of freaks
35:04
people out if you go and sit there with
35:05
your notepad and the pen
35:06
excellent everyone's like well because
35:08
so michelin reviews aren't allowed are
35:10
they they're not allowed to take notes
35:11
because yeah it gives the game away a
35:12
great bluff
35:13
to pretend that you're not a
35:14
michelangelo that's what i always do i
35:16
go to
35:16
michelin star restaurants and i don't
35:18
take a notepad
35:20
and i just as soon as they see that they
35:22
think
35:23
they're sent into a panic at every
35:25
single customer
35:27
it's like being a really low stake spy
35:29
isn't it it's like if you're if you're a
35:30
coward but you want to be a spy
35:32
you should be one of these people it's
35:34
so stressful
35:37
there's one i really like ruth reichel i
35:40
think that's how you say her name
35:41
and um she goes to enormous lengths so
35:44
she was a reviewer for the new york
35:45
times
35:45
as well and she started wearing
35:48
disguises because she realized that
35:49
restaurants were offering rewards of up
35:50
to fifteen hundred dollars
35:52
for people who could spot her uh so that
35:54
they would know if she was going
35:55
and so she created all these alter egos
35:58
and she like really lives the part so
35:59
she said
36:00
my her first alter ego was a mousy woman
36:03
called molly hollis
36:04
uh she was a woman who had 30 years and
36:06
40 pounds on the real me
36:08
i said rachel so she dressed it up and
36:09
then she turned into chloe
36:11
a brazen blonde who flirted with waiters
36:13
and then sweet earthy red-headed brenda
36:16
and then after a time she was followed
36:18
by frumpy old betty
36:23
but i think the thing about being spies
36:25
is really interesting so
36:26
they're obviously spider-man to tell
36:27
people what they do for a living and
36:29
there was a former cia agent
36:30
uh called douglas langs who did an ama
36:32
on reddit and he said he told his family
36:34
he was a low-level salesman he doesn't
36:35
tend to invite more questions
36:36
but when he got sent to afghanistan he
36:38
told his family he's going to hawaii
36:39
because he thought that's far enough
36:40
away
36:41
but they kept trying to visit him and he
36:42
was like yeah we can't do that
36:44
but that's the same thing as the
36:46
restaurant guys like why are we going to
36:48
these casinos
36:50
but the best bit i read about the spy
36:52
thing is that there's not really a way
36:54
of testing
36:55
who's psychologically sort of good to be
36:57
a spy and what's the effect keeping the
36:58
secrets has on you because there aren't
36:59
enough spies you've come out about being
37:01
a spy he will volunteer for your survey
37:03
and there was a paper in the journal of
37:05
the association of
37:07
former intelligence officers which i
37:08
would love to read about yeah this
37:10
problem that you can't study the spies
37:12
because it's all secret so we don't
37:13
really know what impact
37:14
comparative falsehood density has for
37:16
the suppliers and presumably for the
37:17
restaurant critics as well
37:18
um i read the what i think is the first
37:20
restaurant review of all time
37:22
from 1859
37:23
[Laughter]
37:30
it was like having a meal at home but i
37:33
was in
37:34
someone else's building yes
37:37
and no it was better than that actually
37:39
it was if you can believe it it was
37:41
written in 1859
37:42
it's really long um and actually it's a
37:44
review of lots of restaurants they went
37:45
to about
37:46
10 different restaurants a lot of it is
37:48
taken up by the first full page of the
37:49
paper is taken up
37:51
with the person saying how bizarre it is
37:52
that the editor sent them on this
37:53
mission in the first place
37:55
stupid idea that we'll never catch on is
37:57
it exactly is it english or is it french
37:59
or is it
38:00
it's a new york times american okay and
38:03
it's so
38:04
good actually it really it starts the
38:06
tradition from the start of the a.a gill
38:08
style
38:08
great reviewing so um it describes one
38:10
of the restaurants he goes into he says
38:12
you walk in there's a pervading
38:13
atmosphere of gravy of which you become
38:16
more sensitive
38:20
he said many amateurs which you become
38:22
more sensible as you penetrate further
38:24
into the crowded room
38:25
a guest has no sooner seated himself
38:27
than a plate is flung at him by an
38:28
irritated and perspiring waiter
38:35
um you're like a perspiring waiter the
38:38
jerking of the playtech customers is
38:39
closely followed up by a similar
38:41
performance with the knife and fork
38:43
and he's very strong on waiters outfits
38:45
that seems to be the thing that this
38:46
reviewer most cares about
38:48
he says i prefer the man who is so good
38:50
as to bring me what i'm about to eat
38:51
should not appear in soiled garments
38:56
they were the standards that too is my
39:01
another way to shut himself but the food
39:04
was delicious
39:05
you know you can't judge by the
39:07
himself level of the weight
39:08
let me put you off a bit
39:11
one of the first professional restaurant
39:13
critics was
39:14
um grimo de la reniere
39:18
who was french and surprises
39:21
um he became a gomond
39:25
because something that happened in an
39:26
early age his parents were away
39:29
and his father returned from wherever
39:31
they were to find a pig
39:32
dressed up and presiding at his dinner
39:34
table
39:36
and the story made the rounds in paris
39:38
became quite famous and so
39:40
the family disinherited him and sent him
39:43
to an abbey
39:44
close to nancy where um he became
39:47
friends with um
39:48
the abbot and the abbot taught him the
39:50
art of good eating and then eventually
39:52
he became a restaurant critic
39:54
and did he learn that the art of good
39:55
eating does not involve dressing up
39:58
but you're a guy who cares about the
39:59
wishes outfits would love this there was
40:00
a pig in the most immaculate
40:02
dress he did the himself
40:05
i read about him and he was really cool
40:08
de la reinier
40:09
and he created this jury so the first
40:11
restaurant critic
40:13
uh was there were 17 of him because it
40:15
was him and 16
40:16
buddies prime number right my fave
40:21
and they met every week to taste food
40:22
but obviously you couldn't have 17
40:24
people going to the same restaurant as a
40:25
critic because it would definitely
40:27
be pretty obvious but they might so it's
40:29
so hard to book a table for that
40:31
that's true but they met every week at
40:33
the same place and the restaurants
40:35
sent their food to them no yeah
40:38
that's such a good idea it's weird isn't
40:41
it so
40:42
yeah although i would have thought the
40:44
food quality might degrade in transit
40:49
and he also gave his own funeral to see
40:51
who would come early
40:53
before he was dead before he was dead
40:54
yeah yeah and then he rose from the dead
40:56
halfway through
40:57
oh brilliant dramatic guy really fun
41:00
um i looked a bit more into the history
41:02
of michelin so when they started doing
41:03
the guides there were only 3 000 cars in
41:05
france so it's a bit more of a
41:07
thing everybody had and so i didn't
41:08
realize that the michelin man you know
41:10
the guy made out of tires was really
41:11
posh when he first came out to appeal to
41:13
these like
41:14
classes so he had a monocle a cigar
41:18
cufflinks and a
41:19
[Laughter]
41:26
because i don't think people know the
41:28
reason that the michelin stars came
41:30
about really the reason the michelin guy
41:31
came about was because they made tires
41:33
and they wanted to encourage people to
41:34
use their tires by driving to lots of
41:36
restaurants so they wore them out so
41:37
that they would have to buy new tires
41:39
which does seem like a convoluted way of
41:40
selling more tires
41:41
so we just pulled out the tires that
41:44
must be
41:45
why he's made of white tires because
41:48
we've said hey this used to be white
41:49
used to be white they they actually
41:51
colored him black for a brief period
41:53
when tyres became black with asphalt
41:55
but because it was bad for printing uh
41:57
it didn't really work so they made it
41:58
again wow but do you know what he's
42:00
called his name
42:02
which is bibendum and his his his name
42:05
means
42:06
now is the time for drinking or there's
42:08
drinking to be done but not driving
42:11
exactly and he was always he was
42:12
initially known as the road drunkard
42:16
genuinely um and basically the the
42:18
posters for him originally showed him as
42:21
ann says with you know with a monocle
42:22
and with champagne and everything but he
42:24
was drinking a big glass and the glass
42:26
was full of
42:27
nails and broken glass and all this
42:30
horrible stuff
42:31
and the idea behind the poster is that
42:33
michelin tires
42:34
drink up obstacles without puncturing so
42:37
he can soak up all this broken glass and
42:39
all these nails and he won't deflate
42:40
he'll be fine
42:41
that's not an easy message to get from
42:42
that image
42:45
it's a weird image so it's strange for
42:48
something that you know is associated
42:49
with high quality food and drink
42:51
to sort of be recommending a glass
42:52
filled with crap
42:54
and that does show that they didn't
42:56
really adapt the original logo because
42:58
it was originally designed for a beer
42:59
company wasn't it and i think it was
43:00
rejected the guy who drew
43:01
the michelin man bebendum that's why he
43:03
was called that and why he was drinking
43:05
but what was he why was he made of tires
43:09
that they did adjust it to make them
43:11
targets
43:13
they thought i will add some tyres you
43:15
could see why the beer company rejected
43:16
it
43:17
any reason why he is made of tyres just
43:20
thought it would work
43:21
distinctive he used to do live gigs the
43:23
michelin man so
43:24
this was in 1898 he had his first ever
43:26
live gig which is andre micheller one of
43:28
the
43:29
brothers behind the company he hired a
43:30
stall at a paris cycle show
43:32
he set up a big cardboard cutout of the
43:34
michelin man
43:35
and then he hired a cabaret comedian to
43:37
crouch behind it
43:38
and provide banter with the audience
43:41
that's brilliant
43:42
and he was apparently so good and so
43:44
drew such a massive crowd
43:46
that rival stall holders started pushing
43:48
and shoving and getting angry because
43:49
they would he was taking all their
43:50
custom
43:51
and they had to call the police wow yeah
43:53
he was a comedian
43:55
a big hard drinking comedian
43:58
nails swilling cufflink wearing you two
44:00
had a lot in common
44:04
we would get along

[Music]
01:47
[Applause]
01:50
[Music]
01:52
hello and welcome to another episode of
01:55
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
01:57
coming to you from the qi offices in
01:59
covent garden my name is dan schreiber i
02:02
am sitting here with andrew hunter
02:03
murray james harkin and anna chazinski
02:06
and once again we have gathered around
02:08
the microphones with our four favorite
02:09
facts from the last seven days and in no
02:12
particular order here we go starting
02:14
with you chazinski my fact this week is
02:17
that in amsterdam the roads are paved
02:20
with used toilet paper
02:23
as gold
02:25
yeah dick whittington is very different
02:27
there
02:28
and this is a really cool thing actually
02:31
so the road constructor in the
02:32
netherlands called kws has realized that
02:35
to make a kind of improved version of
02:38
tarmac it can use the cellulose that it
02:40
gets from recycled toilet paper so the
02:42
toilet paper goes into the sewage system
02:44
you flush it into the sewage system and
02:45
then they basically put it through kind
02:46
of a sieve which gets the poo
02:49
out oh that's that's important
02:52
it's a really important stage of this
02:53
whole process it is you don't want to be
02:55
driving on poo
02:57
no but or
02:58
walking no
03:00
or crawling on it after a night out in
03:01
amsterdam no
03:03
none of those things so there's no poo
03:05
in it it's just uh paper and it thickens
03:08
it apparently so and it makes it uh
03:11
better absorbing water so it improves
03:13
it's like water wicking away from the
03:14
surface of the road so it makes the
03:15
roads less slippery and apparently it
03:17
reduces noise as well so it's very quiet
03:20
if you're walking on lu rule great that
03:22
makes sense so what's it mixed with
03:24
it's not just the toilet paper that's
03:26
just laid down no it's with asphalt it's
03:28
the usual okay so it's usual ingredients
03:31
i i found a fact about what else you
03:33
could make a road out of you can make a
03:34
road out of rubber
03:35
which is cool yeah so it's like the
03:37
whole road is made of tires
03:39
does that if you were walking on that do
03:41
you think it'd be easier to walk because
03:42
you could kind of bounce around i think
03:44
so yeah they have to use tires by the
03:47
way not just rubber but actual ground up
03:49
tires sorry this is this is what i mean
03:50
yeah exactly that oh i didn't know it
03:52
was in yellowstone oh yeah in
03:53
yellowstone they partnered up with um
03:54
michelin i believe it was and they um
03:57
they've been grinding up the tires
03:59
the cars are basically riding over their
04:01
dead comrades exactly it's a bit
04:03
depressing isn't it
04:05
very dark
04:08
um is it uh
04:09
is it the case then that we can just put
04:11
anything in the roads should we just be
04:12
putting everything we don't need in the
04:14
roads so far we've got plastic rubber
04:16
yeah toilet paper nuclear waste nuclear
04:18
waste what are we doing why is there
04:20
even rubbish every time you chuck a
04:21
packet out of the car just say i'm not
04:23
littering i'm tarmac
04:26
you cigarette butts oh well uh do you
04:29
know this is a weird thing lots of uh
04:32
roads in london used to be paved with
04:33
wood
04:34
and that was good partly because it was
04:36
quieter under horse's hooves
04:38
and also
04:39
it was less slippery but it did have
04:41
downsides because it would soak up horse
04:43
urine and then if a heavy wagon passed
04:45
over it would just squirt horse urine
04:48
that is a downside
04:51
a place that has some quite exciting
04:53
roads is vermont so vermont is covered
04:56
in invisible roads
04:59
sorry
05:00
covered covered covered in non-existent
05:02
roads and it was causing a major problem
05:04
so basically vermont is the only state
05:06
where if a road has ever been um built
05:09
or even planned or you know someone
05:12
suggested that we might put a road here
05:14
it goes down legally as a recognized
05:16
road and it can never be undone so
05:18
mostly a road is discontinued legally
05:20
after a few years if it's not being used
05:22
so if you look at sort of old maps of
05:24
vermont it's just the whole thing is
05:25
just roads and that means because roads
05:27
are public highways that means that you
05:29
can have your house it's probably on an
05:31
ancient byway of some sort and people
05:33
could just wander through your house any
05:34
time of day because they can say look at
05:36
this old map from 1790 this used to be a
05:39
road
05:40
and people were getting really annoyed
05:42
with this so i think they've actually
05:43
had to address it there was a law in
05:45
that came out about 2009 which said okay
05:48
guys you've got to stop claiming there's
05:49
an old road here so you can walk into
05:51
this person's drawing room and places
05:53
were told to claim their roads or lose
05:54
them by 2015 i think it's only that one
05:57
guy who goes uh excuse me there used to
05:59
be a road here it's got about a million
06:02
maps in bags
06:04
i've got here
06:07
um do you know how white lines on roads
06:09
came about according to the internet so
06:12
i would say it's to make sure that
06:14
people stay on their side of the road it
06:16
was that yes but they were invented well
06:18
done
06:19
ten points uh they were invented in 1911
06:21
in michigan by a guy called edward hines
06:23
and this is just the kind of thing that
06:24
with research is so annoying because um
06:27
the michigan department of
06:28
transportation and all these books say
06:31
edward hines at the time he was chairman
06:33
of the county board of rhodes and he
06:35
came up with the idea of putting white
06:37
lines in the middle to stop cars just
06:38
driving in the middle of the road he
06:40
came up with the idea after watching a
06:42
leaky milk truck make its way down the
06:44
road
06:45
now you read that and you're like that's
06:47
obviously not true isn't it he just
06:48
thought because the question is why not
06:50
why did he choose white well because
06:52
obviously you just choose white on black
06:54
because if it was like a leaky chocolate
06:55
milkshake truck we would have
06:57
groundlines
07:00
it's just and there's no evidence for it
07:02
i always wonder who comes up with these
07:04
things first who decides did he not i
07:07
thought he had claimed that he saw spilt
07:08
milk there's certainly no evidence
07:10
online really
07:12
of him crying over spilt milk but let's
07:14
make a line but you say white being the
07:16
obvious but so at the time when they
07:18
officially recognized that yes we want
07:20
to put this on all the roads in america
07:22
and white was picked oregon said we want
07:24
to do it in yellow and they thought that
07:25
that was a much better color someone saw
07:27
someone pissing on a road
07:34
um yeah but they eventually did change
07:36
it to yellow strips in america for the
07:39
center parting of a rose
07:42
yeah
07:44
you get yellow lines here and then red
07:45
lines which are the really serious ones
07:48
so there are there is what are the
07:49
serious ones i don't drive so i don't
07:51
know red lights on the road mean really
07:53
don't park here yeah yellow you're
07:55
probably fine
07:57
which means like you're not it's roads
07:59
going in and out of big cities where you
08:00
really do not want anyone ever parking
08:02
there technically on a yellow line you
08:04
can park there for like 10 minutes if
08:06
you're loading or unloading is that so
08:08
yeah someone swatted up for their theory
08:12
[Laughter]
08:22
he wants to take the qrf on his next
08:23
driving exam jesus um something i've
08:26
always found really amazing about road
08:28
surfaces is a fact about bitumen
08:31
which i remember finding this out in the
08:33
n series when i was researching the
08:34
nabateans who were this amazing middle
08:36
eastern civilization but basically the
08:38
reason they were like the richest
08:39
civilization uh from about 500 bc to 200
08:42
bc um in arabia and they got rich by
08:46
selling tarmac and the way they got
08:48
tarmac was they were near the dead sea
08:50
and this weird thing happened when there
08:52
was an earth tremor of some sort
08:54
huge amounts of bitumen would just
08:56
suddenly bubble up to the surface of the
08:57
dead sea so these massive islands of
09:00
bitumen just appeared they would sit
09:02
there like the size of houses and then
09:03
the nabataeans would just row or swim
09:05
out to them climb onto them and hack the
09:07
bitumen off and then go and sell it and
09:09
they sell it to the egyptians who used
09:10
it in embalming and they became super
09:12
rich and i just find that whole thing
09:14
like islands of tarmac
09:17
and i think the word mummy comes from
09:19
bitumen because of that
09:21
thing
09:22
i think so then it comes from a word for
09:24
bitumen yeah yeah i wonder why it
09:26
stopped presumably it stopped i think
09:28
they were i think it ran out wow i think
09:30
they got all of it they scavenged all
09:31
the all the bitumen speaking of things
09:33
that came out of the ground unexpectedly
09:36
um
09:37
such strong links
09:39
a man in the city of amsterdam has
09:42
recently been injured after a pop-up
09:43
public toilet that was sunk into the
09:45
ground emerged unexpectedly
09:49
the man was hit by a moped which was
09:51
thrown up in the air
09:53
wow so there's like a toilet that just
09:54
comes out at night for revellers and
09:56
stuff like that and they keep it
09:57
underground normally but just for some
09:59
reason it just popped up there was a
10:01
moped on top of it and it flew in the
10:02
air and it hit this guy wow wow
10:05
how fast do they pop up
10:08
around like a jack in the bottle amazing
10:11
that's terrifying
10:12
i've got a fact about toilet paper
10:14
actually while we're on toilets this is
10:16
another thing you can make toilet paper
10:17
out of you can make it out of milk
10:20
what yeah
10:22
there's a company i think it's a german
10:24
and an italian company they teamed up
10:26
one made fabrics and one new was a
10:28
design company or something anyway it's
10:31
they
10:32
made this thing which is called caressa
10:33
de latte which is milk caress
10:36
and it's a it uses a protein which they
10:39
extract from soured milk so it's all
10:41
waste milk it's if the cow has been ill
10:44
and you can't sell the milk to custard
10:45
that's not how you get sour milk
10:49
by having normal milk in it going off
10:50
it's not like oh this milk is off it
10:52
must have been a sick cow
10:55
sorry
10:56
they take the normal milk from sick cows
10:59
and then the sours all right i'm sorry
11:00
they're separate things um but it's so
11:03
it's waste milk so the farmers can sell
11:04
it for a very small amount not for the
11:06
drinking milk price but then you can
11:08
turn it into toilet paper which i guess
11:10
you can also eat
11:11
so you can if you're hungry on the loo
11:13
you could just eat a bit of this milk
11:15
from a sick cow i don't want to eat milk
11:17
milk from a sick cat wait is milk is
11:20
milk bad if it's from a sick cow yeah
11:21
that was that was another thing i was
11:23
thinking like i'd never thought of that
11:25
it depends how sick i guess yeah that's
11:28
yeah uh it depends what's in the depends
11:30
what bacteria if it has mastitis for
11:32
instance yes then that might be bad yeah
11:34
yeah but
11:36
if it's communicable to humans then it's
11:38
a problem isn't it it's weird amsterdam
11:40
so that toilet i've never seen the the
11:42
one you james you were talking about
11:43
earlier that comes through the ground
11:44
that's the problem you don't see it you
11:45
don't see it in the last minute yeah and
11:47
it's and they're very they're they're
11:48
good they're good for women they make
11:50
them so the ones in london that you see
11:52
are purely urinals from men but these
11:54
ones can be used by women and they've
11:56
just they seem to have innovations for
11:58
toilets that are um sort of
12:00
groundbreaking there's an amazing one
12:02
you guys remember
12:03
yeah yeah in that case yeah the um
12:05
remember the little fly that got used on
12:07
a urinal for men yeah so the idea is
12:09
that a urinal would have a little
12:11
drawing of a fly in the center of it and
12:13
that would encourage men to try and aim
12:16
to to hit the fly i saw that
12:18
unfortunately there was also a fly in
12:19
the room flying around
12:21
so i kind of chased him around with a
12:23
jet of urine that was i was not pretty
12:25
at all welcome back to that restaurant
12:28
um but yeah so that was that was debuted
12:30
in the 90s in amsterdam's airport yeah
12:34
yeah and shuffle yeah um and that's now
12:36
used globally to help the reduced
12:38
spillage that happens in a lot of
12:39
bathrooms that's good yeah the
12:41
netherlands making waves in toilets
12:44
basically i think we've learned from
12:45
this another bit of netherland toilet
12:47
technology oh yeah rotterdam has a
12:49
revolving toilet
12:51
wow that sounds extremely disconcerting
12:56
is it is it public toilet yeah it's not
12:57
in a revolving restaurant no okay
12:59
performing is it because they couldn't
13:01
afford a door so it's a way of turning
13:03
your back on people while you wee so
13:05
they can't see you really good idea
13:07
they'd still be able to see the back of
13:08
your head oh does it have a big sail on
13:10
top and whichever wind direction is
13:11
prevailing the toilet faces that way for
13:14
what reason
13:15
so that the weed doesn't blow back in
13:17
your face exactly that reason
13:19
no not that uh it's because it's got two
13:22
toilets in it and so you use one of them
13:25
and then you walk out and there's a
13:27
detection that can tell there's no
13:28
person in it and then it flips around
13:30
the two toilets and it can clean the
13:32
other one while being on the toilet so
13:36
the previously cleaned one is now in
13:37
that place do you know what it means yes
13:39
yes does that make sense
13:40
while i'm inside one toilet is someone
13:42
else gonna be cleaning that other toilet
13:44
and i have to wait for them to finish
13:45
that i think it's kind of robotic
13:47
cleaning right okay so yeah so you're
13:49
there and you use the toilet and then
13:51
you leave and then it flips around so
13:52
there's now a clean toilet there and the
13:54
old one is being cleaned by a robot or
13:56
something that's great it's not a human
13:57
imagine it turning around you're just
13:58
hearing a voice go oh jesus christ oh
14:02
man
14:09
okay it is time for fact number two and
14:12
that is andy
14:14
one frequent result of winning the
14:16
lottery is going bankrupt this also
14:19
applies to people who just live near
14:21
people who have won the lottery
14:24
very good so it's so unfair what i mean
14:26
neighbors of lottery winners tend to go
14:28
bankrupt basically it's doubly unfair
14:30
isn't it yeah really why well because
14:33
you've not won the lottery and you've
14:34
gone bankrupt yeah it is it is doubly
14:36
unfair yeah it's weird so why why
14:39
well there's a there's a study that's
14:41
been done by researchers at the
14:43
university of alberta in canada and
14:45
georgetown and they studied the canadian
14:46
province which had 7 000 lottery winners
14:49
and what they found was in areas where
14:51
people won the lottery the bankruptcy
14:53
rate goes up by six percent
14:55
and this might be because people will
14:57
keep it a secret the fact that they've
15:00
won the lottery so people borrow more
15:02
around them because they want to keep up
15:04
with the joneses as it were they think
15:05
oh wow they've got a yacht
15:07
i think we better get a yacht and they
15:08
start borrowing more money and then
15:12
[Laughter]
15:14
they take more risks and they and they
15:16
they borrow more and then they're likely
15:18
to go bust i suppose it doesn't even
15:19
have to be a secret right even if you
15:21
know they've won the lottery if you see
15:22
them buying something nice then you want
15:24
to keep up yeah exactly and i think
15:26
didn't one of the studies find that um
15:28
the neighbors would buy conspicuous
15:31
goods because obviously you're buying
15:32
goods that you want people to see you
15:33
want people to know that you're doing as
15:34
well as those neighbors who won the
15:35
lottery so it said they'd they'd buy
15:38
things like cars posh cars but wouldn't
15:40
spend money on indoor items like
15:42
furniture
15:44
just guys sit in the car
15:48
just empty barren homes
15:51
seven ferraris outside wow so i guess
15:54
it's statement making as opposed to yeah
15:56
yeah exactly it is it's classic keeping
15:58
up with the joneses yeah yeah and it's
16:00
um nearly a third of lottery winners
16:01
declare bankruptcy according to some
16:03
estimates isn't it wow
16:05
it's amazing that i think in america
16:08
winning the lottery sometimes doesn't
16:10
mean winning the big prize it can mean
16:12
winning a smaller amount they just still
16:14
would call that winning lottery whereas
16:16
i think in britain if you say i won the
16:17
lottery you have to win over a million
16:19
quid i would say right yeah yeah so
16:21
there's
16:22
there are lots of studies there's one
16:23
which i found debunked saying that
16:25
seventy percent of lottery would just go
16:27
bankrupt which i think there's not much
16:29
evidence
16:30
that's just too many um but
16:33
i found others saying that lottery
16:35
winners are likelier to declare
16:36
bankruptcy within the first five years
16:38
after winning the prize than the average
16:40
american right because in the first two
16:42
years you're probably fine because you
16:43
probably haven't spent all the money
16:44
within two years yeah yeah i was reading
16:46
about britain's first ever lottery so
16:49
this was this was over 450 years ago
16:52
this was um in 16th century and it was
16:55
uh the prize was not just money you got
16:59
other items as well so runners-up would
17:01
have a prize so you would get gold jugs
17:03
or linen
17:05
um and then and the lottery took three
17:06
years to do so you took three years ago
17:08
buy ourselves a gold jug because the
17:10
next star i've just got a really nice
17:12
jacket
17:13
but check this out if you just bought
17:15
the ticket alone and you didn't win
17:17
anything what that ticket did give you
17:19
was a prize as well which was you
17:21
avoided any kind of arrest
17:24
you had a pardon from being you had a
17:26
pardon as long as it wasn't murder and
17:28
something that really was you know you'd
17:30
you'd stolen someone's entire contents
17:33
of their house including their gold jugs
17:35
you
17:36
would have a pass i'm getting arrested
17:37
you take a chance and you get a get out
17:39
of jail free card
17:41
yes is this this is queen elizabeth
17:42
isn't it it is yeah yeah so she set it
17:44
up because she wanted to raise lots of
17:46
money for shipbuilding and i think the
17:47
legal immunity only applied for a week
17:49
it was seven days yeah it was so that
17:50
you could go in and it was it was if it
17:53
so it didn't count if you committed
17:54
piracy murder felonies or treatment
17:57
but you were and it was so that you
17:58
could go into towns and buy your ticket
17:59
because she was desperate for people to
18:00
buy tickets wasn't she and if you went
18:02
in as a criminal and there was a wanted
18:03
sign on the door then
18:05
oh wow it's like it's like a version of
18:07
the purge like you have this everyone's
18:09
suddenly seven day window but that's
18:11
what i was wondering people surely
18:12
didn't just buy it and then do something
18:14
illegal did they that kind of happened
18:16
i'd steal another ticket
18:18
after seven days perpetual scam yes
18:22
yeah but after you've stolen the ticket
18:24
i'm not sure you're immune anymore
18:25
because then you've bought it so i think
18:26
you're just immune when you go in to buy
18:28
it so i think as soon as you committed
18:29
that crime it'd be like we've got what
18:31
we want now
18:32
there's one that was done which was in
18:34
sweden which was a speed camera lottery
18:37
um and that was it was you would buy a
18:38
lottery and it would use all the money
18:40
that it was generating from people who
18:41
were going past speed cameras and
18:43
speeding and that excess money so it
18:44
kind of turned it into a into a thing
18:46
where you actively wanted to not get
18:49
caught because you could then win the
18:50
money uh from people who were speeding
18:52
it was a sort of psychological oh wait
18:54
if you were speeding were you not
18:55
eligible
18:56
to win the speed camera fund i think
18:59
everyone was allowed to yeah i think it
19:00
must have been you couldn't be excluded
19:02
so you weren't incentivized to not speed
19:04
you were actually incentivized to speed
19:05
so there was more fund in the in the
19:07
speeding lottery
19:15
just everyone sat in a bus going faster
19:17
faster
19:19
i gotta put my kid through college
19:21
we've mentioned we've previously
19:23
mentioned the dog poo lottery haven't we
19:24
in taiwan i think we must have done it
19:26
we have sounds like the kind of thing we
19:28
wouldn't yeah you had to have a bag of
19:30
dog poo to get a ticket
19:32
okay so is that incentivizing you to
19:36
make your dog's post
19:38
[Laughter]
19:51
and yet you've answered this 500 times
19:53
in the last week we have questions about
19:55
your diet
19:59
um i was reading about the guy whose job
20:00
is to go around and tell people that
20:02
they've won the lottery which i think
20:04
might be one of the best jobs you can
20:05
have yeah so he's in britain he's a guy
20:07
called andy carter and he basically is
20:10
the person who goes to people's houses
20:11
once they know they've won and asked
20:13
what they want to do about it do they
20:14
want to set up a bank account oh they
20:16
already have one
20:18
do they want to put their money in it do
20:20
they want to keep it under the mattress
20:22
that kind of thing it doesn't sound very
20:24
professional
20:26
every week he's like you already have a
20:28
bank account
20:29
i've got to get myself one of those
20:32
um yeah he gives them various bits of
20:35
advice and stuff and he's yeah so he's
20:37
called andy carter and he says that he
20:39
often has to go in disguise so he'll
20:40
often have to go as like an estate agent
20:42
because if i saw andy carter rocking up
20:44
the road now i'd be like oh that's him
20:47
that's and no one knows what he looks
20:48
like but that would be great news if you
20:50
saw andy carter walking up to you but if
20:52
you see him walking up to your neighbor
20:53
the point is that 85 percent of people
20:55
keep their identity secret because
20:57
they're all such greedy people no one
20:58
knows what abby carter looks
21:05
which i doubt he does
21:06
he usually dresses as one of those big
21:08
lottery balls
21:10
he just has to cover that up with a
21:12
cloak when he visits
21:13
you know if a weird man walks up to your
21:15
neighbor's door you'll ask them
21:16
hopefully i don't think anything about
21:18
it i don't
21:19
i don't know my neighbors i live in
21:20
london i don't i've never met most of my
21:23
neighbours well people are very nosy in
21:24
the region
21:26
i would assume it was one of my
21:27
neighbors if i saw randy carter
21:34
and he did say he gets some quite
21:37
weird people people are so secretive so
21:39
he said once he had to go and organize
21:42
the lottery wins with a man who was
21:43
keeping it secret from his entire family
21:45
and so he said he went he visited the
21:47
man he said he was pacing around the
21:48
room and asking me how long the visit
21:50
was going to take as his wife had popped
21:51
out to tesco and he wasn't planning to
21:53
tell her god he reassured me they're
21:55
perfectly happy very much in love she's
21:58
just not interested in the money side of
21:59
things
22:00
wow wow that's pretty dodgy isn't it
22:03
those two are not together anymore
22:05
[Laughter]
22:07
he does always bring his balls with him
22:12
he says it's one of the first things
22:13
people want to see
22:14
[Laughter]
22:18
now i think that i do see why
22:21
you know in disguise because if weird
22:22
mans come to the door and they're saying
22:24
can i see your balls please oh it must
22:27
be anticipated
22:29
no not just the estate agent this is how
22:31
they sell things these days well that's
22:33
a good reason to want to win the lottery
22:34
because i had insist on meeting andy
22:36
carter really weird and i'd ask him to
22:38
come dressed as a particular thing as
22:39
well to bring his bowls yeah
22:42
they're not his bolts
22:44
they're not his they're the lottery's
22:45
balls they people always want to see a
22:46
few example balls
22:51
show me your balls
22:56
um
22:57
robert mugabe won the zimbabwe and
22:59
national last week
23:03
just a fact
23:04
were the chances
23:06
um did you know that in 2014 80 of
23:10
donations to the scottish pro
23:12
independence campaign came from one euro
23:14
millions lottery winner no yeah
23:17
unbelievable well there's this couple
23:18
called colin and chris weir and they got
23:20
161 million in 2011 and they yeah they
23:23
provided 79 of the donations to that
23:25
campaign that was money well spent
23:27
wasn't it
23:27
[Laughter]
23:30
um 10 of people who win more than a
23:32
million pounds buy a caravan
23:35
do they yeah 10 that's quite a high
23:37
proportion that is so weird i wouldn't
23:39
have thought the cost of a caravan was
23:41
super prohibitive i wouldn't thought you
23:42
needed a million pounds
23:44
to buy one to buy top end but let's say
23:47
you win a million quid
23:48
you could probably give up your job yes
23:51
you could yeah you could give up your
23:53
job right yeah but probably you'd want
23:55
to go on a lot of holidays but you
23:57
couldn't go on lots of massive really
23:59
round-the-world gold-plated aeroplane
24:01
holidays for a million quid could you
24:03
you're right so you have to have
24:05
something where you can go on nice
24:06
holidays but you don't have to pay a lot
24:08
of money you could live in a caravan
24:09
until you died if you had a million quid
24:11
it's the dream
24:14
well i'm giving up jobs i read a really
24:16
interesting stat which is that
24:18
86 percent of american lottery winners
24:20
and this is people who've won the
24:22
jackpot so they've won millions 86 of
24:24
americans stick with their jobs whereas
24:26
in the equivalent in britain 41 percent
24:28
do
24:29
wow
24:31
are we much lazier would you anna
24:33
i'd be out of here like
24:36
if i find a five pounder on the street
24:41
[Music]
24:46
okay it is time for fact number three
24:48
and that is my fact my fact this week is
24:50
that the tenth correspondence chess
24:53
olympiad which is done entirely by post
24:55
took so long to complete that the
24:57
winners of both gold and bronze
24:59
represented countries that no longer
25:01
existed
25:02
[Laughter]
25:04
pretty amazing so funny so this is a
25:07
competition that is still going uh to
25:09
this day um i believe they're on the
25:12
21st although online on wikipedia it
25:14
says they're on their 10th so maybe
25:16
there's a few different governing bodies
25:17
the ladies one is on its tenth maybe is
25:19
it right okay so here's the thing the
25:21
match that we're talking about with the
25:23
10th correspondence chess olympiad that
25:25
started in 1987 and it takes years and
25:28
years to finish the games and get to the
25:31
final and have a winner in fact the 11th
25:33
uh correspondence olympiad started
25:35
before the 10th even finished they just
25:37
get bored and they go we gotta get going
25:40
so the winners of uh the 10th uh in gold
25:43
place was someone from the ussr
25:46
and in bronze was east germany both of
25:49
which were dissolved countries by the
25:51
time the winning
25:53
the winner was announced in 1995. uh but
25:56
these days i think tom most tournament
25:58
matches are limited to just only two and
26:01
a half years yes yeah so these days if
26:03
you're still going after two and a half
26:05
years then an independent arbitrator
26:07
comes along and says i think you're
26:09
winning
26:11
and it's amazing so the system the way
26:12
it works is that you send a postcard to
26:15
the person that you're playing against
26:16
and you have three days to make your
26:18
move and send another post postcard back
26:20
so they look at the dates on the
26:21
postcard but because of the mail taking
26:24
so long in certain countries you know
26:26
you might not receive it for weeks
26:27
months even uh so it's very important
26:30
that little date that sits on the actual
26:32
postcard itself yeah so it's the date
26:34
that it arrives is when you start
26:36
which you can just say that is whenever
26:38
you want actually yeah um so people have
26:41
noticed that if people are really
26:42
struggling towards the end that it seems
26:44
to take a lot longer for the
26:46
letters to arrive to them
26:48
but then when you send it that's when
26:49
the post
26:50
mark is so you can't cheat that one can
26:52
you yeah i really like the idea that you
26:54
can use uh you can use help as well yeah
26:57
so you can use books or magazines or the
26:58
internet you can use anything short of
27:00
running the entire game through a chess
27:01
software program which is frowned on
27:04
it is i'm banned yeah but it means that
27:06
the better players it's a slightly
27:09
different skill to playing normal chess
27:10
isn't it so if you play normal chester's
27:12
time limits apart from anything the
27:14
person you're playing against just gets
27:15
really bored and doesn't want to play
27:16
anymore but in this because there's not
27:18
really any time limits well you say you
27:20
know three days it's you have um 30 days
27:23
for every 10 moves so you could take you
27:25
know
27:26
30 days or 20 days
27:28
well that's what i find i find that
27:30
really worrying about this i think i
27:31
would be extremely bad at it because
27:33
it's a classic encouraging people to
27:34
leave it's the last minute thing yeah
27:35
you've got 30 days for 10 moves so i
27:38
know i'd forget about it for 29.5 days
27:40
and then suddenly you've got to send you
27:42
know it would be like postcards you've
27:44
done your move yeah i did mine days ago
27:46
exactly yes james come on i'm just gonna
27:48
do this other thing
27:50
i reckon it's more stressful there's a
27:52
guy called croydon h jarvis who took
27:55
eight years to complete one move
27:59
how in his defense it wasn't his fault
28:01
so he started he was a british guy and
28:02
he started playing correspondence chess
28:04
with a german in 1931 and they played a
28:06
lot together um and then in the middle
28:08
of one of their games the war
28:09
interrupted and that probably wasn't his
28:12
fault
28:13
no it was inconvenient for them though
28:16
so they couldn't post during the war
28:18
because postal service were interrupted
28:19
and for two years afterwards they
28:20
couldn't post to each other and then i
28:22
think in 1948 he got a postcard from his
28:24
opponent saying look mate are you going
28:26
to finish this game
28:27
otherwise i'm claiming victory it's
28:29
amazing and lots of people even if the
28:32
postal service wasn't affected they
28:33
weren't allowed to do it because people
28:34
thought they were codes didn't they yeah
28:36
i think there's even humphrey bogart was
28:39
visited by the fbi because they thought
28:41
he was sending um secrets through postal
28:43
chess what secrets did humphrey bogart
28:45
have access to
28:47
he wasn't he was an actor yeah but he
28:49
always played spies in movies didn't he
28:50
so yeah
28:53
yeah there was one guy called graham
28:54
mitchell wasn't there who a load of
28:56
postcards surfaced recently which had
28:58
bizarrely cryptic stuff so he was uh
29:01
deputy head of m of mi5 in the 1950s and
29:04
it's thought that he was corresponding
29:06
uh
29:07
using postal chess as a way of
29:09
exchanging secrets from the case so it
29:10
was reasonable that they would suggest
29:12
that yeah yeah although he has been
29:14
exonerated that is literally my personal
29:15
opinion based on having read the
29:17
postcards
29:18
what did you get from the postcards they
29:20
just seemed like you wouldn't write
29:22
sentences quite like that instead of
29:24
saying queen to d4 he would say queen to
29:26
balmoral on the 17th of april
29:31
and there was a 19th century chess
29:33
master called joseph blackburn who was
29:35
arrested as a spy for sending chess
29:37
moves through the mail
29:38
because they thought they were secrets i
29:40
really like him because he thought that
29:42
drinking whiskey improved the brain
29:44
uh and every time he played chess he
29:46
tried to prove it so he always drank
29:49
whiskey during every game and according
29:51
to the official records he played more
29:53
than a hundred thousand games of chess
29:54
in his career wow
29:57
um i've been looking at the chess
29:59
records this is full of absolute great
30:02
stuff this wikipedia page it's really
30:03
funny but there was one which i really
30:05
like which is you know people play
30:07
simultaneous chess they play lots of
30:08
games at the same time
30:10
so i'm just going to read this out
30:11
verbatim the worst result in a
30:13
simultaneous exhibition given by a
30:15
master occurred in 1951 when
30:17
international master robert wade gave a
30:19
simultaneous exhibition against 30
30:21
russian schoolboys aged 14 and under
30:24
after seven hours of play
30:27
wade had lost 20 games
30:30
and drawn the remaining 10.
30:34
that's a bad day isn't it maybe he was
30:36
letting them win that kid
30:40
that is amazing um so simultaneous chess
30:43
is one very challenging form of chess it
30:45
gets more challenging if you're
30:46
blindfolded playing it which is the
30:47
thing that people have done historically
30:49
and uh this has been considered in
30:51
history multiple times a really
30:53
dangerous thing to do so blindfold chess
30:55
has been and you don't have to be
30:57
blindfolded you just have to be not able
30:58
to see the board when you're making your
31:00
moves so it's about being able to
31:01
memorize exactly the position of the
31:03
ball because you'd knock over the pieces
31:07
um so yeah this is a thing and it was
31:09
quite popular in the 19th century there
31:11
are prominent blindfold chess players
31:12
there are a couple called morphe and
31:14
steinitz both of whom played and they
31:16
kept having these mental breakdowns and
31:18
so it spread that it would give you
31:19
brain fever and there's a lot of reports
31:21
say the ussr banned displays in it in
31:24
1930 because it was so bad for your
31:26
mental health because it was too
31:27
challenging
31:28
kasparov's coach spoke out against it
31:30
and said this is bad for you and so
31:32
kasparov never played it and it's
31:34
thought that might be why
31:35
so it's actually really dangerous
31:37
because you have to hold the whole board
31:39
in your head yeah don't you're not
31:40
allowed to look at the board no but what
31:42
if you i just because obviously some you
31:45
might miss here you know a three for a
31:47
four and be playing a completely
31:48
separate game to the game that your
31:50
opponent i don't think you're gonna miss
31:52
here a three for a far are you well uh i
31:54
don't know a d for an e e4 and d4 yeah
31:57
exactly yeah you're right is that so do
31:59
they tell you if you've gone off board
32:03
e52
32:08
um yes i don't know you must lose
32:10
immediately right otherwise it can't be
32:12
like could i put that pawn on d
32:14
four and they go no you can't that's an
32:16
illegal move okay what about the bishop
32:18
to e5 no sorry you lost the bishop ten
32:20
turns again what are you doing
32:23
and you also sunk my battleship
32:31
okay it is time for our final fact of
32:33
the show and that is james okay my fact
32:36
this week is that when they're about to
32:38
be born baby sharks sometimes pop their
32:40
heads out of their mother's cervix
32:42
before taking a look around deciding
32:45
against it and retreating back into the
32:47
womb
32:49
what do they not like the look of
32:51
who knows just the world wow
32:54
you can't say we haven't all thought at
32:55
some stage in our lives wouldn't it be
32:57
better to just revert back into the
32:59
world
33:01
it's that's horrifying it's amazing it's
33:03
so good so how many times can they do
33:05
this will there be sort of a 10 year old
33:07
sharks
33:08
with her
33:10
[Laughter]
33:13
well we don't really know because people
33:15
don't really know much about sharks
33:17
especially before they're born
33:19
but this is quite a recent study by
33:21
kiyomi murakama
33:25
who developed an underwater ultrasound
33:28
machine and have been able to look at
33:30
what's happening inside the body of a
33:33
tawny nurse shark
33:35
as she has some embryos and this and
33:38
they found this out there's a few other
33:39
things they found out that the um
33:42
so sharks have two uteruses and the
33:44
sharks like to swim between the uteri
33:47
uh and eat on the fertilized eggs yeah
33:51
that unfertilized brothers and sisters
33:52
that's the thing that happens that's so
33:54
cool they're practicing they're doing
33:55
their length before they come out of the
33:56
womb which is super cool and it sounds
33:59
quite arduous because there's quite a
34:01
thin tube isn't there connecting them
34:03
are you connecting the two uterine they
34:04
squirm their way through it swimming
34:06
between two different bits of the womb
34:09
just to eat your
34:10
yeah eat some eggs would-be siblings and
34:12
they kind of there's always more than
34:14
one shark i think they give birth
34:16
usually to three or four and so
34:18
sometimes all of the sharks will be in
34:20
one of the uteruses eating all of the
34:22
eggs and then they'll all migrate to the
34:24
other uterus and then eat all the eggs
34:25
there and do they eat each other is that
34:27
a different species it's a different
34:28
species
34:29
these guys might do as well for all i
34:31
know but that's um sand sharks yeah uh
34:35
yeah um i guess that's the thing though
34:37
like you might be looking out the cervix
34:40
just thinking is this another room
34:41
inside mum and going and just because
34:44
you've already you've already found one
34:45
how do you know mine's massive exactly
34:48
um sharks and eggs are really quite
34:50
clever
34:52
so they recently discovered that they
34:54
can react really well to predators even
34:56
so sharks laid an egg and it's sitting
34:57
there and they've done ultrasound and
34:59
they found out that if there's even so
35:01
much as a vibration nearby or if
35:03
something walks nearby that's emitting
35:05
slight electromagnetic radiation then
35:07
the embryo inside senses it and it
35:10
completely freezes and it holds its
35:12
breath because it knows if it's even
35:14
moving its gills then it's going to be
35:15
giving off an electrical signal that the
35:17
thing might be able to sense so even in
35:19
the egg that's very cool you can be
35:20
scared yeah wow
35:24
sharks
35:26
they have
35:27
they have teeth
35:30
and they have different teeth all the
35:31
time so we've got baby teeth and adult
35:33
teeth but they shed their teeth
35:35
throughout their whole life but this
35:36
actually starts before they're even born
35:39
so they have teeth in the womb embryonic
35:42
teeth
35:42
and they lose those and they get malty
35:44
so they like they lose their baby teeth
35:46
before they're even babies so does the
35:48
mother shark have a load of loose teeth
35:50
rattling around in her womb well it
35:51
seems like it might be that that might
35:53
be true and also that this might have
35:56
thrown like previous studies into um
35:59
disrepute because
36:00
embryonic teeth of great white sharks
36:02
are almost identical to adult teeth of
36:05
sand tiger sharks
36:06
so a lot of things that they thought
36:08
were sand tiger sharks turn out to might
36:10
turn out to be embryos of great white
36:12
sharks it's such a having to check
36:14
through them all now wow it's such a
36:16
niche crisis in the atlantic studies
36:19
world
36:22
but yeah they have shots that have up to
36:23
50 000 teeth in their life some of them
36:25
shed teeth once a week which just must
36:28
mean they are loaded tooth very well
36:31
although i don't know where she'd leave
36:32
it
36:33
the money on the seabed on the seabed
36:38
lovely very nice um
36:40
so we do know so little about
36:43
birthing of shark for example a great
36:44
white shark we've never seen one be born
36:47
ever yeah it's amazing we've somehow
36:49
just not managed to see that um
36:51
and uh so
36:53
occasionally aquariums and other such
36:55
places studying um these sharks get
36:58
insight into ways that they give birth
36:59
and new zealand and aquariums are an
37:01
amazing thing where there was a shark
37:03
that was giving birth but was having
37:04
problem with the birthing process so
37:06
another shark came up and bit its
37:07
abdomen
37:09
and in the process allowed it was
37:11
basically a c-section gave it a
37:12
c-section and the little sharks were
37:14
able to swim out and both the baby
37:16
sharks and the mother shark survived the
37:18
incident yes it was just they were just
37:20
witnessing some sort of bizarre
37:22
technique wait a bit another shot bit
37:24
the abdomen open yeah so that things
37:27
could escape that is extraordinary
37:28
that's weird
37:29
i also can't believe they can do it well
37:31
enough that the shark survived you would
37:33
have thought if you're tearing open the
37:34
abdomen of a shark to let its babies out
37:35
yeah and they didn't they didn't even
37:37
know that the shark was pregnant as well
37:39
so that was a huge surprise they just
37:40
thought another shark was eating a shark
37:42
and then suddenly they were just could
37:44
it be that they were just eating the
37:45
shark and it just so happened that there
37:46
was some babies in there that is
37:48
possible yeah yeah so sharks can have
37:50
virgin births even if they are not
37:52
virgins
37:54
no they can't they can but isn't that by
37:57
definition that impossible not a virgin
37:59
birth so
38:00
it's like the virgin mary depends how
38:01
you define a virgin birth
38:03
but in 2017 there was a leopard shark in
38:05
australia which had previously mated
38:07
with a male and then i think they said
38:09
oh we don't actually want any more
38:10
sharks to be born so they moved her into
38:12
her own bit of the aquarium and then she
38:14
kept laying eggs like a chicken
38:18
she laid the eggs like a chicken yeah
38:20
like she was clicking
38:22
she waggled her fins around
38:24
um no she laid these eggs just you know
38:26
non-fertile fertile legs as they thought
38:28
right got it but then some of them
38:29
started hatching so these were uh
38:33
clones basically of herself which she
38:36
sort of switched from a sexual into an
38:38
asexual mode that's never been observed
38:40
before wow that's weird it's a fresh
38:42
excuse for sorry my boyfriend climbed
38:44
into my bedroom in the middle of the
38:45
night and i didn't tell you isn't it
38:47
asexual reproduction i don't know how
38:49
it's happened
38:51
um so
38:53
that can i talk about baby shark the
38:54
song yeah you've been waiting
38:57
so patiently well it's just because you
38:59
say that they can have virgin birth so
39:01
that means that there's no daddy shark
39:03
first of all okay
39:04
um and i've been on the famous hawking
39:07
link isn't it
39:09
so i tweeted this a while ago and today
39:12
when i was um googling baby sharks for
39:14
this podcast i found an article in the
39:16
sun from september last year saying baby
39:18
shark has been blasted over factual
39:21
inaccuracies by boffins on the internet
39:24
several twitter users have taken to the
39:25
site to point out the various ways that
39:27
earworm has got biology wrong podcaster
39:30
and qi researcher james harker
39:33
i had no idea that this this wasn't the
39:35
sun in september last year i had no idea
39:38
that they'd quote what did you point out
39:40
i posted pointed out two things one that
39:43
um sometimes there's no daddy shark
39:44
because they does it mention daddy
39:46
sharks yes in the song right it also
39:48
mentions um grandma shark
39:51
and since great white sharks don't reach
39:53
sexual maturity till their mid-thirties
39:55
and their maximum lifespan is around 70
39:57
you hardly ever get grandma sharks in
39:59
nature
40:01
and the sun picked it up james you
40:04
absolute boffin
40:06
i love it when you blast inaccuracies
40:11
ah you've made it to the sun i know what
40:13
an honor an official sun boffin
40:16
oh man that's huge
40:19
i just got one last thing just to
40:20
quickly mention uh in 2018 there was a
40:22
story which um i'm annoyed that i missed
40:25
for the book but it was a shark got well
40:28
someone attempted to steal a shark from
40:29
a san antonio aquarium in texas
40:32
um and they did so by simply just taking
40:34
it out of the water and dressing it as a
40:37
baby in a buggy
40:39
they did not dress it as a baby well
40:41
they put it in the buggy they just put
40:42
it in a bag but they pretended that they
40:45
were all built
40:46
as a baby yeah a buggy does not count as
40:48
baby clothes they dressed as a naked
40:50
baby
40:55
they had it wrapped in a blanket you'd
40:56
wrap a baby in a blanket
40:58
they put it in a bucket you put a baby
40:59
in a bucket
41:00
and then they put the bucket in the
41:02
buggy
41:03
how is fatherhood going down
41:07
anyway they're a challenge on the way
41:09
out so i don't think that's a baby
41:12
buggy looks fine bucket looks fine hang
41:14
on a second
41:18
[Music]
41:20

[Applause]
00:15
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:17
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:20
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:22
covent garden
00:23
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
00:24
here with anna chazinski andrew hunter
00:27
murray and james harkin
00:28
and once again we have gathered around
00:30
the microphones with our four favorite
00:31
facts from the last seven days
00:33
and in no particular order here we go
00:36
starting with you
00:37
james okay my fact this week is that the
00:39
emperor of the incas
00:41
only ever wore an outfit once after
00:44
which it was immediately
00:45
burned i do that
00:49
yeah why are you wearing the same jumper
00:50
as you've won for the last three weeks
00:51
no i've worn
00:52
21 different jumpers
00:57
so this was the he was called sappa inca
01:00
and um he wore clothes special clothes
01:03
that no one else was allowed to work is
01:04
there a theory as to why he couldn't
01:06
wear them twice would we not know
01:07
we don't really know i think it's just
01:09
because he's so important and it's the
01:11
ostentatious show of wealth
01:12
isn't it uh and his um clothes were seen
01:15
as divine because he was seen as divine
01:18
it is a bit like the duchess of
01:19
cambridge who does she
01:21
if she reuses an outfit the newspapers
01:23
say oh she's recycling her clothes
01:26
as opposed to only wearing everything
01:27
once do you think they burn it after she
01:29
uses them
01:30
maybe maybe the ones you really like she
01:32
squirrels away so she can wear them
01:33
again
01:34
i don't know is that how did they record
01:36
their information the incas yeah so that
01:38
is
01:39
uh interesting unlike a lot of the
01:40
mesoamericans who we don't really have
01:42
any information apart from
01:44
like ceramics or or cloths or textiles
01:47
we have a bit about the incans because
01:48
they did talk to the spanish
01:50
they were the last mesoamericans that
01:52
were there before the spanish wiped them
01:54
out i didn't quite wipe them out but
01:55
basically a lot of them died so we know
01:58
what they did by what the spanish said
02:00
although it should be said that the
02:01
spanish did lie a lot
02:03
because yeah why wouldn't you they
02:05
defeated exactly exactly
02:06
so maybe this is not true but um so when
02:09
spanish came actually it was
02:11
an extraordinary thing that happened
02:13
first of all so it was 1532
02:15
and it was the conquistador francisco
02:17
pizarro
02:18
and he turned up and it was a surprise
02:20
attack that he launched
02:22
on the inca that sounds a bit like a
02:24
surprise party when you put it like that
02:25
doesn't it
02:26
surprise have some smallpox
02:30
have loads of murder um but
02:33
he according to the spanish records they
02:35
killed 7 000
02:37
inca without themselves having one
02:39
single fatality
02:40
no which you can't believe would
02:42
actually be true but that is what was
02:43
recorded
02:44
but the amazing thing about this is that
02:47
we can study
02:48
exactly what happened and the influence
02:50
of the spanish
02:51
by looking at this one glacier so we've
02:54
talked about this kind of thing before
02:55
but there's this glacier which is 150
02:57
miles away from where pizarro landed
02:59
it's called the kelkya ice cap and it's
03:02
the largest ice crab in icecap in the
03:03
tropics
03:04
and what it does is because south
03:06
america has wet and dry seasons
03:07
then a layer of dust forms every year in
03:10
the dry season
03:11
and so we know exactly which year it is
03:13
by looking down in the ice caps like
03:14
tree rings
03:15
exactly like tree rings and so they've
03:16
studied this ice cap to see what the
03:18
influence of the spanish was so the
03:20
spanish came and they started doing
03:21
metallurgy
03:22
and so it's got lots more kind of
03:24
metallurgy deposits various
03:26
different types of metal deposits in it
03:27
when the revolution started the
03:29
independence revolution suddenly a lot
03:30
of
03:31
mines were decommissioned and so the
03:32
pollution levels in it go down
03:34
which show you that and you can just
03:35
drill straight through this ice cap and
03:37
you've got this like year by year
03:39
calendar another thing we can look at is
03:41
um
03:42
llama poo and that will tell us what
03:45
happened with the incas
03:46
because basically their culture um
03:50
moved around maize uh which was the main
03:52
crop a few other things like potatoes
03:54
and stuff but
03:54
maze is one of the main ones um maize
03:56
pollen um comes in so you can look at
03:58
that but at the same time
04:00
you can find a lot of mites in the
04:02
ground uh dead mites
04:03
uh which feed on llama excrement and you
04:06
can work out by the number of these
04:08
mites
04:09
and the amount of maize pollen exactly
04:11
how big and small the incan empire was
04:14
kind of the super fuel the llama done
04:17
because
04:17
you you know you need to farm more
04:19
intensively and there was a big switch
04:21
uh to maize um about two thousand seven
04:24
hundred years ago and the way they found
04:25
it so cool because they
04:27
they studied what i didn't know this was
04:28
a thing i studied what's called mud
04:30
cause in a lake
04:31
so it's like an ice core you but it's
04:33
made of mud um
04:35
yeah and it was also it's really easy
04:36
for the anchors because llamas defecate
04:38
uh communally you know they have one
04:40
toilet not that all llamas go to
04:43
but that you know all the llamas they
04:45
live it's a big country
04:47
country yeah um so yeah and that was
04:49
what made it possible to grow huge maze
04:51
fields because it's much richer they
04:52
wouldn't have done it without
04:53
um that fertilizer oh wow yeah they were
04:56
very into llamas weren't they they
04:57
relied on them massively
04:58
little llamas into maize yeah potatoes
05:01
not into the wheel needed the llamas
05:03
because they didn't have wheels
05:05
so because they didn't have carts that
05:07
could be pulled like massive long
05:08
distances
05:09
they instead have this incredible system
05:10
of chaskis
05:12
and probably not how you pronounce it
05:14
but who knows how anchors pronounce
05:15
things
05:15
um and chaski's um chaskis were relay
05:19
runners
05:20
so they were totally crucial to the
05:22
whole incan empire they were exempt from
05:23
things like farming and taxation because
05:25
they were so important
05:26
and their whole job was to deliver
05:27
messages and parcels and
05:29
equipment through the empire and so they
05:32
would run
05:32
a short space like they'd run ten
05:35
kilometers and they'd pass a message on
05:36
to the next person
05:37
they had to memorize the entire message
05:39
perfectly so it was like chinese
05:40
whispers
05:41
something they weren't holding a message
05:43
no okay i was wondering if that's why
05:45
our empire wasn't so big because we
05:47
could never get a relay team that can
05:48
get that
05:51
you just keep dropping it so the inca
05:53
obviously they were taken out and
05:55
there are no longer any sappers but
05:57
there is a descendant of a sapper inca
05:59
or the inca emperor uh who is still in
06:02
power to this day
06:03
wow so it's a long descendant it's the
06:05
last inca emperor called
06:07
hijuana kapec his descendant is the
06:10
current president of chile
06:12
yeah it's a direct descendant his name
06:14
is miguel pinera
06:16
and he um he's actually serving for the
06:18
second time as president
06:19
which is a new rule they've never
06:20
allowed that before and he's a
06:22
billionaire so he's still
06:24
this super rich so he could afford to
06:26
burn his clothes after every time
06:28
wow he's worth two billion pounds um the
06:31
last
06:32
inca sapper
06:42
[Laughter]
06:44
he was called tupac amaru and he was
06:47
killed by the spanish but then there was
06:49
an insurgency in the 18th century
06:51
and another person um who wasn't related
06:54
at all called themselves tupac
06:56
after this guy and then tupac shakur his
06:59
mother i think
07:00
named him after this insurgent
07:03
wow very interesting very cool
07:07
the kings they would go to the
07:10
coronations of their descendants
07:12
so their mummies would be at the
07:14
coronation because they were really
07:16
important still they were reminding the
07:17
new king that he descended from a long
07:19
line of kings
07:20
and also they would stay powerful after
07:22
they died because the royal family would
07:24
visit
07:25
the mummified kings and ask their advice
07:27
about stuff
07:28
and then an oracle sitting next to them
07:30
would uh what did you say
07:32
a bit like matthew carpet and city
07:34
exactly
07:38
what a show that would have been
07:41
there's quite a few of the incas because
07:42
they've got documents of the lines of
07:45
the names that are associated with those
07:47
sapper and quite a few of them are
07:49
mythical and then suddenly they just
07:50
become real
07:51
people always do that yeah it's like
07:52
japanese emperors as well yeah
07:54
this is the problem with not writing
07:55
stuff down because it's an oral history
07:57
isn't it or they did have this system of
07:59
uh
07:59
kuipu or kippu which is these um rods
08:02
that had lots of threads with knots
08:04
tied into them hanging from them which
08:06
was some really complex language that we
08:07
don't understand
08:08
so all we know is through oral history
08:10
which is always going to be entangled i
08:12
suppose with myth
08:13
yeah do we still not know what those
08:14
knots we're getting close
08:16
wow yeah that's so cool we're getting
08:18
close maybe in our life to maybe in the
08:20
next five or ten years they'll work it
08:21
out we think
08:22
possibly yeah that's so cool what are
08:24
they missing are they missing like a not
08:26
rosetta stone yes they are but they've
08:28
found one which is
08:29
um some record keeping where they it's
08:32
in spanish and also in kipu and they
08:34
think that they might have the names of
08:35
some emperors now and they're getting
08:37
getting pretty close very cool do you
08:40
know where machu picchu is twinned with
08:44
well i've been to my two pizza it's at
08:46
the top of a massive hill that's really
08:47
hard to get to
08:48
so is it a high gate oh okay
08:52
nice it is not though it is the
08:54
yorkshire village of hayworth
08:56
oh yep that's a big big deal they had a
08:58
ceremony in 2005 and they've been with
09:00
the great
09:01
inca city of machu picchu what is that
09:03
doing the connection yeah do we know
09:05
anything else about
09:07
from hayworth uh the brontes were from
09:09
there did they go
09:10
okay were they explorers uh they they
09:12
have nothing to do with
09:13
machu picchu i was reading the ceremony
09:15
i think they just wanted to inspire an
09:16
interest in sort of peruvian history in
09:18
some school children but i have no doubt
09:20
machu picchu has no idea
09:22
it's twinned with haters yeah it doesn't
09:23
have a sign as you enter machu picchu
09:25
james
09:25
it says twin would take now you've seen
09:27
machu picchu
09:28
is it sorry i thought brontes were from
09:31
howarth
09:32
but is it not that oh is that how you
09:34
pronounce it oh i don't know actually oh
09:36
is it h-a-w yeah yeah it's probably
09:38
howarth i don't know someone from
09:39
yorkshire writing
09:41
everyone from yorkshire i don't think
09:43
they've learned to write have they oh no
09:45
that's the incas
09:46
sorry maybe that's what connects them
09:49
[Laughter]
09:52
they are going to write it down um i've
09:55
i don't know how to do frankie stuff
09:57
i've got a fact about ritual burning
09:58
great
10:00
in 2017 pakistan's minister of tourism
10:03
fedor khan was so annoyed about his
10:05
flight being delayed
10:06
that he took his clothes out of his
10:08
luggage and started setting them on fire
10:11
it's only going to delay the flight more
10:13
really isn't it if you start a fire in
10:14
the airport
10:15
unless they say oh my god there's a fire
10:17
everyone get out of here you get on that
10:19
plane
10:20
yeah yeah it's the quickest way out
10:22
didn't you find a weird
10:23
that when you you know when you see
10:25
people wearing these amazing expensive
10:27
clothes on the
10:27
red carpet and they don't own any of
10:30
them it's actually kind of like all
10:31
these celebrities
10:32
are um you know when you are struggling
10:35
financially
10:36
early twenties you sort of hire stuff
10:38
and then you have to send it back
10:38
otherwise it accrues interest
10:40
they're basically those people they're
10:41
poor early twenties students or they're
10:43
good
10:44
they're going to topshop and then
10:45
getting it and then wearing it once and
10:47
then taking them back saying
10:48
no no i never wore it i never wore it
10:50
you think the day after the oscars is
10:51
just the cue with jennifer lawrence
10:54
yeah i go oh man they aren't really
10:57
strict it has to be within one to two
10:58
days always
10:59
i was reading about um just while we're
11:00
in america and the sort of
11:02
rich elite there uh russell westbrook
11:04
who is a basketball player
11:06
um who you guys won't know but in
11:07
america he's one of the biggest names in
11:09
basketball
11:09
and he's very famous for his flashy
11:11
outfits and he is someone
11:13
who has said he said this on ellen
11:14
degeneres's show he never wears the same
11:17
clothes twice
11:17
but he says he doesn't waste them he
11:19
donates the you know doesn't burn them
11:20
he donates them to goodwill
11:22
uh charities and as a result he says
11:24
when he walks through or he's in a car
11:25
going through oklahoma city
11:27
he just sees everyone wearing his
11:29
clothes he's just like
11:30
everyone the same size in oklahoma as a
11:33
basketball player
11:36
he just got loads of people with clothes
11:38
like they've been given by their older
11:40
brothers
11:44
no one can pick anything up because
11:45
their sleeves are too long
11:56
it is time for fact number two and that
11:58
is anna
11:59
i've changed the number on my fact by
12:01
the way so don't freak out when i say it
12:04
my fact this week is that about 70
12:08
percent
12:16
my fact this week is that about 70 of
12:19
parents admit to having
12:20
a favorite child uh yeah
12:23
this they and they do have favorite
12:25
children i've got a favorite one
12:27
you've only got one yeah if it's not
12:28
that it's not mine
12:30
which is your favorite i met this
12:32
awesome kid at the playground when wolf
12:34
and i were there
12:35
it's called jeff wicked
12:40
right so about 17 percent of parents are
12:42
as bad as dan is at parenting
12:44
and prefer certain kids and this is i
12:46
was going through a bunch of kind of
12:47
studies that have been done over the
12:49
years
12:49
they often are into parenting and that
12:52
seems to be roughly the average so there
12:53
was a study in 2016
12:55
that asked parents and 74 of mothers and
12:58
70
12:58
of fathers admitted to having a favorite
13:00
i was in california
13:01
there was another one 10 years earlier
13:03
where it was 70 of fathers but 65
13:05
percent of mothers
13:06
so it seems like mothers have really
13:07
gone off their kids in the last decade
13:10
and yet this keeps on coming up again
13:12
and again they if it's an in-depth study
13:14
they will sort of reluctantly admit that
13:15
they do have a favorite child
13:17
and also studies that look at the
13:18
behavior of parents towards their
13:20
children invariably find that they
13:21
prefer
13:22
certain children's in the way they act
13:24
is that right so i just i'm
13:26
texted my mum this morning because i
13:29
have three brothers and sisters and
13:31
asked if she had a favorite
13:33
and she didn't say she didn't say the
13:35
way
13:36
which suggests to me that she does and
13:38
i'm not it
13:40
with a one in four chance though that's
13:41
something yeah i'm pretty sure i'm not
13:43
even her favorite on this podcast
13:45
wait hang on are you the youngest i'm
13:47
the eldest well that damages your
13:49
chances
13:50
because there have been studies done
13:51
finding that half of parents to
13:53
confess who confessed they had a
13:55
favorite said that it was their last
13:57
born
13:58
and there's another theory about why
14:00
it's the last born which is that
14:02
uh more than half of parents and
14:03
grandparents said that the the last born
14:05
child
14:05
made them laugh more so there was an
14:08
australian news website which said so if
14:10
you aren't the favorite you might just
14:11
not be very funny
14:14
and that was written by my mom
14:18
but the good news is kids are really bad
14:20
at knowing which one the favorite is
14:22
so it shouldn't make you feel too bad
14:23
yeah they
14:25
again in these studies when they look at
14:26
who the children think is their favorite
14:28
and who their parents
14:29
favor actually is it's really often
14:31
different so there was a survey which
14:33
was it was only 30
14:34
older mothers and they were asked about
14:36
their adult children and 80
14:38
of those mothers admitted to having a
14:39
favorite and 80 of the children said
14:41
their parents definitely had a favorite
14:43
but almost all of them got the favorite
14:44
wrong wow so maybe parents are
14:46
overcompensating so in fact it doesn't
14:48
really matter
14:49
if you're the favorite or not because if
14:51
you are the favorite you will be treated
14:53
better but you won't know it and if
14:54
you're not the favorite
14:55
they'll make up for it by pretending to
14:57
treat you better so it doesn't matter
14:58
they don't really like you
14:59
exactly they're not going to show it how
15:01
blatant would a parent make it though
15:03
what the you wouldn't give one child
15:06
loads of presents at christmas and the
15:07
other
15:08
no presents it's not like cinderella or
15:10
harry potter or something
15:11
um does your child cry much dan no not
15:14
too much
15:14
oh really um because a lot of children
15:16
do i've read
15:18
and according to
15:21
evolutionary biologist david hague this
15:24
might be
15:24
to stop their parents from procreating
15:27
and having another baby
15:29
which kind of makes sense if you think
15:30
about it evolutionary doesn't it yeah i
15:32
read about this this was
15:33
they do it at night particularly right
15:35
the idea of like
15:36
late nurse feeding from the mum so that
15:39
if you were
15:40
about to go okay let's let's get down uh
15:43
your baby would stop you yeah and the
15:45
idea is that the baby then gets more
15:46
resources because it doesn't have to
15:48
share with brothers or brothers and
15:50
sisters
15:50
which means in theory they should do
15:53
better in life which means they should
15:54
reproduce more and then wow but doesn't
15:57
also breastfeeding act as a
15:59
contraceptive
16:00
so if you're exclusively breastfeeding
16:02
as a woman you tend not to have periods
16:04
is that right meaning that you can't
16:05
become pregnant right so the more the
16:07
child cries
16:08
and wants breastfeeding the less chance
16:11
there is that another child will be born
16:12
wow so it's working double efforts yeah
16:16
stopping the actual sex and then even if
16:18
the actual sex is happening
16:19
it's still acting as a like a human
16:21
contraceptive
16:22
problem is it it's obviously not working
16:24
is it so these genius babies
16:26
are failing they're doing the best they
16:28
can
16:29
maybe in another million years they'll
16:31
evolve to you know
16:32
make chastity belts
16:37
one of you was saying that parents don't
16:38
tend to just favor one kid with loads of
16:40
presents but
16:41
there was one parent who literally did
16:44
exactly that so do you guys know about
16:45
evil in war's dad
16:46
no no so even we had an older brother
16:49
called alec
16:50
and his dad absolutely loved alec and
16:53
absolutely hated evil in war so all the
16:54
way through their life
16:55
if evil wanted anything his dad got it
16:57
for his brother so even ask for a bike
16:59
uh his dad bought one for alec instead
17:01
alec once asked for a billiards table
17:03
and so even more had was a child at the
17:05
time he played in his nursery and the
17:06
dad just dumped a billiards table in
17:08
this room that he was supposed to play
17:09
in
17:10
um he once said when alec fathered his
17:12
first son
17:13
then evelyn war's dad said to the son
17:16
i've only ever loved three people in my
17:19
life or only i've only ever had three
17:20
great loves in my life
17:22
and my mother my wife and your father
17:25
and that was it
17:26
for old eveline but evelyn war was also
17:29
mean to his children wasn't he yes we've
17:32
we've done the banana story before
17:34
haven't we
17:35
which is that uh there was lots of
17:37
rationing in the war and
17:38
even more had children and there was a
17:40
special thing where
17:42
bananas were distributed because they
17:43
they had not been easy to come by during
17:45
the war and so
17:46
uh you know you would get basically a
17:48
banana per child and even wall sat his
17:50
three children down in front of him and
17:51
proceeded to
17:52
eat all three bananas
17:55
i think with a knife and he poured cream
17:57
over them and just sat there
18:01
so did he just hate them or uh
18:04
that must maybe he was teaching them
18:05
some lesson that we can't quite
18:06
comprehend at this
18:07
amount of time it can't be how to eat a
18:09
banana
18:11
with a knife
18:15
i have a test question for you guys yes
18:18
the company kellogg's who's it named
18:19
after john kellogg
18:22
john kellogg john kellogg
18:25
incorrect john harvey kellogg is the guy
18:28
that we've talked about before
18:30
he uh he was sort of an inventor he
18:32
thought everyone had to eat um oats and
18:34
stop masturbating stuff like that
18:38
again only two rules at kellogg academy
18:43
so he's a famous one i think that people
18:45
know about john harvey kellogg yeah
18:47
but kellogg's cornflakes and kellogg's
18:49
company was founded invented and named
18:51
after his brother
18:52
and so he john so john harvey kellogg
18:55
had a younger brother called will
18:57
and john was this really flamboyant
18:59
really outgoing character
19:03
and i hate it they were polar opposites
19:09
they were opposites although i don't
19:10
know about that
19:12
around the dinner table one of them's
19:14
got a big bowl of oats
19:19
not near my cereal
19:24
anyway we kept this back on track it's
19:27
actually quite a serious
19:28
rivalry oh my god
19:32
um will was opposite of john harvey not
19:35
very flamboyant like hardly said
19:36
anything
19:37
super shy was younger he worked for his
19:39
older brother for 25 years so at that
19:41
sanitarian that he founded battle creek
19:43
spa
19:44
um where he did like real dog's body
19:46
stuff john harvey
19:48
treated him really badly and made him do
19:50
all the drudge work uh made him shine
19:52
his shoes and stuff
19:53
never gave him an official job title
19:55
hardly paid him anything
19:56
and eventually uh we'll turn around and
19:58
thought i'm the better businessman i'm
20:00
gonna set up
20:01
kellogg's company invent some cornflakes
20:02
and he did it so he set up this conflict
20:05
company in 1906
20:06
and it had a promotional campaign where
20:09
the slogan was
20:10
wink at your grocer and see what you get
20:13
that's a spelling mistake
20:18
and he got a bowl of cornflakes
20:26
okay it is time for fact number three
20:28
and that is
20:29
andy my fact is that robert louis
20:31
stevenson died halfway through making a
20:33
batch of mayonnaise
20:36
it's very sad it's very sad because he
20:38
was young he was only 44.
20:40
it is it's so sad it just makes me sad
20:42
that also that batch of mayonnaise i
20:44
suppose never got finished presumably oh
20:45
that's the real tragedy
20:49
also how long does it take to make
20:50
mayonnaise it takes me about two and a
20:52
half minutes
20:53
well it was a very sudden death um
20:56
no i i think he was dropping the oil in
20:58
drop by drop i might have been a longer
21:00
food processor i don't think he did no
21:02
especially not in samoa where he lived
21:04
so yeah yeah his um just very quickly
21:07
saying an
21:07
early death um people when the news got
21:10
relayed because he was in samoa
21:11
uh back home people weren't properly
21:14
devastated
21:15
famous authors like um henry james
21:17
actually flat out denied that it was
21:19
true you just thought wow this can't be
21:21
right
21:21
um and rudyard kipling said he was so
21:24
upset he couldn't write for a month he
21:25
was just
21:26
absolutely broken by it um yeah
21:29
big big character in his time yeah yeah
21:32
but about this mayonnaise
21:34
yeah sorry you are supposed to add the
21:38
oil slowly
21:39
uh okay so yeah that's what he was doing
21:41
and he yeah he just he took ill halfway
21:42
through making the mayonnaise and then
21:44
he sort of collapsed and then he died it
21:46
was very very sad he was a sickly being
21:47
wasn't he
21:48
he was so ill and weak all the way
21:50
through his life it's amazing
21:51
he wrote as much as he did and yeah yeah
21:54
well the idea was that some people said
21:56
he wrote quicker than anyone else
21:57
because he
21:58
knew he'd had these hemorrhages and he'd
22:00
been sick and so because he knew his
22:01
life would be short he felt like he had
22:03
to just get
22:04
get as much out as possible that's
22:05
interesting wow yeah yeah
22:08
um just back to mayonnaise
22:09
[Laughter]
22:14
um well i was just looking into because
22:16
he was in samoa
22:17
and he was eating mayonnaise and i
22:19
thought i wonder if that's do they eat
22:20
mayonnaise and samoa
22:22
turns out they love it do they yeah i
22:24
found a facebook page called samoan
22:26
quotes and sayings
22:27
and um there's one quote which is if you
22:30
eat everything with mayo you might be a
22:31
samoan
22:32
hashtag samoan habits and yeah
22:35
apparently it's it's a
22:36
very very loved uh source though really
22:40
anyway back to it um so robert when he
22:42
was in samar
22:43
one thing that robert lee stevenson did
22:45
which is very sweet was that he gave his
22:47
birthday to a child
22:49
he was born on the 13th of november and
22:51
he bumped into a little girl
22:52
who was called annie eid a daughter of a
22:55
friend of his
22:55
and she was born on christmas day and so
22:57
she said oh i never get a proper fuss
22:59
made of me on
22:59
christmas day so he drew up a proper
23:02
legal document what kind of pseudo-legal
23:04
document which he said i bequeath you my
23:06
birthday
23:07
that's called so was she one year older
23:09
than she thought she was at the end
23:11
oh i don't know i don't have a year
23:13
older aged
23:14
herself because he was born on the 13th
23:16
of november so it's not
23:17
too much so just a month yeah you're
23:19
still in that category of birthday
23:21
present christmas present
23:22
annoyance so i was reading he wrote such
23:25
a sweet letter to her
23:26
and he put it all in legalese because he
23:28
trained to be a lawyer and so
23:30
it started out saying i trust this will
23:31
prove sufficient in law
23:33
and ex you know explain why he was doing
23:35
he said i've attained an age where we
23:37
never mention our age anymore because
23:39
it's so old so i have no further use for
23:40
my birthday
23:41
but i remember discussing this before
23:43
and it being in november but at the end
23:44
of this letter it said his birthday was
23:46
the 19th of june
23:49
gave a fake birthday has he given her a
23:51
fake birthday
23:52
i guess so because actually maybe he was
23:54
thoughtful
23:55
yeah and he felt like honestly that
23:56
november date's no good i'm going to
23:58
pretend it's june because i mean it's
23:59
all pretend it's all made up isn't it
24:00
yeah
24:01
yeah birthdays aren't made up are real
24:05
right but lots of his interactions were
24:07
with um
24:08
lots of his significant interactions
24:09
with children so supposedly he only
24:11
started writing treasure island
24:13
when he met a small boy who repeatedly
24:15
asked him why he didn't write something
24:17
interesting like robinson crusoe
24:19
wow i think he was already an
24:20
interesting writer i like
24:22
i like his stuff but uh yeah you're like
24:24
you don't agree with that little child
24:26
no you think his previous stuff was a
24:28
fool
24:29
well i think that was i mean that's
24:31
what's made him in the end isn't it
24:33
that's the main thing that everyone
24:34
knows him for
24:35
it is but there is one claim that he
24:37
invented the sleeping bag
24:41
so that should be the biggie i don't
24:44
think
24:44
he did invent the sleeping bag but he
24:46
commissioned one of the very early
24:48
sleeping bags or invented a kind of
24:50
prototype version of it
24:51
because he was traveling solo through
24:53
the seven mountains in france with only
24:55
a donkey
24:56
and that was research for his book
24:58
travels with a donkey in the seven
25:00
an imaginative title
25:01
[Laughter]
25:05
and the donkey was called modestine and
25:08
he was really rude about the donkey he
25:09
said oh yeah the donkey held me up i
25:10
would have done it faster if it hadn't
25:12
been for this donkey which just carrying
25:13
all my stuff in my sleeping bag
25:15
yeah when robert louis stevenson had a
25:18
birthday in samoa he was very popular
25:20
there
25:20
they celebrated by consuming 804
25:23
pineapples
25:24
sorry can i interject here yeah what the
25:26
was he doing celebrating his
25:28
birthday in summer when he's giving it
25:29
away to a girl
25:31
on the side going uh excuse me
25:33
[Laughter]
25:34
put those pineapples away that was his
25:36
fault birthday so it must have been
25:39
after that terrible behavior 800
25:42
pineapples that's amazing that's a lot
25:43
it's a lot i mean i don't know how many
25:45
people there were enjoying those
25:46
pineapples there might have been 900
25:48
people in 100 people went hungry
25:52
his wife was called fanny van de grift
25:54
osborne
25:56
is that a great name yeah yeah and one
25:57
of the early women he fell in love with
25:59
was called fanny sitwell didn't he had a
26:02
thing about
26:03
fanny he loved fannie's their story was
26:06
quite
26:07
sweet actually because she was uh
26:09
married to this guy in america
26:10
and he sent her to get their kids
26:12
educated in paris
26:14
and that was where she fell in love with
26:15
robert louis stevenson and so
26:17
she popped off back to new york got a
26:19
divorce from this husband of hers
26:21
and said i fall in love with someone
26:22
else and then her and stevenson got
26:24
married straight away and her ex-husband
26:26
came to the wedding
26:27
with his new girlfriend yeah oh wow
26:30
that is quite very mature i think very
26:32
mature um
26:33
just we've been talking treasure island
26:35
but the other big big work
26:37
outside of travels with my donkey
26:41
is of course jacqueline hyde um and
26:44
that's that's really interesting
26:45
jacqueline hyde he wrote a first version
26:48
of the book
26:48
and um hated it absolutely hated it so
26:51
threw it in the fire
26:52
and burns it and then he rewrote the
26:54
whole book in the space of i think a
26:56
weekend it was like 30 hours that he
26:58
sat and and he managed to to bring it
27:01
out he was quite bad at spelling that
27:03
was noticed in the drafts of that
27:05
um but jekyll and hyde there's a few
27:06
interesting facts about it
27:08
uh the first one is we're all saying it
27:09
wrong it's g-kill
27:14
if you were pronouncing it pronouncing
27:16
it as j-e-e and then
27:18
kill g-kill
27:24
he said let the name be present
27:25
pronounced as it is
27:27
killed not jekyll it's not spelled g
27:30
kill he's a bad speller we've already
27:31
established
27:33
but it sounds quite scottish doesn't it
27:34
because he was scottish you know
27:37
and do we know how to pronounce hyde um
27:40
he'd
27:41
no i think it's probably hyde um he did
27:44
lead quite
27:44
uh roberto stevenson did lead a kind of
27:47
almost jekyll and heidi life in some
27:49
ways so
27:50
first of all he created an alternative
27:52
character for himself
27:53
and this is when he was in edinburgh and
27:55
he loved doing really absurd things for
27:57
the sake of it and him and his cousin
27:58
would
27:59
play pranks on everyone and they called
28:00
them jinx and
28:02
he created this character called john
28:04
libel who sort of haunted edinburgh
28:07
in all these different ways and so for
28:09
instance he
28:10
had hundreds or thousands of calling
28:12
cards for john libel printed off and he
28:14
went around edinburgh handing them round
28:16
to everyone so you must get in touch
28:17
with this person oh god that sounds very
28:19
familiar from the edinburgh festival
28:23
i'll be in the voodoo rooms at 3 p.m
28:25
every day
28:28
he used to go into hotels or boarding
28:30
houses all over the city and say
28:31
has john libel arrived yet and they'd
28:33
say no he hasn't he said uh he will
28:35
and got around like who's this guy
28:39
um he dropped him he dropped into
28:40
conversation that he was an agent
28:42
looking for the person who's going to
28:43
inherit the liberal fortune
28:45
he tried to get an ad in the scotsman he
28:46
just created this guy that everyone was
28:48
talking about
28:48
that's really it does sound like a good
28:50
way to get noticed to edinburgh doesn't
28:52
it yeah it's not about it
28:53
it's a month before yeah i went to
28:55
hotels is andrew hunter here yet
28:58
no he will be
28:58
[Laughter]
29:05
okay it is time for our final fact of
29:08
the show and that is my fact
29:10
my fact this week is that in the 1960s
29:13
nasa helped to fund a scientific project
29:15
that aimed to teach dolphins to speak
29:17
the english language so perfectly
29:19
that they would be given a chair at the
29:21
united nations to speak on behalf of
29:23
marine mammals
29:25
obviously they wouldn't fit in a chair
29:26
you'd have to have some kind of tank set
29:28
up
29:28
that's true imagine a dolphin flopping
29:29
around in a chair you went think tank
29:32
[Laughter]
29:32
[Music]
29:36
so did it work uh it did not work but
29:39
the premise of it was quite interesting
29:41
it was a guy called dr john lilly
29:43
and he had the idea along with his wife
29:46
that
29:47
dolphins were talking through their
29:48
blowholes in a sort of specific noise
29:51
that suggested that perhaps that could
29:53
be manipulated
29:54
into human language and if they could
29:56
train these dolphins to talk that they
29:58
would be able to get
29:59
cross species communication going now
30:01
the reason nasa got involved
30:03
is because nasa thought let's see where
30:05
this goes if they get anywhere with this
30:07
this could be useful in the future
30:09
should we ever make alien contact the
30:10
idea of learning
30:11
some fundamental basics about that kind
30:13
of makes sense right because we don't
30:15
know that aliens will have the same kind
30:16
of language as us
30:17
yeah they could have the same kind of
30:19
kind of language as any animal so you
30:20
would learn that
30:21
yeah so this was set up in the 1960s and
30:24
when this funding was given nasa
30:26
um allowed with through its funding to
30:28
let john lilly set up this
30:29
kind of um really bizarre laboratory
30:32
where
30:33
they flooded an entire room with water
30:35
so that a dolphin called peter could
30:37
live in there
30:38
with this lady who uh was gonna
30:41
sit there for months and months on then
30:42
she had a mattress in the room she had a
30:44
desk that she could work at
30:46
was the mattress wet like and the was it
30:48
underwater the mattress no she had like
30:50
a platform she wasn't under water
30:51
herself
30:52
yeah sorry she was it was her who was
30:54
the instigator really of making the
30:55
experiment
30:56
that to that of making the experiment so
30:58
extensive that was margaret lovett right
31:00
who visited and she loved dolphins
31:02
already she visited this place
31:04
and she totally fell in love with these
31:06
three dolphins that were there
31:07
and the lab at the time was just one
31:09
tank and she said i want to see the
31:11
dolphin living
31:12
in this house in this full lab as if
31:13
it's its own house so she insisted it
31:15
was all flooded
31:16
and then she said i want to stay with it
31:17
24 7 so she can really get to understand
31:20
how it works so she could help with this
31:22
experiment and yeah then she erected
31:23
these
31:24
hanging platforms so she could sit
31:25
hanging from her swing desk it's very
31:27
shape of water isn't it
31:29
it is very shape of water that um those
31:32
platforms aren't the only thing she
31:33
erected
31:34
[Laughter]
31:35
because well anyway peter was a young
31:38
male dolphin and
31:39
and needed and was and uh i think
31:41
fancied her
31:42
basically yeah yeah i think um
31:45
quite famously dolphins do uh tend to
31:48
have a bit of a hump don't they when you
31:50
go swimming with them
31:51
you hear a lot of stories of celebrities
31:54
i must say i
31:54
i went swimming with dolphins once and i
31:57
attracted no attention whatsoever from
31:59
the dolphins
32:00
not a celebrity apparently it's only
32:04
celebrities celebrities
32:05
[Laughter]
32:07
insist on seeing your instagram
32:09
followers before maybe they're
32:11
whispering to the dolphin seriously it's
32:12
a very successful podcast
32:18
they all have a higher bar than that um
32:21
margaret used to do
32:22
it's interesting looking at the
32:23
techniques that they tried to um
32:26
teach the dolphins with one of the
32:27
techniques i thought was interesting was
32:29
um she
32:29
painted her face white she put a white
32:32
paint all over her face and then she
32:33
used black lipstick and the idea was
32:36
she wanted the dolphins to look directly
32:38
at her lips to see the
32:39
the way she was mouthing words so
32:46
i couldn't believe that the dolphins
32:47
were speaking through their blow holes
32:49
because i think if you think of dolphin
32:50
chatter as coming from their mouths
32:52
yeah and she said that
32:55
the one thing she wanted him to say
32:58
peter the dolphin to say
32:59
was her name he wanted her to say hello
33:01
margaret and she said that it's very
33:03
difficult to get a dolphin to make an
33:04
m sound with its blowhole and eventually
33:07
he rolled over and
33:08
kind of bubbled it through the water but
33:10
the dolphins could imitate humans we
33:12
should say that they were
33:13
able to imitate you know the pitch of
33:15
the voice and maybe even the frequency
33:17
too i think so
33:18
there was some progress but not
33:22
no a lot enough not enough yeah
33:25
and then it got a bit dodgy when he this
33:28
is john lily
33:29
um who set up the whole thing as we said
33:31
before started experimenting with
33:33
lsd he thought that the drugs would
33:35
actually help the dolphins in order to
33:38
understand language better and
33:39
communicate better open their minds up
33:41
maybe
33:41
um so he started injecting them with lsd
33:43
to try to
33:44
get that going is that right it was
33:46
interesting she wouldn't let him inject
33:48
peter but she couldn't stop him
33:50
injecting the other two but it didn't
33:51
really affect them did
33:52
it dolphins don't really well i guess we
33:54
don't know what visions they're saying
33:55
because they
33:55
still they kind of everything they could
33:58
see had an m in it so they just couldn't
34:00
he was just seeing m m's everywhere
34:01
[Laughter]
34:05
but then he got too into lsd didn't he
34:07
and ran away to experiment more with
34:08
that
34:09
yeah the project got abandoned and so on
34:11
so there is no marine mammal chair
34:14
at the united nations as a result and
34:16
then he did go into drugs
34:18
he decided that he would take a lot of
34:19
ketamine and go into sensory deprivation
34:22
tanks which is a bit stupid because
34:23
they're just full of water
34:25
uh and so on quite a few occasions his
34:27
wife had to save him from drowning
34:29
and at one stage um he said one evening
34:32
i took
34:33
milligrams of ketamine and suddenly the
34:35
earth coincident control
34:36
office who were some aliens that he
34:38
believed in removed my penis and handed
34:40
it to me
34:41
i screamed in terror my wife tony came
34:43
running in from the bedroom and she said
34:45
it's still attached so i shouted at the
34:48
ceiling who's in charge up there
34:49
a bunch of crazy kids i did not get to
34:53
that middle
34:53
school he sounds like a reliable man to
34:56
be doing science
34:59
so yeah i wonder how many times your
35:01
husband would have to take loads of
35:02
ketamine and get into a tank of water
35:04
before you didn't save him
35:06
i think on the time
35:09
especially if he hasn't got a penis
35:10
anymore what's the point
35:13
no willy lily they called him
35:19
um we are talking to dolphins now
35:22
better than they used to yeah so we've
35:24
got this thing called a chat which is a
35:26
certain hearing and telemetry device
35:28
and it's just been invented it's about
35:29
the same size as a toaster you wear it
35:31
on your chest
35:32
and all animals tell you you look like a
35:34
35:36
um no they've worked out how to
35:38
translate so you can teach dolphins to
35:41
recognize certain words they're clever
35:42
so you
35:43
teach them to recognize the human word
35:45
for seaweed and then
35:46
they make their own sound for that
35:48
seaweed so you know what so this machine
35:50
could work out what the dolphin
35:52
sound for seaweed is and then it can
35:54
translate that back to a human
35:55
so they have got dolphins now to say the
35:57
word seaweed into this machine it's
35:59
really good and actually if you think
36:00
about it
36:01
at the un they don't all speak english
36:03
do they they speak all sorts of
36:05
different languages and it gets
36:06
translated
36:09
but you could theoretically have a
36:10
dolphin at the u.n just i mean all he
36:13
can say is seaweed at the moment
36:14
you would you would shove one of those
36:16
earpieces in its blowhole i guess
36:18
yeah yeah so you'd have to breathe
36:20
sometimes and then
36:21
well you have to take turns to breathe
36:23
and speak and listen
36:25
which you should do in life anyway um so
36:28
i don't think we've mentioned before
36:29
peter gabriel's
36:30
project from genesis peter gabriel from
36:33
genesis
36:34
is working on an inter-species internet
36:37
what
36:37
it's called really cool project he's
36:40
been doing it for a while it happened
36:42
because he's so he's a musician and he
36:43
sort of played music with
36:45
some apes and he thought these guys are
36:47
really getting me
36:48
and he called this scientist called the
36:51
scientist called neil gershenfeld who
36:53
runs i really like his job he runs mit's
36:56
center for bits and atoms and this guy
36:59
peter gabriel none of this sounds real
37:03
these are legit people a woman called
37:05
diana rice who's a cognitive
37:06
psychologist and
37:08
uh one of the founders of the internet
37:10
vince surf or kerf who i think works
37:12
worked at um it's a difficult second
37:15
invention isn't it after you've invented
37:17
the internet and then you go
37:18
now i'm gonna invent an internet for
37:20
monkeys
37:23
these are this next step for all animals
37:25
to talk to each other yes
37:26
so you can get a wasp talking to a rhino
37:28
because we indeed they would have
37:30
nothing to say to each other would they
37:31
they might have anything in common what
37:33
are you talking about they can all
37:34
about humans
37:36
bloody humans swatted my mate today yeah
37:38
well they took off my nose
37:41
the user interface is gonna be really
37:43
hard because you're gonna
37:45
use a mouse
37:53
amazing oh uh just stuff on the u.n
37:56
i didn't realize this but i think maybe
37:58
it's quite well known that the un
37:59
the idea of the um was conceived by
38:02
churchill and roosevelt when churchill
38:03
was naked
38:04
as so many things were conceived i think
38:06
we talked about his poncho
38:08
children
38:08
[Laughter]
38:11
so this is from daisy suckley who was a
38:13
confidant of roosevelt who
38:15
uh it was when it was when america has
38:17
been sucked into the war
38:18
and they decided that they had to have a
38:20
united front against fascism and they
38:21
wanted to know what to call it and fdr
38:23
was lying in bed going to sleep and
38:26
suddenly
38:26
churchill burst in but no no he didn't
38:29
notice the other way around
38:30
fdr thought united nations and so the
38:33
moment he woke up the next morning he
38:35
jumped out of bed and then he actually
38:36
had some breakfast
38:37
and then and then he went up to
38:40
churchill's bedroom and knocked on the
38:41
door and
38:42
churchill said come in and church will
38:44
emerge from the bathroom but naked
38:46
and apparently appeared like a pink
38:49
cherub fdr describes him as
38:52
fdr pointed at him and exploded the
38:55
united nations
38:56
[Laughter]
38:58
i think if i was churchill after he came
39:00
in pointed at me
39:02
naked and said the united nations that
39:03
would be the nickname for my genitals
39:05
[Music]
39:05
[Laughter]
39:09
i can get you a seat on the united
39:10
nations if you like
39:19

i think you need some lamb sip on this
02:08
show come with the podcast
02:22
and welcome to another episode of no
02:24
such thing as a fish
02:25
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
02:27
qi offices in covent garden
02:29
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
02:31
here with james harkin
02:32
andrew hunter murray and anna chazinski
02:35
and once again
02:36
we have gathered around the microphones
02:37
with our four favorite facts from the
02:39
last seven days
02:40
and in no particular order here we go
02:43
starting with fact number one and that
02:45
is
02:45
josinski my fact this week is that the
02:48
rear view mirror was invented
02:50
so that racing drivers didn't have to
02:52
have a person sitting next to them in
02:53
the car explaining what was going on
02:55
behind them
02:58
yes i think bizarrely i found this out
03:00
because i saw a post from an insurance
03:02
site or something but anyway it was
03:04
invented for the indy 500 inaugural race
03:06
in 1911 so the indy 500 is that big
03:08
race that happens in indianapolis 1911
03:11
it was won by a guy called ray
03:13
haroon and basically the reason he won
03:15
it was that he realized that the cars
03:17
always had two people in them
03:18
the driver and then the person who had
03:20
to do a number of things one of which
03:22
included turning around and saying if
03:24
there were any cars behind them in
03:25
dangerous positions
03:26
to make sure there wasn't a pile up or a
03:27
big crash and ray thought that's a lot
03:29
of extra weight
03:30
wonder if i can avoid that and what he
03:33
did was he
03:34
got a mirror and placed it in the middle
03:36
of his car hanging in the middle of his
03:37
car on a pole
03:38
and then he won the race because he
03:39
halved the weight in the car he did win
03:41
the race although
03:42
we're not 100 sure that he actually won
03:44
the race as in he got given the prize
03:46
but the truth was that no one really
03:48
knew how to count all the laps
03:50
or time things or anything like that and
03:53
there were loads of uh pit stops
03:55
so really no one actually knew who won
03:57
the race how did they decide they just
03:58
went
03:59
i feel like it should be over now next
04:00
person to cross the line a little bit
04:02
like that there was a guy who
04:03
there was a guy whose job it was to kind
04:05
of put who was in the lead
04:06
and they would change it every now and
04:08
then but the truth was that you know
04:10
some people took two minutes to change a
04:11
tire some people it took them 15 minutes
04:13
to change the tyre
04:14
some cars would come out of the pit lane
04:16
and then back
04:17
up over the finishing line and then go
04:20
back over again so it added an extra
04:22
no that really happened that wouldn't be
04:24
god
04:25
that couldn't have been the lap they
04:27
didn't know what was going on at all
04:28
like they just didn't have the
04:29
technology to work out times or anything
04:31
like that that sounds like a cheat that
04:32
you would do in mario kart
04:35
i remember doing that kind of thing in
04:37
diddy kong racing and you see how close
04:38
you can loop around the finishing
04:40
kind of post for it to count and it
04:42
never does never does so the technology
04:43
there is more advanced than here there
04:45
was a guy called mulford who um was
04:47
pretty sure that he'd won
04:48
and he went across the finishing line
04:50
and then what you always did was you did
04:52
an insurance lap at the end
04:53
just to make sure that you've done the
04:54
right distance because people might
04:56
think oh you've
04:57
done one not enough and so he did his
04:59
insurance lap and then when he got to
05:01
the end of the insurance lap he found
05:02
that someone else had claimed the
05:03
victory which was
05:04
haroon and her room was already being
05:07
cheered as the victor and he's like no
05:08
wait a minute i finished like two
05:09
minutes ago
05:10
wow i think that haroon used to work as
05:13
a chauffeur
05:14
yeah and he apparently i read one
05:17
account that said he got the idea for a
05:18
rear-view mirror
05:19
in a car from a review mirror that he
05:21
saw in a horse-drawn carriage
05:23
that's what he said certainly well that
05:25
makes sense because pretty much
05:26
everything in cars came from hospital
05:28
carriages didn't i guess so but it's
05:29
just funny thinking of a
05:30
horse-drawn carriage with mirrors i was
05:33
looking for um
05:34
horse-drawn carriage mirrors and i don't
05:35
think they were really a thing the only
05:37
reference i could find to advising
05:38
there'd be mirrors in horse run
05:39
carriages
05:40
were saying there has to be a mirror in
05:42
order that the lady in the carriage at
05:44
some point might want to check her
05:45
makeup
05:45
[Laughter]
05:47
yeah it seems like that was that was the
05:49
real innovator that guy in the hall
05:50
strong carriage that he saw yeah
05:52
um just on horse-drawn carriages and how
05:54
they
05:55
uh sort of competed with cars there was
05:57
this early concept
05:59
in 1899 when there was a point where
06:01
cars and
06:02
horse-drawn carriages were intermingling
06:04
and it was scaring farmers and was
06:05
particularly scaring horses
06:07
so a guy called uriah smith and this was
06:09
in battle creek michigan
06:10
invented this contraption called the
06:13
horsey horseless carriage
06:14
and you put a horse's head on the front
06:16
of your car
06:18
and it looks like you're just riding a
06:20
horse but you're actually driving your
06:21
car
06:22
sort of except that the horse doesn't
06:23
have a back end yeah but i guess if
06:24
you're approaching a horse it would be
06:26
like oh yeah
06:27
it's like if a horse was entering the
06:29
room and only its head had popped in
06:31
you might think it was a horse yeah but
06:33
then is it like in um
06:34
a pantomime if one guy doesn't turn up
06:37
it isn't like that
06:38
and it's j it's quite frightening
06:40
because it's just up to the neck it
06:41
looks like someone stuffed and mounted a
06:42
horse's head and stuck it on the front
06:44
of their car to our eyes
06:45
and the other thing was that they said
06:47
because i wrote a bit about it they said
06:49
that i think the horse's head was full
06:50
of petrol yes because it was an extra
06:52
fuel reserve in case you brought it in
06:54
the main tank
06:54
it is a good idea until you hit
06:56
something and at which point it becomes
06:58
a real
06:58
uh fire liability yes because you just
07:02
smash a big petrol tank into someone
07:03
else yeah explosion
07:05
but they weren't they were so paranoid
07:06
weren't they i think we did a q episode
07:08
on this a few years ago but there was
07:10
that thing where
07:11
various rules were written in the
07:12
highway code or equivalent in america
07:14
which said things like
07:15
if you're driving a car and you think a
07:16
horse is approaching about a mile away
07:18
you hear horse
07:19
plopping in approach you have to carry
07:22
with you a scene of the surrounding
07:24
countryside which you stop
07:25
your car and you throw the countryside
07:27
scene over your cars
07:30
that's so annoying especially when it's
07:32
just a guy with two coconuts
07:35
i thought it was that you had to
07:36
dismantle the car and sometimes you have
07:38
to dismantle the car
07:40
yeah you just sort of have to take it
07:41
apart and hide it find a hedge
07:44
that was written down as well now i
07:45
remember researching this and i think
07:47
there was a lot of exaggeration
07:49
about the so i could never work out what
07:51
they actually did and what was actually
07:52
written as a joke in the highway code
07:54
and i don't think they ever actually
07:55
fully produced the horsey horseless
07:57
thing it was yeah it was concept
07:59
designed and patented yeah
08:00
yeah there have been some great car
08:02
patents over the years though i was
08:04
looking at some of them
08:05
so one car invention that never really
08:07
took off was in 1935 the dog sack
08:10
if you don't want to keep your pet in
08:12
your car because it gets hair everywhere
08:14
then it's a sack that clamps onto the
08:16
running board of the car and then it
08:17
hooks onto an open window and you tie
08:19
your dog up in it
08:20
and you can carry it outside the car
08:22
that's good because dogs like to stick
08:23
their head out of the window don't they
08:24
perfect
08:25
they're just now their whole body's
08:26
outside the window that's what they've
08:28
always wanted if you put a dog in one of
08:29
those it would probably stick its head
08:30
in the window
08:31
i think they'll just like stick their
08:33
head through windows that's my theory
08:36
that's true did you hear about the
08:38
steering wheel of death no
08:40
this was um this was a car innovation on
08:43
a cadillac the 1954 cadillac el dorado
08:45
so these are obviously
08:46
really expensive cars you know they're
08:48
very luxurious but
08:49
the steering wheel of this cadillac it
08:51
had a kind of bullet shaped
08:53
spike in the middle of it right so
08:55
imagine a really large
08:57
bullet the the the pointy end of the
08:59
book yeah you know
09:00
the front end as it were so that was
09:02
just in the middle of the steering wheel
09:03
so obviously that's
09:04
quite dangerous in the event of a crash
09:07
and that's how it got the nickname and
09:09
sammy davis jr he
09:10
had a crash in one of those cars and his
09:12
face at the wheel and he lost an eye as
09:14
a result sorry
09:15
did you explain why they had the spike
09:17
in the steering wheel aesthetics
09:19
no way designed it's not useful it
09:21
wasn't useful for anything it was
09:23
you know when that was the euro when
09:24
cars had these fantastic oh that was the
09:25
era where there were spikes in the
09:27
middle of every car
09:28
like an iron maiden you would drive
09:30
around boxes of tnt
09:34
it's more rounded than a full-on spike
09:36
right it doesn't look like it doesn't
09:37
look like an actual spike but it does
09:38
look like a big bullet
09:39
because sammy davis jr lost his eye yeah
09:41
yeah wow
09:42
well there was that um idea that someone
09:45
came up with which was just a design
09:46
idea it wasn't real
09:47
of putting a massive spike in every
09:49
steering wheel
09:50
and the idea is it would just make
09:52
everyone drive really carefully oh yeah
09:55
the opposite of an airbag it's a real
09:57
carrot or stick kind of
09:59
the duke of edinburgh has been impaled
10:01
again
10:03
here's another cadillac convention just
10:04
very quickly that didn't work out um
10:06
they tried to
10:07
put working toilets in the inside of
10:09
their cars that was in 1947. you can see
10:11
photos of it it looks really incredible
10:13
right in the back seat yeah and you you
10:15
would have what was a
10:17
proper toilet in this photo um but the
10:19
problem was it just didn't make sense
10:21
really to have it
10:22
why not why not because the amount of
10:24
space that you'd need for the tank
10:26
uh for the flush the smell was too great
10:28
there was a lot of splash back
10:29
apparently in the testing
10:30
um and the smells yeah these feel like
10:33
problems we can overcome
10:34
it's true it looked so cool i mean
10:37
splashback for instance
10:38
obviously don't have it be water-based
10:40
silly
10:41
oh just have a like a cat litter tray
10:46
make sand castles if you don't need the
10:47
loo it's multi-purpose
10:49
that's the thing there are lots of rules
10:50
aren't there about how uh fun you can
10:52
make things on the road
10:53
like service stations right there are
10:55
rules in fact there are laws
10:57
about what you're allowed to have at a
10:58
service station because the road the
11:00
motorway network is so important
11:02
for people for you know transport that
11:04
you can't have say
11:06
i don't know a casino at a service
11:09
station
11:09
because you can't have anything there
11:11
that would mean people went there
11:12
especially it's interesting though
11:13
because every single
11:14
service station does have slot machines
11:16
in it yeah remember when we were on tour
11:18
literally every single one
11:19
casino was a very bad example
11:23
[Laughter]
11:27
there are no um next to the eminence it
11:30
has to be just
11:30
you know refueling going to the toilet
11:32
and the slob machines
11:34
[Laughter]
11:35
the important stuff there's so much fun
11:38
stuff on the british
11:39
highway well they very recently opened
11:41
the weatherspoons in one of them didn't
11:42
they and that was a massive deal and
11:44
everyone thought it was a terrible idea
11:45
because you shouldn't have be able to
11:46
sell
11:47
alcohol at service stations but they
11:48
didn't do i went into a box that
11:50
simulated a hurricane on one of the
11:51
spots
11:53
did you make a special journey would you
11:56
make a special photo no
11:57
no i wouldn't i went it blew my glasses
11:59
off it's very dangerous
12:00
but i've never heard of that being
12:02
anywhere else like a hurricane but
12:04
that's true yeah so which services was
12:06
it it was it was when we were on tour
12:07
our last time
12:09
don't encourage it this whole point is
12:10
you shouldn't make special journals
12:13
stations i'm going because then i'm
12:15
gonna get drunk at the weather spoons
12:16
play a bit of slot machines
12:18
do the hurricane thing go to the brothel
12:20
and then drive back
12:22
great news i got blown off at the time
12:24
and then i did the hurricane box
12:30
back to the indy 500 quickly do you mind
12:32
uh
12:33
so one of the things with the indy 500
12:35
winners is that they drink a cup of milk
12:37
after
12:38
the race and it's a tradition that was
12:39
born in 1936 louis mayer
12:42
he finished and he asked for buttermilk
12:44
after the race
12:45
and it was a dairy executive who saw him
12:47
drinking it in a picture
12:48
and they sort of they must have
12:50
approached them and that tradition was
12:52
born
12:52
and so when you're going to race they
12:54
ask you what kind of milk would you like
12:57
just so we can have it ready for you
12:58
does that mean like a full fat or
13:00
exactly and majority it's full fat they
13:03
found
13:04
they just released the latest um
13:09
why are you surprised by that i just
13:10
like so much milk and i suppose
13:12
and you thought because you're such a
13:13
great racing driver you thought surely
13:15
all the restaurants
13:15
are my buddies well in this in this
13:18
hipster era they must be having
13:20
to stock way more milk than usual
13:22
because they'll be having almond
13:23
oats and lacto-free in 1913
13:27
um the winner was joule goo who was a
13:29
french driver he won by 13 minutes
13:31
actually
13:32
but he drank champagne throughout the
13:34
race in fact
13:35
um some people think he might have had
13:37
as many as six bottles of champagne
13:39
during the cost of the race
13:42
he definitely had at least half a pint
13:44
in his first pit stop
13:45
and then he was drinking it throughout
13:47
the race so he won the race but he did
13:49
lose his driving license
13:51
you would really have benefited from the
13:53
car with a toilet in the back
13:56
you can't climb into the back of the car
13:58
i'd like to be racing
14:01
the trophy for the indy 500 uh for
14:04
people who aren't familiar with it which
14:05
i wasn't really
14:06
is ridiculous it's amazing it's
14:08
revolting
14:09
so it's i love it dad loves it it's um
14:12
so it's five foot tall it's ridiculously
14:14
large uh it's all made of silver
14:17
and as soon as you win the race you get
14:18
your head sculpted onto it and attached
14:21
and then they ran out of space on it in
14:22
the 80s i think so they had to add an
14:24
extra level so they can get more heads
14:26
on it so it's got all their old guys
14:28
heads as well
14:28
everyone's
14:33
everyone else has got like that milk
14:34
mustache that you get
14:37
[Music]
14:42
okay it's time for fact number two and
14:44
that is
14:46
james okay my fact this week is that a
14:48
2018 paper
14:49
suggesting that people who have a
14:51
surname which occurs towards the end of
14:53
the alphabet are more likely to end up
14:55
academically and professionally
14:56
undistinguished
14:58
was co-authored by professor jeffrey
15:00
zaks
15:03
i love co-author because he couldn't
15:04
even individually all through his own
15:05
thing
15:07
well he co-authored it with the guy
15:08
whose name was corey beginning with c
15:10
yeah so yeah he was the brains behind it
15:12
wasn't he
15:14
well jeffrey zaks is quite cool actually
15:16
he's a university of boulder
15:17
psychologist and i listened to an
15:19
interview with him
15:19
on a radio show called top of the mind
15:22
and they asked him
15:23
you know is the reason you're doing this
15:25
because obviously you had a bad time of
15:27
it because of your name
15:28
and he said he was sensitized to the
15:30
issue because of that but actually it
15:31
doesn't affect him
15:32
because according to their studies
15:34
doesn't affect people who are
15:35
distinguished in any other way
15:36
so if you're kind of top of your class
15:38
at school or bottom of your class
15:40
or you look different or you're more
15:42
attractive or less attractive it doesn't
15:43
really affect you
15:44
it only affects people who are right in
15:46
the middle but they've found that
15:48
actually it does affect them it means
15:49
it gives them less distinction at high
15:51
school less satisfaction at high school
15:53
and lower educational attainment
15:55
after they've left school and until
15:57
you're about middle aged it affects you
15:58
quite badly according to them what's the
16:00
justification here is it just about
16:01
reading out the register
16:02
and so there are a few different reasons
16:04
um it's so for instance
16:07
infant school a lot of kids are put in
16:08
alphabetical order so the kids beginning
16:10
with a and near the front of the class
16:12
which means they get more attention
16:14
people just tend to get asked more
16:15
for things so um for not school for
16:18
instance
16:19
if your name is towards the start of the
16:20
alphabet you're less likely to give
16:22
money to charity
16:23
and that's because you get rung up more
16:25
because your name is at the front of the
16:26
alphabet and you get more annoyed by it
16:28
and so you're less likely to give money
16:30
really yeah it's also like in um when
16:32
it's graduation and they're handing out
16:34
diplomas this is one of the things
16:35
mentioned
16:36
you start a to zed it's all really
16:38
exciting at the top and then by the time
16:39
you get to zuckerberg
16:40
oh yeah and that's why he never made
16:42
anything right but when you get to the
16:44
end most people have left because they
16:45
want to get the restaurants early and
16:47
everyone who's applauding their arms are
16:49
tired and
16:50
stuff like that and so it's not terrible
16:51
and i can understand if you're marking a
16:53
big pile of exam papers
16:55
and aaron jay aronson makes a point and
16:57
then
16:58
sammy sammy makes up the same point you
17:01
think i read this in erin j aronson's
17:03
article that was hours ago
17:04
yeah exact market lower so and the
17:06
teacher might say okay um can someone
17:08
read their
17:09
a report um aaron j erinson can you do
17:11
it and then by the time
17:13
zuckerberg gets there he just never gets
17:14
asked and so you have less confidence in
17:16
public speaking as well
17:18
so this genuinely does seem to be a
17:20
thing yeah although i'm not sure about
17:21
his way of um
17:22
i'm not sure about zach's way of
17:23
converting it one of the ways he says he
17:25
combats it is that he is a professor so
17:27
we are students
17:28
and he always calls the class register
17:30
in reverse order
17:31
which seems to me to just be recreating
17:33
the problem
17:35
he suggests that people should maybe do
17:37
something to distinguish themselves like
17:39
dress strangely or something that's one
17:41
of the specific things he said
17:42
like just so that people notice you
17:44
because it's the people who aren't
17:45
noticed who struggle the most
17:47
and if you're later on the alphabet
17:48
you're more likely not to be noticed
17:50
if you're otherwise undistinguished yes
17:52
that's right um and it works the other
17:54
way around so there's another study
17:55
which is that authors whose surnames are
17:57
ranked towards the front of the alphabet
17:59
are more likely to be cited in
18:00
scientific papers and that was
18:02
um lead authored by a guy called
18:05
arsenalt
18:07
um so he has obviously seen that he's
18:09
been sighted more often than others
18:11
because he's an a
18:12
and also he has the word ass in his name
18:16
and for presidential candidates in
18:17
america that's another thing they think
18:19
influences because that's in
18:20
alphabetical order as well when you go
18:21
in
18:22
for um doing that so you more likely to
18:25
go
18:25
for someone who's this george
18:33
yeah you're saying that george
18:35
washington only became president because
18:37
he sees
18:38
power yeah people put himself in never
18:41
have won a fair election
18:43
yeah okay here there are definitely
18:45
countries where it's
18:46
law that on the ballot paper you have to
18:48
mix it up aren't there or you do half
18:50
and half on ballot papers because
18:51
yeah people just take an a because it's
18:53
a lot of effort when you go to the
18:54
ballot box and you're in a hurry to get
18:56
to work anyway you just cross the first
18:57
one you see don't you yeah
18:58
one thing i think zach's found which is
19:00
encouraging is that by the time you're
19:01
in your mid-30s the effect
19:03
lessens to the point of disappearance
19:05
because you've been distinguished in
19:07
some other way by then
19:08
so people are judging you not on your
19:09
name by but on what you've done in life
19:11
yeah no i thought it was because you
19:13
weren't having registered taken anymore
19:18
the paper just for anyone listening is
19:20
called alphabetism
19:22
the effects of surname initial and the
19:24
cost of being otherwise undistinguished
19:26
and that paper has 96 citations and i
19:29
counted them and there are 77 from a to
19:32
m and only 17 from n to z
19:34
wow so they're compounding the problem
19:36
proof
19:38
i find it so weird that leonardo da
19:40
vinci doesn't have a surname
19:42
oh it's true i always thought that was
19:44
his surname how old would he be vinci
19:46
just for people who were like me who
19:47
didn't know that
19:48
yeah yeah but what do you mean by
19:49
doesn't have a surname because our
19:50
surnames are like that as well in the
19:52
end that does end up being your surname
19:54
so there was for instance in 2016 i
19:56
think
19:56
that someone compiled a dictionary of 50
19:58
000 surnames
20:00
from britain that go all the way back to
20:01
like the 11th century and they found
20:04
that
20:04
about half of the most common ones were
20:06
locative which is basically that uh ones
20:08
that say what place you're from
20:10
you know so like less if you're names
20:12
lester or if your surnames
20:13
and i can't think like jack london or
20:16
stafford
20:17
stafford exactly so it's
20:23
do you guys know if any of your surnames
20:24
have a uh mine will be
20:27
can we mean family of i should think uh
20:29
it's irish anyway
20:30
yes of course i don't know about murray
20:33
murray i
20:34
read ages ago there's both there's
20:35
claims for it in scotland and ireland
20:37
um that battle out for what the murray
20:39
is a place presumably in scotland as
20:41
well
20:41
moray yeah there's a moray eel
20:54
is like a bird the name is like a bird
20:56
so some are descriptors and that's one
20:58
of the most common
20:59
types of name you have as well when you
21:01
go back why are you looking like
21:02
i am like a bird because i'm like a bird
21:07
well about a fifth of surnames in fact
21:10
in our country
21:11
are like that as in descriptors so like
21:12
good fellow that's a nice descriptive
21:14
one yeah
21:15
short is either means that the person
21:17
who had that nickname was really short
21:19
or it often meant that they were really
21:20
tall
21:21
so you never know because it's like a
21:24
funny ironic thing you know and you're
21:25
like all right shorty it was a tall guy
21:27
there were quite a lot of those
21:28
medieval does it could it mean that
21:30
whoever was called goodfella was
21:32
actually a bit of a
21:33
yes whereas
21:36
poor derrick twatt from one of the
21:38
nicest and kindest families in the town
21:45
[Music]
21:46
okay it is time for fact number three
21:49
and that is my fact
21:50
my fact this week is that grocery bags
21:53
used in hollywood movies
21:55
don't rustle how why aren't we allowed
21:58
them
21:58
i know so this is uh this is something
22:01
that i read on a website called
22:03
proptrix.com this is
22:04
the website of a man who invented these
22:06
bags i'm about to tell you about tim
22:08
schultz is his name
22:10
and it's when on movie sets you see
22:13
people carrying any kind of bags usually
22:14
when you're recording
22:15
that makes so much noise that they can't
22:17
cancel out that it ruins scenes i have
22:19
to constantly
22:20
re-record scenes and he was on the set
22:21
of a tv show back in the day that
22:23
starred martin lawrence called
22:25
martin and martin as he's coming into
22:27
the
22:28
room gets his pants taken off by a door
22:30
frame that he gets caught on
22:32
so he has to exit wearing only a bag and
22:34
it kept rustling or
22:35
rather that was the scene and he thought
22:37
how are we gonna do this without it
22:38
causing so much noise
22:40
that you're not going to hear the scene
22:41
so he went away and invented a silent
22:43
grocery bag
22:44
wow yes and it's used in tons of movies
22:46
now and he's expanded his horizons it's
22:48
not just grocery bags he's got
22:50
department store bags
22:51
bakery bags lunch door bags doggy bags
22:53
he's done
22:54
silent gift tissue and silent cellophane
22:57
for wrapping flowers in
22:58
wow which aren't completely silent you
23:00
can hear them slightly because
23:01
it would be weird if someone was
23:02
wrapping a present there was no sound
23:03
effect yeah
23:04
well you can add that on you that's the
23:06
point is exactly you added on post with
23:07
foley
23:08
um yeah so how do you know what they're
23:11
made of
23:12
i've tried to find out but i wonder if
23:14
it's yeah if i haven't dug hard enough
23:16
or it's an industry secret that he's
23:17
holding on to like the secrets of
23:19
coca-cola
23:20
mix he could at least tell theaters
23:21
couldn't he could at least put them on
23:23
boiled suites
23:24
in theaters because i think that's where
23:25
that causes the most problems is plus
23:27
the plastic crackling thing
23:28
there is a company called silent snacks
23:32
that in 2016 launched a whole load of
23:34
products to have
23:35
in cinemas and theaters which don't
23:36
rustle or don't make any noise
23:38
wow like what uh ground popcorn
23:41
so basically instead of being like lumps
23:44
of popcorn
23:44
it's just kind of popcorn dust
23:46
disgusting
23:48
cocoa butter balls
23:50
[Laughter]
23:52
they kind of melt in your mouth rather
23:54
than like i guess like m
23:55
m's at my crunching um crisps
23:58
they've got silent crisps well the
24:01
dehydrated pear slices
24:05
apparently they're just bendy enough to
24:06
be pleasant but not too crisp
24:09
i don't think any level of bendiness in
24:10
my crisp is pleasant
24:12
no no i don't think you want a bending
24:13
crystal i think if you hear the phrase
24:15
it's just bendy enough to be pleasant
24:17
that date's taking a bad turn
24:20
they also invented an anti-gas
24:22
grapefruit drink
24:24
and they're not burping stop you burping
24:27
and farting yeah
24:28
oh is that a major problem in um it is
24:30
if you go with me
24:33
can you play the last 10 minutes again
24:35
please
24:35
[Laughter]
24:38
um so all movie props the same newspaper
24:41
has been being read in movies for about
24:43
20 years
24:43
there's this one newspaper that keeps
24:45
cropping up in lots and lots of films
24:46
it's been in
24:47
um no country for old men it's been in
24:49
the texas chainsaw massacre it's been in
24:51
desperate housewives
24:52
so when you see someone in a film
24:53
reading a paper do you know where the
24:54
headline is can you remember no i don't
24:56
i didn't write it down man lands on moon
25:03
i've just got one more thing on how to
25:05
keep a set
25:06
quiet oh yeah you're filming um lord of
25:09
the rings when they were filming
25:10
they obviously had a ginormous crew and
25:13
there were two people
25:14
on that crew whose job it was to sit at
25:16
the local airport that they were closest
25:18
to when they were filming
25:19
and to call ahead when planes were
25:21
taking off so they knew to not film a
25:23
scene
25:25
yeah they would have so you didn't have
25:27
the sound of airplanes you just had lots
25:28
of sounds of mobile phones going on
25:31
yeah it's like gandalf's pockets
25:35
i mean lord of the rings one of the
25:36
props they had actually was a giant ring
25:39
or a big ring anyway so they had they
25:41
have to have quite a lot of rings
25:42
there's one ring to rule them all
25:44
etcetera but there's actually a number
25:45
of replicas
25:47
bring in another one of those one rings
25:49
to rule them all
25:52
right no they so so it can fit different
25:54
fingers because different people wear it
25:56
but then also they had a really big one
25:58
about the size of a football it looks
25:59
like in the photos
26:00
and that's for when you do wheel
26:02
close-ups then you want it to look
26:04
really intricate so there's a scene
26:06
where when you know you can sort of tell
26:07
it's a really seminal scene in the
26:09
fellowship of the ring where um
26:11
frodo drops the ring he's supposed to be
26:12
carrying it and he's like oh no where's
26:14
it gone and he looks up and borum is
26:15
picking it up
26:16
and you see the ring being picked up out
26:18
of the snow and that's a giant ring
26:21
giant hand no you don't see his hand
26:23
come down
26:24
you see the chain attached to the ring
26:26
be lifted up so they made a big chain to
26:27
go with it
26:28
cool i know i thought you're going to
26:30
say because they're are they all dwarfs
26:32
or something
26:32
in the rings yeah so you'd need a big
26:35
one to make it look like
26:37
they're all really small is that not
26:39
what i i don't think that was wiper
26:40
maybe it had that that's a great
26:42
so that's the only prop they had to
26:43
adjust the size of the hobbits
26:45
like hands over a ring
26:50
they're not borrowers i haven't seen it
26:53
in there
26:54
in the book or in the whole thing does
26:56
the ring change
26:57
size no no um i think so does everyone
27:00
in the lot of the rings like to have the
27:01
same size fingers
27:02
yeah that's a great one you never wear
27:04
it you never wear the ring because
27:06
yeah they do they go disappearing it
27:08
presumably
27:09
it must be magic to adjust to the
27:12
owner's finger
27:13
or some people it just doesn't fit on
27:14
maybe sometimes you can put it like for
27:16
instance
27:17
my wife's wedding ring will fit on my
27:19
little finger yeah
27:20
i will film so maybe they do that no
27:22
it's not okay this ring has the power to
27:25
create evil across the world
27:28
[Laughter]
27:31
it can adjust size according to that
27:33
thing i didn't know i don't know if it
27:34
was
27:35
i don't know so if i tried to put it on
27:36
my neck would it kind of
27:38
get bigger so it went on my neck it's a
27:40
magical ring it can do whatever it is
27:42
but he never says oh it and then it made
27:44
itself a bit smaller so it could hit on
27:45
frodo's tiny things
27:50
those scenes were deleted
27:56
sorry guys i was reading a few blogs by
28:00
a woman called ellen freund
28:02
i think f-r-e-u-n-d who is i think she's
28:05
one of hollywood's main prop makers
28:07
really
28:07
it was really interesting so she did the
28:09
props for mad men and stuff like that
28:10
really good period pieces but it must be
28:12
so frustrating because
28:13
a lot of the props that you make as a
28:15
prop maker never get seen by an audience
28:17
they're just to create the environment
28:20
for the actors so she was saying you
28:21
know every single draw that someone
28:23
opened in mad men
28:24
you wouldn't see inside it from the
28:26
camera angle but you know the actors had
28:28
to see all the stuff they thought their
28:29
character might have
28:30
been joking no way surely you can just
28:32
put a little
28:33
post-it note saying there is a there's
28:35
no stuff in this there is stuff in this
28:37
truck yeah
28:38
no these people can't pretend
28:41
that's got to see the star that's so
28:43
patsy yeah it turns out they're not very
28:45
good actors at all
28:46
but if the actors are freaked out by an
28:48
empty draw imagine how they're going to
28:49
be freaked out by the massive film crew
28:51
who are on the other half of their
28:53
office yeah they all have to disguise
28:55
themselves as wallpapers
28:59
they'll have to hide behind the picture
29:01
of the countryside
29:02
[Laughter]
29:04
she made it sound kind of creepy also
29:06
making props ellen did because she said
29:08
you can obviously google stuff for what
29:10
things look like when you're trying to
29:11
work out you know what a book would have
29:13
looked like in the 1920s
29:15
you can't possibly imagine but she's
29:18
chosen the one object that hasn't really
29:19
changed
29:23
she said really the only way you can get
29:25
a proper idea for what let's say she has
29:27
to design
29:28
a bunch of stuff for 13 reasons why
29:30
which she worked on which is
29:31
contemporary teenagers right she said
29:33
you've got to go out into the world and
29:34
see what they're actually wearing
29:35
so she said um i've got to go out and
29:38
stand near high schools for instance and
29:40
i'll watch the children all day to make
29:42
sure that i understand what their
29:43
background is
29:44
surely they all just wear school
29:45
uniforms and maybe she goes to the the
29:47
mufti schools love these schools yeah
29:49
it is 13 reasons why there you go yeah
29:52
yeah so she goes to muffy schools and
29:53
then she says i'll go down to the mall
29:55
where i know the kids are shopping and
29:56
then i'll watch them there to see what
29:58
sort of stuff they're
29:59
i mean she must look like a real weirdo
30:01
yeah yeah
30:02
especially depending on the kind of
30:03
thing you're filming as well yes if
30:05
you're filming something set in a morgue
30:07
you have to go and hang out
30:08
around the mall see what they're wearing
30:10
but make sure you go to a muffy mug
30:15
[Applause]
30:19
okay it's time for our final fact of the
30:21
show and that is
30:22
andy my fact is that eating ginger can
30:25
make you feel better about drinking out
30:27
of a toilet
30:28
is that because it tastes a bit better
30:30
uh it's not
30:32
it's and this is a by the way this is a
30:34
toilet that's never been used oh okay so
30:36
would you drink out of a toilet that's
30:37
never been used yes
30:38
do i have any other options like could i
30:40
just drink out of a glass
30:42
no the glass there's no glass there's no
30:44
glass so am i really thirsty
30:45
nah you've you had a cup of tea about an
30:48
hour
30:48
[Laughter]
30:49
was there a ginger biscuit i had with
30:51
this cup of tea yeah yeah all right okay
30:53
yeah i'm cool
30:54
yeah it works um so
30:57
this is an experiment ginger is said to
30:59
help prevent nausea
31:01
and there's a lot of debate about
31:03
whether you get disgusted because of a
31:05
moral judgment you've made or whether
31:06
it's
31:07
kind of the other way around whether
31:08
moral judgments guide what we then find
31:10
disgusting or whether disgust is
31:11
inherent and then we judge based on that
31:13
so there was an experiment at the
31:15
university of british columbia which
31:16
gave patients
31:17
ginger capsules and it experimented
31:20
uh how disgusting people found things
31:23
when they had had those as opposed to
31:24
when they hadn't had those yeah
31:26
so it and the experiment found that it
31:28
reduced how disgusted
31:30
people were by moderately disgusting
31:32
photos
31:33
like a photo of some snot in a napkin
31:35
but it did not help extremely disgusting
31:37
things like vomit in a toilet
31:39
right and they then tested how it
31:42
affected so-called purity violations
31:45
which is a bit breaking taboos about
31:47
purity and cleanliness so for example
31:49
people who'd taken ginger were less uh
31:51
strict about moderate violations
31:54
like drinking from a never used toilet
31:55
bowl but apparently it did not have an
31:57
effect on extreme purity violations like
32:00
sex between cousins right
32:03
but if you had more ginger do you think
32:05
yeah how much ginger would you need
32:07
because you snag your cousin
32:11
it just implies that um eating ginger
32:14
you can
32:14
numb your moral compass right if you
32:16
have to commit a crime there's nothing
32:17
you can do and you're grossed out by it
32:18
if i have a shed load of ginger then
32:20
i'll feel less guilty
32:21
they said they said it works to a
32:23
certain extent but it depends on the
32:24
crime you think
32:25
it only works on really really minor
32:27
crimes one big study came out a few
32:29
years ago that was saying that the more
32:31
easily disgusted you are the more likely
32:32
you are to be
32:33
conservative and it can actually be used
32:35
as a predictor of your voting even
32:37
um so and this this holds true across
32:39
121 countries they looked at so
32:41
the more conservative people are the
32:43
more easily triggered that disgust
32:44
reactions are
32:45
what i found interesting is that um like
32:48
you say the people who are
32:50
more disgusted are more likely to vote
32:52
conservative
32:53
but also that between 2013 and 2016
32:56
the value of ginger imported into the uk
32:58
has fallen by 15 percent
33:01
so maybe that's why we've become a more
33:03
conservative
33:04
country people are eating less ginger
33:06
maybe
33:08
let's start giving out gingerbread
33:09
biscuits on the streets
33:10
[Music]
33:12
you know there's a thing called
33:13
disgustology is it scientists who look
33:15
into this call themselves
33:16
disgustologists oh yeah kind of a
33:17
self-given name
33:18
that might become a surname in like 200
33:20
years
33:22
well one woman who could have it is
33:23
professor val curtis
33:25
who has a lot of the thing you have to
33:27
do when you're one of these scientists
33:28
is you have to come up with scenarios
33:30
and in one of her experiments uh she had
33:33
to come up with 70 different scenarios
33:35
and i just wanted to tell you a few of
33:36
them can you
33:36
tell me whether they're disgusting or
33:38
not so uh imagining a hairless old cat
33:41
rubbing up against one's leg that's all
33:43
right i'm not a big fan of cats in
33:44
general actually
33:45
okay okay that's a siamese cat in my
33:47
head all right stepping on a slug in
33:49
bare feet hates
33:50
like have an actual phobia of slugs okay
33:52
it's okay for me
33:53
feeling someone coughing to your face
33:55
i'm okay with it i'm okay yeah
33:57
i'm better with that than with the slugs
33:59
okay shaking hands with someone with
34:01
scabby fingers fine that's all right
34:04
yeah i'm a bit like
34:05
but i wouldn't be disgusted i think i am
34:07
the scabby fingers
34:08
[Laughter]
34:10
finding out another finding out a friend
34:12
attempted to have sex with a piece of
34:13
fruit
34:15
you're only ever going to be amused by
34:17
that depends on the fruit
34:21
what fruit would not be amusing
34:24
it's true history two more learning your
34:27
neighbor defecates in his back garden
34:29
is that disgusting it's his own back
34:31
garden but he's your neighbor
34:33
um and the final one is this disgusting
34:35
or not seeing pus coming from a genital
34:37
sore
34:38
that wrapped up quite quickly
34:43
i read a thing there's this psychologist
34:45
have this
34:46
idea that we have discussed disposal
34:48
effect it's the idea that
34:50
if we are surrounded by things um that
34:52
disgust us
34:54
we really want to get out of the
34:55
situation and if you were
34:57
the study showed that if you were
34:58
selling stuff if you were exposed to
35:00
things that disgusted you and then you
35:01
had to do your deal
35:02
you would reduce the price massively
35:04
just to get out of the situation
35:06
does that make sense so if you're in a
35:08
room that's full of vomit yes
35:10
and you're selling something on ebay yep
35:12
you will
35:13
accept a lower amount but you're on a
35:15
desktop computer which can't be moved
35:17
out of the room
35:17
yeah and that's the only powerpoint is
35:19
in that room that's full of vomit
35:21
yeah yeah i think they did a different
35:22
thing in their experiments yeah well
35:24
fine yeah we look we all design our
35:26
experiments differently that's my one
35:27
that's your yeah it's weird though it
35:30
does because i think if you could then
35:31
go to a market
35:33
and haggle and you could manufacture
35:35
like say
35:36
put a naked uh hairless old cat against
35:39
the man's leg who's selling you the
35:41
trinket you could reduce your price
35:43
massively
35:45
sorry what's in the market yeah and i've
35:48
got my hairless
35:49
naked old cat under my arm yeah i need
35:51
to rub that against the cellar
35:53
you might get the reduced price my
35:54
scabby fingers as well
35:56
and then tell you you know i just tried
35:58
to have sex with that mango
36:02
i think this is all in donald trump's at
36:04
the art of the deal isn't it
36:13

hello and welcome to another episode of
01:04
no such thing as a fish
01:06
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
01:07
qi offices in covent garden
01:10
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
01:12
here with james harkin
01:13
andrew hunter murray and anna jaczynski
01:16
and once again we have gathered around
01:18
the microphones with our four
01:19
favorite facts from the last seven days
01:21
and in no particular order
01:23
here we go starting with you andy
01:26
my fact is that when britain declared
01:28
war in 1914
01:29
they accidentally did it in the wrong
01:31
format and they had to swap the letters
01:33
otherwise britain would not technically
01:35
be at war
01:36
wow what kind of format was it i don't
01:38
know i don't know if it was in landscape
01:40
or in some kind of what they declared
01:43
with a painting or
01:44
yeah or emojis or i don't know i have no
01:46
idea um
01:48
but this is from an article in the times
01:49
literary supplement which is great by
01:51
the way highly recommended
01:53
um and there was a british diplomat
01:54
called harold nicholson who was working
01:56
at the foreign office
01:57
and one day he was told we've declared
01:59
war on germany but
02:00
we screwed it up and we sent
02:03
the letter which doesn't quite say the
02:04
right phrase i think i think what it was
02:06
was they thought that germany had
02:08
declared war
02:10
because they intercepted some um thing
02:12
over the radio waves
02:14
but actually germany hadn't declared war
02:16
and so the letter said we accept your
02:17
declaration of war but
02:18
what they actually wanted to say was we
02:20
declare war on you uh
02:22
because britain was obliged to go to the
02:24
defense of belgium and germany have
02:26
violated belgium territory and so
02:28
yeah so that's a sort of um you can't
02:30
fire me i quit
02:31
situation isn't it it's very much like
02:33
that yeah it's like getting a text
02:35
message saying i'm having an affair too
02:38
and then you have to withdraw that and
02:40
just say
02:41
and just say i'm having an affair it's
02:42
like getting the text message saying i'm
02:44
having an affair and then your spouse
02:45
says i wasn't having an affair what are
02:46
you talking about guys i really think
02:48
you should do these kind of things face
02:49
to face
02:52
um but nicholson had to go to the german
02:54
embassy
02:55
at night and he went so late in the day
02:57
that the german ambassador
02:58
who was prince lychnovsky he was in his
03:00
pajamas in his bedroom and he had the
03:02
letter declaring war on a tray
03:04
by his bed and nicholson had to do the
03:06
old switcheroo
03:07
amazing and he says that um he didn't
03:09
notice the prince didn't notice he
03:11
thought it was just a social visit to
03:12
say
03:12
well sorry we're at war this was after
03:15
they'd officially declared war it was
03:17
just they were like oh we've got a bit
03:18
of the paperwork wrong we've got to swap
03:19
that
03:19
was that before it was that night that
03:21
evening yeah so what had happened was
03:23
um britain had given a an ultimatum to
03:26
germany saying
03:27
if you don't get out of belgium we're
03:28
going to declare war and then it got to
03:31
the evening and they thought germany had
03:32
declared war but they hadn't and then
03:34
when it got to midnight that was our
03:35
ultimate and hood
03:36
kind of hit then it was actually 11 p.m
03:38
11 p.m sorry
03:40
it's very important it is very you see
03:43
if i was in charge we'd never go to one
03:45
would we
03:46
but poor world lesnovsky was so upset
03:48
wasn't he so he was the ambassador and i
03:50
always think ambassadors must have such
03:52
a difficult job in war because they're
03:54
friends with everyone in the country
03:55
they're in so he was mates with
03:57
all the brits he was very good friends
04:00
with azquith and his wife margot asquith
04:02
so
04:02
margot asquit's wife actually went to
04:05
visit
04:06
leschinovsky about an hour or two before
04:08
war was properly declared
04:09
and just went to come for him and say
04:11
sorry this is rough isn't it and he was
04:12
sobbing saying it's all over
04:14
and he knew nicholson as well so yeah
04:17
because when nicholson went to visit him
04:19
he was in his night clothes the last
04:20
thing he said to him was
04:21
give my best regards to your father i
04:23
shall not in all probability see him
04:25
before my departure yeah
04:27
and they hated the germans so who did
04:29
the the german ambassadors yeah so the
04:31
ambassador's wife
04:33
said to margo askwith on just the second
04:35
of august so two days before we went to
04:37
war
04:37
um to think that we should bring such
04:39
sorrows to an innocent and happy people
04:41
i've always hated and loathed our kaiser
04:44
have i not said to a thousand times he
04:45
and his friends are all brutes
04:46
wow so they were not not pleased about
04:48
it no and i suppose if you are an
04:50
ambassador you're gonna have a more
04:52
rounded world view aren't you yeah you
04:54
know probably i don't know yeah i've
04:56
never been one
04:58
and nicol sorry just on nicholson uh
05:01
then he later went on people might have
05:03
heard of him because he later went on to
05:04
marry writer vita sackville west
05:07
how really uh in a kind of marriage of
05:09
convenience because
05:11
i think he was gay and she was a lesbian
05:12
or they were maybe both bisexual
05:14
um but they kind of got married so that
05:16
she could inherit her
05:18
ancestral home of cissinghurst okay
05:20
we're sure it wasn't a phrasing mistake
05:21
and he didn't mean to say mind
05:23
someone else he accidentally wrote would
05:25
you marry me
05:26
sorry i meant to say i don't
05:31
i've not heard of her is she a big
05:33
awesome she's she's a poet
05:35
yeah she's quite famous cool i i mostly
05:38
know her because she has a weird name
05:40
right it kind of sticks in your head
05:42
doesn't it yeah
05:43
um so we george v also sort of lots of
05:46
people declare war
05:47
officially georgia fifth is one of the
05:49
people who sort of announced the nation
05:51
that we were at war
05:52
and his diary is very interesting
05:53
because it's so matter-of-fact so
05:55
his diary on that night uh he wrote it
05:57
just before he went to sleep
05:58
and he it was a short entry he said i
06:01
held a council at 10 45 in the evening
06:03
to declare war with germany
06:04
it is a terrible catastrophe but it is
06:06
not our fault and then he said
06:09
the crowds were all cheering uh when
06:11
they heard war have been declared the
06:12
cheering was even more terrific
06:14
went to bed at midnight and that's just
06:16
that's that that's the start of the
06:17
first world war
06:18
yeah there were loads of because they
06:20
had a speech in parliament didn't they
06:22
uh was it gray or someone did a speech
06:24
in parliament and everyone was outside
06:26
kind of
06:26
expecting the war was going to be
06:28
declared and
06:29
there was a mob in london who attacked
06:32
the german embassy
06:33
and at the same time there was a mob in
06:35
germany that attacked the british
06:36
embassy in berlin
06:38
really throwing stones that was kind of
06:40
a microcosm of the next four years
06:41
yes there's someone else who we know
06:43
where they were when war broke out
06:44
and it's adolf hitler and the
06:46
interesting thing is we know
06:48
because there was a photograph taken of
06:49
this huge crowd in munich at a place
06:51
called the odeon platz
06:53
and they're all uh celebrating there's
06:55
lots of people lots of crowds all over
06:56
europe celebrated the outbreak of war
06:57
they thought it was a good thing
06:59
and um you can see if you zoom in hitler
07:02
in the crowd
07:03
with a really big droopy moustache
07:07
yeah but this is the crazy thing so the
07:08
photo was taken by a photographer who
07:10
later became
07:11
hitler's official photographer and in
07:13
one of the very
07:14
early bits of nazi propaganda hitler
07:17
they tracked down this photo they saw
07:19
you saw hitler in the crowd and they
07:20
retouched his moustache to turn it into
07:22
the toothbrush mustache
07:24
that hitler later adopted oh if only we
07:26
all had photographers to retouch photos
07:29
from our news
07:30
our parents would be so thrilled
07:34
well apart from he kind of retouches the
07:36
mold to make it look like
07:38
he did when he was older it's true it's
07:40
like it's like giving yourself a mullet
07:41
in a photo from the 80s
07:42
it's really weird yeah but you you're
07:45
always ashamed of how you dress when you
07:46
were younger whether it's a weird
07:47
moustache or you've got your stupid long
07:49
hair from the 70s sorry it's not like
07:51
giving yourself a melody no no
07:52
it's like it's the opposite it's the
07:53
opposite yeah it's taking away the
07:55
mullet yes
07:56
because it's like the pope
08:00
going back to his baby photos and
08:02
putting a big hat on them
08:03
[Laughter]
08:07
did you read one of the other amazing
08:09
pieces of protocol they had to go
08:10
through that day
08:11
when britain declared war was that the
08:15
was it the foreign office sent out loads
08:16
of telegrams to all the consulates
08:17
around the world that we were vaguely
08:18
affiliated with
08:19
warning them we're about to go to war so
08:21
this is sort of in the afternoon going
08:23
on early evening
08:24
all these telegrams were sent out and
08:26
the foreign office clerks had to send
08:28
them out and all they had to do was
08:30
fill in a pre-written telegram that said
08:32
just to warn you britain is going to war
08:34
with
08:35
blank and they just wrote the word
08:36
germany because they'd had them
08:38
pre-written for about 10 years it's so
08:40
good
08:41
they just knew that they were going to
08:42
go tomorrow eventually it's like you
08:43
know when you
08:44
are a kid and you have birthday invites
08:47
and it says you are invited to
08:48
blank's party yeah like it's exactly
08:51
like that isn't it
08:53
do you think someone accidentally they
08:54
forgot to fill them in and consciously
08:55
just left guessing
08:57
i would have for a laugh put a different
08:59
country in just one telegram
09:01
just so one british territory overseas
09:03
thinks we're at war with switzerland or
09:04
something
09:05
yes yeah or do you think they sent it to
09:07
germany and it just said you
09:08
oh yeah oh yeah real privilege the most
09:11
senior clerk got to do the u1
09:14
um i was just reading generally about
09:16
what happened as soon as war was
09:18
declared and
09:19
obviously a lot of soldiers had to be
09:21
conscripted and
09:22
that led me into just looking into
09:23
conscription and i've read about this
09:25
thing which i'd not heard of i don't
09:26
know if you guys have but the pals of
09:28
italian
09:29
have you heard of that this was so
09:31
obviously they had to
09:32
work out what was the best way to get
09:34
people sort of passionate about
09:36
joining the war and one of the ideas was
09:39
the idea that if you
09:40
signed up with a friend of yours there
09:42
was a promise that you would both be
09:44
in the same battalion so professional
09:47
golfers were known to sign up with each
09:48
other
09:49
there was the grimsby chums and that was
09:51
former school boys from
09:53
winteringham secondary school in
09:54
brimston terrible idea
09:56
actually because if you're gonna go to
09:57
war and have to see all these people
09:58
around you dropping dead i'd rather they
10:00
weren't all my mates i know i guess it's
10:01
a morale thing though up until that
10:03
point
10:03
well the idea is that you might fight
10:05
harder if it's to save your friends i
10:07
think
10:07
yes there was um in thebes they had a
10:10
secret band of
10:11
um an army where they were all lovers
10:14
um all gay lovers and so they would all
10:17
be in this army together and they would
10:18
all
10:18
when was that this is in thieves in the
10:20
spartans
10:24
[Laughter]
10:25
although actually the war between sparta
10:27
and athens did go on until 1996.
10:30
what
10:33
it was one of those ones you know where
10:35
they don't sign the peace agreement yeah
10:37
and so in 1986 they signed a symbolic
10:40
agreement that sparta and athens were no
10:41
longer at war
10:42
even though that they'd both been part
10:44
of modern day greece for about a
10:45
thousand years
10:47
um so i think we may have briefly
10:48
mentioned the beric upon tweed thing
10:50
before
10:51
so there's this the town of barack on
10:52
tweed they mistakenly believed
10:55
that they were at war with russia for
10:57
about 150 years after the end of the
10:59
crimean war
11:00
so that ended 1856 and it's because
11:03
there was this really complicated
11:05
history with barrica bantui because it's
11:06
right on the border of england and
11:08
scotland
11:08
and that went it changed hands about 13
11:10
times and
11:12
there was a 1502 agreement between
11:13
england and scotland which said that
11:14
barack obama is
11:15
of but not within the kingdom of england
11:19
actually it had been sorted out in 1746
11:21
it was all fine if you didn't mention
11:22
barack obama tweed
11:23
there was no problem it was still
11:24
included but the town
11:26
no one really knew that it didn't sort
11:28
of get through so people kept naming it
11:30
in official documents
11:31
as a kind of just in case they couldn't
11:32
remember whether it was included
11:34
so so people thought that they had been
11:37
left out and that they were still at war
11:38
with russia
11:39
um and this is the really sweet thing in
11:41
2006 there was a kind of exhibition
11:43
about this in the town about this
11:44
interesting
11:45
you know kink of history and it was
11:48
beric's war was russia weekend
11:50
and apparently as part of it they had a
11:52
what if reenactment
11:54
which i think is the best surely that
11:57
the water
11:57
involves beric being flattened within 30
11:59
seconds
12:00
actually going about his business
12:04
um i was just looking a little bit of
12:05
the declaration of the second world war
12:07
and the second world war was kind of
12:09
declared by two nevilles
12:11
so it was just phil was it
12:15
it wasn't gary and phil no it was
12:17
obviously there was chamberlain but then
12:19
there was also neville henderson
12:21
he was the british ambassador in germany
12:23
so it was his job to go and actually
12:24
tell the germans that we were at war
12:26
but it might have been because of a
12:27
mistake again a little bit like this era
12:30
in 1914
12:31
so it was august the 30th in 1939 and
12:34
henderson
12:34
went and met ribbon chop who was their
12:36
hitler's foreign secretary
12:38
and apparently things got really tense
12:40
you know henderson was saying please
12:41
stop invading all these countries please
12:43
don't do the poland thing
12:44
and they came really close to blows they
12:46
almost started punching each other
12:48
and then ribbon shop said okay we're
12:50
gonna give you our last
12:52
offer we're going to give poland the
12:54
last offer and britain was obviously
12:56
basically represented poland at this
12:58
point and
12:59
so ribbon chop read over the last offer
13:01
but henderson's really pissed off with
13:02
ribbon chop at this point so he didn't
13:04
really listen
13:04
and ribbon shot read over it really
13:06
really fast sped through it apparently
13:07
and then henderson went okay fine give
13:09
me the copy and ribbon shop said no
13:11
not gonna give you the copy hope you're
13:13
paying attention and
13:15
so henderson didn't know what had just
13:17
happened didn't really know what the
13:18
offer was it was kind of deliberately
13:19
convoluted
13:20
and said and then ribbon shop said
13:22
you've got to respond by midnight
13:23
and that this confused everything and
13:25
within a couple of days
13:26
there was war wow yeah so always pay
13:30
attention
13:30
yeah i don't think that's a message
13:33
sorry
13:34
who was ripping trump
13:38
i could see you all switch off then and
13:39
we've gone to war
13:43
[Music]
13:43
[Applause]
13:47
okay it is time for fact number two and
13:49
that is james
13:50
okay my fact this week is that there's a
13:52
bacterium that can freeze water
13:55
just by touching it and these bacteria
13:58
are used to make artificial snow in ski
14:00
resorts
14:01
that's crazy it's amazing imagine how
14:04
fast
14:05
if i dropped one of these bacteria into
14:07
my glass of water
14:08
is it frozen straight away no so it
14:12
it tends to do it with plants it goes
14:14
into the into the plant cells and it
14:16
freezes the water in the plant cells so
14:18
it can access the nutrients inside the
14:20
plants
14:21
but the way that it does it is it has a
14:22
protein on the outside of the bacterium
14:24
and they can shift the molecules around
14:27
of the water
14:28
and the water then orders and like kind
14:31
of gets into a lattice into a template
14:33
which is what
14:33
ice is really and then it can also
14:35
remove heat from the water in the same
14:37
way that a refrigerator removes heat
14:39
from
14:39
the inside of it uh so it gets hotter
14:42
but it removes heat from the from the
14:44
water itself to make it into ice
14:46
and the plants don't like that
14:47
presumably the plants do not like
14:49
being killed no because actually any
14:52
frost damage that you see is usually
14:53
down to this bacteria
14:55
really yeah so if you have a plant at
14:57
say minus
14:59
four degrees minus three or four degrees
15:01
it should be fine because the water
15:03
inside it can super cool it won't turn
15:05
to ice until a little bit later than
15:06
that but if it has this bacterium in it
15:08
then the bacteria will turn the water
15:11
which would have been liquid into ice
15:13
and it can kill the plants
15:14
bastard bastard
15:17
what are the roses are saying sorry what
15:19
i found amazing is that
15:20
this is being used in artificial snow
15:23
making
15:24
as in you must have to have so many
15:27
hundreds and hundreds of millions
15:29
and billions of these bacteria to make
15:31
lots of artificial snow
15:32
how do you breed i guess they just they
15:34
just used
15:35
bacteria you just leave one alone for 20
15:39
a hours cell bacteria in a 12 hour
15:42
period
15:42
they can produce 70 billion bacteria
15:46
from a single cell bacteria it's so
15:48
quick so small isn't it because if they
15:50
were like human size
15:52
overcrowding of the world would have
15:53
happened in a second yeah definitely
15:55
and that think of all those generations
15:58
that's
15:58
one great great great great great great
16:00
great grandfather
16:01
who has 70 billion
16:08
the thing is with these guys in
16:10
particular who can turn this water into
16:12
ice
16:13
they can do it even after they're dead
16:15
wow
16:16
so the company snowmax who make this
16:18
artificial snow they get dead bacteria
16:21
because the bacteria still have the
16:22
protein on their outside
16:23
which can make the water turn into ice
16:26
even though they're not alive anymore
16:27
wow
16:28
it's not great pr line though is it
16:30
using the dead corpses
16:33
billions of well the thing is
16:36
real rain probably has these guys in it
16:38
as well so
16:39
um most real rain or snow has to have
16:42
some kind of nucleus which the water
16:44
goes around
16:44
and they think that generally speaking
16:46
it's this particular bacteria that's
16:48
most common in rain around the world
16:50
really well so it's because all rain
16:52
starts sort of frozen up there but then
16:53
how is the bacteria
16:55
not able to freeze it as well once it's
16:57
in rain formed down with us
16:58
uh yes because it'll be too warm at that
17:00
stage the bacteria only really works
17:02
around the zero mark
17:04
things are kind of freezing anyway but
17:06
you know and that's why you don't get
17:07
many
17:08
ski slopes in places like barbados
17:10
because yeah
17:11
that's right bacteria can't do it in the
17:13
heat have you guys heard of the british
17:14
gut project
17:15
no no so i was looking at microbiomes
17:18
and how
17:18
there's a theory that your bacteria in
17:20
your stomach can affect your mood so
17:22
they've done experiments on mice where
17:24
mice with no microbes in them got twice
17:26
as stressed when scientists freaked them
17:28
out as normal mice did
17:29
with normal microbiomes so a there's a
17:31
theory there but the british gut project
17:33
is this um enterprise which is trying to
17:35
map the whole
17:36
gut microbiome of the british population
17:39
and they're basically crowdsourcing poo
17:42
in the post in the post yeah but you do
17:45
have to pay
17:46
you can't just send them poo in the post
17:48
so they it's
17:49
crazy do i have to pay to put poo in the
17:51
post it's uh 75
17:53
quid but they are trying to build up
17:55
this whole picture of the nation's micro
17:57
biome health they've it's been done
17:59
tried in america already and it's really
18:01
interesting seeing a whole population's
18:03
general
18:03
health um so they're trying to sequence
18:06
the dna so they will send you a
18:07
breakdown of your own dna
18:08
but it's not going to be a good uh
18:10
method of finding out the population's
18:12
health because you're only going to get
18:12
the weirdos who are willing to sit in an
18:14
envelope and send it to a scientist
18:16
what can i also say if you're upset with
18:19
a british gut project
18:20
how do you show your displeasure because
18:22
you can't send people in the post
18:24
you send them an empty sample
18:28
so we're sending them your poo though
18:29
because i half imagine getting a thing
18:30
back going you're 50
18:32
corn you know just anything that's i
18:35
don't think that's how
18:36
sequencing dna works you know when they
18:38
say that humans and cons
18:39
sure like 75 percent of their dna is
18:42
these guys yeah
18:43
wow in china
18:47
it's smoggy i read and there are
18:50
bacteria that
18:51
live on the smog so they live inside the
18:54
smog and they can eat the smug and that
18:56
sounds like quite cool doesn't it
18:57
because maybe it gets rid of the smoke
18:59
but unfortunately they fart out even
19:01
worse chemicals
19:02
[Laughter]
19:05
so you're just replacing one police with
19:06
another do we not have another kind of
19:08
bacteria that can eat the worst
19:09
chemicals
19:10
i get the feeling that they'll find
19:11
something even worse after that
19:13
that's really funny
19:16
[Applause]
19:20
okay it is time for fact number three
19:22
and that is chozinski my fact is that
19:24
women who are applying to be
19:26
qing dynasty concubines had to spend a
19:28
night sleeping with the emperor's mother
19:30
first so that she could check they
19:32
didn't snore
19:35
yeah this is so the selection process to
19:37
be a concubine was
19:39
so arduous and there were so many steps
19:40
to it this is actually in this amazing
19:43
thing that's on the south it's been
19:44
published by the south china morning
19:46
post but
19:46
it's in collaboration with the forbidden
19:48
palace museum and i would so recommend
19:50
it they've done a series of chapters
19:51
detailing life in the forbidden city and
19:54
this is about yeah so there were these
19:55
concubines who lived in the forbidden
19:57
city
19:57
with the emperor and to become one you
20:00
had to well first of all
20:02
every every single manchu woman in the
20:04
kingdom had to
20:05
apply to become a concubine so you
20:07
weren't allowed to marry until you'd
20:08
applied to check the emperor didn't want
20:10
to marry you
20:10
uh this was all girls between 13 and 16
20:13
and they did this sort of call
20:14
out every three years and then they'd
20:16
come and god knows how they whittled it
20:18
down from that many but they whittled it
20:20
down to about a hundred
20:21
who would be monitored really really
20:23
carefully by all these females already
20:25
in the forbidden city so for things like
20:27
um ins weird skin abnormalities body
20:30
odor
20:31
they were really strict on body odor um
20:34
and anything else that might be wrong
20:35
with them
20:36
and then they will whittle down to
20:37
finalists who are kind of taught like a
20:38
finishing school how to be pretty much
20:40
like the x factor isn't it right it is
20:41
so
20:42
x factor yeah although they don't do the
20:44
body holder thing
20:46
to spend the night sleeping next to
20:47
simon carroll
20:50
but i know how they whittled it down it
20:53
was it was in that
20:54
brilliant piece um so in the ming
20:56
dynasty which was the one just before
20:58
yes we've got records of how they
20:59
whittled it down so they picked
21:02
five thousand young women and then they
21:03
eliminated a thousand on the first day
21:05
for being too
21:06
short or tall or fat or thin and the
21:08
second day they got rid of another two
21:09
thousand based on their voices
21:11
and general manner you've got two
21:13
thousand left well that is actually like
21:14
x factor isn't it yes
21:16
it's true um third day they got rid of
21:18
another thousand because their hands or
21:20
feet weren't right
21:21
i haven't seen i haven't seen the x
21:22
factor but i don't think that's that
21:24
phases in there so you've got a thousand
21:26
left
21:26
yeah because foot inspection was a
21:28
massive thing yeah back then
21:30
so important yeah then you've got a
21:31
thousand left and then you have
21:32
gynecological examinations which
21:34
apparently get rid of another 700
21:36
wow i do not know how i gotta say i kind
21:38
of at this stage wish i'd been
21:40
kicked out for being too tall short
21:44
and then you have a month of testing for
21:45
the remaining 300.
21:47
yeah but in that final month is it right
21:49
that they get taught sort of incredible
21:51
skills that they might not
21:52
have learned painting reading and
21:55
walking it's very much
21:59
one of those skills that you'd never
22:00
learn unless you're in the
22:02
palace who walked back into your village
22:04
you've changed
22:08
everyone else still rolling around
22:11
oh she thinks she's so off herself this
22:14
was that was there was a book that was
22:15
saying they were
22:16
taught to have they had to have dainty
22:18
feet and they were taught to have a
22:19
titillating walk yeah
22:21
had to be titillating um but yeah and
22:23
sleeping next to the mother the mother
22:25
was
22:25
the final hurdle you had to cross and
22:27
she was the most senior woman
22:29
[Laughter]
22:32
how many do you know got through to that
22:34
final phase uh
22:35
i think the finalists there were ten i
22:37
think or maybe there were five at that
22:38
point but we were down to a manageable
22:40
number because the mother doesn't have
22:42
you know she's the there's only one
22:43
emperor's mum so she can't spend all her
22:45
time
22:46
unless she sleeps with them all at the
22:47
same time but then how do you know who's
22:49
snoring
22:50
yeah oh yes you just blame it on the
22:52
person next to you
22:53
and it was to check for things like
22:54
sleep walking or sleep talking or body
22:56
odors again she had to be very careful
22:58
with
22:59
and then you passed but a lot of girls
23:00
didn't want pass obviously because it
23:02
meant that you had to abandon your
23:03
village and your family and all your
23:04
friends and live forever
23:06
in this massive forbidden city with this
23:07
creepy old man so
23:09
yeah he might not come and see you
23:10
though because weren't there lots of
23:12
concubines yeah some of them had tons
23:14
didn't they
23:15
yeah you had different levels you had
23:17
your base level concubine and it went to
23:18
higher rankings all the way up to you're
23:20
the empress
23:21
boss level yeah exactly and there were
23:24
about 20
23:24
000 by the ting dynasty 20 000
23:26
concubines concubines consorts
23:28
um yeah blimey where are they 20 000
23:31
women in the forbidden city
23:32
some women i'm just trying to work out
23:35
the timings of this
23:37
well how how like let's say how many how
23:40
many people have sex with in that amount
23:42
of time
23:42
goddess yeah you know to be right well
23:45
they did have
23:45
they did have problems with that there
23:46
was one emperor called emperor wu not
23:48
part of the qing but he had
23:50
5 000 women uh too many to either
23:53
remember who he
23:54
actually wanted to sleep with but he
23:57
knew that they were all very pretty so
23:58
what he used to do was
24:00
go around in a cart that was carried by
24:01
goats and when the goats got tired
24:03
wherever they parked that's who he
24:05
went and had sex with that night yeah
24:08
surely there's an easier way to remember
24:10
who you fancy he fancied them all i
24:12
think that's
24:13
the idea is the concubines he just
24:14
thought they're all very beautiful so
24:16
wherever the goats stop
24:17
uh that's where i'll get off and some of
24:19
the concubines
24:22
and many of the concubines actually did
24:24
want to have relations with them because
24:26
maybe
24:27
you'd have children and you they would
24:28
become empress exactly so what they used
24:30
to do was leave little bits of treats
24:32
outside the door
24:34
to trick them into stopping wow
24:37
and then there's other ones who because
24:39
they wanted to make sure that there was
24:41
um not too much jealousy amongst the
24:43
concubines because
24:44
if you slept with one of the concubines
24:46
that raised her level and suddenly
24:48
your surrounding concubines might get a
24:49
bit too jealous um and fights break out
24:51
and so on
24:52
um they used to have a rotation calendar
24:54
that was done for certain emperors
24:56
so they would make sure that you never
24:57
slept with the same concubine in the
24:59
same week
25:00
or something like that you know and we
25:01
have written records of that
25:03
i so i read on this website um anna that
25:05
you were talking about that in the 10th
25:07
century calendars were used to keep
25:08
track of the
25:09
sex life rather than of day-to-day life
25:12
it was so
25:13
closely monitored is that yeah you're
25:15
not saying i'll meet you on the 29th of
25:17
the emperor's shagging rachel
25:21
and i think we should bring it back with
25:23
our royal family
25:26
yeah there was a branch of the imperial
25:28
government that was set up in the 1670s
25:31
called
25:31
uh the office of respectful service and
25:33
this was to
25:35
formalize that really and make sure
25:36
secretaries were installed to keep tabs
25:38
on the sexual
25:39
activities and so every single concubine
25:42
that visited the bedroom they'd have to
25:43
take note of it they'd have to find out
25:45
what actually happened in there
25:46
because again the ranking system yeah
25:48
what happened
25:50
um i found this interesting apparently
25:52
there was only one
25:54
monogamous uh chinese emperor who was
25:56
called hong-ji
25:57
and he was only monogamous because he
25:59
was extremely close to his mother and
26:00
then his mother was murdered by a
26:02
concubine
26:03
so that rather put him off the idea of
26:05
concubinage
26:06
yeah except the one presumably oh i
26:10
think he took a wife he took a wife
26:12
they could do that sometimes couldn't
26:13
they concubize there was um an emperor
26:15
called
26:16
jia zhing which i'm sure i'm pronouncing
26:18
wrong but um
26:19
18 of his concubines kind of ganged up
26:21
on him and tried to kill him they drove
26:23
hairpins into his crotch and they
26:25
wrapped a silk cord around his neck and
26:27
tried to
26:28
strangle him wow the guy with a
26:30
clipboard in the corner saying i know
26:32
what i recorded have heavy heavy petting
26:41
well um the empress empress fang then
26:43
had all the conspirators killed
26:45
they're all executed uh but jia zhing
26:49
he decided to move out of the imperial
26:50
palace and became a daoist magician
26:54
who um spent his whole life having sex
26:56
with virgins and drinking magic potions
26:59
made from bodily fluids
27:00
wow affected him quite badly yeah is
27:04
that
27:04
and that counts as being a magician
27:06
because i'd be disappointed if i went to
27:07
a magic show and all he did was drink
27:09
blood and urine and have sex with
27:10
virgins
27:12
you've clearly never been to a david
27:13
blaine
27:16
i think the magic was other stuff right
27:18
did he
27:19
did he stay as emperor he did but
27:21
basically he just ignored all of his
27:22
duties that he was supposed to do his
27:24
emperor and did all this magic and
27:26
stuff is so annoying if the emperor's
27:28
got a magic show he's constantly
27:30
trying to show you another trick we are
27:33
at war with four separate groups of
27:34
people could we
27:35
have some decisions please pick a card
27:42
just on eunuchs so because they were the
27:44
other group of people that were allowed
27:46
in the forbidden city you couldn't have
27:47
men with their parts because then they
27:49
might impregnate the women
27:51
um so there are thousands and thousands
27:52
of eunuchs and it was actually a good
27:54
gig because it's the only way you can
27:56
work really um close to the emperor and
27:58
his government
27:59
but i think there was there was one
28:00
drawback wasn't that
28:02
the application process it was uh yeah
28:05
yeah a bit tedious
28:06
imagine if they chopped your off
28:08
and then they said but sorry you snot
28:13
but the way they did it was they put you
28:16
on a chair with a hole in the seat
28:18
oh really and then you just whip
28:20
something underneath it and it's gone
28:22
it's i mean it was the was it the
28:24
testicles that were it was there was
28:25
the holes for the hole yes yeah you
28:27
gotta get rid of it yeah
28:29
and i think we've said they used to then
28:30
have to carry them around in a pouch
28:32
we've mentioned before which they were
28:33
proud of
28:34
the last eunuch of china um fell out
28:36
with his family
28:37
uh when they threw his genitals away the
28:39
eunuch um
28:40
never spoke to his family again i think
28:42
that's fair enough i would be so annoyed
28:44
if my mum threw away a body part of mine
28:46
yes
28:48
on or off when you go back to visit your
28:50
parents and they've like changed your
28:52
bedroom and they
28:53
turned it into a study or something
28:54
that's really upsetting yeah that's true
28:57
but so the reason they threw it away is
29:00
because
29:00
during the cultural revolution there was
29:02
a whole thing about you need to discard
29:04
anything that was seen as old society
29:06
and if you had anything that was old
29:08
society yeah you put your whole family
29:10
at risk because you own something
29:12
from the so they saw his his genitals as
29:14
part of that
29:15
tradition yeah so they threw it away and
29:17
the amazing thing about his life he
29:18
this guy sonia tang the last eunuch he
29:20
died in 1996.
29:21
yeah wow this is really recent history
29:24
yeah
29:24
well konku binage i don't know how you
29:26
pronounce that word but concubinage
29:28
concubinage
29:29
was only banned in hong kong in 1972.
29:32
wow
29:33
and it's still not uncommon i think it's
29:35
not as frowned upon
29:36
to have lots of mistresses in other
29:38
parts of china and there's a
29:40
saying in china well someone who's
29:42
chinese on the internet said we've got a
29:43
popular saying
29:45
which explains why chinese men need
29:46
multiple women but women are expected to
29:49
just have one man and it goes one teapot
29:52
is usually accompanied by four cups
29:54
but have you ever seen one cup with four
29:56
teapots
29:57
sounds similar to something i have seen
29:59
on the internet but
30:01
[Laughter]
30:04
two concubines completely different
30:08
but equally profound meaning to that
30:10
concubing sounds like a
30:13
netflix kind of it's not binging
30:17
just sounds like you're chucking them
30:18
out oh well there is a good argument for
30:21
concubinjin because
30:22
there's a new tv show in china which is
30:24
about yanchi palace
30:26
and it's hugely popular it's the most
30:29
googled tv show of the year 2018 despite
30:32
the fact that google is largely banned
30:33
in china
30:34
that's how hugely popular it is all
30:36
across asia lots of other countries as
30:38
well
30:38
it's been streamed 15 billion times and
30:41
it's about
30:42
the rivalry between concubines in the
30:45
forbidden city it's
30:46
so concubine is actually a perfect word
30:48
for watching the show 15 billion that
30:50
means everyone on earth on average has
30:52
watched it twice
30:53
i know that's yeah i'm just saying it's
30:57
a lot it's a lot
30:59
but i guess there are i haven't seen it
31:01
so someone's watched at least three
31:02
times yeah
31:04
i've watched it two million times
31:08
i think there are just a billion people
31:09
in asia a billion people in china aren't
31:11
there
31:11
1.3 yeah and more outside that
31:14
but we're still within asia yeah asia's
31:17
population
31:18
is very high i shouldn't have been
31:21
surprised that 15 billion
31:23
it's a lot it's i get i mean how many
31:25
people have in asia is it about four
31:26
billion
31:27
it's a very large included in india
31:30
oh no cheating no i'm including india
31:33
all right then five
31:35
yeah 1.3 billion in china 1.3 billion in
31:38
india
31:39
probably about 100 million in bangladesh
31:41
or something
31:42
right indonesia it's another biggie but
31:44
they've still all seen it more than
31:45
twice
31:46
that's the amazing thing even all of
31:47
these people you know how do they get
31:49
anything done all this china so
31:50
productive
31:51
constantly watching this thing
31:55
[Applause]
31:58
okay it's time for our final fact of the
32:00
show and that is my fact
32:02
my fact this week is that some meteors
32:05
skim off the earth as if they were a
32:07
stone
32:08
skimming across the waters that's very
32:11
good
32:12
who is throwing them yes
32:15
i know i've made that a bit more poetic
32:16
and probably scientists listening are
32:18
thinking you dick that's not what they
32:19
do
32:20
so but they don't skim off the earth if
32:22
you count the earth as the ground that
32:23
we walk on do they
32:24
no exactly that would be incredibly the
32:26
best factor we've ever done
32:28
if no one knew that what this is is um
32:32
this is meteorologist if the detail that
32:34
came to kill the dinosaurs just went
32:38
straight back into space that would be
32:40
extraordinary
32:41
now what this is is we obviously um we
32:43
have an atmosphere and the atmosphere
32:46
is what burns up when we call a meteor a
32:48
meteorite it's because it goes through a
32:50
layer of the atmosphere it's very cold
32:52
burns it up and then that lands on the
32:54
earth sometimes when a meteor
32:56
comes into the earth's atmosphere it's
32:57
on such an angle almost a parallel angle
33:00
to
33:00
the earth's atmosphere that it just
33:03
bounces off they're called earth grazers
33:04
they don't make it down further they
33:07
literally get a lift a boost off the
33:09
atmosphere pushing it back up
33:10
sometimes slowing at speed but it makes
33:12
it back out and just hurdles back into
33:14
space imagine if you could skim it
33:16
off the earth and then off mars and then
33:18
yeah
33:19
wouldn't that be extraordinary but yeah
33:21
there's we've only we know that it
33:23
happens a lot and a lot of people have
33:24
seen it with the naked eye but we
33:25
haven't actually recorded too many of
33:27
these
33:27
um i believe in 2006 was only the fourth
33:30
time that we've ever caught on camera
33:32
what is known as the earth grazers the
33:34
ones that come in and skim off so what
33:36
does it look when you see it with
33:37
what with the naked eye does it look
33:38
like a meteor but it just doesn't burn
33:40
up
33:41
no it does burn up so it it you see the
33:43
flaming
33:44
meteorites as it were coming in but
33:46
because of the angle it suddenly just
33:47
takes a turn and heads off
33:49
but do you see it take a turn then with
33:50
the naked eye i guess what you see is
33:53
the flame go out you just see you yeah
33:55
you see it's streaking across the sky
33:57
yeah and then kind of finishing is it
33:59
right to say then that it comes in and
34:01
it goes very slightly into the earth's
34:03
atmosphere
34:04
and then bounces out again so when it's
34:06
in the earth's atmosphere that's when
34:07
it's burning up and that's what you see
34:09
but then it disappears
34:10
exactly so in um 2006 there was one
34:13
uh it was just it was a bright fireball
34:15
as what you would have seen in the sky
34:16
and this was seen over japan
34:18
um and it made it uh to 55 miles from
34:22
the earth's surface
34:23
wow so that it gets really close and
34:25
then it just looked down and thought no
34:27
yeah all right mate these guys look lame
34:30
yeah so it was it was there for 35
34:32
seconds so you could see it
34:33
and um yeah so and then it just
34:36
disappears back out into
34:37
back into space and the distance is
34:39
crazy this is actually
34:40
um related to that although not about
34:42
meteors but with spaceships
34:44
that same effect is a major concern they
34:46
have when bringing spaceships
34:48
back to earth so one of the hardest
34:49
things if you're controlling a spaceship
34:51
is re-entering
34:52
because you have to get the angle at
34:53
which you re-enter completely spot-on
34:56
and if you go at too sharp an angle then
34:58
you're going to
34:59
fast and there's too much friction and
35:01
then you burn up but if you're going at
35:02
too shallow an angle if it is really
35:04
shallow
35:05
then again there's this wrist because
35:06
the earth is a sphere
35:08
that you'll sort of skim across the
35:10
atmosphere uh but then come back off
35:12
and miss it yeah just miss the earth
35:14
you'd have thought it's a big enough
35:15
target
35:17
so one of the biggest problems with
35:18
apollo 13 as they came round from the
35:20
other side of the moon
35:22
was on top of everything else is that
35:24
because their instruments were down
35:25
that exact thing was going to happen to
35:27
them they were not on the right
35:28
trajectory to come back into earth
35:30
so they had to make a thrust basically
35:33
with the naked eye with the earth
35:34
in the distance using that as a target
35:36
to get themselves back into
35:38
the right position otherwise that might
35:41
have happened to them
35:42
although i've read a few things and
35:43
maybe james you know more about this
35:45
about
35:46
things wouldn't really bounce off the
35:48
earth you don't just bounce it off into
35:49
the distance of course not
35:50
yeah so there's no spring that you can
35:53
hit
35:54
there's no solidity in the earth but
35:56
it's just the fact that the earth
35:58
is circular so the earth was flat which
35:59
some people argue
36:02
here we go i cut this out every week
36:10
it's just that it can't get through
36:12
those dense layers so it effectively
36:14
goes straight
36:14
but because the earth is a curve then it
36:17
comes straight off it again
36:18
there's another kind of uh quite cool
36:20
earth grazing thing that you can watch
36:22
um a few people have been lucky to see
36:24
it it's called a meteor procession
36:26
this is really cool so when it does come
36:28
into that zone of the atmosphere where
36:29
it starts heating up
36:30
often a meteor will break into little
36:32
bits and that's sometimes when we see
36:34
meteor showers and so on
36:36
um it's why you see so many so what will
36:38
happen is this meteor will come in it'll
36:40
start breaking up into bits but still
36:42
enough of it is there to head back out
36:44
into space and not come down
36:46
however it will now be about 10 of them
36:48
that will fly back off into space
36:50
so you'll just see what looks like
36:52
because they're all on the same
36:53
trajectory
36:54
just like an arab show a procession
36:56
going overview flying over
36:57
flaming balls wow yeah it's kind of like
37:00
a meteor shower
37:01
in a way which is always fun and i
37:02
didn't realize that i think this is
37:04
going to be one of those things that i
37:05
it's unbelievable i didn't know but i
37:06
didn't know that um
37:08
meteor showers happened so regularly
37:10
like at the same time every single year
37:12
and that they're all named after the
37:13
constellation they come from which is
37:15
nice so
37:16
you've got orionids or geminids and
37:18
there are 112 meteor showers every year
37:21
always happen at the same time um
37:22
because it's where the earth just
37:24
intersects with the comet tail at the
37:25
same time and i guess over
37:26
many thousands of years then it changes
37:28
as the comet moves away
37:30
but uh i didn't really know that and the
37:32
how do you say is it the perseid
37:34
or the per it's a perseid meteor shower
37:36
that people might have seen
37:38
um that is called i just quite like this
37:40
origin of what it's called it's usually
37:41
referred to as the tears of saint
37:43
lawrence
37:44
and that is after saint lawrence who is
37:46
that christian
37:47
deacon who the romans burned him in
37:50
ad258 and he's the one who
37:52
you know they put him on a on a barbecue
37:54
roasted him on a bbq
37:56
and then he apparently according to
37:58
legend was the guy that said i'm already
38:00
roasted on one side if you would have me
38:02
well cooked it is time to turn me on to
38:03
the other
38:05
it's such a good it's a great story it's
38:06
so lovely what he actually said was ah
38:11
well that's that in latin i've got a
38:13
religious
38:14
uh connection to all this too um so
38:17
there is an argument
38:18
it's only an argument and we'll never
38:20
know the truth but there's an argument
38:21
that
38:22
um there's a bit in the bible where
38:23
saint paul has a conversion he's on the
38:25
road to damascus
38:26
he's called something else for that and
38:27
then he becomes paul he's called saul
38:30
and then he
38:30
and saul becomes paul so there is an
38:33
argument that he just saw a meteor
38:34
because and the account there are there
38:36
are several different accounts of it he
38:38
sees a big flash
38:39
i think exactly he says it's brighter
38:40
than the sun tick it can be brighter
38:42
than the sun
38:42
uh he fell over tick that would happen
38:45
um why
38:46
well there's it can be a shock wave if a
38:47
meteor arrives oh okay
38:49
oh really he also says he had a big
38:51
noise uh yeah
38:53
and he was blinded which could happen
38:55
well but do you know that but that's an
38:57
also could be a truck
38:58
couldn't it no i didn't write lights
39:01
yeah falls over
39:02
tick loud noise tick that's true and it
39:05
would have been more miraculous in a way
39:06
to produce a truck
39:07
at that time hey just speaking of um
39:11
that idea you said of it's not as crazy
39:13
as a meteorite hitting the earth
39:15
surface itself and bouncing off oh yeah
39:17
there is
39:18
a mars 2.5 million years ago
39:22
a rock left the surface of mars shot out
39:26
into space then in 1962
39:29
that rock finally landed on earth as a
39:32
meteorite
39:33
in uh nigeria in zagami and it's known
39:36
as the zagami
39:37
meteorite and sometime soon in the
39:40
future
39:40
that very same bit of meteorite is going
39:42
to become a meteorite again
39:44
except this time back on mars because in
39:47
1996
39:48
we put some of that meteorite back onto
39:50
a ship
39:51
so we've relaunched it out of our planet
39:54
and it's part of the mars global
39:55
surveyor which has been going around
39:57
mars but we've lost contact with
39:59
so very soon that satellite is going to
40:01
go into
40:02
it's going to be sucked in by the orbit
40:03
of mars it's going to be so pissed off
40:05
imagine if you're like i've traveled for
40:06
2.5 million years to get away from that
40:09
place and you've literally just put me
40:10
straight back
40:11
yeah that's true that's incredible
40:12
though that's a very cool fact
40:14
yeah it's like a cool poetic justice
40:16
isn't it
40:17
i think it's amazing how these rocks get
40:20
from one place to another
40:21
like for instance when the dinosaur
40:23
asteroid came down
40:25
it comes down it breaks through the
40:27
atmosphere
40:28
um basically pushes all the atmosphere
40:30
out of the way causes a vacuum and so
40:31
when it hits the ground and loads of
40:33
rocks come up they all get sucked into
40:34
space
40:35
oh wow and that so you could
40:37
theoretically have some rocks from the
40:39
dinosaur rage that have since made it
40:41
onto the moon and there could
40:42
theoretically be dinosaur
40:44
fossils on the moon like probably not
40:47
but
40:48
theoretically it could be there was an
40:49
article about this recently yeah
40:52
there's a piece of rock that they're
40:53
they think maybe it's from earth but
40:55
they can't they need to do more testing
40:57
in fact
40:57
that one you are talking about i think
40:59
they do that like you say they're not
41:01
sure but they're pretty sure it is from
41:02
the earth because
41:03
it was the way you can tell it how it
41:05
was formed and it was formed in a way
41:07
that either it's from the earth or they
41:08
have to change the way
41:09
that their history of the moon is right
41:12
because they think it
41:13
couldn't have come up to the surface of
41:14
the moon in the right time so it's a bit
41:16
complicated
41:17
but yeah that could be the oldest known
41:19
earth rock and they found it on the moon
41:24
it's about four billion years old it's
41:26
incredible except
41:27
is it because they they brought it back
41:28
to earth they must have done that yeah
41:29
it came on apollo 14 i think what are
41:31
the odds of bringing back
41:32
did you come back did you come back with
41:34
some moon samples we've got some bad
41:35
news
41:36
we feel so stupid probably that
41:38
spaceship
41:39
crossed with the martian one and the two
41:40
rocks waved at each other going back
41:42
home
41:42
yeah going back home what have we got
41:44
such strict immigration laws in the
41:46
universe we keep on sending foreign
41:48
rocks back where they came from
41:49
no wonder conspiracy theorists don't
41:51
think we went the only rocks we've got
41:53
are from here
41:56
can i just say one thing about just
41:58
about the tunguska so the tunguska event
42:00
was this
42:01
massive explosion in 1908 it was so big
42:04
it cast light over the whole world
42:06
and at the time the night the night
42:08
skies glowed so brightly that people in
42:10
asia which we know is heavily populated
42:13
probably quite a lot of people
42:14
um people in asia read their newspapers
42:18
outdoors at midnight
42:19
and apparently at least one golfer got
42:21
in a round at 2 30 in the morning in
42:23
saint andrews of scotland
42:25
it's amazing that's you that's the 1908
42:28
version of you jack
42:29
does it look like the world's ending
42:31
here wow i think i could get
42:33
in there so
42:36
a meteor heading towards the earth if
42:38
it's a smallish size
42:40
we would call that let's say a meteor
42:42
meteoroid meteorite in the earth
42:44
if it was bigger it's an asteroid right
42:45
so it's a sight thing okay
42:47
so in movies whenever we try to prevent
42:50
an asteroid from hitting the earth
42:51
they always send up some kind of big
42:53
nuclear device to blow it up
42:55
and um there's so many plans going on
42:58
with nasa and independent bodies of
43:00
scientists who are trying to work out
43:01
the best way to stop
43:02
potential asteroids from hitting the
43:04
earth and um
43:05
there's some that want to wrap it in a
43:07
sail and sort of sail it in a different
43:08
direction
43:10
but one thing i read is they don't ever
43:12
really want to go for the nuclear option
43:13
because
43:14
obviously you blow it up and then
43:15
suddenly you're sending a lot of rocks
43:17
to earth
43:18
but what i didn't realize is they're
43:20
nuclear rocks now
43:21
so you've made them radioactive so you
43:23
would actually
43:24
just make the whole situation doubly
43:26
worse by spreading radiation everywhere
43:29
where it hit i mean we have this
43:30
ridiculous policy where we can't bring a
43:32
strand of hair into space in case it
43:33
infects mars and i can't believe
43:35
i'm considering sending radioactive
43:38
rocks out into space yeah i think the
43:40
key would be to push it wouldn't it
43:41
that's the current best theory because
43:43
there's a there's a guy at nasa who's
43:44
called the planetary protection officer
43:47
he's an awesome guy but he's very low
43:50
key about the whole thing so his name is
43:51
lindley johnson
43:52
and he's responsible for it basically
43:54
he's only got eight members of staff
43:55
so if we get hit by an asteroid is it
43:57
his fault effectively
44:00
but he was asked about it he said do you
44:02
feel a lot of pressure being the
44:03
planetary protection officer
44:05
and he said it doesn't stress me out
44:06
that much yeah
44:08
well i want someone to be a bit more
44:10
actually because
44:12
who does he answer to if we do get all
44:14
annihilated by an asteroid
44:17
he's going to go into the cockroach's
44:19
office
44:21
and cockroaches will say well done
44:24
you've been working for us all this time
44:28
[Music]
44:31
okay that is it that is all of our facts
44:33
thank you so much for listening
44:34
if you would like to get in contact with
44:36
any of us about the things that we have
44:37
said over the course of this podcast we
44:39
can be found on our twitter accounts i'm
44:41
on at schreiberland
44:42
james james harkin andy at andrew hunter
44:45
m and chezinski
44:46
you can email podcast qi.com yep or you
44:49
can go to our group account
44:50
at no such thing you can also go to no
44:52
such thing as a fish.com
44:53
we have all of our previous episodes up
44:55
there we also have links to our tour
44:57
we're gonna be touring all around the uk
44:59
in march we're gonna ireland as well
45:01
please get some tickets we hope to see
45:03
you there we'll be back again next week

45:06
we'll see you then goodbye
45:22
you

=256
00:00
hey everybody welcome to this week's
00:02
episode of fish we wanted to start by
00:04
letting you know that qi
00:05
has released a new game for phones
00:09
a phone game sorry not it's for humans
00:11
but it's on its own
00:12
phones and it's called get fact that is
00:15
a rude name
00:16
it's rude get fact think about it dan
00:19
think
00:20
i can't the penny hasn't dropped yet but
00:22
he'll find out sooner or later
00:23
uh so it was released all over the world
00:25
yesterday basically it's like candy
00:26
crush except you're playing with facts
00:28
instead of with coloured
00:30
baubles i've never played candy crush
00:31
but i think that's what you do
00:34
it's full of facts it's really
00:35
interesting and you can play
00:37
increasing your skill and your knowledge
00:40
which is the whole point of life after
00:41
all
00:42
yeah also a quick cheat when you get to
00:45
level 71 the answer is dear testicles
00:49
i always put that in exams that's cool
00:51
whenever i didn't know the answer and it
00:53
very rarely worked
00:54
but i wasn't playing level 71. uh if
00:56
you'd like to get hold of it you can go
00:57
to
00:58
the apple ios app store and type in the
01:00
word get fact
01:01
all one word get fact there will be an
01:03
android version in a few weeks we are
01:05
assured
01:06
that's right and now the other thing is
01:08
that we are also going
01:10
on tour what yep in literally a couple
01:12
of weeks
01:13
why haven't you told me this because
01:14
you're better on the hoof you know
01:16
we like to just throw you into it uh
01:18
we're going on tour it's going to be
01:19
great fun we're going all over the uk
01:21
and we're going to the republic of
01:22
ireland
01:23
it's going to be a crazy night there's
01:24
going to be a really fun first off and
01:25

01:32
wait to get back on the road andy now
01:33
that he knows is excited as well
01:35
now if you want to get tickets to it go
01:37
to no such thing as a fish.com
01:39
live and there'll be links there to
01:41
whichever venue you need to go to and to
01:42
ticketmaster
01:43
hopefully see you there and do get
01:46
yourself the get fact app
01:47
oh that is so rude rude on with the show
01:50
on with the show
01:56
[Music]
02:02
[Applause]
02:05
[Music]
02:06
hello and welcome to another episode of
02:09
no such thing as a fish
02:10
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
02:12
qi offices in covent garden
02:14
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
02:16
here with james harkin
02:18
andrew hunter murray and anna jaczynski
02:20
and once again we have gathered around
02:22
the microphones with our four
02:23
favorite facts from the last seven days
02:25
and in no particular order
02:27
here we go starting with back number one
02:31
and that's you anna my fact this week is
02:34
that harvard business school
02:36
recommends companies locate their
02:38
headquarters in rainier places
02:40
because it makes employees more
02:41
productive
02:44
and that's why our output is so massive
02:45
here yes
02:48
this actually goes against what people
02:49
think so they as part of the same study
02:51
or a similar one
02:53
they asked people what they thought what
02:55
effect they thought bad weather would
02:56
have on productivity
02:57
80 of people said they thought it would
02:59
decrease it turned out they did this big
03:01
study in a tokyo bank
03:03
and they found that employees processed
03:05
loan applications
03:06
much faster so that's something that
03:08
requires a lot of focus and
03:09
concentration
03:10
much faster and more quickly on rainy
03:12
days than sunny ones
03:13
and it was because when they
03:14
investigated it that nice weather causes
03:17
more cognitive distractions
03:18
i.e people sit in their offices
03:20
fantasizing about what else they could
03:22
be doing
03:22
yeah they worked out was the effect is
03:24
so great that if it's a sunny day versus
03:25
when it's rainy that
03:27
937 thousand dollars is what they would
03:30
have made
03:30
if it was continuously rainy basically
03:32
this particular yeah
03:33
yeah this depends on the size of the
03:35
business it's not like you could have an
03:36
ice cream van and you'll make a million
03:38
quid
03:38
yeah especially not when it rains
03:42
i think in actual fact um ice cream fans
03:45
is one of the few businesses where sun
03:47
is
03:47
better well this doesn't all go well for
03:49
my wealth chain of ice cream fans does
03:51
it
03:51
but weirdly my sister and brother-in-law
03:54
had they've just left abu dhabi but they
03:55
had a
03:56
they had an ice cream business out there
03:58
as a side business
03:59
and it was a little ice cream shop by
04:01
the beach and they couldn't operate it
04:02
in summer it's so
04:03
hot in abu dhabi it can only function in
04:06
the winter because it all melts
04:07
yeah it's just too hot outside it gets
04:08
up to 50. but sure is it the
04:10
is it that people don't really go
04:12
outside yeah yeah right okay so it's not
04:14
like the ice cream melts
04:15
well that's not like if you buy an ice
04:17
cream it instantly vaporizes
04:20
i demand another where is this one
04:24
um one thing i found is uh so this was
04:26
from the same uh article that this came
04:28
from which is i really like this
04:30
campbell soup that company they
04:32
advertise based on the weather
04:34
so when the weather is bad in particular
04:36
cities they buy more advertising space
04:38
because they know that people will want
04:40
cosy warming
04:41
food it's a great idea so like a nice
04:43
thick country vegetable soup on cold
04:45
days exactly
04:46
and maybe a light broth or some gaspa
04:49
on a hot day a thin mist of ice cream
04:53
that's brilliant it's weird it's so cool
04:55
and when it's cold and everyone has flu
04:56
they could have chicken soup because
04:58
everyone likes
04:58
they have a flu index as well do they
05:00
yeah so they made yeah they made a thing
05:02
so the thing andy's talking about is
05:03
called the misery index
05:05
and for them it's actually a happiness
05:07
index because it means more sales
05:09
when the misery index goes up by five
05:12
percent
05:13
then they queue a chicken soup advert on
05:15
the radio
05:16
and then that was so successful they've
05:17
got a flu index now so as soon as
05:19
there's a flu outbreak
05:20
that's wow that's really good they must
05:22
be praying for
05:23
spanish flu to come back or something
05:26
they're not evil no you're right they're
05:28
just selling soup you know uh if it's
05:30
very rainy
05:31
uh there's what type of business it's
05:32
actually good for umbrellas
05:34
ponchos yeah oh i've um i've
05:47
you make a million more dollars a year
05:49
if you take photographs in the rain
05:53
newspaper editors the world over get me
05:55
some puddle photographs
05:56
[Laughter]
05:58
i was actually talking post rain uh oh
06:00
yeah um
06:02
rain in the towers towels to dry to dry
06:05
to dry things how's it good yeah no
06:06
helicopter
06:08
businesses do very well particularly uh
06:11
for orchards
06:12
because when there's huge amount of
06:13
rainfall certain things certain
06:15
vegetables or and grapes get so
06:16
saturated that they need to get the
06:18
water out immediately so they hire
06:19
helicopters in and cherry orchards will
06:22
have helicopters just hovering over them
06:24
and drying off all of the grounds uh
06:27
yeah to get it back on the road so it's
06:29
really cool the helicopter business
06:31
um do you know the kind of weather that
06:33
one study found is the only type of
06:34
weather that really has an impact on
06:36
your mood
06:37
um what so i can give you the the
06:39
weather categories
06:40
or do you want to make it no no the
06:43
earth is hit by a meteorite
06:44
yes reign of um you know metal falling
06:47
from the sky firestorms
06:48
people don't mind at all they just go
06:50
about their day
06:51
we're very stubborn okay give us some
06:53
options uh so this is a study in the
06:55
1980s and
06:57
it found the best predictor of mood uh
06:59
was in a certain type of weather the
07:00
options are
07:01
that they looked at sunniness
07:03
temperature raininess
07:05
wind humidity and
07:08
and it's not going to be the last one
07:10
can i bet
07:11
on the last one can i bet that it is the
07:12
last one which i think is missed
07:14
because i think missed always affects my
07:16
mood very much
07:18
it sort of just makes me feel spooky
07:20
yeah you know you look along you can't
07:22
see anything it's a bit spooky that's
07:23
true yes
07:24
it's quite exciting you feel like you're
07:25
in a victorian novel yeah so that's the
07:27
main effect that i think i'm going to
07:29
say it's wind
07:31
uh because it makes me feel more
07:33
agitated
07:35
because the molecules around me are so
07:37
agitated they
07:38
kind of somehow make me feel a bit on
07:41
edge yeah i get that i think it's got to
07:42
be one of these too
07:43
i'm going for sunniness sunniness makes
07:45
me a [ __ ] that's why i had to leave
07:47
australia
07:49
i was a right [ __ ] over there but now
07:51
i'm i'm sort of a bit more calm but like
07:53
in a horrible mood when it's way too hot
07:54
do you yeah oh no so you're not talking
07:56
about sunniness you're talking about
07:57
temperature
07:58
oh yeah right because it could be sunny
08:00
it's sunny today for instance it's a
08:02
beautiful sun that's true
08:03
okay so he has been a bit of an [ __ ]
08:04
today how do you explain that i was just
08:07
getting a bit of a tricky thing okay
08:08
so yeah so well you've listed almost all
08:11
the things except the one that it is
08:13
humidity was found to be the only one
08:15
that has a significant impact on
08:17
activity and mood and
08:18
it's because people feel very sleepy and
08:19
they can't concentrate which is true
08:21
right when you go to a human place you
08:23
feel really gross kind of but so i grew
08:25
up in hong kong which was all humid all
08:27
the time
08:28
established you're always a [ __ ] now
08:30
i've never thought how this weather has
08:32
really
08:33
molded me did you find your
08:34
concentration improved when you came
08:36
here
08:36
uh mate i'm not the good case study to
08:38
ask about
08:40
um the wettest day of the year on earth
08:44
whatever day it is what percentage of
08:46
the rain from the year do you think
08:48
falls
08:48
on that one day okay so a normal if
08:51
there are 365 days it would be a bit
08:53
less than 0.3
08:54
percent on an average day so i'll say
08:58
one percent triple yeah the average i'm
09:01
going to say
09:02
35 love it love great day for the puddle
09:06
photographer
09:08
he's a billionaire uh it is
09:12
eight point three percent wow that's a
09:14
lot it's about twelve
09:15
of the earth's rain falls on a single
09:18
date what day is that what day
09:19
we don't know it's different surely
09:21
that's the one day we would definitely
09:22
know
09:23
the same day every year i know oh yeah
09:26
right
09:26
i meant when was the last time that we
09:29
no it's always the third tuesday after
09:30
easter
09:33
and 50 of the earth's precipitation
09:36
falls on the 12 wettest days of wow
09:39
amazing amazing that's incredible wow
09:42
that's really cool
09:43
it'd be so great if it was the same
09:45
every year and we could just do a 12
09:48
day what was it 12 days 12 days 12 day
09:50
long hibernation
09:51
i wonder if it happens in a period of
09:52
the year because lots of countries have
09:54
big rainy seasons so
09:55
there must be a likelihood of it being
09:58
well the paper
09:59
um the article where i read this it said
10:01
one key question the researchers wrote
10:03
is
10:03
when during the year these extreme
10:05
precipitation events are likely to occur
10:07
so i think basically they don't really
10:09
know what it's going to be but they'll
10:10
try and work it out
10:11
just on rainy conditions as in preparing
10:14
for rain have you heard of the rain
10:15
shader
10:16
no this is a new kind of umbrella which
10:18
has been invented in the last few years
10:20
and it is designed to solve the problems
10:22
of um what are the problems of umbrellas
10:25
they get in people's eyes they're going
10:26
to be inside out
10:27
uh oh yeah that's the one actually
10:29
that's the main one that's a really good
10:30
one
10:31
and there's one more never have one on
10:32
you when you need it that's not the one
10:34
i'm looking for they break the
10:37
notes people take them if you leave them
10:39
at the front of the store
10:41
they're awful if it's really windy you
10:43
might blow away like mary poppins
10:44
yeah that's yeah she doesn't have you
10:46
seen the film
10:47
she's not trying to help them out and
10:49
suddenly against her will she's blown
10:51
away into another land that's why the
10:52
sequel's only 17 minutes long
10:54
very sad yeah opening lines were
10:57
sorry about that um where are we
11:00
[Laughter]
11:01
um no it's that you know when you tilt
11:04
it all the water can fall off onto
11:05
someone else
11:06
i'll cut it that's a small point holding
11:07
it upside down but you could
11:12
what um so the rain shader is this new
11:16
it basically looks like a motorbike
11:17
helmet but in
11:18
in umbrella form so it's white it's open
11:21
at the front and then at the back it's
11:22
really low
11:23
it's like wearing a big helmet that's
11:25
sort of cut out at the front
11:27
so that means you can't ever poke
11:28
someone in the eye with it that's really
11:30
good that's good
11:30
i don't think that would turn inside out
11:32
either so i think it's solving more
11:33
problems than i think it might yeah yeah
11:35
um in harvard business school yeah um
11:39
there's
11:39
a paper that they wrote quite recently
11:41
called toxic workers
11:43
and this is about superstar workers who
11:46
outperform their colleagues by two to
11:47
one
11:48
or more but who are awful to be around
11:52
and they want to work out whether it's
11:53
useful to have these kind of amazing
11:55
workers or whether they do
11:56
way too much harm than good what do you
11:59
think interesting
12:00
what do we think of james
12:01
[Laughter]
12:03
the question we're being asked
12:04
[Laughter]
12:08
apparently according to them it's better
12:10
to hire two average employees than to
12:12
keep one superstar
12:13
wow um do you guys know about the
12:16
this has always been one of my favorite
12:18
studies the harvard grant study
12:20
which is this massive its famous
12:22
longitudinal study
12:24
and it's followed 268 people for 80
12:27
years
12:28
so it started following them when they
12:29
were at harvard and it studies
12:31
every tiny aspect of their lives and so
12:34
it's told us so much about the
12:36
decisions that you make and the
12:37
personalities that you have what impact
12:39
that has
12:39
on your life it's like an unbelievable
12:41
level of detail so it measures things
12:43
like the size of moles on their body
12:46
and how many teaspoons of sugar they
12:48
have in their tea and
12:49
the hanging length of your scrotum and
12:51
then they sort of follow them
12:54
guys as opposed to when you've got it
12:56
pinned back
13:00
not a trip over it
13:08
so they measure all this and they find
13:10
out you know are they successful
13:11
actually jfk was one of the people who
13:13
was originally in it so he was
13:14
successful
13:15
but actually quite unlucky um and
13:18
at the moment i think there are only
13:20
about uh not many of them left
13:22
now obviously i think there were 19 left
13:24
a couple of years ago all the ones with
13:25
the longest scrotums and that's the
13:27
interesting thing
13:28
if that was true that's the sole
13:29
predictor of how you're doing life no
13:31
because they all chipped over and
13:32
concussed themselves years ago
13:34
what they basically have found or what
13:35
the person who's in charge of it now
13:37
says is the most important discovery is
13:39
that um
13:41
your relationships are the most
13:42
important predictor of health mental and
13:44
physical but literally the most
13:46
important
13:46
more important than cholesterol more
13:48
important than diet
13:49
it's you know the warmth of your
13:51
relationships and that dictates how much
13:53
you'll earn in the end and
13:55
it dictates how successful you'll be and
13:57
how happy you'll be
13:59
there we go or it could just be that
14:00
rich people can buy relationships
14:06
yeah i think it's that
14:07
[Music]
14:08
[Applause]
14:11
okay it is time for fact number two and
14:14
that is
14:15
andy my fact is that when they are
14:16
mating male cuttlefish can flirt with
14:19
one side of their body and
14:20
simultaneously pretend to be a female
14:22
with the other side of their body
14:24
it's it's a really weird thing they do
14:27
so cuttlefish are
14:29
mollusks in the ocean they're kind of
14:31
mollusk and um
14:32
they're a bit squiddy and a bit
14:33
octopussy and um
14:36
they change the pattern of their skin
14:38
all the time for camouflage
14:39
but they do it for lots of different
14:41
reasons so they might do it to avoid
14:42
predators or they sometimes do it even
14:44
to catch prey but one thing they do is
14:46
when they're courting
14:48
male cuttlefish display you know
14:50
courtship patterns
14:51
to females on their bodies but they
14:53
don't want other males to
14:55
fight them so they simultaneously make
14:58
the back half of their body
14:59
display a female pattern so a male who's
15:02
standing
15:03
behind the flirting male will think oh
15:05
that's just two female cuttlefish having
15:07
a chat with each other
15:08
and he won't get in the way but if it
15:09
looks like it's a male chatting to a
15:11
female they might try and break it up
15:13
but won't is there no chance that the
15:15
male cuttlefish will start flirting with
15:17
the back of the
15:18
the female camouflage that sometimes
15:20
happens yeah because that would just
15:21
that could just be a long queue it's
15:23
like
15:23
[Laughter]
15:25
well basically yeah that does happen so
15:28
um
15:29
some males have harems of females which
15:31
they guard jealously from challenges
15:33
and other males disguise themselves to
15:34
look female sneak in have sex with the
15:36
real females and then sneak out
15:38
but sometimes the disguised males look
15:39
so good that the the alpha male will
15:42
guard him
15:43
as part of his harem so you can have a
15:45
harem which has mostly males in it
15:48
all pretending to be females but they
15:49
only look good from the back so they're
15:51
just never going around the front
15:54
strictly arse-based
15:57
they are amazing they're incredible they
15:59
also have two prehensile tentacles
16:01
i think on the front which sometimes
16:04
they hide they've got pockets
16:06
under their eyes where they put them
16:08
when they're not using them of course
16:11
it's under their eyes such a great place
16:13
to have a pocket
16:15
they're so weird it's so weird when you
16:17
don't because octopuses i think we all
16:18
know
16:19
are quite weird so when you talk about
16:20
them it's kind of but this is all just
16:22
like what is this animal
16:23
are you just joking are we lying he's
16:24
got pockets under its eyes he turns his
16:26
butt into a woman he's like come on
16:28
the most amazing thing about cuttlefish
16:30
which people maybe know and david
16:31
ashmore is very good at showing
16:32
uh is that their disguises right so they
16:34
disguise themselves even better than
16:36
you know the octopuses that can do it
16:37
and other things and they can do it
16:39
within a few milliseconds they can just
16:40
change color
16:41
and they can give themselves stripes
16:43
like you say kind of coursing patterns
16:45
is incredible um they can as well as
16:47
change in the color they can change
16:48
from smooth to bumpy their skin which is
16:52
a really cool
16:53
yeah so they mimic the object that they
16:56
might be camouflaging yeah but not just
16:57
color but also the
16:59
yeah the texture it's like covering
17:00
yourself in warts yeah exactly
17:03
if you want to pretend to be a witch
17:07
a lot of those on the bottom of the
17:09
ocean yeah actually um
17:11
i read it as they have the equivalent of
17:12
hundreds of cocktail umbrellas under
17:14
their skin
17:15
so they can they have all these
17:16
structures that they can sort of lock
17:18
upright to make themselves look knobbly
17:19
basically if they want to look like
17:21
coral
17:22
yeah for example that camouflage they
17:24
can freeze it and lock it in place for
17:26
up to an hour
17:27
so they're changing it all the time but
17:29
they can just go okay i'm going to stay
17:30
like this for an hour now
17:31
wow they are really weird and really
17:33
cool crazy
17:34
yeah and also these changes are to do
17:36
with their mood and
17:37
whether they're hungry or scared or
17:39
whatever so you can look at the colors
17:41
on a cuttlefish and work out what it's
17:42
feeling that'll be useful in humans good
17:46
um they can do a chessboard pattern no
17:48
they cut
17:49
they can they can make themselves look
17:50
exactly like a chessboard why for when
17:52
they need
17:52
camouflage next to a game of chess going
17:55
around
17:56
because they can do the bumping stuff as
17:58
well the um
17:59
what are you saying they can do the
18:00
pieces
18:01
[Laughter]
18:03
they could have an actual game on their
18:05
own body that would be amazing
18:07
that's very cool um can you explain the
18:10
chess board thing why would they do that
18:12
well they they've been tested by
18:14
scientists
18:15
there's no natural chess board passion
18:16
but it's just to show how versatile it's
18:18
incredible
18:19
oh yeah yeah and they can um richard
18:21
hammond who used to be on top gear he
18:23
could also do that
18:28
but terribly sadly he doesn't know the
18:29
rules it's a real shame
18:31
um no he as one of his shows they put a
18:34
cuttlefish in a
18:35
underwater lounge which they had mocked
18:37
up which had also like a zebra
18:38
patterned sofa and stuff they were just
18:40
putting that was
18:43
[Laughter]
18:47
he was making a show and they it was
18:49
about cool
18:50
animals or something and um it featured
18:53
and they created an underwater lounge
18:55
with all this stuff right
18:57
richard evans lounge is not under water
19:02
and so okay so they perfectly mimicked a
19:04
chessboard yeah
19:05
that is so cool it's really bizarre yeah
19:07
yeah i mean it wouldn't be perfect don't
19:09
get excited
19:10
no but i mean i'm actually more excited
19:12
by the experiment that we are taking
19:14
non-underwater based objects and seeing
19:17
if they can mimic that because you
19:18
wouldn't actually see that
19:19
yeah i'm interested that they can i
19:21
didn't realize they could actually mimic
19:22
stuff that they'd never seen before
19:23
there might be half a dozen
19:24
fish in this room now we don't know this
19:27
entire building is comfortable
19:29
from top to bottom my favorite
19:31
cuttlefish is the bottom dwelling
19:33
flatboy
19:34
cuttlefish the bottom dwelling
19:37
flamboyant cuttlefish
19:39
god if you've got something dwelling in
19:40
your bottom you don't want it to be
19:41
flamboyant
19:44
uh it's the only mollusk with a
19:46
quadrupedal gate that's amazing yeah
19:48
that is incredible
19:50
the way they hunt is cool so they've got
19:51
if you look at them they look exactly
19:53
like
19:53
the oods from doctor who and i know only
19:55
dan will know what i'm talking about but
19:57
that's what a lot of them look like and
19:58
they so they've got these sort of big
19:59
long funnels on their nose
20:01
and the way they a lot of them catch
20:02
prey is by blasting their funnel at the
20:05
sand
20:05
and they'll blow up a prawn that's
20:07
having a nap
20:10
it just shoots up into the bronze nap
20:13
i suppose they must do right everyone's
20:14
got a nap yeah they
20:16
hunt in the day and prawns are nocturnal
20:18
so they're often asleep in the day
20:20
what a horrible way to wake up being
20:22
blasted out of your bed
20:23
into the mouth of a nude one thing about
20:26
cuttlefish that might also be known is
20:28
they give us sepia they give us
20:30
basically the look of victorian
20:31
photographs
20:32
what yeah sepia inks so they have an ink
20:35
sack
20:35
yeah there are three things that develop
20:37
when they're in embryo the first three
20:38
things are developed but they're two
20:39
eyes weird shaped eyes and then the ink
20:41
sac
20:41
and that's a defense mechanism so they
20:43
blast out ink as a last resort if
20:45
they're being chased
20:46
and that's where we get sepia it's our
20:48
main source of that colour
20:49
still to this day or the original yeah
20:51
wow that's amazing so sepia is like that
20:53
browny color isn't it yeah
20:55
yeah that you put over photographs to
20:57
make them look sort of victorian
21:00
yeah photo but wait sorry did that get
21:03
used in the victorian photo process we
21:04
needed cuttlefish yeah
21:06
ink yeah that's incredible yeah that's
21:09
amazing they're a
21:10
windy handy little guy you just wouldn't
21:11
think there would be enough cuttlefish
21:12
to make enough sepia for
21:14
the victorian photo industry there's so
21:16
much cuttlefish and also probably wasn't
21:18
that bigger
21:20
industry in those days oh yeah it's not
21:21
like mobile phones where everyone's got
21:23
a camera these days that's true
21:25
anyone could be a puddle photographer
21:26
these days all the art has been lost
21:28
from the trade
21:30
and it's not like every time you put a
21:32
sepia filter over your iphone photo
21:34
a cuttlefish has to die
21:38
we've moved on there's no like when you
21:39
go to snappy snaps huge
21:42
tank
21:47
[Music]
21:48
[Applause]
21:51
okay it's time for fact number three and
21:53
that is james
21:54
okay my fact this week is that william
21:56
of orange's favorite
21:58
drink was [ __ ] ale which was
22:02
which was a drink it's made of ale with
22:05
a [ __ ] in it
22:06
a cockerel a rooster
22:09
and it was they put the rooster in when
22:12
it was being brewed
22:13
and the idea was that it would put
22:15
something into the mix which would give
22:17
you virility
22:18
and it was like the red bull of its day
22:20
almost
22:22
and actually the first known recipe for
22:24
cockhail was in 1669
22:27
and it was written by a guy called sir
22:29
kennel
22:30
digby oh yeah people who know the
22:33
podcast
22:33
might remember his father you ever ride
22:35
digby kidding
22:37
who was one of the gunpowder plotters
22:40
all the effects have returned this is so
22:42
exciting
22:43
um yeah so ken on digby he wrote a lot
22:45
of um like cookbooks
22:47
uh and he invented bacon and eggs as
22:49
well actually
22:51
first sorry i think we give pigs a lot
22:53
of the credit for bacon and chickens the
22:55
credit for eggs
22:56
he just invented putting them together
22:59
so i think if we cook tonight
23:00
me for example i wouldn't be able to
23:02
claim credit for the recipe
23:06
yeah enough the recipe of this take
23:08
eight gallons of ale take a [ __ ] and
23:09
boil him well
23:10
then take four pounds of raisins of the
23:12
sun well stoned two or three nutmegs
23:14
three or four flakes of mace
23:16
half a pound of dates beat all these
23:18
with the mortar and put them in two
23:19
quarts of the best sack
23:21
don't know what sack is and then when
23:23
the ale have done working put these in
23:25
and stop it close six or seven days and
23:27
then bottle it and after a month you may
23:29
drink it
23:30
wow so it's a bit like a mold cocktail
23:32
yeah yeah yeah i think zack is
23:34
kind of wine isn't it like maybe
23:36
fortified wine i'm not sure well there's
23:38
a there is a theory which is a terrible
23:40
theory it can't be right
23:41
but um because i know what you're gonna
23:43
say yeah i've read this theory
23:44
yeah because they were adding you know
23:46
this new uh
23:47
element ingredient to something that
23:49
shouldn't be there [ __ ] ale
23:50
was effectively the origins of cocktail
23:54
it's just not true it's not i'm saying
23:56
it's a theory where do you think it came
23:58
from then cocktail
23:59
um oh there are different i can't
24:01
remember there are other bad theories as
24:03
well but that's
24:04
that's worse here's another bad theory
24:06
so a cocktail used to be a horse with a
24:09
docked tail
24:10
because it looked a bit like a cock's
24:12
comb and then it became
24:14
a word for a horse of a mixed pedigree
24:16
and then it became a drink because it
24:18
had lots of mixes of different drinks in
24:20
it that's one theory
24:22
and h.l menken thought that it came from
24:24
the french
24:25
cocketier meaning egg cup because you
24:27
would drink it out of a very small cup
24:29
cocktail oh that i like that one that's
24:31
my favorite so far i think none of them
24:33
are true
24:33
yeah um i can't believe we know who made
24:35
bacon and eggs for the first time
24:37
yeah we've just kind of danced over that
24:39
but that's that's huge that's a big deal
24:40
that's a big deal
24:41
someone else probably would have done it
24:43
and actually he was just writing down
24:45
uh recipes right so right he didn't
24:47
invent i don't think he invented
24:49
cocktail either i think he just wrote it
24:51
down
24:51
okay recipes were simpler then weren't
24:53
they you just wrote bacon
24:55
eggs and you went down in history no
24:57
they're really complicated lots of them
25:00
so there's a 1739 cocktail recipe in a
25:02
book called the complete housewife which
25:04
is one of the first big household
25:05
manuals
25:06
and it starts with take 10 gallons of
25:08
ale and a large [ __ ] the older the
25:10
better
25:10
but then you had to stamp on it in a
25:12
mortar until it was its bones were
25:14
broken
25:14
oh it said parboil the [ __ ] flay it and
25:17
stamp him in a stone water
25:19
yeah yeah my mortar is not big enough to
25:22
be stamping around in you need a bigger
25:23
water
25:25
these are another weird ingredient for
25:27
old uh drinks
25:29
um cider in the 16th century used to
25:31
have sheep's blood
25:32
added to it cornwall sheep's blood at
25:35
what point they realized that it's just
25:36
nicer without the sheep's blood in it
25:40
one day they'd run out of sheep's blood
25:41
and they just made decide
25:44
you were laughed out of the pub if you
25:45
suggested do you think
25:47
we could yeah so the sort of precursors
25:50
to beer seem to all have been
25:52
mold spice beer i think our kind of beer
25:54
that doesn't contain any spices and
25:56
flavors
25:57
is the anomaly in history really so you
25:59
see all these recipes for
26:00
kind of heating up beer they always were
26:02
adding cinnamon and cloves and nutmeg
26:05
and ginger
26:06
another thing they added almost always
26:08
if you look back to beer recipes if you
26:10
look in all old books and stuff or from
26:12
the 16
26:12
1700s toast so they always put toast on
26:15
top of beer didn't they
26:16
floated it yeah so they'll say like you
26:18
know like a crouton
26:20
in a soup basically like giant croutons
26:22
yeah
26:24
i'd like a crouton in a pineapple well i
26:27
like beer and i like croutons there we
26:28
go
26:29
seems likely that i would like both
26:30
these things i think you'd love the
26:31
1600s
26:33
it's hard though isn't it most beer
26:35
glasses most pints are not quite big
26:37
enough for a full slice of toast to
26:38
float on the surface no
26:39
no but these these beers were fitting
26:41
entire roosters in them
26:44
the vessels were bigger what was the
26:45
point of the toast well
26:47
one recipe i read explained why the
26:49
toast was there it said it claps the
26:51
white
26:52
waistcoat on a cup of good drink oh
26:54
brilliant that's really clear thank you
26:56
yeah yeah oh
26:59
yeah well the white way is coconut oh
27:01
wow
27:04
i was reading about just the consumption
27:05
of alcohol in the 1600s
27:07
and um i found this thing that
27:09
parliament passed it was an act
27:11
uh that i've not heard of it was the act
27:13
to repress the odious and loathsome
27:15
sin of drunkenness it's because everyone
27:18
was just getting so drunk all the time
27:20
that the wording of that is just
27:21
stunning yeah um hideous
27:23
yeah so um yeah so hops which were
27:27
medicinal plants um they they'd been
27:29
added to beers and i think that was a
27:31
way around of
27:32
um saying that you were doing for
27:34
medical purposes as opposed to
27:35
it being yeah just getting drunk oh yeah
27:38
and they didn't like cops in britain
27:39
they really didn't like cops so when we
27:41
talked about beer from thousands of
27:42
years ago it's not beer like we know it
27:44
so beer to be classified as beer now has
27:45
to be made with hops
27:47
but they only actually came to england
27:50
in the 1400s i think from the
27:51
netherlands
27:52
and everyone thought they were a bit
27:53
poisonous they're a bit weird so that's
27:55
you know it's the plant that adds the
27:56
bitter taste to the
27:57
beer and actually the first person to
28:00
describe
28:00
hops scientifically and talk about how
28:02
they were used in beer
28:04
was a woman it was a christian botanist
28:07
and abbess who is called hildegard of
28:09
bingen
28:11
yeah i've heard of her actually yeah she
28:14
was a big deal yeah
28:15
she was quite revolutionary in the beer
28:17
industry did she see lots of
28:19
i can't remember what about her now i
28:21
think she saw lots of um
28:23
visions and stuff didn't she it's not
28:24
the same hildegard oh maybe not
28:27
is there more than one hildegarde
28:32
there was one who saw lots of visions
28:33
and then wrote one of the first
28:35
books or something but maybe it was a
28:38
different one yeah
28:39
it might been her she was big she wasn't
28:41
actually a fan of pops even though she
28:42
knew how they were used she said
28:44
they make the soul of man sad and weigh
28:46
down his inner organs
28:47
whoa that's kind of what it feels like
28:50
after seven points
28:52
um there is a thing i can't remember
28:54
exactly what it is but in germany you're
28:56
only allowed three ingredients in
28:57
beer to this day really i think it's
29:00
hops water and
29:01
what would it be barley barley yeah and
29:03
i think that they're
29:04
it's really strict and they've they've
29:05
had hundreds and hundreds of years of
29:07
rules about this
29:08
so there was the broward nung in 16th
29:11
century bavaria
29:12
where you weren't allowed to make beer
29:13
between the 23rd of april and 29th of
29:15
september
29:16
so no brewing allowed because um brewers
29:19
caught breweries caught fire very easily
29:21
because they're all made of wood
29:22
and there were lots of coal fires to
29:24
heat them up so it was bad
29:26
for fires so they banned it but they
29:29
you had to have sellers to store beer
29:32
from the winter
29:33
so that you could drink it in the summer
29:34
and the breweries stored them in big
29:36
underground
29:37
cellars and then above ground they
29:39
planted trees to keep them shady because
29:41
they wanted to keep the
29:42
cool in the cellars and then they
29:45
started adding tables and gravel
29:47
to these um you know above ground tree
29:49
areas
29:50
and that's the beginning of the beer
29:52
garden the yeah the beer garden comes
29:55
from this band
29:56
on on brewing in the summer and it was
29:58
actually four beer
30:00
really the beer garden yeah not for us
30:03
yeah where is someone else's garden yeah
30:09
um so just speaking of german beer you
30:12
know
30:12
pilsner yes you know where that name
30:14
comes from
30:15
i thought it's a place or something so
30:18
it is a place
30:18
it's from it's from pilsen yeah which
30:22
was one of europe's first beer brewing
30:23
capitals
30:24
and pills so it was called pilsen when
30:26
it became this beer brown capital
30:28
and that is because that was the german
30:30
word for henbane
30:32
which is like a really deadly poisonous
30:33
plant but they used to put that in beer
30:35
all the time
30:36
so they were brew beer with hen but does
30:38
that not make it really i mean
30:39
that is really probably priceless yeah
30:41
it's very dangerous what were they doing
30:43
with beer for hundreds of years let's
30:44
put cockrells in it let's put sheep's
30:46
blood in it and poison
30:48
there was no no whether they went three
30:50
ingredients that's it from that one
30:52
but a little bit of poison though no no
30:57
it gave you hallucinations if you
30:58
managed to escape death it was quite fun
31:00
but so that's where pilsner comes from
31:02
is after henbane because that was a
31:03
crucial
31:04
ingredient of deadly beer wow very cool
31:06
um
31:07
just one last weird origin thing um
31:10
so you mentioned that that beer brewing
31:12
book you mentioned earlier beer brewing
31:13
book was for a housewife
31:14
beer brewing was like sort of solely a
31:17
women's
31:18
thing across the world wherever beer was
31:20
brewed until pretty recently until
31:23
basically the 15 1600s when hops
31:25
actually came in
31:26
so the alewife is a thing because it was
31:28
always the woman who would do the
31:29
cooking beer in the house
31:30
brewing the beer women would control the
31:32
breweries for instance in ancient egypt
31:34
they all had their own breweries
31:35
women would be in charge and uh so they
31:38
were they became the main beer sellers
31:39
and
31:40
barmaids still in sort of dickensian
31:42
novels
31:43
and women so women would start making
31:45
surplus beer because they'd been making
31:46
it for the home
31:47
and then they would go and sell it so
31:49
they'd put greenery over their doors and
31:51
in some cases they'd put a broom
31:53
up against their door which signified
31:54
that you were selling beer
31:56
and they would stand on the corner and
31:57
they'd advertise their beer by wearing a
31:59
tall hat
32:01
and they would often have a pet cat
32:05
who would chase their pets
32:08
no i'm just a
32:13
this is the cuttlefish is this this is
32:15
where the twitch image comes from
32:16
yeah so they they were tall hat said i'm
32:18
the beer selling lady i'm the ale wife
32:20
and they all had cats they had a cat to
32:21
chase away pests because otherwise they
32:23
ate the grain with which they made the
32:24
beer they're all testing out
32:26
crazy ingredients like eye of newt and
32:28
stuff yeah
32:30
yeah hallucinogenic they go stirring it
32:33
around in their cauldrons
32:34
or their massive mortars yes yeah
32:38
oh my goodness and then came the witch
32:41
really
32:42
wow yeah it's a thought that i haven't
32:44
made up
32:47
[Applause]
32:52
okay there's time for our final fact of
32:54
the show and that is my fact
32:55
my fact this week is that after five
32:57
months of forensically analyzing the
33:00
indents made by a pen on paper
33:02
dorset police managed to recover 26
33:04
pages of lost words by a blind novelist
33:07
who hadn't realized that her pen had run
33:09
out of ink
33:10
yeah that is amazing quite remarkable
33:13
yeah it's pretty extraordinary
33:14
uh this was an author called trish
33:16
vickers it was her first book that she
33:17
was writing she had gone blind
33:20
through diabetes and she decided that
33:22
she wanted to pass her time by
33:24
writing a book so she created a system
33:26
and she did it long hand with pen
33:28
created a system where she had elastic
33:30
bands along the paper she would write
33:31
out the pages
33:32
and then her son would come at the end
33:33
of the week and he would transcribe them
33:36
onto a word document or whatever he
33:38
chose
33:39
so he came one week after she had this
33:40
burst of inspiration she wrote 26 pages
33:43
but he discovered these blank pages
33:44
sitting there it turns out the pen had
33:46
run out
33:47
she was devastated he was devastated
33:49
because she'd ridden such great stuff
33:50
and it is quite funny and it's
33:52
incredibly funny
33:54
so thank you james for pointing that out
33:56
yeah so she was very upset and
33:58
they got in touch with the police to say
34:00
can you do anything about this
34:02
and um yeah then they arrested the pen
34:04
manufacturer
34:08
yeah so actually it's very sweet at
34:10
dorset police station
34:11
someone said they would look through the
34:13
pages um with the special light that
34:15
they used for forensics to see the
34:17
little markings that the pen would have
34:19
left on the page
34:20
the little dents and um they spent five
34:22
months now it wasn't five months of
34:24
intense
34:25
analysis at the time we're just having a
34:28
field day
34:30
it was uh i believe it was one person
34:31
who did it on her lunch break for uh
34:33
five months although if you're a burglar
34:35
having a field day it's probably a very
34:36
bad day for you
34:39
burglars call it having a house full of
34:41
electronic equipment day
34:42
[Laughter]
34:45
but so she managed to get the book done
34:48
it was called granifer's legacy
34:49
um sadly she she actually passed away
34:52
before she could hold a physical copy in
34:53
her hands but it was
34:55
published two hours prior to her passing
34:57
away the physical copies
34:59
yeah so she just missed out by two hours
35:01
she knew it was being published
35:03
she knew and i think she held a proof um
35:05
in her hand um so yeah
35:07
so i thought that the only method you
35:09
know when you make indentations on paper
35:11
um you can kind of read it or you can
35:13
shade over it with a pencil and that
35:15
kind of shows up
35:16
because it doesn't the pencil shading
35:18
doesn't fill the indentations
35:19
do you know the police do it they have a
35:21
special wand
35:24
so first of all they don't do the pencil
35:25
thing do they because that could damage
35:27
the
35:27
evidence right but they have this device
35:30
they've invented
35:31
called an electrostatic detection
35:33
apparatus and they
35:35
basically documents which is charged
35:36
with static a piece of paper charged
35:38
with static
35:38
builds up more charge in the furrows
35:41
where the pencil is indented all the pen
35:42
is indented than on the flat
35:45
and even even really microscopic
35:48
non-visible to the naked eye furrows
35:50
exist so they put the document on this
35:52
plate and then they pass a wand
35:53
charged with electricity over it and
35:56
then they apply this mist of toner and
35:57
the turner just gravitates towards the
35:59
furrows
36:00
and you fill in a page of writing that
36:02
way wow
36:04
it's basically a magic wand so they sort
36:05
of they sort of charge up
36:07
the indents yeah that have got a lot of
36:09
static same yeah that's cool yeah
36:11
super cool it's quite similar to
36:13
fingerprinting
36:14
right that kind of process where with
36:16
fingerprinting you can kind of do it
36:18
yourself
36:18
so apparently a really good substance
36:21
for putting over fingerprints so you can
36:22
see them is
36:23
raw cocoa powder if you want to do it
36:25
you can use raw cocoa powder or talcum
36:27
powder but you're not going to have the
36:29
database of the entire country at home
36:32
what you're just going to see is a
36:34
fingerprint that you can't really
36:35
recognize
36:36
yeah but you can definitely if it's like
36:38
who took my chocolate bar you can
36:39
definitely get
36:40
your family's fingerprints i reckon and
36:42
in your room
36:43
and then compare them it's a real
36:45
insight into alice
36:48
definitely would have done that um the
36:50
the
36:51
system the magic one system that you
36:53
talked about um is called the
36:55
electrostatic detection apparatus esda
36:58
and it was invented by two djs wow cool
37:01
um they were called dj foster and dj
37:04
marantz
37:05
they weren't disc jockeys it was just
37:07
their names oh
37:08
okay yeah i was thinking they were bored
37:12
in the booth one day
37:13
no it's just a coincidence that they had
37:15
the same two initials and i thought it
37:17
was quite funny
37:18
it was a good setup you had us going in
37:21
the first half we did not see it coming
37:23
and i was thinking i was pretty boring
37:25
names for d-days i was like
37:26
gj foster and can i just say one more
37:30
thing on
37:31
esda yeah so esda is kind of famous
37:34
because um it's
37:36
what do you remember the west midlands
37:38
serious crime squad got into a lot of
37:40
trouble for
37:41
faking people's um confessions
37:44
uh the birmingham pub bombings oh yeah
37:47
they got
37:47
um the birmingham six yeah they got
37:49
released because of that
37:50
and it was using esda that they found
37:53
that the police were making these
37:54
fake confessions oh really oh very cool
37:58
that's funny but true yeah val mcdermott
38:01
actually has written a book on forensics
38:03
which sounds really good i was reading a
38:05
summary of it so she's the
38:06
cr she's a sort of crime writer isn't
38:08
she fiction yeah yeah of fiction uh but
38:10
this is a factual book
38:12
and so there's loads of good facts in
38:14
there but there's the story of the
38:15
arsonist called john orr
38:17
which i didn't know about he was quite a
38:19
big criminal in the 1980s he was
38:21
basically
38:21
a fireman and who ended up being done
38:25
for burning down
38:26
loads and loads of houses because if
38:28
you're a fireman you know how so i think
38:29
he was suspected in more than a thousand
38:31
fires in california
38:33
and he was eventually caught he was
38:36
caught partly because
38:37
of forensics so they matched a
38:39
fingerprint on one bit of sort of
38:41
half-burned
38:42
match that he'd used wow but he was also
38:45
caught do you think they went
38:46
we've got a match and they went yeah we
38:48
can see that
38:50
so good there was two hours of confusion
38:54
between laurel and hardy the fire
38:57
um so another thing that tipped them off
38:59
that he might be responsible was that
39:01
he'd written a novel called points of
39:02
origin that contained a highly detailed
39:04
description
39:05
of the same fire that they were
39:07
investigating for
39:08
several striking similarities and also
39:11
the fight that he was done for in 1984
39:13
everyone who investigated it said this
39:15
is an accidental fire and he kept
39:17
insisting
39:18
that no it was arson so it's like he
39:20
really had this desire for people
39:22
do you think he was one of these people
39:24
who deliberately set fire so they can go
39:26
and put them out oh yeah cause that does
39:27
happen we did that it's called
39:28
something like hero syndrome yeah maybe
39:31
oh yeah
39:32
well it's not a hero now he is serving a
39:35
long jail sentence very much a zero
39:38
nice that's what the judge said when he
39:41
passed a sentence
39:46
i would love to be one of those comedy
39:47
judges that just
39:49
said something funny just as setting
39:51
them down i didn't know that comedy
39:53
judge was a
39:54
career actually yeah well it's not no
39:57
you don't apply to be the comedy judge
39:58
it's not
40:00
it is a regular judge who happens to
40:02
have a bit of fun there was that guy who
40:04
got done for
40:04
um he got done for something but he
40:06
loved the beatles and the judge
40:08
sentenced him using as many beetles
40:13
what did he do oh maybe he um
40:16
stole from the tax man yeah brilliant
40:19
yeah you probably were it was probably a
40:20
cry for help you may have had a hard
40:22
day's night
40:23
in your hello submarine um
40:29
wait it was the criminal turn of the
40:31
beatles yeah okay got it got it so it
40:33
was kind of like the beatles were
40:34
sending him down
40:35
that is really hard you shouldn't have
40:36
used your revolver
40:38
yeah yeah that's one of the big albums
40:40
getting dark yeah yeah
40:42
you've got a rubber soul yeah because
40:45
you know it's like a bad
40:46
oh a robber's soul a rubber sole a
40:48
rubber sole is better a robbers
40:50
a robber's soul is better i mean none of
40:51
these are good are they
40:54
the comedy judges
40:55
[Laughter]

hello
00:15
and welcome to another episode of no
00:17
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:20
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:22
covent garden
00:23
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
00:25
here with andrew hunt and murray anna
00:27
jaczynski
00:28
and james harkin and once again we have
00:30
gathered round the microphones with our
00:31
four
00:32
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:34
and in no particular order
00:36
here we go starting with you andy
00:39
my fact is that in the 19th century
00:42
champion plowers were traded like
00:43
premier league footballers
00:46
wow i don't know how exactly like
00:48
premier league football as it was it
00:49
wasn't for like
00:50
10 million pounds no exactly i think the
00:52
sums are a bit lower
00:54
but there was a big thing where um there
00:56
were lots of plowing competitions in the
00:58
19th century
00:59
where you had to um you had to plow up
01:01
and down a field and one
01:03
there are all these metrics employing
01:04
about whether you're doing it right or
01:05
wrong
01:06
and squires who had lots of plowmen
01:08
would kind of pit them against each
01:10
other
01:10
and then the winners would win a year's
01:12
wages and then they might be transferred
01:14
can i just say can i ask what a squire
01:16
is because i associate that with king
01:17
arthur at times and
01:18
this is the 19th probably where it
01:20
started yeah so
01:22
that's a kind of assistant to a nobleman
01:24
isn't it okay but in
01:25
in the later times it's more of a kind
01:27
of
01:28
junior aristocrat sort of a slight land
01:31
a landowner
01:32
i think yeah so for example you get the
01:34
word squierarchy
01:36
which is a word for quite affluent
01:38
families from the country
01:40
is is it not a very common word i think
01:42
do you get the word
01:44
don't use it casually in a pub
01:45
conversation here's a less common word i
01:48
think you used to get a squish-up
01:49
which is someone who is a squire i'm the
01:52
bishop
01:54
again don't use that in another
01:56
conversation but that is that do they
01:57
just do that like squikman who delivers
01:59
the milk but also as a squire
02:02
is that just applied smashing the words
02:05
um so it was landowners and they would
02:07
get
02:08
have these competitions so that their
02:09
land got plowed basically
02:11
and so like for instance the first one
02:13
ever in kent
02:14
uh was in 1867 or the first big one in
02:16
kent and that was
02:18
run by a guy called mr hart dyke
02:21
who owned a massive amount of land in
02:23
kent
02:24
and who then later had children who had
02:26
children who had children who had
02:28
miranda from the tv miranda
02:32
wow and tom hart dyke who we know yeah
02:36
he was he's still he works in um in
02:39
agriculture to an extent he
02:40
he plants things um so there's a massive
02:43
garden
02:44
in kent which he runs from his ancestral
02:47
home
02:48
which was where this plowing competition
02:51
that's so cool
02:51
he got on the side no he got he was
02:53
famous for being stolen or kidnapped by
02:56
gorillas out in the dorian gap and they
02:58
held him for months and they let him go
03:00
finally and then he went back to get
03:01
directions
03:03
and while he was kept by the guerrillas
03:05
they um or the gorillas he
03:07
um like i kind of
03:10
you can't say it again yeah it did
03:12
although dan pronounced it so profoundly
03:14
like the word gorillas
03:20
i'm slowly realizing we're talking about
03:22
humans and not actual gorillas the
03:23
humans that took him
03:24
yeah so while he was um kidnapped by
03:26
these fighters um
03:28
he kept like a little garden didn't he
03:30
where he was cats and like he would ask
03:32
them for plants and stuff like that to
03:33
kind of keep him same
03:34
a square is someone who's a squire and a
03:37
gorilla
03:39
yeah um so we i should say that the way
03:41
this comes from because it's a really
03:43
good
03:43
story it's a guardian long read on the
03:45
world ploughing championship
03:47
and it's an incredible read it's 5 000
03:49
words of plowing action and it's so good
03:51
so there are all these things you have
03:53
to do right basically you have to plow
03:55
up and down
03:56
and ploughing we should just say what it
03:57
is it's turning
03:59
soil upside down basically so you're
04:01
inverting it
04:02
which means that you're bringing
04:04
nutrients to the surface
04:05
and you're plowing weeds and other
04:07
plants back into the earth so they break
04:09
down and they
04:10
feed the soil so the aim is that you've
04:12
prepared a field for planting
04:14
yeah that's what ploughing is yeah but
04:16
yeah i mean is it necessary maybe we'll
04:18
come on to that later yeah
04:20
what's flowing is very controversial in
04:23
this day and age isn't it
04:24
yeah because it kills the soil yeah
04:27
ruins farms
04:29
and we've been doing it for thousands of
04:30
years and now people have suddenly
04:31
started doing this thing called
04:33
till-free farming or no-till farming
04:35
where they've realized you can just
04:36
spread the seeds on unplowed land
04:39
and they can actually get better yields
04:41
because they don't really have
04:42
anything that's kind of crazy it's a
04:44
thing this is why they've been doing in
04:45
south america for years because their
04:46
land isn't as robust as ours and so
04:48
they've realized that it's been really
04:49
drying out
04:50
and bring the nutrients because the idea
04:52
is that we suddenly disturb this massive
04:54
ecosystem with this plow you dig down
04:57
you wrench up all these insects and
04:59
stuff and you plop them on top and they
05:01
don't know what they're doing
05:02
well it's an argument and the
05:04
experiments are happening and they're
05:05
getting kind of similar-ish results to
05:08
cloud fields so there might be something
05:09
in it i mean imagine if it turned out
05:11
plowing had been totally pointless all
05:13
of these years
05:14
well i mean it hasn't been there's been
05:16
these amazing competitions going on
05:18
if you think about it and it's still and
05:20
it's what they say it's the biggest
05:21
event in
05:22
europe the one that happens in in
05:24
ireland the outdoor event
05:25
in 2017 291 000 people went along to the
05:29
plowing competition i read an article
05:31
about it and it said that two-thirds of
05:33
the attendees have absolutely no
05:34
interest in agriculture whatsoever
05:36
what are they there for it's because
05:38
it's a huge event you know when you
05:39
sometimes go to a village show because
05:40
you're a bit bored of a saturday it's
05:41
like a massive version of that festival
05:44
kind of thing isn't it
05:45
and that attendance is twice as much as
05:46
glastonbury here are some of the things
05:48
that you can actually see at it
05:50
so outside of the plowing um there's a
05:51
robotic milking machine
05:53
uh that milks 40 cows so you can watch
05:56
that
05:56
um there's a pestorant which uh serves
05:59
mealworms and crickets
06:00
local locusts um tractor football
06:03
so that's a that's one of the new
06:05
championships yeah um
06:07
so it's teams of tractors push a giant
06:09
football around the field
06:10
a giant one yeah yeah and then they say
06:12
there's um there's the rte
06:13
tent where they have a very famous
06:15
commentator slash
06:17
news broadcaster called marty morrissey
06:19
and you can meet him and then they say
06:20
in brackets or his cardboard cutout
06:25
yeah it's a massive deal and the same
06:26
person has been at the head of the
06:28
national playering association which is
06:30
the
06:30
organization that runs it for 68 years
06:33
now
06:34
this is 85 year old woman called anna
06:36
mae mcq who i think is a bit of a legend
06:39
there basically and so it's quite
06:40
impressive that she's a woman because
06:41
only about two percent of
06:43
flowers who enter these contests are
06:45
women and
06:46
she said i was reading an interview with
06:48
her and she was saying that
06:49
there's this contest for farmerettes
06:51
which are the female farmers
06:53
and uh they sort of compete over who's
06:57
going to be queen of the plow
06:58
and it used to be the queen of the plow
07:00
if you won that title
07:02
at the contest you were given a hundred
07:03
pound dowry as long as you're married by
07:05
the age of 25.
07:06
wow that's good right on sister
07:10
actually on that the um the first farmet
07:12
competition was in
07:14
1954 that was the first time they
07:16
allowed women in
07:17
and not many people were happy about it
07:19
some people said it was introducing
07:21
hollywood razza matas at its worst
07:24
sounds like it we weren't introducing
07:27
mae weston or anything
07:30
i also said that you were allowed to uh
07:32
enter it
07:33
if it was open this is from i should say
07:35
this is from andy's article
07:37
not your article but the one that you
07:38
forwarded to us which as andy says is
07:40
fantastic and so um the farmette class
07:42
was open to girls and women that were
07:45
single married or widowed
07:47
which are the three i guess options of
07:49
life generally uh but not divorced
07:53
you might be right um so that just while
07:56
we're on ploughing and sexism
07:58
there is a really interesting theory
07:59
that ploughing created sexism in the
08:01
first place
08:03
strap in it's so good i wonder why you
08:05
were so against plowing on it
08:08
so people flowering was invented with
08:10
agriculture about 10th roughly 10 000
08:11
years ago 10 to 8.
08:13
and um the original plows were called
08:16
scratch ploughs so they don't turn the
08:17
soil over they just literally dig a
08:19
little trench through it and you don't
08:20
need too much strength to do it
08:21
but you do need quite a lot of upper
08:24
body strength to do that and
08:26
before that lots of women have been in
08:28
charge of fields and cereal growing
08:30
because they were using
08:32
hose and then when plowing was invented
08:35
and i mean hose
08:36
everybody's smoking hoses
08:45
okay do you think that's where the
08:46
phrase grows before hoes comes
08:50
but then when plang was invented
08:52
suddenly the men were in charge
08:54
and in mesopotamia there's this flip
08:56
from mother goddesses to
08:57
male gods and this is the really weird
08:59
thing it still happens today
09:01
as in the the effects might still be
09:02
being filled so
09:04
women descended from plow-using
09:06
societies are much less likely to work
09:09
outside the home or bnps or run
09:11
businesses
09:11
whereas in countries like rwanda and
09:13
botswana and madagascar which are mostly
09:16
hoe using places and everyone's giggling
09:18
again but in those countries women are
09:20
much
09:20
likelier to be in the labor force
09:24
but what's the reason that it drove
09:26
women out is it their weight upper body
09:28
yeah yeah so it was when people had to
09:29
pull the plow or direct the animals
09:31
exactly
09:32
the first world plow champion was a guy
09:34
called jim eckles from ontario
09:36
and the only write-up i could find said
09:38
that he was so shy he only entered
09:40
because his friends talked him into it
09:43
and the second champion was hugh barr of
09:45
antrim
09:46
and eccles only came eighth in this
09:48
competition because
09:49
according to the article i read he had
09:51
the bad luck of drawing a plot with a
09:53
bump in it
09:54
oh so it's all down to how lucky you
09:56
were with your little bit of fields
09:58
it's about how you deal with these
10:00
obstacles it's not true and all the
10:02
international competitors in that second
10:03
one which was in ireland um hated it
10:05
because they had stony fields in ireland
10:07
and you didn't get stoney fields
10:08
anywhere else around the world
10:10
so you have to clear the stones out of
10:11
the way i think before you start so
10:13
richard herring whose new podcast is
10:14
about him clearing stones from the
10:16
fields
10:24
[Music]
10:26
okay it is time for fact number two and
10:28
that is james okay my fact this week
10:31
is that the american center for disease
10:33
control has warned against kissing
10:35
hedgehogs
10:37
how come because they can give you
10:40
illness
10:41
they can give you salmonella
10:42
specifically right and
10:44
there have been 11 in january they said
10:47
that there have been 11 people
10:49
in eight states who have got a strain of
10:51
salmonella and
10:52
in 10 of the 11 cases the people had
10:54
reported recent contact with a hedgehog
10:58
it's too much to be coincidence it's too
11:01
much it's too much i can only think that
11:02
the 11th person is lying
11:06
this happened in missouri minnesota in
11:08
colorado maine mississippi nebraska
11:10
texas and wyoming and we
11:12
already knew that hedgehogs can give you
11:14
salmonella but it seems like it's a
11:15
particularly bad strain at the moment
11:17
in america it's so widely spread across
11:19
all the different states that it makes
11:21
you think as though each state has one
11:22
person and they all know each other and
11:24
they just have a hedgehog kissing club
11:26
and they're just like sending videos
11:27
around to each other could be that or it
11:29
could be just one
11:30
widely traveled hedgehog he's just going
11:33
around
11:34
attacking people is it french kissing
11:36
that they're doing with their headshots
11:38
or is it just
11:39
it doesn't specify but i think it's
11:41
nuzzling okay
11:42
right if you imagine like a you could do
11:45
that if you're
11:45
a small child with a hedgehog wouldn't
11:47
you if i had a pet hedgehog i would
11:48
definitely kiss it at some point would
11:50
you
11:50
yeah okay i get attached
11:54
[Music]
11:55
um it's airborne right so they don't
11:57
even have to have snogged it
11:59
some hedgehog owners might have just
12:00
been near it and it's got in the dust
12:02
between the hedgehog and the camera
12:04
but it dies quite quickly in the air i
12:06
think maybe you hold the hedgehog and
12:07
then you put it down and you suck your
12:09
finger
12:10
for whatever reason you like you can
12:12
suck your finger for any reason yeah
12:14
although you shouldn't uh incidentally
12:16
while we're on giving advice about what
12:18
to do with hedgehogs you shouldn't have
12:19
sex with them
12:20
because it wasn't although in 2007 a
12:24
serbian man needed emergency surgery
12:27
after he had sex with a hedgehog on a
12:28
witch doctor's advice
12:30
um she told him it would cure his
12:31
premature ejaculation
12:33
and it actually just left him severely
12:35
lacerated because they're covered in
12:37
needles
12:37
[Music]
12:37
[Laughter]
12:40
anywho sorry salmonella yes so um
12:43
other other animals in the u.s that can
12:46
give you salmonella or that have given
12:48
people salmonella in the last few years
12:50
include chickens ducklings guinea pigs
12:52
frogs turtles
12:53
geckos and bearded dragons
12:56
have all given people salmonella
12:58
recently all from kissing or from
13:00
i don't know i don't know what kind of
13:02
eating undercooked bearded dragons you
13:04
know
13:04
is slightly
13:08
turtle was on that list and i was
13:09
reading a story of um in china there was
13:11
a man who made the news not too long ago
13:13
because he
13:14
decided to get rid of his pet turtle so
13:16
he was releasing it back into the wild
13:18
and as he did so he decided to give it a
13:20
goodbye kiss
13:21
um but unfortunately it was a snapping
13:23
turtle and it grabbed onto his lower lip
13:25
and refused to let go um and you can see
13:28
video footage of his face
13:30
which does not look good basically it
13:32
kind of locked on and didn't come
13:34
off um yeah so don't kiss turtles i
13:36
think just don't kiss
13:38
other animals is that as well isn't it
13:40
well
13:41
there's except there is a study uh i
13:44
think it was in 2015 and it was
13:46
analyzing you know how people kiss their
13:47
dogs
13:48
yeah i mean i include that in animals
13:50
yeah no you're right too
13:52
but um it was at the university of
13:54
arizona and they were
13:55
trying to find out whether the microbes
13:57
in dog guts might be good for
13:59
humans okay and whether they might
14:01
actually it's like having a probiotic
14:03
yogurt basically kissing a dog
14:05
right um it is not as delicious but
14:08
it's weird this is really weird dogs and
14:11
their owners end up having very similar
14:12
gut bacteria
14:14
so you end up with the same kind of
14:16
microbiome
14:18
and so the study was pairing people with
14:19
dogs for three months and testing them
14:21
to see if there was any change yeah is
14:24
that so does that mean it's a good idea
14:26
to kiss your dog because at least that
14:27
you won't get strange bacteria or it's
14:28
kind of pointless actually because
14:29
you're not getting any new bacteria you
14:31
didn't have already yeah
14:32
i think they were saying it could have
14:33
good effects but also obviously it could
14:35
have bad effects because
14:37
what a useful piece of advice
14:40
it probably means if you have your dog's
14:42
bacteria in your stomach
14:44
then it'd be easier for you to digest um
14:46
dog food
14:48
yeah come brexit we can all get out the
14:51
pedigree chump
14:56
do you guys know the what do you think
14:58
is the
14:59
food stuff that most commonly gives
15:01
people salmonella chicken
15:03
eggs salmon oh it's a bit of salmon
15:08
i used to think that i used to think
15:09
salmon yeah
15:11
found by a guy called salmon salmon no
15:14
it's salad or something it is yeah it's
15:16
leafy greens
15:17
um so i didn't know this we don't give
15:19
them enough stick it's cucumber and
15:20
melon
15:21
are responsible for are responsible for
15:24
20
15:24
of cases of salmonella whereas chicken
15:26
is only 19.
15:28
oh what a steak enormous difference
15:31
hey it just overtook it at the last
15:33
minute i'm immediately gonna go home
15:34
throw away the melons and replace them
15:36
with raw chickens
15:37
uh anyway this is true and generally
15:41
meat so chicken beef and pork account
15:42
for 33 of salmonella poisonings
15:45
whereas leafy greens again a huge lead
15:47
with 35
15:49
and so we never talk about that and i
15:52
think the salmonella you get
15:53
from someone you get from the meat is
15:55
going to be a more virulent strain
15:57
so it produces the most deaths but
15:58
really avoid salad i think is the next
16:00
big advice
16:01
i think that's good advice um you said
16:03
that it was invented it was discovered
16:05
by mr salmon
16:06
actually discovered by his assistant
16:08
theobald smith
16:10
daniel simon was the other guy uh and
16:12
theobal smith was also the first person
16:14
to discover that ticks could spread
16:16
disease and he also discovered
16:18
anaphylaxis
16:20
did you know yes he's quite a big deal
16:22
that is a big deal it feels like he
16:23
didn't get the credit he deserved that
16:25
no smith and ella is probably a hard
16:28
word to say
16:29
that's why anaphylaxis is sometimes
16:31
called the theobold smith phenomenon
16:34
um but again don't use that in
16:35
conversation because people have no idea
16:37
what
16:37
if you're i think if you're ringing 999
16:40
when someone's having anaphylactic shock
16:42
don't say he's suffering the fear bald
16:43
smith phenomenon to sound clever
16:47
um hedgehogs yeah yeah there was a
16:50
tradition in the victorian times of
16:51
having a hedgehog in your kitchen
16:53
to go around eating insects oh wow
16:55
hedgehogs seem to make quite
16:57
fun pets for some people so they love
16:59
running in their wheels
17:00
didn't know this they love running in
17:01
their wheels more than anything so like
17:03
a hamster
17:04
but more enthusiastic and i was on these
17:06
sites which were saying
17:07
which were giving advice about how to
17:08
keep hedgehogs they were saying you've
17:10
got to take the wheel away
17:11
as soon as the hedgehog gets pregnant
17:12
because they love the wheel so much that
17:14
they'll keep running while they give
17:16
birth for instance wow
17:17
they'll often then trample down the
17:19
thing they've just given birth to
17:20
because they'll keep running
17:21
no way they won't look after their
17:23
babies because they're too busy running
17:24
in the wheel
17:25
and sometimes they pick up the little
17:27
hoglets so that's what you call the
17:28
little hedgehogs
17:29
in their mouth to take them onto the
17:30
wheel so at least they're with them but
17:31
then they'll just run over them it's
17:32
like heroin
17:33
it's like heroin yeah it's like hedgehog
17:36
heroin that's another thing you
17:37
shouldn't
17:37
indulge in well pregnant i believe
17:40
special advice
17:40
that's amazing that's incredible
17:42
incredible yeah very pregnant
17:44
um they have very loud sex hedgehogs
17:47
are they yep very loud sex especially if
17:50
they're sleeping with a man from serbia
17:52
oh for god's sake already
17:53
[Laughter]
17:58
but they do have loud sex even when
17:59
having sex with each other and there was
18:01
a man in germany who called police once
18:03
he was in his apartment and he was
18:04
reporting heavy panting happening under
18:06
the common stairwell
18:07
in his house so we called the police
18:09
saying can you stop these heavy panthers
18:13
the police came round and they just
18:15
found two mating hedgehogs under the
18:17
stairs
18:17
and as the the police spokesperson said
18:19
we just found two hedgehogs
18:21
loudly engaged in ensuring the
18:22
continuity of their species
18:24
and so they left them into it yeah
18:27
because they last a long time which is
18:28
why they could they were still doing it
18:30
when the police came around they can go
18:31
on for hours
18:32
which again i guess is why they're
18:33
particularly busy
18:40
okay it's time for fact number three and
18:42
that is my fact
18:44
my fact is scientists have finally
18:46
worked out
18:47
what time it is on saturn and what time
18:50
is it
18:51
um it's well yeah uh we don't know it's
18:54
we know how long
18:55
we know how long that i can't tell you
18:56
exactly right now what time it is on
18:58
saturn
18:58
um i can tell you how long a day is on
19:00
saturn and that's what they've worked
19:01
out it's 10 hours 33 minutes and 38
19:04
seconds now this is new from what we
19:06
thought
19:06
decades ago up by as the article says
19:09
several minutes
19:11
um it's it's a very interesting uh
19:13
reason of how they found it out so
19:15
cassini which was the spacecraft which
19:17
has been
19:17
taking all the images that we have at
19:19
saturn it's it was an incredible
19:21
mission um that has ended now um i
19:23
believe that the
19:24
cassini is actually burnt up into
19:26
saturn's atmosphere now
19:27
um but everyone was looking for how long
19:30
it took to rotate
19:31
um via looking at the planet and there
19:33
was a student
19:35
of astronomy at uc santa cruz who
19:37
started looking at the data about the
19:38
rings
19:39
of saturn and what they noticed that the
19:41
rings themselves started taking
19:43
impressions off them
19:44
kind of like how if you were having a
19:46
earthquake on earth
19:47
you could use seismology to work out how
19:49
strong it was say
19:51
they were noticing that a similar thing
19:53
was going on with the core of saturn
19:54
that was releasing
19:56
certain size seismological
19:59
waves that were being recorded in the
20:00
rings so what the guy did was he made a
20:03
simulation
20:04
of how fast the core would be turning by
20:07
using the waves that were imprinted on
20:08
the ring
20:09
on a computer simulation and by doing
20:11
that was able to match it up with what
20:13
the spin would be and that came out at
20:14
10 hours 33
20:16
minutes and 38 seconds when they
20:18
discovered the rings it was a pretty
20:19
confusing episode
20:21
so galileo the first person to observe
20:23
the rings and describe them
20:24
poor guy this is in 1610 and he saw it
20:27
with the telescope
20:28
and he sent this cryptic message to
20:30
kepler saying i've seen the highest
20:32
triform planet and kepler
20:34
told king rudolph and rudolph said what
20:35
the hell you want about galileo
20:37
and galileo said i think it's three
20:39
planets side by side because he was sort
20:40
of seeing it as three
20:42
um but then so he wanted to have another
20:44
look at it so he waited a couple of
20:45
years for some reason
20:46
and then um after a couple of years what
20:49
he didn't realize
20:50
was that he was observing them at the
20:52
saturn ring plane crossing
20:54
so that is when earth crosses like into
20:57
the exact
20:58
plane of saturn's rings so it happens
21:00
about once every 13 to 15 years
21:02
and at that point because they're so
21:04
flat if you're looking at the face on
21:05
you can't see anything
21:06
so they completely disappear so galileo
21:08
looked they'd totally gone
21:10
and he was really freaked out he said i
21:11
have no idea what's going on i'm so
21:12
sorry it seems like i've lied
21:14
that's bad luck how often does that
21:16
happen every 13 to 15 years
21:18
god so it's the same thing of that
21:19
timing you know
21:21
if we didn't look again we would assume
21:23
that it didn't have it but it was just
21:24
that little blip
21:25
yeah where suddenly it just doesn't to
21:26
us yeah and then
21:28
again a bit later oh yeah yeah the
21:30
second check how did you know it was the
21:31
same one
21:32
i would have thought i've just seen a
21:33
different one a different planet yeah
21:35
yeah
21:38
i guess i guess that's what astronomers
21:39
do for a living isn't it they could
21:41
predict where the planets were gonna be
21:42
they knew which was which
21:43
yeah he was a smart guy andy okay not
21:46
that you're not but
21:47
probably in different ways yeah i would
21:49
like to see him improvising the jade
21:51
austin play
21:53
i think we all would actually love it
21:56
i'll actually go and see
21:59
but the rings of saturn they're 180 000
22:02
miles wide and they're only 300 feet
22:04
high
22:04
yeah that's crazy they're 400 kilometers
22:07
wide
22:08
like the actual ring bit there so
22:10
they're that many miles across
22:12
around around the from one end of the
22:14
ring to the very furthest on the other
22:16
side of the planet yeah yeah
22:17
but yeah they are incredibly flat i
22:19
think someone worked out that if they
22:21
were the equivalent of paper
22:23
so if they were the thickness of paper
22:25
then you'd need a sheet of paper that
22:26
was 1.7 miles across
22:29
um wow that's the equivalent there's a
22:31
theory that
22:32
i just saw in the new scientist this
22:33
afternoon which says that the planet
22:34
pluto
22:35
might be a billion comets squished
22:37
together
22:39
well that's how all the planets are
22:40
really aren't they they're just bits of
22:42
rock and dust squished together i guess
22:44
i think there was an alternative theory
22:45
but i
22:46
literally just saw it as we sat down so
22:47
yeah even um
22:49
even saturn began as a pebble just
22:52
begins as a pebble going around
22:54
and then another pebble squashes into it
22:56
bigger pebbles bigger pebbles eventually
22:58
you've got
22:59
satin that's quite that's such a nice
23:00
fable you'll make a great dad james
23:03
your kid's feeling a bit small you can
23:04
always say even saturn was once a pebble
23:07
that's great look at him now look in
23:09
there or her
23:12
did you guys know just speaking of sort
23:13
of time and space that there are two
23:15
different
23:16
days on earth so we have two different
23:18
days there are seven
23:19
in a week oh my god i've been saying
23:22
that all wrong
23:24
oh my god what's after tuesday it's not
23:25
monday again
23:28
it's embarrassing no there are two
23:30
different types of day
23:31
on earth so there's a solar day which is
23:34
the one that we know which is the
23:35
24-hour day yeah but actually the more
23:36
legit day
23:38
so if i asked you what
23:41
is the definition of a a solar day
23:44
how quickly we spin round yeah how many
23:47
different ones have you spun around yeah
23:48
360. yeah
23:49
incorrect it's actually a tiny bit more
23:51
than 360.
23:52
so a sidereal day is 23 hours and 56
23:57
minutes
23:57
and that's how quickly the earth does
23:59
one rotation of 360 degrees
24:02
but actually because we are also
24:04
rotating around the sun
24:05
every time the earth rotates in order to
24:07
get from midday one day to exactly
24:09
midday the other
24:10
it needs to spin that tiny bit more
24:12
because you've moved around a bit more
24:13
so our 24-hour day
24:14
is actually you're spinning around a bit
24:16
more than 360 degrees and
24:18
i didn't know that wow and how does that
24:20
affect our
24:21
working life and pay and stuff well so i
24:24
think what you can say is
24:25
actually the day is four minutes shorter
24:27
than you thought so you can go home from
24:29
work four minutes earlier than you
24:30
planned great
24:32
it's going to change your life let's do
24:33
it yeah finish now
24:36
just stop this podcast four minutes
24:37
before the end
24:39
yeah so do you know how long the day is
24:41
on the sun
24:44
how long it takes the sun to re rotate
24:46
once on its axis yeah as opposed to when
24:48
it's light which is all the time
24:52
um it's 24.5 earth days
24:55
on the equator but 34 earth days at the
24:57
poles and this is always a problem isn't
24:59
it because they're big
25:00
gas things and things are spinning at
25:01
different speeds yeah so if you're on a
25:02
holiday
25:03
you would have your holiday at the pole
25:05
of the sun because you get you get
25:06
longer
25:06
still hot this time of year yeah i don't
25:10
know if you want longer
25:11
i think you want to shorten that holiday
25:12
as much as possible if you're holding on
25:13
the sun don't you well
25:15
unless you've got very good good factor
25:17
good factor sun cream yeah okay
25:19
that's amazing though it has two
25:20
different days or three
25:22
endless different days okay so
25:25
saturn saturn is a god in roman
25:28
mythology
25:29
right um so there's also jupiter jupiter
25:31
all the planets are gods basically not
25:33
earth
25:33
apart from earth all the pl unless you
25:36
count gaia who's greek
25:38
goddess but jupiter's father jupiter is
25:42
the fifth planet then the saturn the
25:44
sixth
25:44
jupiter's father is saturn right right
25:48
and then the next planet is uranus
25:50
and uranus is the father of saturn so
25:53
jupiter next planet father next planet
25:57
the solar system is basically a big who
25:59
do you think you are
26:00
yeah in some traditions mars the fourth
26:03
planet is the son of
26:04
jupiter so that so yeah it's like a
26:07
family tree going outwards that's a way
26:09
you can remember
26:10
and so is uranus's father neptune
26:14
i think we didn't know about neptune the
26:15
father of all the gods is that cartoon
26:17
dog
26:22
that is really cool right yeah yeah it's
26:24
pluto knocked out because that just
26:25
didn't work for the system it actually
26:27
is a planet but they're like no
26:28
no
26:34
okay it is time for a final fact of the
26:37
show and that
26:38
is jaczynski my fact is that the first
26:40
ever blood transfusion to be
26:42
scientifically recorded used a goose
26:44
quill to connect an artery in the neck
26:46
of one dog to the jugular vein
26:48
in the neck of another and i was
26:50
successful
26:51
the dog was okay one of the dogs was
26:53
okay
26:55
it was half a success it was well the
26:57
dog was okay that they wanted to be okay
26:59
was receiving blood exactly so it's
27:01
actually quite i mean this was done in
27:03
1666 by a guy called richard
27:05
lower or lower who was from cornwall and
27:07
he traveled up to the royal society in
27:09
london and did it in front of an
27:10
audience
27:11
and he apparently got a medium-sized dog
27:14
i don't know why the size was that
27:15
relevant but
27:16
he severed its jugular and bled it until
27:19
it was approaching death
27:20
and then thought okay cool now we can
27:22
see if we can save this dog
27:24
and he did that by then sort of severing
27:26
the artery of a secondary dog
27:28
attaching a quill between the two and
27:30
siphoning the blood from the secondary
27:31
dog into the next one but then you need
27:33
a third dog to save the second dog and
27:35
um
27:35
indeed yeah they call that day the
27:36
massacre of 500 dogs
27:39
no it would only ever be the massacre of
27:41
one it's only over the last dog on the
27:42
conglomerate oh yeah
27:44
could you not like put it in like a
27:46
circle so that everyone gets everyone
27:48
else
27:48
oh yeah wow he should have done that i
27:50
don't know why he didn't do two
27:51
goose quills and swap them but no he
27:53
didn't he just bled you could put it in
27:54
the second coil at the back end of the
27:56
dog couldn't you
27:57
one in the neck of the dog and one of
27:58
the bum of the dog it works like that
28:00
doesn't it
28:01
and then you get the blood just going
28:02
around you know you've got two hearts
28:03
you've got two circulatory systems
28:05
yeah it's just like a circuit doesn't go
28:07
from the head to the bottom of the
28:08
fabric
28:12
yeah i think that would work yeah he
28:14
said the transfusion came to an end when
28:16
the admittant dog which is the one who
28:18
gave the blood
28:19
uh began to cry and faint and fall into
28:21
convulsions and at last
28:23
die oh yeah they weren't the animal
28:26
rights weren't as strong in the old
28:28
phrase
28:29
but it was successful which is kind of
28:31
weird actually because just like humans
28:33
really when you're doing blood
28:34
transfusions in pets it's good to have
28:36
the same blood type
28:37
i think dogs have the same blood type i
28:39
know cats have a a b
28:40
and b yeah i think they're different a's
28:43
and b's aren't they
28:44
as in the different proteins on the oh
28:46
are they i believe so
28:48
but hang on would a would that's a i've
28:50
never considered that would a
28:51
great dane have different types of blood
28:54
to a scotty
28:55
species so all dogs can give blood to
28:58
all other dogs
28:59
but i a feeling they can't give it to
29:00
humans because of the pro
29:02
the antigens on the um yes although i
29:04
didn't know they could give it to all
29:05
other dogs i think so it's the same
29:07
species isn't it it's just different
29:08
yeah but all humans can't give blood to
29:09
all other humans oh sorry
29:10
no yeah you're right yeah so it's the
29:12
same as humans as well so
29:14
scotty and a taipei schnauzer yes that
29:16
would be yeah yeah yeah
29:17
yeah if you're a bird uh any kind of
29:19
bird then you can
29:20
have a transfusion from any other kind
29:22
of bird wow
29:24
so robin could donate to an ostrich but
29:25
you'd need quite a lot of robins
29:29
that's incredible yeah so but so
29:31
donating blood between
29:33
um animals uh they started
29:36
you know injecting blood from let's say
29:38
a calf into a person that was a few
29:40
a year later after this first experiment
29:42
and he died um so it was banned for a
29:44
long time the person died yeah
29:46
um but there was this weird uh rash of
29:48
cases in the mid 19th century
29:50
where doctors just started uh saying
29:52
well milk will probably
29:54
work just as well and putting milk into
29:56
people's bloodstreams directly yeah yeah
29:58
they they thought because it's got these
29:59
little oily droplets and fatty droplets
30:01
they thought
30:02
well they might turn into white blood
30:03
cells and they just
30:05
there were two doctors called bovel and
30:07
hodder and this is all from
30:08
i found this uh journal called
30:10
transfusion and this is the 1969 edition
30:13
but they wrote up the whole thing
30:14
and their first patient um was said to
30:16
respond dramatically
30:18
to 12 ounces of cow's milk but
30:21
two other patients who they transfuse
30:22
the following week died and people kept
30:24
dying as well
30:25
when they say respond dramatically
30:30
and it happened and for 25 years at
30:33
least
30:34
that people were just putting milk into
30:35
your blood well they started
30:37
that's how they started doing it even in
30:38
the 17th century so christopher wren did
30:41
a lot of this bizarrely before he got
30:43
into building cathedrals
30:44
but he was involved with richard lowe
30:46
with his first transfusion and he used
30:48
to inject dogs with water milk
30:50
beer wine and opium to see if any of
30:52
them worked as blood transfusions
30:54
and he once said i have injected wine
30:55
and nail into a living dog
30:57
into the mass of blood by a vein in good
30:59
quantities
31:00
till i have made him extremely drunk but
31:02
soon after he pisseth
31:04
it out but also um
31:07
the idea of putting animal blood into
31:09
humans there was a big
31:10
theological debate about what you would
31:12
be doing if you were putting
31:13
foreign blood into someone else's body
31:15
because supposedly the soul would be
31:17
contained
31:18
inside some of that blood so you're
31:19
altering the whole person
31:21
so what they used to plan out was if
31:24
they were going for someone who was a
31:25
bit wild
31:26
they would get sheep's blood because
31:27
that was a calm nurturing jesus-like
31:29
animal
31:30
that would then give a sort of balance
31:32
of a soul
31:33
to this wild character equally if they
31:35
had someone who was very shy
31:37
they might adopt an animal that had a
31:39
bit more of a wild attitude and
31:41
and the idea was to inject them with
31:42
that blood yeah um although it's so
31:45
put jesus like lamb lamb god of god
31:48
okay yeah yeah yeah similarities there's
31:50
a weird
31:51
thing this is so i'm just taking blood
31:53
and putting it into other people
31:55
um we've said before you know the secret
31:57
service in america they have several
31:58
pints of the president's blood type yeah
32:00
his in his car which is pretty cool but
32:04
i read this piece in the atlantic about
32:06
how the secret service was protecting
32:08
barack obama's dna
32:10
because you know we all shed millions of
32:12
sales a day
32:13
so the dna is intact so if you let's say
32:17
the president shook hands with you and
32:18
you got a few live cells or he sneezed
32:20
and he threw away the tissue
32:22
um you could make you can now make cells
32:24
into other cell types so you could
32:26
make synthetic sperm cells from
32:29
the president's sneeze in a tissue and
32:32
then you can
32:33
you know they can't fertilize eggs with
32:34
them but you could say oh look we've got
32:36
evidence of this
32:38
so they could what you could say is they
32:40
might clone
32:41
barack obama i think it's not exactly
32:43
that you'd make another
32:45
president but do you want another why do
32:47
you want another one who doesn't want a
32:48
son
32:50
i'll take a sterile sperm cell of barack
32:53
obama's president of america um but well
32:56
you could so you could fabricate
32:57
evidence of an affair
32:59
or you can or for example you can
33:01
analyze the genetic markers
33:02
uh of diseases that you could say well
33:04
he's more prone to
33:05
alzheimer's or to this heart disease and
33:08
you could cast out on their legitimacy
33:10
that way prove that he was born in
33:11
africa
33:12
yeah you could yeah so this this is a
33:15
real
33:15
problem so do they presumably have
33:17
trump's dna as well
33:19
i think a lot of people have trump's dna
33:24
in japan blood type is a super important
33:27
thing isn't it
33:28
i don't think we've mentioned before i
33:29
think we've done it on qi but it's on
33:31
job applications and stuff it's so
33:33
related to
33:34
thought to be so related to who you are
33:35
and what you're like kind of like how we
33:37
see maybe star signs but
33:39
much more believed in and invested in
33:42
and yeah you'll have to say
33:43
on your application what blood type you
33:44
are but they i mean saying horoscopes
33:46
they
33:46
in the morning tv shows in japan they
33:48
have the blood type horoscopes they do
33:50
do that
33:51
um and yeah and on an asian
33:54
um asian countries on their facebook
33:56
profiles that tends to be a thing and
33:58
you're about
33:58
you would have your blood type in there
34:00
because it tells you a lot about
34:02
who you are for potential you know i
34:04
didn't even know what my blood type was
34:05
until earlier this year
34:07
that's weird isn't it yeah i don't i
34:09
still don't know mine i don't know i
34:10
don't know i always call my mom whenever
34:11
i need to know it
34:12
[Laughter]
34:14
she knows well she's very deaf though so
34:16
she always says hey
34:22
[Laughter]
34:29
[Music]
34:33
okay that's it that is all of our facts
34:35
thank you so much for listening if you'd
34:37
like to get in contact with any of us
34:38
about the things that we have said over
34:40
the course of this podcast
34:41
we can be found on our twitter accounts
34:42
i'm on at schreiberland andy at andrew
34:45

00:04
[Music]
00:10
hello
00:11
and welcome to another episode of no
00:13
such thing as a fish
00:15
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
00:16
qi offices in covent garden
00:19
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
00:20
here next to james harkin
00:22
who is sitting next to andrew hunter
00:24
murray and then rounding off the circle
00:27
in between andrew and myself is anna
00:29
chazinski
00:30
and once again we have gathered around
00:31
the microphones with our four favorite
00:33
facts from the last seven days
00:35
and in no particular order here we go
00:38
starting with you the man sitting next
00:40
to me
00:42
james harkin and if at home you can work
00:44
out because there's only one man
00:45
sat next to dan if you remember the
00:47
situation that was all around the table
00:49
genius so who is it me yeah sorry
00:52
my fact this week is that animal
00:54
metabolism was first proven
00:56
by antoine lavoisier in an experiment
00:59
where he put a guinea pig in a freezer
01:04
okay so a couple of caveats to this um
01:06
freezers haven't been invented yet
01:09
it's the first one um so it was in an
01:13
ice calorimeter um which is a container
01:16
inside another container which is full
01:18
of ice so it's a way that people would
01:20
keep things cool in those days but it's
01:21
not freeza per se i wouldn't say
01:23
it's kind of like a thermos flask but
01:25
it's got ice instead of a vacuum
01:27
yes okay yeah that's fair enough um but
01:29
it was important that it was ice rather
01:30
than a vacuum because it was the amount
01:32
of ice that melted
01:33
which he measured and that worked out
01:36
how much heat was given off by the
01:37
guinea pig
01:38
and it was heat just from living from
01:40
the guinea pig and he realized that this
01:42
was a kind of metabolism
01:44
which is a bit like combustion so
01:46
combustion is where you burn
01:47
organic material to get energy and
01:49
metabolism is where you kind of burn
01:51
sugars to get energy for the body
01:53
and he worked out that these two were
01:54
kind of the same thing
01:55
[Music]
01:56
and he i thought he'd sort of invented
01:58
the device or was it there anyway
02:00
i don't know about that the way i heard
02:02
it described which is quite good to
02:03
visualize is like one of those water
02:04
coolers in an office
02:05
um but so it had the guinea pig in the
02:08
middle then it had another water cooler
02:10
around it with the
02:11
ice and then it had another water cooler
02:12
around it with snow didn't it because he
02:14
had to insulate the ice
02:15
i don't know where he was getting huge
02:16
amounts of snow so he stuffed the
02:18
outside with snow so the ice didn't melt
02:20
for other reasons
02:21
amazing guy though like i wouldn't be
02:22
surprised if he did invent that because
02:24
the guy invented so much
02:25
i mean he's a bit new to me i have to
02:27
say but you know he created oxygen
02:30
i mean and thank god for him because
02:32
before that
02:33
it was really hard to breathe he created
02:35
carbon dioxide like we all do
02:37
oh yeah he created that but then he
02:38
found the word oxygen yeah
02:41
yeah because he so obviously priestly is
02:44
the person that most people associate
02:45
with oxygen because priestly
02:47
worked out that this weird thing was
02:48
happening during combustion and so he
02:50
went to
02:51
la voisier and said hey look at this and
02:53
it was fuzzy who kind of explained it
02:55
but i think priestley didn't think it
02:57
was oxygen
02:58
that was being generated he thought it
03:00
was deflogisticated air yes that it so
03:04
the idea was that uh there was this
03:05
substance called phlogiston
03:07
which was in lots and lots of materials
03:09
and it really wanted to burn so once you
03:11
burn something it was released
03:13
so basically as soon as you burn
03:15
something the flogestan was released
03:16
and then you just had well oxygen left
03:18
over but he just thought it was deep
03:20
logisticated air and i think for the
03:21
next 30 years of his life he refused to
03:23
believe
03:23
lavoisier's rival and correct
03:25
interpretation of what oxygen was and
03:27
continue to call it deep logistically
03:28
today
03:29
in fairness they're pretty much the same
03:30
thing but just with one of them a way
03:32
worse name
03:33
yeah yeah the weird thing is he did all
03:35
of this stuff on his day off
03:37
which is so cool so he was a taxman
03:40
really he had a vast tax organization as
03:42
paris chief taxman basically and he
03:44
worked six hours
03:45
uh he worked six hours every week um now
03:48
he worked six days
03:48
in france um for 20 years he worked six
03:52
days a week he did all his science
03:54
uh his experiments on one day a week and
03:56
he did a little bit of work in the
03:58
mornings
03:59
and that actually led to his death
04:01
partly his job as a tax man
04:03
because he was guillotined on trumped-up
04:06
charges of tax fraud
04:07
but really he'd be really unpopular
04:09
since the time he suggested an
04:10
a wall around paris he suggested a
04:13
seventh wall around paris
04:15
i can't imagine why anyone would object
04:16
to the political suggestion of a wall
04:19
he said it was to make the tax system
04:21
fairer and a lot of people said it's not
04:22
that it's to squeeze the poor
04:24
and um it got torn down in the
04:26
revolution
04:28
as a tax um as a tax collector he was
04:30
quite reformist and i think a lot of
04:31
people say that he probably wouldn't
04:33
have been beheaded during the french
04:34
revolution if it weren't for the fact
04:35
that he
04:36
really pissed off marat didn't he who
04:38
was you know
04:39
notorious kind of quite bloodthirsty
04:42
revolutionary
04:43
but who also fancied himself as a
04:45
scientist um
04:46
so marat wanted to get into the academy
04:49
of sciences
04:50
where lavoisier was very influential and
04:52
murat believed in stuff like animal
04:53
magnetism which we've talked about
04:55
before where
04:56
and he said he could see things like
04:57
magnetism and mesmerism leaking from
04:59
objects he said he saw it leaking from
05:01
the head of benjamin franklin
05:02
for instance so he applied to the
05:04
academy of sciences with these theories
05:06
and lavoisier said no you can't come in
05:08
this sounds like nonsense to me and he
05:10
held a grudge against him ever since and
05:11
it was him who said as soon as the
05:13
opportunity arose let's chop that guy's
05:14
head off
05:15
he insulted me and he saw a lot of stuff
05:16
leaking from leblaire's head
05:19
yeah actually what happened was in fact
05:21
this didn't happen but there is a myth
05:22
that lavoisier asked one of his
05:24
assistants because he was a great
05:25
scientist
05:26
to watch him as he had his head chopped
05:28
off and he was going to keep blinking
05:30
and to see how long he blinked for
05:31
after the chop off that is so cool wait
05:34
but that didn't happen
05:35
it didn't it's that's a famous myth
05:37
isn't it i didn't know that was to do
05:38
with him that's so cool
05:40
just on his head um a century after he
05:42
died um there was a
05:43
there was a statue that was erected of
05:45
him up in paris but no one quite noticed
05:47
at the time that it wasn't his head
05:49
on the statue they'd use the wrong head
05:51
basically the guy who was sculpting it
05:52
um didn't have enough money um so he
05:55
found a spare head
05:57
and it was the secretary of the academy
05:58
of sciences who was there during
06:00
lavoisier's last years and they used his
06:02
head instead on the thing i think the
06:03
idea was he was going to sculpt
06:05
lavazzi's head
06:06
over it when you say they used to said
06:07
they obviously didn't like plant his
06:09
head on top of a statue i mean they used
06:10
him as a model to sculpt
06:12
no they used they used like an old
06:14
statue head
06:15
of it obviously it wasn't like but not
06:18
the actual not an actual head no this is
06:20
a country
06:21
how many statues have actual headlines
06:26
you can tell with a statue if the horse
06:28
has got one leg off the ground they died
06:30
in battle
06:30
if it has the person's actual head they
06:32
died
06:35
[Laughter]
06:44
um it's really sad though because he was
06:45
exonerated a year and a half after his
06:47
death
06:48
that's only 18 months for a rapid
06:50
turnaround in his reputation and he had
06:51
a massive funeral
06:52
three thousand people came there was a
06:54
hundred strong choir singing
06:56
and there was a bust of him which was
06:58
crowned with the wreath and this huge
06:59
tomb
07:00
all despite the fact that his body was
07:02
headless and buried in a mass grave
07:04
somewhere because of the revolution
07:05
yeah wow when he was 28 he married
07:08
this 13 year old and
07:11
he put this girl to work translating
07:14
scientific papers from different
07:16
countries
07:17
and then basically once he got all this
07:18
stuff translated he then
07:20
magically discovered things wow
07:23
okay she was awesome though she was so
07:26
cool um yeah
07:27
marianne pierret pauls and yeah she was
07:30
13 but i think
07:31
she liked him a lot and she married him
07:33
to get away from marrying a 50 year old
07:34
so this kind of happy story
07:37
but it was her father who effectively
07:39
got them married to
07:40
this 50 year old count and apparently
07:42
they used to he used to come around
07:44
their house and they'd play board games
07:45
together
07:46
so it's a beautiful romance if you
07:47
discount the 13 year old thing
07:49
but she was scientifically very adept at
07:52
its thought and a lot of this stuff that
07:53
he did
07:54
may have involved her but she wouldn't
07:55
have been credited she did amazing
07:57
scientific drawings and stuff
07:58
yeah you know there was one experiment
08:00
he did where he kept a pelican
08:01
full of water at boiling point for 101
08:04
days
08:05
for what 101 consecutive days well it
08:08
must have been dead after the first
08:10
20 minutes well the thing you need to
08:11
know about this is that a pelican is a
08:12
kind of specialist water container
08:17
how did you guys going though you did um
08:20
i quite like the fact that he was able
08:22
to sort of
08:23
do the foundations of metabolism off
08:24
this one experiment because people have
08:26
been toying with it for a very long time
08:28
and it must have really annoyed
08:29
one guy in particular called santorio
08:31
santorio you read about him
08:33
he um he spent 30 years using a chair
08:36
device to weigh himself and everything
08:38
that he ate and drank as well as his
08:40
urine and feces
08:41
and the idea was he was comparing the
08:42
weight of what he'd eaten and that
08:44
that was coming out the waste products
08:46
um so
08:47
the whole point was to work out the
08:49
foundations of metabolism but 30 years
08:52
and he didn't really get to a final
08:53
point
08:54
old mate puts a guinea pig in the
08:56
freezer and i don't think it would have
08:57
been that personal because he'd been
08:59
dead for at least 150 years
09:00
oh yeah i didn't look at the birth and
09:02
death that's true cool
09:04
actually i feel better about it if you
09:05
were doing that experiment you really
09:06
wouldn't want to mix up
09:08
the tray on which you weigh all your
09:09
food and then the tray on which you
09:11
weigh all your pieces
09:14
you probably label them yeah
09:17
but the idea is the logic presumably
09:19
behind what he did was that he was
09:21
trying to prove
09:22
that what he ate weighed much more than
09:24
what was coming out of him right
09:25
and so obviously uh lavoisier's theory
09:27
proven to be correct and the
09:28
overarching theory of kind of existence
09:31
as we have it now
09:32
is that whatever goes in has to come out
09:34
in some form like whatever matter goes
09:36
in that amount of matter has to come out
09:38
so if it's not being pooed out it's
09:40
coming out somewhere else exactly
09:41
he worked out for every eight pounds of
09:44
food he ate
09:45
he excreted only three pounds of feces
09:48
and he worked out that about half a
09:49
pound of air was coming out of his mouth
09:52
and
09:52
various stuff coming out of different
09:53
parts of his body and this was all in
09:55
his 16
09:56
14 book arse the statica medicina
10:00
arts it's obviously art come
10:09
did he it was it consistent for him did
10:11
he like would he be out to dinner and
10:13
suddenly feel the need to poo and sort
10:14
of have to dash off to the lab so what
10:16
makes me think it's
10:17
oh you mean did he do it every single
10:19
year yeah was it i don't think people
10:20
went out to restaurants in the same way
10:22
so you haven't been invented at that
10:23
time really dinner party maybe then
10:26
yeah if you invited him over to dinner
10:28
maybe he brought his contraption with
10:30
him
10:32
just left his feces straight by the dog
10:36
no dietary requirements but i will need
10:38
to weigh
10:42
um so one of the things that's crucial
10:44
to metabolism which we all learned and
10:46
you know gcse
10:47
biology is enzymes huge deal right
10:50
so enzymes are the thing that speeds up
10:53
all metabolic processes
10:54
but i just always find it so amazing
10:57
that these things would happen
10:58
if enzymes didn't exist um so the
11:01
enzymes are the proteins that sit there
11:02
and they tell
11:03
processes to happen and um they tell
11:05
like different molecules to pair up with
11:06
each other and
11:07
process things and if they didn't exist
11:11
then things would happen much more
11:13
slowly so for instance there's an enzyme
11:14
called
11:15
phosphatase which is used for things
11:17
like signaling between our cells and
11:19
like transmitting hormone impulses
11:21
between us totally necessary for life
11:23
and uh one little reaction involving
11:26
phosphatase takes 10 milliseconds
11:28
without that enzyme it would take 1
11:30
trillion years
11:34
so you would still be able to eat and
11:36
still pour it out
11:37
yeah you'd be putting it out a trillion
11:39
years in the future yeah
11:40
i mean more yeah so which is like 100
11:43
times longer than the universe has been
11:44
around but
11:45
it's a long wait if you took all the
11:47
enzymes out of someone you fed them a
11:49
snack
11:49
what would happen so all the the stuff
11:52
would go into your body
11:54
yeah and your body would still try to
11:56
excrete it so yeah you just wouldn't
11:57
digest it
11:58
so you wouldn't get any of the pr any of
12:00
the energy or anything like that
12:01
so you'd just be reusable
12:04
you wouldn't need different trays
12:11
so there's i've read a really cool thing
12:12
about metabolism which is about the
12:14
difference between a shrew and an
12:15
elephant's metabolism
12:16
yeah so shrews have very very fast
12:19
metabolisms
12:20
their hearts got 1500 beats per minute
12:22
and they have to eat twice their body
12:24
weight every day
12:25
twice their body weight every single day
12:27
but um
12:28
every gram of its body uses 67 times
12:31
more oxygen than a single gram of a
12:33
human body
12:34
so they have incredibly fast metabolisms
12:36
they digest does that mean they have to
12:38
breathe in lots of oxygen
12:39
it does yeah they need way more oxygen
12:41
proportional to their
12:43
body than elephants do whereas elephants
12:46
there was this essay online about why
12:47
elephants don't explode
12:50
so elephants have trillions more cells
12:52
on their inside so they're
12:54
they're much hotter on the inside right
12:56
because their insides are
12:56
proportionately bigger than
12:58
their skins you know an elephant is 250
13:00
000 times larger than a mouse but it's
13:02
only got 5 000 times the surface area
13:04
so then the big problem is how to let
13:06
all that heat out
13:08
you know and elephants as a result have
13:11
a much slower metabolism so they don't
13:12
burn
13:13
food or fuel at the same rate they run
13:16
much much cooler than a mouse or a shrew
13:18
which has you know little heaters turned
13:20
up really really high
13:22
and so it gets through a lot of fuel
13:23
really really fast so it's just that
13:24
they slow their metabolism but doesn't
13:26
that mean because the shrew is still
13:27
covered in fur
13:28
so they must be hot all the time yeah
13:30
they're always running around
13:31
they're just always running around then
13:33
probably yeah yeah that guinea pig
13:35
when he got in the freezer must have
13:36
been like oh thank
13:41
hey i was reading a tiny bit about
13:42
guinea pigs um
13:44
and about guinea pig shows did you so
13:46
they're quite a big thing and they've
13:48
been a big thing on tv shows
13:49
not on tv shows they're like like dog
13:52
shows they've been around since
13:53
victorian times and now people take them
13:56
really
13:56
seriously so there are over 400 guinea
13:59
pig shows in britain every year what
14:01
uh i was reading an article about a
14:03
guinea pig show winner
14:05
who's a person who owns lots of winning
14:07
guinea pigs he's called tony tancock
14:09
tony yeah
14:14
that he's also he's also the nude
14:17
sunbathing champion of britain
14:21
so he's got more than 50 guinea pigs but
14:24
uh he had six shoguny pigs stolen before
14:27
a show recently
14:28
outrageous um and you think it's just
14:30
for rivalry because actually even the
14:32
best show guinea pigs the most valuable
14:34
the ones who've won the most
14:35
competitions
14:36
changed hands for about 30 pounds each
14:43
[Music]
14:46
okay it's time for fact number two and
14:48
that is andy
14:50
my fact is that britain has a special
14:51
team of leaked detectives who listen to
14:53
the sound of water using a special stick
14:57
i've seen it i've seen it happen yeah i
15:00
was walking
15:00
um with my son and there were these two
15:02
guys standing in the middle of the road
15:04
and one was leaning into a stick it
15:06
looks like a very long upside down
15:08
plunger
15:08
so if he had his head sort of in this
15:11
rubbery thing
15:12
and he said no and then he lifted the
15:14
stick up and he moved about a meter down
15:15
he went there it is and i didn't know
15:17
what the hell they were doing so i just
15:18
took my son away from it
15:21
i thought he was just plunging his ear
15:24
some wet hair
15:25
out of his brain they were
15:28
they were using a victorian device which
15:30
is still used today to spot leaks in
15:32
underground pipes it's obviously very
15:34
hard to spot leaks because they're
15:35
they're in underground pipes so but they
15:37
do the pipes do
15:38
um the sticks vibrate when a leak is
15:40
detected
15:42
and um they're often used at night
15:43
because it means that there's less
15:44
traffic around so it's easier to detect
15:46
a stick
15:47
and is it is it like acoustic vibrations
15:50
from the sound of the leak coming out of
15:51
the
15:51
thing okay so that vibrates the stick
15:54
and do they introduce themselves at sort
15:55
of a parties do they just say i'm a
15:57
detective and you did it
16:00
and then it really realized oh thank god
16:02
my husband's missing
16:05
let me fetch my stick
16:08
it's like um all these pipes make some
16:11
kind of noise
16:12
um but the gurgle of water going through
16:14
a pipe is uh
16:15
slightly different if there's a hole in
16:17
it
16:19
i can believe that so they yeah they
16:21
they they just must know the sound
16:23
really well
16:24
and it seems to work really well because
16:25
in a 12-month period from an article i
16:27
read
16:27
um they've managed to find 18 000 leaks
16:30
using this stick
16:31
wow and it's extremely necessary so
16:34
leaks are a
16:35
massive water problem in this country we
16:38
have more than three billion litres of
16:39
water leaks per year
16:41
thames water which is the biggest water
16:42
provider has 20 500 liters escaping
16:45
every day
16:46
per kilometer escaping so yeah getting
16:48
out they want to be free
16:50
but it's true and it's treated water
16:51
isn't it it's water that should be good
16:53
enough to come out of the tap
16:54
absolutely right so one-fifth of the
16:56
water that's been treated that we're
16:57
supposed to be drinking or using in our
16:58
homes one-fifth of it leaks away every
17:00
year
17:00
i mean it's terrible it's so wasteful
17:03
it's a lot
17:04
uh there is one way of finding leaks
17:06
that's not the acoustic sticks
17:08
but it's sniffer dogs so they've
17:10
recently been employed and i think
17:11
scotland is the first place to employ
17:13
them there are two cocker spaniels named
17:15
snipe and denzel
17:17
who again i think trump is really strong
17:20
it's like they feel like they've been
17:21
seconded over from the murder squad
17:23
yeah i don't think the water dogs should
17:24
be called snipe and denzel i know i feel
17:26
sorry for them
17:28
puddle and splash or something
17:32
no they are and what's also sad about
17:33
snipe and denzel is that
17:35
they've been trained by these two
17:37
soldiers who used to serve in
17:39
afghanistan and iraq
17:40
and did train sniffer dogs there and
17:43
these two people now decided quite sweet
17:45
he came back from afghanistan
17:46
iraq and decided to start training dogs
17:48
to sniff out bed bugs
17:49
and then to sniff out leaks and so this
17:51
is what they do and the way they do it
17:53
is they are trained to detect tiny tiny
17:55
amounts of chlorine because obviously
17:56
our water is chlorinated
17:58
wow and so they can tell yeah it's
18:00
impressive isn't it
18:02
so for companies leakages in say even
18:04
bathrooms if you're a big company and
18:06
you have huge buildings that
18:07
results in huge amounts of money being
18:09
lost so pepsi the article i was reading
18:11
pepsico
18:12
the worked out that the money that the
18:13
person was being paid in that one
18:15
building to be the leak detective
18:16
was the same amount of money roughly
18:18
that they were saving in
18:20
what they would have lost through bills
18:22
does that mean they might as well just
18:23
fire him
18:24
it does yeah yeah well i can't yeah it
18:26
doesn't cancel itself out so you might
18:28
as well just fire him he's
18:29
completely he's redundant well done dan
18:31
thanks very much
18:32
that guy's gonna listen to this if he
18:34
walks out of the building
18:36
it must be that they saved way more than
18:38
him yeah it must be right
18:40
and you presented that as though it was
18:41
going to be a positive thing i feel like
18:43
i thought weirdly
18:45
it was like hire me but it will be like
18:46
you're not wasting any money you're
18:48
just it will be a zero because you're
18:50
not losing them i mean you're bringing
18:51
nothing to this company
18:53
that's like it's like having someone
18:54
it's like pepsi hiring someone to make a
18:57
can of pepsi
18:58
but it cost them like 70 p to hire this
19:01
guy
19:02
and then they sell it for 70p what's the
19:04
point of that this is the actual
19:05
sentence in the article an employee
19:07
there had convinced his boss that saving
19:09
water would also save enough money to
19:11
pay for the employee's time spent
19:12
tracking and repairing leaks
19:14
he must do some other stuff yeah or
19:16
maybe he also works in i.t
19:18
that's possible maybe the leak is bad
19:20
enough that there's water leaking and
19:22
gushing all the way through the building
19:23
and so actually you're you're preventing
19:26
that as well as saving the cost of the
19:28
water
19:28
broom's not being used so at least it
19:30
cancels out just on them see it did make
19:32
sense
19:32
well i think by enough he i think that
19:35
might have been a miscreant he means
19:37
you'll save
19:38
you know more than that yeah more than
19:40
enough more than enough
19:41
more more yeah um
19:44
one group of not people but things that
19:47
are good at looking for leaks
19:48
is beavers because beavers make dams as
19:52
we all know
19:53
and they will always plug any leaks in
19:56
their dams because it's really important
19:57
that they have lots of water behind them
19:59
because they use the water to hide them
20:01
and so if they get a tiny little hole
20:03
then they'll immediately put sticks and
20:04
stuff in
20:05
but humans don't really like dams and so
20:08
we'll often put like little
20:09
tubes in there to try and let the water
20:11
go through the dams and then the beavers
20:13
will
20:14
kind of plug it up and so um
20:17
anyway so they've invented this thing
20:19
called a beaver deceiver
20:23
and the beaver deceiver is like it's
20:26
almost like a triangular pipe that goes
20:28
in
20:28
so it means that the flow happens way
20:31
away from the dam
20:32
and so where the flow goes in it's not
20:34
enough of a flow for the beaver to
20:36
recognize it so you can't tell
20:38
that there's a hole in there even though
20:39
there is a hole that's really bad
20:42
so that beaver goes and sees the front
20:43
of his dam and it doesn't look like
20:44
there's a hole anywhere in there yeah if
20:46
you go
20:46
if you put a hole right in a dam then
20:48
there'll be a flow of water and the
20:50
beaver will recognize
20:51
it but if you put the beaver deceiver in
20:53
yeah then what the flow of water is
20:55
coming from quite a long way away from
20:56
the dam itself
20:58
it's much wider there so the flow is
21:00
much less it's more subtle
21:01
yeah it's been sort of dissipated i'll
21:04
be honest
21:04
it's mostly about the name that i
21:06
brought
21:06
[Laughter]
21:11
[Music]
21:13
okay it is time for fact number three
21:15
and that is my fact
21:17
my fact this week is that japan's cyber
21:19
security minister
21:20
has never used a computer
21:23
he's unhackable yeah he's unhackable
21:26
yeah absolutely true
21:27
yeah his name is uh yoshitaka sakurada
21:30
he's 68 years old
21:32
and he was made the deputy chief of the
21:34
government's cyber security strategy
21:36
office he also is looking over
21:37
as the minister for the olympic and
21:39
paralympic committee
21:40
um for the 2020 games and he's never
21:43
thrown a javelin either
21:46
this guy is so unqualified but he was in
21:48
uh he was in a parliamentary committee
21:49
meeting and it was during there just
21:51
after he'd been given the post of cyber
21:53
security minister that he said that he
21:54
had never used
21:55
a computer before also seemed quite
21:57
confused when a usb
21:58
was brought up not quite knowing what
22:00
that was um
22:02
so yeah pretty astonishing that this guy
22:03
has been given the post and it's been a
22:05
bit embarrassing for
22:06
um the prime minister because he was the
22:08
one who gave him the post
22:09
and in fact two days later sakurada
22:12
actually tried to contradict
22:13
that statement and said of course i have
22:16
used a computer
22:17
i just don't use it at home is what i
22:18
was saying i use it in the office
22:20
but yeah no one really but he's known
22:23
for his gaffes as well he's not someone
22:24
who's
22:25
particularly good in these parliamentary
22:28
committee meetings he
22:29
claimed that the olympics would cost
22:30
japan 1 500 yen
22:32
um instead of 150 billion yen
22:37
so 1 500 yen would work out at about 13
22:41
yeah for the olympics that's right
22:43
bargain it would be a bargain wouldn't
22:44
it if you could do it for that much
22:46
amazing yeah well if the olympics bring
22:48
in as much money as they
22:50
cost yeah a bit like that guy at pepsi
22:53
yeah you're giving him the job
22:54
as well does not have the olympics
22:56
problem solved
22:59
when he did say this about not using
23:01
computers there was a lot of people
23:02
uh online who were taking the mickey out
23:05
of him but someone did say
23:07
you don't need to know how to drive a
23:08
tractor to be a good agriculture
23:09
minister
23:10
which i think is almost a good point it
23:13
kind of is
23:14
as in the ministry if you're a minister
23:16
of something you're tending to
23:18
oversee things rather than actually
23:20
using them absolutely although that's
23:22
quite a slightly controversial thing
23:25
people sometimes object to anyway that
23:26
the person who is most senior in charge
23:28
of various
23:29
ministries like foreign affairs or
23:30
defense whatever never knows what
23:32
they're doing
23:33
but politicians in general don't that's
23:35
democracy for you
23:36
yeah you want to have some kind of you
23:38
know system where
23:39
clever people are in charge then that's
23:42
enough good luck to you
23:44
but it's always weird i'm so i was
23:46
reading i was looking into like
23:47
unqualified
23:48
ministers generally but then i did think
23:49
you know government ministers who have
23:51
suddenly shifted to transport even
23:52
though they don't even know what a bus
23:53
looks like
23:54
uh is quite strange and i read an
23:56
interview with margaret beckett in 2006
23:59
when she was suddenly shifted to be
24:01
foreign secretary and i think she'd been
24:03
environment before or agriculture before
24:05
that and she openly
24:07
said i'm completely flying by the seat
24:08
of my pants and she was appointed on
24:10
friday evening
24:12
and she had to swap over the weekend
24:14
monday morning she's just flown to
24:15
discuss iran negotiations with
24:17
condoleezza rice
24:19
that's a baptism of fire you don't get
24:21
that in most jobs yeah
24:22
this is weird i'm reading a book kind of
24:24
about this at the moment by michael
24:25
lewis
24:26
oh yeah yeah it's called the fifth risk
24:27
and it's all about you know project
24:29
management and how you fill roles and
24:31
he's writing about the department
24:32
of energy and the guy who got the job
24:34
had previously said he wanted to shut
24:35
the department of energy down
24:37
well he said he couldn't even remember
24:38
which department he wanted to shut down
24:40
rick perry oh yeah yeah and then he was
24:43
given the job and you know it's
24:45
so it i think some level of knowledge is
24:47
probably good but there is an argument
24:49
isn't that i mean
24:50
this is a bit technical and probably
24:52
boring but there is an argument that
24:54
you should just have people in charge
24:55
who know what they're doing
24:57
um but the argument against that seems
24:59
such a what a ridiculous argument
25:01
the thing is like what the we found that
25:04
democracy is better where everyone gets
25:05
a vote even though people don't really
25:07
understand what they're voting for
25:08
and that means that everyone is kind of
25:10
invested in it and so even if you make a
25:12
bad decision at least everyone's
25:14
invested in that bad decision
25:15
whereas if you promote people who are
25:17
supposed to be just good at things
25:19
number one who decides who's good at
25:21
stuff but number two
25:23
no one else is invested in that so if
25:25
things go wrong which they always do
25:27
then that's when you chuck people's
25:29
heads off that's fine i'd rather chop
25:31
one person's head off than us will have
25:32
to go down together taking the blame
25:35
call me anti-democratic i'm not saying
25:37
one's better than the other but you know
25:38
i like experts and autocracy
25:42
so on japanese computing stuff the
25:45
japanese government is currently engaged
25:47
it's just beginning a massive exercise
25:49
to hack
25:49
200 million objects
25:53
and they people they're quite worried
25:55
about cyber security
25:56
and about the internet of things you
25:58
know i think he's meant to be hacking
25:59
things
26:01
he's sitting there with a manual huge
26:03
hackers manual
26:04
this guy is probably he thinks that he's
26:06
hacking just 20 things
26:10
um and so they they're doing a five-year
26:13
experiment
26:14
hacking into the internet of things
26:16
they've just got legal permission to do
26:18
it because obviously that's right so
26:19
you're talking about like smart things
26:21
in houses and stuff exactly yeah you'll
26:23
just have a government minister suddenly
26:24
talking through your fridge to you or
26:25
something
26:27
yeah i mean sort of it's a test security
26:30
because they're very worried about
26:31
you know the chaos that could be caused
26:33
yeah um
26:34
by hacking into things and you know
26:37
people now have web enabled yoga mats
26:39
so yeah really yeah yeah
26:42
and they've all got factory settings and
26:44
the password is always zero zero zero
26:46
zero or whatever
26:47
so what's a yoga mat doing to you that
26:49
needs a smart i thought i mean it's just
26:50
a rug isn't it it's going to say to you
26:52
you're putting too much pressure on your
26:54
left wrist
26:54
so you need to change your you know the
26:57
way you're
26:58
dogging yeah you're being a bit
26:59
self-righteous and tedious about you
27:03
stop boring all your friends
27:08
no singapore did a very similar thing i
27:10
think which is i think this is a couple
27:12
of years ago
27:13
hundreds of hackers were invited by the
27:14
government to try and hack into its
27:16
defense ministry
27:17
and so and they offered the rewards so
27:19
they basically said everyone tried to
27:20
crack into our security systems
27:22
and they distributed fifteen thousand
27:24
dollars prize money
27:26
between all these hackers who
27:27
successfully said yeah i've just hacked
27:28
in here and found out that you're
27:29
planning to bomb
27:30
russia tomorrow singapore yeah i know
27:34
very surprising do you know that if you
27:37
connect to someone else's wi-fi hotspot
27:39
in singapore without the permission you
27:40
can get three years in prison
27:42
wow really yeah did not know that i
27:44
think the the whole hacking thing though
27:46
i mean
27:46
in japan particularly i guess it is a
27:48
bit of a worrying problem because
27:51
let's say tokyo that is really
27:52
implementing the idea of robots running
27:54
a lot of things
27:55
that's got to be huge problem so for
27:57
example a robot last year ran for
27:59
election
28:00
in japan and it got four thousand votes
28:02
it came third in the election
28:04
i think these things are never as far
28:05
along as the makers claim no robots are
28:07
still rubbish
28:08
and came third came third japan actually
28:12
that says more about the people voting
28:13
for it than the robot though that's
28:15
i mean america just elected a puppet
28:17
whoa
28:20
yeah japan is actually not that advanced
28:24
in computers well we i think we must
28:26
have mentioned before
28:27
but in japan computers aren't the norm
28:30
for a lot of people in the same way that
28:31
they are in the western world so fax is
28:33
still a very big thing in japan
28:35
it's really really common you wouldn't
28:36
send an email naturally if you were sort
28:38
of
28:38
booking a restaurant or something or
28:40
there was a journalist who went and she
28:42
wanted an interview with i think a
28:43
government
28:44
minister and they said you can't email
28:46
us to book an interview or use any
28:47
computers you have to do it by fax
28:49
if you're rsvp it's all by fax machine
28:51
it's so it's
28:52
i don't think it's maybe as big a deal
28:54
for this guy to have said he's never
28:56
used a computer
28:57
because it's maybe not as much the norm
28:59
in your day-to-day life desktops and
29:00
and it's all smartphones basically do
29:03
you think there's like a japanese
29:04
podcast saying that the
29:05
head of digital security in the uk has
29:08
never used a fax machine
29:11
actually speaking of that um there's
29:13
only one
29:14
mp this is in 2016 there's been an
29:16
election since but i think it's still
29:17
true there's only one mp
29:19
who um doesn't accept emails from
29:22
constituents
29:23
and you have to send them a fax instead
29:26
or a letter
29:27
and that is dr julian lewis ah he's won
29:31
the big brexit here guys
29:32
yeah uh and they found this out um there
29:34
was uh someone called my family nixon
29:36
who worked for a company called write to
29:39
them
29:40
and this is a website that lets you get
29:41
in touch with your mp
29:43
and they found out that their fax
29:44
machine had broken and they
29:46
tried to work out whether they had to
29:47
buy a new one or not and they realized
29:49
that there was only one
29:50
mp in the whole country that they needed
29:52
a fax machine for and it was this um
29:54
julian lewis guy
29:55
why the fbi is
29:58
very into faxing still in fact the fbi
30:01
in 2017
30:03
said it will no longer accept freedom of
30:05
information
30:06
requests by email it's only accepting
30:09
them by fax again
30:10
wow so that you can either fax or use
30:12
snail mail is that just
30:13
so that people go i can't be bothered
30:14
and they really i think i think it's to
30:16
make it a bit more difficult yeah
30:18
um this is a big thing in america as in
30:20
technological illiteracy by
30:22
you know senators or congress people so
30:25
when mark zuckerberg appeared in front
30:27
of
30:27
senators to answer all these questions
30:29
about facebook
30:30
he was asked questions including is
30:33
twitter the same as what you do
30:36
and um if i'm emailing within whatsapp
30:41
does that inform your advertisers what
30:44
was face mash
30:46
is it still up and running i don't know
30:47
what that's a fair one
30:52
yeah it was grading um i know yeah i
30:54
remember that yeah oh i thought it was
30:55
the thing where you
30:56
combined your face with someone else
30:58
that's what i thought when you said be
30:59
like a baby
31:00
no what are you talking like if you had
31:02
a kid and you combined your heads
31:04
i told you what your kid would look like
31:06
okay yeah
31:07
maybe maybe i'm wrong about facebook i
31:09
don't know maybe i'm wrong maybe i
31:10
thought that was his first thing
31:11
well i think we've established it's a
31:12
totally justified question
31:15
and well done for asking that's so good
31:19
though
31:19
it's like he's basically been called
31:21
down to his grandparents place but
31:23
there are a thousand grandparents there
31:32
okay it's time for our final fact of the
31:34
show and that
31:35
is cecinski my fact this week is that a
31:38
mumbai businessman is trying to sue his
31:40
parents for giving birth to him
31:42
and his mother has responded by saying
31:44
if she'd met him before he was born
31:47
she definitely wouldn't have done it
31:50
so this is this guy from mumbai and he
31:53
said his parents gave birth to him
31:54
without his consent
31:56
and you shouldn't be allowed to do that
31:57
it's wrong to bring children into the
31:59
world without their consent their
32:00
destined to a life of constant suffering
32:02
uh that they didn't choose and so he's
32:05
suing his parents
32:06
and the thing that's gonna make it a bit
32:08
harder for him is that both his parents
32:09
are lawyers
32:11
i read one other thing his mother said
32:13
which is if he could come up with a
32:15
rational explanation as to how he could
32:16
have sought his consent to be born i
32:18
will accept my fault
32:19
yeah that's fair enough so this is
32:22
anti-natalism
32:23
which i had never heard of up until this
32:26
well it's quite
32:26
a new concept yeah it's an amazing
32:29
concept though isn't it it's just the
32:30
idea
32:31
that why are we alive at all we should
32:33
just stop having babies but we shouldn't
32:35
be upset about that we should be
32:36
thinking of we're doing the universe a
32:38
favor
32:39
why sorry they just think we're born
32:41
into suffering that we're born into
32:43
you pre pre if you know that you've got
32:45
certain diseases in your family that you
32:47
know might genetically go down
32:48
that's a bit different it's just
32:50
everything yeah i mean there's a lot of
32:52
reasons as well one reason is
32:53
overpopulation which is always a thing
32:55
that people
32:56
that's fair yeah but the other thing is
32:58
like by bringing in birth it means that
33:00
you're bringing in death
33:01
so it guarantees that whoever is alive
33:03
there is going to be some kind of
33:04
suffering for them
33:06
yeah i guess so and it's not it's the
33:08
idea basically that
33:09
by having someone give birth you add
33:11
something negative he says it's wrong to
33:12
bring children into the world because
33:14
even even he admits my life is
33:15
proportionately very good uh it's
33:17
absolutely fine i'm perfectly happy
33:19
but i'd rather not be here it's like
33:20
there's a nice room but i don't really
33:22
want to be in that room
33:23
we'll piss off it no no
33:26
you can't say that guy involves dying
33:29
and then he says well it's really unfair
33:31
to have locked me with the decision of
33:32
whether or not i kill myself
33:34
and this actually comes from this guy
33:36
who had a similarly low bar
33:38
for what equals suffering so it's this
33:40
guy called
33:41
david benatar who wrote a book called
33:43
better to have never been
33:44
and that was i think about it
33:53
[Laughter]
33:56
so he's a really fun guy and he
33:59
says that we're almost always hungry or
34:02
thirsty
34:03
when we're not we always have to go to
34:05
the bathroom we're always experiencing i
34:06
think this guy's got digestive problems
34:08
[Laughter]
34:11
i'm capable of going an hour time
34:12
without eating or drinking or going to
34:14
the bathroom and i don't think i'm
34:15
special i should say
34:17
would you not say you're always a bit
34:18
hungry or thirsty or if not he says are
34:20
you none of those things now
34:22
i'm a bit thirsty
34:25
oh no i should never have been born
34:30
or if that he says and this is something
34:32
that you can't deny andy he says we're
34:34
always experiencing thermal discomfort
34:36
we're always a bit too hot or a bit too
34:38
cold
34:38
you literally just tell me to turn the
34:40
heating down that's true
34:41
okay i'm in too tired i'm i'm
34:45
i'm not tired but that's only because
34:46
we're recording it about 10 to 1 in the
34:48
afternoon
34:51
you said it's quite new but you know
34:52
this idea has been around for quite a
34:54
long time not the name
34:55
anti-natalism but other stuff so uh the
34:59
encroatites which were an old um sex
35:02
they said
35:02
that um in order to conquer death people
35:04
should desist from procreation
35:07
uh the manichaeans the bogga mills the
35:09
cathars they all thought that kind of
35:11
thing
35:11
um but obviously not any of them really
35:13
around now and that's kind of the
35:15
problem with this
35:16
if it's your doctrine then you don't
35:18
really send it down to your children
35:20
all or nothing isn't it unless you can
35:21
persuade everyone your idea is not going
35:23
to be the one that survives so there's a
35:25
group called the voluntary human
35:26
extinction movement
35:28
which set up in 1991 and that until 1992
35:32
and there was a guy called les knight
35:33
who founded it and it just asks people
35:36
not to have children basically
35:37
and he said i consider it a success
35:39
every time one more of us decides not to
35:41
add one more of us
35:43
it needs to be the enforced human
35:44
extinction movement isn't it it's not
35:46
going to work this voluntary
35:48
yeah actually it's um that guy from
35:50
avengers isn't it it's the same idea
35:52
what's he called
35:52
from the latest avengers yeah thanos
35:54
spoiler alert if you haven't seen it but
35:56
you really should have done
35:57
but at the end of it he kind of kills
35:59
half of
36:00
all beings in the universe wow they just
36:03
disappear
36:04
and the idea is there's overpopulation
36:05
and he thinks that
36:07
you know that's the best way of doing it
36:08
and it's completely random in the
36:10
avengers so
36:11
all at once you just start to disappear
36:12
half of the people wow
36:14
i think warn people there's no reason
36:16
not to warn people well they knew
36:17
because the avengers were fighting
36:19
against it so they kind of knew that
36:20
this guy was going to do something but
36:22
you should have time to set your affairs
36:24
in order and feed the cat in the event
36:26
that the cat survives is the cat's name
36:28
it's all beings well if you've got two
36:30
cats you should put out one lot of food
36:31
basically
36:33
you don't know because your two might
36:34
both survive or they might both die
36:36
and the other thing is if you're the one
36:38
who disappears
36:39
yeah but your cat doesn't then the cat's
36:41
going to starve to death so actually
36:43
it's going to be more than half of the
36:45
universe because some people are reliant
36:48
on others
36:48
looks cats aren't reliant on
36:53
the us will die sure i do find it an
36:55
amazing
36:56
concept like i'm i'm definitely avengers
36:58
yeah yeah like
36:59
so let's write down the name of that
37:01
title what was it but no the the idea
37:03
of you know should we go on i i'm on the
37:06
side that we should i've
37:08
just had a baby awkward yeah i've got
37:11
proof that i think of that but
37:12
i do you do kind of go well why are we
37:14
going what are we going on for
37:16
i can see that their side of it is sort
37:17
of going what if we've actually woken up
37:19
to the idea that there's all this
37:20
suffering going on
37:21
and our job is to be clever enough to
37:23
end it completely
37:24
yeah the life is a mistake it's we
37:27
haven't seen it anywhere else yeah this
37:28
is just such a big
37:29
concept i think the planet has got
37:31
resources to give a town of say
37:32
twenty thousand people a really good
37:34
time you know but i guess if you just
37:36
keep those 20 000 people alive we'll
37:37
just have a vote we'll or we'll have a
37:39
random ballot and we'll just say you 20
37:40
000 you get to survive and you're gonna
37:42
have a great time you would love it if
37:43
there weren't that many you would have
37:44
loved it in the stone age in the stone
37:46
age they've recently done a study at the
37:48
start the stone age that
37:49
in the whole of europe there are about 1
37:52
500 people
37:53
lovely which is about the same number
37:54
has come to one of our shows
37:56
but that's over the whole of europe yeah
37:59
that's crazy travel and parking would be
38:00
a nightmare for that show wouldn't it if
38:02
there were only
38:03
if everyone from europe was coming to it
38:05
yes but parking in the rest of europe
38:06
would be quite good oh yeah
38:08
that would be great if you were the one
38:10
person that didn't want to go to the
38:11
show
38:11
wouldn't it pros are empty
38:16
um it is interesting and you you having
38:18
a child doesn't actually prove that you
38:20
don't believe in this it just means
38:21
you're a hypocrite it just means
38:22
at contraception
38:25
i think exactly guys i messed up big
38:28
time
38:30
yeah i mean a lot of us do things that
38:31
we wouldn't say are morally what we
38:33
believe in
38:33
uh in fact the guy benatar who's sort of
38:35
come up with he's got 50 kids
38:40
he won't admit he won't tell journalists
38:42
the new york interviewed him and said do
38:43
you have children yourself and he said
38:44
i'd rather not answer that i don't see
38:46
how it's relevant to my argument really
38:48
yeah there's only evidence that he
38:50
hadn't quite believed it
38:51
at you know nine months before the time
38:53
of the birth of his child oh so he might
38:55
have changed his mind he might have
38:56
changed his mind
38:57
that's a really good point after he met
38:58
the kid
39:00
that was the one thing that changed his
39:01
mind this mumbai businessman thinks he
39:04
should never have been born it's worse
39:05
if your parents become anti-natalists
39:06
after you're born
39:09
i should just say a lot of these facts
39:11
we've been mentioning came from this
39:12
brilliant article in the new yorker it's
39:14
called the history of blood
39:15
and would definitely recommend reading
39:17
it just on weird lawsuits
39:19
yeah i didn't know about this lawsuit in
39:22
the 19th century so in 1893 where the
39:25
supreme court
39:26
got involved in whether tomato is a
39:27
fruit or a vegetable
39:30
they've done this so the ruling is
39:33
actually in
39:34
and it was a lawsuit that was brought by
39:35
the knicks family so they were big
39:37
sellers of tomatoes and it was against
39:39
this guy called edward hedden
39:41
and it was to recover some fees they'd
39:43
spent some tax they'd paid on exporting
39:45
some tomatoes
39:46
because there was a rule that tax had to
39:47
be paid on imported
39:49
vegetables but not on fruit and then
39:52
they were like well tomato is
39:54
technically a fruit so we shouldn't have
39:55
to pay tax on that
39:56
went to court and they everyone got
39:58
their dictionaries out in court and
39:59
brought different definitions of fruits
40:01
and vegetables
40:01
and it was ruled that tomato is a
40:04
vegetable
40:04
according to the supreme court you had
40:07
to pay tax on it because everyone sort
40:08
of thinks of it as a vegetable
40:10
i don't think it is though well it's not
40:12
botanically but they said that's not
40:14
relevant for taxpayers
40:15
i remember reading that i think by law
40:18
in the eu
40:18
a carrot is a fruit it is a carrot is it
40:22
a carrot a cucumber sweet potato because
40:25
in
40:25
portugal they make jam out of it yeah
40:28
and so jam has different fruit if you're
40:29
a fruit jam then you've got certain
40:31
tax rules that apply to you and so it's
40:33
got to make sure and there's a directive
40:35
that says for these purposes
40:36
carrots cucumbers sweet potatoes are all
40:38
fruits wow wow
40:40
and that's why we're leaving so you
40:41
could make a really
40:41
[Music]
40:42
[Laughter]
40:45
there was a guy in 2006 called alan
40:47
hecard
40:48
who tried to sue michael jordan for 416
40:52
million dollars on the grounds that he
40:53
looked like him
40:54
and this guy uh said that it was ruining
40:58
his life
40:58
he couldn't go to church he couldn't go
41:00
to the shops he couldn't eat out without
41:02
being mistaken for michael jordan people
41:04
coming up with him
41:05
and he actually so he paid the fee this
41:07
is the weird thing you pay a fee to file
41:09
this lawsuit
41:10
um it's like 200 and he also sued nike
41:13
nike for the same amount because it was
41:15
their responsibility as well for making
41:16
jordan famous
41:18
and weirdly though i've looked at the
41:19
pictures and basically the similarities
41:21
are that
41:21
um he's bald like michael jordan he
41:24
wears an earring in exactly the same ear
41:25
which i suppose he could have removed
41:27
exactly the same here
41:30
and uh he wears air jordan shoes
41:34
[Laughter]
41:36
always a basketball jersey with the name
41:38
jordan
41:41
wow and did he he lost right no he won
41:46
yeah
41:48
yeah he did not win
41:54
okay that's it that is all of our facts
41:56

goodbye

=259
00:04
[Music]
00:10
[Applause]
00:14
oh
00:16
and welcome to another episode of no
00:19
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:22
this week coming to you live from
00:29
jan glasgow and i am sitting here with
00:31
anna chazinski
00:32
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
00:34
and once again
00:35
we have gathered around the microphones
00:37
with our four favorite facts from the
00:39
last seven days
00:40
and in no particular order here we go
00:43
starting with you james okay my fact
00:46
this week is that there is only one
00:48
person in the world
00:49
who can predict the future using
00:51
asparagus
00:54
for 2019 she has predicted extreme
00:56
temperatures
00:58
a recession in the us and an all-time
01:00
high in asparagus sales
01:02
[Laughter]
01:06
so when you say she can
01:10
predict the future uh what's your
01:12
success rate well
01:13
it was really hot last week so 100
01:17
and so far um yeah actually she claims
01:21
to have a very high percentage but these
01:23
people always do don't they
01:24
okay let's see some of the other things
01:26
that she says she says um this year
01:28
fears
01:28
of brexit will be unfounded yeah maybe
01:33
the trade war between china and the u.s
01:35
will end but there'll be a recession
01:37
england's women's football team will win
01:38
the world cup fingers crossed
01:43
pick your audience you know you know
01:46
when you forget which country you're in
01:49
james look genuinely shocked with your
01:51
son what happened
01:54
[Laughter]
02:03
the hierarchy is nationalism then
02:06
feminism
02:08
god anyway yes so there's this lady and
02:09
she does that stuff and it's obviously
02:11
[ __ ] she
02:14
well hang on um she uh
02:17
she has a twitter account i went on it
02:19
today and one of the other predictions
02:20
that she had
02:21
is that she said that the oscars this
02:23
year a star is born
02:24
would have success but british actors
02:27
will also be
02:28
in the mix uh so she was correct about
02:31
olivia coleman
02:32
and astar was born i think won the best
02:34
song
02:35
and she wrote a tweet just going got it
02:37
right
02:38
she's she's very proud she said another
02:40
great hit
02:41
success rate for the old what did she
02:44
call herself
02:45
she calls herself mystic veg yes
02:48
she's pretty strong yeah she's an
02:50
asparamancer
02:52
it's called yes you can just put mansa
02:55
on the end of any word and it means you
02:57
tell the future by it can't you and it's
02:59
great and they've been doing this it was
03:01
in the medieval
03:01
period i think when they look back over
03:03
classical texts and they went god
03:05
those old ancient romans and greeks told
03:06
the future in weird-ass ways
03:08
let's just call them all monster some
03:10
things and so
03:11
there are so many nancy's there's
03:13
tyromancy uh which is one of my
03:14
favorites which is telling the future by
03:16
how cheese coagulates
03:18
and yeah i wrote one version of this
03:20
tyromancy which is
03:22
you get a cheese you wait for it to go
03:24
moldy and then you look at the mold and
03:26
that tells you the name of your husband
03:28
oh i thought it yeah i read something
03:30
similar to which is it's the names of
03:32
various suitors
03:33
that you write onto the cheese and the
03:35
bit that the mold grows over is who
03:37
you're gonna
03:37
oh but if it grows over all the names
03:39
you're in for a lot of
03:41
weddings how does it tell you the name
03:44
of your
03:45
did you say the name of your husband
03:46
yeah actually but unusually for this
03:48
podcast what dan said sounded a lot more
03:50
sensible
03:53
do you remember it's exactly like when
03:54
we used to peel apples did everyone used
03:56
to do this and you peeled an apple and
03:57
then you threw the peel in the air
03:58
and what is probably just what girls did
04:01
in the pre-feminist world um and the
04:04
shape that apple appeal landed in was
04:06
the first letter of your future
04:07
husband's name so
04:09
everyone thought their future husband's
04:10
name would start with s
04:13
um yeah is quite a cool thing there's a
04:15
there is a thing called alluromancy
04:18
uh which is not about being alluring
04:19
it's about baking messages
04:21
into little balls of dough and this
04:24
happened in ancient greece
04:25
and the balls would be mixed up they'd
04:26
have different messages on them and then
04:28
you would
04:28
pick one and that is basically a fortune
04:31
cookie yeah oh yeah the ancient greeks
04:33
have fortune cookies
04:34
is what i'm trying to say it's really
04:35
cool yeah there's also gyromancy
04:38
which is the idea of you just start
04:41
walking in a circle and keep walking
04:43
and around the perimeter of where you're
04:45
walking they leave letters of the
04:46
alphabet
04:47
so you start spelling something out and
04:49
the idea is you keep going until you
04:50
start stumbling
04:51
into these letters and then you keep
04:53
going until it starts spelling something
04:56
out and then you keep going until
04:58
finally you spell out a consistent
05:00
sentence
05:00
and if you don't do that you just keep
05:02
going until either you die or go mad
05:04
and that's that's what they used to do
05:06
back in the day
05:07
back in the day
05:09
[Music]
05:16
i like this um i like this kind of
05:17
telling the future from iran it's called
05:19
falgush
05:20
and it's the act of standing in a dark
05:22
corner and listening to the
05:24
conversations of passers-by
05:26
oh i didn't know there was a word for
05:28
what i did
05:31
that's great in 2008 there was some
05:34
research
05:35
that found that you can make someone
05:36
like certain foods if you convince them
05:39
that they loved it the first time they
05:40
tried it so you say to them
05:42
when you were a kid you had this and you
05:44
absolutely loved it and you can make it
05:45
so that they used to hate something and
05:47
now they really like it
05:48
and that work was funded by the
05:50
asparagus industry
05:54
there is this i didn't know this about
05:56
asparagus asparagus can grow a
05:58
centimeter
05:59
an hour wow what it can
06:02
you could watch that you if i had the
06:05
day off work
06:06
and i grew asparagus i'd probably try
06:07
and see it move right
06:10
is that how it is that how they do it do
06:12
they just go
06:13
in the space of 24 hours do we get them
06:15
really quick yeah
06:16
yeah it grows fast it literally you just
06:19
pour water on it and it goes
06:20
in 24 hours it doesn't make that nice
06:23
if you spit it up it probably does make
06:25
that noise that's incredible
06:27
i know what grows that fast it's
06:29
asparagus
06:30
[Laughter]
06:39
yeah good news for this woman hating
06:41
audience
06:46
sales of asparagus have rocketed in
06:48
glasgow
06:50
i don't know if that's a win i think
06:52
that's a win for women isn't it i don't
06:53
think you want to be
06:54
so basically the the male stocks are a
06:56
lot bigger and juicier than the female
06:58
stocks but that's because
07:02
now you're writing your own jokes now
07:03
guys
07:06
well the reason is
07:07
[Laughter]
07:11
the reason is because the females they
07:14
create the berries and so they need to
07:15
use all their energy to do
07:16
something actually useful whereas all
07:18
the men have to do is just grow and be
07:20
juicy
07:21
[Music]
07:23
nice and we're gonna have to move on
07:24
shortly to our to our next fact
07:26
um i've just got um one or two things
07:29
hey um if anyone by the way is thinking
07:30
of going to the asparagus festival
07:32
um there is exciting stuff that goes on
07:34
and there's stuff that goes on
07:35
afterwards they had a 10 year
07:37
anniversary not too long ago
07:39
and you can do tours on buses it's the
07:41
asparagus bus tours
07:42
and yeah those are really fun but
07:44
actually you've got to make sure to pick
07:45
the right year because a few years ago
07:47
they had to cancel the festival due to
07:49
lack of asparagus um there wasn't enough
07:51
there was a
07:52
there was a flooding and it kind of
07:53
ruined the crops that were growing
07:56
yeah but um it turns out that asparagus
08:00
played a very important role in the
08:02
formation
08:03
of darwin coming up with the theory of
08:05
evolution
08:07
yeah it was part of the evolution of the
08:08
theory of evolution what it was is
08:11
darwin kept wondering why things
08:13
can be seen you know certain type of
08:15
lettuces can be seen in places
08:18
halfway across the world how do they get
08:19
there how do they travel what goes on
08:21
so he had a butler called mr parslow and
08:23
mr parslow in him filled a tub
08:25
full of salt water to replicate the
08:27
conditions of the ocean
08:29
and they put a bunch of seeds in to see
08:30
if the seeds would would float and how
08:32
long they would float for
08:33
so they had cabbage siege radish seeds
08:36
and so on they lasted for 42 days which
08:38
was really impressive
08:39
however asparagus seeds lasted for 85
08:42
days they would float for that long
08:44
but the important bit was they then took
08:46
the seed out of the sea water tub
08:48
and buried it and it grew into asparagus
08:50
like lit
08:51
straight away and so that meant that it
08:54
could travel that they could still
08:55
germinate once they were in the soil
08:57
so then they put the seeds inside a bird
09:00
and then they killed the bird
09:02
and they threw it in the bathtub
09:06
the worst bedtime story anyone's ever
09:08
heard
09:09
dan's child hasn't slept for three weeks
09:11
he's just doing this story
09:13
twinkle twinkle little star or shoot the
09:15
bird with the asparagus seed in its
09:16
tummy
09:17
um so then what they worked out was the
09:20
bird
09:20
still you could take the seed out of the
09:22
bird all those days later and it would
09:24
still grow so the asparagus seed helped
09:26
darwin to realize it could travel via
09:28
bird or via ocean
09:29
do you know can i just make sure that
09:31
you know that has nothing to do with
09:32
evolution
09:34
what you just said that is not about
09:38
you do you think evolution is the proof
09:40
that stuff can travel long distances
09:45
that sounds like just an idle side
09:47
project the whole drowning a bird in the
09:49
bath scene for darwin
09:51
you let me tell that whole story
09:55
he still did it just another famous
09:57
person who looked into asparagus was
09:59
benjamin franklin
10:00
and he formed a theory based on the fact
10:02
that it makes your wee
10:04
smell although does everyone have the i
10:06
because i don't think that asparagus
10:07
makes your wee smell
10:10
you are wrong because it does although
10:11
some people can detect it and some
10:13
people can't
10:14
well it's not my fault not many people
10:16
can't detect it
10:17
i think if you can't detect it i'm
10:19
special you have a thing
10:20
yeah you've got a thing called specific
10:23
a nosmia
10:24
so that's why you can't smell a
10:26
particular smell the asparagus we smell
10:28
yeah but the asparagus does other people
10:31
claim it makes your we smell
10:32
and ben franklin wrote a letter to the
10:34
royal academy of brussels
10:35
using us asparagus as an example of how
10:38
what we eat can
10:39
impact the smell of what we excrete so
10:42
he was saying
10:43
asparagus makes your way smell kind of
10:45
gross well
10:46
uh how about we work on this because
10:49
farts
10:49
smell gross and if we know that stuff we
10:52
eat can make
10:53
what comes out can change the smell of
10:54
stuff that comes out of us why don't we
10:56
work out what we need to eat
10:57
in order for farts to smell nice and it
10:59
was actually he thought it was a really
11:01
big idea because he was saying
11:02
it causes disease because well-bred
11:04
people hold their farts in solely
11:06
because
11:07
they're gonna stink the place out if
11:08
they let one rip and so he said if we
11:11
could get a pill or something we could
11:12
feed people to make your fart smell like
11:14
perfume
11:15
then people would actually want to do it
11:17
and that's evolution
11:31
okay it is time for fact number two and
11:34
that
11:34
is chozinski my fact this week is that
11:37
the composer
11:38
haydn's wife cared so little about her
11:41
husband's work
11:42
that she used to tear up his scores to
11:44
use his hair curlers and pastry
11:46
underlays
11:48
that's crazy was this sort of before
11:51
uh he sold them to anyone or before or
11:54
was it just things
11:55
just it was just throughout his life so
11:56
actually he was very he wrote a lot
11:58
and she just found them lying around and
11:59
she knew nothing about music and did not
12:02
care haydn once said
12:03
it makes not a blind bit of difference
12:04
to my wife whether i'm a musician or a
12:06
cobbler
12:07
uh and so she'd find them and she'd be
12:08
like oh that looks handy i'll put a pie
12:10
on that
12:10
yeah well i mean he did he wrote 108
12:13
symphonies 20 operas 47 sonatas 68
12:16
quartets
12:17
178 trios 14 masses and six oratorios so
12:20
i mean that's a lot of paper yeah isn't
12:23
it it's recycling
12:24
it's recycling yeah she didn't like him
12:27
very much either oh that was true
12:28
i think she was doing it deliberately
12:30
they had a very sad marriage
12:32
um so he basically he fell in love when
12:34
he was very young
12:36
joseph heiden with a woman called teresa
12:38
and she couldn't marry him and so
12:40
her father said you want to marry her
12:41
older sister who's this really
12:43
unpleasant woman called
12:44
maria anna and he felt bad so he was
12:47
like okay cool
12:48
i'll marry her and said that sounds
12:49
great and apparently she had a very
12:51
domineering and unfriendly character
12:53
uh she used to spend all of his money
12:55
very freely so he went to great lengths
12:56
to hide his income so she wouldn't know
12:58
about it
12:59
um and when she died he was completely
13:01
indifferent apparently wow
13:03
they lived apart didn't they for towards
13:05
the end they did yeah
13:06
for 40 years well the last 40 years
13:13
he was housed uh he had a job where he
13:16
was housed at
13:17
this princess castle where she did live
13:19
with him quite a lot of the time
13:20
but then yeah towards the end he was in
13:22
london and she sent him
13:24
a letter saying she used to send him
13:26
letters saying things like by the way if
13:27
you die tomorrow there's no money to
13:29
bury you
13:30
uh really nice love letters like that
13:32
when he was away and she wrote him a
13:33
letter in london
13:34
saying i really need money because
13:36
you're gonna die soon and i need a house
13:38
to live in as a widow
13:39
so can you please buy me one and he did
13:41
i read with the letters
13:42
um that it got to the point where they
13:45
were communicating just by sending each
13:46
other's letters but haydn never
13:48
opened the letters that she sent and he
13:51
was convinced that she didn't either
13:53
so they were just sending each other
13:54
these things that remained completely
13:56
unopened no idea what was being said
13:58
yeah no communication wow yeah pretty
14:00
crazy hayden was
14:01
very influential he's not very well
14:03
known these days i think unless you're a
14:05
classical music fan
14:06
he's less well known than like beethoven
14:08
and mozart yeah exactly yeah but
14:10
he was great friends with mozart um
14:13
yeah and i really like i've just been
14:16
reading a tiny bit about haydn's music
14:18
so he wrote his his string quartet in e
14:21
flat is known as
14:22
the joke because he put basically he
14:25
practical jokes
14:26
in this string quartet because it's got
14:28
lots of false endings to catch
14:30
the audience out that's quite cool isn't
14:31
it yeah and he wrote something called
14:33
the surprise
14:34
symphony which is we used to just turn
14:37
up at people's houses and play that
14:40
it's really really quiet apart from one
14:41
very loud bit and that's the surprise
14:44
and then it
14:45
it never gets referred to again it
14:46
doesn't get repeated as a motif it's
14:48
just really really quiet all the way
14:49
through your path
14:50
[Laughter]
14:51
i like there's also one he wrote which
14:53
is called the palindrome which starts
14:55
one way and then it just goes back on
14:56
itself as a as a musical piece yeah
14:59
but the first one the joke is amazing
15:01
because it was he would literally the
15:03
piece would finish and the audience
15:04
would go
15:04
and then he would play again and then
15:06
the whole thing just has the audience
15:08
going
15:09
to report he was like les dawson of his
15:12
day wasn't he
15:14
he was actually he was a prankster i
15:16
can't remember
15:17
any of les dawson's i've got to say that
15:19
is not exactly a 2019 reference
15:25
he got kicked out of his choir when he
15:27
was very young because he chopped off
15:29
one of the choir boys pigtails
15:31
wow just as a prank this is a fun prank
15:33
he was very good-natured apparently so
15:35
he was known as papa haydn
15:36
and yeah as you say he was best friends
15:38
with mozart there's a really
15:40
moving moment when he was called to move
15:42
to london when he was about 60 by that
15:45
point and he suddenly got this
15:46
invitation
15:46
and mozart walked into the coaching
15:48
station to say goodbye and they had a
15:50
moment where
15:51
mozart said i suppose this is the last
15:53
time we'll see each other in this life
15:55
uh because heiden's you know in those
15:57
days that was getting on a bit
15:58
and haydn said oh don't you worry about
16:00
me i'm feeling pretty strong
16:02
uh but then actually mozart obviously
16:04
died at the age of 35
16:05
then that year so he wasn't got into the
16:08
coach and drove off and then he came
16:10
back a minute later it was a surprise
16:13
it wasn't the last time we'll see each
16:14
other i'm here have you
16:16
did you guys read about his boss haydn's
16:18
boss no that's okay he spent
16:21
30 years working for a royal house
16:23
because that was how you made your
16:24
living as a musician you you didn't have
16:27
uh you know you didn't have really big
16:28
mass concerts you had a private patron
16:31
so his boss was prince paul anton
16:32
esterhazy or esther hazy
16:34
esta hauser esterhauser sorry and
16:38
he had total control basically of
16:40
haydn's life so he could dictate how he
16:41
dressed
16:42
uh haydn wasn't automatically allowed to
16:45
send anybody new works
16:46
he had to they submit them all to his
16:49
highness
16:50
and um he was partly paid in semolina
16:52
beef cabbages and lard
16:55
during his work he wasn't allowed to eat
16:56
and drink with the other musicians in
16:58
case they stopped respecting him because
17:00
he was the kind
17:00
he was the boss and every morning and
17:02
afternoon he had to go to the prince and
17:04
say would you like to hear
17:05
a concert or an opera tonight and if the
17:07
prince said yes he had to go and prepare
17:09
one
17:09
wow yeah he did insist on being paid
17:12
partly in wine
17:13
as well which is along with other nasty
17:16
stuff
17:17
but he did he lived in this place and uh
17:19
prince esterhaza had
17:21
this weird castle that he built like a
17:22
fantasy castle which sounds awful in
17:24
this big swamp where they had to spend
17:26
about 10 months of the year
17:27
and you built this huge opera house
17:29
where hyden had to compose these operas
17:30
that burned down and he immediately
17:32
built a new one
17:33
um and haydn was still very popular
17:35
there and he had this team of musicians
17:37
around him and they all did indeed
17:39
respect him
17:40
a lot to the extent that the musicians
17:42
used to go to the tavern which also the
17:44
prince built on the land
17:46
and they used to get really pissed and
17:47
they weren't allowed their wives there
17:48
so everyone was getting a bit antsy
17:50
uh at month number nine and there was a
17:53
moment where the
17:54
cellist punched an oboist in the face
17:57
when they got a bit pissed and yeah
18:01
[Laughter]
18:10
that trombone moment um he punched him
18:12
in the face and he lost a knife because
18:13
he was wearing this ring that knocked me
18:15
oh i feel bad
18:16
[Music]
18:16
[Laughter]
18:19
um he was missing a night and he was a
18:21
bit pissed off but haydn stepped in and
18:23
managed to make them settle it amicably
18:24
so this guy has
18:26
removed the eye of his co-worker and
18:28
they worked together happily for another
18:29
seven years
18:30
that's great and then he took the other
18:33
right and that was too far
18:34
because that was not funny we should say
18:36
should we say what happened to hayden
18:38
after he died
18:39
i think we should yeah it was very
18:41
bizarre so he died finally
18:43
quite old um and then as soon as he died
18:45
his head was stolen
18:47
and it was stolen by a guy he knew
18:48
actually whose marriage he'd helped to
18:50
set up so it was kind of a slap in the
18:51
face this guy called rosenbaum
18:53
who was very interested in phrenology
18:55
which was the study of skulls and
18:56
what that meant about your intelligence
18:58
and so he stole his head with his mate
19:01
um and it used to be displayed in his
19:03
mate's house in this little box which
19:05
had a little glass window and it sat on
19:07
a cushion
19:08
and imagine going to your friend's house
19:10
and they said oh do you should see
19:11
something really cool
19:12
and then you just got the dead head of
19:15
your former mate
19:16
sitting in a display case yeah they
19:18
didn't know about it until his patron
19:21
who was a new prince by this time called
19:23
nicholas he decided you know
19:24
the burial we gave hayden it wasn't good
19:26
enough he needs a more dignified burial
19:28
place
19:28
so they wanted to re-inter him somewhere
19:30
grander they dug him up and they found
19:32
his head was missing and it was
19:33
incredibly upsetting
19:34
so the authorities were you know
19:36
prompted by the prince they searched the
19:37
home of rosenbaum
19:39
and um he gave them a different skull i
19:41
don't know where he got that one from
19:43
he collected skulls and then and then
19:45
they they they got wise to it because
19:47
they looked at the skull they'd be given
19:48
he said this is a young man's skull it's
19:49
not hiding was very old but he died and
19:50
he said all right you got me uh here's
19:52
hide and seek
19:54
[Laughter]
19:56
so there are now three skulls in
19:58
circulation one of which is hidden do
20:00
you know how they hit haydn's skull
20:02
no it's very cool so they had hidden
20:03
skull in the house and they hid it
20:05
inside the mattress
20:06
and then he rose inbound made his wife
20:08
lie on the mattress and pretend to be
20:10
menstruating
20:11
and everyone searching the house was too
20:13
afraid to go near her and so they didn't
20:15
write this
20:18
quick pretend to be menstruating
20:21
i know that's not what happened so i was
20:26
you're confusing menstruating with being
20:27
on a ghost train
20:34
i like the way that these guys looking
20:35
for haydn are basically playing hide and
20:37
seek
20:40
wow
20:42
[Applause]
20:43
[Laughter]
20:45
[Applause]
20:46
okay we need to move on did we get
20:48
together so we did okay
20:49
let's move on it's time for fact number
20:51
three and that is my fact
20:53
my fact this week is that to stop people
20:56
stealing
20:56
american road signs with the number 69
21:00
on them washington state has replaced
21:03
many of them
21:03
with signs that now read 68.9
21:08
that was their big plan so this is a big
21:11
problem in america this is a thing
21:13
called mile markers so when you're
21:14
driving it tells you either how many
21:16
miles you have to get to somewhere or
21:18
how many are left and
21:19
and these keep getting stolen and it's
21:21
not just 69 that gets stolen
21:23
um there is also the 420 and yeah
21:27
420 is the police have been notified of
21:30
everyone who just here
21:33
yeah so 420 is a is a drug reference um
21:36
for the 20th of april it's it's
21:38
international
21:39
cannabis day i believe it is or smoker's
21:41
day yeah
21:42
okay um so those have been replaced as
21:45
well so those are now
21:46
for 419.9 right um
21:49
and this is this is a big problem in
21:51
america because they have
21:52
uh they've had 200 stolen over the last
21:55
since about
21:56
2012. they do cost a lot there's a whole
21:59
wikipedia page on street sign theft
22:03
um so for instance there's a big list of
22:04
them um richard bong
22:06
states recreation area keep having their
22:08
um signs stolen
22:10
because it has the word bong in there
22:12
ragged ass road
22:14
in yellowknife uh they had to keep
22:17
changing their signs
22:18
uh but whole road in england and they
22:22
had to keep losing that they eventually
22:23
renamed it to archer's way
22:25
so this is happening all over the world
22:27
in hilariously named places
22:29
um do you guys know about a place called
22:31
bergotz
22:32
in the us no no uh no you wouldn't
22:35
because it's made up
22:36
but this is a place this is a
22:39
pair of men called mika and mont who
22:41
have been trying to redesign
22:42
america's road signs and they finally
22:44
confirmed that they'd redesigned them
22:45
recently
22:46
and they've invented a fictional town
22:48
called burgults
22:51
b-r-g-a-u-l-t-s because it involves some
22:53
of the hardest letters to sign
22:55
and that's all those vowels apparently
22:58
they look really blurry they fill in a
22:59
bit when you're far away
23:00
the g always difficult why does a g look
23:03
completely different types than it does
23:05
written
23:06
and so they have that as their
23:08
archetypal
23:09
amazing observational comedy it's like
23:12
peter k was in the room
23:14
wait till you find out about a it's only
23:16
g i'm stuck on g
23:17
okay um so yeah and they they would do
23:20
it by they'd make signs saying burgles
23:22
and then they'd lean them against fences
23:24
and then they'd like walk up a hill or
23:25
walk 500 meters away and then they'd see
23:27
how clearly they could see them
23:28
compared to our normal signposts and in
23:31
this manner they've convinced american
23:32
how to change all of its road sign fonts
23:34
and they did that in 2004.
23:36
but there's there's a lot of controversy
23:38
about this yeah so that
23:39
the original american font on all
23:41
american roads was called highway gothic
23:43
that was the name which was pretty cool
23:44
wow and then their font is called
23:46
clearview yeah
23:48
and there were all these studies saying
23:49
it was much clearer to read clear view
23:51
and um you could see it if you were
23:53
driving at night and you saw a sign that
23:55
was in clearview
23:56
you could read it 74 feet further away
23:59
than highway gothic
24:00
wow so that gives you a couple more
24:02
seconds let's say of reaction time
24:04
so it will stop you having a crash
24:06
perhaps and that
24:07
could actually save lives you know more
24:10
or fewer people could die on the roads
24:12
depending on whether you choose
24:13
clearview or highway gothic but there
24:14
have now been more studies saying
24:16
highway gothic is better so clearview
24:18
has just had its approval removed
24:20
i think this year this year has had its
24:22
approval put on hold
24:23
the highway gothic factions have come
24:25
out right they've
24:26
beaten it down but it's all in caps lock
24:29
highway gothic so we're in america they
24:30
have all their signs and capitals
24:32
which is terrible for signage because
24:34
capitals
24:35
you can't distinguish shapes it just
24:37
looks like one big rectangle
24:38
so when you're far away uh you can't
24:40
tell as much whereas on our signs here
24:43
then you know you see the little tails
24:44
of the g or the y
24:46
or the other tailed letters you all know
24:48
what they are
24:49
[Laughter]
24:52
g y p p p is another good one
24:55
and q of course what was that
25:03
no no i think we're on the brink of
25:04
something no sorry
25:06
oh i found an effect um mice make
25:09
signposts in the in their fields and
25:12
they make them out of leaves and twigs
25:14
so they don't get lost
25:18
do they what font are they using is it
25:20
caps
25:22
this this is wood wood mice um they they
25:24
move
25:25
objects like a leaf for a twig to mark a
25:27
site that interests them
25:28
and they regularly when they're
25:29
exploring around it they rear up on
25:31
their hind legs and they look to make
25:32
sure they can still see their
25:34
little street sign before they explore
25:36
oh
25:37
wow one place which has problems with
25:40
losing signs
25:41
is um fin glass in north dublin and that
25:44
is because that is where bono was born
25:47
and so a lot of you two fans go and
25:49
steal the road sign from his road
25:51
so literally the streets have no name
25:59
is that it doesn't sound it sounds like
26:02
i made it all up just for the punchline
26:03
tonight but no it really is true
26:05
it really is true they were first
26:07
designed for cyclists road signs
26:08
in the 19th century to warning road
26:11
signs but i want to test you guys
26:12
because there was a study done recently
26:14
that showed that
26:15
most people can't identify most road
26:17
signs now
26:18
and even actually this is going to be
26:20
hard because you've probably read it but
26:21
there are three basic shapes
26:22
so the circle where it's like a red
26:24
circle with a white band
26:26
in the middle of it yeah that means
26:27
shortcut
26:29
[Laughter]
26:29
[Music]
26:32
um there are three types of road signs
26:34
there's a circle the triangle and the
26:35
rectangle
26:36
oh yeah does anyone know the difference
26:38
between what those things mean
26:39
is it the circle was it circle triangle
26:42
and triangle is warning
26:44
yeah and circle is do this now whatever
26:47
whatever it says you must bloody well do
26:49
it and then the square is
26:51
there's a nice castle over there oh yeah
26:54
okay that's sort of
26:55
one is very wrong so i hope you're
26:56
joking the circle is absolutely don't do
26:58
it
26:58
uh please don't but there are people
27:00
don't understand so anything in a red
27:02
circle means this is banned but i think
27:03
it doesn't have a cross through it no
27:04
one realizes so there was this survey
27:06
done that said
27:07
what does this i mean that has a red
27:08
circle and it shows it's known as the
27:11
low-flying motorbike sign i think
27:12
because it shows a car and then on top
27:14
of it a little motorbike so that means
27:16
no vehicles
27:17
it means no vehicles most people who did
27:19
this survey said well it means only cars
27:21
and motorbikes are allowed
27:24
people have no idea that's the problem
27:26
in italy um
27:28
there's a town that has started they
27:29
have a big problem in this one town
27:31
where there's a lot of prostitutes on
27:32
the side of the road and they're trying
27:33
to
27:34
not encourage people to stop and and do
27:37
business with them so they created signs
27:39
again with a pictogram on it of what was
27:41
a prostitute and it says underneath it
27:43
um prostitutes
27:44
but most people didn't know if it was
27:46
sort of saying oh no
27:47
[Music]
27:50
oh they actually increased traffic
27:52
because most people were slowing down
28:01
okay it is time for our final fact of
28:03
the show and that
28:05
is andy my fact is that flies
28:09
like to date the same sort of flies as
28:11
their fly friends
28:17
i don't even know where to start with
28:19
that yeah do you mean flying friends
28:21
oh they're really cool friends no i just
28:22
really like friends who are flies
28:24
all right yeah so this is really cool
28:26
it's all about how flies choose
28:28
which other flies to court so scientists
28:31
they painted a load of male fruit flies
28:33
different colours okay they painted some
28:35
pink and some green and they set up a
28:37
date
28:38
between one female and then two males
28:40
one pink and one green
28:41
and then behind some glass they had
28:44
another female fly
28:45
watching this date this sounds like a
28:47
channel 5 show
28:51
and so the female inside chose one of
28:54
the males she chose pink or green to
28:56
mate with
28:57
and then the observer female flies
28:59
who've been watching this whole
29:00
rigmarole were given the chance a day
29:02
later which is quite a long time in fly
29:04
years
29:05
that's like you know three years later
29:07
they get the chance for a date of their
29:08
own
29:09
and when they were given the chance they
29:11
almost always picked the color that had
29:13
the female be
29:14
the day before had chosen so they
29:16
remembered this
29:18
and you know even when they were
29:20
presented with two male flies that were
29:22
apparently hideous
29:23
yeah i mean because they probably in
29:25
real life don't see many
29:27
flies painted pink and green do they
29:29
yeah yeah so
29:30
yeah it's very strange yeah and so what
29:33
is the
29:33
you know what does this tell us about
29:35
[Music]
29:38
flies
29:40
okay well i thought you did and that's
29:41
why i asked you
29:43
so the idea is that because the flies
29:45
are passing on behavioral traits between
29:47
each other
29:48
they might have some kind of culture
29:51
as in a culture is where someone does
29:53
something and then they
29:54
kind of talk everyone else into doing it
29:56
and then you become kind of everyone
29:57
goes to glastonbury
29:59
right they then got female observers
30:02
again behind the glass to watch a fly
30:04
orgy
30:04
between lots of males and lots of
30:06
females these flies really lucked out
30:08
didn't they they must have been bragging
30:10
to their friends
30:11
i've been involved in this study you
30:13
have no idea i never need to pay for
30:15
porn again
30:17
just an interesting thing about fly sex
30:19
because if they're having this big orgy
30:20
the problem is is um flies have sex
30:22
while they're flying so
30:24
they flies certain flies have a special
30:27
kind of
30:27
genitalia gonads that just have to just
30:30
move around to wherever
30:32
the female fly is flying yeah so if she
30:34
banks left and he's like well i gotta go
30:36
his gonads can go whoop and just i can
30:38
go from anywhere from 90 to 360 degrees
30:42
just around to just be making sure that
30:44
the sex continues while all this
30:47
very um you know flying stuff is going
30:50
on
30:50
that's very cool yeah because it's hard
30:52
to seduce the woman as a male
30:55
fruit fly this is that you're talking
30:57
about but um they
30:58
sing songs so the males chase the
31:00
females and then they will extend just
31:02
one wing
31:03
so like put one arm out and they vibrate
31:06
it and it produces a song
31:08
and the song has two modes so there's
31:10
just like two
31:11
types of sound they can make and you
31:13
have to amplify it by more than a
31:14
million times to hear it with human ears
31:16
but we've done that obviously because
31:17
scientists are bored
31:18
so they've got the the sign
31:21
and the pulse and the sign sounds like
31:24
the wine of an approaching mosquito
31:26
apparently and then the pole sounds like
31:27
a cat's purr
31:28
so if you're being seduced by a fly it's
31:31
a combination of a buzzing mosquito and
31:33
a purring cat
31:34
but then once the male once the female
31:36
has accepted the male the male licks the
31:38
female for two minutes and then they
31:39
mate for about 20 minutes
31:40
and some scientists who i think were
31:42
really bored uh they scrambled a fruit
31:44
flies courtship neurons in its brain
31:47
so that they tried to copulate lick and
31:50
play the love song
31:51
all at the same time and what would
31:54
normally take for
31:54
a four minute quite delicate mating
31:56
process was reduced to 10 seconds
32:00
we've all been there
32:06
who's your green friend
32:14
they have the only known aphrodisiac uh
32:17
fruit flies oh
32:18
like a proven one you mean a proven one
32:22
[Music]
32:23
[Applause]
32:25
and now they've got their pr guy which
32:27
is good he's going to need a job after
32:29
tonight
32:30
um they have the only aphrodisiac that
32:33
scientists have ever proved
32:34
exists is that actually makes you want
32:37
to have sex
32:37
only works on fruit flies and it's the
32:40
scent of rotting fruit
32:42
so if they smell rotting fruit that
32:44
actually
32:45
turns on their bits of their brain
32:47
pathways that are the courtship
32:49
initiating so they send
32:50
rotting fruit and they immediately want
32:52
to have a shag and that is useful i
32:54
think because rotting fruit is a good
32:55
place to lay eggs
32:56
as a woman so if a man fancies you when
32:58
you're near rotting fruit that's handy
33:00
because then you can put your babies in
33:02
fruit speaking of the chemicals
33:05
if you have a fly that falls into your
33:06
glass of wine
33:08
one single fly is enough to ruin the
33:09
whole glass of wine okay but only if
33:11
it's a female fly
33:13
and it's because it's the pheromones in
33:15
the fly that cause the wine to
33:17
taste a bit skunky if the males go in
33:19
actually it will still taste the same
33:20
and they tested this
33:22
by um getting the pheromones out of the
33:24
flies
33:25
and then putting it into some wine and
33:26
getting people to taste it and they
33:28
found that um
33:29
just ten just one nanogram of a
33:31
pheromone was enough
33:32
for a small glass of wine for them to be
33:34
able to taste the difference
33:36
one nanogram which is like i don't know
33:38
i think it's like
33:39
a thousandth of a millionth of a gram or
33:41
something like that in a small glass of
33:43
wine
33:43
in a small glass of wine sorry hang on
33:45
and a small glass of wine
33:46
is something that
33:50
is what you've got left
33:53
mine's become small it always goes
33:55
through the small
33:56
phase so i worked out what the
33:59
equivalent of this is
34:00
and it's worth it's the equivalent of
34:02
putting one pedal bins worth of ribena
34:04
into loch ness and the whole lake
34:07
tasting of black currant
34:09
wow that's great these people must be
34:11
wine snobs who are tasting that one tiny
34:14
nanogram of female pheromone
34:16
i think it adds to the flavor of
34:18
anything
34:20
i stirred flies into this before i came
34:22
on
34:23
there was a study on fly's response to
34:25
carbonated beverages
34:27
and their attraction to carbon dioxide
34:29
and the sky report about it was
34:30
headlined why do flies suddenly appear
34:33
every time you open a beer
34:35
[Laughter]
34:40
we're gonna have to wrap up soon um so
34:43
before we do
34:44
you guys go uh i can tell you about dung
34:47
beetle sex yeah please
34:51
oh that is an unbelievably niche pawn
34:55
subject
34:56
[Laughter]
34:57
what do they do you need to delete your
34:59
history immediately whoever that was
35:02
um no what's interesting about them is
35:04
that they get stds
35:06
um but actually it's a good thing for
35:08
them
35:09
it's if you're a dung beetle and you get
35:12
an sdd std this is really good for you
35:14
because
35:15
they get this kind of nematode worm and
35:17
it helps to get the right kind of
35:19
bacteria eats all the bad bacteria in
35:21
their body
35:22
which means a good bacteria can come in
35:24
and it means that then they can eat
35:25
their food properly
35:26
it's like if you have sex with someone
35:28
and feed them yakult at the same time
35:31
wow
35:37
another niche kind of porn preference
35:42
for that bit of advice so let's wrap it
35:44
up again okay that is it that is all of
35:47
our facts thank you so much for
35:49

01:28
hello and welcome to another episode of
01:31
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
01:33
this week coming to you live
01:35
from aberdeen
01:43
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
01:45
here with anna chazinski
01:47
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
01:49
and once again we have gathered around
01:51
the microphones with our four
01:52
favorite facts from the last seven days
01:54
and in no particular order
01:56
here we go starting with you andy
01:59
my fact is that 15 years after it was
02:02
invented
02:02
the us government banned sliced bread
02:07
why did they ban it
02:09
it was it was too good no um it was
02:12
it was 1943 it was a very bad time
02:15
actually it was a famously bad time
02:16
it was a time of war and uh
02:20
it's not an
02:24
uh so it was done with machines as it
02:27
still is sliced bread
02:28
and um it was the machines were very
02:30
expensive so if you didn't
02:32
pre-slice it it was a way to keep the
02:33
prices of bread down because
02:35
the us never had bread rationing but um
02:37
lots of nations did but the price had
02:38
been going up everywhere hadn't it
02:40
because of the war
02:40
exactly yeah and i needed to use like
02:42
the metal for aeroplanes and stuff
02:45
all the materials exactly yeah and the
02:48
bread for
02:49
missiles yeah
02:53
you know when you put in your mouth and
02:54
you lick it and it's like a little
02:55
torpedo yeah
02:56
like that um well
03:00
they know they know okay bread torpedoes
03:03
aside
03:04
uh it was a serious like you could be
03:08
fined a
03:08
thousand dollars if you used sliced
03:11
bread or if you sold it so
03:12
a baker could be fine yeah not if you
03:14
wet a sandwich no
03:16
but couldn't you just slice it on your
03:18
own yeah yeah yeah you could you were
03:19
still allowed to slice it on your own
03:22
you didn't have to shove the whole loaf
03:23
in your face
03:25
which is how much for the walk
03:27
[Laughter]
03:29
you know it also happened in britain
03:31
actually in wartime um so i was looking
03:33
at this
03:33
and it's not very well reported but if
03:35
you go into the old british newspaper
03:36
archive
03:37
and you type in sliced bread the main
03:39
things that come up are people being
03:41
arrested throughout the uk
03:43
for uh slicing bread not at home
03:46
but in shops and stuff so it was from
03:48
1941 and i actually found an article
03:50
from 1949 where it was still illegal i
03:52
think it was in liverpool
03:52
that someone was arrested for uh for
03:55
slicing bread still
03:56
really yeah yeah people were really
03:57
annoyed though i mean the band didn't
03:59
last long
04:00
no it lasted in america only what a year
04:02
or maybe less than a year
04:04
yeah yeah when the law first came in in
04:06
the newspapers which were all written by
04:08
men
04:08
they were complaining that housewives
04:10
would not know how to cut bread
04:12
and so um they were giving the best kind
04:14
of um
04:15
ideas of how to cut bread that they
04:17
could do which was keep your head down
04:19
keep your eye on the loaf
04:20
and don't bear down which is basically
04:22
how to play golf
04:24
[Laughter]
04:26
and then about two or three months later
04:28
when the band stopped um the headline in
04:30
the new york times was
04:32
sliced bread put back on sale housewives
04:34
thumbs safe again
04:37
the way that sliced bread was packaged
04:39
back then was that they shove hat pins
04:41
through
04:42
the slices in order to keep them
04:43
together um and that was actually how
04:45
housewives did that before he invented
04:46
the machine
04:47
as well you chuck a hat pin in sliced
04:49
bread and it doesn't fall apart
04:51
yeah it came with instructions like like
04:53
an ikea cabinet like you were given
04:56
instructions for how to unwrap it to
04:58
take the pins out
04:59
remove your bread stick the pin back in
05:01
so because the idea was no one wanted
05:03
sliced bread because psychologically
05:04
they were told
05:05
that a a a loafer slice spread would go
05:08
stale much quicker
05:09
so he had to get it scientifically it
05:11
goes dale much quicker
05:14
but uh it's mostly psychological
05:18
so it was if slices fall apart from each
05:21
other then you've got that exposed
05:22
surface area that's going to be more
05:23
vulnerable to staleness
05:24
yes yeah yep so he was just telling them
05:27
facts and
05:28
um and we love facts on this podcast so
05:33
um some more bread laws yeah history so
05:36
um until the 24th of september 2008 it
05:39
was illegal in the uk to sell a loaf of
05:41
bread
05:42
which wasn't 400 grams or 800 grams in
05:45
weight
05:46
really yeah and then the europeans
05:47
changed the law and now we could have
05:49
any kind of
05:50
sliced bread we can have we can have 500
05:52
grams or 600 grams or whatever we want
05:54
i can't wait till those days are over
05:56
[Laughter]
05:59
the paralysis of choice in the bakery
06:00
aisle well when this happened jonathan
06:03
wobton who owns warburton's bread
06:05
he said that now we can sell 600 gram
06:07
bread
06:08
which we think will be fantastically
06:10
popular
06:11
okay and i went on to ocado and looked
06:13
at the most popular breads that they
06:15
sell
06:15
and they are 800 grams 800 grams 800
06:18
grams 800 grams 400 grams
06:20
800 grams 400 grams 400 grams 400 grams
06:23
500 grams but that's gluten-free so it
06:25
doesn't really count
06:28
800 400 it just goes on and on and a 600
06:31
gram loaf is the 42nd most popular
06:34
bread for myself uh i found another
06:36
bread law
06:37
the french bread law so until 2015
06:40
bakers in paris were not all
06:41
allowed to go on their summer holidays
06:43
at the same time
06:44
so half of them had to stay open in july
06:47
and half of them had to stay open in
06:48
august because
06:49
the lots of people go on the holidays
06:51
and like it's really big in
06:52
in france and especially paris and um if
06:55
you broke the rules you were fined every
06:56
single day
06:57
you went on holiday when you weren't
06:58
allowed to as a baker
07:03
do you know why uh mechanized bread
07:06
making came into fashion so sliced bread
07:08
was all about
07:08
uh getting machines involved in the
07:10
bread process
07:11
and now i guess the artisan hipsters of
07:14
the world
07:15
think that you know you want handmade
07:17
bread and the sliced stuff
07:19
is you know it's rubbish but the turn of
07:22
the 20th century
07:23
it was terrible to be handmade because
07:25
being a baker was so
07:27
sweaty so this is one of the main
07:29
arguments was that
07:30
if you're a bigger you sweated so much
07:31
there was this woman called eliza acton
07:33
who was
07:33
arguing for uh mechanizing and adding
07:37
machines to the bread making process
07:38
in the 1840s and she was saying that
07:42
the problem is that due to the muscular
07:44
effort that the baker's body has to make
07:46
it's overflowing with perspiration
07:48
which falls in large drops and is
07:50
amalgamated with the dough
07:52
he is needing and becomes a part of the
07:54
liquid out of um great british bake off
07:59
but yeah the first machine made bread as
08:01
its main advertising slogans would say
08:04
untouched by human hands the idea was
08:06
that no human should get near it was
08:07
just machines
08:09
france has an online baguette booking
08:11
service
08:12
so you can buy i suppose if anyone was
08:15
going to have it france
08:17
so there was a it was started by a
08:19
burgundy man who was annoyed because the
08:20
shop
08:20
that wasn't the color of him was it he
08:23
was so angry
08:25
yeah he he was annoyed because he
08:29
the shop kept not having any fresh bread
08:31
when he got there because he got up very
08:33
late
08:33
and he he said i have two passions in
08:36
life
08:36
getting up late and fresh bread
08:40
he read he read this he read this poll
08:43
which said the result of the poll was
08:45
that 92 of french people
08:47
said they were terrified by the thought
08:49
of not having fresh bread
08:50
with a meal so he set up a thing where
08:52
you can just go online and reserve a
08:54
baguette in your local
08:56
boulangerie wow and then you go and pick
08:58
it up
08:59
terrified hey no wonder they didn't fare
09:02
well in the war
09:05
um so in turkey and egypt if you made
09:08
bread which was too light
09:10
um so it wasn't like 400 grams or
09:11
whatever it had to be um
09:13
you could be punished by having your ear
09:15
nailed to the doorpost of your shop
09:17
oh you'd have to try really hard to
09:20
style that out wouldn't you pretend to
09:21
be leaning against the door
09:22
to your shop all day oh morning
09:26
mrs jones just having a lean
09:30
um just one more tiny thing like another
09:32
wartime ban for the same reason
09:34
sausages were banned in germany which
09:36
was a horrible moment but this was in
09:38
the first world war and this was to make
09:40
airships so zeppelins uh very
09:43
tiny tiny airships
09:47
they put little amps in them and they
09:49
send them to invade
09:50
um no it was the fact that it was the
09:52
best kind of material to so
09:54
uh the sort of sheep's intestine that is
09:56
needed to wrap sausages
09:57
is the best kind of airtight material to
09:59
make airships out of and the zeppelin
10:01
was going to be the great
10:03
war weapon of the future and sausages
10:05
were banned because all of that cow
10:06
intestine and sheep intestine had to go
10:08
towards making airships
10:09
and they actually used to put that
10:10
kaiser's agents used to be sent to
10:12
butchers
10:13
across the land to guard them and make
10:15
sure that all of their sausages were
10:17
being sent to the mod
10:18
yeah really yeah but they weren't going
10:21
in and sneakily buying sausages and then
10:23
hustling them back to add to the giant
10:26
sausage
10:27
the giant wall sausage that they were
10:28
constructing what they were doing
10:31
it wasn't normal giant wall sausage they
10:33
were firing at the enemy
10:38
dispatch the giant war sausage
10:43
okay it is time for fact number two and
10:45
that is james
10:46
okay my fact this week is that a common
10:49
problem for ice hockey players
10:51
is that they have such muscley bums that
10:53
they can't find genes that fit
10:59
why do they have such muscley bums well
11:01
cause they're athletes done
11:02
but why do they specifically ice hockey
11:04
players is it that
11:05
i guess they're just doing a lot of
11:06
moving side to side i'm not an ice
11:08
hockey person myself but
11:12
you have to squat guys that's just good
11:15
advice in life
11:16
you have to squat always squat don't
11:19
stand up straight
11:20
and they do lots of turns and stuff and
11:21
so it's the it's the glutes and it's
11:23
their quadriceps that get much bigger
11:25
than the rest of their body
11:26
and this was an article in espn um and
11:29
there was a guy from the edmonton oilers
11:31
the captain's called conor mcdavid and
11:33
he said can it be hard for me to find
11:35
pants
11:36
yes always the waist you need to get
11:38
around your thighs and butt
11:40
but that doesn't always match how tall
11:41
you are i definitely have a hard time
11:43
finding jeans that fit and they went
11:44
through a whole load of hockey players
11:46
and asked them all and they all have
11:47
exactly the same problem
11:48
they can't get jeans that fit them but
11:51
they have they have like personal
11:52
tailors
11:53
um there's a guy who looks after over
11:55
250 hockey players goes around measuring
11:58
their butts and then
12:00
making sure he does and they never hear
12:03
from him again
12:07
there's also a company isn't there
12:09
called lululemon or
12:11
lululemon
12:14
if you're from the continent and they
12:16
market a line
12:17
of trousers uh that are for hockey
12:20
players
12:21
for what's called the hockey butt and
12:23
they specifically design their pants for
12:25
hockey players so they can play in them
12:27
yeah another company called gong show
12:28
they do the same thing
12:29
um just you know in case people think
12:31
they were being advertised by
12:33
lulu whatever they call it
12:36
[Music]
12:38
they have like um stretchy jeans spandex
12:41
in the jeans and their biggest pair of
12:43
jeans is called the quadrasaurus
12:45
nice nice very good you know um you can
12:48
get
12:49
stronger muscles just by thinking about
12:52
doing exercise
12:53
even if you do not tense your muscles so
12:56
you have to just
12:56
imagine i'm thinking about squatting
12:58
right now
13:00
well imagine contracting those muscles
13:02
as vividly as you can
13:03
really picture it
13:09
and the muscles don't get bigger they
13:10
don't grow larger but they do get
13:11
stronger so
13:12
you end up using more of the fibers in
13:15
individual muscles
13:16
just by thinking about it so not
13:17
actually just sitting and tensing where
13:19
you are but just
13:20
imagining tensing um the glutes are very
13:23
important and i think people think about
13:24
the gluteus maximus
13:26
as being the ass muscle that's the most
13:27
important but i've been reading a lot
13:28
about the
13:29
gluteus medius which a lot of people say
13:32
causes a vast majority
13:34
of injuries for sports people is it's in
13:35
the gluteus medius which is the muscle
13:37
that's in the middle between the maximus
13:39
and the minimus
13:40
and what that does it's quite cool
13:41
that's what basically stops you from
13:43
falling over
13:44
as far as i can tell so when you take a
13:46
step i never thought about this
13:48
but when you lift up your leg to step
13:50
forward if you were
13:51
a plastic doll then as soon as that
13:53
doll's leg lifts up
13:54
they just fall over and the only reason
13:57
you don't fall over is because your
13:58
gluteus medius is counterbalancing that
14:01
and so that's super important because
14:03
otherwise you topple over
14:04
and there's a special thing that is
14:06
called a trendelenburg
14:08
gate and that shows that you've got a
14:10
weak gluteus medius and that's the
14:12
supermodel walk so that's
14:14
you know when you walk and you over
14:16
compensate by kind of wiggling your hips
14:18
a lot
14:18
i sure do yeah well
14:23
but you don't know what i'm
14:24
overcompensating for
14:27
i think everyone here knows
14:33
that's to overcompensate for the fact
14:35
that your gluteus medius is
14:37
weak and so you have to lean your weight
14:39
on the opposite side
14:40
that's not lifting its leg up otherwise
14:42
you'd fall over
14:44
it's a very important muscle do you know
14:45
um you soon
14:47
they've been testing this out but soon
14:49
we might become when
14:50
so muscles if they get damaged often get
14:52
replaced but the problem is you can't
14:53
put
14:54
new muscle in uh because the living
14:56
cells don't quite react
14:58
so we might all soon be made up of
15:00
onions
15:01
because onions are being tested and seen
15:04
to be
15:05
it's true in them
15:07
[Applause]
15:08
this is onion transplants this is what
15:10
they're talking about so
15:12
you can take if you take the skin of an
15:14
onion or like a little bit of an onion
15:16
and you get rid of all the water you
15:17
dehydrate it it
15:18
acts very much like a muscle it
15:20
contracts and it moves and so on and
15:21
they've been
15:22
putting electrodes into it and seeing
15:24
how it responds to
15:26
basically work being worked out and it
15:28
works perfectly like a muscle
15:30
so they're suggesting that what we
15:32
should be doing in the future
15:33
is implanting our muscles with onions
15:36
instead
15:36
and be more vegetable based as humans
15:41
i'm so sorry your husband's a vegetables
15:43
look inside he's doing weights and he's
15:45
lifting everything up
15:47
did you know that we most of us have a
15:49
claw retractor muscle
15:51
a what claw retraction a claw
15:55
yes exactly does he retract his claws
15:57
yes he's a wolf great
15:59
um the hardened metallo skeleton
16:02
implanted by the military
16:03
okay
16:06
you got the reference too much um
16:10
so the chlorotractor muscle uh
16:12
officially called the palmaris longus
16:14
is something that about 85 of people
16:17
still have and you can tell whether or
16:19
not you have it and it's the muscle that
16:20
now cats for instance
16:22
uh use to attract their claws when
16:23
they're putting their claws in when
16:24
they're not using them
16:25
it's very important for primates when
16:26
they're climbing trees but we don't
16:28
really use it anymore
16:29
and 15 of people are missing it and the
16:31
way you can tell is you can clench your
16:33
fist or you
16:34
touch your thumb against your fourth or
16:36
fifth finger and sort of pull your hand
16:39
inwards towards your elbow and if you
16:41
can see the bit sticking up there
16:42
in this tendon in the wrist in the inner
16:44
wrist that means you've got it
16:46
about 15 percent of people don't have it
16:49
another 50 percent who don't have it
16:50
more evolve because you don't need it
16:52
exactly so if you don't have it well
16:54
done
16:56
i can't believe i'm still using your
16:57
palmaris longest
16:59
yeah you've got a huge one i'm afraid
17:00
you're very backward you've got seven
17:03
but i didn't know this and some people
17:05
have double ones like i've got a double
17:06
one
17:07
some people have just one long line one
17:09
long tendon and
17:10
i didn't realize some people don't have
17:11
that at all there is a muscle which
17:13
we've got
17:14
which is around your ear and it's
17:16
another leftover muscle
17:17
but if you can wiggle your ears some
17:19
people can do that and uh
17:21
if you you're just shaking your head
17:22
you're like
17:24
i've been shaking my head because i
17:26
can't do it
17:29
i'm more or less involved don't tell me
17:31
it's less about it again
17:32
i think it means you're more evolved
17:33
actually yeah so if you can't
17:35
so if you can wiggle your ears you have
17:37
a limited amount of control over these
17:39
muscles
17:39
but they're left over from a time and
17:41
this is many hundreds of thousands of
17:43
years ago
17:44
when we could prick up our ears to
17:46
locate the origin of a sound wow so
17:48
there are muscles still there
17:48
and they still respond to sound today
17:52
but they're not strong enough to move
17:53
your ear into position
17:55
but they are there still poor things so
17:57
they're just sitting there
17:58
saying i can hear a noise but they can't
18:01
have any impact on your body
18:02
yeah that's tragic
18:05
uh i have um a few facts on bums yeah oh
18:09
great um so sorry too enthusiastic
18:14
someone's ears pricked up
18:18
a selenadon is a little shrew it's found
18:21
in cuba and hispaniola
18:23
and um around there a dominican republic
18:25
and stuff like that
18:26
um females give birth to three offspring
18:29
but only two survive because she
18:31
only has two nipples and both nipples
18:34
are on her bum
18:36
no way so in the selenidom world if
18:38
anyone asks are you a bum man or a boob
18:41
man
18:41
the answer is yes
18:44
okay it's time for fact number three and
18:47
that is my fact
18:48
my fact this week is that when it was
18:50
playing on broadway
18:52
bill murray went to see the musical
18:54
groundhog day
18:56
then the next day he went again
18:59
[Applause]
19:01
and then the next day no he didn't do it
19:03
but yeah bill murray was seen
19:05
really it really threw a lot of people
19:07
because the paparazzi were like bill
19:09
is coming tonight the cast and crew knew
19:10
he was coming and then there he was
19:12
again the next night
19:13
um he went on the first night with the
19:15
original writer of the show which is
19:17
called danny rubin um
19:18
and he went with a friend of his uh
19:20
sorry a relative his brother
19:22
and then when he saw it it was done in
19:25
such a way so the music and
19:26
the lyrics are by tim mentioned he's a
19:28
very deep thinker and
19:30
he basically saw what he wanted the
19:32
movie to be something that was
19:33
steeped in philosophy um very different
19:35
to the movie which
19:36
turned out to be an all-out comedy and
19:38
he fell in love with it and he loved it
19:40
so much he said i've got to come back so
19:41
he went the second night on his own
19:43
because he just wanted to experience it
19:44
properly again
19:45
really yeah but he was erratic as hell
19:48
he was climbing over audience members he
19:50
was
19:51
tipping people thousands of dollars he's
19:54
yeah
19:54
he does do that doesn't he yeah yeah he
19:56
like to get to the bar he climbed back
19:58
over a bunch of seats rather than go the
20:00
normal way
20:01
but he did i think he cried at the end
20:03
of the first performance because he was
20:05
very moved by
20:06
it so because he knew he was going to
20:07
have to go back the next day and it was
20:09
so [ __ ]
20:10
i've got to see this joke through
20:13
i've been looking up uh broadway shows
20:15
which closed quickly
20:17
and there are some incredible ones that
20:20
have opened so there was the the most
20:22
we should say the ground all day closed
20:24
quite fast on broadway despite bill
20:25
murray liking it no one else did
20:26
despite having a plot about something
20:28
that runs forever and ever and ever
20:30
the irony yeah um so there was one in
20:33
1983
20:34
which was called moose murders and it
20:35
was meant to be a kind of fast and a
20:37
funny show
20:38
and it lasted one night into its proper
20:41
run
20:42
uh although we are on the first night of
20:43
our tour so we can't criticize
20:46
but the writer was a guy called arthur
20:48
bicknell and
20:49
the reviews included things like if your
20:51
name is arthur bicknell or
20:53
anything like it change it
20:56
and after one performance the writer
20:58
arthur bicknell he saw a woman on the
21:00
street
21:00
shout to a new york cop officer arrest
21:03
that show
21:04
[Laughter]
21:06
you know another big broadway disaster
21:08
was um they
21:09
converted they they turned the novel and
21:12
i think movie
21:12
carry the stephen king book into a
21:15
musical
21:16
um and it closed after five shows it was
21:20
said to be
21:21
the most expensive flop in all of
21:23
broadway history
21:24
um it was open in 1988 and uh the new
21:27
york times compared it to the hindenburg
21:29
disaster
21:30
yeah favorably or
21:34
it was just like a massive sausage
21:36
burning up in the sky
21:37
have you heard of what the sequel kind
21:39
of the sequel to oliver
21:41
so after lionel bart wrote oliver
21:43
exclamation mark you know the extreme
21:45
the next one oliver question mark
21:49
um it was twang with two exclamation
21:51
marks
21:52
and it was a burlesque robin hood show
21:55
wow
21:56
and he lost all his money on it oh no he
21:59
lost all the money he'd
22:00
gained and earned through oliver because
22:02
it was such a flop
22:04
it's because oliver it's funny lionel
22:06
bar isn't it because i oliver's my
22:08
favorite
22:08
musical my favorite thing maybe it's so
22:11
good but it does have an exclamation
22:13
mark at the end of it
22:14
oliver and you think oh gosh that's a
22:16
bit tacky i wonder why you did that
22:18
and i think he thought maybe the success
22:20
was due to the exclamation mark i'll try
22:22
to next time
22:23
my problem with oliver was no twist
22:28
it's like you didn't know what you were
22:29
coming to
22:32
i'm at a really good article i was just
22:34
looking into a broadway and broadway
22:36
shows and what it's like but in broadway
22:37
they have this weird practice americans
22:39
sort of applaud more readily maybe
22:41
than it's habitual here especially
22:43
tonight
22:45
[Applause]
22:49
it's too late now and my lawsuit and
22:52
article complaining about this because
22:53
they will appeal when a celebrity comes
22:55
on stage and
22:55
a lot of shows now have a famous person
22:57
in them so he said for instance um
22:59
paul rudd was in paul rudd who was in
23:02
friends and he's a famous actor
23:03
was in a show recently and his opening
23:06
scene was he had to shoot two characters
23:08
dead
23:08
but they have to pause for the audience
23:10
applause so he walked on stage shot a
23:12
character
23:12
and had to leave a massive pause while
23:14
the audience all applauded before he
23:16
could shoot his other character in this
23:17
climactic scene was the other guy
23:19
running around looking for a way out of
23:21
the room
23:22
mourning his dead friend
23:23
[Laughter]
23:25
stage manager in the wings pushing him
23:27
back on um
23:28
and directors have actually started to
23:30
try and circumvent this and so they
23:32
started having lead actors for instance
23:34
speaking off stage
23:35
starting their lines off stage so that
23:37
you're sort of in the scene before the
23:39
audience applaud so they feel worse
23:40
about applauding
23:41
or sometimes they come on with a mask on
23:42
more often now they're really
23:44
celebrities
23:44
in 2011 ben stiller was in a show called
23:47
in the house of blue leaves
23:49
and he was positioned to start with his
23:50
back to the audience so they wouldn't
23:52
know so people couldn't
23:53
gratuitously applause when they saw him
23:55
but people recognized his silhouette
23:56
from his back
23:57
and started screaming and applauding uh
24:00
and um
24:01
awarding him a standing ovation
24:02
according to mark lawson before we even
24:04
turn around so yeah different practice
24:06
can i pick you up on something you just
24:07
said before
24:07
did you say paul rudd from friends
24:12
massive blockbusters like ant-man famous
24:14
for clueless and you've
24:16
what was he in friends i think friends
24:18
is a big thing isn't it
24:20
paul rudd he was in more of friends than
24:23
those other things he did
24:24
okay he was phoebe's husband we don't
24:26
need to get into it now
24:27
[Music]
24:28
um in 2018 the first british performance
24:31
of the show
24:32
titanic the musical was stopped
24:35
after the ship hit the iceberg and
24:37
plaster started falling onto the stage
24:41
it was genuinely stopped due to a health
24:43
and
24:45
oh safety so good you know before there
24:47
was the wizard of oz movie um
24:49
baum wrote the musical of the wizard of
24:52
oz for broadway
24:53
so there were 60 songs to it and it was
24:55
very different to what we now know
24:57
yes 60 songs in this musical um
25:01
in it it's too it's far too bad is it um
25:04
the wicked witch of the west was not in
25:05
it
25:06
missing altogether it took her out um
25:08
well the character wasn't in it yeah the
25:09
character was taken away there was a
25:11
different villain
25:11
um there was the cat the cowardly lion
25:13
was a very small role in it
25:15
and toto was replaced uh with a cow
25:17
called imogen
25:20
okay it is time for our final fact of
25:22
the show and that
25:24
is chozinski my fact this week is that
25:26
there is only one confirmed
25:28
male yangtze giant soft shell turtle
25:31
left in the world and his penis is
25:34
broken
25:37
this is actually a bit of a disaster
25:42
this guy's in china there are four of
25:44
these yangtze soft shell turtles
25:46
in the world two of them are in a zoo in
25:48
china two of them are in separate lakes
25:50
in vietnam i think they're in stops with
25:52
each other they won't speak so we don't
25:53
know what sex they are
25:55
but in china one's female one's male uh
25:58
and they're obviously endangered because
25:59
there are only four of them
26:00
and they've been trying to make them for
26:02
ages but they can't because his penis is
26:03
damaged and
26:05
it got damaged a while ago so he's he's
26:08
quite old they live a very long time and
26:10
almost 30 years ago he was introduced to
26:13
a female turtle to mate with her so they
26:16
could
26:17
uh make the species continue and it
26:19
turned out once he was introduced to her
26:20
that her
26:21
was a hymn and it was just another
26:23
turtle and they fought
26:25
a lot uh because they were rivals and
26:27
one of them died
26:28
the one that wasn't the one we're
26:29
talking about and the other one ended up
26:30
with a ruined penis
26:32
and they've tried artificial
26:33
insemination and it has not worked
26:37
that's very sad it's disastrous i know
26:39
it's a problem for the yangtze soft
26:41
shoulder turtles
26:42
yeah and he's very he is very old isn't
26:43
he he's like 100 years old
26:45
uh yeah i think he is they they
26:48
certainly do
26:48
grow to be 100 maybe 120 max
26:52
yeah so what are they doing are they
26:53
gonna well
26:55
so they've tried artificial insemination
26:57
three times i think so they've got this
26:59
female
27:00
in the zoo with him and it's very
27:02
complex artificially inseminating them
27:04
because the genitalia are quite
27:06
difficult for both of these turtles so
27:08
the males
27:09
according to the new york times it looks
27:10
a bit like a medieval weapon with fleshy
27:12
spikes and lobes poking out of it
27:14
and it's designed to perfectly navigate
27:16
like um
27:17
like theseus and the minor thesis is the
27:19
penis and the labyrinth is the vagina
27:21
what's what's the minor tour uh the
27:24
minotaur i think is the egg
27:26
who's the princess who said the end this
27:29
is broken down remarkably first
27:32
it's a zookeeper my metaphors run
27:36
out but the genitals are very difficult
27:38
so artificial insemination has been
27:40
really hard and unsuccessful
27:41
yeah scientific americans said of the
27:43
turtle penis that
27:45
it has this weird configuration of
27:47
sinuses and associated folds
27:49
it says some of the configurations look
27:52
terrifying
27:54
others look really terrifying
27:58
they're so cool soft shell turtles oh
28:01
yeah yeah they're not like a turtle
28:02
that's been run over don't they yeah
28:03
they've got this sort of
28:04
pancake on their back um and it's it's
28:07
leathery skin it's not a
28:09
hard shell so hence the name and they
28:11
can they can breathe
28:12
partially through their soft shell um
28:16
and they hibernate in pools of water and
28:18
they're kind of half buried
28:19
and we didn't know how they lived long
28:21
enough to they we didn't know how they
28:23
got enough oxygen under the water
28:24
and it turns out that how they do it
28:26
they do press ups under the water
28:29
yeah so they're partially buried but
28:30
they do press ups with their back end
28:32
they raise and lower their back end
28:33
thousands of times in a row
28:35
and we think it's because it moves the
28:37
water around so it replaces the water
28:39
next to them which they've already
28:40
breathed in and out of
28:41
through with oxygenated water wow so
28:44
they can get a bit more oxygen
28:46
so they're just lying at the bottom of
28:47
rivers doing press-ups all the time
28:48
that's
28:49
so cool you were asking den about what
28:51
they're going to do um
28:52
like in the future the truth is the the
28:55
two turtles that live in the lakes
28:56
they're not really sure if they're male
28:58
or female
28:59
in fact one of them they're not they
29:00
only got it from dna collected from
29:02
water samples
29:04
so they kind of they took the dna out of
29:06
it and realized that there must be a
29:07
turtle living in there but they just
29:09
don't know
29:09
anything about it at all and actually
29:11
it's really hard to tell whether a soft
29:13
shell turtle is male or female because
29:15
for the males the penis is hidden inside
29:17
the shell
29:18
um the best way to find them is to give
29:20
them a vibrator
29:23
this is genuinely the best way to sex a
29:25
tartus
29:27
if you were to get a vibrator on a
29:30
tortoise
29:31
and you kind of kind of go in circles
29:34
around its belly
29:35
and then you move it down towards the
29:36
tail a hundred percent of the time
29:39
he will either send out his penis or
29:41
he'll be a
29:42
female and not send out the people send
29:44
it out it's not an ambassador
29:45
[Laughter]
29:48
you i have a mission for you be back
29:51
within the month
29:53
explore the source of this erotic
29:54
massage
29:57
yeah this is a relatively new invention
29:58
isn't it i think a guy called donald
30:00
mcknight
30:01
who's a phd candidate in australia
30:02
invented a vibrator for
30:04
these uh these giants turtles
30:08
specifically for turtles turtles
30:10
absolutely um
30:11
and he said that the difficult thing
30:12
about them is they demand foreplay
30:14
apparently he said ultimately most
30:17
erections happened when the vibrator was
30:19
on the tail itself
30:20
but the turtles generally won't let you
30:21
start there you first have to spend a
30:23
few minutes on other parts of the body
30:25
yeah ask it how his days be he also said
30:29
um
30:29
we weren't doing this because we thought
30:31
it would be fun
30:34
weren't doing no they weren't
30:37
and then he said like i said it was a
30:39
successful 100 of the time and he added
30:41
one of them was showing his penis in
30:43
like four seconds
30:44
um there's another really cool thing
30:46
that turtles have the sort of ability
30:48
they have
30:49
so they this is snapping turtles uh
30:52
common snapping turtles they live in mud
30:54
holes in the winter
30:55
and they go back to exactly the same mud
30:57
hole every year
30:58
and they've measured it and it's to the
31:00
centimeter
31:02
every single and scientists tested this
31:04
by giving them a drug
31:05
called scopolamine which prevents the
31:07
brain from forming memories
31:09
and they observe that the turtles just
31:10
wandered around in circles
31:12
not finding their way back which seems
31:14
very cruel but then it wore off
31:16
and they just go straight back to the
31:17
path and then they land right to the
31:19
centimeter in their thing
31:20
it's amazing yeah but i found another
31:22
thing off the back of this um
31:24
scopolamine uh is a drug that works on
31:27
humans as well it's a very powerful
31:29
knocks out your memory basically so
31:30
there was a campaign in the 1910s
31:33
by feminists at the time for the right
31:36
to forget childbirth by taking this drug
31:39
wow
31:40
they said we do not want to remember it
31:42
and so if you take it you would
31:44
basically wake up with a baby after 12
31:46
hours
31:47
and that was it we'll be offering this
31:48
drug on the way out tonight by the way
31:54
as traumatic as childbirth
31:58
yeah people people traveled from all
32:00
over europe and from america
32:01
specifically to germany because that was
32:03
where you could get it
32:04
you know without a big prescription or a
32:05
big kfl and there was an association
32:07
called the twilight sleep association
32:09
who campaigned to get it universally
32:10
accepted no way
32:12
people always sort of claim that
32:14
childbirth uh there's some sort of
32:16
hormone release that means you forget it
32:17
anyway because it's so
32:18
rubbish but i don't know if that's true
32:21
because i haven't done it
32:22
[Laughter]
32:23
or have i
32:30
[Music]
32:33
um on animal penises did you know that
32:37
alligator penises are always erect
32:40
and they are we i think the only animal
32:43
that has a permanently erect penis
32:45
which is quite interesting i think so
32:48
and they're also the only animal that
32:49
has a penis that doesn't inflate or
32:51
enlarge when it's aroused so
32:53
every other animal has you know its
32:56
penis inflates or enlarges but the
32:58
alligator penis sits inside its body
33:00
it's just this lump
33:02
of protein basically uh and is
33:05
it's free floating and it sits in this
33:07
sort of cradle which is its cloaker
33:09
which if you think of it like a hammock
33:11
which the penis is in and then when it
33:12
needs to um procreate
33:15
then it just flies it out so the hammock
33:17
tenses up
33:18
and it fires this out like a projectile
33:20
dispatch the love
33:22
sausage
33:27
