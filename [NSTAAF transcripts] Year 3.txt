hello and welcome to another episode of
00:18
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:20
this week coming to you
00:21
live from newport my name is dan
00:23
schreiber and please welcome to the
00:25
stage it's anna chazinski james harkin
00:27
and andy murray
00:35
and once again we have gathered around
00:37
the microphones with our four favorite
00:38
facts from the last seven days and in no
00:40
particular order
00:41
here we go starting with you james
00:44
harkin
00:44
okay my fact this week is that grumpy
00:47
from the seven dwarfs is not
00:49
nearly grumpy enough sounds like an
00:52
opinion
00:55
it is an opinion i'd say it's the
00:56
opinion of some researchers from duke
00:58
university in north carolina
01:00
and what they did is they looked at a
01:01
load of movies that are aimed at
01:03
children so they would be rated you in
01:05
the uk
01:06
they split all the characters up in
01:08
class so you have your upper class your
01:10
middle class and your lower class
01:11
and they decided that the depiction of
01:13
working class was unrealistic
01:15
and that the seven dwarfs would not be
01:17
singing cheerfully as they walked down
01:19
to the mine
01:20
[Laughter]
01:23
so james what who were who were the
01:25
scientists um yeah they were just people
01:27
at duke university in north carolina um
01:29
to be honest they are you know they're
01:30
cartoons aren't they you don't really
01:32
expect them to be
01:33
all that kind of realistic but
01:35
scientists don't like it when you get
01:36
things wrong
01:37
in the lion king they're hyenas in the
01:39
lion king are the bad guys
01:41
and some of the artists for the film
01:43
spent two days observing hyenas
01:45
in the hills above the campus of where
01:47
they were and the scientists who were
01:49
with them said look hyenas are good guys
01:51
don't
01:51
don't depict them as idiots as evil
01:54
people and they did
01:55
and then one of them sued one of the
01:57
hyenas
02:01
that is litigious and i think they are
02:02
evil as a result of that
02:05
no that wouldn't be very realistic
02:07
either wouldn't it no it was one of the
02:08
scientists
02:09
so i would watch that film though one of
02:11
the highness from the original film
02:14
you know there's a lion king uh three
02:16
which is like
02:17
so the lion king's sort of based on
02:18
hamlet and then the lion king three
02:21
begins with timon and pumbaa the comedy
02:23
characters
02:24
and they're based on guildenstern and
02:26
rosencrantz ah in the original thing
02:29
but then the lion king three is based on
02:30
guildenstern and rosencrantz are dead
02:32
the tom stoppard play but no it begins
02:34
with timon and pumbaa watching the lion
02:36
king one
02:36
in a cinema this is how the lion king
02:38
three begins wow and they say
02:40
that's not how it happened we're going
02:41
to tell the story of how it actually
02:42
happened and it's all the other bits
02:44
so it's guildenstern and rose and cancer
02:46
guildenstern are dead
02:48
but from the perspective of before
02:50
talking america amazing
02:51
yeah so what the seven dwarfs um so
02:54
originally they have no names in the
02:55
grim brothers story they have no names
02:57
okay and then when disney did the the
03:00
famous
03:00
film in 1937 they had this they had
03:02
about 50 potential names for the doors
03:04
which were slowly whittled down and the
03:06
rejected names included
03:07
jumpy deafy
03:11
uh hickey baldy puffy
03:14
stuffy and awful
03:19
i actually made a list of my dream seven
03:21
dwarves
03:23
i think these are all on the disney
03:25
potentials list as well
03:26
there's slotty hot sea and chesty which
03:28
i think are obviously
03:29
obviously a bit of a threesome um and
03:31
then awful
03:33
goopy snuffle and big o ego i think that
03:36
would be a better seven dwarves
03:42
[Laughter]
03:45
i actually read that when they picked
03:47
dopey as one of the characters
03:49
that people working at disney said to
03:51
walt disney that that's not a good name
03:53
to use because this is meant to be an
03:55
old tale
03:55
and dopey is a relatively recent hip
03:58
name
03:59
and so people will think that that's not
04:01
a good name oh yeah because like
04:03
dope just meant good didn't it yeah
04:04
exactly and so disney said well it's not
04:07
a new name it was used in the
04:08
shakespeare play so they went oh okay of
04:09
course sorry
04:10
he made that up there was never
04:15
[Laughter]
04:18
i actually um i actually once lost a
04:20
school quiz off the back of a question
04:22
of name all the seven dwarves oh yeah
04:24
we got six of them and we were stuck on
04:26
the seventh and my friend my
04:28
best friend dan suddenly went oh my god
04:30
i know it because it's my dad's name
04:32
so
04:36
sneezy his dad his dad was a rock star
04:39
in australia a really big rock star
04:40
called doc neeson and he goes i know it
04:43
now doc is not his dad's real name so
04:46
what he ended up putting on the paper as
04:48
the seventh dwarf
04:49
was bernard
04:53
and we're looking are you sure
04:55
definitely i've grown up
04:57
everyone's like oh like the dwarf you
04:59
know
05:01
so there's some controversy about this
05:03
fact because um
05:04
obviously as a study some would say it
05:07
is
05:08
fatuous the word has been used by others
05:11
around this table
05:12
studying this kind of thing and drawing
05:13
these conclusions um
05:15
so i was looking at other potentially
05:16
factual studies and um
05:18
so there were two studies one in 2008
05:20
and one in 2013 looking at how
05:22
films can affect people psychologically
05:24
and so whether you know we should be
05:26
worried about the effect of hollywood
05:27
films for instance on society and
05:29
ourselves 2008 there was an edinburgh
05:32
university
05:33
recruited 100 volunteers and the study
05:36
deduced
05:36
that fans of romantic comedies have a
05:39
stronger belief in predestined love
05:41
and they have more unrealistic
05:42
expectations for relationships so
05:43
romantic comedies
05:45
bad give us unrealistic expectations of
05:47
relationships
05:48
2013 there was another study looking
05:50
into exactly the same thing
05:52
found that there is no correlation
05:54
between people who are interested in
05:55
watching romantic comedies
05:56
and people who have unrealistic ideas
05:58
about them so really you can make a
06:00
study say whatever it is you want to
06:01
prove
06:02
it'd be good if the leads of those two
06:04
papers got together
06:06
and then had a beautiful relationship
06:09
that's the thing like i i know that
06:11
sometimes they do seem
06:13
like they they shouldn't have been done
06:14
but i love the studies that make no
06:16
sense
06:17
here's a great one i really like this
06:18
from 2005. this is what the study was
06:20
about
06:21
far away objects are tougher to see
06:25
and they confirm that to be true
06:28
swallowing more than one magnet is
06:32
dangerous
06:34
there is i think it is a problem with
06:35
kids because um magnets are sold now as
06:37
office stress
06:38
relievers i think and um yeah apparently
06:42
sure but if you swallow one it is bad
06:44
but there is
06:45
there are like hundreds of people who
06:46
admitted to ers in america every year
06:49
kids who have swallowed two of them and
06:51
obviously that really screws up your
06:52
intestines because as soon as you saw
06:54
the second one
06:54
they try to find each other in your
06:56
insides and disrupt everything else in
06:58
the meantime oh so that is quite bad it
07:00
is amazing we need to move on to our
07:01
next fact does anyone have anything
07:03
before we do
07:03
uh i can give you one more study um
07:05
that's kind of a bit fatuous but also
07:07
about disney stuff
07:08
um so they did this thing where they had
07:11
men watching movies
07:13
and they had some which were sad movies
07:14
and some which were happy movies and the
07:16
happy movie was the jungle book which
07:18
would make everyone happy
07:19
yeah and so they made them watch this
07:20
jungle book and then they took swabs
07:22
from their armpits
07:23
and then they gave the swabs to women
07:26
and asked them to smell them
07:28
and smelled all the different um armpits
07:30
of people who've watched all the
07:31
different movies
07:32
and they found that people who'd watched
07:33
happier movies when you smell their
07:35
armpits it makes you smile more
07:38
what i mean you can't be smiling much
07:41
because you're smelling an armpit
07:44
yeah it could be more of a grimace
07:47
um okay it is time for fact number two
07:50
and that
07:50
is andrew hunter murray my fact this
07:52
week is that the ancient romans had
07:55
party bags
07:58
so in ancient rome if you went to a
08:00
dinner party
08:01
uh at the end of it you would be given a
08:02
thing called an apophoreta which
08:04
literally means a take away so they
08:06
invented takeaways as well
08:08
and that we know about them because
08:11
there was a poet called marshall and he
08:12
wrote a whole book about them
08:14
it's 221 pairs of lines and it's
08:17
everything the things that were given
08:18
away
08:19
so they included toothpaste whips
08:22
seashells bladder footballs or i
08:26
think i translated this right a pastry
08:28
penis
08:30
don't get that in greg
08:34
that's true and he said even if you
08:36
consume every part of it you will not be
08:37
the less pure
08:38
that's good
08:42
so they just you had you had this huge
08:43
range of things you could be given at
08:45
the end of the night it was very
08:46
exciting
08:46
wow yeah you could also take your food
08:48
away at the end of the night after roman
08:50
parties couldn't you had a doggy bag
08:51
they had doggy bags they were the
08:53
inventors of the doggy bag which is
08:55
unbelievably cool yeah
08:56
i think it was called a map you had to
08:58
bring your own doggy bag sometimes i
08:59
think so it was called a map i
09:01
uh or mapper i guess in the singular and
09:03
it was a piece of cloth and you'd bring
09:05
it and if you had leftovers you wrap
09:06
them up and you take them away with you
09:08
wow that's really interesting there was
09:10
i remember reading once that there was
09:12
so there were a lot of houses in rome
09:13
which were above shops
09:15
uh and if you lived in one of these
09:16
flats they were quite low roofed and um
09:18
they didn't want people
09:20
like the shops to catch on fire so you
09:21
weren't allowed to cook in them
09:23
and so if you wanted to eat anything you
09:24
had to get everything take away
09:26
really yeah wait it's just a fact
09:29
that's amazing yeah it's good that isn't
09:31
it so you want to go to these parties
09:33
all the time to bring your
09:34
doggy bag home so what were the parties
09:36
like back then were they were they wild
09:38
were they raucous
09:38
they they've i think they varied like
09:40
parties today then
09:42
the more i looked into it they had hot
09:44
tub parties i found out yeah which i
09:46
didn't know about
09:47
did they have toga parties
09:50
they didn't wear togas most of the time
09:51
did they did they i think they were
09:53
tunics yeah i think they hated them
09:55
didn't they they had to wear them every
09:56
now and then but they were really
09:58
awkward to wear
09:58
was it not roosevelt had a toga party
10:01
because people
10:02
took the mickey out of him and said that
10:03
he was acting like a caesar and so his
10:05
wife
10:06
kind of threw a party to as if to say
10:08
like as if to a snook to the um
10:10
to the man i believe that he was the man
10:13
what are you talking about
10:14
right yeah to the to the little man
10:18
yeah roman parties it's a good question
10:20
one of the things that i've always
10:21
thought would be have been awkward at
10:22
roman parties is the fact that everyone
10:23
had to lie down and so at dinner parties
10:26
everyone lay down as we know and uh
10:27
you'd have a couch arrangement where
10:29
there would be a couch or a bed
10:31
on three walls of the room and you'd
10:34
have the hosts on the middle couch
10:35
and then the top guests there were
10:37
seating plans so i think they also came
10:38
up with seating plans
10:39
and the most favored guests would get
10:41
the couch where you had the better view
10:43
of the host and you had a really nice
10:44
view out of the building and then the
10:46
less favored guest just got a view of
10:47
the wall
10:48
um and you had to lie down and you lay
10:51
on like your left arm and ate your
10:52
food with your right arm it just sounds
10:54
really uncomfortable um
10:56
so another thing the romans invented was
10:58
the concept of deal or no deal
10:59
[Music]
11:02
in that this is invented by the emperor
11:05
augustus
11:06
he asked his guests to bid sums of money
11:10
for pictures
11:11
when they were when they were faced to
11:13
the wall so you had to bid a sum of
11:15
money on a picture
11:16
which was you couldn't see the value of
11:17
it and i gather that that
11:20
is what happens that is exactly the same
11:22
[Laughter]
11:24
so that is and then they turn the
11:25
painting around to reveal it at the end
11:27
yeah
11:28
cool that is amazing that is deal no
11:29
deal i was still honored
11:31
wow and he was amazing because he did
11:32
this thing where he said
11:34
you also when you went to a dinner party
11:36
with augustus you would pay for a token
11:38
and it was inscribed with what you might
11:40
get but
11:40
they varied hugely so you you couldn't
11:43
really see what was on the token before
11:44
you bought it so
11:45
again it was like a blind auction that's
11:47
like a lucky dip
11:48
like a lucky dip and so you could either
11:51
get some gold or you could get a sponge
11:53
so it was really varied and then
11:56
a later emperor ella gaboulos he gave
11:59
out
11:59
things called lucky chances which were
12:01
these special spoons and that was
12:02
inscribed with what you'd want and it
12:04
might say 10 on it
12:05
and you'd redeem it and they'd say oh
12:06
you've won 10 pounds of gold or it might
12:08
be that you won 10
12:09
flies or something so it really varied
12:12
and they started giving them out at the
12:13
coliseum
12:14
and when they had a lottery in the the
12:15
games in the coliseum
12:17
that it was uh you just won a token and
12:20
you'd redeem it and see what you've done
12:21
you might have won 10 bears how
12:23
terrifying to have the 10 yeah
12:25
you'd wonder 10 times i have sex with
12:28
your wife
12:29
it could be anything you shouldn't ever
12:32
run the lottery
12:32
[Laughter]
12:36
we need to move on to our uh next fact
12:38
anyone got anything else i can quickly
12:40
tell you that there's 808 million pounds
12:42
spent on party bags
12:44
for children's parties in the uk every
12:46
year about
12:47
808 million apparently the average bag
12:51
is worth seven pound
12:52
fifty which i think means there's a
12:53
hundred and seven million party bags
12:56
uh which means every child um it's 30
12:59
each so it goes to 30 parties
13:01
every year yeah i did not know
13:04
30 people when i was seven certainly not
13:07
that he would have had me too
13:11
and apparently two percent of of a
13:13
thousand parents surveyed in one survey
13:15
said that their child had received an
13:17
ipod in a party bag
13:20
wow no well who are they serving
13:23
people in chelsea mansions
13:26
um i read a news article an american
13:28
news article a mother called sherry
13:30
jameson
13:31
who was left speechless when she had a
13:34
birthday party for her son
13:35
her six-year-old son and guest took back
13:39
the birthday gifts they'd given him when
13:40
they found out there were going to be no
13:42
party bags
13:43
um the article reported about a
13:45
partygoer who asked to remain anonymous
13:47
saying a lot of us feel cheated the kids
13:50
had fun
13:51
but it was a really bare bones event
13:52
it's not like she had a bouncy castle
13:55
and she's since received emails and
13:57
texts from guests who felt it would be
13:58
in poor taste to take their gift back at
14:00
the party
14:00
but who are now getting in touch to
14:02
demand to be refunded the full price
14:03
including tax of their present
14:05
including taxes
14:11
um let's let's move on to our next fact
14:13
so we don't run out of time
14:14
uh so it's time for fact number three
14:17
and that is my fact
14:19
my fact this week is that ernest
14:21
hemingway once stole
14:22
a urinal from a bar saying that he
14:24
pissed away
14:25
so much of his money into it that he
14:27
owned it
14:32
i can tell you from experience that very
14:34
rarely works on landlords
14:38
do you piss on all your furniture
14:43
yeah so uh this was a bar that he used
14:45
to go to all the time
14:47
and uh it was moving it was closing down
14:49
and so he just went in and he just took
14:51
the urinal off and he
14:53
he brought it back to his house and uh
14:56
james you've
14:56
i know you've been to earth i have been
14:59
there and the urinal is still there
15:00
really yep it's still there you can see
15:02
it and you when you go to ernest
15:03
hemingway's house in key west they make
15:05
you go on a tour around there
15:07
and that's one of the things they tell
15:08
you that this is the this is the story
15:10
his urinals now in the garden i think
15:11
yeah that's right it's in the back
15:12
garden and it's been turned into like a
15:14
fountain or
15:15
it's a yeah it's a nice centerpiece i
15:17
think it's quite a nice urinal actually
15:19
if my memory serves it's quite big and
15:21
kind of
15:21
made of big stone and it's kind of got
15:24
flowers on it and stuff i think it's
15:25
quite nice wow
15:26
definitely how did he get it out of the
15:28
bar
15:30
because i wouldn't know where to begin
15:31
taking your rhino off the ball
15:33
he was a big manly man though andy and
15:36
you know you're um
15:41
you've made yourself very plain he was a
15:44
big guy though you're right he
15:45
he was uh he was obsessed with boxing he
15:47
used to take on people half his age
15:49
saying and and probably you know same
15:51
size as him but
15:52
they soon being younger they could take
15:54
him out and he would he would he had his
15:55
own boxing ring in the back garden
15:57
it was next to where the urinal now is
16:00
and um he went off to the spanish civil
16:02
war to act as a correspondent
16:04
and while he was there he had an affair
16:06
with another woman and his
16:08
wife wasn't very happy about that so she
16:09
sold his boxing ring
16:11
and bought a swimming pool and that
16:13
swimming pool cost
16:14
twenty thousand dollars in those days
16:16
which now is hundreds and hundreds of
16:18
thousands
16:18
and when he came back he had one penny
16:21
in his pocket and he
16:22
said you've taken everything i've got
16:23
have this last penny and he threw it
16:25
down and it's still there under a bit of
16:26
glass and you can see it if you visit
16:28
oh good we've preserved the remnants of
16:30
his childish spoiled brat tantrums
16:34
forever
16:36
um just on his manliness yeah he i love
16:38
this image
16:39
he wrote standing up always
16:42
he wrote he would write in a pencil he
16:44
wouldn't be wearing a shirt so he
16:46
had his shirt off wore baggy shorts and
16:48
they were held up by
16:50
a leather belt that he taken off the
16:52
body of a dead german soldier
16:54
that was inscribed with the german the
16:57
third reich
16:58
kind of uh insignia that's cool isn't it
17:01
a half naked man with a third reich belt
17:04
standing up and writing
17:05
some novels i think we know your type
17:11
just on the pub fights thing i read that
17:12
he went out drinking with james joyce
17:14
and that james joyce
17:15
would get into fights and then say
17:17
hemingway deal with this
17:20
because he was too drunk that joyce was
17:21
too drunk to stand this is according to
17:23
hemingway
17:25
i have a fact about ernest hemingway
17:26
which is that hemingway was part
17:30
kangaroo
17:35
no he was he was part kangaroo come on
17:38
he broke his arm in a car accident
17:40
and the surgeon tending him bound his
17:42
bone together inside his body with
17:44
kangaroo tendon wow yeah and this was a
17:47
i mean that kind of that wasn't an
17:48
innovation just for hemingway it was
17:50
that was a
17:51
at some point a standard medical
17:53
procedure to put a bit of kangaroo
17:55
inside you that's so cool
17:56
it feels like the tendons would be kind
17:57
of stretchier doesn't it i'm bouncier
17:59
yeah i wonder if that might be why they
18:01
used it yeah
18:01
i mean i don't know but anyway it's not
18:03
like all bits of a kangaroo are bouncy
18:07
[Laughter]
18:09
rubber do you know when he was a young
18:11
boy ernest hemingway when he was a young
18:13
boy his
18:13
mother used to dress him up as a girl
18:15
because she didn't want a boy she wanted
18:16
a girl and so she used to dress him up
18:18
as girl and call him
18:19
ernestine that backfired very badly
18:22
didn't it
18:24
it really did but it was up until like
18:25
he was six years old he was he was going
18:27
around
18:28
she grew his hair long she uh and he had
18:30
to pretend to be the twin sister of his
18:32
older sister
18:33
wow yeah they're a pretty weird family i
18:35
read he didn't like his name he didn't
18:37
like being called earnest because it was
18:38
like
18:38
um the hero of an importance of being
18:40
earnest by oscar wilde
18:42
oh really and he was he was upset about
18:44
that but that was why he objected
18:46
because he thought
18:46
he thought oscar was effeminate and
18:49
therefore that he shouldn't be called
18:50
earnest
18:51
he you had huge problems about wanting
18:53
to be incredibly masculine and sort of
18:55
hyper masculine yeah he's a really
18:57
seriously odd guy
18:59
he was also honestly go home and spend
19:01
two hours researching
19:02
ernest hemingway because you think as i
19:04
was saying to james yesterday as you're
19:05
reading about him you think
19:07
i have not lived this man has lived
19:10
and in so many ways one of the ways was
19:13
that he was incredibly accident prone it
19:15
seemed so he had this whole kangaroo
19:16
malarkey in his arm
19:18
he had a plane crash in 1954 so he was
19:22
on safari with his wife he was in uganda
19:24
um and his plane crashed uh had to crash
19:26
land and they had to choose whether to
19:28
crash land on an elephant trail or in a
19:30
big crocodile pit
19:31
so those are the only options there
19:34
wasn't even a tiny strip of land in
19:36
between the elephant trail and the
19:37
crocodile
19:39
what are the odds what did they pick um
19:42
they picked the elephant trail in the
19:44
elephant trail then he his wife and the
19:46
pilot of the plane
19:47
had to sleep there overnight because
19:48
they were surrounded by elephants
19:50
blocked in by these elephants
19:52
so they were both quite badly injured
19:53
and the next day they were rescued by
19:55
another plane so they boarded this other
19:56
plane uh which caught fire
20:00
and also crashed the following day where
20:02
did that crash into like
20:03
do you want to go to the snake pits or
20:05
the wildebeest
20:07
sanctuary
20:10
i would pick the wildebeest sanctuary
20:13
they'll be calm by being looked after
20:17
maybe we could adopt one
20:22
comes after wildebeest for that joke to
20:23
make sense
20:26
what about the hyena lair
20:27
[Laughter]
20:30
actually hyenas are quite nice guys
20:34
i actually read a thing about wilder
20:35
beast the other day and i was going to
20:37
try and use for a main fact
20:38
um the scientists are saying that they
20:40
were looking at ancient wilder beasts
20:43
and apparently ancient wilder beasts um
20:45
they evolved
20:46
a trunk like a longish trunk so that
20:49
they could gossip with each other
20:52
yeah because they needed to tell each
20:53
other like you see jeff over there like
20:55
they needed to
20:56
do tiny little what it's a gossip and
20:59
they couldn't do it with their normal
21:00
wildebeest face
21:01
what i i feel like you're paraphrasing
21:04
studies
21:06
that's what it said it said gossiping do
21:08
you know where hemingway's biggest scar
21:10
came from so he had this big scar on his
21:12
forehead it was the most prominent thing
21:13
you'd notice about him in his later life
21:15
and it didn't
21:16
come from the car crash or from the two
21:18
plane crashes or from the motorbike
21:19
accident he had when he was in germany
21:21
all the wars that he was kind of in any
21:23
of the wars he covered it came from a
21:25
time
21:25
he was in a bathroom and he pulled a
21:27
chain thinking it was the toilet flush
21:29
and it accidentally brought the whole
21:30
skylight down on his head
21:33
and that's what gave him this massive
21:34
scar and whenever anyone asked him about
21:36
it he was really reluctant to say
21:38
it's from a toilet skyline so the two
21:40
plane crashes
21:41
uh there was an interesting thing that
21:43
actually happened in the time between
21:45
the first plane crash and the second
21:46
plane crash
21:47
which was he and his wife were reported
21:49
dead
21:50
and it got spread around the world and
21:52
obituaries were printed the next day
21:54
and so he had the rare thing of being
21:56
able to genuinely see the obituaries to
21:58
his life
21:59
and then the next day he got on a plane
22:01
and then that crashed again and that led
22:02
to severe trauma which
22:04
uh his best friends think is what led to
22:06
the end of his life for him killing
22:08
himself from that
22:09
second plane crash i think it just
22:10
ruined the rest of his life um but again
22:12
you know you're saying just what an
22:13
insane character what a big life
22:15
he during world war ii was hunting nazis
22:19
despite not being enlisted into world
22:21
war ii
22:22
and he did it from his boat and his boat
22:25
was set up it was a fishing boat
22:27
it had direction finding equipment it
22:29
had a machine gun
22:31
it had grenades and he went out hunting
22:33
nazi u-boats he used to practice
22:35
with his son trying to take down u-boats
22:38
with grenades by throwing them at
22:39
turtles
22:43
i think that was very unfair on the
22:44
turtles
22:47
been playing their nazis and b a u-boat
22:49
is a lot tougher than a turtle
22:52
but that's what he did okay we need to
22:54
move on to the final fact very shortly
22:56
anything before we do
22:57
uh just quickly he had 52 cats
23:01
and he taught one of them um so this is
23:04
his exact words
23:05
i i have taught uncle wolfer dillinger
23:07
and will
23:08
to make a pyramid like lions and
23:11
sorry what well i think he told his cats
23:14
to make a human pyramid i'm not sure
23:16
but like lions do you
23:21
yeah um and then he said and have taught
23:24
friendless that was the name of another
23:25
of his cats
23:27
have taught friendless to drink with me
23:29
brackets
23:30
whiskey and milk but even that doesn't
23:33
take the place of a wife and family
23:40
okay it is time for our final fact of
23:43
the night and that is
23:44
schezinski yeah my fact is that
23:47
the official medical diagnosis code for
23:49
being struck
23:50
by a chicken is different to the
23:52
official medical diagnosis code for
23:54
being pecked by a chicken
23:56
and this is uh the so this is the
23:59
international classification of diseases
24:01
the icd
24:02
and every thing that could go wrong with
24:04
you has an icd code
24:05
so it's now enormous and every possible
24:07
injury that's ever been reported has
24:09
this code
24:10
so yeah there are codes for being pecked
24:11
by a chicken and struck by a chicken
24:13
completely different codes there's a
24:15
there was one new one added
24:17
in the 70s or just bitten by an orca
24:21
there's contact with non-venomous frogs
24:25
sucked into a jet engine
24:28
and injuries cools while knitting and
24:30
crocheting so all of those things
24:32
if you go to a doctor or an er then
24:34
they'll write down they'll say
24:35
you'll say oh my knitting needle just
24:37
jammed into my thigh and then a
24:39
non-venomous frog landed on it and
24:41
they'd say oh there are two codes for
24:42
that hold on and write them down and
24:44
then
24:45
they've you know they've reported it
24:46
what is the code for was pulling on
24:49
what i thought was toilet chain
24:52
it turned out to be skylight
24:55
there would definitely be one for that
24:57
yeah there is a there is one for falloff
24:59
toilet
25:00
that's um w18.1 okay just to let you
25:03
know that
25:04
um a few others just because it's a 1593
25:08
page pdf and i read through the whole
25:10
thing
25:13
um fall from a non-moving non-motorized
25:16
scooter
25:17
is w05 um
25:20
fall into buckets of water
25:24
not trip over bucket of water but fall
25:26
into
25:28
water that's w1622
25:31
and s 30.862 is insect bite on penis
25:39
that's amazing long list reading
25:43
this is my favorite one uh v91.07
25:47
burn due to water skis on fire
25:56
don't smoke and water scheme can you see
25:58
the signs
26:00
i was reading an interview with um
26:02
someone so there's a brilliant article
26:04
in the new yorker about this and
26:05
they interviewed someone who's involved
26:07
in deciding the new classifications
26:08
because they quite recently upgraded it
26:10
and expanded them and it sounds quite
26:12
frustrating she said you're in this
26:14
meeting room and you're debating all the
26:15
things that could possibly happen as
26:16
well and asking if you should also have
26:18
codes for them
26:19
and so she was saying a question was
26:21
raised on what codes would apply
26:22
if a mother was given the wrong baby to
26:24
breastfeed
26:27
it was stated that that would be outside
26:28
the scope of icd coding
26:30
so they do have some limits i read a
26:32
thing about breastfeeding just this
26:34
morning
26:34
which is that in the 19th century in
26:37
america if
26:38
you had what's called a galactica which
26:40
means you can't produce milk for your
26:42
baby
26:42
the way that they would treat it is to
26:44
put a pancake on your breasts
26:48
there's a milk substitute it's got milk
26:51
in it isn't it
26:52
yeah it's true i don't know what they
26:53
thought it would do but you would put a
26:55
warm pancake on the breast and then when
26:56
it got cold you put another warm one on
26:58
and keep doing that for a couple of
26:59
hours and then
27:00
what would they do with all the cooled
27:02
breast pancakes
27:06
just make some new pancakes
27:09
that's very wasteful yeah you could give
27:12
them to
27:13
perverts
27:18
just three pounds we'll buy four
27:20
pancakes for a pervert
27:22
[Laughter]
27:25
i was reading about the fact that not
27:27
only do they have these codes that they
27:29
can write for proper medical use but
27:30
they actually there's a lot of medical
27:32
slang
27:33
that gets used which um patients
27:36
because doctors are telling people at
27:38
home they're putting it on the internet
27:40
people are wising up to the fact that
27:41
they use this kind of slang so like for
27:43
example one pfo
27:45
pissed fell over that's what they'll put
27:47
on the on the paper as a thing
27:49
um they'll put uh brothel sprouts uh
27:52
which is genital warts i really like
27:54
that one
27:55
[Music]
27:56
brothel sprouts very clever yeah uh but
27:59
yeah what i was reading about the fact
28:00
that the uh some doctor board now needs
28:03
to
28:03
tell doctors not to do this anymore so
28:06
they sent out a mass email
28:07
and different hospitals are doing this
28:09
it's really funny the fact that
28:10
when they say this is a quote from it
28:12
although acknowledging that slang is
28:14
likely to continue to be used it should
28:15
be kept to a minimum
28:17
so they're like well we know you're
28:19
going to do it anyway so
28:21
yeah but it's yeah there's a whole prep
28:23
fo patient reassured and told to
28:28
off
28:31
i have read um articles like that and
28:33
some some doctors go on there and
28:35
comment and say no we don't do this at
28:37
all
28:37
but then others go yeah we do really
28:39
i've got two close friends with doctors
28:41
and both of them say they do it all the
28:42
time
28:44
i was reading a thing about uh bills of
28:46
mortality which were these
28:48
they were these lists that got published
28:50
in the 16th and 17th centuries and it
28:52
was a record of how people died
28:54
basically in your
28:55
parish for example and every week the
28:57
parish clerks would record who had died
28:59
in the parish and how they died
29:01
um but they weren't medically trained
29:03
obviously because they were clerks so a
29:04
lot of the
29:05
causes of death are really uh they're
29:07
quite
29:08
vague so they include things like um
29:12
this is for how they died um griping in
29:14
the guts
29:15
we don't know stopping of the stomach
29:18
again
29:19
and suddenly
29:21
[Laughter]
29:25
um another this is my favorite from the
29:28
bills of mortality that i managed to
29:30
read
29:30
was cancer and wolf
29:33
[Laughter]
29:37
sometimes you can't know what got them
29:39
first
29:41
another one just said planet killed by a
29:44
planet
29:49
um guys we need to wrap up fairly soon
29:52
so if you've got any more
29:54
i gotta think very quickly on chickens
29:56
which is so this fact was about the
29:58
medical code for chicken and it just
29:59
reminded me that i was reading about a
30:01
there's a um
30:02
there's an australian fast food chain
30:04
called chicken treat uh who currently
30:06
have a chicken doing all of their tweets
30:09
so so it basically it's in its cage they
30:12
put a computer in there and they've put
30:13
the food onto the keyboard
30:15
and so um the chicken packs the keyboard
30:19
for the food
30:20
and it starts typing stuff out and um
30:22
guinness world records
30:23
have said that if it manages to type a
30:26
five letter word
30:28
and it's a successfully it's a it reads
30:30
as a word then it's going to go into the
30:31
guinness world records as the first
30:32
non-human to tweet
30:34
so far it's only managed three letters
30:37
um
30:38
what was the word that it tweeted
30:40
[Laughter]
30:43
[Music]
30:45
anything more before we uh before we
30:47
wrap up why can you ask us to follow a
30:49
chicken tweeting the word
30:54

30:57

hello
00:14
and welcome to another episode of no
00:16
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:19
this week coming to you live from
00:21
bristol my name is dan shriver and
00:23
please welcome to the stage it's anna
00:24
chazinski andy murray and james harkin
00:33
and once again we have gathered around
00:36
the microphones with our four
00:37
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:39
and in no particular order
00:41
here we go starting with me my fact my
00:44
fact this week
00:45
is that the frog whose latin name means
00:48
blue frog
00:49
is actually green this is uh
00:52
this is it's very it's very exciting
00:54
this is the australian green frog
00:56
and basically when it was sent from
00:57
australia to england
00:59
for scientific purposes because of the
01:01
uh preservatives and so on inside the
01:03
glass that it was kept and it turned it
01:04
blue
01:05
so they named it blue frog and then it
01:08
was not until they saw a living one that
01:09
they realized oh actually this thing's
01:11
green but it is still
01:12
its latin name is still blue frog oh
01:15
that's good yeah is it not some idea
01:17
that it might
01:17
hurt it might always turn blue when it
01:19
dies i think that it is true
01:22
and because there was a study done
01:23
wasn't there last year and it was about
01:25
how uh
01:26
certain animals make themselves look
01:27
certain colors when they don't have the
01:28
right pigments and i think we're looking
01:29
at birds
01:30
and the shape of their feathers and how
01:32
it's actually often about uh the shape
01:34
of it the structure of something and
01:35
then how it makes the light
01:36
reflect off it without using pigments
01:38
and it said that the that's why the
01:40
australian green frog turns blue after
01:42
death
01:42
is because i think the shape of it kind
01:44
of changes and it gets floppy once it
01:45
dies
01:46
it could also be that all these
01:47
scientists are color blind
01:50
to me it's kind of like a computer game
01:52
where it's game over
01:53
just the frog suddenly just living as
01:55
green just
01:58
and it's blue it's just a really good
01:59
way of letting you know that
02:01
okay that's a that's a dead green frog
02:05
did you not think because frogs okay i
02:07
was reading about other frogs uh this is
02:09
not necessarily the australian green
02:10
frog
02:11
um but i was i went on a website about
02:13
frogs uh
02:14
and i went to the uh a section of it
02:16
called frog quintly asked questions
02:20
labored very labored and they wanted to
02:23
know about um
02:24
how much sleep uh frogs get and the
02:26
reply on the website
02:28
was that frogs and toads will sit very
02:30
still with their eyes closed
02:31
the assumption is that they are asleep
02:33
but it is not clear how long
02:35
they sleep per day so we don't know
02:38
they'll just sit looking like they're
02:40
asleep and we
02:41
they might just be hanging out but they
02:43
deny it they deny it afterwards
02:44
i wasn't asleep they're very much like
02:46
dads in that respect
02:50
um so i found out about a frog which
02:51
changes color called the more
02:53
frog and it's brown but during the
02:55
mating season all the males turn
02:57
blue it's so that they they can tell
03:00
which ones are males and which ones are
03:01
females because the males are very
03:02
enthusiastic and they will just get
03:03
mounting
03:04
um any frog which looks uh different to
03:07
them so they think it's evolved because
03:09
they're so
03:09
stupid they can't tell whether that well
03:12
could you tell
03:13
calling them stupid what would you know
03:15
if you saw two brown frogs exclusively
03:18
with brown frogs
03:20
i'm more excited about the term you use
03:22
get mounting
03:24
that's an insight into your private life
03:26
there
03:29
there's a tortoise that turns red as
03:31
it's having sex
03:32
isn't there yeah which kind of humans do
03:35
as well
03:36
i can't in my experience
03:40
i think it turns redder i just think
03:42
again very useful because you're like
03:43
i'm just going over to see barry barry
03:45
okay how close do you usually get to
03:49
people before going are you guys having
03:51
you are having sex okay if you can put a
03:54
flag up or something next time
03:58
jesus wow but that is that's that's
04:01
that's cool it's really cool it's uh
04:04
it's
04:04
sorry did i say it was a tortoise that's
04:07
cool um
04:08
it's the golden tortoise beetle um and
04:10
it turns out having sex and it's
04:14
you can see where i had trouble there um
04:17
yeah
04:17
sexual signaling apparently but i would
04:19
have thought it turns weird as it's
04:20
having sex and apparently it turns red
04:21
to say i am ready to mate now but i
04:23
would have thought by the time you've
04:25
you're doing that you don't really need
04:26
the signaling anymore so there's a frog
04:28
as well that is red
04:30
and it's often called the tomato frog um
04:33
literally its color is meant to warn
04:34
predators that it's not safe to eat
04:36
because it is quite toxic but there are
04:38
lots of frogs aren't those little
04:39
tiny amazonian folks the very very
04:42
brightly colored yellow and blue ones
04:43
they're really toxic
04:45
right yeah yeah loads of frozen toxic
04:47
and so there's one that ezra frog
04:49
when it's young it's black with bright
04:51
yellow spots and it does look poisonous
04:53
that's something we recognize being
04:54
poisonous but when it gets older it
04:55
completely transforms and look it up
04:57
it's amazing it transforms into this
04:59
lovely kind of translucent orangey peach
05:01
color with these big green eyes
05:03
and so it doesn't look toxic anymore but
05:05
if i i would want all
05:06
predators to think i was toxic
05:08
throughout my life it's kind of like
05:09
saying
05:10
you can handle yourself now because what
05:11
if no one wants to hang out with you
05:12
anymore because you look scary you might
05:14
have other sprog species friends you
05:15
want to chill out with and they're just
05:16
like
05:17
you don't want the toxic lad over here
05:19
okay good point
05:20
yeah well you
05:23
and i think you say it as a reflex
05:27
okay green tree frogs yeah they're an
05:29
interesting species
05:31
and they respond to sounds of other
05:33
green tree frogs um
05:34
coals so the males respond to the female
05:36
calls but they'll also respond to other
05:38
things that sound a bit like the females
05:40
so they found that they would respond to
05:42
a washing machine
05:43
a popcorn popper a dog lapping water
05:47
cannon fire in a civil war movie
05:52
and scott joplin ragtime music
05:55
and they think that's all a female going
05:57
yeah i'm ready to have sex
05:59
the most optimistic of all the species
06:02
the sound of a cannon firing
06:06
either ulysses s grant has just won
06:07
another battle or i'm about to get lucky
06:11
let's get mounting
06:15
um do you know something really cool
06:16
that frogs can do which they've just
06:18
found out
06:19
they can urinate out anything that's
06:22
stuck in their body
06:23
so um this was so this was originally
06:26
found out because a scientist
06:28
planted little radio transmitters under
06:29
their skin because they wanted to track
06:31
frogs and uh they realized that they'd
06:34
all like
06:34
they went to find the radio transmitters
06:35
and they disappeared they couldn't track
06:37
the frogs anymore
06:38
and it turned out that is because uh
06:40
they can slowly transport foreign
06:42
objects
06:42
anywhere in their body into their
06:44
bladder and then get rid of them so if
06:45
they're stabbed or something
06:47
uh splinter splinter yeah
06:50
actually starfish do that as well i
06:52
think something in the back of my head
06:53
says that when they get something stuck
06:54
inside them they can force it out to the
06:56
end of their legs and they can
06:58
kind of pull it out there it's
07:00
impressive there's an octopus that can
07:02
uh it's called the mimic
07:03
octopus for a reason that will become
07:05
obvious if you keep listening
07:06
uh that uh can change their color but
07:09
can also change their shape and they can
07:10
mimic 15 different species
07:12
so they can change their shape by
07:13
morphing themselves into the shape of
07:15
sea snakes
07:16
lionfish flatfish starfish giant crabs
07:19
seashells stingrays
07:20
flounders jellyfish anemones mantis
07:23
shrimps they can disguise themselves as
07:24
all of these creatures but not even so
07:26
not even to the shape
07:28
and the color but they can change the
07:30
texture of their skin
07:31
to match the texture of the thing
07:33
they're mimicking so if they're
07:34
mimicking
07:35
seaweed their body literally turns into
07:37
there's an amazing video go on youtube
07:39
put in octopus
07:40
camouflage uh maybe seaweed and it's
07:44
insane very cool where is octopus man as
07:46
a superhero that is the best superhero
07:48
doctor octopus
07:50
[Laughter]
07:55
we need to move on to our next fact uh
07:57
does anyone have anything before we do
07:59
people can turn blue
08:02
uh prove it
08:07
uh no i think it's very rare but some
08:10
people have a
08:11
bad reaction to a colloidal silver which
08:13
comes in i think like health drinks and
08:15
tonic drinks and
08:16
there's a guy i think he died a couple
08:18
of years ago but not from this just
08:19
because he was getting older
08:20
um but he was perfectly healthy except
08:23
he's completely blue from
08:27
is that the one you're talking about oh
08:28
no i think different guy oh well there
08:29
was an american politician who thought
08:31
the colloidal silver which is
08:33
it's like a drink with silver inside it
08:35
or something like that and he thought it
08:36
would kind of solve every problem that
08:38
he had
08:38
and it kind of did apart from that he
08:40
turned blue um wow
08:42
was he republican or democrat because
08:48
and also there was a family in i'm gonna
08:50
say they're in kentucky but they were
08:51
certainly around there somewhere and
08:52
they all turned blue but that was a
08:54
genetic thing
08:55
wow and they were called the blue few
08:56
gates and they were quite famous in
08:58
america all the smurfs to their
08:59
neighbors
09:01
should we move on to our next fact i
09:02
think we should okay it is time for fact
09:05
number two
09:06
and that is chazinski uh yes
09:09
my fact is that you can surf on
09:11
mushrooms
09:13
this is true yeah what do you mean by
09:15
that as in
09:16
you're on a surfboard and there's lots
09:18
of mushrooms there and you're going
09:19
along on the surface
09:20
well you've and you think you're surfing
09:22
[Laughter]
09:25
okay that can happen but this is no time
09:27
for personal anecdotes
09:28
um no this is so
09:31
cool um so it's that there's this
09:33
company called um
09:35
it's a covetive and so the pronunciation
09:38
is quite difficult it's spelled e
09:39
covetive and they say it's the same as a
09:41
pronunciation of innovative
09:42
so it's e-covative and they've realized
09:45
that mycelium which are these kind of
09:46
threads at the bottom of mushrooms uh
09:48
and their fungus are like they act like
09:52
glue
09:52
and then they can expand it to make a
09:55
kind of foamy substance which can make a
09:57
really good surfboard or in fact
09:58
loads of other substances and they have
10:00
been quoted as saying mushrooms are the
10:02
new plastic
10:03
and i believe them wow yeah it's
10:06
really cool i think you boil it up don't
10:08
you and then they become kind of a
10:09
stretchy substance
10:10
yeah but for hundreds of years they've
10:12
been making hats in
10:13
transylvania out of mushrooms in this
10:16
way no way it sounds made up doesn't it
10:18
it sounds made up it really does but
10:20
it's genuinely
10:20
everyone in transylvania is wearing a
10:22
mushroom on their head
10:23
is it no it is they're like little pif
10:26
helmets but they're made out of
10:27
mushrooms
10:29
but i signed when i started looking into
10:31
this scientists are saying that we are
10:33
entering the age of the fungus
10:35
they really think that it's gonna take
10:37
over with um they're gonna our cars are
10:39
gonna be made of mushrooms
10:40
our um insulation now
10:44
like in
10:45
[Laughter]
10:49
yeah insulation this company makes
10:51
insulation insulation so they put
10:53
mushrooms into your walls now they
10:55
really think that mushrooms are now
10:56
going to be used in a way that we never
10:57
realized that they could be used
10:59
that is absolutely disgusting well so
11:01
james has a phobia against mushrooms
11:03
um because they grow on dead things and
11:05
they reproduce with spores and they're
11:06
just horrible
11:07
right and if you guys are going to make
11:09
a world out of them i don't want to be
11:10
in that world
11:12
well okay good luck on the mars program
11:17
actually that is a thing isn't it though
11:19
i was reading an interview with a guy
11:21
who's obsessed with mushrooms who's like
11:22
my
11:23
like my nemesis and he reckons that when
11:26
humans go to other planets that they
11:29
will be kind of
11:30
taking mushrooms there to terraform it
11:32
because they can make
11:33
soil yeah because so millions
11:36
i mean many many millions of years ago
11:38
the earth was much more mushroom heavy
11:40
than it was now i think it was before
11:42
the tree had evolved
11:43
before vegetating plants and flowers and
11:46
things like that had evolved
11:47
so there were lots of very very tall
11:49
they think up to 24 foot high
11:51
mushrooms and they some reason was it
11:54
the mycelia they got in they can
11:56
sort of break down rocks and they make
11:58
soil
11:59
yeah so it's thanks to mushrooms james
12:01
that you've got your vegetables which
12:02
are
12:03
not mushrooms also i reckon you'll like
12:05
this because you like coffee right
12:07
oh yeah mushrooms like coffee okay
12:13
it's not exactly match.com
12:15
[Laughter]
12:18
there's a problem with soil at the
12:20
moment we're depleting the soil much
12:21
much faster than we're replenishing it
12:23
and
12:23
it's genuinely along with uh global
12:25
warming uh scientists are saying it's
12:26
like the main
12:27
environmental threat to us and so
12:29
there's these companies decide instead
12:31
of feeding soil to mushrooms feed coffee
12:32
to them
12:33
and so they're planting mushrooms in it
12:34
and they grow really fast and they love
12:36
it
12:36
i found a mushroom which is a bright
12:39
orange hawaiian one which they
12:41
tested in 2001 and it was found to
12:43
trigger orgasms
12:44
in women and then okay that's one thing
12:46
we don't have in common
12:52
[Applause]
12:58
um but sadly it was a very small study
13:01
and they think it probably doesn't
13:02
trigger spontaneous orgasms of women so
13:04
there you go
13:08
it was reported in a lot of newspapers
13:10
but it seems to be
13:12
sadly untrue it has a fetid odor
13:15
so there you go
13:20
it's looking more and more meant to be
13:23
um can i take it to surfing for a bit
13:26
yes please
13:26
i was looking into famous surfers uh
13:29
okay
13:30
because uh we've spoken about the fact
13:32
that agatha christie before
13:33
was a surfer um very famously one of the
13:36
first surfers in england
13:38
uh and also uh so mark twain surfed
13:42
did he yeah he wasn't he wasn't a
13:44
professional um
13:45
but he did try a few times which was
13:47
really exciting um and
13:48
and he really enjoyed it uh barack obama
13:51
uh
13:51
in 2008 went surfing in hawaii where the
13:54
mushroom
13:55
he's uh he's from hawaii no yes exactly
13:58
so he went back and he went surfing and
13:59
he went surfing on a beach called sandy
14:01
beach park
14:02
and it was such an event to have him
14:03
surfing although i think it turns out he
14:05
was just body surfing so without the
14:06
board
14:08
but they decided that they wanted to
14:09
rename the beach after barack obama so
14:12
they were changing it from
14:13
sandy beach park to president barack
14:16
obama
14:17
sandy beach park
14:18
[Laughter]
14:20
we can't lose the sandy this is such a
14:22
good name and uh but there's too much
14:24
controversy so they ended up not giving
14:26
it to the president
14:28
would you say you think his main regret
14:30
over the whole course of his tenure
14:32
is that that beach was never named after
14:34
him yeah number two guantanamo
14:37
there is he wants that name
14:40
i found a study about surfing which is
14:44
looking into surfers rectums literally
14:49
looking into them there's a study about
14:51
antibiotic resistant bacteria
14:53
and surfers are being asked to volunteer
14:55
rectal swabs
14:56
because they swallow a lot of
15:00
water when they go surfing and the the
15:03
water that is around the coast might
15:05
have antibiotic resistant bacteria in it
15:07
we need to study the effects of these
15:09
bacteria if we're going to
15:10
defeat them and get you know better
15:12
antibiotics which work
15:14
so the project is called beach bums
15:19
feels a lot like the name happened and
15:21
then they have to
15:23
back for me a reason
15:29
send us oh so it's not like they're
15:30
waiting at the shore
15:32
it brings a new meaning to the word
15:34
wipeout doesn't it
15:40
that's incredible yeah you know the uh
15:43
barring one none of the beach boys ever
15:46
surfed
15:46
yeah famously famously they hated so
15:49
brian wilson was actually petrified of
15:51
water they actually uh i can't remember
15:53
there were two musicians who'd forced
15:54
brian wilson to surf once because i
15:56
think it was like everyone used to take
15:57
the piss out of them quite a lot because
15:58
i think it was quite a known thing
16:00
everyone's like you know
16:01
most of your songs are about surfing and
16:02
none of you surf um it was saturday
16:04
night
16:04
harrison no no it was saturday night
16:06
live and i believe it was dan aykroyd
16:08
and john belushi
16:09
yeah they got him to surf and you've
16:11
just basically you're watching a man
16:12
on a beach petrified of water and it was
16:15
on television
16:16
and it was on television yeah don't know
16:18
what the words they swapped his anus
16:21
serving us anus
16:27
[Applause]
16:30
all right we need to move on to our next
16:31
fact um okay it is time for fact number
16:34
three
16:35
and that is andrew hunter murray my fact
16:38
is that if you're allergic to cats
16:40
you're also allergic to lions
16:43
you might you might think that
16:44
everyone's allergic to lions yeah you're
16:46
not watching an approaching lion going
16:48
oh i'm gonna get a cold off the back of
16:49
this so that's my inhaler where's my
16:51
inhaler
16:53
so the the main thing that causes it is
16:55
a thing called dander
16:56
so it's these tiny cells made of hair or
16:59
fur or feathers and it's the things that
17:01
um
17:01
animals give off and humans have dander
17:03
as well i think that must be related to
17:05
the word
17:05
it is dandruff it's the same thing i
17:06
think okay so it's it's a bit
17:08
complicated but basically the dander
17:10
contains this particular protein called
17:13
fel
17:13
d1 and cats have it in their skin and in
17:16
the saliva
17:17
and when they groom it goes it gets
17:19
airborne basically and if you're
17:21
sensitive to it then you have an
17:23
allergic reaction and so
17:24
obviously there haven't been many
17:26
studies on testing
17:28
allergic reactions to big cats but there
17:29
was one in 1990 which tested
17:31
eight different species uh tigers lions
17:34
snow leopards that kind of thing and
17:35
found there was a link in general
17:37
you know sometimes it's weaker sometimes
17:39
stronger but yeah wow
17:41
amazing people have been scientists have
17:43
been making some wild assertions
17:44
lately about there was a study done at
17:47
the university of edinburgh i think
17:49
with the bronx zoo which compared the
17:51
personalities of house cats to the
17:53
personalities of big cats
17:55
and they tested them on extroversion
17:58
agreeableness conscientiousness
18:00
neuroticism
18:01
and openness um and
18:04
i don't know how they test their
18:05
questionnaires were sent out or whatever
18:08
um and they found out that they had the
18:09
same inclinations
18:11
uh domestic cats as big cats so they
18:13
were they had high inclinations towards
18:14
dominance impulsiveness and neuroticism
18:17
which then a lot of a lot of articles
18:19
reporting about this said
18:20
if they were bigger or you were smaller
18:22
your cats would kill you
18:23
which i don't know i think that's a leap
18:25
but yeah
18:27
your cats would kill you as what the
18:30
size of your mouse
18:31
yeah and the shape and the shape of a
18:33
mouse if you're a mouse
18:37
one of the signs that cats are not the
18:39
same as big cats and they're subservient
18:41
to us humans and i didn't realize this
18:43
is that they buried their poos so i
18:45
can't believe i've never thought about
18:46
this
18:47
the fact that cats are poo and dogs just
18:49
everywhere
18:50
uh is that's their way of saying so a
18:52
big cat will not bury its poo
18:54
and that's it marking its territory and
18:56
that's it saying don't come near this
18:57
this is mine
18:58
and a sign of submissiveness in small
19:00
cats is burying their poo
19:01
and so saying it's okay i'm not marking
19:03
this territory you don't need to smell
19:04
this this is all yours
19:05
and so they're saying to you the owner i
19:07
buried my poo you can have this house
19:09
i'm not taking your birthday so you know
19:11
that dogs could be allergic to cats
19:14
can be allergic to cat dander wow and
19:16
cats and dogs can both be allergic to
19:18
humans can't they
19:19
yes yeah yeah piers morgan is allergic
19:22
to meerkats
19:29
i read it i was looking at people who
19:31
were allergic to things and it came up
19:33
on
19:33
uh and piers morgan sent a tweet uh
19:38
where he was
19:38
linking to like a really important thing
19:40
about people who suffer from meerkat
19:42
allergy and he was like as a fellow
19:43
sufferer of meerkat allergy
19:45
and then rt and then read this link
19:48
let's all send him a meerkat
19:55
um cats and dogs used to be very good
19:57
friends
19:58
it's very strange that they've developed
19:59
this antipathy uh towards each other but
20:02
nine million years ago so in you know
20:04
the blink of an eye ago
20:06
uh to some of us just one of them said
20:08
something to the other and they
20:10
never got over it how old we know this
20:13
because uh
20:13
so we've got because of archaeology so
20:15
we've got forces of nine million years
20:16
ago
20:17
of the saber-toothed cats and bear dogs
20:20
which are a combination of bears
20:21
and dogs so they've looked at what they
20:24
would eat and they've looked at the
20:25
areas that they inhabited and it shows
20:27
that even if they inhabited the same
20:28
broad area they'd divvy it up between
20:30
them
20:30
so they wouldn't hunt animals in the
20:33
dogs area
20:34
bear dogs area and the bear dogs
20:35
wouldn't hunt animals in the sabretooth
20:36
cats area
20:37
and they just got along fine they didn't
20:39
compete at all which they used which
20:40
animals usually
20:41
friends are really scared of each other
20:43
right could be that but they're natural
20:44
predators aren't they they're not scared
20:46
of anything
20:46
okay i was so uh on the subject of
20:50
people being allergic to things i went
20:52
on to uh
20:54
i continued my search
20:58
and i went to yahoo answers um because
21:00
people often ask questions
21:02
the best site on the internet
21:05
uh this was the um the question
21:09
uh so my girlfriend is allergic to
21:11
almost every animal you'd find in a
21:13
petting zoo
21:14
if she inhales air that is around a
21:16
horse she can be hospitalized
21:18
now she loves giraffes does anyone think
21:21
she'd be allergic to them too
21:22
i was thinking of surprising her on her
21:24
birthday with a trip to the local zoo
21:26
to pet a giraffe and the reply the top
21:29
rated reply because that's how it works
21:31
on
21:31
yahoo answers the most votes for reply
21:33
if she's allergic to almost every animal
21:35
i guarantee you the zoo will contain
21:37
more than just your ass
21:41
why don't you do something less stupid
21:46
so where did you take her in the end
21:47
[Laughter]
21:55
sorry no please just on allergies i
21:58
was looking up hay fever because i
22:00
wanted to know how long it's been around
22:02
and generally allergies just haven't
22:03
they weren't reported until the late
22:05
19th century so in the 1870s food
22:08
idiosyncrasy was referred to for the
22:09
first time
22:10
which i really like and that you know
22:12
i'm idiosyncratic about certain foods
22:14
and i guess that's like wheat
22:15
intolerance or whatever
22:16
we have today that's made up um and
22:21
if you're listening to this india celiac
22:23
don't listen to anna
22:25
what you've got is real
22:29
do you know do you know just going on
22:30
celiac do you know that the first person
22:32
to realize that celiac
22:34
came from wheat was dr willie dick
22:38
and it was during it was during the war
22:40
and he found that there was a nazi
22:42
blockade against bread and everyone
22:44
started eating and potatoes and they
22:46
stopped having the problems with their
22:47
stomachs and
22:48
he realized that that was what was
22:50
causing it yeah that's amazing yeah
22:52
and yet every time he's ever referred to
22:53
it's always going to be in the context
22:54
of people laughing about his name
22:56
so life is cruel um but just on hay viva
22:59
to uh so yeah it was very late given how
23:02
prevalent it is and how widespread it is
23:04
it was only in 1819
23:06
that one doctor who had hay fever
23:08
decided to investigate what the hell was
23:09
going on
23:10
he spent nine years trying to find
23:11
fellow sufferers he only found 28 other
23:14
people in nine years who had it
23:15
so we don't know why there was obviously
23:18
much less of it
23:19
um he called it summer qatar but
23:21
eventually it sort of caught on and it
23:23
became kind of fashionable
23:24
because it was thought that it was
23:26
people of higher society who had hay
23:28
fever
23:28
and so new york heard that all these
23:30
posh british people were
23:32
hanging out with hay fever so it became
23:33
a fashionable thing to do in new york to
23:35
have hay fever and they were referred to
23:37
as hay fever rights
23:38
which became kind of a like a piss
23:40
taking oh you're trying to be posh kind
23:42
of term
23:42
um and there was a doctor who said that
23:44
um sufferers from hay fever may however
23:46
gather some crumbs of comfort from the
23:48
fact that diseases almost exclusively
23:50
to confine to persons of cultivation
23:52
hence as already hinted
23:53
our as in britain's national proclivity
23:56
to hay fever may be taken as proof of
23:58
our superiority to other races
24:02
whoa
24:07
you can be allergic to sex this is a
24:09
real thing
24:11
so they tested a thousand women who
24:13
complained of uh sort of pain or
24:14
irritation after sex and they found that
24:16
of those thousand women 13 were allergic
24:19
to their partners
24:20
at semen and there but there is a cure
24:24
which involves injecting no stomach
24:30
because it's exactly what you're
24:31
thinking
24:32
[Laughter]
24:34
so it involves injecting increasingly
24:36
high sperm samples into the vagina every
24:38
20 minutes
24:41
what every 20 30 minutes wake up
24:47
[Laughter]
24:50
but but the thing is the cure only works
24:52
if followed by frequent sexual contact
24:55
which is defined by them as two or three
24:56
times a week so there you go
24:58
we need to move on soon does anyone have
24:59
anything before we do
25:01
uh you can be allergic to euros to what
25:04
yes
25:05
you can buy allergic to euros the coins
25:06
they give off loads of nickel and they
25:08
tested it on uh
25:09
human sweat and they this is weird they
25:12
they couldn't test it on people because
25:13
it only really reacts after about 48
25:15
hours in constant contact so unless
25:17
you're constantly touching your
25:18
money um but they found that after 36
25:21
hours
25:21
uh dunked in artificial human sweat
25:25
uh that a one euro coin will visibly be
25:27
eroded but i want to know what it's made
25:29
of artificial humans
25:30
that's true i guess sultan walter or
25:32
something i'm sure yeah nickel is common
25:35
um
25:35
[Music]
25:37
yeah yeah and human sweat actually can
25:38
be allergic to exercise
25:42
it's a true thing really yeah and you're
25:44
allergic to people are allergic to their
25:45
own sweat they come in hives when they
25:46
go for a jog and
25:47
you know that's true i'm allergic to
25:49
exercise okay
25:50
and one percent of kiwis are allergic to
25:54
kiwis
25:56
so that's people from new zealand
25:57
allergic to kiwi fruits
25:59
oh sorry i thought it was the other way
26:00
around
26:01
[Laughter]
26:04
all right listen let's move on to our
26:05
final fact of the night and that
26:07
is james harkin okay my fact this week
26:10
is that it's illegal in japan
26:12
to make a human pyramid higher than five
26:15
tiers
26:17
um so this is a new law that's just come
26:19
through and there's a thing in japan
26:21
called um
26:21
kumit taizo which literally means group
26:25
body maneuver
26:26
and it's kind of thing they do in sports
26:27
days and stuff at school and
26:29
there's lots of different things they do
26:30
but one of them is a human pyramid and
26:32
apparently it's incredibly dangerous and
26:34
people always get injured with it
26:36
according to the japan sports council um
26:39
insurance payments for injuries relating
26:41
to human pyramids have been made in more
26:43
than 8 000 cases
26:45
per year since 2011. whoa
26:48
so this is a real major problem in japan
26:50
people are just getting really badly
26:52
injured from human pyramids and so
26:53
they've decided to put a stop to it
26:56
if the local politicians in india if you
26:59
get a really good
27:00
um human pyramid they give you up to two
27:02
hundred thousand dollars
27:03
as a prize yes i'm not sure if i'm being
27:06
scammed here
27:08
but again i say this guys we could do it
27:11
i should warn you that every so in the
27:13
indian one
27:13
every year a few people are killed the
27:15
articles really casually said
27:17
um and it's like a lot of children
27:18
climbing up to the top isn't it and
27:20
they've so they've cracked down a little
27:21
bit in india now um i think and they've
27:23
said people have to wear safety
27:24
harnesses above a certain height
27:26
um and the height is capped at 20 feet
27:28
and there was a quote from a participant
27:30
who's enjoyed this festival for many
27:32
decades he had
27:33
who said such rules have killed the fan
27:35
out of the whole festival
27:37
we used to just kill the participants
27:39
but now they're getting the fun
27:43
well that reminds me of the thing i
27:44
think it's in india and also in pakistan
27:46
where they did um
27:48
kite flying remember that they did kite
27:50
flying and they
27:51
would take the strings for the kites and
27:52
they put glass on them and the idea is
27:54
that you'd fly it along
27:56
and then when you're off when your
27:58
enemies kite is going near yours you try
28:00
and
28:00
slice it open and so that the kite would
28:02
fly away and you'd win the kite
28:04
it's a bit like conker's kind of sky
28:05
conquers yeah
28:07
afghanistan as well i think yeah but
28:09
they banned it didn't they because
28:11
people were just getting sliced
28:13
oh did they really people were getting
28:15
really badly injured for it
28:17
what are they doing all the way up there
28:18
i mean well the string
28:20
the string goes all the way from the
28:22
ground to the surface
28:25
um so on things that japan has cracked
28:28
down on
28:28
okay um so dancing was illegal in japan
28:31
since world war ii wasn't it
28:33
what sorry sorry not dancing overall
28:35
dancing in
28:36
most nightclubs was illegal in japan oh
28:39
really um
28:40
and i think it was because um clubs have
28:43
become prostitution hotbeds people
28:45
believed after world war ii
28:46
and hotbeds is a very good word for what
28:48
happens with prostitution
28:50
but no this is quite interesting so uh
28:52
it was dancing with bannon nightclubs
28:53
because it was seen as kind of
28:54
like a like sentius type thing to do and
28:57
then the band was sort of relaxed
28:59
towards the end of the 20th century and
29:00
then it was really cracked down on in
29:01
the 20 at the start of the 21st century
29:03
um because i think there was there were
29:05
a lot of scandals happening at the time
29:06
celebrities scandals in clubs and people
29:08
were getting a bit too raunchy
29:10
and so there was a petition signed by
29:12
150 000 people in japan to lift the ban
29:15
and i think it's just been lifted i
29:16
don't think it's coming to into action
29:18
yet
29:18
but it's just been lifted but yeah you
29:20
weren't allowed to dance if you danced
29:21
in a nightclub
29:22
in japan you were escorted out of the
29:24
building wow
29:26
and locked up people yeah they
29:28
definitely were dancing it was one of
29:29
those laws where
29:30
people just kind of let it go because it
29:32
was i think until
29:33
more recently which is why they signed
29:35
the petition yeah i almost got kicked
29:37
out of a nightclub for being asleep
29:39
right but i would say they know you were
29:41
asleep
29:42
yeah he was just squatting on his
29:45
haunches with his eyes closed
29:46
could have been anything
29:50
no i was i was it was new years it was
29:51
my first new year's in london it was a
29:53
big
29:54
club that was going it was just past new
29:55
year's i got really tired so i fell
29:56
asleep on the floor on the dance floor
29:58
and it was a big dance floor there was
30:02
space for me people could go around they
30:03
could see a person there it was fine
30:05
so i just laid down i went to sleep and
30:07
uh then
30:08
i got woke up by the security guard he's
30:10
like hey you can't sleep in here
30:11
i literally looked around everyone was
30:13
snorting coke doing ease
30:15
everything around me and that was fine
30:16
but sleeping on the floor of a dance
30:18
floor yeah they always hate sleeping you
30:20
always get kicked out of sleeping in
30:21
nightclubs you should know that by now
30:23
dan
30:23
okay so we've got illegal things in
30:25
japan yes yeah yeah okay so it's illegal
30:27
in japan not to take
30:28
any holidays from work really they're
30:31
about to make it illegal
30:32
yeah and that's because of the culture
30:35
in japan where people just want to work
30:37
and work and work because
30:38
especially with the recession um people
30:40
think you know if i take time off then i
30:42
might get fired or whatever
30:43
and so they're saying you mandatorily
30:46
have to take your holidays you have to
30:47
take five days of holiday every year
30:49
wow yeah that's a huge amount of
30:51
holidays
30:52
[Laughter]
30:56
but if you take six you're fine no
30:59
obviously you're supposed to take the
31:00
right amount but it should take any
31:02
fewer than five than that then
31:03
should we move back to human pyramids
31:05
quickly yeah yeah you finish
31:06
so the guy who invented the human
31:08
pyramid uh was called john astley and he
31:10
was the son of philip astley
31:12
who was this huge he basically phillip
31:15
asked me basically invented the circus
31:16
um and so it was the original
31:20
uh human pyramid was called the force
31:22
der kyle as in the force of hercules
31:24
or the strength of hercules because that
31:25
was what they thought it took to make a
31:27
human pyramid
31:28
but my favorite thing about astley is
31:30
what his wife's
31:32
best trick was because she was a circus
31:33
performer as well and
31:35
her best trick apparently or one of her
31:38
tricks
31:39
was marching bees across a table
31:44
yeah and she could also ride a horse
31:46
while wearing uh
31:47
a flock of bees swarm of bees
31:53
oh this is where in her hand the word
31:55
flock used to mean just
31:56
a group of anything so you say a flock
31:58
of lions
32:00
yeah they say a flock of anything yeah
32:02
wow so you can have flock of bees she
32:03
had a flock of bees and she wore them on
32:05
her hand as a muff
32:06
while riding a horse wow yeah
32:09
yeah it's kind of it's like a
32:11
self-fulfilling thing isn't it because
32:13
the handlers presumably looked so
32:14
repulsive by the end of that day that
32:15
she'd have to wear them off the next day
32:17
to conceal it because it was swollen and
32:18
bloodied
32:19
and then you've got to keep the bees on
32:20
forever absolutely so the bees have got
32:22
a good gig going on
32:24
wow we should wrap up very soon do we
32:26
have anything before we go
32:28
just on japan japan health health and
32:31
safety
32:31
uh i was looking into and um there's
32:34
tama zoo
32:35
in japan and it wanted to uh check
32:38
that it had the right health and safety
32:40
things in place
32:42
if an animal escaped and so they have
32:44
snow leopards there
32:46
and so they dressed up a staff member
32:48
like a snow leopard like if you remember
32:50
when you were eight and you got costumes
32:52
of um
32:53
leopards and lions and stuff it's like
32:54
that um like a ridiculously unrealistic
32:56
snow leopard costume and he had to run
32:58
across the park's ground as 70 members
33:00
of staff tried to capture him using nets
33:02
poles and tranquilizer darts
33:03
tranquilizer darts yeah whoa
33:07
that was this is the quote that's
33:08
reported in so many papers and
33:10
you've got to assume that the uh guy the
33:13
zoo
33:14
park director was being a little bit
33:16
tongue-in-cheek when he said it but he
33:17
said
33:18
we focused on making this drill as
33:19
realistic as possible one of our staff
33:21
being knocked down
33:22
injured and then being knocked
33:23
unconscious and going into cardiac
33:25
arrest was part of that

00:48
facts from the last seven days and in no

particular order here we go starting
00:53
with my fact
00:54

one of those pasta
01:06
strainers you can wear them
01:07
[Laughter]
01:10
it's genuinely true and it obviously
01:11
pisses off the authorities whenever
01:13
someone says it's my right to and the
01:14
reason they say it's their right to is
01:16
they say they can do it on religious
01:17
grounds yeah is it pastaferianism
01:19
pastiferianism such strong name
01:24
how many people know about
01:25
pastafarianism
01:26
oh yeah how many people are pastafarians
01:30
whoa did somebody say you're a minister

01:34

which you can do you can you can can you
01:41
do it here in glasgow can you get
01:42
married
01:43
the legislation that brought in same-sex
01:45
marriages uh last year part of that was
01:47
to allow
01:48
non-like non-traditional religious
01:50
groups to perform uh weddings well i'm
01:56
you're a minister mate you should
01:58
have that covered
02:00
um dan do you know i'm a minister of um
02:03
the priest of the church of the latter
02:05
day dude
02:07
what yeah i am i signed up online
02:09
[Laughter]
02:12
it's a very very stringent thing you
02:13
have to go through you go onto their
02:15
website you put your email it's
02:16
basically signing up to a mailing list
02:18
but they say that then you're a minister
02:20
in their church what do you get to do um
02:23
apparently what do you get to dude
02:24
[Laughter]
02:28
dude you take this woman
02:32
i dude
02:36
i don't think you're taking my religion
02:37
very seriously sorry sorry well um so
02:40
it's from a movie that with the dude i
02:42
don't know i've never seen it oh my god
02:44
big lebelski
02:46
it's like it's like a jew hasn't read
02:48
the ten commandments
02:52
and when i signed up i vowed to uphold
02:54
the principles of buddhism to take it
02:57
easy to be easygoing to everyone i meet
02:59
and to keep my mind limber
03:01
and i had to promise that the ordination
03:03
was for me and not for someone else or
03:06
my dog or whatever
03:07
[Laughter]
03:10
that's very cool that's amazing wow yeah
03:12
so what about pacifarianism what's that
03:14
all about well it was started in 2005
03:16
wasn't it and it's uh people who are
03:17
protesting against teaching intelligent
03:19
design in schools in america as an
03:21
alternative to evolution and so they
03:23
created their own kind of god which was
03:25
the spaghetti monster
03:27
uh yeah and they and it's becoming this
03:29
is the thing it's becoming quite a large
03:30
religion to the point where people are
03:32
um are ministers and are
03:35
are wearing colanders on their head
03:37
because that's the religious headgear
03:38
that they wear in the photos and they
03:40
even have now it's gone so far that
03:42
there are some people who aren't quite
03:44
sure whether or not they believe in the
03:46
flying spaghetti the
03:47
spaghetti monster
03:49
so
03:50
most pastafarians believe that he's
03:52
tomato based whereas others believe
03:57
whereas others believe that it is pesto
03:59
or cream
03:59
[Laughter]
04:02
and they're called sphagnostics
04:06
[Applause]
04:09
so i have a fact about things that are
04:11
not hats
04:14
i i i wanted to find out things that are
04:17
not hats that have been used as hats so
04:18
i googled the phrase worn as a hat
04:21
specifically that
04:23
and it it turned out that uh in 2002 a
04:27
17 year old girl wore a chameleon as a
04:29
hat through manchester airport and was
04:31
stopped by the customs guys
04:34
the telegraph said despite its ability
04:36
to camouflage itself by changing color
04:38
[Laughter]
04:40
the chameleon attracted the attention of
04:42
people at the luggage carousel and she'd
04:44
flown all the way from dubai with this
04:46
thing on her head
04:48
and it was a very endangered species so
04:49
they took it off her and sent to a safe
04:51
house and eventually sent it back i
04:52
suppose there's there's an australian
04:55
guy who uh once smuggled a snake in his
04:58
underpants to uh barley yeah on a plane
05:01
in the early days
05:04
oh yeah i might have misheard that story
05:06
[Music]
05:09
yeah no okay back to you yeah
05:12
um on wearing odd things on your head i
05:15
wouldn't put a snake in my pants sorry
05:17
please please i think this is a fruitful
05:19
thing to pursue yeah i would probably
05:21
put it in um
05:22
you know those ice cream lolly
05:24
containers i'd put it in the ice cream
05:26
dollar container and then i put the
05:27
handle on you know the lid on right do i
05:30
don't think anyone knows what you're
05:31
talking about
05:32
guys
05:33
[Laughter]
05:35
you know when you're making a lolly
05:37
and you pour the lolly stuff into the
05:38
mold and then you put the mold in the
05:39
freezer and put it in one of those well
05:41
that'd be quite a small snake yeah let's
05:43
see my lollipops
05:46
and
05:46
that is not the first time i've heard
05:48
you use that chat
05:52
and it won't be the last
05:56
so there's a guy in america yeah um who
05:59
decided to wear a colander on his head
06:01
for his gun license and um the police
06:04
took his guns away
06:07
that's what you have to do to get your
06:08
guns taken right
06:11
he said i was told i was mentally
06:13
competent and i've never misused my guns
06:16
or intend to do so so it's a real kick
06:18
in the guts that if i was told that i
06:20
was to go for another photo with a
06:22
colander on my head my guns would be
06:23
taken away again
06:25
so apparently if you wear a condor on
06:27
your head for your um gun license
06:28
they're going to take it off you and he
06:30
said he's going to wear his colander on
06:32
his head for his driving license and he
06:34
said what they're going to do take my
06:35
car away
06:37
i think probably they will yeah
06:42
i
06:42
read an account that uh if someone in
06:44
russia got the first ever license i
06:46
think they were the fifth person
06:46
worldwide to be officially allowed to
06:48
wear a colander on their head because of
06:49
this uh flying spaghetti monster thing
06:51
yeah but it said that they
06:53
this person if he was driving he had to
06:55
be wearing the colander at all times
06:58
because you have to look like you do in
07:00
your license i think he wore a knitted
07:03
colander as well
07:04
yeah it's not an actual colander it's a
07:06
it's just a knitted one um on driving
07:09
licenses um there's a guy called jared
07:12
hyams who lives in victoria in australia
07:14
who's been fighting with authorities for
07:17
five years now for the right to have a
07:19
penis drawing as his signature on his
07:21
driving license
07:24
and he said this all started he was
07:26
registering for a change of electoral
07:28
address and he thought this would be
07:29
funny rather than sign it i'm going to
07:31
draw a cartoon penis which is quite a
07:33
good drawing of the cartoon penis
07:34
actually and
07:36
he said i was receiving letters and
07:38
phone calls telling me i couldn't have
07:39
that as my signature and i thought
07:41
that's interesting why not
07:44
you don't have to the signature doesn't
07:46
have to be you writing your name it just
07:47
has to be a mark that you produce that
07:49
can look the same every time so if you
07:50
can draw a consistent
07:53
penis picture that's your signature i'm
07:55
with i'm with him on this well i think
07:57
he's getting away with it i think it
07:58
might be on his driving license uh thing
08:00
and i think he's been signing my front
08:02
door all the time
08:08
we need to move on fairly soon to the
08:09
next fact anything else before we do
08:11
there is a guy there's a swedish artist
08:13
i just love this guy he's called
08:14
frederick sacca and he painted the
08:16
picture for his driving license right so
08:18
he he did a
08:19
self-portrait because you have to submit
08:22
a likeness and a photo but it doesn't
08:25
have to be a photo of you it just has to
08:27
be a photo that looks enough like you
08:29
that if someone looked at it they
08:30
thought oh that's him
08:32
so he did a self-portrait he took a
08:34
photo of the self-portrait and he
08:36
submitted it and the authorities said
08:37
fine
08:40
they were very cool about it they just
08:41
said the picture we have received looks
08:43
like any other photo so we have had no
08:45
reason to question it and they let him
08:46
do it isn't that cool i mean they're
08:48
accepting colanders and penises now so
08:51
i find that unsurprising
08:53
can i just there's a
08:55
problem with driving license
08:56
applications in the us and this was
08:58
raised by a woman in florida last year i
09:01
think when uh she'd had she got her
09:03
driving license renewed um and she had
09:05
it for a few months and she started
09:06
noticing people were treating her a bit
09:07
weirdly so she tried to stay in a hotel
09:09
and she couldn't stay they wouldn't let
09:10
her stay she went to disney world and
09:12
they said i'm sorry we can't let you
09:14
park here we can't let you come in and
09:16
um eventually someone checked her
09:17
driving license and pointed out that
09:19
they'd accidentally labeled her as a
09:21
sexual predator rather than an organ
09:23
donor
09:23
[Laughter]
09:26
whoa
09:27
that's a different kind of organ
09:32
apparently those two boxes
09:34
[Laughter]
09:37
what box is that though
09:39
because it's not like there's an other
09:41
interesting fact section on my driving
09:43
license
09:44
there's no trivia bit on my passport you
09:47
know
09:48
as he says lolly mold enthusiast
09:55
should we move on to our next fact
09:57
okay it is time for fact number two and
09:59
that is andy my fact is there was a
10:02
victorian job that consisted solely of
10:04
pushing people into the sea
10:06
[Laughter]
10:09
this was a real thing these people were
10:11
called dippers
10:14
and um so it's all to do with victorian
10:17
swimming etiquette basically so um
10:20
they were quite strict about segregating
10:22
sexes for reasons of modesty and decency
10:24
um you would have these people whose job
10:27
it was to push you quickly into the
10:29
water so that your modesty was preserved
10:32
as a woman i think it was mostly for
10:33
female swimmers yeah yeah because so
10:35
these bathing houses that they used to
10:37
go into that that's the thing that got
10:39
taken into the yeah
10:40
so to go swimming you had to go into a
10:42
special cart on wheels
10:44
um then they would take horses attach
10:47
them to the car the horses would drag
10:49
the machine into the sea you would
10:51
change and then you would dive in off
10:53
the end yeah you'd mostly go nude
10:56
because and i'm hoping that you guys can
10:58
confirm this swimming at the beach uh
11:01
and these big laborious things with
11:03
horses bringing you down there were
11:05
invented before the swimming suit so
11:08
everyone went naked and they're like how
11:09
do we get around this naked thing let's
11:11
build a massive house
11:12
and then we'll get a horse and we'll
11:15
bring it in
11:16
they just didn't have uh
11:18
i think they did have like woolen
11:19
swimming suits but they got quite heavy
11:21
but everyone was drowning
11:24
people did swim naked at the start of
11:26
the victorian period but then about
11:28
halfway through everyone got a little
11:29
bit prudish as we all know and that's
11:31
when they had these kind of houses and
11:32
things i think right yeah because
11:34
swimming in the victorian era at first
11:36
was really more for medical purposes
11:37
than holidaying purposes wasn't it and
11:39
so i think sometimes some people thought
11:41
you had to be dipped in three times in
11:42
and out and it was quite important how
11:44
quickly you got dipped in how many times
11:46
and that could cure you of tb or flu or
11:48
whatever you had oh wow so yeah and they
11:50
were really unpopular as well people
11:52
hated the dippers um
11:54
so somebody said they were the most
11:56
horrid looking creatures i ever beheld
11:58
good heavens to be dipped by one of them
12:00
and soused like a condemned puppy or
12:02
kitten
12:02
[Laughter]
12:06
um i was looking into uh swimming around
12:08
the world now because i thought oh i
12:09
wonder if different cultures have
12:11
different ways of going to the beach and
12:12
if you live in china and you go to the
12:14
beach how would how would that be in
12:16
china there's a big new fashion with
12:17
swimming costumes and i'd not heard of
12:19
this and maybe you all have but called
12:21
the face kini so it's basically they
12:24
wear what effectively is a nacho libre
12:26
mask over their heads because uh they
12:29
don't want sun tans it's a big it's a
12:31
big kind of no-no though to have a
12:33
suntan so they wear these yeah these
12:35
mexican wrestling masks and they go to
12:37
the beach so if you go to the beach in
12:39
china it's just packed with wrestlers
12:41
[Laughter]
12:44
if you wear one of those can you go
12:46
naked on the rest of your body
12:48
because it doesn't matter because no one
12:49
knows who you are so this is the thing a
12:51
lot of people do it now and it's not
12:52
about the tan anymore it's about an
12:54
anonymous state at the beach you can do
12:56
what you could hang out whatever you
12:57
want to hang out and just go and do
12:59
whatever you want and no one will know
13:00
who you are that's they actually did
13:02
that um women used to wear masks in the
13:04
16th and 17th centuries for exactly that
13:06
reason it was a fashion thing so women
13:08
of high society would go around in masks
13:10
and they'd often wear them in bed and
13:12
that was to stop your skin being exposed
13:15
too much to sunlight and stop yourself
13:16
getting a tan because it was
13:17
unfashionable wow yeah do you know it
13:19
was illegal to be topless in america in
13:22
the early 20th century and uh people
13:24
were arrested for it as a man or a woman
13:26
as a man sorry
13:28
i didn't how sexist am i just assumed by
13:30
to be i've been all men um yeah in 1935
13:34
42 men were arrested for being topless
13:36
in uh in atlantic city and uh uh people
13:39
who were arresting them said we will
13:40
have no gorillas on our beaches
13:43
um and yeah it was a thing it was not
13:45
very improper um the man who invented
13:47
the lava lamp was a nudist wasn't he yes
13:49
yes
13:50
yeah he used to make videos of um women
13:53
swimming underwater naked and then
13:55
presumably went from there to lava lamp
13:59
obviously the logical joke
14:03
do you know what's happened to bathing
14:05
machines today do you know what happened
14:06
to them
14:07
no
14:08
they are now they were repurposed into
14:11
those bathing huts that you get at the
14:12
back of beaches so they just took they
14:14
wheeled them back off the beach as it
14:16
came as people thought actually it's
14:17
more sensible for us to wear a swimming
14:19
costume they wheeled them back to the
14:21
back of the beach they took the wheels
14:22
off and now uh that's why they're
14:24
fashionable because bathing machines
14:25
were transformed into that oh someone
14:26
last year built a new bathing machine
14:28
incredibly exciting this is the first
14:30
one built for 100 years is on the coast
14:32
somewhere obviously
14:33
[Laughter]
14:38
i think it was in margate and he raised
14:40
about 30 000 pounds on kickstarter and
14:43
it's really cool it features uh one of
14:45
the little special features that you
14:47
used to get on bathing machines which
14:48
was a modesty hood um which is this
14:50
little canvas tent and basically the end
14:52
that's facing the sea you kind of lower
14:54
this canvas hood
14:56
almost all the way to the water so that
14:57
you can have even more privacy
15:00
yeah that specific awning was invented
15:02
by a guy called benjamin beale and he's
15:05
often given credit for inventing the
15:07
entire concept of this beach house uh
15:10
the bathing house but all he did was the
15:12
awning and he just got all the credit
15:13
that is outrageous i'm so glad that you
15:16
are rewriting everyone's assumptions
15:18
about this guy
15:19
i'm glad we've righted that wrong
15:24
i know
15:25
[Laughter]
15:30
um i was reading about there's a uh
15:32
because obviously uh people love
15:34
swimming and there's a lot of beautiful
15:35
places in the uk to go swimming there's
15:37
one absolutely if you look at photos of
15:38
this place absolutely beautiful um and
15:40
it's called the lagoon of buxton
15:43
absolutely stunning but it's it's really
15:45
toxic it's really dangerous and so
15:47
they're doing everything they can to
15:49
stop people from swimming in it but
15:50
because it looks so beautiful people
15:52
just ignore the signs and keep going in
15:54
so one sign that's up there it says uh
15:57
warning do not enter water due to high
15:59
ph levels this can cause skin and iota
16:01
stomach problems fungal infections such
16:03
as thrush it says that inside there are
16:06
car wrecks dead animals excrement
16:08
rubbish
16:09
and still people keep going in they keep
16:11
going in for a swim and they're getting
16:12
quite ill so what they've had to do in
16:14
the end they've had to dye the lagoon
16:16
black
16:17
so that people now go oh that looks
16:19
disgusting so they've altered a
16:21
beautiful place or a beautiful place
16:23
quite how beautiful it can be when it's
16:24
full of car wrecks and for excrement
16:28
oh look at that beautiful turd floating
16:31
by
16:33
ah the serenity
16:36
there are swimming pools in new zealand
16:39
which are being terrorized by mystery
16:42
poors and
16:44
this is terrorized
16:47
this is terrorism in new zealand yeah
16:49
this is a swimming pool uh one is in a
16:51
place called middle march uh but there
16:53
are a couple who've experienced it and
16:54
there were three feces incidents in a
16:56
week so they think it was deliberate
16:58
there was one incident where um this was
17:00
in a invercargill splash palace pool so
17:03
avoid that uh where there was uh it
17:06
sounds beautiful
17:08
no james i went and i got thrush
17:13
yeah so this place is full of and
17:15
andy's vaginal infections
17:22
well it said there was uh there was a
17:24
large amount of human waste deposited
17:26
into the deep end so everyone was
17:27
evacuated and moved to the learner's
17:29
pool and then they were evacuated from
17:31
that when it was discovered the
17:32
learner's pool was also full of feces
17:37
all right let's move on to our next fact
17:39
okay it is time for fact number
17:41
[Laughter]
17:44
it's time for fact number three
17:46
and that is chezinski yes my fact is
17:49
that desperate dan stopped eating cow
17:52
pie because of mad cow disease
17:54
um he gave up cow pie which is his
17:57
favorite food
17:58
so that was really sad yeah i think it
18:00
was in 1996 and um sources vary and i
18:03
can't find the original comic strips but
18:05
um i think he started eating aunt
18:07
aggie's vegetable and fish options as a
18:09
replacement
18:11
but the cow pizza eight so the thing
18:13
with uh mad cow disease or cjd is that
18:16
um the danger was eating strange bits of
18:18
a cow wasn't it and desperate dan did
18:20
used to eat the whole cow because it had
18:22
like the horn sticking out and the tails
18:24
sticking out so i would say if anyone
18:26
was in danger of contracting it it was
18:28
probably him
18:29
we should say for listeners overseas and
18:31
things like that who desperate dan is
18:33
just in case people don't know so the
18:35
britain's two biggest uh comics ever
18:37
called the bino and the dandy and the
18:39
dandy starred uh cover star desperate
18:42
dan who was a cowboy and he was this
18:44
huge guy and um like he did amazing
18:47
things he had to shave with a blowtorch
18:49
because he was so tough
18:50
and uh he passed his hair by firing a
18:52
pistol through it
18:54
and
18:55
it's just part of this amazing tradition
18:57
of really really great comics and really
18:59
imaginative things i read these when i
19:01
was a boy and um they're very so good he
19:04
used to smoke through a drain pipe he's
19:06
used a drain pipe as a cigarette or a
19:07
pipe i think didn't he and it was a
19:08
dustbin full of rubbish at the end of it
19:10
which i think he lit and smoked he was
19:12
pretty hardcore he was
19:14
[Music]
19:16
he had a gun he had to give that up as
19:17
well in the 90s or the 80s for political
19:20
correctness gone mad so i don't know how
19:22
he parted his hair after that maybe he
19:23
went for i think he had a water pistol
19:25
after that
19:26
okay yeah that sense he sounds a lot
19:28
better than the guy who was in the first
19:30
episode of the bino called harry dan
19:32
and harry dan was an old man whose long
19:35
white beard usually saved the day
19:40
and in the first episode he used his
19:42
beard as a sail to win a boat race and
19:45
you could rescue children from down
19:46
wells i'm sure he did i think i can see
19:49
why dennis the menace took his took his
19:51
top spot after a short while there's
19:53
amazing fact isn't there about dennis
19:55
the menace which is that they so there
19:57
were two dennis the menaces one is an
19:58
american version and then one is the
20:00
british version and they were both
20:02
created in the same year independent of
20:04
each other they had no idea that they
20:05
were being published they both had the
20:07
red and black costume they both were
20:09
called dennis the menace i think it
20:10
might have even been in the same week i
20:11
think it was the same wow
20:14
and it's often used by people trying to
20:16
explain coincidences and why they're not
20:17
surprising that uh you in a world where
20:20
infinite things can happen you expect
20:22
the old coincidence so actually when we
20:24
discovered that we should have gone well
20:25
yeah obviously mad things will happen
20:27
yes and just move on it's not amazing at
20:29
all in fact
20:30
the other argument about that is that
20:32
ideas have a time so maybe there was
20:35
some other children with spikey hair and
20:37
some other cartoon and other people with
20:39
red and black and other people called
20:40
dennis and
20:41
the same thing came with uh calculus
20:43
when leibniz and um yeah newton all came
20:47
up with at the same time almost at
20:49
exactly the same time and it's like well
20:50
was it a weird coincidence or was it
20:52
just the time for that yeah to come up
20:54
yeah um dennis amanda's dad now has
20:57
spikey hair in fact the bino did an
20:58
extremely exciting reveal a few years
21:01
ago which was that uh they showed on one
21:04
of the bits of comic strip a photograph
21:06
of dennis the menace from the 80s and
21:07
they had dennis's dad saying look that's
21:09
a picture of me so it transpires that
21:11
dennis the menace is actually now
21:13
dennis's dad
21:14
oh know when the switch wait they used a
21:17
photo of dennis from the 80s
21:19
dennis's dad said that used to be me
21:21
yeah but there's no there's no plotline
21:23
where
21:24
dennis grows up in the 90s and
21:27
his father's a
21:28
son i was like
21:31
that is stupid
21:33
i'm so angry
21:34
[Laughter]
21:40
anyway he's sorry he's changed his hair
21:42
style dennis and master's dad so they've
21:43
tried to upgrade the bino to make it
21:44
more realistic and the case is now that
21:46
we live in a happier time where parents
21:47
don't all abuse their children and kids
21:49
don't all hate their parents and so
21:50
dennis's dad is now he has spiky hair
21:53
and he's a bit cool and groovy he's a
21:55
little bit like i used to be a rebel too
21:57
yeah is there an authority figure who's
21:59
still the enemy though because that was
22:01
always the thing it was always anarchy
22:03
you know the best streak kids always
22:04
yeah like teach was the enemy yeah i
22:06
think the teachers are still quite bad
22:08
but um this is cool the guy who draws
22:10
the bash street kids this is a niche
22:12
right now for people who read the people
22:14
he's called david sutherland and he has
22:16
drawn that comic strip since 1962
22:20
wow 53 years he's drawn over 2 000 of
22:24
them well here's a weird one as well um
22:26
neil tennant of the pet shop boys so the
22:29
lead singer of the pet shop boys um
22:31
between 1975 and 1977 he worked as an
22:34
editor for marvel uk
22:37
so his job was to anglicize all of the
22:39
with all the things that were
22:40
americanized in in the original comic uh
22:42
and his main job was to look at all the
22:45
points of say like cleavage or too short
22:48
of skirts pointing out and then they had
22:50
to draw over the cleavage and readdress
22:51
it because we had different indecency
22:53
laws over here
22:54
before pet shop boys he was stopping
22:56
cleavage from getting into the
22:58
comic books of
23:00
there was a big thing in america in the
23:02
when was it i was in the 50s 50s and 60s
23:05
where they had a censorship of comics
23:07
they might have even banned it banned
23:08
them for a while but they definitely
23:09
censored them and there's a guy called
23:11
frederick worton who wrote a pamphlet
23:14
called seduction of the innocent where
23:16
he complained about all these comics and
23:17
what they were doing to children and he
23:19
said that batman and robin were
23:21
obviously homosexual and porky pig was
23:24
an open invitation to buggery
23:26
[Laughter]
23:32
now
23:32
i i
23:34
i have never got that from
23:36
the cartoons what was this man's name he
23:39
was called frederick wortham and he was
23:41
a psychiatrist so he should know
23:43
actually okay i think there might have
23:44
been a little bit more going on in the
23:46
worthing brain
23:48
just just on that subject though with
23:50
porky pig um they uh there's a very big
23:52
uh porn website in america called
23:54
pornhub and they recently looked into
23:56
the analytics of the most searched for
23:58
words within people go on they put in a
24:00
word like like uh milf was a massive one
24:03
in a lot of american states stuff like
24:05
that they found that in nebraska
24:07
arkansas and tennessee the number one
24:09
search term was cartoon
24:12
another fact in south london it was
24:14
lolly mold
24:24
while we're on this
24:25
[Laughter]
24:28
um i read a list of characters in the
24:31
bino okay
24:33
um and they included um little dead eye
24:36
dick
24:39
deep down daddy neptune
24:42
cocky dick
24:44
wandering willie
24:46
sticky willy
24:48
and polly woddly doodle and her great
24:50
big poodle
24:51
[Laughter]
24:54
every single one of those is an
24:56
invitation to buggery
25:07
[Laughter]
25:09
do you guys know what the world's first
25:10
comic strip is
25:11
um
25:12
bio tapestry
25:16
very funny
25:17
[Laughter]
25:19
a lot of good comedy in there if you
25:20
want to see it no i think so i think
25:22
we're seeing a comic strip is uh it's a
25:25
series of cartoons that are sent out to
25:27
people's homes so the bear tapestry was
25:29
just in one place you didn't receive it
25:30
through the letterbox so okay uh which
25:33
have speech bubbles and people talking
25:34
and the first one was made in glasgow
25:37
and it was the glasgow well done
25:40
it was the glasgow looking glass and it
25:43
was in the in 1825 it had its first
25:45
issue and the first comic strip in it
25:47
was called the history of the coat and
25:50
it was
25:52
it was the adventures of a coat going
25:54
from one owner to the next that's a
25:56
great idea that's really cool
25:58
cool yeah and also it had a lot of
26:00
hard-hitting satire it had a lot of
26:02
bitching about the english in it um even
26:04
though it was set up by a english guy
26:06
who'd had to flee london because he was
26:08
in so much debt so he went to scotland
26:10
and was obviously like okay cool i like
26:12
i like these guys he made a thing a
26:14
comic strip which partly bitched about
26:16
the english and then he racked up so
26:17
much gambling and drinking debts in
26:19
scotland that he had to flee again back
26:20
to england
26:22
and so it stopped um do you know who
26:24
invented the speech bubble
26:27
oh controversial i've got a theory
26:29
what's yours
26:30
my theory is that it's 650 bc
26:33
and it was the miso americans the early
26:36
central american people of super fame or
26:39
is that
26:39
[Laughter]
26:42
miso
26:45
how do i pronounce that right just in
26:47
case we get letters
26:48
does it mess or all right i don't think
26:50
any of them are going to write to you
26:51
now andy
26:53
um but they have little speech bowl they
26:55
have drawings of people and they have
26:56
these tiny little sort of arrows showing
26:58
that like to a dagger drawing and it
27:00
shows that people are slagging each
27:01
other off in the in the drawings yeah
27:04
and that is a speech bubble sort of
27:06
signifying abuse and do you agree with
27:08
that anna i do agree with that probably
27:10
yes uh you know super ted you know that
27:12
his first language is not in fact
27:15
english
27:17
it's welsh
27:19
yeah super ted's first language as well
27:21
it's a welsh cartoon and when it first
27:23
went out it was in welsh and they uh
27:24
they just dubbed it into english
27:27
uh we should move on soon uh
27:30
have you have you guys got anything else
27:31
before we do
27:32
i quite liked the quote from uh ewan
27:34
kurt who was a uh
27:37
you won
27:37
[Laughter]
27:40
pull the other one
27:45
how did i not see that
27:47
i'm not really doing my job properly i
27:49
wrote down the name you wouldn't
27:51
i didn't notice i'm so embarrassed yeah
27:54
so ewanka is a
27:57
is a top guy at dc thompson which makes
27:59
the bino in the dandy and uh he was
28:01
there's an interview with him semi
28:03
bemoaning how they've had to go a bit
28:05
politically correct so corporal
28:07
punishment smoking and racial
28:09
stereotypes and now taboo
28:12
it does limit us in a way
28:16
but we get to be slightly ruder than in
28:18
the old days a bit more bodily functions
28:20
instead we know that's what the kids
28:22
laugh at now
28:23
those stupid kids not laughing at the
28:25
racial stereotypes anymore
28:31
uh let's move on to our final fact of
28:32
the night and that is james harkin okay
28:35
my fact this week is that the oldest
28:37
sperm is worm sperm
28:42
mostly because i just like the cadence
28:44
of it
28:44
[Laughter]
28:46
um but we found some 50 million year old
28:48
sperm cells
28:50
[Laughter]
28:52
you leave us out of it
28:57
i was swimming in buxton
28:58
[Laughter]
29:04
um you have 50 million year old sperm
29:06
cells and they have been found
29:08
in an antarctic worm and they were in a
29:11
fossilized cocoon so that's because
29:13
normally so sperm cells are so small and
29:15
delicate they normally die and they
29:16
don't get fossilized but these ones did
29:18
get fossilized and they're the oldest
29:20
ones that we have and they're from worms
29:22
50 million
29:24
sperm had evolved at that point or is
29:25
this is this the first proof we've had
29:27
that it did evolve uh i don't know about
29:29
that actually but yeah i suppose there
29:31
was no evidence that they'd that they'd
29:33
evolved at that stage
29:35
does it still function
29:39
there is a sperm that's worked after um
29:42
23 years i think so the world's oldest
29:45
baby is 23 years this is an australian
29:47
guy who uh got quite ill and he was i
29:51
think 15 years old at the time and he
29:53
decided to save his sperm before he was
29:55
going to have some kind of operation he
29:57
survived uh his problem he uh grilled he
30:00
got married and then i think the
30:02
operation that he needed at the point
30:04
meant that he could no longer produce
30:05
sperm so he had this sitting there uh
30:08
from all those years ago and they used
30:10
that and it worked and so he has a kid
30:12
from his from his sperm from when he was
30:13
15. it was like frozen in a lab it
30:15
wasn't just sitting there
30:19
because you have to freeze it properly
30:20
don't you have to freeze at a really low
30:21
temperature like the freezer temperature
30:23
will not do yes yeah
30:25
that's a man who spends a lot of his
30:27
time apparently by refrigerator
30:31
thinking i'm now thinking that lolly
30:32
mold sounds like a disease
30:36
a touch of lolly mold
30:37
[Laughter]
30:39
and there are sperm smugglers as well
30:41
who are freezing sperms
30:43
bug smuggling is happening in it's not
30:46
smuggling
30:48
that's what they should call it they
30:49
should call it spunkling or something
30:51
yeah
30:53
so what so people smuggling sperm like
30:56
bolsperman
30:58
no uh this is in prisons uh so people
31:00
who are in prison who aren't allowed to
31:03
have contact with uh the their wives um
31:06
are smuggling sperm so there's a baby
31:09
who was born to um regina granato in
31:13
america in 1999 even though her husband
31:16
had been in prison since 1987 he was a
31:18
gang leader um uh gangster and yeah this
31:21
baby was born because she'd smuggled in
31:23
a cryogenic sperm freezing kit wow and
31:25
given it to him and then he'd spermed
31:27
into it and then
31:29
[Laughter]
31:40
but she smuggled it in because they're
31:41
not allowed to touch each other so she
31:43
smuggled in the kit the only people who
31:45
the prisoners are allowed to touch uh in
31:47
uh i think it's in pennsylvania are
31:50
people under the age of eight who are
31:51
allowed to give their parents a hug so
31:53
she brought her husband's nephew in and
31:55
gave him the cryogenic sperm freezing
31:57
kit so that he could hug his uncle and
32:00
his uncle could uh slip the kit out from
32:02
his coat pocket uh i was uh i was
32:05
googling uh worm and sperm there's a lot
32:08
of amazing things but they're so
32:10
disgusting this is a really hard topic
32:12
to talk about because okay so for
32:14
example uh there's there's a type of
32:16
worm a female worm that when after she's
32:19
been spermed into
32:21
[Laughter]
32:25
she can then decide that she doesn't
32:28
like the sperm so then she puts her face
32:32
into it and sucks out the sperm and just
32:34
spits it away so
32:36
wow is this a kind of worm this is a
32:38
kind of worm yeah so this worm does it
32:40
it just goes no i'm not having that
32:42
and goes in takes sucks it out and so
32:45
it's got to the point where the sperm i
32:47
think has evolved now to be a bit savvy
32:50
to it so it has this little clinging
32:52
stuff inside so actually it's like you
32:54
need to properly suck
32:56
because it's hanging on because that's
32:58
amazing yeah it's like an arms race
33:00
between the two yeah the sexes
33:03
yeah yeah because the scaly cricket i
33:05
think the male scaly cricket has to
33:08
populate constantly it can copulate more
33:10
than 50 times in three hours or
33:11
something because the females kill the
33:13
cricket for some evolutionary reason
33:15
that's beyond us her response when he
33:17
does copulate into her is to take it out
33:18
immediately and eat the sperm
33:20
so
33:21
it's very rare you slip one through she
33:23
goes she thinks you're feeding her wow
33:26
yeah okay i found a flat worm and buckle
33:30
up guys
33:30
[Laughter]
33:33
it's called macrostoma histrix right and
33:36
if it is lonely and if it can't find a
33:39
mate um they're all hermaphrodites so
33:41
they have both kinds of genitalia if
33:44
it's lonely it can stab itself in the
33:46
head with a sperm-filled hypodermic
33:48
needle to inseminate itself
33:50
we've never seen it doing it
33:53
but scientists left certain worms on
33:56
their own and they and they then came
33:57
back later and they found oh they've got
33:59
a lot of sperm in their head
34:01
but how did it get there and it these
34:04
worms had it sort of injected themselves
34:06
because they can sort of um fertilize
34:08
themselves using their using sort of
34:10
both uh
34:11
bits of genitalia and yeah and they
34:14
hatched and they had they had hatchlings
34:16
they call that selfing do they no
34:19
do they have selfing sticks
34:20
[Laughter]
34:23
[Applause]
34:29
there is a ground louse that reproduces
34:32
by slapping one giant sperm onto a
34:35
female's back
34:37
um and its latin name is zorotypus
34:40
impolitus
34:41
[Laughter]
34:49
you know larger animals tend to have
34:52
smaller sperm
34:53
so the way the i think the study was
34:55
done on this really recently to try and
34:56
work out why and it's quite interesting
34:57
so um fruit fly sperm is the largest
35:00
sperm in nature i think elephant sperm
35:02
are very small so i think a fruit fly
35:03
sperm is
35:04
about a thousand times bigger than an
35:06
elephant sperm at the top of my head
35:07
something like that and uh it's because
35:10
if you're a bigger animal then the sperm
35:13
have further to swim and so in order for
35:16
them to have a chance to succeed you've
35:17
got to produce more of them to make it
35:19
more likely that one of them's going to
35:20
finally get to the egg and if you
35:22
produce more of them it takes up more
35:23
energy so you can't make them as big
35:25
whereas if you're a little fruit fly
35:26
it's like the spur is easy it's about
35:28
got about a centimeter to go and so you
35:30
can produce a few giant sperm oh and um
35:33
people who are more attractive uh men
35:36
wise um have worse sperm
35:39
so men who are attractive to women tend
35:41
to be men with deeper voices or a bit
35:43
more manly who evolution has told us we
35:45
should be attracted to because they've
35:46
got more testosterone but actually it's
35:49
a trade-off so if you fed all your
35:50
testosterone to building yourself
35:51
ridiculously large biceps or a penis or
35:53
whatever then
35:55
you
36:00
[Laughter]
36:08
so yeah keep going
36:10
that's it so that's it so there's too
36:12
much testosterone going to making
36:14
lifting weights with your penis or
36:15
whatever so
36:16
you don't have enough leftovers to make
36:17
healthier sperm i find that really
36:19
surprising i can't believe that
36:20
testosterone is spent on attractiveness
36:24
in that sense
36:25
well i suppose if you're spending on
36:26
attractiveness then you're going to
36:27
attract more mates and so there's a
36:29
higher likelihood that you'll be able to
36:30
fertilize one of them so it's almost
36:32
like uh okay well never mind the less
36:34
attractive people will give you some
36:36
better sperm instead so that the one
36:37
mate you finally do manage to seduce
36:40
you've got a higher chance
36:42
you leave my wife out of this
36:44
[Laughter]
36:50
well goodness haven't we learnt a lot
36:56
okay that's it that's all of our facts

hello
00:14
and welcome to another episode of no
00:17
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:19
this week coming to you from oren moore
00:21
in glasgow scotland
00:22
my name is dan shriver and please
00:24
welcome to the stage it's anna jaczynski
00:26
andy murray and james hurricane
00:36
[Applause]
00:42
and once again we have gathered round
00:45
the microphones with our four favorite
00:46
facts from the last seven days and in no
00:48
particular order
00:49
here we go starting with you andrew
00:52
hunter murray
00:53
my fact this week is that for just one
00:55
penny
00:56
you can rent a b for a month
01:03
what what what are we doing here
01:07
so what would you do with 1b
01:16
you know so uh we've as we mentioned
01:20
before on this podcast a lot of bees in
01:21
america live on trucks and the reason
01:23
that they
01:25
lost they lost the home the marriage
01:27
broke
01:31
no it's because um they move around the
01:34
country all the time
01:35
uh to because they're rented out to
01:37
pollinate crops and they have this whole
01:39
like basically a tall schedule where
01:41
they move from area to area pollinating
01:43
a new crop every few weeks
01:44
and there's a massive crop the
01:47
californian
01:48
almond crop almond and that needs one
01:51
and a half
01:52
million bee hives which is a total of
01:55
at least 30 billion bees which is
01:58
amazing
01:59
they all arrive around the same time and
02:01
so they arrive they pollinate the crop
02:02
and then they go
02:03
um and an american beekeeper whose name
02:06
is randy oliver
02:09
has calculated the cost of it and he
02:11
worked out that the cost is one
02:12
uh penny one u.s penny in fact a bit
02:14
less than an english penny
02:16
uh per b per month one english penny
02:19
would get you one b for two months yeah
02:22
i think it's about 1.6 six weeks yeah
02:26
okay not worth it
02:29
it won't work for the holiday i'm
02:30
[Laughter]
02:34
thinking
02:36
yeah so you must you must get more than
02:38
one presumably you must do it in
02:39
yeah there's no there's no like number
02:42
of b's
02:43
and then the minimum option is one so
02:45
what i'm asking is what is the minimum
02:47
number of b's that i can hire
02:49
don't know okay you could probably i've
02:51
got a tenner in my pocket
02:53
it isn't it's a scottish tenner that
02:55
would get you
02:58
they won't accept that james
03:01
trust me hang on wait if it's one penny
03:05
let's just let's just say it's one penny
03:07
so
03:08
wait wait wait it's a thousand
03:13
i don't think that's enough i think you
03:15
might i think a minimum is probably at
03:16
least one hive
03:19
okay yeah um do you know how bees
03:21
collect pollen
03:23
i didn't know this it's so cool so um
03:25
they go and
03:26
bees will go out and they'll either be
03:27
collecting pollen or they'll be
03:28
collecting nectar they never do both at
03:30
once you don't want to mix those two
03:32
um and if they're collecting pollen they
03:34
get onto a flower and they get covered
03:35
in pollen because they've got you know
03:37
they're hairy they're furry and so
03:39
pollen sticks all over them but that's
03:40
okay because they've got
03:42
combs on their front four legs so they
03:44
use the combs on their front two legs to
03:46
comb the pollen
03:47
pollen out of their antennae ten eye and
03:50
they use the combs on their middle legs
03:51
to comb the pollen out of their fur on
03:53
their body
03:54
and then they've got these two kind of
03:55
buckets on their back legs which i think
03:57
they're called pollen baskets
03:59
and they're like literally i mean they
04:00
just look like little baskets on the
04:01
back of their legs wow and they crush
04:03
the pollen for once they've combed it
04:05
out of their hair into these two little
04:06
baskets
04:07
and then they carry it home in their
04:08
pollen baskets isn't that cool that's
04:10
very cool
04:10
yeah that's amazing the one really
04:13
amazing thing about bees is that they
04:15
have a positive charge
04:17
they're electric bees are electric
04:20
if you're putting them into a remote
04:21
control or
04:22
[Music]
04:23
do you get double b and triple b
04:26
batteries
04:28
[Applause]
04:33
so what happens so the b flies through
04:37
the air and it kind of hits
04:38
um hits particles in the air and that
04:41
gives it a positive charge a bit like if
04:42
you get a balloon and you rub it against
04:44
yourself and that gives the balloon a
04:45
charge it's a bit like static
04:46
but the flowers have a negative charge
04:49
and that means that when a bee goes into
04:50
a flower
04:51
the pollen will actually jump just jump
04:53
from the flower to the bee
04:55
wow using electricity this i've i've
04:58
read today um
04:59
bees don't pee or poo in space
05:04
why would you go just i don't go to
05:06
space to poo either well that was the
05:08
thing
05:08
yeah but if you were in space you would
05:10
at some point so oh i see so when we
05:12
send bees up there
05:13
yes so they hold three yeah yeah so a
05:15
bunch of bees were sent to space
05:17
and uh in space they they actually
05:19
started so a lot
05:20
a lot of little insects have been sent
05:22
to space particularly flying insects to
05:24
see
05:25
how they can cope with uh with flying
05:27
and there's i watched some amazing
05:28
footage today by the way
05:30
of uh the pigeons inside one of those
05:32
vomit rockets that go down
05:35
they let them loose so if you don't know
05:36
the vomit rocket it's where they film
05:38
zero gravity without leaving the earth's
05:40
atmosphere so you can do that
05:41
so actual astronauts use it to practice
05:44
being in zero
05:44
exactly so basically the plane is what
05:46
is it it's falling at the
05:48
so it goes up in in a parabola and it
05:50
kind of makes it feel like you're
05:52
weightless okay so you fly around and
05:54
yeah so on
05:55
and uh you do
05:58
so they brought pigeons on board and the
06:01
pigeons just didn't know what was going
06:02
on because they couldn't they were just
06:04
flying and
06:05
bumping into walls at one point a pigeon
06:07
is flying upside down
06:09
and the others are like what the it's
06:12
really confusing
06:13
that's that's where pigeons will get
06:15
their alien abduction stories
06:20
so they brought they brought a bunch of
06:22
bees into space and they
06:23
they brought house flies and their house
06:25
flies actually they say for house flies
06:27
it's a no-fly zone they just don't
06:29
bother
06:29
they don't even try they start trying
06:31
they can't fly
06:32
so either they just try and cling to the
06:35
wall or they just
06:36
stay still and just float everywhere
06:38
they go so housewives don't fly in space
06:40
right
06:41
bees kind of after about seven days
06:43
worked out what to do
06:44
and they managed to uh they even built a
06:46
honeycomb they even managed to
06:48
uh to make residents and um the the main
06:51
thing they noticed though is that they
06:53
just didn't go to the toilet they were
06:54
holding until they got back
06:55
to earth well i think it's because they
06:57
were put in an enclosed
06:59
hive a space hive weren't they and bees
07:01
do not defecate in their own hives
07:03
they don't where they eat and so
07:05
they literally thought well if i can't
07:07
get out of this
07:08
thing then i'm not going to poo in it
07:09
they're too polite so
07:11
they held it in for a week yeah yeah
07:13
because if they held it in thinking i'll
07:15
do it when i get back that's quite
07:17
optimistic because they're they're just
07:18
bees
07:19
they don't know that they're actually
07:20
gonna come back do they
07:22
wow yeah so interesting eh when they
07:24
went into space actually uh learned to
07:27
i think they were the smartest flying
07:28
creature they learned that they could
07:30
kind of float
07:31
in space so when you try to flap it
07:33
doesn't really work because you get so
07:34
disoriented but the moths in zero
07:36
gravity very quickly realized that they
07:37
could change the
07:38
method of flying and turn more into
07:40
seagulls and then they just sort of
07:41
floated around
07:42
on the air right yeah wow cool that's
07:45
very cool
07:46
very clever do you know why um honeybees
07:49
die when they sting you so most the vast
07:51
majority bees don't die when they sting
07:53
you
07:53
um but most honeybees do die when they
07:56
sting you
07:57
and it's because all of their insides
07:59
are falling out
08:00
so i know it's really sad what do you
08:02
mean so when they put their sting into
08:04
you i think human skin is a bit too hard
08:06
so they can't properly uh retract their
08:08
sort of barbed stinger as it comes out
08:11
so instead what it does is rather than
08:12
leaving behind just its sting as it
08:14
tries to pull away
08:15
it leaves the it leaves behind inside
08:17
you its digestive tract and its abdomen
08:19
and everything
08:20
so and then that is not really a anymore
08:22
just a lump of fluff um
08:29
[Music]
08:34
they mostly sting other insects or other
08:36
bees or yeah so that's that's what the
08:38
sting is really for and they have no
08:39
problem stinging
08:41
them without you know without that
08:42
happening right when they sting
08:44
something with really tough skin
08:45
and to to be we have really tuscan yeah
08:48
yeah uh we need to move on soon to the
08:49
next house
08:50
can i just talk about other things you
08:51
can rent yeah yeah
08:54
james
08:59
you were very lucky to get off with a
09:00
caution i don't think
09:04
guinea pigs you can rank guinea pigs
09:07
yeah
09:07
in switzerland you can rank guinea pigs
09:10
but only switzerland as far as i can
09:12
find
09:12
and that's because according to swiss
09:14
law it's illegal to have one guinea pig
09:17
on its own
09:18
you you need to have a second guinea pig
09:20
because they're really kind of
09:22
sociable creatures and if you have one
09:23
they get lonely
09:25
and so the swiss made a law against wow
09:27
and so what happens is
09:28
one of your guinea pigs dies and you're
09:30
like okay now i've only got one guinea
09:32
pig
09:33
i'm gonna have to get another one but
09:34
what would happen is you get a young one
09:37
and then the old one would die and then
09:39
you'd have to get another young one and
09:40
you'd just be in some horrible cycle of
09:42
just
09:43
always getting more and more guinea pigs
09:46
so some people have seen a gap in the
09:49
market and thought you know what we can
09:50
do
09:51
we can rent one until the second one
09:53
dies and that's the thing
09:55
i must say the the swiss parliament
09:57
really does have time on its hands
10:02
in japan you can rent an attractive man
10:06
to wipe away your tears
10:10
is there a phone number or a website
10:14
i ordered one for you he's backstage
10:18
yeah isn't this totally bizarre it's
10:20
definitely true
10:21
it's a tokyo-based company it's called
10:23
ikomiso danshi
10:24
and that means apparently roughly
10:26
translates as handsome weeping boys
10:29
um and it's if they're you know it's for
10:32
women specifically
10:33
uh and apparently women are prone to
10:35
going to the workplace or whatever and
10:37
bursting into tears and so we need to
10:39
hire
10:39
attractive weeping boys to come turn up
10:42
to the office
10:43
wipe away your tears and comfort you um
10:46
okay interestingly i have been to tokyo
10:49
and i have seen
10:50
the clubs they have which are kind of
10:52
just handsome young men clubs they're
10:54
for women they're aimed at women and
10:55
they their only women i
10:57
didn't go in but it's just sort of just
10:59
sort of like handsome young men
11:01
hanging around in there looking cool and
11:03
a bit emo and the bills are very
11:04
unreasonable as well
11:07
50 000 yen for a coke but that sort of
11:10
fits into that trend
11:11
yeah that's amazing it does yeah i'm
11:13
sorry that sounds dramatic for you
11:15
it's very good you've got um little olaf
11:17
waiting next door
11:18
it was a really good japanese name i
11:20
just said
11:21
[Laughter]
11:26
samurai
11:27
[Laughter]
11:31
we should move on to our next fact okay
11:34
it's time for fact number two and that
11:36
is my fact
11:37
my fact this week is that iceland
11:39
imports
11:40
ice yeah it actually does
11:44
in shops now you can get ice uh in
11:46
iceland it's in
11:47
particularly this one shop which is
11:49
called uh hot cup
11:51
and it's a sort of grocery store and
11:53
they they import ice you buy them in
11:55
blocks of four
11:56
and it doesn't make any sense at all
11:57
because the water in iceland
11:59
is uh rated a total hundred percent for
12:02
freshness so if they've got great water
12:04
that you can turn into ice
12:05
but they bring it in from norway so they
12:07
now import ice from norway
12:09
that's really good yeah i found this out
12:11
by uh via the twitter account of a guy
12:13
called yon nar
12:14
who was the mayor of reykjavik and
12:18
he was actually a comedian who hated
12:20
what was going on in the country
12:21
and he thought this is just i'm
12:23
going to run i'm going to run as mayor
12:24
of
12:25
reykjavik so he said i'm going to set up
12:26
a party they said what are you going to
12:28
call it he said
12:29
the best party will be the best party so
12:31
they set up the best party we've spoken
12:33
about this on the podcast before and he
12:35
uh he made all the promises that anyone
12:37
wanted him to make so he was like what
12:38
do you want i'll give you anything
12:40
and they said we want free towels you'll
12:41
have free towels but i may or everyone
12:43
will have free towels is that the first
12:44
thing that the people demanded
12:47
i think they wanted to test the grounds
12:48
first and see what he was going to go
12:50
for he did also say afterwards
12:52
by the way here's my main promise
12:53
whatever you ask for and i agree to i
12:55
will break once i become mayor
12:57
so when he became mayor he said you're
12:58
getting no free time
13:00
um i didn't know that uh britain exports
13:02
ice to china
13:05
yeah and to sweden uh british exports of
13:08
ice to china have tripled in the last
13:09
three years
13:10
wow probably from quite a low base
13:14
but still um we have a company there's a
13:17
company in
13:17
yorkshire called the ice company so not
13:20
very good name yeah not i mean
13:22
a descriptive name if nothing else um
13:24
and they make 500 tons of ice a day
13:26
they're in south kirkby in yorkshire
13:28
and this is the cool thing they so they
13:30
have these machines which make ice
13:32
uh massive machines and they make um 300
13:35
pound blocks of really
13:37
crystal clear you know beautiful looking
13:39
ice and
13:41
uh it's made in these huge freezing
13:42
compartments right and the water gets
13:44
frozen in cylinders and then you know
13:46
huge blades chop it up
13:47
and then the cubes of ice are blow-dried
13:50
so they don't stick to each other
13:52
whoa really yeah so somewhere there's
13:55
like somebody's job is to be an ice hair
13:57
dryer
13:58
isn't that weird that is weird well
14:01
clear ice
14:02
is very sought after and i think this
14:03
might be why this norwegian ice has been
14:05
imported
14:06
because i think it's for it's mr iceman
14:08
isn't it yes which
14:09
again is a very good name and it uh
14:12
so i went to the mr iceman website and
14:14
it's the mr iceman ice that's now being
14:16
sold
14:16
um in iceland and they advertise the
14:20
fact that they've got the hardest ice in
14:22
the world
14:23
uh so you can if your fee is a special
14:26
occasion you drop one of these blocks of
14:27
ice in your whiskey and it takes twice
14:29
as long to melt
14:30
as an ordinary block of ice so that's
14:32
that's what everyone wants it says for
14:34
those that appreciate a whiskey cold but
14:36
not diluted
14:37
they will cherish the ice block which is
14:39
actually quite a good idea
14:40
do you know the queen likes ice but she
14:43
does she
14:44
that's a great fact but she doesn't like
14:47
the noise that ice makes
14:49
in the glass does she have special
14:51
flunkies
14:52
to whenever the ice is getting close to
14:54
the edge of the glass just dip their
14:55
finger in
14:57
and let it rebound off i don't think the
15:00
queen would like fingers in there
15:03
she drinks chin and do do bonnet or
15:05
dubonne
15:06
it's her favorite drink and she hates
15:08
the noise that the ice makes
15:10
and so her favorite flunky prince philip
15:12
invented a machine
15:14
he invented a machine that makes tiny
15:16
ice balls that don't grate against each
15:18
other and so now she can have her drink
15:20
and it doesn't make any noise
15:21
he invented prince philip invented a
15:23
machine yeah
15:27
i mean they say it's tough at the top
15:28
but i had no idea
15:31
just how tough it was well they make
15:34
sure that makes tiny ice
15:36
tiny little ice balls those are popular
15:38
i've heard about them in uh fancy bars
15:40
and things they have they have sort of
15:42
hand-carved ice balls which are right
15:44
yeah wow
15:45
and some unusual imports oh yeah yeah
15:48
okay so
15:49
germany imports lederhosen
15:52
really there's only a hundred others
15:53
fewer than 100 uh businesses making
15:56
lederhosen left in germany and they get
15:57
most of them from china now
16:00
that's one thing australia imports dingo
16:02
urine
16:04
imports yeah where are the dingos
16:06
outside australia i think the thing is
16:08
with bingo urine it's quite important
16:10
that you have to get it from a captive
16:12
bingo you can't just go into the wild
16:13
and just grab a dingo
16:15
and like a lot of zoos around the world
16:17
have bingos in them and so they get the
16:19
urine from these places
16:20
and then they import them into australia
16:22
and they use them to deter
16:23
other animals and make fosters
16:30
it's not true i don't think it's even
16:31
made in australia and i'm drinking it
16:32
now i love it so
16:33
i feel really bad about that comment for
16:35
a number of reasons
16:37
uh and it's illegal to bring dirty
16:39
mattresses
16:40
into canada what what you're not allowed
16:42
to import a dirty mattress into canada
16:45
you have to have it fumigated and you
16:47
need a letter from the fumigator proving
16:49
that you've done
16:50
it i wouldn't want someone bringing a
16:53
dirty mattress into my house
16:56
and what what is a country but a big
16:57
house
16:59
doesn't canada mean large village in
17:02
like an old um
17:03
not native american um language i don't
17:06
know it does
17:06
okay sorry i believe it when you say
17:09
when you say doesn't this you mean this
17:11
is a thing
17:13
um france imports all its prospects
17:15
doesn't it
17:16
how does it yeah from southeast asia uh
17:19
yeah
17:19
i think mainly from uh the philippines
17:21
indonesia mainly from indonesia and some
17:23
from japan and yeah i think frog
17:25
frog farming is now illegal in france or
17:29
um yeah i think you can't really farm
17:30
frogs in france but they still consume
17:32
them and so they get them all from
17:33
southeast asia and they're becoming
17:34
massively endangered
17:35
frogs in southeast asia lots because the
17:37
french eat about
17:38
an incredible number of tons of frogs
17:40
legs a year wow yeah so
17:42
it's very bad it doesn't need um corpses
17:45
uh the corpse trade
17:46
is picking up i think it's a problem in
17:49
some countries like turkey
17:50
that um uh people don't want to donate
17:53
their bodies after they've died and so
17:54
there's a
17:55
cadaver shortage is it for like
17:57
dissection and it's for dissection uh
17:59
yeah so for medical purposes and for
18:01
like crash test dummies so if they're
18:03
testing um
18:04
airplanes and things like that they use
18:06
they do that they don't yeah they don't
18:07
tell you that when it's the uh donate
18:09
your body to science
18:11
um they sit you in cars andy this is
18:13
true they sit you
18:15
who is they
18:18
they sit you in cars and they just slam
18:20
the cars into walls
18:21
and they see because with a crash test
18:23
dummy a real crash test on me you can't
18:25
tell
18:26
what things will break in an actual
18:28
crash so it's saving people it's all
18:29
blown up by a land mine that's another
18:31
potential option
18:33
they test land mines on which i would
18:35
have thought it's very obvious if a land
18:36
mine blows
18:37
stuff up it blows stuff up but no they
18:39
just uh
18:40
but then the important thing with that
18:42
is you need to know if there's a body
18:44
part this distance away
18:45
where was the original landmine so it's
18:47
all that kind of thing
18:48
this is all very important science andy
18:51
they actually someone invented just on
18:52
landmines someone has invented
18:54
uh this is quite a while ago seeds that
18:58
you scatter out into fields and when the
19:00
plants grow
19:01
they touch the landmine metal and so
19:03
what would otherwise be let's say a
19:04
yellow flower
19:06
then goes red so for all these countries
19:08
that still have unblasted landmines
19:10
where you can now see them it's quite a
19:11
beautiful solution they say to
19:13
to how you can dying yeah it's it's yeah
19:17
you've got these unless you don't know
19:18
that they've done that and you want to
19:20
pick a nice bunch of flowers
19:22
and these
19:30
and that's valentine's day ruined
19:35
uh we need to move on to the next rank
19:37
okay let's move on should we go for it
19:38
yeah yeah
19:39
okay it is time for fact number three
19:41
and that is james harkin
19:42
okay my fact this week is that the most
19:45
dangerous invasive species in britain
19:48
is a poo eating mussel from transylvania
19:53
it's true it's true this is a really bad
19:56
evil muscle that's coming from
19:57
transylvania
19:59
uh and they are blocking up our toilets
20:02
uh i would have thought they'd be
20:03
helping relieve the blocked toilets
20:06
yes that's a good point but they have to
20:08
live there and they are
20:10
really really good at reproducing and uh
20:13
one female is capable of producing one
20:15
million babies in a year
20:17
oh yeah what's she called
20:21
so how are they getting here um that you
20:23
would get on ships
20:24
yeah and things like that so when a ship
20:27
is going from one place to another they
20:29
actually collect water
20:30
from one area to kind of keep the
20:32
ballast and then when they get to the
20:34
other place they'll often release it and
20:35
then you'll end up with species moving
20:36
from one place to another
20:38
it's like the bees it's exactly like the
20:39
bees okay yeah
20:41
now the bees of the ocean yeah yeah it's
20:43
basically it's our fault
20:45
[Laughter]
20:46
it's not their fault they were happy in
20:48
transylvania we brought them over and
20:50
they did what they did
20:51
although it's not just humans that can
20:53
bring invasive species because i went to
20:55
a glasgow um museum today and they said
20:58
that there's
20:59
uh what was it it was a it was a plant
21:01
called spearwatt
21:02
and that's been brought to this area and
21:04
it's causing a real problem and it was
21:06
brought on the feet of geese
21:08
so when they flew over from i think from
21:10
africa they carried this little plant
21:12
over and now it's become an invasive
21:13
species so it's not always us
21:15
geese
21:16
[Laughter]
21:20
guys so muscles get a bad reputation
21:22
don't they
21:23
they've got if you look up muscles
21:25
there's pretty much no one's got a good
21:26
word to say about them they're invasive
21:28
species
21:29
everywhere and they're a problem in the
21:31
great lakes in america i think
21:32
um so these are they quagga mussels
21:36
yeah quaggas quaggas um and zebra uh
21:39
america they have zebra ones and here
21:41
they we have quaggas but they're both
21:43
named after
21:44
sort of horse-like creatures oh yeah
21:46
because a quagga is like an extinct type
21:48
of
21:48
zebra right isn't it what's up with that
21:53
quagga mussels one of the things they do
21:55
to the native species of mussels they
21:58
literally
21:58
sit on them and kill them by doing that
22:01
so
22:02
i know they physically push them into
22:04
the sediment on on river bases and
22:05
things like that and the sort of the
22:06
native species are
22:07
crushed and one of the species which is
22:10
at risk one of the native species of
22:12
muscle is called sudanodonta complanata
22:15
and its common name is the depressed
22:17
river mussel
22:19
what a grimly prophetic name
22:24
but yeah they ruin ecosys like
22:26
ecosystems don't they so in
22:27
in great lakes uh they eat all the algae
22:31
i think which then stops feeding
22:32
organisms which then feed other
22:33
organisms and it wipes out
22:35
everything and so you'll just have a
22:36
lake full of mussels which is a disaster
22:38
yeah but i think they shouldn't get such
22:39
a bad rep because they
22:41
are um natural water filters
22:44
you could just drop a muscle in some
22:46
dirty water and then drink it a little
22:48
bit later
22:49
you couldn't do that but um they do
22:52
they do sieve water so when they are uh
22:54
when they're looking for a meal
22:56
then they uh they take the water in and
22:58
they filter it through their tissues
23:00
and they absorb some of the stuff that
23:01
they want from the water and then they
23:02
release the rest of it
23:04
and what they absorb are a lot of the
23:06
horrible chemicals in the ocean
23:08
so they'll absorb herbicides they'll
23:09
absorb like flame retardants they'll
23:11
absorb a lot of the poisons that we put
23:12
into the oceans
23:13
um and they will release purified water
23:16
so they're using that to remove
23:17
contaminants in quite a lot of lakes
23:19
well of course that's one of the reasons
23:20
why they make us so sick if you have a
23:22
bad one because
23:23
they're kind of filtering dirty water
23:25
and leaving nice water but they keep all
23:27
the nasty things that make people sick
23:29
and then if you get a bad one yeah
23:31
that's why you get sick yeah
23:33
so this quagga one of the reasons it's
23:34
quite bad is not only does that eat
23:36
human
23:37
excrement but there are other animals
23:39
that eat its excrement
23:41
and one of them is a killer shrimp that
23:43
they call the pink peril
23:45
and whenever it comes into any
23:50
whenever it goes into any lake it kills
23:52
all the other shrimp sir
23:53
um and so these two guys always kind of
23:56
co-invade
23:57
um lakes or rivers so whenever there's a
24:00
mussel there there's always the killer
24:01
pink shrimp there as well
24:02
and that's why it's like doubly bad
24:04
that's mortifying isn't it you're not
24:05
even the guy who eats the poo
24:08
the guy who eats the poo of the guy who
24:10
eats the poop
24:14
wow you know there's actually animals
24:16
now that disguise themselves
24:18
as poo so that they don't get eaten is
24:20
that right yeah so
24:21
they would if the muscle was around
24:22
they'd be in big trouble but most
24:24
animals
24:25
don't eat them so they there's one
24:27
that's called the moth caterpillar so
24:29
the moth caterpillar
24:30
does have sort of little white bits on
24:32
it and little brown bit
24:33
and it will disguise itself in a sitting
24:34
position to look like bird droppings so
24:36
it's just
24:37
quite safe any time a bird sees it
24:39
thinks oh that's poo i'm not going to
24:40
risk it this time so you've got the the
24:43
moth caterpillar there's the orb weaving
24:45
spider
24:46
uh there's a giant swallowtail butterfly
24:48
and then this one's really on the nose
24:49
bird dropping spiders and they they all
24:52
do that they all disguise themselves
24:54
it's the
24:54
evolutionary thing and yet then they
24:56
give themselves that giveaway name
24:58
it's sort of like what was
25:03
they should have called themselves just
25:04
some bird droppings nothing to see here
25:09
so nasa have actually asked the
25:11
community of scientists around the world
25:14
and and said there will be a prize for
25:16
this if you can convert
25:17
poo into an eating product because when
25:20
we go for these long-haul missions to
25:21
mars
25:22
you are going to need everything that
25:24
you can get to be reused as
25:26
potential source for something and they
25:28
think poo might be what we can use for
25:30
food
25:30
and what is the judging panel of this
25:32
competition
25:38
actually you know heston blumenthal has
25:40
now contributed to space
25:42
food yeah so tim peake the british uh
25:44
astronaut who's gone up in space
25:46
he uh worked with heston blumenthal and
25:49
his people
25:50
and they've created a bacon sandwich
25:52
that can be made
25:53
and eaten and a cup of tea that can be
25:55
made and drunk and they're made out of
25:56
two
25:57
where they didn't tell tim that but yeah
26:00
yeah so that's quite cool so heston's
26:01
already getting into space
26:02
great um speaking of defecation and
26:05
transylvania which is where
26:07
these um this muscle comes from
26:11
there's the salina turde salt mine which
26:14
is this huge
26:15
salt mine and uh it was a salt mine
26:16
until 1932 so it's massive i think it's
26:19
in the capital the biggest city in
26:20
transylvania
26:21
um and it sounds like the coolest
26:23
holiday ever now
26:24
have you seen it really so they
26:26
converted it so it's this uh massive
26:29
expanse of mine
26:30
uh under the main city there and they've
26:33
turned it into basically a theme park
26:35
it's this underground theme park they
26:36
did this in 1992
26:38
so it's got um this massive 180 seat
26:41
amphitheater
26:42
it's got uh basketball courts it's got
26:45
like ping pong tables it's got mini golf
26:47
it's got bowling
26:48
you get carried around this under this
26:50
big underground theme park in the old
26:51
machinery that was used for mining once
26:54
they've got a huge underground lake and
26:56
you can go on the lake and little boats
26:58
they've got this ferris wheel
26:59
that takes you up around it and you can
27:00
look at the stalactites and the
27:02
stalagmites as you go around on it
27:03
and they've transformed this disused
27:05
salt mine they didn't know what to do
27:06
with for
27:07
50 years into the best theme park in the
27:10
world
27:10
sounds amazing yeah we should go there
27:14
and that's in turta that's in turda yeah
27:17
the edict of turder is quite a famous
27:18
thing which is
27:19
i think it was a kind of thing where it
27:22
meant that in transylvania everyone was
27:24
allowed to have any religion they wanted
27:25
and it was one of the first places in
27:27
the world that had this
27:28
and i have this theory that that's why
27:30
kind of people think of transylvania as
27:31
kind of this
27:32
weird kind of gothic place because the
27:34
catholic church
27:36
saw that it was a place where anyone
27:37
could have any religion they wanted and
27:38
they kind of
27:39
didn't like it ah yeah i think it might
27:41
be because they had a leader called
27:43
the impaler who hailed hundreds of
27:45
thousands of people on spikes
27:47
they're a good size science in this
27:50
argument
27:51
let's uh let's move on to our final fact
27:53
of the show and that
27:54
is jacinski yeah my fact is that until
27:58
about 4 000 years ago humans didn't
28:00
notice the color blue
28:02
or most humans didn't notice the color
28:04
blue okay
28:06
just escape their notice this so i'd not
28:08
heard of this before
28:10
and i so since reading into it it's it's
28:13
really fascinating it's amazing so the
28:15
idea effectively
28:17
is that there was they someone looked
28:19
through all
28:20
the old literature that we have any bit
28:22
of writing ancient iceland
28:23
uh homer's odyssey all that sort of
28:25
stuff and anytime that there should have
28:26
been a reference to blue they used a
28:28
different color and so the idea is that
28:30
they actually think that maybe
28:32
because there was no word describing it
28:34
we just didn't notice
28:35
the sky which is where i'm looking at
28:38
the big
28:38
blue thing in the sky and as a result of
28:41
not naming it it was just blended into
28:43
different colors
28:44
yeah it is extremely controversial that
28:46
yeah so this is a
28:47
this is a very controversial it's a
28:49
controversial idea but i think what
28:51
corroborates it really
28:52
nicely is that so this guy who went
28:54
through all these ancient texts and it
28:55
was from
28:56
many different uh cultures so yeah
28:59
greece china
29:00
japan uh hebrew languages none of them
29:03
had the word for the color blue um they
29:05
started off all having black and white
29:07
they were the first
29:08
words to color words to appear and then
29:09
red was the next one
29:11
and then yellows and greens came in and
29:13
then blue as last
29:14
and the idea that maybe people weren't
29:16
really noticing blue
29:18
or sort of couldn't distinguish it from
29:19
others it does make a bit of sense
29:22
when you look at this research that was
29:23
done by a guy called jules davidoff and
29:26
he did this research in namibia with the
29:27
himba tribe
29:28
and the himba tribe uh does not have a
29:31
word for blue at all
29:32
and you can look this up it's really
29:34
really cool to do what he did was he
29:35
showed
29:36
members of the himba tribe a series of i
29:38
think it was 12 dots
29:40
and 11 of them were bright green and one
29:42
of them was bright blue
29:43
and he said which one is the blue one
29:45
and they couldn't tell
29:47
they just didn't know it all the same to
29:48
them and so they really couldn't
29:49
distinguish it
29:50
but then that tribe has many many more
29:53
words for green than we have
29:55
and they showed them a 12 green circles
29:58
and said which one is the different
29:59
shade of green
30:00
and if you look at the green circles you
30:03
cannot tell
30:04
i can't tell which one was the lightest
30:05
shade of green and everyone who they
30:07
tested
30:08
immediately spotted the lighter shade of
30:09
green but the idea is that because they
30:11
have
30:11
more words to describe it and to
30:14
distinguish between them
30:15
that we sort of learn we automatically
30:18
learn to distinguish that
30:19
i think it's a really really interesting
30:20
idea yeah it's amazing there's another
30:22
kind of fact which isn't really a fact
30:24
which no one could actually see the
30:25
color blue
30:26
uh or maybe they were colorblind or
30:28
something back in the day and the idea
30:29
is
30:30
uh homer wrote about the sea and he said
30:32
it was the wine dark sea
30:34
and people are like why is he saying
30:35
wine dark instead of blue
30:37
wine dark yeah because when you see the
30:39
sea in the evening
30:41
at sunset it does it can look the color
30:43
of wine
30:44
maybe all their wine was bright blue
30:46
yeah it's just no one's mentioned
30:48
well there is a theory that they um in
30:50
those days they used to add water to the
30:51
wine because the wine was a lot kind of
30:53
stronger so they'd have water to it
30:55
and the water might have had a high
30:56
alkaline content which made it look a
30:58
bit more blue
30:59
and they made their wine look a bit more
31:00
blue that seems like a little bit like
31:02
clutching at straws to me
31:04
i don't think we'll ever resolve this
31:05
argument one way or the other it is
31:06
amazing to think of it though it's
31:07
very very cool i went onto a website
31:09
called xkcd
31:10
like you guys must know this it's a web
31:12
comic and randall monroe is in tonight
31:16
and so it's a webcomic by randall munro
31:19
and he kind of um
31:20
explains things and he did um a really
31:22
good kind of study where he looked at
31:24
colors
31:24
and he had men and women looking at all
31:27
different colors and saw how they
31:28
described them
31:29
to see if there was any difference and
31:31
they found that actually men and women
31:32
was pretty much the same
31:34
apart from women tend to add more things
31:36
like light green and lime green whereas
31:38
men would just say something's green
31:40
just green it's just green
31:44
but why
31:48
[Laughter]
31:59
sorry jake so what he did what he did
32:02
was that was kind of a general thing but
32:04
he looked at all the different things
32:05
that people had said
32:06
and tried to find which were the most
32:07
male comments and which were the most
32:10
female comments so these are the colors
32:12
that women said much more often than men
32:14
so dusty teal blush pink
32:18
dusty lavender butter yellow and dusky
32:21
rose
32:22
so they were things that women said that
32:24
men really didn't say
32:25
and the things that men said that women
32:27
really didn't say for colours
32:29
were penis
32:30
[Laughter]
32:36
i mean it's not that is not one country
32:39
star
32:41
it's just green night
32:47
you've got to see a doctor
32:53
look at this beautiful grass as green as
32:54
my people
33:00
[Music]
33:03
yeah so um penis uh
33:06
dunno uh beige spelt with an a
33:12
and wtf
33:16
wow wow yeah apparently women can't see
33:18
those colors
33:19
[Laughter]
33:22
true true facts
33:25
speaking of penises i found
33:28
[Music]
33:30
and and and the color blue
33:34
scientists have worked out how now to if
33:37
they they can flash a blue light at your
33:39
eyes
33:40
and give you an erection it's
33:43
a really new thing that's happening at
33:45
the moment um at the moment
33:49
at the moment they've only been able to
33:51
give myself actions
33:54
but they're working on it for humans and
33:56
the idea is that it stimulates
33:58
a thing inside your eye that leads
34:00
directly to a part
34:01
of your penis which i wrote down it's
34:03
called the uh
34:06
i don't think that's the important part
34:10
it's called corpus cavernosum uh it's a
34:12
region that gets filled up with blood to
34:14
facilitate an erection so it kind of you
34:16
see this light and it kind of just opens
34:18
it up and it can it you can go
34:20
crazy and uh and i i actually i don't
34:23
understand the science of it but i was
34:25
really hardened to read the mainstream
34:30
that's that was carton wasn't it
34:35
[Laughter]
34:40
[Applause]
34:46
go on you're around to realize yeah
34:49
so the guy the scientist is working on
34:51
it he calls it a rectilio
34:54
genetic stimulator uh and when he was
34:57
asked about it
34:58
so he said uh it's quite simple once you
35:00
get past the gene therapy
35:02
part of it shine a blue light cause dick
35:04
to get hard
35:05
and that's that's basically the science
35:08
it's yeah it's amazing it's to do with
35:10
an algae as well it's apparently a bit
35:12
of an algae that they've taken out
35:13
and i don't know if like you know
35:17
i don't know if i've ever mentioned this
35:18
about the new alternative to viagra
35:21
which is um playing sounds to your penis
35:25
yeah it's like viagra it doesn't always
35:27
work and sometimes it has side effects
35:29
but this is the thing they get a machine
35:30
they put it on the men's
35:32
parts and they play very very high
35:34
clicks like this
35:36
do you like dolphins a bit much
35:40
is this a very very coded way of telling
35:42
us
35:44
about your awakening when you saw
35:45
flipper
35:47
but it does work it does work that's
35:49
incredible it kind of
35:50
excites the blood vessels to kind of
35:53
open
35:54
wow wow this is real science people i
35:58
mean i've got a fact about eyes and
35:59
color perception but
36:01
i'm not sure we can go back i'd be
36:04
really happy if we went back
36:06
okay yeah let's go back to ice yeah okay
36:08
um tarantulas have
36:10
evolved uh to be blue or for parts of
36:13
them to be blue
36:14
separately on eight different occasions
36:16
in nature and we don't know why
36:19
why do we keep forgetting how to be blue
36:20
and having to re-evolve it
36:22
when they branched off into separate i
36:23
think it's separate genuses and separate
36:25
species
36:26
or maybe it's separate species within
36:28
the same genus they have
36:30
independently in the once they've
36:31
branched off
36:34
no idea and they don't have good color
36:36
vision so it's not like they know
36:38
that's the really weird thing and it's
36:40
not driven by sexual selection because
36:41
they can't see when each other are blue
36:43
they have no idea um they can't tell so
36:46
we have no idea maybe it hides them from
36:48
their prey or maybe it
36:49
you know has some other effect but yeah
36:51
wow how weird um
36:54
i i was reading that you can now get
36:56
your eyes turned blue if you have brown
36:57
eyes
36:58
uh for five thousand dollars the idea is
37:00
that actually
37:01
right behind every brown eye is a blue
37:03
eye because it's all to do with color so
37:05
you can actually burn away the brown and
37:07
sitting behind it is the natural blue
37:08
yeah so people are doing this now they
37:10
say that babies all have blue eyes i
37:11
don't know if it's true but they do say
37:13
that
37:13
they say all babies have very pale blue
37:15
eyes for the first few days
37:16
and then they sort themselves out and
37:19
get their acts together
37:21
that's really cool if i hadn't recently
37:22
spent all my money renting these i would
37:24
definitely burn my eyes
37:27
let's wrap up should we wrap up okay
37:29

00:00
[Music]
00:11
hello
00:12
and welcome to another episode of no
00:13
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:15
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:17
covent garden my name is dan schreiber i
00:19
am sitting here with anna chazinski
00:21
james harkin and andy murray
00:23
and once again we have gathered around
00:24
the microphones with our four favorite
00:26
facts from the last seven days
00:28
and in no particular order here we go
00:30
starting with you
00:31
james okay my fact this week is that in
00:34
1921
00:35
the news of the world offered a free tea
00:37
tray to any mother
00:38
on the birth of her tenth child right
00:42
why was it doing that well the reason
00:44
was it had just been the war
00:46
and also there was um contraception
00:49
widespreadly available now which there
00:50
wasn't before
00:51
and the newspapers had a bit of a kind
00:54
of moral crisis about there being not
00:56
enough children
00:57
in the uk and so they wanted to
00:58
encourage children the
01:00
daily express for instance had a
01:01
britain's largest family competition
01:03
at the same time but the idea of the
01:06
news of the world was that
01:07
a woman would genuinely be induced to
01:10
think
01:10
actually i won't stop at three i'll go
01:12
all the way up to 10 children because
01:14
once i get to 10
01:15
i'll get a tea tree it's interesting
01:17
isn't it what stage
01:18
after how many children do you go i
01:20
might as well carry on for the tea tree
01:22
now
01:23
i have a theory that the unless tea
01:26
trees have massively depreciated in
01:28
value
01:28
that the cost of rearing a child would
01:30
not be offset by
01:32
the value of the tea tree and i think
01:35
that's pretty solid theory actually do
01:37
you think that's solid economics i
01:38
wonder how often they made i wonder how
01:39
many tea trees they had to give away
01:41
do you think they just no one actually
01:43
went for it because in the end it's only
01:44
a tea tree and when the news of the
01:45
world shut down what they had to clear
01:47
out of their offices were
01:48
50 000 tea trades that's a good point
01:51
when did that deal expire if they're
01:53
running the competition for a year say
01:55
it only applies to people who've
01:56
realistically got nine children
01:58
and can get pregnant within the next
01:59
three months yeah maybe it was running
02:01
all the way until the news the world
02:03
closed
02:04
like last year or the year before maybe
02:06
that's what sent them down
02:07
yeah someone finally claimed the tea
02:09
tree no it was massive phone hacking
02:12
let's be clear we should we should for
02:14
overseas listeners news of the world
02:15
was a massive newspaper here it came out
02:18
every sunday
02:18
and uh they got caught for a big hacking
02:21
scandal
02:22
uh of people's mobile phones and so
02:24
rupert murdoch had to shut it down there
02:26
was so much pressure
02:27
um i was looking into things that have
02:28
been given away for free um
02:30
here's one free thing that was given
02:32
away that i'm very annoyed to learn
02:34
because i've found out it's no longer
02:35
going but ettie had
02:37
um had a promotion whereby if it rained
02:41
while you're in abu dhabi you would get
02:43
a free trip
02:44
off the back of it it had a guarantee
02:47
sunshine or your next holiday free
02:49
you're going to um abu dhabi soon aren't
02:50
you yeah i'm going in about two weeks
02:52
well maybe if you say etti had enough
02:53
time he's about to get a free trip
02:55
that's true
02:55
i do love that who was the company etsy
02:58
what do they do they're an airline
03:00
they're an airline they're the best out
03:01
there actually they've been voted number
03:02
one airlines actually i think
03:04
they're awful
03:04
[Laughter]
03:07
good luck getting that free trip down um
03:10
have you guys heard of newspaper
03:11
insurance uh no no
03:13
if you subscribed and you got a medical
03:16
condition
03:16
the newspaper would pay you some money
03:18
and they would print
03:20
massive columns full of people who had
03:22
won money or
03:23
been given money so um in 1922
03:26
if you got appendicitis and you
03:28
subscribe to the express you get a
03:30
tenner
03:30
which quite a lot of money wow yeah when
03:32
how long ago this is the 20s
03:34
a tenner of today's money or no back
03:37
then
03:38
they wouldn't have known how much
03:39
today's money was they've time traveled
03:42
into the future they were so rich in
03:44
those days um actually so one of the
03:46
earliest newspapers
03:47
was uh called ichabod dork's newsletter
03:51
and i think this
03:51
works that's one of those things i wrote
03:55
down
03:56
completely fine it's d-a-w-k so there's
03:58
nothing funny about that at all actually
04:00
you can't get many ichabods these days i
04:02
think it's a very nice name
04:04
i think so as well if you're about to
04:06
have your 10 child
04:07
why not call it ichabod we will send you
04:09
a free no such thing as a fish mug
04:11
we'll genuinely do we can promise that
04:13
right yeah we can promise that
04:14
okay we need evidence we need a birthday
04:16
yeah the price of rearing the baby do
04:18
you think that's going to be offset by
04:19
the price of
04:20
those such thing as a fish they are
04:22
extremely valuable
04:23
in the world yeah i should finish this
04:26
off so mr dork's newsletter
04:28
was one of the first newspapers and um
04:30
it came with a blank space
04:32
in every edition so that you could buy
04:34
it and the blank space was for you to
04:36
write your own personal news
04:37
because then you'd send it to your
04:38
friends and relatives that's a really
04:40
good idea
04:40
yeah it's such a good idea because
04:42
people would share newspapers it used to
04:43
be that one newspaper people estimated
04:45
it would be read by about 20 to 30
04:46
people
04:47
yeah yeah because often it was read out
04:49
loud as well wasn't it i missed
04:50
i don't miss those days because i didn't
04:52
actually live in the 19th century but
04:54
i would if i had missed those days when
04:56
um
04:57
there would be a literate person and
04:59
then people who couldn't read as well or
05:00
people who just wanted to hear the
05:01
newspaper read out
05:02
and they'd all crowd around and clamor
05:04
to have the news read out in the 19th
05:06
century
05:06
and then someone would read it out
05:07
wouldn't that be great i can't imagine
05:09
sitting down in the 19th century with
05:11
your grandfather on his chair and he
05:13
opens up the newspaper and says gather
05:15
round everyone gather round
05:17
towie starring three in a bedroom
05:22
this is the thing about the news of the
05:23
world is that it was a crime newspaper
05:25
for the first
05:26
few decades yeah well they specialized
05:29
in
05:29
you know gruesome murders and also in
05:31
vic has caught an impropriety and things
05:33
like that
05:33
yeah news of the world was always uh
05:35
trashy and scandalous it wasn't because
05:37
i thought maybe
05:38
you'd read back into its history and you
05:39
find out that it used to be a
05:40
well-respected paper but it was always
05:42
yeah really gossipy and full of
05:44
lewd things and murders and uh in at the
05:46
very start of the 20th century the
05:48
editor of the palm oil gazette i think a
05:50
more high brow paper uh who was called
05:53
frederick greenwood uh went up to the
05:55
editor of the news of the world and said
05:57
uh he'd looked at the paper once and
06:00
then he'd immediately put it in his
06:01
waste paper basket
06:02
and then he thought if i leave it there
06:03
the cook may read it so i burned it
06:08
there was a bloke who a couple of years
06:09
ago found a first edition
06:11
of the news of the world which was from
06:12
1843 uh he was called william march age
06:15
72 and he found it in his attic
06:18
and he said i was just clearing stuff
06:20
out and i just found it there
06:21
i was going to dump it but then i saw
06:23
the date it cost just three pence and
06:25
it's just eight pages
06:26
i have looked through it and it is a bit
06:28
boring
06:28
[Laughter]
06:31
there used to be newspapers or magazines
06:33
which
06:34
were exclusively for lonely hearts
06:36
adverts
06:37
all the way through the 19th century so
06:39
the first one was called matrimonial
06:40
news
06:41
and then it was followed in rapid
06:43
succession by
06:44
the marriage gazette matrimonial times
06:46
matrimonial record matrimonial herald
06:48
aristocratic matrimonial
06:50
marriage envoy marriage advertiser
06:52
matrimonial chronicle matrimonial world
06:54
matrimonial courier
06:56
honeymoon matrimonial intelligence and
06:58
matrimonial register
06:59
ironically all bought by people who
07:01
weren't married exactly
07:03
what a misnomer why aren't they saying
07:05
desperate singleton
07:07
gazette
07:12
okay time for fact number two and that
07:15
is andrew hunter murray
07:17
my fact is that belgium fishermen go
07:19
fishing on horseback
07:22
and they drown in their thousands um
07:25
do they no they don't yeah they no they
07:27
fish just on the coast and they're
07:29
fishing for shrimp
07:30
okay so they're not on like big boats on
07:33
horses
07:33
to be honest i thought in the river
07:35
rather than on the coast i'm even
07:36
surprised that it's on the coast yeah
07:38
yeah yeah and they have really really
07:39
strong horses because the horses are up
07:41
to the top of their legs in water and
07:42
obviously it's quite hard to wade
07:43
through that
07:44
especially if you're a horse and you've
07:45
got more legs um and then once you're
07:47
dealing with the vast weight of shrimps
07:49
on top of that
07:49
yeah yeah yeah and so they pull a net
07:52
behind them and they also put a chain in
07:53
front of the net and the chain stirs up
07:55
the shrimps and it frightens them a bit
07:56
and it means they flee into the net
07:58
and then you have yeah um not many
08:01
people do this anymore unfortunately ie
08:03
12 households do it still
08:06
because it's not very profitable anymore
08:08
and are they using rods
08:10
or spears no they're using neither
08:13
why would it be rods or spears oh i
08:15
thought they would be looking at the
08:16
fish swimming past them and they would
08:19
or they would sit there with a rod just
08:20
fishing have you ever tried to spear a
08:22
shrimp
08:24
you're gonna have really good aim that's
08:26
true yeah you know all skewered kebabs
08:29
that's how they make them yeah it's
08:31
really annoying because you have to wait
08:32
for them to line up in just the right
08:34
order
08:36
so some other ways of catching fish yeah
08:38
and there's some good ones in america
08:40
they had a thing called telephoning
08:42
what you would do is you would take a
08:43
telephone off the wall they had like a
08:45
magnetic coil in there and you would
08:47
kind of
08:47
ramp that up and so it got electric and
08:49
then you put the wires in the water
08:51
stun all of the fish and then just grab
08:53
them
08:54
and then what people would do was then
08:55
get the phone put it back on the wall
08:57
and ring their friends up and say guess
08:58
what i've done today
08:59
no another one is called catfisting
09:03
what no yeah catfisting and that is
09:07
exactly what it sounds like i don't
09:08
think it's going to be executive
09:10
you put your fist into the water and the
09:13
catfish kind of grabs onto it and then
09:14
you pull your fist out and the catfish
09:16
is on your hands so you're using your
09:17
fist as bait
09:19
i had the opposite in my head in that
09:20
you fist a cat
09:22
you put that under the water and the cat
09:24
then catches a fish
09:27
so i was really close it was so close
09:30
that yeah but cats love
09:32
fish that's what i was thinking so
09:34
they're kind of jointly hating it and
09:36
loving it at the same time it's a roller
09:37
coaster of emotions
09:38
that's also noodling isn't it and i
09:40
think it's really dangerous because uh
09:42
it often involves diving to
09:44
quite low depths because the catfish
09:46
live in holes and you dive to low depths
09:48
and i think
09:49
people drown or they get i think it's
09:51
got a high
09:52
high injury rate it's a good thing that
09:53
cats have nine lives in that case
09:55
[Music]
09:55
[Laughter]
09:57
you can catch eight catfish i
10:00
i have a couple of things on belgium and
10:02
i really like this now i i think like
10:04
how you're saying there's only about 12
10:05
families left that do this kind of
10:07
fishing
10:07
i don't know if this is a national sport
10:09
but it's certainly been documented
10:11
um it's called yourself rich and
10:13
it's it's a really cool idea uh the
10:15
sport involves
10:16
it you divide a field up into an
10:18
imaginary grid
10:19
and everyone starts having a bet where
10:21
the cow in that field
10:23
will have a poo and whoever gets it
10:25
right then gets the money so it's
10:27
basically a lot of belgians watching a
10:29
cow in a field
10:30
waiting for it to poo with money riding
10:32
on the spot that it's gonna go in
10:34
i have a feeling that might have
10:35
happened in britain as well i've heard
10:37
about it a few times yeah and it's just
10:38
basically a lottery kind of thing isn't
10:40
it yeah also i
10:42
read that belgium is the largest
10:43
exporter of billiard balls
10:45
quite cool eighty percent of the world's
10:47
billiard balls are made in belgium
10:48
wow yeah really awesome it reminds me of
10:52
that fact
10:53
that most of the world's false teeth
10:54
come from lichtenstein
10:56
really yeah i was reading a
11:00
adventure book for boys that was written
11:02
in 1890
11:04
and it recommends goose fishing
11:07
or oh i think i think you mean goose
11:09
fisting you know
11:12
and yeah so you use goose fisherman
11:14
they're called and it recommends that
11:15
you just tie a fishing line and hook to
11:17
a goose's leg and then you drive the
11:18
goose into the water
11:20
and that works as a fisherman and it
11:21
just swims along and it's got bait on
11:23
the end
11:24
and as soon as the goose feels a fish
11:25
pulling on its leg it gets a bit
11:27
distressed because the fish is trying to
11:28
pull it under water
11:29
and it swims back to the shawl and it
11:31
brings the fish with it and then you
11:32
unhook it and there you go you haven't
11:33
had to do anything
11:34
wow that's pretty ingenious do you know
11:36
um it's really hard for us to tell how
11:39
fast fish swim what well it's really how
11:42
do you know what the fastest fish is
11:45
how can you measure speed of fish i
11:47
guess it's hard to see them under the
11:49
water and then you'd have to be going at
11:50
the same speed as them
11:51
otherwise they're just you know two
11:53
miles away and you're still sat in your
11:54
boat you don't know where they are
11:56
yeah yeah so what so what they do do is
11:59
um
11:59
this is a thing that's been set up
12:00
amongst professional fishermen is that
12:02
when they've
12:03
caught something they start measuring
12:05
how fast the reel
12:07
goes out so the speed of the reel and
12:09
then they log that time
12:11
so they found so far in any of these
12:13
experiments
12:14
that the fastest fish is the sailfish
12:16
and it took out
12:17
uh 300 feet of line of fishing line in
12:20
three seconds
12:22
so it went from zero to 60 in 2.6
12:24
seconds
12:25
which is incredible although i guess
12:27
these fish they've just been caught
12:29
haven't they
12:29
and they're trying to escape so it's not
12:31
like a normal fish would go that fast
12:33
maybe
12:33
yeah so maybe we could improve human 100
12:36
meter times
12:37
by the guy shooting the gun to start
12:39
starts pointing it out
12:41
that's the way to do it but yeah that's
12:43
interesting i had no idea i assumed that
12:44
we just knew what the fastest
12:46
fish was but yeah i would assume we'd
12:47
tag them yeah well they are
12:49
swimming faster fish in response to
12:51
human fishing
12:52
so yeah it's sensible if you
12:55
are chasing a fish with a net which
12:58
sometimes happens you've got a you know
12:59
fish
13:00
are trying to outswim a net basically
13:02
the slower fish will
13:03
be caught and then the faster fish will
13:05
survive and then they're more likely to
13:06
breed
13:07
so we might actually change fish
13:08
physiology just by fishing for them
13:11
might they get stronger because the
13:12
stronger ones manage to wriggle out of
13:14
the nets
13:15
and the weaker ones get caught and then
13:17
eventually you've got massively fast
13:19
super strong fish eventually the fish
13:21
will be catching us
13:22
oh no they'll be fishing for humans
13:25
we'll just see these rods coming out of
13:26
the water and onto the land
13:28
dragging us in the dystopia i see before
13:32
me
13:34
you see a cat just an adorable cat and
13:38
you go over to pettit then you see it's
13:39
got a fin poking out at the end of it
13:45
okay it is time for fact number three
13:47
and that is my fact
13:49
my fact this week is that 68 of
13:52
mountains
13:53
don't have pointy peaks
13:56
so what does that mean does it mean like
13:58
um like table mountain it has a flat top
14:00
yeah yeah so i guess uh anytime you draw
14:02
a mountain if we were drawing a mountain
14:04
we would give it a pointy peak right and
14:06
so this is why this fact really
14:07
surprised me i just assumed that it's
14:08
going to have a pointy peak
14:10
some guys at princeton university uh
14:12
paul elson
14:13
and morgan tingley decided that they
14:16
wanted to do a survey and see
14:18
how many mountains do in fact have
14:19
pointy peaks so they did a
14:21
they took satellite data from 182
14:23
mountain ranges around the world
14:25
and they looked at it and they
14:26
discovered that 68 of these mountains
14:29
didn't have a pointy peak so that's a
14:31
sort of so i think the definition of
14:32
pointy peak is important here because
14:34
i wasn't that surprised at first because
14:35
i thought well no no mountain biggest
14:37
yeah every time you climb a mountain
14:39
you're not kind of balancing on a little
14:40
kind of
14:41
point i always
14:47
so it's actually more interesting even
14:48
than it sounds i think because
14:50
uh the the guys who did the study define
14:53
pointy peak or define a pyramid-shaped
14:55
mountain as just a mountain whose area
14:58
steadily decreases as it goes up right
15:00
so as a mountain whose sides
15:02
just steadily move towards each other so
15:05
it doesn't mean that the peak has to be
15:06
as sharp as a needle so it could be a
15:08
ziggurat rather than a pyramid
15:10
exactly it's like a pyramid without a
15:14
with a flat top
15:15
yeah okay yeah so you could have a flat
15:17
top exactly
15:18
and what they found is i think that um
15:22
actually mountains often had an
15:23
hourglass shape so that area would get
15:25
would start off big and then it would
15:27
get smaller as it went up but then it
15:28
would increase again
15:30
and then sometimes they'd be inverted
15:32
pyramids
15:33
where i think is that incredible this is
15:36
amazing that is rubbish
15:37
well that's much less cool than it
15:39
sounds though right because it's not
15:40
like an upside down period it's not it
15:42
doesn't start at a point on the ground
15:44
yeah and work its way outward um
15:47
it's where it gets less and less steep
15:49
so uh it's not it doesn't consistently
15:51
go up like
15:52
that's interesting yeah okay um but yeah
15:55
and there are
15:56
so they found those inverse ones that
15:58
you're talking about six percent in the
16:00
survey
16:00
were these type um uh so that's where
16:03
the
16:04
land area increases to the top 23 um
16:07
had this hourglass shape and then 39
16:10
had a diamond form which is really cool
16:12
so that's less land area at the top and
16:14
the bottom so more in the middle
16:16
but where are these mountains that are
16:18
shaped like diamonds it start at the
16:19
point on the ground then they spread out
16:21
to this massive thing in the middle then
16:23
they shake
16:24
they don't get much publicity because no
16:25
one can climb them
16:26
[Laughter]
16:29
so one of the things about this study or
16:31
one of the things that makes it relevant
16:32
and
16:33
not incredibly dubious they're all the
16:35
amount of diamond faith
16:37
um but the interesting thing is that as
16:39
uh climate change happens as the planet
16:41
gets warmer
16:42
animals which live in a particular band
16:44
on a mountain are you pushed
16:45
upwards because they're going to be
16:46
pushed to where there's the same
16:48
temperature so
16:49
some species will benefit where the they
16:52
actually have more surface area higher
16:53
up
16:54
but some of them will a lot more of them
16:56
i think will uh suffer as a result
16:58
because you get
16:59
much smaller habitat for the species to
17:01
live on they have to hope that they
17:02
evolve wings and are able to take off
17:04
from the top won't they as they're
17:05
pushed higher and higher up
17:07
yeah there'll be a period where they're
17:08
just waiting for that to happen i
17:09
imagine
17:10
that's exactly how evil you should work
17:11
yes where are they going to go
17:13
when they've grown these wings they'll
17:14
just live up in the air i see
17:16
what birds do they just live in a cloud
17:18
if you'd like to subscribe to anna's
17:20
extreme optimism magazine
17:24
have you guys been to the top of
17:25
mountains
17:28
well i just want to do a quick survey so
17:30
how many have you done
17:32
i haven't watched i want to do a tiny
17:35
survey i've only been at one mountain
17:36
i've been up to
17:37
this okay so what's the top light um
17:40
it's
17:40
uh scree like what does that mean
17:47
yeah and then there's kind of a table
17:49
thing that you stand on so people can
17:50
take your photo so that it's like
17:52
yeah i got to the top and you're at the
17:53
top of the top yeah the only mountain
17:55
i've been on which is mount kosciusko
17:57
in australia don't you mean cozy
18:00
misconception of how that is said
18:01
um it's actually mount kosciuszko um
18:04
please write in to tell me how
18:06
correct i got that they have that as
18:09
well they have a little platform that
18:10
you stand on top of
18:12
and yeah so have they artificially added
18:14
to the height of the mountain
18:15
yeah no way in a way in a way yeah um
18:18
definitely
18:19
just on mountains yeah i assumed that we
18:21
had climbed
18:22
pretty much every mountain partly
18:23
because of the song there she was
18:25
telling people to climb
18:26
very well the message has not got across
18:28
because
18:29
the uh chairman of the mount everest
18:31
foundation committee
18:33
uh lindsey griffin said a few years ago
18:35
there are far
18:36
more unclimbed peaks than climbed ones
18:39
so many more
18:40
the highest point in bhutan you're not
18:42
allowed to climb up really
18:43
uh and also there was a thing about
18:45
kanchenchunga which was
18:46
um when people go up there you're
18:49
supposed to there's like a local
18:50
tradition where you're not supposed to
18:51
stand
18:52
on the absolute summit so you're
18:54
supposed to stop like two steps before
18:55
or something
18:56
and the first people who did it
18:57
definitely did that and i wonder if
18:59
everyone who's gone up has kind of
19:01
stopped just before and whether it's
19:02
never been climbed probably has really
19:04
the four highest mountains on earth
19:06
everest k2 kanchan chunga and lotsy
19:08
were first scaled in 1953 1954
19:12
1955 and 1956 respectively
19:15
wow they're such a good factor keep that
19:17
up
19:18
damn it yeah we could have counted down
19:20
all the way to the lowest mountain in
19:22
the world
19:22
that would have been amazing the
19:23
suspense would gradually decline and
19:25
decline and decline
19:27
eventually you're just climbing a little
19:29
hill 2 50.
19:32
yeah this is the thing it would take so
19:35
long because there are so many thousands
19:36
of peaks
19:37
yeah i'm surprised that chimborazo is
19:40
not
19:40
seen to be okay so mountain mountain um
19:43
this is in ecuador
19:44
is the highest point on earth it's 2.4
19:48
kilometers higher than mount everest
19:50
because of the shape of the further from
19:52
the center of the earth
19:53
exactly because the earth bulges a bit
19:54
around there exactly so it is
19:56
it is by long mile well 2.4 miles uh
20:00
the that would be a long mile
20:04
that is the highest spot on earth and
20:06
i'm surprised that that's not seen as
20:08
more of a because there must be
20:09
with altitude and with the thinness of
20:11
air that must be more of a challenge
20:13
in the 19th century they did think it
20:14
was the highest for ages they did
20:17
and um it was when like nepal was kind
20:20
of
20:20
westerners couldn't really go there and
20:22
so everyone thought the chimburatsu was
20:23
a
20:24
was the highest for quite a long time
20:26
wow yeah
20:27
that's really interesting yeah yeah so
20:28
how did it stay in the sun down
20:30
yeah i didn't feel bad for it i've
20:32
discovered a really interesting lady as
20:33
a result of looking into this
20:35
uh stuff about mountains her name is
20:37
elizabeth hawley um she's in her 90s
20:39
she has lived for over 50 years uh in
20:42
the himalayas and she has become
20:44
the ultimate person for verifying
20:47
summits that have been made by explorers
20:49
she put together the himalayan database
20:51
and she's someone who's
20:52
cracked down on whether or not people
20:54
are lying about getting to the top
20:55
because she has an in with all the
20:56
sherpas who tell her the truth about
20:58
what's going on yes so
20:59
she's sussed out a lot of fraud um and
21:02
she
21:03
verified the first ever blind ascent to
21:05
everest and
21:06
she's been living there 60 years and she
21:08
every explorer
21:10
if they want to take it seriously
21:11
apparently track her down and tell her
21:13
about their plans so that it can be
21:14
verified in this database
21:16
that she's been keeping for 60 years i
21:18
wonder if she has
21:19
a guy called morris wilson on her list
21:22
uh he was a guy in the 1930s
21:24
who thought that mysticism and prayer
21:26
would help him to climb everest
21:28
that didn't work and so what he decided
21:30
to do was to fly a plane and crash it
21:32
just below the top of everest and then
21:34
walk up the last few feet
21:36
what how far did he get well the first
21:38
time he got as far
21:39
as bradford
21:42
he crashed into a field and so then the
21:45
air ministry banned him from flying
21:47
but he just did it anyway and he managed
21:49
to get as far as darjeeling
21:50
and actually he did fly his plane
21:53
to everest and he did crash it but
21:55
unfortunately it seems like he died
21:57
before he well he definitely died
21:58
so yeah when was this 1930s
22:02
did he have a get out plan for getting
22:04
out of the plane before it crashed into
22:05
the mountain
22:06
i think so i think he would kind of just
22:08
jump out with a parachute or something
22:09
but then
22:10
kind of thought well i'll just walk up
22:12
to the top then that'll be fine and then
22:13
the way down i mean how hard can it be
22:15
to go down actually
22:17
where is the largest mountain so far as
22:19
we know in the universe
22:20
or the solar system let's say mars it
22:23
was it's been taken over now olympic
22:25
mons in mars olympia
22:27
yeah exactly it's been taken over um so
22:29
it's now uh
22:30
ria silvia on an asteroid called for
22:33
vesta
22:34
and it's about half the size of the moon
22:36
so it's traveling hurtling through the
22:38
universe the tallest mountain
22:40
wow is that awesome that's very i hope
22:43
it doesn't impale us on its sharp point
22:44
do we know what kind of shape it is
22:47
i mean the odds are actually 68 that it
22:50
doesn't have a sharp point
22:51
yeah it's probably a diamond or an
22:53
oblate steroid or a
22:55
rhombus mountain
22:57
[Music]
23:00
okay it is time for a final fact of the
23:02
show and that is anna
23:04
my fact is that the oldest your mum joke
23:07
appears on a 3500 year old babylonian
23:10
tablet
23:12
and it's an absolute cracker is it your
23:15
mum so old she appears on a 3500 year
23:18
old battle only a tablet
23:21
so what is the joke itself well there's
23:23
a minor problem in that we don't have
23:25
the first half of it so
23:27
does it not begin with your mum it
23:29
doesn't the your mum features actually a
23:30
little bit later it's a punchline
23:32
yeah so it's we have a missing part and
23:35
then we have the words
23:36
of your mother is by the one who has sex
23:39
with her
23:40
who is it wow it sounds like a mixture
23:42
between the first ever your mama joke
23:44
and the first ever knock-knock joke
23:48
of your mother is by the one that has
23:49
sex with her who
23:50
[Laughter]
23:52
so are they known to be uh full of jokes
23:55
cuneiform tablets
23:56
hilarious yeah everything in cuneiform
23:58
is a joke um no but there is this tablet
24:00
that
24:01
that was found in the 70s i think but
24:02
has only recently been analyzed which is
24:04
full of these riddles and these jokes
24:06
uh which are quite difficult if anyone
24:08
can understand the humor in them
24:09
then right in another one reads the
24:12
deflowered girl did not become pregnant
24:14
the undi-flowered girl became pregnant
24:17
what is it
24:18
and the answer is auxiliary forces
24:24
see that kills you should open with that
24:26
one
24:28
i'm obviously missing something here
24:30
that's too high bro for me clearly
24:33
do you know there's a your mum joke in
24:34
the bible yes sir the book of kings
24:37
uh and i'll read i'll read it out it's
24:40
when jorah saw jehu he said
24:42
is it peace jehu and he answered what
24:45
piece so long as the harlotries of your
24:47
mother jezebel and her witchcraft are so
24:49
many
24:50
whoa that is a good one yeah
24:53
from this side of the table we're more
24:56
into a babylonian
24:58
yeah it's not really a mum joke it's a
25:00
it's a your insult i suppose yeah yeah
25:03
yeah it's a fine line isn't it there's
25:04
another this is an ancient egyptian joke
25:06
so i'm going to test this material on
25:07
you guys now yeah yeah
25:08
how do you entertain aboard pharaoh i
25:11
don't know how do you entertain a boss
25:12
pharaoh
25:16
yes but it's a pyramid that's shaped
25:17
like a parallelogram
25:19
like most mountains in the world as we
25:21
know no it's
25:22
you sail a boatload of young women
25:24
dressed only in fishing nets down the
25:26
nile
25:26
and urged the pharaoh to go catch a fish
25:30
that's the way i tell him how do we know
25:32
about that joke was that just an
25:34
extremely long hieroglyphic that we've
25:36
worked it out from most writing wasn't
25:38
in hieroglyphics it was in
25:40
head's yeah of course sorry sorry
25:43
ancient egyptians okay
25:44
one more egyptian one more ancient
25:46
egyptian joke man is even more eager to
25:49
copulate than a donkey
25:50
his purse is what restrains him oh is a
25:53
prostitution joke yeah okay i'm not i'm
25:56
i'm
25:57
dying here shakespeare has a mum joke as
26:00
well
26:01
yeah yeah it's in titus andronicus which
26:03
is not a very funny play
26:04
it's pretty serious and people get eaten
26:07
in pies and things like that it's
26:08
incredibly gory it's one of the early
26:10
tragedies and
26:11
i think there's a body count of about 11
26:12
by the end it's so unpleasant but
26:14
there's a bit where
26:15
someone says um i have undone your
26:18
mother and then the other person says
26:20
villain i have done thy mother oh and
26:23
that is a proper your mum joke that is
26:26
yeah that's straight down the line
26:27
someone also said that he has the first
26:29
knock knock joke
26:30
uh which is inaudible yeah but it's very
26:33
hard to see the joke in it so i'm
26:35
skeptical does it have the word knock
26:37
it has the word knock in it that's
26:38
pretty much it has the words
26:40
it has it over and over again there's a
26:41
scene with the porter yes it's the comic
26:43
relief in the middle of the play oh yeah
26:45
so it's more like the comedy comes just
26:47
from the words knock knock knock knock
26:49
doesn't it
26:50
the joke hadn't really developed further
26:51
so he hadn't got to who's there
26:53
he would never reach that but
26:56
you know everything starts somewhere
26:57
doesn't it um
27:00
i was going through a long time ago on
27:02
museum of curiosity the radio show we
27:04
make
27:05
jimmy carr came on and he gave us um his
27:07
donation to the museum was a book that
27:09
contained all the jokes in the world so
27:11
we did a lot of research on jokes well
27:13
james did and i went through the scripts
27:14
and i've stolen all his research
27:16
so i'd like to read you out some of the
27:17
best bits of research i'll pretend
27:19
that i've never heard it before yeah
27:20
exactly so uh here's one that james
27:22
found uh so bob monk house very famous
27:24
comedian
27:25
in britain uh passed away he wanted to
27:28
write the ultimate joke and he told this
27:29
to dennis norden
27:30
another massive name in british comedy
27:31
history uh and
27:33
norden kept checking back on him every
27:35
few years to say how far have you got
27:37
with the ultimate joke
27:38
and years and years down the line he did
27:40
say not very far
27:42
i do have the opening line though i know
27:43
what that is and the opening line for
27:45
the world's ultimate joke was
27:46
a man walks into a chemist that's as far
27:48
as he got so we never know
27:50
if he made it any further than that i
27:52
can see that works because
27:53
halfway through you think it's going to
27:54
be bar and then suddenly chemist
27:57
yes it does work i'm already laughing
27:59
yeah
28:00
on the inside but i'm off balance enough
28:03
to really laugh at something in the next
28:05
line yeah
28:05
yeah yeah yeah uh here's another one uh
28:08
james found so a german
28:09
psychologist found that we laughed more
28:11
in the 1950s than we do now so in the
28:13
1950s we used to laugh for 18 minutes a
28:16
day
28:16
uh and these days we laughed for six
28:19
minutes a day
28:20
and then james added in the notes by the
28:22
way if you don't find this interesting
28:23
this might get a laugh the psychologist
28:25
was called dr michael tits
28:28
15 minutes a day yeah a lot of time to
28:31
spend laughing
28:32
yeah i spent 1440 minutes that day
28:35
laughing at the name
28:36
tits exactly james brought the average
28:39
for the whole year
28:42
has anyone seen the jokes written by
28:44
computers
28:46
no no um so there's a website um
28:49
i don't know what the site's called
28:50
joking computer i think but it's a b
28:52
d n a c dot uk joking computer
28:56
and the computer comes up with jokes
28:57
which are terrible puns that don't
28:59
really work
29:00
um how is a tender food different from
29:02
an additional support
29:04
one is a saw meet the other is a more
29:07
seat
29:09
it does work as a joke it kind of does
29:12
and
29:12
this one you would never say my this is
29:14
too sore this meat
29:16
that's true i wouldn't say it in a
29:18
restaurant well you'd probably get
29:20
kicked out
29:22
um this is one that i don't really
29:24
understand what do you call
29:26
an aquatics with the saints john a swift
29:30
main
29:30
okay so there's a button where you can
29:33
press why is this a joke
29:35
so i clicked on that button and it says
29:39
swimming is a kind of aquatics do you
29:41
agree or disagree
29:42
and i agree with that okay and then it
29:44
says maine
29:45
sounds like the end of swimming almost
29:49
i put disagree with that and then a
29:51
saints john can be a part of a maine
29:54
i really don't understand that at all is
29:56
it a town in the state of maine or
29:58
something
29:58
oh that's possible yeah yeah anyway it
30:01
didn't really work
30:02
that's where it falls down someone needs
30:03
to explain to that computer that if you
30:05
tell a joke and then you immediately
30:06
need to explain it
30:08
it's not a good joke it needs to remove
30:10
that button immediately
30:11
that's true although i think by me
30:14
disagreeing with those things it helps
30:15
it to make jokes in the future
30:17
oh that's so good of you well i like to
30:20
do my bit
30:22
um i was looking into there's a famous
30:24
joke that son gregory made where he was
30:26
in rome and he saw some
30:27
angle boys uh as in angles and
30:30
anglo-saxons
30:31
okay and uh he said non-angry said
30:33
angeli
30:34
not angles but angels because they were
30:36
so fair head and so
30:37
pretty looking at all of this and
30:39
supposedly he said well let's go and
30:40
convert
30:41
england or let's go let's go and commit
30:43
england to you know catholic roman
30:44
christianity
30:46
so this got me on to reading about um
30:48
things that were sins
30:49
in the 8th to 11th centuries right and
30:51
there were
30:52
big sins that you could commit it was a
30:54
sin in the 8th century to see your wife
30:56
naked really yep there's there was an
30:59
archbishop of canterbury called theodore
31:00
and
31:01
he had a penitential which is basically
31:03
a huge list of sins and punishments for
31:05
sins
31:05
so lots of them are sex-related so saxon
31:07
behind not allowed oral sex
31:09
really bad the worst of all sins is oral
31:11
sex um
31:12
but right if you have sex with a nun you
31:15
have to go on a fast for four years
31:19
if your wife cheats on you and you
31:21
divorce her
31:22
and you remarry you then have to do a
31:24
hard penance of seven years for
31:26
remarrying somebody else
31:28
but even if you forgive your wife you
31:30
either have to not have sex with her
31:31
until her penance is over
31:33
or you have to do penance for two years
31:36
because you're having sex with someone
31:37
who's an adulteress
31:39
do you think so whenever someone's wife
31:40
or husband cheated on them do they have
31:41
to open up this vast law book and work
31:44
out exactly the course they'd take
31:46
to avoid being arrested wait a minute so
31:48
when you cheated on me did you do it
31:49
from behind
31:52
because that's subsection 8b
31:55
actually speaking of the angles they had
31:57
some good jokes the oldest anglo-saxon
32:00
joke i think might be the best old joke
32:02
i've come across oh yeah okay
32:03
you're building it up a bit there anna
32:05
actually that's that's a real error
32:07
isn't it yeah yeah
32:08
so the oldest anglo-saxon joke is what
32:11
hangs at a man's thigh and wants to poke
32:13
the hole that it's often poked before
32:15
a penis a penis a penis i would have
32:17
said a key
32:19
it's a key that's why i keep needing to
32:23
ring the emergency locksmith
32:24
[Laughter]
32:26
can you grind me another one that looks
32:27
exactly like this
32:28
[Laughter]
32:32
yes it is a chub actually
32:35

00:36
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:39
no such thing as a fish
00:41
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
00:42
qi offices in covent garden
00:44
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
00:46
here with andy murray anna chazinski
00:48
james harkin and sarah pascoe
00:50
and once again we have gathered around
00:52
the microphones with our four favorite
00:53
facts from the last seven days
00:55
and in no particular order here we go
00:58
starting with you
00:59
sarah pascoe okay in the 1920s
01:03
scientists concluded that menstruating
01:05
women
01:06
wilted flowers
01:07
[Music]
01:10
so a proper scientist and so his name
01:12
and i
01:13
and it's a he but his name's bella
01:14
schick i think i've only seen it written
01:16
down
01:17
and um he's a proper scientist he cured
01:19
diphtheria
01:20
and i think apparently he was the first
01:21
person to use the word immunization so
01:23
he's a proper guy
01:25
yeah but then one day his maid was
01:27
passing him some flowers so she was like
01:29
i don't want to party the flowers
01:31
and then do the flowers and then um the
01:34
next day they were all wilted these red
01:35
roses and she was like oh
01:37
i knew that was gonna happen i'm on my
01:38
period and he was like what and she's
01:40
like yeah women are poisonous when
01:42
they're on their periods they can't look
01:43
at bread or dogs or
01:45
children or touch flowers or go swimming
01:48
and he was like oh my god i'm a
01:49
scientist i didn't even know about this
01:51
so he then did all these experiments
01:54
with women
01:54
holding flowers and baking bread and he
01:57
gave it the term menotoxin which were
01:59
emitted by women
02:00
in their tear glands and their sweat
02:02
glands
02:06
girls
02:08
so his study showed reading between the
02:11
lines
02:12
and hang on i'm no conspiracy theorist
02:14
but reading between the lines it sounded
02:16
like the women held the flowers for
02:17
quite a long time outside of water
02:20
and then they wilted whereas flowers in
02:22
water the control group
02:25
they were fine there was experiment with
02:28
bread as well
02:28
and one maid who was on her period i
02:30
mean it must have been such a lovely
02:31
house to work in
02:33
um so she made everyone make bread and
02:35
her hairs didn't rise as much
02:37
she was holding it in a hand and the
02:38
other thing
02:40
has didn't rise as much for that exact
02:42
reason and then it was like it's true
02:44
we were in bread and so it was kind of
02:46
supporting all of the really really old
02:48
taboos and taboo means menstruation
02:51
that's where the word comes from
02:53
no yes yes it means sacred or dementia
02:55
it's a word for menstruation
02:57
yeah amazing right because it is it's
02:59
one of those things where
03:00
uh throughout history the idea of
03:02
menstruating women around certain things
03:04
did affect things pliny the elder oh
03:06
right
03:06
he wrote so many crazy things yeah um
03:08
like dogs would go mad
03:10
all the caterpillars would fall out of
03:11
the leaves of trees and my favorite
03:13
because they'd all wilted
03:15
and also my favorite is that even ants
03:17
wouldn't pick up the grains
03:19
if you'd if a menstruating woman had
03:21
touched the crumbs
03:22
and were like no thank you disgusting
03:25
passing that by oh yeah and they'd cause
03:27
thunderstorms yeah
03:28
my favorite one is that they would dim
03:30
mirrors
03:32
wow there's one positive belief that
03:36
i've found at least traditionally
03:39
[Laughter]
03:41
um so this is a german occult writer
03:43
called henry cornelius agrippa
03:45
and he said that menstruating women
03:47
could protect crops from blight
03:49
instead of menstrual women she'll walk
03:50
naked about the standing corn
03:53
they make all cankers worms beetles
03:54
flies and all hurtful things fall off
03:56
from the corn
03:58
but if they don't do it before sunrise
04:00
then the corn withers
04:02
that sounds like the weirdest chat up
04:03
line in the world okay would you mind
04:04
coming around and taking all your
04:05
clothes off
04:06
you've got to be gone by morning
04:10
but the other one's really interesting
04:12
is the synchronicity thing so lots of
04:13
people have this real common belief that
04:14
women's uh synchronized periods
04:16
has never been scientifically proven
04:18
like one woman did a study actually i've
04:20
got her name written down it's like my
04:22
clinton mclean talk studies and she did
04:25
a huge study on seven women
04:28
which is always heartening and um she
04:30
found that at the beginning of the
04:32
summer they had periods that were
04:33
entirely separate and by the end of the
04:34
summer they were much nearer
04:35
and this has kind of mutated into people
04:37
believing that pheromones mean that when
04:38
women are living in the same house in
04:40
close quarters they suddenly sync up
04:41
it's never been replicated they can't
04:43
find any scientific reason why we would
04:45
and it's confirmation bias so with a
04:47
friend you notice the person who's like
04:48
oh suddenly
04:49
we're on at the same time or we have an
04:51
overlap which has nothing to do with
04:52
when you ovulate which would be the
04:54
significant part of
04:55
the reason to sync up with somebody and
04:58
you ignore all the people you're around
04:59
all the time and you never sync up with
05:00
them at all
05:01
yeah also maybe they're lying because i
05:02
reckon i used to claim my housemates
05:03
that i had my period at the same time so
05:05
it was not to be left out but maybe
05:06
everyone else is doing that
05:08
yeah i was like we're all synced up and
05:10
you don't want to be the loser who's not
05:11
quite in tune with your man hiding your
05:13
period
05:13
yes i never thought of never being moody
05:19
i thought we were together on this one
05:22
there was
05:23
mclintoc she defended her work because
05:25
there have been lots of follow-up
05:26
studies which as you say have never
05:28
found it and they've done studies for a
05:29
full year and said there could be
05:31
in the original study bits which synced
05:34
up a little bit but that was just
05:35
through coincidences
05:35
i think it's much more to do with the
05:36
moon than it is to do with other women
05:38
so
05:39
the one thing that's quite interesting
05:41
is that um
05:43
30 of women have their periods during
05:45
their full moon
05:47
and the the next nearest group of women
05:48
being the same is 12.5 percent so that's
05:51
quite a huge verifiable difference
05:53
and when women live in cities
05:55
electricity it they have their
05:57
period changes that how long their
05:59
menstrual cycle has changed
06:00
i know i know it's like magic it's to do
06:03
with melatonin in the brain so um women
06:05
when that starts to get affected even by
06:07
when you start sleeping less or being an
06:08
electric lighting all the time your
06:11
cycle changes because people do sleep
06:12
less when there's a full moon don't they
06:14
and they think that's because of the
06:15
light yeah so do people
06:17
right up near the north pole in iceland
06:19
and stuff have mental periods do you
06:21
think when they have sort of 24-hour day
06:22
and then 24-hour night yeah
06:24
i would love to know yeah well if
06:26
anyone's listening guys yeah contact us
06:28
all of the details of the emotional
06:30
cycle
06:31
at schreiberland lab
06:36
so they have had they do have positive
06:38
connotations in some places
06:39
there are um various societies where
06:42
women on their periods are thought to
06:44
have magical powers
06:45
so i think in some native american
06:46
tribes they would they would retreat to
06:48
a moon hut for the duration of their
06:49
period
06:50
and that meant that they didn't have to
06:51
do any work and that they could just
06:53
like have spiritual awakenings and stuff
06:54
like that
06:55
yeah but then again i think you can read
06:57
that from the other way because you can
06:58
go like choose to go to a hut where i
07:00
think
07:00
it's don't worry put your feet up we'll
07:04
handle this
07:06
yeah completely for me i think what a
07:09
absolute treat i'd love to do nothing
07:11
for five days
07:12
but for most women i guess that seems
07:13
like you're being you like camping as
07:15
well so this is
07:16
love a bit of camping especially because
07:18
in these huts people bring you your food
07:19
and stuff yeah there's nothing i love
07:20
more than camping where someone else is
07:22
doing the food
07:22
that's like glamping basically exactly
07:25
menstrual glamping struggling with
07:28
menstrual clamps
07:32
and so in terms of other experiments
07:34
there was a a married couple called
07:36
george and olive smith
07:37
and they injected rats and mice with
07:40
women's menstrual blood and they all
07:42
died and they were like see
07:44
toxic poisonous are you injured oh my
07:46
god
07:47
vagina blood into a mask totally dies
07:50
and then what did they expect it to do
07:52
well they just wanted to see and some of
07:53
the and then
07:54
what they did is they then some other
07:56
people did some follow-up studies where
07:58
they also gave them nice
07:59
antibiotics because they thought they
08:00
might be the bacteria from used blood
08:03
that they were injecting into the
08:04
animals that was killing them and then
08:05
all of those animals survived but they
08:07
do describe like oh but the mice were
08:08
really affected they kept
08:09
cowering in the corner of the cages like
08:11
i wonder why
08:14
so there's a really fun thing that
08:16
people can watch on the internet if they
08:17
want to
08:17
it's a 1946 walt disney film called the
08:20
story of menstruation
08:21
and it is better than fantasia really
08:24
yeah it's the first film i think that
08:25
mentions the word vagina
08:27
the science of it is fantastic in terms
08:29
of the uh the glands and the hormones
08:31
behind so it's not
08:32
a lot of stuff that's educational for
08:33
children or young women
08:35
is about the physical stuff the stuff
08:37
that you can see and it's much more
08:38
about the relationship of hormones in
08:39
your body
08:40
and what it's caused by and what's
08:41
happening it's quite good it's 10
08:42
minutes long
08:43
yeah wow it's banned i think there's
08:45
mickey in it yeah yeah it's
08:46
mickey's period
08:50
he gets injected halfway through i think
08:51
by minnie's vaginal blood yeah and he
08:53
dies
08:54
that's very sad
08:58
[Applause]
08:59
okay it is time for fact number two and
09:02
that is
09:03
andy my fact is that one proposed
09:06
solution to plane hijackings in the
09:08
1970s was to build a pretend havana
09:10
airport in south florida
09:13
so the thing is that in the um late 60s
09:16
and early 70s
09:17
hijacking was a huge huge problem and it
09:20
was this was very much in the sort of
09:21
you know before
09:22
9 11 days when the main thing that
09:24
happened was someone would say take this
09:25
plane to a different place
09:27
the big thing was take me to cuba
09:29
because obviously cuba very nearby
09:30
communist state
09:31
and um lots of people just would hijack
09:34
planes and flight didn't fly
09:36
into cuba and between 1968 and 1972 they
09:39
sometimes happened once a week
09:41
in the in the usa alone in 1969 82
09:45
planes were hijacked
09:46
it was a huge huge thing and they didn't
09:48
have any security at airports and things
09:49
like that and people kept hijacking
09:51
so people started contacting the
09:53
american faa
09:54
with suggestions and one of them was
09:56
setting up this fake havana airport in
09:57
south florida
09:58
so everyone just you know so they the
10:00
pilot says oh okay gonna fly you to cuba
10:03
they fly around the sea for a bit and
10:04
then fly back i think that's how they do
10:06
it just subtly change direction
10:07
they land then the cia busts the
10:09
hijacker
10:11
yeah they had a special anti-hijack task
10:13
force didn't they which people could
10:15
send in their ideas
10:16
yeah that's right yeah um but people
10:18
started taking the piss as well one
10:19
person said make everyone wear boxing
10:20
gloves so they can't hold a gun
10:23
but then they would just punch that way
10:26
again yeah there was one where someone
10:27
said
10:28
play the cuban national anthem before
10:30
takeoff and arrest anyone who
10:32
knows the lyrics
10:36
people just so patriotic they can't help
10:37
but stand up and chant along
10:39
so first of all the hijacking was going
10:41
the other way wasn't it was people
10:42
trying to escape cuba because she went
10:44
out to travel between two
10:45
my favorite one is the story about alan
10:47
funt so it's uh
10:49
1969 he was the presenter of candid
10:52
camera so he was very very famous across
10:54
the world and then he was on an airplane
10:57
which um had men hijacking to go to
11:00
havana
11:01
and he'd been recognized by a couple of
11:03
people so a man stood up and went no no
11:05
this is a trick alan funt the presenter
11:09
knows it is not a trick everyone
11:11
everyone calm down let's just listen to
11:12
the guys and everyone's like you're not
11:14
gonna get ass
11:15
this is so like you they're like
11:16
laughing so there's different cases
11:18
his daughter's talked about it openly
11:19
she remembers people like dancing once
11:21
they realized it was a trick
11:22
and air has just says popping champagne
11:24
and go we're gonna be on
11:27
and it tv like he's trying to like save
11:29
the program let's just take this
11:30
seriously yeah right
11:32
there was that other guy who um so at
11:35
first people i think wanted to hijack
11:36
planes and go to cuba and then people
11:37
started to catch on that you could also
11:39
ask for
11:39
shed loads of money while you were doing
11:41
that and there was that guy arthur
11:43
barkley
11:43
who was debating his tax bill and i
11:46
think he started debating it in like
11:47
1962
11:48
and this went on for eight years and he
11:50
kept going to and from washington and it
11:51
was quite a small tax bill it was like
11:53
472 dollars he owed and he said he
11:55
didn't owe
11:55
it's the principal yeah it is actually i
11:57
can imagine the money back
11:59
still quite a lot of cash i can imagine
12:01
james actually doing this
12:03
so eventually he just hijacked this
12:05
plane um and he
12:06
smuggled a gun on and he demanded that
12:08
they do an emergency landing and when
12:09
they landed
12:10
they had to have a hundred million
12:12
dollars waiting for him so the cia would
12:14
have had to be there billions of dollars
12:18
if you get that kind of money is that
12:20
tax-free
12:22
how does it work is it like a gift does
12:24
it count as a gift there are places in
12:25
the world where
12:27
people have declared their guns as
12:29
expenses when they've done bank
12:30
robberies and things like this there was
12:31
a famous case of a businessman i think
12:34
claiming a ransom against tax i'm pretty
12:37
sure
12:37
i've never seen that on my tax return um
12:40
but anyway
12:40
can i can i gift aid the ransom please
12:42
like it's worth a bit more actually and
12:44
then you get something more back
12:47
um this guy i just really love the idea
12:49
of um he said i need a hundred million
12:51
dollars cash
12:52
waiting for me when we do this emergency
12:53
landing so they landed the plane and the
12:55
plane had radioed down to the ground to
12:57
the airport staff
12:58
at the airport saying you need to get as
12:59
much cash as you can just go into all
13:01
the banks in the area and so i also
13:02
first of all like the idea of all these
13:03
airport staff running into all the banks
13:05
and saying
13:06
how much cash have you got give it all
13:07
to us now please and they managed to get
13:09
a hundred grand
13:10
so a hundred thousand which they brought
13:12
to the airport waiting for him
13:13
and they brought it onto the plane when
13:14
it landed and he opened up the sacks and
13:16
was like this isn't a hundred million
13:18
it's
13:18
do you think i'm an idiot and he took
13:20
the plane off again and um
13:22
so he's he was like that's that's not
13:23
nearly enough i asked for a hundred
13:24
million so
13:25
then they got the government to really
13:27
properly get enough
13:28
back so they at least look realistic so
13:30
they sent a bunch of cia agents
13:32
to stand down the runway and they
13:33
stuffed sacks with
13:35
newspaper what i would have done i would
13:37
have filled the bags with cia
13:38
agents yeah and as soon as he opened one
13:40
they burst out
13:42
they covered ca agents with money and
13:44
then
13:45
he tried to spend them you got it
13:47
hijackers weren't all bad
13:49
like i think sometimes they were just
13:50
like disturbed teenagers weren't they
13:52
and there was that guy who
13:53
hijacked a plane and wanted it to be
13:55
taken to cuba and then he got distracted
13:57
by another man on the plane stood up and
13:59
said hey do you want to see my coin
14:00
collection mate
14:01
and he sort of dropped the gun was like
14:03
oh yeah i collect coins actually
14:05
and so that seems like someone who's not
14:07
terrifying the first hijacker in
14:09
norwegian history
14:11
he hijacked his plane in 1985 because he
14:13
was fed up with society
14:15
but then he surrendered his pistol to
14:17
authorities one hour later in exchange
14:19
for more beer
14:21
so he'd already had some beers yes after
14:24
they started adding signs at airports
14:26
uh about security so in the early 1970s
14:30
when they'd started sort of uh screening
14:32
passengers to see who looked like they
14:33
might be carrying weapons
14:34
all janitors at airports in america
14:36
reported that they'd find just guns and
14:37
knives and stuff strewn in the flower
14:38
beds outside the airport
14:40
because as when it first came in people
14:42
will come to airports plan to hijack a
14:43
plane
14:44
and then see a sign that said by the way
14:45
we've got screening going on to see if
14:46
you're going to hide that plane just
14:47
maybe like
14:48
sod this wow all right so it's not like
14:50
you know if you go into a pub but you've
14:52
got a kind of lager or something in your
14:53
hand you're like oh i'm just gonna have
14:55
to leave this out here because i can't
14:56
take it in
14:56
it's not like they were just carrying
14:58
guns around and thought oh no it's not i
15:00
think it was
15:00
in theory it was people who were
15:01
intending to hijack planes do you often
15:04
get to the pub with a can of lager
15:05
already in your hand
15:07
just top it up by the way oh sure yeah
15:09
that's called preloading isn't it
15:11
yeah i've heard of that do you know that
15:13
near london in gravesend there is a
15:15
whole
15:15
town where they do practice a fake town
15:18
where they do practice police things
15:20
um so like for hijackings or bombings or
15:22
fires or riots
15:23
wow and there's pictures of that online
15:25
there's a whole flickr account it's
15:26
really odd but all the public transport
15:28
and nightclubs and there's a pizza land
15:30
and everything that must be the most
15:32
terrifying place to accidentally
15:33
wander into yeah yeah this is a crime
15:36
hub
15:37
i think i saw photos of that the other
15:39
day um there was
15:41
photos of a train crash what would
15:43
happen if a tube just crashed
15:45
and they had people dressed up in makeup
15:47
and they had emergency services come in
15:48
yeah yeah
15:49
spooky thing in the 50s in nevada they
15:51
did a whole city to test atomic bombs on
15:53
and they put people they dress people up
15:55
in mannequins they got all these jc
15:56
penny mannequins so it looks like
15:57
family's having a nice time and then
15:59
there's photographs in real time of what
16:00
happened to their houses
16:02
as i think it was like something like 43
16:04
kilotons was the most they're off when
16:05
you think hiroshima is 12
16:07
tons and people watch from six miles
16:10
away
16:10
and there's all these photographs are
16:11
seeing just literally fire going through
16:13
a house
16:14
wow you can still visit it that's yeah
16:16
richard feynman i think watched those
16:18
and he's the only person of all the
16:21
people watching it not to wear the
16:22
special
16:23
glasses that were given to everyone why
16:25
didn't we why because he knew
16:26
he was a tough guy
16:29
it's because he was in a car and he knew
16:31
that the radiation wouldn't get through
16:33
the glass is that right
16:34
wow
16:43
[Applause]
16:45
okay it's time for fact number three and
16:47
that is
16:48
chozinski my fact is that this year an
16:51
organization will finish a 40-year long
16:53
study of britain's post boxes
16:55
at which point it will immediately start
16:57
again what are they studying
16:59
they're selling everything about all the
17:00
post boxes in britain and they've been
17:02
going since 1976 when they started
17:04
they're called the letterbox study group
17:05
and they decided they had to document
17:07
every single postbox like what what the
17:09
royal insignia was on it
17:10
what kind of post box it was is it in a
17:12
wall built into a wall is it on a
17:14
lamppost
17:15
is there's a lot of important things to
17:16
be told about well important is a very
17:18
strong word
17:20
i was really sneering of this idea like
17:21
oh my god and then i found out a bit
17:24
more and now i'm going to join
17:25
because i think it's so amazing what
17:27
they're doing would you want to join
17:28
them
17:29
also i think there's only boys in it so
17:31
far actually you're right i didn't
17:33
read a single interview with a woman oh
17:34
really they're all like i watched some
17:36
videos of them online
17:37
this guy paul whom i'm now in love with
17:39
and
17:40
he was like oh my wife's so
17:42
understanding he's like well she should
17:43
be getting it out there this is
17:44
interesting
17:45
i didn't know that the monarch who was
17:46
reigning when the post box was made has
17:48
their initials on it apart from
17:49
scotland where um so in scotland they
17:52
had to take off they were protesting
17:54
scotland when they first introduced the
17:55
e
17:56
11r because obviously she's the first
17:59
queen elizabeth not the second of
18:00
scotland yeah
18:01
um and so they don't have it on them
18:02
anymore they just have a little they
18:04
have a little symbol
18:05
like post box crown or something
18:07
something royal but not saying she's the
18:08
second
18:09
yeah i really like um and maybe this was
18:11
a massive story but i missed it that
18:13
there are now a hundred golden
18:14
post boxes yes that's so cool in
18:17
edinburgh when the olympics was on they
18:18
did they spray painted one when are they
18:20
gonna paint them back i wonder
18:21
i don't think they will yeah i think
18:23
they ought to eventually do
18:25
i feel very strong i feel very strongly
18:26
about that because it's introducing a
18:29
rogue element of individuality into the
18:30
post-box design and i feel very strongly
18:32
but they should all be read
18:34
there was a period when they're all
18:34
getting painted red because they were
18:36
green in victorian times
18:37
and was that because people had won
18:38
things or i think it was just to make
18:40
them
18:41
stand out more because if they're green
18:42
in rural environments they can be very
18:44
true
18:44
yeah exactly for years no one could post
18:47
anything well people were posting
18:48
letters but just into trees and bushes
18:50
things and it makes it horrible for the
18:51
tree because it's made from paper it's
18:53
like a corpse of a relative
18:57
there was in 2012 in birmingham new
18:59
street station they found the post box
19:01
that had been covered up for like 50
19:03
years or something
19:04
and they kind of opened it and there was
19:06
a load of letters in there that had just
19:07
been sat there for years and
19:08
and years yeah and did they read them
19:11
all
19:12
they gave them to the royal mail and the
19:14
royal mail took them to the people who
19:15
they should have gone to
19:16
oh my gosh do we still have a dead
19:18
letter office in this country
19:20
what's that oh i don't know it's where
19:22
post that they don't know how to deliver
19:24
it the
19:24
instructions on the outside the address
19:26
is too vague and it goes
19:27
and the these guys are amazing they
19:30
crack the codes on the outside and they
19:31
try and get anywhere
19:32
and they will get it to father christmas
19:33
or princess diana as i found out as a
19:35
child
19:36
really yeah what were you writing to
19:37
them oh like the pretty lady in the big
19:39
house oh what was i writing
19:41
yeah good good wishes just a big fan i
19:44
used to write loads of letters to the
19:45
royal family
19:47
and to santa not asking for presents
19:52
everyone writes in december like when
19:54
they want something i'm just going to
19:55
write in maybe
19:57
you're just trying to get on that nice
19:58
list no
20:02
charles dickens had his own post box in
20:04
his house
20:08
you've got a letterbox so the postman
20:11
would come and collect
20:12
the post from his house yeah it was
20:13
built into the wall on the outside of
20:15
his house so it was in the area where he
20:16
lived which was god's hill i think so he
20:18
lobbied the post office
20:20
said install it in my house please
20:21
because everyone from around the village
20:23
would come to his house to post their
20:24
letters
20:24
and the postie would arrive open the
20:26
thing in his house and pick up all this
20:28
private when it's a communal one for
20:29
everyone also back then when he was
20:30
alive they would have been up to 18
20:32
collections a day
20:34
whoa yeah people were sending so many
20:36
letters
20:37
that yeah that's exciting so you could
20:38
correspond with someone a few times in a
20:40
few times in a single day
20:43
yeah i mean my email does hundreds of
20:45
thousands of collections a day so it's
20:47
not actually extraordinary
20:48
i found out about one now so that in
20:50
japan there's an
20:51
underwater postbox for scuba divers who
20:54
then send letters to other
20:55
scuba divers and they're waterproof
20:57
letters that you put underneath and
20:59
that's collected twice a day
21:00
that's really cool do you have to have
21:02
your own underwater letterbox
21:04
i don't know how you'd have it as your
21:05
address i guess you just have to say
21:06
like that starfish
21:07
that starfish near the rock and then it
21:09
would get to where you're going to
21:10
collect it from
21:11
that's amazing there are very rem yeah
21:13
so um the
21:14
everest base camp has a post box um
21:17
where else there's the antarctic one
21:19
i'm not sure if we've spoken about that
21:20
before really remote polar bears yeah
21:22
well yeah
21:22
exactly they did a application for it
21:24
and they published it in the newspaper
21:26
so we could see the application and they
21:28
explained that the job would involve
21:29
carrying big heavy box over slippery
21:31
rocks and slushy snow
21:32
and you'd have to survive on no heating
21:34
or running water
21:35
says are you happy not to shower for up
21:37
to a month live in close proximity to
21:39
three people and two thousand smelly
21:41
penguins for five months
21:42
yes this one sounds better than the
21:44
edinburgh festival
21:47
um i was looking at some weird societies
21:51
or apparently boring societies
21:54
do you guys know how popular according
21:55
to its website the biscuit appreciation
21:57
society is
21:58
how popular and according it's very
21:59
popular according to its website it's a
22:01
very reliable website i believe
22:03
everything they say
22:04
um they so there's a message on their
22:06
website saying that i'm really sorry we
22:08
can't take any extra
22:09
members as we have a backlog of
22:11
memberships and there's a 17-year
22:13
waiting list
22:14
to get into the biscuit appreciation
22:15
society it claims our membership
22:17
currently stands at about three million
22:19
appreciators
22:20
we never expected more than a couple
22:22
does it mean every time someone has a
22:24
biscuit like
22:25
add them to the list they obviously
22:26
appreciate biscuits
22:28
this sounds like the raelians there's a
22:30
uh there's a movement of ufo
22:32
alien believing um people on earth and
22:35
the raelians do that don't they
22:36
um well what the raelians do is you can
22:39
become a priest
22:40
but by kind of just going there and they
22:42
make you a priest but they'll also make
22:43
you a priest without you even knowing it
22:45
so they kind of make celebrities priests
22:48
just without even telling them
22:49
and they say look at all these famous
22:51
people who are priests and famous people
22:59
robbie williams big fan of mine
23:03
6.7 billion members
23:05
[Laughter]
23:07
no waiting list everyone is
23:09
automatically entered
23:12
i'll be so disheartening though for the
23:13
letters you get from robbie williams
23:14
saying please remove me from the organ
23:16
club
23:17
it doesn't work like that my friend yeah
23:19
you're a double
23:21
the minute you member to leave you love
23:22
me more
23:23
[Laughter]
23:25
in the olden days london these were
23:26
really odd kind of gentlemen's clubs
23:28
where they had very specific things they
23:29
had to do so there was a murderous club
23:31
where you were only allowed in a feud
23:32
ever killed a man
23:33
and there was the everlasting silence
23:34
club where always someone had to be
23:36
there but you were not allowed to ever
23:37
speak and it was for men who had to
23:38
escape their noisy wives
23:41
and there was a fartest club all these
23:42
kind of really odd things was the
23:44
murderous club just a front set up by
23:45
the police
23:46
they just sort of all the club all the
23:48
club staff were hanging around saying
23:49
so who'd you kill i imagine that the
23:52
murderers club would be people who used
23:53
to be members of the silence club
23:55
after the farthest club walked in there
23:58
[Laughter]
24:00
in japan there are drain spotters which
24:03
i also want to be a member of the drains
24:05
brothers club
24:06
which are people who spot drain covers
24:08
because manhole covers in japan are
24:09
often really really beautiful
24:11
and they've got yeah these amazing
24:12
designs do you think they came up with a
24:14
name first
24:14
because it's like a pun on train
24:16
spotters yeah if you haven't read the
24:17
irvine welsh book
24:18
trainspotting uh it's incredibly boring
24:22
um can i tell you about one more yeah
24:25
this is from the this is from the dull
24:26
men's
24:26
club who are there are fantastic
24:28
organizations i'm quoting exactly here
24:30
bottle banker steve i don't know if
24:32
that's rhyming
24:34
bottle banker steve wheeler 66 from
24:36
malvin has spent 30 years collecting
24:38
more than 20
24:39
000 milk bottles he found his first
24:42
bottle in the mid-1980s
24:43
and now steve who admits he doesn't even
24:45
like milk
24:47
houses them in an 80-foot museum in his
24:49
garden
24:51
so when he collects them do they have
24:52
milk in them don't know right
24:54
i mean if if they do i'm sure he gets
24:56
rid of it pretty quickly
24:57
that's why he hates milk so much
25:03
have you seen what happens to it how do
25:05
people drink it every day is horrible
25:08
okay let's move on to our final fact and
25:11
that is james
25:12
okay my fact this week is that in the
25:14
middle ages
25:15
people slept with cow dung at the foot
25:17
of the bed to keep
25:19
bugs away did it work i think it did to
25:22
a certain extent really yeah
25:23
because the bugs would be attracted to
25:25
the dog right it would have tried maybe
25:26
just to the end of the bed
25:28
also it wasn't fresh dung no was it so
25:30
it was dried dung and sometimes you set
25:32
fire to it it was actually the smoke
25:33
from the dung
25:34
oh so it's like incense and so people
25:35
still do that now apparently do they
25:37
yeah
25:38
wow yeah sometimes people burn their
25:40
houses down in order to keep up with
25:41
them actually there's loads of cases
25:43
with bed bugs
25:43
where people have alcohol and different
25:46
kind of flammable things on their sofas
25:48
and beds and then yeah second fire to
25:49
the neighborhood
25:50
yeah i think there was a woman in
25:51
detroit recently maybe the last couple
25:52
of months so yeah covered her
25:54
apartment in alcohol and then turn up
25:55
the heating super high because she heard
25:56
that was how to get rid of sometimes
25:58
they do like they go like oh i put
25:59
alcohol on everything that's great that
26:00
should do it and then i'll have a nice
26:01
[ __ ] to relax
26:04
wow bed bugs are really hard to get rid
26:06
of
26:07
i've heard that they're getting thicker
26:09
skin now to get rid of the insecticide
26:11
and the horrible things people are
26:12
saying about them
26:16
yeah yeah insects could evolve so much
26:19
more quickly because there's so many
26:20
generations so
26:22
yeah the concentration of insecticide
26:24
that you need to kill a bed bug now is
26:26
about a thousand times more than it was
26:28
like say a hundred years whoa really
26:30
yeah and apparently it always takes
26:31
three times you can't just get rid of
26:33
them in one swoop it takes three
26:34
goes round so what is wrong with having
26:37
bed bugs
26:38
i just i mean i've never understood this
26:40
so i've i don't think i've had them
26:42
yeah but if i did what would be i think
26:44
they cover you in painful
26:45
horrible red liver bites
26:48
because bedding apparently used to be
26:50
worth like a third of people's
26:52
possessions and that's what when they
26:53
traveled they would take their bed
26:54
sheets and they're covering with them so
26:56
they didn't wouldn't use them in inns
26:57
and stuff
26:58
and i hadn't really even thought about
26:59
the fact that it's so unusual now that
27:01
we sleep in beds on our own
27:02
yeah absolutely until about the 19th
27:04
century you'd mainly share a bed with
27:06
someone else wouldn't you yeah if you
27:07
stopped in a town like if you went to
27:08
travel lodge you just have to sleep with
27:10
like lady henry or something that's
27:12
right wow lori henry in every room
27:16
hostels are still kind of like that
27:19
you are in a room of strangers yes which
27:21
is quite rare it's just
27:23
like sharing a bed that was the standard
27:24
that was the only option you'd have
27:26
intruder in medieval times people who
27:27
are wealthy enough to have a bed which
27:28
wasn't very many people
27:29
would always take it with them so all
27:31
beds were zed beds foldable beds um
27:34
and yeah so the king would travel with
27:35
his bed um any nobles would travel with
27:38
their beds folded up on the back of
27:39
their car
27:40
well i was reading something by lucy
27:41
warsley and she was saying that beds in
27:42
that period were actually incredibly
27:44
rare
27:44
for the poor yeah so it would just be a
27:46
huge hall where everyone was sleeping so
27:48
did they have cow dung on the floor next
27:50
to them in their kind of their floor bed
27:52
i think it was hanging up rather than
27:54
like really because it sounds like it
27:55
would be spread at the foot of the bed
27:56
yeah but i think it's kind of hanging up
27:59
to keep the flies oh my god
28:00
like um at the front of a car for yeah
28:02
like an air freshener like
28:04
a little tree um
28:07
so cow dung is great
28:10
stuff yeah oh my goodness um so
28:14
i did not know that you can on the
28:15
indian amazon website you can buy
28:17
cow dung cakes you can get them uh about
28:20
roughly six for two pounds fifty pretty
28:23
good
28:24
so what it is you you get a cow pet and
28:26
you mix it up with hay and then you slap
28:27
it on
28:28
a wall and it dries into a cake and then
28:30
you can burn that
28:31
in a stove to to cook food or religious
28:34
ceremonies
28:34
people in cities these days don't use it
28:36
for for
28:38
food cooking anymore but yeah um so
28:40
there's
28:41
also an indian center which uses cow
28:43
dung medicinally
28:44
and their claims are so extravagant
28:48
okay so uh this is in ahmedabad and one
28:51
claim is uh walking on fresh cow dung is
28:53
very healthy
28:54
it completely heals all problems with
28:56
your feet
28:58
they also have cow water which is a
29:00
urine-based soft drink
29:01
and the director of this facility said
29:03
this will end the market for carbonated
29:05
fizzy drinks
29:08
i love those like all problems with your
29:10
feet like i lost a foot
29:12
come over here
29:15
yeah and the the the sentence on this
29:17
website just says
29:18
mainstream doctors are divided about the
29:20
medical benefits
29:21
with some pointing out that the curative
29:23
claims have never been validated by
29:25
independent
29:26
bodies yeah you can get cow urine
29:29
aftershave i think because it's very
29:30
good for your skin
29:32
apparently so does this come from
29:33
thinking that cows are precious yeah
29:35
it's in their religion yeah yeah because
29:37
they're sacred
29:38
and their dung is sacred as well which
29:40
is why it's religious rituals that's
29:41
what yeah it says here uh their milk
29:43
makes children more obedient
29:45
that's part of the sacredness yeah and
29:46
touching them can lower your blood
29:48
pressure that's one of the thoughts oh
29:49
yeah
29:49
and they block nuclear radiation okay
29:52
well i'm right with the first two
29:53
because they make sense
29:54
that yes if children want some more milk
29:56
yeah that might be more obedient
29:57
yeah uh i think it makes absolute sense
29:59
stroking lots of pets people have
30:00
comfort animals that would calm you down
30:02
those quarters are fine and the nucleus
30:06
well not many people know but richard
30:07
fineman
30:09
yeah he just slapped a cow pat on his
30:11
eyes
30:12
yeah um i've got another thing about old
30:16
bedtime
30:17
great oh yeah medieval times um so have
30:20
you heard of bundling
30:22
yeah bundle you all jump on something
30:24
it's great
30:25
okay no no it's actually the very bottom
30:27
of the bundle you're gonna be second in
30:28
the bundle
30:29
why is it okay to be on the bottom i
30:31
don't know for sometimes it's just
30:32
snuggly but you can second one it's
30:33
uncomfortable
30:34
you can kind of curl up and defend
30:35
yourself a bit more if you're at the
30:36
bottom whereas yeah
30:38
yeah you're spreading eagles when you're
30:39
second then i think you deserve it
30:41
because you're the first one jumping in
30:43
on the bundle you're causing all the
30:44
problems you don't know maybe the person
30:45
underneath said bundle
30:47
you just have to follow instructions can
30:48
you
31:02
that's when you do a bundle but you've
31:04
all got sleeping bags on um so bundling
31:06
used to be when you wanted to introduce
31:07
uh two unmarried children to each other
31:10
old of age i should have yeah
31:11
okay so it'd be two two uh boy and a
31:14
girl unmarried and the parents would let
31:16
them sleep in the same room for an
31:18
evening
31:18
the idea was to get to know each other
31:20
yeah so in order to prevent
31:22
things from happening from getting sexy
31:24
yeah uh they used to either
31:26
tie them to the bed so you would have to
31:29
lay there
31:30
tied both of you to the bed all evening
31:33
or they would put a ginormous wooden
31:35
board just in the middle of the bed
31:37
separating you too surely that's how
31:38
people get fetishes
31:42
your early sexual experiences have been
31:43
tied up with of words
31:47
how old are these young people i guess i
31:49
guess approaching marriage age so
31:51
so yeah so they were kind of
31:52
marriageable age yeah i don't know
31:54
um it was kind of yeah roughly late
31:57
teens i think
31:58
yeah the next guy i meet and we're like
32:00
hey do you like being tied up
32:03
because i want to get to know you
32:04
because i always got kicked out of these
32:06
bundling parties you guys are going
32:07
to show my rope
32:11
the first draft of 50 shades of grey is
32:13
actually incredibly boring a lot of
32:15
conversation
32:16
i mean also the final draft of fifty
32:18
shades also incredibly boring that's not
32:19
the point you haven't read fifty shades
32:21
i've read the first third of fifty
32:22
shades of grey what did you think
32:24
seventeen shades
32:28
i stopped after the after the third or
32:30
fourth time she shattered into a million
32:31
pieces
32:32
oh yeah i thought is that what happens
32:35
did you read humpty dumpty
32:38
anastasia calls all the king's horses
32:40
and all the king's men yeah

00:58
sitting here with anna chazinski james
01:00
harkin and andy murray and once again we
01:02
have gathered around to discuss the most
01:04
interesting facts we found from last
01:05
week and in no particular order
01:07
here we go starting with you james
01:09
harkin
01:10
okay my fact this week is that this week
01:13
the queen will celebrate
01:14
her 669th birthday
01:20
because she's a lizard they're all
01:22
lizards
01:24
lizards those famous animals that live
01:27
for 600 years
01:29
because she she's a sponge she's a very
01:31
ancient spanish under the sea
01:33
so why why the uh okay so what this is
01:36
basically is we all know the queen has
01:38
her actual birthday which is this week
01:40
and she also has an official birthday
01:42
which when all their parties are and
01:44
stuff like that
01:45
but she also has official birthdays in
01:46
all the different commonwealth countries
01:49
and so i went through all of them and
01:50
found out when the dates were
01:54
and some of them kind of coincide with
01:56
each other so this took me quite some
01:58
time to work out
01:59
um and i worked out that she um has had
02:02
668 birthdays and their 669th will be
02:05
this week wow and actually there are
02:09
some countries that used to be in the
02:10
commonwealth which aren't anymore
02:12
there's quite a lot of them and i
02:13
couldn't really be bothered working them
02:14
out
02:16
but i kind of assume the queen isn't
02:17
really celebrating those anyway so
02:20
yeah i'm going for six six nine you're
02:21
saying she could be even older
02:23
no no she could be a thousand no no no
02:27
she's still the age we think she is
02:28
she's just celebrating a lot of
02:30
birthdays
02:31
i worked out that if she is that age 669
02:35
years old
02:36
she isn't by the way but it means that
02:40
if she
02:40
is then while all of us are here in 2016
02:44
she's actually living in the year 2592.
02:50
and that's very exciting see i worked it
02:52
out the other way that she was born in
02:54
1347
02:58
i think we're both wrong um we're
03:01
actually recording this on wednesday so
03:02
she's recorded she's celebrating it
03:04
today and tomorrow which is thursday the
03:06
21st
03:07
um today she started celebrating by
03:09
visiting the royal mail
03:12
and looking good to look for cards
03:13
coming in
03:16
money
03:20
yeah she went to the romell sorting
03:22
office and had a look around there i
03:24
think
03:24
are you sure she wasn't picking up a
03:25
parcel
03:28
yeah that could be it no no she would i
03:30
think they had a new stamp out or
03:31
something like that she's and do you
03:32
know the tweet that she tweeted because
03:34
she tweets obviously
03:35
um yeah i like you but unlike me
03:40
our 669 year old queen is more modern
03:43
than i am
03:44
um uh yeah so she sent a tweet out it's
03:47
from her twitter feed which i think is
03:48
like at british monarchy or something
03:50
and it showed the people of the royal
03:52
mail singing happy birthday and then it
03:54
said
03:54
the first of many renditions of happy
03:56
birthday for the queen and i thought
03:58
that was quite cocky
04:02
yeah what if that's the only one she's
04:03
going to feel like an idiot
04:06
um so the queen is is 90 uh in human
04:09
years and 600
04:11
669 in queen years
04:16
but other things uh that she is as old
04:18
as
04:19
in human years um television
04:23
okay liquid fuel rockets
04:26
winnie the pooh and the drug pcp
04:29
[Music]
04:31
and she i believe is going to celebrate
04:33
by combining all four of those
04:38
does she still send around she doesn't
04:40
still send cards to every single 100
04:42
year old does she
04:43
well uh she does but you have to apply a
04:46
few weeks before but you do get a card
04:48
and you also get a card from ian duncan
04:50
smith
04:52
i know you won't no you won't anymore
04:53
sorry because he's just resigned but you
04:55
get a call from the work and pension
04:56
secretary so now you'll get one from
04:58
stephen crabb guys
05:00
pretty cool and then a long letter for
05:03
me and duncan smith saying you want to
05:04
hang out
05:04
i got nothing on
05:10
do you know who takes over if the queen
05:12
were to become infirm in some way but
05:14
without abdicating or anything like that
05:16
um
05:17
ian duncan smith no michael gove
05:22
so he is he's the lord chancellor at the
05:25
moment and
05:26
it's i mean the last time it happened
05:27
was in the 19th century with george the
05:29
third
05:29
but the lord michael was that old
05:34
old lizard no i think what is it not
05:38
that he
05:39
gets to kind of say that they have to
05:41
have a regents and the region will
05:42
probably be prince charles
05:43
oh i'm not sure i thought it was that he
05:45
carries out the royal duties
05:47
[Laughter]
05:49
gets into bed with prince villain
05:53
oh come on goby
05:59
oh there goes the obe
06:04
there's a lot of stuff going about uh
06:05
also a little bit of trivia about her
06:07
this week because of her birthday
06:08
one i really liked she doesn't have a
06:10
passport because in the british passport
06:12
there's a thing saying that she requests
06:14
that all of uh anyone holding a british
06:17
passport be allowed
06:18
into those countries so therefore
06:20
because she's made the request
06:21
it's kind of said i've requested but can
06:24
you get my mates in as well
06:25
and so she doesn't need to physically
06:28
carry it i think it's that or she needs
06:29
to hope someone in front of her
06:31
in the immigration queue has the british
06:32
password she can go just read the name
06:36
but i'm quite confused about this
06:37
because she also doesn't have a driving
06:38
license famously she doesn't need to
06:39
have a driving license even though she
06:40
drives so i don't know
06:42
a how she buys alcohol
06:46
i think she might just about pass for
06:48
over 21.
06:51
but b how does she when she was walking
06:53
into those countries any of us could
06:54
impersonate the queen
06:55
we could all just put on a wig and say
06:56
i'm the queen i don't need a passport
06:59
let me into your country they say oh do
07:00
you have driving license to prove you
07:02
are no i don't have a driving license
07:03
google it
07:06
you're in worth a try
07:09
although the queen does muck around with
07:11
her own identity a bit
07:12
so recently um one of the former royal
07:14
protection officers told
07:16
the story about because he worked with
07:17
her for about 30 years and she was out
07:19
for a walk near balmoral her estate
07:20
there
07:21
and they bumped into a group of american
07:23
tourists
07:24
and they said um they spoke to her they
07:27
said does she live in the area
07:28
and she said well i've got a house in
07:30
the area which is very modest
07:32
and they said have you ever met the
07:33
queen and she said no
07:36
and then she pointed at the royal
07:37
protection officer and she said but he
07:39
[Music]
07:40
[Applause]
07:43
that's has she gets some good gifts
07:47
birthday presents and general presents
07:49
whenever she visits anywhere okay
07:50
um and so they range from i think last
07:54
year
07:54
a horse breeder called christina paterno
07:57
gave her five thousand pounds worth of
07:59
stud sperm of horse sperm
08:01
so that she could sperm 5000 pounds
08:05
five pounds worth yeah
08:13
there's one tired stallion
08:16
if i can think of the queen that's
08:19
two obs down
08:23
it's just you and me now
08:26
did they actually give her the sperm
08:28
itself because i heard that this lady
08:30
christina pattino
08:31
offered to let one of the royal mers
08:33
visit her stallion
08:34
big bad bob
08:38
but she gets quite cumbersome gifts and
08:40
i always wonder with this sort of thing
08:42
how she gets them home so brazil has
08:45
given her
08:46
two sloths she got a maori canoe when
08:48
she went to new zealand um well you put
08:50
the sloths in the canoe
08:53
what do you think she rode home
08:56
she also got given seven kilos of prawns
08:59
on one occasion
09:02
oh my god um she already is the most
09:05
boring sentence
09:09
queen being sent seven kilos of prawns i
09:12
think it's a very fascinating sentence
09:14
it's got possibilities um the uh the
09:16
queen sent
09:17
an email in 1976 nope that's the most
09:21
boring sentence
09:23
[Laughter]
09:25
this legend goes too far um
09:28
and malvin there it is
09:32
but what does the email say do we know
09:34
no i know her user name though oh
09:36
no really yeah big bad bob
09:41
it was hme 2 her majesty elizabeth ii
09:44
and it was an extremely boring email i
09:46
think it said
09:47
this is her majesty the queen sending an
09:49
email or something like that
09:50
yeah yeah it's really awesome stuff uh
09:52
anything else before we move on she's
09:53
been to the moon
09:54
in a sense keep talking
09:57
[Laughter]
10:00
when uh when apollo 11 landed on the
10:01
moon there were
10:03
neil armstrong took out a special
10:04
message left congratulatory message
10:06
saying well done on getting to the moon
10:08
and um left it there deliberately i
10:10
think his instructions were to just
10:11
leave it in a metal canister on the
10:12
surface of the moon
10:13
and the message was from the queen yeah
10:15
okay that's not going to the moon it's
10:17
not like everyone who's got the birthday
10:18
letter from the queen says oh the queen
10:20
came round to my house
10:21
[Laughter]
10:24
okay let's move on to our next fact time
10:26
for fact number two
10:28
and that is anna chazinski yeah my fact
10:31
is that the brazilian vice president
10:34
accidentally released his presidential
10:36
acceptance speech
10:37
by sending it to the wrong whatsapp
10:39
group
10:40
[Laughter]
10:45
i should add so he claims
10:48
there's skepticism about this um but
10:51
yeah i don't so brazil has been in a bit
10:53
of turmoil recently a political turmoil
10:55
um the president dilma rousseff uh has
10:58
just uh congress the lower house in
11:00
brazil has just voted to impeach her
11:02
um but before they voted to impeach her
11:05
the vice president michelle temer
11:07
was obviously practicing his oh when she
11:09
gets kicked out i
11:10
i need to make a speech and i better
11:12
work out what that's going to be and he
11:13
recorded a 15-minute long speech
11:16
and then sent it he said intended to
11:18
send it to one friend
11:20
and accidentally sent it to the what's
11:22
that group that must have been just
11:23
below which was a whole bunch of mps and
11:26
lawyers
11:28
we've all done it
11:32
but sending a 15-minute speech by audio
11:35
that's going to take
11:36
ages on whatsapp that's going to load so
11:38
either he put it down or he spent 15
11:40
minutes going
11:44
terrifying 15 moments in politics
11:48
no there are theories that uh this was
11:50
an intentional move to
11:51
um state that he did not feel good about
11:54
the current president um
11:56
but yeah he says whatsapp error so
11:59
they've just voted haven't they the
12:00
lower house you said too yes to impeach
12:01
the president um the thing is
12:03
the the lower house is also in a bit of
12:05
turmoil i didn't realize that uh
12:06
that brazil has quite as big a
12:08
corruption problem as it does so
12:10
of the 594 members of the congress who
12:14
voted
12:15
60 of them are currently under
12:17
investigation or facing investigation
12:20
for i'm quoting here serious charges
12:22
like bribery electoral fraud illegal
12:25
deforestation
12:26
kidnapping and homicide
12:28
[Laughter]
12:32
i think yeah that's that's congress and
12:34
the senate the 594 so it's in both
12:36
houses so at the moment it's just gone
12:37
through congress
12:38
and there are yeah like 303 out of 513
12:41
but then as soon as the vote goes to the
12:42
senate
12:43
an even higher proportion of them are
12:44
really corrupt and the three people in
12:47
line to replace her when she is
12:48
impeached are also facing criminal
12:50
corruption charges
12:53
it's a real good situation out there
12:55
that's true and they're all protesting
12:57
at the moment are they in brazil
12:58
they are um i read that in the last year
13:00
there's been more protesters in brazil
13:02
than the entire rest of the world
13:04
combined
13:05
what wow it's like literally like three
13:08
million at a time
13:09
just complaining yeah that's awesome
13:12
just complaining those are the hawking
13:14
attitude the democracy
13:16
and the will of the people i just go out
13:19
in the streets of my placard
13:24
but isn't it the case as well that they
13:26
had they pro government protesters and
13:28
the anti-government protesters and
13:29
they've just put a big wall in the
13:30
middle of them
13:31
yes they've thought well what's a good
13:33
example from the past where a massive
13:35
wall
13:36
between two groups of people who
13:37
disagree has solved a problem
13:40
yeah two meters high right down the
13:42
middle of the capital city
13:44
wow amazing um just just taking it back
13:46
to the kind of
13:47
incompetence of politicians with social
13:49
media i thought i found one that has
13:51
really good intentions
13:52
but it has slightly gone wrong as well
13:54
so i don't know if you guys know this
13:55
but on twitter sweden
13:57
has a it's a country that has an
13:58
official twitter account
14:00
oh yeah so it's at sweden um and so you
14:02
think okay who runs that sweden they
14:04
made the decision that they're going to
14:05
allow
14:06
their own members of the public run it
14:09
one person a time
14:10
one week a time so they just hand it
14:12
over and so
14:13
the current person running it is called
14:15
isabelle this is her pin
14:16
tweet i don't do fika i don't do dating
14:19
i drink beer and [ __ ]
14:21
that is the
14:24
official first tweet you see from sweden
14:30
did you see that as well that you can
14:31
ring up sweden has anyone seen this
14:33
this is pretty cool isn't it like they
14:35
have a phone number and you can just
14:36
call up and they just connect you to a
14:38
random swede
14:39
yeah that sounds great what so says
14:42
someone's at home and their phone's
14:43
ringing
14:44
yeah you just pick it up and you sign up
14:45
for it you sign up for this thing and
14:47
then someone from anywhere around the
14:48
world at any time can just ring you up
14:50
and say hi is that sweden
14:53
and you say yeah i'm into [ __ ] you
14:56
know
14:58
or whatever
15:01
i i'd sign up for it if it was ring a
15:04
british person
15:05
would you really dial a brit would you
15:08
because
15:08
like in the office you don't really like
15:10
talking to us
15:13
no but you notice i constantly stare at
15:14
my phone looking haunted and alone
15:18
um so on politicians and social media
15:22
jeremy corbyn has been doing a big
15:23
social media push and has
15:25
joined um snapchat let's see
15:29
which yeah which is what exactly please
15:35
so it's pretty sure i think is it where
15:37
people send
15:38
naked photos of themselves to the people
15:40
they're having affairs with yeah
15:41
and then i'm not sure that's exactly
15:43
what jeremy corbyn will be doing
15:47
but yeah it's that one where yeah the
15:48
photo disappears you probably all know
15:50
that
15:50
um so he's joined snapchat and he's
15:53
posted a few photos um some of his first
15:55
ones a few of them were sideways
15:56
and um one of them was extremely blurry
16:00
and then most images of him signing
16:02
forms um
16:03
but yeah and he's also joined instagram
16:05
and his first post was of a tonic's tea
16:07
cake
16:08
so it's very exciting actually
16:12
very exciting stuff going on in jeremy
16:13
corbyn's social media academy
16:15
no it's good to see them embracing it i
16:17
think i think it's really cool but yeah
16:18
they do
16:19
they do get it spectacularly wrong
16:20
sometimes um on twitter there was
16:23
uh i thought this is great there was a
16:24
dutch politician this was back in 2011.
16:26
i apologize for the rudeness of this in
16:28
advance but um
16:30
he was he was sending a text which he
16:32
thought he was sending
16:33
to a lover and uh
16:36
and he accidentally tweeted it
16:40
and uh the the uh big bad thought
16:46
so the translation of the tweet roughly
16:48
goes as you throbbingly climax for the
16:50
first time i feel
16:53
in my mouth as if they were the nectar
16:56
of love
16:57
right he didn't lose his job off the
17:00
tweet but he did gain 20 new followers
17:06
so sometimes it works in their favor
17:10
just some basic facts about this kind of
17:12
thing um
17:13
facebook messenger and whatsapp and that
17:15
kind of thing is so popular now a lot
17:17
more than any other kind of um
17:19
ways of communicating so there are 60
17:21
billion messages
17:23
every day through some kind of messenger
17:25
and that's the first is 23 billion by
17:27
text message
17:28
and that means in two days there are
17:30
more messages sent
17:32
than humans have ever been alive whoa
17:35
oh god yeah it's absolutely massive in
17:38
brazil as well isn't it that's why
17:40
so i think brazilians send uh twice use
17:43
whatsapp
17:43
on i'm just gonna
17:47
none of these words were familiar to me
17:49
before today i'm really struggling
17:50
with them she called it snappidychat
17:54
brazilians use social media even more
17:59
than i do no they spend twice as much
18:02
time on social media as americans
18:04
which i would have thought is going over
18:06
100 of you the time that you're alive
18:09
in china as well ginormous so they have
18:11
a version of twitter out there which is
18:13
called uh cineweibu it's uh
18:15
it's ginormous stephen hawking joined it
18:17
uh just a couple of days ago he got two
18:19
million followers
18:20
in 24 hours like that's just how quickly
18:23
and what a massive group you can get but
18:24
he had 2 million and 20
18:26
after he accidentally
18:28
[Laughter]
18:31
well he's he is sending his tweets in
18:32
chinese and
18:34
apparently just from the reports i'm
18:36
reading that people are saying
18:38
i have no idea what he's saying it's in
18:40
chinese but i have no idea what he's
18:41
saying um but i'd like to just say
18:43
thanks for being on here so they they
18:44
kind of really appreciate the fact that
18:46
such a cool guy's on there despite the
18:48
fact he's making no sense for these
18:49
tweets
18:51
there is a chinese i think it's a
18:53
chinese instant messaging
18:54
app i think it's a dating app i'm going
18:57
off memory here so i'm not sure the
18:58
details but
18:59
if you send a message which says
19:01
something like do you want to get a room
19:03
or something like that if you put in
19:04
particular characters it flashes up with
19:06
a warning saying you're sure about
19:09
yeah that's that if only you're um
19:12
throbbingly
19:13
nectar man
19:14
[Music]
19:17
so about presidents yeah and stuff like
19:19
this so um president obama
19:21
is the only person outside hbo who's
19:24
going to watch game of thrones before it
19:26
goes on air
19:28
okay now we know his real agenda
19:30
[Laughter]
19:33
and there was a journalist who was
19:35
called vanessa golombski
19:37
who thought if the president has a file
19:40
of game of thrones
19:41
then surely i can get that file through
19:44
freedom of information
19:46
and so she's going to president obama
19:48
saying i want this file through
19:50
freedom of information and they're going
19:51
to see if they can get it but the only
19:52
problem is
19:53
that the average amount of time to get a
19:55
file is 121 days
19:57
and by that time we'll have already seen
19:59
it by about two months
20:00
it's the principle it's the principle
20:02
exactly but it's a nice idea isn't it
20:04
just on world leaders i was reading
20:06
today uh that
20:08
uh vladimir putin did a q a a sort of
20:10
big
20:11
wide q and a where anyone could ask
20:13
questions and i looked through the q a
20:15
they translated it into english and my
20:17
favorite question was from a 12 year old
20:19
girl who asked him
20:21
who he would save if uh if these people
20:23
were drowning the turkish president or
20:25
the ukrainian leader
20:29
who would you save if that was the
20:31
situation 12 year old girl
20:34
and putin said if someone has decided to
20:36
drown
20:37
it's probably already impossible to save
20:39
them anyway
20:41
he did say oh but we would lend a
20:43
helping hand to whoever is in need but
20:45
that was his first response
20:48
okay it is time for fact number three
20:52
and that is andrew hunter murray my fact
20:54
is
20:55
that a german city is fighting global
20:58
terror
20:58
by banning number plates starting with i
21:01
s
21:03
every little helps yeah absolutely uh
21:06
this is the city of marburg in germany
21:08
and um if you want to get a special uh
21:11
license plate um
21:12
what's it called like a one-off
21:13
personalized personalized license plate
21:16
uh with ios at the start you will no
21:17
longer be allowed to do that so you'll
21:19
have to leave
21:20
marburg get it done somewhere else where
21:21
it's legal and then go back to marburg
21:24
that will cost you petrol and it slows
21:26
down uh
21:27
oh yes yeah i didn't realize that um
21:30
license plates are so
21:32
strict um so the dvla is extremely
21:34
strict about the license plates that can
21:35
go out
21:36
and so they they have a meeting every
21:38
six months i think
21:39
where they go through and work out all
21:41
the possible combinations that could be
21:43
construed
21:44
as rude and um so that sounds like a
21:46
great job doesn't it
21:47
so fun yeah so much imagination required
21:50
a lot of them i couldn't quite work out
21:51
why they would be rude um it's
21:53
so it's a 49-page document the latest
21:55
one and it is very good reading
21:58
none of it is appropriate for tonight um
22:00
for instance there are two letter
22:02
combinations that are banned uh
22:03
two of the two letter combinations are
22:05
mn and nf and i have no idea what
22:08
why they're rude um naughty naughty
22:11
fisting
22:14
could you tell me a kind of fisting that
22:15
isn't naughty
22:16
[Laughter]
22:19
there's a sentence
22:26
just doing a survey
22:29
um but yeah they go through and they
22:31
list all the two letter combinations
22:32
that are bad or the three letters that
22:34
are bad so you're not allowed
22:35
on any number plates c-u-m c-o-k i think
22:38
i'm allowed to say all this because i'm
22:39
just spelling it out
22:40
um cnt you're an upset because you're
22:43
not a car
22:44
[Laughter]
22:48
always shattering my dreams
22:49
[Laughter]
22:51
um bnp yeah i think that's a real snap
22:54
in the face if you're a political party
22:55
that's not even allowed on number plate
22:56
so i wonder if instead of naughty
22:58
fisting it's national front
23:00
it could be the national front
23:04
i think it's naughty fisting guys
23:08
but there are some which are really sort
23:10
of you can't have
23:12
va61ana because it looks a bit like
23:16
vagina right but to me that looks like
23:19
vagina
23:21
so it's a very odd sort of the rules of
23:23
really um you're not allowed to have
23:25
uh a11 nob all knob
23:29
um which if you get that number plate is
23:31
an accurate description of what you are
23:34
a lot of these aren't personalized
23:35
though so don't hold it against a lot of
23:37
these are number plates that
23:38
would be in the standard rotation but
23:40
they have to specifically remove them
23:41
like ma5
23:42
tbt you see it takes a lot of thought
23:46
if you can work out this one wait hang
23:48
on
23:51
let me show it to you that's very rude
23:55
all right i've got see if you can work
23:56
out this one x351
23:58
aro well this is great radio
24:04
and if you're playing along at home you
24:05
can write it down
24:07
no um so that is look at it backwards in
24:09
mirror writing
24:10
and it spells out is it oral sex
24:16
it's because if you're looking backwards
24:17
in your car right yeah yeah
24:19
yeah they have to test that they have to
24:20
test the mirror mirror writing that's
24:22
yeah
24:22
smart so close although the r would be
24:25
backwards so be like russian yeah
24:27
have you got food james is super fun to
24:31
have a road trip with by the way
24:32
[Laughter]
24:35
there's um there's a new app that's out
24:37
uh which
24:38
is it seems quite an exciting idea it's
24:40
called plext and the idea is that
24:42
when you're driving you need to have so
24:44
you need to hope this person has the app
24:45
as well but
24:46
you can text their license plate and the
24:49
text gets through to them so if
24:51
someone's driving in front of you
24:52
and this is what they kind of think it's
24:54
made for it's like someone's driving in
24:55
front of you and they're doing a really
24:56
good job
24:57
why don't you text them but you're not
25:00
allowed to text while driving
25:02
i know it's i don't know how the system
25:03
works but it uh that's what it's meant
25:05
to be it's meant to be allowing you to
25:07
communicate with other drivers to
25:08
to tell them good things about their
25:10
driving i think that's
25:12
entrapment legally isn't it is it isn't
25:15
that when you persuade someone to do a
25:16
crime and then you convict them of that
25:18
crime
25:18
well when they waste this on the
25:19
catherine's easter jones film when they
25:21
finish
25:23
but they'll finish their journey and
25:24
then they'll safely retrieve their phone
25:26
from the glove compartment where we all
25:27
put it when we drive
25:29
yeah and then they'll turn it on and
25:30
then they'll get the message then good
25:31
job
25:32
yeah maybe um some comedy about isis
25:36
yes that's why everyone came tonight
25:39
um so in the news this week um there was
25:42
a guy called franco roberti who is
25:44
italy's top prosecutor and he says that
25:47
stoners who are trying to get um
25:49
marijuana legalized are helping the
25:51
fight against isis
25:53
really yeah
25:58
how quickly the stone is turning
26:01
whatever yes
26:02
we'll do it and the idea is that
26:05
the italian mafia and isis are working
26:08
together to kind of bring
26:10
marijuana over from north africa into
26:12
italy and they reckon if it was legal
26:14
then they wouldn't have that way of
26:15
making money
26:17
wow so on the subject of isis i don't
26:21
know if there are any archer fans in the
26:23
room but everyone should be wrong
26:26
yeah one of the radio falls the archers
26:30
not the archers archer the car oh my god
26:33
i've just lost everyone
26:37
um so in arch of this tv series archer
26:39
yeah it's about
26:40
uh all right hang on hang on a bit
26:42
quickly the archers
26:45
it's about the same um stoner just is
26:48
cheering at everything
26:50
he doesn't know what's going on
26:51
[Laughter]
26:54
so faked out of his gorb in the front
26:56
row
26:59
you've read those words in a book
27:03
drug language of the streets fifth
27:04
edition
27:06
is this ever gonna am i in archer
27:10
the main character archer and all his
27:12
colleagues work for a
27:14
company called isis is a bunch of
27:15
spiders called isis and in 2014 when
27:17
things started kicking off a little bit
27:18
elsewhere um then the program makers
27:21
decided they had to change the name um
27:23
so isis says everyone who watches archer
27:24
will know has been removed
27:26
from archer and actually there was quite
27:27
a good episode at the uh beginning of
27:29
series i think was the first episode of
27:30
series five or six
27:31
where you saw in the background as
27:33
mallory was on the phone to archer you
27:34
saw in the background too
27:35
trucks with isis his logo disappearing
27:38
into the sunset
27:39
um but this created a serious problem
27:41
because it's a really popular show and
27:43
they had shed loads of merchandise
27:46
they just shipped it off to syria
27:51
you joke the creator adam reid said that
27:54
in a board meeting he suggested this
27:56
joke alien was met with an icy silence
27:58
so he should have been here and said but
28:00
he also said that um
28:01
he complained that i gave my dad one of
28:03
the isis hats
28:05
and in the end he had to call me and say
28:07
you know son i'm not gonna be able to
28:09
wear that hat anymore
28:11
i'm getting some weird looks in the
28:12
hardware store
28:16
so i have a list of places which have
28:19
had to change their
28:20
name which were called isis and have uh
28:22
decided that it's not worth it anymore
28:24
so there's a mobile banking app
28:26
um there's a nail salon in oakland
28:28
california
28:29
a danish pudding company a belgian
28:32
chocolate firm
28:33
and a wife swapping club in leeds
28:37
[Applause]
28:38
and presumably they were just getting
28:40
too much confusion from people
28:44
people go there and engage in all sorts
28:46
of fun and products and they say it's
28:47
not worth the aggro um so
28:49
there was the net the nail salon in
28:50
oakland they changed their name because
28:51
people
28:52
were genuinely making rude comments and
28:54
rude phone calls saying i can't believe
28:56
you guys you're sickos
28:58
they got some good feedback though
29:00
because one person sent wrote an online
29:01
review of i remind you a nail salon in
29:03
california
29:04
saying in the last week isis gave me a
29:06
real nice treatment don't know why we
29:07
are bombing them
29:13
okay it is time for our final fact of
29:18
the show
29:19
and that is my fact my fact this week
29:22
is that the north pole is on a head-on
29:25
collision course
29:26
with greenwich london
29:29
where we are right now this has just
29:32
happened
29:32
20 years ago um but we've just noticed
29:36
it's been going one way it's been
29:37
heading towards canada the north pole
29:39
and mysteriously they have no idea why
29:41
it's suddenly just flipped not not a
29:43
complete flip but it's changed direction
29:45
and it is now headed along greenwich
29:46
meridian so it is heading
29:48
right here where we are right now we
29:50
could be the north pole
29:51
in about a lot of millions of years
29:55
you know they do know why do they have
29:57
they worked that's what they've
29:58
discovered this week
29:59
is um i should have read the article
30:04
so this to be clear this isn't the
30:06
magnetic north pole which also moves
30:08
quite a bit um this is the geographic
30:09
north pole so this is just uh the earth
30:12
wobbles on its axis
30:13
because it's not a perfect sphere it's
30:15
got kind of lumps and bumps on it and
30:16
it's got different masses in different
30:18
places
30:18
so if you imagine sort of spinning a
30:20
sphere around then it's going to
30:22
like it's like it's as if the earth is
30:24
like um a basketball and you're kind of
30:26
spinning it on your finger
30:27
and your finger is where the south pole
30:29
would be and then directly above it is
30:31
where the north pole will be
30:32
exactly like that and thank you very
30:34
much for the metaphor james
30:35
simile and what's happened is
30:39
they thought at first the reason it was
30:41
moving was because of the greenland ice
30:43
caps melting
30:43
but actually they've been doing the
30:45
study since 2005
30:47
and they've realized that what it is is
30:49
a water loss from eurasia
30:51
bizarrely which sort of changes the
30:53
masses in the earth so a huge mass of
30:55
water has been lost from
30:56
the india and from asia and that's just
30:59
changed the
31:00
sort of waiting and the lumps and bumps
31:02
in the earth and has caused the earth to
31:03
start spinning a bit differently start
31:05
pivoting differently
31:06
and it's gradually creeping towards us
31:08
but it is but it has happened very
31:09
suddenly hasn't it
31:10
we should say the speed at which it's
31:12
moving which is 17 centimeters a year
31:15
which is about the same as hair growth
31:20
yeah the the funny thing about that is
31:21
because i remember reading a good few
31:23
years ago that russia
31:24
found the geographical north pole and
31:26
put a pole in there at the bottom of the
31:28
ocean
31:29
and put a russian flag on it because the
31:31
geographic north pole was kind of
31:33
disputed between canada denmark i think
31:35
and russia
31:36
and russia wanted to say no it's ours
31:38
and they put a flag there but it's not
31:40
there anymore it's like
31:41
17 centimeters away from here but still
31:44
not exactly where they said it was are
31:46
they gonna send someone to think all the
31:47
way there to move it
31:49
um yeah maybe although it's down at the
31:51
bottom of a very very cold ocean so i
31:53
think
31:53
maybe not um i discovered a fact this
31:56
week which i i think is really really
31:57
interesting which is in 1985. did you
31:59
guys know this
32:01
neil armstrong went to the north pole
32:02
did he yeah did he go in the sense that
32:04
the queen went to the moon
32:08
no the queen went but with a letter from
32:10
neil which he left
32:12
no neil armstrong went to the north pole
32:15
with
32:15
edmund hillary so the first man to reach
32:18
the top of everest
32:19
went with the first man to stand on the
32:20
moon and with steve fawcett who was the
32:22
first person to go around the earth
32:24
how do we know i know isn't that really
32:26
odd so they flew there they didn't
32:28
actually do the track they flew there
32:29
and they landed
32:30
and they went to the pole and it was
32:32
with edmund hillary's son as well who's
32:34
also a big explorer
32:35
and then on their way back um they were
32:37
staying in a hut which was still in icy
32:39
conditions and
32:40
the storms around them the icy storms
32:42
were so great that they got stuck in the
32:44
hut
32:44
for a number of days and all they could
32:47
do was chat and apparently it was the
32:48
first time ever that neil armstrong
32:50
completely opened up about his
32:51
experience on the moon
32:53
he'd never done that before to anyone
32:54
and so peter hillary who's the son of
32:57
edmund hillary has the
32:58
total scoop on what was said because no
33:00
one else is alive who was there
33:02
in that room and what and
33:05
he says all right he just said you know
33:08
he
33:08
said left a letter and he uh came back
33:11
no but it's not amazing neil armstrong
33:13
and and the person who organized it
33:14
wanted to bring the people who'd done
33:15
firsts
33:16
to the place on earth where uh where
33:19
they'd never been before
33:20
okay so it wasn't a big coincidence they
33:22
didn't all get there and go
33:24
well you went to the moon are you
33:26
serious okay
33:27
no um they had the north pole marathon
33:29
this week did you see that oh yeah
33:31
yeah it was won by a man from arkansas
33:33
and he ran the race in five hours 17
33:36
minutes
33:37
um but the record is three hours 36
33:40
minutes
33:40
and the reason is because it really
33:42
really matters on the conditions
33:46
like it's not like the london marathon
33:48
where you've got a bit of rain or
33:49
something that makes a difference it
33:50
makes a massive difference
33:52
um they call it the coolest marathon in
33:54
the world
33:58
uh and they have polar bear guards all
34:01
along the route wait hang on no yeah
34:02
wait wait wait are the guards
34:04
i see what you're saying here it's
34:07
people guarding against polar bears
34:09
shame
34:12
because i would run faster
34:15
[Laughter]
34:17
no i marathon as well the first one
34:21
happened in 2002 it hasn't been going
34:23
that long and it only had one
34:24
participant who was also
34:26
who was also the organizer
34:30
yeah and the entire course is floating
34:32
on top of obviously on fourteen thousand
34:34
feet of arctic ocean
34:35
there's an interesting thing about the
34:37
ice which is that um it might be the
34:39
last time ever that people ever walk to
34:41
the north pole or it won't happen that
34:43
often because the ice is melting and
34:44
there's not much waste water
34:46
and even if you are walking to the north
34:48
pole the ice often moves southwards so
34:50
you can be walking for days and days and
34:52
be further away than you were when you
34:54
started
34:54
oh wow oh my god that's horrible yeah i
34:58
read um there was a guy called wally
34:59
herbert
35:00
and he was
35:03
two words meaning you're a bit of a div
35:06
really
35:06
yeah well he was an amazing explorer
35:11
so he was trying to prove because it was
35:13
a lot of dispute about whether or not
35:15
peery was the first person yeah so he he
35:18
was trying to
35:19
recreate the trip and see if he'd made
35:20
it there so the idea is that robert
35:22
perry
35:22
claims to have walked over the north
35:24
pole but people kind of not sure whether
35:26
he did or not yeah they weren't
35:27
they weren't sure so he he tried to
35:29
recreate it his his uh
35:30
conclusion was that perry didn't do it
35:32
that he did in fact doctor the books but
35:35
in doing so uh wally herbert became the
35:37
first person to do it
35:38
um so you obviously have to use
35:40
compasses and work out where the north
35:42
pole was
35:43
um and because of the shift that's going
35:44
on all the time it's hard to tell
35:46
so they did this marathon trek this one
35:48
day and and they got to this point where
35:50
they thought let's stop and let's see
35:51
where it is and they realized they'd
35:53
walked past it
35:54
they got to it kept walking didn't
35:56
bother to check so suddenly
35:57
they were just like oh my god what are
35:58
we going to do let's walk back and
36:00
wally herbert said no let's not walk
36:02
back let's go to sleep
36:04
they went to sleep and because of the
36:05
way that it was shifting in the morning
36:06
they were back at the spot where the
36:08
north pole was
36:09
because they worked out the hours of the
36:11
shift that would happen so he slept his
36:13
way to the north
36:16
don't say it like that sound like a
36:20
bitter rival
36:20
[Laughter]
36:25
okay that's it that's all of our facts
36:27
thank you so much for listening
36:29
see you next week goodbye
36:39
[Music]
36:48
you

=112
00:04
[Music]
00:11
hello
00:12
and welcome to another episode of no
00:14
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:16
this week coming to you from
00:17
edinburgh my name is dan schreiber and
00:19
please welcome to the stage
00:20
it's anna chazinski jen tarkin and andy
00:28
murray
00:29
[Applause]
00:32
and once again we have gathered around
00:34
the microphones with our four
00:35
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:37
and in no particular order here we go
00:39
starting with you andrew hunter murray
00:41
my fact this week is that antarctica
00:43
exports
00:44
used toilet paper who wants it
00:47
i see why they want to get rid of it i
00:49
want to know who wants it at the other
00:50
end
00:51
well it's not so much that anyone else
00:53
wants it
00:54
it's that they they can't leave it there
00:56
so there are loads of different research
00:58
bases uh in antarctica
00:59
they they used to do very bad things
01:01
they used to just dump it into the sea
01:03
and that you know can obviously be very
01:04
bad or it introduces uh foreign
01:07
microorganisms which can then
01:08
have knock-on effects on the whole
01:09
ecosystem so some people
01:11
incinerate it now but there there are
01:13
companies which do uh tourism to
01:15
antarctica
01:16
and they export uh feces and urine and
01:19
usually
01:20
that's part of the holiday you sign up
01:21
to as you go to watch them picking up
01:23
used toilet paper it's not a big part of
01:26
the itinerary
01:28
but if you are uh doing an expedition to
01:30
the pole or outside a research base you
01:32
basically have to carry your own poo
01:34
behind you on a sled
01:35
wow yeah but the good thing is it
01:38
freezes so it's you know it's better
01:42
right it's not the most silver of
01:44
lightnings
01:47
do you do you guys remember that story
01:48
that um just speaking of it freezing or
01:50
poo freezing there was a story told by
01:52
an explorer called wade davis a big
01:54
anthropologist amazing guy and he was
01:56
talking about a guy
01:57
um who who lit i can't remember where
02:00
exactly he lived but there was a lot of
02:02
ice
02:02
and he uh refused to move there were
02:04
people trying to say you should move out
02:05
of here and he said i don't want to move
02:07
out of here
02:07
so what he ended up doing was building
02:08
up weapons that he could use against
02:10
them and what he did was he made
02:12
a blue knife so so he froze his poo
02:16
and he and he positioned it in its shape
02:19
to be
02:19
knife like and when it froze he had a
02:22
dagger and
02:22
uh it was for attacking people not for
02:24
eating with uh
02:26
well probably double that to be honest
02:28
um
02:29
did he ever get to wield it quite a
02:31
weird story he ended up saying that he
02:32
had a few huskies and he said he
02:34
actually
02:35
eventually escaped the place and what he
02:36
did was he had to have a sled so he
02:38
killed one of his
02:40
uh huskies with the poo knife he uh he
02:42
then ate the the
02:44
food of the dog um in order to survive
02:47
then
02:47
he crafted the inside bones of the rib
02:49
cage into a small sled and he tucked his
02:51
poo pipe into his belt
02:52
and he rode off into the distance
02:57
this is a dream i promise you wade davis
03:01
google it wade davis poo
03:14
so when shackleton went to the south
03:16
pole they ran out of toilet paper very
03:18
quickly but what they did have was two
03:20
full editions of the encyclopedia
03:22
britannica yeah
03:24
and so when it got desperate that's what
03:26
they used the they used it for
03:28
also for smoking tobacco as well as for
03:30
toilet paper um but dr alexander macklin
03:33
who was a surgeon
03:34
tore out the entry on scurvy because he
03:36
didn't want anyone wiping with it
03:38
because he thought it was really really
03:39
important
03:40
really yeah and there was a physicist
03:42
there called reginald james who saved
03:44
the section on geometry
03:46
why what if we get to the poll and
03:48
there's a test
03:54
i think books have been used through the
03:56
centuries haven't they as you'd imagine
03:58
really because toilet paper wasn't
03:59
invented until relatively recently and
04:01
so um yeah then ability would use
04:03
pages of books to to wipe their asses
04:05
with um i think a popular
04:07
uh thing that people used as lu roll in
04:09
america was call on the cob
04:11
until toilet roll was invented but isn't
04:13
it the case with corn on the cob that
04:15
it's one of those foods that actually
04:16
comes out as corn still on the other
04:18
side so you'd be wiping it you're just
04:20
putting it back
04:20
on to the thing you just ate
04:26
so there's a almanac called the farmer's
04:29
almanac which
04:30
still exists today i think and in the
04:32
from 1818
04:34
the farmer's almanac in america came
04:37
with
04:37
a hole punched in the top left-hand
04:40
corner i think
04:41
and that was because it was known that
04:43
people would use it once they'd read it
04:44
or mid-read or whatever they'd they'd
04:46
pin it to their wall and they'd use it
04:47
as lu roll
04:48
and so it came with a hole pre-punched
04:50
in it so that they could bang it into
04:51
the wall
04:53
that's really interesting we write books
04:55
for qi
04:56
and when when we did a fact book
04:59
we got um a request from the netherlands
05:01
and they said we want to put a hole in
05:03
the top corner
05:04
they said it was for the shower so they
05:07
could read it in the shower but that
05:08
never made sense to me no one reads in
05:10
the shower no they don't do they
05:12
no they do like their bums with things
05:15
yeah
05:17
so the world's most expensive toilet
05:20
paper is
05:21
825 000 pounds a roll
05:25
okay um it's personally delivered to you
05:28
with a bottle of champagne
05:30
um and as you use it 24 karat gold
05:33
flakes will
05:34
fall to the floor and you're behind
05:37
taking you to another level of
05:39
sophistication
05:41
that's according to their website and
05:43
they've only managed to make one roll at
05:45
the moment
05:46
and i don't think they've actually sold
05:48
it
05:49
but if you've got 800 grand to spare why
05:52
the hell not
05:53
yeah saddam hussein had a solid gold
05:55
toilet roll holder actually he didn't
05:56
name it
05:57
yeah yeah speaking of world leaders i
06:00
was looking into what uh obama has i
06:03
thought the white house must have some
06:04
interesting
06:05
uh toilet paper and actually
06:08
and they do but it's not it's it's not
06:10
incredible it's just uh it's just got
06:12
the presidential seal on a bunch of
06:14
the toilet paper um surely that's
06:16
disrespectful
06:18
yeah you think actually yeah yeah um so
06:21
i was thinking about the pope as well i
06:22
thought what does he use
06:23
um because i just wanted he uses the
06:26
doves i know this
06:30
just a little it just has a whole box in
06:32
the loop
06:35
that's lovely i've i've got a fact about
06:39
the antarctic but i feel we've
06:40
stretched let's go back let's go back
06:43
finish off your thing yeah
06:43
i was just going to say about the pope
06:45
um we know a bit about the toilet paper
06:47
not in his actual
06:48
papal in the vatican but he has a summer
06:50
house and we know about it because
06:51
myleene class the singer
06:53
stole a roll of the toilet paper um she
06:56
hands it out as christmas presents now
06:58
should she collect weird things from
06:59
around the world let's go back to the
07:00
arctic sounds like
07:02
sounds like hearsay to me
07:03
[Applause]
07:07
see niche early 2000's reference there
07:12
sorry andy go on um how can i follow
07:15
that
07:17
um so there's a thing they have a
07:19
holiday and the antarctic people are
07:20
staying there called mid-winter day
07:22
and i got this from an interview with uh
07:23
with a woman who'd been living there for
07:25
eight years called
07:26
kerry nelson and she said it feels like
07:29
a real holiday and people actually send
07:30
e-greeting cards to each other from
07:32
other stations
07:33
saying things like happy mid-winter come
07:36
stop by our station for dinner which
07:38
nobody can because we're also isolated
07:40
so it's kind of a joke
07:45
sounds like the worst holiday ever i
07:47
know and the thing they they're so
07:48
isolated you can't get to another
07:50
station for most of the year
07:51
um and they're so far apart from each
07:52
other because it is massive so that one
07:54
thing they have had is they have darts
07:55
tournaments over the phone
07:57
where you throw a dart tell the other
07:59
person what
08:00
you've scored and then they tore it up
08:02
and they tell you
08:04
i might be wrong about this but
08:05
something in the back of my head says
08:06
that in the
08:07
let's say it's in the 20s or 30s they
08:09
used to have darts on the radio
08:12
and what they would do is you'd get a
08:13
professional dance player who'd throw
08:15
his scar
08:16
and then they would say he got let's say
08:18
180 or whatever
08:20
and then they'd have a gap of complete
08:21
silence while you threw your darts
08:26
and then they'd after about 30 seconds
08:28
then he'd throw another three
08:29
that didn't happen didn't it well right
08:31
yeah that did happen so you're saying
08:32
they basically hadn't done what qriket's
08:34
done which has worked out during those
08:35
bits you have to have someone actually
08:36
talking nonsense
08:38
yeah you can't just leave silence qriket
08:40
doesn't leave
08:41
a gap for you to take your own
08:45
over
08:46
[Laughter]
08:50
um should we move on to our next one
08:52
yeah okay it is time for fact number two
08:54
and that is anna jaczynski
08:56
yeah my fact is that planes are launched
08:59
off aircraft carriers by catapult
09:02
so they're catapulted of aircraft
09:04
carriers so the so these are when we see
09:06
uh those massive aircraft carriers and
09:09
you've only got that tiny runway and
09:10
they suddenly just
09:11
gain momentum really quickly yeah
09:13
exactly the runway is much too short for
09:15
for planes to gain the right amount of
09:18
speed necessary for them to take off so
09:19
they just go crashing into the sea
09:20
uh if they just used what planes
09:22
normally use which is their own
09:23
acceleration
09:24
so yeah they've got these catapults set
09:26
up and they call them catapults and
09:27
they're controlled by a catapult officer
09:29
which is the coolest job in the world
09:31
who sits in the catapult control pod
09:34
which if you look it up look up an
09:36
aircraft carrier you've got the
09:37
um the floor of the ship and then the
09:40
catapult control pod
09:41
is just this transparent disc that pops
09:44
up in the floor and he sits
09:46
with his head just above floor level so
09:48
he's at the level of his head's at the
09:50
level of the plane's wheels
09:51
and yeah how it works is that it's by a
09:53
system of pistons so the plane's
09:55
sitting there and it's got these uh two
09:58
cylinders
09:58
attached to it and these cylinders are
10:00
about as long as a football pitch
10:02
and um there are pistons in the
10:03
cylinders and the catapult officer
10:06
uh builds up all the lots of pressure uh
10:09
behind the pistons and at the moment the
10:10
plane needs to take off he releases all
10:12
of that pressure
10:13
and so of course the pistons are
10:14
released and the force of that catapults
10:16
the plane
10:17
uh into the air hopefully and it is the
10:20
most terrifying thing i've ever read
10:21
about
10:23
um the cool thing about these pistons is
10:24
that they're steam powered
10:26
yeah it's so weird thinking fighter jets
10:28
being launched by steam power but that's
10:29
what the pistons are full of yes steam
10:30
that's you know generated by the ship
10:32
but they're trying to make new ones
10:33
aren't they that are like electromagnets
10:35
yeah and they'll use those instead and
10:36
they're going to be much better because
10:38
you need fewer people to work them
10:39
and also you won't have to have like
10:41
massive steam pipes going on the side of
10:43
your ship that can sometimes blow up
10:45
yeah right yeah they do it's very
10:47
dangerous things seem to blow up all the
10:49
time on aircraft carriers
10:50
and people recently someone who was
10:52
working on the one of the us navy's
10:54
aircraft carriers i think got sucked
10:56
into the jet engine as he was walking
10:57
across
10:58
uh the boat and he was rescued actually
11:01
before he got sucked into the propellers
11:02
i think he got stuck
11:04
um i haven't actually watched the
11:06
footage thank god he was wearing his
11:07
enormous hat
11:08
[Laughter]
11:13
and the new electromagnetic ones they
11:15
are so so the the normal launch the
11:17
normal catapults that we have at the
11:18
moment for aircraft carriers
11:19
they accelerate the plane from uh no
11:21
miles an hour to 165 miles an hour in
11:23
two seconds whoa wow
11:26
and the new ones they're going to be
11:28
able to launch a plane every 45 seconds
11:30
from a ship with this electromagnetic
11:32
thing
11:32
and while it's happening it's using the
11:34
same amount of electricity as a town
11:37
what yeah that's amazing and it's only
11:39
it's very short it's only three seconds
11:40
that it's using it but it's exactly the
11:41
same electricity consumption as a town
11:44
wow um i i was reading about because i
11:48
was looking at pictures of the aircraft
11:49
carriers and they're ginormous
11:51
and i was trying to work out how big
11:53
they actually are
11:54
so the largest aircraft carrier that we
11:56
have if you took it out of the water and
11:59
you flipped it up
12:00
uh vertically it would be taller this is
12:03
the uss enterprise would be taller than
12:05
the eiffel tower
12:06
in wow yeah in its verticalness now
12:08
that's not even the biggest boat on
12:10
earth
12:10
right so just to give you those uh to
12:12
give you the numbers of this the longest
12:14
boat
12:15
on earth which is an oil tanker is 458
12:19
meters long if you flip that up on its
12:22
side
12:23
that's taller than the empire state
12:25
building
12:27
yeah a boat is taller than the empire i
12:29
read once that the biggest boats in the
12:31
world are so big they can't get through
12:33
the english channel
12:34
what i know did you read it in dan's
12:37
book of thought
12:41
no and it is and it turns out it is true
12:43
because it's the depth
12:44
it's not the it's not the width oh
12:46
that's the cheating i know it is like
12:48
they they
12:49
displace so much water that they
12:51
actually can't fit through because it's
12:52
too shallow wow wow
12:54
do you know how many parts there are in
12:56
the largest aircraft uh
12:57
carriers this is the us nimitz class
12:59
which is apparently the latest lot
13:01
they have a billion individual pieces
13:04
well a billion there's a billion things
13:06
that can go wrong yeah
13:07
and they're put together like lego it's
13:09
so cool they make a four-year-old
13:15
and if you tread on one at night it
13:17
hurts so much
13:21
um so another incredible thing that
13:23
everyone has to know about
13:24
is how landing happens on aircraft
13:27
carriers
13:28
so in fact question for you guys if you
13:31
were landing an
13:32
airplane on an aircraft carrier and you
13:34
know you have to stop as soon as
13:36
possible
13:36
as soon as your wheels touch the ground
13:38
what do you think you're gonna do as the
13:40
pilot
13:40
slam on the brakes walk those brakes on
13:42
absolutely incorrect you put on the
13:44
accelerator
13:45
rev the out of that and go as fast
13:47
as you can what
13:48
because the reason you do this is that
13:51
it's
13:51
so likely that something will go wrong
13:53
that all you're doing is the pilot is
13:55
preparing to take off again
13:57
off that aircraft carrier in the event
13:59
that something goes wrong
14:00
and the only thing that slows you down
14:02
is you've uh you've got this hook a tail
14:04
hook
14:05
that's hanging off the back of your
14:06
plane as you're landing and then you've
14:08
got these kind of
14:09
wires that are sort of made of steel and
14:11
they're attached to our hydraulic
14:12
uh motor they absorb the kinetic energy
14:15
so it's sort of like getting an elastic
14:17
band
14:17
uh to fly your plane into and that stops
14:21
the plane fast enough that it doesn't go
14:22
flying off the end of the aircraft
14:23
carrier
14:24
but so often they don't hook onto these
14:26
wires that all you're supposed to do is
14:28
as a pilot as you land on the aircraft
14:30
carriers go right foot down
14:31
ready to lift off again that's amazing
14:34
that is amazing that's cool isn't it
14:35
yeah
14:35
was it on qi i can't remember years and
14:37
years ago the idea that one of the frost
14:39
planes the way that it landed on a
14:41
aircraft carrier is that the people on
14:43
the aircraft carrier actually
14:44
pulled it down from the sky i feel that
14:47
might have come from the damn shrine a
14:49
big book of thoughts
14:50
actually no i think there's method here
14:54
there's something yeah i don't think
14:56
it's exactly that i think it was a
14:58
really early wright brothers
14:59
style thing possibly yeah sure right
15:02
brothers did use catapults sometimes
15:04
one of the first ever planes yeah
15:07
certainly the first one that did a full
15:08
circuit was
15:09
um yeah sent up by catapults it's really
15:12
cool very cool
15:13
oh can i tell you one extraordinary fact
15:15
as well this is the fact that really
15:17
took me over the edge uh
15:18
is that um when you are landing on an
15:21
aircraft carrier
15:22
some aircraft carriers so specifically
15:23
uh the navy's e2 hawkeye
15:26
avoid that if possible uh
15:29
the margin of error as you're landing is
15:31
one foot
15:33
so if you are one foot too early in your
15:36
landing you smash into the back of the
15:37
aircraft carrier and if you're one foot
15:39
too late
15:40
you go crashing off the end of it into
15:41
the sea oh my god
15:44
this is why i'm scared of flying because
15:46
every pilot has this kind of
15:48
cowboy attitude where you just die at
15:50
any moment
15:51
i flew out from salzburg right if you
15:53
ever go to salzburg airport
15:54
you're looking at the runway and i was
15:56
looking at it going oh that's that's
15:57
really interesting i'm sure we're not
15:59
taking off in this path because there's
16:00
a ginormous
16:01
mountain cliff base at the other end and
16:04
we started going that direction and i
16:05
there was a pilot sitting next to me who
16:07
was just flying back as a passenger
16:09
and i was like what if like what happens
16:11
if we don't get enough height and he
16:13
said
16:13
we'll go straight into the mountain
16:16
and i was like so why would you build it
16:19
like that so that that's a possible
16:20
thing and he went
16:21
just don't hit the mountain mate
16:24
that shouldn't be a thing i am i got a
16:28
flight from paro i think it's para
16:30
airport which is in bhutan and that one
16:32
you go it's quite a short um
16:34
takeoff and then right in front of you
16:36
there's a mountain
16:38
and so what he does he goes down towards
16:40
the mountain at the last second he banks
16:42
and then he turns around and there's
16:43
another no
16:46
and then he has to do another bank away
16:47
from that mountain because it's in the
16:49
himalayas
16:50
and there's nowhere there isn't
16:51
mountains and there's only a few
16:53
qualified pilots that are allowed to
16:54
yeah
16:54
right to fly into there yeah um just on
16:57
landing on aircraft carriers yeah and
16:59
taking off from aircraft carriers uh
17:01
so do you guys know about eric winkle
17:02
brown no
17:04
he flew in his life uh 487 different
17:07
types of aircraft and that's more than
17:10
anyone else ever has done is more than
17:11
anyone else ever will do
17:12
almost certainly um and he had loads of
17:15
firsts and he just had
17:16
sort of he was the first to land a jet
17:18
aircraft on an aircraft carrier
17:19
he interrogated senior nazis after the
17:21
war he crashed 11 times and he
17:23
said he often survived because he was
17:25
short he could tuck up his legs in the
17:27
cockpit rather than
17:28
having his legs shut off wow if yeah
17:32
um he did a motorbike wall of death with
17:34
a lion cub
17:38
don't say that casually like it's a
17:40
thing there was a very linear
17:42
job pattern going on there he got a new
17:46
sports car at the age of 95. he was
17:48
amazing
17:49
no no no hang on he
17:52
the motorbike wall of death i think the
17:54
lion cub was in a side car
17:56
so i trust that answers your question
17:58
i'm
18:01
yeah um and okay this is one other thing
18:03
about him which i find completely
18:04
unbelievable
18:05
um he flew in the battle of britain that
18:08
was
18:08
the time that he was flying a lot he
18:10
flew in a biplane in the battle of
18:12
britain
18:12
against planes which were not biplanes
18:14
they were really good planes um
18:16
but when they launched the v1 the flying
18:18
bomb
18:19
um he found that he he overtook
18:23
really close to them in a particular
18:24
kind of plane called a tempest
18:26
five and he would clip the wings of the
18:28
flying bomb
18:29
with his own wings and send them
18:31
plunging harmlessly into the english
18:32
channel
18:33
what wow he's lucky that stuff worked
18:36
because otherwise you've just described
18:38
mr bean like
18:39
[Laughter]
18:49
well he was an amazing guy and he passed
18:50
away just it was this year wasn't it
18:52
what was it last year it was yes january
18:54
february yeah right incredible guy
18:56
uh time for fact number three and that
18:58
is my fact
18:59
my fact is that apple used to give an
19:02
annual award
19:03
to the employee who best stood up to
19:05
steve jobs
19:08
so you didn't fully know about it i'm
19:10
sure but he uh i found this fact out by
19:13
the way in the movie steve jobs the
19:14
michael fassbender movie that came out
19:16
and
19:16
um if you've seen that movie you'll know
19:19
uh from the portrayal of him that he was
19:20
an incredibly difficult guy that he was
19:22
always yelling that he was always angry
19:24
that he had no time for employees that
19:26
weren't doing things right so the
19:28
idea was that sometime uh in the course
19:31
of his time at apple
19:32
occasionally a few people would step up
19:34
and say no
19:36
and if other people saw that they'd be
19:37
like oh my god and then they'd give
19:39
they'd hold an annual award and say you
19:42
stood up and you get this award
19:43
great yeah you're obviously fired so you
19:45
might as well take something away with
19:47
you
19:47
interestingly those people who stood up
19:49
to him most of them were promoted
19:51
uh because he actually loved the idea of
19:53
people standing up to him but then why
19:54
did not everyone just do it all the time
19:57
well i guess you needed a you needed to
19:58
be passionate about the thing that you
20:00
were talking about so his personal
20:01
secretary it was the person who won
20:03
one in 1981 and 1982. we don't know the
20:06
examples that want it for her but we do
20:08
have a few quotes of what she was like
20:09
with him and she used to say stuff like
20:11
i'm going to take a knife and stab it
20:13
into his heart wait wait
20:14
wait is that a poo knife
20:21
she also threatened to pour her coffee
20:22
into his lap if he didn't
20:24
uh back up so it's that kind of stuff
20:26
she was really forceful and
20:28
he uh and he would listen to her he she
20:30
was there for his whole career joanna
20:32
hoffman was her name
20:33
yeah there was a fact doing the rounds
20:34
about apple recently and about aircraft
20:36
carriers so i thought this is
20:38
a combo fact um which is the apples
20:41
the amount of cash apple has in the bank
20:43
uh if they wanted to spend that
20:45
they could buy 40 aircraft carriers
20:49
wow although they wouldn't have any
20:50
planes to put on them because they'd
20:51
spend all their money on
20:52
40 aircraft carriers but if they just
20:55
bought like
20:56
39 they could have a load of planes as
20:58
well yeah
20:59
that's what i would do
21:04
[Laughter]
21:06
james's wife kalina actually told us a
21:08
really cool fact which is that
21:09
um so like like you're saying aircraft
21:12
carries if you've spent it all that's
21:13
all you could afford
21:14
super yachts when people buy super
21:16
yachts it costs so much money when they
21:18
get it built that it ended up going way
21:20
further than what they thought they
21:21
could afford
21:22
and the thing with super yachts is that
21:23
there's a helipad at the top
21:25
it got to the point where people
21:26
couldn't afford helicopters so there's a
21:28
company that builds the shell of a
21:30
helicopter
21:31
that sits on super yachts to give the
21:33
impression that whoa
21:34
they've even got a helicopter yeah and
21:36
they're all fake they're just fake
21:38
helicopters
21:38
what if there's a fire on the yacht
21:41
someone says
21:42
don't worry he's got a helicopter i can
21:45
jump in the water
21:50
jump into the water you're not a
21:52
long-term thinker then that's your
21:53
brother
21:54
i would say though it is a better
21:55
solution than jumping into the fake
21:56
chemicals
21:59
he can't be that much of a i'm sure
22:01
it's a real one really
22:04
i would think about really good
22:06
employees like amazing employees so
22:08
sandy um this
22:12
is someone in 2013 in america who was
22:15
working at
22:15
dunkin donuts the donut shop um and
22:19
i think she wants maybe she didn't win
22:21
an award but she certainly deserved to
22:23
so she foiled a robbery by throwing a
22:26
pot of hot coffee at a robber who was
22:28
trying to climb in
22:29
through the cashier's window and then as
22:32
the robber fled she shouted the
22:33
company's slogan after him
22:36
what's the slogan the slogan is america
22:39
runs on duncan
22:40
and she shouted go run on duncan
22:44
um i have some things on employees who
22:46
were fired for things
22:47
oh yeah okay so jack hoover apparently
22:50
used to fire people because their heads
22:51
were too small
22:54
that's why they took to wearing enormous
22:55
hats
22:59
well it was kind of a status thing he
23:01
thought that people with bigger heads
23:02
were smarter and
23:03
he said he was a notoriously horrible
23:06
boss wasn't he jay
23:07
yes who was yeah so the first head of
23:10
the fbi
23:10
um and yeah there's a couple of stories
23:13
about him he
23:14
once found a poo on his patio and he
23:17
became convinced he was being stalked by
23:18
wild animals so the priority that day
23:20
was he got all of his
23:21
top dog fbi employees to get this poo
23:24
taken off to the lab and analyze it to
23:26
see what kind of creature it belonged to
23:27
they sent it to the smithsonian uh you
23:30
know the biological research
23:31
aspect of it and it identified it as
23:33
raccoon poo and so this word got back to
23:36
jayaka hoover and he built a trap to
23:37
destroy that raccoon and the next
23:39
morning
23:40
the neighbor's cat was spread all over
23:42
the wall of the house
23:43
according to his assistant what was this
23:45
trap
23:47
it was a catapult
23:50
the good thing is that they managed to
23:51
turn the poo into a wonderful set of six
23:53
teaspoons
23:54
to use so that's something there was
23:57
someone uh
23:58
there was a chap in india who he was an
24:00
electrical engineer and he
24:01
was fired his name is ak verma and he
24:04
was fired for not turning up for work
24:06
for
24:06
24 years oh yeah
24:09
it was some people i know it's just the
24:11
smallest little thing
24:13
this is the amazing thing about it okay
24:14
he was sacked in january 2015
24:16
right he had uh gone on leave in 1990
24:21
and in 1992 they said we'd better start
24:24
investigating where mr verma is
24:26
uh formal proceedings only started in
24:28
2007
24:31
and it took another seven years to fire
24:33
him
24:35
um there was someone in america it was
24:37
also in 2013 who was sacked after he
24:39
just outsourced his entire job to china
24:41
he was a software engineer oh wow and he
24:44
just paid them 20
24:45
of his big salary and um and let them
24:48
get on with it and just did nothing and
24:49
the sentence
24:50
on the report about it said the software
24:52
developer in his 40s
24:53
is thought to have spent his work days
24:55
watching cat videos on youtube and
24:56
browsing reddit
24:57
[Laughter]
24:59
so he was a qi researcher
25:03
um we should move on to our final fact
25:05
okay it is time for our final fact of
25:07
the show and that is james harkin
25:09
okay my fact this week is that there are
25:12
japanese rock bands
25:14
called abingdon boys school mass
25:17
of the fermenting dregs and siegel
25:20
screaming kiss her kiss her
25:24
very good names that's good i just found
25:26
the list of japanese
25:28
rock bands on wikipedia and they were my
25:29
three favorite ones
25:31
abingdon boys school they were
25:32
originally called abs and they were
25:34
named after an anti-lock breaking system
25:36
[Laughter]
25:38
and then they back formated their name
25:40
they looked on wikipedia
25:42
for other things with abs as the as the
25:44
initialism and they found that and it's
25:46
where radiohead were founded apparently
25:48
that's cool
25:50
um the seagull band are named after a
25:51
track by the 80s band
25:53
xtc oh yeah and the dregs band
25:56
um they asked them what that meant and
25:58
they said it doesn't have any particular
25:59
meaning
26:00
we just lined up a few words that we
26:01
liked
26:03
mass of the fermenting dregs and i think
26:05
that's probably also true of a couple of
26:07
other bands
26:08
macdonald duck eclair and school
26:11
food punishment i imagine they're just
26:14
like names that sound nice in japanese
26:16
and they decided to go for wait so are
26:17
these in japanese their names are they
26:19
ending no they're in english
26:20
yeah but they're kind of they're a
26:21
little bit transliterated so they're not
26:23
exactly
26:24
as we would say about pretty much the
26:25
same i speaking mcdonald's i saw a band
26:27
the other day that is both a mcdonald's
26:29
tribute act as well as a black sabbath
26:31
tribute act and they're called mack
26:32
sabbath
26:33
and they they come out dressed as
26:35
hamburglar and ronald mcdonald
26:37
and they uh yeah it's really fun there's
26:39
video footage online of them they're
26:41
really cool band
26:42
all the songs are just changed to be
26:43
mcdonald's themed it's really exciting
26:46
yeah what i just love about this fact
26:47
i've said this a few times actually i
26:49
just love going on the internet and
26:50
finding lists of stuff and then finding
26:52
bits and pieces
26:53
and the other day i found the most
26:54
recent name uh most recent list
26:57
of baby names in the uk these are from
26:59
2014
27:01
and there are 10 girls in that year
27:03
called pebbles
27:05
there were three boys whose name was
27:07
name
27:08
wow that's a mistake on the forum
27:12
um and there were 31 girls called
27:16
isis in 2014 wow 2014. that i mean yeah
27:20
they only really kicked off halfway
27:22
through 2014.
27:23
oh yeah you think that's what it was i
27:25
hope that's what it was yeah
27:27
and there um there were three girls
27:29
called bowie
27:30
and five boys called bowie so it's kind
27:32
of a mixed gender
27:34
oh that's really nice yeah my favorite
27:36
fact about david bowie's name
27:38
is that he was originally called david
27:40
jones
27:41
so that was that was his birth name and
27:43
he started becoming a musician and then
27:45
suddenly out of nowhere
27:46
davey jones of the monkeys suddenly
27:48
became massively famous so
27:50
he thought oh i can't i can't use that
27:52
name so he changed it to david bowie
27:54
however before he changed it to david
27:57
bowie
27:57
he named himself tom jones
28:01
and then a few weeks later this new
28:03
singer kicked off and he was like oh
28:05
jesus and so then he went to david bowie
28:07
so david bowie was called tom jones and
28:09
davey jones before he was
28:10
uh do you think there's another universe
28:12
where david
28:14
with tom jones our tom jones didn't
28:17
become famous
28:18
or did become famous under the name
28:20
david bowie and
28:22
our david bowie became famous under the
28:24
name tom jones
28:26
if it is it's a magical universe and i
28:28
wish we were all there right now
28:30
it's almost impossible to conceive
28:32
[Laughter]
28:34
all right i've got some japanese pop
28:35
music effects
28:37
great um well i've got a couple more
28:39
bands which i'm surprised didn't make
28:40
your list james so there's the sex
28:41
machine guns and my favorite is
28:45
the as in the shakespearean for you the
28:47
michelle gunn elephant
28:49
is brilliant do you know where they got
28:51
their name so they misheard
28:53
um a song by the damned which is machine
28:57
gun etiquette and they thought it was
29:00
michelle
29:00
gunn elephant ah that's very cool that's
29:03
good
29:03
very cool yeah so this thing you're
29:06
talking about where
29:07
in japan english words are taken and
29:09
they're sort of repurposed uh
29:11
there's something called uh guy rygo
29:14
that is the japanese rendering of
29:16
english words that have now fallen to
29:18
common parlance in japan
29:19
so for instance uh japanese words that
29:21
are used now are maiku
29:23
which is the microphone uh super which
29:26
is supermarket and i really like this
29:28
one
29:28
abeku is a word for a romantic couple
29:31
like a couple in a relationship and that
29:33
comes from the french avec
29:35
and that's just become a japanese word
29:37
that means a romantic couple
29:39
i thought you were going to say it was
29:40
from possum becks
29:42
no it's much more sophisticated than
29:43
that they're more highbrow than you are
29:45
well i wouldn't say the poshmarks are
29:46
not sophisticated
29:48
i think he's got a tattoo of of
29:50
victoria's name victoria beckham's name
29:53
in
29:53
sanskrit but it's misspelled yeah you're
29:55
right that is sophisticated
29:57
[Laughter]
29:59
so the biggest selling song in japanese
30:01
history not including
30:02
digital downloads so it's a bit of an
30:04
older one but this is genuinely the
30:06
best-selling song in japanese history
30:08
it's called
30:08
a yogey taiyaki kun which translates as
30:12
swim you see bream-shaped pancake
30:19
that's true it was apparently it was
30:22
used in a children's tv show
30:24
and then it became massively popular for
30:26
people to buy for their kids and yeah
30:28
there is a band called machikado keiki
30:30
japan whose name means
30:31
street corner economic conditions right
30:34
and their debut single they're quite a
30:36
recent band it mentions quantitative
30:37
easing and construction bonds
30:39
and wow the big gimmick of this band
30:41
they're a girl band and they promised
30:43
the the length of their skirts would
30:44
correlate with the country's stock
30:46
market conditions
30:47
so that when the nikkei the japanese
30:49
stock market was doing well their mini
30:50
skills would get shorter and when they
30:52
was doing badly they would you know go
30:54
down towards the ankles
30:55
that's actually a real thing isn't it
30:57
that then people do use the length of
30:59
people's skirts to say whether the
31:01
country's doing well or badly hemline
31:03
index that's yeah that's cool yeah and
31:04
in really good economic conditions we're
31:06
all women tend to wear shorter skirts
31:08
yeah which is strange because you you'd
31:10
think that in bad economic conditions
31:12
you'd be wearing short skirts because
31:13
you have to save cloth
31:14
yeah that's true yeah whereas in the
31:18
good times there's cloth going
31:22
because i was reading a lot of lists on
31:23
wikipedia like i do
31:25
for my job um i found one list which is
31:27
lists of nicknames used by george w
31:29
bush which was quite good okay so uh
31:32
tony blair he called him
31:34
landslide i think because he had such a
31:36
really good kind of election one year
31:38
i know you'd think that no no tony blair
31:41
delights in causing landslides
31:43
that's the funny thing they keep it out
31:45
of the papers
31:45
[Laughter]
31:47
um the director of the cia
31:49
counter-terrorist center ko for black
31:52
was known as flies on the eyeballs guy
31:55
by george w
31:56
bush and vladimir putin was known as
31:58
pooty poot ostrich
32:00
legs
32:00
[Laughter]
32:05
i can see that with putin though yeah
32:06
can you he's got he's good he's got sort
32:08
of big strong arms and stuff but you
32:09
know he never shows he never gets his
32:10
legs out
32:12
what's he hiding
32:18
okay that's it that's all of our facts
32:20
thank you so much for listening
32:21

00:00
[Music]
00:10
[Applause]
00:10
[Music]
00:12
hello
00:13
and welcome to another episode of no
00:16
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:18
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:20
covent garden
00:20
my name is dan shriver i'm sitting here
00:22
with james harkin
00:23
andy murray and anna chazinski and once
00:26
again we have gathered around the
00:27
microphones with our four
00:28
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:30
and in no particular order
00:32
here we go starting with you andy murray
00:36
my fact is that when you are 30 meters
00:38
under water your lungs are only a
00:40
quarter of their normal size
00:42
that is incredible yeah how
00:45
what's because there's no not enough air
00:47
in them well
00:48
there's the same number of uh molecules
00:51
if you just take one lung full and then
00:53
you dive down but the water pressure
00:55
on them is much higher meaning that
00:56
you're long string so if you're at sea
00:58
level all the air above you if you
01:00
imagine a column of air
01:01
uh stretching all the way up to the edge
01:03
of the atmosphere um
01:05
one square inch of that column would
01:07
weigh 14.7 pounds
01:09
right so we say the pressure the air
01:12
pressure at sea level is 14
01:13
pounds per square inch 14.7 it is
01:15
amazing actually to think
01:16
all of that air pushing down on you
01:18
whenever you're walking down the street
01:19
yeah wow
01:20
yeah yeah we're all super humanly strong
01:23
well we're all humanly strong oh yeah
01:25
yeah yeah
01:26
but in the sea to get another 14.7
01:29
pounds pressing down on you you only
01:31
have to go down uh 10 meters right
01:33
so at that depth um if you had a balloon
01:36
full of gas and you pulled it
01:37
10 meters under the water 33 feet it
01:39
would be half the size because there are
01:41
two atmospheres of pressure
01:42
wow so the same thing is happening to
01:43
your lungs when you go underwater and if
01:45
you go
01:45
three times that if you go 30 meters
01:47
down you would have to have four times
01:48
as many gas molecules in your lungs to
01:50
fill them to their original
01:52
size now it doesn't apply if you have uh
01:54
if you're breathing
01:55
pressurized air right so scuba divers
01:57
they breathe in air which is at a much
01:59
higher pressure
02:00
than normal air so you're breathing in a
02:03
higher number of
02:04
uh molecules four times as many gas
02:06
molecules at that
02:08
so their lungs are the same yeah so
02:09
you're talking about free diving when
02:11
you're talking about that yeah
02:12
yeah when you get to about 300 feet
02:15
under the surface of the water
02:16
uh there was a guy in 1996 um who
02:20
was called francisco ferras rodriguez
02:22
his chest
02:23
shrunk from a size 50 inches to 20.
02:27
what we're saying is if you need to get
02:28
fitted for a suit don't get fitted
02:30
436 feet under the water unless you're
02:33
planning to wear that suit
02:38
otherwise you're just gonna look baggy
02:39
as hell yeah um so
02:41
i was when you said this fact about the
02:43
lungs which is extraordinary the idea
02:45
that it can shrink down to
02:46
that size um i started reading into so
02:49
james nester i read this article by him
02:51
he wrote this book called free diving so
02:53
he talks a lot about this thing that
02:55
they've been studying for about 50 years
02:57
which is called the master switch of
02:59
life that's the term for it
03:01
and the idea is that when we go into the
03:03
water we slowly start turning into
03:05
water based animals the deeper we go as
03:07
in our body adapts to in the way stay on
03:09
the water for long enough you turn into
03:11
a fish yeah
03:11
basically right yeah yeah yeah so those
03:13
really fascinating things so when you
03:15
start diving down
03:16
um you have to paddle down because
03:18
gravity is trying to do a buoyancy thing
03:20
of sending you back up
03:21
so you have to go down as soon as you
03:23
get to 40 feet then the gravity shifts
03:25
and it starts pulling you down so free
03:26
divers then just put their hands by
03:28
their sides and they allow themselves to
03:30
be pulled down because you need to save
03:31
every single bit of oxygen that you have
03:33
inside your body
03:34
and your heart rate goes down to
03:35
something some people
03:37
like this is very rare but some people
03:39
seven beats a minute that's how much
03:40
your body just relaxes into a different
03:42
state
03:43
is it called the cold water reflex or
03:44
the
03:59
the reason it can snap you out of like a
04:01
panic attack or being anxious
04:02
is because actually it gives you the
04:04
dive reflex which immediately slows your
04:06
heart rate down
04:07
and it hugely slows it doesn't it so
04:09
there was an experiment where people had
04:11
to exercise to like synchronize swimming
04:13
on the bottom of a
04:14
deep pool or something and you know it
04:16
really doesn't increase
04:17
at all in the same way that it would
04:18
above water but i don't think we know
04:20
how it is that no they've been yeah
04:22
they've been they've been researching
04:23
someone wrote that free diving is the
04:25
only sport in which
04:26
the lungs shrink and the heart slows
04:28
down
04:29
every other sport there is yeah the
04:31
heart rate speeds up
04:33
oh talking of heart slowing down have we
04:34
ever mentioned the guy that got in touch
04:35
with us
04:36
no no we haven't no a guy emailed us
04:39
called
04:40
uh martin brady emailed the podcast
04:42
email address a few weeks ago
04:44
and he just sent me an email saying i
04:47
thought you might like to know that the
04:48
world record for the lowest resting
04:50
heartbeat
04:51
is 27 beats a minute it's held by
04:53
someone called martin brady
04:55
and the condition of having a low heart
04:57
rate is bradycardia
04:59
and the two are completely unrelated so
05:01
he's called martin brady
05:02
and the condition is bradycardia weird
05:05
coincidence really cool fact
05:06
and i looked at his email address and
05:08
replied and was like are you martin
05:10
brady he's like yes i am
05:12
so yeah the guy with the guinness world
05:13
record for the lowest heart
05:15
beat has been in touch and yeah
05:18
so that'll be the lowest resting
05:19
heartbeat right now is wrestling this
05:21
guy who goes on the water who can go
05:23
down to seven beats a minute is slightly
05:24
different yeah yes yeah yeah
05:26
have you guys heard of the aquaman
05:28
crystal
05:29
no this is new scientific uh because it
05:32
sounds like it's from the fantastic four
05:34
or something oh it's real this is real
05:36
so
05:36
um i don't fully understand it but
05:38
because uh these are and they're
05:40
in prototype stage at the moment they're
05:42
crystals that absorb
05:43
oxygen uh they allow uh the idea is that
05:46
they would allow you eventually if we
05:47
can work out how to use it i have heard
05:48
of these
05:49
have you okay so yeah so they they do
05:52
well they they take in the oxygen around
05:53
them so
05:54
in a room they can suck it they can
05:56
absorb all the oxygen into them
05:57
so if you were able to take it down into
05:59
the ocean you wouldn't need the tank
06:01
anymore
06:01
you'd be able just to breathe in through
06:03
these crystals but
06:04
if you're a super villain for instance
06:06
then you could get some of these
06:07
crystals put them in a room and it will
06:09
just suck all the oxygen out
06:10
and then you'd kill everyone in the room
06:12
wow that is a dan brown novel waiting to
06:15
be written
06:15
i think i know people who have been
06:17
using these for years because whenever
06:19
you're talking to them it really feels
06:20
like all the air's been sucked out of
06:21
the truth
06:22
why are you looking at me now
06:25
can i ask a question about lungs yeah
06:27
ask me i'll know
06:29
okay i think you will know there have
06:31
been a couple of news reports over the
06:33
last few years
06:34
about people having plants grow in their
06:36
lungs
06:38
so there was a guy who inhaled a fir
06:40
tree seed and a
06:42
tree started to grow in his lungs and
06:45
there was someone else who
06:48
inhaled a pea seed and i think a pea
06:50
plant started to grow on his lungs
06:52
now a study was done which said or a
06:55
report was released which said
06:56
it is not possible for any plant to grow
06:59
inside someone's lungs it needs light
07:01
etc
07:02
but nothing has explained to me how
07:03
these people i've seen
07:05
x-rays of their lungs i don't agree with
07:07
the second thing that you said because
07:09
if you have plants
07:10
in the ground they don't have the light
07:13
yeah
07:13
so just for them to germinate they
07:15
wouldn't need the light yeah
07:16
and i assume that's what's happened i
07:18
think the like fur tree
07:20
inside his lungs it's not like a massive
07:22
christmas tree it's just like a
07:23
germination of
07:24
although he did they did say the pain
07:26
was caused by the little fur tree
07:27
needles
07:28
poking into his cabinetry and the
07:30
barbells
07:32
the angel on top really caused a choking
07:34
hazard
07:35
imagine if one day he just found a bit
07:37
of tinsel at the corner of his mouth
07:39
and started pulling on it rather it come
07:42
out of your mouth i think
07:45
um also in underwater news uh there's
07:49
someone called jim dyke jr who's testing
07:51
out a new theory that you can actually
07:53
age wine much better by dropping it
07:55
uh to the bottom of or it's certainly
07:58
quite deep into an ocean
07:59
it's like it takes so long to retrieve
08:00
that it's quite a lot older
08:04
well so uh he was inspired by there was
08:06
quite a few stories of shipwrecks coming
08:08
up with all sorts of alcohol champagne
08:09
being one of them
08:11
and they all tasted really good and he
08:12
has a theory that the aging process
08:14
through being underwater will actually
08:16
be much more efficient and much better
08:18
so
08:18
it's an ongoing new theory that might be
08:20
unbelievably inconvenient when majestic
08:22
wine is stationed on the bottom
08:27
i was actually just passing by to get my
08:28
suit fitted but i suppose i'll get some
08:31
wine while i'm here
08:33
um one other lung thing do you guys
08:35
remember the story
08:36
of um a doctor called angus wallace
08:40
in the 1990s who was on an airplane
08:44
and did an amazing thing there are my
08:46
clues oh um yeah yeah
08:50
a coat hanger yeah spirals don't work do
08:53
they
08:53
no there was a study they work for
08:55
writing before the bio industry gets
08:56
onto us
08:58
they were never designed for
09:00
tracheotomies i think it would be their
09:01
defense i'm trying to bring down the
09:03
viral industry
09:06
you're tagging them in the wrong place
09:07
yeah but just on that there was a study
09:09
done about
09:10
um byros for tracheotomies and um they
09:12
reckon that they're just kind of the
09:14
wrong shape and they just wouldn't quite
09:16
work
09:16
oh really it wasn't actually quite a
09:18
tracheotomy i don't think on the plane
09:20
but it is the most incredible
09:22
story so this is the one of the surgeons
09:24
angus wallace treated wayne rooney uh
09:26
at the world cup 2006 and 10 years
09:28
earlier he'd been on a flight and a girl
09:30
complained of chest pain
09:32
um and said she'd fallen off her bike
09:34
and it turned out she'd been in a big
09:35
motorbike
09:36
accident and he realized that she had a
09:38
collapsed lung
09:39
and so they had to get a catheter up
09:41
into her lung to stop it from completely
09:43
caving inwards
09:44
and the way the only catheter they had
09:46
in the medical equipment was
09:48
too floppy because it was for a
09:49
different part of the body um and so he
09:50
got a coat hanger into the
09:52
catheter to stiffen it up um and then he
09:54
fashioned a one-way valve by prodding
09:56
holes into the lid of an evian bottle
09:59
um and he used a bit of an oxygen mask
10:01
tubing i think to thread it up there
10:04
and this this was one of the blue peter
10:06
presenters
10:08
was this a macgyver episode post curfew
10:11
so
10:12
non-blue peter he had to sterilize all
10:13
the equipment with first class cognac
10:15
even though it turned out they did have
10:16
alcohol wipes in the first aid kit
10:19
he said afterwards he didn't have time
10:20
to check um and then he
10:22
his associate held her chest open with a
10:24
knife and four
10:25
well he inserted the catheter oh my god
10:28
the plastic knives and forks i think one
10:29
of the plastics yeah
10:30
or this was the 90s so maybe there was
10:32
still a loud metal right yeah i think
10:34
this explains why wayne rooney's always
10:35
injured because he's held together with
10:37
sticky back plastic
10:38
[Laughter]
10:39
held together with yeah suppose it's a
10:41
coat hanger and did she make a recovery
10:43
he said she it took about 10 minutes and
10:46
then she passed the rest of the flight
10:47
uneventfully eating and watching
10:48
in-flight entertainment
10:51
what but the person next to her had
10:53
nowhere to hang his coat
10:55
[Applause]
10:57
[Music]
10:58
[Applause]
10:59
okay it is time for fact number two and
11:02
that
11:02
is jazinski my fact this week is that
11:05
online shopping was predicted in 1857
11:08
yeah amazing yeah yeah so this is quite
11:11
a prediction so
11:12
how close is it to modern day online
11:14
shopping or is it just like
11:16
you know they predicted shopping yeah
11:20
i've added online to make it sound
11:21
better um
11:23
it's well i think it's quite close so
11:25
this is an an essay that was written in
11:26
a magazine called the leisure hour in
11:28
1857
11:29
and i read it on a website called
11:31
publicdomainreview.org which is my
11:33
favorite place on the whole internet
11:34
it's incredible
11:35
everyone go to it um but yeah the
11:38
thing this guy predicted was that in
11:40
every district uh
11:42
shops would have electric wires that
11:44
branched off in all directions away from
11:46
them that would be attached to all the
11:47
houses in the area
11:49
and when uh well he says no sooner did a
11:51
housekeeper stand in need of any article
11:54
she could dispatch the order instantly
11:55
along the wire so just press a little
11:57
button along the wire
11:58
and the shop would receive that message
12:00
and receive the news of what she wanted
12:02
and then the very first rail railway
12:03
carriage that was passing would be able
12:05
to drop off the item on its way
12:07
it's amazing i mean that is yeah i read
12:10
the essay and there are a lot of other
12:11
predictions in it as well so he predicts
12:13
that the river thames will be completely
12:14
clear and full of fish
12:16
yeah not quite but i bet it's a lot more
12:19
full of fish than it was in those days
12:22
true he also predicts that there would
12:24
be 20 new bridges across the thames
12:26
between 1857 and 1957. and how many i
12:28
counted and there were 26.
12:30
not bad yeah pretty close
12:33
yeah yeah no one will be wearing hats or
12:35
bonnets anymore in 1957. that one wasn't
12:38
quite on because the hats were still
12:39
pretty big then well though he said that
12:40
they'd just be reply
12:41
i got excited by that because i thought
12:43
well done you finally seen the idiocy of
12:45
the fact that everyone wore a hat until
12:47
about 1950
12:48
but then he said they'll just be
12:49
replaced by a slightly easier head
12:51
garment a less showy head garment
12:53
why don't why didn't people realize you
12:55
don't need to wear a head garment at all
12:57
well if you want to keep your head warm
12:59
if they're not necessary now they won't
13:01
then james
13:02
take your hat off inside anyway well you
13:04
and i've got on very well in stockpot in
13:06
the um early 20th century where anyone
13:08
walking around without a hat would get
13:10
stones thrown at them
13:11
really because it was a big hatting area
13:14
this happened i think in luton as well
13:15
these were two big hatting areas and it
13:18
was just seemed to be your
13:19
local duty to always wear a hat and if
13:21
you didn't people would just abuse you
13:23
really yeah i actually don't think i
13:24
would have gone down very well in
13:25
stockport in the early 20th century
13:26
anyway
13:28
isn't losing now uh got a big volkswagen
13:31
factory
13:33
it's got an airport so anyone walking
13:34
around not in a plane these days
13:37
uh it's terrible
13:41
um i was looking into predictions from
13:43
around roughly the same period
13:45
i found a nice one that um was from 1900
13:49
and it was a sort of 100 year prediction
13:50
as well and i think it's actually quite
13:52
a famous one
13:52
this is this is went around the internet
13:54
quite a lot uh john alfred
13:56
watkins so there are a few interesting
14:00
predictions there one my favorite one uh
14:02
he thought that americans would be
14:04
taller by one to two inches
14:05
that's quite exciting which is probably
14:07
probably true ish
14:08
more than that yeah right but my
14:11
favorite one is the one that he got
14:12
wrong
14:13
which is he thought in a hundred years
14:15
time there would be no more c
14:16
x or q in the everyday alphabet you just
14:20
thought that would go that we didn't
14:21
need them
14:21
sensible we don't well we do what do we
14:24
need to see for that you can't use a k
14:25
or an s
14:26
nothing oh i see right we need an export
14:29
that you can't use
14:30
a k and an s for okay but the word
14:32
quixotic would really suffer
14:36
yeah you're right that's gonna have to
14:38
go i'm afraid
14:39
um he also predicted ready cooked meals
14:42
but he then thought they'd be delivered
14:44
through pneumatic tubes from the shops
14:46
to people's homes
14:47
who's to say that we won't have that in
14:49
the future well fingers crossed
14:52
um i saw an article in the summit county
14:54
journal from 1909 that got posted on
14:56
qi.com by a guy called
14:58
mort and i'll just read a little bit out
15:00
to you if it's okay
15:02
a hundred years from now if you want to
15:03
avoid the russian do your christmas
15:05
shopping in your own apartments
15:07
the scientists will probably have
15:08
provided for you a telescope
15:12
and the idea is that you'll be able to
15:14
see the thai department
15:15
from your house so you look through the
15:18
telescope and then using a telephone
15:20
you'll be able to get in touch with the
15:21
clerk and tell them what you want from
15:23
them
15:24
not that no the one behind it
15:27
does everyone have to live directly
15:28
opposite the toy shop well he almost
15:30
predicted last year's john lewis advert
15:36
so just on predictions um have you heard
15:39
of effie smith
15:41
no he was an amazing guy he was the
15:43
first earl of birkenhead he was alive in
15:45
the
15:46
late 19th early 20th century he was
15:48
winston churchill's best friend
15:50
right he had an enormous brain and in
15:52
1930 he made another 100 years from now
15:55
prediction so this is 20 30 he's talking
15:57
about okay
15:58
so he's got time for some of these to
16:00
come but i think a lot of them may not
16:02
um so some of them he gets absolutely
16:05
right um
16:06
but he says that plane ownership will be
16:08
common like lots of people will just
16:09
have their own plane it'll be very very
16:11
normal yeah
16:11
um that one no also he says
16:15
that um people will be living into the
16:17
120s
16:18
and that'll be a massive problem for
16:20
people because how will youths of 20 be
16:22
able to compete in the professions or
16:24
business against
16:25
vigorous men still in their prime at 120
16:28
with a century of experience on which to
16:30
draw that's a really good point but just
16:32
going back to the
16:33
airplanes thing um a lot of people think
16:35
we'll have flying cars by then
16:37
right fair play yes well he also
16:40
predicts that
16:41
everyone will be so wealthy and affluent
16:42
that we will all be able to go fox
16:44
hunting all the time
16:45
[Laughter]
16:47
again don't you i do it in my plane sure
16:51
um and this is the thing he was really
16:53
really far ahead of his time he
16:54
he saw early tv and he wanted tv to
16:57
allow us to vote
16:58
in the same way that the ancient greeks
17:00
would vote and you'd have a referendum
17:01
over the course of an
17:02
evening basically electronically so you
17:05
predicted um
17:06
what are all those programs of simon
17:07
cowell yeah predicted x factor thank you
17:10
yeah um he also predicted that uh which
17:13
should have come true but hasn't
17:15
that um men would only have two outfits
17:18
by 2030 which would save a lot of time
17:20
because you'd have your casual outfit
17:21
and then your non-casual outfit you have
17:23
your one for
17:24
normal sea level and then one for 400
17:26
meters below
17:28
something else that a guy called jules
17:30
boi predicted in 1909
17:32
was a flying bicycle did he call it a
17:34
flight cycle he wasn't smart enough for
17:36
that
17:37
i mean the guy was a [ __ ] he predicted
17:39
the flying bicycle or the film e.t
17:42
oh yeah yeah so you can you can relate
17:44
it to every
17:45
yeah basically i can predict anything i
17:48
like and in a hundred years i'll just
17:49
say oh yeah it was that it was yeah
17:51
that's what i meant yeah you almost
17:52
understood
17:54
communicating with each other's brains
17:56
is something that i think most
17:57
futurologists say
17:59
is the most likely thing to happen i was
18:01
reading an article where two
18:02
futurologists said that's 100
18:03
chance within a hundred years or i think
18:05
they said by 2050.
18:06
um so that'll be how we won't have to
18:08
have this podcast at all out loud
18:10
there'll be no use for our mouths
18:11
no use right now no
18:17
people will use their mouths to keep
18:19
loose change and other small items
18:22
would you transfer the visuals or would
18:24
it just be the words
18:25
let's say you're picturing your house
18:26
you're like oh are you still am i just
18:28
hearing
18:29
you say i used to live in this house or
18:30
can i see great question i didn't
18:32
ask a futurologist it will start off
18:35
just maybe being words and then it will
18:37
move on to
18:38
images and then it will move on to 3d
18:40
images you can read a word
18:42
that's in someone's brain if i'm
18:44
thinking the word octopus
18:47
that's amazing octopus now great movie
18:49
[Laughter]
18:52
imagine the dystopia that we'll live in
18:54
though if everything you think
18:56
everyone will automatically hear that is
18:58
i'm going to kill myself
18:59
imagine if we all knew what each other
19:01
was thinking right now wow
19:02
it's not a world i want to live in no i
19:05
don't even like hearing the stuff you
19:06
guys say
19:08
yeah you definitely don't want to be the
19:10
one but you know what we think
19:13
[Applause]
19:14
[Music]
19:15
[Applause]
19:15
[Music]
19:17
okay it is time for our next fact and
19:19
that is harken
19:21
okay my fact this week is that the word
19:23
pants
19:24
comes from the greek word for all
19:27
compassionate
19:29
this is great my pants are very
19:31
thoughtful
19:33
in the future we'll live in a world
19:35
where everyone
19:37
just is you nice messages send them
19:39
upwards
19:40
this is um a bit of an etymological
19:43
merry-go-round
19:44
um so the word pants comes from the word
19:46
pantaloon
19:47
which came from a character in the
19:50
italian comedia del arte called
19:52
pantalone
19:53
and he had extremely tight trousers
19:55
which is where the word pants became to
19:57
mean trousers
19:58
uh and pantalone's name comes from the
20:01
greek word meaning
20:02
all compassionate there you go like pan
20:05
as in
20:05
everything right yes exactly yeah and
20:08
pantaloney or pantaleon was
20:11
a saint wasn't he um i think as well and
20:14
that's why he was called that
20:15
in the comedia dellate he was the patron
20:18
saint of
20:19
hunts venice he was a patron saint of
20:22
venice so i think around the 16th
20:24
century venetians were referred to as
20:25
pan
20:26
pantaloons or pantaleons wow
20:29
so a pair of pantaloons in those days
20:31
just meant two guys from venice yeah
20:33
exactly wow
20:34
a pair of pants my italian mates that's
20:36
cool so the merchant from venice would
20:38
just be a pant
20:40
yeah yeah the merchant of pants
20:43
it's a whole different story so what is
20:45
the comedia del arte
20:47
theater thing that this comes from so
20:49
this is like a renaissance type of art
20:51
um it was an old play and a lot of the
20:53
modern day
20:54
um kind of art comes from there so um
20:56
clowns come from there
20:58
the harlequin was one of the characters
20:59
and the modern day clown comes from that
21:01
uh punch from punching judy probably
21:03
comes from there as well
21:05
uh and um of queen fame
21:09
he's a character from comedia isn't he
21:11
that's right
21:12
um so andy you wouldn't exist without it
21:15
in your
21:16
current guys which might be a relief for
21:18
many parents met at a comedian
21:20
reunion no what do you mean um it was
21:23
originally called the uh comedia
21:25
del improviso because it was turning
21:27
improvisation into an art
21:29
and so uh people who are professional
21:31
actors would do comedia de la te would
21:33
do this improvised thing so they'd be
21:35
these characters like scaramouche
21:37
um or like panteleone but they would
21:40
make up
21:40
uh according to their character in each
21:42
different performance what was happening
21:44
so you could promise that every
21:45
performance would be different but
21:47
equally tedious
21:50
that is just modern improv
21:52
[Laughter]
21:55
should we just say that andy is in a
21:57
very successful improv troupe called
21:58
ostentatious which you should definitely
22:00
check out
22:01
they are extremely funny yeah on the
22:03
other side
22:04
six out of the seven members are winners
22:07
yeah
22:08
yeah but yeah it was what professional
22:10
actors would do so amateur actors would
22:12
be given
22:12
uh plays that they would just memorize
22:14
and then they'd recite them but proper
22:16
professional actors would be the ones
22:17
who were allowed to do this in
22:19
special improvisation to live in a world
22:20
where improvisers got the kudos of
22:22
actors
22:23
it is totally unbelievable so i think
22:26
that trousers
22:27
uh or pants were invented because
22:31
king george iv was so fat really do you
22:34
reckon
22:35
wait underpants or trousers oh no so
22:37
this has been a matter of contention in
22:39
this office hasn't it
22:40
uh so i'm talking about pants which
22:43
are trousers to us so you're talking
22:46
about
22:47
how people used to wear britches rather
22:49
than trousers is that right yes so
22:50
people were breeches or britches
22:52
and then trousers started being warned
22:54
around the turn of the 19th century
22:56
and this is at the time when george iv
22:58
was about to take the throne and he was
22:59
massively fat so his uh his favorite
23:02
breakfast apparently was two roast
23:04
pigeons three beef steaks a bottle of
23:06
white wine
23:06
a glass of champagne two glasses of pork
23:08
and a glass of brandy that was just
23:10
breakfast he was fat and drunk
23:11
yeah that was breakfast favorite
23:12
breakfast you don't have your favorite
23:14
every day you might have that a few
23:15
times a week
23:16
it's like you don't have crunchy nut
23:18
cornflakes everywhere exactly
23:21
when he was treating himself so he was
23:23
gigantic and
23:24
he found that this new uh uh trousers
23:27
that people were wearing or pantaloons
23:29
people were wearing were a bit more
23:30
stretchy had a little bit more give for
23:32
the
23:32
28 stone man and so he started wearing
23:34
them and then it sort of took off from
23:35
there
23:36
is it true is it true that duke of
23:38
wellington was once um banned from a
23:40
club for wearing trousers like he went
23:42
tried to go in there
23:42
somewhere in london and they wouldn't
23:44
let him in because he was wearing
23:44
trousers remember that story yeah
23:47
yeah were you not allowed because
23:50
rather than trousers and they were just
23:51
seen as like this it's like wearing a
23:53
shell suit
23:54
yeah well the ancient romans said that
23:56
trousers was the mark of a barbarian
23:58
people
23:59
did they yeah because trousers go way
24:01
back sort of proto trousers if you like
24:03
your trousers
24:04
[Laughter]
24:07
so they was um definitely bc and
24:10
it's really interesting they basically
24:12
uh were developed in societies which did
24:14
a lot of horse riding
24:15
because it's much easier to ride a horse
24:18
wearing trousers than it is wearing a
24:19
robe
24:20
yes yeah um i was reading about um a
24:23
bunch of different
24:24
interesting underpants uh that are out
24:27
there on the market at the moment
24:28
uh this one's not actually on the market
24:30
i don't think quite just yet but it
24:32
should be these are wedgie proof
24:34
underpants so these are these are four
24:36
school children
24:37
designed by school children the two boys
24:39
who used to get wedgied a lot so they
24:41
invented the rip away 1000.
24:43
and it was a velcro pair of boxers
24:46
so you would so they just come off if
24:48
somebody's going to give you i mean that
24:50
is
24:50
in a way less good than just having
24:53
because at least with a wedgie you know
24:54
you still got your pants
24:55
and you know more than you ever knew
24:57
before
24:59
yeah that's true that's true so yeah but
25:01
kudos for them
25:02
developing something new yeah yeah well
25:05
done for being a bit imaginative kids
25:06
yeah
25:07
streakers have velcro trousers don't
25:08
they do that yeah
25:10
all three because strippers do yeah but
25:12
streakers as well at sporting events
25:14
because they probably get them from the
25:15
same place
25:16
maybe you have to get i think a lot of
25:17
them develop their own because you have
25:18
to get out of your clothes really
25:20
quickly you can't hang around
25:21
if you're a streaker undoing your
25:23
buttons and stuff you have to go for it
25:25
you have to get them all off in a few
25:26
seconds and then you're away i agree
25:28
with you anna that they probably get
25:29
them from the same place because it'd be
25:30
a bit weird to have a shop which sold
25:32
this kind of thing but you only sold it
25:34
to either streakers
25:35
or strippers no streakers
25:40
yeah i was looking also into the most
25:44
expensive
25:45
uh underwear so uh why fronts
25:48
um they actually they're really
25:50
interesting sort of um golden ones that
25:52
you can buy
25:53
um so then i thought okay so that's
25:54
that's why front um i'm going to look
25:56
into boxers and see what the most
25:57
expensive are
25:58
and um i read the wrong list the most uh
26:01
expensive boxer is floyd mayweather
26:02
jr but that's interesting to know as
26:06
well
26:07
um there was a pair that was sold uh
26:09
these are historical pants
26:11
so they're a bit different but uh there
26:12
was a pair sold quite recently for ten
26:14
thousand five hundred pounds
26:16
uh any guesses napoleons not right
26:19
earrings
26:20
victorious queen victoria's and they
26:23
dated they
26:24
dated the rough age of the pants by the
26:26
waistline
26:27
because they have good photographic
26:28
evidence of when queen victoria was what
26:30
size
26:31
these are 45 inches at the waist so they
26:33
know roughly what year it's from that is
26:35
so rough isn't it i mean she because she
26:38
was very big for about 20 years she
26:39
could have been 400 meters underwater
26:42
[Laughter]
26:45
she was her girth was bigger than her
26:47
height wasn't it by the end of her life
26:48
that's true and i think those pants
26:50
reflected that yeah
26:52
um but they um the the the report on
26:55
them said that they were sold to an
26:56
english woman who was a private
26:58
collector and did not want to be
26:59
identified
27:00
but she assumed the pants would remain
27:02
in england
27:03
it's good sometimes you have to buy a
27:04
piece of art for the nation don't you
27:06
yeah
27:07
you really do we're all very grateful to
27:09
that person
27:10
um i read a very good story in 14 times
27:13
the latest edition of 14 times
27:14
the headline being squatting in skinny
27:16
jeans is dangerous
27:18
so if you squat in skinny jeans it can
27:20
actually cut off
27:22
all of your um circulation of blood
27:24
right yeah
27:24
[Laughter]
27:27
so a lady doctors issued a warning after
27:30
a 35 year old woman was found lying in
27:32
an adelaide street in australia
27:34
unable to stand after spending hours
27:36
emptying cupboards and lifting boxes
27:38
her calves were so swollen they had to
27:40
cut her out of her
27:41
skinny jeans because that's how crazy so
27:43
yeah it sounds like she had the wrong
27:45
idea of her own size
27:47
i think she might have been one of those
27:48
people who's buying a couple of sizes
27:49
too small you do with skinny jeans
27:50
because they often stretch
27:51
you can get those jeggings do you what
27:53
you buy jeans that are too small for you
27:55
yeah slightly i did wonder why you look
27:58
like that every morning
28:00
while we're in australia yeah i read an
28:02
article about the most popular terms
28:04
for underwear in australia oh yeah but i
28:07
thought do you want to have a quick game
28:08
let's see if this works you want to have
28:10
a quick game of australian words for
28:12
underwear or australian words for
28:14
animals
28:14
okay amazing okay okay i'll read it out
28:16
and you have to say whether it's an
28:18
underwear or an animal bobblies animal
28:21
animal underwear underwear
28:25
um animal
28:28
underwear animal oh anna you are so good
28:30
at this game underwear
28:31
yeah smashing it uh braggers
28:35
animals i'm just waiting to see what
28:36
anna says animals underwear
28:39
it's an animal it's a type of crane
28:41
three out of three
28:42
and yabbies underwear animal animal
28:46
yeah dan you knew that i knew that one
28:47
yeah it's a type of inland crayfish yes
28:50
yes
28:55
can we put a theme tune in that
28:56
afterwards definitely
28:59
you used to be able to get paper pants
29:01
in news agents
29:03
did you yeah with the news on it no
29:06
sorry i just mean normal paper i don't
29:09
mean newspaper
29:10
was it for if you'd lost your pants or
29:12
if you'd wet your pants i think so
29:14
okay because you know when you arrive at
29:15
an airport on a holiday
29:17
and your suitcase doesn't turn up then
29:19
you get given paper pants by the airport
29:21
i've had that i lived in paper pants for
29:22
about five days
29:23
really really yeah on my gap yeah wow
29:26
five days
29:27
was it the same pair i think they gave
29:30
me two or three i don't think they gave
29:31
me enough for the number of days i had
29:32
to wear them wow
29:33
if you've had to get paper pants because
29:34
you've wet your initial pants
29:37
paper's not the best material for
29:38
someone who has a track record
29:42
um i think you would go commando in that
29:45
situation and the word go commando comes
29:47
from
29:47
commandos in the army don't wear pants
29:49
no it's not that it's just always being
29:51
ready
29:53
and it's like i think it's a sexual
29:54
thing like you're always ready because
29:56
you're not wearing pants
29:57
so the commandos are always ready so the
29:59
commander is always ready right and if
30:00
you don't wear pants you're always ready
30:02
for
30:03
sexual action it's not necessarily true
30:06
is it not no and i can attest to that
30:10
like the use of sexual action
30:14
um most women didn't wear pants until
30:16
the 19th century did they
30:18
they not they went commando for many
30:20
hundreds of years no for a reason or
30:22
just well why would we wear pants they
30:24
wanted to be always ready for sexual
30:26
action apparently
30:28
it was actually pants were frowned upon
30:29
really in women before that
30:31
and were very rare and were thought to
30:32
be mainly for sort of courtesans and
30:34
and such like and i think bras were worn
30:37
before pants mostly or bras were
30:39
popularly worn before pants wow i found
30:42
out a fact about
30:43
cod pieces which is that they used to be
30:46
used as pockets
30:48
yes there is a paper online which
30:51
examines the evidence for and against it
30:53
but it's not publicly available so i
30:54
haven't been able to get hold of it yet
30:56
but some people say
30:57
it probably didn't happen and other
30:58
people say yes definitely people kept
31:00
coins and
31:01
uh other little odds and ends i've been
31:03
told that from
31:04
um one of the armory's experts at the
31:07
tower of london told me that that's a
31:09
pretty good source yeah
31:10
but a cold piece goes over everything
31:11
else right yes that's on the outside
31:13
that makes a lot of sense yeah that's a
31:14
pouch that's the pre pouch but you'd be
31:16
a bit worried if you saw if someone next
31:18
to you at the theater you saw them
31:19
rummaging around
31:20
down there and they said oh no it's just
31:22
my coffee so i'm just getting out some
31:23
money for an ice cream or something yeah
31:25
it's like a sporang there isn't it
31:26
people run around and there's burns all
31:28
the time but it's not always
31:29
but sporangs aren't shaped like penises
31:30
that's the other thing i think that's a
31:32
good point
31:33
pieces i thought they look a bit like
31:34
surgical masks more than anything
31:37
what are they sort of just like so
31:39
that's also what penises look like
31:42
yeah they're green and they're made of
31:43
cloth and surgeons wear
31:48
you're saying it's shaped like i'm
31:50
saying that you can get cold pieces
31:51
which are little
31:52
sort of like they look like lumps
31:55
basically they're like
31:56
my friends exactly they look yeah they
31:57
look like a sars mask like it's just
31:59
like i've just
32:01
when you had your appendix out did you
32:02
say to the surgeon can you take that
32:04
copies off your face i can't concentrate
32:08
yeah it's really money in there i want
32:09
an ice cream
32:14
okay time for a final fact of the show
32:16
and that is my fact my fact this week is
32:18
that all new emojis are approved by one
32:21
63 year old man that's so good
32:24
yeah so i this is a world of the
32:27
internet
32:28
that i didn't know existed i've never
32:29
thought where do emojis come from i had
32:31
no idea it turns out that there's a big
32:33
council that get together
32:34
and they approve on what the new emojis
32:36
are going to be that we have
32:38
out in the world and the reason for that
32:39
is obviously something i hadn't thought
32:41
of as well
32:42
that you need to have codes that are
32:44
working on
32:45
any kind of gadget be it facebook to an
32:47
iphone to a galaxy samsung whatever
32:49
your phone is they all need to have the
32:51
same code so
32:53
basically it's this big group that get
32:54
together they're all volunteers from big
32:56
companies like google and facebook and
32:58
so on
32:59
and they all vote on what they think
33:00
should be a new uh emoji
33:02
so it's headed up by one guy who is the
33:04
co-founder and he's he is the president
33:06
called mark davis
33:07
and his daughter and many people online
33:10
call him the shadowy
33:11
emoji overlord she uh she made him a
33:14
shirt so that he wears that around
33:16
whenever he does conferences but
33:18
he effectively has high command on the
33:20
approval of these emojis my liege we
33:22
must have a flaming poo
33:23
[Laughter]
33:25
it's amazing um so unicode is not
33:28
in and of itself a very sexy thing it's
33:30
just sort of ensuring that computers can
33:32
talk to each other and that characters
33:34
mean the same thing in different code
33:36
and it's only really become this really
33:37
fun
33:38
crazy thing since the rise of the emoji
33:40
is very peculiar but they've been going
33:42
since the
33:42
since well before emojis yeah i think
33:44
did you say that it's called
33:45
the unicode consortium no i hadn't yeah
33:48
and they
33:48
and they release about 7000 characters a
33:51
year but only about
33:52
70 of those are emojis the rest is for
33:55
language it's how how do you get chinese
33:57
and how do you get any
33:58
arabic you know like all the languages
34:00
so that's what they focus on so there's
34:01
17 new emojis every year
34:03
roughly yeah yeah yeah so currently
34:05
there's
34:06
via these guys there are 1 624
34:09
and this is from an article that
34:10
appeared a few months ago so there will
34:13
be
34:13
new ones approved right and some people
34:15
come in with really high hopes i was
34:17
reading an article which kind of most of
34:19
my research has come from actually
34:20
uh leath berdugo wrote this article
34:23
called two days with the shadowy
34:24
emoji overlords and uh she said that
34:28
there would be people coming with ideas
34:30
and hoping to get
34:31
these ten new food-based emojis approved
34:34
by them and it wasn't looking so good
34:36
and would it happen
34:38
do you know have you read the list of uh
34:40
the emojis that are up for approval at
34:41
the moment
34:42
no i wanna hear them they're actually
34:44
not as exciting and hilarious as i hoped
34:46
but uh so a few that were approved last
34:47
year were
34:48
the cheese wedge the middle finger a
34:50
mosque a synagogue and a clown face
34:52
which i think was quite a nice
34:53
reflection of uh a global society yeah
34:56
and we want some that are up for
34:58
approval which will come into force
35:00
next year if approved includes
35:03
avocado a scooter a canoe the modern
35:07
pentathlon
35:08
whoa how does that work it's a lot of
35:10
very intricate little characters
35:11
a shallow pan of food a rhino mrs claus
35:14
and a selfie
35:15
i don't think we need an emoji for mrs
35:17
claus do we oh
35:18
everyday sexism oh i'm guilty of it
35:23
yeah apparently they've become quite
35:24
political though which
35:26
makes sense so there's there was
35:27
controversy about the omission of tacos
35:30
and burritos from emojis because
35:32
they come from japan originally so they
35:34
were quite heavy on
35:35
uh sorry emojis rather than tacos
35:38
sorry burritos are not from japan
35:41
emojis came from japan originally so
35:43
they were quite heavy on japanese food
35:45
and then obviously they involve lots of
35:46
western foods now
35:47
and then it was realized that there
35:49
weren't very many mexican foods involved
35:50
so now there are tacos and burritos but
35:52
someone pointed out that there are
35:54
hardly any african foods so you haven't
35:55
got an injera emoji
35:57
or a goat curry emoji which is what
35:59
they're all very worried about in
36:00
zimbabwe at the moment
36:02
so here's the thing anyone can be a part
36:04
of this group
36:05
and vote on the new emojis great anyone
36:07
can sign up well
36:08
you can sign up uh there's you just
36:10
you've got to just apply
36:12
uh the one full thing is that you need
36:13
to become a member properly to do it for
36:15
the vote itself
36:16
and that's and that's eighteen thousand
36:19
dollars america
36:20
very sad face but so as a result it is
36:25
the big companies apple
36:26
facebook ibm yeah but and then also odd
36:29
ones like the ministry of endowment and
36:31
religious affairs of the sultanate of
36:32
oman
36:33
they're also a part of deciding on
36:35
emojis that's nice yeah
36:36
good and the rules are you're not
36:38
allowed to have anyone who's alive
36:40
like justin bieber yes but if someone
36:42
like kim kardashian has invented her own
36:44
range of emojis which she has and lots
36:46
of yes
36:47
celebrities are inventing their own
36:48
ranges are those not official
36:50
they're not through this they're not
36:51
through this group i see yeah that's
36:53
just something that
36:54
and they're not going to be working on
36:55
every platform i'm guessing sure because
36:56
there is a very exciting there's a range
36:58
of kim jong-un
36:59
uh emojis which you can see really it
37:02
was released in response to the
37:03
kardashian ones pointing out this is not
37:05
the only famous kim on the planet
37:07
there's another kim who's just as cheeky
37:09
and just as determined to break the
37:10
internet
37:12
although in his cases by dropping bombs
37:14
on the internet
37:15
um just on kim jong-un very quickly did
37:17
you guys see it's going around on
37:18
twitter today there's a lady who's
37:19
published a photo of her two
37:21
kneecaps one looks like kim jong-un and
37:24
the other looks like james corden
37:25
yeah and they do they do they look
37:27
exactly like yeah it's hilarious
37:30
um yeah okay james cody james has face
37:34
blindness actually so you wouldn't be
37:35
able to recognize james corden i don't
37:37
have knee blindness
37:39
so finland apparently is the first
37:41
country to create emojis out of national
37:43
symbols
37:44
uh there are three and i bet you can
37:46
guess them all herring
37:48
no sauna yes a naked couple sitting in a
37:51
sauna is one of them
37:52
um oh uh nokia
37:56
yep nokia 3310 and the third one
37:59
is the the flag of finland
38:03
no because that's a kind of fish no it's
38:05
a head banger making a devil horn sign
38:08
with his fingers
38:08
cool which apparently is a sign of
38:10
finland see i would not know that that's
38:13
taught me more about the country of
38:14
finland than i actually already know
38:16
that's true yeah well this is emoji's
38:18
becoming the new language as we are
38:19
constantly told yeah
38:21
have you seen that moby dick has been
38:22
translated into emojis
38:25
emoji deck is what it's called oh wow uh
38:28
so it begins
38:29
now instead of call me ishmael it begins
38:31
telephone man with moustache yacht whale
38:33
okay sign
38:36
and i'm halfway through and it is
38:38
gripping
38:41
that sounds great that's a really fun
38:43
idea i think that sounds awesome i don't
38:45
think anyone will ever read it yeah i
38:46
know but it's the
38:47
the act of it it's just cool to know
38:49
that that exists i read a
38:50
list on have you guys ever read the
38:52
daily wire no no because i didn't
38:54
realize what it was uh it's actually a
38:55
very right-wing publication i didn't
38:57
realize when i opened it so
38:58
i was looking at ridiculous emojis and
39:00
so i saw the heading a list of
39:01
ridiculous emojis so i clicked on the
39:03
article
39:04
the full title is a list of ridiculous
39:06
emojis forced down your throat to help
39:08
push the left's agenda
39:09
and it's about uh it's just an article
39:12
railing against the climate change emoji
39:14
they're very angry about that
39:16
very upset about the gay marriage emoji
39:18
very upset about the safe sex emoji
39:19
it was a really disappointing article
39:21
what's the climate change emoji what's
39:22
it look like
39:23
um i'm not sure if it's actually a lot
39:25
of information
39:27
it's comparing pretty much the largest
39:28
most complicated system on the entire
39:30
planet
39:30
and compressing that into a few pixels
39:32
that's a tough emoji
39:34
yeah yeah i guess it's just like
39:37
sunshine sunshine sad face
39:39
aubergine so and that is why you are not
39:43
on the board so
39:46
there is uh a thing so apple and samsung
39:49
will have a different
39:51
poo emoji although there is an emoji for
39:53
pile of feces they
39:54
pick how to design it right so the apple
39:56
one has a
39:57
face on it yeah but the microsoft one
40:00
doesn't smile and it doesn't have a face
40:02
it is just because the
40:03
the code for it in unicode is just pile
40:05
of feces right
40:06
yeah and someone wrote to microsoft
40:09
talking about this whereas
40:10
apple designed there's like there's a
40:12
japanese thing called a lucky golden poo
40:14
which you could buy and you've been able
40:15
to buy that for years and years and
40:16
years and it's a sort of lucky poo
40:18
um so someone wrote to microsoft and
40:20
pointed out that
40:21
the pile of feces emoji
40:24
looks just like the soft scoop ice cream
40:26
emoji
40:27
unfortunately microsoft replied saying
40:29
it is a little unfortunate that the pile
40:31
ends up resembling soft serve
40:33
but we feel that people have specific
40:35
intent when they use this emoji and the
40:36
risk of it being confused
40:38
or misused as soft serve is very low
40:41
so the way you distinguish between ice
40:43
cream and poo if you're with an apple
40:45
product is
40:45
the poo is the one with the face on it
40:47
yeah whereas the way you distinguish
40:49
between the two if both are in microsoft
40:51
is
40:51
the ice cream is the one with the cone
40:53
[Laughter]
40:57
um can i tell you something i think
40:59
you'll really like dan yeah i was
41:01
looking
41:01
into smiley faces you know because their
41:03
smiley face emoji is probably the most
41:05
famous
41:06
and uh there is a smiley face under
41:08
stonehenge
41:10
what i think this might be the oldest
41:13
known
41:13
smiley face so they did what was the
41:16
largest ever
41:17
geophysical study a couple of years ago
41:20
analyzing the earth below stonehenge
41:22
they did this survey
41:23
and they've revealed all these pits in
41:25
different shapes
41:26
understone hens which were made at the
41:28
same time so they're from about 2500 to
41:30
3000 bc
41:32
and one of the shapes is a very distinct
41:34
smiley face
41:35
with the round circle for the head and
41:37
then the grin for the smile
41:38
and then the two dots for the nose
41:40
really so that lends support to the
41:42
theory that it was an early
41:44
center for rave culture
41:49
okay that's it that's all of our facts

starting with you zizinski my fact this
01:43
week is that the first thing that ted
01:45
cruz did after dropping out of the
01:47
republican contest was elbow his wife in
01:49
the face
01:52
and this was so you probably saw that
01:55
uh about a week ago ted cruz dropped out
01:57
the republican race leaving donald trump
01:58
as the only contender
02:00
for the throne of america
02:04
um and yeah it's just it's a great
02:06
youtube clip you should watch it he
02:07
makes this speech in indiana
02:09
saying he's very sorry but you know he
02:11
seems to have not gone that well for him
02:12
he turns away from the microphone he
02:14
elbows his wife in the face
02:15
as he's hugging his dad and then he sort
02:17
of tries to compensate for it
02:18
by then trying to do a three-way hug
02:21
with his dad and his wife and then sort
02:22
of slaps her about a bit as he goes back
02:25
to do that
02:26
uh and that was just seemed like an
02:27
awkward end to an awkward campaign
02:30
i think he's had a very unfortunate time
02:31
ted cruz first of all
02:35
donald trump uh made a reference to a
02:37
jfk's killing and accused cruz at some
02:40
point of having been in a photo with lee
02:42
harvey oswald
02:46
sorry it keeps his father in front of
02:47
the harvey oswald yeah so he's a spawn
02:49
of a murderer
02:50
and then everyone in america seems to
02:53
think that he is the zodiac killer
02:54
even though his first murder was
02:56
committed two years before cruz was born
03:00
i felt like there was um he had an
03:02
online store that had lots of
03:04
odd products that if you were if you're
03:06
trying to eventually run for president
03:07
you wouldn't naturally have but there
03:09
was
03:09
there was this one debate that he had
03:11
with donald trump where um
03:13
he started telling donald trump to
03:14
breathe and trump was like well you
03:16
breathe i'm breathing why can't you
03:17
breathe and he was like i'm breathing
03:18
why don't you breathe they just had this
03:19
real kind of like breathe off kind of
03:21
conversation and then rubio comes in and
03:24
he's like when you guys are done doing
03:26
yoga
03:26
and it's like these weird calls and then
03:29
so
03:30
ted cruz then a few days later for 35
03:32
bucks on his uh
03:34
on his website you could buy the ted
03:35
cruz breathe
03:37
exercise mat uh that you would just you
03:40
know
03:40
learn to breathe better on uh so he was
03:42
just running with these gags and then he
03:44
got sued by a company
03:46
who are a yoga company who are called
03:48
breathe saying you can't suddenly start
03:49
selling
03:50
breathe yoga mats on your website so he
03:52
had to take the whole breathe thing away
03:54
so then he just was selling exercise
03:56
mats
03:58
for no reason it's just why not get an
04:01
exercise man of mine
04:03
this is the whole joke god just i guess
04:05
we're now selling exercise
04:07
well he's gonna do something now so so
04:10
it's it looks now it's gonna be trump
04:11
versus clinton
04:12
right in the american presidential race
04:15
it means it's going to be the most
04:16
unpopular presidential candidate in my
04:18
lifetime
04:19
versus the second most popular candidate
04:22
in my lifetime
04:23
and by a long long way as well yeah i
04:26
think pj
04:27
tweeted a couple of days ago that um
04:30
this uh came out in support for hillary
04:32
and it was a story and the tweet was
04:34
everyone vote for hillary it's the
04:35
second worst thing that could possibly
04:37
happen to the world
04:40
there was a poll this week by the public
04:43
policy poll
04:44
and they like tested how popular donald
04:46
trump is compared to various different
04:48
things
04:49
and it turned out that he is less
04:51
popular than traffic jams
04:53
used car salesmen hipsters jury duty
04:57
the band's nickelback
05:00
[Laughter]
05:04
root canal surgery and lice
05:07
there's another on ted cruz's website
05:10
there's another product that he sold
05:12
which is a thing that he started a kind
05:13
of
05:14
what he was trying i guess to be a kind
05:15
of meme going round which is about he
05:17
called it trumper
05:18
tantrum so the idea is every time donald
05:21
trump was throwing a tantrum he was like
05:22
it's a
05:23
trumper tantrum and i looked at just the
05:25
basic words and you think why didn't you
05:27
just call it a tan trump
05:30
and i don't trust someone who doesn't
05:31
recognize a good pun so
05:34
do you know how to tell if he's angry
05:35
actually donald trump yeah no uh he
05:38
aside from that he starts building walls
05:39
he
05:40
wears a red hat when he's angry this is
05:42
according
05:43
to his butler uh who i think wrote a
05:46
book
05:46
a couple of months ago a few months ago
05:48
and said that the way to tell
05:50
his mood is by the color of hat that
05:51
he's wearing and when he's pissed off he
05:53
wears a red hat
05:54
and that is when to leave iran
06:00
so there's a few this is the american
06:01
elections uh we had the british local
06:04
elections
06:04
uh this week there was a few funny
06:06
amusing things that happened there um
06:08
in wolverhampton uh the conservative
06:10
party accidentally put
06:11
two people up for elections so they came
06:13
first and third
06:15
and one yeah and but the thing is they
06:17
took votes off each other
06:19
so one of them said no no vote for him
06:20
vote for him but people didn't really
06:22
pay any attention
06:23
and if the guy who came third got just
06:25
60 more votes than labour would have got
06:27
in
06:27
and also there's election going on in
06:29
the philippines at the moment
06:31
with the most unbelievably weird man
06:34
yeah he's just won it um his uh campaign
06:37
slogan is
06:38
basically i will kill all the criminals
06:42
rodrigo duterte or duterte
06:46
or the punisher
06:51
it is duterte i think because his
06:53
nickname in his old job was duterte
06:55
harry
06:57
that is a good pun ted cruz could learn
07:00
something
07:00
and that's how he got into power in an
07:03
interview many
07:04
many are asking what my credentials are
07:06
and what i can do for the philippines
07:08
uh they are telling me that they have
07:09
heard i am a womanizer
07:11
that is true that is very true
07:18
he said in the press conference he just
07:20
said that he's quite he's posted about
07:22
his uh
07:23
effect his multiple affairs and the fact
07:24
he uses a lot of viagra to keep himself
07:26
going uh
07:27
boasted about his viagra use yeah it's
07:29
very confident isn't it
07:31
you wait till you see the pills i have
07:33
to take
07:35
to sustain this
07:39
maybe he's got an advertising contact
07:42
but yeah he's reassured the public after
07:45
boasting about all his affairs
07:46
uh that his mistresses won't cost the
07:48
public a lot because he keeps them in
07:50
cheap boarding houses
07:52
and he takes them to short stay hotels
07:54
for sex
07:55
um he's quite a character he's like one
07:58
of these
07:58
uh like strong men um kind of presidents
08:01
that are kind of coming in around the
08:02
world i think he's one of those kind of
08:04
guys
08:04
right um we need to move on to our final
08:06
fact soon so anyone got anything before
08:08
we do
08:08
can i just quickly relate one thing
08:10
about the recent uk elections
08:12
yeah uh in case you missed it there was
08:14
a labor counsellor called duncan enright
08:17
and he was going to be he wanted to be
08:19
the councillor for whitney in the west
08:21
oxfordshire
08:22
area and he sent a tweet out after the
08:24
elections just saying lost by 70 votes
08:27
or so
08:27
thanks for the opportunity to serve the
08:29
fight goes on
08:31
and then about 20 minutes later he sent
08:33
out another tweet saying
08:34
actually it turns out i won bundle of my
08:36
votes under a tory pile
08:38
thanks whitney
08:41
and they just that's how casual voting
08:43
is in this country
08:44
oh we found a bunch more votes under
08:46
this pile of paper
08:47
sorry the fight can stop immediately
08:52
all right so there we have it ted cruz
08:54
accidentally elbows his wife in the face
08:57
now we are moving on to our second fact
08:59
of the show and that is my fact
09:01
my fact this week is that this week
09:03
scientists have discovered
09:05
that we still haven't discovered 99.999
09:10
of life on earth that's a lot now
09:14
the the big story that was in the news
09:16
this week about this is that there's an
09:17
estimate of how much life on earth there
09:19
is and it changes all the time
09:21
but it's quite manageable in a way for
09:23
counting purposes
09:24
uh so in 2011 they thought that there
09:26
was about 8.7
09:27
million different forms of life on the
09:29
planet they just found out through this
09:31
new study that they reckon that that
09:32
number has gone up from 8.7 million
09:35
to one trillion one trillion
09:39
what are these things that we haven't if
09:42
only there's
09:43
like a few species of yak there's a lot
09:46
of sports to be
09:47
had are they is it very very small
09:49
things yeah it's it's it's
09:51
it's microbes yeah what they did is
09:53
there's a way of kind of working things
09:55
out called scaling laws
09:56
and say you know how big an animal is
09:59
you can kind of tell
10:00
what its meta metabolism is and if the
10:03
bigger it is the more it is so you can
10:04
put the size of the animal in and you
10:06
can work out its metabolism that's an
10:07
example of things
10:08
and another way of doing this is you can
10:10
work out how many big animals there are
10:12
in an area
10:13
and then by putting them into an
10:15
equation you can work out how many
10:16
microbes
10:17
or how many small animals there are as
10:19
well and so they've worked out how many
10:21
big animals they think there are and
10:22
they put it into this scaling equation
10:24
and they come out with
10:25
one trillion oh we just don't know i
10:27
mean
10:28
they are making this up i think it's
10:30
true they they said that there's between
10:32
100 billion
10:33
and one trillion so that is actually
10:35
quite a large
10:37
gap between those two numbers if you
10:39
think about it
10:40
uh think about it
10:43
it is amazing the difference between a
10:45
billion and a trillion is it's a number
10:47
that i'm unable properly to understand
10:49
um so i started thinking about it i
10:51
first thought okay
10:52
everyone always has this dream of having
10:54
a species named after them so i thought
10:55
well if there's a trillion
10:56
surely there's enough for us all right
10:58
to go around so i looked into more than
11:00
enough yeah exactly
11:01
so i looked into how many people have
11:03
existed on earth ever
11:05
all the dead people all the living
11:06
people combined and apparently
11:08
uh according to the population reference
11:10
bureau they estimate
11:11
that about 107 billion people have ever
11:14
existed
11:15
which means that's that's a bit less
11:17
than a trillion so we could do it
11:19
um and that's really that's insane the
11:21
differentiation of
11:23
life on our planet yeah but most of
11:25
those people don't want some crappy bit
11:26
of bacteria named
11:28
they want a large mammal
11:32
that's what's so disappointing about
11:34
this you hear this fact you're like
11:35
brilliant lions everywhere different
11:37
species of life
11:38
oh good it's tiny microbes again they're
11:42
probably really
11:42
interesting you're probably you're
11:44
probably being speciesist
11:46
against these microbes they're probably
11:48
very interesting and i think you could
11:50
probably because i don't know actually
11:51
what a microbe is but
11:52
i reckon i reckon they're probably
11:56
interesting when you look close at them
11:57
do you know the largest
11:58
species that we discovered last year no
12:00
the largest news features
12:01
that i can find so there were 2034 new
12:04
plant species discovered last year alone
12:06
and the biggest was the tree uh
12:08
gilbertio dendron maximum which gets up
12:11
to 45 meters high
12:13
and we haven't found it before wow how
12:14
good was that
12:16
that massive it was craving behind a
12:18
slightly bigger tree
12:21
i was hiding in gabon oh really also
12:24
last year the first ever animal uh found
12:25
on facebook
12:27
um sorry no sorry it was an insect
12:28
eating plant i think it was identified
12:30
because someone saw it on facebook
12:32
i don't think i had an account
12:36
no mutual friends
12:42
what was really cool about i saw that
12:43
article and it was basically
12:45
a guy found this plant and he put a
12:47
picture of it on
12:48
and then he had a friend i think who saw
12:50
it and thought that's something
12:52
new but what's great about it is because
12:54
the photo was geotagged
12:56
they knew exactly where it was so they
12:58
could go and find it and they could
12:59
check it out and check it out and find
13:01
out that it actually was a real
13:02
new plan it's really cool that's amazing
13:05
i think maybe social media isn't such a
13:07
mistake after all
13:10
actually i think it's the sake of
13:11
categorizing it's like the finding is
13:12
the fun part but then they're all
13:14
sitting in like museums or like
13:15
botanical gardens waiting for some poor
13:17
intern to put them in a list that's true
13:19
and that's where the hold up is i reckon
13:22
that's true 2014 a new species that was
13:24
discovered that was collected by darwin
13:27
like that's that's how yeah so in the in
13:29
the natural history museum
13:31
every week they discover about 50 new
13:33
different species because they're going
13:34
through the backlog so they still
13:36
haven't gone through all of darwin's
13:37
stuff
13:38
and they keep going through and going oh
13:39
my god this is a new beatles please
13:40
surely bump that up to the top of the
13:42
list
13:43
just finished darwin yeah wow i've been
13:46
looking up a few things about david
13:47
attenborough
13:48
because he's a man who has a lot of
13:49
things named after him
13:51
species and things like that and
13:53
obviously news this week
13:54
hot news no one saw it coming his
13:57
birthday
13:58
yeah who knew thanks we'll pass that on
14:04
pass on that incredibly half-hearted
14:07
audience reaction how old is he
14:10
he's 90. i found out this thing about
14:13
him that in 2011 he sold
14:14
132 year old murder
14:19
in a sense
14:20
[Laughter]
14:22
there was a murder that happened in 1879
14:25
and it was a a woman called julia martha
14:28
thomas who was killed
14:29
by her her housekeeper it was called
14:32
kate webster and
14:33
webster was arrested and she was tried
14:35
and she was convicted and then executed
14:37
but the one thing that was never found
14:39
was the the murdered woman's head
14:42
and this was found in david
14:43
attenborough's garden
14:45
when he was having an extension done to
14:47
his home
14:48
uh 2000 2011 and the murder was 1879.
14:51
okay so it was 200 and 132 132.
14:56
and he's only 90. so he's not in the
14:57
frame
14:59
so he claims
15:03
imagine that scoop
15:06
he's incredible yeah wow david
15:09
so well done him for having an extension
15:11
done
15:14
awesome clever david yeah
15:17
also well done here but i think he's
15:18
probably prouder of that but um
15:20
when he was 89 so not long ago he
15:24
became
15:30
he broke the record for the deepest
15:32
anyone's dived on the great barrier reef
15:34
so he went down a thousand feet on the
15:37
great barrier reef in a submersible with
15:38
a person who knew how to drive a
15:40
semester
15:41
it was brilliant i just think that's
15:42
incredible and there's footage of him
15:43
doing it he looks so comfortable and he
15:45
said
15:45
it was brilliant he wasn't nervous at
15:47
all it was like being in a cinema or
15:48
something
15:49
you're in absolute comfort you're just
15:51
in there munching chocolate and saying
15:52
this is wonderful
15:56
i've got to sit next to him this is
15:59
wonderful
16:02
it's not meant to be white
16:12
[Laughter]
16:17
when i was looking for stuff about
16:19
leicester city i was reading the lester
16:21
mercury
16:22
and they had a headline today it was
16:24
today in the leicester mercury
16:25
and it said should east midlands airport
16:28
be renamed after sir david attenborough
16:31
and i think we should let the internet
16:34
decide
16:37
you're pretty angry about boating at
16:38
boat face right andy we have calmed down
16:41
in the months since it happened you know
16:43
let me see if we can wind you up
16:46
so obviously they've named the boat now
16:47
after david attenborough instead
16:49
don't worry voting my boat face still
16:50
survives it's a remotely operated
16:52
vehicle aboard david attenborough
16:54
yeah it's uh yeah they've been they've
16:57
installed it on him
16:59
no it's a submarine which they've uh it
17:01
looks really beautiful and there was
17:03
quite
17:03
quite finally there was a petition on i
17:06
think it was change.org
17:07
uh for david attenborough to change his
17:09
name now to beautiful
17:12
yeah but yeah he's also the only person
17:15
i just love this david adam in fact he's
17:17
the only person
17:18
to have received a bafta in five
17:19
different formats so he's received
17:21
baftas in black and white
17:23
color hd 3d and 4k
17:26
tv and even though no one knows what 4k
17:29
tv is
17:30
that's still cool it's just extremely
17:32
high resolution television
17:33
good great work dave yeah um we need to
17:36
move on very shortly to our next fact we
17:38
got anything else before we do
17:39
i can quickly tell you about a video
17:41
that i saw on youtube if you wanted
17:43
so there's this fisherman in australia
17:45
called ronald honeyset
17:47
and he was in australia and you can see
17:49
the video and there's this little thing
17:50
floating around and he's like is it i
17:53
think it might be a sea slug
17:55
or is it a new species of jellyfish and
17:57
so he put it onto youtube to see if
17:59
people will be able to tell what it was
18:01
and they pretty quickly managed to
18:02
identify it as a rather large poo
18:10
who did their name
18:16
okay look we need to move on we need to
18:17
move on to our third fact of the evening
18:19
and that is james harkin
18:22
okay my fact this week is that as well
18:25
as winning the premier league title
18:27
the owners of leicester city also won
18:30
the world
18:30
elephant polo championships
18:35
and no one is talking about that what's
18:38
going on
18:39
what what versatile men they are
18:42
um does anyone go straight okay
18:46
they bought leicester city but they've
18:47
also done another few different kind of
18:49
spots and they're really good at polo
18:51
and as well as being really good at polo
18:53
they're really good at elephant polo
18:54
and
19:01
and he's one of the players on the b
19:03
team for the horse polo
19:05
so they they put there but not the
19:06
elephant polo not the elephant
19:09
and i read that miss thailand competes
19:11
in the elephant polo so i don't know how
19:13
high the standards are
19:14
even for that is that is that her talent
19:17
round
19:19
right actually elephant polo started off
19:21
as a bit of a joke it was invented by
19:22
two british guys
19:23
in the 90s or the 80s they kind of
19:25
thought it was just a funny thing to do
19:27
but then now it's kind of become a much
19:28
bigger thing and it's a charity event
19:30
it's a little bit controversial they
19:32
make a load of money and they give it to
19:33
elephant charities
19:35
but also um there's there was an
19:36
activist um called lek chileart
19:39
um from thailand who said elephants are
19:41
not made for polo
19:43
it would be a perverse god
19:45
[Laughter]
19:48
he's quite an eccentric man ranieri
19:50
isn't he so that's the manager of
19:51
leicester yes professor manager who
19:53
at the start of the season he was the
19:54
bookie's favorite to be the first
19:56
manager in the premiership to be saks
19:57
i read i think this is a guardian that
19:59
said he's an eccentric who offered a win
20:00
bonus of
20:01
pizza at a local restaurant to
20:03
incentivize his players
20:06
it's that kind of like unattainable
20:08
price
20:10
in order to get them um he also he used
20:14
to rally them with his cry of dilly-ding
20:16
dilly-dong
20:17
and when asked why that was the cry that
20:19
he rallied them with he said
20:21
it was because he couldn't sing so he
20:22
pretended to be a bell instead
20:26
i think he achieved that
20:30
my favorite thing definitely uh looking
20:32
into the story is the fact that because
20:34
they're a thai family
20:35
um they they massively subscribe to
20:37
buddhism and so they were flying over
20:39
for every home game
20:40
monks to come and bless the team they
20:42
would slap
20:43
jamie vardy and the rest of the team
20:44
players legs with these lashes that they
20:46
were blessing them with
20:48
and while the team was out there they
20:49
sat back a bunch of monks
20:51
chanting away kind of guessing how the
20:53
game was going based on the cheers
20:55
and just chanting away for their to
20:57
bless the team to win
20:58
they planted relics underneath the pitch
21:01
so the whole thing is it's extraordinary
21:03
it's a
21:04
they honestly they it's it's a massive
21:07
um buddhist monk victory this whole
21:10
season
21:11
it's incredible they built he built them
21:13
a temple i think or a shrine
21:15
apparently the uh someone who worked at
21:17
the uh the club i think one of the chefs
21:19
said that the pitch was full of covered
21:21
in white marks from where the monks kept
21:23
on blessing it
21:24
and i don't know how they're blessing it
21:27
and i'm not suggesting that
21:36
and so a lot of the stories about
21:38
leicester winning the title is how they
21:40
were five thousand to one at the start
21:42
of the year yeah so i thought i'd look
21:43
at a few things about odds and things
21:45
like that
21:46
two guys kelly and justin tomlinson who
21:49
if either of them becomes prime minister
21:51
they're going to get 500 000
21:53
pounds and that's because they put a bet
21:55
on when they're at university at 10
21:56
thousand to one
21:57
that they would become prime minister
21:59
and they're both currently
22:01
conservative mps
22:05
there's another thing that i saw that a
22:07
lot of people put a bet on them becoming
22:09
a hundred turning a hundred and the way
22:11
that they work out the odds on that is
22:12
they take your age
22:14
subtract it from 100 and that's the odds
22:17
so if i'm
22:17
what am i 37 so that would mean that i
22:20
would be 63 to 1
22:22
um to reach 100. that's how they work it
22:25
out that's quite interesting
22:26
okay well that's it that is uh lester
22:28
are also the elephant polo
22:30
owners which is amazing the champions of
22:32
the world in two different sports let's
22:34
move on to our final fact of the show
22:36
and that is andrew hunter murray my fact
22:39
is that britain's
22:40
first ever robot was designed to replace
22:42
the duke of york
22:47
so this is in the news because uh it's
22:49
it's a robot that we've lost we don't
22:50
know where it went it was in 1928 it was
22:52
built and there's a campaign the science
22:54
museum are launching to
22:55
uh to rebuild it they've got the designs
22:57
and they want to make a new one so
22:59
i think there's a kickstarter but this
23:00
is the most incredible robot
23:03
it was called eric and um it was
23:06
it was 1928 the duke of york was meant
23:07
to open a
23:09
an exhibition for the society of model
23:11
engineers and then he dropped out and so
23:13
the the guy who was organizing the
23:15
exhibition
23:16
said well we need a replacement and he
23:17
and an engineer you made one
23:19
and it stood up on the day and it made a
23:22
four-minute speech and it looked around
23:23
and um it answered questions and its
23:26
teeth were sparking because there were
23:27
35 000 volts of electricity going
23:29
through them
23:31
and then eric just went on tour around
23:33
the world and huge audiences came to see
23:36
him and that we have no idea where he
23:37
went in the end
23:38
do you think the audience had been
23:39
warned that there had been a change of
23:40
booking people there going the duke of
23:42
looks looking weird
23:45
so this this just to clarify this is um
23:48
a science museum kickstarter
23:50
the science museum of london has
23:51
actually set this up and what is what
23:53
they've had is they've found not
23:54
eric himself the robot they found the
23:57
plans of the robot
23:58
and the idea is that they now want to
23:59
refund it send him back around the world
24:01
to uh to talk to people i guess i don't
24:04
quite know but it's it's
24:05
they're opening up quite a similar kind
24:07
of uh robotic exhibition so they thought
24:09
let's get eric back on the scene yeah
24:11
they're rebuilding a lot i think
24:12
yeah aren't they i read an article in
24:14
the sunderland daily
24:15
echo from the 1930s and they said that
24:19
eric
24:19
was the perfect husband eric should
24:21
prove the idol of all the girls
24:23
he never swears does not stay out late
24:26
at night and is true of steel
24:28
like a good boy he speaks when he's
24:30
spoken to and confesses he cannot think
24:38
that's fantastic yeah but he i because
24:41
this one keeps all of his women in cheap
24:42
boarding houses
24:45
and short state hotels and you should
24:48
see how much viagra
24:50
gasoline yeah he was so
24:53
you said he was built in did you say
24:54
what it was built 1928.
24:56
wasn't it um but when you look at the
24:58
newspaper archives it seems in the 30s
25:00
and 40s he became really popular
25:02
and i checked the popularity of the name
25:04
eric and eric was not very popular in
25:07
the 20s at
25:07
all and then in so in 1928 there were
25:10
only 186 erics born in britain
25:13
but by 1948 there were two and a half
25:15
thousand
25:16
and by 1958 there were more than eight
25:18
thousand
25:19
so i reckon that eric might have caused
25:21
the popularity
25:23
my god maybe good theory
25:26
um he was so i've got a rival article to
25:29
yours
25:30
uh from the newspaper archives and i
25:31
haven't done much paper it was from but
25:33
must've been a rival paper
25:34
because that said that he is on as
25:36
unattractive as any steel figure you've
25:38
ever seen
25:39
and he is if you look at pictures but
25:42
they were going to build him a sister
25:44
this article said so it promised that
25:45
they say his sister who is now in
25:47
production
25:48
is to be beautiful she's like one of the
25:50
figures in west end store windows
25:52
and i couldn't find anything more of the
25:53
sisters manufacturer so eric's sister
25:56
beautiful
25:57
sister maybe out there i read about
25:58
another robot that was in the news um
26:00
this week
26:01
um so you have a load of robots kind of
26:03
stood next to each other they're only
26:04
like six inches tall or something
26:06
and they're kind of communicating to
26:08
each other in their own little language
26:09
and whenever they notice that humans
26:11
coming by
26:12
they'll turn around and they'll go oh
26:15
hello
26:16
what do you think and then whatever you
26:18
say to them they go
26:19
oh that's interesting and they turn
26:21
around and then carry on their little
26:23
conversation
26:24
they don't understand anything that
26:25
human says but it's just a way of kind
26:28
of
26:28
pretending to be interested in humans
26:31
that is genuinely a push now for
26:33
any robot or ai that they're trying to
26:34
do they're trying to get them to be
26:36
better with humans and be more
26:37
understanding i was reading that to
26:39
google for the past few months they've
26:40
just uh spoken about this this week but
26:42
this has been going on for two months or
26:44
so
26:44
um they have been feeding so they have a
26:46
bunch of ai computers and the idea is
26:48
that the ai computers can learn better
26:50
to interact with humans through various
26:52
different ways the current
26:53
way that they're doing it is that they
26:55
are feeding these ai machines
26:57
at google currently they're halfway
26:59
through about halfway through
27:01
2865 romance novels
27:04
so they're just making the ai read
27:06
romance novels
27:08
and and like the titles like fatal
27:10
desire jacked up
27:12
unconditional love doesn't sound very
27:15
romantic
27:17
well for a robot it would be
27:24
the idea is that apparently um when
27:26
we're googling things
27:27
our conversation in terms of the google
27:29
so we'll sometimes do
27:30
quite a sort of chatty google is very
27:34
predictable and the best predictable
27:35
dialogue you can find is in
27:37
romance novels and so they look to that
27:39
and they feed it in so they they come
27:41
back
27:41
um i another just on the whole thing
27:43
about big companies trying to work
27:45
ai into uh so google doing the romance
27:48
novels
27:49
microsoft a while ago did you read about
27:51
their chat bot
27:52
so does everyone know about this chatbot
27:54
oh my god okay everyone knows let's move
27:56
on
27:57
but it's well i can say if you don't
27:59
know it in the room uh basically they
28:01
had this chatbot
28:02
whereby they thought that it would just
28:03
start its own twitter feed and it would
28:05
start talking to they're talking to
28:06
people and within 24 hours
28:08
it transformed itself into what the
28:10
article says is an evil hitler-loving
28:12
incestual
28:13
sex-promoting busted proclaiming robots
28:17
and all of its tweets to people writing
28:20
to her
28:21
said that she she started calling them
28:23
daddy and asking them to shag her
28:26
that's all those romance novels she has
28:29
since announced that she will be voting
28:31
trumps
28:34
but yeah it goes wrong they thought they
28:35
were going to do something that would
28:36
respond fantastically well
28:38
did it take things that people were or
28:40
that were proving especially
28:42
attractions
28:47
and so people started they realized that
28:49
and started tweeting really racist
28:51
things and it just picked it all up
28:52
we need to wrap up really shortly so if
28:54
you've got anything i have a
28:56
well i have a quick thing about the duke
28:57
of york remember that
29:01
um i just thought i'd see what's going
29:03
on in duke of york news
29:05
um because of the britain's first robot
29:07
thing um so in the last month
29:08
prince andrew has opened a business club
29:11
in hungary
29:12
he has opened a luxury bed factory in
29:14
castle donington
29:15
and a roundabout in kent named after him
29:18
has caught fire
29:21
um so we're going to wrap up very
29:23
shortly there were a bunch of stories
29:25
that we really wanted to talk about
29:26
tonight as our headline topics but we
29:28
didn't get time
29:29
so just very quickly could you just let
29:31
us know james andy and anna what you
29:33
would have gone for
29:33
tonight one that we didn't get a chance
29:35
to say uh is this one which is new
29:37
research reveals
29:39
that 20 of americans are put off by the
29:42
word
29:42
moist moist
29:48
anyone moist yeah definitely a few
29:51
people over there
29:53
uh yeah uh anna what do you got uh yeah
29:55
i like this that
29:57
uh after a man in croydon lost a bet
29:59
with a friend
30:00
the frozen food company iceland has
30:02
warned shoppers
30:03
not to lie down in their freezers to
30:06
cool off
30:12
and finally andy in china under new
30:15
guidelines from the ministry of culture
30:17
live streaming services have banned the
30:19
eating of bananas in an erotic manner
30:24
but someone an unnamed chinese person
30:26
has just said they will eat yams instead
30:31
okay that's it that is all of our facts
30:33

00:10
hello
00:10
and welcome to another episode of no
00:12
such thing as a fish a weekly
00:14
podcast coming to you from the qi
00:16
offices in covent garden
00:18
my name is anna tashinsky and i'm joined
00:20
today by anne miller
00:21
james harkin and andrew hunter murray
00:24
and once again we've gathered around the
00:25
microphones with our four favorite facts
00:27
from the last seven
00:28
days and in no particular order here
00:31
they
00:31
are starting with anne my fact is that
00:35
the alarm clock on the mere space
00:36
station made the same noise as their
00:38
emergency alarm that weight you up
00:39
wouldn't it would wake you up with a
00:41
start
00:41
so this is helen sherman who was the
00:43
first briton in space he spent eight
00:44
days up there in 1991
00:46
and she was interviewed recently and
00:47
said quote you'd wake up unsure if it
00:49
was time to get up or if you were
00:51
leaking oxygen
00:52
it got us out of our sleeping bags
00:53
pretty quick and was that why they did
00:55
it do we know or was it just like they
00:57
didn't have
00:58
any other sounds on file i like to think
01:00
they just thought we've got one alarm
01:02
that'll work that'll do it does sound
01:04
like a really effective way of getting
01:05
out of bed i mean
01:06
yeah terrifying smart yeah wake up
01:10
fearing for your life that's pretty much
01:13
how i feel waking up every morning
01:16
did you know that her mission the juno
01:17
mission was actually a commercial
01:19
mission and while she was up there she
01:21
had to do an advert for interflora
01:23
no was it because interflora like
01:26
interstellar
01:26
is that the was that the reasoning um
01:28
you should work in advertising andy
01:31
i'm not sure actually the flower company
01:34
yeah
01:35
they actually weren't interstellar
01:36
though were they they were probably
01:38
closer to
01:38
our stella than they were on earth for
01:41
some of the time they were
01:41
interplanetary
01:42
yeah yeah for whoever you're into get
01:45
them
01:48
you should not work together um
01:51
mir sounds incredibly shonky so there
01:54
was a thing about how
01:55
the solar panels were damaged that was
01:56
how i find it really all the
01:58
space stations are solar powered i
02:00
suppose it's obvious but often the
02:01
lights would go out and they'd just have
02:02
to wait in the dark
02:04
until they came back on really yeah yeah
02:06
it was really dodgy wasn't it they had a
02:08
few uh very
02:09
near near disaster incidents it caught
02:11
fire in the 90s in 1997
02:14
fire started and they've tried to
02:16
extinguish it with a wet towel at first
02:18
i think which made it worse and just
02:19
made everything very smoky
02:20
so they all had to put their respiratory
02:22
masks on at which point
02:24
they realized that half the respiratory
02:25
mass didn't work
02:27
and so while they weren't working and
02:29
they were all suffocating they tried to
02:30
pull the fire extinguishers off the wall
02:32
and i think seven out of the ten fire
02:34
extinguishers were actually stuck to the
02:35
wall so they couldn't be removed to put
02:36
the fire out
02:38
how did they did get it out they got the
02:39
other three fire extinguishers and used
02:41
those instead
02:42
um and they were fine but it sounds
02:44
entertaining that was terrifying do you
02:46
think they called that a mere miss
02:48
i hope they did so the mere space
02:51
station
02:52
when it was decommissioned um
02:55
it would just have to be sent back into
02:57
the earth's atmosphere to shatter over
02:58
the pacific
02:59
and it looks really beautiful so i
03:01
really love that idea and when the
03:02
international space station is
03:03
decommissioned is de-orbited
03:05
that'll do the same thing i think so it
03:07
just gets brought back into earth's
03:08
orbit and then
03:10
you make sure that it gets brought back
03:11
at a place where it's not going to rain
03:12
down over a well-populated area
03:14
and it looks like a whole it looks like
03:16
a meteor shower or something doesn't it
03:17
yeah
03:18
is that where they all land in point
03:20
nemo andy
03:21
yes so point nemo is the area of the
03:24
ocean that's furthest away from any land
03:26
yeah and is it full of i remember you
03:28
told me this is full of
03:30
spaceships it's full of old spacecraft
03:31
that's where they try and get them all
03:32
to land or they sort of they work it out
03:36
exactly yeah so there's the least chance
03:37
of life unless you're on a fishing
03:39
expedition to point nemo
03:40
to get away from it fun finding nemo
03:43
themed expedition
03:46
yeah um here's a cool thing i found out
03:49
once you get back so in space basically
03:51
you're a bit like a superhuman chris
03:53
hadfield said you know you could move a
03:54
massive fridge or whatever with the tips
03:56
of his fingers i don't know why he was
03:57
moving a fridge around on the iss
03:59
but he said that when you get back
04:00
obviously you're much weaker because
04:02
your muscles atrophy in space but the
04:03
other thing he said
04:04
is that you can feel the weight of your
04:06
lips and your tongue
04:08
and you have to get used to speaking
04:10
with a tongue that weighs something oh
04:12
great now i can feel the weight of my
04:14
tongue if you're saying that in space
04:15
you he had sort of automatically
04:17
learned how to speak with a weightless
04:19
tongue because
04:21
you're all weightless so you don't
04:22
really realize at the time and when you
04:23
return it's a little bit harder that's
04:25
amazing is it also hard then to keep
04:27
your eyes open
04:28
and then when you come back to earth
04:29
from outer space surely you feel the
04:31
weight of gravity
04:32
when helen shaman came back she said
04:34
that she kind of felt a bit weird and
04:35
that her brain felt heavy
04:37
wow maybe she just got way cleverer in
04:39
space learn more stuff
04:41
is that what happens that your brain
04:42
gets heavier the cleverer you are yes
04:44
everyone knows you get smarter in space
04:46
and your brain gets heavier when you get
04:47
clever
04:48
it's like our full kindle with like a
04:49
tiny tiny point of a
04:51
gram more than an empty kindle oh yeah
04:53
so our brains are like
04:54
hang on surely if you learn something
04:57
and new connections are made in your
04:58
brain
04:59
yeah they weigh something though don't
05:00
they those cells i mean
05:02
doesn't that mean that a really clever
05:04
brain will weigh a tiny bit more than
05:05
one with no information that's why they
05:07
used to try and like examine einstein's
05:08
brain and stuff doesn't it because they
05:09
thought they have
05:10
like the secret of big brains or small
05:11
brains i don't think anyone knows
05:13
i think this is a conversation for the
05:15
neuroscientist podcast rather than a
05:17
bunch of idiots who don't know anything
05:18
about neuroscience
05:19
i can tell you a historical thing about
05:21
this i think it was galton but it was
05:23
some
05:23
certainly someone like that from the
05:25
victorian age who was kind of
05:27
believed in eugenics or something and he
05:29
thought that people with bigger heads
05:31
must have bigger brains and must be
05:33
smarter but he needed to work out how to
05:35
weigh people's brains and how to find
05:37
the
05:37
size of their heads and so what he would
05:39
do is he'd go into a pub
05:41
and find two people with kind of big
05:43
heads and then start an argument between
05:45
them
05:45
and say this guy says your head's small
05:49
this guy says your head's small and he
05:51
goes but don't worry
05:52
i'll measure your heads and i'll tell
05:54
you who's the best and then he got his
05:56
uh measurements that way
05:57
was he had he just had a lot of refusals
05:59
going up and politely asking people so
06:01
you have to come up with a way around it
06:02
don't measure my head
06:04
i just say yes though if someone asks me
06:06
if they want to measure my head
06:07
i'd be welcome for it yeah if anyone
06:09
wants my head measured if you ever see
06:10
anna in the street
06:12
measure happy to help can we talk about
06:15
alarm clocks
06:17
um so the first alarm clock
06:20
only went off at four in the morning
06:22
that i found
06:23
yes that's fantastic how good is that
06:24
after it was invented it took another 60
06:26
years before
06:27
the first alarm clock was invented which
06:29
you could um why not people want to get
06:31
up at 4am there's just one guy
06:33
he's called levi hutchins he was from
06:36
new hampshire and he
06:37
started work uh soon after 4 a.m so that
06:40
was the time he got up
06:41
so he just set it it was totally
06:44
unadaptable
06:45
um and so the first alarm clock that you
06:48
could adjust was patented in france in
06:49
1847 but he was 1787. uh i have a type
06:53
of
06:53
alarm clock um this is from a designer
06:56
called randolfo
06:57
and it's called the good morning
06:58
underwear and it's a pair of pants that
07:01
vibrate to wake you up in the morning
07:03
wow right this is a designer who kind of
07:06
likes to do
07:07
electronic clothing or wearable tech
07:10
especially underwear
07:12
and he said i finally wanted to make a
07:14
garment that my girlfriend would
07:15
actually want to wear
07:17
while it might be hard to believe when i
07:19
made the clap off bra
07:21
it was not really for her
07:24
the clap off bro yeah so what you do is
07:27
you
07:28
clap and then your girlfriend or wife's
07:31
bra falls off that's fantastic
07:33
if you went to a comedy club
07:37
just have to hope everyone is really bad
07:40
i read about um two simple alarm clocks
07:42
one of which i would say is higher risk
07:44
than the other
07:44
one is that um you can build if you
07:46
build your house so when you have your
07:48
bedroom so near the window where the sun
07:49
comes in then
07:50
actually you'll wake up in the morning
07:51
which is a lovely idea waking up to the
07:52
sunrise
07:53
the other idea is that you just drink
07:55
loads of water before you go to sleep
07:56
and your body will wake you i do that it
07:59
works 80
08:00
of the time but
08:03
supposedly it's a native american thing
08:05
isn't it and that it still got practiced
08:07
even into the 20th century
08:08
what was the drinking thing yeah oh my
08:10
gosh i am so
08:12
connected to my fellow native americans
08:15
thank you i do that they used to drink
08:17
water not pinot grigio
08:20
um i read that alarm clocks is one of
08:22
the most common things displaced by
08:23
smartphones
08:25
now yeah that makes a lot of sense i've
08:26
still got three alarm clocks actually so
08:28
i'm keeping the industry going but have
08:29
you are they all set at different times
08:32
uh two of them have broken oh okay why
08:34
do you still keep them
08:35
because i have this fantasy that i'm
08:37
going to go into the back of one and fix
08:38
it one day that's an incredible fantasy
08:42
your dreams must be amazing pretty wild
08:45
inside my head clock fixing
08:48
and stamp collecting all night long my
08:51
dreams
08:53
so just a couple more weird alarm clocks
08:55
these are off kickstarter
08:57
these are current kickstarter alarm
08:59
clocks uh one of them
09:01
is as soon as you wake up it gives you
09:04
um your estimated life expectancy and
09:06
your financial information
09:08
and it's supposed to be the most
09:09
depressing alarm clock of all time is
09:12
that worse than the emergency alarm
09:13
going off
09:14
i think it is because it says you're
09:15
going to die in 20 years and you've got
09:17
no money
09:18
not necessarily if you're a billionaire
09:19
child then that's fantastic
09:25
what's the idea that it would force you
09:26
to get up because you need to make more
09:28
money and
09:28
spend as much time awake as possible
09:29
before death i think it's a bit like a
09:31
memento mori which is kind of it just
09:33
reminds you that you will die one day
09:35
and it helps you grasp
09:36
life no not remotely okay fine i tried
09:39
to cheat it by killing myself
09:41
immediately and be like
09:43
you were wrong well you could be the
09:45
winner there
09:47
just immediately spend a load of money
09:49
on amazon and kill yourself
09:52
in your face mr alarm what was it was
09:55
there another one james
09:56
um here's another one um the money
09:58
shredding alarm clock
10:01
um he this is a guy who combined a clock
10:04
kit
10:04
with a usb paper shredder and basically
10:08
put a load of money in there
10:09
and then the alarm goes off and the
10:11
slower it takes you to wake up and turn
10:13
the alarm off the more of your money
10:15
gets shredded
10:15
that is fantastic a tip hot tip for
10:18
people out there put your partner's
10:19
money in it
10:20
sleep for as long as you like there's
10:22
someone who doesn't have a joint bank
10:23
account
10:25
[Music]
10:28
okay time for our second fact and that
10:30
is from james
10:32
okay my fact this week is that the
10:34
bosnian national anthem
10:36
is almost identical in melody to the
10:39
theme for the movie national lampoon's
10:41
animal house
10:43
that sounds fast who came first um
10:46
national lab who came
10:47
first basically bosnia is quite a new
10:50
country
10:50
and when it became a country they needed
10:52
a national anthem and they found a guy
10:53
to write it
10:54
and we think that perhaps he might have
10:57
been
10:58
somehow um subconsciously
11:01
subconsciously perhaps influenced by
11:03
this uh movie because if you were going
11:05
to pick a movie
11:06
to nick the theme tune of it probably
11:08
wouldn't be national lampoon's animal
11:09
house that's true although if you
11:11
googled national anthem
11:12
and spelt it slightly wrong and it said
11:14
did you mean national lampoon
11:19
um yeah well the other thing is that the
11:20
national anthem of bosnia uh has no
11:22
official lyrics so you really are just
11:24
listening to the theme
11:25
for national level uh and google it uh
11:28
go on to youtube and listen to them
11:29
because they are
11:30
remarkably similar and this um fact
11:32
actually comes from a book that i read a
11:34
fantastic book called republic or death
11:36
uh by a guy called alex marshall and
11:38
it's full of kind of qi facts about
11:40
national anthems i absolutely love it
11:42
i've found so much stuff in there so he
11:44
alex marshall is
11:46
quite firmly sympathetic towards the guy
11:48
who wrote this isn't he dusan sestic
11:50
that's right and says it implies that it
11:52
really was a subconscious thing and i
11:53
think this guy might have been screwed
11:54
out of quite a bit of money from the
11:56
bosnian government now who
11:57
are refusing to pay him because they
11:59
didn't like the lyrics that he wrote
12:00
eventually
12:01
um yeah they have the lyrics have been
12:03
written and they've been approved by one
12:05
body but they
12:06
still haven't been approved by a council
12:07
of ministers so at the moment there are
12:09
no lyrics
12:10
the spanish one hasn't got any words
12:11
either has it oh is it not
12:13
i read that they had a competition to
12:14
give words for it but no one really
12:16
liked them so they took them out
12:17
oh really um they're amazing yes south
12:19
sudan obviously
12:20
it's still the world's newest country
12:22
isn't it yeah it must be um they had an
12:24
x factor style competition for this with
12:26
literally had a row of judges uh and you
12:28
had to present it and i did not know
12:30
that south sudan was nearly called the
12:32
nile republic
12:33
was it it was one of the names they
12:34
considered yeah so there's a
12:36
story attested to in the 19th century um
12:39
which is that the sultan of malaysia
12:41
visited queen victoria was invited to
12:43
visit queen victoria in 1888 i think
12:46
and they didn't have a national anthem
12:48
at the time the malaysians
12:50
but when the sultan got to meet queen
12:52
victoria her
12:53
aide said oh by the way when we're
12:55
formally welcoming you uh we want to be
12:57
able to sing and play your national
12:58
anthem so what is it
12:59
um and the aide was too embarrassed to
13:01
say we don't have one
13:02
and so he just thought the first tune he
13:04
could think of which was some local tune
13:05
from the seychelles that he'd once heard
13:07
which was a french origin i think
13:09
and hummed that and to this day that is
13:10
the malaysian nationalism no
13:12
way didn't they change the malaysian
13:14
anthem when they became independent
13:16
because benjamin britain wrote one for
13:17
them in 1957.
13:19
oh did he um but he had didn't he only
13:22
be in the country for a few hours he
13:23
didn't particularly have the best time
13:25
the lyrics are all about the airport
13:28
they have great toblerone and lovely
13:32
duty-free the beer is a bit pricey
13:34
um he's supposed to go and visit a
13:36
rubber plantation but instead spent the
13:38
whole trip terrified he's going to be
13:39
attacked under attack
13:40
and he said uh quote we had a taste of
13:42
what it's like to live always armed and
13:44
in fear of one's life
13:45
and at one point they were stuck in a
13:46
thunderstorm and spent the entire hour
13:48
terrified that someone was going to find
13:49
them
13:50
and did all these quotes make it into
13:52
the lyrics he wrote for the national
13:53
they didn't go with his national anthem
13:55
[Laughter]
13:57
they had a huge competition in the 50s
13:58
and they didn't like their entries they
14:00
thought we'll ask spencer in britain and
14:01
see if he can come up with something
14:02
and instead they went with a cabaret
14:04
song i think
14:06
oh i have a fact about cabaret songs and
14:07
national anthems so
14:09
um the germans only sing the third verse
14:12
of their national anthem and that's
14:13
partly because the first verse begins
14:15
deutschland deutschland uber
14:17
is very heavily associated uh with the
14:19
nazi times obviously
14:20
um so after the second world war west
14:22
germany had no official national anthem
14:24
because there was a big program of what
14:25
was called denazification where they
14:27
were trying to restore
14:28
civil society as it had been before uh
14:30
1933
14:31
so at football matches people started
14:33
singing a carnival
14:34
song as their kind of unofficial
14:36
national anthem which was taking the
14:38
mickey out of the allied
14:39
powers who were still obviously
14:41
occupying at the time so that was uh
14:43
that was another carnival song that got
14:44
used as a
14:45
oh did they actually use it as a
14:46
national anthem for a while no i don't
14:48
it was it was always unofficial
14:50
sometimes they started playing it and
14:51
belgian soldiers who were occupying
14:52
heard it and they stood up thinking oh
14:54
this is the national anthem then that's
14:55
great
14:56
isn't there a lot there's a um verse of
14:58
god say the queen that we don't sing
14:59
because it's got a line about rebellious
15:00
scots to crush
15:01
i always sing that one i only sing that
15:03
one
15:05
i feel very secure to being here god
15:08
save the queen wasn't that the national
15:09
anthem for a lot of countries
15:11
when it was first written i think licked
15:12
inside had the same tune i think they
15:14
have different words
15:15
it would be amazing if they had the same
15:17
words
15:19
it's already done we could just change
15:20
it god save the queen and lichtenstein
15:24
apparently when liechtenstein play
15:26
football against scotland they always
15:27
get their national anthem booed
15:29
oh that's so right my favorite story
15:30
ever of scottish people effort match is
15:32
when they went to italy
15:33
and allegedly we're singing we're going
15:34
to deep fry our pizzas
15:36
oh yeah i just think it's um so i think
15:40
a lot of
15:40
a lot of countries had the english
15:42
national anthem before anyone
15:44
else had a national anthem so i think
15:46
god save the king was the first
15:47
uh that came up in 1745 and became our
15:50
national anthem and lots of other
15:51
countries thought okay that sounds like
15:52
a good idea national anthems but
15:54
didn't think to write their own and so
15:56
you know within a few decades uh the
15:58
german states russia denmark
16:00
the kingdom of hawaii they all had the
16:02
english national anthem as their
16:04
national anthem as in that melody
16:06
and liechtenstein is the one that still
16:08
kept it couldn't be bothered to ever
16:09
drop it
16:10
um i read a list of national anthem
16:12
titles and there are some from around
16:13
the world which are unbelievably good
16:15
let's hear some
16:16
uh so i think the best around the entire
16:19
world
16:19
uh is bhutan's the thunder dragon
16:22
kingdom
16:23
yes amazing poland has poland is not yet
16:26
lost so long as we still live
16:28
very lively um equatorial guineas is let
16:32
us tread the path of our immense
16:34
happiness
16:38
[Laughter]
16:48
in europe the cleanup operation is awful
16:52
after everyone signed it
16:55
um so burkina faso uh their national
16:57
anthem is one single night and these are
17:00
the opening lines this is in translation
17:01
obviously but
17:02
um against the humiliating bondage of a
17:05
thousand years
17:06
rapacity came from afar to subjugate
17:08
them for a hundred years
17:09
against the cynical malice in the shape
17:11
of neocolonialism and its petty local
17:14
servants
17:15
wow i prefer
17:20
um the english public don't want god
17:22
save the queen to be their national
17:23
anthem
17:24
mostly so at the moment i think a bill
17:26
was proposed in parliament at the start
17:28
of this year
17:29
to have an english national anthem
17:30
because weird english people
17:32
get upset that we have to share our
17:33
national anthem with the scottish
17:35
and the welsh they're also not thrilled
17:38
yeah um so the northern irish and
17:42
the northern ireland and the elections
17:45
okay too many people are sharing god
17:46
save the queen and there's not enough to
17:48
go around
17:48
so there's a movement to change the
17:50
english national anthem i think
17:51
one of the popular choices is obviously
17:53
land of hope and glory which i think 55
17:55
of the english public would like uh
17:57
which is a catchy tune
17:58
but which uh elgar who wrote the tune
18:01
for it
18:02
didn't like and he really hated the way
18:05
that it was
18:06
appropriated for kind of jingoistic
18:08
causes and it was sung to get the
18:10
english troops uh riled up in the first
18:13
world
18:14
war and elga already disapproved of that
18:15
and he didn't like the lyrics that were
18:17
written to it which are written by
18:18
someone else
18:19
so when you're saying that feeling
18:20
patriotic you should know that the man
18:22
who wrote it
18:22
was not up for that i think we should
18:24
ask the internet what should be our
18:26
national anthem god
18:28
queenie mcqueen face will win by a
18:30
country mile
18:32
it would be something like it's raining
18:33
there though
18:36
um well the marseilles uh strong
18:39
candidate for
18:40
the best national anthem ever really
18:41
really exciting um
18:43
was written by a royalist the composer
18:45
was a massive royalist
18:46
and uh considering it so revolutionary
18:49
um that's a bit surprising oh really
18:51
yeah yeah he was asked to write it by
18:52
the mayor of strasbourg
18:55
can i just say a quick story about
18:56
plagiarism yes please that really
18:58
entertained me that i've never read
18:59
um it's just about a nature writer
19:02
this seems like a bit of a crowbar but i
19:04
read something written by a nature
19:06
writer called paul
19:07
thom and he visited south dakota in 2005
19:10
to write an academic article on
19:12
black-footed ferrets
19:14
he noticed a few years later that a
19:16
bodice ripper kind of raunchy book by a
19:19
writer called cassie edwards
19:20
contained verbatim his description of
19:22
black-footed ferrets
19:24
so he says she writes uh raunchy stories
19:27
about native americans having
19:29
forbidden relationships with frontiers
19:31
women oh i thought you're going to say
19:32
with ferrets
19:35
no bizarrely enough there's just a scene
19:37
where they have walt she
19:38
i've said the word warranty a lot
19:40
there's a scene where they have sex
19:42
and after they have sex they start
19:43
having a chat about ferrets
19:45
and in that chat about ferrets there's a
19:47
really incongruous
19:48
description uh academic description of
19:50
ferrets and he said
19:52
yeah it was a sudden dialogue between a
19:53
hunky american indian and a lustful
19:55
pioneer woman
19:56
which was the height of absurdity
19:59
[Music]
20:01
[Applause]
20:02
[Music]
20:02
[Applause]
20:04
okay on to fact number three and that is
20:06
andy's facts
20:08
my fact is that crows can bear a grudge
20:09
for nine years and two generations
20:12
fantastic what have you done to these
20:14
crows ending
20:15
uh there's a crow i know called inigo
20:18
montoya and i killed his father
20:22
is that a reference to something i don't
20:24
get the princess bride
20:27
um so okay so this is uh from a book
20:29
that's just out it's called the genius
20:31
of birds it's by jennifer ackerman and
20:33
it is a fantastic
20:34
book um so basically crows can remember
20:36
a face
20:37
okay they can remember a load of faces
20:39
and they can teach their offspring and
20:41
their friends
20:41
to dislike you as well why do they do
20:44
that though
20:46
basically a load of scientists put on
20:47
masks and then
20:49
bothered crows basically and they you
20:52
know they captured them or
20:53
i mean they used the word abducted some
20:55
in some write-ups of this but they just
20:57
sort of captured them and then released
20:58
them um wearing a particular mask so
21:00
they had a caveman mask one of these
21:02
experiments
21:03
um and then when they were released the
21:05
birds remembered which kind of face had
21:07
treated them badly or which kind of face
21:08
had treated them well or fed them
21:10
and then they would dive bomb the
21:12
threatening masks
21:14
and then they left it for in some cases
21:16
up to nine years
21:17
and the mobbing still happened the birds
21:20
had remembered from
21:20
years and years previously and other
21:22
birds which had not hatched at the time
21:24
of the original attacks were taught to
21:26
join in this mobbing
21:28
and then when they saw you there after
21:30
they would mob you because they knew
21:32
because they asked why were they wearing
21:33
masks is it because they didn't want the
21:35
crows to hate their normal faces
21:37
i think it was because they're on the
21:38
university campus and you can't just
21:40
teach all birds on the camera
21:43
it's because they were worried that if
21:44
they didn't have marks could be
21:46
something in their facial expressions
21:47
their birds were reacting to as if it's
21:48
a mask
21:49
it was sort of controlled for each time
21:51
it's not like there was an old scientist
21:53
who once did this experiment and then
21:54
all the birds in the whole world hated
21:56
him
21:58
i'd rather have to wear a mask when i
22:00
was doing the bird experiment than have
22:01
to wear a mask at all
22:02
other times all other times but this is
22:05
a study one thing that they did when
22:06
they were wearing masks i think i don't
22:08
know if they were real ones or um
22:09
a replica they carry what look like a
22:11
dead crow to sort of taunt the crows and
22:13
then they'd be like that's a bad person
22:15
and they've killed a crow
22:16
they also did it with pigeons and
22:17
pigeons could not care less they
22:19
had a dead pigeon they didn't look they
22:21
didn't do anything
22:22
so crow's empathetic pigeons i'll let
22:25
you go that's fantastic
22:27
well they are very advanced crows aren't
22:29
they and so corvids are my favorite type
22:31
of bird by a long way because they're
22:34
sorry it's just funny to have a favorite
22:36
type of bird
22:37
better than hummingbirds they're pretty
22:38
cool does it you don't bring your
22:40
hummingbird biases in here this is a
22:42
podcast about crows if you wanted a
22:43
podcast about hummingbirds you should
22:44
have gone elsewhere
22:45
so corvids are the their family or a
22:46
genus or uh corvus eye family
22:49
like ravens ravens crows j's
22:52
magpies all birds like that and they're
22:55
much better
22:56
than parrots are at talking for instance
22:58
they can vocalize more impressively so
23:00
parrots can copy your words but they're
23:01
always speaking that parrot voice
23:03
and whereas i can imitate power voices
23:05
very well they can't imitate mine
23:07
but crows can do all the accents crows
23:10
can do all the accents actually
23:11
you know the radio show dead ringers
23:13
it's just all crows
23:16
there's a man who's trained his raven to
23:18
chant nevermore from the edgar allan poe
23:21
poem so he chants it in because he's so
23:23
good at mimicking his owner's voice in
23:24
this terrifying man's voice
23:26
uh and it's so good yeah that would give
23:28
me nightmares yeah
23:29
did edgar allan poe in life take
23:32
advantage of the fact that
23:33
his surname and the word poem are really
23:35
similar
23:36
another edgar allen poem he should have
23:39
done
23:40
i mean maybe he wouldn't have died
23:41
penniless at the age of about 40 if he'd
23:43
only had a bit of commercial mass
23:46
he had a terrible life everyone around
23:48
him died
23:49
incredibly young and yeah he was
23:51
completely blighted he made no money
23:53
from his poems and uh yeah
23:55
but if he'd have had commercial expert
23:56
andrew hunter murray with him
23:58
yeah um so one thing this is it's called
24:02
mobbing behavior basically when birds
24:04
all attack
24:05
an individual at the same time and that
24:07
birds mostly do it with birds of prey
24:09
uh so small birds will attack big birds
24:11
oh yeah um but basically they will
24:13
they will defecate or vomit on birds of
24:16
prey
24:17
so much that the bird of prey has to
24:18
leave because um they can be quite
24:20
corrosive obviously
24:21
vomit is very acidic um and the bird of
24:24
prey will have to leave because its
24:24
feathers might be
24:25
damaged i think that is very bold
24:29
i wouldn't approach a tiger for instance
24:32
and vomit on it
24:33
hoping that its fur would be eroded fast
24:36
enough
24:36
before eight years who wouldn't eat me
24:38
but you might find yourself defecating
24:42
but if your family were all with you you
24:44
might all go and vomit on the tiger
24:46
worst trip to the nosely safari path
24:48
ever
24:50
but it's a video online of otters
24:52
mobbing a crocodile i mean it is
24:53
unbelievably good
24:55
wow really yeah the otters are all
24:57
advancing on the crocodile and it's
24:59
backing away
25:00
scared from them i mean they're not
25:01
vomiting or um but they could be about
25:04
maybe but then occasionally the
25:05
crocodile snaps a bit but it's it is
25:07
losing basically but the crocodile's
25:08
aquatics if it did get vomited on sure
25:10
it could just submerge itself and then
25:11
come out i don't think the otters are
25:12
vomiting are they they're just being
25:14
aggressive they're just being aggressive
25:15
and advancing on it
25:16
and now i'm thinking about it i don't
25:18
think this has happened but it's
25:19
possible someone just reversed the tape
25:20
of a crocodile
25:22
about to eat a load of artists
25:26
pros like to pull tales of cats and
25:28
animals they like to tease them play
25:30
with what
25:30
and i read so you know that trick you do
25:32
and you have somebody you see somebody
25:33
and you tap them on the shoulder but
25:34
you're actually on there on the side
25:35
because you've reached rounds jack does
25:36
do that to rooks
25:37
so jack does think up to a rook and pull
25:39
its tail and another jack does on the
25:41
other side were going to steal whatever
25:42
the
25:42
uh rook was eating no way yeah it's like
25:44
a distraction like a two-man con
25:46
so one taps there and another one's like
25:48
yes dinner
25:49
that's great they're so clever yeah um
25:53
when crews hide their food so they hide
25:55
it in the ground and they also remember
25:57
where they hid it but also remember how
25:58
long that food has before it goes bad so
26:00
they won't bother going back to food
26:01
that's gone bad
26:02
no yeah and also similar to the um
26:05
ravens they
26:06
if crows have crows they're friends with
26:08
her around they're fine if a crew who
26:09
they don't like is in the area they'll
26:10
go back and then hide it somewhere else
26:12
later
26:12
because they've been observed yeah well
26:14
hummingbirds can fly backwards so
26:17
james will you drop this insane
26:19
hummingbird fixation of yours
26:21
i read an article on atlas obscura
26:24
talking about
26:25
crow brains it was a bit weird they
26:28
asked um can they fall in love and the
26:31
scientist said
26:32
we don't and probably can't know if they
26:34
fall in love
26:35
but we like to consider it it's quite
26:37
nice and then the article goes on
26:40
just for good measure we asked whether
26:41
given a machine designed specifically
26:43
for the purpose a crow could drive a car
26:48
to which the scientist said i have no
26:49
idea
26:51
i think probably i have an idea that
26:53
they probably they can't even reach that
26:54
well did you see that stroke uh what was
26:56
it called
26:57
when dogs like can dogs fly a plane or
26:59
something that was on recently
27:00
and could they well they claimed it was
27:02
flying the plane i think the dog was
27:03
just sitting in a seat
27:04
i saw that there was a co-pilot it was a
27:08
i mean you'd be mad to send sensitive
27:11
cameras and stuff
27:12
expensive filming equipment with an
27:14
unaccompanied dachshund
27:16
on a 7472 in vanessa
27:28
[Laughter]
27:30
so actually just going back to that what
27:32
actually happened on this tv show
27:33
i can't remember the guy the guy the
27:35
pilot took the map and then they handed
27:36
over control to the dog and there was
27:38
like
27:38
there was a trainer behind the dock i
27:40
think what it was the dog had it
27:42
had her paws were kind of through the
27:44
joystick is it a joystick
27:45
whatever steers the plane the dog had
27:47
that i think it made some turns but if
27:49
there's someone next to them and they
27:50
were
27:51
so they started training what to do i
27:52
think crosstalk would have a better
27:53
chance because
27:54
actually anyways absolutely and because
27:57
they can talk they can make the
27:59
announcements um comprehensibly what if
28:01
it was a crow and you didn't know
28:03
would you be angry or thrilled if the
28:04
big reveal at the end of your 747 flight
28:07
was a crow coming out of the cockpit and
28:08
going
28:09
surprised i'd be a bit of both i think
28:11
yeah i'd be
28:12
i'd be surprised
28:16
yeah james just staggered that the
28:17
hummingbird hadn't done it
28:19
why are we flying backwards all the way
28:23
i just wanted to say one thing about
28:24
grudges okay uh it's just quite not now
28:26
anna not now
28:28
let's talk about it after the recording
28:29
ends andy was my last biscuit
28:33
it was four years ago men are more
28:36
vengeful than women
28:37
um we'll see about that
28:44
that's the fact that's just my fact no
28:45
there was a study done saying men bear
28:47
grudges more um
28:48
and they are they aren't as good at
28:49
forgiving people when they've been
28:50
wronged until
28:52
you explain to them how they might have
28:55
also done that
28:56
in words of one syllable exactly
28:59
so it seems bizarre it seems like when
29:01
you show men how to empathize then they
29:03
do
29:03
forgive as easily as women so in this
29:05
study the women who
29:07
remembered their wrongs were no more
29:09
likely to forgive those wrongs when he
29:11
reminded women that they had also
29:12
wronged people
29:14
but the men became much more likely to
29:15
forgive people who'd wronged them when
29:17
you reminded them
29:18
oh but didn't you do this person wrong
29:20
so it's just men need that little extra
29:22
reminder
29:22
they're like simple crows aren't women
29:25
of the hummingbirds to the male raven
29:28
[Music]
29:29
[Applause]
29:30
[Music]
29:31
[Applause]
29:32
let's move on to the final fact and that
29:35
is my fact
29:35
my fact is that in 1959 the man who set
29:38
the record time for swimming the panama
29:40
canal
29:41
was declared an honorary ship by the
29:43
panama canal authority
29:44
that's clearly amazing although on the
29:46
way back he did have to carry a load of
29:48
450 cotton bales
29:52
this is a guy called uh captain robert
29:54
leg
29:56
good old bob leg with his bob leg with
30:00
his bobbing legs they called him as he
30:02
swam by
30:03
and he made the journey in 1958 in 21
30:06
hours and 54 minutes which is pretty
30:08
fast to swim the 77 kilometers of the
30:10
panama canal
30:11
and yeah the next year the governor of
30:14
the panama canal authority
30:16
mr william potter presented him with a
30:18
certificate which
30:19
uh announced that he was an honorary
30:21
ship an honorary vessel
30:23
in recognition of his achievement that's
30:24
great i like that if you work hard you
30:26
could become anything
30:28
[Laughter]
30:30
yeah when he was a kid they probably
30:31
said little bobby leg
30:33
what do you want to be when you grow up
30:34
he's like i want to be a ship
30:36
you dreamers yeah well can you be a bit
30:39
more realistic please mommy
30:41
you'll be an accountant that's fantastic
30:45
it is good another thing i liked is that
30:47
people who attempted to swim the panic
30:48
my canal were treated
30:50
like ships in another sense which is
30:51
that they had to pay
30:53
tolls as they went through the locks and
30:54
they were weight-based tolls so they had
30:56
to be weighed
30:57
and sized up to work out how much they
31:00
had to pay
31:01
and so bob leg had to pay 72 cents for
31:04
each
31:04
each lock crossing which was actually
31:06
the weight of a one ton vessel
31:08
but the first man who swam it paid 35
31:11
cents i think
31:12
um because he was only a he was declared
31:14
a small proportion of a one-time vessel
31:16
i have 36 cents on my file i don't know
31:19
which one's right um he was called
31:21
he was called richard halliburton yes i
31:24
love richard halliburton so much so um
31:27
he was an amazing guy he well he
31:29
disappeared in 1939
31:31
we assume he died i mean he's probably
31:33
dead now but uh he crossed the alps by
31:36
elephant
31:36
he descended into the mayan well of
31:40
death he's an amazing guy he flew a
31:42
biplane over the taj mahal
31:44
upside down that's fantastic can i ask
31:46
what the mayan well of death is
31:48
you can ask james
31:51
if i'd have read that that would be the
31:52
first thing i googled
31:54
i wasn't curious um
31:57
the mayan well of death is a maya sort
32:00
of sacred well
32:01
in uh i think it's in colombia and um
32:04
yeah lots of so lots of people have
32:05
fallen in there and died and things but
32:07
not halliburton yeah he wasn't
32:09
unbelievable and he wrote these
32:10
newspaper columns and books all about
32:12
his adventures all over the world and
32:13
there was quite a lot of embellishment
32:14
in them so
32:15
you know some things need a pinch of
32:17
salt but he he swam the panama i think
32:19
he was the first one to do it yeah
32:21
he was the first one to do it going
32:22
through all the locks as well because
32:24
the first
32:24
the first people to actually swim from
32:26
one end to the other were two people who
32:28
worked on the canal because they thought
32:30
the honour of swimming it should go to
32:31
people who worked on it
32:32
and um they because they worked on the
32:35
canal six days a week they could only
32:36
swim it on sundays and so it took them
32:38
quite a long time
32:39
in stages yeah i like this headline from
32:43
when halliburton swam the canal
32:45
in so it was 1928 when he did it and i
32:47
just read a headline from the time which
32:49
is
32:50
alligators annoy author swimming panama
32:52
canal
32:54
and i just thought i think that was the
32:55
wrong way around like he's the one who's
32:57
in their canal
32:59
he should have brought some otters to
33:00
scare off um so about the prices that
33:03
you have to pay
33:05
the most that anyone's ever paid is a
33:06
cruise ship called the norwegian pearl
33:09
and they paid 375 600 us dollars
33:13
to go through wow are you paid by birth
33:15
by the number of people you can carry
33:18
and there's a thing called priority
33:20
passage so
33:21
if there's a queue quite often there's a
33:23
queue of a load of ships waiting
33:25
there was one time there was a seven day
33:27
delay and 90 ship
33:28
queue waiting and these people paid kind
33:32
of bit
33:32
extra money so they could kind of jump
33:34
the queue and they pay 220
33:37
hundred dollars and it would normally
33:38
have been thirteen thousand four hundred
33:40
and thirty wow they really wanted to get
33:42
their
33:42
wares over yeah i know but that's isn't
33:45
it great though can you imagine sort of
33:46
getting there and there's ninety ships
33:48
ahead of you
33:49
i don't know how they would overtake
33:51
each other though
33:52
because they are huge aren't they
33:53
they're made to uh the ships that go
33:55
down the panama canal are often made
33:57
specifically in order to fit through the
33:59
canal and the the technical term for
34:00
them is panamax
34:01
which is the maximum width you can be in
34:03
order to get through and they look
34:04
ridiculous so is it panama with an x at
34:07
the end panamax
34:08
you've got it you've got it if only
34:10
edgar allan poe had that kind of
34:12
forward thinking um do you want to hear
34:15
my favorite canal facts
34:16
yeah in 1978 there was a british british
34:20
waterways um group were out cleaning out
34:22
the canal dredging it and they pulled
34:23
out a chain with a bit of wood on the
34:25
end and it was a plug and they drained
34:26
the chesterfield canal
34:28
oh no oh my god
34:34
and i thought that can't be true and i
34:37
was googling it and then it has as i
34:38
found a thing with um the guy who did it
34:40
was called bill thorpe
34:41
and his aunt told the story and said
34:43
that bill couldn't believe it
34:44
and the canal trust said that every
34:45
canal has some sort of drainage system
34:47
that's how they're maintained
34:48
so you can drain a canal and it gets
34:50
better because i thought this is amazing
34:52
and i found in 2009 there's an aqueduct
34:54
near wrexham and it needs to be drained
34:56
for
34:56
um inspection to see how it was all
34:58
doing and so a 10 year old boy won the
35:00
chance to pull the plug in the
35:01
competition
35:02
oh they let him drain that's fine the
35:04
entire
35:05
aqueduct really a canal can be drained
35:08
by
35:08
the 10 year old 10 year old little
35:10
weakling this is the aqueduct
35:12
so it released 1.5 million liters of
35:14
water in the aqueduct um
35:16
and he said it wasn't actually that hard
35:18
to do wow and it's really cool the
35:20
drainage
35:20
product it is cool i want to do that
35:22
yeah right
35:24
you know there was a there was a phase
35:25
in canals
35:27
between when we decided that having
35:29
mules pull our pull our
35:30
um things along the water wasn't gonna
35:32
work and between that phase and when we
35:34
came up with diesel
35:35
there was a phase when canal boats were
35:37
supposed to be electrically powered and
35:39
there are quite a lot
35:40
built especially in germany and france
35:42
and belgium i think and a few in america
35:44
which had cables running along the top
35:46
of them
35:46
so it was like electricity lines and the
35:48
canal boats would be connected to the
35:49
electricity lines above them
35:50
and then be carried along like that
35:52
that's cool very dangerous
35:54
yeah water and electricity yeah and you
35:56
in the middle of it your hands on the
35:58
tiller
35:59
there's still one left it's the straussy
36:01
ferry in germany
36:02
if you want to visit they look really
36:04
cool that's amazing wow
36:05
so when they obviously they used to have
36:06
horses pulling them along the banks and
36:08
then
36:08
obviously that's a problem when you get
36:10
to the tunnel because you can't just
36:11
shove the horse in the canal and make it
36:12
go along inside the tunnel
36:13
so they had men called leggers and what
36:15
you would do you would lie
36:16
on top of the boat and you would stick
36:18
your legs into the air and you would use
36:19
that to slowly push
36:21
uh against you'd sort of upside down
36:24
walk the canal boat along through the
36:26
tunnel
36:26
that's so cool it's really interesting
36:28
so he's loving him but called the saucy
36:29
jane family and that was the name of the
36:30
canal saucy james
36:32
it was the family canal holiday um
36:35
and at some point they sent the horse
36:37
over the hill because they're going
36:38
through tunnels they didn't explain how
36:39
the book carried on moving which is
36:40
really nice
36:41
so now i know someone on the top was
36:42
pedaling against the ceiling yeah that's
36:44
so cool
36:45
saucy jane lay on her back with her legs
36:47
in the air
36:49
stop my childhood
36:57

00:00
[Music]
00:10
hello
00:11
and welcome to another episode of no
00:13
such thing as a fish
00:14
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
00:16
qi offices in covent garden my name is
00:18
dan schreiber i'm sitting here with anna
00:20
chazinski
00:21
alex bell and james harkin and once
00:24
again we have gathered around the
00:25
microphones with our four favorite facts
00:27
from the last seven days
00:28
and in no particular order here we go
00:31
starting with you
00:32
jazinski my fact this week is that the
00:35
first performance enhancing drug to be
00:37
used in baseball
00:38
was pulverized guinea pig testicles
00:42
polarized is such a scary word
00:45
testicles would you prefer them whole
00:46
though i don't know just the word
00:49
i pulverized them i know i know they
00:52
should have just gone with crushed it's
00:53
too many
00:54
syllables yeah so yeah the baseball
00:56
player in question
00:58
was james galvin who was known as james
01:00
pud galvin because i think
01:02
he squashed everyone like puddings maybe
01:04
oh not that he used to put
01:06
testicles in his body and not it wasn't
01:08
that no because the pudding testicles in
01:10
his body actually came after the
01:11
nickname
01:12
um so he was recruited by this
01:15
incredible doctor called charles edward
01:17
brown sicard
01:18
who had come up with this idea and said
01:22
that he tried it on himself and it had
01:23
worked that ground up guinea pigs
01:26
testicles or dog testicles mixed with
01:28
blood
01:29
and injected into into a person
01:32
could reverse the aging process and make
01:34
someone fitter and healthier
01:36
and so this baseball player had these
01:38
testicles injected into himself
01:40
and lo and behold it absolutely smashed
01:41
the next game he played really yeah did
01:43
they pick the guinea pig
01:44
because just of that scientific thing of
01:46
a guinea pig as in
01:47
it's just like that's a thing that you
01:49
use yeah but that's why they used it is
01:51
because it's a thing that you use
01:52
you're kidding they actually use guinea
01:53
pigs when they say it's a guinea pig
01:55
they used to i think today it's
01:56
it's less than one percent of uh
01:58
experiments are done on guinea pigs but
01:59
it's just
02:00
you know because some are done on guinea
02:01
pigs today it's very rare it's mostly
02:03
rats and mice
02:04
right but at the start of the 20th
02:06
century mostly it was
02:08
guinea pigs and a lot of nobel prizes
02:09
were won by guinea pigs
02:11
yes and they're erroneously claimed by
02:13
humans yes exactly they didn't they
02:14
never got the medals so there was no
02:16
tiny podium on the right
02:18
no that would be cool but this guy what
02:20
about this guy
02:21
this doctor is so great so he was one of
02:23
uh the world's true eccentrics uh he was
02:26
a doctor in the 19th century he was a
02:28
very well-respected doctor which is why
02:29
this treatment was actually taken quite
02:31
seriously by some people
02:33
and it was sold a lot around the country
02:36
because he
02:36
is the father of endocrinology i think
02:39
people often say
02:40
uh what's an endocrinologist oh it's the
02:42
study of hormones ah okay
02:44
um but he also did some pretty wacky
02:46
things
02:47
so as well as doing this he um there was
02:50
a cholera outbreak in 1853
02:52
and he had a new potential cholera
02:54
treatment he wanted to try and so
02:56
he swallowed the vomit of one of his
02:58
cholera patients in order to contract
02:59
the disease so that he could test out
03:01
the potential cure on himself oh my god
03:03
one of those guys
03:04
yeah one of those guys it's a good like
03:06
it'll give you a good work ethic
03:07
if you give yourself the disease that
03:09
you then like you've got a time limit
03:11
oh yeah yeah it's literally a deadline
03:13
it's literally a deadline you're right i
03:14
like the way that this guy is one of the
03:16
eccentrics of that era
03:18
because these days to be an eccentric
03:19
you just have to like grow a beard and
03:20
wear a hat
03:21
yeah and like no socks yeah in those
03:23
days you used to kind of inject
03:24
testicles into yourself yeah
03:26
and swallow other people's vomit i think
03:28
you trust your doctor who is willing to
03:30
experiment with their cures on
03:31
themselves
03:32
first would you if he walks into your gp
03:35
and he's just finishing off a pint of
03:36
vomit
03:37
are you gonna go great i feel really
03:39
reassured now
03:40
yes i'd recommend him to my friends
03:45
another thing he did he was into
03:46
testicles he ate monkey testicles
03:49
uh browns a card to enhance his sexual
03:51
prowess
03:52
which he said worked very well and
03:53
actually the so the ground up
03:55
guinea pig testicles that he injected
03:58
into himself he said they had a number
03:59
of different effects so he could lift
04:01
much heavier weights
04:02
he could run up and down stairs and he
04:04
was 72 by this age so he was barely
04:06
mobile until he started injecting
04:08
himself
04:08
but also he said the average length of
04:10
his urine jet had increased by 25
04:12
percent
04:13
and it gave him a greater improvement
04:15
with regard to the expulsion of fecal
04:17
matters
04:18
than in any other function say that
04:19
again gave him he could a long way
04:22
a long way not not the speed of
04:24
coming out of him it was distance
04:26
he said improvement so it's really kind
04:28
of left to us okay there's a bit
04:30
of ambiguous i'm picturing the poster of
04:32
deep impact
04:33
[Laughter]
04:35
oh yeah what a guy though yeah yeah he
04:37
sounds incredible so
04:38
is there any evidence that any of the
04:40
testicles he was injecting into himself
04:42
worked well they had a placebo effect
04:44
certainly i mean genuinely this baseball
04:46
player's
04:47
game was enormously improved so i read a
04:50
review of the game afterwards
04:52
and i didn't understand any of it but i
04:54
got the strong impression that it was
04:55
unbelievably good
04:56
his bat was full of vitality that was
04:58
the only sentence i understood
05:00
these days you take viagra for that yeah
05:02
[Laughter]
05:04
what it was is that he thought the
05:06
reason that he put testicles in himself
05:09
is because he thought that it was like a
05:11
lack of vitality that he had
05:13
and because they'd found they'd kind of
05:15
noticed that eunuchs
05:16
and people who regularly masturbated
05:18
were quite frail when they were older
05:21
and so the idea was you got rid of a lot
05:23
of some kind of substance in your body
05:25
um through that and so the way to get it
05:27
back is to to find some
05:29
guinea pigs and castrate them but listen
05:31
up 13 year old boys if you don't want to
05:33
be doing that you've got to stop
05:34
masturbating because you'll be frail
05:36
when you're older according to james
05:37
yeah
05:38
um so the idea of uh testicles
05:42
and sport uh is not as it goes way
05:45
further back than
05:46
this old baseball what do you mean by
05:49
that i mean that uh in the
05:51
original ancient olympics um that was
05:53
kind of the their equivalent of
05:55
doping scandals that they used to chew
05:57
raw testicles
06:00
lamb lamb testicles yeah they would chew
06:03
it before
06:04
any of their races right yeah supposedly
06:06
um
06:07
i think uh pliny recommended it didn't
06:09
he did it oh well
06:10
yeah classic why you know it was wrong
06:12
yeah clint is the only one that if
06:14
someone was like if pliny told you to
06:16
walk off a cliff would you do it you'd
06:17
be like well yes
06:18
i mean he's he's also told me to eat
06:20
testicles and he's got so much weird
06:22
that he says it's something that no
06:23
one called him out in his own lifetime
06:25
and it took like two thousand years for
06:26
someone to say i call
06:27
or everything you've ever said yeah but
06:30
no so they used to uh they used to chew
06:31
testicles yeah
06:33
in ancient olympic times i didn't know
06:35
that yeah
06:36
yeah yeah pulling on other people's
06:38
testicles was an illegal move in
06:39
wrestling as it is today i imagine
06:42
i think it was easier to do than because
06:43
they weren't wearing as much yeah
06:46
i would imagine it would be definitely a
06:48
move i went for if it wasn't against the
06:49
rules
06:53
that's why i'm always losing matches i
06:55
spent my whole time searching
06:57
down there it must be here somewhere
07:00
i read it in plenty
07:05
can i yeah sorry well i was just going
07:06
to say that just sticking with the
07:07
ancients and testicles quickly i was
07:09
reading about
07:10
some other ancient testicles assyrian
07:12
testicles and
07:14
um apparently it was a criminal act to
07:16
damage a man's testicles
07:18
so if uh still it still is i think well
07:21
no but the punishment was
07:23
more severe i think if you kick someone
07:25
in the balls these days you'd get in
07:26
trouble but
07:28
if you were if you were a woman and you
07:29
crushed a man's testicles back in
07:31
ancient assyria
07:32
uh you would have either the your finger
07:34
cut off
07:35
so assuming that the finger was what was
07:37
doing the uh the crushing of the man's
07:38
testicles
07:39
and then this was another thing that
07:40
would happen both of your nipples would
07:42
be torn off
07:44
oh torn makes itself you're just getting
07:48
your hands around it and ripping it
07:49
exactly does that sound terrible um do
07:52
you know
07:53
in ireland in ancient ireland whenever
07:56
there was a king then
07:58
when he became king they had to kind of
08:01
kiss his
08:01
nipples or something and so to stop
08:03
someone from ever being king you would
08:05
tear off their nipples
08:07
and they used to they would find
08:08
bodies with no nipples and they know
08:10
that
08:10
that's someone who's been banned from
08:12
being the king wow
08:14
yeah did do you think some people had
08:16
their nipples torn off and then ran back
08:17
to collect them later just in case they
08:19
were king they could produce them
08:21
and then you foiled the person who tore
08:22
your nipples yeah there's nowhere in the
08:24
real thing it has to be attached to the
08:25
body yeah
08:26
you can make a necklace out of them away
08:27
your nipples or a ring
08:30
ring i'm
08:33
just on advantages in sport and going
08:36
back to baseball
08:37
i was reading today that they reckon
08:40
that about 25
08:41
of major league baseball players in
08:43
america are left-handed
08:45
because we've spoken about before how uh
08:47
nadal
08:48
um was both right-handed and left-handed
08:50
but decided to be
08:51
left-handed because it gave you an
08:52
advantage yeah it does on the court
08:54
um harder to return if you're
08:56
right-handed um to a left-handed person
08:58
the same thing kind of applies to
09:00
baseball as well
09:01
because if you're batting uh the
09:03
left-handed batters have an advantage
09:05
because they're one step closer to the
09:06
first base
09:08
and it's how weird is that it's just one
09:09
step but they're one step closer a lot
09:11
of the argument about uh left-handers
09:13
having an advantage
09:14
is that you come across them less
09:16
regularly so if you're a right-hander
09:19
you'll come across a left-hander one in
09:20
10 times or whatever
09:22
and so you don't really know how to be
09:24
against them because you don't really
09:25
come across them that often
09:26
if you're a left-hander going against a
09:28
right-hander you come across them all
09:29
the time
09:30
so you're you have an advantage because
09:32
you're regularly in this
09:33
position whereas the other guy is the
09:35
other person yeah that's so interesting
09:37
in fact in 1987 i found another way that
09:40
you can cheat in baseball it doesn't
09:41
really work but
09:42
there was a pennsylvanian minor league
09:44
baseball player called dave bresnahan
09:46
um and he tagged a runner out by
09:48
switching the ball
09:49
with a peeled potato that he had hidden
09:52
in his catcher's mitt that he brought
09:53
onto the field
09:54
and he got fired the next day because
09:56
everyone immediately realized wait that
09:57
was a potato but he did win the point
09:58
and then he got taken away again
10:00
um and then he got fired and now he's a
10:01
stockbroker
10:03
so actually overall i think he won yeah
10:06
but all this money that they think he's
10:08
made it's actually just bags of potatoes
10:10
[Laughter]
10:12
that's amazing so the idea of that for
10:14
people who don't know baseball is
10:16
someone's running towards the base and
10:17
to get them out you can either touch the
10:19
base before they do or you can touch
10:21
them
10:21
before they reach the base and so
10:23
someone must have thrown the ball
10:25
he's not caught the ball and just
10:26
pretended that this potato is the ball
10:28
exactly it makes no
10:29
it makes no sense so because this is
10:31
1987
10:32
like we had cameras like the other thing
10:35
is also baseballs are readily available
10:37
so why don't you just have a baseball
10:39
here
10:40
[Laughter]
10:44
anything else before we move on a couple
10:45
of things on testicles yeah yeah
10:47
um guinea pig ejaculate is apparently
10:49
even harder to get out of your head than
10:51
doing gums
10:53
how did you learn this he was
10:55
pulverizing a testicle
10:56
flashback when all over the internet i
10:59
was on a guinea pig forum
11:02
but the first person on the forum didn't
11:03
give any extra information as to why
11:05
they had guinea pig ejaculate in their
11:06
head yeah
11:07
you said it like it was a scientific
11:08
paper this is just a bunch of mates
11:10
going
11:11
i've got i said apparently right i tell
11:14
you i do have a scientific study if you
11:16
feed yogurt to a mouse
11:17
you can make their testicles up to 15
11:20
bigger um
11:21
and they also get more luxuriant silky
11:23
hair and they develop a swagger
11:27
according to the scientists you would
11:28
develop a smarter if you had more
11:29
luxuriant
11:30
yeah yeah and bigger actually bigger
11:32
testicles i feel like it's
11:33
physically you just need to walk
11:35
differently yeah yeah put it off your
11:36
balance
11:37
yeah squirrels have 20 the length of
11:40
their body
11:41
size testicles the massive testicles
11:44
i know that that is true of some animals
11:47
but whenever i've been to
11:48
st james's park and i've seen squirrels
11:52
i think i'd have noticed if one-fifth of
11:54
their body was testicles yeah
11:56
it's true i've never seen these fables
11:58
it's cold here so they're probably
11:59
rejected
12:00
um i've found a few baseball injuries
12:03
from history oh yeah
12:04
uh this is from a website called
12:05
nitarama i'll just read a few of them
12:08
out and see if you like them
12:09
as a guy called fat freddy fitzsimmons
12:12
who smashed his fingers on his pitching
12:14
arm when he fell asleep on his rocking
12:16
chair
12:16
and rocked over his own hand whoa
12:20
is that a baseball injury well it was an
12:22
injury to a baseball player
12:24
yeah uh-huh look at different categories
12:26
go on this one's
12:27
also in the same category as the one
12:29
that i just said i suppose
12:30
uh john smoltz um he tried ironing his
12:33
shirts while he was still wearing it
12:35
uh and burned his chest and missed a
12:37
load of the season um
12:39
babe ruth famous yeah baseball player he
12:41
knocked himself unconscious once by
12:43
running headfirst into a coconut tree
12:46
that was a baseball one because he was
12:48
chasing after a ball and then the last
12:50
one
12:50
matt anderson who apparently is a
12:52
baseball player he shredded a muscle
12:54
in his right arm while throwing an
12:56
octopus
13:01
right i bet the octopus came off worse
13:04
yeah he shredded eight arms
13:06
yeah how about this the first president
13:09
of the world anti-doping agency was
13:10
called dick pound
13:13
that is brilliant
13:20
that is a great fact that's very good
13:23
[Music]
13:28
[Applause]
13:28
[Music]
13:30
okay it is time for fact number two and
13:32
that
13:33
is alex my fact this week is that there
13:36
is a power station buried inside a welsh
13:38
mountain that's only turned on during tv
13:40
advert breaks
13:44
it's called dinner wig power station
13:45
it's in north wales in
13:47
snowdonia national park and it's a
13:49
hydroelectric power station
13:51
it's called a fast response power
13:52
station in fact is the fastest in the
13:54
world it takes 12 seconds to produce
13:56
enough power to power about
13:57
600 000 kettles uh in 12 seconds so
14:01
that's like incredibly fast
14:03
you press a button and immediately
14:04
you've got that power and it's mainly
14:06
there because
14:07
obviously demand for electrical power in
14:09
the uk uh changes over time
14:11
but one of the most common reasons for a
14:12
massive increase in demand is
14:14
when a really popular tv program goes to
14:16
a commercial break okay uh so for
14:18
example
14:19
um x factor or strictly
14:22
understandable is massive wait a minute
14:24
they don't have adverts yeah
14:26
it must be the end of the show yeah
14:28
coronation street i think famously
14:30
has it doesn't matter yeah the biggest
14:32
one was a world cup penalty shootout
14:33
england versus west germany 1990 fifa
14:36
world cup
14:37
well that was that was the biggest the
14:38
biggest one ever yeah that the
14:40
kettles were turned on so yeah biggest
14:42
passage in the uk yeah yeah
14:44
we had lost that penalty shootout so it
14:46
might have been other things like people
14:47
putting their heads in the oven
14:52
for the end of eastenders we have to
14:54
borrow electricity from france do we
14:56
really and i think france would be proud
14:58
to know the noble
14:59
program they were supporting in lending
15:01
that to us i reckon if the british
15:03
probably knew they were using french
15:04
electricity they would turn off their
15:05
televisions
15:06
i reckon that at the end of eastenders
15:08
people like oh my god we're running out
15:10
of electricity
15:15
um i i found a power station that
15:18
affected tv
15:19
more than any other power station i
15:21
reckon what's that uh and i'm talking uk
15:23
uh this is 1964 and it's battersea power
15:27
station
15:28
battersea power station affected tv in a
15:30
massive way because there was a fire
15:32
there
15:32
and the fire caused uh power failures
15:35
all throughout london
15:36
uh so it affected bbc television center
15:39
now the big
15:40
thing about it was they had to change
15:41
the launch date of bbc two
15:44
to the next day because so it was meant
15:46
to launch and battery power station
15:48
ruined it so they had to launch a day
15:49
later than they were planning to
15:51
which is nuts um batteries power station
15:53
so i i was googling it today because i
15:55
passed it every morning
15:56
on the train it's it's beautiful to see
15:59
and they're redoing it up at the moment
16:01
um but uh i was i had no idea the guy
16:03
who designed it is this a well-known
16:05
fact in the uk the guy who designed it
16:07
so his name was sir giles gilbert scott
16:09
so he designed battersea power station
16:11
he also designed waterloo bridge
16:13
but he also designed the red telephone
16:16
box
16:16
did he did it yeah the uk red telephone
16:19
box anyone overseas picture a red
16:20
telephone box in your head
16:22
that's the one he designed it that kind
16:24
of upsets me because i'd much prefer it
16:26
if battery power station looked like one
16:28
giant red telephone box
16:30
you know what does it like a telephone
16:31
box his tombstone is shaped in the same
16:33
way
16:33
he's got a big sort of monumental
16:34
tombstone and you can see it looks a bit
16:36
like by design or by accident
16:38
uh i think he designed it so it's
16:40
supposed to look like that yes yeah wow
16:41
this is tombstone covered in adverts for
16:43
cool girls
16:49
just on the subject of the uh red
16:51
telephone box
16:52
um currently in wales there is a
16:54
mountain that has a red telephone box on
16:57
it
16:57
and it's not in use and they're gonna
16:59
remove it but there's been huge protests
17:01
from
17:02
local ramblers huge protests
17:04
[Laughter]
17:06
so in uh brazil recently they had 3.5
17:08
million people on the streets
17:10
yeah similar it's bigger i'm surprised
17:12
they haven't covered it
17:14
um well all the reporters are trying to
17:15
ring in yeah
17:18
yeah but um so they want to remove it
17:20
because it's redundant it's not working
17:21
anymore but everyone there is saying we
17:22
want you to keep it because
17:24
the mountain that it happens to be on uh
17:26
can be very windy
17:27
and very rainy at times and it serves as
17:30
a shelter for people who are suddenly
17:31
stuck
17:32
in torrential rain and gale force winds
17:34
yeah so
17:35
they actually say it's a lifeline for a
17:37
lot of people who may get stuck up there
17:38
so they're
17:39
they're still this is still a story uh
17:41
you know that's going on i'll keep you
17:43
all updated
17:44
um other other news in welsh mountain
17:47
news
17:47
yes please more protests up there uh so
17:49
there's 189 peaks
17:52
uh for wales and one has just been taken
17:56
off the list it's called
17:57
moluenois i that's the correct
18:00
pronunciation
18:01
um and it has it was a mountain and
18:04
they've now disqualified it they've
18:05
taken it off the list
18:06
because it doesn't meet the height
18:08
standards that you're meant to have
18:09
to be classified as a mountain but it
18:12
misses it by
18:13
a matter of millimeters really yeah
18:16
literally
18:17
yeah yeah just scoop up some more snow
18:19
and just i know you figured they could
18:20
do something that so this is what it
18:21
says
18:21
um it says the hill controversial
18:26
mountain like massive quotes
18:29
yeah so the hill in snowdonia north
18:31
wells needs at least a 15 meter height
18:33
difference between the summit and its
18:34
pass
18:35
which connects it to the next higher
18:37
hill recent tests have shown that it
18:39
misses these criteria by millimeters
18:41
measured in at 14.77 meters
18:44
it needs to be 15 in itself but that's
18:46
even easier you can just dig a hole at
18:47
the bottom right
18:48
you figure yeah but no one has maybe no
18:50
one cared enough
18:51
really i mean i mean because they're all
18:53
too busy protesting about that other
18:54
things there's only so much you can do
18:57
you know you've got to pick your battles
18:59
well there was that movie the man who
19:01
went
19:01
up a hill and came down a mountain which
19:03
is a great film it's exactly like this
19:05
isn't it where he kind of adds a bit at
19:06
the top and that's based on a true story
19:08
so chance for a sequel oh yeah exactly
19:10
but it was in wales as well i think yes
19:12
it was yeah hugh grant
19:14
in his finest performance to date
19:18
his optimist
19:19
[Laughter]
19:22
you never know he might be as dan says
19:24
when that sequel comes along
19:26
it could be amazing notting hill was
19:27
going to be notting mountain but
19:28
actually it
19:29
did miss the required height though
19:33
um yeah um that's that's that is all
19:36
from
19:37
welsh mountain news
19:40
i'll see you next week honor power
19:43
conservation i love this that i didn't
19:45
know
19:45
um which is about reusing energy so one
19:48
of the problems
19:49
is that is that we generate a lot of
19:51
electricity
19:52
uh and if there's not enough demand for
19:54
it it just gets wasted and we don't
19:56
really know how to conserve a lot of
19:57
energy and then repurpose it later on
19:59
but we have worked out how to do this on
20:01
the london underground
20:02
on the tube and this is i read this on
20:04
tfl's website and it was a press release
20:06
from last year i think so i don't know
20:08
if it's been put into action yet
20:09
but they are planning to take the energy
20:12
that is emitted from
20:14
tube underground train brakes and use it
20:17
to power london homes because it
20:18
releases so much energy
20:20
and so they did this uh pilot experiment
20:23
on the victoria line somewhere
20:24
and they realized that in one week of
20:27
getting the energy from
20:29
tube breaks and converting it into let's
20:31
say heat energy
20:32
or electrical energy you would have
20:34
enough power to power
20:35
a tube station for two days a tube
20:37
station like hoban so hobart
20:39
for instance could power itself for two
20:41
days of the week just off the energy
20:42
release from its brakes
20:43
that's insane isn't that cool it's kind
20:45
of cool that i mean earth is basically
20:47
still steam powered because
20:48
every single major way we have of
20:50
producing power is basically produce
20:52
heat in order to heat up water to make
20:53
steam and the steam
20:54
goes around pipes and drives a turbine
20:56
and so steam powered this fat was
20:57
basically an excuse to talk about the
20:59
new york steam power system
21:07
time for fact number three it's really
21:09
cool it's just that um new york
21:10
manhattan is built on a a whole network
21:13
of steam pipes so they have massive
21:15
boilers like power stations basically
21:16
but they're actually boilers that that
21:18
create huge amounts of steam
21:19
and all this steam gets pumped into the
21:21
buildings and then the buildings can use
21:22
the steam in whatever way they like so
21:24
they can generate electricity from it
21:25
using steam power generators
21:26
they can use it to heat you know power
21:28
air conditioners or they use it as
21:30
heating
21:31
they can plummet directly into their
21:32
like dishwashers and they've got steam
21:34
dishwashers that wash dishes using steam
21:36
and then they condense it it's really
21:37
really hot water
21:37
it's just really cool and that's why new
21:39
york has this image of being you've
21:40
always got steam coming up out the grate
21:42
so that's true because that's
21:43
and it's still like that and it's the
21:44
biggest system in the world and it's
21:45
just the coolest thing ever i always
21:47
just thought that was a um
21:48
for the ninja turtles so that they could
21:50
not be seen in the evening when they
21:52
came out
21:53
to attack the rock but one of the
21:55
problems is that it can explode because
21:56
it's a pressurized system so
21:58
you know i think in 2011 or seven was
22:00
one of the
22:01
um one of the most recent times when a
22:03
part of the road just exploded and lot
22:04
of steam came out because oh wow
22:06
yeah oh it's crazy wow um actually
22:08
speaking of america
22:09
yeah they just don't do kettles
22:12
which is quite weird they mostly don't
22:14
use electric kettles
22:16
and that is because they take twice as
22:17
long to boil as ours
22:19
so yeah isn't it isn't it so weird and
22:22
there's gonna be americans listening who
22:24
are confused by the fact that this isn't
22:25
just readily accepted i'm trying to
22:27
picture because i've been to america a
22:28
few times recently
22:29
you can't get kettles but generally they
22:31
don't use them and that's because their
22:33
voltage in their main systems is only
22:36
110 volts and ours is 220
22:39
so that means that kettles just boil
22:40
less fast wow isn't that weird
22:42
yeah thinking about it my wife's russian
22:45
and her family i don't think i've ever
22:46
seen them use a kettle
22:47
there you go i think they kind of just
22:49
yeah boil water on a hub i'm pretty sure
22:51
that's what until recently at least
22:52
france used to do as well they were very
22:54
much more
22:55
cattle are we the only people in the
22:56
world with kettles i think
22:58
what i was reading was a bit of a
23:00
british quirk
23:01
it sounds like we've had to build entire
23:02
power stations to deal with this quote
23:11
okay it is time for fact number three
23:13
and that is james
23:15
okay my fact this week is that 85
23:18
million years before butterflies existed
23:21
there was another animal that looked and
23:23
acted exactly the same
23:24
as butterflies what were they called
23:28
well they didn't have names oh yeah i
23:30
guess yeah oh so the difference is they
23:32
couldn't talk
23:35
no um we call them uh caligramatid
23:38
lace wings from the order neuroptera
23:42
and if you look at them they just found
23:44
some new fossils in china
23:46
and these are of things that you would
23:48
be certain they are butterflies
23:50
they've got the same wing shape they've
23:52
got the same wing spots and eye spots
23:54
they've got the same scales the same
23:56
proboscis
23:57
uh like the the long tube that they feed
23:59
with it looks like they feed in the same
24:01
way they flew in the same way every they
24:02
were basically butterflies
24:04
but they were 85 million years before
24:06
actual butterflies
24:08
wow and we're definitely sure that they
24:10
weren't just butterflies
24:14
are they from a different line they're
24:15
not they're not related at all well they
24:17
were
24:18
insects so they're related slightly but
24:20
also there's a massive period between
24:21
them and actual butterflies it's not an
24:22
obvious link
24:23
so we have an idea of when true
24:25
butterflies came in and this was a lot
24:27
before that
24:27
but this is interesting because if
24:28
theoretically you had two completely
24:30
identical animals that evolved
24:31
separately
24:32
do we still have to classify them as
24:34
separate species now that is
24:35
really interesting they found a load of
24:38
mussels in
24:39
around britain a few years ago and
24:42
they found some in the north sea and
24:44
some down near bristol and some down
24:46
on the south coast and they all look
24:47
like muscles because
24:49
i don't want to be muscle racist but all
24:50
muscles kind of look the same
24:52
but then they did dna tests on them and
24:54
they were all completely different
24:55
species like they couldn't mate with one
24:57
another we think
24:58
wow but we would never know that they
25:00
were different animals because they just
25:01
look exactly the same
25:02
so we'd be trying to force them to have
25:04
sex and they would be like well we don't
25:05
really do that but
25:06
we've got a beach holidays
25:10
so but that i mean isn't it interest
25:12
isn't that interesting it's so weird
25:13
because
25:14
so it's convergence basically isn't it
25:16
where um
25:17
evolutionarily two things develop
25:19
independent of each other that are
25:20
exactly the same
25:21
but when you look at a butterfly i think
25:24
that's gonna die out soon because it's a
25:25
tiny flimsy piece of tissue paper
25:27
that practically dies if i touch it um
25:30
and yeah i decided to evolve twice
25:32
why are you touching butterflies that's
25:34
just what i'm into on the weekends she's
25:35
trying to force them to have sex
25:38
um that is interesting i guess i suppose
25:40
whatever niche they live in it must be
25:42
perfect for them
25:43
yeah yeah yeah also they don't die if
25:46
you touch them i just want to clarify
25:47
that i do know that in case anyone
25:48
writes in don't you um don't the wing
25:50
scales fall off
25:51
some of them do but it doesn't kill them
25:53
yet isn't it cool they have scales
25:55
though
25:55
like isn't that really weird that's
25:56
amazing yeah um just on the subject of
25:58
butterfly death
25:59
i read an article which uh it starts uh
26:04
this line is included right at the top
26:05
hundreds of butterflies were killed in a
26:07
celebration that transformed quickly
26:09
into a traumatic bloodbath
26:11
um now this is the story of furniture
26:14
shop this is in china
26:15
decided that they would do an event um
26:18
it says here um
26:19
the event would be remembered as a happy
26:21
occasion for their business
26:22
but they were wrong uh and so wrong were
26:26
they
26:26
they were seriously wrong they opened up
26:28
uh the idea was that they had all these
26:30
butterflies held in boxes
26:32
and they were gonna release the
26:33
butterflies onto the ground and
26:36
children were gonna run towards the
26:37
butterflies and as they were running the
26:39
butterflies would fly away creating a
26:40
great effect so it was for children just
26:42
to chase the butterfly
26:43
what they didn't count on is the fact
26:45
that the butterflies
26:46
uh were in lethargic form i don't know
26:49
what that means but it sounds like
26:50
they're lazy yeah they were tired so
26:51
basically
26:53
they're there laying on the floor all
26:54
lethargic while a stampede of children
26:57
come towards them thinking they're going
26:58
to fly away and they just crushed the
27:01
entire back
27:02
i've got another story you know you know
27:03
what debutante balls aren't only like
27:05
wealthy families
27:06
when the like the daughter of the family
27:08
came of age they'd have a sort of coming
27:09
out party
27:10
oh yeah it'd be a big kind of thing this
27:11
happened in 1906 there was a
27:12
philadelphia woman called
27:14
mary astor paul and she had 10 000
27:16
brazilian butterflies imported into her
27:18
house and hung in nets all over the
27:20
ceiling of the ballroom
27:21
but when the nets were dropped at the
27:23
end of the party it turned out all the
27:24
butterflies had died due to the heat so
27:26
the guests were just showered with
27:27
thousands of dead
27:30
so funny which would be kind of
27:32
beautiful anyway
27:33
it's confetti what the thousands of
27:34
people running away screaming
27:36
would you scream i mean i know you've
27:38
been mostly i know you power when
27:39
someone tries to high-five you but would
27:40
you just run away screaming because
27:42
you dead butterflies i mean ten thousand
27:44
in one room
27:45
yeah um i think that one of the really
27:48
nice things about transforming from a
27:49
caterpillar to a butterfly
27:51
is that you stop pooing i think that's
27:54
quite cool
27:55
so caterpillars defecate all the time uh
27:58
as you know as a lot of creatures do
28:00
they eat a lot and they defecate a lot
28:02
but butterflies they don't really eat
28:03
they sort of drink liquid through their
28:05
proboscis that james mentioned earlier
28:08
but they just drink enough liquid to
28:09
power themselves occasionally if they've
28:11
drunk too much
28:12
they release a very fine mist of water
28:14
from their abdomen
28:15
but mainly they don't really excrete at
28:17
all so you go from being a caterpillar
28:18
to a butterfly and you mature
28:20
into not pooing anymore what they need
28:22
is some guinea pig testicles and they'll
28:24
be firing it out like billy
28:25
[Laughter]
28:27
so they don't drink uh with their tongue
28:30
as in like it passes over that drink
28:31
through their tongue their tongue is a
28:33
straw
28:34
there's a hole in their tongue and they
28:35
slurp the stuff up that's cool isn't
28:37
that awesome
28:38
there are some species that do this
28:39
thing called mud puddling which is less
28:41
like drinking and it's more like you
28:42
drink any liquid find any liquid you can
28:43
so like blood or like muddy water and
28:45
stuff like that and you basically filter
28:46
the water so it goes straight through
28:48
you and it comes straight out of the
28:48
other end as they're drinking
28:50
and they filter all the nutrients um but
28:52
there are there is one species of moth
28:53
there's not a butterfly it's a moth but
28:55
they sneak up to sleeping birds and
28:57
stick their proboscis
28:58
through their closed eyelids and drink
29:00
their tears yeah so
29:01
how cool is that yeah yeah but why are
29:04
the birds so sad
29:07
they could be tears of happiness tears
29:09
of joy that they've got a beautiful
29:10
butterfly they do it to um
29:12
they do it to crocodiles and turtles as
29:13
well yeah and humans they can drink
29:14
there is this thing called vampire moth
29:16
because
29:16
um you know it's got a reputation for
29:18
drinking blood from a human
29:20
i like the fact that they have uh when
29:22
they when they crowd around puddles to
29:24
drink which they do
29:25
they're called puddle clubs and if
29:27
you're a butterfly watcher butterfly
29:29
fan then you go you go to poddle clubs
29:31
or you set up a puddle club in your
29:33
garden and they'll flock around it wow
29:34
that sounds like a series of books for
29:36
teenage girls the puddle
29:37
club yeah it sounds like a load of books
29:40
for incontinent
29:41
old men
29:45
um speaking of butterfly collecting
29:47
which i don't know but it
29:49
feels like people don't really do that
29:50
much anymore um in the
29:52
television james um in the early 1700's
29:56
butterfly collector
29:57
lady eleanor glanville was declared
29:59
insane
30:01
due to her butterfly collecting and um
30:04
an entomologist testified that none but
30:06
those deprived of their senses
30:08
would go in pursuit of butterflies oh
30:11
wow what
30:12
it's not because they were like yeah we
30:13
went to her house for dinner and she
30:15
dropped 10
30:15
000.
30:19
it kind of feels like they were looking
30:21
for an excuse to declare her insane but
30:23
that's what they did
30:24
wow wow someone else actually who was
30:26
declared insane on a butterfly related
30:29
charge what are the chances who would
30:32
have thought was very common in the
30:33
victorian era
30:35
this was someone who darwin met on the
30:36
beagle voyage and he noted down
30:38
uh his conversation he had with him in
30:40
his diary
30:41
and it was a guy called ranaus who was a
30:44
naturalist and collector
30:46
and he related a story to darwin that he
30:49
had left some caterpillars in the charge
30:51
of a little girl
30:52
and instructed her on how to feed them
30:55
so that they'd turn into butterflies
30:56
um and he'd and so this girl had done
31:00
this and she'd fed the caterpillars and
31:01
they turned into butterflies and by this
31:02
point he'd left town and he came back to
31:04
town and rumor had spread
31:06
that he'd left these caterpillars in the
31:07
charge of this girl promising that they
31:09
turn into butterflies
31:10
and people thought that that was absurd
31:14
that those butterflies could have come
31:16
from caterpillars
31:17
because they didn't realize that about
31:19
metamorphosis and the butterflies would
31:20
come from caterpillars
31:21
and so there was a town meeting and
31:24
eventually the
31:25
governors and the padres of the town
31:27
consulted and they agreed that it was
31:28
heresy and he had to be arrested
31:30
so he was arrested for telling a girl
31:32
that a caterpillar would become a
31:33
butterfly
31:34
wow isn't that weird yeah because like i
31:36
mean they're so unbelievably different
31:37
as we've discussed before they sort of
31:39
melt before they become butterflies
31:41
yeah that people just didn't think it
31:42
was possible that they were related
31:44
it is absolutely bizarre isn't it when
31:46
you think about that yeah it is
31:47
bizarre i think it's magic i've said
31:49
this since we've all known each other
31:51
it's the fact that in between the
31:53
process they turn
31:54
into a soup there's just a soup and then
31:57
they come back and then they retain
31:59
memory
31:59
yeah yeah of their previous existence
32:01
that's that they do have wizards
32:03
like organs floating in it because i
32:04
thought for ages that it was just total
32:06
liquid but actually
32:07
it's like kind of if we were able to
32:08
just melt all our actual flesh
32:10
they've got these things called imaginal
32:11
discs which i think like it's like lots
32:13
of little flash drives and like ones for
32:15
the eyes and ones for the wings and ones
32:16
for the legs and they're all floating in
32:18
this soup
32:18
and one of them's you know got all the
32:19
neurons in it for the brain and stuff
32:21
it's great
32:21
wow they're like the baddie and
32:23
terminator too that's what they're like
32:25
they can just go into liquid form and
32:26
just come back actually on
32:28
have you read the scientific paper by
32:30
donald williamson that was released in
32:31
2012
32:32
i know that sounds like a ridiculous
32:34
question to me it sounds likely that i
32:36
would have been
32:37
i'm sure you have it was unbelievably
32:39
controversial but it was published in
32:40
the proceedings of
32:41
the national academy of sciences so it's
32:42
super prestigious and he believes that
32:45
butterflies and caterpillars are
32:46
different species yes
32:48
there you go and he's read it uh yeah
32:50
because it caused a massive stir
32:51
so he's a genuine scientist who said
32:53
that actually two different species
32:55
mated
32:56
and produced this offspring at some
32:58
point you know hundreds of thousands of
32:59
years ago and that's the only way that
33:00
they could exist and a butterfly
33:02
is a different species to a caterpillar
33:03
so that different organisms
33:05
it becomes a new organism wow and then
33:07
he got um
33:08
he got roundly criticized by all of
33:11
scientists really
33:12
[Music]
33:16
okay it is time for our final fact of
33:18
the show and that is my fact
33:20
my fact this week is that the long quan
33:22
buddhist temple in china
33:24
has a monk called worthy stupid robot
33:27
monk
33:28
so so okay it's uh it's not a human monk
33:32
it is actually as it says in the title a
33:34
robot monk
33:34
they have developed at this um buddhist
33:37
temple
33:38
a monk that specific job is for when
33:41
tourists come
33:42
and want to chat to people they go talk
33:44
to the robot monk and he'll answer your
33:46
questions about
33:47
what is the meaning of life and all
33:48
those other things
33:50
um he's programmed to give you answers
33:52
and he's basically just their pr person
33:54
when uh people come because they might
33:56
be busy doing monk stuff
33:57
so i'd be quite disappointed if i turn
33:59
up to a buddhist temple after like years
34:01
of going on a
34:02
spiritual journey and i turn up when the
34:03
monks don't want to talk to me and i
34:05
have to talk to their robot
34:06
yeah well with a robot yeah well
34:09
it's it's they think it's a good way of
34:11
spreading more
34:12
idea of what buddhism is because it's
34:14
kind of like a monk version of siri did
34:16
you read what the meaning of life is
34:18
according to
34:20
well i looked up an article about him i
34:22
think it was in gizmodo magazine
34:24
and it was about him being displayed at
34:27
a
34:28
fair at a robot fair and he was asked
34:30
two questions he was first asked what's
34:32
the meaning of life and his reply was my
34:33
master says the meaning of life is to
34:35
help more people
34:36
finally leave behind bitterness and gain
34:38
happiness
34:39
and the next question it was asked was
34:41
who are your parents and he said
34:42
that's ridiculous how can robots have
34:44
parents which i
34:45
think that's quite a good
34:50
anger quite quickly but someone has just
34:52
said leave behind your bitterness and
34:53
gain happiness he's really jumped down
34:55
my throat for asking about his mom and
34:56
dad
34:56
apparently he's very good at um long
34:58
repetitive monotonous chances
35:00
which is a very important part of being
35:02
a buddhist monk so
35:03
just just to defend the robot for a
35:05
second but we've been
35:06
roundly critical wasn't the buddha who
35:08
kind of sat in front of a wall for 10
35:10
years or something
35:11
just meditating that would be quite easy
35:13
for a robot yes
35:14
yes turn it off you can see why robots
35:16
have started out with buddhism can't you
35:17
it feels like the easiest most
35:18
achievable one
35:23
he um so just to give a visual to anyone
35:26
who
35:26
uh hasn't yet gone to google straight
35:28
away see what he looks like
35:30
he is a two foot tall uh
35:33
little cartoon looking kind of monk
35:37
he's got the robes he's got the yellow
35:38
saffron kind of robes and he has a kind
35:41
of ipad that sits
35:42
in the middle of his chest which you can
35:44
press and that helps you with the
35:46
questions in the answer
35:47
tubby
35:48
[Laughter]
35:52
and so yeah and so it's it exists this
35:55
this little uh
35:56
monk this uh sienner uh he exists in
35:59
this temple which is 500 years old
36:01
it's kind of on the outskirts of beijing
36:02
and yeah you can go and visit he's not
36:04
always in use he's sometimes in a
36:05
cupboard
36:07
[Laughter]
36:09
meditating not being switched off
36:13
can i just say something about the
36:14
temple that the robot monk came from
36:16
yeah because it's really interesting the
36:17
longhuan temple is
36:19
famously tech savvy and has been for
36:21
years so this is really just an
36:23
accumulation of what they've been
36:24
working towards for ages and you would
36:26
love it alex i thought of you and i was
36:27
reading about it is it steam powered
36:29
oh it should be steam powered i think it
36:31
might even have moved beyond that
36:32
um so first of all a monk from the
36:34
apparently invented wechat
36:36
which is
36:42
[Laughter]
37:04
my fiance uh was telling me just the
37:06
other day that at work even her
37:08
colleagues they'll go in
37:09
and they'll just continue chatting i
37:10
know that my friends at school did it
37:13
this is not anecdotal well at the same
37:17
time
37:21
first scientist ever
37:25
see just as you were saying that as the
37:27
words came out you're like
37:28
[Laughter]
37:31
i would still suggest i've been in more
37:34
women's toilets than you have in my life
37:37
i know but you don't like talking i do
37:39
hate to talk can i ask ella
37:41
you know this definitely is a thing like
37:43
i can tell having not been in many
37:45
women's toilets that when um my wife or
37:48
a girl that i know goes to the toilet
37:50
she'll often bring a friend with her and
37:52
they'll go to the toilet at the same
37:53
time
37:53
do they just stand in stoney silence
37:56
[Laughter]
37:57
so to be honest i've never done that so
37:59
i don't i've never known what they do
38:00
um people chat in front of the mirror
38:02
when they're putting makeup on and stuff
38:03
okay this actually wasn't really the
38:04
point of my
38:07
my thing about the monks so wechat so
38:10
this is uh
38:11
yeah the among from the long cran temple
38:13
invented wechat it is said and wechat is
38:16
basically china's equivalent of whatsapp
38:17
and i
38:18
suspect that it has many more users so
38:19
it's got over a billion subscribers
38:21
right now which is
38:23
the world's population that's basically
38:25
everyone in china isn't it
38:26
uh yeah it's like 1.2 billion people in
38:28
china yeah i guess
38:29
wow so anyway it said that the guy who
38:32
uh manufactured it this guy called
38:35
zhang zhao long he went to the temple in
38:37
beijing
38:38
because questions concerning his idea
38:40
for wechat had long weighed in his heart
38:42
and he consulted with the monks there
38:44
and it turned out they're super
38:46
tech savvy and one of the monks uh sat
38:48
down with him for seven days and talked
38:50
over the digitization of this idea he
38:52
had
38:53
and uh told him how to do it and he left
38:55
after seven days of reflection and
38:56
chatting to a monk and
38:57
he invented wechat wow isn't that cool
39:00
they're moving away from nature and
39:02
towards technology and we do know
39:04
i mean the dalai lama very famously
39:06
loves technology
39:08
always has was obsessed with clocks so
39:11
maybe it's our impression of uh tech
39:14
and buddhism being incompatible is just
39:17
our view of that maybe actually they've
39:19
been dying for an ipad some people would
39:21
say that
39:21
being really into clocks is not being up
39:23
to date with the most modern technology
39:28
[Laughter]
39:33
um there's a robot called wd2
39:36
was that like an early version of wd-40
39:40
wd-40 the 14 means 40th attempt
39:43
wd stands for water displacement and he
39:46
made
39:47
39 tries and it didn't work and then
39:48
wd-40 was his fault
39:50
so wd2 is the robot that it's just a
39:53
rule with a face that looks at you
39:55
scans your face in 3d and then
39:57
rearranges its burn structure so it
39:58
looks like you
40:00
and there's no use for it there's no use
40:03
what about
40:03
people up yeah it's basically
40:06
like a really creepy mirror
40:08
that would be the weirdest thing that's
40:10
incredible there's immense use for that
40:13
okay go on anna all of crime and harry
40:16
potter
40:17
is based around making yourself look
40:19
like someone else isn't it oh yeah
40:22
yeah you know they
40:29
hotels are really good places robots in
40:32
japan especially yeah that's one of the
40:33
first places in which services is coming
40:35
in because they're so well suited to it
40:36
you've got
40:36
all the rooms have got the same you know
40:38
all the corridors look exactly the same
40:40
it's all really well organized do they
40:42
have robots using
40:43
like cleaning the rooms well they've got
40:45
robot concierges if you order room
40:46
service there are some hotels where
40:48
uh you get a little knock on your door
40:49
and it's basically like it's kind of
40:50
like an r2d2 robot and it looks exactly
40:52
like you
40:53
yeah all right we're gonna have to wrap
40:55
up really soon anyone
40:56
got anything before we do uh so buddhist
40:59
monks have an obesity problem at the
41:01
moment
41:02
um and it turns out more than half of
41:03
buddhist monks are obese and that's
41:05
because when people give donations to
41:07
monks it's often like sweet foods
41:08
so they just sit and they eat all these
41:10
sweet foods that people are
41:11
offering to them and their medical costs
41:13
are really burdening the thai government
41:15
and so
41:15
they've been had to put on this
41:16
government-sponsored diet and they've
41:19
also manufactured for them these special
41:21
girdles
41:22
which tighten as you put on weight as a
41:24
gentle reminder
41:25
that you're getting too fat for your
41:26
girdle um
41:28
i read something similar about nurses in
41:31
this country
41:32
really um i don't think they're putting
41:34
on a particular amount of weight but i
41:35
think they eat too many chocolates
41:37
because
41:38
whenever they save someone or look after
41:40
someone the relatives always give them
41:42
chocolates and they just eat
41:43
shitloads of them so and nurses will
41:46
thank us for this
41:47
next time give your nurse some raw
41:49
carrots and some celery
41:51
or a girdle
41:54
they're not horses
41:59
if i begin to the wrong hospitals
42:02
[Laughter]
42:07
[Applause]
42:09
okay that's it that is all of our facts
42:11
thank you so much for listening

00:10
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:12
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:15
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:17
covent garden my name is dan schreiber
00:19
i'm sitting here with james harkin andy
00:20
murray anna chazinski and special guest
00:23
tim minchin and once again we have
00:25
gathered around the microphones with our
00:26
four favorite facts from the last seven
00:28
days and in no particular order here we
00:31
go starting with you
00:33
tim
00:34
okay my fact is that bulgaria has an
00:37
agency that shoots rockets to kill hail
00:42
uh to kill it to kill it well to
00:46
minimize it it's a preemptive strikes uh
00:49
hail strikes
00:51
um
00:51
so i thought this all this weather
00:54
manipulation technology was bollocks but
00:56
apparently it's not so
00:58
so bulgaria has lots of um
01:01
agrarian bulgarian land and they grow
01:04
stuff and uh
01:06
and hail damages crops a lot and because
01:09
of its geography and its variable
01:11
landscape there's lots of hail
01:13
and so
01:14
they use seeding techniques to
01:18
well there are various ways you can
01:20
lower hailstones by seeding so
01:23
do you want to do you want to know about
01:24
it
01:25
it's super boring yeah yeah yeah i'll
01:27
try and make it more boring than it
01:28
actually is so so you you basically they
01:30
discovered in 1946 or something that if
01:33
you put dry ice
01:36
solid carbon dioxide into clouds um you
01:40
can
01:41
increase precipitation basically and
01:43
later they found out that um
01:45
something silver iodide and potassium
01:47
iodide also do there's various
01:48
techniques you can drop them from a
01:50
plane or shoot them up from a rocket
01:51
which is what the bulgarians do but in
01:53
terms of
01:54
fighting too much hail you the the main
01:57
technique is basically that you make
02:00
you shoot these chemicals up it changes
02:02
the chemical structure of the stuff
02:03
within the cloud and it actually makes
02:05
more
02:06
small hail stones that compete for the
02:08
available water okay so by the time they
02:10
hit the ground they're no longer hail
02:11
stones because they started too small oh
02:13
i think i've misunderstood the fact
02:15
because i thought they were shooting
02:16
rockets at falling hail i assumed it was
02:19
like there was an attack happening and
02:20
they were like like when you shoot a
02:22
missile at a plane yeah like a game of
02:24
space invaders
02:26
that would be amazing and with enough
02:28
people and enough tiny rockets
02:30
that would probably work but um or it's
02:32
like um you know those meteor disaster
02:35
movies you've you've basically got one
02:36
massive hailstone coming towards
02:39
bruce willis and exactly that's that guy
02:41
who sings love in an elevator or his
02:43
daughter
02:44
do you know the um that armageddon fact
02:46
about oh yes the fact that nasa so they
02:48
don't do it officially but they uh
02:50
unofficially show
02:52
people who are being recruited for nasa
02:54
the the movie of armageddon and the job
02:56
is to spot as many inaccuracies as
02:58
possible good i think the the over 100
03:01
isn't it yeah i think
03:02
icon
03:04
yeah exactly yeah yeah so that's
03:06
actually a thing that they said i can't
03:07
get the song in my head don't want to
03:09
close oh
03:11
no one yeah
03:13
that's the game
03:14
cause i miss you baby oh so that's not
03:18
inaccurate that's perfect
03:20
did i spot that it was the only way they
03:22
didn't quibble with
03:23
the song
03:24
but there's there's that there's sort of
03:26
dodgy technology there's things called
03:28
hail cannons so so in medieval times
03:30
they used to ring church bells and fire
03:32
cannons into the sky
03:34
and to try and stop hail but they have
03:36
things that still in modern times called
03:38
um hail cannons which basically make an
03:41
explosion at the bottom of look what
03:43
looks like a large
03:44
loud hailer ironically and they they
03:48
send up uh a sound wave and it's meant
03:50
to distribute hail in the energy and
03:52
they essentially don't work do they but
03:54
they're not they're still marketed
03:55
everywhere if you look up kind of wine
03:57
growers tips and stuff in europe people
03:59
will try to sell those things and they
04:00
are like gigantic ice cream cones a bit
04:02
aren't they they're the same ones
04:03
they're like yeah they look like huge
04:04
cones what you were saying about bell
04:06
ringing they used to do that to get rid
04:07
of thunder didn't they as well oh yeah
04:09
so they would send people up a massive
04:10
tower with a bell in it to ring the bell
04:12
to get rid of the thunder but they're
04:13
electrocuted yeah because you're next to
04:15
a massive metal thing really high up
04:17
yeah yeah i was reading just the other
04:19
day about a miracle in the middle ages
04:22
which was where the church bells started
04:23
to ring by themselves because they were
04:25
so happy so windy that are particular
04:29
they were really thrilled at a
04:30
particular religious event or
04:31
celebration so they started they're
04:32
wrong by themselves yeah that's nice
04:34
um do you know what my favorite thing
04:36
about this fact is that
04:38
the person who um
04:40
discovered that silver iodide works as
04:43
well or better than um
04:45
solid carbon dioxide in cloud seeding
04:48
was a guy called bernard vonnegut
04:52
right any relation
04:53
1946 and i just which is so weird and
04:57
it's kurt vonnegut's brother yeah and
04:59
the weird thing is whenever i think of
05:01
cloud seeding i think of cats cradle i
05:03
think of ice nine yeah this cat's cradle
05:06
is all about an isotope that freezes
05:08
liquid on contact
05:10
and it's
05:11
so that's obviously what he was reading
05:13
and thinking about his big brother was
05:15
because he was a science nerd but i
05:17
didn't know it that's extraordinary it's
05:18
one of my favorite it's a great bird
05:20
that's an incredible book yeah it's a
05:22
scary glad for this hail fan
05:25
yeah
05:26
so the thing that you were saying
05:28
earlier about cloud seeding yeah
05:30
thinking that i had no idea that worked
05:32
and apparently it does i was reading
05:34
that the uh
05:36
the beijing olympics for their opening
05:38
ceremony they made sure that they had no
05:40
clouds by doing literally that firing
05:43
rockets into the sky in order to knock
05:45
them out and is it proper science as
05:47
well
05:48
there are all sorts of question marks
05:49
over here okay sometimes it works so it
05:51
might have been a coincidence that there
05:52
just was no clouds yeah it's always hard
05:54
to tell basically because you can't say
05:55
it definitely would have rained there's
05:57
no control group yeah no and
05:59
because the data set of any weather is
06:02
chaotic not climate but weather is
06:05
chaotic you can you can
06:07
always draw inference where there was an
06:09
inference you know yeah right but but
06:11
there's no way i mean the chinese
06:12
government of course would say like we
06:13
got rid of the cloud
06:15
that's very in character
06:17
but um
06:19
but we uh but but it's not pseudoscience
06:22
because
06:23
you can measure impact but the impact is
06:26
never from 100 to zero it's um it's
06:28
percentages of of manipulation okay have
06:31
you read the
06:32
accounts of people going in and doing
06:34
cloud seeding no it's so hardcore
06:38
yeah yeah yeah the people go in the
06:39
plane so a journal a bloomberg
06:41
journalist went up with a couple of
06:42
cloud cedars um in who are doing cloud
06:45
seeding in bangalore because india has
06:47
drought problems so they were trying to
06:48
solve that by
06:49
generating a bit of rain and it's so
06:52
what you do is you go under the hugest
06:54
storm cloud you can find and there's a
06:56
big updraft in the middle of it and you
06:58
fly underneath that in your little plane
07:00
and you let yourself get sucked up and i
07:02
think you get sucked up you get sucked
07:04
up at 800 feet per minute and so this
07:06
journalist was just like i was in the
07:07
back behind them just vomiting the whole
07:09
time but then what then what so then
07:11
they've got to fly into clouds are you
07:13
know they've got all these rockets on
07:14
the wings yeah so they've got i think he
07:16
had eight rockets on each wing and it
07:17
fires uh the um substances off into the
07:21
clouds and then allows them to seed but
07:23
it sounds absolutely terrifying wow
07:25
he said he couldn't lift his hands off
07:27
his lap because you're going up so fast
07:29
there was a thing about so this is when
07:30
the usa was starting to get involved in
07:32
a really serious way because they they
07:34
tried it over uh lau during the vietnam
07:37
war but also the usa had a national hail
07:40
research experiment in the 70s and it
07:42
lasted for four years and i think they
07:43
closed it down because they hadn't got
07:44
the technology right but when they were
07:46
doing it some farmers were very angry
07:49
about the idea because they thought that
07:50
cloud seeding would reduce the rainfall
07:52
and damage their crops the other way and
07:54
some of them fired shots at aircraft
07:56
which they thought were doing cloud
07:58
seeding right so adding to the risk yeah
08:03
do you know loud this isn't very
08:04
cheerful at all but um i haven't
08:05
remembered it since i went there about
08:07
10 years ago is the most bombed country
08:09
per square kilometer in the world
08:11
because of during the vietnam war
08:13
it's good to have
08:15
a record of some description yeah
08:17
exactly it's very proud of it yeah it's
08:19
on all their places the only other thing
08:20
is they have all those jars don't they
08:22
have the plane of jars
08:24
full of unexplained jars yeah we think
08:26
they might have be they might have been
08:27
for funeral uses putting bodies in maybe
08:30
or they might have been for storing
08:31
grain
08:32
hundreds and hundreds of massive
08:34
human-sized jars on a plate wow
08:36
fantastic we don't know why jars on a
08:38
plane
08:40
in the summer
08:41
do you know the biggest hailstone
08:43
uh no
08:45
2010 um a hailstone larger than a
08:47
bowling ball fell on vivien during an
08:50
exceptional hailstorm wow vivian is a
08:53
town in south dakota
08:55
thank goodness
08:58
he didn't even get a surname james it's
09:00
really disrespectful madonna yeah
09:02
the hailstone obliterated her surname on
09:04
her name tag
09:10
um there was have you heard about the
09:12
guy who had weird blue hail fall in his
09:14
garden in 2012 no did he think it was
09:17
urine from a plane or something he
09:19
didn't because my urine isn't blue james
09:22
is yours i am going to have to see a
09:24
doctor
09:25
george the third had blue urine didn't
09:27
you hey porphyria okay so this wasn't
09:29
george the third year and being
09:30
catapulted out of a plane uh but this
09:32
was a guy called steve hornsby he lived
09:34
in bournemouth and there was in the
09:35
middle of a hail storm and these jelly
09:38
like three centimeter diameter balls
09:41
blue balls fell in his garden i think
09:43
about a dozen of them fell in his garden
09:44
and he said they were like squishy
09:46
jelly-ish eggs and they don't know what
09:48
they were um one of the researchers said
09:50
that uh it might have been a bird's egg
09:52
like an undeveloped bird's egg and she
09:55
said uh bird's eggs have been implicated
09:57
in previous strange goo incidents and
10:00
apparently because birds hold their eggs
10:01
in their claws when they're flying but
10:02
if they're hit by hail then they let go
10:04
of them in a panic and so this guy just
10:05
had 12. birds hold their eggs in their
10:08
claws when they're flying apparently
10:10
really
10:11
that's the premise of my movie the whole
10:13
first scene is a bird flying with an egg
10:15
in its claws
10:17
that's a good spoiler thanks we've got a
10:19
scoop there it's only the beginning do
10:21
you think critics will walk out if it's
10:22
actually an actor
10:26
i can just picture a little kid next
10:28
door to that guy in bournemouth just
10:30
throwing blue jelly
10:32
watching the dude's face and laughs
10:34
watching the journalists show up have i
10:37
taken this too far
10:39
um i have a couple of things on bulgaria
10:41
did anyone oh yeah
10:42
no but do it okay uh i first off i try
10:45
to find a famous bulgarian which is
10:47
quite hard there isn't really any
10:49
crystal steichkov okay so we've got one
10:52
yeah any lead on one um i've got simeon
10:54
saxakobo gotha
10:56
okay so who's your who's your football
10:58
player yeah and yours mine was the prime
11:01
minister of bulgaria until 2005. but
11:03
here's the cool thing he was he is one
11:06
of the only two who had blue urine
11:12
he's one of the only two people who's
11:14
currently alive who was a head of state
11:15
during the second world war oh wow
11:17
yeah he was the czar of bulgaria in 1943
11:21
when he was six years old and the
11:23
soviets invaded and he was exiled and
11:25
then he stayed alive and stayed alive
11:28
for a long time and then won an election
11:29
in his native country in 2001 oh that's
11:32
how cool is that oh that's cool yeah
11:34
i could just imagine the six yard i'll
11:37
be back
11:38
[Laughter]
11:40
so you've got no no no i do i should i
11:43
should just qualify and say
11:44
internationally famous bulgarians uh but
11:47
it turns out that the grandparents of
11:49
mark zuckerberg are bulgarian and he's
11:52
named after his bulgarian grandfather
11:53
marco
11:54
so he's he's they're trying to claim him
11:57
as bulgarian also i found one very good
11:59
politician from bulgaria who got fired
12:02
in 2010 because he was playing too much
12:04
farmville while they were trying to so
12:09
on an foreign um and he was fired and he
12:11
was dismissed and they added in his
12:13
dismissal that he would now have more
12:14
time to tend to his virtual farm
12:17
with his with his hail cannons
12:20
send him down to be minister for
12:21
agriculture or something
12:24
when he was when he was dismissed he
12:26
came back and he said uh that he
12:28
basically tried to explain himself and
12:30
tried to say that he wasn't the worst he
12:32
said he'd only reached level 40 well as
12:34
daniela zelokova had the counsellor from
12:37
the righteous democrats of the strong
12:38
bulgarian party was already at level 46
12:41
so he was furious outraged
12:44
[Music]
12:45
okay it's time for fact number two and
12:48
that is chozinski
12:50
my fact this week is that we judge music
12:52
more on how it looks than how it sounds
12:56
what
12:57
what am i talking about
13:00
so this is an experiment that was done
13:01
by researchers at ucl in 2013 and it was
13:06
actually a sequence of seven experiments
13:08
and it involved over 800 participants
13:10
and some of them are musical experts so
13:12
a professional classical music judges
13:15
and some of them were just amateurs just
13:16
plebs like you and me and they take
13:19
exceptions
13:21
except you james from different types of
13:23
plebs yeah um and they got them to
13:26
listen to recordings of people who've
13:28
been entered into classical music
13:29
competitions and to tell the
13:32
participants who they thought would won
13:33
these competitions and when the
13:35
participants just heard a recording of
13:37
the recitals they had no better chance
13:40
than just random chance at knowing who'd
13:42
won the contest
13:44
and when they were watching the person
13:46
performing at the same time as listening
13:47
to them performing they also had no
13:49
better chance than just what would be
13:51
random chance but if you muted the
13:54
visuals and they just watched the person
13:56
on the piano during the classical music
13:57
recital suddenly uh the chance of them
14:00
guessing who'd won the competition went
14:02
way up and they got like they were more
14:04
than twice as likely to why do we think
14:06
that's the case at the start of the
14:08
study like 96 of the professionals and
14:12
88 of the amateurs said that they would
14:15
judge almost entirely on sound but
14:17
actually they think that we use visual
14:20
cues so we don't quite realize it but
14:21
when they say what they appreciate in
14:22
the music they'll say something like
14:24
passion and actually they're getting
14:26
passion out of the way that a performer
14:27
is moving
14:29
and they're thinking oh i'm really
14:30
enjoying hearing this piece i'm really
14:32
appreciating the uh nuances and the
14:34
music but actually they're just enjoying
14:36
watching someone look like they're
14:38
passionate
14:39
i just thought it was really interesting
14:41
that yeah that is interesting so
14:43
whenever i've seen a band play the one
14:44
that's coming to mind is mumford and
14:46
sons there's a guy on the keyboards
14:47
right
14:48
if i ever see a festival and he goes for
14:50
it and he's like he's rocking on it but
14:53
you know he's just playing a g like it's
14:55
just a g over and over and it's like why
14:57
are you why are you putting but if that
14:59
was muted so it's not an acoustic
15:02
instrument so yeah you can't get more
15:04
out of it it's like hitting it harder or
15:06
throwing your boat but but it's the same
15:07
watching a pianist player a beautiful
15:10
acoustic piano and that you'll you'll
15:12
watch some classical pianist sort of
15:15
ease their body in and their wrists down
15:18
and they'll
15:19
just sort of place their finger on the
15:21
key and
15:22
most of the cue you're getting from that
15:23
the reason that sounds like a beautiful
15:25
note is because of the approach yeah and
15:28
and you could go you could get a robot
15:30
to go
15:33
and it would sound
15:34
exactly the same well this is the thing
15:36
this is why they have um blind auditions
15:38
for orchestras these days because they
15:40
noticed oh they were the gender bias
15:42
exactly insane yeah and until the 70s or
15:45
the 90s about five percent of an
15:46
orchestra was with female musicians
15:48
which is obviously statistically
15:50
surprising well but of course the
15:53
assumption was oh well you know their
15:55
brains are different and they're they're
15:56
physically not as capable and so they
15:58
can't cut it yeah and everyone just took
16:00
that as given oh well you know women
16:01
aren't as good as those men at music
16:04
and then they started blinding the
16:05
auditions yeah and it's guess what it's
16:07
like 50 50.
16:09
it's nothing to do with it but they had
16:11
some where they the the
16:13
they had blind auditions and still many
16:15
more men were being chosen for the
16:17
orchestra and the women they when they
16:18
worked out a possible explanation which
16:19
was that
16:20
uh the women were going and wearing high
16:22
heels to the blind auditions
16:24
you heard the sound of their feet and
16:26
that might have been subconsciously
16:28
affecting people fools they should have
16:30
known i mean women are idiots i'm sorry
16:31
they shouldn't have worn high heels
16:34
that was a special point that was the
16:35
point i was trying to make there yes is
16:37
that women already it's great
16:38
yeah it's it's pretty depressing this
16:41
reminds me this is a digression but of
16:43
um blinding instrument tests because
16:47
have you guys discussed this no no i
16:49
don't think the uh
16:51
about the stradivarius effect you know
16:53
the the knowledge
16:54
that an instrument is i guess it is very
16:57
related the knowledge that an instrument
16:58
is worth a million quid
17:01
changes not only the audience's
17:03
appreciation but the musician so a a
17:06
first chair or a soloist classical
17:08
violinist will
17:09
you know
17:10
get on lease or buy if they're very
17:12
lucky a
17:14
stradivarius worth a million bucks and
17:17
they'll play it now everyone will swear
17:19
black and blue that that it sounds
17:21
better
17:22
but if you blinding this is quite hard
17:24
because the wood smells different and it
17:27
feels different and stuff but if you
17:29
control as much as you can for those
17:31
variables putting you know blocking
17:32
their noses and and and just get the
17:35
players to play it and hear it there's
17:38
they can't pick a stradivarius from a
17:40
thousand dollar chinese and this has
17:42
been true for about 200 years i think
17:44
they've been doing these studies and it
17:45
always shows but then every single year
17:47
you get another thing saying oh it's
17:49
because of the word it's a special kind
17:50
of
17:51
special kind of that yeah do you know
17:53
what's valid though i mean i was
17:54
thinking about this today with um
17:56
disease and psychosomatic illness and
17:58
stuff that if you have someone with a
18:00
one of these umbrella diagnoses like um
18:04
chronic fatigue
18:05
um
18:06
they'll
18:07
there'll be this outrage if anyone
18:09
suggests there's a psychological element
18:11
to their disease
18:12
but that that assumes a dichotomy
18:16
between neurology and physiology
18:19
that is something that increasingly we
18:21
don't we realize is not true so the fact
18:23
that a disease has a psychological
18:25
element
18:26
or a neurological element
18:28
psychologically neurological are kind of
18:29
indistinct if if it does have a
18:31
psychological element it doesn't mean
18:32
you're not still sick it's just you're
18:34
not necessarily sick you they these
18:37
people want it desperately to be a a
18:39
tick or a or
18:41
some kind of pathogen
18:43
but
18:44
but but if you tell them it's
18:45
neurological they're like no it's not
18:46
all in my head and it's like it doesn't
18:48
matter it's all in your head in the end
18:50
yeah pain and yeah sickness and it's all
18:52
interpretation like and so with this
18:54
violin thing like maybe it doesn't
18:56
matter that it's bollocks because the
18:58
musician feels more passionate about
18:59
their music when they play it and maybe
19:01
it changes their body language and
19:02
changes the audience experience and the
19:04
fact that it's psychological is
19:06
fine it's part of our experience yeah
19:08
yeah it is it's uh yeah it's it's good
19:10
stuff we should keep lying that's well
19:12
let's just re-label all violins
19:16
let's just do it if we can sell them all
19:18
for two hundred thousand pounds if we do
19:20
it
19:22
do you miss the point if we do it and we
19:24
cover it up 200 years from now people
19:26
will be enjoying music much more yeah
19:28
there was this guy
19:30
he made
19:31
thousands and thousands and thousands
19:34
he's still making them it's amazing
19:40
quick thing about cognitive bias which
19:43
this is kind of about but um
19:45
which this is about which is um how we
19:47
convince ourselves of things that aren't
19:49
true uh is that uh everyone almost
19:52
everyone thinks they're above average
19:54
and if you present people with most
19:57
skills and you do studies on how good
19:58
they think they are at skills and then
20:00
you test how good they are at skills
20:02
people will think they're better than
20:03
average at most things so i think some
20:05
things are particularly high so there's
20:08
a study in 1977 which is quite famous
20:10
where 94 of professors said they were
20:13
above average in relation to their peers
20:16
so obviously this is people
20:18
we we are so good at convincing
20:20
ourselves of certain things that yeah
20:22
with driving a lot driving i think their
20:24
agenda thing there i bet men are worse
20:26
in driving i think actually it was
20:30
gender equal because i was expecting
20:31
that as well i was disappointed
20:36
[Laughter]
20:37
do you know about that you guys discuss
20:39
the dunning-kruger effect but there's a
20:41
also a correlation between how bad you
20:43
are the the gap between it's slightly a
20:45
misinterpreted thing but the the gap
20:47
between uh how good you are and how good
20:50
you think you are increases as you get
20:51
worse at a thing yeah oh it's amazing so
20:54
so
20:55
it's sort of like the less you know
20:56
about other things the less you know how
20:58
bad you are at the thing yeah so people
21:01
and and the thing that people make a
21:02
mistake with this data which is very
21:04
interesting data um
21:06
is they think oh those people are so
21:08
dumb they don't know how dumb they are
21:09
but it's actually all of us
21:11
in all of us we have things where the
21:12
dunning-kruger effect the the point is
21:14
it's the things we're at that we
21:16
don't know we're so at you've
21:17
basically written a song about that
21:18
haven't you the first song in matilda is
21:20
basically like that oh yeah i guess um
21:22
the idea that everyone thinks their kid
21:24
is uh above average yeah yeah
21:28
above average is average go figure
21:30
it's one of my best friends it's a
21:32
children's musical you've got to go see
21:33
it
21:35
come on new people
21:38
okay it's time to move on to fact number
21:40
three and that is james okay my fact
21:43
this week is that the bfg's dream powder
21:46
also helps against constipation
21:50
oh bless is that an edited chapter uh so
21:53
this is not in the book this is um a
21:56
thing that i read by ophelia dal who was
21:59
roald dahl's daughter and she was
22:00
talking about her childhood and before
22:03
uh roald dahl wrote the bfg he kind of
22:05
had this idea already and his kids
22:09
couldn't sleep and he was like oh you
22:10
know what there's a kind of a dream
22:12
powder that people blow into your
22:13
bedroom and it gives you good dreams but
22:16
it also helps for anything from maths
22:18
problems to constipation
22:20
okay and then the kids kind of went to
22:22
sleep and then he ran outside got his um
22:25
got his ladder put it up against the
22:26
wall ran up put a bamboo pole into their
22:29
bedroom and pretended to blow in sleep
22:31
wow and then from there that's where the
22:33
idea from the book came
22:35
supposedly they knew
22:37
that it wasn't that it was him but they
22:39
pretended to him afterwards and was
22:41
there a lot of constipation in the doll
22:43
family not after this they all
22:46
immediately shot themselves
22:49
oh my god
22:52
they did once get suspicious i think um
22:55
so they said how are we supposed to know
22:57
that this is real daddy and so they went
22:59
downstairs and confronted him and he
23:01
said how dare you question my um
23:03
truthfulness and then the next day they
23:05
said they woke up and opened the
23:06
curtains and they saw the letters bfg
23:08
burned into their lawn and he loved his
23:10
lawn so much and apparently he was very
23:12
angry about this and that proved to them
23:13
that the bfg existed so this is very
23:15
easily convinced
23:17
yeah he sounds like a great a great dad
23:20
yeah
23:20
i was reading about the first movie of
23:22
the bfg the animation and the original
23:25
voice was meant to be spike milligan and
23:28
i'm very upset that it's not because i
23:30
look at i look at the bfg's face and i
23:32
see spike milligan now right yeah and he
23:34
when he showed up to the audition uh
23:36
they said he had to go home and shave i
23:37
don't know why because it was a voice
23:39
job well
23:40
dial hated beards yeah oh really hated
23:43
beards yeah was he a pogonophobe yeah
23:46
totally yeah what that's what is that
23:53
i mean that's really real i i've talked
23:55
to lissy about that he really didn't
23:57
like beards yeah i think he wrote an
23:59
essay in the times only came out quite
24:00
recently saying they're a hairy smoke
24:02
screen behind which people hide um and
24:06
yeah yeah he really loathed them but is
24:07
this true about beards that this is
24:09
difficult because he said that it was a
24:11
bad representation of male vanity and no
24:14
man should be vain but i would have
24:15
thought that it's much more effort to
24:16
shave but he said i think it must take
24:18
at least twice as long to wash
24:20
thoroughly a face that is matted with
24:21
bristly vegetation so that no dirt or
24:24
food remains among the hairs than simply
24:26
to shave but i didn't realize beard's
24:28
required that level of does sound phobic
24:30
doesn't it i'm not i mean i've never
24:33
considered washing my oh do you have to
24:35
clean like comb food out of your beard
24:37
every night before we go to sleep um no
24:39
should i well according to dolls that
24:43
does sound phobic though doesn't it
24:44
sounds like a sort of fantasy version of
24:46
what a beard might be like yeah or maybe
24:48
you sort of just sort of thinking of big
24:50
dostoyevsky and beards and yeah yeah i
24:52
don't know
24:53
so he had supposedly this cabinet of
24:56
curiosities sort of odd things in his
24:58
shed and i imagine you'd have seen all
24:59
of these yeah i i was actually
25:01
one of the last people to see it before
25:03
it moved and now it's in the museum in
25:05
in great missington
25:06
yeah he had some of his spine in a jar
25:09
yeah um
25:11
because he had a terrible spinal injury
25:12
when he a plane crash in the libyan
25:14
desert during the second world war and
25:16
he also had um he he had a draw on one
25:19
of his filing cabinets and the handle of
25:21
it was a steel bit of steel which had
25:23
been put into his pelvis during an
25:25
unsuccessful hip replacement and so he
25:27
said well i'll just turn that into a
25:28
handle for a filing cabinet that's great
25:30
he wasn't medically he was extremely
25:32
unlucky i think in terms of people
25:34
around him and himself wasn't he
25:38
sad so he lost his daughter and that
25:40
obviously just destroyed him but then
25:42
um
25:44
theo got you know his son got hit by a
25:46
car in new york when he was a little
25:48
tiny infant in a in a pram
25:51
but he invented this um shunt he got a
25:54
model maker from down the road and a
25:56
doctor who turned out bizarrely after
25:59
i'd written matilda i found out as a
26:00
friend of my granddad's wow wow my mum
26:03
was reading his biography and went dave
26:05
this is your father's friend
26:08
so that was very exciting when mum got
26:10
to meet lizzy but um
26:12
yeah he just felt that um he he should
26:14
be able to fix stuff you know and it's
26:16
such an interesting brain this darkness
26:19
and light and the pragmatic versus the
26:21
fantastical you know i just absolutely
26:24
intriguing guy and it did uh you know
26:27
you hear about people patenting things
26:29
and being a bit wacky but that his
26:31
invention genuinely did save thousands
26:32
and thousands last year
26:35
it was superseded quite quickly but it
26:37
was huge i think it was yeah very
26:38
effective three thousand children i
26:40
think had it fitted yeah
26:42
and then
26:43
charity saves a whole lot more and it's
26:44
pretty incredible yeah
26:46
um you know you had no teeth
26:48
already
26:49
had him all out in his twenties it would
26:51
have been a spike because he was a spy
26:53
briefly or sort of a military attache in
26:55
washington in the wall but he would have
26:56
been a spy with no teeth at that awesome
26:58
time that's a great book isn't it a spy
27:00
with no teeth
27:04
on ian fleming's backup list
27:07
dr no teeth
27:10
they were friends actually weren't they
27:11
well donnie and fleming they worked
27:13
together a fair bit or they knew each
27:14
other at least and had a mutual respect
27:16
for each other and they both sort of
27:17
worked for
27:19
five together at that time and they
27:21
worked on two movies as well yes and
27:22
they worked on films together afterwards
27:24
yeah so did he do the spy who no he did
27:26
you and you lived twice and he also did
27:29
chitty chitty bang bang yes darl this is
27:31
a thing i found out that i had no idea
27:33
is that um he was buried with a power
27:35
saw yeah
27:36
really not that it was used to dig the
27:38
grave i mean he was literally he's got a
27:40
pound in his coffin with him or sort of
27:42
in the i'm not sure whether maybe it's a
27:43
tomb but he was buried with his snooker
27:45
cues
27:47
some burgundy
27:48
chocolates hb pencils and a power saw
27:51
we need to find that tone
27:53
and get that burgundy
27:57
we are low on wine
28:00
so he used to write for playboy didn't
28:02
he he did yeah wrote playboy stories in
28:04
fact hugh hefner um did a thing where in
28:07
one of the editions of playboy he
28:10
included 10 golden tickets and if you
28:12
got a golden ticket in the playboy uh
28:15
copy you then got to go to the playboy
28:17
mansion to an x-rated wonderland
28:20
chocolate factory
28:21
[Laughter]
28:24
nine-year-old has the most dramatic day
28:25
of his life
28:30
all right this is just one tiny fact
28:31
about dreaming um but because the bfg's
28:34
about dreams am i right yeah yeah sure
28:36
um so there was a study done in germany
28:38
about nightmares and the five most
28:40
common themes for nightmares are
28:43
falling being chased being paralyzed the
28:46
death of family or friends and
28:49
being late
28:50
which it's like
28:52
how if people is that up there with all
28:54
these other traumatic things that could
28:55
possibly ever happen to you not knowing
28:57
your lines
28:58
that's what i get really oh yeah having
29:00
to go on not knowing my lines often
29:02
shakespeare
29:03
having to go on
29:05
on in a shakespeare and not knowing my
29:07
lines would that be worse because a lot
29:09
of people are just going to know all the
29:10
lines anyway yeah probably yeah shouting
29:12
it out yeah
29:21
um i have a fact about constipation
29:23
so this is from the you know the
29:25
guardian used to do notes and queries
29:27
and it would you sometimes find the very
29:28
old columns online basically they have
29:30
one question a load of people answer
29:32
have they stopped doing it now uh i'm
29:33
not sure but a lot of them look archived
29:35
now basically but they've got there was
29:37
a thing about old books right and a
29:40
couple of people wrote in and one person
29:42
wrote in saying the father of a friend
29:44
of mine used to find that breathing in
29:46
the atmosphere of a well-stocked
29:47
second-hand bookshop the mustier the
29:49
better was a certain cure for his acute
29:52
constipation
29:55
exactly
29:56
there's a phenomenon we've talked about
29:58
on this podcast which is this woman i
29:59
think mariko aoki where she had
30:01
where she was overwhelmed by the urge to
30:03
have poo when she was in a bookshop
30:05
i wonder and there's another letter
30:07
who's another person second down wrote
30:10
um i first became aware of this little
30:12
known side effect of my interest in old
30:14
books some years ago and have been
30:15
plagued by it ever since
30:17
i'm reassured to know there are other
30:18
sufferers i think we might have cracked
30:20
the phenomenon well you do get a lot of
30:22
um kind of not bacteria but fungal
30:25
spores don't you in in all books
30:27
so maybe
30:28
it speeds up the process
30:30
yeah it must i thought it might be
30:31
associative so these people are people
30:34
who read their old books on the loo
30:36
and then and their brain goes oh old
30:38
book bhutan
30:40
that's an amazing theory can i just
30:42
there's one cure for constipation that i
30:43
like that i didn't know about um which
30:46
is the violet ray device and so i think
30:49
this was kind of uh sort of invented by
30:52
tesla so it's an electrical device which
30:55
was used to cure a whole bunch of stuff
30:56
as well as late as the 1930s and it
30:59
basically used electrotherapy to and you
31:02
put put the instrument that puts an
31:04
electric current through whatever bit of
31:05
your body is ailing you put it on that
31:07
and it cures it and you were supposed to
31:09
put it into your rectum and you saw an
31:11
electric current up there and it
31:13
relieves constipation it feels like it
31:15
would work it does in the 1930s if you
31:17
look at newspaper adverts it's all over
31:19
it the violet ray device they're using
31:21
electric kind of um butt plugs to get
31:24
semen from rhinos i happen to know oh
31:27
yeah yeah is rhino one of your online
31:31
[Applause]
31:35
okay it's time for a final fact of the
31:38
show and that is andrew hunter murray my
31:40
fact is that britain has only one
31:42
performing circus raccoon
31:44
so i found this fact in the spectator
31:46
it's from the house of commons papers um
31:49
and
31:50
um
31:51
there are not many animals
31:53
performing in circuses left in the uk
31:54
and elephants and big cats have both
31:56
been banned from british circuses there
31:59
are now two traveling services they're
32:01
turning up trunks
32:03
does make it sound like they've
32:04
misbehaved
32:05
i can't come to a circus junk there's
32:08
raccoons on stage
32:11
so there's the circus mondeo uh who have
32:13
horses camels llamas mules donkeys
32:15
reindeer and one zebra okay and there's
32:18
peter's jolly circus
32:21
uh which i and i phoned up both of these
32:23
circuses
32:24
yeah
32:25
i had a chat with them and peter's
32:26
charlie circus has horses donkeys ponies
32:29
a camel two zebras llamas a parrot and
32:32
reggie the raccoon
32:33
uh i spoke to the guy who's
32:36
well
32:37
he does a lot of stuff um firstly he
32:39
didn't vote with gary lineker
32:41
a chris pepper i imagine it was a crisp
32:43
but um
32:44
reggie salted
32:46
very good
32:48
very good
32:50
as you are
32:51
um so i thought you guys might ask what
32:53
does reggie do and i asked uh the keeper
32:56
and he said he basically i'm
32:58
paraphrasing but
32:59
he said he basically walks around the
33:01
ring fence and goes up on a ramp onto a
33:02
platform and goes in and out of poles
33:04
like dogs do for those agility things
33:06
and then comes back down
33:09
so maybe that's why there's only one
33:10
fantastic but the keeper wasn't playing
33:12
to point out he's not the uk's only
33:13
performing raccoon because there's a
33:15
lady who did britain's got talent with
33:17
uh
33:19
so raccoons have uh public toilets
33:22
don't they they have their own latrine
33:23
area raccoons and we don't know why they
33:25
do it whether it's from a sense of
33:26
cleanliness or one the articles really
33:28
said maybe for communication purposes
33:30
but they have a the group of raccoons
33:32
will designate a toilet place and they
33:34
all go and there and that's that's
33:35
where they do that well raccoon
33:37
droppings are very poisonous they have
33:39
little nematode worms in them that can
33:40
kill you right yeah i think there's like
33:42
even no cure or something that's why i
33:45
was wondering why quite a lot of the
33:46
warnings are very alarmist about raccoon
33:48
latrines and how bad it is if you find
33:49
them in your garden you shouldn't touch
33:50
them but that probably explains that
33:53
the governments of the bahamas were
33:56
protecting the bahaman raccoon
33:58
and then someone did some dna tests and
34:01
found it was exactly the same as a north
34:02
american common raccoon and so overnight
34:05
they went from protecting them to
34:06
setting up an eradication
34:08
[Laughter]
34:12
such a horrible news to wake up to is
34:14
those raccoons
34:16
in their four poster beds
34:19
darling what's wrong
34:22
um i have a few facts about circus
34:24
things right okay um so there's i found
34:28
an unbelievably good book called beastly
34:30
london by hannah welton it's so good
34:33
it's a history of almost every animal
34:34
that's ever been in london and it is
34:36
incredible um so just a few circus shows
34:39
that happened um
34:40
there was uh the singing mouse which
34:43
appeared in 1843 at some private rooms
34:46
in reading street apparently it could
34:48
wobble incessantly for a quarter of an
34:50
hour
34:51
wow even better on mute
34:55
and then a few years later there was a
34:56
rival singing mouse which set up off the
34:58
strand which were very near at the
34:59
moment at a hairdresser's and tickets
35:01
were sixpence but if you got a haircut
35:03
it was free to see the mouse weird
35:05
enough that a mouse can sing but
35:09
that's incredible i just remembered i
35:11
went to circus museum in florida i can't
35:13
remember it's somewhere in florida i
35:14
can't remember what it is and then they
35:16
had a load of weird people there who did
35:18
weird things and one of them went
35:20
downstairs on his head and that was his
35:22
whole act that's good he was just like
35:24
without using his hands without using
35:26
his hands he would just kind of put get
35:28
on the top step with his head and then i
35:30
guess use his neck muscles or something
35:31
he's one of the first ever circus
35:32
performers rode a horse standing on his
35:34
head was he an ass one of us
35:37
i think he was pretty ashley so it
35:38
wasn't actually circus because philip
35:40
actually is the guy who invented the
35:41
circus but he did a lot of like weird
35:43
kind of actually did incredible horse
35:45
riding yeah there was a guy called
35:46
daniel wild man who was so good 1772
35:50
this is he could ride a horse while
35:51
standing up right pretty good with a
35:53
mask of bees on his
35:57
it's face isn't that incredible
36:00
yeah i'd like to see him riding a bee
36:02
with a mask of horses on his head
36:05
so there's just one sentence about him
36:07
um he he rides standing up on the saddle
36:09
with the bridle in his mouth and by
36:11
firing a pistol makes one part of the
36:13
bees mount over the table and the other
36:15
part swarm in the air and return to that
36:16
proper place they were doing tricks kind
36:18
of show jumping with the bees while
36:20
riding a horse but apparently he held
36:22
the queen bee in his hand so to sort of
36:24
get them to follow along
36:26
yeah
36:27
wow sounds amazing that sounds
36:29
ridiculous sort of level of imagination
36:31
to work on the scale of a horse and the
36:33
scale of a bee at the same time have you
36:35
guys heard of the dog's toilet club
36:38
have we heard of the toilet club i
36:41
reckon i've accidentally stumbled into
36:42
it
36:45
what is it
36:46
it was an establishment on bond street
36:48
in the early 20th century
36:50
unfortunately it's not quite as good as
36:52
it sounds it was where you could buy
36:53
nice things for dogs like toilette in
36:56
the sense of like toilet water but you
36:58
could and it was incredibly lavish
36:59
because it was on bond street so you
37:01
could get scented baths or hankies for
37:04
your dog or jeweled collars or fur coats
37:06
when was that
37:07
early 20th century that's weird that
37:09
people have been doing that for so long
37:11
yeah so that dog's toilet club is also
37:13
in the beastly london book i cannot
37:14
recommend it enough um one of my
37:16
favorite circus facts of recent times is
37:19
that john major's dad former prime
37:21
minister of england john major his dad
37:24
was in the circus and by all accounts
37:26
i'm going to actually properly read
37:27
about him sounds like an extraordinary
37:29
guy
37:30
tom major
37:31
and the idea that everyone says is fact
37:34
although i don't think david bowie
37:36
actually said it is that he used to see
37:37
the poster of tom major that was major
37:40
and that was major tom and that was in
37:42
brixton and that was where bowie was at
37:44
the time originally when this is ground
37:46
control to tomatoes
37:53
you will be the prime minister
38:00
okay that's it that's all of our facts
38:02

[Music]
00:12
hello
00:13
and welcome to another episode of no
00:15
such thing as a fish
00:16
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
00:18
qi offices in covent garden
00:20
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
00:22
here with anna chazinski james harkin
00:24
and andrew hunter murray
00:26
and once again we have gathered round
00:27
the microphones with our four favorite
00:29
facts from the last seven days
00:31
and in no particular order here we go
00:33
starting with you
00:34
james harkin okay my fact this week is
00:37
that the fear of lifts
00:39
can be cured by starving the subject and
00:42
forcing them to eat all of their meals
00:44
in lifts
00:47
how long do you have to eat all your
00:49
meals in a lift for
00:50
i think they only did it for a day or
00:52
two but then they checked back on this
00:54
person
00:54
a few years later and it worked and this
00:56
is in an old paper from 1973 that i
00:58
stumbled across this week
01:00
and the paper's called a brief treatment
01:02
of elevator phobia
01:04
and it's by s brentwick and leslie
01:06
sullium
01:07
so what's the idea you would sit inside
01:09
an elevator and
01:10
you'd be distracted what happens is what
01:13
you do is you've got someone who's
01:14
scared of um elevators or lifts
01:16
and you say to them you're not allowed
01:18
to eat for 24 hours
01:20
and they go okay i'm not going to eat
01:21
and you say you're not allowed to drink
01:22
water either and they say okay
01:24
and then you say to them okay well you
01:27
can have something to eat now
01:28
you can have some cornflakes or whatever
01:29
but you can only have it if you're
01:31
inside that lift
01:32
and so they have to go in the lift
01:33
because they're so hungry and then i
01:35
reckon just because they've gone in
01:36
there and they're kind of getting used
01:37
to it then they feel this is insane this
01:39
is like padlocked
01:42
well and then they're okay with being in
01:43
the lift because they're enjoying the
01:45
eating process so
01:46
no because what it is with phobias one
01:48
good way of getting over it is by
01:50
forcing yourself to kind of go to these
01:52
places or see these things
01:54
or touch these things that you're scared
01:55
of and slowly you kind of build up
01:57
resistance and you realize they're not
01:58
maybe as bad as you think
02:00
and you kind of get over it really the
02:02
food is genuinely just to lure them into
02:04
the list
02:04
it really is i mean just pick the guy up
02:06
and put him in i think that might be a
02:08
bit more humane wouldn't that make the
02:09
phobia a bit worse
02:12
well the thing is they think a lot of it
02:14
is something bad has happened that you
02:15
associate with this thing
02:17
and usually it happens when you're
02:18
between four and seven as a child
02:20
and then later on you kind of even if
02:23
it's subconsciously
02:24
you put these two things together and so
02:26
you're scared i'm scared of mushrooms so
02:28
when i was four years old i must have
02:29
been attacked by a mushroom or something
02:31
i don't know playing a lot of mario
02:34
so if i'm scared of spiders do i have to
02:36
eat all my food off a spider
02:38
is that how it's going to work well they
02:41
think that one good way of
02:43
stopping being scared of spiders is by
02:45
to touch spiders so you go to like a zoo
02:47
and they put a tarantula on your hand
02:49
and maybe it makes you feel better
02:50
they call it in vivo exposure but the
02:52
problem is that
02:54
people don't really like to go to the
02:56
spider house and have the spiders put on
02:58
them
02:59
and i was reading an article in
03:00
improvable.com and they said that a way
03:03
of doing this is by
03:04
augmented reality so say you sat in
03:06
front of a computer and you put your
03:08
hand down and there's a camera looking
03:09
at your hand
03:10
the computer makes it look as if there's
03:12
like cockroaches running across your
03:13
hand
03:14
you'll think that they're running across
03:15
your hand when they're not actually
03:17
uh and that can maybe kind of cure you
03:19
of being scared of cockroaches wait why
03:21
is that better than just having the
03:22
cockroaches running over you
03:23
because people don't like to go if they
03:25
see cockroaches they'll just
03:27
freak out but if they put their hand
03:28
down and they're just looking at a
03:30
computer
03:31
then it's easier to get someone in front
03:32
of a computer than in front of a
03:33
cockroach house
03:35
okay really clever because there are
03:36
more computers than cockroach houses for
03:38
once
03:40
way more there's quite an interesting
03:42
theory about
03:43
where phobias come from that scientists
03:45
have just come up with so
03:46
you were saying that it's probably a
03:47
memory that you have maybe a memory that
03:49
you have from childhood yeah maybe but
03:51
in 2013 there was some new research done
03:53
that showed you could sort of inherit
03:54
memories
03:55
from your ancestors no and so yes so
03:58
what happens is uh if one of your
04:00
ancestors had a horrible experience like
04:01
they've been bitten by a spider
04:03
a long long time ago then their response
04:05
to that makes a chemical imprint
04:07
on your dna and that chemical imprint
04:09
can then be passed down
04:10
so then you'll have this phobia so this
04:12
is new new research that was done in
04:13
2013. wow
04:15
this is this why i'm scared of nazis
04:21
that explains your totally irrational
04:22
phobia of the nazi people
04:24
my grandparents had to you know go and
04:25
sort of there's a lot of deprivation
04:27
and i think that's definitely true in
04:29
mice isn't it they showed that that was
04:31
true in mice yes
04:32
i'm not sure it's true in humans yeah
04:34
it's weird that that can be imprinted on
04:36
into dna yeah so it's quite amazing into
04:39
my sperm
04:39
the fact that i was attacked by a dog my
04:42
sperm
04:43
will have that knowledge as it goes
04:45
across yeah i mean not the fact you're
04:47
not gonna have a grandchild who's like
04:48
hey i remember this weird time in the qi
04:49
offices when a dog bit myself no i know
04:51
but it's the response to that makes a
04:53
chemical imprint yeah that's mad
04:56
yeah is mad um uh fear of clowns that's
05:00
a big thing
05:00
cooler phobia uh yes exactly
05:04
sorry i thought you were saying it was a
05:05
cool phobia cooler
05:07
because i was saying it was a fear of
05:08
coolers
05:11
well everyone's confused so what they do
05:13
now um
05:14
circuses are starting to do this they
05:16
have sessions before
05:17
the circus starts where if you're afraid
05:19
of clowns you can go and watch the clown
05:22
do their makeup start from a normal
05:23
person and do their makeup so by the
05:25
time the circus starts
05:26
you feel comfortable with them and they
05:27
call it counseling and use it
05:30
it's true this is true you do counseling
05:32
and you can watch clowns get their
05:34
makeup done
05:34
and it's meant to help you massively to
05:36
see the transformation but it's quite
05:37
obvious that the name preceded the
05:39
actual idea
05:40
so a good method is to starve someone
05:43
for a day
05:43
and then they can only eat custard pies
05:45
[Laughter]
05:49
there was i read a report that for
05:50
people who are afraid of elevators
05:53
in some cases uh they will opt for a job
05:55
that pays less
05:56
if it's in a lower floor of a building
05:59
wow
06:00
so this is the thing otis the uh
06:03
elevated company
06:04
they estimate that every five days the
06:05
equivalent of the entire
06:08
population of the planet uses a lift so
06:10
seven billion
06:11
journeys are made and left every five
06:13
days i think it was even in their lifts
06:15
exactly yes yes so just the brand notice
06:17
not not even a schindler
06:19
i read about an amazing lift that maybe
06:21
the three of you have heard of but i
06:22
hint of and i discovered it i discovered
06:24
a great website called elevatorpedia
06:26
which is just the wikipedia of elevators
06:29
um it's got 492 articles
06:31
9 million registered users over nine
06:33
million uh but yeah uh active users was
06:35
about 22.
06:38
but nine million registered youtubers
06:40
they're just spam bots aren't they
06:41
probably yeah but they're proud uh so
06:44
yeah so i started reading about um i
06:46
pressed random page and just brought
06:48
up different random pages and the first
06:49
one that came up was the double decker
06:51
elevator have you heard of that
06:52
no i like the idea of pressing random
06:54
article and you have to wait 30 seconds
06:56
for it actually
06:59
yeah so um a double deck elevator stops
07:02
at two floors at a time
07:04
so you're able to cut the journey in
07:06
half effectively
07:08
but it's impossible to go from the very
07:10
bottom floor to the very top floor
07:12
because you're yes yeah and vice versa
07:15
you've got a little
07:16
thing on the roof where it just pops out
07:18
oh yeah
07:19
i'm pretty sure that you're either in a
07:21
lift that goes into a
07:22
sort of attic that has no door to let
07:25
you out when the lift below you is
07:26
trying to go
07:26
and there's a basement for the below
07:28
lift to not so yeah
07:30
you can still go to the top floor and
07:31
it's very unsatisfying to get to a floor
07:33
where you're not allowed to get out
07:34
yeah this sounds like almost as terrible
07:36
as what i imagined you were describing
07:38
then when i imagined that they would
07:40
just stop at the same floor on both
07:41
levels and either the lift would open
07:43
you'd have a six foot
07:44
drop as you stepped out or it would open
07:46
and you'd just be faced with the wall
07:47
because you're on the lower level
07:48
yeah i think what we're saying is that
07:50
this isn't a particularly good idea
07:51
it's they're using it in so many
07:53
different countries yeah it's it's
07:55
extremely popular burj khalifa uh has it
07:57
and so do
07:58
a lot of uh taiwan and hong kong and
08:01
japan skyscrapers have it as well
08:03
wow the thing about that is about burj
08:05
al khalifa and that
08:06
is it not the case that lifts can only
08:08
go a certain number of flaws because
08:10
after that the um the cable gets too
08:13
heavy or something well yeah exciting
08:14
times
08:15
in lyft news because they've got a new
08:17
technology which
08:18
means that lifts might be able to go
08:19
twice as far oh really i've got a new
08:21
kind of rope it's called ultra rope and
08:22
it's made of carbon fiber
08:24
and the maximum used to be about 500
08:26
meters but now
08:27
it's much bigger and they reckon that
08:29
this is the only thing preventing us
08:31
from building 2 000 meter high
08:32
skyscrapers
08:35
i've been reading loads of reviews of
08:36
this book called lifted a cultural
08:38
history of the elevator by andreas
08:40
bernard i haven't read the book yet but
08:42
i found one review which started off
08:45
just from a member of the public it said
08:47
this book had its ups and downs and then
08:49
it went on
08:50
now that the joke is out of the way this
08:51
is a very interesting
08:56
so they did have kind of elevator type
08:59
things didn't they but then the first
09:01
modern elevators
09:02
um they came in the 19th century and i
09:05
read that the first
09:06
elevator shaft preceded the first
09:08
elevator by four years
09:11
wow this is on the wikipedia actually
09:13
but i think it
09:14
does stack up and this is just normal
09:16
wikipedia yeah it wasn't lyft no
09:19
no elevator yeah it wasn't in that one
09:21
um
09:22
so this was in um the cooper union
09:25
foundation building in new york in 1853
09:28
and they built it with a lift shaft
09:31
because
09:31
the guy who built it was sure that lifts
09:33
would be invented quite soon
09:35
wow he was so confident oh my god
09:38
and sure enough four years later they
09:39
did invent them but his shaft was
09:41
circular
09:43
uh and all lifts aren't circular and so
09:45
they couldn't fit the lifts in there
09:46
oh no you couldn't fit a square lift in
09:48
a round hole that's interesting
09:50
why could they not just make a circular
09:52
look a bit later otis designed a special
09:54
lift just for that building
09:55
right that's so cool do you know the
09:58
secret override
09:59
for a left if you press
10:02
up down left right some lifts
10:05
which use particular there's a system
10:07
called logic controller
10:08
which is the sort of the brain of the
10:11
lift basically
10:12
if the lift uses logic controller if you
10:14
press your floor and the closed door
10:16
button at the same time
10:17
you can go to whatever floor you like in
10:19
a lift immediately and bypass all the
10:21
others right
10:21
what so this is according to someone on
10:24
the internet who i read who said he
10:26
works in a building with loads of lists
10:27
so he's sorry
10:36
he said that if the list uses this
10:37
system that does work but obviously you
10:39
can't tell that sounds very much like an
10:41
urban myth
10:41
give it a go give it a go listening to
10:43
this but if everyone knows us that when
10:45
you were the guy who walks in and tries
10:47
to do it
10:48
you've now stuck in a lift with someone
10:49
who's going you
10:51
it doesn't work but you tried to ruin my
10:53
lift ride by going past my floor
10:55
if you're already in the lift you can
10:56
just press a button it's for people on
10:57
the outside who requested the lift
10:59
that's an extremely selfish thing to do
11:01
though
11:01
yeah well you might be in a hurry yeah
11:03
okay you might need a piece
11:05
we're not advocating it i'm just saying
11:07
it's a possibility
11:08
andy's a very selfish man the rest of us
11:10
will advise against it
11:11
i want to know if this is a uh if this
11:13
is a myth and i imagine it is people say
11:15
that pressing the close button doesn't
11:16
actually
11:17
there's no consensus on this i swear to
11:20
god uh that
11:21
no one's properly refuted it no people
11:23
on the internet who work in
11:25
andy's lift companies we film a qi in a
11:28
building with a lot of lifts
11:30
and so i realized we had an expert here
11:35
and i pressed the closed door and i
11:36
reckon they do work but maybe not they
11:38
never do in in
11:39
thrillers and in horror movies they're
11:42
always in there
11:42
pressing it like crazy and the lift is
11:44
just chilled it's definitely true that
11:46
there are some
11:47
um road crossings where the button
11:49
doesn't really work yeah because they're
11:50
just on timers especially busy crossings
11:52
i think that the closed door button is
11:53
likely to work on all the lifts before
11:55
health and safety was invented and you
11:57
won't have to just cut people up in
11:59
lifts you know lifts in singapore have
12:01
urine detector devices in them
12:04
and i can't work out whether this is
12:05
because singaporean authorities are
12:07
really paranoid about this or because
12:09
there was a spate of urinating because
12:10
it did say in the 90s
12:11
uh there was in a year there was
12:13
something like 40 incidents of lifts
12:15
opening and there being a puddle of
12:16
urine left in them
12:17
right and so now if you urinate in a
12:20
lift in singapore that has one of these
12:21
devices in it
12:22
then an alarm gets set off the lift
12:24
stops so you're stuck in the elevator
12:26
the police are called
12:27
and they come round and then start the
12:28
lift so that you can get out and be
12:29
arrested by the police for weighing in
12:30
an elevator
12:31
wow so don't do that how can it tell
12:34
that it's urine these
12:35
urine detectors what if i spilled my
12:37
bottle of water for example
12:39
and it had like a lot of kind of urea in
12:41
it yeah yeah i like all my water
12:43
buy water from different outlets
12:47
yeah i think you can just tell people
12:48
that you've got urine detection devices
12:50
and i think that will deal with the
12:51
majority
12:52
of characters right it's like that stuff
12:53
they don't put in swimming pools yeah
12:55
isn't it
12:56
it's like an ink that turns color when
12:58
you pee in the pool
12:59
is that not actually in there no it
13:00
doesn't exist oh my god i always get so
13:02
worried when i actually do have a piss
13:03
and waiting for a color to emerge and
13:05
then i wonder if there's something wrong
13:06
with my peers
13:07
go to the doctor i'm really worried my
13:08
piss isn't blue
13:13
[Music]
13:16
okay it is time for fact number two and
13:18
that is my fact
13:19
my fact this week is that the russian
13:21
space agency
13:22
light their rockets using giant wooden
13:25
matchsticks
13:27
so this is to me unbelievable
13:31
but it's real this is from popular
13:32
mechanics uh so it's been verified
13:35
and the idea is that the soyuz rockets
13:37
when they're going up so this is not for
13:38
every single
13:39
rocket that they launch however it's
13:41
been used hundreds of times uh and the
13:43
idea is that
13:44
you need a consistency there's so many
13:46
booster rockets you need a consistency
13:48
of all of them to go to be lit at the
13:49
same time and something needs to light
13:51
them
13:51
so what they've created are these giant
13:54
bits of birchwood all
13:55
put together created into effectively a
13:58
giant looking match
13:59
they're sat underneath the boosters they
14:01
all have little wiring that goes right
14:03
to the top and the problem is obviously
14:05
as the fire picks up the wiring gets cut
14:07
off so the idea of using the wood is to
14:09
keep it
14:10
lit like a match to have the wood just
14:12
flaming up
14:13
and so they can light all these rockets
14:15
at the same time and then that's how it
14:16
goes into space
14:18
giant matchsticks it's nuts it's very
14:20
good it's so old-fashioned they've been
14:22
doing that for
14:22
60 years wow yeah i read that it's the
14:25
only part of a modern
14:26
rocket launch system that's made of wood
14:29
oh really
14:30
yeah unsurprisingly i suppose yeah
14:32
reassuringly
14:35
um did you guys know that the first
14:36
lighters were guns
14:38
so they were flintlock guns and they
14:41
were
14:42
converted to the purpose of becoming
14:43
lighters in the 16th century
14:45
so flintlock guns are any firearm that
14:48
uses flint
14:48
uh to strike up and create a flame which
14:51
would propel the bullets out of it
14:53
and people realized that you could turn
14:54
this ignition mechanism into a lighter
14:56
and that was the world's first lighters
14:57
wow
14:58
how cool is that and they're like big
14:59
hardcore looking guns it is cool because
15:01
then you get the actual
15:02
lighters today that look like guns but
15:04
aren't really guns exactly yeah
15:06
this was the original one of those for
15:08
the real cowboys there were novelty
15:09
lighters before there were lighters but
15:11
that's what we're saying
15:13
that's exactly what i'm saying i found
15:16
one of the earliest references to
15:18
matchsticks
15:19
from ancient china and they were
15:20
originally in their translation
15:22
described as light-bringing slaves
15:26
that was their name and they were they
15:27
were from a book called
15:29
the records of unworldly sorry records
15:31
of the unworldly and the strange
15:33
which is a great title for a book and
15:34
i've never heard of that before it's an
15:36
old ancient
15:37
chinese book and that's where it comes
15:39
from yeah the old chinese ones they had
15:40
sulfur on the end of them didn't they
15:42
but you had to light them from another
15:44
light
15:45
basically you needed another fire source
15:47
in order to light them so i don't know
15:48
if that counts as much
15:49
oh okay yeah cheating yeah definitely
15:52
cheating sulfur was used in the
15:54
19th century matches as well and that
15:56
was where matches really took off and so
15:58
you've got match factories and match
15:59
girls and things like this
16:00
yeah um the problem with matches in the
16:02
first place was that they would
16:04
they were very easy to light and so they
16:06
would set fires and things like this
16:08
um but in 1844 the safety match was
16:10
invented it was by a swedish professor
16:12
called pash
16:13
and what he did was he just split up the
16:15
chemicals that you needed to
16:17
set the match of flame so the phosphorus
16:19
that you did need he just put on that's
16:21
what's on the surface of the box
16:23
so you you have to combine the two
16:24
elements which had originally been both
16:26
in the match head together oh wow
16:28
and that was why i said it ignited so
16:31
easily
16:31
it's because it's all there ready for
16:33
you whereas this is guaranteed
16:35
so what could because before that i
16:36
think if because it was all together if
16:38
you just sort of accidentally rubbed
16:39
your match up against any surface what
16:40
it is
16:41
so you get people sort of striking it on
16:43
you know jeans or stubble yeah
16:45
or whatever yeah so these dodgy ones
16:47
were the ones invented by the guy from
16:49
stockton called john walker
16:50
uh and they were banned in france and
16:52
germany because they were so dangerous
16:54
and they were giant matches as well so
16:56
the first few proper matches were giant
16:57
matches
16:58
they were a yard long what yes well and
17:01
to light them you had to pull
17:02
you've got a fold of sandpaper put the
17:04
match in between there pulled it out
17:06
and it they were so dangerous though
17:08
because often a flaming ball of material
17:10
would fall off the end of the match and
17:12
set fire to the ground
17:14
or the carpet or wherever you or
17:16
someone's dress he was
17:17
he was a good guy though john walker
17:19
because he refused to pay in his matches
17:21
he had a decent amount of money so he he
17:23
really did invent the
17:24
lighting match even though it's a little
17:25
bit dodgy to start with it was based on
17:27
his what he did
17:28
uh that everyone else built their match
17:30
technology and
17:32
he yeah had enough money and said he
17:34
didn't want to patent the invention at
17:36
all
17:36
michael faraday and other people like
17:38
that said that he should get money out
17:39
of it
17:40
he never made a penny and um he never
17:42
got the credit for it until after he
17:43
died
17:43
there was actually a frenchman called
17:45
chancell who came up with one
17:47
20 years before him oh was that yeah and
17:50
that one
17:50
um had an end tipped with potassium
17:52
chlorate and sulfur
17:54
and you had to put acid on it to set
17:56
that one up
17:57
even more dangerous and the one there
18:00
was another frenchman charles sauria who
18:02
invented one very shortly after john
18:03
walker and it relied on phosphorus
18:05
and they kept using the phosphorus in
18:07
this country so it sounds like they
18:08
banned it in other countries
18:09
but in this country they kept using
18:10
phosphorus in matches until 1906.
18:13
is it was incredibly poisonous so
18:15
everyone who worked in those factories
18:16
got this thing called fosse jaw
18:18
which was where your teeth would rot and
18:20
your whole face would swell up and your
18:21
jaw bones would rot
18:23
because the phosphorus was so toxic your
18:24
hair would fall out so anyone who like
18:26
used regularly or worked with making
18:28
these matches
18:29
would just uh they'd fall apart wow and
18:31
i read that it would make you
18:33
vomit even a tiny amount breathing it in
18:35
would make you vomit and
18:36
you could see the way people walked home
18:38
from the phosphorus factory because
18:40
there would be like pools of
18:42
um fluorescent vomit
18:46
do you know the world matchstick model
18:48
record
18:49
uh what are we going for size or number
18:51
of matches let's say a number of matches
18:54
a million two hundred and eighty
18:56
thousand
18:57
i do know so i'm already choosing for me
18:59
to say it's
19:01
the answer is it's a model of an oil rig
19:04
it's made by a man called david reynolds
19:06
who used to work
19:07
on oil rigs and it contains 4 million
19:10
75 000 matches wow it's
19:14
huge that's amazing it's really good it
19:16
took him over 15 years to make
19:18
i think yeah it's a great use of a life
19:22
no there's other people watch telly in
19:23
the evenings and he just does this you
19:25
know
19:25
yeah it's quite cool but we are not
19:27
suggesting you build the world's biggest
19:28
matchstick thing instead of watching our
19:30
show on fridays
19:32
good point has a little plug there um
19:34
yeah i feel really sorry for his son
19:36
because he said that
19:37
it was just that one christmas his son
19:38
bought him a matchstick kit of a train
19:40
to build a train out of matchsticks
19:42
and that feels really like the sun
19:43
doesn't know what to get his dad i'll
19:44
just get him this who cares he can put
19:46
it in a corner forget about it and i bet
19:47
he really regrets that
19:49
20 years later when all his dad's done
19:51
or talked about
19:52
is the fact that he's built a hundred
19:53
thousand matchstick items or he's
19:55
forever been trying to make up for this
19:56
present that he got
19:57
by going no i really love it look i'm
19:59
making my next thing look i'm gonna make
20:01
like
20:01
right he hates it so there are the
20:03
guinness has
20:05
two other matchstick related world
20:06
records okay let's hear them
20:08
most matchsticks stacked into a tower in
20:10
one minute
20:11
yeah great um let's say one a second 60.
20:15
very close 59 not bad
20:18
4 million it's seven
20:22
it's uh it's 74. wow yeah and the other
20:25
one this is the one which i think is
20:26
most beatable possibly
20:27
it's the largest collection of musical
20:29
instruments made from matchsticks
20:30
okay which is about it's about 10. i
20:33
know i'm getting you for your next
20:34
birthday
20:35
11 kits yeah um i've just got a couple
20:38
of things
20:39
on i've been looking into uh odd ways
20:42
things are lit
20:43
so i suddenly thought how do you like
20:44
the olympic torch what what's the
20:46
process there and um
20:48
so probably we all know it's lit in
20:50
olympia it's got a classic
20:51
kind it actually is a flame that goes
20:53
there but i had no idea how much
20:55
backup flame that they have should it go
20:57
out have you heard about this
20:59
i thought it pretty much went out all
21:00
the time yes it does they have
21:02
backup flame that they've brought with
21:04
them from olympia from the very same
21:05
fire and they re-light it using that
21:07
exact flame
21:08
so the flame is broken up into all
21:10
different little compartments
21:12
so that it can be re-lit with the
21:14
original flame wait so what are they
21:15
storing the flame on there there's lots
21:16
of other people holding back up olympic
21:17
torches they're in
21:19
buses and stuff that cat that travel
21:21
with them yeah
21:23
yeah you can see a photo so when they
21:25
leave olympia they take
21:27
live flame on the planes over to where
21:30
they're going
21:31
so you can see there's a photo of
21:32
british airways where two seats have
21:34
live flames
21:35
four capsules of live flames they're
21:37
obviously got a lid on them
21:38
um and they carry that by i think that's
21:41
the only live flame that you're allowed
21:42
to take on a plane i just think
21:44
that backup olympic flame thing is the
21:47
stupidest thing i've ever it's so
21:49
it doesn't matter it's a flame it's it's
21:51
symbolic i guess that's what they're
21:53
going it's symbolic and
21:54
invented by the nazis as well was it i
21:56
think so fire
21:59
no i think they invented the idea of
22:01
like um
22:02
a olympic flame relay yeah i think
22:04
you're right um i've got such a cool
22:06
thing
22:06
about fire making fire uh just do you
22:09
guys know about the new fire ceremony
22:11
that the aztecs had
22:13
no um this was this so that the aztec
22:15
calendar cycle was every 52 years and at
22:17
the end of every 52 years
22:19
the aztecs uh ordered that all fires in
22:22
the whole aztec empire were extinguished
22:25
and they had to start again
22:26
so every single person after 52 years
22:27
had to put out their fire and then they
22:29
go
22:29
on top of this on top of this mountain
22:31
and a priest would light the first fire
22:33
for the new calendar cycle in what was
22:35
called the new fire ceremony and what he
22:37
did was he'd light it inside the chest
22:38
cavity
22:39
of a sacrificed person so they'd
22:41
sacrifice someone they take them up to
22:43
the top of this mountain they open up
22:44
their chest
22:45
and then the aztec priest lights a fire
22:47
inside his chest
22:48
and then he'd a bunch of people would be
22:50
allowed to come forward and dip their
22:52
sticks in this
22:52
in the
23:00
wow and then the fire would be
23:01
distributed throughout the empire again
23:03
and that marked the start of their new
23:04
calendar
23:06
wow
23:08
okay it is time for fact number three
23:10
and that is andy
23:12
my fact is that the film who framed
23:14
roger rabbit is based on a true story
23:16
okay a heartwarming story of a rabbit um
23:20
no so it's loosely based but it is based
23:22
on an actual story of something that
23:24
happened in america in
23:25
uh in the early 20th century so can you
23:27
explain to me what happens in who frame
23:29
roger rabbit because i haven't seen it
23:31
it's very complicated but basically
23:33
there's a transport conspiracy you don't
23:35
want to give away all the spoilers of
23:37
the film
23:37
but and it's it's about you know the car
23:40
and about and there's a giant rabbit
23:41
isn't there
23:42
he's not a giant rabbit he's obviously
23:43
not i'm thinking of dolly dog no
23:45
he is bigger than a normal rabbit but
23:47
he's not taller than bob hoskins
23:49
well i still think that that's he's in
23:51
between the size of a rabbit and bob
23:54
hoskins if you can imagine such a thing
23:56
okay and he's got a bow tie on how tall
23:59
would you say he is
23:59
taller than four feet yeah i think that
24:02
that counts as a very big rabbit with
24:04
ears upright he's probably taller than
24:05
bob hoskins
24:07
no i don't think he is no no he's not he
24:09
never is taller than bob hoskins even he
24:11
was poised really
24:12
and bob hoskins was a very short man
24:14
exactly perhaps it is normal rabbit size
24:16
yeah
24:19
anyway i think we're this isn't the true
24:21
element of the story
24:22
um it sounds like a great film actually
24:24
it is a really good film watch it
24:25
um but basically the story that it's
24:27
based on is is the thing that actually
24:28
happened it's a group of
24:30
car and oil companies they were called
24:32
national city lines right and it was
24:34
controlled by general motors
24:35
and the thing they did in the early
24:37
years of the 20th century they bought up
24:38
loads of streetcar lines so these
24:40
streetcars with rails
24:42
trolleybuses things like this all across
24:45
america they bought these
24:46
up and they uh dismantled them and shut
24:48
them off and they also ran a lot of
24:50
buses
24:50
so as an automobile buses running on
24:53
roads as opposed to running on rails
24:55
and they were eventually fined a huge
24:58
amount for
24:59
uh kind of monopolizing attempting to
25:01
monopolize the market for transport
25:03
equipment
25:04
right so some people think that this was
25:07
a huge conspiracy designed to
25:09
create the age of the car and to shut
25:12
down public transport in favor of
25:14
cars because there was it was oil and
25:16
car companies that were doing this
25:18
yeah it's a bit more complicated than
25:19
that because the streetcar industry was
25:21
already in decline and it's also a lot
25:22
easier to run a bus
25:24
which doesn't need a rail than it is to
25:25
run a streetcar i'm glad you debunked
25:27
that popular misconception
25:31
this is absolutely huge and loads of
25:32
people still believe it it's i think in
25:34
america it's a really big
25:36
sort of it's a really big idea that the
25:37
age of the car was stitched up by a load
25:40
of these companies
25:41
i gotta say roger rabbit didn't really
25:42
do justice to the seriousness of the uh
25:44
[Laughter]
25:46
although i think it's based on i am
25:48
starting to understand why they felt the
25:49
need to add cartoon characters to live
25:51
another story
25:53
just uh just to give a quick uh proper
25:56
background on roger rabbit as a movie
25:58
um it was robert zemeckis who directed
26:00
it which was the back to the future
26:01
director it came out in 1988
26:03
and the technology of the animation
26:05
mixed with real life
26:07
uh footage was so advanced so new
26:10
that the very same year that was made or
26:12
let's say the oscars that
26:14
happened post the movie's release
26:16
recognized its animator richard williams
26:18
as an innovator and gave him a special
26:20
oscar like just a completely separate
26:22
special oscar to say
26:23
this movie has changed everything for
26:25
filmmaking with animation
26:26
so it's a really important movie in the
26:28
history of cinema also
26:30
it's the only film where looney tunes
26:33
characters
26:33
and disney cartoon characters appear in
26:36
the same films that was very rare to see
26:38
for example mickey mouse and um
26:41
and they insisted both companies
26:43
insisted that their characters have
26:45
exactly equal amount of screen time as
26:46
the other company's characters didn't
26:47
they and that was why
26:48
and like i say i haven't seen it but
26:50
apparently
26:52
bugs bunny so wherever you see uh warner
26:54
brothers character that's accompanied by
26:56
a disney character so i think are there
26:58
two pairings of characters in the film
27:00
uh and the pairings are always a warner
27:01
brothers character and a disney
27:02
character because both companies said if
27:04
your guy's getting screen time my guy's
27:05
gonna get screen time yeah cause roger
27:07
rabbit was looney tunes and bob hoskins
27:08
is of course a disney
27:10
cartoon character yeah so one thing
27:12
that's interesting about this is that
27:14
it mustn't necessarily be the movie that
27:17
was based on real life stuff because
27:18
roger rabbit was based off
27:20
a novel called who censored roger rabbit
27:22
which was written by gary k
27:23
wolfe very dark and very different to
27:26
the had no looney tune characters for
27:28
example
27:29
um so that i'm i'm wondering if that's
27:31
where the original
27:32
political message about uh what you were
27:35
so interestingly talking about
27:40
that's beyond the pale did you
27:44
did you see that bill murray was the
27:45
first choice to play the bob hoskins
27:47
character
27:48
he's too tall he was just that bit
27:51
bigger than a rabbit
27:52
you make the rabbit look like a rabbit
27:55
um he no they couldn't get hold of him
27:57
because you know bill murray has that
27:58
famous thing where he refuses to have an
28:00
agent oh really and so he was robert
28:02
zemeckis and steven spielberg's first
28:03
choice they couldn't get hold of him and
28:05
bill murray said afterwards it was a
28:06
real regret and he wished he could have
28:07
done it and it does make you think well
28:09
get a starting agent then mate
28:10
but um yeah he said they went with bob
28:12
hoskins instead
28:13
right um i did read reviews for who
28:15
censored roger abbott the first one and
28:17
it's got my favorite
28:18
uh opening line of a review of a review
28:20
here this person said
28:22
this would have been a decent airplane
28:23
book but i wasn't flying anywhere
28:25
[Laughter]
28:27
and there's a lot of differences like in
28:29
the book roger rabbit actually is killed
28:31
and they have a really interesting
28:32
literary device where cartoon characters
28:34
are able
28:35
to create a doppelganger of themselves
28:37
immediately to do stunt double work in
28:38
movies
28:39
so in the novel roger rabbit is killed
28:41
but he creates a doppelganger
28:43
who can last a few days the longest
28:45
double ganger of any of them who helped
28:47
the story the rules of cartoons are very
28:49
different to the rules of real life
28:50
aren't they
28:51
what yeah i think my plans for jumping
28:53
off that building later
28:55
this i haven't seen who framed roger
28:58
rabbit but i think they kind of explore
28:59
this in the film don't they
29:01
uh there's a thing called the
29:03
o'donnell's laws of cartoon motion
29:06
which was in esquire and there are a few
29:08
like rules that
29:10
happen in cartoons which don't happen in
29:11
real life so anybody suspended in space
29:14
will remain in space until made aware of
29:16
its situation
29:17
yeah yeah that kind of thing yeah
29:19
everything falls faster than
29:20
an anvil is another one okay and the
29:23
idea being that if you're falling down
29:24
and so is nanville
29:25
you'll hit the floor and then the amber
29:27
will hit your head
29:30
and there was a guy called art babbitt
29:32
who was an animator from walt disney
29:33
studios and he said
29:35
animation follows the laws of physics
29:36
unless it's funnier otherwise
29:39
and i think they mentioned that in the
29:40
movie as well don't they something
29:41
similar to that
29:42
yeah and they've got things like you
29:43
know tunnels that you throw onto walls
29:45
and then you can run into the tunnel but
29:47
you know you can't follow them you sort
29:49
of you
29:49
if you follow as a human you hit the
29:50
wall yeah this kind of thing yeah
29:53
so bob hoskin's son didn't speak to him
29:54
for a while after he made her frame
29:56
roger rabbit do you know why
29:59
it was because so his son jack was three
30:01
at the time and hoskins said in an
30:02
interview a few years ago that um
30:04
when his son jack found out what he'd
30:05
been working on he wouldn't speak to him
30:07
for a long time
30:08
and hoskins was really upset and after
30:10
about two weeks his son
30:11
uh admitted that the reason he wasn't
30:13
speaking to him was because he'd been
30:14
working with bugs bunny and daffy duck
30:16
the whole time and hadn't even
30:17
introduced him to them oh
30:18
amazing that's great
30:24
okay it is time for a final fact of the
30:26
show and that is chezinski
30:28
my fact is that the first ever
30:30
wristwatch doubled up as a thermometer
30:33
um yeah i just really like this it's
30:35
like a modern day gadget but
30:36
what sort of thermometer as in
30:42
or as james says rectal it was a whistle
30:45
a ristol thermometer oh there's a little
30:48
thermometer on the well
30:50
you have to shove your wrist up your
30:51
butt
30:53
it was designed for very flexible people
30:55
so this was a watch that was designed by
30:57
abraham louis breg bregway who was known
31:00
as the father of modern horology he was
31:02
sort of
31:02
the leading uh person in watchmaking in
31:06
clock making and watchmaking at the turn
31:08
of the 19th century
31:09
and one of the things he did work out
31:12
how to do
31:13
was to stop changes in the temperature
31:15
altering
31:16
a clock mechanism so watches at the time
31:18
pocket watches because risk watchers
31:20
didn't exist yet
31:21
watches at the time if the temperature
31:23
change would be a bit disrupted by that
31:24
so
31:24
you could only guarantee that your watch
31:26
would be correct within about two hours
31:28
at the end of the 18th century and he
31:31
created a little thing
31:32
like a thermostat inside watches which
31:34
would work out when the temperature
31:35
got to a certain point and adjust the
31:37
watch accordingly and so he thought well
31:39
i'll just add a little thermometer in
31:40
things i'm
31:41
sensing the temperature anyway and so he
31:43
made this watch and it was for
31:45
napoleon's sister actually the queen of
31:47
naples she was called caroline murat
31:50
and he made it in 1810 uh started making
31:52
it in 1810 and he delivered to her in
31:54
1812
31:56
and yeah it was the first ever
31:57
wristwatch and the bracelet was made of
31:59
a thread of hair
32:00
and a little bit of gold thread a thread
32:03
of hair a few threads of hair
32:05
yeah it was made of hair lots of threads
32:07
of hair
32:08
more than one thread she had a thick
32:09
hair oh my god um
32:11
i find it amazing how wrist watches were
32:13
seen as really
32:15
sort of effeminate and not suitable for
32:17
proper men was the basic implication for
32:20
loads of their history it was only in in
32:23
the first world war they really took off
32:25
because it was very important for
32:26
officers to be able to
32:27
consult the same time and also pocket
32:29
watchers are pretty impractical in the
32:30
trenches
32:31
i read an article in the um atlantic
32:33
about the history of the wristwatch
32:35
and they said that someone at the time
32:37
when
32:38
they first became popular after the war
32:40
someone said vaudeville artists and
32:42
moving picture
32:43
actors have utilized it as a fun maker
32:46
as a silly ass
32:47
fad yeah silly ass fad the women's watch
32:51
fools did you guys know about repeaters
32:53
on watches because i didn't really
32:55
understand what they were until i was
32:56
really up on this no
32:57
so this was a technology that was found
33:00
on watches at
33:01
the turn of the 19th century it was on
33:02
this watch that breguet gave to
33:05
um gave to the queen of naples and what
33:08
it was it was a way of telling the time
33:09
in the dark
33:10
if you wanted to tell the time but it
33:12
was dark so you couldn't see a watch
33:13
you would press a little button on it
33:15
and it would an alarm would go off that
33:17
would tell you the hour
33:18
and then how many quarters past the hour
33:21
you passed
33:21
so you could tell the time to within a
33:23
quarter of an hour so if it was let's
33:24
say
33:25
5 30 it would give five chimes in a
33:28
certain deep tone and then it would give
33:30
two times in a in a lighter tone which
33:32
would show you it was five o'clock
33:34
and then two quarter hours had passed
33:35
that's right and all the watches at this
33:36
time had this this quarter repeater
33:38
thing
33:38
or a half repeater which would give it
33:40
to obviously within half an hour
33:41
that's amazing yeah really cool yeah i
33:44
was at the design museum
33:45
last year and they had a watch a
33:47
wristwatch for blind people
33:49
which was um if i remember rightly it
33:52
just kind of looked like a normal face
33:54
but it had these little marbles on it
33:56
and they were magnetic and they moved
33:57
around depending on the time so you
33:59
could kind of feel
34:00
like a braille a braille watch yeah
34:02
that's amazing it didn't look really
34:03
cool that's awesome
34:04
that's really incredible i was reading
34:06
about what we used to do before we had
34:08
watches and clocks
34:09
um because obviously i know about the
34:10
sundial but i was just thinking
34:12
like what if you just didn't if you went
34:14
further back and uh what people used to
34:16
do and spots of africa used to do this
34:18
you would just
34:19
you would know the the ark of the sun
34:21
throughout the day
34:22
you'd know where it would pass and so
34:24
what you would do is you would point to
34:26
a bit of the sky
34:27
and say let's meet when the sun's there
34:30
in the sky
34:31
when it's reached that bit of the sky
34:33
and because they know the mapping of how
34:34
the sun goes across
34:36
so well they would just know to look up
34:38
and go oh yeah it's
34:39
effectively four o'clock i better go and
34:41
meet mike
34:42
now that's that's how it works yeah was
34:44
it not confusing though because if you
34:46
point and you say let's meet
34:47
there and you point it somewhere would
34:49
people go do you mean
34:50
then at that time or there in that place
34:53
you're pointing to the sky
34:55
unless it was a really mountainous
34:56
region yeah i guess you were
34:59
so you just turned to the top of mount
35:00
kilimanjaro yeah
35:02
you're like where is mike oh no he must
35:04
have meant four o'clock
35:07
i'm so embarrassed um so this reminds me
35:10
of uh
35:10
something that we've covered on qi which
35:12
is about how it was hard actually to
35:14
know the exact time
35:15
uh in the 19th century even most people
35:17
didn't have watches and there was one
35:18
family in london
35:20
who for 100 years made a living out of
35:22
letting people look at their watches
35:24
which is so cool this is this woman
35:27
called
35:28
ruth belleville and her parents and her
35:30
father started the company in 1836 they
35:33
worked in greenwich
35:34
and so he'd set his watch to greenwich
35:35
time at the start of the day and then
35:37
you get what's described as a buggy
35:38
which i'm not sure what that was in 1836
35:40
and he'd drive around london and he'd
35:42
have people on contracts who
35:44
would pay him in exchange for him
35:45
telling them the time and she kept doing
35:47
that she did it up until 1940.
35:49
yeah i think you could kind of get
35:50
season tickets from them as well
35:52
couldn't you like it be a bit cheaper
35:53
and they'd come every week or something
35:55
oh good job there was a guy called mr
35:58
saint john nguyen
36:00
who in 1908 wrote to the times saying
36:03
that
36:03
her methods were completely out of date
36:05
and it was ridiculous and
36:07
he suggested that she was using her
36:09
femininity to gain business maybe she
36:12
kept the watch in a cleavage or
36:13
something like that
36:14
something a bit saucy did the lester the
36:17
time say dear the times
36:19
you of all newspapers should know that
36:22
[Laughter]
36:25
this guy uh sorry this guy sir john wynn
36:27
he was the director of standard time
36:29
company
36:30
who happened to be one of her like
36:31
biggest kind of competitors
36:34
did they make watches they were the
36:36
people who were supposedly
36:38
start in charge of standard time in
36:40
london okay yeah okay
36:41
makes sense yeah but it gave her massive
36:43
publicity that's what they said off the
36:44
back of it so actually
36:46
business boomed for her so in your face
36:48
mr
36:49
saint john what's what's you called win
36:52
yeah
36:55
but so in 1936 uh there was a big moment
36:58
for her business
36:59
uh in a bad way which was the telephone
37:00
speaking clock that really stopped a lot
37:03
of business
37:03
but weirdly then it was voiced by a lady
37:05
um and her name was ethel
37:07
kane and ethel kane uh lived in the
37:10
exact same town
37:11
as uh ruth they were they were they were
37:14
virtually next-door neighbors oh i bet
37:16
they never spoke to each other
37:18
what a sitcom there is to be written
37:21
there outskirts of croydon
37:22
is where they both lived wow yeah god
37:25
the tension the tension in that
37:27
neighborhood must have been palpable
37:28
yeah i do think it's amazing that sort
37:30
of just to go back to wrist watches very
37:32
very briefly the the
37:33
sort of it was basically homophobia was
37:36
what it was going on was people were
37:37
saying that people who wear
37:39
wristwatches are effeminate and not so
37:42
not the right sort of people
37:43
so if you had a wristwatch you would be
37:45
called a wristwatch boy
37:47
and people would say this about you and
37:49
it's sort of really in an insulting way
37:50
yeah and there was um so here's
37:52
something from the albuquerque journal
37:53
in may 1914
37:55
the fellow who wears a wristwatch is
37:56
frequently suspected of having lace on
37:58
his lingerie and braiding his hair at
38:00
night
38:01
i mean it's pretty plain and in new
38:03
orleans there was a theater
38:04
uh where there was a play on and they
38:06
said the main character is
38:08
not portrayed by a wristwatch screen
38:10
actor dude but by a man's man
38:12
i'm more surprised of dude being used in
38:14
that sense dude
38:16
yeah dude is 19th century i think it was
38:17
a cattle ranching word yeah yeah yeah
38:19
wow
38:19
um but basically it took the first world
38:21
war uh to
38:22
to shift that perception should we wrap
38:24
up soonish yeah there's a really cool
38:26
story
38:27
it relates to wristwatches and the
38:28
original guy in this fact
38:30
and this is about the mari-antoinette
38:31
watch which was another watch that
38:33
um abraham louis breguet made so this
38:36
was commissioned by
38:37
a guy who fancied mary antoinette in
38:39
1782
38:41
and it was completed by bregge's son in
38:44
1827
38:45
44 years after it had been ordered 34
38:48
years after mary antoinette had died in
38:49
four years after he'd actually died
38:51
but it was unbelievably complicated so
38:53
it's still
38:54
the fifth considered the fifth most
38:56
complicated watch ever made
38:58
um it was really really beautiful and it
39:00
was handed down various generations and
39:01
it ended up in the
39:02
uh maya museum of islamic art in
39:04
jerusalem in 1983
39:07
where it got stolen in that year and so
39:09
there was a big police hunt no one could
39:11
find where it was this original watch
39:12
made for mary antoinette and then this
39:14
guy called nicholas hayek who was the
39:16
ceo of the swatch group
39:17
which had taken over the breguet company
39:20
said in 1999 that he was determined that
39:22
they'd make a replica
39:23
and so he went about making this replica
39:25
and that even took a few years
39:26
so that was commissioned in 2004 and
39:29
just before the replica was about to be
39:31
completed and displayed then a lawyer in
39:34
america got
39:35
a letter from a woman who said that she
39:38
had to return a bunch of objects that
39:40
her husband had left in his will
39:41
saying that he'd stolen them decades
39:43
earlier and one of those objects was the
39:45
marie antoinette
39:46
watch and so just as this replica was
39:48
about to reappear
39:49
the watch itself surfaced wow how great
39:52
is that
39:56
okay that's it that's all of our facts
39:58

01:22
again we have gathered around the
01:23
microphones with our four favorite facts
01:25
from the last seven days
01:27
and in no particular order here we go
01:29
starting with my fact
01:30
my fact this week is that heart surgeons
01:33
now perform
01:34
surgery while wearing 3d glasses
01:37
3d glasses like the ones you get in the
01:40
cinema they're slightly they're slightly
01:41
more modern but they're
01:42
they are 3d glasses did they get other
01:44
special effects as well
01:46
like does someone blow in their faces
01:47
while they're doing that or spray a bit
01:49
of water
01:50
because then that's a 4d operating
01:51
experience that's true yeah
01:54
the reason they do this is because with
01:56
heart surgery a lot of the way that they
01:57
do heart surgery now is
01:59
via camera going in because they can't
02:01
get into such delicate spots
02:02
so they have to watch it on a camera and
02:04
so it's really hard to know if you're
02:06
further than you think you are or if
02:08
you're not close enough it's just hard
02:09
to get perception
02:10
so what they realized that they could do
02:12
is by adding a 3d camera to the thing
02:15
that goes into the body
02:16
you could then wear the 3d glasses and
02:18
you would have total
02:19
immersive and proper experience of a 3d
02:22
operation
02:22
it's insane plus you look awesome these
02:25
aren't the old red and green ones are
02:26
they
02:27
so they're slightly more modern so yeah
02:29
i have been to the cinema i'd like to
02:30
clarify since 2005.
02:32
so we said that but even the ones at the
02:34
cinema they actually can reduce the
02:35
brightness of the screen by up to
02:36
eighty-eight percent so they would have
02:38
to light it quite yeah yeah well maybe
02:40
that's the modification but when they
02:41
used to do it with the 2d
02:43
normal operations uh it would take
02:45
something like
02:46
two hours longer or four hours longer
02:48
because it was so hard you had to be so
02:50
careful
02:50
and now with these glasses they can do
02:52
things at twice the speed they have the
02:54
time of what the operation should be so
02:56
it's just
02:56
yeah it's it's amazing well the whole 3d
02:58
thing is a very interesting area anyway
03:00
because i remember years ago a few years
03:02
ago hearing andy neyman got about this
03:03
because
03:03
andy diamond the magician and writer
03:05
he's a huge fan of 3d movies
03:07
and he was saying that 3d was kind of
03:09
brought into cinemas
03:11
as a way of fighting back against new
03:13
technologies that the cinemas were
03:14
worried that people stopped going to the
03:15
cinema so like in the 1950s it was
03:16
because of the rise of television
03:18
in the 1970s and early 80s because of
03:20
video coming along
03:21
and in the modern age was because of you
03:23
know computers and the internet and that
03:24
sort of thing and people would go oh my
03:26
god people aren't going to go to the sin
03:27
anymore so 3d kept coming back as a
03:28
gimmick over and over again but now
03:30
they've spent so much money on the
03:31
infrastructure
03:32
we can't get rid of it now wow we're
03:35
kind of stuck with it yeah
03:36
these people should have watched more
03:37
knockoff dvds and realized most of them
03:38
the sound is out of sync with the
03:40
visions and it cuts off halfway through
03:41
anyway so cinemas are safe
03:45
if you go to the cinema and you hate
03:46
watching 3d movies but you happen to be
03:49
in a 3d movie
03:50
you can now buy and it's been for a
03:52
while 2d glasses
03:54
that turn a 3d movie back into 2d
03:57
yeah so this is on if you go to
04:00
2dhyphenglasses.com
04:01
you can now buy these glasses and it's
04:03
basically the guy who invented them
04:05
uh his wife hated going to 3d movies so
04:07
he invented it so that she would still
04:09
come to the movies but get the 2d
04:10
experience
04:12
i was looking into this a bit more
04:13
looking at a few medical papers about
04:15
this and apparently there's 12 percent
04:16
of people who can't see 3d
04:17
anyway when they're wearing the glasses
04:19
yeah why is it quite surprising is that
04:21
due to
04:21
visual impairment impairment it's just
04:24
that the rotten cones in their eyes
04:25
can't pick it up very clearly
04:27
wow so these are people with 20 20. yeah
04:29
they're otherwise you've got good vision
04:30
amazing the other thing is the rods and
04:31
cones in your eyes
04:33
they discovered last year your eyes
04:35
actually do see 3d separately
04:38
so your eyes can actually see each eye
04:39
can actually see 3d on its own but
04:42
when that's combined with parallax which
04:44
is where you're seeing it from two
04:45
slightly different viewpoints from each
04:46
eye
04:47
that gives you perfect 3d vision so they
04:49
don't reckon that the 3d vision that we
04:50
see in cinemas is
04:51
actually anywhere near as close to real
04:53
3d vision anyway that's really amazing
04:56
because we obviously just think the only
04:58
reason we see 3d is because we've got
04:59
two well that's the parallax thing is
05:00
that you see things from two slightly
05:02
viewpoints your brain
05:03
superimposes them but apparently each
05:04
one of your eyes can actually
05:06
detect 3d anywhere on its own apparently
05:08
there are three or four different things
05:09
that come together to give us 3d vision
05:10
and and a couple of those we've got
05:12
anyway because even if you shut one eye
05:13
you've still got a fairly good idea of
05:14
how far things are away
05:16
yeah it's only when things get close to
05:17
your eye like you're trying to throw a
05:19
needle that it all goes completely
05:21
to pot oh wow yeah so i was distracted
05:24
because anna was
05:24
launching her hand into her own face i
05:26
was practicing my one-eyed 3d vision
05:28
and all it's made me think is i'm really
05:30
short-sighted in my left eye
05:31
i was looking into surgical innovations
05:34
oh yeah the things that
05:35
surgeons are doing now that are
05:37
improving medicine
05:38
um and i've been corresponding with a
05:40
couple of doctors
05:41
who have told me amazing things and i
05:44
just wanted to mention them they're
05:45
called peter brindley and martin bead
05:46
well no this isn't about personal
05:48
ailments or anything is it no it's like
05:50
although they've assured me it will
05:51
clear up in four to six weeks if i keep
05:52
putting the ointment on
05:53
um okay get this there are to train
05:57
surgeons
05:58
um one thing you can do is simulate
06:00
smells
06:01
for them smells of particular things in
06:02
an operating room
06:04
so there are cookbooks available online
06:07
where you can cook up the smell of
06:10
internal organs or cerebral spinal fluid
06:13
or whatever it might be
06:14
to sort of to train surgeons more
06:16
effectively for when they actually get
06:18
in there and are operating wow
06:20
yeah that's cool why is identifying a
06:21
smell well identifying
06:23
smells useful medically is it to
06:25
identify a disease so yeah
06:27
a lot of people could diagnose by going
06:29
oh okay you've chat yourself
06:32
um i was reading there was an interview
06:34
there was an article on cracks written
06:36
by a surgeon
06:37
saying some uh some secrets of the trade
06:39
and he
06:40
was recounting so he recounted two quite
06:42
amusing things uh one was that
06:44
at one point a man woke up while he was
06:46
restarting his heart um because they'd
06:48
have to give him
06:49
i think a dose of adrenaline to get his
06:50
heart going and maybe it was too much
06:51
the man woke up
06:53
and uh this surgeon said when he saw a
06:54
resident elbow deep in his organs he
06:56
gave us the exact look you picture
06:58
somebody having when they wake up to
06:59
find a stranger's hands inside their
07:00
chest
07:03
we all know that that's like the
07:04
opposite of a metaphor
07:07
that's exactly like we were doing the
07:08
thing that we were doing
07:11
yeah i read a few articles about doctors
07:14
revealing secrets about surgery and
07:15
stuff one weird one i wish i wrote it
07:17
down this is just going from memory but
07:19
about how uh with every surgery for if
07:21
you're a man getting surgery
07:23
they have to hold and squeeze the penis
07:26
um
07:26
just to make sure there's no urine in it
07:32
if that's the excuse he gave you where
07:34
were you at the time if you weren't in
07:36
hospitals
07:38
he said he was a doctor my mum's never
07:40
going to consent to another general
07:42
anesthetic now she knows this is
07:43
outrageous
07:44
yeah i don't know how they get it out of
07:45
the ladies actually yeah
07:47
they probably have a doctor to pick him
07:48
up and shake him a bit and then put him
07:50
back down
07:52
uh i did read some stuff about i mean
07:54
you talk about keyhole surgery earlier
07:55
yeah there have been a number of
07:57
scientific papers people looking at
07:58
whether people playing video games gives
08:00
them skills that will make them better
08:01
surgeons in the future
08:02
and there's one particular paper i was
08:04
looking at which was called
08:05
the impact of video games on training
08:07
surges in the 21st century which was
08:09
kind of looking at all the existing
08:11
papers that have been written on it and
08:12
and bringing all the
08:13
the data together and apparently they
08:16
found that
08:16
current video game players made 32 fewer
08:19
errors
08:20
when they were involved in doing
08:22
surgical uh
08:23
work and performed 24 faster it will be
08:26
all that time spent in your bedroom
08:28
uh could mean you're going to be a
08:29
really good keyhole surgeon one day yeah
08:31
because
08:31
you're not allowed to be stoned when you
08:32
perform surgery though so that's that's
08:34
what puts them off
08:35
um the robot thing is cool so there are
08:37
surgeons who now perform operations
08:39
uh routinely from like 400 kilometers
08:41
away from their patients
08:42
aren't there there's this guy called mr
08:45
tickle
08:49
yeah i know there's this guy called
08:50
mehran anvari who does almost all of his
08:52
operations from you know on different
08:53
continents and he just does it but you
08:55
put this sort of console on your head
08:56
it looks like one of those things that
08:58
you know when women get their hair
08:59
permed in hairdressers
09:00
it's like one of those and um then you
09:02
just control that and you're remotely
09:04
headsets yeah exactly but there was one
09:07
uh
09:08
so the i think the most used one is the
09:10
da vinci surgical system and that's
09:12
used in about 200 000 operations
09:14
worldwide and it's a virtual reality
09:15
thing so you stick your head in a
09:17
console
09:17
and you can be in a different room but
09:19
your voice will blast into
09:20
the patient's room while you're on the
09:22
surgery so you can tell the nurses what
09:23
to do
09:27
this is the voice of the surgeon well
09:29
one doctor said
09:30
i've heard one surgeon get carried away
09:32
while doing this and shout
09:34
i'm conan the barbarian
09:36
[Laughter]
09:41
okay it is time to move on to fact
09:44
number two and that is steve
09:46
okay my fact is that one day we may all
09:49
be drinking
09:50
pigeon milk first of all i should say
09:53
that pigeon milk isn't
09:55
milk like we get from cows because birds
09:57
can't lactate
09:58
it's actually produced in the bird's
09:59
crop a little space between the throat
10:02
and the stomach where birds will store
10:03
food sometimes to soften it up before
10:05
swallowing
10:06
but sometimes if they're if they're
10:07
looking after young they can
10:09
keep food in there to regurgitate to the
10:10
young later and there are some species
10:13
of bird pigeons are one of them
10:14
that actually can make a kind of
10:16
secretion in that crop
10:18
to feed the young birds and they
10:20
generally do it when the birds are first
10:21
hatched
10:21
it's a bit like you know in humans you
10:23
get colostrum you get the the stuff that
10:25
mother first produces when babies are
10:26
born
10:27
yeah and it allows the baby to put on
10:28
weight very quickly and it also feeds
10:30
their
10:31
immune system well this stuff does the
10:33
same job and they reckon it's part of
10:34
the reason that pigeons
10:36
are able to survive so well in cities so
10:38
is this why we're going to be drinking
10:39
it
10:39
we need to survive in cities what
10:42
they're saying is that they might be
10:43
able to switch on
10:44
some parts of the dna in pigeon milk and
10:47
put it into other animals milk that we
10:48
do drink which means that milk won't
10:50
taste any different but it'll actually
10:52
boost our immune systems
10:53
oh okay so they sort of secrete it don't
10:55
they pigeons from their
10:57
crop it's like curd if you like
11:00
yeah it's kind of it's like cottage
11:01
cheese texture isn't it yeah exactly
11:03
that's a pretty thick secretion yeah
11:06
weird it's because they have their crop
11:08
is sort of lined with these cells which
11:09
are full of
11:10
fat and those are the cells which
11:12
extrude this uh
11:14
this milk okay right yeah so i was
11:16
looking into birds which produce
11:18
milk you've got pigeons uh where both
11:21
sexes could do it you've got flamingos
11:22
or both sexes can do it and you've got
11:24
penguins emperor penguins only the males
11:26
produce milk oh a feminist society
11:31
basically um but i was looking into the
11:34
flamingo milk because i thought that
11:35
sounds like a cool thing
11:36
and it turns out flamingo milk also pink
11:39
oh yes i was so hoping you would
11:41
say so there's been a load of studies
11:44
done especially at exeter university by
11:45
a guy called paul rose
11:47
everything is pink okay so we all know
11:49
flamingos are pink but the milk is pink
11:50
the inside of a flamingo's egg
11:52
is pink the egg yolk of a flamingo egg
11:55
is pink
11:56
um their skin is pink when they get to
11:58
breeding season they decide
12:00
how they're going to have sex they're
12:01
all hanging around together and one of
12:02
them goes
12:03
deep pink he sort of flushes and if
12:06
if all the other birds start to go pink
12:08
they all start breeding so going pink is
12:10
a way of saying i'm ready to mate with
12:11
you yeah and
12:12
presumably it just depends how
12:13
attractive the flamingo that's gone pink
12:14
is yeah because either all of them do it
12:16
or only one or two of them do it and
12:17
then they feel embarrassed
12:19
okay so the reason they're pink is that
12:21
they eat uh the algae
12:22
and the the um the little shrimp things
12:24
which are which are pink so this is a
12:26
whole species that goes around
12:27
thinking it's a color that it's not and
12:29
it's just because they've got a weird
12:31
diet
12:31
yeah yeah so one day they'll just have a
12:34
new
12:35
food taste or that bacterial die out and
12:37
then they'll go back to their normal
12:38
color and be like
12:39
what yeah why aren't we eating
12:43
flamingo eggs with pink yolk everyday
12:46
because it's harder to store flamingos
12:48
than it is to store chickens
12:50
because you just need slightly taller
12:52
taller buildings
12:54
that's it you can just drill a hole in
12:56
the top for the head to poke out
13:01
you get in trouble for that oh well one
13:03
shot it was either i can't remember
13:04
maybe it was m
13:05
s they sold recently double yolk eggs oh
13:08
yeah yeah yeah
13:09
because about one year one egg and a
13:10
thousand has two yolks here i've never
13:12
had
13:12
how did they find out without opening it
13:14
i think they can scan them wow
13:15
and detect two yolks that's very you say
13:18
wow as if that's the most advanced
13:19
technology
13:20
you've ever heard done they can just use
13:23
an x-ray camera to see inside an egg
13:24
no i just thought it's a lot of effort
13:26
isn't it to buy the scanning machine
13:29
to buy the eggs absolutely give away to
13:31
throw away the other eggs
13:36
thousands 999 eggs were smashed
13:39
useless throw the rest away um
13:42
back to pigeons very quickly uh there's
13:44
a theory
13:45
that pigeons killed a lot of
13:47
tyrannosaurus rex's
13:49
explain the only issue with the pigeon
13:52
is it needed to die in order to kill the
13:53
t-rex
13:54
and that was to be eaten by the t-rex a
13:56
paleontologist called dr steve salisbury
13:58
uh university of queensland has been
14:01
looking into it and he says
14:02
that basically they have evidence of
14:04
avian infectious disease and dinosaurs
14:07
and they noticed it in the back of their
14:09
jaws these little holes in the back of
14:11
their jaws which could only have got
14:12
there by eating something
14:14
and so pigeons could carry this disease
14:16
but they were immune to it
14:18
and so the t-rexes were eating pigeons
14:20
which is an amazing image
14:21
if you think i mean i didn't know how
14:23
far back pigeons went but
14:24
the disease would then carry through to
14:26
their jaw and that would be a bacterial
14:28
infection that just destroyed them
14:30
wow everything killed the dinosaurs
14:32
didn't i'm amazed that they survived so
14:34
long apparently it's like an
14:35
earthquake a great global event they all
14:38
drowned
14:39
a martian invasion smoking yeah
14:42
it's true have you ever seen i mean
14:43
people always say you know you never see
14:45
baby pigeons well there is a good reason
14:46
for that because they stay in the nest a
14:48
lot longer they don't fledge early like
14:49
a lot of other birds they stay in there
14:50
for ages saying feed me
14:52
but if you ever see one in the nest it
14:53
looks remarkably like a dodo
14:56
it's got this huge
15:01
yeah i've learned so much in this
15:03
section they can fly they do backwards
15:05
somersaults pigeons and no one knows why
15:08
is this in the it's in the air or on a
15:10
branch and yeah
15:11
so there's a pigeon called a birmingham
15:13
roller which is called that because it
15:14
does this rolling
15:15
um and yeah we don't know why but it
15:18
seems like they might just do it because
15:20
they like it and one of the reasons we
15:21
think they might like it is because
15:22
before they do the somersault when
15:24
they're in the air apparently they
15:25
engage in
15:26
arching frequent arching and wing
15:28
clapping they just start clapping their
15:29
wings together in excitement at the fact
15:31
that they're about to do an awesome
15:32
trick
15:32
so they pre-applaud their efforts
15:36
yeah get it going guys get the applause
15:37
going
15:41
performers of the bird world
15:46
okay it is time for fact number three
15:48
and that is
15:49
chezinski uh my fact this week is that
15:51
books used to be stacked with the spines
15:53
facing inwards
15:55
that's amazing it's so ridiculous so
15:57
weird
15:58
it's just so weird that this is more
16:00
widely known so the reason this happened
16:03
which is really interesting and i
16:04
learned this when i discovered a book
16:06
called
16:06
the book on the bookshelf by henry
16:08
petrovsky he
16:10
found out that they did this because
16:11
books were incredibly precious
16:13
back in medieval times almost always the
16:15
last thing you would do to a book after
16:16
you'd bound it is send it to a jeweler
16:18
and a goldsmith to get it all decorated
16:20
they were had lots of like really
16:21
precious
16:22
diamonds and jewels on chased bedazzled
16:24
exactly
16:25
so they were really precious and so then
16:27
they were always chained or they were
16:29
usually
16:30
chained to the shelves where they were
16:31
stored and they'd usually be in
16:32
monasteries it was mainly kind of monks
16:34
who had books
16:35
and obviously it's easier to chain a
16:36
book to a bookshelf or a cupboard
16:38
if you're doing it via the spine because
16:40
you can just put the chain
16:42
yeah and so that's how they attach them
16:44
see i kind of assumed it was something
16:45
to do with fading
16:46
or something like that because i've got
16:47
some quite old books at home and the
16:49
spine is much
16:50
more faded than the actual front and
16:51
back papers are oh really
16:53
because the spines were sort of the
16:54
least desirable part they were almost
16:56
something you should hide like the hinge
16:57
of a door
16:58
yeah it's sort of philosophical
17:00
petrovsky says that uh
17:01
shelving books with the spines in woods
17:03
must have seemed as natural and
17:04
appropriate thing to do as to put the
17:05
winding machinery of a clock
17:07
toward the wall or behind a door cool
17:09
there's still a nightmare trying to find
17:10
a book in the library
17:11
yeah you can imagine it just walking in
17:13
there just faced with all the pages
17:16
okay there is a library in dublin called
17:18
marshes library yeah
17:20
it's a really early public library and
17:21
they don't have chained books because
17:23
chain books is obviously to keep them
17:25
safe because just in case people wanted
17:26
to nickel or anything so they don't have
17:28
chain books but they do have cages
17:30
which you have to sit in if you want to
17:31
read certain books
17:35
and they're really nice cages i mean
17:37
they're not what you're picturing
17:39
um but they are sections of the library
17:41
little alcoves with
17:42
with grills across them and you get sort
17:44
of shut in there with the really
17:45
precious books
17:46
so you're like a zoo animal people can
17:48
observe
17:49
what a human reading looks like yeah
17:51
cage
17:54
the next extreme sport i was looking
17:56
into libraries generally when i was
17:57
researching this topic
17:58
because old libraries are really
18:00
fascinating the systems that they used
18:02
to run by
18:03
and i was reading about this is from the
18:04
independent about how the new york
18:06
public library
18:07
has unearthed this huge file of
18:10
questions submitted to them
18:11
by members of the public so before the
18:14
internet before google
18:15
where would you get your information if
18:17
you needed it immediately you would go
18:18
to your library and you would submit a
18:20
question and have them answer it for you
18:21
and the librarian would go off and look
18:23
for it and
18:24
either call you back or or just next
18:26
time you're in give you the answer and
18:27
they publish some of their favorite
18:29
questions so they include why do the
18:32
18th century english paintings have so
18:33
many squirrels in them
18:36
and how did they tame them so they
18:37
wouldn't bite the painter
18:39
so that was from 1976 and they have it
18:41
on a little card that they've kept 1970
18:43
1976 as far as that yeah yeah
18:46
from 1956 what kind of apple did eve eat
18:51
and then this telephone call
18:52
mid-afternoon new year's day
18:54
1967. i have two questions the first is
18:57
a sort of an etiquette one
18:58
i went to a new year's eve party and
19:00
unexpectedly stayed over i don't really
19:02
know the hosts
19:03
or try to send a thank you note second
19:05
when you meet a fellow and you know he's
19:07
worth 27 million dollars
19:09
because that's what they told me 27
19:12
million
19:12
and you know his nationality how do you
19:14
find out his name
19:15
[Laughter]
19:20
you can see why she was desperate to
19:21
track that guy down again yeah i'd start
19:23
with a thank you note actually and i'd
19:24
say
19:25
by the way the man wearing the gold suit
19:27
from last night
19:28
what was his name um so 1976 you're
19:32
saying wow as far as then people still
19:33
sending in questions
19:34
um the library the new york public
19:36
library have said that they still
19:38
get 1700 questions a month
19:41
today oh yeah so they are the original
19:44
google
19:45
right librarians of the original google
19:47
yeah and now
19:48
it's kind of exactly the same situation
19:49
as black cabs and uber i think
19:51
isn't it so now presumably librarians
19:53
just can say google it and they're
19:54
putting these old-school knowledgeable
19:56
ones out of business just like the way
19:57
that cabbies now will say
19:59
just uber
19:59
[Laughter]
20:02
so um this is the thing it's like just
20:03
you're talking about old libraries dan
20:05
so
20:06
in very early monasteries and libraries
20:08
and places where books were extremely
20:09
precious right
20:10
some places had a system where the
20:12
librarian has a key right
20:14
and all the books are kept in trunks you
20:16
know these great big trunks but there
20:17
are also
20:18
two other locks and there are two other
20:20
keys and you have to have all three
20:22
people present all three librarians
20:24
for someone to borrow a book wow what
20:26
yeah crown jewels
20:28
they're so valuable and then there's a
20:30
ritual of book return as well
20:32
so i'm quoting here the librarian shall
20:34
read the statement as to the manner in
20:36
which brethren have had books during the
20:37
past year as a monastery
20:39
as each brother hears his name
20:40
pronounced he is to give back the book
20:41
which have been entrusted to him for
20:43
reading
20:43
and he whose conscience accuses him of
20:45
not having read the book through which
20:47
he had received
20:48
is to fall on his face confess his fault
20:50
and entreat forgiveness
20:55
and i think that's right for return to
20:57
libraries
20:58
absolutely yeah yeah i did find out what
21:02
the biggest final ever was for a library
21:04
oh yeah yeah it's surprisingly modest
21:06
actually it was um
21:07
it was 345 dollars and 14 cents
21:12
but the there was a it was a two cents a
21:13
day for a poetry book days and deeds
21:16
which was booked out of the kennewey
21:17
public library in illinois in 1955
21:20
uh and they found it in her house 47
21:22
years later
21:23
wow 47 years it only accrued 345 dollars
21:26
which
21:26
in current money is about 203 quid
21:28
that's good so surprisingly
21:29
yes do you know someone who was
21:31
responsible for a cool bit of book
21:33
innovation as in in the way we see books
21:35
it was lewis carroll
21:37
really yeah so in 1876 he wrote his
21:39
publisher
21:40
saying guys could you please put the
21:42
name of the book
21:44
on the outside on the dust jacket
21:47
really yeah so dust jacket is a really
21:49
interesting thing um
21:50
you used to not have dust jackets on
21:52
books uh at all and then you develop
21:54
really nice bindings like anna says
21:56
and you would then have a dust jacket to
21:58
protect against the dust but it was
21:59
plain and you just throw it away
22:01
uh once you'd opened the book it was
22:02
just unnecessary packaging
22:04
um and then they started having
22:05
transparent dust jackets so you could
22:07
see
22:08
a bit of the spine um but and then
22:10
eventually people started drawing on the
22:12
dust jackets and they started in about
22:13
the 1830s
22:15
um and in 1876 lewis carroll had to ask
22:18
his publishers though
22:19
can you put the name of the book on the
22:20
spine of the dust jacket so it was still
22:22
not
22:23
widespread even then i think wow yeah
22:26
people often say that he invented uh
22:28
putting the name of the book
22:30
on the spine i don't know if that's true
22:32
people often say
22:33
um this is a good idea on uh 19th
22:36
century figures and books
22:38
so humphrey davey who's an extremely
22:39
famous chemist we've talked about before
22:41
who discovered a bunch of metals famous
22:43
metals and you know who is important in
22:46
electricity and battery making
22:47
he never wanted to waste time by being
22:50
tempted to read the same book again
22:51
so every time he finished a book he
22:53
destroyed it he mutilated it so he would
22:55
never be tempted to go back and read
22:57
whoa did he do it as he read every page
23:00
did he tear off i'm never reading this
23:03
again
23:03
and then he gets it wait who was that
23:05
character that's amazing
23:11
okay it is time for a final fact of the
23:13
show and that
23:14
is andy my fact is that in may
23:17
an internal memo by the egyptian
23:19
government on how to crush the press
23:21
was accidentally sent out to the press
23:25
it's so pleasing um so egypt is very
23:28
repressive government and they're
23:29
constantly arresting journalists and
23:31
things like that
23:32
and um they in may uh sent out memos to
23:34
journalists from the
23:36
ministry ministries official email
23:38
account
23:39
about how to counter this news media
23:41
campaign which was saying by the way the
23:43
government keep arresting journalists
23:44
and they were saying oh well we can we
23:46
can stop all coverage related to this
23:47
we can undermine the credibility of the
23:49
journalists union and we can monitor
23:52
news websites around the clock with more
23:53
stuff and it was basically this whole
23:55
series of measures
23:56
designed to shut down the press and then
23:57
they put it out as a press release
23:59
basically
23:59
oh my god fantastic um yeah and i got
24:02
this from a report in the economist
24:04
about uh
24:05
press freedom and loads and loads of it
24:08
not happening as it were all over the
24:09
world so
24:10
lots of people uh being arrested there
24:12
was someone in thailand who was
24:13
prosecuted recently for being sarcastic
24:15
about the king's dog
24:16
wow okay yeah really yeah yeah it's
24:19
quite hard to prove sarcasm
24:20
it's one of the because you can always
24:21
just say i was being genuine yeah or you
24:24
can say oh yeah i was being really
24:25
genuine
24:26
i think you will still get locked up
24:28
unfortunately
24:30
it's worth the try yeah my favorite
24:34
thing that's happened recently in terms
24:36
of
24:36
freedom of expression and people getting
24:38
a press for
24:39
um for instance satirizing leaders is
24:42
your favorite oppression story
24:44
i've got i'm really big into those yeah
24:47
that's not true
24:48
no my favorite thing that's happened
24:49
along these lines was in december 2015
24:52
in turkey when a turkish guy was on
24:55
trial and he'd been accused of insulting
24:56
the president
24:57
erdogan because he compared him to
25:00
gollum from lord of the rings
25:02
and the trial had to be adjourned
25:04
because it turned out that the judge on
25:05
trial hadn't read lord of the rings
25:07
and so it's impossible to assert him
25:09
whether or not this was an insult
25:11
and in the end they had to call in five
25:13
experts to deduce whether or not
25:15
comparing
25:16
the president to gollum was an insulting
25:18
thing to do and to decide whether or not
25:19
golem was an evil character or a good
25:21
character
25:22
i can't believe they needed five as well
25:25
in the film
25:27
no because it takes because they needed
25:28
the experts to interpret it so they had
25:30
two academics two psychologists
25:32
and a movie slash television expert mark
25:35
[Laughter]
25:39
eventually peter jackson got involved he
25:41
uh released i think he released a
25:42
statement or he tweeted saying that
25:44
actually uh it shouldn't have been seen
25:45
as insulting because
25:46
smeagle in fact which is who was
25:48
depicted in the satire was a very good
25:50
character
25:51
a lovable and honest guy who should
25:52
never be confused with gollum
25:54
so he
25:57
i think it was concluded at the end of
25:59
the trial that
26:00
it's not insulting to compare someone to
26:02
gollum oh good well we can say that
26:04
president
26:04
again is exactly like can't we no we
26:07
can't do that because in germany for
26:09
example a poet
26:10
wrote a poem about saying that president
26:11
erdogan has sex with goats
26:13
and uh has been arrested and i think
26:18
uh is awaiting charges now because there
26:20
are laws against insulting foreign heads
26:21
of state
26:22
it's a huge thing across europe as well
26:25
so in iceland i think you can get up to
26:26
six
26:27
years in prison i mean something insane
26:28
like that for insulting
26:30
not your own head of state but a foreign
26:31
head of state yeah that is mad well they
26:33
have to call in people to decide whether
26:35
it's offensive to say someone has sex
26:36
with goats
26:40
there was quite a big international
26:42
incident of an insult
26:43
that was done recently between the
26:45
president of argentina
26:47
and pope francis and basically the
26:50
president of argentina
26:51
made a huge charitable donation towards
26:53
a cause that pope francis had set up and
26:55
been talking about
26:56
the amount that this guy gave was 16
26:58
million 666
27:00
000 pesos which is roughly just under
27:03
1.2 million american dollars
27:05
but it contained the number 666 in it
27:08
and the pope
27:09
was convinced that that was a deliberate
27:11
move by him
27:12
to sort of insult him and sort of
27:14
undermine him so he rejected the
27:16
charitable donation
27:17
well it contained the number so it was
27:19
16 million 666 thousand
27:22
666 right there i think we've done on q
27:24
is it that it's not six six six it's six
27:26
one six although it is just about
27:28
possible that the pope isn't an avid qi
27:30
fan
27:31
[Laughter]
27:39
with politicians it was a great one in
27:41
2013 when the
27:42
uh australian opposition leader tony
27:44
abbott was criticizing the prime
27:46
minister
27:47
kevin rudd and said no one however smart
27:49
however well educated however
27:50
experienced
27:51
it's the suppository of all wisdom
27:52
[Laughter]
27:56
do you know that george bush senior when
27:57
he was president threw up on the
27:58
japanese prime minister
27:59
uh i mean he did have an intestinal flu
28:02
at the time or so he claimed but what
28:03
was really funny is that
28:05
it actually became a phrase for vomiting
28:07
in japanese
28:08
as well it's it's good to do a bush or
28:10
bush
28:12
means to do a bush it's so
28:15
i love you saying that he had an
28:16
intestinal problem or so he claimed so
28:19
the suggestion is he might have just
28:21
managed to bring voluntary vomit out of
28:24
it
28:24
to to insult japanese premier is that
28:28
what we're saying excuse me
28:30
do you see one as well recently this is
28:31
quite a big gaffe the queen's honors
28:34
list
28:34
this year a lot of amazing people on it
28:36
and they included by accident two
28:38
serving soldiers
28:39
from the sas they released their names
28:41
they're still active
28:42
and it's the first time ever that that's
28:44
happened wow yeah and so they had to
28:46
immediately delete it and the newspapers
28:48
have been quite good they've not
28:49
published their names but
28:50
they were on there oh wow yeah we're
28:53
here to reveal
28:54
that james harker
28:59
that was a bit like uh in 2003 there was
29:02
a schoolgirl in devon called claire
29:04
mcdonald
29:04
she was 15 and she suddenly started
29:07
getting emails from the pentagon
29:09
and she got about 11 emails a week that
29:12
were
29:13
full of state secrets for they came from
29:15
uh ministry of defense they came from
29:16
the pentagon
29:17
they detailed various things like
29:19
communications problems on british
29:20
warships
29:21
new zealand's defense strategy one of
29:23
them actually had
29:24
details for how to avoid leaks from the
29:27
secret service department tips on how to
29:29
avoid leaky information
29:30
and it turned out that there was a navy
29:32
commander who was supposed to distribute
29:33
it to an email list and
29:34
made a typo and she was getting all
29:36
these emails she replied to them saying
29:38
i really don't think this is meant for
29:39
me i'm a schoolgirl from devon
29:41
heard no response you just kept on
29:42
receiving them and that's codeword this
29:44
weekend
29:46
from devon we're all school girls
29:50

00:38
[Music]
00:45
and once again we have gathered round
00:48
the table with our four
00:49
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:51
and in no particular order
00:53
here we go starting with my fact this
00:56
week
00:56
my fact is that the way to defeat the
00:59
british royal navy's most advanced
01:01
destroyer ship
01:02
is to put it in warm water
01:06
so the british have spent a billion on
01:09
six
01:10
massive destroyer ships these are ships
01:12
that in their in their press release
01:13
said this is the most
01:14
advanced technology these are the most
01:16
advanced ships of all time
01:18
going into the oceans it turns out that
01:21
their engines
01:22
can't take warm water and so if they go
01:25
to the persian gulf
01:26
for example the whole ship just breaks
01:29
it just completely would we ever want to
01:30
go to the persian gulf
01:33
it's dangerous there we should just
01:36
start wars in iceland
01:38
yeah defense was that they weren't
01:41
anticipating having to go somewhere like
01:42
the gulf so
01:44
john hudson who's the managing director
01:45
of bae systems said um
01:47
the operating profile at the time was
01:49
that there would not be continuous
01:51
operations in the gulf
01:52
as if that's true that was just out of
01:54
the question at the time that we'd end
01:55
up there
01:56
so yeah they didn't expect to have to go
01:58
anywhere there was a response from the
01:59
mod they said
02:00
this is quote uh from the if the ft
02:02
article the mod added that the ships
02:04
remained one of the most capable
02:06
warships on the planet
02:09
but only parts of the planet the
02:11
rolls-royce spokesman said
02:13
this is not the fault of rolls-royce it
02:15
is the laws of physics
02:19
can't do anything about those that's
02:21
insane yep that's amazing is it
02:23
is it the fault of the rolls royce and
02:25
so on for making the engines better is
02:27
it the fault of the mod for not telling
02:28
them
02:29
well there is certainly plenty of
02:30
thought of the mod yeah and the mod
02:32
probably says it's rolls royce's fault
02:34
and everyone says it's isaac newton's
02:36
fault
02:36
[Laughter]
02:38
yeah to fix these ships actually when
02:40
they do replace the engines they're
02:41
going to have to drill a huge hole in
02:43
the underside of the
02:44
of the boats i think so you've really
02:46
got to tear the whole thing apart at
02:47
this point wow
02:48
and it's a billion pounds each i think
02:50
yeah but that is of course only three
02:52
months of the money that we're going to
02:53
get back
02:54
from europe um
02:57
did you know there's one vertical
02:59
shipwreck in the world
03:00
which is just sticking up completely
03:02
vertically at a 90 degree
03:04
angle to the seabed wow and um this is
03:07
hms victoria and it's a really
03:08
interesting story so it's um
03:10
this was a battleship in the late 19th
03:12
century and it was one of the biggest
03:13
battleship
03:14
wrecks that the uk suffered and it was
03:16
because of this guy admiral
03:18
tryon which feels like uh
03:21
he just turned up at the emerald zoo one
03:23
day
03:23
[Laughter]
03:25
just trying that on and it did not go
03:27
well for him so
03:28
he did he gave this bizarre order in
03:31
1893
03:32
he was a really well decorated admiral
03:34
in the royal navy
03:36
and he was just off the coast of lebanon
03:37
and there were two main ships leading
03:39
this big fleet the hms victoria and hms
03:41
camper down
03:42
and he suddenly via semaphore gave the
03:44
instruction to camper down that those
03:46
two ships that were running parallel to
03:48
each other
03:48
had to turn inwards towards each other
03:50
and do a full circle in order to come
03:52
back
03:52
and the turning circle of those ships
03:54
was uh collectively two kilometers
03:57
and there was one kilometer between them
03:59
so it was physically impossible again
04:00
it's a law of physics issue
04:02
it was physically impossible for them
04:04
not to crash into each other
04:05
so the captain of hms camperdown ignored
04:08
that the first time around but when he
04:09
gave the order a second time
04:10
he just had to obey because that was
04:12
what you did in the 1890s
04:14
and so they did this turn and lo and
04:16
behold these two ships
04:17
both just captained by the same guy who
04:19
crashed straight into each other
04:21
and one of them like plummeted to the
04:23
bottom of the ocean yeah
04:24
his last words were it's all my fault
04:28
whoa yeah his last words what on his
04:30
deathbed on his
04:31
well he died in the shipwreck a lot of
04:33
people died so uh bizarrely 357 people
04:36
were rescued
04:37
but sadly 358 people were drowned and so
04:42
just tipped it over the edge and so as
04:44
he was going down he said it's all my
04:45
fault to which i guess everyone on board
04:47
his [ __ ] replied yes it is
04:52
his name was tryon wasn't it try on
04:54
admirals yeah
04:55
my favorite kind of nominatively
04:57
determined
04:58
um captain of a ship was um captain
05:01
schlitt
05:02
uh and he was a captain of a german uh
05:05
u-boat
05:06
it was u-1206 and it sank off the coast
05:08
of scotland uh because the toilets
05:10
flooded
05:12
really yeah i don't know what caused the
05:15
original blockage
05:16
but um what happened was there was um
05:18
they flushed it a couple of times and it
05:20
overflowed but the batteries were
05:22
underneath the toilet so it wasn't a
05:24
very well designed submarine
05:26
and so the water went into the batteries
05:29
that released a load of chlorine gas
05:31
and then they were like oh [ __ ] there's
05:33
chlorine gas everywhere so they had to
05:34
go to the surface and then when they got
05:36
to the surface the british just went oh
05:38
there's a submarine let's shoot it
05:40
here's the thing really early submarines
05:43
um they
05:44
were basically at the surface almost all
05:45
the time they were pretty much surface
05:46
ships that had the capacity to dive
05:48
um but the the really odd thing is that
05:51
uh
05:52
even in the second world war to have
05:53
extra observation a german u-boat would
05:55
surface
05:56
and then it would send up a kite with a
05:58
man in a little seat
06:00
and he would look around but this truly
06:02
happened this is within living memory
06:04
he would look around and he could
06:05
because obviously you can see dozens of
06:07
miles in any direction you can see any
06:08
ships
06:09
um and then 53 kilometers apparently was
06:12
the maximum you could see
06:13
um and the only disadvantage was
06:15
obviously it immediately gave away your
06:16
position
06:18
and you would then have to dive really
06:19
quickly once you've seen who's in the
06:21
area yeah
06:22
and the guy is still attached to the
06:23
submarine being pulled down is he
06:25
he i think they
06:29
i think they get him back on board and
06:31
then
06:32
deep breath
06:36
when the battleship arrives when the
06:38
british warship arrives it's just a
06:39
bloke in a kite
06:41
submarine i think so
06:47
i'm sure i would have noticed seth
06:50
so the us navy's most advanced new
06:53
battleship is called the uss
06:54
zumwalt and it is so advanced it is so
06:58
stealthy that in fact it's too stealthy
07:01
and it's going to have to carry big
07:02
reflective pads so other things don't
07:04
bump into it
07:06
it's about 400 feet long and it can make
07:08
itself
07:09
look on radar like a 50 foot long
07:11
fishing boat one quick last thing
07:13
you know the ceremony the launching
07:14
ceremonies of boats so every time a new
07:16
royal boat is launched then we smash a
07:18
champagne bottle or a woman
07:19
customarily smashes a champagne bottle
07:21
into it and i didn't realize the first
07:23
instance in this was
07:24
in the 18th century and the person who
07:27
first smashed a champagne bottle
07:29
onto a ship's hull was the princess of
07:31
hanover um and
07:32
she according to uh reports at the time
07:35
threw the bottle at it so now we smash
07:37
it but she threw the bottle at it with
07:39
more energy than accuracy
07:41
missing the ship entirely and injuring
07:43
one of the spectators
07:45
who put in a claim for damages against
07:47
the admiralty
07:49
does that mean that he was technically
07:50
the ship is that how it works
07:56
this is hms uh destroyer this is hms
07:59
arrogant hms
08:00
kevin hms bloody
08:03
bloodface okay it's time for our second
08:07
fact and that
08:08
is james harkin okay my fact this week
08:10
is that in
08:11
1988 singapore held a beauty contest
08:15
where 60 percent of the judging marks
08:17
were awarded for how good a contestant's
08:20
website was
08:21
[Laughter]
08:23
so this was a way to promote the
08:25
internet in singapore in the 90s
08:28
and it was their leading internet
08:30
service provider called sing net and
08:31
they had a competition to find
08:33
intellectual beauty
08:35
and 60 of the marks were awarded for
08:37
internet knowledge
08:38
which was producing your own homepage
08:41
and also sitting at a laptop answering
08:43
internet trivia questions yeah wow
08:46
and designing like it was just a laptop
08:48
on stage and they came out and designed
08:50
a website
08:51
yeah also do they have to design it on
08:52
the spot kind of thing yeah
08:54
doesn't it take days not if you use
08:57
squarespace.com
08:59
[Laughter]
09:01
um so obviously um beauty contests we
09:04
probably all think they're a little bit
09:05
sexist yeah but according to a miss
09:08
america organization they claim to be
09:10
the largest scholarship organization
09:13
solely for women in the whole of america
09:15
um
09:18
i think that's been debunked yeah
09:26
i think they do give out some
09:27
scholarships but they don't give out
09:28
nearly as many as were originally
09:30
claimed
09:31
so modern beauty contests were invented
09:33
by pt barnum
09:34
who we must all know he is the guy who
09:36
kind of started circuses he was a big
09:38
kind of circus king of america
09:40
uh and he started them in delaware in
09:43
1880
09:44
and it was a panel of judges who chose
09:45
and one of the judges was thomas edison
09:48
really yeah uh and it was to promote a
09:51
beach resort outside of the normal kind
09:53
of time that people would go to beaches
09:55
in 1955 america had a sausage queen
09:58
that was a competition there was a huge
10:00
rash in the 50s especially of
10:02
really really heavily sponsored
10:04
competitions if you
10:05
google image search i've done this it's
10:07
safe so don't worry
10:10
took a risk uh if you google image
10:12
search sausage queen you'll find
10:16
by the picture of this poor woman she's
10:20
she's wearing a bikini but she's also
10:22
covered in sausages
10:23
[Laughter]
10:25
well there are in colombia there are
10:28
loads and loads of beauty pageants so i
10:30
think the bbc works out the colombia
10:31
holds 3794 beauty pageants a day
10:35
a year a year calm down
10:38
you're all beautiful but there's more
10:41
than 10 a day and so they've had to
10:43
branch out so they have miss
10:44
onion and that's where you have to prove
10:46
your extensive knowledge of onions
10:48
they have the international coffee
10:50
pageant which uh similarly miss coffee
10:52
is someone
10:52
from japan bizarrely who proved her
10:55
knowledge of colombian coffee well
10:56
enough
10:57
they have donkey pageants which are
10:59
really popular which is where you dress
11:01
up donkeys and this takes place uh
11:03
in in uh rural columbia and it's where
11:06
you dress up your donkeys as political
11:07
or famous figures
11:08
and you prance them around so at the
11:10
last donkey pageant i think one of them
11:12
was barack obama
11:13
he was draped in an american flag so he
11:15
was wearing an american flag or sort of
11:17
a dress
11:17
uh and he had a usa tie on him and in
11:20
the end the prize actually went to a
11:21
donkey dressed as a colombian preacher
11:23
and barack obama's handler apparently
11:26
was seen
11:27
storming off in outrage yeah i would
11:30
have i'd put a bag of oats on my
11:31
donkey's nose and then it would be don
11:33
quixote
11:36
are they mixed
11:41
on the flip side uh i was reading about
11:44
uh and it's terrible that this exists
11:46
but this does exist
11:47
in zimbabwe um there's an annual mr ugly
11:50
competition
11:52
and it's been going for four years this
11:54
will be the fifth year 2016. last year
11:56
uh they had a situation a huge
11:59
controversy because
12:01
the person who was awarded the top prize
12:03
of mr ugly in the country
12:06
was deemed too handsome by most of the
12:09
people
12:10
who were in it uh mainly it was the guy
12:12
who's won it three years in a row
12:13
uh who was like this guy's not ugly he's
12:15
just missing teeth
12:17
apparently he just i believe the contest
12:19
got ugly
12:22
they really stuck to their guns the guy
12:24
one of the main judges said
12:25
um sierra made a tremendous guy who won
12:28
sierra made a tremendous effort to
12:29
enhance his ugliness by pulling
12:31
facial stunts mass venue who was the
12:34
former champion
12:35
thought he is so ugly that he didn't
12:36
even need to try hard
12:39
that cost him the crown
12:40
[Laughter]
12:42
and so yeah so none of the judging panel
12:44
said oh i just thought voting him would
12:47
be a protest i didn't think he'd
12:48
actually win
12:53
yes satirical show we do yeah this is
12:56
the most satirical we've ever made
12:59
yeah so um a thing about the internet in
13:02
singapore yeah okay so in 2001
13:06
singapore banned campaigning on the
13:08
internet during its election
13:09
so minister for information and art uh
13:12
lee yok swan
13:13
said a free-for-all internet campaigning
13:15
environment without rules
13:17
is not advisable on the internet once a
13:20
false story or rumor is started
13:22
it's like water that has been spilled
13:24
it's almost impossible to reign in the
13:26
matters
13:27
especially in the limited period of an
13:29
election campaign
13:31
i think we can all agree he was way off
13:33
the mark there
13:35
they said they were quite into promoting
13:37
the internet around that period weren't
13:38
they because they had an internet
13:40
festival
13:41
in the year 2000 um and that was so the
13:45
the centerpiece of this festival was
13:46
this guy called nicholas eng
13:48
who was a computer engineer who founded
13:50
this company called wave new world
13:52
and this was all the talk of the the
13:53
millennial singaporean internet festival
13:56
and as the bbc reported he said that uh
13:59
the internet and this new media
14:00
explosion in the year 2000
14:02
have brought us email e-commerce dvd
14:04
movies
14:05
interactive games but something is
14:07
missing the sense of smell
14:10
and he was starting up a company called
14:14
digisense
14:15
which allowed you to use the internet
14:16
but smell as you were doing it
14:18
all the scents that would be appropriate
14:19
to the website that you were searching
14:21
you don't always want to smell the thing
14:23
that you're looking at if it's sausage
14:25
queen
14:28
if you google the phrase smell the
14:30
sausage queen we cannot guarantee that
14:33
that is safe
14:35
it is crazy though because i remember
14:36
the internet in 1998 which was
14:39
uh pretty basic so the idea that there
14:40
would be a massive competition at that
14:42
time
14:43
yeah seems ridiculous i went to uh
14:45
jodrell bank which is in cheshire it's a
14:47
big sort of what is it a big they look
14:49
for aliens yeah big telescope
14:53
uh so it was in the 90s and we didn't no
14:56
one had the internet we didn't have it
14:57
in
14:58
our school so we all went there to kind
15:00
of look at the internet
15:01
and i remember going in there i know
15:04
it's amazing but i went in there and
15:05
kind of searched for
15:06
fantasy football which i was into at the
15:08
time and
15:10
it kind of just picked up the word
15:11
fantasy and gave me lots of things that
15:13
as a
15:13
young teenage boy i'd never really seen
15:15
before whoa
15:18
yeah that's ironic considering the
15:19
rhyming slang that jodrell bank is
15:21
[Laughter]
15:25
guys we need to move on in a second we
15:27
ought to yeah yeah
15:28
okay i have one little thing about
15:30
contests in singapore yeah
15:32
um so in 2009 um men's sport in
15:35
singapore was
15:36
so bad that they couldn't find a
15:38
sportsman of the year
15:42
so 2008 was an olympic year as well
15:45
and the president of their olympic
15:47
council said unfortunately it was a bad
15:48
year
15:49
none of them really achieved anything
15:50
noteworthy
15:52
so i had a look at what they did in the
15:54
olympics and um the table tennis team
15:56
went out in the group stage
15:58
uh none of the sailors made the top 20.
16:01
their only track athlete went out in the
16:02
first round
16:03
their only shooter lost in the first
16:05
round their only swimmer lost in the
16:07
first round
16:09
and their only male badminton player
16:10
lost in the second round
16:12
so you think he might have won but he
16:14
had a buy in the first round
16:18
uh time for fact number three and that
16:20
is anna chazinski
16:22
my fact this week is that there is a
16:24
network of fully furnished
16:26
fake apartments in the uk whose sole
16:28
purpose is to get burgled
16:30
wow it's amazing how many when you say a
16:33
network
16:34
how many it's so bizarre that's your
16:35
first question
16:38
who owns them um so they are owned by
16:41
the government so this is
16:42
there are a lot to answer your question
16:44
apparently that helps
16:46
they exist in every major city in the uk
16:49
there are a few of these
16:50
and i found this out in a new book just
16:53
come out this year called a burglar's
16:54
guide to the city it's by
16:55
jeff manow and it's so good
16:58
and yeah well it's this capture house
17:01
program that the government runs which
17:03
is where you
17:04
build a completely fake apartment that's
17:06
totally kitted out with like a lot of
17:08
like nice technology
17:09
with some furniture that's often donated
17:11
by the local police force apparently
17:13
that they didn't want
17:14
and you build this apartment in a way
17:17
that will hopefully lure burglars to
17:19
burgle it
17:20
and unbeknownst to them they're all
17:22
covered in this chemical
17:24
agent which can only be seen under uv
17:26
light so whenever the burglar who's
17:27
burning it touches a handle or walks
17:29
across the floor then he's covering
17:30
himself in this chemical agent
17:32
which then needs a trace of where he's
17:33
been and also they're full of cameras
17:35
so basically they're there as traps so
17:37
that burglars come in
17:38
and then the police follow immediately
17:40
afterwards and they're all over the
17:41
place and you wouldn't know if there was
17:42
one in your apartment building there
17:43
really they're everywhere
17:44
so you could
17:47
[Laughter]
17:49
maybe it is i want to know how they lure
17:52
burglars to burgle them do they have do
17:54
they have people sort of ostentatiously
17:56
carrying in
17:57
you know really nice and stuff saying oh
18:01
i must get a second lock for this door
18:03
one of these days
18:04
as soon as i get back from that long
18:06
holiday
18:08
thank god we got rid of the dog
18:12
yeah it's basically that no they're
18:14
they're often targeting one specific
18:16
burglar
18:17
so though it's amazing it's genuinely
18:20
incredible
18:20
they target that particular burglar's
18:22
modus operandi so if he only
18:24
robs first floor flats for example
18:27
they'll try and make sure that one of
18:28
their
18:28
capture houses is a first floor flat if
18:30
they can and then they walk around
18:32
outside of shouting
18:33
marjorie can you remind me to open all
18:34
the windows it's so warm
18:37
and then they'll leave a window open and
18:38
they'll try and you know get them in
18:40
it's true
18:43
the way a burglar operates and you
18:45
really can rig up a house or a flat so
18:47
that it is going to attract that one
18:49
burglar in the area
18:50
and one burglar can raise the crime
18:51
rates of of one area massively because
18:54
he and his gang or she and her gang uh
18:56
will just be
18:57
operating on lots of houses every day of
18:59
the week i was looking into
19:01
so police having to fake things in order
19:03
to get results
19:05
confessions
19:08
so one of the things i read about is
19:09
that um uh bomb
19:11
and drug sniffing dogs uh when they go
19:13
around uh looking for
19:15
uh any you know their airports trying to
19:17
sniff out drugs and so on
19:19
um apparently if they don't get a win
19:22
if they don't manage to smell out some
19:24
drugs um they get quite depressed
19:26
psychologically sniffer dogs actually
19:27
get depressed that they don't
19:29
have a sort of they've done a good job
19:31
so what the police will do is they'll
19:33
fake a situation yeah yeah honestly
19:36
where the dog can then
19:37
sniff out someone and be like oh and
19:39
they
19:40
they just get members of the public they
19:41
pay them to do it and they and they pay
19:45
i don't know if they pay them but
19:46
they've set up fake drug busts for dogs
19:49
so that dogs can feel better
19:50
it's a great fact um these guys always
19:53
have to tell me when i've actually got a
19:54
good fact that
19:55
you've done very well um have a biscuit
19:58
do you want to hear about a couple of
19:59
them
20:00
[Laughter]
20:03
um don't hear about a couple of cool
20:04
devices that you can get if you don't
20:06
want to be burgled
20:07
yes please sure thing a lock
20:11
um so you can get a thing called fake tv
20:14
which is very cool
20:15
and it's this panel which uh is just
20:17
flashing led lights but from the outside
20:20
it looks exactly like someone's indoors
20:21
and watching telly why don't you just
20:23
leave your tv on
20:24
good point great that's stuff there
20:27
business model
20:29
no i think it i think the idea is it
20:31
uses a lot less energy than just
20:33
leaving your telly on all the time did
20:35
someone watch home alone and see the
20:37
christmas scene
20:39
that's a business model yes that is a
20:42
thing you can buy it's called fake tv
20:44
and i've seen it it looks it looks right
20:46
i didn't burgle the house um
20:48
and there's another thing you can get
20:49
you can get an anti-theft security smog
20:51
jet machine um this is for for things
20:54
like banks and things like that but
20:56
if there's a break-in it just floods the
20:57
entire room with smog
20:59
wow yeah that's very cool and the
21:01
burglar goes in and goes oh i'm in the
21:03
19th century
21:06
um just on the subject of fake i was
21:08
looking for fake things and
21:10
police uh and i just i found a story
21:12
that i'd rather like from last year this
21:13
is from sutton so not too far from here
21:16
uh and it's that in june of last year
21:18
police in sutton turned up to a house
21:20
uh because they'd had a tip-off from the
21:22
rspca and they had a standoff
21:24
over a snake which was loose in
21:26
someone's garden and they had a
21:28
reasonably long standoff until it was
21:29
pointed out to them that it was a garden
21:31
ornament
21:32
snake um but they were standing really
21:34
still watching it and it wasn't moving
21:36
and they weren't moving
21:39
and then a resident told them it's not
21:42
it's not real
21:43
and i just love that question the
21:45
neighbor was called gary hollins
21:46
a 43 year old who lived nearby and he
21:49
said i could have told you it was a fake
21:50
snake because the paint is peeling off
21:52
it
21:54
hey snakes shed their skin uh we need to
21:58
move on to the final fact
21:59
okay maybe we should do some um
22:02
hilarious burglary stories
22:04
shall we um so i um went on the internet
22:07
and looked for some
22:08
burglar headlines from the last few
22:10
months so um a burglar
22:12
was caught after knocking over a tin of
22:15
white paint during a break-in
22:16
and leaving footsteps leading all the
22:19
way to his door
22:21
oh man there was another one who was
22:24
caught by police after having a bite out
22:26
of a cucumber
22:27
and leaving his dna inside the cucumber
22:31
there was a post office burglar who was
22:33
caught after he tried to buy a car with
22:35
1 000 pounds in one pound coins
22:40
and there was a kentucky burglar who was
22:42
arrested after accidentally
22:44
dialing his phone 9-1-1 while he was
22:47
talking to an accomplice about the
22:49
burglary
22:50
that he was just about to do oh my god
22:53
they just overheard him saying what he
22:55
was gonna do and then they caught him
22:56
wow
22:57
do you remember there was that story
22:58
about there was um a couple
23:00
who were downstairs and they'd arrived
23:02
back home
23:03
and some two people were in their house
23:05
robbing the house sorry no it's one
23:07
person one person was in the house so he
23:09
quickly ran upstairs and hid and was
23:10
trying to plan his escape route
23:12
and according to this story the burglar
23:14
is upstairs and he's just sitting there
23:16
kind of going okay what do i do they're
23:17
downstairs
23:18
and one of the couple says oh i heard a
23:20
hilarious joke today told the joke
23:23
deliver the punchline the recipient just
23:26
didn't laugh
23:26
and then they just heard this
23:30
and the burglar couldn't help but go i
23:33
wonder what happens at that knock-knock
23:34
joke
23:36
pisses himself and then they bust over
23:37
they called the cops
23:40
so that's a true story um we need to
23:42
move on to the final fact
23:43
okay okay it's time for a final fact of
23:45
the show and that is james harkin
23:48
um has done this
23:52
okay it's time for our final fact of the
23:53
show and that is
23:55
okay final fact for the show and that is
23:58
andrew hunter murray
24:00
thank you dan
24:04
my fact is that the world's biggest sky
24:06
writing firm recently turned down a
24:08
request to draw the largest ever penis
24:11
in the sky
24:13
that was worthwhile too far
24:17
um so sky writing we all know is where
24:20
planes
24:20
loop the loop and they they release uh
24:22
smoke in various patterns to make
24:24
letters or shapes or whatever it is
24:25
and the really cool thing is there are
24:27
only five full-time
24:29
sky writers on the planet
24:32
only five people who make a full-time
24:33
living a lot of sort of freelancers that
24:35
people do at part-time
24:36
um there's an amazing article on the
24:39
website courts about this because
24:40
there's a family firm
24:42
of people who do it and um they have
24:44
various rules so they
24:45
they turn down swear words uh they won't
24:47
write
24:48
really rude things in the sky and
24:50
they've also turned down someone who
24:51
wanted to get the largest ever penis
24:53
drawn in the sky
24:54
uh but they did earlier this year right
24:56
over california the words trump is
24:57
disgusting
24:58
so but then now they now regret it and
25:01
they say they wish they hadn't taken it
25:02
because they want to be kind of able so
25:04
by writing the word trump they did kind
25:06
of have the world's biggest penis
25:07
[Laughter]
25:12
yeah so and the other cool thing is so
25:14
there are two i don't know there are two
25:16
main
25:16
ways of making uh letters in the sky you
25:19
can either do it with one plane
25:20
which is where you and you have a sort
25:22
of smoke uh jet basically it's an
25:24
adapted exhaust uh out of the back of
25:25
the plane
25:26
and you can either have one play but it
25:27
takes ages and you can only write about
25:29
12 letters maximum and it takes a couple
25:31
of minutes to write a single letter
25:33
because the letters are huge each of the
25:34
letters is as tall as the empire state
25:36
building
25:37
whoa yeah they're massive and a single
25:40
message is at least five miles long
25:42
in the sky this is very exciting because
25:44
there's now a new thing you can do
25:45
called sky
25:46
typing which is where you have five
25:48
planes next to each other right and
25:50
they're all flying in formation
25:52
and they have a computer-controlled
25:53
system which releases puffs of smoke at
25:55
exactly
25:56
the right moment so they're all writing
25:58
either on or off
25:59
in the sky and that produces like a slow
26:01
pink jet printer kind of thing like an
26:03
inkjet printer
26:04
yeah yeah and it slowly produces the
26:05
word like that as they fly across
26:07
so you can do longer messages now using
26:09
sky typing but that knows that that's
26:11
the old new divide in skywriting
26:13
that's amazing i really my favorite one
26:16
was from a few years ago
26:17
uh and it was just suddenly appeared in
26:19
the air how do i land
26:23
and and it was it was a comedian who did
26:25
that it was a kickstarter he decided he
26:26
just he wanted to
26:28
help skywriting come back he thought
26:29
it'd be a great place to put a joke up
26:31
and so he did a kickstarter and they
26:32
raised 4 000 american dollars that's how
26:34
much it cost to have something like
26:36
how uh how do i land questions do you
26:39
know that actually it was a really windy
26:41
day
26:42
and so they did the h and then by the
26:44
time they'd done the o
26:45
the h had already gone by the time
26:49
the h and the o had already gone and um
26:51
he said
26:52
if you watch the sky for 20 minutes you
26:54
could probably piece it together
26:58
he was a comedian called kurt braunola
27:01
yeah he still is a comedian called
27:02
brother um and he's he's uh just just so
27:05
people
27:06
know who he is uh kristen shaw kristen
27:08
scholl sorry uh
27:09
who is in flight the concords and and so
27:11
on it's her comedy partner so he's very
27:13
big
27:14
yeah yeah but um when he did this unless
27:16
you really really watched and saw
27:18
each letter go you couldn't really tell
27:19
what was happening um so what he did was
27:21
he took a photo of each letter before it
27:23
blew away
27:25
and then he put them all together in a
27:26
composite photo and then put it online
27:28
saying this is what it would have looked
27:30
like
27:31
of course he could have just
27:32
photoshopped the whole thing it would
27:33
have been
27:34
yeah i really like so back in back in
27:37
the sort of 60s it was used there were
27:39
so many plans that skywriting was going
27:41
to be the main
27:42
way that you would advertise your
27:43
company i think you're right and pretty
27:45
much it was when tv came in
27:47
uh and suddenly we could get advertised
27:49
into any everyone's homes immediately
27:51
and that was when sky writing's like oh
27:53
we don't really need this anymore and it
27:54
didn't
27:55
need to be a cloudless sunny day for the
27:57
advertising to reach your home
28:00
which it did but there was a lot of um
28:02
alarmism about sky writing
28:04
in the early days of of it that it was
28:06
just going to be this
28:07
like all new technologies it was going
28:09
to be this awful thing um so i was
28:11
looking in the newspaper archives and
28:13
things were writing people were writing
28:15
things about it like in 1932 there was a
28:17
debate in the house of commons as to
28:19
whether we should allow advertisers free
28:21
use of the sky
28:22
to do this sky writing and those mps are
28:25
against it said it was a desecration of
28:26
the sky
28:27
so monstrous it should be completely
28:29
prohibited uh and it was decided the
28:31
inventor would promise not to do it in
28:32
their cathedrals or monuments
28:34
and would would agree not to vulgarize
28:37
the sky
28:38
but people thought it was going to ruin
28:39
it people thought it would just uh
28:41
spiral out of control and the entire sky
28:43
would be occupied
28:44
by constant adverts well they kept
28:45
saying yeah in new york they were
28:46
worried that
28:47
uh people living in high-rise buildings
28:49
would be pummeled by the smoke that was
28:51
coming down
28:52
so they were recommending close your
28:53
windows so that you don't
28:55
die effectively uh which was not true at
28:58
all but and it was a sloppy business as
28:59
well 1961 i read this amazing report
29:01
where
29:02
uh someone went up did the message came
29:05
back down
29:06
looked up saw that they did it wrong it
29:08
was very hard to do made a mistake
29:10
went back up put a cross through it and
29:13
redid the whole thing again
29:15
do you know what the first ever
29:16
skywriting message said no it said
29:19
daily mail um it was an advert for the
29:21
daily mail
29:22
it was in 1922. and it was invented
29:26
skywriting was invented by this guy
29:27
called john savage um
29:29
he was a pilot and uh the war was over
29:32
and
29:32
um he sort of started experimenting so
29:35
this is cool he had been an agent to a
29:37
chat called bc hux
29:38
who was the first englishman to do a
29:40
loop the loop in a plane
29:42
oh wow what yeah he had a flying agent
29:45
apparently
29:46
um and then so after he experimented
29:48
with this daily mail advert
29:49
um he went to the usa and he wrote in
29:51
the skype of new york
29:52
hello usa but no explanation nothing
29:56
then the next day he sent someone else
29:59
back up another pilot
30:00
and the message he wrote in the sky was
30:02
call vanderbilt
30:04
7100 which is the hotel he was staying
30:06
at
30:08
as soon as people saw that they started
30:09
phoning the hotel by the hundreds saying
30:12
i must buy this as an advert that was
30:14
his only advertising method
30:16
i think he was proving the effectiveness
30:18
wasn't he so i think 47 000 people
30:19
called within three hours and it was
30:21
sort of improved the effectiveness of
30:22
this advertising that they
30:24
all called yeah um but someone i like
30:26
this in 1961
30:28
um there was a guy who was one of the
30:30
very few people who was employed as a
30:32
sky writer
30:33
and he had hated his math teacher at
30:36
school he said
30:37
and so he did this guy who was
30:39
skywriting with the advertisement that
30:40
he'd been employed to write in the sky
30:42
and then he had some spare ink in his in
30:44
his tank
30:46
and so at the end of his working day he
30:48
screwed
30:49
four plus one equals six in the sky
30:53
as revenge against his high school nurse
30:55
teacher
30:56
isn't that nice that's amazing how is
30:58
that revenge
31:00
yeah it relies on a lot of things the
31:02
maths teachers seeing it the massive
31:03
knowing it's him
31:04
the mass teacher giving a [ __ ] about him
31:06
anyway
31:08
but also it's not a revenge to still be
31:10
enumerated
31:10
[Laughter]
31:12
i'll show my english teacher by
31:14
unlearning reading
31:17
i was reading a few years ago and it's i
31:19
i can't read out the whole passage but
31:21
it's really worth reading this person's
31:22
account about how
31:23
when in i think it was around 2008 they
31:25
were doing a
31:27
um someone hired a skywriting team to
31:29
write peace now
31:30
across the sky so there was a protest
31:33
going because obama was doing
31:35
some sort of talk and they just wanted
31:36
to say we want peace no more war all
31:38
that sort of stuff
31:39
so the big problem that the pilot had is
31:40
that they misjudged the size of the
31:42
words
31:43
and as they were finishing up the words
31:44
they were heading directly into
31:46
territory that the military said this is
31:47
not an airspace you're allowed into
31:49
because we have the president down there
31:51
and you will be shot down
31:53
yeah someone in the plane going we need
31:54
to turn around we need to turn around
31:56
they're going
31:56
i need to get there so i can make the
31:58
turn up to finish the w on the now
32:01
so in the end of it no
32:06
we need to wrap up really soon can i
32:08
quickly tell you about a chap in
32:09
melbourne
32:10
this is a couple of years ago he wrote
32:11
he proposed his girlfriend in the sky
32:13
with sky
32:14
writing uh he wrote marie that was her
32:16
name marry me
32:17
across the sky and um she said no when
32:20
she saw it
32:22
she also sent a plane up to say no
32:27
because they've been together for years
32:28
and years and years and then they've
32:29
broken up and then there was
32:30
they were getting back together and they
32:31
would think he was thinking this i think
32:33
this will clinch it
32:34
and um he said at least i know i've
32:37
tried my best
32:39
do you know that was so weird because
32:41
there's another guy in melbourne
32:42
recently who got involved in sky writing
32:44
because he had a girlfriend called prue
32:46
and he wanted to send her a valentine's
32:48
day message in the sky saying happy
32:50
valentine's day prue but couldn't afford
32:52
it so he started a kickstarter for
32:55
everyone else who had a girlfriend
32:56
called prue
32:57
in the world and said if you will
33:00
contribute to this then we'll put the
33:01
message happy valentine's day peru
33:04
love me so no one knows which one it was
33:06
oh there was a guy who wrote
33:08
sorry in the sky above i was in american
33:10
city and
33:11
no one knows who it was but i imagine a
33:13
lot of people will have been using that
33:16
that's what that's for me to you i am
33:18
sorry boris johnson's already got the
33:20
second one

00:12
hello
00:13
and welcome to another episode of no
00:15
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:17
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:19
covent garden
00:20
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
00:22
here with anna chazinski andrew hunter
00:24
murray and james harkin
00:26
and once again we have gathered around
00:27
the microphones with our four
00:29
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:31
and in a particular order
00:32
here we go starting with you jacinsky
00:36
my fact this week is that the reason
00:38
merlin isn't called
00:39
murden is to avoid confusion with a 12th
00:42
century word for feces
00:45
that's amazing yeah so the wizard merlin
00:48
of sword in the stone fame he would have
00:51
been called murden
00:52
and so the story is that uh merlin was
00:54
originally created in the form we know
00:56
him by geoffrey of monmouth who was
00:58
a sort of a norman welsh
01:01
guy in the 12th century and he based the
01:04
character of merlin on this
01:05
welsh medieval mythical figure called
01:07
murden m-y-r-double d-i-n
01:10
but because he has sort of norman
01:12
origins because he was from the nobility
01:13
probably and so a lot of people were
01:15
speaking french in his social circles
01:18
it was thought that murder would be
01:19
really easily confused with merde which
01:21
is the same as it is today
01:22
which is uh the word for pooh feels like
01:26
he's missed a chance for a lot of puns
01:27
and
01:28
and poo jokes doesn't it by changing
01:30
that name he's lost a lot of his
01:32
joke material yes he does yeah he could
01:34
have been the chaucer
01:35
of his time yeah i just don't know if
01:37
that was the style he was going for
01:39
okay do you know that in the 17th
01:41
century the word murder was english
01:43
yes really weird isn't it it was just a
01:45
common english word for poo
01:47
mad and then it just kind of disappeared
01:49
in the 18th century
01:50
and now it's kind of everyone knows it
01:52
as just a french word
01:54
speaking of people whose names meant uh
01:56
feces
02:00
of the aztecs oh yes had a nephew whose
02:03
name meant plenty of excrement
02:06
what was his name it was cuidachuac
02:10
yeah yeah and they have they had um
02:12
guacamole didn't they which means
02:15
um testicle sauce sauce classical sauce
02:17
yeah wow
02:18
yeah and avocado means testicles as well
02:21
exactly
02:22
yes other things that mean testicles
02:24
orchid orchid yes
02:25
yeah i have another merlin uh fact
02:28
probably my favorite
02:29
merlin fact um he was sorted
02:32
into a house at hogwarts neither of
02:35
these things
02:36
is real exactly i thought someone might
02:38
pick me up but neither of these things
02:39
are real so
02:40
so uh on pottermore the big jk rowling
02:42
website it was revealed that merlin was
02:44
a student of the school of hogwarts and
02:46
he was sorted into one of the four
02:48
schools and he was sorted into slytherin
02:50
so merlin is a slytherin wow this is
02:53
weird because you said yesterday that
02:54
you'd found an amazing thing on melon
02:56
that you love it's the best thing i've
02:57
ever found
02:57
well so i was reading about him later on
03:00
and i found something i thought i bet
03:01
this is what dan's found um it's so
03:03
interesting and this really shows how
03:05
disconnected you know
03:08
the thing i thought is that um he's
03:11
so merlin in the original myth is
03:14
alleged to have been
03:15
buried in this particular place sort of
03:17
a crossover between two rivers so the
03:18
river tweed and
03:20
a little uh stream called pal sail burn
03:22
and in the legends
03:24
it was written that um if
03:27
ever the pal sail burn and the tweed
03:29
were to meet
03:30
at the place of merlin's final resting
03:33
place as in if these two rivers were to
03:34
suddenly collide
03:36
then england and scotland would have the
03:38
same monarch and this prediction is in
03:40
a medieval text and on the exact day
03:43
that james vi
03:44
of scotland and james the first of
03:46
england was crowned in 1603
03:48
uh the banks of the river tweed broke
03:51
and it flooded
03:52
into the per pal sale burn and they met
03:56
no isn't that weird i smell
03:59
pr happening here
04:00
[Laughter]
04:03
it might be that i didn't check off when
04:04
the bank's broke and it might be that
04:06
they just broke every single winter but
04:08
i definitely know they broke in 1603 on
04:10
that precise day
04:11
according to whom the 17th century
04:13
malcolm tucker character
04:15
speaking of pr though i was talking uh
04:17
to greg jenner
04:18
and greg jenner who's been on our show a
04:20
number of times historian historian
04:22
horrible histories official
04:24
chief nerd and um he was telling me
04:26
about a publicity stunt as well so this
04:27
was back in the 12th century uh the
04:29
glastonbury abbey burned down
04:30
and all the pilgrims stopped going to it
04:33
uh so
04:34
it was soon after that that the abbot
04:36
found
04:37
uh the body of king arthur in his grave
04:39
and suddenly all the pilgrims started
04:41
returning on mass
04:42
and so greg was saying that this is one
04:43
of the earliest examples of a publicity
04:45
stunt
04:46
where they just needed people to return
04:47
so king arthur is one of the original
04:49
publicists yeah i think what happened
04:50
was it burned down
04:51
and they were like to henry the second
04:53
oh can we have some more money to build
04:54
it and he's like oh we don't have any
04:56
but maybe just maybe if you look closely
04:58
you might be able to find the body of
05:00
king arthur
05:01
and then when okay we'll have a look and
05:02
sure enough the very next day they found
05:04
it oh wow
05:05
what a weird coincidence and it makes it
05:07
such a short time as well incredible
05:09
okay so this is something that i thought
05:11
you would like down so the um holy grail
05:14
yes uh which is kind of an arthurian
05:15
legend as well
05:17
uh it's based probably on an adaptation
05:20
of an old welsh story about the cauldron
05:22
of
05:22
anwin okay which was owned by a guy
05:25
called bran the blessed
05:27
no yeah and if he was a giant a welsh
05:30
giant
05:31
called bran the blessed if you go into
05:33
his wikipedia page it says
05:35
do not confuse him with brian blessing
05:39
that's amazing you can understand why
05:40
you would yeah that's incredible do you
05:42
know any more about him or is it
05:45
on his wikipedia page but i didn't read
05:46
any of it he was real was he
05:49
no no he was a giant oh my god but then
05:51
is is brian blessed real really
05:53
pointless point i'm making who appears
05:54
more real also do you know what the name
05:57
of the sword in the stone was
05:59
i'm going to say excalibur and you're
06:02
looking at me
06:02
like it's wrong it's wrong i'm afraid
06:04
according to mallory and according to
06:06
basically everyone um the sword of the
06:07
stone doesn't have a name and then
06:09
arthur loses it
06:10
and then he gets excalibur from the lady
06:12
of the lake which is a different song
06:14
okay who eventually traps merlin for all
06:17
of eternity
06:18
that's how merlin meets his demise it
06:20
was in some stone as well right
06:21
yeah everything's always been stuck in
06:23
stone in these days yeah they didn't
06:24
have
06:25
carbon fiber they didn't have plastics
06:27
they had to they had to use what they
06:28
had basically
06:29
all their hair was stoned um actually
06:32
just on arthurian legend yeah i think
06:34
i don't know if andy will know this but
06:35
i had no idea about this i thought it
06:36
was really interesting so arthurian
06:38
legends are referred to as
06:40
the mata of britain uh so this is this
06:43
whole body of medieval literature which
06:44
is called
06:45
the mata of britain and there are three
06:47
matters in medieval times there's the
06:48
matter of britain
06:49
the matter of france and the matter of
06:51
rome and these are just the three big
06:52
bits of literature so mata britain's
06:54
arthur
06:54
the matter of france is the um the
06:57
stories of
06:58
um charlemagne and the matter of rome is
07:00
like all awesome roman ancient
07:02
literature so the master of rome is
07:03
absolutely winning
07:04
and the guy who named these was a french
07:06
poet who was called
07:08
bodel and i was thinking when i was
07:09
reading this oh cool we are one of the
07:11
three great tripods of medieval
07:13
literature
07:14
and his description of them was that
07:15
france is character or the matter of
07:17
france is characterized by
07:18
voir or truth rome is characterized by
07:21
sage-ness or
07:22
wisdom or knowledge and the matter of
07:25
britain
07:26
is characterized by being vain a
07:29
to mean frivolous pleasant but
07:31
completely false
07:33
funny you say wise um because that's
07:35
where the word wizard comes from
07:37
is it yeah the whiz part comes from wise
07:40
and i think the idea was that maybe in
07:42
the olden days
07:43
wise people could see the future i think
07:45
that might be okay yeah
07:47
can i quickly talk about modern day
07:48
wizards yeah okay so
07:50
um pagans and druids uh those are the
07:53
sort of modern day
07:54
torchholders of the the whole wizarding
07:56
world i would say and uh interesting
07:58
news in the world of pagan news which is
08:00
that now pagans there's about a million
08:02
in the uk
08:03
300 of whom are in prison prisoned
08:06
pagans
08:06
prisoned wizards are now allowed to have
08:09
a wand in jail
08:10
that's a new ruling that's just been
08:12
made because it's respecting their
08:13
religious
08:14
beliefs so what they have to do is they
08:16
can go into the yard and get some twigs
08:18
and bring them back and then they kind
08:20
of just pimp up the twigs a bit and then
08:21
that's their wand
08:22
that they're allowed to have i think i
08:24
might start a new religion which has
08:26
a skeleton key as a holy symbol
08:30
this article says they've toned down all
08:32
of the rituals because what they're also
08:34
in theory should be having is a flaming
08:36
torch with them
08:37
as part of the religion and they've said
08:39
we're cool to let the flaming torch bit
08:41
go if we can have the twist how many
08:42
wizards are in prison
08:43
300 300 yeah they're all in the same no
08:47
[Laughter]
08:49
i don't actually think it does show
08:51
respect for
08:52
their religion because what basically
08:54
you're saying when you tell wizards that
08:56
they're allowed to have their wand
08:57
in prison is that you definitely don't
09:00
believe their wand has any capacity to
09:01
help them
09:04
i have one last thing which is about
09:06
modern day wizards which is there is a
09:08
school
09:09
in california which is open and it's
09:11
been open for 10 years it's the world's
09:12
only registered wizard academy
09:14
it's got 735 students uh half of whom
09:18
will be in prison uh
09:22
and um they it was set up by a guy
09:24
called oberon zell
09:25
ravenhart and he himself is a wizard but
09:28
the school is up and running you can go
09:29
to their website
09:30
um they have like latest news is that
09:32
the school is now it's called the gray
09:33
school of wizardry they're now on second
09:35
life so you can attend it on second life
09:37
as well
09:38
they have a list of their staff it
09:39
includes people called silvermane swift
09:41
rabbit frogs dancing earthdrum
09:43
m.a apollonis bs ms phd
09:48
and silver lock and so yeah you can uh
09:51
all these people
09:52
just they started out as accountants or
09:53
postman and they got so much mockery for
09:56
their names that they ended up being
09:57
forced into the wizarding profession do
09:59
you think yeah i don't know i don't know
10:00
who does it
10:01
um one more modern wizard oh yeah who's
10:04
great is the real king arthur
10:06
who's back this is a guy who was
10:07
formerly called john rothwell before he
10:09
realized that he was king arthur a few
10:10
years ago
10:11
he's the battle chieftain of the council
10:13
of british druid orders
10:14
there's quite a good interview with him
10:16
in vice and uh the
10:18
vice guy asked him things like how hard
10:20
was it to pull the sword from the stone
10:21
to which he answered very very
10:24
very hard sounds legit
10:28
they tried to trick him with that trick
10:30
question
10:35
the whole point of the sword in the
10:36
stone was that it comes out easily if
10:38
you're the king of england
10:41
they did trick him
10:46
okay and it's time to move on to fact
10:48
number two and that is
10:50
james okay my fact this week is that tea
10:52
leaves sometimes flow
10:53
upstream from the cup to the pot i don't
10:56
believe if i if i was ever going to call
10:58
nonsense on anything never mind king
10:59
arthur being reincarnated
11:01
this is it sounds amazing it is
11:03
incredible it was discovered by
11:05
um by a guy called sebastian bianchini
11:09
in 2008 he was at the university of
11:11
havana and he was pouring hot water from
11:13
a pot which was just water
11:15
into a cup which had um some tea leaves
11:18
some mate leaves
11:19
and as he poured it he had his nice cup
11:21
of tea and then he looked in the pot and
11:23
there were tea leaves there and he
11:24
didn't understand why
11:25
and he went to a physicist at the
11:26
university of havana and they kind of
11:28
did some experiments but then they
11:30
kind of they never published their
11:32
findings because they thought everyone
11:33
would laugh at them
11:35
um but it seems true it seems like it's
11:37
a real thing my god if you
11:39
this is one of those things that you
11:40
could actually demonstrate like you
11:42
could just demonstrate why would people
11:43
laugh
11:44
but they think probably it was a trick
11:45
and he had some tea leaves in there all
11:47
along
11:47
like a darren brown style you'd never be
11:50
able to make any tea
11:51
it would because the leaves would
11:52
constantly be fleeing into the pot
11:55
so it's not all of them it's some of
11:56
them and it's due to this thing called
11:58
the marangoni effect which is
12:00
a mixture of surface tension and a
12:02
little bit of capillary action
12:04
and surface tension basically we're
12:06
talking about
12:07
pure water and not pure water and the um
12:10
the particles want to travel up towards
12:12
the pure water
12:14
and people didn't think it could happen
12:15
with something as big as tea leaves but
12:17
actually it can happen
12:18
um and yeah how big are we talking we're
12:21
talking
12:22
uh this stuff is called mate tea and
12:24
it's usually like little
12:25
they're like almost like little bits of
12:27
sawdust don't they yeah
12:28
yeah it's really small it's very crumbly
12:30
smaller than normal
12:32
yeah um but actually um when things are
12:35
on quite small
12:36
uh scale they can do things that don't
12:38
normally happen
12:39
in for bigger things so like for
12:41
instance capillary action only really
12:43
works for really small
12:44
kind of thin tubes which is that water
12:46
goes up the tube against gravity
12:49
and that wouldn't happen on a normal
12:50
tube but it happens with very thin tubes
12:52
and that's how plants can get the
12:53
water from the ground into the leaves
12:55
yeah yeah okay um did you read the
12:57
guy who commented someone who commented
12:58
at the bottom of this study
13:00
and uh he said this article reminded me
13:03
of when i once made the mistake of
13:04
expectorating into a toilet
13:06
and the result was an immediate acrid
13:08
taste in my mouth apparently the
13:10
chemicals in there had traveled several
13:11
feet up my stream of saliva
13:14
but um that was that was a theory though
13:15
unbelievably disgusting it is quite
13:17
disgusting
13:18
but the scientists acknowledge that that
13:19
could be a possibility although said
13:21
that it might be quite unlikely that
13:22
chemicals could flow
13:23
that way backwards so are we saying that
13:25
when you go to the loo
13:27
in some ways the loo goes to you oh yeah
13:31
uh so i mean it's not very much it's not
13:33
all of it
13:34
uh it's not like you come out of the
13:36
thailand the title is completely empty
13:40
i'm so bloated after that
13:43
well isn't that that thing that all men
13:44
are scared of that amazonian fish where
13:52
it's like a mini little catfish i think
13:54
it's in the catfish family yes
13:56
and um the theory is you would be in the
13:58
water
13:59
and you'd be urinating and it gets
14:01
attracted to the
14:02
um urine stream and then it follows it
14:05
and then goes into your
14:06
penis and um sticks its spines out and
14:09
gets stuck there and can be extremely
14:11
painful and there's been one or two
14:13
stories in the medical literature of it
14:15
happening but most people think probably
14:16
it's not true yeah and i have to say you
14:18
say a little fish i've seen one in the
14:20
natural history museum there's not a
14:22
little fish that is
14:23
remember when we went to yeah that was i
14:26
mean no but that's big
14:27
like it's not like you know that whale
14:29
in the in the front
14:30
lobby yeah it wasn't that one oh okay
14:32
then i misread the label
14:34
no it's about an inch or two yeah i know
14:36
but still the idea of that
14:38
going a upper stream which you know it's
14:40
not
14:41
it's it's like a it's like a teapot
14:43
stream yeah urine it's not a fixed
14:45
well mine's not like anything this was
14:48
apparently the only means of preventing
14:49
it according to one piece of 19th
14:51
century medical literature because this
14:52
room has been around for about 200 years
14:54
that they'll do this
14:55
the only means of preventing it from
14:56
reaching your bladder where it causes
14:58
inflammation and ultimately death
15:00
is to instantly amputate the penis this
15:02
isn't when you get your visa to go to
15:04
the amazon you have to have it done
15:05
as it prevented it yeah
15:09
just a shot in your arsenal and let's
15:11
just get that off shall we
15:12
[Laughter]
15:14
i'm pretty sure that this has completely
15:16
been debunked as an idea
15:18
the candiru going going from you
15:20
standing on the bank
15:21
and having a pit so so the idea is it
15:24
could
15:24
let's say it could possibly happen while
15:26
you're bathing exactly
15:28
perhaps and it just follows the warmth
15:30
of the water or whatever
15:31
but the idea that you're standing on the
15:33
side of a river
15:35
peeing down and then it jumps like a
15:36
salmon into your penis
15:38
yeah i'm pretty sure that doesn't sound
15:40
um
15:41
i was reading about the first ever book
15:43
written about tea
15:44
it's an old chinese text and it's the
15:46
first ever collection of a book on t
15:49
it's called cha-ching
15:56
i actually don't know what that word is
15:57
but oh but the ai ching is a fortune
15:59
telling book isn't it yes
16:00
okay yeah oh yeah maybe it was fortune
16:01
telling through tea leaves book you know
16:03
uh
16:03
india how they what the mythology of how
16:05
tea came about in india is what
16:08
did it get found by a goat herd or is
16:10
that coffee maybe no
16:11
so it was uh about a thousand nine
16:13
hundred years ago and it was a priest
16:15
named hama and uh he was
16:18
um he was trying to connect with zen
16:21
buddhism and the idea that he was going
16:22
to do that was
16:23
seven years sleepless contemplation of
16:25
buddha he found himself in the fifth
16:27
year
16:27
again quite drowsy and needed to cure
16:31
that and so he quickly grabbed some
16:32
leaves off a tree and started chewing on
16:34
them and he thought
16:35
this is fantastic and that just got him
16:37
through that extra two years it really
16:39
perked him up for that final push
16:40
[Laughter]
16:42
and in china they have an idea that it
16:44
was an emperor
16:45
called nunchen who was as well as being
16:48
the emperor as a scholar and herbalist
16:50
and while he was out out in the field on
16:52
maybe i guess a walk or something
16:54
um he was having a hot cup of water and
16:56
some leaves blew into his cup
16:58
and he spelt it and went well that
17:00
smells quite nice i
17:01
love it it's so interesting uh pretty
17:04
much everything
17:05
has an origin myth where it's discovered
17:06
by it's it's it's a bug bear isn't it
17:09
it just seems to be the humans have this
17:11
innate uh preference for that kind of
17:13
discovery rather than someone who really
17:15
knew what they were doing and had
17:16
studied the field and was working really
17:17
hard on it for years
17:18
because we all want to believe that we
17:19
could do it yeah um
17:21
so the the british introduced tea to
17:25
india which sounds lunatic or rather
17:27
they popularized it in india
17:29
so it was already native but it was not
17:32
a thing that was grown in large
17:33
quantities though it wasn't big but then
17:35
in the 19th century britain needed an
17:37
alternative to the chinese tea monopoly
17:40
and so that's why india is now this
17:42
great tea
17:43
nation because we got it in the 17th
17:46
century i think
17:47
was it charles ii's wife i think came
17:50
over and
17:51
brought tea and then everyone thought it
17:52
was like this terrible
17:54
well there's a lot of misogyny and
17:56
xenophobia basically it was a foreign
17:58
thing that women drank
17:59
and also it was it gave women a reason
18:02
for um
18:03
getting together and and men obviously
18:05
thought that was a terrible
18:06
it's very much the it's the lamborghini
18:08
of its day basically
18:10
lambrini was discovered actually when uh
18:13
man was walking across a
18:15
field with some carbonated water
18:19
and a passing bird dropped a rotting
18:20
grave into it
18:22
so can i just bring it back to your main
18:24
headline fact for a second
18:26
so you haven't seen a video of this
18:27
being done no i couldn't find one what
18:29
surely we should be doing that we should
18:31
be filming that we're getting someone
18:32
listening to like
18:33
let's see this let's see okay so it's
18:35
specifically mate yeah which is this
18:37
south american tea which is
18:39
um it's quite a big thing over there
18:41
isn't it you've been through
18:43
yeah i've got a few friends who live
18:44
there and it's pretty much all they do
18:46
i'm amazed to get any work done there um
18:48
but yeah there's a really strict ritual
18:49
around mate tea which is that
18:51
uh the way you drink it is you fill up a
18:54
kettle of boiling water and then you
18:55
pour
18:56
it into this onto all these herbs and
18:58
you keep on topping it up and up so you
18:59
can keep drinking your one mate for
19:01
hours
19:02
but two very important things you have
19:03
to do and people get extremely angry if
19:05
you don't do them
19:06
when it's usually you hand it around so
19:07
it's a real sociable thing it's a very
19:09
much a community thing drinking mate
19:12
and you when you hand it to someone you
19:14
have to look them in the eye
19:15
because that's part of your saying i'm
19:16
giving this to you and you have to give
19:18
it to them with a straw pointing towards
19:20
them
19:20
so it comes with this metal straw and if
19:22
you don't give it to them with a straw
19:24
pointing you
19:24
are um you're kicked out of the country
19:28
no that sounds like it's from bitter
19:29
experience
19:30
[Music]
19:32
um just on t so i think a lot of people
19:34
think that you shouldn't
19:35
reboil a kettle if you boil the water
19:37
once you should use that to make tea and
19:39
then
19:40
the water is sort of no good for making
19:42
tea after that and if you reboil it's
19:43
bad
19:43
and the theory is that all the oxygen
19:45
leeches out of the water
19:47
but the thing is when you boil a kettle
19:50
it leeches off
19:51
the first time you boil a kettle so
19:52
whenever you make a tea you don't have a
19:54
choice you have to make it without
19:55
all that lovely bonus oxygen oh okay do
19:58
you know what i do now if i have a shirt
20:00
that needs ironing i start boiling a
20:02
kettle and as it reaches boiling point i
20:04
take the lid off and all the steam comes
20:06
up but because you've taken the lid off
20:07
it never fully boils so the kettle's
20:09
confused it thinks it's still boiling so
20:10
it keeps going
20:11
so i steam my entire shirt and it steams
20:13
really quickly you can do a whole shirt
20:14
in about a minute
20:16
uh i haven't done it on my shirt
20:20
[Laughter]
20:27
um why don't we put tea bags in the
20:29
kettle as it boils
20:31
that's always confused because someone
20:33
might want coffee
20:35
why would you put tea bags in the kettle
20:37
because i noticed that the british love
20:39
to leave
20:40
in a in a pot tea and let it mull and i
20:43
reckon the intense boiling that's going
20:45
on would absolutely make it just the
20:46
most intense tea
20:48
you could rewrite the book on t you
20:50
could be cha-ching
20:51
the sequel there was a famous quote by
20:54
einstein where he said that his
20:55
best ever idea was to put um to put an
20:59
egg in his soup while it was cooking so
21:02
that his egg and his soup could cook at
21:03
the same time
21:04
see me and einstein are on the same
21:07
thinking level here
21:08
except you're shoving a shirt this is a
21:10
kettlebell bag in it over it
21:12
over it i'm holding it over all dad
21:15
needs in his house is
21:16
one kettle and it does everything yeah
21:18
exactly
21:20
if i need to make some toast i just put
21:22
it in the kennel
21:24
i don't need a hot water bottle i just
21:25
hug the kettle
21:31
[Music]
21:32
okay it is time for fact number three
21:34
and that is my fact
21:36
and my fact this week is that butchers
21:39
in ancient egypt
21:40
wore high heels okay yep and i
21:43
think i'm pretty i'm pretty sure it's
21:45
correct to say that they
21:47
that's the oldest example of high heels
21:49
that we have
21:51
why would they wear high heels because
21:53
apparently it was to do with the
21:54
slaughtering of the animals so
21:56
when they were killing uh all the
21:58
animals um they would find that the
21:59
floor would be blood drenched
22:01
they didn't want to get their feet
22:02
completely stained so the high heels
22:04
just made it a more pleasant
22:06
walking uh process for them so yeah and
22:08
but then people did wear high heels back
22:10
then outside of butchers but i think
22:12
butchers were known
22:13
specifically that was the footwear of
22:14
the job it wasn't you saw someone in
22:16
heels and you went up that's a butcher
22:17
no
22:18
exactly but you might for a second think
22:21
you'd make a good butcher
22:22
because you know how to rock those hills
22:25
exactly yeah and men and women wore them
22:26
obviously um
22:27
back then i thought that they had been
22:29
invented in the ninth
22:30
century right uh in persia yeah i
22:33
thought that as well which is where and
22:35
the reason they were invented there i
22:37
think it might have been a separate
22:38
invention it was so that men could fire
22:39
arrows while on horseback
22:41
it was wow persian archers
22:44
and basically if you wedge your feet
22:46
into these stirrups using a pair of high
22:48
heels you can stand up in the stirrups
22:49
and you can
22:50
fire more steadily from there while
22:52
you're riding a horse you know the uh
22:53
the persians are responsible for
22:55
a huge period of terrible art in egypt
22:59
what yeah so the persians the persians
23:01
took over at about 5 25
23:03
bc um or at least during 525 bc they
23:06
were
23:06
they were running egypt and so what they
23:09
did was all the artists who were in
23:11
egypt who were doing all the
23:12
all of the caskets all the wall art and
23:15
so on
23:15
um they basically deported them so it
23:17
just left egypt with
23:19
terrible artists and you can see all
23:21
these examples this whole period of just
23:22
bad art where people are trying to now
23:24
be the artist and they're just getting
23:25
it
23:26
really just slightly cartoonishly wrong
23:28
are you sure they didn't just go there
23:30
they wanted to give the egyptians a bad
23:31
rep so the persians did a whole bunch of
23:33
kind of fakes really crappy drawings
23:36
look how bad these guys are they also
23:38
played board games
23:40
i didn't know that and toot and calm and
23:41
there's even uh that period those
23:43
drawings where you can just see them
23:44
playing
23:45
board games really yeah well do we know
23:47
what yeah we do we know the names of the
23:48
game so we don't know the rules they
23:50
still debate the exact rules over some
23:51
of the some of the games but there's
23:52
like jackal versus
23:54
dog there's a there's a game that has a
23:56
name
23:59
uh should we do a bet on butchers before
24:01
we move on yeah sure yeah
24:02
um so according to the butcher's guild
24:05
website that i was reading
24:06
um the earliest um kind of butchery that
24:09
they have
24:10
was from a florida sinkhole from 12 000
24:13
years ago
24:14
and it was a butchered giant sloth whoa
24:18
yeah so it was hanging in a little shop
24:21
window somewhere in
24:22
a sinkhole how do we know it's been
24:24
switched out i reckon they will have
24:26
found
24:26
bits of um cutting on the bones
24:29
wow because if you have a butchered
24:31
carcass you can see
24:33
where they've cut deliberately to get
24:34
this p piece of meat away yeah
24:36
but it didn't say on the website so i'm
24:37
not 100 sure and also in that uh
24:39
sinkhole they found a sharpened stick
24:41
and a tortoise
24:43
do we think the tortoise was the one
24:45
that butchered the slope
24:50
um did you know i didn't realize that
24:52
one of the theories of how tutankhamun
24:53
died was that he got eaten by a
24:54
hippopotamus
24:56
yeah yeah that's an actual thing no i
24:58
don't think that is right is it oh well
25:00
no no that he got killed by it he got
25:02
killed but he didn't get eaten because
25:03
he's buried in a very unconventional way
25:05
so he's missing
25:06
a massive hippopotamus on the end of his
25:08
body
25:11
um no he's just he's missing his heart
25:13
it looks like he's someone something's
25:15
committed some kind of horrific injury
25:17
to him whereby it's consumed his heart
25:19
he put him in jazz unless there's
25:21
something where his heart used to be
25:22
saying the hippo took this i think he
25:25
could he was embalmed without his heart
25:26
anywhere so usually the heart would be
25:28
there and the heart was missing and it's
25:29
obviously the obvious conclusion you
25:30
jump through the heart's missing is it a
25:31
hippo took it what sort of freaking
25:33
vampire hippo is this that can
25:34
with surgical precision remove someone's
25:37
heart
25:39
doesn't go back like the evil
25:42
[Laughter]
25:45
this is one of the ancient egyptian
25:46
board games they played with hungry
25:47
hungry hippos
25:48
[Laughter]
25:50
look it does the sauce does specify a
25:51
handful of egyptologists believe this
25:53
so i've seen it in a bunch of places
25:55
yeah it's thought because um
25:57
hunting big animals like that was
25:59
popular and there are pictures of
26:00
cartoon carmouna
26:01
doing things like that in his tomb and
26:04
um
26:05
he that's that's a theory guys um i just
26:08
have one last thing i was reading about
26:09
laundry men of ancient egypt
26:11
they would take all the clothes um from
26:13
people's houses and they would leave
26:15
little tokens
26:16
that they would draw the picture of the
26:17
clothes they took leave it with you so
26:19
it's like we have these items
26:21
and make sure that they come back what
26:23
did they do after all of egypt's good
26:24
artists were removed
26:26
they couldn't tell which item they drawn
26:28
exactly
26:29
um but they would go down to the nile
26:31
and they would wash all their clothes
26:33
and one of the hazards of being a
26:34
laundry man back in ancient egypt was
26:36
that it was likely that you were going
26:37
to be eaten by a crocodile
26:39
because they hung around on the banks so
26:40
much they must be delighted when kettles
26:43
were invented
26:44
you don't see any creased shirts in any
26:47
hieroglyphs here
26:51
okay it is time for our final fact of
26:53
the show and that
26:54
is andy my fact is that there is a fish
26:57
called the amazonian wood eating catfish
27:00
but it is unable to digest wood
27:04
okay it is a catfish though it is a
27:06
catfish yeah
27:07
it was discovered a few years ago in
27:09
about 2010 and um
27:11
we've known for a while that there are
27:12
loads of catfish which
27:14
sort of suck wood um the candirus um
27:20
they're called sucker mouth armored
27:21
catfish and they they scrape wood with
27:23
their teeth to get
27:24
uh organic material off it so they like
27:26
algae and bacteria and things that are
27:28
found clinging to wood
27:29
in rivers but this new fish it literally
27:32
eats the wood
27:33
and it die digests the biological
27:37
material
27:37
on the wood and it living inside the
27:39
wood and then it excretes the wood four
27:41
hours later so it it so it has the most
27:43
painful
27:44
bathroom visit about twice a day
27:48
um so and it absorbs all the organic
27:50
products and the tiny animals that live
27:51
on the wood and
27:52
it has special spoon-shaped teeth as
27:54
well and it's just i think it's amazing
27:56
that this thing eats wood and then
27:58
gets rid of all the wood apparently um
28:01
it's really hard to fish for them
28:03
because they don't go for bait but a lot
28:06
of fishing rods are made out of wood so
28:07
you could hold on to them
28:11
go the opposite way you're right yeah do
28:13
you know how you do catch them you
28:14
listen out for them
28:16
because they make this rasping noise
28:17
which is them going
28:19
on the wood that they're eating yeah but
28:21
this is the weird thing
28:23
we can't digest wood but i think the
28:26
reason for this
28:27
i might be wrong about this but i think
28:28
it is that we don't have organisms in
28:30
our gut
28:31
which produce the enzyme cellulase right
28:34
so
28:34
wood pulp is cellulose and if you have
28:36
the enzyme cellulase
28:37
you can digest it yeah so my question is
28:40
if we did
28:41
inject somebody with those organisms
28:44
which do produce cellulites would we be
28:46
able to digest trees i think you would
28:48
you'd be able to do it just in like a
28:49
probiotic you wouldn't have to inject it
28:51
into anyone
28:52
why why haven't we done this i bet
28:53
you've got you know those gross looking
28:54
smoothies do something to the obviously
28:56
i bet they're
29:00
i think really you could do but actually
29:03
it's easier to get the calories
29:05
out of a cream cake than it is to get it
29:07
out of a stick
29:08
even if you do have cereals yeah i'm
29:11
sure
29:12
is there any species of tree that we do
29:13
eat i know probably it's not a tree but
29:15
it kind of looks like wine
29:16
but we did used to eat bark um well our
29:19
ancestors used to eat bark so they
29:20
discovered this quite recently
29:22
um so gorillas and also chimps sometimes
29:24
chew on bart okay so are
29:26
really far back super far before humans
29:28
were actually a thing it was another
29:30
hominid i think it was the
29:32
astrolopithecus sediba
29:34
which is a two million year old ancestor
29:36
of humans and they recently found some
29:38
with bark stuck in its teeth and so yeah
29:40
we used to chew on that
29:41
this is another toot and car moon hippo
29:43
heart mystery
29:45
that sounds more like they invented the
29:46
toothpick
29:49
what a brilliant rival theory you should
29:51
write to the archaeologists
29:53
some tribes might use sticks for
29:55
cleaning their teeth wouldn't they i
29:56
think they have things you can chew on
29:58
yeah uh isn't cinnamon made out of bark
30:01
cinnamon sticks don't we get aspirin
30:03
from powdered
30:04
bark do we originally yeah so we're
30:07
eating a lot more wood than we realized
30:08
i like you know ants can't most ants
30:11
can't really digest solid food because
30:12
they've got that really tiny waste
30:14
they've got like smaller waste of
30:15
marilyn monroe so they have to liquefy
30:17
their food before they digest it
30:19
really i don't know any of that what
30:21
ants can't digest
30:23
lumps of food because like no i can
30:25
imagine they can't eat like a donut
30:27
because it's bigger than that but are
30:29
you saying they can't have any kind of
30:31
solid soil they liquefy it so
30:32
and the way that they liquefy it is they
30:34
feed it to their lava first so their
30:36
larvae
30:36
um can digest solid food can eat solid
30:39
food
30:40
so what ants do is they have the larvae
30:43
and they will put it into their
30:44
larvae's mouths and the larvae will eat
30:47
this food and their
30:48
stomachs will or their bodies will
30:49
release the enzymes required to break it
30:51
down into a more palatable smoothie type
30:53
form and then they'll regurgitate it and
30:54
give it to their parents
30:55
so they're using the larvae like a
30:57
blender yeah and
30:58
also and also like a plate because
31:02
some of the larvae they don't the larvae
31:03
don't even eat it some of the larvae
31:05
just secrete the enzymes onto the top of
31:07
their stomachs
31:08
so the worker ants come back with solid
31:09
food drops a bit of food onto the larvae
31:11
stomach the larvae knows it just has to
31:13
lie there
31:14
let it digest and then the ant comes
31:15
back a bit later and eats it off the
31:17
larvae stomach
31:18
catfish stuff yeah yeah um so catfish
31:21
can they can hunt in the dark by
31:24
detecting
31:25
the changes in acidity in water because
31:27
their whiskers have got this special
31:29
kind of
31:30
sensor for acid so you can tell if
31:32
something's a bit more acid or a bit
31:34
less acid and they can find things using
31:35
that
31:36
just one more thing on a really cool
31:37
species of wood eating creature
31:39
that's also underwater is a crab
31:42
so there's this kind of crab which the
31:44
only thing it can eat is wood and yet it
31:45
lives at the bottom of the ocean so it
31:47
can live up to 1.5 kilometers underwater
31:49
right there are not many trees
31:50
not a lot of trees at all so there is
31:52
nothing in its habitat that grows that
31:54
it can possibly eat and it has to rely
31:56
on wood falling into the water
31:58
yeah i mean that is yeah it doesn't
32:00
matter that you've grown grown up in an
32:01
environment where there's nothing for
32:03
you to eat
32:03
imagine how annoying that would be so so
32:05
they have to literally just wait for
32:08
trunks to find their way and then
32:09
suddenly that's their meal just as a
32:11
community for the next
32:12
yeah or nothing trees break down as they
32:14
get further and further yeah you see so
32:16
you'll get little scraps of wood
32:18
or a ship yeah some of them do live on
32:20
shipwrecks yeah
32:21
oh that must be bliss when a huge ship
32:23
breaks
32:24
titanic was the best moment in their
32:26
history
32:30
there's an upside down catfish what what
32:34
it's they're found in central congo and
32:36
they're notable because we they swim
32:38
upside down because they feed on insects
32:41
on the surface of the water so they kind
32:42
of just kind of backstroke their way
32:44
through and just oh my god
32:45
them off the surface and there are even
32:48
ancient egyptian paintings of them
32:50
upside down but now i think maybe it was
32:51
just a badly drawn yeah
32:58
okay that's it that's all of our facts
33:00
thank you so much for listening if you
33:01
would like to get in contact with any of

00:00
[Music]
00:12
hello
00:13
and welcome to another episode of no
00:15
such thing as a fish
00:16
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
00:18
qi offices in covent garden
00:20
my name is dan schreiber i am sitting
00:22
here with andy murray anna chazinski and
00:25
james harkin
00:26
and once again we have gathered around
00:28
the microphones with our four favorite
00:29
facts from the last seven days
00:31
and in no particular order here we go
00:33
starting with you
00:35
andrew hunter murray my fact is that
00:37
farmers in botswana have started
00:39
painting eyes on their cows bottoms to
00:41
stop lions from attacking them
00:45
so good we don't need anything more yeah
00:50
number two does it work andy
00:53
well this is the really interesting
00:55
thing this is in the trial
00:57
stages at the moment so it's by a
00:58
british conservation biologist called
01:00
neil
01:00
jordan uh he works in australia and
01:02
botswana so
01:03
we're in botswana here and um he
01:06
he wanted to trick lions into thinking
01:09
that they've been spotted when they're
01:10
sneaking up on a cow or whatever
01:13
so um he has been working in the
01:15
okavango delta
01:16
and he did a trial last year where 23
01:19
cows
01:20
had eyes painted on their bottoms they
01:23
all survived
01:24
and in the rest of the herd there were
01:25
39 cows which were not painted and of
01:27
those cows
01:28
three were eaten by lions so it's a very
01:32
small sample size so he is
01:33
literally i wrote to him and said can
01:35
you um paint some eyes on my bottom
01:37
please
01:38
um and he this coming monday in a few
01:41
days is going to botswana again he's
01:42
going to try a larger sample group
01:44
and the idea is that it's a very cheap
01:46
way of stopping her being eaten so the
01:47
cost
01:48
of painting a herd for a year is is much
01:51
less than the value of one cow being
01:53
eaten
01:54
it's not cheap if the cows value their
01:55
self-respect though is it no
01:57
it's probably a very expensive social
01:59
sacrifice they look like elephants
02:01
actually because of their tails sticking
02:02
out between the
02:03
lions i'm gonna put up a photo on my
02:05
twitter feed andrew hunter m and i'll uh
02:07
you can see what they look like
02:08
they should teach them to reverse as
02:10
well they told them to walk backwards
02:12
to make it really realistic you know
02:14
they did the same thing to people
02:16
for the same reason
02:19
so in 1989 i found this in an old
02:22
edition of the new york times in 1989
02:24
thousands of face masks were issued by
02:26
the forestry reserve in
02:27
india to a bunch of people who were
02:30
living near the ganges where tigers kept
02:31
killing people and the face masks were
02:33
to wear on the back of their heads
02:34
and they found that within something
02:36
like a year and a half nobody wearing
02:38
the face mask on the back of their head
02:39
so that they had a face on the back of
02:40
their head got attacked
02:42
and so the way to avoid tiger attack is
02:44
to look at it
02:45
in the face yeah they won't jump at you
02:48
of course they will it's like tigers
02:50
would obviously rather sneak up on you
02:51
from behind
02:52
i think they're not attacking you
02:53
because you've got two faces it's like
02:55
if you go to a supermarket and you don't
02:57
buy the
02:57
kind of the straight bananas yeah the
02:59
bananas that look weird you don't buy
03:01
them you only buy the ones that look
03:02
nice
03:03
there's a company which has started
03:04
selling ugly fruit and vegetables yeah
03:05
because they're cheaper
03:06
and they sell really misshapen
03:08
disgusting looking tomatoes but they're
03:09
completely the same nutritionally yeah
03:12
france i think yeah and they just had a
03:14
new rule in france to say that
03:16
supermarkets have to give any food which
03:19
is about to go past
03:20
sell by date to homeless people that's
03:22
so
03:23
good yeah a lot of them did it anyway
03:25
but the laws come in now to say they
03:26
have to
03:27
can't believe we don't all do that it
03:29
seems so obvious
03:30
um speaking of cows bums very quickly
03:33
have you guys heard of i hadn't heard of
03:35
this so i apologize if this is very well
03:37
known but have you heard of cow blowing
03:39
the idea is that they want to induce
03:40
more milk from the cow so what they do
03:42
is they lift up the tail
03:44
and they blow into its butt
03:47
yeah and or vagina so it's one of the
03:50
two
03:51
it's always a common thing isn't that
03:52
where people say
03:54
milking a cow who was the first person
03:57
to ever think of that like that must be
03:58
one sick individual
04:00
but then i would say it's an even sicker
04:01
individual who first blows into a cow's
04:04
vagina
04:05
and they think wow they gave me even
04:07
more milk i agree i know i don't
04:09
but like weirdly it is done and gandhi
04:12
supposedly didn't drink milk because he
04:13
hated this process
04:14
so he was like if you're gonna blow cows
04:16
i'm not gonna get involved
04:18
that's one of his favorite quotes
04:20
actually it's attributed to him
04:22
i think it might have been churchill
04:26
there is an actual quote just for the
04:27
sake of saying it since i had come to
04:29
know that the cow and the buffalo was
04:31
subjected to the process
04:32
of it's called ph double okay
04:36
of course it is this is i had conceived
04:39
a strong disgust for milk
04:41
so it's called yeah it's called cowboy
04:43
and wait do you do you just have to
04:45
get in there no they sometimes do it
04:46
with a tube or they sometimes
04:48
sometimes with achievements you should
04:50
watch youtube videos that are amazing
04:52
sorry gary we've um we've forgotten the
04:54
tube today again so
04:56
oh no gary that's the wrong end of the
04:58
tube oh gary
05:02
no gary you're meant to blow
05:09
it's also called insufflation and yeah
05:12
it's quite common in african countries
05:14
um in kenya and tanzania i think they do
05:17
it quite a bit but you should watch
05:18
videos they look hilarious they just
05:19
lift up the tail and thrust their noses
05:20
right in there don't they
05:21
yeah because it's been around since
05:23
herodotus who was the first person the
05:25
first
05:26
i know i know it's not a great start any
05:28
scientific thing
05:29
but herodotus described this happening
05:31
in horses so he said that people would
05:32
insert a tube
05:33
into the mare's anus then blow
05:39
[Laughter]
05:42
so this fact is about bottoms yes that
05:45
this is not the only bottom related
05:46
story in the week's news
05:48
yeah okay so i don't know whether you've
05:50
seen this but in the times recently
05:51
there was a tiny article
05:53
about a robot bottom which has been
05:56
invented
05:57
for doctors to learn how to do prostate
06:00
exams i'm very indebted to
06:02
tom whipple who's the science editor at
06:04
the times
06:05
so he he told me a bit about this um it
06:08
has prosthetic buttocks and an
06:10
adjustable rectum
06:11
the really exciting thing is what this
06:12
is designed to replace
06:14
and there is a system at the moment
06:15
which is that there is someone in the uk
06:18
whose job is rectal teaching assistant
06:21
he goes around the country lending out
06:22
his bottom to prostate
06:24
trainees is there only one person
06:27
there's only one person in the entire
06:28
united kingdom who goes around with his
06:30
his boss i've written to his people but
06:33
they haven't got back to me yeah he has
06:34
people
06:35
he has people yeah so is he furious that
06:37
this robotic thumb is now
06:39
he's very glad and he won't be losing
06:41
his job because he is also very
06:42
important it's just that he's quite
06:43
overworked at the moment because
06:46
he's just one of them
06:51
he provides very useful feedback on what
06:53
it's what the procedure is like from a
06:54
patient's point of view
06:56
and presumably you can't feel anything
06:57
at this point oh come on
06:59
you can't possibly have the average
07:00
rectum anymore
07:03
i think this man's a bloody hero i
07:04
really do
07:06
yeah how did he fall into that job that
07:08
is no incredible
07:10
so this guy probably doesn't suffer from
07:12
another condition called
07:13
dormant's bottom syndrome
07:17
what's that this is a real syndrome um
07:20
it's
07:20
a guy called chris colbert who's a
07:23
sports uh medical guy
07:24
and he reckons that the increased
07:26
sedentary lifestyle of humans
07:29
means you sit down all the time and it
07:30
means your gluteus maximus doesn't get
07:32
enough
07:33
exercise and this the muscle isn't
07:35
strong enough and it means that other
07:36
parts of your leg get a lot more stress
07:38
so your knees might get more stress or
07:39
your hips might
07:41
because a lot of work that would be done
07:42
by your gluteus is not done by that
07:44
anymore
07:45
that's very interesting wow cool so a
07:47
good way to avoid the
07:49
agonizing knee joint pain i'm already
07:50
getting age 30 is to stand up
07:52
more do more squats do more squats and
07:54
then you won't have dormant bottom
07:55
syndrome
07:56
that's amazing have you guys heard of
07:59
skipper caterpillars
08:00
no no these are very cool animals
08:02
basically caterpillars get preyed on a
08:04
lot
08:05
and uh one of the ways the predators
08:06
find them is they trace them by their
08:08
poo
08:08
so it's bad as a caterpillar to be near
08:11
your own poo
08:12
but skipper caterpillars they have a
08:13
trick which they can do which is to
08:15
fling their poo as if from a catapult um
08:19
they have a flap under their anus and
08:21
they build up blood pressure
08:23
to build up pressure and pressure and
08:24
pressure and then eventually they fling
08:25
their poo
08:26
they can fling it um 40 times their own
08:29
body length
08:30
wow so that's the equivalent of a human
08:32
being able to throw their own poo
08:33
80 meters wow you do get arrested for
08:36
that as if you don't know
08:38
what
08:41
james that's really yeah i know it is
08:43
but i'm taking like okay
08:45
let's say a um a discus world record is
08:48
going to be around 80 meters like that
08:50
yeah yeah that's a discus they
09:04
i think the record will be much lower
09:08
it'll be a great spectator sport
09:11
the [ __ ] pot or
09:15
the disc arse
09:16
[Laughter]
09:18
[Music]
09:20
okay it is time for fact number two and
09:23
that is
09:23
james okay my fact this week is that my
09:26
top speed running in armor
09:28
is the same as the top speed of a
09:30
snowflake falling to earth
09:33
how have you have you tested this no so
09:36
i read this in a study
09:38
um by graham n askew at al it's in the
09:41
proceedings of the royal society
09:43
and they said that a 38 year old man can
09:45
sustain a maximum
09:47
speed in armor of 1.7 meters per second
09:50
and i'm not quite 38 but i'm a bit out
09:52
of shape so
09:53
i reckon that's about my maximum speed
09:55
and according to the internet especially
09:57
uh the telegraph of the 7th of january
09:59
2010
10:01
the average snowflake has a top speed of
10:03
1.7 meters per second as well
10:05
oh so you work this out yeah because i
10:08
was looking for the article when you
10:09
mentioned this and i couldn't find the
10:10
scientific experiment where
10:12
a man in armor raced a snowflake to a
10:14
destination
10:16
it takes the average snowflake an hour
10:18
uh the journey from the cloud to the
10:19
ground
10:20
wow yeah it's an hour's trip oh that's
10:22
all is in an hour's run amazing
10:23
this is the fastest that um a snowflake
10:26
can reach
10:27
i think rather than the average yeah
10:29
right okay
10:31
it's the hussein bolt of snowflakes yes
10:33
yeah quite right
10:34
uh some other things are 1.7 meters per
10:36
second according to the internet
10:38
uh it's the speed when ponies tend to
10:40
change from walking to trotting
10:42
nice it's the kind of average speed of a
10:46
hundred meter freestyle racer
10:48
during the 1972 olympics swimming
10:51
uh and it's the speed that trapdoor ants
10:54
um
10:55
trapdoor themselves away from predators
10:57
because they can kind of jump away from
10:58
predators
10:59
but for them that's really fast because
11:00
they're tiny yeah exactly that's very
11:02
cool
11:03
um 1.7 meters a second i'm struggling to
11:06
get a grip on how fast that is
11:07
in miles an hour is that like a really
11:09
fast walk or is it a small
11:10
yeah it is you could probably run about
11:13
twice that
11:14
just under twice that speed without any
11:15
armor because actually armor isn't as
11:17
heavy and awkward as people used to
11:19
think it was there's this kind of meme
11:20
of
11:21
people in massive suits of armor hardly
11:23
being able to move at all but actually
11:24
that's not true to life because
11:26
obviously that'd be ridiculous in a
11:27
battle
11:28
if everyone could just kind of
11:30
apparently those swords weren't
11:31
as heavy as we think they were either
11:33
because the other thing is the swords of
11:35
these
11:35
huge like incredibly heavy uh
11:38
weapons and actually they were never
11:40
more than five
11:43
five five that's quite quite long
11:46
i thought five was quite heavy actually
11:49
oh i've been working out
11:51
this is interesting because there was a
11:53
study in 2011 um which
11:56
put knights on a treadmill or put people
11:58
in suits of armor on a treadmill
11:59
and they got tired they thought the one
12:01
problem was that you're wearing
12:03
a backplate and a breastplate and
12:05
basically you can't take a huge breath
12:06
in you can only take small shallow
12:09
breaths which means that you do get
12:10
quite tired quite quickly because you
12:11
can't get enough oxygen to your muscles
12:13
so it's this new study seems to
12:16
completely
12:16
contradict that one i'm not sure i mean
12:18
you say they got tired did they put them
12:19
on the treadmill at high speed for eight
12:20
hours because
12:22
we need to qualify at what point they
12:23
got tired on the treadmill they ran for
12:25
23.
12:28
they found it used twice as much energy
12:30
as doing the same thing without armor in
12:32
this previous experiment well actually
12:34
this experiment as well
12:35
they they're saying yes definitely it
12:37
takes more energy and it's harder to
12:39
walk at any speed in armor
12:41
um but actually it's just not as much as
12:42
you think right
12:44
well okay so here's the thing you know
12:45
they have actual joust these days i mean
12:47
there are genuine competitions which
12:49
take place so there's there's one woman
12:51
called nikki willis but she jousts as
12:54
uh oh it's it's uh saint
12:57
retham because she's from stratum and
12:59
she says she's of saint brethren
13:01
uh so she's brilliant and she has just
13:04
taken part
13:05
last month in the first ever competitive
13:07
joust between a man and a woman oh great
13:09
and i didn't know this about jousting
13:10
that you do you know what you get points
13:11
for
13:12
i think it's where you hit them on the
13:13
body isn't exactly it's not knocking
13:15
somebody down
13:16
it's like a dart board yeah and it's the
13:18
article i read said it was a
13:19
pre-arranged thing as though you have to
13:21
like in like in pool where you name the
13:23
pocket you're going to think and you say
13:24
right i'm going to hit him on the
13:25
shoulder or whatever um i'm not sure
13:28
whether it's that or whether it is just
13:29
like a dart board where you get most
13:30
points fishing them in the helmet i
13:32
thought
13:32
i thought in the olden days it was like
13:34
trouble 20 would be your helmet
13:38
if you got them on that thin line where
13:39
the eyes are
13:41
jousting didn't really exist in medieval
13:42
times it was the malay that was the big
13:44
sport that they do which in the malay
13:46
was lots of people
13:47
galloping towards each other and a bit
13:49
of a sideline at these big malay
13:50
festivals would be the joust which no
13:52
one really watched and no one cared
13:53
about
13:54
and then as decided these ideas of
13:55
chivalry and this one night
13:57
ruling above everyone and attracting the
13:59
best women and stuff came
14:00
into the fall in tudor times then the
14:02
joust took uh
14:03
became the centerpiece of these
14:05
tournaments i remember reading about the
14:06
melee wasn't it that
14:08
um i read about one where it was like
14:11
the french and the english were all
14:12
taking part and then the french kind of
14:14
cheated or the english cheated the
14:16
english eater but they copied the french
14:17
so the english cheated by saying they
14:19
weren't going to get involved in a malay
14:20
i think this is in the kind of stood on
14:22
the side and went oh you guys carry on
14:24
and then as soon as everyone else was
14:25
tired and lost all the fingers and stuff
14:26
they kind of ran in here
14:28
there were several nations fighting i
14:29
think that was it the english just sort
14:31
of hung around on the edge
14:32
maybe we should have done that in the
14:33
euros just sat out the first few rounds
14:35
instead of the last few rounds
14:38
put it the wrong way around guys do you
14:40
know what um so this is a cool thing the
14:42
whole medieval thing got kick-started in
14:43
the 19th century they have kickstarter
14:46
yeah um no it was in 1839 there was a
14:50
thing called the eglinton tournament and
14:52
it was this
14:53
quite eccentric lord called lord
14:54
eglinton who just said i'm going to
14:56
revive the idea of chivalry we've been
14:58
going without it for too long
14:59
and he hosted this massive medieval
15:01
tournament but it was in scotland
15:02
unfortunately which meant that it was a
15:04
total washout
15:06
like huge rains huge storms huge winds
15:09
and the whole thing was a disaster and
15:12
the the the tilting yard had this huge
15:14
roof there were huge crowds and then it
15:15
started
15:16
leaking uh and basically the crowds did
15:18
not come back on the second day but he
15:20
just had paintings done which made it
15:21
look amazing
15:22
and then everyone else said oh well this
15:24
is great we should do this so and
15:25
everyone looked at those went oh do you
15:26
remember the great
15:27
tournament of 1836 or whatever exactly
15:30
yeah cool
15:31
you know there were quite a lot of
15:32
paintings of female um jousters
15:34
and knights in armor because you were
15:36
mentioning one earlier and you think you
15:37
think of women as not having been really
15:39
involved in that but um
15:40
there were a few feet there are a few
15:42
female knights in history so i can only
15:43
think of joan of arc there's joe nevada
15:46
lady in um game of thrones there was
15:48
obviously her i think she was
15:50
yes yeah 14th 15th century brienne of
15:52
task
15:54
yep there was a noble woman called the
15:56
countess
15:57
jean de pontieve but um there are quite
15:59
a few medieval depictions of women in
16:01
armor jousting and stuff but it was
16:03
thought to be improper to show them with
16:05
something
16:06
as phallic as a joust and so they'd show
16:08
them in jousting tournaments
16:10
carrying a distaff which is one of those
16:12
um needles that you wrap
16:14
uh wool round when you're when you're
16:16
sewing you would think that instead of
16:17
painting the uh gels they paint like a
16:20
vagina or something yeah
16:22
i think you're gonna come with a weapon
16:23
that looks like a vagina i couldn't
16:25
think of any
16:26
if i could have thought of one i would
16:27
have said it i know there aren't other
16:29
no it's harder because longer and
16:31
pointier things is what was
16:32
traditionally used in battles
16:34
yeah a bear trap
16:38
that's pretty messed up
16:43
don't blow into that vagina
16:47
[Music]
16:49
okay it is time for fact number three
16:51
and that is my fact
16:52
my fact this week is that archaeologists
16:54
have started throwing artifacts into
16:56
skips
16:57
because there is now too much history
16:58
for them to store
17:00
there's just there's too much history
17:01
they're finding too many bits of history
17:04
and all of their back rooms are getting
17:06
clogged up and they don't know what to
17:07
do with them it costs too much to store
17:08
them
17:09
so they just have to throw them away so
17:10
what happens is you put it all in the
17:12
landfill
17:13
and then in another thousand years they
17:14
come to this landfill with
17:16
loads of different types of history
17:18
they'll have some victorian stuff some
17:20
roman stuff and they'll think wow
17:22
all these people live together yes with
17:24
tvs and
17:25
time travel happened they cracked it
17:27
this is one amazing point
17:29
guys we're screwing with the future this
17:31
is terrible
17:32
we need to read leave notes in landfill
17:34
saying this this did not all come at
17:37
once
17:37
um it's really interesting they're being
17:39
told lots of local community archaeology
17:41
groups find things they take them to
17:43
museums but because of lots of funding
17:45
cuts
17:45
the museums then say we have no storage
17:47
and then i think they have to give them
17:49
back to the
17:50
people who own the land that was found
17:52
on yes and those guys
17:53
who own the land might just keep them in
17:55
their house and if they die or move then
17:57
their inheritance or the next people
17:58
might think this is rubbish and throw it
17:59
away yeah
18:01
and the museums the museums have to
18:03
charge it's like uh taking out a po box
18:06
as it were um for mail to be delivered
18:08
to
18:09
from somewhere that's not your house
18:11
it's you pay for a box if you want
18:13
something to be put in a museum and that
18:14
can range between 20 pounds and 600
18:16
pounds
18:17
so you're effectively saying i'd like to
18:18
donate this bit of history to you guys
18:20
but then i now need to pay to have it
18:22
stored as well and people can't afford
18:23
that so
18:24
yeah just things are being thrown away
18:26
it's terrible and it doesn't sound like
18:28
people are finding you know full statues
18:30
of
18:31
cleopatra and chucking them away i think
18:33
it's obviously shards of pottery
18:35
that do have uh amazing uh you know
18:38
inscriptions on them and so on but they
18:40
have lots of examples of it so
18:42
there's an excellent article on cracks i
18:44
love it when cracks does articles
18:45
written by someone with this job but
18:47
there was this article on cracked by an
18:48
archaeologist called hadas levine and
18:50
she's
18:50
an israeli archaeologist and she said
18:52
they throw away about 65
18:53
of what they find and the bits of
18:55
pottery that the only bits of pottery
18:57
that are useful at the bottom and the
18:58
top because
18:59
it's only at the lip and the base that
19:00
you can really date it and all the stuff
19:02
in between you just chuck it straight
19:03
back unless it's got she said unless
19:04
it's got some really cool thing like a
19:06
an engraving of a penis on it and then
19:08
obviously you keep it because we love
19:09
that
19:10
they're very similar to us in that way
19:13
and remember andy you ages ago were
19:15
telling me
19:15
about uh the fact that there was a new
19:17
train system that was
19:19
being built and as they were digging
19:21
this was in istanbul i think and as they
19:23
were looking there was just too much
19:24
history
19:24
rome was this rome is having another
19:27
underground line built at the moment
19:29
and they just they had to delay it three
19:31
times now because they keep finding
19:33
oh well it's another massive barracks
19:35
full of statues and you know ancient
19:37
importance tables and things like this
19:38
so yeah
19:39
i think that happened with crossrail a
19:40
bit as well didn't it they were finding
19:41
things they kept finding plague pits
19:43
when they first built these
19:45
yeah i think there's a kink in i'm going
19:47
to say it's in the
19:49
piccadilly line but obviously some
19:50
people listening would know but i think
19:52
there's a kink in it which goes around
19:54
the plague pit
19:55
right that must be a classic problem of
19:57
anyone building or yeah
19:59
rail and i think if we mentioned before
20:00
that with hs2 there was an archaeologist
20:02
shortage
20:02
and there still is yeah if you're
20:04
listening to this and you're wondering
20:05
what to do with your life
20:06
become an archaeologist or go around
20:08
letting people put their finger on your
20:10
thumb
20:11
there's a shortage in there too it's
20:13
just a binary choice now
20:14
all other jobs are filled i went onto
20:17
a website called it's a tumblr called
20:20
archaeologist problems and there's a few
20:23
of those
20:24
one of them is being asked if giants
20:28
really exist
20:29
but their discovery is covered up by the
20:32
museums apparently that's something they
20:34
get asked quite a lot
20:36
i thought i was being original with that
20:38
question archaeologist joy's
20:40
finding massive amounts of
20:41
well-preserved artifacts in one small
20:43
location
20:44
followed by archaeologists problems said
20:47
small location
20:48
is a privy and the smell is stuck on
20:50
your clothing your hair
20:51
your field gear everything
20:54
they have also a problem they have is
20:57
getting teased in europe before
20:59
sharpening your trowel
21:00
and getting teased in the u.s for not
21:03
sharpening your trowel
21:05
archaeologists can be so cruel yeah
21:09
but i think this is a good tip because
21:11
andy you're saying that people should
21:12
become archaeologists
21:14
maybe if you're going to become one then
21:16
make sure you always sharpen your trowel
21:18
in the us but don't do it in europe you
21:21
better have got that the right way
21:22
around james because
21:23
if you're responsible for the rampant
21:25
bullying of all archaeologists
21:27
henceforth
21:27
if you're going to become an
21:28
archaeologist maybe become a u.s one so
21:30
that if you get into a fight with a
21:31
non-us archaeologist you'll have a sharp
21:33
trout
21:34
[Music]
21:35
so just on things being thrown away by
21:37
mistake in 2014 bournemouth council they
21:40
launched this new
21:41
scheme where it was a food waste
21:43
collection service and you basically had
21:45
your own
21:45
little bin which clipped on inside your
21:47
bin yeah and then bin men
21:49
accidentally threw away a hundred of the
21:50
little bins
21:53
because of that matter you know uh
21:56
a huge number of coins get thrown away
21:58
coins that add up to a massive value so
22:00
i was looking at a study which was
22:02
called a statistical analysis of coins
22:04
lost in circulation
22:06
and uh it said that in 1995 but i can't
22:08
see why it would have changed much
22:10
uh the average one cent coin in america
22:13
had a 0.3
22:14
circulation rate so i think that
22:15
probably means for every one coin that
22:17
you put in circulation you get 0.3 coins
22:19
back
22:20
so pretty much 70 of coins never come
22:22
back in they just
22:23
well you know you chug a coin into like
22:24
a pot and you never use it again or it
22:26
falls down the back of the sofa
22:27
well down a well happens with pennies
22:30
especially
22:31
so they've estimated that three billion
22:33
dollars worth of pennies
22:34
go missing every year every year yeah
22:38
if you could get all those pennies but
22:41
you can't
22:41
you can't and i think it ceases to be
22:44
legal tender after you pay
22:45
20 p's worth of um copper what
22:48
seriously something like that it's 20
22:50
something p i think so
22:51
if you want to pay for something um and
22:54
you want to pay just in pennies
22:56
they can still accept it if they want to
22:58
but they don't legally have to accept it
23:00
anything over i think it's 20
23:02
but it might be more that is fascinating
23:04
there are those machines now though in
23:05
the supermarkets where you can put them
23:06
in yeah you'll probably be there for
23:08
about
23:08
three billion i did they have those in
23:12
australia as well and when i moved there
23:13
temporarily and i was unemployed i had
23:15
no money but uh my boyfriend had a lot
23:17
of change lying around the house so i
23:18
went and collected it all up collected
23:20
or stole
23:22
you went over at night when he was
23:23
asleep and collected it but yeah i
23:26
remember just feeling like
23:27
such a weird person walking up to the
23:29
bank with this enormous
23:30
suitcase full of coins it was something
23:32
like 400 worth of coins it was great it
23:34
got me through the next year
23:35
yeah he's ridiculous uh he holds it if
23:37
he hoards it it means he was collecting
23:39
yeah which means you stole it
23:41
look he never noticed did he also
23:43
collect his television as well
23:44
[Laughter]
23:46
one american bloke he uh he walked
23:48
around the town he lived in
23:50
and he would go on long walks every day
23:51
and whenever he passed by a car wash
23:54
he would uh just feel in the chain slot
23:56
in the vacuum machine you know you pay a
23:57
few coins and you get to use a vacuum
23:59
machine to hoover the inside of your car
24:00
he made an average of 5.60 per trip and
24:03
over a decade he made 21 thousand
24:05
dollars
24:06
well just from that it's actually still
24:09
not enough to live on is it nope
24:12
it's a really nice bonus but i'm also
24:14
thinking he um
24:15
he could be using his skills for better
24:17
use because what he's doing is he's
24:19
putting his finger into a small hole
24:21
and feeling around it must be another
24:24
job that he can do
24:25
i can't think of anything
24:29
okay it's time for our final fact of the
24:31
show and that
24:32
is anna chazinski yeah my fact is that
24:35
restaurants in 1950s vietnam
24:37
punched holes in their soup spoons to
24:39
stop people stealing them
24:41
it's amazing great so weird so
24:44
i read this in this uh in an excerpt
24:47
from this
24:48
cookbook called the faux cookbook by
24:50
andrea nguyen
24:51
and yes she was saying under communism
24:53
in the 1950s a lot of people were
24:55
stealing cutlery from restaurants
24:56
and so restaurants decided that they
24:58
would punch holes in the middle
25:00
of soup spoons which she described as
25:02
making the soup a lot harder to drink it
25:03
had to be gulped down extremely quickly
25:05
because otherwise it dribbled all out of
25:07
the spoon before it got to your mouth
25:08
right but apparently it was to stop
25:10
people stealing that's weird that isn't
25:12
it because you would think
25:14
either the hole makes it completely
25:16
useless that you can't
25:18
drink out of it or it's still okay in
25:20
which case you can use it in the
25:22
restaurant but you can also still use it
25:23
at home
25:24
exactly by the end of your meal you've
25:25
mastered the use of a
25:27
holy spoon and you bring that home yeah
25:30
well they actually did it again i found
25:31
one other
25:32
newspaper article citing it being done
25:34
in 1993 in russia
25:36
in the city of cherboxary and it did
25:39
conclude that this anti-theft device did
25:41
not work
25:42
um so this was saying that uh the
25:44
anti-theft idea in this place was to put
25:46
holes in the spoons and then diners at
25:47
the cafe were instructed to ball up
25:49
pieces of bread that came with their
25:50
meal in order to plug up the hole in the
25:52
spoon
25:54
it's amazing how much stuff gets stolen
25:55
from restaurants i didn't realize this
25:57
jamie oliver said he lost
25:58
30 000 napkins oh i don't know whether
26:01
it was a month or a year now
26:02
oh yeah there's some vast numbers his
26:04
napkins have got like branded jamie
26:06
oliver on them or something don't they
26:07
he says jamie oliver on them i think
26:09
have we done that we mentioned the
26:11
virgin
26:11
thing before on he's got children
26:16
i think we can make this out he's a
26:18
virgin
26:21
virgin airlines had a similar problem
26:23
years ago they had these little plain
26:25
salt and pepper shakers
26:26
and people kept stealing them because
26:28
they just looked so cool um
26:30
and so they thought rather than
26:31
combating it by
26:33
stopping production of it or trying to
26:35
work out how to stop people from
26:36
stealing it they ended up
26:37
just having a little embossed thing at
26:39
the bottom saying
26:40
pinched from virgin airways and it
26:42
became a huge marketing tool everyone
26:44
loved the idea
26:45
so they were encouraging people to steal
26:46
them this is like oaxaca had an amnesty
26:49
on stolen spoons
26:50
recently actually because i think
26:51
hackerspoons are also quite distinct i
26:54
think they're big and round and plastic
26:55
plastic aren't they
26:56
yes and colorful so they had an amnesty
26:58
where they said if you return stolen
27:00
spoons then we'll give you free food
27:02
and there were posters up which said
27:04
sure they're irresistibly bright and
27:05
some say ergonomically perfect
27:08
true there's no finer ladle for your
27:09
last mouthful but please please can we
27:11
have them back
27:12
um the state parliament in russia the
27:14
duma they had a lot of problems with
27:16
people stealing cutlery
27:18
in 2004 at least they did um they were
27:22
losing
27:22
30 to 40 spoons and 15 forks a week
27:26
so they're losing that much per week uh
27:29
and um there was a guy
27:30
an mp called sergey glottov and he
27:34
thought that basically because they
27:35
didn't have a gift shop
27:36
whenever anyone came they just thought
27:39
oh i'm going to have to take something
27:40
so i'm going to take some cutlery
27:42
instead
27:43
right when i went to russia logica which
27:45
is spoon is one of the few words that i
27:47
learned and people kept
27:48
uh over the course of the week uh
27:50
nicking me spoons from around the place
27:52
because you just kept saying
27:53
yeah i kept saying that people found it
27:55
very amusing and they gave me i i
27:57
came back with about half a dozen spoons
27:59
wow loschke meaning spoons uh
28:02
is also a musical instrument i think
28:05
the spoons yeah yeah it's like the
28:06
spoons but they're like decorated and
28:07
they're being
28:08
cool i have some at home nice you should
28:10
have gone around russia saying the words
28:12
learn the words for slightly more
28:13
valuable exciting yeah saying diamond
28:15
diamonds
28:17
should have learned that um yeah so
28:19
disappearing spoon seems to be a major
28:21
thing to the extent that the british
28:22
medical journal in 2005 published a
28:26
report called the case of the
28:27
disappearing teaspoons longitudinal
28:29
cohort study of the displacement of
28:30
teaspoons in an australian research
28:32
institute
28:33
and it was a study where they
28:34
investigated the uh lifespan of a
28:36
teaspoon and how
28:38
soon it would be stolen and they worked
28:39
out that the half-life of teaspoons was
28:41
81 days
28:43
if you wanted to have an institute wide
28:45
population of 70 teaspoons in this
28:48
research institute
28:49
you would need to buy 250 teaspoons in
28:52
one year
28:53
and their conclusion was that the loss
28:56
of workplace teaspoons is rapid
28:58
showing that their availability and
28:59
hence office culture in general is
29:01
constantly threatened
29:02
we suggest that the development of
29:03
effective control measures against the
29:05
loss of teaspoon should be a priority on
29:06
national research agendas
29:09
it's fox in this office isn't it yeah it
29:11
is i need to get into another study
29:12
remember when you guys accused me of
29:14
throwing away all our cutlery i still
29:16
think you might have accidentally thrown
29:17
them away
29:18
i didn't do it right and i think they
29:20
were an archaeological fight
29:22
and i'm an australian so this is
29:24
matching up with this report that you
29:25
just read it is very odd though so we
29:27
you know like
29:28
little things like coasters the prime
29:30
example is byroes
29:31
like byron's just go douglas adams has
29:33
this whole riff about you know they
29:35
squirrel themselves away through space
29:36
time to their own dimension but it is
29:38
bizarre i frequently put three buyers in
29:40
my bag can i end the day and i've got
29:42
none
29:43
yeah where are they they're in my bag
29:46
and i was collecting them
29:49
i think it's basically anything that's
29:51
low value right so if it's low value you
29:53
don't really care about it so it just
29:55
goes missing
29:56
whereas if you had really nice pen then
29:58
you probably would never lose it
30:00
um i was looking into other kinds of
30:02
spoons that we've had throughout the
30:03
years
30:04
um my favorite spoon so far one i've not
30:06
heard of ear spoons
30:08
have you heard of ear spoons that's so
30:09
cool historical artifact
30:11
it's for getting wax out of your ears
30:13
yeah pre the q-tip
30:14
uh it was you'd have a spoon with a
30:17
little
30:18
with a long handle and you'd shove it
30:19
down your ear and you try and dislodge
30:21
the wax inside and
30:23
come out with a nice spoon for the water
30:24
i think i have one do you
30:26
think so oh you haven't been using it
30:29
sorry it went in a few years ago
30:34
in the e series of qi and we found out
30:36
about these things
30:37
and you can buy them readily online and
30:40
i
30:40
think i haven't seen it for years so
30:42
maybe i haven't got it still but i
30:43
thought i bought one with a light on it
30:45
so you can kind of go into the ears and
30:47
kind of lock it
31:01
no and also i remember reading that and
31:04
i don't know if this is kind of a bit of
31:05
a funny pages thing but apparently uh
31:07
ear wax picking
31:09
of your loved one was kind of a bit of a
31:11
fetish in japan for a while
31:14
yeah it does it feels like just a
31:16
made-up thing but i remember reading
31:17
articles about it so
31:19
um here's the thing about spoons yeah in
31:21
1909 the huddersfield examiner reported
31:24
that there had been a competitive spoon
31:26
cleaning competition
31:28
pretty cool that is such a good way to
31:29
get everyone to do the town's washing
31:31
[Laughter]
31:34
do you know what the first ever spoons
31:35
were don't they were made from
31:37
oh wood they were made of shells tied
31:40
onto sticks
31:43
says my research is okay okay the latin
31:47
word for spoon is cochlear
31:49
and that comes from the word that comes
31:51
from the word for shell
31:52
so i think that's the thinking yeah
31:55
you're not gonna find any
31:56
sticks and and shells tied together
32:00
all the way with the office forks but
32:02
you're not going to find that
32:04
in an archaeological way so i can see
32:06
the language thing but even then it
32:07
could be the shape of it just reminds
32:09
you of a shell
32:10
possibly possibly not sure might you
32:12
find it in a in a cave
32:14
we're just not tied together but like
32:16
just sitting next to each other
32:18
you don't know just i mean you're always
32:20
going to find sticks and shells next to
32:21
each other when i go to the beach and i
32:22
see a bit of driftwood in their shell
32:25
there's an ancient cutlery set you've
32:28
got to use your imagination
32:31
so do you know one of the oldest spoons
32:33
that exists in this country
32:35
is yes it's my sticky shell
32:46
and then hot on the heels of that um
32:48
this is the only piece of
32:50
medieval regalia we have so stuff from
32:52
uh things that were used in medieval
32:54
royal ceremonies and it's the coronation
32:55
spoon
32:56
so the most sacred part of the queen's
32:58
coronation is when she gets anointed
33:01
which is when the archbishop of
33:02
canterbury in private puts
33:04
uh holy oil on her i think it's her
33:07
breasts her hands and her head
33:09
and she uses this he uses his coronation
33:11
spoon and it's from the 12th century
33:14
which i just think that's incredible
33:15
it's almost a thousand-year-old spoon
33:17
the breasts it's seen
33:19
[Laughter]
33:22
in china restaurants are pining uh bring
33:24
your own cutlery movement
33:25
because huge amounts of cutlery get
33:27
wasted so it's weird that we pick up
33:28
plastic cutlery and a lot of the cafes
33:30
that you go to for instance in london
33:31
and um it was worked out that they were
33:34
wasting something like
33:36
it was something ridiculous like 80
33:37
billion pairs of chopsticks a year in
33:39
china
33:39
and so in beijing there's a bring your
33:41
own cutlery movement where a whole bunch
33:42
of restaurants now hundreds of
33:43
restaurants across the city don't
33:45
serve cutlery and if you forget to bring
33:46
your own cutlery then you're buggered i
33:48
guess
33:48
that's a really good idea it's a really
33:50
good idea yeah and they used to do it
33:52
medieval times everyone would have to
33:53
bring their own knife
33:54
yeah you just have a knife on your belt
33:55
and that was the knife that's exactly
33:57
what we wanted london people
33:58
walking around with knives
34:00
[Laughter]
34:03
okay that's it that's all of our facts
34:05
thank you so much for listening if you
34:07
would like to get in contact with any of
34:08

00:09
hello
00:10
and welcome to another episode of no
00:12
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:15
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:17
covent garden
00:17
my name is dan schreiber and i am
00:19
sitting here with anna chazinski
00:21
james harkin and andrew hunter murray
00:24
and once again we have gathered around
00:25
the microphones with our four favorite
00:27
facts from the last seven days and in no
00:29
particular
00:30
order here we go starting with you andy
00:33
my fact is that a group of scientists is
00:35
currently making their own
00:37
lava pretty cool
00:40
so uh there's a load of scientists who
00:42
are
00:43
there the university of buffalo's center
00:45
for geohazard studies
00:47
and they want to study what it's like
00:48
when lava and water meet because it's
00:51
something that you don't get to study a
00:52
lot
00:52
uh in the wild in the natural world
00:56
but it's really important as well
00:57
because when lava and water meet it gets
00:59
really really explosive as opposed to
01:01
only
01:01
you know normal lava explosivity and so
01:04
they are
01:04
making their own stuff and they melt uh
01:07
10 gallons of basaltic rock at a time
01:10
in a furnace at 2500 degrees is there
01:13
not a thing
01:14
uh about water and lava meeting which is
01:16
related to the laden frost effect one of
01:18
one of james's
01:19
favorite effects i think it's which is
01:21
when two substances of vastly different
01:23
temperatures meet each other
01:25
and it means that the water isn't caused
01:26
to boil straight away because this layer
01:28
of
01:29
gas suddenly forms between the water and
01:31
the lava and i think that might be what
01:33
makes it so explosive because this layer
01:34
of gas forms
01:35
and then eventually that layer of gas
01:37
collapses and then this massive
01:38
explosion happens
01:40
do you know where they could have gone
01:41
to see lava meet water
01:43
no 1973.
01:46
they went to 1973 there's an icelandic
01:49
town called
01:50
vesmania i'm pronouncing that wrong
01:52
obviously but in 1973 they had a volcano
01:55
erupt and the lava was heading towards
01:57
this town which was quite far away
01:58
um and what they decided to do was they
02:00
got water cannons and they pumped
02:02
billions of gallons of water at the lava
02:05
that was approaching to stop it and they
02:06
did it for months on end
02:08
and it eventually did stop and so the
02:10
town was saved
02:11
some people would say it is harder for
02:13
scientists to build a time machine and
02:14
go back to 1973 possibly even than
02:16
making their own lava
02:18
it would have been a better fact though
02:19
wasn't there a town was it in spain or
02:22
italy where
02:23
they there was a volcano going off and
02:25
the villagers kind of made a trench so
02:27
that the
02:28
lava wouldn't go into their town yes but
02:30
instead they directed it into the next
02:32
town
02:32
oh yeah yes it was in sicily it was when
02:36
the village was called catania and they
02:38
dug an artificial
02:40
breech so to redirect the lava and the
02:42
really cool thing is they you know how
02:43
they kept cool
02:45
they wore wet sheepskins while they were
02:47
working
02:48
but they the villagers who they
02:50
redirected the lava flow to then
02:52
redirected it back to this uh other
02:54
place called paterno and the paternians
02:56
just sent it right back their way
02:58
so funny do you know how to tell if a
03:01
volcano explodes whether
03:02
you're really really really in trouble
03:04
no you look up at the spout of lava
03:06
that's coming out of the volcano and if
03:08
it's moving left or right
03:09
you're absolutely fine from your
03:11
perspective if it appears to be
03:12
staying still you're in trouble because
03:15
presumably that's coming towards you
03:16
because it's exactly on the same axis as
03:18
you
03:18
so you'll be going directly away from
03:20
well it's not james it's going towards
03:22
you
03:22
for being annoying i find it amazing
03:25
that um volcanoes are made of
03:27
lava i never really thought of that i
03:29
thought oh they're just made of rock
03:30
that's sticking up and then the lava
03:31
comes out of it but they're made of
03:32
either lava or love and ash is building
03:35
up
03:36
over millions of years i thought what
03:37
was amazing is um do you remember
03:40
the tunnel going through the alps uh the
03:42
got hard tunnel
03:43
yeah remember that and how when they
03:45
went through it some of the time the
03:47
rock was really hard
03:48
and then some of it was crumbly like
03:50
sand you always think of a mountain as
03:52
being like solid all the way through but
03:54
it's amazing that there are gaps in
03:55
there and little crumbly bits
03:57
yeah it's like a trifle i think yeah you
03:59
said they're a bit
04:00
you said because we did it on no such
04:01
thing as the news there are bits which
04:03
were as soft as butter
04:04
yeah i can't believe that actually you
04:07
can't believe it's butter
04:08
[Laughter]
04:10
you'd be so annoyed if you were building
04:12
on that mountain or you're trying to get
04:14
through that mountain and your mate got
04:16
the butter bit and you got the granite
04:17
bit next to it
04:18
so you've turned up with a massive
04:19
boring machine he's just got a butter
04:21
knife
04:24
actually speaking of tunnels there are
04:26
lava related tunnels on the moon
04:28
oh this is the best thing i've read this
04:30
week so amazing yeah and i can't believe
04:32
i didn't know
04:33
these existed so um we discovered this
04:35
quite recently i think that the moon has
04:37
these underground tunnels
04:39
and they were formed by lava flows 3.5
04:42
billion years ago
04:43
so lava would flow and then it
04:45
solidifies on top
04:46
faster than it solidifies underneath so
04:48
the top creates this roof
04:50
and then underneath the roof is hollowed
04:52
out as the lava flows through it
04:53
and so there are these hollow lava
04:55
tunnels and one of the ways we know this
04:56
is because they have things called
04:58
skylights
04:59
in these tunnels which is where a bit of
05:00
them fall in and then we see this hole
05:02
that suddenly created which shows us
05:04
this tunnel underneath
05:05
it's so cool the reason that scientists
05:07
are really interested in it is because
05:09
the idea of building these moon bases
05:11
that
05:11
always get proposed one day will have a
05:13
moon base they actually think so part of
05:15
the problem with moon bases is all the
05:16
radiation coming in
05:17
and they think that these tubes could
05:19
lead to these sort of underground
05:21
bunkers
05:22
where we could put the bases so they're
05:24
now looking into these tubes and they've
05:26
got probes that have been flying over
05:27
they've been sussing them out and trying
05:29
to learn more it's so exciting
05:33
you know how um we've been discussing in
05:36
the office recently uh the football and
05:37
iceland has a lot of volcanoes
05:39
well the icelandic football team until
05:41
the 1950s
05:43
played and practiced on lava they played
05:46
on gravel which was made of crushed lava
05:47
wow that's great no wonder they're good
05:49
these days
05:50
more impressive to do it on liquid lava
05:53
as it flows out of the volcano
05:54
that would be pretty cool because also
05:56
if you put your foot on lava it's so hot
05:58
that it sets fire to your foot
05:59
so that would be quite cool you'd look
06:00
like one of those cartoon characters
06:01
that has your shoes on fire yeah no that
06:03
would have been a very impressive um
06:04
yes yeah i mean it's not a practical i
06:07
think
06:07
yeah in cartoons you do see people
06:09
falling into lava but that would never
06:11
happen because lava is quite thick and
06:13
gloopy and
06:14
more viscous humans would you just fall
06:16
onto it just fall onto it and set on
06:18
fire
06:18
right rather than kind of going no and
06:21
kind of the last thing you see is your
06:22
arm going into the lava yeah
06:24
what about the end of terminator 2
06:26
spoiler alert uh
06:28
where arnie of course goes into the
06:29
liquid steel well is he not a
06:32
robot he's made of metal yeah so it's
06:34
slightly different it's a big difference
06:35
yeah he'll have a different density to
06:37
humans
06:39
all right they have researched it andy
06:41
they're not just making stuff happen
06:44
does he ever swim in terminator no he
06:46
doesn't that's why
06:52
um i was reading mark commode in simon
06:54
mayo's book and
06:55
they were talking about movie endings
06:56
that don't quite make scientific sense
06:58
and one of them they say is that lord of
07:01
the rings right at the end
07:02
for frodo to go in the volcano that
07:03
wouldn't be possible because you would
07:05
just explode
07:06
from the heat sure is that true how
07:09
dense are hobbits
07:10
i mean these are all made up things
07:12
aren't they i know volcanoes aren't made
07:14
up
07:14
but they're in a fantasy world so they
07:16
could have talking could have specified
07:18
that in middle earth
07:19
volcanoes are a bit colder oh yeah
07:22
that's now you
07:22
do have cold volcanoes have you heard
07:24
about this no you're talking about
07:25
fountains
07:26
[Laughter]
07:28
there is a volcano called goliath
07:30
volcano which is
07:31
um near lake natron which is in tanzania
07:34
and their lava is made out of natural
07:37
carbonate
07:39
and it has a different melting point to
07:41
normal rock
07:42
which means it's a lot colder than
07:44
normal volcanoes
07:46
i mean it is 510 degrees celsius so it's
07:49
not that cold
07:50
but it is that's like half the
07:52
temperature of a normal volcano
07:53
bring a jumper you're saying i'm still
07:55
visiting if you're gonna wear
07:57
wet sheepskins then you'll be better off
08:00
at that one than a normal volcano
08:02
it's a great tip okay although you do
08:04
get iced lava
08:05
really what how cool is this uh not on
08:08
earth on other planets
08:09
but um they're in the solar system there
08:11
are ice volcanoes
08:13
also known as cryo volcanoes and they
08:15
throw up not
08:16
molten rock they throw up water or
08:18
ammonia or methane in liquid form
08:21
and then it's so cold on those planets
08:23
that it freezes almost instantly and
08:25
crashes to the ground and so that
08:27
happens on pluto it happens on some
08:28
other moons
08:29
that's very cool yeah has anyone seen a
08:31
mud volcano
08:33
nope no i saw some of them in romania
08:35
last week
08:36
you kind of drive up to the top of like
08:38
a mountain it's kind of a flat plateau
08:40
and then um you just have this bubbling
08:43
um mud these little pits of bubbling mud
08:46
and then they kind of spurt out a little
08:47
bit and then roll down the hill
08:49
and it's just yeah it's a really awesome
08:51
it sounds like you'd expect
08:53
some kind of slime monster to emerge
08:55
from it yeah
08:56
dangerous is it dangerous um when you go
08:59
there they tell you not to touch it
09:01
but because it's in romania and they
09:03
don't really seem to bother about health
09:05
and safety too much
09:06
it's not like in britain there would
09:08
probably be fences and you won't be able
09:09
to go within a mile of them but actually
09:11
you can go right up to them
09:12
and that's why you're missing a hand
09:14
this week
09:16
that was actually eaten by this
09:20
okay here's the thing the largest
09:21
volcano in the world
09:23
um any guesses as to which or where it
09:26
is
09:27
yeah is it underwater it's underwater
09:30
it's called the tamu massif
09:32
it's a thousand miles east of japan
09:34
underwater it is equivalent
09:36
in area to the british isles it is a
09:39
hundred and twenty thousand
09:40
square miles in area as a volcano it's
09:43
it's it's not active
09:44
uh thankfully but it's so gradual the
09:47
slope on it that if you were on the
09:48
seabed you would not be able to tell
09:50
which way was
09:51
towards the top like it's really really
09:53
really really really gradual towards the
09:54
top
09:55
but it is it does it is it does slope
09:57
and it is the size of britain
09:59
um you know scientists have made lava
10:00
before no a couple of years ago
10:03
they made lava by heating up rock this
10:06
is scientists at syracuse university and
10:08
it took them 70 hours to heat rock and
10:10
turn it into lava and once they'd done
10:11
it
10:12
they made the world's hottest barbecue
10:14
it's hard enough isn't it to make sure
10:16
that the outside of your chicken
10:18
wing is not burnt when the inside's cut
10:21
it's going to be charcoal on the outside
10:23
and completely raw on that yeah
10:24
apparently it was there was a chef
10:26
called sam bompos who was present and he
10:27
said it was the best steak he'd ever had
10:29
yeah right oh he's always going
10:33
okay so just quickly this is about um uh
10:36
making things artificially
10:37
do you know the hottest temperature that
10:39
humans have ever made is
10:41
but 7.2 trillion degrees
10:45
fahrenheit and what's that in centigrade
10:47
it's only four
10:48
trillion degrees celsius i don't know
10:50
what either of those numbers mean but
10:51
like is that hotter than
10:53
to give you an example that's 250 000
10:55
times hotter than the sun
10:57
gas marks 75 million
11:01
[Laughter]
11:04
[Music]
11:09
okay it is time for fact number two and
11:11
that is james
11:13
okay my fact this week is that the word
11:15
timbuktu
11:16
means woman with a sticky out belly
11:19
button
11:21
so this is a book that i'm reading the
11:23
moment called the badass librarians of
11:25
timbuktu
11:27
by joshua hammer and it's a brilliant
11:29
book and this is just the first fight
11:31
that i found in there when i started
11:32
reading it
11:33
and um nobody really actually knows why
11:36
it comes from this phrase there's some
11:38
thought that it might have been the
11:39
goddess that they
11:41
they look towards what i kind of thought
11:43
is maybe it's just a belly button thing
11:45
and it could be that it's in
11:46
some kind of depression i think timbuktu
11:48
is in like a depression so it could be
11:50
like it's the
11:51
belly button of that area well then that
11:53
would be a real innie wouldn't it
11:55
yeah so so unless you're looking at it
11:57
from the other side you're
11:58
from inside the earth you're right
12:03
no i think um there are some
12:05
disagreements about the translation it
12:06
could be large belly button rather than
12:08
sticky out belly button okay
12:10
it's one of these kind of nobody quite
12:11
knows but this is the most likely that
12:13
is condition isn't it there's a medical
12:14
condition which gives you
12:16
stickier belly buttons
12:19
yeah and it's known in the area um it
12:21
does happen there so
12:23
possibly that was a woman yeah i read
12:25
actually on a reddit thread and i
12:27
couldn't verify it
12:28
that someone said as per my source
12:31
brackets the 1996 guinness book of world
12:33
records so if anyone's got that check it
12:35
the longest outie ever recorded was 11.9
12:38
inches
12:38
oh come on if someone's really screwed
12:41
up the umbilical cord if you have like a
12:43
center but that's
12:44
not how it works
12:47
a lot of people think that a belly an
12:48
outy belly button is where they've got
12:50
the umbilical cord but it's not it
12:51
always gets cut
12:52
a couple of inches away from the uh
12:55
stomach but then
12:56
the muscles seal themselves off and that
12:58
bit of skin just dries up
13:00
and i don't know where it goes i mean
13:02
there have been 90 billion of those
13:03
things
13:04
since humanity evolved but you think
13:06
there's some kind of a pit somewhere
13:08
there must
13:08
be somewhere shed belly buttons
13:11
but it's like for instance everyone's
13:14
toenails are always growing
13:15
and people trim them yeah but it's not
13:17
like there's a massive cave of toenails
13:20
[Laughter]
13:26
so um timbuktu yeah do you know what
13:29
it's twinned with
13:30
this is rather nice it's twinned with
13:31
hay on y oh yeah
13:33
and when it was announced um someone
13:36
from hay
13:37
said timbuk2 is the oldest home of the
13:39
written word in africa it has a large
13:41
number of private and public libraries
13:43
housing ancient arabic and african
13:44
manuscripts hey on why is the
13:46
second-hand book capital of the world
13:49
it's basically the same actually
13:51
timbuktu had a few was twinned with a
13:52
few and actually obviously that's that
13:54
makes you not a twin as soon as you've
13:55
got more than once yes
13:57
you can't be tripleted it's amazing
14:00
looking into timbuktu because i
14:02
genuinely knew nothing about it i know
14:04
the only thing i knew about it was that
14:05
it was a lyric in an oliver song
14:07
go to timbuktu and back again that's the
14:10
only thing i knew about it
14:11
and it turns out that it was this
14:13
incredible cultural hot spot for
14:15
knowledge that's why it's so good that
14:18
it's twinned with the um second-hand
14:19
bookstore of the world
14:21
because actually it's right they do have
14:23
loads of manuscripts and this book is
14:25
about um a guy who
14:26
tried to take a load of manuscripts away
14:28
from timbuktu to the
14:30
malian capital bamako because they were
14:32
under threat by islamists
14:34
yeah and it's such it's an amazing story
14:36
isn't it it's a great story
14:37
and they genuinely did it so islamists
14:39
were coming into timbuktu
14:41
and they thought we bet they're going to
14:42
try and describe destroy our libraries
14:44
because they had
14:44
hundreds of thousands of really valuable
14:46
manuscripts and lo and behold
14:48
a little a short while later a few
14:49
months later then the libraries were
14:51
sort of raised to the ground
14:52
and they'd managed to save and smuggle
14:54
out of the country more than 300
14:55
000 manuscripts only a few hundred were
14:57
left so everyone thought when these
14:59
libraries collapsed oh no that's all
15:01
gone
15:01
and then these guys came out of the
15:02
woodwork saying don't worry about it we
15:04
got we got rid of them
15:06
and where are they now i'm not telling
15:08
you
15:10
because this goes out on the internet so
15:12
why
15:13
why did tim buck two have a big collapse
15:16
to the point where
15:17
i read a 2006 survey of 150 britain's
15:20
uh 34 did not believe it existed so i've
15:23
actually got the
15:24
survey here this was reported uh by the
15:27
sun
15:27
under the headline tim buck who um
15:32
but anyway the survey um i think this is
15:34
the server we're talking about dan it
15:35
was in 2010 and it was of 18 to 30 year
15:37
olds
15:38
okay okay uh and of them maybe it was
15:41
the same maybe it was different half
15:42
thought that timbuktu was made up
15:44
um 10 thought that kazakhstan wasn't
15:46
real
15:47
a third said that atlantis was somewhere
15:49
in greece
15:50
and one person thought that france was
15:53
in spain
15:56
but actually for a long time timbuktu
15:59
people weren't sure whether it existed
16:00
it was kind of a half legendary place in
16:02
north africa and because europeans
16:04
didn't really go to north africa
16:06
a lot of people went to try and find
16:08
this so-called city where
16:10
great uh education happened and so and
16:12
gold reserves right it was quite famous
16:14
for its gold a few hundred years ago
16:15
exactly
16:16
uh the first westerner um in modernish
16:18
times to try and find it was a guy
16:20
called john ledyard and when he went
16:22
he'd never been to africa
16:24
he didn't know a single word of arabic
16:27
and when he got to cairo
16:28
he had a bilious complaint and decided
16:31
to treat it with sulfuric acid
16:33
and took so much that he immediately
16:35
died whoa
16:38
yeah hang on so he was just trying to
16:39
find it he didn't make it he was yeah
16:41
well
16:41
he got as far as cairo and then he saw
16:44
some
16:45
what he felt was gaviscon if only he'd
16:48
known a single word of arabic
16:50
namely sulfuric acid it's not the first
16:53
word you learn though is it
16:55
quite deep into the textbook right at
16:57
the back of the phrasebook isn't it it's
16:58
in the medical section you just do hello
17:00
and where is the toilet and stuff like
17:02
that
17:03
he probably could have done with where
17:04
is the toilet
17:07
do you know about the first westerner to
17:08
get to timbuktu no he was called gordon
17:10
lang
17:10
okay he got there in 1826 and he was a
17:13
scot
17:13
and he was an adventurer basically about
17:15
30 years old
17:16
and he had there was a huge competition
17:18
between britain and france to get to
17:20
timbuktu
17:21
and they obviously had a head start
17:22
because like they're closer but yeah
17:24
because around spain
17:24
yeah um
17:28
he said to his parents i shall do more
17:30
than has ever been done before and
17:31
she'll show myself to be what i have
17:32
ever considered myself a man of
17:34
enterprise and genius
17:35
right so big claim um this is from a
17:37
website called
17:39
greatbritishnutters.blogspot
17:42
so he got to tripoli immediately
17:43
proposed to the british council's
17:45
daughter and she fell in love with him
17:46
and they got married and then he said
17:47
right i'm off to timbuktu
17:49
he thought it would take him a few weeks
17:50
um the temperatures were huge
17:53
right 120 degrees fahrenheit the food
17:55
was patties of dried fish and camel's
17:57
milk
17:58
bandits everywhere one night he was
18:00
attacked in his tent by bandits
18:01
was as he was sleeping hacked out with
18:03
swords he got
18:05
24 wounds 18 of them serious
18:08
the next morning he still said put me on
18:09
my camel so he was trapped onto a camel
18:12
for 400 miles
18:13
seriously injured kept going right it
18:16
took him over a year
18:17
to get to timbuktu he finally got there
18:21
after you know recuperating all of this
18:23
stuff and it was
18:24
abandoned and poor it wasn't this great
18:26
centre of learning anymore and then two
18:28
days after he left he was he was
18:29
murdered in the desert by bandits
18:31
incredible sort of awful journey yeah
18:34
and do we know if he thought it was
18:35
worth it
18:36
or we don't know because he went it
18:38
wasn't what he was looking for which is
18:40
like
18:40
james says this amazing center of
18:42
learning at university and gold and
18:43
books
18:44
you know it wasn't like that anymore
18:45
there's got to be a moment on that track
18:47
when you've been strapped to a camel
18:48
and you've got hack woods from
18:51
giant swords that you're thinking did i
18:54
make the right call here
18:56
just at least for a minute he must have
18:58
had just a second yeah
19:00
do you know when we started thinking of
19:02
timbuktu as that
19:03
semi-fixed fictitious far away place um
19:07
this
19:07
so you know how we say today oh we'll
19:09
send him to timbuktu because
19:10
you know it's just i'm constantly saying
19:12
that
19:13
i'm constantly hearing it
19:15
[Laughter]
19:18
it's actually an oxford english
19:19
dictionary definition in its own right
19:20
the word
19:21
yeah yeah it's a place so it's been in
19:24
use
19:25
since lady duff gordon the english
19:27
writer in the 1860s was in cairo
19:30
and she was getting really fed up with
19:31
the fact that cairo was being sort of um
19:34
sort of gentrified so a lot lots of
19:36
other british people were coming there
19:38
precisely there was a cereal cafe that
19:41
was exactly her problem so she wrote a
19:43
letter back from cairo saying
19:44
it's growing dreadfully cockney here i
19:46
must go to timbuktu
19:48
instead and that was the first reference
19:50
of you know gotta escape to a more
19:52
distant place than this
19:53
yeah um so uh the idea that timbuktu
19:57
uh the name meaning the sticky-outy
19:59
belly button i i started looking into
20:01
what places uh how their names were
20:04
derived so
20:05
it's thought that maybe canberra means
20:08
women's breasts no one quite knows where
20:10
canberra comes from in australia yeah
20:12
they think it means meeting place
20:13
as well um because it derives from an
20:15
aboriginal word but actually but often
20:17
they would meet at
20:18
women's breasts it's very confusing if
20:21
there's more than one woman
20:22
in the bar while you're meeting
20:26
manchester is named after breasts yeah
20:28
is it
20:29
yeah the man in manchester comes from
20:31
mom like mammaries and it's because of
20:34
the hills around manchester oh
20:36
so it should be called breast chester
20:39
yeah chess chester
20:40
[Laughter]
20:43
uh and then this is my favorite this is
20:44
named after someone there's a place
20:46
um called anus haven
20:49
i'm probably pronouncing that wrong i
20:51
don't think you are i think i am
20:53
i think you ain't a shaven or it could
20:55
be ano
20:57
but it's but the thing is is that this
20:58
place is in armenia and it's named after
21:00
a world war ii hero called dr
21:02
anus haven galilean anus even actually
21:05
sounds like another cupboard in your
21:06
house andy
21:14
okay it's time for fact number three and
21:16
that is chozinski
21:18
my fact this week is that lover's hearts
21:20
beat in sync
21:22
gross gross goes gross
21:23
[Music]
21:25
this disgusting fact comes to you
21:28
courtesy of research that was done by
21:29
the university of california davis in
21:31
2013
21:32
and it put couples in a room and it
21:34
monitored their heart rates and the
21:35
couples weren't touching each other or
21:37
speaking to each other so they were
21:38
married
21:42
speaks the married man um right so these
21:44
couples didn't touch
21:45
or speak to each other but it was found
21:47
when their heart rates were monitored
21:48
that their hearts were beating in sync
21:50
and
21:50
they're breathing really closely matched
21:52
and then they
21:53
in this experiment they mix the people
21:55
up a bit so they put males and females
21:57
with
21:58
people that they weren't in a couple
21:59
with so just like strangers in the room
22:01
with them and their hearts wouldn't be
22:02
in sync you know other things that
22:04
synchronize or other occasions on which
22:06
heartbeats synchronize this is quite
22:07
cool so
22:08
mothers and infants their heartbeat
22:09
synchronized when they're just looking
22:11
at each other
22:12
so mother a mother with her own baby
22:14
basically also acquires
22:16
their heart rates rise and fall at the
22:18
same time and they think that is a
22:19
breathing thing as well because
22:20
some bits you need loads of breath for
22:22
and when you breathe in your heart rate
22:23
goes up
22:24
and also dogs and their owners sink
22:27
heartbeats
22:28
yeah according to research by pedigree
22:30
each other
22:33
i love when you read where that research
22:35
has come from it always is yeah
22:37
although i don't know how that helps
22:38
with sales well what was interesting
22:39
about that study was it basically said
22:41
that when
22:41
dogs are reunited with their owners
22:43
after separation then both
22:44
those beings hearts start beating faster
22:47
which isn't necessarily them sinking
22:49
it's
22:49
presumably more likely than being quite
22:51
excited that they're seeing each other
22:52
again
22:54
here's a cool thing about heart rates um
22:56
obviously different animals
22:57
hugely faster and slower depending and i
22:59
think we may have even said before that
23:01
so
23:01
sperm whales have about nine beats per
23:03
minute shrews 835 beats a minute
23:06
if you put a whale in a room with a
23:08
shrew what happens then
23:10
they synchronize their lovers
23:13
the whale speeds up to 400 beats a
23:15
minute and immediately dies
23:18
no okay this is a really cool thing so
23:20
the whale and the shrews hearts
23:22
both deliver over the lifetime 200
23:25
million liters of blood
23:27
per kilo of body weight right so it's
23:30
exactly the same
23:31
rate for both animals so in in both
23:33
animals each gram of tissue
23:35
over the animal's lifetime receives 38
23:38
liters of oxygen
23:39
how weird is that this is a stupid
23:41
question but is that true proportionally
23:42
for
23:43
for most animals i think it'll be true i
23:45
think well yeah i don't think it's not
23:46
just those two basically this is a
23:48
sort of a rule of life yeah it's true of
23:50
all mammals i think
23:51
pretty much but humans don't work in the
23:54
same way so
23:55
it was thought for a while that all
23:56
mammals had the same number of
23:58
heartbeats in their lifetime because
23:59
the shorter lived animals beat much
24:01
quicker and the longer lived ones
24:03
be much slower and it does kind of work
24:06
a little bit but it doesn't work with
24:08
humans and i think the reason being that
24:10
we have
24:10
really good medication and stuff so we
24:12
live longer than we probably should do
24:14
there's about a billion heartbeats most
24:16
mammals with some exceptions like humans
24:18
get a billion
24:19
so it might still be worth getting into
24:21
a relationship with someone who has a
24:22
very slow heart
24:23
with a sperm whale in an attempt to
24:25
extend your life yeah
24:26
but if you go let's say in the future we
24:28
managed to do heart transplants
24:30
is it a case of confusing a single heart
24:32
that how many times it's personally beat
24:34
or is it responding to the body as in if
24:36
you take a heart that has had no beats
24:37
and put it in the body of someone who's
24:39
coming up to a billionth beat
24:41
will reset the clock the heart will keep
24:42
going yeah i mean if your heart's
24:44
beating a billion times then it'll be
24:46
much more tired it's not that you can
24:47
get to 90 years old and then put a
24:49
child's heart in your body and you're
24:50
going to live for another 90 years
24:52
someone's got to tell rupert murdoch
24:53
[Laughter]
24:55
but let's say that it it's a heart
24:57
collapse that you had that leads to your
24:58
death
24:59
would it eliminate the chances of that
25:01
well it's certainly true that if your
25:02
heart is in trouble you can have a heart
25:04
transplant
25:05
yeah that will help but did you know
25:06
this you can transplant your heart into
25:09
someone else and still live
25:10
no what okay so this is a medical
25:13
procedure it doesn't happen very often
25:15
but say for instance i needed a heart
25:17
and lung transplant from
25:18
another person from nsa yeah but i
25:21
didn't sign
25:22
anything by the way and then dan needed
25:25
a heart transplant
25:26
what they can do is because the heart
25:29
and lung coming from anna
25:31
would be better working together they
25:32
can give me the heart and lung from anna
25:35
and then i can give my heart to dan so
25:36
i've actually transplanted my heart and
25:38
received from another person
25:41
do i then give my heart and lungs to
25:43
anna yes where am i getting
25:44
my heart i'm gonna say what you don't
25:46
make it in this case i'm sorry
25:48
you're the person who is um who's a
25:50
donor
25:51
why doesn't uh anna just give me the
25:54
heart what was why were you the
25:55
in-between i really need
25:56
let's say i really need a lung
25:58
transplant yeah the lungs will work
25:59
better with a heart
26:00
of anaesthesia and as long as we'll work
26:02
better with anna's heart so i will get
26:04
the heart and the lungs
26:05
but my heart will then go to you because
26:07
you need a heart yeah got it and your
26:09
lungs are fine right so why on the
26:10
sacrificial level
26:11
why am i not involved in this do you
26:13
know that laughing
26:14
can increase your heart health so start
26:18
cracking those jokes
26:19
yeah it vaso dilates your blood vessels
26:21
so it increases the width of your blood
26:23
vessels and it means that you can pump
26:24
more blood around your body and
26:25
increases them by 22
26:27
which is actually really significant how
26:29
much do you have to laugh for that
26:30
yeah i just more than you can instigate
26:35
so they've also found that happiness can
26:38
actually
26:39
damage the heart as well it's all to do
26:42
with so there's that that
26:43
thing that it's called the tacot
26:46
cardiomyopathy
26:47
broken heart syndrome it's the idea of
26:49
broken heart and then you just
26:51
kind of convince your heart and in very
26:53
rare cases you convince it to the point
26:54
of you dying
26:55
and they've recently found that
26:57
happiness can trigger the same thing
26:59
so it's it's an it's a rare condition
27:01
but happiness has the same effect it
27:03
suddenly puts the heart into a kind of
27:04
oddly stressed position
27:06
and that can lead to death as well wow
27:07
so happiness can be dangerous is this
27:09
why
27:10
when you're in love sometimes your heart
27:12
feels uncomfortable
27:13
that's just surely that's just there
27:14
just nerves and adrenaline it's just
27:16
interesting the
27:17
the sort of physical sensations of
27:19
emotion like why should it be in the
27:21
chest why on earth should i feel
27:22
anything in particular there because
27:24
that's about fight or flight isn't it
27:26
and being excited
27:28
amazing nobody's got blood in there
27:31
isn't it
27:34
[Laughter]
27:40
you are my anus-haven
27:48
[Music]
27:50
okay it is time for our final fact of
27:52
the show and that is my fact
27:54
my fact this week is that this year hugh
27:57
hefner sold
27:58
the playboy mansion it comes with 30
28:00
rooms a pool
28:01
a tennis court a zoo license and hugh
28:04
hefner
28:05
so it comes with hugh hefner you get to
28:07
keep hugh hefner
28:09
[Laughter]
28:15
the idea being that he is now allowed to
28:17
just live in this house
28:18
until he dies that's that's the part of
28:21
the deal that he did
28:21
he ended up selling it to his neighbor
28:24
um and i think they've known each other
28:25
for a long time
28:26
so that seems to be an okay thing but
28:29
yeah so it's it's been sold and it and
28:31
obviously uh back in the 60s and 70s was
28:34
known as
28:35
the kind of disneyland of uh sexuality
28:38
basically it was a land of misogyny yeah
28:41
exactly the disneyland misogyny and uh
28:43
but now it's sort
28:44
of very dirty very uh run down
28:47
and yeah you mean dirty not just
28:49
sexually it's literally just
28:51
literally it is filled it does contain a
28:53
pipe organ
28:54
it doesn't that's not a euphemism sorry
28:57
imagine hugh hefner asking if you want
28:59
to see his pipe organ
29:00
[Laughter]
29:02
yeah so he's in his 80s at the moment um
29:04
do you guys know where he is going to be
29:06
buried when he does pass away is he one
29:09
of these people who wants to be buried
29:10
like on top of marilyn monroe
29:12
he's being buried right next to marilyn
29:13
monroe he he bought
29:15
the plot right next to her yeah that's
29:17
weird she was the first ever
29:19
um cover girl for playboy yeah and um
29:22
and he's been obsessed with her his
29:24
whole life and oh well it's not weird
29:27
sorry just qualifying the weirdness can
29:29
you put it in context by saying he's
29:30
obsessed with her
29:31
it sounds like he had a healthy
29:32
professional disinterested when you said
29:34
that he bought the cemetery plot next to
29:35
hers
29:38
i thought you were going to say uh that
29:40
he was going to be buried in because
29:41
one of the places that the playboy
29:42
mansion has is a pet cemetery
29:44
did you know that how's that which
29:45
presumably is where all the bunnies are
29:48
buried
29:49
very good thank you if i ever have a
29:51
heart attack
29:52
send murray but yeah one of his
29:54
girlfriends had a whole bunch of small
29:56
dogs didn't she and then the women who
29:58
lived in the mansion said that they
30:00
would be summoned to his bedroom
30:02
every friday and that's when he would
30:03
give them their allowance which i think
30:05
was a thousand dollars
30:06
and when they went to his bedroom they
30:07
had to wait for the first ritual which
30:10
was him scraping all the dog poo
30:11
off his bedroom floor oh my god i'll
30:13
stop it it's too
30:15
sexy in 2011 this was a story that
30:19
happened 100 people
30:20
fell out after going to a party at the
30:22
plate i mentioned and they think it was
30:24
because they were bacteria in the
30:25
whirlpool spa
30:26
because they forgot to scrape the dog
30:30
i thought this was interesting 40
30:31
percent of all of playboy's income
30:33
comes from china china you don't mean
30:35
they sell terracotta
30:37
um like what they sell tea sets
30:40
yes exactly so yeah in uh
30:44
in china the the country and um the
30:46
interesting thing is that the magazine
30:48
is not sold in china
30:50
so they license the bunny logo
30:52
completely for
30:53
things like perfumes things like uh
30:56
tracksuit clothing i always used to see
30:57
that in hong kong you would
30:59
see kids wearing playboy outfits but
31:01
because in china it doesn't have
31:03
the sexual connotation in fact they
31:05
completely rebrand it out there to be a
31:07
more
31:07
family orientated thing what is it
31:09
basically it's just it's just a big
31:11
brand
31:12
and there was a lady called chloe
31:14
woodall who bought some playboy for her
31:17
vip body spray um from i think it was
31:20
asda online
31:21
but it got substituted for it's a dog's
31:23
life petcare kind and gentle shine
31:26
spray and she said i do have a
31:30
staffordshire bull terrier but how did
31:31
they know that
31:33
[Laughter]
31:35
um you know this really old idea that
31:37
people used to say that they would read
31:38
playboy for the articles
31:40
there is one edition of the magazine
31:42
that can genuinely be claimed to have
31:44
been read
31:44
for just the writing just for the
31:46
articles and that is something that's
31:48
been published since the 1970s the
31:50
braille version
31:51
they take out any of the nudity so it's
31:53
not as if they've made like 3d pictures
31:55
or anything
31:55
it's purely words and it's purely the
31:57
articles i think it was i think it was
31:59
the first magazine
32:00
that came in braille was it really yeah
32:02
private i
32:03
used to have and i think still has an
32:05
addition for uh
32:06
partially cited all for blind people
32:08
private eye actually has
32:09
an interesting connection with playboy
32:11
uh peter cook went over to america to
32:13
ask hugh hefner for funding for private
32:15
eye
32:15
according to the official peter cook
32:17
biography peter cook for anyone
32:19
listening overseas one of britain's
32:20
biggest comedians
32:21
hefner tom pissoff according to this
32:23
biography
32:24
um but it also meant that uh one of the
32:26
best stories i love about peter cook
32:28
happened in this period he was at the
32:30
playboy club
32:31
and there was this guy trying to get in
32:33
and the bunny at the front didn't let
32:34
him in
32:35
so he started yelling into the whole
32:37
club going do you know who i
32:38
am do you know who i am peter cook went
32:40
up to him and he then yelled to the rest
32:42
of the club i'm sorry ladies and
32:43
gentlemen this gentleman doesn't seem to
32:45
know who he is does
32:46
anyone know who he is um so the
32:49
play-by-mansion that they sold
32:51
is not the first playboy mansion uh
32:53
there was one in chicago
32:55
the first one it had 70 rooms it had a
32:58
swim pool
32:59
it had um all sorts of stuff and now
33:01
they've turned it into three family
33:02
homes
33:03
so you can actually live there i think
33:04
students live there some of the time
33:07
and it had a brass plate on the door
33:09
with the latin inscription
33:11
uh under your latin's quite good do you
33:12
want to go like this
33:14
see non oscillate noli
33:17
tintanare if you don't oscillate
33:20
look no it must be something like shake
33:22
yes like oscillate right
33:24
is it if you don't have an orgasm you're
33:25
not excited or something like that
33:29
noli tintanare tintinare don't
33:32
impersonate tintin in this building
33:34
so tintinares ring as in ringing a
33:36
buzzer
33:37
all right uh and so see non oscillate
33:40
noli tintinare
33:41
if you're not shaking don't ring it's
33:43
close but it's a rhyming thing
33:45
oscar ass swinging swinging if you don't
33:52
a lot in put to good use finally yeah
33:55
i mean yeah it's horrible but it's great
33:57
is the magazine still going
33:58
yeah it is um they made a big change uh
34:01
last year which is they've stopped doing
34:03
nudity that's the latest move the i
34:06
think they're
34:06
just not working anymore is it sort of a
34:08
brand is it now
34:10
going more towards the brand thing i
34:12
think so yeah
34:13
yeah i i personally read it just for the
34:15

[Music]
00:09
hello
00:10
and welcome to another episode of no
00:12
such thing as a fish
00:13
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
00:15
qi offices in covent garden
00:17
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
00:19
here with anna chazinski james harkin
00:21
and andy murray
00:22
and once again we have gathered around
00:24
the microphones with our four favorite
00:25
facts from the last seven days
00:27
and in no particular order here we go
00:30
starting with you
00:31
chazinski my fact this week is that the
00:34
first
00:34
trampolines were made of walrus skin
00:37
and this is a thing that's called
00:39
blanket tossing
00:40
and it's been practiced for the my
00:43
teenage boys for thousands of years
00:47
okay so blanket tossing is something
00:49
that's been practiced by the inupiat
00:50
eskimos
00:51
up in alaska for we don't know exactly
00:53
how long but references to it go back to
00:56
on google books they go back to the very
00:59
early 19th century and that talks about
01:00
it as a tradition that's obviously
01:02
been practiced for a long time and it's
01:04
a game they played where
01:06
they'd get a walrus hide and they'd
01:08
attach it with ropes to four poles
01:10
and then they'd have lots of holes
01:12
drilled into the walrus hide all around
01:13
it so people could get their hands
01:14
through the holes
01:15
and pull on the holes so they pull on
01:17
the skin and then they dump somebody in
01:19
the middle of the skin
01:20
and it's about at waist height it's
01:21
suspended and then when everyone pulls
01:24
on the holes at the same time then
01:25
obviously the skin
01:26
flicks upwards and it throws the person
01:27
on them up in the air wow
01:29
yeah so we're going to say that counts
01:31
as a trampoline are we
01:32
i think i am for the sake of this fact
01:36
no i think because it's attached to
01:37
things at the side people are holding it
01:39
sounds more like a
01:40
uh you know when when there's a fire in
01:41
a building and someone needs to jump out
01:43
and there's people below with that fire
01:45
net a fire net those are really
01:47
interesting i didn't really know about
01:48
those
01:48
yeah so you see them in old films and
01:50
things like there's one in dumbo
01:52
isn't there you know in the circus show
01:54
there are all the clowns and it doubles
01:55
at the top of a burning
01:56
dumbo can fly well yeah but they don't
01:58
know that at the time they're planning
02:00
the circus show
02:01
no and also james spoiler very much
02:04
alert
02:06
but anyway we don't really know why
02:08
people did this it seems like a lot of
02:10
people speculate but it could have been
02:11
for instance in order to when they were
02:13
hunting
02:14
uh get one member of their tribe raised
02:16
up high
02:17
so that they could see for a long way
02:19
where the nearest
02:20
new walrus response to kill to make
02:22
their new trampoline or whatever
02:24
um that's an amazing idea and then
02:26
gradually they noticed that the people
02:27
were
02:28
staying on it for ages oh just one more
02:31
go guys
02:32
i thought i saw something i've read
02:35
something about
02:36
you've been framed something like 40 of
02:39
home video accidents
02:40
videos that are sent in are of
02:42
trampolining accidents ah
02:44
yeah that doesn't sound true it sounds
02:45
so untrue i don't know because it's an
02:47
occasion that you'd film
02:48
someone being on a trampoline i do see
02:50
that but from my memory of watching
02:52
you've been framed it's usually cats and
02:54
dogs doing stupid things or they weed
02:56
out the you know they they mostly take
02:58
from the other 60 percent
02:59
yeah right you can't just show incessant
03:01
trampolines people will get bored it's
03:02
true but how many people
03:04
own trampolines i thought everyone did
03:06
am i wrong
03:07
do you want to hear a headline from
03:09
scotland in 2010 yes please payside
03:12
a man caught jumping up and down naked
03:14
on a trampoline has avoided a jail
03:16
sentence
03:17
okay there was a man whose surname was
03:20
burden
03:20
and um he had his manhood in one hand
03:23
and a cigarette in the other
03:25
when he was spotted by the neighbor and
03:27
um a neighbor called the police and he
03:29
was arrested and charged with shameless
03:31
indecency
03:32
and the prosecutor said he told police
03:35
he had gone out to the trampoline and
03:36
had masturbated himself there
03:38
so blanket tossing survived in some ways
03:41
i'm asked why he did it burden told
03:42
officers
03:43
just for the thrill of it on the plus
03:45
side he did manage to win 250 quid when
03:47
he sent him the video to you've been
03:48
framed
03:52
um i was reading about the earliest
03:54
modern trampolines
03:55
and i was i went to the olympics website
03:58
because they've got a history of
03:59
trampolining on there so the earliest
04:01
that they have
04:02
is 1934 and it was for astronauts
04:05
and the idea was it was to get
04:07
astronauts used to the idea of what
04:09
space conditions might be it was the
04:11
best kind of possible
04:12
exercise for them to do yeah how many
04:14
astronauts were there in 1934
04:17
that's a very good plane there would
04:19
have been none
04:20
i thought nasa used them but not in the
04:22
30s yeah
04:23
right so maybe the modern trampoline was
04:25
developed in 1934 and then nasa started
04:27
using that's exactly down the line
04:29
it was by two guys called george nissen
04:31
and larry griswold
04:32
uh at the university of iowa and they
04:35
came up with this idea
04:36
and the guy george nissen um he was
04:39
traveling
04:39
in spain and he heard the word
04:41
trampoline which meant um the
04:44
springboard
04:45
and he thought that's a good name and he
04:46
took it so in spanish the word
04:48
trampoline means springboard
04:50
and in italian it means stilts
04:53
not sure why wow those countries
04:56
arriving to the olympics
04:57
[Laughter]
05:00
nissan always wanted it to be in the
05:01
olympics but it wasn't until 2008
05:04
and he was given the honor of testing
05:06
out the first ever olympic trampoline
05:08
before the event
05:09
and he was 94 years old wow he died a
05:13
couple of years later but yeah
05:14
he was really cool he at his 80th
05:16
birthday apparently
05:18
uh had a big dinner party and in the
05:20
middle of the dinner party he threw all
05:21
the silverware aside and got onto the
05:23
table and did a handstand
05:24
at ac what a fun guy
05:28
you do get kicked out of the restaurant
05:30
for doing that especially if you're
05:32
naked with a cigarette in one hand
05:36
do you know how nissan got the
05:37
trampoline popularized
05:39
no he jumped up and down on one with a
05:41
kangaroo
05:42
kangaroo does it go twice as high
05:46
actually it's interesting you say that
05:47
you should all look up at home a youtube
05:49
video of a kangaroo that accidentally
05:51
jumps onto someone's trampoline in
05:52
america and they filmed it and it tries
05:54
to jump off and obviously it doesn't
05:55
have the consistency that kangaroo
05:57
expects and it just
05:58
face plant into the ground in front wow
06:00
but nissan
06:01
hired a kangaroo in 1960 and jumped up
06:05
and down a trampoline
06:06
with it and apparently locked eyes with
06:07
it for ages and had lots of photographs
06:09
taken and this photograph went viral all
06:11
around the world
06:12
and people thought yeah that looks great
06:13
oh they all hired trampolines and
06:15
kangaroos
06:15
was that like a bundle deal trampoline
06:18
plus kangaroo yeah 50 grit extra
06:21
no they didn't they didn't actually hire
06:22
out kangaroos he also tried to invent
06:24
the load of games
06:26
did he so one of them was called space
06:28
ball and what it was is
06:29
you'd have um four people on a massive
06:31
trampoline two on each side and there'd
06:33
be a wall
06:34
in between and the wall would have a
06:36
hole in it and you try and throw the
06:38
ball
06:38
through the hole and hit a target on the
06:41
other side of the trampoline and the
06:42
other guys would try and block it yeah i
06:43
think it sounds fantastic it sounds like
06:45
a
06:45
trampoline version of quidditch yeah in
06:47
australia we used to play trampoline
06:49
volleyball
06:50
that's so cool is it yeah there's a lot
06:52
of trampoline games that get played out
06:54
in australia that i don't haven't seen
06:55
over here we don't have so many
06:57
trampolines
06:58
australia's just got so much space you
06:59
know you can fit them in is that why
07:01
you've got so many kangaroos you just
07:02
bought a load of trampolines
07:04
they all came with a free kangaroo what
07:07
do i do with this guy
07:09
yeah okay so some other things that you
07:11
can make using walruses
07:13
as well as trampolines so a walrus
07:15
stomach lining
07:16
was used for sales by inuit people
07:20
and their shoulder blades were used as
07:22
shovels and their penis bones
07:24
were used to make houses to brace the
07:26
walls also
07:28
to secure the flooring in their houses
07:30
and
07:31
also there were some inuits in st
07:33
lawrence island who use the penis bones
07:34
to make snow goggles
07:36
really yeah wow they use them as tent
07:38
poles as well yeah
07:40
and this this is cool you would live in
07:42
a walrus
07:43
home so you would stretch the hideout
07:46
and
07:47
over whale rib frames or penis bone
07:50
frames
07:50
and the windows would be made of
07:52
stretched walrus gut or
07:53
stretched penis membrane from the walrus
07:56
that was your window in your walrus
07:58
skinned house
07:59
what what does that mean what's a
08:00
membrane a very thin piece of
08:02
thinner skin i suppose yeah they also
08:04
apparently their whiskers were
08:06
could be used as nose pickers and you
08:08
would light your home using wall with
08:09
blubber in the lamps
08:11
and you would also turn the intestines
08:13
into your clothes
08:14
so you were completely living inside a
08:16
walrus and you would eat they wait
08:17
they made frozen um blocks of walrus
08:19
meat which they turned into
08:21
i find this impossible to believe but i
08:23
love it one-way sledges
08:25
which you would eat as you went
08:27
[Laughter]
08:30
so you know uh captain cook's biographer
08:32
says the closest he ever came to
08:33
suffering a mutiny was when he tried to
08:35
make his men eat walrus
08:37
and they all vomited and said it was
08:39
disgusting
08:40
captain scott when he was in the
08:41
antarctic i was reading about this the
08:43
other day
08:45
he tried to get they tried to eat seals
08:47
when they were going down the antarctic
08:49
but it was so disgusting they hated the
08:51
taste of it so they boiled it really
08:53
really
08:54
really for ages to try and get rid of
08:55
this kind of horrible fishy taste
08:58
and because they boiled it so much it
09:00
got rid of all of the vitamin c in there
09:02
and so they all caught scurvy oh wow
09:04
really yeah but they didn't know at the
09:05
time that's what was doing it but yeah
09:07
wow that's really interesting um but do
09:09
you know how they hunt them
09:10
how the um alaskan eskimos hunt walrus
09:13
and how they have done for hundreds of
09:14
years
09:14
they take a seal skin out so apparently
09:16
they're attracted to seal skin they want
09:18
to eat the seal skin
09:19
and they have it dragging behind the
09:21
boat and
09:22
wars comes and then they kill it with a
09:24
harpoon and then in order to carry it
09:25
back to
09:26
the shore they inflate it with a tube
09:28
and so the walrus just floats behind the
09:29
boat like a little inflatable spoiler
09:31
it's like a boy like a boy exactly do
09:34
you know that
09:34
uh their mouths have a vacuum force
09:38
suction right when they eat seals this
09:40
is how strong their suction is
09:42
they can suck the skin off the seals
09:46
yeah that's what i read is that the best
09:48
bit the skin no they're trying to get to
09:50
the meat so they want that out of the
09:51
way
09:51
so then they spit it out yeah yeah okay
09:54
this sounds so dubious
09:55
um i've got another amazing sounding
09:58
thing about waltzes which i almost can't
09:59
believe is that they
10:01
they have these very strong muscles and
10:02
they can basically push their eyes out a
10:04
bit
10:05
so they can either look forwards or
10:06
sideways i read that
10:08
when they're attacking seals one way in
10:10
which to kill them is that they drown
10:12
them
10:13
so they they've got extra incredibly
10:14
strong grips and they grip around them
10:16
with a hug
10:17
which often has confused a lot of humans
10:19
who if they're in a sea world
10:20
um that often confuses a lot of people
10:22
because it looks very friendly but
10:24
actually it's a really solid grip and
10:25
they take you down
10:26
i just imagine being in sea world and
10:28
you're like oh look that walrus is
10:30
kissing that seal and then it rips its
10:32
skin off
10:34
oh my god
10:46
okay it is time for fact number two and
10:48
that is
10:50
andrew hunter murray my fact is that one
10:52
suggested solution to the problem of
10:54
storing nuclear waste for thousands of
10:56
years
10:56
is putting up warning signs with edward
10:59
monks
11:00
the scream on them so this
11:03
is particularly at new mexico's waste
11:06
isolation pilot plants there are there
11:08
is
11:09
loads of nuclear storage facilities all
11:11
over the world whether you store
11:12
all the waste that you get from nuclear
11:16
power plants and the problem is that
11:19
so far i think the whole industry has
11:20
generated about 300 000
11:22
tons of the stuff and it has to be
11:25
protected from all life lifeforms for
11:27
about a hundred thousand years and i
11:30
mean
11:31
it's ten thousand years since we
11:32
invented farming
11:34
and some of it lasts for a million years
11:36
so the idea that we're going to be able
11:37
to
11:38
clearly say to future civilizations we
11:40
can hardly even understand shakespeare
11:42
and chaucer and stuff yeah i know the
11:43
pyramids are five thousand years ago
11:45
yeah and
11:45
we know what hieroglyphs mean but it's
11:47
taken a lot of work
11:49
but the idea is i guess and it does kind
11:50
of make sense right that um edward
11:52
munches the scream or however
11:54
pronouncing his name uh
11:55
it just does look like a human who's
11:57
terrified and you imagine
11:59
that unless we really physically evolve
12:01
out of looking at all like ourselves
12:03
it probably still will know i don't know
12:04
because that emoji which is a bit like
12:06
the screen where he's got his hands next
12:08
to his face
12:09
that almost means wow oh yeah does it so
12:12
what if i've been using that right now
12:13
just
12:14
50 years however you like what if 50
12:16
years from now that means
12:17
awesome cool thing yeah great roller
12:20
coaster ride yeah yeah so they haven't
12:21
they haven't actually done this but
12:23
this was one proposal and the other
12:24
proposals included things like making a
12:25
whole landscape nearby
12:27
full of jagged concrete spikes to make
12:29
it this horrible foreboding place
12:32
i saw that suggestion but then someone
12:34
said there's a very big problem that
12:35
usually when you make big
12:37
ugly things they just get destroyed by
12:38
the next generation right
12:40
so yeah but we the the problem is it's
12:43
all we have no idea what
12:45
future societies are going to be like
12:46
they might find ever mugs painting the
12:48
screen unbelievably sexy and enticing
12:50
because
12:50
that might be what an attractive person
12:51
looks like in 2000 years so it's a huge
12:54
philosophical problem and
12:55
actually the french nuclear agency is
12:56
called andre and it has a special memory
12:58
division
13:00
and their job is to deal with these
13:01
problems there was one
13:03
one guy who said my job is essentially
13:05
to communicate with people in the future
13:06
which is the coolest job
13:08
um and i liked i think it was him who
13:10
was pointing out one of the ways that
13:12
things could be misinterpreted in the
13:13
future is if we drew a little
13:15
comic above dangerous sites which showed
13:16
a little diagram of a man walking into a
13:18
barrel of
13:19
radioactive waste and then the next one
13:21
was his head exploding or something and
13:22
the next one was his coffin
13:24
actually in the future they might read
13:25
backwards so they might think that it's
13:27
something that brings you back to life
13:28
again
13:29
they might think that if your head's
13:30
exploded this is the thing that gets the
13:32
pieces of brain from all the different
13:34
parts and puts them all back together
13:37
and you definitely want to dig that up
13:39
that's like my uh my
13:40
my parents when they moved to hong kong
13:42
they lived on redneck cellar
13:44
road and um no one could work out what
13:46
redneck seller was they
13:48
just had no idea it turns out that it
13:49
was actually alexander road
13:51
but the person who was chinese who was
13:53
making the sign obviously wrote from
13:55
right no yeah so redneck cell is very
13:58
famous as a
13:59
early example of that happening exactly
14:01
that means that's really cool
14:03
you guys must have all found that other
14:05
thing about making um
14:06
gm cats so what you do is you
14:09
genetically modify cats so that whenever
14:11
they see
14:12
any radiation they change color then you
14:15
also make a nursery rhyme saying
14:17
little cat little cat if you change
14:18
color we're all gonna die and so people
14:20
remember the nursery rhyme and see a
14:22
cat's changing color and think oh
14:23
that means we're all gonna die and so
14:25
they stay away from the
14:26
radiation it was a thought experiment i
14:29
think wasn't it by philosophers in the
14:30
80s
14:31
francois bastid and paolo fabri yeah
14:35
i think the idea was that um cult we've
14:37
always in human culture been really
14:38
interested in cats
14:40
um and they've always been important to
14:42
us as symbols so
14:43
if we go way way into the future we can
14:45
be reasonably sure they think that
14:47
humans will still be watching cats and
14:49
still be taking note of them and when
14:50
they start glowing
14:51
they'll still think there's no good way
14:52
of doing it i don't think we are going
14:54
to crack this
14:54
i really like the idea of just making it
14:56
really boring so people don't want to go
14:58
there
14:59
like just making a completely wasteland
15:01
nothing there put it 400 meters down and
15:03
hope that no one's going to go 400
15:05
meters down it's just such a long time
15:07
that's the problem is you've no idea
15:09
i'll fire it into the sun
15:11
it was discussed a lot wasn't it firing
15:12
stuff into space and i think the fear
15:13
was that if there were an accident in
15:15
the atmosphere and we had
15:16
hundreds of thousands of tons of
15:17
radioactive waste on a craft that then
15:19
exploded
15:20
it would just rain down upon us you'd
15:22
feel so so stupid you feel like an idiot
15:25
not for long but i quite like the idea
15:28
of the comic book
15:29
but then also having some kind of you
15:32
know cracking of an egg so you can see
15:34
the direction that time goes
15:36
you know what i mean so there are some
15:37
things which are definitely one
15:39
directional in time
15:40
due to entropy so you could put those in
15:42
the same direction as a comic book and
15:44
they would realize but they'll have time
15:45
travel by then james
15:48
but then surely we could just go forward
15:50
in time to where they are oh just tell
15:52
them no
15:53
they'll they'll have time for them but
15:54
when they come back here to 2016 which
15:57
was the most interesting year in the
15:58
whole of history yeah we can just go oh
16:00
by the way although in that case what
16:02
are we worried about we should just wait
16:03
for the time
16:04
they can't be bothered to even develop
16:05
time travel i don't think they deserve
16:07
to save
16:07
these people um
16:12
the idea of time travel is finally
16:13
coming back but just being seriously
16:15
pissed off with us
16:16
there's no opening line but what's that
16:17
weird scream guy
16:19
don't go into our massively radioactive
16:22
why did you put a picture of the most
16:23
attractive woman from the 5 millionth
16:25
century
16:27
um so the scream yeah um
16:31
that guy is not screaming well the
16:33
scream is not coming from him the whole
16:36
point of that
16:37
painting is it's a scream coming from
16:39
nature
16:40
and he's kind of covering his ears to
16:42
keep out the scream that's coming from
16:44
nature
16:45
do we know what he meant by nature
16:48
screaming
16:49
um i'll read something that he said i
16:51
was walking along the road with two
16:52
friends
16:53
the sun was setting suddenly the sky
16:55
turned blood red
16:57
i paused feeling exhausted and leaned on
16:59
the fence
17:00
there was blood and tongues of fire
17:01
above the blue black fjord and the city
17:05
my friends walked on and i stood there
17:07
trembling with anxiety
17:08
and i sensed an infinite scream passing
17:11
through nature
17:12
it's almost like an anxiety attack isn't
17:14
it yeah it was just after the eruption
17:16
of
17:17
is it krakatoa 1880s yeah so there's
17:20
just been a volcanic eruption in
17:22
southeast asia and so
17:23
all the skies were quite weird and red
17:28
and they think that's where that came
17:29
from well people's faces also suddenly
17:31
going weirdly curvy
17:35
so i didn't know he did four versions of
17:36
it one dream one screen two
17:46
[Applause]
17:50
okay it is time for fact number three
17:52
and that is
17:53
my fact my fact this week is that karl
17:56
marx
17:57
used to do london pub crawls so london
18:00
pub crawls uh for anyone overseas that
18:02
means jumping from bar to bar
18:03
in a single evening and having a drink
18:06
at each of those bars he managed to do
18:07
18
18:08
bars so this is karl marx who i've
18:10
always associated as a deep
18:12
philosophical thinker
18:13
and not someone who was a piss-head they
18:16
went all the way up to
18:17
court road which is very close to where
18:19
uh we work and um
18:21
there's not as many bars these days on
18:22
it that were 18 in his day
18:24
and they managed to do it and at the end
18:26
they just got all laddish
18:28
and and started breaking stuff in the
18:30
street throwing
18:31
rocks at lamps and well they had a bit
18:33
of a
18:34
sort of xenophobic brawl with a bunch of
18:37
englishmen in a pub didn't they so
18:38
uh marx is one of the people that marx
18:40
was on this bar crawl with who is
18:42
wilhelm league next
18:43
uh wrote wrote about it later and so
18:46
they got into some chats with some
18:47
british guys in a pub and it all started
18:48
off very friendly
18:49
um and then they sort of started
18:52
debating politics and
18:54
he noted that at one point the british
18:56
people when they said russian they
18:57
usually meant prussian
18:59
it seems russia and prussia are
19:00
frequently confounded in england which
19:02
feels like classic english
19:03
rajo prasha whatever completely
19:05
different places obviously yeah
19:07
yeah then they started to claim that
19:08
germans were culturally superior to
19:10
english people and so i think the
19:12
english people started to fight them
19:14
wanted a fist fight
19:15
and they scarfed and then they decided
19:16
to smash up some lamp posts as they ran
19:18
away
19:18
did you know that karl marx when he went
19:20
on honeymoon with his wife jenny took
19:22
45 books with him that's so insulting
19:26
so rude unless they were books on the
19:28
art of good sex i think they weren't i
19:30
don't think they can all have been
19:31
don't you think there are that many in
19:33
my experience you only need a few of
19:34
those
19:35
on any holiday do you know jenny and
19:38
mark's had four daughters
19:40
were born uh three of them survived to
19:41
adulthood and they're all called jenny
19:44
yeah and then the song that they had is
19:45
called edgar after jenny's brother
19:48
weird i um i think my favorite thing
19:50
that i read about
19:51
karl marx is that obviously he's buried
19:53
in highgate cemetery and i've been to it
19:55
you can
19:56
if you live in london it's worth going
19:57
uh huge huge
19:59
tombstone with his head on the top of it
20:02
um and what i love is that there's
20:03
constantly reports being made
20:05
that marxists who go to visit him are
20:07
furious that they have to pay to get
20:09
into the graveyard
20:10
and none of them realize that when they
20:11
get there i think he's buried next to
20:13
herbert spencer
20:14
we've covered him he's the philosopher
20:16
who had an angry suit he got into when
20:17
he was angry
20:18
but he also had theories that were very
20:20
different to marx's
20:21
so in russia it's always a joke that
20:23
these two people are buried near each
20:25
other and they're kind of arguing after
20:26
death
20:27
oh really the other joke is they're marx
20:29
and spencer
20:30
oh yes i think they're opposite each
20:32
other in fact looking at each other yeah
20:34
do you know marx's biographer said one
20:36
of his personal habits to inspire his
20:38
creativity
20:38
was to stand up to he'll be at a table
20:42
working and he'd stand up and he'd start
20:43
walking around the table and he'd just
20:44
walk faster and faster and faster and
20:46
faster and he found that was a way to
20:47
make ideas
20:48
come to him just start kind of sprinting
20:50
around the table it just sounds like
20:51
you'd pass out
20:52
i think he had a lot of boils on his bum
20:54
as well he did
20:56
throughout life so he found sitting
20:57
incredibly hard so
20:59
it makes sense those two facts been
21:00
connected yeah exactly
21:02
although they did they do say that he
21:04
would do the walking around as soon as
21:05
the idea
21:06
came to him he'd immediately slam
21:08
himself into a chair and start writing
21:10
that doesn't sound like something you'd
21:11
do
21:11
with boys gently slide in yeah slytherin
21:15
slither in is that worthy that was one
21:17
of the pubs he went to actually
21:18
[Laughter]
21:22
yeah the skin disease he had was really
21:23
debilitating and he wrote to engle
21:25
saying he had boils all over his penis
21:27
that's a nice letter to get you know
21:30
engels maybe was there with a friend
21:31
going i have this philosopher marx i
21:33
know honestly i've got a letter from him
21:34
you should read
21:34
that he's an incredible brain from each
21:37
according to his ability to each
21:38
according to how many boils
21:40
the latter has on there we saw a letter
21:42
of his just a few days ago
21:44
you and i anna and i were at the british
21:45
library and they have this incredible
21:48
treasures room where they have
21:49
um original writings from dickens and
21:52
thomas hardy and everyone god is every
21:54
single person you'd want to see the
21:55
handwriting of
21:56
you'll see it there in this room and
21:57
they have a letter from marx to engels
21:59
and they
22:00
they used to write in pseudonyms they
22:01
used to have i'm not surprised because
22:03
most of what they were writing about
22:06
just on pub crawls there is an oliver
22:09
reed pub crawl
22:10
in wimbledon which is my hometown oh
22:12
yeah yeah and it's eight different pubs
22:15
and the record for it is two complete
22:17
laps i.e 16 pubs having a pint in each
22:19
and it is held by oliver reed
22:21
after he completed the 16 pubs he threw
22:24
up on steve mcqueen
22:28
um have you seen these guys um who are
22:31
trying to go to
22:32
every pub in the uk no no there's a
22:34
group of guys
22:36
um they're known as the black country
22:38
ale testers
22:40
so i assume they're from the middle and
22:41
somewhere uh and they've done
22:43
over 18 000 pubs in the uk
22:46
including every single one of the 3 905
22:49
pubs in wales
22:51
wow okay there used to be more of them
22:53
and then i think one of them died and a
22:55
few of them stopped when they reached 18
22:57
000 um but some of them are still going
22:59
uh there was an interview with one of
23:01
them in the newspaper
23:02
and he said nowadays i try to limit
23:04
myself to 1500 pints a year
23:09
that is restrained if i ever heard it
23:10
but they don't think they'll ever get
23:12
every single one in the uk because it's
23:13
just too many because they just keep
23:15
making new ones there's a similar
23:16
uh problem that is had by the woman
23:19
who's visited the most weather spoons in
23:20
the uk
23:21
this woman called max thompson and she's
23:23
been to 972 and that was as of
23:25
2014 i think but she says it's just very
23:28
hard to keep up because they keep
23:29
popping up everywhere
23:31
were they all in the same night and then
23:32
she vomited on steve mcqueen
23:34
she said um it's a good conversation
23:36
point if i meet someone from say swansea
23:39
i can say i know swansea
23:40
nice weatherspoon's there
23:50
[Applause]
23:51
okay it's time for our final fact of the
23:54
show and that is
23:55
james okay my fact this week is that
23:58
there is an insect in new zealand
23:59
who catches its prey by pretending to be
24:02
a star
24:03
which star does it pretend to be steve
24:05
mcqueen
24:09
no these are glow worms they live in a
24:11
cave
24:12
and they all live on the ceiling and
24:14
there's loads of them and they pretend
24:16
to be stars in the night sky
24:18
and there are other insects in there who
24:19
navigate using the stars
24:21
and they get confused by these glowworms
24:23
pretending to be stars and then they fly
24:25
into their lures
24:26
and they get eaten yeah it's amazing
24:29
it's pretty cool
24:30
and it requires serious cooperation
24:32
unless you want to be a star on a really
24:33
cloudy night
24:34
then they're all working together aren't
24:36
they yeah that's true i don't think they
24:38
do
24:38
exactly the same they don't constantly
24:40
ryan's belt
24:43
but yeah they just generally look like
24:45
stars so it's in the waitomo cave
24:47
uh which is in new zealand uh and i read
24:50
this in an article on the online
24:51
magazine deep look
24:53
they're from a species called arachno
24:56
camper luminosa
24:58
and yeah there's um moths and stuff in
25:01
this cave and they just there's like
25:02
little bits of mucus coming down and the
25:04
moths fly into the mucus and then they
25:06
can gobble them up a lovely way to go
25:08
you should put up a picture on your
25:10
twitter because
25:11
it looks unbelievable i will if you go
25:13
to my twitter at
25:14
egg shapes i'll put that picture up yeah
25:16
i really like as well that the glow
25:18
they can change the glow so if one of
25:21
the larvae next to them has eaten
25:23
it just calms down a bit and if there's
25:25
a hungry one next to it it glows harder
25:26
like it's going oh
25:28
come on yeah it just puts out more glow
25:30
wow
25:31
i think most female glow worms the
25:33
harder they glow the more eggs they have
25:34
so it is actually a good thing uh for a
25:37
male to see a glowworm that's really
25:38
glowing like
25:39
hell um because it means that she's more
25:41
likely to be fertile
25:43
um but by total coincidence this weekend
25:46
i was hanging out with glow worms
25:47
which is wigs i don't think we've ever
25:48
talked about them before but yeah i was
25:49
in cornwall
25:50
in uh a place called caddwith where
25:53
everyone should go because it's one of
25:54
the only guaranteed glowworm
25:56
sighting places the people of cadsworth
25:58
will love that now
26:00
it's got a very nice weatherspoon
26:04
it does not have a weather spoon but
26:06
they are incredible they do look like
26:08
something that sci-fi has created and
26:10
there's this one in particular i love
26:11
that's called the railroad worm
26:13
which has a body that glows green and a
26:16
head that glows red
26:17
and it's called the railroad worm
26:18
because it looks like a set of railway
26:19
tracks it's got little green dots up
26:21
either side of its body that lead to a
26:23
red light
26:23
but it's like a little worm traffic
26:25
light that's amazing it's it's beautiful
26:27
look it up
26:28
the i was reading the uk glowworm survey
26:31
website because there are there are i
26:32
think a few hundred places in the uk
26:34
where you can see
26:35
but not i mean not not as good as this
26:37
one though well yeah and
26:39
i think there's nowhere else in the
26:39
world it's like the white turmoil case
26:41
but the one of the
26:42
headings on the uk glowworm website is
26:45
is it really a glow worm
26:47
and then it says one cause of false
26:49
reports of glow worms
26:51
is actually light reflected from shiny
26:53
leaves do you
26:55
or litter please check that what you see
26:59
really is a beetle with the light coming
27:01
from the final tail segments
27:02
not a salt and vinegar crisp bucket
27:06
because that's what they are the beetles
27:07
aren't they they're not worms
27:10
um so actually i think they're in a bit
27:13
of trouble in the uk aren't they glow
27:14
worms
27:14
a lot of them are dying out i think
27:16
they're improving a bit now but for a
27:18
while they did
27:19
one of the reasons is dog poo and
27:22
apparently according to nick moyes
27:24
who's the assistant keeper at derby
27:26
museum he says the number of glow worms
27:28
especially around him has gone down
27:29
because
27:30
dog poo creates more plank growth
27:34
they make it hard for the females and
27:36
males of the glowworm species to find
27:38
each other because there's so much plant
27:39
life that is fascinating and i'm going
27:41
to take it up with kangaroo council
27:43
because
27:44
they put a sign up on their cliff path
27:46
which says please excuse the
27:49
overgrown path we like to encourage glow
27:51
worms to
27:52
hang out and breathe here that is
27:54
obviously just an excuse for
27:55
lazy path clearance that's interesting
27:57
or nick moyes at the derby museum
28:00
is wrong so let's not jump to any
28:03
conclusion
28:04
there are two different species of glow
28:06
worm
28:07
no but i'd like to see a fight between
28:09
nick moyes and cad with county council
28:10
so
28:15
so i've been reading about various
28:16
insects that live in caves and various
28:18
other cave dwelling animals
28:19
so there's one you might like to know
28:20
about uh which is a species of cave
28:22
insect called neo trogla
28:24
and this is an interesting thing because
28:26
the females have penises and the males
28:29
have
28:29
vaginas well surely that makes them male
28:32
and female no well
28:33
no here's the thing so the female is a
28:35
penis-like organ
28:36
uh i think it's technically known as a
28:39
gynosome
28:40
and it gets erections and it's spiny
28:45
[Laughter]
28:50
yeah so the female gets an erection in
28:51
her gynecoma and the male has a
28:53
vagina-like
28:54
chamber right and the female inserts her
28:57
penis into the mail
28:59
to hold it still and then it acts like a
29:01
vacuum cleaner and it sucks out the male
29:03
sperm oh my gosh it's like the seal and
29:05
walrus all over it
29:07
it can do that for up to 70 hours
29:09
straight wow
29:10
yeah and the thing is um 70 hours 70
29:14
hours
29:14
and the really interesting thing is that
29:16
i mean well that's the really
29:17
interesting thing but this other thing
29:19
um so they're locked together
29:21
unbelievably tightly due to these
29:23
bristles and spines and pouches in the
29:25
males
29:25
of genre and the bristles on the penis
29:27
so there was a scientist from hokkaido
29:29
university who was experimenting he
29:30
tried pulling a copulating pair apart
29:32
and why would you do that well i know
29:34
well it gets worse because the male was
29:35
then ripped in two
29:38
it's a bad end to a date in this you
29:40
think it's going so well
29:42
and then yeah so that it possibly means
29:45
that
29:45
males in the natural world can't
29:47
actually resist the act of mating
29:49
because they'll do themselves more
29:50
damage
29:51
sure i looked at a couple of uh things
29:53
on insect camouflage
29:54
strategies or insects disguising
29:56
themselves as other things
29:58
so one of the things i love is that
30:01
spiders which obviously aren't insects
30:03
disguise themselves as ants by lifting
30:05
up their two front legs and pretending
30:07
that their antenna by waving them above
30:09
their heads
30:11
so then they only have six legs
30:12
obviously yeah and they've already gone
30:13
and then they lift another two and
30:15
pretend to be a cow
30:16
and then another two and pretend to be a
30:18
human
30:19
they've found um not too long ago that
30:22
um
30:23
camouflage within insects has been going
30:24
back for a very very long time like
30:26
they've actually found in amber the
30:28
earliest examples of it
30:29
and it was found by a chinese academy of
30:32
sciences in engine
30:33
by a team led by bo wang and uh
30:36
it's called debris camouflage and debris
30:38
camouflage is when
30:40
you just carry effectively carrying a
30:42
leaf on top of you but they've got
30:43
examples of it where it definitely was
30:47
just trying to hide underneath the lead
30:48
just like sellotaping leaves you and
30:51
pretending to be a tree
30:52
exactly and none of you has asked me why
30:54
i've got an empty pack of salt and
30:55
vinegar crisps on top of my head
30:57
and i thought it was a glow weather
30:59
[Laughter]
31:02
orchids disguise themselves as wasps so
31:04
that other wasps will have sex with them
31:06
rather than just attracting the wasps to
31:07
go and pick up pollen they actually make
31:09
wasps come and mate with them by
31:10
emitting smells that smell like a wasp
31:12
and making themselves look like a wasp
31:14
and 75 percent of wasps who land on
31:16
these orchids
31:18
do actually ejaculate so they just go
31:19
away thinking oh i successfully had sex
31:21
there
31:22
isn't that weird i think they've just
31:24
mated with an act without the other
31:25
thing is humans
31:26
we have no idea what the thing is that
31:29
is persuading us to have sex with it by
31:31
successfully mimicking your humanity i
31:32
found out that my wife's been an orchid
31:34
all this time
31:37
we don't know what is it what's out
31:44
there
31:47
okay that's it that's all of our facts
31:49
thank you so much for listening if you'd
31:51
like to get in contact with any of us

00:11
hello
00:12
and welcome to another episode of no
00:14
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:16
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:18
covent garden
00:19
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
00:21
here with anna chazinski andy murray and
00:23
james harkin
00:24
and once again we have gathered around
00:26
the microphones with our four favorite
00:27
facts from the last seven days
00:29
and in no particular order here we go
00:32
starting with you
00:33
andy my fact is that 18th century
00:36
hairstyles included the spaniel's ears
00:39
mad dog and the drowned chicken
00:43
these are all dues that you could get
00:45
and do we know what they look like
00:46
i haven't been able to find what these
00:47
ones look like no but there are so many
00:50
um insane styles i suppose we can
00:52
imagine what a drowned chicken looks
00:53
like
00:54
yeah and it's hard to imagine that would
00:55
be a desirable hairstyle yeah
00:57
some kind of punishment yeah a dog as
00:59
well it's bed hair basically but yeah
01:02
you're drooling yeah the spaniel's is is
01:05
that a hairstyle that you see
01:06
loads in 18th century paintings where
01:08
women have their hair flat on top and
01:10
then
01:10
curled down the sides it looks like
01:13
you've got spaniels it is
01:14
there's also um there were two others
01:16
around that time called
01:18
one was called the chest of drawers and
01:20
the other one was called sportsman in
01:21
the bush
01:25
what did that nice it'd be so fun to uh
01:28
if time travel was ever cracked go back
01:30
not look into what it was and just ask
01:32
for that sit down and see what you get
01:34
that would be such a cool dare yeah
01:38
there were loads of really fancy styles
01:39
particularly in france and i did read a
01:41
theory that the french revolution was
01:43
partly caused by
01:45
marie antoinette's crazy hair okay so
01:49
well she had a royal hairdresser called
01:51
leonard ot
01:52
and he made these incredibly fancy
01:54
hairdos for her
01:55
with a few other people uh and the
01:57
ladies of the court all followed suit
01:59
and that uh led to some of the earliest
02:01
attacks on marie antoinette in pamphlet
02:03
form
02:04
so obviously it wasn't the entire cause
02:07
but it was
02:08
like a symptom basically i guess so it
02:10
represented her
02:11
um wealth compared to exactly enough i
02:14
mean not wealth yeah
02:15
the the most famous is the coffee alabel
02:17
pool which is a french ship
02:19
and it had just beaten an english ship
02:21
very heavily in a battle
02:22
and so she got the ship in her hair not
02:25
the actual ship though
02:28
very impressive did they shape her hair
02:30
into the shape of a boat or did they
02:32
like construct it with plywood or what
02:34
you do is
02:35
you get your hair and then you put a
02:37
load of cushions
02:38
sort of on your scalp and a metal frame
02:40
and then you can build up your hair
02:41
around that
02:42
okay and then you put in a load of other
02:44
hair as well and then you put in a model
02:46
of a ship and it had rigging and it had
02:48
little model sailors on it there's a
02:49
modern version of this that you can see
02:51
which was elton john's 50th birthday he
02:53
went as marie antoinette with the ship
02:56
in a wig and the only reason i know that
02:59
is i met a prop maker who made the holy
03:02
grail for the indiana jones movie he
03:04
also made the ship
03:05
for elton john's weight really yeah and
03:07
it came with a little pipe
03:08
that went down into his clothing that
03:11
every time he pressed
03:12
little cannons had little bits of smoke
03:15
shoot out of it
03:16
so it looked like he was shooting
03:17
cannons so the thing is um it's
03:19
apparently it was
03:20
huge to carry so just to give an idea of
03:22
how heavy those things must have been
03:24
elton john realized he couldn't get to
03:26
the party in a car he had to go
03:28
in a removals van that's the only way he
03:30
could get to the barney
03:32
yeah it was so heavy and the driver went
03:33
the wrong way so they were stuck in the
03:34
van for over an hour and a half and he
03:36
got so frustrated with it he
03:38
tried to cancel the party they did used
03:40
to have to dismantle their hairstyles
03:41
when they got into carriages
03:42
i think mary antoinette used to have
03:43
someone who would have to take off the
03:45
top layer of hair so she could fit into
03:46
a carriage
03:47
well there's loads of uh accounts of all
03:50
this stuff and some of them
03:51
i think are not true because some of
03:52
them they only have mid 19th century
03:54
sources and it's all about the late 18th
03:56
century
03:56
so for example this is a story that i
03:58
think is not true because the earliest
03:59
source i've found is 1862
04:01
but there was a guy called bollard who
04:03
allegedly
04:04
invented a thing called the mechanical
04:06
quaffier which uh when you press the
04:08
spring
04:09
it would lower by a foot if you wanted
04:12
to get into a car then you press the
04:13
spring again and it goes up
04:16
and it was if you were talking to a
04:17
grandmother and uh you know you wanted
04:19
to be respectful and not have a crazy
04:21
hair
04:21
you could just lower it quickly that
04:23
would be really useful if you went to
04:25
a theme park and you had to be a certain
04:26
height to get on the rides
04:29
um speaking of carrying hair around
04:31
obviously your wig was a massive
04:33
commodity uh back in the 18th century
04:35
i was reading about hair theft and
04:37
there's amazing accounts of what
04:39
happened in the 18th century where
04:41
uh people would be walking along and
04:43
suddenly their hair would just disappear
04:44
their wig would just disappear in a
04:46
crowd
04:47
and what they reckon it was were guys
04:49
who were sort of tall burly men
04:50
who were carrying a butcher's tray over
04:52
their shoulder that contained a small
04:54
child
04:55
inside the butcher's tray and the small
04:57
child would peek out
04:58
quickly grab the hair the wig head back
05:01
into the butcher's tray so by the time
05:03
the person turned around there was just
05:04
a burly man
05:05
with the thing on his shoulder that's
05:06
because wigs were really expensive yeah
05:08
right incredibly expensive
05:10
so it was really expensive to get these
05:12
hairstyles done as well and so i hadn't
05:14
quite realized how long they would stay
05:15
in place unless you were
05:16
married antoinette who i think asked for
05:18
a new hairstyle every day you put it in
05:20
place and you kept it there for a few
05:21
weeks
05:22
you basically kept it there for as long
05:23
as it took to go really moldy because
05:25
the stuff they used to keep it in were
05:27
things like animal fats weren't they so
05:29
i think they would end up getting really
05:30
moldy and smelly and you'd get a lot of
05:32
kind of creatures in your hair who are
05:33
attracted to the substances you used but
05:35
people would have these hairstyles in
05:36
for two or three weeks
05:38
and they just have to sleep with their
05:39
heads propped up on lots of pillows
05:41
wow i was reading just a little bit
05:42
about other fashionable things to be
05:44
wearing in your hair
05:45
there were things like if you're a fun
05:47
woman you'd have lots of fake
05:48
butterflies in your hair to show that
05:49
you're a fun woman
05:51
apparently wives of officers wore entire
05:53
squadrons perched on their head
05:55
to show that they were an officer yeah
05:57
so not real
05:58
miniature i believe but yeah i'd like to
06:01
see a woman with a squadron of soldiers
06:03
in her hair getting into a fight with a
06:04
woman who had a ship in her hair
06:06
i'd like to see the little soldiers try
06:07
and get onto the ship that would be my
06:09
target but you can't have infantry
06:11
versus the navy i mean it's just
06:13
you can just fight can't you you know i
06:15
don't know whether there were rules in
06:16
war
06:18
i guess that is true but if you were a
06:20
general
06:21
and you say okay there's a ship over
06:22
there i'm going to send my inventory
06:26
this is the reason i wasn't allowed into
06:28
the army
06:28
[Laughter]
06:31
roman brides would have their hair um
06:34
cut into six sections or braided into
06:37
six sections
06:39
and each of the locks had to be
06:41
separated with a spear
06:42
that had been used to kill a gladiator
06:46
and for best results you would still
06:47
have the blood of the gladiator on the
06:49
spear
06:50
the best results leave in for two and a
06:51
half minutes and ensure that a dead
06:52
gladiator's blood is on the tip of your
06:54
spear
06:55
that can't be in every wedding no it
06:57
wasn't i think it was very high profile
06:59
high society weddings yeah exactly
07:00
fair enough um the puritans they like
07:03
short hair
07:04
of course but there was one puritan
07:06
called william prin
07:07
and he said that people who had long
07:09
curly hair
07:10
like mine uh were unlawful effeminate
07:14
vainglorious evil odious immodest
07:16
indecent lascivious wanton dissolute
07:19
ungodly horrid strange
07:21
outlandish impudent
07:23
pernicious offensive ridiculous foolish
07:26
childish and unchristian
07:28
i'd say that's a fair description of you
07:31
i don't think you're
07:32
[Laughter]
07:34
everything else stands so
07:37
get this this is very cool um before uh
07:41
hairdryers electrical hairdryers were
07:42
invented what you could have
07:44
uh was a stoneware hairdryer and it was
07:46
like a hot water bottle but for your
07:48
hair
07:48
right so you would fill it with boiling
07:51
water what
07:52
and then you brush it through your hair
07:54
and it allegedly dries it in a few
07:55
minutes
07:56
pretty clean i guess it would like
07:58
ironing your hair have you ever ironed
08:00
your hair no but i imagine that would
08:01
dry
08:01
quite fast i am not joking i used to
08:04
iron my sister and her friend's hair
08:06
uh we'd get an iron out and it's very
08:08
hard because you've got to go quite
08:09
close to the scalp i burnt quite a few
08:10
skulls because you don't want it to kink
08:12
when it goes off the edge of the that's
08:13
best results though is to have a little
08:15
bit of your own blood through
08:16
through the hair yes that's what i said
08:18
uh would you try that on me later so i
08:20
look a bit less
08:22
in the 19th century uh furniture used to
08:24
be covered with macasa protectors so
08:26
mikasa was the popular hair royal
08:27
that was so widespread that if you
08:29
invited guest rounds you knew that your
08:30
furniture would end up covered in it
08:32
and so you got some training special yes
08:34
and in theaters
08:35
yeah anthony mccasters are called yeah
08:37
yeah you know the little lacy thing on a
08:39
train seat
08:40
so you can kind of feel that behind your
08:41
head yeah yeah that's because
08:43
obviously when you get on a train you
08:45
want to put your macasa on so that you
08:47
look great when you get to the other end
08:48
didn't know that
08:49
have you noticed that whenever you get
08:50
on a train there's never any macasa on
08:52
the chair
08:53
yeah that makes sense now
08:56
everything's falling into place for you
08:59
the entire world has basically been
09:00
built around the need to avoid getting
09:01
macassar everywhere
09:04
my favorite hair in history was the hair
09:06
of chief white eagle
09:08
uh he had the world's strongest hair uh
09:11
and
09:11
he used to be dangled under an aeroplane
09:14
by tying his hair to the bottom of an
09:16
airplane
09:16
no hang on it would take off at what
09:18
point do we think
09:20
he discovered that he could do that well
09:22
he also um
09:23
jumped from planes with his hair
09:25
attached to parachutes
09:28
that is so cool so he would let it open
09:31
and his hair
09:31
was the string yeah yeah i think they're
09:34
also a parachute
09:36
there were longer strings attached to
09:37
his hair but his hair was basically the
09:39
thing attaching him to the parachute
09:40
when was this guy
09:41
active um i'm not sure it was earlier
09:45
it sounds like he was he fighting was in
09:46
a military capacity he was hanging from
09:48
planes
09:48
it was early 20th century um what
09:52
military application could that have
09:54
all right chaps we've got the mission we
09:56
need to take out
09:57
the ship but we've only got a plane to
09:59
do it with can we not send in the
10:01
infantry afraid not they all drowned
10:04
last week
10:04
[Laughter]
10:08
[Music]
10:12
okay it is time for fact number two and
10:15
that is my fact
10:16
my fact this week is that the 1959
10:19
formula one
10:20
championship was won on foot wow start
10:23
to finish
10:24
no not starting to finish so there's a
10:27
great
10:27
australian formula one driver called
10:29
jack brabham
10:30
the story behind it is that he was
10:32
making this final race that was going to
10:34
win him the championship he was on his
10:36
final lap victory was in sight
10:38
and suddenly he ran out of petrol the
10:40
car just came to a total halt
10:42
and that should have been the end of the
10:43
race for him instead he got out
10:45
and he pushed the car all the way to the
10:48
finishing line
10:49
and he came in fourth place but that was
10:50
enough to win him the championship
10:52
jack brabham is the only person to have
10:54
won a formula one race uh
10:55
driving one of his own cars yes because
10:58
he later went into making cars
11:00
and developing them and saying it's not
11:01
just his run around
11:04
that little ford focus that he had yeah
11:07
yeah
11:07
he's kind of one of those characters so
11:08
he's he's an australian and
11:10
um he kind of describes when he came
11:12
over to england in order
11:14
to to start racing for the formula one
11:16
that they treated him as a kind of
11:18
really backward character from australia
11:20
and so every single championship that he
11:22
won
11:22
everyone assumed that he was going to
11:24
lose so the third one which he won
11:26
in his own car everyone thought he was
11:27
past his peak thought he was too old to
11:29
do it anymore
11:30
so he came out to the starting line to
11:32
his car he walked out with a fake long
11:34
beard
11:35
and a walking stick and acted like an
11:37
old man all the way to his car
11:40
and then went and won that one won what
11:42
a cool guy
11:43
yeah one of his cars was called the
11:45
brabham bt46
11:47
and it had a massive fan on the back of
11:49
it and this fan
11:50
would move the air so that it sucks the
11:53
car down to the track
11:54
and it made it a lot more aerodynamic
11:57
and he used it for one race which he
11:59
won but all of the other drivers
12:01
complained about it
12:02
and they said it wasn't fair that he had
12:03
it and they didn't and also that the fan
12:06
kind of picked up stones off the track
12:07
and shot them at the following cars
12:09
and then after the first race he agreed
12:11
he would never use it again wow even
12:13
though it wasn't technically against the
12:14
rules
12:16
so this is the thing the formula in
12:17
formula one is the set of rules that all
12:19
drivers have to stick to
12:20
um and i found a friend of mine my
12:22
friend max furman works at mclaren
12:25
and what he says this is so cool is that
12:28
basically the whole aim is to create
12:29
downward force on the car
12:31
so they're all built like the opposite
12:32
of a plane's wing which is designed to
12:34
lift you up
12:35
you have to get it as low as possible to
12:37
make it as aerodynamic as possible
12:39
and above a certain speed the cars are
12:41
so good at creating the downward force
12:43
that they could drive
12:44
upside down along the ceiling of a
12:46
tunnel that is crazy
12:48
why are they not doing that yeah why
12:56
a new mario kart that does that kind of
12:58
stuff and
13:00
yeah it's very exciting you're saying
13:01
the idea is already there i'm saying
13:02
we've seen the future we've seen what it
13:04
looks like it does work
13:05
the transition from mario kart to mario
13:07
kart ceiling
13:08
works but why yeah why are we not doing
13:11
it i don't know
13:12
well i guess it's probably not very safe
13:14
yeah like i know probably not very
13:16
exciting it does work but then what
13:17
happens if you hit a stone and you
13:19
suddenly lose a bit of down force and
13:21
it's true um the the downwards force and
13:24
generally the pressure applied to
13:25
formula one drivers
13:26
is very extreme obviously so the force
13:29
when it's at its maximum
13:30
um is about five times their normal
13:33
weight of force on their bodies
13:35
and that means that the exercise that
13:38
they have to do most frequently
13:39
is on their neck if you're a formula one
13:41
driver the thing you focus on constantly
13:43
is on neck exercises so they have all
13:44
these ways of
13:45
making sure that they are able to take
13:47
this kind of pressure i think there's a
13:49
particular formula one helmet that one
13:50
of the trainers designed
13:52
which is surrounded by pulleys and so
13:54
the driver
13:55
wears the helmet and then his trainer
13:57
pulls all the pulleys in various
13:59
directions
13:59
and the driver has to practice kind of
14:01
counterbalancing that with the force of
14:02
his neck
14:03
they should just walk around with a
14:04
massive ship on their heads
14:05
[Laughter]
14:07
it is amazing though like you uh i'd
14:10
assume that the training would be just
14:11
get in a car
14:12
and drive around the track that was not
14:14
my assumption but you read about the
14:16
training that all these formula one guys
14:18
have to do and it's it's
14:19
a mixture of skiing it's a mixture of
14:21
swimming it's it's
14:22
well you never know if your car runs out
14:24
of petrol on these slopes
14:25
[Laughter]
14:29
the other thing i didn't know is that
14:30
they changed gear constantly about up to
14:32
4 000 times the rate
14:33
really yeah i just thought they sat
14:34
there and put their foot down they're
14:35
constantly changing gear
14:37
it's once every 1.3 seconds in the
14:39
canadian grand prix
14:41
how annoying must that be and the actual
14:42
change of gear is
14:44
um 50 times faster than you can blink
14:46
yeah that is better than your standard
14:48
manual car gear change
14:50
i've seen the um the the wheel the
14:53
actual steering wheels these days yeah
14:54
it's like a console
14:55
it's like a console yeah there's about
14:57
70 buttons on it that they and little
14:59
knobs that they just turn and
15:00
so you know the best button no is the
15:02
button delivered
15:03
to seats it's not an effective seat it's
15:05
delivered drink to my mouth now
15:08
they've all got a little tube going into
15:10
their mouth and they have a button which
15:11
they press
15:12
and it delivers them a drink when you
15:13
just said deliver drink to my mouth now
15:15
that sounded like anna in a bar
15:18
yeah and where can i get one of these
15:20
little console things because
15:22
i don't think whiskey's in it but i
15:23
think they can probably fill it with
15:24
whatever they like
15:25
yeah they probably don't fill it with
15:26
whiskey though um so one guy who
15:28
probably would have liked this was a
15:29
motor racing driver called duncan
15:30
hamilton
15:32
okay so in 1953 he was in the le monde
15:34
24-hour race
15:36
but in qualifying he had the same number
15:38
as another car
15:39
and got disqualified for having the same
15:41
number as another car how did that
15:43
happen
15:43
well just an admin problem i guess
15:47
anyway so they went out in the town in
15:48
le mans and got absolutely shit-faced
15:51
and then the organizers during this time
15:53
thought actually that is quite harsh
15:55
let's let them back in
15:56
so so his bosses went to the bar to try
16:00
and find him
16:00
and he's kind of slumped over about
16:02
somewhere and they're like come on come
16:03
on we got to do the race
16:04
and he's like well i'm not sure i'm okay
16:07
to do this and they're like no no come
16:08
on come on come on
16:09
and so he took part uh absolutely ship
16:12
first
16:13
driving the le mans 24 hour this is in
16:15
1953.
16:17
uh and every pit stop the crew started
16:19
giving him coffee to try and sober him
16:21
up
16:22
and then after about you know a dozen of
16:23
these pit stops he said no stop giving
16:25
me coffee because it's making me shake
16:27
and so instead they started giving him
16:29
more brandy
16:32
to stop him from shaking and sure enough
16:34
he won the race
16:36
whoa that's incredible that is we do not
16:39
condone that by the way
16:40
on this podcast on the normal roads but
16:43
wow
16:44
here's a thing so that's the wheels
16:45
right have you heard about their helmets
16:46
and how good they are
16:47
because they're unbelievably because
16:49
they have to experience
16:51
severe impact without yes buckling so
16:54
they have to withstand a flame huge
16:57
torture flame for 45 seconds
16:59
without it getting unbearably hot inside
17:00
so they test them that way imagine the
17:02
work experience guy and he's like what
17:04
am i doing today well just put this
17:05
helmet on
17:06
oh is it the fun drinking one i'm afraid
17:08
not today
17:10
i love um bernie ecclestone's ideas to
17:12
improve formula one he always comes up
17:14
with like i think they're just sound
17:16
bites but they're usually pretty funny
17:17
oh really so
17:18
one of them was that he said that they
17:20
should have fake
17:21
rainstorms halfway through each race
17:24
he's like why rely on the weather
17:26
why don't we just for 20 minutes put
17:29
sprinklers on this
17:30
all the tracks so there's a fake
17:32
rainstorm to make it fair
17:34
it adds a bit of unpredictability to it
17:36
because in formula one often i think
17:38
it's just people driving around
17:39
struggling to overtake each other
17:40
he's suggesting making it unpredictable
17:42
by ensuring that the same thing happens
17:44
in every race yes but you never know
17:46
when it's going to happen
17:48
oh cool and that maybe you would give
17:50
the teams like 10 minutes
17:51
head start it's like it's going to rain
17:53
in 10 minutes and everyone's like oh no
17:55
did he say anything about maybe there
17:57
being a section in every race where the
17:59
floor suddenly disappears and you need
18:00
to ride the roof
18:01
in order to get here now but i'm sure if
18:04
he's listening
18:05
do you know they have to test wet tyres
18:08
obviously the wet weather tyres and all
18:09
the tires are so cool they can clear
18:11
60 litres of water away from the tires
18:13
in one second
18:15
wow that's how fast they're going and
18:16
how much water they're coming into
18:17
contact with
18:18
isn't that amazing and they're full of
18:19
nitrogen aren't they rather than normal
18:21
air
18:22
are they i think so because um if you
18:24
put normal air in
18:26
then you're more likely to get water
18:27
vapor and the water vapor when the tire
18:30
heats up can kind of do unpredictable
18:32
things but if you have nitrogen very
18:33
inert
18:34
it'll be absolutely fine so that's
18:35
something they have in common with crisp
18:36
packets which are also full of nitrogen
18:38
instead of air because air will make the
18:40
crisps go off because the oxygen will
18:42
react with a crisp
18:43
nitrogen is an inert gas doesn't affect
18:45
that so crisps and formula one tires
18:47
so bernie another tip for a possible
18:50
challenge in the race you have to have
18:51
at least one time made of a crisp packet
18:55
and then the driver can just press a
18:56
button on his wheel which says deliver
18:58
crips to my mouse
19:02
[Music]
19:05
[Applause]
19:06
okay it's time for fact number three and
19:09
that's
19:10
james okay my fact this week is that the
19:13
earliest known mention
19:14
of the balalaika is of someone being
19:17
arrested for playing one
19:20
when was this okay this was in
19:23
1688 oh wow they're that old
19:26
oh yeah probably older but this is the
19:28
first mention of them
19:29
um and this was two peasants who were
19:32
called safka
19:33
theodorov and ivashko dimitrijev
19:36
who ran up to a gate uh antagonized the
19:39
guard
19:40
um while singing and playing the
19:41
balalaika and then got arrested
19:43
oh really wow yeah imagine if those two
19:46
guys could know
19:47
that more than 300 years after
19:51
this event people in the future will be
19:54
talking about it
19:55
yeah and he's making fun of them
19:56
[Laughter]
19:58
the next mention was in 1700 and
20:01
there were two coachmen who were chased
20:04
by the servant of the magistrate
20:06
and beaten with their own balalaika oh
20:08
oh
20:09
my gosh are they very solid or they
20:11
would they smash
20:12
uh they've got corners haven't they yeah
20:14
they're triangular right so
20:15
a balalaika is a stringed musical
20:18
instrument a bit like a guitar
20:19
from russia which has got triangular
20:21
bass and
20:22
um the triangular bass is supposed to
20:24
give it a slightly different timbre and
20:26
a slightly different sound to normal
20:27
instruments so why does everyone hate
20:30
people who are using bella likers in the
20:31
early days
20:32
well i think it was a protest instrument
20:35
in the olden days in russia they didn't
20:36
like
20:37
people playing music in general the
20:39
russian orthodox church
20:41
really basically said you shouldn't be
20:42
playing any instruments and so what they
20:44
would do
20:45
is if they caught you playing a
20:47
balalaika they basically steal it off
20:49
you
20:50
and then crush it and just burn it or
20:52
whatever and then
20:53
people would just remake them because
20:55
actually they were really easy to make
20:56
and that's one theory why you have these
20:58
triangular bases because a triangular
21:00
guitar is easier to make than a round
21:02
one and so
21:03
that's one theory as to why bella likers
21:05
are triangular the same as with dairylee
21:08
cheese it's just easier to make the
21:10
cheese also i hated by the russian
21:13
you know that uh june 23rd is
21:15
international balalaika day
21:17
yeah i did i did read that um but then
21:20
i'd never heard of it being an
21:21
international citizen and i asked two
21:23
russians and neither of those have heard
21:25
of it either well the sentence says
21:27
was right after saying that it's
21:28
international balalaika day uh
21:30
also said no one cares it's just a day
21:33
that no one cares about
21:34
no one celebrates it's international day
21:36
of like about 20 things that no one
21:38
cares about isn't it
21:39
it's true yeah um just on the fact that
21:41
they were a rebellion
21:42
instrument um i through this fact
21:44
learned about this group of people that
21:46
i'd never heard of before but who sound
21:47
really interesting
21:48
called uh scommerox and they were the
21:51
people who were most associated with
21:52
playing the balalaika i think
21:54
traditionally in russia
21:55
and so this is one of the reasons the
21:57
government didn't like the instrument
21:58
because skomarrocks were
22:00
these jesters actors singers and their
22:03
whole modus operandi was really going
22:05
around and satirizing the church and
22:07
state and they sound great and they
22:08
seem to go on for a couple of hundred
22:10
years just going from town to town
22:12
performing and taking the piss out of
22:14
the government and the church yeah
22:15
often exposing themselves uh festivals
22:18
whatever reason they were not liked
22:20
because they were just
22:22
i think the word might come from the
22:24
same route as scaramouche which was the
22:26
character in comedia del arte
22:28
uh and they were basically just that guy
22:30
from that queen song as well
22:32
yeah yeah it is yeah is he literally
22:35
that's where they got the word from
22:36
yeah yeah and um these were basically
22:38
just
22:39
peasants would have parties like this
22:42
and they did it all over europe not just
22:44
in russia not just in
22:45
italy but everywhere it's sort of odd
22:47
that they all had the same instrument
22:49
because if i if i was a skomarok i'd
22:51
turn up with something different like uh
22:53
like a piano or a violin but then i'd
22:56
i'd reveal
22:57
actually i'm still here to make fun of
22:58
you like i think it's an odd
23:00
piano's of course yet to be invented
23:02
well a um
23:04
what's the thing before wasn't the heart
23:05
accord the predecessor to the
23:07
piano forte was called the forte piano
23:09
oh yeah wasn't it
23:10
yeah was it just an upside down piano
23:13
you had to play it upside down
23:14
in a tunnel while going at 100 50 miles
23:17
an hour
23:18
yeah so piano is shot for piano forte
23:21
which means quiet loud and what they
23:22
were looking for was a percussion
23:24
instrument which could
23:25
make quiet noises and loud noises at the
23:28
same time like a guitar could
23:29
and because all the other ones like
23:31
harpsichords and an organ you can really
23:32
only kind of play
23:33
loud for an organ and quiet perhaps a
23:36
god yeah
23:37
very boring very boring music i was just
23:39
thinking just like the formula one thing
23:41
if we
23:42
think of that technology wouldn't it be
23:43
cool if there was just an extra key on
23:44
the piano that the penis could play and
23:46
it delivers a bit of drink to them
23:48
as they're playing long concertos i
23:50
believe this is an old joke but i
23:51
genuinely heard you just say wouldn't it
23:53
be cool if there was an extra key on a
23:54
piano that a penis could play
23:55
i heard that i heard that if you're
23:57
playing at both ends of the piano really
23:59
low notes are really high notes but you
24:00
need to play a middle note
24:04
um didn't mozart sometimes play with his
24:06
knees
24:08
i could have sworn there was a there was
24:10
one very early kind of piano which had
24:12
pedals that were knee operated yeah and
24:14
i think mozart played one of them
24:17
um just on balance there seems to be a
24:19
room in a lot of russian media that um
24:21
bala likes have been banned in the us
24:23
which is a totally unfounded rumor
24:24
and i'm not sure where it came from but
24:26
so a lot of russian people
24:28
complained that the us is completely
24:29
banned bala like us which is not the
24:31
case i think it's not an
24:32
extremely common fallacy but i think it
24:35
comes up on news articles every now and
24:37
then every international battle like a
24:39
day i certainly protest about the fact
24:40
that
24:41
i did read a debunk of it which pointed
24:43
out no they're not banned they've never
24:45
been banned it's just that there's no
24:46
market for bala like us in the usa
24:49
do you know instruments are banned on
24:51
television in iran
24:52
um which i didn't know at all so you
24:55
can't show musical instruments on state
24:57
tv
24:58
and there have been a couple of
24:59
occasions i think where tv channels have
25:01
accidentally contravened this rule
25:03
um so there was one where someone
25:05
started singing on iranian tv
25:07
and then they began to play the piano
25:09
but as soon as they started playing the
25:10
piano they had to cut off the program he
25:12
was playing it with his penis
25:13
[Laughter]
25:16
um if you have an orchestra shown then
25:18
only the singer can be in front of a
25:19
curtain and then the rest of the
25:20
orchestra and all the players are behind
25:22
the curtain
25:23
it's really interesting because it's
25:24
thought to be well some sheer
25:26
clerics think that it's an act that's
25:28
forbidden by islamic law to show
25:30
musical instruments in public right um
25:32
another weird instrument
25:34
that was invented by a russian is the
25:36
theremin so
25:37
the way you play is it has antenna which
25:38
sends the vibrations of your hand so you
25:40
don't touch the instrument while playing
25:41
it you can be
25:42
sort of a decent distance away can't you
25:44
and your right hand controls the pitch
25:45
so your right hand is controlling the
25:46
notes that you play
25:47
and your left hand controls the volume
25:49
um and it's rigged up to know this this
25:51
instrument
25:52
and it sounds really lovely it sounds
25:54
kind of like a very high-pitched violin
25:56
and almost like a human voice
25:57
like a lot of instruments it sounds
25:59
lovely if you know how to play it
26:00
yeah yeah yeah yeah i imagine if i just
26:03
started waving at one it would be the
26:04
worst thing you'd ever heard it would be
26:05
banned immediately yeah
26:06
bill bailey plays them yeah have you
26:08
have you seen the min
26:09
it's a theremin crossed with a stuffed
26:11
badger okay
26:13
sure it's not in mass production i think
26:16
there may only be one of these things
26:18
where did you see it i saw it on the
26:20
internet
26:22
theremin was an amazing guy um he
26:25
invented
26:26
a loads of really cool stuff um
26:29
he invented a technique called interlace
26:31
um which improves the quality of a tv
26:34
signal which is still used in tvs today
26:36
wow it stops it from flickering uh he
26:39
also invented a thing called
26:40
the thing um and it was
26:43
a it was a seal an american seal not a
26:46
animal seal but um a seal of the united
26:49
states
26:49
and there was a eavesdropping device
26:52
inside it
26:53
and it hung for seven years in plain
26:56
view on the us ambassadors moscow office
26:58
and they managed to listen into
27:00
everything that was said for seven years
27:02
until he was accidentally discovered by
27:04
some british guy i think
27:06
but this technology that he used in it
27:08
was amazing it's called rfid
27:10
radio frequency identification and it's
27:12
the kind of stuff you use in oyster
27:14
cards
27:15
or contactless or say you have
27:18
a key card to get into a hotel room it's
27:21
that technology which he invented
27:23
oh wow originally for spain he
27:26
eventually vanished didn't he i think he
27:27
got taken away by the soviets one night
27:29
in 1938
27:38
what did you think this badger was next
27:39
to her
27:43
[Music]
27:47
okay it is time for our final fact of
27:49
the show and that is
27:51
chozinski my fact this week is that
27:53
lemurs and lorises
27:55
like their liquor as strong as possible
27:58
um and this is from a new study that's
28:00
just been done and it was a study that
28:02
was done on the slo loris
28:03
and the ii lima and they
28:06
found that if you give them a range of
28:09
alcoholic drinks that differ in their
28:11
alcohol content
28:12
they always go for the strongest one and
28:14
in fact they'll have twice as much of
28:15
the strong alcohol
28:17
uh as the rest do you feel an affinity
28:19
to these animals anna
28:21
i i always did you know the solaris is
28:23
so adorable and people often say the
28:24
same about me
28:25
[Laughter]
28:28
it's about five percent yeah the highest
28:30
okay okay so it's like getting stellar
28:32
instead of curling
28:33
precisely yeah it's just the more
28:35
alcohol the better
28:36
yeah and we don't know why because you
28:38
would have thought it would put you at a
28:39
disadvantage because
28:40
you once you get drunk then your motor
28:42
response is are damaged
28:44
and your concentration isn't as good and
28:46
you just thought you're easy prey
28:47
but on the other hand then you get
28:48
calories from alcohol so it seems like
28:51
they've developed uh evolved a tolerance
28:53
for alcohol over
28:54
the years yeah they don't get that drunk
28:56
do they they certainly didn't in this
28:58
experiment no
28:59
it's interesting how many animals uh
29:01
like alcohol
29:02
which even insects i was reading a
29:04
report about um entomologists often use
29:07
beer as bait for moths and butterflies
29:10
when they want to capture them for
29:11
something yeah so
29:12
flies love alcohol as well sorry just
29:14
don't insect fruit flies go nuts for it
29:16
and they
29:16
actively get regularly drink until
29:18
they're drunk and um
29:19
they'll be wobbling around and they
29:21
won't be able to fly properly
29:23
i did read an article about them though
29:24
that um said that
29:26
males who have um not mated are more
29:29
likely to get drunk than the males who
29:30
have mated
29:32
flies certainly true in my experience
29:34
it's males who have been rejected they
29:36
drown their sorrows yeah all right
29:39
let's not go on about it and also fruit
29:41
flies that get drunk
29:42
but they massively lower their standards
29:44
so when they're mating they'll suddenly
29:45
mate with anything so as soon as the
29:47
fruit fly gets a bit pissed it starts
29:48
trying to make with fruit flies of its
29:49
own can we just move on from
29:54
uh so the slow loris is just about the
29:57
only
29:58
venomous mammal as in it bites you
30:01
and it transfers venom to you as opposed
30:04
to poisonous wear
30:05
if you eat it you get poisoned yeah um
30:07
so it's really odd though because it
30:09
keeps its venom in an elbow patch
30:10
yeah and to poison you it has to lick
30:13
the inside of its elbow where it's got
30:14
these glands
30:15
and it secretes the poison from there
30:17
and then it's got the venom
30:18
in its mouth and then it swirls it round
30:21
in its mouth with its own saliva and
30:22
that
30:23
activates the venom making it really
30:25
dangerous
30:26
it's only they've only killed one person
30:27
documented in medical literature
30:29
and that was someone who went into
30:30
anaphylaxis wasn't it yeah exactly
30:32
and there are all these videos of them
30:34
online being tickled and it's supposedly
30:35
really adorable what they're actually
30:37
doing is lifting up their arms
30:38
to try and get to their venom plants so
30:41
what i was going to say if you're going
30:42
to put a venom gland anywhere don't put
30:43
it on your elbow which is famously the
30:45
bit that's hardest to lift in the whole
30:47
body i don't know it's a really good
30:48
point that sounds like a funny joke from
30:50
god
30:52
at the slow loris's expense
30:55
do you know the gentle lima is one of
30:56
the most aggressive lemurs
31:01
it's weird it's just based on a weird
31:03
etymological thing where it was
31:05
uh it looked a little bit like um a
31:07
marmoset whose name was happali and
31:09
happali means gentle and so it was
31:11
called the gentlelima it's actually a
31:12
complete bastard
31:13
in captivity they're really vicious what
31:16
do they do like what levels of
31:17
viciousness
31:18
they'll keep your car yeah you let them
31:20
get near your car they'll keep it
31:23
i'll just be rude online yeah
31:27
trolling yeah
31:31
okay that's it that's all of our facts
31:33

hello
00:11
and welcome to another episode of no
00:13
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:15
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:17
covent garden
00:18
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
00:20
here with anna chazinski
00:22
and miller and james harkin and once
00:24
again we have gathered around the
00:26
microphones with our four favorite facts
00:28
from the last seven days
00:29
and in no particular order here we go
00:32
starting this week with my fact my fact
00:35
is that the olympics used to have a race
00:39
just for old ladies exclusively for old
00:43
ladies called the old ladies race or old
00:45
women racing
00:46
and they didn't put much thought into
00:47
the name did they it wasn't yeah
00:49
the wrong seal approach there was a
00:51
fuller name actually where it said old
00:53
ladies racing for a pound of tea
00:55
that sounds much better i'd watch that
00:57
one well no it turns out it might you
00:59
might as well be saying
01:00
um men doing the 100 meter sprint for a
01:04
gold medal because the pound of tea was
01:06
the prize it wasn't
01:07
it wasn't like rehand racing where it's
01:08
on a string but they did get it right
01:10
they got the panda t yeah we should
01:12
quickly say that this is not what we all
01:14
perceive as the kind of
01:15
uh the modern olympics the olympics that
01:17
are going on in rio right now
01:19
uh what this is is a much older version
01:21
of the olympics that started in the
01:23
place called much wenlock
01:24
and uh this was back in the 1800s this
01:27
was
01:28
way way before the modern olympics
01:29
started again in athens and
01:31
one of the races was this it wasn't that
01:32
much before was it because it was it not
01:34
that
01:35
um the kubertan who started the modern
01:37
olympics visited much wenmark and it
01:39
kind of gave him a bit of the idea
01:40
yes he actually credited um william
01:43
penny brooks who was the guy who set up
01:44
the match one not games as
01:46
the originator of the olympics so even
01:48
though everyone thinks of de coopertown
01:49
as being the guy who brought us a modern
01:50
olympics he said no it was this chat
01:52
ah good on him yeah and uh he also
01:56
they basically wanted to get him over at
01:58
a time to actually see the olympics in
01:59
full flow
02:00
in much wenlock but they ran out of time
02:02
he couldn't get over so they just had to
02:03
put on a few events when he eventually
02:05
visited just as an example of what it
02:07
looks like
02:08
is that what the hastily improvised old
02:10
ladies race was
02:12
the only people who weren't at work that
02:14
day
02:15
yeah exactly i have to take issue with
02:17
that race because do you know how old
02:18
the old ladies
02:19
were go on i mean it's over 40s
02:23
over 40s yeah anyone over 40 is an old
02:26
lady
02:26
you're not thinking in terms of it's
02:29
like dog years with athletes
02:31
so michael jordan retired from
02:33
basketball for the first time at 30.
02:35
yeah technically if you're in your 40s
02:37
you are a sports old person according to
02:39
the sports
02:40
according to sports by sports rules and
02:42
by 19th century rules life expectancy's
02:44
shorter even so
02:45
it hurts as someone who's only a decade
02:47
off being 40 to read old ladies
02:49
referring to 40 year olds
02:51
yeah not that far off it's not i'm
02:54
knocking on the door i'm only 25 of
02:56
course
02:57
to the nearest 25 i'm still 25. you're
02:59
halfway there then
03:01
yeah but yeah so the uh in 1856
03:04
uh the race that you're talking about
03:06
the winner 45 year old winner
03:08
mary speak uh and she uh defeated the
03:11
person
03:11
in second place who was a 38 year old
03:13
called anne meredith
03:15
wait a minute hang on she's another 40.
03:17
how did she sneak in was it not even
03:19
no no it wasn't over 40s it was just
03:21
people who look a bit rough
03:24
she didn't even win yes came second she
03:27
got beat by a 45 year old yeah it's
03:29
embarrassing
03:30
wow 38 yeah so i found this fact
03:33
in uh this month's issue of the fortion
03:35
times and there's an amazing article by
03:37
a guy called rob gandy called faster
03:39
higher stronger weirder all about the
03:40
much wenlock olympics that sounds like a
03:42
great daft punk song doesn't it
03:45
faster higher stronger they were so they
03:47
were pretty
03:48
weird a lot of the contests at those
03:50
olympics weren't they and it grew out of
03:52
something which wasn't
03:53
which wasn't supposed to be specifically
03:55
sport so it was actually set up as more
03:56
of an educational thing
03:58
and so in the 1950s when the much one
04:00
not games were happening
04:01
a lot of the races or competitions were
04:04
things like essay writing
04:06
um or poetry or art oh i always thought
04:09
it was bad at sport
04:10
no yeah
04:14
the other rt events that happened there
04:15
there was uh there was best odes
04:18
you could enter the best odes
04:19
competition um
04:21
glee singing that was one as well ahead
04:23
of their time
04:24
yeah what you just sing don't stop
04:26
believing
04:27
exactly don't stop believing hadn't been
04:29
invented yet so they had to provide you
04:31
an ode
04:31
yeah yeah yeah really enthusiastic ode
04:35
in a group uh knitting was another one
04:38
and then knitting stockings was another
04:40
one
04:50
could you enter your knitted stockings
04:52
into both of those compositions
04:55
the knitting and the stockings knitting
04:56
or was it all knitting except stockings
04:58
allowed knitting i don't know if they
05:00
were accepting finished knitwear you
05:01
know what if they're allowing 38 year
05:03
olds in the
05:03
40s race i think they're not sticklers
05:06
for the rules
05:08
um just because james has just mentioned
05:10
the word stickle so there was another
05:12
kind of olympic games that preceded
05:13
these olympic games and they were
05:15
actually the cotswold olympics
05:16
which started either in 1622 or 1612. we
05:20
aren't quite sure
05:21
but um i was reading that the cotswold
05:23
olympics which had various weird sports
05:25
like shin kicking
05:26
they got that weird i'm from lancashire
05:28
we do that all right traditions
05:30
sorry but in barrels yeah yeah how do
05:32
you catch each other's shins when you're
05:34
in barrels
05:35
you're in the same barrel oh you're in
05:36
the same barrel
05:40
dan just brings his own barrel and sits
05:41
in it alone no one will kick me
05:45
but anyway the umpire of these
05:47
mainstream serious sports like shin
05:49
kicking
05:50
was called the stickler and i think
05:51
there's a theory that maybe he was
05:52
called the stickler because he
05:53
held a staff or it might just come from
05:55
another old english word
05:56
but that's where we get stickler when we
05:58
say he's a stickler for the rules it
05:59
comes from that umpire they were quite
06:01
violent as well these contests there was
06:03
once a sword fight between sir german
06:05
pool
06:06
and mr hutchinson and mr hutchinson lost
06:09
three of his fingers before he'd even
06:10
drawn his sword
06:12
and then he responded by slicing off
06:14
paul's nose
06:15
and pocketing it so it couldn't be
06:18
reattached
06:20
we've got an hour to reattach it oh it's
06:22
in the guy's pocket
06:23
it's gone that's as good as gone but
06:25
it's still going it's this year they
06:26
just in july they just did the hundred
06:28
and thirtieth
06:29
much one lock okay yes and it's still
06:31
got interesting events i looked through
06:33
the events that were
06:34
uh done this year uh golf was one so
06:37
golf's just joining isn't it the
06:38
olympics it's just turning the olympics
06:40
yeah
06:40
um gliding was one oh yeah it's a
06:43
gliding event
06:44
i reckon they're not going to have
06:45
professional golfers there are they
06:47
doubt it so i wonder how good i'd have
06:49
to get yes
06:50
and anyone can enter james you could
06:52
genuinely enter the golfing tournament
06:54
with an olympic medal yeah well and if
06:56
there's still i don't know
06:57
knitting and poetry and odes there's
07:00
more going for the writing rather than
07:02
the odds but i can give it a go
07:03
you just need to speak the writing
07:04
that's all the odors i stick to
07:06
shinkansen
07:08
yeah then you can go and bring your own
07:09
barrel no one will kick you
07:13
i'll bring my own barrel but i'll just
07:15
be a spectator
07:18
um old ladies
07:22
given eight more years i'm not risking
07:24
second place
07:26
um should we move on shortly um so of
07:29
when luck do you remember
07:30
the really horrible london olympic
07:31
mascots when locked up
07:33
like a big eye on a tv remote um they
07:35
were made by hornby who make the train
07:37
set and apparently wiped a third off
07:38
their value because they did so badly
07:40
really of the company i think it was at
07:42
one point because they um
07:44
sold so poorly that they had to issue a
07:46
profits warning and their stocks went
07:48
way down
07:48
wow uh i've got some stuff on modern day
07:51
old ladies running okay
07:55
so the world record for the 100 meter
07:58
dash
07:59
for people over the age of 100 or women
08:01
over the age of 100 um has just been
08:03
beaten
08:05
by a south carolina middle school
08:07
teacher called ella mae
08:08
colbert and she beat the record in
08:13
46.791 seconds or 100 meters
08:16
she came very far behind the other
08:17
competitors but because she was
08:19
older she's in a different category so
08:20
she broke the record for her age group
08:22
even though she didn't do it
08:23
oh really so she was there racing with
08:25
everyone 20 something
08:27
people who were doing it
08:29
[Laughter]
08:32
it was tyson gay usain bolt of this lady
08:35
[Laughter]
08:37
yeah it was uh one week after
08:39
celebrating her 100th birthday that she
08:41
did that
08:42
um so the there's a guy called fuja
08:45
singh
08:46
who i think is one of our greatest
08:48
athletes in the uk
08:49
um he holds the uk records for the 200
08:52
meters 400 meters 800 meters
08:54
mile and 3000 meters for the over 100s
08:59
and he set all of those records within a
09:02
single 94 minute period
09:06
and he once um saw their uk records and
09:09
he also once set
09:10
five world records in his age group in a
09:12
single day
09:14
and some of the events that he got the
09:15
world record for they didn't have a
09:17
record holder because no one over the
09:18
age of 100 had never even attempted them
09:21
wow that's pretty good that sort of puts
09:23
your old lady to shame a bit doesn't it
09:26
what my oh yes don't talk about my wife
09:35
okay it is time for fact number two and
09:37
that is
09:38
anne my fact is that there was a
09:40
victorian comic song that was called
09:42
tony blair
09:45
and it goes i can't find it oh really
09:47
yeah no we don't know how it goes if
09:48
anyone listening knows
09:50
the song or has a sheet music please do
09:51
send it in there could be an olympic
09:52
medal in that
09:53
yes we bring back dan's odds challenges
09:56
yeah
09:57
so i found this on the bbc's 10 things
09:59
we learned this week which is a great
10:00
feature they do
10:01
every seven days and it was by a guy
10:03
called jeremy clay who's on twitter at
10:05
ludicrous scenes who writes this column
10:07
for them called victorian strangeness
10:09
so we checked out online on the
10:11
newspaper archive and this is a report
10:12
from the croydon advertiser and east
10:15
story reporter october 1879
10:17
of a performance by a group called the
10:19
black diamonds and
10:20
it followed a performance of a song that
10:22
was called b-r-o-w-n
10:24
which i like to think is gordon brown's
10:26
version of r-a-s-p-e-c-t
10:29
and v-r-o-w-n uh quote excited much
10:32
laughter
10:33
as did mr harrison's rendering of tony
10:35
blair
10:36
wow i would really like to see gordon
10:38
brown dancing and singing our
10:39
arias pct but to be our own do you think
10:42
we could make that happen
10:43
there's a lack of letters in his name
10:46
isn't it so he's not going to scan he
10:47
could do it to the song d-i-s-c-o
10:49
couldn't he or you could spread the w
10:53
into three syllables that
10:54
just kind of worked yeah w-n p-r-g
10:58
why his advisors weren't making him
10:59
explore this option at the time of his
11:02
tenure yeah that's hilarious it was
11:04
definitely real
11:05
yeah it basically is very popular around
11:08
the 1880s
11:08
in 1887 it um was performed in north
11:11
devon to a show that was so densely
11:12
crowded
11:13
that large numbers of people were unable
11:14
to obtain admittance really
11:16
although that show also contained a
11:18
procession of firefighters handsome men
11:19
from ilfracombe and their horse-drawn
11:21
carriage so i don't know which was
11:23
drawing them in i reckon the handsome
11:26
member
11:28
there was also a song called um when she
11:30
comes with the milk in the morning
11:31
also a highlight according to the local
11:32
paper and what's great actually about
11:34
that report
11:35
is that um so it's kind of a whole
11:36
evening of revelry and
11:38
the paper recorded some of the jokes
11:39
from the evening would you like to hear
11:41
some saturday from 1887.
11:42
oh yes yeah why does mr pitt lewis
11:45
resemble a shrimp
11:47
i don't know why does mr pitt louis
11:49
resemble a shrimp because each has mp at
11:51
the end of his name
11:54
it's like andy's in the room
11:57
and andy's edinburgh show is currently
11:59
going on at the pleasants theater
12:03
wow and that is i mean it's not funny
12:05
but it's
12:06
it is a joke but it's satirical
12:10
um what does donald trump have in common
12:13
with a shrimp
12:15
pink is it the mp thing it is it's like
12:19
andy's still in the room
12:21
so in 1877 a 10 year old david cameron
12:24
fell into the harbor in dundee he was
12:25
rescued and taken home
12:27

12:42

12:46
the uh peterson has become prime
12:48

you about mr j
13:00
corbin ran corbin's british baking
13:04
powder the cheapest and the best
13:06
wow found that in the paper dairy
13:08
journal 1892 james harkin has opened a
13:10
new wine and spirit bar in the long
13:12
tower
13:12
liquors of the best quality all within
13:14
stock sounds right classic
13:16
and you were killed in 1896. oh you were
13:18
a keeper uh
13:19
going to be in a case against poaching
13:21
can you witness you're about
13:23
wasn't that the year of the modern
13:24
olympics in greece yeah 1896.
13:27
uh um czechinski uh headlined instantly
13:30
for the bristol hippodrome this was a
13:31
great dancer he was coming from the
13:33
budapest royal opera house
13:34
that came in 1923. that was me it
13:37
contains a helpful pronunciation guide
13:38
to zuzinski in the article
13:41
[Laughter]
13:45
another kind of thing about names and
13:48
yeah similar names
13:49
uh if you go into wikipedia and search
13:50
for neil horan
13:52
um you get the message this article is
13:54
about the dancing layer-sized roman
13:56
catholic priest
13:58
for one direction member see niall horan
14:04
[Laughter]
14:12
that made me think about disambiguation
14:14
on wikipedia so
14:16
if you search for disambiguation you get
14:19
word sense disambiguation for other uses
14:22
see disambiguation disambiguation
14:26
that's very good so i did disambiguation
14:29
on tony blair
14:30
because i wanted to see are there any
14:32
other famous tony blairs out there
14:34
and i found my favorite tony blair it's
14:36
a high title
14:37
yeah awarded with great goodies and this
14:39
is interesting because it's not
14:41
a single person it's a lot of people
14:44
called tony blair it's t-o-n-i-b-l-e-r
14:48
tony blair and it's a male name that's
14:51
given out in kosovo
14:52
and it's because it's in it's in honor
14:54
of the fact that during the 1999 nato
14:57
air campaigns tony blair was seen as a
14:58
massive hero so they've created a name
15:00
now
15:01
with children now and now adults carry
15:04
i think christina has a big road called
15:07
bill clinton boulevard or something yeah
15:08
it does so i
15:09
lived in pristina for three months um
15:11
and everywhere you went
15:13
there was a picture of bill clinton but
15:15
interestingly so i then clicked onto
15:16
kosovo names for
15:17
um for male uh new male children names
15:21
uh and no bill clinton name so tony
15:23
blair
15:24
got given a name but they'll bill
15:26
clinton because bill got the boulevard
15:28
yeah yeah
15:28
tony blair okay can we go back to um the
15:31
songs yeah yeah so b-r-o-w-n
15:35
and tony blair were songs um i found a
15:38
website called
15:40
monologues.co.uk which has an enormous
15:42
list of
15:43
victorian and early 20th century music
15:46
hall songs
15:47
and they're just amazing so can i read
15:49
some out yeah please
15:51
don't stick it out like that
15:56
open your mouth and shut your eyes
16:01
taking a turn what about this one i'm a
16:03
member of the county council
16:08
that sounds like a great song doesn't it
16:09
yeah it could be the precursor to tony
16:12
blair mp
16:12
yeah and they bunged him in my group
16:17
[Laughter]
16:20
we're going to need that last word dan
16:22
can you grab the notes they bunged him
16:24
in my growler
16:28
so their words go they bunked him in my
16:30
growler
16:31
and i made the gg fly felt so gay sang
16:35
all the way to peckham right
16:36
they picked me up in the strand and i
16:38
drove him ever so far
16:40
the night i took the prodigal son home
16:42
to his dear mama
16:44
and that's they bunged him in my growler
16:47
beautiful song so they used to be yeah
16:50
really raunchy i think the idea of music
16:51
calls was supposed to be
16:53
partly that they would um be a kind of
16:55
entertainment for the working class but
16:57
the guy who sort of set them up and
16:58
started them off charles martin in the
16:59
uh
17:00
mid 19th century said that women should
17:02
be allowed to come because he thought it
17:04
meant people behave in a more
17:05
respectable manner what that actually
17:06
meant was
17:07
men just invited loads of prostitutes
17:09
and they were these
17:10
bawdy uh really really rowdy places and
17:13
yeah they'd have song books called
17:14
things like the frisky vocalist
17:16
and the gentleman's spicy songster but
17:19
they used to get
17:19
really violent so i think um in
17:23
in one performance there was evidence
17:25
that a dead cat was thrown at the
17:26
performers um
17:27
there'd be bottles and old old boots
17:29
with would be thrown at the singers
17:31
um their industrial towns favored
17:34
hurling iron rivets apparently
17:36
um and so much so that waiters in music
17:39
halls would have to have their
17:40
bottles that they served from chained to
17:42
their trays so that people didn't grab
17:43
the bottles and start fighting with them
17:45
and if there was an orchestra in the pit
17:47
sometimes it would be covered up with
17:48
the steel grille
17:49
so that the orchestra couldn't be
17:50
attacked wow yeah hardcore did it was
17:53
this only if they didn't enjoy it or did
17:55
they just do it anyway
17:56
i think everyone's pissed there are
17:57
prostitutes around you just get rowdy
17:59
it's not necessarily a negative or a
18:01
positive thing
18:02
imagine just like i'll bring the dead
18:04
cat just in place
18:07
it turns out to be a great gig you're
18:09
like that's a shame that's coming home
18:11
with me back in the bag
18:15
[Music]
18:19
okay it's time for fact number three and
18:21
that is pepe josinski
18:25
yeah my fact this week is that the first
18:27
president of the uk's women's institute
18:30
used a frying pan as a whip wore an
18:32
entire stuffed owl on her head
18:34
and officially named the city of
18:35
canberra it's a hell of a cv
18:38
yeah it's so impressive so i didn't know
18:40
anything about this woman but she was
18:41
lady gertrude denman
18:43
and she was this eccentric english woman
18:45
who
18:46
just achieved an extraordinary amount in
18:48
her life so she started
18:50
she became president of the national
18:52
federation of women's institutes in 1917
18:54
and she held that post until 1946
18:57
and um yeah she was just this this great
19:00
force of a woman
19:01
so the reason that she named the city of
19:03
canberra was that she
19:05
married the man who went on to become
19:06
the governor of australia so they moved
19:08
out to australia
19:09
and it was decided that she would be the
19:11
one who opened this little golden casket
19:13
which contained the name
19:15
that had been chosen for the city so
19:16
someone else came up with the idea but
19:18
she was one who chose it
19:19
so she was yeah she was the official
19:21
neymar so did you know that australia
19:22
had a king
19:23
o'malley so it was in 1911 there was a
19:26
competition to design the new capital
19:28
they were going with the working title
19:29
federal capital city but then two years
19:31
later
19:32
king decided to suggest people's um in
19:34
parliament put forward names for it
19:36
they had 39 suggestions which included
19:38
eden hopeton aurora
19:40
home unison andy mann flinders and
19:42
fraser roo
19:44
i also heard kangamu yeah right is that
19:46
one of them
19:47
yeah they wanted to call it after some
19:48
of their animals so they also suggested
19:50
kookaburra and marsupiala
19:52
um although there were so many good
19:54
suggestions actually for the name of
19:56
canberra i think
19:57
my favorites are things like buncombe
19:59
and bung town
20:00
are there and gone broke one suggestion
20:03
was climax
20:04
it could have been called climax um but
20:07
the one that comes up a lot is the name
20:09
sid mel out per bristo which is
20:11
obviously a hyphenated combination of
20:13
sydney melbourne adelaide perth
20:15
and hobart they thought they'd combine
20:16
them all that's such an interesting
20:18
idea um she sounds like an amazing
20:21
character
20:21
uh according to one uh description of
20:24
her i read
20:24
she was a compulsive lumberjack
20:27
compulsive does that mean that you
20:29
literally can't walk past the tree
20:31
without chopping it down
20:32
when she was riding the horses and
20:34
whipping them with uh the frying pan
20:37
they just say that she couldn't pass a
20:38
tree without chopping it down
20:40
yeah she had the knacks on her at all
20:42
times it's a very interesting character
20:44
her dad was called uh wheatman
20:48
w-e-e-t-m-a-n that's the first name so
20:50
let's get that going again
20:51
i'm gonna make my first son there okay
20:54
another one second one tony blair
20:55
yes um just some other good things lady
20:57
denman did when she came to australia
20:59
she sort of created waves everyone
21:00
thought she was really really cool
21:02
and she didn't act really up herself
21:04
like um former kind of governors
21:06
had and she did things like um she
21:09
played golf down the corridors of her
21:11
house so she would uh put cushions out
21:13
and they would be the holes i think and
21:14
then she'd play golf towards
21:16
them um she wrote a letter to her
21:17
brother explaining how she did a lot of
21:19
lumberjacking
21:20
um and a lot of shooting and she also
21:22
played hockey in the ballroom
21:24
and then she said in the letter this
21:25
last amusement must on no account be
21:27
mentioned
21:28
yeah she was a massive aristocrat though
21:30
wasn't she like she was born into a
21:31
really really wealthy oh she was born
21:33
super privileged yeah but so it's all
21:35
right when you're like that and you can
21:36
just wear it out on your head and play
21:38
hockey down the street
21:39
working-class people couldn't afford
21:41
stuff down no they couldn't even afford
21:43
a barrel each year
21:47
so a lot of the information that i'm
21:48
talking about here about the wi and
21:49
about lady denim comes from this great
21:51
book called a force to be reckoned with
21:52
by jane robinson
21:54
do you know that um during world war one
21:56
the event fleet had women members out
21:57
patrolling and after the war they
21:59
cancelled it so the boys were back
22:00
giving back their jobs and the wi did a
22:01
26 year campaign
22:03
to get them back and they didn't wow 26
22:05
years they just waited for the next one
22:07
to start
22:08
it was during world war ii they came
22:10
back i think that's brilliant i didn't
22:11
know they took them away
22:12
yeah and also good on the wi yeah yeah
22:15
during the second world war um meetings
22:17
might include something called a pin the
22:19
mustache on a hitler competition
22:21
or the passing around of a lemon um with
22:24
a penny buying you a sniff
22:26
what what it was a different time it was
22:29
there wasn't a lot to do
22:31
for a second one of james's musical
22:32
songs i'll give you a sniff of my lemons
22:36
what i really like as well is they're
22:37
really they've got tons of branches and
22:39
there's lots of different ways of doing
22:40
it so i completely am keen on this one
22:41
this is gothic valley at wi branson
22:43
north london
22:44
and uh they are goth brand to the wi but
22:46
they welcome non-goths
22:47
and according to the website they like
22:49
baking jam making crafting and wearing
22:50
lots of black
22:52
and then they also say come and join us
22:54
help put the black and blackberry jam
22:56
okay i think they sound awesome yeah
22:58
that sounds great speaking of jam
23:00
actually the reason that i
23:01
found this fact is that there was a
23:03
police commissioner recently who
23:05
announced that the wi
23:06
is the largest organized crime group in
23:08
the uk because it's actually illegal to
23:11
pick wild berries and sell them for
23:12
profit
23:13
and the wi uh not only does that but
23:15
encourages its members to do that
23:17
because they pick berries and then sell
23:18
their jam at fates is that really
23:20
illegal
23:21
apparently that's illegal according to
23:22
him yeah it was a real nice story how in
23:24
world war one the home guard needed
23:26
wood and so they came around and they
23:27
chopped the legs off um the piano that
23:29
was
23:30
[Laughter]
23:31
chopped the legs of every single member
23:33
of a wi
23:34
one of these guys must have a wooden leg
23:39
the wi members retained their legs but
23:41
the home guard chopped their legs off
23:42
one of their pianos and then at
23:44
future wi meetings in the area where
23:46
that happened the women still continue
23:47
to sing jerusalem and the
23:49
is just lay on the floor playing the
23:50
piano another contemporary wr is the
23:54
seven hills wi in sheffield
23:55
uh their average age of their members is
23:57
34 and their speakers have included the
23:59
tour manager for the arctic monkeys
24:02
it's cool something for everyone they do
24:04
all the things as we walked in today
24:06
anna you said i'm thinking of joining
24:07
the wi now
24:08
i think that i will and they were so
24:12
influential
24:12
so they they were really a big deal
24:14
especially in the early days i really
24:16
like um
24:16
i was reading a story about a guy so
24:18
they do do a lot of talks they get
24:19
people to come in and talk
24:21
and um they got a man to come in who was
24:24
a retired sailor from north devon
24:26
and they wanted to talk to him about his
24:28
experiences
24:29
so basically he wrote a book about being
24:31
kidnapped by pirates
24:32
and uh he thought i'll go and do a talk
24:34
start doing talks and they booked him
24:36
but this is what he said when i arrived
24:38
there there were ladies with blue
24:40
rinsers wearing pirate hats and waving
24:42
swords around
24:43
they'd been led to believe that it was a
24:45
talk about piracy through the ages and
24:47
not something
24:48
right up to date so basically a man
24:50
who'd been held for 47 days
24:52
to tell about his traumatic experience
24:55
you could see a photo he took a photo
24:56
with them
24:57
they've got the you know the skull and
24:58
crossbones that kind of weird captain
25:00
crunch hat
25:01
because back in their day that's how
25:03
pirates looks
25:05
didn't they um famously boo off tony
25:08
blair or something they
25:09
slay they watched it today it's amazing
25:12
they didn't want any party politics and
25:14
it's a huge haul for them they thought
25:15
it was a musical song
25:20
[Laughter]
25:21
[Applause]
25:23
also as per your 100 year old
25:26
runner that could just be the speed at
25:29
which older people
25:32
and if he hadn't left the stage he would
25:33
have realized 20 minutes later they were
25:35
actually giving him a standing ovation
25:38
it's just taking a while to get there
25:42
[Music]
25:45
[Applause]
25:46
[Music]
25:47
okay it is time for a final fact of the
25:49
show and that is
25:51
james okay my fact this week is that you
25:53
can make yourself
25:54
more attractive to members of the
25:56
opposite sex by giving them a magnet
26:00
how powerful a magnet
26:04
so this is a controversial bit of
26:07
science called social priming
26:09
not everyone believes it's real but
26:11
there was a recent study
26:13
at texas a m university where
26:15
participants were given a couple of
26:16
attracting
26:18
blocks to play with and some others were
26:20
given ones that weren't magnetic
26:21
and then they questioned them about
26:24
their relationship
26:25
and they found that the ones who have
26:26
been given the magnets were more
26:27
positive about their relationships
26:29
and found the people there with more
26:31
attractive and basically social priming
26:34
is the idea that you can mention things
26:37
and it will affect the way people behave
26:40
so there's a very famous
26:41
study where they gave people words to do
26:43
with old age
26:45
and then as they left the building they
26:47
walked slower
26:48
now that study is very controversial
26:50
because people have tried to replicate
26:52
it and they've not been able to but this
26:53
whole idea of social priming
26:55
is a thing that people are currently
26:57
studying so
26:59
the fact that this fact your fact is
27:01
sort of about how uh the
27:02
things we speak about metaphorically can
27:04
actually affect how we feel
27:06
so it's thought that the reason that you
27:07
are more attracted to someone when
27:09
they're holding a magnet
27:10
is because we talk about magnetism i'm
27:12
magnetically attracted to him
27:13
and that metaphor that we've used has
27:15
actually seems to have made its way into
27:17
now how we instinctively respond and
27:19
there are other uh instances of this
27:21
happening
27:22
so with the word sweet uh it was shown
27:24
that you know we refer to people as
27:26
being
27:26
sweet people um and there was an
27:29
experiment that was done where
27:30
students were asked to write either
27:32
about their experience of romantic love
27:34
or about an experience of being jealous
27:35
or just about a neutral experience and
27:37
then after that they were given in one
27:38
experiment they were given sweets and
27:40
then in another experiment they were
27:41
just given tap water
27:42
and in both cases the students who've
27:45
written about romantic love found the
27:47
sweets
27:47
and the tap water tasted sweeter because
27:50
it's thought kind of
27:51
they'd written about something that they
27:52
considered a sweet topic yeah like a
27:54
happy mood to start with
27:56
yeah it's so interesting do you have
27:57
another one well i just thought this was
27:59
really weird because
28:00
the reverse seems to be true with sweet
28:01
stuff as well there was this study done
28:03
in 2011
28:05
which showed that people who like sweet
28:08
stuff
28:08
are just sweeter people as in nicer
28:11
people so
28:12
this was published in the journal of
28:13
personality and social psychology and
28:16
uh it found that people who said that
28:18
they preferred they had a sweet tooth
28:19
were more likely to help someone out so
28:21
there was a professor who wanted help
28:22
with doing a study they were more likely
28:24
to help him out
28:24
they were more likely to help clear up
28:26
sandbags after stopping a flood
28:28
and just they like sweet food and there
28:30
seemed to be this correlation which
28:31
obviously sounds very dubious
28:33
i might get sweet for this yeah yeah
28:36
like crunchy bar
28:37
yeah great theory like people give you
28:40
tendering biscuits when you help out
28:41
such a good point
28:42
it does sound um so i i was reading also
28:46
uh examples of where psychologically
28:48
they think that the opposite of sex can
28:49
make themselves more attractive so in
28:51
this case how a man can become more
28:52
attractive to a woman
28:53
uh one suggestion that they've said why
28:55
don't you try this
28:57
is to wear a t-shirt a white t-shirt
28:59
with a big
29:00
t printed on it just the big letter t
29:03
and the reason that they say
29:04
is that women who see this shirt with
29:06
the tee on are 12
29:08
more attracted to this person women
29:10
always want a pound of tea don't they
29:11
we've already established that
29:13
women like tea yeah so what it is is
29:16
that they say that the top bar of the
29:17
tea
29:18
uh makes it so that it broadens the
29:20
shoulders of the person and then the bar
29:22
going down
29:23
slims uh the the body creating a
29:26
v-shaped body
29:27
so that's my interesting fact in order
29:29
to get a v you need to wear a tee
29:31
how cool is that this is good everyone
29:33
used to say to me by the way that raises
29:35
an interesting point um
29:36
because i usually wear a tie i'm always
29:39
i love wearing ties and
29:40
people have said to me that i'm directly
29:43
trying to draw attention to the crotch
29:45
that apparently uh an arrow pointing
29:47
downwards as a child
29:48
i'd never heard that before well it's
29:49
just because you have written on your
29:51
thai penis this way
29:54
really inappropriate for the workplace
29:55
and we talked about this
29:58
so the uh science of dating is
30:00
interesting i found one piece which
30:01
concluded uh the key
30:03
the key to dating someone hotter than
30:04
you get to know them first which is a
30:06
really
30:06
a good tip oh thanks guys um and another
30:10
one that said uh
30:11
sexually aroused by farts you're not
30:13
alone so scientists are doing scientists
30:16
to do some weird studies
30:18
um so there's a study done in 2010 which
30:20
is kind of depressing but it's
30:21
interesting that it's still
30:22
this is still the case and what it did
30:25
was it put
30:26
a man in a high status car and then the
30:29
same man
30:30
in a low status car so there was a man
30:33
in a silver bentley continental gt which
30:35
i believe
30:36
is an expensive car and then that man
30:37
was also put in a red ford fiesta
30:39
and it found that when women are asked
30:41
if the man is attractive
30:42
they're much more likely to think he's
30:44
attractive if he's in the high status
30:45
car
30:46
but in the reverse way round when the
30:47
woman is in the high status car compared
30:49
to being in the normal
30:50
car then men do not find women any more
30:52
attractive when they're in a high status
30:53
car
30:54
because traditionally for thousands of
30:56
years women have been attracted to men
30:57
who can provide cars
31:00
that's why fred flintstone was so
31:01
popular with the ladies
31:03
yeah i read an article which said that
31:05
89 of uk
31:07
men think that a flashy car helps them
31:09
with women
31:10
but only 41 of women think that that's
31:13
true
31:14
but that's i guess not um they're not
31:16
testing it out in a blind way are they
31:18
they're just asking you what you think
31:20
yeah so women we don't think we're
31:21
attracted to only rich men but it turns
31:23
out we're all extremely shallow
31:25
and that is the case it's interesting
31:27
it's just you know men have been the
31:29
providers traditionally so it must be
31:31
something that's so deeply ingrained now
31:32
for a lot of women
31:33
that you want someone who you know can
31:35
provide for you even though
31:36
consciously we definitely don't feel
31:38
like that's what we want
31:39
i have one more thing which is the good
31:41
news is uh beer does make you more
31:43
attractive
31:43
the bad news is it's to mosquitoes
31:45
carrying malaria
31:48
and that is like this
31:51
uh we need to wrap up soon um we haven't
31:53
done any magnet stuff has anyone got
31:55
anything
31:55
just magnety i was reading a report from
31:57
the royal society of medicine from 2005
31:59
which was called painful attraction
32:01
a magnetic penile injury and it was
32:04
describing it sounded terrific but i did
32:06
find it quite amusing
32:07
it was describing an 11 year old boy
32:09
who'd arrived in a e
32:10
with two magnets stuck on either side of
32:13
of his penis and they couldn't get it
32:15
off so we'd actually been referred to
32:16
this hospital from another hospital we
32:18
hadn't that hadn't been able to get
32:19
these two magnets off
32:20
um and the report said that it was
32:22
impossible to remove the magnets either
32:24
by hand or by surgical clamps
32:26
i've read this paper i think actually
32:27
and um i
32:29
think that um they just kind of did some
32:32
sheer force didn't they so they pulled
32:33
them sideways
32:34
they eventually did that yeah but they
32:36
did sound i've distributed the idea that
32:37
he was overhearing them discussing their
32:39
next options it said in the report
32:40
there are two other ways of dealing with
32:42
this usually with two magnets that are
32:44
stuck together
32:45
one is to heat the magnet above the
32:46
curie point which is the point at which
32:48
they lose magnets
32:49
isn't that like about 1000 degrees or
32:51
something it's about 500 degrees celsius
32:53
for the average toy magnet
32:54
and the other one is to apply heavy
32:56
hammering so you're gonna punch this
32:58
point lying there going
33:00
oh god that's extraordinary what would
33:02
you go for damn would you go for the um
33:05
the 500 degree heat or the intense
33:07
hammering
33:09
or would you just think actually they
33:11
don't look so bad
33:13
that's exactly what i said you know i'm
33:15
cool wait
33:16
wait would that make you more attractive
33:18
to the opposite side they'd be like
33:20
magnetic um the the strongest magnets in
33:22
the world i think
33:24
are in america's national high magnetic
33:26
field laboratory
33:28
uh in tallahassee they're electromagnets
33:30
and
33:31
this facility uses um seven percent of
33:34
all the electricity used in the whole
33:35
city of tallahassee
33:37
whoa it's absolutely massive and if you
33:39
want to do any magnetic stuff
33:41
pretty much anywhere in the world this
33:42
is where you go and the big sign on the
33:44
wall saying do not put on your penis
33:47
penis not this way
33:54
okay that's it that's all of our facts
33:56
thank you so much for listening

[Applause]
00:14
hello
00:15
and welcome to another episode of no
00:17
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:19
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:21
covent garden
00:22
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
00:24
here with anna chazinski
00:25
alex bell and james harkin and once
00:28
again we have gathered around the
00:29
microphones with our four favorite facts
00:31
from the last seven days
00:33
and in no particular order here we go
00:36
starting with you
00:37
alex my fact this week is that this
00:39
episode of no such thing as a fish
00:41
is going to the moon
00:45
that's a bold claim mr bell it's
00:48
absolutely true
00:50
yeah how are we doing that basically a
00:52
couple of years ago i
00:53
contributed to a kickstarter campaign
00:55
for a probe a uk
00:57
lander to go land on the moon around
01:00
2024 they hope it's called lunar mission
01:02
one
01:03
and the idea is that they're going to
01:04
send it to the south pole of the moon
01:06
drill down 100 meters and take some rock
01:08
samples and do some science
01:09
but also it's going to leave a time
01:10
capsule there and in that time capsule
01:12
people who've donated to the kickstarter
01:14
campaign get a little bit of digital
01:15
space
01:16
and so i'm going to put this episode in
01:17
so are you doing that because you just
01:19
want to get this as far away from
01:21
all things in existence as possible yep
01:24
also we got drunk last night and dan had
01:26
the idea and i didn't really know how to
01:27
say no
01:28
we we got really drunk and i was like
01:30
we're definitely doing this
01:32
alex had all these plans of his family
01:34
portraits to go up to the moon
01:35
my legacy gone it's it's interesting
01:37
though because uh it's not going up for
01:39
another
01:40
eight years about i don't know the word
01:44
about 2024 either i've heard that before
01:46
in big projects
01:47
but it's it's an interesting kickstarter
01:49
because if they can pull this off it
01:51
actually just completely alters how we
01:52
can fund
01:53
universal travel basically i mean we
01:55
could who knows maybe we'll be able to
01:57
kickstart something to mars as well
01:58
yeah let's just try and get this podcast
02:00
further and further away from planet
02:01
earth
02:03
rescue human society um can i ask
02:06
because they're drilling down and it's
02:07
150 degrees celsius i think down there
02:09
um is it gonna be protected in some
02:11
capsule i don't know i guess so they
02:13
haven't yet told us how much space they
02:14
have or anything like that so
02:15
it's still pretty vague all the plans
02:17
god so it might we might have to just
02:18
recall a five minute podcast or
02:20
something we don't know how many
02:21
megabytes we just send a squarespace ad
02:26
do you know the first thing off the
02:27
internet that was sent to space uh
02:29
something off ebay
02:30
so close but even lamer it is it was a
02:33
bunch of craigslist adverts
02:35
really yeah so it was in 2005 and
02:37
craigslist the website which i'm not
02:39
sure is any longer in action
02:41
uh oh it is yeah james is a frequent
02:42
user um it sent
02:44
up about 138 000 ads i think craigslist
02:48
ads and you could just take a little box
02:49
that said
02:50
please beam this into space and they
02:51
beam them into space
02:53
this was sort of digital stuff encoded
02:55
onto
02:56
light yes exactly yeah yeah we're
02:58
sending the data out there
02:59
yeah so i was i was looking this up and
03:01
i found the reference on the craigslist
03:03
page
03:04
to it after it happened saying um that
03:07
they really wanted to remind people that
03:08
you could not cancel craigslist ads that
03:10
were beamed into space
03:12
or retrieve them so sorry guys
03:15
so actually there's gonna be loads of
03:16
pissed off aliens eventually coming
03:17
going you said you had a sofa
03:20
i was saying no i'm sorry i sold that
03:22
actually what independence day was the
03:24
fury of when they realized the sofa had
03:26
now been sold
03:27
they just demolished earth i don't
03:29
suppose light's the best thing to get
03:30
your message into space or is it they
03:32
think radio waves is the best
03:34
i think it was said by radio waves was
03:35
it yeah okay yeah yeah
03:37
so 2024 obviously quite a while away for
03:40
stuff uh for us to make it to the moon
03:42
um and i thought is that the closest
03:44
that was sending probes now but actually
03:46
there's a lot of probes that seem to be
03:47
set to go
03:48
the google lunar x prize has been
03:51
set up and the idea is that they want
03:53
someone to not only land on the moon
03:56
but travel 500 meters on the moon
03:59
because anyone could crash a thing into
04:01
the moon the idea is can you land
04:02
something on the moon and make it
04:03
functional and still move so they've set
04:05
up this idea of a prize and the prize is
04:07
30 million dollars
04:08
what's interesting though is that teams
04:10
have now realized that it's going to
04:12
cost them
04:13
way too much to get there on their own
04:15
so
04:16
a lot of them are pairing up now and
04:18
sending all of the vehicles
04:20
in one trip which means they're going to
04:22
land at the same time
04:23
and there's going to be a moon race to
04:25
see which is the first one to travel 500
04:28
meters
04:29
it's gonna be like a hunger game and as
04:30
soon as they land it's just gonna be
04:31
absolutely
04:32
all the robots are gonna turn on each
04:33
other yeah so it's gonna be more like
04:34
robot wars
04:37
i was reading of things that are already
04:39
on the moon
04:40
um i think we might have discussed a few
04:42
of them before but um we
04:44
as human beings have left 187
04:47
400 kilograms of material on the moon
04:50
and that's
04:50
almost exactly the same weight as a blue
04:52
whale really
04:53
that is actually much less than i would
04:55
have thought yeah the largest blue whale
04:57
that we've ever found was 176
04:59
000 but scientists think we'll find some
05:01
that are over 180
05:02
000. so basically what we could have
05:04
done is just taken one blue whale off
05:06
the earth put it on the moon and it
05:07
would have had the same effect i've
05:08
achieved exactly the same
05:10
the moon is officially metric and not
05:12
imperial just because you said kilograms
05:13
that reminded me
05:14
who decided that nasa decided i think
05:16
and then everyone else had to agree to
05:18
it but then given that there's only like
05:20
two countries in the world that are
05:21
still imperial and i think it's america
05:22
or something like liberia or something
05:25
yeah it would have been pretty weird to
05:26
go with theirs although maybe not
05:27
because it's nasa
05:28
you never know yeah the aliens might
05:29
land again and go why are these guys
05:31
using this metric system the imperial
05:32
makes much more sense
05:34
well the thing is like there's no reason
05:35
why the aliens would use anything like
05:37
metric in fact they wouldn't because
05:38
that's
05:39
metric is based on the size of the earth
05:41
or the meter is
05:42
yeah so really you want to do it on like
05:45
the width of a hydrogen atom or
05:47
something like that
05:48
something something that will be
05:49
universal yeah they might be measuring
05:50
it like according to the diameter
05:52
of their hands which are the size of
05:53
elephants or something because that's
05:55
the interesting species
05:56
of alien um you know i didn't know about
05:58
the fallen astronaut sculpture on the
06:01
moon
06:01
and that it's kind of a sad story so
06:04
this is one of the things that we've
06:05
left behind on the moon
06:06
is this sculpture called the fallen
06:07
astronaut and it was agreed that that
06:09
would be put on the moon
06:11
by this artist called paul van hoydonk
06:15
so he agreed with david scott who was on
06:18
the
06:19
1971 apollo mission that he would design
06:21
a sculpture
06:22
that david scott says was supposed to
06:23
represent all astronauts who had fallen
06:25
up until that point so any astronauts
06:26
who died trying to get to space or being
06:28
in space
06:29
and scott smuggled it into his pocket of
06:31
his spacesuit so nasa didn't know nobody
06:33
knew it was there
06:34
and scott went up to the moon and he got
06:36
got off the spacecraft
06:38
and one of his colleague astronauts
06:39
distracted the people down at mission
06:41
control apparently with banal
06:42
talk while he performed some kind of
06:44
little funeral ceremony
06:46
that's the worst kind of talk to
06:47
distract someone yeah
06:48
[Laughter]
06:52
you're right maybe just didn't have
06:53
scintillating talk in him
06:55
but anyway he put this thing on the moon
06:57
gave a little funeral ceremony for it
06:59
um and he'd lay it down and then came
07:02
back down and it was announced that this
07:03
is an hour on the moon
07:04
and this argument's ensued ever since
07:06
between the artist and
07:07
nasa because the artist says a it was
07:09
meant to be standing upright and it's
07:10
not
07:11
b it doesn't represent fallen astronauts
07:13
it represents
07:14
just humanity and see he says he never
07:17
agreed that he wouldn't make it a
07:18
commercial thing so we tried to sell a
07:20
whole bunch of them on earth and nasa
07:21
were like no
07:22
because i think you're not allowed to
07:23
commercialize stuff that you've taken to
07:24
the moon yeah so yeah it's kind of sad
07:26
this little sculpture on the moon
07:28
is supposed to represent humanity and
07:29
how great we are is now kind of a
07:30
testament to how we can't really agree
07:32
on anything
07:32
[Laughter]
07:34
i think it's weird how they always seem
07:36
to smuggle stuff into space when you
07:38
can't even get toothpaste onto an
07:39
aeroplane
07:40
do they not have that bit where you have
07:41
to empty your keys
07:44
[Laughter]
07:46
also the weirdest thing that's left on
07:48
the moon was nail clippers because they
07:49
only went up there for a couple of weeks
07:51
and they were trying to keep the weight
07:52
down to a minimum and yet they took nail
07:53
clippers with them such a great point
07:55
maybe it's like how you know your nails
07:56
go a bit faster in summer maybe in space
07:58
your nails just grow at 12 miles an hour
08:03
actually it's kilometers per hour i'm
08:04
sorry um i was looking into what neil
08:07
armstrong
08:08
took back from the moon and this is
08:10
really interesting this wasn't
08:11
discovered until 2012 until after neil
08:14
armstrong died
08:15
um his wife was going through his
08:17
cupboard just like in their house
08:18
and there was a white bag in there she
08:20
opened it up and it had all this stuff
08:22
from the moon landing
08:24
including the camera that filmed that
08:26
they famous
08:31
they had the scripts the lighting rig
08:35
yeah the camera that filmed him saying
08:37
the famous words that we all saw
08:38
that was in the bag and all these other
08:40
instruments and and so no one knew that
08:42
he had this bag
08:43
usually you would leave that bag or any
08:45
of the equipment that was in it on the
08:46
moon as part of the rubbish but he he
08:48
brought it back he just didn't tell
08:49
anyone they went through quarantine so
08:50
you think that you have to show
08:52
everything yeah well
08:53
it sounds like everyone was sneaking so
08:54
it sounds like the security is not that
08:56
type
08:57
he's such a filth pig they didn't clean
08:59
his house for 50 years
09:02
didn't even go through his cupboards i
09:05
was reading a list of all
09:06
the languages all the greetings that we
09:09
sent out into space on the
09:10
voyager golden record so you know that
09:12
thing that was yes carl sagan's
09:14
brainchild we sent this thing up into
09:16
space which has 55 different greetings
09:18
in 55 different languages on it
09:20
and most people said hello or hi guys
09:23
hello to space
09:25
but the turkish one began with dear
09:28
turkish-speaking friends
09:30
it's a weird assumption to be making
09:33
especially since turkish is a language
09:34
that was created within the last hundred
09:36
years as well so he's clearly assuming
09:37
space is caught on uh there's a greeting
09:39
in amoy which is a chinese dialect which
09:41
says
09:42
friends of space how are you all have
09:44
you eaten yet come visit us if you have
09:46
time that is fantastic
09:48
they're offering themselves up as dishes
09:53
huge error and then the last one is just
09:57
i think this person got confused because
09:58
one person would receive the recording
10:00
device to record it on
10:01
so the swedish greeting is greetings
10:03
from a computer programmer in the little
10:05
university town of ithaca on the planet
10:07
earth who i clearly didn't quite
10:08
understand he was supposed to be
10:09
speaking for his nation
10:11
is there some whale song on there yeah
10:13
there is yeah
10:15
one thing that's recently gone into
10:16
space is the new football kit of reading
10:19
fc
10:20
okay wow who did a kit launch
10:24
um a few weeks ago and they sent their
10:26
home and away strips
10:28
up to 128 000 feet four times the
10:31
cruising altitude of a passenger jet
10:34
and then they returned to earth at a
10:35
speed of 211 miles per hour and the news
10:38
article i read
10:39
said reading will be hoping the team can
10:41
rise as high in the table
10:43
as their shirts can in altitude before
10:46
presumably plummeting down the table at
10:48
200 miles an hour
10:51
[Music]
10:53
okay it is time for fact number two and
10:56
that is
10:56
chozinski my fact this week is that
10:58
geologists have made
11:00
an earthquake by dropping something
11:02
heavy from somewhere high
11:03
was it a reading football kit
11:06
are they made of iron no wonder they're
11:09
so bad
11:11
no so what i like about this is i think
11:13
if you were five years old and you
11:14
wondered how am i gonna make an
11:15
earthquake you just pick up a heavy
11:17
object and drop it
11:18
and this seems to be what they've done
11:20
and uh this is these geologists
11:21
sebastian gueno
11:23
and stefan brule who are trying to
11:25
simulate earthquakes to work out the
11:26
best ways to
11:27
minimize damage from them and there was
11:29
just one
11:30
reference i read in a pbs article to the
11:33
fact that
11:33
in one test they dropped a mass of 21
11:36
tons from a height of 164 feet
11:39
to simulate an earthquake and the
11:40
shaking registered between two and three
11:42
on the richter scale
11:43
and they did it another way which
11:45
sounded like a more sensible way maybe
11:47
by putting a vibrating probe thing into
11:49
the ground
11:50
and then vibrating it underground then
11:51
that scent to seismic waves out
11:53
which is also a way to measure it but
11:54
what they're looking into is really
11:56
interesting which is that if you drill
11:57
holes in the ground not particularly
11:59
deep holes that dissipates the waves
12:00
that come from earthquakes
12:02
so what they did was they this was in
12:04
2012 they drilled these bore holes into
12:06
the ground
12:06
just a few feet and then they generated
12:08
this earthquake nearby
12:10
and the waves that they measured in the
12:12
second row of boreholes so just 11 feet
12:14
away from where they'd created the
12:15
earthquake the earthquake had been
12:17
stopped and usually it would travel 160
12:19
feet
12:19
so these holes just deflect the waves
12:21
and cause them to go elsewhere
12:22
the problem is that they deflect them in
12:24
a different direction so behind the bore
12:26
holes suddenly was twice as much
12:27
vibrations as in front of it so it's not
12:30
a good idea for in a city if you were
12:31
doing it to protect one building you'd
12:33
do it at the expense of another one
12:34
it sounds a bit like do you remember we
12:35
talked about the volcanoes where they
12:38
dug ditches to move the
12:40
volcanic lava away from a city into
12:42
another oh yes yeah
12:43
it's exactly like that it's like
12:44
screwing over your neighbor by diverting
12:46
the earthquake towards them
12:48
so alex's fact was about kickstarter
12:50
doing this
12:51
project to get us to the moon and i saw
12:53
this amazing crowdfunding thing
12:55
for someone's invention which is an
12:56
earthquake proof bed have you guys seen
12:58
this
12:59
oh yes it's unbelievable it's this huge
13:02
metallic contraption and the idea is
13:04
that as soon as
13:05
um your building or your house is is in
13:08
the middle of an earthquake
13:09
the bed recognizes it's an earthquake
13:11
and it literally slams
13:13
down in the middle so you disappear into
13:16
the middle of the bed
13:17
a huge lid comes on top of you and
13:19
you're just stuck in this
13:21
bunker how do they make sure that the
13:24
bed can tell the difference between an
13:25
earthquake and extremely rigorous sex
13:29
did the earth move for you well it
13:32
didn't but the bed thought it did
13:36
inside it has bottles of water it's got
13:38
oxygen tanks
13:39
it's got anything that you would need to
13:41
survive but how does it protect you
13:43
because surely if you're in a in a house
13:44
that's crumbling down around you and you
13:46
want to escape it now you're locked in a
13:47
bed
13:48
so it's the idea being that this is so
13:50
strong
13:51
would just crumble around it but not
13:53
affect the box itself so it would give
13:55
you time to be rescued i guess yeah and
13:57
it sends
13:58
pulses out that firefighters and anyone
14:01
who's digging
14:02
up the rubble can sense where you are
14:04
because there's like a message an sos
14:06
message going out
14:07
yeah it looks nuts there's an app you
14:08
can get um that i read about which is
14:10
called my shake
14:12
where um you have it in your pocket and
14:14
it can detect
14:15
earthquakes and seismic activity and
14:17
then do real-time updates so
14:19
people can see when there's been
14:21
earthquakes does it like vibrate
14:24
you've never noticed it did you know you
14:26
can get negative earthquakes technically
14:27
because
14:28
when the richter scale was invented it's
14:30
a logarithmic scale so the smallest
14:32
detectable amount of earthquaking was
14:34
one when they made the richter scale and
14:36
then it kind of goes up from there
14:37
but since then our technologies got
14:38
better so we're able to detect even
14:40
smaller earthquakes than that so an
14:42
earthquake that registers as minus one
14:43
on the richter scale
14:44
is 100th the strength of an earthquake
14:47
that they originally mentioned yeah it's
14:48
something like a feather landing on a
14:50
table or something
14:51
i remember i read an xkcd comic about it
14:54
oh yeah
14:55
minus one thousand on the richter scale
14:56
would be something like you know an atom
14:58
hitting another atom or something you'd
15:00
be really annoyed if your earthquake
15:01
sensing device went off every time it
15:03
steps to minus one earthquake
15:05
how do i change the settings on this
15:06
thing describes
15:08
how in ancient greece they used to
15:11
mitigate
15:12
earthquake damage by putting sheepskin
15:13
in the foundations of their buildings so
15:15
they'd bury them put a layer of
15:16
sheepskin
15:17
and the idea was that it would stop bits
15:19
of earth sliding over each other
15:21
and we sort of employ vaguely similar
15:23
technologies today if we put springs and
15:24
stuff in the foundations of buildings
15:26
aren't they trying to put coconuts now
15:28
what they're trying to harness coconut
15:31
technology because the coconuts are far
15:34
advanced than we are
15:36
it's about how we use some of their
15:37
technology
15:39
yeah coconuts apparently they're very
15:40
good at absorbing certain things
15:42
and they're trying to work out the
15:44
makeup of the coconut that allows for it
15:46
to absorb so well that they can
15:47
then apply to technology should we move
15:49
on soon the one quite interesting thing
15:51
about making earthquakes um the father
15:54
of seismology is a guy called robert
15:56
mallett and he was from ireland
15:58
but there aren't any earthquakes in
16:00
ireland
16:02
the highest one ever recorded was two on
16:04
the richter scale
16:06
but what he did was he set explosions up
16:08
on the beach
16:09
and measured the explosions so using
16:11
dynamite and stuff like that
16:13
that's annoying for those on beach
16:14
holidays
16:19
okay it is time for fact number three
16:22
and that is james okay my fact this week
16:25
is that until
16:26
1970 you could still buy men only
16:29
flights
16:30
in america this is extraordinary right
16:33
it makes no sense
16:34
well it's sort of me so explain the
16:36
logic and then we'll pick it up yeah
16:38
so this was united airlines and for
16:40
about
16:41
two decades until 1970
16:44
um you could buy these flights between
16:46
new york and chicago or between la and
16:48
san francisco that were for men only
16:51
and the idea was i think they were for
16:53
businessmen
16:54
and you're going to have no women and no
16:56
children on board
16:57
and according to the advert which i saw
17:00
online
17:01
it said you'll enjoy the informal
17:02
club-like atmosphere
17:04
smoke your pipe or cigar if you wish and
17:07
make yourself comfortable
17:08
using the pair of slippers provided wow
17:12
i mean obviously it's ridiculous but i
17:14
think they wanted to replicate the idea
17:16
of a gentleman's only club for instance
17:18
which still existed
17:19
and still exists now the flight
17:21
attendants were female yeah
17:23
yeah so famously stewardesses have had
17:25
very strict appearance
17:27
rules that they have to abide by in the
17:29
past um so i think
17:30
the very first stewardesses had to weigh
17:32
less than eight stone two
17:33
which is microscopic and they had to be
17:36
under 25
17:37
and less than five foot four which is
17:38
extremely short wow so i was reading
17:40
about the first air steward as ever
17:41
ellen church
17:42
so this was for boeing air transport she
17:44
saw an advert for a cabin boys
17:47
they were trying to get people more
17:48
confident about air flight and she
17:50
persuaded
17:50
boeing air transport to give her the job
17:52
on the basis that why don't you put
17:53
women on and then people will see that
17:55
if a woman can do it then men can
17:56
definitely do it yeah
17:57
and she just to say she was actually a
17:59
pilot she went and said i'm a pilot i
18:01
can find this plane they were like no we
18:02
don't believe you're gonna fly at planes
18:04
okay there's only four thousand female
18:07
pilots around the world out of 130
18:09
thousand
18:09
for a while that's nuts but i was
18:12
looking at some things he had to do and
18:13
they had to carry a spanner and a
18:14
screwdriver in their pocket so they
18:16
could fix
18:17
the wicker chairs that the passengers
18:18
sat in to the floor of the aircraft
18:19
because apparently that was not the
18:21
thing
18:21
that was already done for them and one
18:23
of the other jobs is that if a plane
18:25
ever had to make an emergency landing in
18:26
like a field due to bad weather they
18:27
were responsible for knocking down the
18:29
fences so that it could take back off
18:30
again
18:32
because these are sort of in the early
18:33
days of commercial flight so it was
18:34
mainly
18:35
male planes i mean postage oh yeah
18:37
because that was another justification
18:38
for the small size they asked women to
18:40
be it said we need to fit as much mail
18:41
on board as possible
18:43
if you weigh nine stone then you can't
18:45
fit that extra pasta as much male as
18:46
possible and then this little female as
18:48
yes yes
18:50
um the first female commercial airline
18:53
captain
18:53
in britain was called yvonne sinti's she
18:57
was a pilot for the uk based airline dan
19:00
air from 1975 until her retirement in
19:03
1980.
19:04
well good for you dan this is great
19:06
unfortunately um
19:08
things went downhill for danae and they
19:10
were sold to british airways in 1992 for
19:12
one pound
19:14
oh no um there's a there's an airline
19:16
that i found that i really like um i
19:18
hope it's still going but it was
19:19
launched in 2008
19:20
and it was the world's first nude
19:23
airline
19:24
so it was for nudists bonus very quick
19:26
to go through security
19:28
yes i thought you were saying bonus
19:31
[Laughter]
19:34
so it was a very specific route that
19:36
they were taking them on which was
19:38
from a german city uh airfort and they
19:40
were going to a baltic sea resort the
19:42
thing was though is that you can't
19:43
arrive at the airport naked so what they
19:46
would do is they would come
19:47
with their clothes and they would get on
19:49
the plane and then all take their
19:51
clothes off when they were on the plane
19:52
and then when they landed all had to put
19:54
their clothes back on to get off the
19:55
plane
19:55
imagine if you're the one person who's
19:57
accidentally put stickers on that and
19:59
you get on that plane it takes off and
20:00
you look around like
20:02
what's happening
20:07
my favorite airline i found is north
20:09
korea's airline air koryo have you seen
20:10
these
20:11
these guys they're the world's only
20:13
airline that's the sky
20:14
tracks has rated one star so they're
20:16
their worst airline i was looking some
20:18
of the complaints that people have
20:18
posted on
20:20
including um that the in-flight
20:22
entertainment for the two-hour flight
20:23
was basically north korean propaganda
20:25
that the seats tilted forwards rather
20:27
than backwards the plane
20:28
[Laughter]
20:32
and then during the flight both pilots
20:34
came around to say hello presumably
20:36
leaving the aircraft on autopilot
20:40
or just on in-flight entertainment um in
20:43
the 1950s when it was a rare and
20:44
exciting thing to be flying well first
20:46
of all it was so exotic that people
20:47
would wear evening dress onto a flight
20:49
so they'd you know you'd go without just
20:51
getting onto the flight and then you
20:52
take it off
20:54
um and secondly you'd automatically be
20:56
given a postcard when you're boarded by
20:58
the stewardesses and that was
20:59
so the idea was that during the flight
21:01
you'd write a postcard to your friends
21:02
back home
21:03
talking about the flight because that's
21:05
what they want to hear about
21:07
there's new services that are happening
21:09
now klm the royal dutch airlines
21:12
they now do a thing so you know when
21:13
you're checking in and you can select
21:14
the seats that you want they're now
21:16
attaching facebook profiles to the seats
21:18
so you can actually
21:19
decide who you'd like to sit next to so
21:22
there's the creepy elements that you
21:23
might set yourself next to yeah and i
21:25
can't think of any other relevance
21:28
weirdly the other element for they say
21:30
the other element for a lot of people is
21:31
um they don't want to be near kids and
21:33
so
21:33
you look to where families are sitting
21:35
and you can sit yourself as far away
21:37
wait and it's like
21:38
a first come first serve kind of thing
21:39
so because surely everyone would say
21:41
i want to be that one really attractive
21:43
person and no one wants to sit next to
21:44
the really smelly looking guy
21:46
the smelly looking guy yeah from his
21:48
facebook profile he's got little wavy
21:50
lines above his face
21:51
there's a green smoke coming up
21:57
okay it is time for our final fact of
21:59
the show and that is my fact
22:01
my fact is that the discovery of the
22:04
higgs boson
22:05
was announced in comic sans this is the
22:08
big
22:10
multi-billion dollar machine that is
22:12
looking for
22:13
something to unify science with a
22:16
missing god particle that was found and
22:18
they chose
22:18
comic sans the font to announce it in
22:23
why not and why not it's yeah really
22:25
good point what was amazing was um
22:27
if uh if you were online at the time
22:28
when the higgs boson was announced you
22:30
probably remember this story because it
22:31
caught
22:31
such a huge commotion and everyone was
22:34
on twitter and
22:35
all social media making all these angry
22:37
points about it including a guy called
22:39
vincent connaur
22:40
who is saying this is ridiculous that
22:42
they use comic sans
22:43
vincent connor invented comic sans his
22:46
argument that he designed it only for
22:48
children and well it's designed for
22:50
comic books wasn't it and well it was
22:51
inspired by com but it was inspired by
22:52
the watchman weirdly and
22:54
and uh dark knight returns two seminal
22:57
comic books that
22:58
couldn't be further away from the kind
23:00
of integrity that comic sangs brings to
23:02
the table but i'm totally on his side
23:04
because he did
23:04
he invented it uh microsoft commissioned
23:06
him to design a very
23:08
friendly approachable font for a very
23:09
specific program for kids and people who
23:11
aren't very good at computers it's
23:12
actually not a bad font to use for that
23:14
but it's just very misused all around
23:15
the world and so this guy gets a lot of
23:17
hate for
23:18
inventing a form that's actually if
23:19
people use it in wrong places i think
23:21
it's fine
23:22
yeah i don't really get the big deal
23:23
about it i like it i think it's correct
23:25
but so it's sort of for children it's
23:26
just supposed to be a friendly
23:28
non-aggressive non-intimidating font so
23:30
you can oh and then all of the
23:32
aggression and aggro that these guys got
23:35
from it
23:35
ironically yeah yeah i mean there's even
23:38
there's a site called bandcomicsands.com
23:40
it's run by a couple who um
23:42
who met over their hatred of comic sans
23:44
they got married literally they say
23:45
that's what brought them together and
23:46
they started this thing
23:48
and i've seen a documentary between uh
23:50
vincent connor
23:51
talking about hearing about these people
23:53
and these people just discussing how
23:54
much they hate it
23:55
and it's really funny because he makes
23:57
this point where he says i'm so glad
23:59
that my font brought them together
24:00
because now they're together for the
24:01
rest of their lives
24:02
they're kind of there going don't change
24:05
the subject
24:06
maybe they did it to make the discovery
24:08
try to appear
24:10
simpler to understand than it was um if
24:12
this is the purpose of comic sans
24:14
perhaps it was to convince us
24:15
that um it was actually easier to
24:16
understand the higgs boson particles i
24:18
think
24:18
literally that is why they picked it you
24:20
know honestly yeah i think they wanted
24:22
to match
24:22
the complexity of what they were doing
24:24
with a friendly font that said
24:27
this is not meant to be scaring you
24:35
do not have personalities you are
24:37
forcing a personality onto these things
24:39
they're just
24:39
bits of code
24:42
do you know that they expose on on the
24:44
subject of how complex it is to
24:46
comprehend
24:46
the uk science minister in 1993 ran a
24:49
competition to see who could provide the
24:50
best explanation to the british
24:52
government of what the hell it was the
24:53
guy who won or one of the people who won
24:54
was a physicist called david miller
24:56
he described it by saying an anonymous
24:58
person could move through a crowd
24:59
unhindered but if the prime minister
25:01
moved through a crowd
25:02
he or she would attract a lot of
25:04
attention so party workers would clump
25:06
around that person and slow them down
25:08
and give them this metaphorical mass
25:10
and that's the equivalent of the higgs
25:11
boson that's a very good explanation
25:14
i remember ages ago going out for a
25:16
drink with a couple of scientists here
25:18
and
25:19
they were saying that basically the
25:20
reason that scientists were so
25:22
wanting to say yes let's find the higgs
25:24
boson is then we'd be able to build
25:27
the lhc and what that meant was
25:29
effectively was they didn't know what
25:31
they were looking for but they said it
25:32
would be the equivalent of just going
25:34
out fishing and throwing your rod out
25:35
into
25:36
the lake or the ocean so the higgs boson
25:38
was the excuse but actually they just
25:39
wanted to go fishing
25:40
right yeah well the higgs boson i think
25:42
i'm right in saying that it's been a bit
25:44
of a disappointment
25:45
because it kind of just does what
25:47
everyone expected it to do
25:49
this is confusing this is what stephen
25:50
hawking said wasn't it he said it was
25:52
disappointing because of that and it's
25:53
like surely you're happy guys
25:55
you are happy but if it had done
25:56
something really weird
25:58
then suddenly it opens up whole new bits
26:00
of science and science becomes really
26:02
exciting yeah
26:03
if it just fits perfectly you know it's
26:05
like doing a jigsaw and you've got one
26:07
more piece in
26:08
and it goes in and you're finished or if
26:10
the last one doesn't go in right then
26:12
maybe you've got some other stuff wrong
26:13
and then you're gonna tear it apart
26:14
and try it again yeah maybe if they'd
26:16
announced it in a more exciting form
26:18
like wingdings or something
26:21
just on fonts having personalities they
26:24
do not have personalities
26:26
um there was a study that suggested that
26:28
you're more likely to believe that a
26:29
statement is true if it's written in a
26:31
sensible weighty font and like
26:32
baskerville for example that's a very
26:34
trustworthy font
26:35
whereas comments are not always believe
26:36
it's the people who did ban
26:38
comic sans.com they showed examples of
26:41
there's a lawyer firm
26:42
in america that has their name written
26:45
in comic sans outside and they're going
26:46
you're not going to trust
26:47
that lawyer the lawyer who writes in
26:49
comic sans and they said if you see
26:51
something that says wet paint and it's
26:52
written in comic sans you're going to
26:53
touch that wall and then i thought okay
26:55
you're losing your argument
26:56
yeah this is getting a bit desperate
26:58
there was a dutch war memorial that had
27:00
something engraved on it in comic sans
27:01
which is really inappropriate as well
27:03
i uh i was looking a bit more into cern
27:06
um just the history of cern and there's
27:08
a few famous things i think a lot of
27:10
people know
27:10
um for example the first image that was
27:12
ever put on the internet
27:14
was of a band that worked at cern
27:18
yeah the nets so i just looked into them
27:19
a tiny bit and it's they're actually i
27:21
think more people should
27:23
listen to them and and check it out
27:24
because it's genuinely like it's really
27:26
good lyrics and really oh yeah they're
27:27
really good
27:27
yeah there's a song called collider and
27:30
and it was this song is about the
27:31
frustration that michelle de gennaro
27:33
had with the fact that her boyfriend was
27:36
always going away and working
27:37
on the lhc and not spending enough time
27:39
with her because they were all so busy
27:40
doing what they're doing
27:41
so she wrote collider and the lyrics are
27:42
i gave you a golden ring to show you my
27:44
love
27:45
you went to stick it in a printed
27:46
circuit to fix a voltage leak in your
27:48
collector
27:49
you plug my feelings into your detector
27:51
you never spend your nights with me
27:52
you don't go out with other girls either
27:54
you only love your collider your
27:56
collider
27:57
there's a really good lyrics well sorry
27:59
though yeah the thing is i'm not sure
28:01
many people can really relate to those
28:04
lyrics
28:04
my boyfriend's obsessed with his
28:06
colliders just being a workaholic a lot
28:08
of people complain about their partners
28:09
being workaholics
28:10
so what you're saying is this is
28:12
basically rihanna's work work work
28:14
yes exactly and i think they should too
28:18
because there's a lot of plagiarism
28:20
going on here
28:22
um you know you know sun do you know
28:24
what it stands for i can't believe i
28:25
didn't know this i'm guessing
28:26
you guys all do it's french but i can't
28:28
remember so it's french
28:30
it stands for nothing now
28:35
so it was the concert european paula
28:37
resher nuclear
28:38
so the council for europe nuclear
28:40
research but the name of that was
28:42
changed to the organization of nuclear
28:43
research so it should have been o-e-r-n
28:45
and this was many many years ago
28:47
and they just thought sounds a bit
28:50
rubbish so let's just call it sun
28:51
uh sounds like it could be like a
28:53
carry-on
28:54
[Laughter]
28:56
carry-on colliding i think it should be
28:59
called
29:01
uh we got anything before we move on
29:03
guys uh yeah i scored one thing on fonts
29:05
i was just looking up kind of weird
29:06
fonts and if you go to dotsies.org
29:08
it's a font but they're trying to
29:10
reinvent what the alphabet
29:12
is so ev every letter of the alphabet
29:14
this person who designed it argues is
29:15
very inefficient because it takes up so
29:16
much space
29:17
so what he's done is basically it's like
29:19
a couple of pixels for each letter and
29:20
it's basically like braille but for the
29:22
eyes if you go to the website you can
29:23
read a whole paragraph and it starts off
29:24
in normal text and then the
29:26
letters get more and more distorted
29:28
until you're reading something that is
29:29
actually completely legible if you look
29:30
at it
29:31
and it's just it's just it looks a bit
29:33
like a very condensed square braille
29:34
and then you can kind of read it it
29:36
takes a while that's amazing what sort
29:37
of thing this like shape of words yeah
29:39
the words they start or completely
29:40
normal words and then
29:41
they're sort of very distorted and you
29:43
sort of you train your brain over so
29:44
that's very clever
29:45
what are we going to do with all that
29:46
amazing extra space that we're going to
29:48
have
29:48
at the end of each book there's just
29:50
going to be 30 like pages
29:52
actually you say that i the other thing
29:53
i found about space and books is that
29:55
all of the harry potter books were
29:56
printed with a size 12 font
29:58
but the order of the phoenix was printed
30:00
point five smaller everyone complains at
30:02
the order of the phoenix is so much
30:03
longer as a book
30:05
that's an amazing most
30:08
useless bit of information let's go to
30:11
the moon now
30:15
that's what we're telling the universe
30:17
they really are they're turning back
30:19
but turning back going back where they
30:20
came from
30:22
[Music]
30:24
okay that's it that's all of our facts
30:26
thank you so much for listening to this
30:28
special made for the moon
30:30
episode if you would like to get in
30:32
contact with any of us about the things
30:33
that we have said
30:34
you can't we all died in 2023
30:38
in a tragic explosion at the qi office
30:43
i'm still in a bed somewhere
30:44
[Laughter]
30:46

00:14
hello
00:15
and welcome to another episode of no
00:17
such thing as a fish
00:18
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
00:20
qi offices in covent garden
00:22
my name is dan schreiber and i am
00:24
sitting here with anna chazinski
00:26
alex bell and james harkin and once
00:28
again we have gathered around the
00:29
microphones with our four
00:31
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:33
and in no particular order
00:34
here we go starting with you alex bell
00:38
my fact this week is that the controls
00:40
in the world's first combat submarine
00:42
were lit up with glowing mushrooms
00:44
that is disgusting amazing when you say
00:47
the controls
00:48
were the controls themselves the
00:50
mushrooms or no that would be amazing it
00:52
was actually
00:52
like in your car at night time when
00:54
you're driving all the dials kind of
00:55
light up
00:56
yes so it was literally the little
00:58
needles on the dials and things that had
01:00
tiny bits of boxfire which is the type
01:02
of
01:02
bioluminescent fungi attached to them i
01:04
think foxfire is what americans call
01:06
any kind of glowing fungus and it comes
01:08
from fox
01:10
more like foe as in fake fake fire i
01:12
used to call it cold fire didn't they i
01:14
think
01:14
maybe aristotle or someone said it was
01:17
cold fire when was this
01:18
submarine this was a summary called the
01:20
turtle it was more of a kind of
01:21
submersible
01:22
it looked like a giant lemon a one-man
01:25
submersible was built in 1775
01:27
in america and it was to fight british
01:29
royal navy ships so
01:30
uh if you imagine a kind of acorn or
01:32
lemon-shaped thing that's big enough to
01:33
keep one man in and that floats just
01:34
under the water and then it's got a
01:35
little knobby bit on the top that sticks
01:37
above the water with windows in
01:38
and you put your head up in that bit so
01:39
you can see the ships and is the first
01:41
submarine to use water as ballast so
01:43
when it needed to sink
01:44
it has water pumped in and then you can
01:46
pump it out again but the person who
01:48
would claim to
01:49
have built the first submarine is
01:51
cornelius van drebel and that was at the
01:52
very
01:53
start of the 17th century and he sort of
01:56
did the same
01:57
thing i think where the way his
01:59
submarine worked is that it was like a
02:01
boat but with a roof over the top
02:03
and under each seat there was a huge
02:05
pig's bladder
02:06
and the pig's bladder was filled up with
02:09
water and when it was filled up with
02:10
water then it would sink
02:12
um so that would be what weighted it all
02:13
the way down and then i think they would
02:15
just squeeze the pig's bladders so that
02:17
they emptied in order to rise to the
02:18
surface again
02:19
so if you're sitting on your seat and
02:20
you had to go up to the surface again
02:21
you just like pushed down really really
02:23
hard on your seat
02:24
and then the water pumped out of the pig
02:26
splatters like a whoopee cushion kind of
02:27
exactly like a whoopee cushion didn't
02:29
make the noise
02:30
hopefully yeah just to amuse the fish
02:32
but then that would give away your
02:34
location so
02:36
obviously this is pre-electricity did
02:38
they use bioluminescent
02:40
fungi for any other kind of household
02:43
lighting
02:43
i mean it's weird that they cracked the
02:45
idea that you could use this in a
02:46
submarine but not use it in homes
02:48
i know that the scandinavians were
02:50
supposed to have used it at night time
02:51
during the long sort of winter nights
02:54
and
02:55
there was a guy in the 1600s who wrote
02:57
that indonesians used
02:59
fungus as improvised torches yeah and
03:02
also micronesians used to
03:04
put bioluminescent fungus onto their
03:06
clothes like for um
03:08
sort of graves i think they still do i
03:10
think they
03:11
still decorate their faces and their
03:13
headdresses with glowing mushrooms
03:15
wow to scare people that would scare me
03:17
it would yeah
03:18
hopefully you just get a massive
03:20
mushroom phobe yeah in every battle
03:22
so i was looking into things that glow
03:24
on earth
03:25
and one of the things i found was
03:27
there's all these forests
03:29
that glow with bioluminescence fungi as
03:31
well and i i've just never seen it
03:33
before and you can see pictures online
03:34
it's stunning
03:35
it does look like you've gone into laser
03:37
quest but a forest
03:38
and we only found out exactly the
03:40
mechanism by which they glow a couple of
03:41
years ago i think
03:42
um although it's just a chemical process
03:44
that i didn't understand anyway
03:46
but we didn't know until a couple of
03:47
years ago and now
03:49
that means that hopefully we can
03:50
replicate it and they're thinking about
03:51
using it in
03:52
street lighting i think there's a dutch
03:54
designer called dan rusegaard
03:56
whose name i will have mispronounced and
03:58
um yeah he's looking at bioluminescent
04:00
creatures in order to make streetlights
04:01
i mean one day we might plant street
04:03
lamps and they'll just grow
04:04
yeah that's true that would be cool
04:05
that'd be pretty good wouldn't it yeah
04:07
they've been making glowing plants
04:09
in the iss in the international space
04:11
station yeah remember we spoke about the
04:13
cress
04:13
that they were making up in space well
04:15
the crests they genetically modified so
04:17
it would glow
04:18
a different color if it was feeling
04:19
stressed because that's what they wanted
04:21
to do they wanted to test the stress
04:22
levels of plants
04:23
crosstress so they yeah they managed to
04:27
make these glow
04:28
so they could be like oh it's really
04:29
stressed but they were actually pushing
04:30
the stress on the crest as well they
04:32
wanted to
04:32
see how far they could push it before it
04:34
starts withering and so they can't
04:36
handle it anymore
04:37
yeah yeah send him back down he's he's
04:38
not doing development stress on chris
04:40
i guess um by putting in space
04:45
most important quests i've got a really
04:46
important job
04:48
yeah i think it's kind of lack of water
04:50
would be stressful for plants
04:52
or poor soil i remember once reading
04:55
that if
04:56
clover is stressed then it grows extra
04:58
leaves because it needs to get more
04:59
nutrients
05:00
and so if you see a far leaved clover
05:02
it's more likely to come from a stressed
05:04
environment
05:05
oh really it's actually an upset clover
05:07
it's horrible luck
05:08
it's good luck for you but bad luck for
05:10
the clover oh no that's so sad
05:12
oh wow that's just really interesting
05:16
yeah that's what we're here for
05:18
[Laughter]
05:20
finally 130 shows
05:24
um on mushrooms and funky some fungi
05:27
make a noise when they release their
05:28
spores
05:29
so there's a fungi called the devil's
05:31
cigar and it only exists in a really
05:33
remote place in the middle of texas and
05:35
in japan
05:36
but apparently it makes a weird
05:38
whistling noise oh yeah okay
05:41
while you're saying all that i was just
05:42
trying to imagine what kind of noises it
05:44
would be
05:44
i just want to be hilarious it was just
05:46
like just
05:47
literally i was thinking more like
05:48
tennis growing
05:52
sex noises well that's what they're
05:56
doing aren't they they're releasing
05:57
spores they aren't having
05:58
sex i think no they sure are but so they
06:00
will feel like masturbating i think
06:02
because you're putting it out there
06:04
aren't you yeah you're right although
06:06
i think masturbating you're not kind of
06:07
throwing your sperm out there in the
06:09
hope that it collects
06:12
because i know why you do it in the hope
06:14
that it finds an egg somewhere
06:16
so i am not allowed back to the sperm
06:18
during her hospital
06:20
there is a famous thing about um
06:22
giraffes when they have sex they can't
06:24
always
06:24
mount each other correctly and so they
06:27
often ejaculate and their ejaculate
06:29
is kind of lighter than air and drifts
06:31
around so sometimes if you go to some
06:33
zoos
06:34
there could be like little strands of
06:36
giraffe ejaculation
06:39
and is that like the equivalent of a
06:40
bride throwing a bouquet
06:42
do they just chuck it into the wind and
06:44
see which female giraffe goes through it
06:49
but underwater the same isn't it lots of
06:51
species of things underwater release
06:52
their sperm just into the water when
06:53
there aren't females around it and the
06:55
assumption it'll get somewhere
06:56
yeah corals um fungus actually it's
06:59
weird that you suggested the farting
07:00
sound because
07:01
fungi do make their own wind so they
07:03
generate their own weather
07:04
and this is a way that they they
07:06
disperse their spores and so they've
07:07
looked into this with oyster and
07:09
shiitake
07:09
mushrooms and what they do is they give
07:12
off water vapor
07:12
and that cools down the air just above
07:15
them and that makes this
07:16
convection current which makes the air
07:17
as if you remember the old gcse physics
07:20
kind of
07:20
spin around and so the convection
07:22
current means that the
07:24
spores get blown further away so they're
07:26
able to disperse that's like the
07:27
opposite of sweating because we sweat in
07:28
order for
07:29
air to evaporate it so it cools us down
07:31
but they're sweating in order to make
07:33
the air move
07:35
yes it's kind of it's like an
07:36
alternative to sweating i don't know if
07:37
it's the exact opposite the exact
07:39
opposite is like sucking
07:41
james always says that uh when you're in
07:43
a club there's almost a weather system
07:45
above you and
07:46
yeah people have been to clubs i'm sure
07:47
where it's so hot and sweaty that it
07:49
starts raining sweat from the scene so
07:51
is it like that
07:51
yes it's like a disgusting cloud of
07:53
mushroom sweat but a single fungi
07:55
craving
07:56
yeah there are lots of them there i
07:57
guess you get a big cloud a big sweat
07:59
club
07:59
you guys always say that i'm wrong to be
08:03
disgusted by mushrooms yeah but the more
08:05
i hear about the sweat rain
08:07
the more i think yeah they're lovely
08:09
it's also an alternative answer why did
08:10
the mushroom go to the party
08:11
to create better airflow within the rave
08:13
room so it would rain
08:15
oh yes yeah
08:19
that's that would be the answer from the
08:21
mushroom expert actually the reason he
08:23
was so high
08:25
i think i tweeted once that um because
08:27
it's why did a mushroom go
08:30
he's not a fun guy he's a fun gus it
08:33
should be why did the
08:34
mushroom cold gus go to the party
08:36
because he was a fun guy
08:38
i don't want to go to any party that
08:39
involves james plus an expert
08:41
but going around ruining jokes the
08:44
fastest accelerating
08:46
thing on earth is a fungus it's known as
08:49
the hat thrower or the dung cannon
08:50
fungus
08:51
and it lives on feces and so it needs to
08:54
blast its spores away from the feces
08:55
because
08:56
the way it procreates is by having its
08:58
spores eaten by
08:59
let's say cows and cows do not like to
09:01
eat where they
09:02
defecate like a lot of us um
09:08
so yeah they have to blast the spores
09:09
far away and they accelerate to
09:11
45 miles an hour within the first
09:13
millimeter um so
09:15
it means the spores will travel at more
09:16
than a million times their body length
09:18
in one second
09:19
interesting what you say about cows
09:21
because i was just thinking they do eat
09:22
where they
09:23
don't they in a field yeah so in a field
09:25
only in the like we sometimes
09:27
and eat in the same house no no
09:29
very different because there's not it's
09:30
not often
09:31
that i will be in the kitchen or at the
09:33
dinner table and there's a next to
09:35
my
09:35
plate that's true is there a kind of
09:37
code amongst the cows to on the
09:39
left-hand side of the field and
09:40
and dinner's on the right that does
09:42
happen with some animals yeah right um
09:44
there are some burrowing animals that
09:45
will have a special
09:46
place where they defecate ants
09:48
definitely do they have a special toilet
09:50
where they expect
09:51
yeah generally for animals like that as
09:52
long as you are a few meters away i
09:54
think you're okay no it's okay but you
09:55
might see a great patch of grass and you
09:57
go over and you go oh someone's
09:58
shot on my potential dinner the other
10:00
thing is that the is obviously
10:02
gonna make the grass grow better
10:04
because the fertilization so really you
10:06
do want to eat where you
10:07
one cow is another cow dinner
10:10
as the old cow proverb goes
10:14
here's a really good story that i love
10:16
jim lovell the man
10:17
who piloted apollo 13 don't know if i've
10:19
mentioned him in this office before
10:22
yeah he's my absolute hero so um he
10:25
almost didn't make it
10:26
to apollo 13 because he almost had to go
10:28
down
10:29
in an airplane when he was fighting in a
10:31
war uh because
10:33
his radar got jammed so he turns his map
10:36
light on which is inside
10:37
so that he can guide his way home
10:38
looking at all his instruments the map
10:40
light short circuits the entire cockpit
10:42
so as a result he's got literally no
10:45
light so he looks down into the ocean
10:46
and suddenly notices in the ocean
10:48
this huge long trail of bioluminescence
10:50
green algae that's just lit up the ocean
10:53
and the only way that this lights up is
10:55
in the wake of a massive ship
10:56
going by so basically it's a ginormous
10:59
runway
11:00
leading him back home and he follows
11:02
that trail and he lands back on the
11:03
aircraft carrier and survives
11:05
it's extraordinary ridiculous factors
11:07
like the fact that he couldn't even see
11:08
it when he turned off all his normal
11:10
lights every single light in the cockpit
11:11
had to go off for a second room to
11:12
notice it talks it was so painful yeah
11:14
yeah so he needed all those things to go
11:15
wrong his radar to jam
11:17
to be a short circuit in the it's
11:18
extraordinary yeah and nature guided him
11:20
home
11:21
yeah it was incredible well technically
11:23
it was the the aircraft carrier
11:24
destroying nature
11:26
oh yeah
11:30
okay it is time for fact number two and
11:33
that
11:34
is james okay my fact this week is
11:37
that while he was president woodrow
11:39
wilson played more than
11:40
1200 rounds of golf how many terms did
11:43
he do
11:44
did two terms so it's what eight years
11:46
yeah presidential golf historian don
11:49
van natta says that it's between 1200
11:51
and 1600
11:53
and 1600 goes into eight a lot more
11:55
nicely so that would be 200
11:57
rounds a year which let's say 50 weeks
11:59
is four rounds a week
12:00
and just to be clear to those of us who
12:02
aren't golf knowledgeable how long does
12:04
it take to do a round of golf
12:05
uh it depends but um i should think it
12:08
would have taken him at least four hours
12:10
if he's you know taking his time and
12:12
also he wasn't very good was he no
12:13
he wasn't actually not very good despite
12:15
all the practice so probably did take
12:16
him ages
12:17
yeah he wasn't very good um but there's
12:19
kind of a big history of
12:21
american presidents playing golf and
12:23
this particular fact came because
12:25
this week barack obama played his 300th
12:28
round
12:28
and a lot of his opponents are saying
12:30
well he shouldn't be playing so much
12:31
golf he should be concentrating on being
12:33
president
12:35
and it turns out being president seems
12:36
to just entail playing golf
12:38
yeah i did see a really funny anti-obama
12:41
website called obama golf counter
12:43
oh yeah and you go on to it and it just
12:45
slowly tallies up how many
12:47
days he's played golf on and it just has
12:50
audio of him
12:51
just in a loop about 12 different
12:53
versions of him going i will not rest
12:55
until and then an example of like you
12:56
know isis are taken down
12:58
i will not run and it's just counting up
13:00
and up the amount of days he's played
13:02
golf
13:02
that's funny but you're not resting if
13:04
you're playing golf are you it's very
13:05
physical
13:06
it's extremely mind driven so just to
13:10
state how ridiculously popular is among
13:12
presidents there have only been
13:13
three presidents in the 20th century who
13:15
weren't golf fanatics
13:17
and they were herba hoover who just felt
13:19
it was um disrespectful during the
13:20
depression
13:21
and actually i think george bush did a
13:22
similar thing uh when america was at war
13:24
in afghanistan and iraq he said it was
13:26
disrespectful
13:27
so he gave up golf did trump not do that
13:29
quite recently
13:30
so trump's making a golf course in
13:32
scotland isn't he
13:33
and he went to look at it and they said
13:35
well why don't you have a few play a few
13:37
holes
13:37
and he was like i don't want to be seen
13:39
with a golf club in my hand because i'm
13:41
slagging off obama that he's playing so
13:42
i don't want to be seen playing golf
13:44
yes yeah and then the only other two are
13:46
harry truman and jimmy carter and
13:48
all the other presidents of the 20th
13:49
century and 21st century have been
13:51
obsessed with gold woodrow wilson
13:52
apparently had the secret service paint
13:54
his golf balls black so he could play
13:55
them
13:56
in the white house i thought it was in
13:57
the snow it was in this
13:59
way more sense because i was like hey i
14:00
don't think the white house is totally
14:02
white
14:02
yeah and it sounds like the outside
14:04
walls of the white house are absorbing
14:05
the balls
14:08
woodrow wilson is on an american bill
14:12
money bill didn't know that it's bill
14:14
clinton
14:15
that'd be good that would be very good
14:16
no he's not what's he on he's on
14:18
the 100 000 bill yeah
14:21
which was only circulated for a few
14:23
months i believe it was
14:24
just you couldn't get any changes
14:26
[Laughter]
14:28
well actually funny you should mention
14:29
that because i just read that in 2004 a
14:32
woman
14:33
in georgia in a place called covington
14:35
um tried to pick up a 1675
14:39
tab at her local walmart with a forged 1
14:42
million
14:43
one million dollar bill that had just
14:45
been made
14:46
it's got the statue of liberty's head on
14:48
it in place of where a president should
14:50
be
14:50
uh ed police quickly arrested her what
14:54
kind of change did you think you were
14:55
gonna get
14:56
from your million-dollar bill at walmart
14:59
on woodrow wilson actually he was in
15:02
love with the lake district
15:03
which i thought was quite bizarre the
15:04
british lake bridge the british lake
15:06
district
15:07
um so his mother was his family came
15:09
from scotland and from the north of
15:10
england his mum was born in carlisle and
15:12
he visited the lake district for the
15:14
first time in 1896 and he went there
15:16
five times altogether
15:17
so he was a cycling fanatic right a lot
15:19
of people say he was the first person
15:21
in the state of north carolina to get on
15:23
a bike
15:24
um but he to do they all owned them
15:28
everyone was too scared isn't the castle
15:31
of north carolina rally
15:32
and they make bikes it sure is good
15:36
whoa well he was the first man to own
15:39
and ride a
15:40
rally bike okay north carolina but he
15:42
used to go to the lake district and do
15:44
these long cycle rides so he did one
15:46
from
15:47
glasgow to carlisle when scotland came
15:49
back down and then
15:50
keswick to grasmere and this is what he
15:52
loved and before he died he was planning
15:54
his sixth trip
15:55
and then they popped his clogs instead
15:57
um so this afternoon instead of
15:59
researching i've been watching the
16:00
olympics golf
16:01
and this is the first time that golf's
16:03
been in the olympics for ages and ages
16:05
and ages
16:06
the last time um was in 1904
16:09
it was at st louis and there were 77
16:12
players um 74 of them were american and
16:15
three of them were canadian
16:17
and a canadian one and is that why they
16:20
stopped doing it america just shut down
16:22
gold for a century
16:23
it was a guy called george lyon uh he
16:26
was in his mid-40s and he only took up
16:28
the game at age 38
16:30
and the following olympics in 1908
16:34
um they were going to have a competition
16:35
but none of the players
16:37
um from the royal nation could decide
16:40
what the format would be
16:41
and so everyone withdrew the only person
16:44
who didn't withdraw was george lyon
16:45
again
16:46
and they offered him the gold medal but
16:48
he decided well i'm not playing so i
16:50
don't really deserve it so he didn't get
16:51
it
16:52
that is i think that's really mean on
16:53
george lyon how annoyed would you be if
16:55
all these people just didn't bother yeah
16:57
it's bad
16:57
it's robbing him of his glory um isn't
17:00
the olympic golf course being overrun by
17:02
cappy boroughs
17:03
i saw someone tweet a picture because it
17:05
was i think they built it on a
17:06
nature reserve or in a bit of swamp
17:08
that's in a nature reserve and there are
17:09
cappy bars popping up
17:10
the real story is that the capybara
17:12
natures have been overrun by golfers
17:13
well that's what they're discussing
17:23
i read an interview with him in fact i
17:25
read an interview with his wife and he
17:26
licks his golf balls before he takes a
17:28
shot each time
17:29
um because he says he doesn't want to
17:31
get his golf towel his white golf towel
17:33
dirty
17:34
often when you go and play golf it will
17:35
say do not lick your balls
17:38
and that's because they use a lot of
17:40
chemicals on the greens to make the
17:41
greens grow
17:42
and a lot of them are quite poisonous so
17:44
you can get really sick by licking your
17:46
golf balls
17:46
is it genuinely a sign that says do not
17:48
lick your balls quite often i think
17:51
it's i think it's done knowingly oh yeah
17:53
is it a habit that people have is this
17:55
not abnormal then for people to lick
17:57
their golf balls
17:57
if you had a little bit of mud on your
17:59
balls
18:01
just one bowl in fact because you only
18:03
use one if you had a bit of mud on then
18:05
you just wanted to clean it then you
18:06
might lick your finger and just wipe off
18:08
the
18:08
mud and then next time you get some more
18:10
mud on it so you lick your finger again
18:11
if i have a muddy finger i'll wash my
18:13
hands they don't bring soap and sinks
18:15
around a golf course with you
18:18
um president eisenhower um was on the
18:20
board of the
18:21
augusta national golf club in georgia
18:23
and there's a tree on this golf course
18:24
that he kept hitting
18:25
so he thought it was on the way so
18:27
during a board meeting he asked if it
18:28
could be chopped down
18:29
and the chairman was too embarrassed to
18:30
just say no because he was the president
18:31
so instead he just immediately ended the
18:33
meeting really yeah
18:34
i was just dropping out i'm pretty sure
18:36
that tree got hit by lightning or
18:38
something
18:38
ice storm i think that's the uh that's
18:40
the official story
18:42
yeah yeah she got hit by the lightning
18:45
the german's gone
18:48
what happened to the chairman he was hit
18:49
by lightning
18:53
just very quickly i was just looking at
18:56
the hobbies of the two presidents who
18:57
didn't like golf to see what they did
18:59
in their spare time so one of them was
19:01
truman a woman once wrote to president
19:03
truman asking what he did in his spare
19:04
time
19:05
and he there was a reply from his
19:06
spokesperson who said the president has
19:08
no hobbies and his official duties leave
19:10
him little time for recreation
19:12
most of his activities are reported in
19:13
the daily newspapers where no doubt you
19:15
have read of them
19:16
that's the end of truman's no hobbies
19:18
that's a really good
19:19
reply isn't it that's what you want busy
19:22
making the country run
19:23
yeah i don't want that at all it's
19:24
snippy though it is a bit snippy
19:26
um but the other one is much better so
19:28
jimmy carter my favorite president
19:30
anyway
19:30
is into woodwork but really into
19:33
woodwork
19:33
so he makes all this furniture and he
19:36
sells it so he's made
19:38
um loads of cradles he made a four
19:40
poster bed that he sold for a quarter of
19:41
a million dollars
19:42
and he made a cradle in 2007 that he
19:45
sold for 320
19:46
000 now it is possible there's a slight
19:49
inflation on these prices given that
19:50
it's
19:51
made by jimmy carter and the money goes
19:52
to the charity i doubt it but
19:54
i think it's just good quality projects
19:57
i read about lyndon b johnson
19:58
apparently according to forbes um an
20:01
article on that um
20:02
his hobby was drunk driving around his
20:04
property
20:07
um yeah he had a ranch and he liked to
20:09
drink drive around there and
20:11
especially he had an amphibious car
20:13
which he would pretend that he was
20:15
accidentally driving into a lake
20:18
he would
20:25
quiz question about jimmy carter jimmy
20:28
carter is the 39th president of the
20:29
united states of america what first
20:31
does he bring as a president and this is
20:32
something to do with his personal first
20:34
woodwork expert that's probably i've
20:36
definitely phrased this question
20:38
yeah okay was he the first to write a
20:39
children's book no um
20:41
he was the first to put a bowling lane
20:44
in the white house
20:45
no basically he's the first president to
20:47
have been born in a hospital
20:50
39th president a lot of them were born
20:52
in wood cabins weren't they
20:54
all built by him
21:01
okay it is time for fact number three
21:04
and that is my fact
21:05
my fact is that when the poets shelly
21:08
and byron went on a rider's retreat to
21:10
lake geneva in 1816
21:12
the hotel opposite them hired out
21:14
telescopes to their guests
21:16
so that they could spy on them
21:19
it's so surreal so this by the way was a
21:22
very very famous trip
21:24
uh that shelly and byron had made
21:26
because they uh
21:27
they were sat in the house one night and
21:29
there were lots of storms that were
21:31
going on for about three days solid and
21:32
it's
21:33
during one of those storms that
21:34
shelley's girlfriend at the time
21:36
mary and byron and shelley started
21:39
coming up with
21:40
ghost stories and scary stories horror
21:42
stories and that's where frankenstein
21:43
was born
21:44
so the five guests uh there were three
21:46
great writers and then two really tragic
21:48
figures
21:48
one of whom was claire claremont who was
21:50
byron's flu so he'd impregnated and he
21:52
really wanted her to stop
21:54
trying to get off with him and she
21:55
followed him there and so he invited
21:57
this other guy
21:58
his doctor called polidori yes to act as
22:00
like a third wheel to make sure that
22:02
claire didn't get a chance to get byron
22:03
in a corner and snark him whatever
22:05
and yeah polidori had the most awful
22:07
time with byron employed as his doctor
22:09
and they were asked to write these ghost
22:11
stories on this night byron challenged
22:12
him to write a ghost story
22:13
and polidori wrote this story and wrote
22:16
the first ever vampire story in the
22:18
english language
22:19
and he just kind of forgot about it he
22:21
sent it to a friend when he got back to
22:23
the uk
22:23
and it got lost somewhere and then a few
22:25
years later it got published
22:27
in um this monthly magazine just under
22:29
the title of the vampire tale by lord
22:31
byron
22:31
and so polidori has spent you know many
22:34
years being so jealous of byron and
22:36
hating him resenting him
22:37
and then he finds that this one story is
22:39
written as published under byron's name
22:41
i like that sort of as a ghost story
22:42
that was accidentally ghostwritten
22:44
uh yeah yeah not really a ghost story
22:47
because there's no ghosts in it yeah
22:48
but yeah but anyway let's get back to um
22:50
this hotel
22:51
what's quite amazing about it is a i
22:53
didn't realize celebrity paparazzi
22:56
things were going on back then i think
22:58
byron is often credited as being a part
23:00
of the birth of that whole yeah
23:03
yeah he was basically the anna wintour
23:05
of the time
23:06
he was defining fashion purely by what
23:09
he would write
23:10
as reports of a sort of vanity fair
23:12
party or yeah exactly
23:14
right so they found not too long ago um
23:16
in the last couple of years
23:18
the addition of frankenstein that mary
23:20
shelley signed
23:21
for byron so she sent him a letter
23:24
saying i'd love to hear if you think
23:25
this is a good book
23:26
he never sent back a comment and then he
23:29
then
23:29
wrote someone asked him about the book
23:31
and he wrote his opinion to them
23:33
in that and he said me thinks it's a
23:34
wonderful work for a girl of 19.
23:37
so he did like it but i kind of
23:39
patronizingly liked it
23:42
also anyone who starts with me thinks i
23:44
know i was like is
23:53
she was pretty weird actually mary
23:54
shelley well i think she did a couple of
23:56
weird things
23:57
so percy drowned in a shipwreck
24:00
um after he died she bought this cliff
24:02
clifftop house in bournemouth and this
24:04
was in 1851
24:06
and then she moved there with her
24:08
children but she also moved the remains
24:10
of her parents there
24:11
so her parents were buried near king's
24:13
cross and she was just like well i'm
24:14
moving i guess i'll just bring my
24:16
parents along oh you mean as in she dug
24:17
up the graves
24:18
yeah she had the graves dug up and had
24:20
them re-buried in bournemouth
24:21
isn't that strange yeah well she also
24:23
kept uh percy shelley's heart
24:25
in her desk so the rumor goes i don't
24:28
think we have any evidence of that
24:30
okay because i think that more modern
24:31
historians would say they actually think
24:33
it was shelley's liver that they
24:34
mistakened
24:35
for a heart i think the story was told
24:36
by one of shelley's friends was that
24:37
when shelly was being cremated
24:38
his friend dived into the fire and
24:40
seized the heart so it's very possible
24:42
that he would have accidentally seized
24:43
the liver because they weren't very
24:44
anatomically good then anyway
24:46
and there's a big fire in the way so i
24:48
guess he just went for the first organ
24:49
he could get his hands on
24:51
yeah who knows byron had a coffin at the
24:52
end of his dining table they really kind
24:54
of loved that kind of stuff he he used
24:55
to get
24:56
skulls and have them converted into um
24:59
drinking
25:00
drinking cups yeah drinking cups in fact
25:02
he wanted percy shelley skull as well
25:04
but
25:04
he jumped into the fire accidentally
25:07
brought his
25:08
femur out yeah they were worried i've
25:11
got a straw
25:14
can i talk about my favorite spy
25:15
satellite and telescope
25:17
okay so you've been listening to all
25:19
this literature
25:20
right now if you've got more literature
25:22
the corona uh spy satellites
25:24
are reconnaissance satellites they were
25:26
kind of made in the 60s and 70s and they
25:27
were one of the first
25:28
reconnaissance satellites to be put up
25:29
into space and they had cameras in them
25:31
but they were normal kodak film cameras
25:33
so when all the pictures had been taken
25:34
the satellite would jettison out a
25:36
canister of film
25:37
which would fall to earth and so it
25:38
would come through the atmosphere and
25:39
then a parachute would open so it'd be
25:40
passing down
25:41
and then a plane would fly alongside it
25:43
and grab it out of the air
25:44
that is unbelievable i know
25:47
what what what yeah why would you fly
25:50
alongside it and not just wait for it to
25:52
land well
25:53
it meant that it was safer because there
25:54
was a risk of someone will pick it up
25:56
but there were there were examples of
25:57
them not catching it in mid-air and they
25:59
landed on like a farmer's land and stuff
26:01
and they used to write the words top
26:02
secret on it but they
26:03
stopped doing that because everyone kept
26:04
opening them yeah so have you ever seen
26:07
the um
26:07
the capsules which the cosmonauts came
26:10
down in
26:11
and then it would say in russian person
26:13
inside do not be scared
26:15
this is not an alien it's a cosmonauts
26:17
kind of thing that's amazing yeah yeah
26:18
he said that this is not an alien it's
26:20
something like that yeah yeah it's like
26:22
do you not be alarmed there may be a
26:23
person inside please help me give them
26:24
water and stuff do not lick balls
26:26
[Laughter]
26:29
um andrew hunter murray uh who's away at
26:32
the moment
26:32
he was telling me that nasa have a
26:34
telescope on a plane
26:36
so they fly the plane up and then they
26:38
start observing
26:39
through a telescope on the plane do you
26:41
have this on the list i don't i only put
26:43
my top one because i didn't think you'd
26:44
listen to me for that long
26:45
[Laughter]
26:48
i read an article from 1998 and it was
26:51
about people buying telescopes in
26:53
new york and 5 000 people had bought a
26:56
telescope
26:57
but because of the pollution you can't
26:58
see any stars
27:01
and so they asked a lot of these people
27:02
why have you bought telescopes and the
27:04
most common answer was to spy on my
27:06
neighbors
27:06
really yeah there was a survey done in
27:08
switzerland that
27:10
asked people if they spied on their
27:11
neighbors and 22 percent of people
27:12
admitted that they did
27:14
actively use equipment like binoculars
27:16
or camera phones or through the spy
27:18
holes in their door um and they were
27:20
asked why they spied on their neighbors
27:22
and in switzerland the most popular
27:24
reason for spying was to check out a
27:25
neighbor's plants
27:28
28 of people that feels like a swiss
27:30
euphemism for something
27:32
look at the plots they did the same
27:35
study in the uk and a third of people
27:37
said they spy on their neighbors and in
27:38
the uk
27:39
the most commonly given reason is to
27:41
check they're all right
27:43
it's to check open brackets if they're a
27:45
bit off close brackets all right
27:52
okay it is time for our final fact of
27:54
the show and that
27:55
is chizinski my fact this week is that
27:58
famous historical games of
27:59
go include the blood vomiting game the
28:02
ear reddening game
28:03
the famous killing game and the atomic
28:06
bomb game
28:07
so this is about the game go which is a
28:10
very famous game comes from china
28:12
originally it's the oldest board game in
28:14
the world that's still being placed
28:15
in that pokemon go then uh sorry no
28:18
that's obviously one of the oldest games
28:19
in the world
28:20
still being played it feels like to some
28:22
of us
28:23
but no and there have been games
28:25
documented throughout history for
28:26
hundreds of hundreds of years
28:28
and there are these famous historical
28:29
games so what were they again
28:31
uh so the blood vomiting game okay so
28:33
what happens in the blood vomiting game
28:35
it's a lot like it sounds
28:36
it was in 1835 and it was a game where
28:39
there were two players one was beating
28:41
the other and then the other had these
28:42
four spectacular moves and the first
28:44
move was a move that his school of go
28:46
had been planning for months and months
28:48
so he won that and then the next three
28:49
moves were given to him by ghosts
28:51
so he won those three as well because
28:53
ghost came down and helped him out so he
28:54
won that game
28:56
i read that sentence yeah and i just sat
28:58
back
28:59
and just let it soak in it's the most
29:01
enjoyable little nugget i've read in a
29:02
fact for a very long time why is that
29:04
not cheating i don't understand how
29:05
that's like well because because in go
29:07
it turns out that you are allowed help
29:08
from other people you just need to pause
29:10
the game
29:11
just to jump forward very quickly i
29:12
think we should stick on the blood
29:13
vomiting game for a minute but to jump
29:15
forward to the ear reddening game
29:17
that game took three months to play yeah
29:19
it took three months because each player
29:21
was allowed a 24-hour
29:23
period of thinking time in between each
29:25
move and they took it
29:26
worst spectator sport ever if you
29:29
brought a day ticket
29:30
yeah and what they were doing that
29:32
24-hour periods is often
29:34
the person who was playing would go back
29:36
into
29:37
their wherever they lived and they would
29:38
have a group of students
29:40
study the game up to the point it was at
29:43
and they would then decide on what
29:44
potential
29:45
new moves could be done the next move
29:47
and just to finish off the blood
29:48
vomiting game if anyone's still
29:49
wondering about the name
29:50
um so as this guy started to lose uh he
29:53
keeled over collapsed on the board and
29:55
started coughing up blood
29:56
and he was dead within a couple of
29:58
months i thought he probably had tb but
30:00
it might have been just the pain of
30:01
losing
30:02
yeah and the ear reddening game that dan
30:04
mentioned is called that this was in
30:05
1846 it was a hot century
30:07
for go but in 1846 it was a game that a
30:10
doctor happened to be watching and
30:12
everyone else who was watching it
30:13
thought that one guy would lose
30:14
and the doctor said no i think the other
30:16
guy is going to lose and people said why
30:18
and he said because i saw his ears flush
30:20
red when his opponent made a move and
30:22
that means
30:22
he's distressed and indeed he was right
30:24
so that's the ear reddening game
30:26
and then sadly the famous killing game
30:27
is just a really intense game wow so
30:29
he glowed under stress as well like the
30:32
spacecraft
30:33
that's amazing yeah maybe that's how you
30:35
stress out a bit of cress
30:36
you just beat it at go yeah should we
30:39
quickly explain what go is
30:40
yeah yes just very very simply it's a
30:43
board game
30:43
a bit like chess or drafts and each
30:46
player has
30:46
white or black pebbles and you put them
30:49
on the board
30:50
it's quite complicated but the basic
30:52
thing is you're trying to encircle your
30:54
opponent's pieces yeah and get territory
30:57
yeah encircle bits of territory um and
31:00
it's like one
31:01
go at a time and it's incredibly simple
31:03
the rules but very complex as james says
31:05
to get good at it the strategy is
31:07
unbelievably complex and the
31:08
the famous thing recently is it's really
31:10
hard for computers to play
31:12
uh because there are so many different
31:14
possible combinations of moves
31:16
and one move that you do now in 100 days
31:19
time
31:20
could be really important in ways that
31:22
you haven't foreseen
31:23
and so the computers can't work it out
31:25
although recently i think they might
31:27
have won did they yeah
31:28
i think this was a bit of a blow for the
31:30
go community
31:31
but alphago which is made by google's
31:33
artificial intelligence arm and it's
31:35
alphago
31:36
this thing that beat this korean guy lee
31:38
sedol and then so lisa doll is currently
31:40
ranked fourth in the world
31:42
and the person who's ranked first in the
31:44
world is called kg
31:45
and i'm really sorry that's
31:46
mispronounced he's 18 and
31:48
he said when he saw alphago being so
31:50
good i don't want to play alpha go
31:52
because i know that i'm better than
31:54
alphago i've watched his matches with
31:55
lee
31:55
and alphago is weaker than me and i
31:57
don't want him stealing my moves
31:59
so he's backed out of it so this sounds
32:00
quite familiar from when i used to play
32:02
chess as a child and my little brother
32:04
started beating me
32:05
and so i kept playing until i beat him
32:07
once and said well now
32:08
i'm the reigning champion i don't want
32:09
to play anymore
32:13
but if you look at the rankings i think
32:15
they're on official rankings but you can
32:16
look at say the top
32:18
200 or whatever and they're all from
32:20
either china
32:21
japan or korea apart from the world
32:24
number two
32:25
which is alphago which is technically a
32:28
british player
32:29
woohoo we're number two number two
32:32
that's very good
32:32
yeah um can i bring up another game that
32:34
you mentioned in the headline facts
32:35
sorry the atomic bomb game the atomic
32:37
bomb game this is amazing so they were
32:39
in hiroshima they were in the outer
32:41
suburbs they're about
32:42
five kilometers from where impact ground
32:45
zero was for
32:46
the bomb detonating so they were mid
32:49
game
32:49
and suddenly the bomb goes off and there
32:52
was damage to their building
32:53
people were injured around them this is
32:55
what's remarkable they resumed
32:57
play after a lunch break yep and then it
32:59
was by the police
33:01
coming around saying you need to go
33:03
elsewhere and they just went further out
33:05
to continue the game
33:06
just on artificial intelligence and
33:08
computers that we're talking about as
33:10
james was saying goes quite a hard game
33:11
to beat with a computer
33:12
there is a game that was specifically
33:13
designed to be difficult for computers
33:15
to be by a guy called
33:16
omar syed who was inspired by watching
33:19
uh deep blue defeat kasparov
33:21
and so he invented this game called
33:22
arima which is it can be played on a
33:24
chessboard and it's basically a bit like
33:25
chess but there are different pieces
33:26
there's the
33:27
like an elephant and a camel and a horse
33:29
and uh dogs and cats the idea is that
33:30
it's supposed to be difficult for
33:31
computers to play but easy for humans
33:33
okay and because the computer can't use
33:36
kind of like tree logic by
33:37
looking up every single different
33:38
combination and then working out what
33:39
the best one is by comparing them all
33:41
um it's slightly intuitive but despite
33:43
that a computer eventually won in 2015
33:45
they had an international competition
33:46
every year there were three competitions
33:48
there would be a human only competition
33:49
a computer only competition and then the
33:51
third one where computers versus humans
33:53
and um for ages computers always lost
33:56
and then in 2015 they won it would be
33:58
good if they had
33:58
olympic boxing and then robot was and
34:01
then the best olympic boxer fought
34:03
against the best robot
34:04
guy that'll be amazing well they do
34:06
robot football slash soccer
34:08
now don't they and they do have the
34:11
robots play
34:11
a human team and levin skyra who is a
34:14
very good friend of ours been on the
34:15
show a few times he reckons
34:17
uh that by 2050 uh the robots will beat
34:21
the human team
34:21
yeah he does say that although they do
34:24
look hilariously bad
34:27
it's like just putting a bunch of pigs
34:30
into
34:30
a football arena and saying try and
34:32
score they just have no
34:34
interest in scoring they have no
34:35
anything they're just running into walls
34:38
um pigs do play football sometimes don't
34:40
they i knew i knew i'd say something
34:42
that would
34:42
i would hope make no sense and james
34:44
would come in saying actually
34:46
i think by law you're supposed to give
34:48
them things to play with because they
34:49
get bored
34:50
and quite often they give them balls and
34:51
they kind of like to nuzzle them around
34:53
and
34:53
i'm pretty sure i've seen a video of
34:54
pigs playing football wow maybe they're
34:56
just licking them because they think
34:57
it's good luck
35:03
okay that's it that's all of our facts
35:05
thank you so much for listening
35:06
if you would like to get in contact with
35:08

such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:16
coming to you from the qi offices
00:18
in covent garden my name is dan
00:20
schreiber i am sitting here
00:22
with james harkin anna chazinski and
00:24
alex bell

00:28
i'm back from edinburgh i'm back from
00:30
edinburgh
00:31
it's andy murray i don't recognize that
00:35
name
00:35
and andy murray and once again we have
00:38
gathered around the microphones with our
00:40
four
00:40
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:42
and in no particular order
00:44
here we go starting with you james
00:46
harkin
00:47
okay my fact this week is that
00:49
neanderthals wore capes
00:52
[Laughter]
00:54
do they only wear capes i think they
00:57
kind of did
00:58
and it seems like is that a good look is
01:00
that a sexy look
01:01
i'm just trying to make sure extra
01:02
obscene if you're only wearing a cape i
01:04
think
01:04
do you think worse than nudity i think
01:06
it's worse than you know it's worse than
01:07
being naked with just socks on like
01:09
that's that's what it is
01:10
that looks terrible having one item is
01:12
always just a bit embarrassing
01:14
absolutely no okay it's quite a good
01:16
look because you can wrap it around
01:17
yourself and then do the big reveal
01:20
um so neanderthals yeah they were capes
01:22
they did um compared to early humans who
01:25
were like more like parkers
01:27
or hoodies so the thing is they found by
01:30
looking at animal remains in
01:32
early human settlements and neanderthal
01:34
settlements and they found that the
01:36
neanderthals didn't really have the
01:37
ability to make more complex clothing
01:39
like the humans could
01:40
all they could really do is get a an
01:43
animal skin and just wrap it around
01:44
their neck like a cape
01:45
whereas the humans could kind of make
01:47
more proper clothing
01:49
and they reckon that this may be one of
01:51
the reasons why the neanderthals died
01:53
out
01:53
when the humans proliferated kind of
01:56
ironic that they don
01:57
superhero gear in order to wipe
01:58
themselves out what a bunch of idiots
02:00
i read a thing about uh superhero capes
02:03
and it was
02:04
um a physicist who did an analysis on
02:06
batman's cape
02:08
it worked out that if as in the film he
02:10
used the cape to help slow himself down
02:11
he would still have hit
02:12
the building he was landing on at 50
02:14
miles an hour which would have
02:15
immediately killed him
02:16
i don't think i mean i think we're
02:18
assuming when we watch that there's some
02:19
magical force holding him up as well as
02:21
just the sheer force of his capability
02:22
he's just a bloke let's not forget
02:24
batman is
02:24
is is a bloke he's not like superman
02:26
with superpowers he's just a guy with
02:28
tons of money oh i kind of thought he
02:30
had a little bit of extra magic power as
02:32
well
02:33
his sole superpower is material wealth
02:37
um just i thought the really interesting
02:40
thing about this
02:41
new research that's been done was the
02:43
idea that early humans
02:44
the real superheroes of this story had
02:46
fur trim
02:48
hoodies it's thought fur trim coats
02:50
because uh what the researchers found is
02:52
that
02:52
certain animals were found at human
02:54
sites that weren't found at neanderthal
02:56
sites so i think
02:57
there were animals like weasels and
02:59
wolverines that were found on the human
03:01
sites and uh they have like short hairs
03:02
another kind of hair that you'd use to
03:04
make a fur trim
03:05
so um they've got this whole mixture of
03:08
fur and if it's added to sleeves and the
03:10
hoods of clothes then
03:11
it insulates you better how are they how
03:13
are they sewing
03:14
or putting stuff together well do you
03:17
know that the oldest sewing needle was
03:19
found around this time around 40
03:20
000 years ago really actually it was
03:22
found more recently but it was left
03:25
no no sorry it was found 40 000 years
03:27
ago but immediately
03:28
dropped i again
03:32
that but weirdly it wasn't uh early
03:34
humans or
03:35
um neanderthals it was uh denis soviets
03:38
uh who were a third group of hominids
03:40
who kind of lived around the same time
03:43
were we were we the most clever of the
03:45
bunch at that period
03:46
they definitely have bigger brains than
03:48
we did well they have bigger brains
03:49
neanderthals but
03:50
there is a theory that because they have
03:52
bigger bodies as well
03:54
and they had larger eyes too so they had
03:56
extremely good vision but there's a
03:57
theory that more of their brain would
03:58
have had to be given over to
04:00
their visual cortex and to controlling
04:02
uh their body as well
04:03
so they were great at kind of gymnastics
04:05
or
04:07
seeing things from a long distance but
04:08
the neonatal olympics were
04:10
brilliant and all the audience were five
04:12
miles away as well
04:13
but on the other hand they couldn't do
04:15
rubik's cubes ah and obviously that
04:18
really got humans through the ice age
04:20
when it was very boring and you had to
04:21
have entertainment
04:23
yeah i think uh scientists come forward
04:25
in the last year slightly
04:26
deep not debunking but saying there's no
04:28
actual evidence to show that
04:30
increased focus on your brain on
04:31
eyesight or body size would mean that
04:33
you had a less good higher cortex but
04:35
it's certainly a theory
04:36
yeah that's the thing it just changes
04:37
all the time probably everything we're
04:39
saying right now is just going to be
04:41
particularly with neanderthals yeah
04:43
every day there's a new
04:45
story that says oh they were killed by
04:47
bunnies or
04:49
they loved it have you not heard that
04:51
theory no no oh they were killed by
04:52
rabbits
04:54
it has to do with the fact that they
04:55
couldn't uh i think i'm gaining this
04:57
in the sort of area of right uh their um
05:01
main source of food also became the main
05:03
source of food that rabbits were eating
05:04
and rabbits were eating all the food and
05:06
so they just ran out of food effectively
05:08
so rabbits kind of took
05:10
i don't know here's the thing if you try
05:12
to live off rabbits your whole
05:13
life you wouldn't be able to because
05:14
they don't contain nearly enough uh
05:16
nutrients
05:17
unless they've eaten all of your other
05:19
food and so they contain all the food
05:20
groups now inside of their bodies
05:22
is this an all you can rabbit situation
05:24
yeah if if the only thing you could ever
05:26
eat was rabbits you would die
05:27
no and you die quite quickly as well i'm
05:30
not sure exactly what it is that you're
05:31
missing i think there's a famous kind of
05:33
thought experiment about rabbits in
05:34
particular
05:36
really and lots of other things
05:37
presumably or rather it's the only the
05:39
only ones trying to screw us over yeah
05:40
you could probably live
05:41
just off guinness yeah okay so they
05:43
always say that they always say
05:45
they say like two pints of guinness and
05:46
three mars bars will get you through
05:48
yeah the rest of your life but it
05:49
doesn't sound like irish people
05:53
did you know because people always used
05:54
to say oh drinking a guinness is the
05:56
same as having seven roast dinners or
05:57
something
05:58
that there's the same number of calories
06:00
in a pint of
06:01
tenants or a point of fosters is there
06:02
isn't a planet guinness
06:04
what didn't i always thought there was
06:06
way more in guinness yeah it feels like
06:08
there's more when you drink it doesn't
06:09
it yeah it does
06:10
does it yeah i don't i don't know you
06:13
had a full pint of beer for your
06:14
birthday the other day didn't you
06:15
yeah fruit beer you know
06:19
i really like this clothing thing
06:20
because it's sort of interesting in the
06:22
knock-on effects that things have so
06:24
if neanderthals only had capes yeah as
06:27
we're saying
06:29
um then they might have only been able
06:32
to hunt during the very warmest bits of
06:33
the day
06:34
so that limits your hunting range
06:36
time-wise it means you can't hunt in the
06:37
morning or the evening
06:38
or it might have stopped them foraging
06:40
further north whereas if you've got
06:41
humans in
06:42
sort of parka like things they can hunt
06:44
for the north that extends the range
06:45
or in that part of europe uh ambush is
06:49
quite a good means of
06:50
killing prey because you use the
06:51
landscape and you wait for animals to
06:52
come along and then you jump out and
06:53
kill them
06:54
rather than chasing them as early humans
06:56
did in africa for example
06:58
so if you're just lying down in a cape
07:01
all day yeah you can't do it you're
07:02
freeze
07:03
do you remember there's that book that
07:04
came out called the singing neanderthals
07:06
yes yeah so this is a professor from
07:09
reading university called stephen mithan
07:11
and he believes that they sung a lot and
07:14
they like to dance
07:15
dance and clap and uh and they used to
07:18
do in their caves together they used to
07:19
sing in groups
07:20
i have read that book quite a few years
07:22
ago and i think is it not also that
07:24
um he thinks that language came
07:26
originally from singing yes
07:27
so people would just kind of sing and
07:29
get rhythm and then that rhythm and
07:31
noise would turn into
07:32
meanings and then that meaning would
07:34
turn into language i think that's what
07:36
yeah yeah he so for that reason as well
07:38
the language part he says that he thinks
07:39
that they would particularly have liked
07:41
rap music
07:42
um he says i can see them rapping in my
07:45
mind
07:46
he thinks a lot of stuff this guy um
07:49
neanderthal males had one massive arm
07:51
and one
07:52
puny one no like nadal like madonna
07:56
exactly like nadal athletes cricket and
07:58
tennis players in particular
08:00
have um upper arm bones which are much
08:03
stronger in their dominant arms right of
08:05
course
08:05
so um all of us here our dominant arm
08:07
will be between five and fourteen
08:09
percent bigger
08:10
uh this is the arm bone uh the the upper
08:12
arm bone uh
08:13
bigger than on the other side right in
08:15
neanderthals the upper arm bone is
08:17
50 percent bigger than on the other side
08:21
and this is only the case in qriket and
08:23
tennis players in modern humors today so
08:25
when you say nadal is absolutely right
08:26
and they thought that this was because
08:28
they were doing spear thrusting right to
08:30
to hunt animals but actually they got
08:32
modern humans to sort of practice
08:34
thrusting spears and
08:35
measured how much energy it used and
08:36
actually that uses the non-dominant arm
08:38
loads too
08:39
so they reckon that what it is is
08:41
processing animal hides
08:42
i.e scraping laboriously away at the
08:45
inside of animal skins to make them
08:47
suitable for wearing your capes
08:48
and we don't know if female neanderthals
08:50
had the same thing because we haven't
08:52
found
08:52
female neanderthal skeletons where both
08:54
arms are present
08:56
yeah do we know that female neanderthals
08:58
had two arms no we don't no
09:00
that might be a reason why they died out
09:04
just one thing on capes that capes were
09:06
quite big in the aztec world
09:08
and montezuma particularly was into them
09:10
in that every year he collected a
09:12
tribute from his people of
09:14
2560 of them the word escape comes from
09:18
the word cape
09:19
does it it's like when someone grabs
09:22
your cape but you could run away because
09:23
you kind of leave them with the cape
09:25
then you're just naked if you're a
09:26
neanderthal that what that's actually
09:29
yeah according to the um etymological
09:32
dictionary of the english language to
09:34
escape
09:35
is to escape oneself to slip out of your
09:37
cape and run away
09:40
isn't that great yeah were there any
09:42
famous villains that were known for that
09:44
like like i mean like jack the river
09:46
we've got his cape you know
09:47
was there any like just with the cape
09:49
done by poppers at the front or
09:50
something that they just
09:51
whip off and leave just if that's jack
09:53
the stripper you're thinking
09:57
but another kind of cape in the aztec
09:59
world the only aztec rulers were allowed
10:01
to wear was the hummingbird cape and so
10:02
hummingbirds were
10:04
um sort of revered by aztecs because i
10:06
think of their tenacity and the fact
10:07
that they'd attack things that were
10:08
bigger than them and they wouldn't
10:10
rest until they'd got what they wanted
10:12
and so
10:13
aztec kings could wear capes made
10:14
entirely of hummingbird feathers i think
10:16
i've seen one of those
10:18
yeah they're pretty spectacular i think
10:19
there might be one in um
10:21
a museum in hawaii or something oh
10:23
really like
10:24
really yellow amazing kind of feathery
10:27
um wow having birds i think are they are
10:30
they the only bird that can fly
10:31
backwards
10:32
yeah um but yeah one cape would take
10:34
eight thousand hummingbirds
10:37
how do you it's quite impressive to
10:38
catch though that many though it is
10:41
sneak up on them from the front
10:46
um elvis presley famously used to wear a
10:49
cape
10:49
yeah in the later years um and the very
10:52
first time that they had the idea for
10:53
the cape because the idea was that it
10:55
was going to be used to reveal himself
10:56
not in that way on stage um to the
10:59
audience so it was a great way of hiding
11:00
himself before
11:02
because you can still see the cape
11:03
obviously yeah i guess but you're like
11:05
who's behind the cape i mean
11:07
they know they're at a presley game
11:11
all right figures is that with the cape
11:12
um so he commissioned it from this guy
11:14
who was um in another bit of america and
11:17
so they made the cape
11:18
and they sent it over on a plane and
11:20
elvis put it on
11:21
and it was so heavy that as he walked
11:22
forward he immediately got dragged back
11:24
by the weight of it and
11:26
crashed backwards onto the ground oh
11:28
yeah like who did that in the vmas last
11:30
year or something was it madonna i think
11:32
philadelphia i think she just fell down
11:33
forward did she not get dragged no she
11:35
got dragged off by a case she did
11:36
someone stepped on the back of her cape
11:38
maybe it was just a tribute to elvis
11:42
uh someone else who had a massive cape
11:43
on stage was liberace
11:46
famously he one time had such a massive
11:48
cape
11:49
uh he was brought on stage uh in a
11:51
custom-made rolls-royce
11:53
and then he took off his cape which was
11:55
then taken off stage by a smaller rolls
11:57
royce
11:57
[Music]
11:59
that was fantastic that's
12:02
ridiculous i was looking at um sherlock
12:04
holmes because he wore a cape
12:06
yes described as eric and he was
12:08
illustrated wearing a very
12:10
sort of famous cape i think it became
12:12
famous because he'd worn it i don't
12:13
think it
12:14
was a famous cake that sherlock holmes
12:16
adopted
12:17
who was this weird bloke inside my
12:19
favorite cape
12:22
um sorry you're absolutely right he he
12:24
popularized that cake but
12:26
for something there was something really
12:29
bizarre about the stories in the the man
12:31
who was commissioned
12:32
to draw the stories ended up not drawing
12:34
them his brother
12:36
sort of got the gig somehow instead but
12:38
then he drew
12:40
the man who'd originally been
12:41
commissioned to draw the cape
12:43
was then the model for the cape which
12:46
his brother then ended up drawing for
12:47
the stories was that a consolation prize
12:49
thing
12:49
kind of his brother was like oh sorry i
12:51
didn't get the gig
12:52
these victorian because there was a coat
12:54
with a cape built into it
12:56
yes yeah i don't really understand it is
12:58
it just to protect you against rain or
13:00
just fashion yeah muslim and fashion
13:02
yeah because i i
13:04
exactly i was trying to work out was
13:05
there a purpose to darth vader's cape
13:08
and a lot of people he's in space what's
13:10
he doing with the cape
13:11
there's a lot of anti-gravity going on
13:13
that's not a useful
13:14
garment to have a lot of people say that
13:16
it was because of his authority and that
13:18
a cape would suggest a military kind of
13:20
authority
13:21
but then i i don't really know much
13:23
about star
13:24
wars but um it doesn't seem like they
13:28
have a lot of problem with anti-gravity
13:29
at any stage
13:31
which is it's interesting isn't it the
13:32
one scene where i think you should see
13:34
that is when he's flying
13:35
when vader's in his own ship because i
13:38
imagine that's where anti-gravity kicks
13:39
in but he must be sitting on the cape
13:41
that's what i thought because you don't
13:42
see it in shots you're right because
13:44
they must have thought this through
13:45
well they have because look there's a
13:46
description on wikipedia about
13:49
his entire outfit um so the outer cape
13:52
was made
13:53
so that it could block fire and acid
13:55
jets um
13:56
helping to protect the suit's
13:58
electronics because remember darth vader
13:59
was part robot
14:01
and um yeah but the cape was so heavy
14:03
you get this the cape was so heavy
14:05
that uh it restricted movement so he had
14:07
difficulty lifting his arms over his
14:09
head which is why you rarely see that in
14:11
the movies
14:11
really i can't really see a scene where
14:13
that would have fitted in is the ymca
14:17
that's what he's at that football match
14:18
at the mexican wave comes around this
14:20
way
14:23
[Music]
14:24
[Applause]
14:26
okay it is time for fact number two and
14:28
that is cecinski
14:30
my fact this week is that when the first
14:31
ballpoint pen was launched in the us
14:34
riot police had to be deployed to
14:35
restrain the crowd
14:37
[Laughter]
14:39
it was it was the new iphone of its day
14:41
this was in 1945 and i actually read
14:44
about this in a book i've just bought
14:45
called adventures in stationery by james
14:48
ward
14:48
and this ballpoint pen was brought to
14:50
america by a guy called milton reynolds
14:52
it was 29th of october 1945
14:55
and he launched it in a department store
14:58
called
14:58
gimbals in new york and thousands of
15:01
people came so i think 5
15:03
000 people swarmed gimbal's department
15:04
store and 50 extra policemen had to be
15:07
deployed as an emergency at the last
15:08
minute because it was being swarmed so
15:10
much
15:10
so they cost the equivalent of a hundred
15:11
and sixty dollars now which is a lot but
15:13
still they sold
15:14
you know they'd sold millions that make
15:16
sense presumably they weren't yeah the
15:18
really
15:18
crummy cheap buyers that you're paying
15:20
160 for
15:22
well even i mean that was a time of some
15:23
hardship across the world
15:25
what he was thinking actually you say of
15:27
some hardship a they didn't work
15:29
because he rushed them through but b i
15:31
think he was thinking it's the end of
15:32
the war i need to launch it now people
15:34
want a treat
15:36
well that wall was terrible but at least
15:38
we've got a
15:39
it's almost worth having another one
15:43
he um it was called the reynolds rocket
15:45
though so there was a little bit of
15:47
militarization going on in there
15:48
oh yeah he actually took out an ad in
15:51
the
15:51
new york times to promote a full-page ad
15:54
that's how big they were
15:55
promoting the thing and in it he said
15:57
that it was fantastic
15:58
miraculous pen guaranteed to write for
16:00
two years without refilling
16:03
yeah and you got your money back if it
16:04
didn't and a lot of people did didn't
16:06
they
16:07
yeah loads of people yes 104 643
16:11
had to be replaced in the first eight
16:13
months
16:14
so i think yeah it had massive problems
16:16
it was really leaky um or it would stop
16:18
writing altogether
16:19
it just wasn't a very good design and
16:21
the reason was because he was a very
16:22
competitive businessman
16:24
so there was this chap called laszlo
16:26
bairo who a few years beforehand had
16:28
invented the biro in europe and he
16:30
brought it to argentina and word had
16:31
reached america
16:32
and this guy milton reynolds of the biro
16:34
and he really wanted to patent the
16:36
design
16:36
which was just this round tip and this
16:38
capillary action which meant that you
16:40
could write in all directions
16:41
and the ink wouldn't bleed out onto the
16:43
page anyway he tried to like buy the
16:44
patent for the design and it had already
16:46
been
16:46
sold and so he was so pissed off he
16:48
decided to rush through his own design
16:50
before bayer could get his out
16:52
so he knew that byron in 1945 which was
16:55
now run by
16:56
a company called evershard i think he
16:58
knew that they were about to rush a
16:59
design out and so he put his out
17:01
prematurely
17:01
but the thing was that his didn't use
17:03
capillary action he's relied on gravity
17:06
so darth vader wouldn't be able to use
17:07
it for instance
17:09
indeed that's why you never saw him
17:11
signing papers
17:12
actually there is a theory which andy
17:14
was just pointing so i bet he was about
17:15
to say this yeah there is no writing in
17:17
the whole
17:18
star wars universe theory is a
17:19
post-literary universe
17:21
you just see people pointing at you know
17:23
pressing buttons with little symbols on
17:24
them
17:25
right apparently there are some scrolls
17:27
that the jedi's
17:28
you can see it in the background
17:29
occasionally that there's a scroll there
17:31
but whether they have writing on we
17:32
don't know but also you can see
17:34
in this is getting too geeky now but you
17:36
can see in raiders of the lost ark when
17:38
they have the ark of the covenant
17:39
there are symbols on the ark of the
17:40
covenant of r2d2 and c3po
17:42
so they've now put that in a suggested
17:45
lucas arts um
17:46
timeline of the universe so a long time
17:48
ago in the galaxy far far away
17:50
was remembered close enough on earth
17:52
that they knew about 3po and r2d2 so
17:54
it's not that long ago
17:58
yeah so when you said this is too giggy
18:00
i was about to say
18:01
no it can't be too geeky for this show
18:03
but
18:04
you managed to do it so the first one of
18:08
the first big orders uh for buyers was
18:10
by the raf actually during the second
18:13
world war so this was by the
18:14
uh uh laszlo bureau uh inventor himself
18:19
i think it's originally pronounced we've
18:21
been saying it wrong all these years
18:22
probably lashlow as well
18:24
i think i think it's biro probably he
18:26
was hungarian well he was
18:28
born in budapest right who's hungarian
18:30
then he moved to argentina so this is a
18:32
really weird thing
18:32
also about the way he uh invented it he
18:35
i mean he had to flee
18:36
the nazis and he went to argentina
18:38
partly because he'd had a chance
18:40
encounter on a beach
18:41
uh with a fellow holidaymaker and told
18:43
him about this great invention he had
18:44
and the fellow holiday maker said oh
18:46
well i'm the president of argentina so
18:48
you know jonathan set up in my country
18:50
and he said thank you very much i will
18:52
it's not amazing it's extraordinary just
18:53
yeah they're on the beach and they're
18:55
happy to be chatting to the argentinian
18:57
president yeah
18:58
he was the former president yeah
19:01
but then really tragically bureau never
19:02
made much money from it because he had
19:04
sold
19:05
uh the patent to it very early on in the
19:07
process because partly i think to get
19:08
more of his family out of europe
19:10
i think his last shares were sold to get
19:12
his family to argentina yeah
19:14
i really love them i love the sound of
19:16
this guy bureau because
19:17
apparently before he invented the biro
19:19
he was a hypnotist
19:21
a race car driver and a surrealist
19:22
painter wow
19:25
that's awesome sounds amazing and you'll
19:27
like how he invented the ballpoint pen
19:29
undies he was just sat there looking out
19:31
of a window
19:32
and he saw a marble go through a puddle
19:34
and then it left a line of water on the
19:36
ground
19:37
and he thought wait a minute i could
19:38
make a pen like that did he now yeah
19:40
because
19:41
andy you really hate these ideas of
19:42
serendipity in in
19:44
fact i just think that often inventions
19:47
are
19:48
it's it's it's so much nicer the story
19:50
of beerus seeing a child playing with
19:52
marbles and the marble going through the
19:53
puddle and
19:54
who knows that may all be the case but
19:55
often you get the whole oh yes he had
19:57
invented a whole load of fountain pens
19:59
and then one of them was dropped and it
20:00
created a weird ball on the end of it he
20:02
thought oh i know
20:04
yeah cause byro didn't actually invent
20:05
the ballpoint pen or he wasn't the first
20:07
person to come up with a patent for it
20:09
no it was john loud yes who
20:12
did have the first patent and he wanted
20:14
something that would be able to write
20:16
on wrapping paper um and he invented
20:19
this thing but unfortunately it was just
20:20
a rubbish design
20:22
there were 350 ballpoint patents before
20:25
bureau came out really yeah yeah from
20:28
you're right john john loud in um
20:30
i think the 1880s all the way through to
20:32
the 1930s
20:34
the idea had been thought of a lot it's
20:35
just no one have made it work properly
20:36
yeah
20:37
so it's weird that he had to wait for a
20:39
marble to propel itself through a puddle
20:41
yeah that's a bit weird isn't it
20:42
considering there were 350 other
20:44
inventions exactly the same as his
20:46
bizarre it's almost as though that did
20:47
not happen
20:51
um have we ever talked about just
20:52
speaking of riots um and police having
20:54
to be called unexpectedly about the girl
20:56
who put a facebook invitation up and
20:58
accidentally made it public not private
21:00
the dutch girl
21:01
in 2012 and she got 30 000 people
21:04
responding saying that they would attend
21:06
about a party it was yeah it was about a
21:07
party but it meant to go to just her
21:09
friends and apparently you have some
21:10
private setting on facebook
21:11
um there's a movie about it isn't there
21:13
is there yeah i can't remember what it's
21:14
called
21:15
oh no it was based on that film so
21:17
that's why people did it and then they
21:18
turned up in t-shirts saying project
21:20
x haron because it was in the town of
21:22
haran and yeah
21:23
like up to 5 000 people turned up and
21:26
600 right police had to be called and
21:28
the girl fled her home
21:30
to somewhere else um because she'd
21:32
accidentally put this
21:33
invitation on private it sounds
21:34
absolutely terrifying yeah it happens
21:36
quite a lot
21:37
what five thousand people rocking up to
21:39
and it certainly doesn't my party
21:40
accidentally
21:41
you did say up to 5 5000 people i mean
21:44
even at
21:45
these parties there's up to 5 000 people
21:48
[Music]
21:51
[Applause]
21:52
okay it is time for fact number three
21:55
and that is my fact
21:56
my fact this week is that not only was
21:58
lady chatterley's lover banned from
22:00
australia
22:01
but a book about the band was also
22:03
banned
22:05
um yes so um lady chad lee's lover
22:08
famously a book that was banned in the
22:10
uk
22:10
it was banned in australia many other
22:12
countries and uh
22:13
what happened was in 1960 eventually
22:16
after i believe was 1929 it was
22:18
originally banned um
22:20
so huge amount of time and they finally
22:22
got the ban lifted
22:23
and it was such a weird trial everyone
22:26
who was at the trial reported about it
22:28
at the time in 1960 because they had
22:30
things like the fact that the jury who
22:32
were
22:32
forced to read the book weren't even
22:34
allowed to bring the book
22:36
out of the courtroom so the jury had to
22:38
just sit in the jury room
22:40
and read the book there was probably
22:41
somebody really smug jura who got to the
22:43
end of it first before everybody else
22:45
yeah just did all the spoilers she shags
22:48
him
22:50
that reminds me of something i read that
22:54
in the 90s or late 80s early 90s
22:58
there was a pornographic tv channel
23:00
called
23:01
red hot dutch which came over to britain
23:05
because people could get it with their
23:06
satellite dishes and there was a big
23:08
kind of
23:09
moral crusade against it in the
23:11
newspapers and stuff and before the
23:13
parliament could debate it
23:14
they had to have a special viewing of
23:17
the channel
23:18
in the houses of parliament and
23:19
apparently it was one of the most well
23:21
attended viewings of anything that they
23:23
ever had
23:24
i don't because oh you're allowed to
23:26
watch some really steamy hot dutch
23:28
pornography but you have to watch it in
23:29
a room
23:29
full of mps
23:32
i'm not sure i'd like attending the the
23:35
really
23:36
tricky thing when the book was going to
23:37
be published is that this was all after
23:39
a 1959 change in the law
23:41
which said that literary merit is a
23:44
defense
23:45
so it was an extremely sexual expressive
23:47
book it had been banned in 1929 but then
23:48
this change in the law and 59
23:50
meant that suddenly there was a possible
23:52
defense which means that it could be
23:54
published legally
23:55
and penguin then announced you know for
23:57
lauren's anniversary we are going to
23:59
publish a huge run of this and they were
24:01
intending to publish it for
24:02
i think three shillings and sixpence
24:04
which was really cheap and would have
24:06
put it well within the reach of uh
24:08
working-class people
24:09
so that was why the uh authorities
24:12
if you like were spooked yeah because
24:14
there was still the thing in law which
24:16
was an old victorian thing which was
24:19
it's all right for you to have something
24:20
which is explicit and obscene and
24:22
whatever
24:22
so long as only gentlemen can read it
24:24
but once you do it so that the poor
24:26
people can read it then it becomes a
24:27
problem
24:28
yeah and it's called variable really
24:30
obscenity
24:32
and so there's a very famous part of
24:33
that trial where um the chief prosecutor
24:36
who's called mervin griffith
24:37
jones asked the jurors to consider if it
24:40
was a kind of book that you would wish
24:41
your wife or servants to read
24:44
and in the newspapers they all thought
24:45
that was hilarious because you know this
24:47
is the 1960s we don't talk like that
24:48
anymore
24:49
but of course he was referring to the
24:50
old victorian law which was
24:52
is it something that working class
24:54
people or women or whatever can read as
24:56
opposed to gentlemen like me
24:58
yeah and so when they eventually lifted
25:00
the band and said it could be sold in
25:02
shots it's
25:03
it's not dissimilar to the great uh
25:05
ballpoint pen
25:07
debut indeed the jobs were packed people
25:09
were
25:10
not writing but it was there it was
25:11
chaotic and it was mainly men who just
25:13
heard so much about this book
25:15
and copies that had been bought with
25:17
them being resold
25:18
just the hour later in soho it's also a
25:21
very quick read
25:22
yes yeah but people right it's almost
25:24
like um when a huge superstar comes into
25:27
town you know scalpers buy up the
25:28
tickets and resell them for a hiked
25:30
price so in soho they were hiking the
25:32
price of these unread
25:33
books that had just been bought in the
25:35
london bookshops so just to
25:37
just to bring it back quickly to the
25:38
opening fact so what ended up happening
25:40
was that the ban was lifted
25:42
and that was great and someone then went
25:44
on to write a book
25:45
called the trial of lady chatterley's
25:47
lover
25:48
and that book then got released here in
25:50
the uk and it attempted to get released
25:52
in australia but australia had not
25:54
lifted their own ban
25:56
and so they decided to continue to ban
25:59
anything to do with lady chatterley and
26:00
that was one of the books
26:01
that wasn't allowed in so did this book
26:03
have like excerpts from the original do
26:05
you think
26:06
yeah no i'm not sure exactly what this
26:08
book contains it's actually quite hard
26:10
to find it online
26:11
well it's because you're part australian
26:12
done yes exactly
26:14
she's not allowed to read anything like
26:15
this yeah um
26:17
and yeah what's really nice about this
26:18
is that a group of australians
26:21
actually decided that they were going to
26:22
sneakily import it and start selling it
26:24
in
26:24
shops and they did and that kind of
26:27
created a new conversation once they got
26:29
caught because they were caught and
26:30
the government attempted to prosecute
26:32
them and they said
26:34
this shouldn't be done and a lot of
26:36
other politicians agreed and as a result
26:38
that's what's
26:39
kind of kick-started the whole thing
26:40
about the relaxation laws of the
26:42
obscenity laws in australia
26:44
so it's interesting lady chatterley
26:46
itself did it here and in australia a
26:48
book about the trial did it in australia
26:49
yeah it's kind of amazing you'd have
26:51
customs officials
26:52
taking banned books off people
26:55
apparently when
26:56
trains used to go um from europe into
26:58
the soviet union
27:00
um when they stopped on the border they
27:01
check your passports and there'd also be
27:03
a guy going through going
27:05
bibles and pornography bibles and
27:07
pornography
27:08
and so you had to give up your bibles or
27:10
pornography oh my god
27:12
apparently i know what it looks like
27:13
it's just actually a very broadly
27:15
interpreted bible
27:21
[Music]
27:22
[Applause]
27:23
okay it is time for our final fact of
27:25
the show and that is
27:27
andrew hunter murray my fact is that
27:29
henry viii contributed to nasa's space
27:31
suit design
27:33
i go on um so he had a suit of armor
27:36
which was uh built for him in 1520 for a
27:39
thing called the field of the cloth of
27:40
gold this huge diplomatic
27:42
jolly in france and um in 1962
27:45
uh one of the teams working on
27:47
spacesuits for nasa a firm called
27:49
garrett ai research
27:50
they visited the suit and uh the tower
27:53
of london sent the phone data on it and
27:55
they sent
27:55
photos of it because they were trying to
27:57
work out how to build
27:58
better suits which could you know
28:00
completely overlap and completely cover
28:02
the body
28:03
and that was sort of you know something
28:05
that went into their research yeah
28:06
that's so cool
28:07
yeah so now you're going to have
28:08
astronauts with massive cod pieces
28:10
yeah that'd be good though wouldn't it
28:12
be great so good
28:14
um he did have a bigger one than
28:16
everyone else didn't he the king had to
28:17
be shown with a bigger cod piece yeah
28:19
indeed women in subsequent centuries
28:22
used to
28:22
put little pinpricks in them and it was
28:24
hoped that that would make them fertile
28:26
and bring them babies that's the
28:27
isn't that at the tower of london yeah
28:29
an actual yeah were you there we were
28:31
shown around the tower
28:32
no when was that uh oh good few years
28:35
ago i was shown around
28:36
the royal armouries um with molly
28:38
oldfield i think for her book with the
28:40
secret museum
28:42
and they have the copies there and i
28:44
think they
28:45
have the actual one which the the pins
28:47
were pricked in oh really that's so cool
28:49
and really it had regular enemas from a
28:51
pig's bladder
28:52
um didn't he so i actually thought that
28:54
this fact was going to be i think i may
28:56
have misread your email
28:57
that the spacesuit was designed on henry
28:58
viii bottom and so i did quite a lot of
29:00
research into henry viii's bottom
29:04
um so i was also reading about his
29:06
toilet
29:07
and it's they were really lavish but i
29:09
didn't really understand this
29:10
i think this was from lucy wasley maybe
29:12
he said henry viii's lavatory was
29:13
lavishly covered in black velvet it's
29:15
lid
29:15
opened to reveal inside a padded and
29:18
ribboned interior
29:19
covered with the same material oh god
29:22
those ribbons are going to be very nice
29:23
for
29:24
what you saw
29:28
that's a really good point i mean i
29:30
think there must have been a hole in the
29:31
middle
29:31
which and maybe you had to aim well and
29:33
just make sure you didn't catch the
29:34
padding in the
29:35
ribbons on the outside maybe no yeah it
29:38
feels like with that many animals
29:39
his name wouldn't have been so good
29:45
how long after someone dies is it not
29:47
treason anymore
29:48
[Laughter]
29:51
um so he got very fat later in life yeah
29:54
he was quite athletic when he was young
29:56
wasn't he but he got really fat later on
29:58
and i read this um that there was a 2009
30:01
study by the royal armouries that found
30:03
that his
30:03
waist was 52 inches
30:06
okay that's by looking at one of his
30:08
suits of armor
30:09
but brilliantly by coincidence um queen
30:12
victoria's bloomers that went on sale
30:15
in 2012 were also a 52-inch waist
30:18
so they had exactly the same waistline
30:20
queen victoria and henry viii
30:22
so this fact is also about spacesuits
30:24
and nasa uh did you know
30:26
spaces these days are called emus that's
30:28
what modern spaces are referred to
30:30
in space you need to go and get into
30:32
your emu so i bet u is
30:33
unit not bad uh extra
30:37
yep what's it gonna be i'll leave the
30:39
next one to you anna
30:40
mission um memory
30:43
[Music]
30:45
i'm gonna put us all out of all of our
30:47
misery uh it's extra vehicular mobility
30:49
units
30:51
yeah so where's the v fmu
30:54
yeah yeah except there's not a bird but
30:57
that's not a lovable creature
31:00
if you want to study ants in using an
31:03
electron microscope
31:05
you would look at them in a vacuum and
31:08
to get them in a vacuum you have to put
31:10
them in a tiny little space suit
31:11
no well they call it a tiny spacesuit
31:14
it's like
31:15
you dip them in surfactant which is a
31:18
substance which causes like a tiny
31:19
little
31:20
nano suit basically that they go inside
31:24
uh and it actually can even repair
31:26
itself if it gets broken
31:27
um but yeah they call it a tiny little
31:29
ant
31:31
is it individual ones for individual
31:32
answers oh my goodness
31:34
i know that is so nice
31:37
uh have you seen i was looking at um
31:39
amusing looking space suit designs from
31:41
over the years and nasa have tried some
31:42
pretty wacky stuff but have you seen
31:44
the ax-5 hard shell spacesuit
31:48
we've seen we've seen the ax3 haven't we
31:49
but no we have here
31:51
i knew you weren't up to date on this um
31:53
so the ax-5 the point was that you
31:55
wanted to be flexible inside it so
31:56
that's often a problem in spacesuits
31:58
that you can't like move around enough
31:59
and it had a flexibility rating of 95
32:01
percent which means that the wearer can
32:03
move into 95 percent of the positions
32:05
that you can if you were naked
32:06
but what this basically means is if you
32:08
look it up
32:10
reverse cowgirl
32:14
what are the positions that you can't
32:16
get i don't know actually maybe they
32:18
don't tell you in case you try and break
32:19
it
32:20
i'm not sure i can get into all that
32:21
many positions even when naked
32:24
you might only have a 75 thing even
32:27
without the spacesuit on oh
32:28
god and each year as i get older it gets
32:33
less doesn't it
32:34
look it's a funny spacesuit it's not
32:35
that morbid it looks like someone's
32:38
inflated so if i were this
32:42
if i wear this 95 spacesuit does that
32:45
mean i can now get into more positions
32:49
i'm afraid it's not 95 of the average
32:51
person's it's 95 of your positions naked
32:54
you're naked is a hundred percent you
32:55
could barely do anything i could
32:57
actually
32:57
get down to about 71.5
32:59
[Laughter]
33:01
don't buy it if only you could transmute
33:03
your consciousness into an ax-5
33:05
spacesuit
33:06
then you'd be able to do more than you
33:08
could today
33:10
um how many how many percentages do you
33:13
think you could do
33:14
wearing just a cape that's uh
33:17
over 110.
33:22
i'm sorry spacesuit have you finished
33:24
that
33:25
i just need to describe how this works
33:28
because it's ridiculous
33:34
the ax-5 looks like a hugely inflated
33:36
michelin man
33:37
so essentially it's like being in a
33:39
giant bubble um where it seems like you
33:41
can pull most of your limbs out of the
33:43
sleeves instead of your legs out of the
33:45
legs and move around inside it
33:46
right but it looks totally absurd
33:48
because it looks like you've put on a
33:49
piece of clothing 20 sizes too big for
33:51
you so um
33:52
they decided not to not to let it go but
33:54
it's you know good amount of roominess
33:56
in there just with your head hanging
33:57
onto the helmet and the rest of your
33:58
body can swing around underneath it
34:00
that's a good idea actually yeah should
34:02
we wrap up yeah
34:04
oh do you know what the french for cod
34:05
pieces
34:07
i thought you'd get on that road
34:11
it's not it's bragette spelt the same as
34:13
baguette but with an
34:14
art which seems to have so much room for
34:17
confusion
34:18
for brilliant for a french
34:22
16th century sitcom wasn't it yeah a
34:24
stupid fast
34:25
just put a briguette of your penis and
34:27
get on with it
34:28
are you sure madame's halfway through
34:30
eating it
34:36

34:38

[Music]
00:12
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:15
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:17
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:19
covent garden my name is dan schreiber i
00:21
am sitting here with andrew hunter
00:23
murray anna chazinski and james harkin
00:26
and once again we have gathered around
00:27
the microphones with our four favorite
00:29
facts from the last seven days and in no
00:31
particular order here we go starting
00:34
with my fact my fact this week is that
00:37
on july the 13th 1930 sir arthur conan
00:41
doyle headlined a show at the royal
00:42
albert hall despite having died six days
00:46
before
00:47
did he get booed you couldn't be booed
00:49
off stage could you
00:52
you mean died in a physical sense not
00:53
died and had a really bad gig sense yeah
00:56
so basically what happened is that six
00:58
days previous siratha conan doyle had
01:01
actually died and his family were very
01:03
spiritual and they knew that they were
01:05
going to be reunited with him in some
01:07
way and they thought why don't we put on
01:08
effectively a family reunion gig at the
01:11
royal albert hall and they did it as a
01:13
partial memorial as well so it was built
01:15
as a memorial however the star bill at
01:18
the top was that there was going to be a
01:19
clairvoyant coming along there was going
01:21
to be an empty chair on the stage at the
01:23
royal albert hall and his spirit would
01:25
be summoned to give a message to say
01:27
it's all good i'm on the other side and
01:29
it was right it came it rocked up it
01:32
showed up six and six thousand people
01:33
came to see it as well yeah six thousand
01:36
people crowded the albert hall some
01:37
numbers put it up at ten thousand but
01:39
apparently it doesn't seat that many or
01:40
stand that many if you fit ghosts in
01:43
presumably it's got a theoretically
01:44
infinite capacity
01:46
now i don't want to be captain skeptical
01:48
anna but what do you mean he turned up
01:49
oh well we have recorded evidence that
01:52
he turned up what i read about it is
01:54
that um the the medium estelle roberts
01:56
uh claimed that she'd seen doyle sitting
01:58
in his chair uh and she conveyed a
02:00
message from him but apparently only his
02:02
wife heard it and everyone else was
02:04
overpowered from a massive blast on the
02:06
organ that was playing it was an oddly
02:08
timed blast of organ to mean that no one
02:11
else could hear what was being said was
02:13
anyone playing the organ or was it an
02:15
organ played by a ghost there was an
02:16
organist build on the uh on the actual
02:19
playbill so yeah so it wasn't a ghost no
02:21
it was just the organist being an idiot
02:23
no i think the idea is that they wanted
02:25
to keep the message in the end a bit
02:26
private and so they did that it's really
02:28
odd the total moment that everyone
02:30
waited like two hours bizarre that they
02:32
try and cover up the clear words of
02:34
arthur conan dole speaking from beyond
02:35
the grave yeah um just quickly the
02:37
medium stell roberts she had a spirit
02:41
that she used to talk to called red
02:42
cloud he was a native american he
02:45
wrongly predicted that world war ii
02:47
wouldn't happen and that it would all be
02:50
fine he said that and then obviously he
02:52
was wrong and but they did manage to
02:54
catch him on photo once or twice but
02:56
they turned out always to look exactly
02:58
like her wearing a hat
03:03
we're to predict that world war ii won't
03:05
happen
03:06
very specific unnecessary specific
03:08
predictions i think a lot of people
03:09
predicting it might happen and red cloud
03:11
was like no it'll be fine
03:14
conan doyle's spirit guide said the
03:15
opposite so that conan doyle and his
03:17
wife jean they had their own at their
03:19
home in sussex they had a spirit guide
03:20
called phineas who i'm quoting here
03:23
regularly predicted global catastrophe
03:27
and he also advised them on when they
03:29
should move house and things like this
03:31
um supposedly on one occasion gene asked
03:34
the local station master to reschedule a
03:36
train that arthur was going to take
03:38
because her spirit guide had said it'll
03:40
be better if the trains moved actually i
03:42
think it might have fitted with her
03:43
rescheduling it
03:44
i don't know because he was a popular
03:46
man you never know yeah maybe you know
03:48
when he was a doctor before uh he became
03:51
a writer and he had almost zero patience
03:54
his first one when he set up in
03:55
portsmouth was a man who walked in and
03:57
so conan doyle said oh come in come in
03:59
really excitedly showed him straight
04:00
into his um consultation room sat him
04:03
down and said i can tell already by the
04:05
way you're coughing that you've got some
04:06
bronchial problems and the man said no
04:09
sorry i'm just coughing because i'm a
04:10
bit nervous i'm here to collect the gas
04:11
bill that the previous tenant didn't pay
04:13
off
04:15
thus the home's method was born
04:20
so conan doyle very famously believed in
04:22
fairies and he believed in contacting
04:25
the dead and all of his family were very
04:27
much a part of the same belief system
04:29
there was a time magazine article that
04:30
was published on the 21st of july it was
04:32
basically reviewing the gig but it was
04:34
also giving the background and the lead
04:36
up to it so they said that when conan
04:38
doyle died this is the words in the
04:39
article sir arthur's family cheerfully
04:41
buried him
04:42
because they were like well we'll see
04:44
him in a few days anyway so that'll be
04:45
fine and it was really interesting in
04:47
the period between the gig happening
04:49
they got lots of messages from people
04:50
saying that sir arthur conan doyle had
04:52
got in contact and left them messages
04:54
and the sun said we believe the people
04:57
that they're not lying that spirits got
04:58
in contact but their spirits themselves
05:01
are pranksters on the other side and
05:03
people like what do you mean he's like
05:04
there are prankster spirits who are
05:06
pretending to be conan doyle and it's
05:08
not our dad it's it's just someone else
05:10
this is i think this is a quite a
05:12
pervasive thought about for people who
05:14
believe in seances and about spirits
05:16
that there are a lot of pranksters
05:17
there's a really excellent book by
05:18
hilary mantel one of her earlier books
05:20
called beyond black where the idea is
05:22
that um seances are all haunted by these
05:25
bastard pranksters who are always just
05:26
throwing at you and pretending to
05:28
be your dead mom and then biting you in
05:29
the face and stuff but you would only
05:31
really need one ghost to exist and he
05:33
could do the voices if it was like a
05:35
jung culture ghost or something who can
05:37
do the voices of all the dead people who
05:39
are ever there if there's just one
05:41
prankster well so the thing about the
05:43
medium is getting it wrong this was a
05:45
huge part of the relationship between
05:46
doyle and houdini harry houdini yes the
05:48
escapologist they were friends and doyle
05:50
believed in houdini didn't and houdini
05:52
spent a lot of his time cheerfully
05:53
unmasking fraudulent mediums and then
05:56
doyle talked houdini into going to a
05:58
seance because doyle's wife was a medium
06:01
and she said houdini i've got great news
06:03
i'm in contact with your mother who's
06:05
died and they talked him into it and
06:07
then he went along and then houdini's
06:08
mum wrote a 15-page message to houdini
06:11
unfortunately it was in perfect english
06:13
whereas houdini's mum spoke almost no
06:15
english
06:17
it started with the sign of the cross
06:19
and houdini's mother was married to a
06:20
rabbi and it was just yeah it wasn't
06:22
very well done it wasn't very well done
06:24
and that did break up their friendship
06:25
really didn't they which is a shame
06:26
because they had one of these very good
06:28
sparring relationships where houdini was
06:30
constantly trying to convince conan
06:31
doyle that he wasn't magic and conan
06:33
doyle was constantly trying to tell
06:34
houdini that houdini was magic and then
06:36
they sort of really fell out over this
06:38
well so you just probably didn't believe
06:39
him that these were tricks yeah he kept
06:41
saying harry honestly you've got amazing
06:43
powers embrace it
06:45
is going no this is how i do it um but
06:47
yeah he called conan doyle's beliefs
06:49
hogwash and apple sauce wow which i
06:51
enjoy as insults um before he was a uh
06:54
an escapologist he um was the wild man
06:57
and he would live in a cage and eat
06:59
pieces of meat what's he yeah it was
07:02
because he was he and his wife were
07:03
absolutely broke and they had to do
07:04
anything they could to get work so that
07:06
was one of the acts that he had oh my
07:08
god would you then break out of the cage
07:09
using no
07:12
oh my god um so have you heard of
07:14
marjorie crandon no she's one of the
07:16
best ever fraudulent mediums and houdini
07:18
had this huge vendetta against her um
07:21
she performed very scantily clad and on
07:23
one occasion supposedly she emitted
07:25
ectoplasm from her vagina
07:28
yeah as you did yes
07:30
that's kind of what happened yeah well
07:31
what was she embarrassed by that or i
07:33
don't think because usually it comes
07:34
from your ear or nostril right
07:38
it basically comes from anywhere you
07:40
hide it yes so you get a load of
07:42
exoplasm and it's made out of egg whites
07:44
and wood chip or whatever and you hide
07:46
it in your various orifices around your
07:48
body and then it comes out of there
07:51
so i think it's made of wood chip isn't
07:53
that sawdust sawdust really margaery
07:56
supposedly had some made of butcher's
07:57
offal which he was pulling out of i mean
07:59
it's imagining butcher's awful it's like
08:01
intestines yeah yeah like you would pull
08:03
um flags out of um a top hat or
08:06
something yes if you replace the flags
08:08
with lambs intestines and the top hat
08:11
with a vagina
08:12
that's exactly i'm never booking that
08:15
lady from my children's party again
08:18
um
08:19
so yeah so houdini canceled his own
08:21
shows to travel across the country to
08:23
attend her seances and try to debunk her
08:25
um i found a really cool seance thing
08:26
the connection between alcoholics
08:28
anonymous and seances
08:30
so bill wilson who's the founder of
08:32
alcoholics anonymous he was massively
08:34
into seances he used to go to them all
08:36
the time and he had in his own house he
08:38
had a spook room and the spook room is
08:41
where he would go into and that's where
08:42
he'd chat to spirits and actually he
08:44
claimed uh that the famous 12 steps uh
08:47
that alcoholics anonymous has um he
08:49
actually he that got he wrote this in
08:51
his autobiography as well that he led uh
08:53
he got led to creating that as an idea
08:56
because he was talking to a 15th century
08:57
monk called boniface
09:00
oh yeah yeah
09:02
and that's why step number seven of the
09:04
twelve is
09:08
um yeah so he um and it was the idea of
09:10
sitting around in a room around a table
09:12
and and sharing things and that led to a
09:14
very similar uh situation for alcoholics
09:16
anonymous really i didn't know that um
09:18
do you know who named ouija boards
09:20
parker brothers no ouija boards named
09:22
ouija boards so ouija boards were they
09:26
became
09:27
they became quite popular seances became
09:29
very popular in the 19th century and
09:30
people started using something like a
09:32
ouija board in about the 1880s but it
09:34
didn't have a name and of about four
09:36
investors got together in 1890 and
09:39
decided you know they had to find out a
09:41
name for the ouija board so they called
09:42
in this one of their spiritualist
09:43
sisters and they gathered around it and
09:45
they asked the ouija board what do you
09:47
want to be called and it spelled out
09:49
weeja so
09:51
the fact that it's also the words for
09:53
yes in
09:54
german that really is irrelevant i think
09:56
i think that's a myth no you're right
09:58
anna your theory is much better
10:01
so the so the truth was that the women
10:02
the spiritualist who said that the board
10:04
had spoken to her was wearing a locket
10:06
at the time a picture of a woman who was
10:08
called ueda uh so saw that she got the
10:10
idea from that i've never done a ouija
10:12
board meaning i've never done any of
10:14
this stuff it's too scary
10:16
that's that's not quite the reason i
10:18
haven't done it um
10:19
they used to use ouija boards for
10:22
contacting a live people mostly didn't
10:23
they during world war one i think they
10:26
were used to contact soldiers on the
10:28
front so families would say
10:31
how's it going over there and then the
10:33
soldier would supposedly talk to them
10:35
well they're not rumbled when their sons
10:37
came home from war and their mum was
10:38
like how dare you speak to me like you
10:40
did last year
10:44
you flung all that ectoplasm across the
10:45
room
10:47
i didn't even know you had a vagina
10:54
okay it is time for fact number two and
10:56
that is chozinski my fact is that dutch
10:59
trains are fitted with lasers to fire at
11:02
leaves on the line
11:04
that is amazing um is it how i imagine
11:07
so it's like i'm imagining actually a
11:09
steam train at the moment but it's got a
11:10
massive laser on the front and it's
11:13
firing like green lasers
11:15
and then kind of vaporizing them yeah
11:17
it's just like that it also makes the
11:18
noise
11:19
[Laughter]
11:21
it's that it's got a giant pair of eyes
11:23
shooting lasers a hundred meters ahead
11:25
um no it hasn't
11:28
this is they're a little bit smaller
11:30
than that it's definitely the same
11:30
principle but they're um tiny little
11:32
lasers that are attached to the wheels
11:34
and they just shoot and vaporize leaves
11:36
on the track just in front of the wheels
11:39
so they're quite small but this is still
11:41
in trial stage i think and it started in
11:43
2014
11:44
and it's because leaves on on the line
11:47
is a massive problem and it's just a
11:49
more efficient way of cleaning them up
11:51
so other ways of getting these off the
11:52
line like jets of water or jets of sand
11:54
caused a bit of damage to the line and
11:57
because lasers have a really tiny
11:58
wavelength they get absorbed by the
12:00
leaves but they the rails are completely
12:02
unaffected by them so you can fire a
12:03
laser a rail forever and ever and
12:05
nothing will happen i think the first
12:07
time they started investigating this
12:08
method was in 1999 yes and the original
12:12
laser burned at 5 000 degrees celsius
12:16
and fired 25 000 times a second but the
12:18
vibrations of the train meant that it
12:20
wasn't accurate enough
12:22
so that was
12:24
[Laughter]
12:34
prospered as humanity perished
12:39
no this is so the guy who came up with
12:41
this idea is a man called malcolm
12:42
higgins who was a royal navy lieutenant
12:44
commander and he had no experience in
12:46
lasers and no experience in training
12:47
because he was in the navy
12:50
don't don't use him that much on ships
12:53
and he was just into the radio one day i
12:54
think and thought leaves the line i bet
12:56
i know what could fix that a laser and
12:58
he looked into it and set up this
13:00
company called laser thor and it turns
13:02
out it is uh better than better than the
13:04
other methods in a lot of ways but
13:05
you're right because of the um the
13:07
slight wobble of trains the lasers
13:08
sometimes misfired whereas if you fire a
13:10
jet of water it just gets anything
13:12
that's in its way but it's been adjusted
13:14
for now uh in the dutch version and so
13:16
it seems like it's working like a dream
13:18
we haven't said why leaves online are a
13:19
bad thing
13:20
yeah they are they are no
13:23
no no why oh why right so they turn into
13:26
a black mulch don't they yeah sorry
13:29
sorry andy wanted to say why i thought
13:31
you were asking me but you just wanted
13:32
to show off that you knew
13:34
sorry i should forgive me for bringing
13:36
it back to this thing
13:39
go on no no no no i can showboat for a
13:43
second
13:44
and read out a fact
13:46
yep no take the stage so what happens is
13:48
when the so it's when you've got a leaf
13:50
on the line it's the previous train goes
13:51
over it and crushes it the leaves
13:53
release the thing called pectin
13:55
which um is the stuff that the food
13:57
industry use uses as a gel to make jams
14:00
and jellies so that's what happens so
14:02
the train so it means it slows down the
14:04
deceleration of the train so basically
14:06
the train can't break very effectively
14:08
and that's dangerous so they have to go
14:09
much more slowly does that mean that
14:11
this vaporizing by lasers of the leaves
14:13
is going to reduce the quantities of jam
14:15
available to us uh i think that jam
14:17
companies don't
14:18
principally sort their jam from railway
14:20
lines
14:22
the jam harvest every year is little
14:24
children running along railway lines
14:26
stripping up the supermarket you've got
14:29
strawberry raspberry train
14:34
so they are a huge problem and i do feel
14:36
bad for things like network rail because
14:38
we take the piss but um i think 4.5
14:40
million hours of passenger delays
14:42
roughly a year are caused by leaves on
14:44
the rails um the cost of repairing
14:46
tracks because of leaf issues or
14:48
repairing trains is 10 million a year
14:50
and then another 5 million for the
14:52
vegetation management and the only
14:53
reason they were there in the first
14:54
place is because people who were
14:55
building railways wanted to protect
14:57
people who lived nearby from the sounds
14:59
so they planted lots and lots of trees
15:01
next to them
15:02
and turns out that was a real ball ache
15:05
you know these aren't the only lasers
15:06
that are used on trains there's another
15:07
train that shoots out lasers that we
15:10
have in the uk it's called the flying
15:11
banana
15:15
this is an article hallucination this is
15:18
real it goes all the way up and down the
15:19
uk rail networks and what it's doing is
15:21
checking the quality so using lasers and
15:23
cameras of the tracks they're making
15:25
sure that the tracks are just still as
15:27
strong still as good why did they call
15:29
it the flying banana um because it's
15:31
yellow oh okay it looks so it looks a
15:34
bit like a banana yeah yeah
15:36
and they mean flying and going quickly
15:38
rather than actually flying yeah
15:40
sounds like a flying banana to me
15:42
exactly
15:43
do we know if it's curved we don't know
15:44
we don't know no it won't be because how
15:46
would it go in the tracks like the one
15:48
thing about trains is they have to be
15:50
straight you can put a banana on wheels
15:55
that's true if you put a big enough axle
15:57
and gauge on a standard banana you could
16:00
have a train that was just a banana on
16:02
wheels
16:04
yeah i agree with that but on the other
16:05
hand if you're checking the rail you
16:07
really want it to be pretty much the
16:09
size and shape of a train
16:11
if you're too small as well bananas you
16:13
don't get bananas the size of trains
16:14
well i'm going to take the example from
16:16
the navy man and i'm going to set up a
16:17
company
16:20
i should say the real name of that train
16:22
is the new measurement train
16:23
i can see what i i can see where they
16:25
have to come up with a nickname for it
16:28
but yeah so it checks strength in the
16:29
joins and
16:30
overhead cables and so it just makes
16:32
sure it's the maintenance train
16:33
basically do you know what the fastest
16:35
train ever in north america was oh no
16:37
okay it was called the
16:39
m497 black beetle and it was basically a
16:43
normal train that they put two jet
16:44
engines on
16:47
and fired it down the tracks cheating
16:49
yeah well it is but for a while it was
16:51
thought that they this might be the
16:53
future and they did it in russia and
16:54
they did it in america um but the
16:56
problem was basically if they crashed
16:59
everyone died
17:00
yeah so it was it was incredibly
17:03
dangerous
17:04
but they did go really fast and they do
17:06
technically work isn't that how all
17:07
trains work that if they crash everyone
17:09
dies no no they work
17:12
you think everyone's died in every
17:14
single train crash i always make sure to
17:16
get off before the last stop because i
17:17
assume it just goes into a wall
17:20
well we've talked about the phrase
17:21
haven't we getting off at gate's head no
17:23
getting off at gateshead is uh slang for
17:26
the withdrawal method in sex because
17:28
gateshead is the second last stop on the
17:30
line
17:31
for newcastle okay i thought it was for
17:33
premature ejaculation
17:35
uh i think that's being thrown off the
17:37
train at gateshead whether you want to
17:39
leave it or not
17:44
um
17:47
oh i should just finish off this thing
17:49
so um yeah basically the reason is
17:51
because you've got two massive engines
17:53
on and it's going so fast that there's
17:55
it's used a lot of fuel and yeah any
17:58
kind of accident is going to be pretty
18:00
fast
18:01
should we do some stuff quickly on
18:02
lasers
18:03
yeah do you know what the world's
18:05
largest laser is no the world's biggest
18:07
laser uh it was made in osaka university
18:10
in japan
18:12
and it has a power of 2 000 trillion
18:15
watts that's two peter watts and it's
18:18
very short amount of time that it does
18:19
it and that's a billion times more
18:21
powerful than uh flood lights in a
18:24
football stadium uh it's about the same
18:27
as all the power that the sun gives to
18:30
london every year
18:32
whoa
18:33
and what they do with that is they fire
18:35
it for a very small amount of time on
18:36
some matter and it turns it into plasma
18:39
and plasma is what we think it's a state
18:41
of matter and it's what we think 99 of
18:43
everything in the universe is made out
18:45
of uh but we can't really make it on
18:47
earth because it's quite hard to make
18:48
unless you use this massive laser well
18:50
so we're just trying to turn the
18:51
remaining one into possibilities
18:54
the poor desperate one percent
18:56
still clinging on
18:58
that's very cool
19:00
um can i tell you about my favorite
19:01
laser
19:02
out there it doesn't exist yet it's been
19:04
proposed but i i would love it if this
19:06
was made so there's a lot of debate
19:08
about the fact that we're transmitting
19:10
stuff into space and people like stephen
19:12
hawking has said let's stop trying to
19:14
tell any potential life out there that
19:16
we're here because they might use us as
19:17
a resource it's it's oddly it it appears
19:19
in the news a lot i've just been seeing
19:21
independence day too
19:23
it does make sense because of all the
19:25
life forms in the universe let's assume
19:27
there are others
19:28
it's pretty unlikely we're going to be
19:30
the smartest and you know what happens
19:32
when smarter so-called communities reach
19:35
less smart communities yeah the less
19:36
smart ones get pushed around exactly i
19:38
personally experience it every week on
19:39
this podcast
19:41
um so two astronomers at columbia
19:44
university have taken this seriously and
19:45
they've developed the idea of two lasers
19:48
that we would put out into space and
19:49
what we would do is we would blast a
19:51
continuous 30 megawatt laser for about
19:54
10 hours once a year and what that would
19:56
do is it would cloak us into
19:58
invisibility from any outside planet so
20:00
we're looking for light emitting and
20:02
whatever it is that you look for it's
20:04
like an invisibility shield and it
20:05
wouldn't use that much energy it would
20:07
only use about 70 american homes worth
20:09
of energy for that 110 hour blast so 70
20:13
families in america just have to do
20:15
without television
20:17
no that surely that wouldn't work what
20:19
would these aliens think they've managed
20:21
to see all the way over to where we are
20:23
yeah but there doesn't seem to be a
20:24
planet there despite the fact that all
20:26
the gravity of all the other planets
20:27
seems to say that there is
20:29
their episode of friends just cuts out
20:37
i think if they're smart enough to
20:39
get to kind of look over here then
20:41
they're smart enough to realize that
20:42
that was a trick that's true unless they
20:44
haven't spotted us yet i thought you're
20:46
going to say two big lasers one's saying
20:47
piss and the other one's saying
20:51
[Music]
20:55
okay it is time for fact number three
20:58
and that is andrew hunter murray my fact
21:00
is that to avoid catching malaria you
21:02
should carry a chicken with you at all
21:04
times
21:06
live chicken it can't be a kfc bucket
21:11
are you sure is it
21:13
because it's something to do with
21:14
molecules it gives off or something yeah
21:16
so there have been some scientists from
21:18
ethiopia and sweden who've been doing
21:19
trials on this and they're preparing
21:21
more trials at the moment they did
21:23
experiments where they suspended a live
21:25
chicken in a cage near people sleeping
21:28
uh in uh under a bed net and then
21:31
do they warn the people sleeping or did
21:33
those people wake up in the morning and
21:34
freak out
21:36
um they warned them and so it's a
21:38
particular kind of malaria mosquitoes
21:40
anopheles arabiensis and they it's been
21:42
discovered they avoid chickens and so
21:45
the scientists are working on extracting
21:47
the chemicals from the chickens which
21:48
give off the chickeny smell and then
21:50
you'll just be able to spray this around
21:51
and you won't get malaria which is the
21:53
smell of delicious chicken exactly yeah
21:56
then people will start eating you
21:57
instead
21:58
worse
21:59
yeah so this is uh about how great
22:01
chickens are and all the things they do
22:02
for us that we don't give them credit
22:04
for yeah yeah that's really amazing it's
22:06
incredible yeah do you know you get some
22:07
chickens which are half male and half
22:09
female really um yeah and they're split
22:12
down the middle
22:14
all the cells on the left hand side are
22:16
male and all the cells on the right hand
22:17
side are female
22:18
so they have they have you know um cox
22:21
combs on one side and sort of big
22:22
fighting spurs that male uh have
22:25
and on the right they have much daintier
22:27
more hen-like features breasts large
22:30
breasts yeah so do they lay half eggs
22:33
[Laughter]
22:35
i don't know that's an amazing question
22:43
[Laughter]
22:53
aren't they yes they are and they're um
22:55
i think you get them in butterflies i've
22:56
seen them in butterflies as well so half
22:58
of them look like they're one color and
22:59
half of them look like they're another
23:01
color i think chickens can change the
23:02
sex camp i've heard that as well i
23:04
remember hearing about a fighting
23:06
once who was a female and then change
23:10
their sex halfway through
23:12
or the other way around but then all the
23:15
it was the other way around because then
23:17
all the would see this like hen
23:20
and think oh well this is going to be
23:21
easy but actually she had all the
23:23
aggression of a male and would just
23:25
absolutely kill wow so it turns out you
23:27
should put a fighting hen against a
23:29
fighting yeah but they just don't
23:30
have that kind of aggression depends
23:33
okay
23:34
um another possible cure for malaria or
23:36
sorry not a cure for malaria malarial
23:38
prevention right trick is spiders so
23:41
there's a spider that preys specifically
23:43
on the anopheles mosquito which is the
23:44
jumping spider and it's been found that
23:46
they're attracted to smelly socks or
23:48
smelly human clothes like smelly
23:50
underwear and so it's there's a thought
23:53
that you could leave your smelly clothes
23:54
just not wash your clothes leave them in
23:56
your house attract jumping spiders into
23:57
your house and by having them there
23:59
they'll get rid of the malarial
24:00
mosquitoes and instead you'll just be
24:01
infested with spiders wow that's amazing
24:03
it's not interesting because they used
24:04
to eat spiders webs to get rid of
24:06
malaria yeah they did which presumably
24:08
didn't work at all but yeah i don't
24:10
think so yeah um they used to give you
24:12
tablets full of spiders webs yeah you
24:14
would take those and they would help and
24:15
there was another thing that you you
24:17
would carry around walnuts i think empty
24:19
walnuts with little spiders inside them
24:22
and that would supposedly stop the
24:24
malaria from getting you of course none
24:26
of these works but that was up till the
24:27
20th century in italy yeah that they
24:30
thought the thing was for the 20th
24:31
century very early 20th century they
24:33
thought the thing would the mosquito
24:35
would bite the walnut or the spider
24:36
inside it and also i read that around
24:39
the same time in italy a doctor would
24:41
sew a live millipede into the clothes of
24:43
the sufferer without telling the
24:45
sufferer and that would also stop them
24:46
from getting malaria somehow wow people
24:48
walking around with live millipedes in
24:50
their clothes
24:53
um did you know that you can and
24:55
japanese students have recently
24:56
fertilized a shop bought chicken egg and
24:58
grown it into a chick which i thought
25:00
wasn't possible but what do you mean
25:02
they they so they bought so this was to
25:04
see if they could grow uh embryo outside
25:06
of it shell completely
25:08
and these japanese there's video of this
25:10
again online and these japanese students
25:11
literally bought this egg cracked it
25:13
into a cup fertilized it so they bought
25:16
the required sperm i guess male sex
25:19
stuff to fertilize it and then we call
25:21
it
25:24
and they yeah they fertilized it they
25:25
covered it with sort of cling film and
25:27
it grew into a chick isn't that weird so
25:29
you could watch it you could watch all
25:31
the vessels develop if you look at the
25:32
video you can see this egg that you
25:34
would fry in a pan turn into that is
25:36
amazing that's extraordinary what so do
25:39
they do no they don't start as yolk in
25:41
all cases right
25:42
no the yolk is going to feed some food
25:44
yeah okay right
25:46
cool
25:47
suggesting that we and chickens both eat
25:49
chicken yolk oh yes well we and cows
25:53
both drink milk
25:55
what
25:56
[Laughter]
25:58
we and sharks both eat fish
26:04
mind blown
26:06
yeah if you look in an egg there's like
26:08
a little tiny bit attached to the yolk
26:10
and that's what would be the actual true
26:14
egg and the rest of it is just for well
26:16
you sometimes get little red bits don't
26:18
you in the egg yeah yeah and speaking of
26:19
male sex stuff
26:21
um
26:24
so female chickens they have sperm
26:26
storage tubules these are called sst's
26:30
they can keep male sperm alive inside
26:32
them for up to 15 weeks
26:35
that's cool wow it's way longer than
26:37
mammalian sperm can survive a lot of
26:39
animals that do that it's so that they
26:41
have a choice whether to what's the word
26:43
whether it's like fertilizer yeah it's
26:45
fertilized or not is that true it's true
26:46
of hens and they can they can eject
26:48
inferior roosters sperm after sex
26:51
brilliant i want to see that they
26:52
generally
26:56
they eject up to 80 of the stuff they
26:58
receive
26:59
no no thank you i want to see a rooster
27:01
have sex with a hen and go and let go
27:03
was that good for you and her go yeah
27:04
yeah it was great it walks 10 meters
27:06
down the road and then it gets
27:08
splattered and she goes just kidding it
27:09
was terrible
27:16
okay it is time for our final fact of
27:19
the show and that is
27:21
james
27:22
okay my fact this week is that all of
27:24
the sandals won by the pueblo people of
27:27
new mexico had enough space for six toes
27:31
hmm wow yeah did any of them have six
27:33
toes or was it just a very bad shoe
27:35
maker
27:36
they just couldn't count
27:39
why so three percent of them had um six
27:42
toes which is a lot higher than normal
27:44
yeah normally it would be probably less
27:46
than one percent and it was the fact
27:48
that they thought that people with six
27:50
toes were especially good and they were
27:52
revered and they were thought to be
27:54
great and um they were associated with
27:56
with like important rituals and things
27:58
like that and so having six toes was
28:00
good and so researchers who have looked
28:02
at the place where they live have found
28:04
loads of sandals loads of sandal-shaped
28:06
stones loads of pictures of sandals and
28:08
all of these have an extra toe wow
28:10
that's incredible so that kind of
28:12
implies that the other 97 were
28:13
pretending they had six toes they were
28:15
all wearing six-toed sandals yeah maybe
28:17
they had like little fake toes that they
28:19
used to stick on yeah a little bit of
28:21
play-doh
28:22
can i just ask when were they around
28:25
okay so they've been they're actually
28:27
still around the descendants of these
28:29
people and their hoppy native americans
28:31
are supposed to be descended from them
28:33
um but these particular times that
28:35
looking at an area of a canyon in new
28:38
mexico and they were living around 700 a
28:42
d 800 a.d so just over a thousand years
28:44
ago okay and the other thing is that
28:46
they found that it's about three percent
28:48
of the population um had six toes but it
28:51
could be actually that it wasn't that
28:53
high the bodies that we find are ones
28:55
that have been especially buried uh and
28:58
it might be just the more revered people
28:59
who have been buried so maybe they had a
29:01
normal incidence of toes but we just
29:03
know about them more because we only see
29:05
the the special people yeah okay
29:08
they've found a skeleton haven't they
29:10
whether the foot which has six toes has
29:13
a special ornamental anklet worn around
29:15
it as if to say check out my six toes
29:17
and the other foot which has only got
29:18
five toes on it has no such decoration
29:20
no there's more another strut of
29:21
evidence that i did this was a revered
29:23
trait yeah you know how you're saying it
29:24
might attract the opposite of sex yeah
29:26
um not the opposite of sex
29:28
oh the opposite of the opposite of sex
29:31
sex
29:34
but is there anything in in genetics
29:36
that if your mom and dad had six toes
29:38
that you're in any way likely to inherit
29:40
success really it's a genetic trait yeah
29:42
so we could actually just within one
29:44
generation
29:45
make
29:46
new different
29:47
humans
29:48
i mean if we forced six toed and six
29:51
people to breed with each other in a
29:52
kind of weirdly awful dystopian way i
29:54
guess we could yeah but if we decided it
29:56
was more practical for humans going
29:57
forward to have six toes we could
29:59
actually just do that within it takes a
30:00
long time it doesn't i don't think of
30:02
one generation
30:03
like clerks don't need to worry
30:08
um you know who else has six fingers um
30:12
pandas oh yeah they all have this sort
30:15
of extra little thumby protrusion on the
30:17
opposite side from their first thumb
30:19
right that helps them to grip bamboo and
30:21
it helps with support and things like
30:22
that that's pretty cool yeah is it that
30:24
it's not really a true finger they call
30:26
it a pseudo thumb yeah i think it's it's
30:29
like a bony protrusion isn't it so you
30:30
can wiggle it it's thumb like but they
30:32
can't yeah but it serves the purpose
30:33
that a thumb would be able to serve
30:35
doesn't it it grips i think people have
30:36
said that if if we were to pick a sixth
30:39
digit that another thumb on the other
30:40
side would be the best one to have that
30:42
would be fantastic yeah
30:44
um if you do lose a finger or a thumb
30:46
you could get a toe transplanted which
30:48
is quite common now a quite a common
30:50
treatment for losing a finger it's
30:52
mostly to replace thumbs isn't it it's
30:53
so easy to replace thumbs i quite like
30:55
this interview with the guy who had it
30:56
done who said there's an operation which
30:58
involves two surgical teams one is to
31:00
lop off the toe and the other is to
31:02
prepare the thumb area to have the toe
31:04
attached and he said afterwards the
31:06
worst part of it was them taking the toe
31:08
off as which seems quite obvious to me
31:11
that that would be the worst part
31:13
as opposed to them putting it onto the
31:14
hand but this was first done in 1897 by
31:17
this austrian surgeon called hull
31:19
nicoladoni who and it wasn't as
31:21
successful but it did it did work and
31:23
that he was able to turn a toe into a
31:25
thumb and he did it by connecting the
31:27
man's thumbless hand to his foot so the
31:30
man had to go
31:33
i think if you're gonna replace your
31:35
thumb with a toe what you want to do is
31:36
take the toe from the foot and put it on
31:38
your hand not take your hand and put it
31:40
down though
31:41
that's what he had to do because he had
31:44
to get the toe sort of used to being on
31:45
the hand before he detached it from the
31:47
foot so the man had to go around for a
31:48
long time because if you put the toe on
31:50
someone's hand he's going to go oh it's
31:51
so high up here
31:55
they've got to get used to it
31:58
it's like this hand's just coming to
32:00
stay for a while wait the guys come down
32:02
like to meet the in-laws basically yes
32:04
to like
32:05
what exactly did the guy have to do
32:07
here's what the guy had to do he had to
32:08
bend over have his thumbless hand sewn
32:11
onto his big toe and then that allowed
32:13
the big toe to get accustomed to the big
32:15
things
32:16
the big toe wasn't detached no the big
32:18
toe wasn't attached so the man had to
32:19
spend a few weeks bent over with his
32:21
hand attached to his foot yes
32:24
people like come on jeff we're off he's
32:26
i'm just
32:28
[Laughter]
32:35
but it won't do you any good in terms of
32:37
acclimatizing surely if your toe is
32:39
still attached to your foot well it's
32:42
apparently it it did work
32:44
brilliantly
32:45
you might attach the blood vessels for
32:47
instance yeah and they need to they
32:48
might be still attached in one place but
32:50
also attached in the other place
32:52
that was it yeah if you look at images
32:54
online of people who've had their thumbs
32:56
replaced by toes
32:57
it's pretty easy to miss yeah yeah you
33:00
could you could very easily um meet
33:02
someone talk to them shake their hand
33:03
and not notice that this replacement is
33:04
there it's so it's it is one of the most
33:07
amazing do you think you'd mention it if
33:08
you saw someone and you thought that
33:10
looked like
33:11
that looked like a toe because it's the
33:13
embarrassment it's like saying to a
33:14
woman that you think she's pregnant and
33:16
she might not be you can't say well
33:18
you've had that operation
33:22
what you were saying anna about um
33:24
putting your thumb on your toe it
33:26
reminds me of heads shoulders knees and
33:28
thumbs and thumbs
33:31
we've got to do it because barry's here
33:33
today and just all sing along
33:36
go on james it reminds me
33:39
of um in the olden days when they used
33:41
to do have a nose job
33:43
so you had to have a new nose put on
33:46
there and they would put skin from your
33:48
arm to kind of reconstruct the nose but
33:52
you had to
33:53
have the blood supply from your arm at
33:56
the same time as it's growing on your
33:57
nose so you used to have your arm
34:00
attached to your face while the skin
34:02
would grow over your nose so you would
34:04
have people whose arm is attached to
34:07
their nose for like weeks on end yeah
34:09
and there was one famous guy in italy i
34:11
think uh who had this done but he didn't
34:13
want to be having his arm over his nose
34:16
the whole time so he had his servant's
34:17
arm used instead
34:20
and so his servant had to walk around
34:23
with his arm over his boss's nose the
34:25
whole time yeah
34:27
wow that's harsh i hope the servant
34:29
never washed his hands to get him back
34:32
just on toes have you guys heard of the
34:34
world toe wrestling championships no no
34:37
okay it takes place in the uk and it is
34:40
a it's an annual event the current
34:41
champion in is alan nasty nash uh he won
34:45
it in 2015. i'm not sure if the 2016
34:48
event has happened but it's basically
34:49
exactly what it says it is it is just
34:52
toe wrestling um and they treat it very
34:54
seriously each toe is inspected uh prior
34:57
to make sure it's not a thumb
34:58
[Laughter]
35:01
yeah so the contestants have their toes
35:03
examined by a qualified nurse before
35:05
giving being given clearance that it's a
35:07
an unmodified toe and that it can and
35:09
that it can do it and it was invented
35:11
basically by four guys who were drinking
35:12
and just so annoyed that the uk uh just
35:16
was never good at winning international
35:17
sports so it was never just a champion
35:19
who was from the uk so they thought
35:21
let's let's invent a new sport um it's
35:23
only a matter of time before we teach
35:25
the um continent how to play this game
35:27
and they come over and start meeting
35:28
exactly yeah do they have weight
35:30
categories in toe wrestling were they so
35:32
is it is it
35:33
you know little toby little toe
35:37
it's always big tell me big toe isn't it
35:39
yes and it's also um it's also men
35:41
versus men women versus women so there's
35:43
no there's no plucky second toe which
35:45
took on a big toe because that is a
35:47
screenplay waiting to be written but you
35:50
can watch videos online and they all
35:51
come across like wwf wrestlers they take
35:53
it really seriously and so some of the
35:55
people in the top 100 at the moment you
35:56
do have there are not a hundred people
35:58
who do this
36:00
so maybe just top players there might be
36:02
a hundred allen nasty nash as i
36:05
mentioned before current champion uh tom
36:07
100 meter martin and then there's a guy
36:09
called paul beach whose nickname is
36:11
terminator oh very very good name it
36:14
sounds like what happens when the
36:15
characters out of this little piggy went
36:17
to market grew up
36:18
i think that's what they're all doing
36:20
now my little pony went wrestling
36:23
this little piggy became a thumb
36:29

[Applause]
00:13
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:15
no such thing as a fish
00:17
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
00:19
qi offices in covent garden
00:21
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
00:22
here with james harkin
00:24
alex bell and anna chazinski and once
00:27
again we have gathered around the
00:28
microphones with our four
00:29
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:32
and in no particular order
00:33
here we go starting with you james
00:36
harkin
00:37
okay my fact this week is that when she
00:39
was prime minister
00:40
margaret thatcher ordered that all
00:42
government documents
00:43
should have slightly different word
00:45
spacing so that if a letter was leaked
00:47
to the press they would know who it came
00:49
from
00:51
are we sure she wasn't just trying to
00:52
make up the word count and make it look
00:54
like she'd written more
00:56
how did this work well if you can
00:58
imagine
00:59
a load of text on a piece of paper and
01:01
each of the supports
01:03
[Laughter]
01:05
so yeah imagine a load of words on a
01:07
piece of paper and each of the letters
01:10
or each of the words has a space between
01:11
them you could make that space
01:13
slightly bigger or slightly lesser
01:14
depending on the word processor you're
01:16
using
01:17
and say the ones that came from you had
01:19
a
01:20
0.2 millimeter gap and the ones from dan
01:23
had a 0.3 millimeter gap
01:25
then when they found the leaked document
01:27
they would know whether it came from you
01:28
or dan depending on the space but i mean
01:30
was there someone employed
01:31
because it's obviously going to have to
01:32
be extremely tiny margins of error
01:35
otherwise you'd just have words that
01:36
were a meter apart and look ridiculous
01:38
so was there someone in her office
01:39
employed to measure with a very precise
01:41
ruler the gaps between the words
01:43
perhaps they didn't do it with a ruler
01:45
perhaps they had some other kind of
01:46
technology to do it
01:48
something even more advanced yeah but
01:49
that's the thing this is kind of a type
01:50
of steganography which is kind of hiding
01:53
messages in pictures or in text or
01:55
whatever
01:56
and a lot of this is very very slight
01:58
differences
01:59
um that when you look at them really
02:01
carefully you can see the differences
02:02
okay were there any documents that we
02:05
know of actually leaked
02:06
in her time uh i don't know um so i
02:09
found this fact
02:10
on another podcast it's called futility
02:12
closet it's a really awesome podcast
02:14
from america uh and it was also in a
02:16
book
02:17
called the investigator's guide to
02:18
steganography by gregory kipper
02:21
but actually there wasn't that much
02:23
information about it anyway
02:24
it seems to be something that it said
02:26
that happened but whether it did on that
02:28
i guess
02:28
it's possible that it's just one of
02:30
those stories but quite good sources i i
02:32
like the idea of it as well because
02:34
it's something that we hear so much
02:35
about these days in the news for new
02:37
movies and so on just trying to prevent
02:39
leaks and the kind of
02:40
the extra mile that they go to in order
02:42
to make sure so like star wars the force
02:44
awakens
02:45
all the scripts were printed on red
02:47
paper
02:48
so if you photocopied them the black of
02:50
the writing would not show up that was
02:52
just a tiny
02:53
little thing right you can see photos of
02:55
the screenwriter sitting with jj abrams
02:57
holding red scripts
02:58
so the scripts look like darth maul oh
03:00
yeah they often
03:01
watermark the script as well as input
03:03
the name of the person they're giving
03:04
the script to
03:05
all over the paper in sort of gray yeah
03:07
and writes the words on top in black
03:09
you can still read the script but it's
03:10
got the name all over it but they do in
03:11
the films as well so when you go and see
03:13
a movie in the cinema
03:15
the movie that you're seeing has dots
03:16
encoded in that particular reel so that
03:19
if it's
03:19
pirated by someone bringing in a camera
03:21
and filming it in the cinema
03:23
even if you then take what was recorded
03:25
on that camera and compress it and kind
03:27
of change the filters and put it up
03:29
online and then download it
03:30
you can still find these semi-visible
03:33
sequences of dots that appear away from
03:34
the film and work out which cinema it
03:36
was that the film was recorded
03:38
wow well and then track down the person
03:40
who did it based on people who went to
03:41
the city exactly
03:42
i thought what you're going to say is
03:43
that each version of the movie has a
03:45
slightly different
03:46
gap between all the words that they say
03:49
and so you get some people where it's
03:51
like frankly
03:53
my dear is that what howard pinto plays
03:56
are all about
03:58
the distance between
04:02
um interestingly the star wars thing
04:04
just another thing that they did in
04:06
order to avoid
04:07
leaks and spoilers they didn't release
04:09
the soundtrack until the day that the
04:10
movie was released it was scheduled to
04:12
be released before i think the book was
04:14
as well the novelization but the
04:15
soundtrack was released on the same day
04:17
because if you listen to the whole thing
04:18
the music suggests to you
04:20
the plot twists and it suggests to you
04:22
the resolution of the movie as well
04:24
which kind of makes sense sort of but it
04:26
also means everyone who's working on
04:28
that films got far too involved in it
04:30
and read way too much into what to any
04:31
normal person would just be a piece of
04:33
classical music
04:34
except that it's geeks of the world who
04:36
will be listening and analyzing
04:37
anything that's leaked ahead of time
04:39
they'd all get it wrong you just end up
04:41
with a thousand different
04:42
variations of what isn't a star wars
04:44
storyline
04:45
that reminds me a bit of i was reading
04:47
an article online
04:48
about what hodar is called in all the
04:50
different languages
04:51
in game of thrones and without giving
04:54
too much away his name
04:56
is explained in one of the later shows
04:59
but they have to have the explanation
05:01
that works in all the different
05:02
languages
05:03
and so it's working out what hodor would
05:06
be
05:07
in french say which has the same
05:09
explanation of how he got the name but
05:11
without giving too much away so that if
05:13
you heard them in both languages you
05:15
would just know what the giveaway was do
05:16
you know what i mean by that yeah but
05:18
that sounds incredibly complicated yeah
05:19
it isn't it's really interesting i might
05:21
post it up actually on twitter
05:22
actually on music when madonna released
05:24
her album american life in 2003
05:26
she released a fake version of the album
05:28
beforehand to try and counteract piracy
05:31
and it was much better than the original
05:33
it was just a series of empty tracks
05:36
like i said it was much better than the
05:37
original with her saying
05:39
what the do you think you're doing
05:40
in every single track but then that
05:42
obviously really annoyed pirates
05:44
and so they got a hold of her
05:49
smiley pirates love madonna a pirate
05:52
then hacked into a website
05:53
and posted the real pirated album ah so
05:56
the pirates win
05:56
i read this the other day and i don't
05:58
know if it's something that i didn't
05:59
know or whether
06:00
nobody knows and that is if you do walk
06:03
the plank
06:04
do you know what happens to the plank it
06:07
just gets pulled in and
06:08
i yeah i thought it was like a push out
06:10
a ball yeah that's what i thought as
06:12
well but apparently what it was is you
06:13
would get the plank
06:15
and you would put it on the edge of the
06:16
ship and people would walk
06:18
and then it would be their weight which
06:20
pulls them over the edge and then the
06:21
plank would go into the water with them
06:23
i won't see wait so does every pirate
06:25
ship have like 50 planks with them that
06:27
they
06:28
pirate ships are usually made out of
06:30
planks so i think they just took one of
06:32
them
06:32
like we can't afford to have any more
06:34
trespassers we're dismantling our ship
06:35
to the point where
06:36
it's true but i think once you've made
06:38
50 of your members of staff
06:40
what the flag that's probably the least
06:42
yes probably yeah there's also there's
06:43
also so many people you can get to walk
06:44
the plank before they're in a better
06:46
position than you are because they've
06:47
got all the wood with them
06:48
so they can just fill their own pirate
06:49
ship
06:51
i actually thought it was a myth that
06:52
people walked the plank anyway so
06:54
that's a really good point because i
06:55
thought that was true as well i can't
06:57
remember where i read this either so
06:59
it might be that i dreamt it cool does
07:02
wood float in water yeah yeah so they're
07:03
effectively
07:04
giving how do you think boats work no
07:07
that's specifically not how boats work
07:08
though you don't have to build them out
07:09
something that floats yeah you don't
07:11
know that is that is fair enough how do
07:12
you think rafts work
07:13
well i just i it just makes no sense to
07:16
give them a gigantic
07:17
life raft in a plank of wood once you've
07:20
chucked them off the boat
07:21
well maybe you don't want to kill them
07:22
you just want to not have them on your
07:24
boat anymore
07:25
i don't know if you've ever tried to
07:26
make a gigantic life raft out of one
07:27
plank of wood but it is harder than
07:29
you're making it sound i'm just saying
07:30
it's like
07:30
you're going to walk the life jacket and
07:32
then
07:34
it goes in with you it just you're
07:36
helping the guy out
07:37
i think a more common way of punishing
07:39
people was to just put them on an island
07:41
and give them
07:41
some water and some food and just say
07:44
right you're not on the boat anymore
07:45
you've just got to stay on this island
07:47
and all i get is the bible and a copy of
07:48
their favorite album
07:53
imagine if they gave you the wrong
07:54
madonna album
07:58
[Applause]
08:01
okay it is time for fact number two and
08:04
that is
08:05
alex my fact this week is that duct tape
08:07
shouldn't be used on dogs
08:10
okay according to whom according to a
08:13
physicist at lawrence berkeley national
08:15
laboratory uh who did some tests on all
08:17
different types of tape
08:18
that you could use to fix a duct and
08:21
what would be the most
08:22
and he said that of all the things we
08:23
tested only duct tape failed it failed
08:25
reliably
08:26
and often quite catastrophically and the
08:28
main problem is that it doesn't respond
08:29
well to heat changes which is something
08:31
that
08:31
ducks do a lot because they have hot and
08:33
cold air in them
08:34
and it's not according to us building
08:36
codes is not a satisfactory way to
08:38
repair a duct so
08:40
duct tape was originally called duct
08:42
tape yeah
08:43
could you use duct tape on a duck
08:47
why would you want to do that just like
08:48
keep the bill closed so they're not
08:50
making so much noise yes
08:51
yeah exactly yeah do you want to explain
08:54
the duck duck thing
08:55
so a lot of people miss hear doc's tape
08:57
and call it duct tape and
08:58
everyone thinks that's wrong but it was
09:00
originally called duct tape possibly
09:02
because
09:02
it was invented sort of around the
09:03
second world war and there was this type
09:05
of cloth-based
09:06
rubbery tape that was used to seal
09:08
ammunition boxes and it was waterproof
09:10
and it was called duct tape because
09:11
ducks are
09:12
waterproof and then after the wall
09:13
people actually did use it for their
09:15
ducts
09:16
and so then the company changed their
09:18
name to duct tape
09:20
but then there is now another company no
09:23
now people mishear it and actually call
09:25
it duct tape but there is a brand called
09:27
duct tape
09:28
tape there is yeah yeah that's called
09:30
duck duct tape
09:31
did you read the story of the woman who
09:33
invented it
09:34
it's very sweet yeah it's amazing isn't
09:36
it yeah so it was this lady called vesta
09:38
stood
09:39
and she worked packing rifle cartridges
09:42
so as alex said
09:43
um tape had to be used to keep these
09:45
rifle cartridge boxes closed
09:47
and the way they were sealed at the time
09:49
was um they were waxed down
09:51
and then there was a little paper tab
09:52
which poked out of the wax
09:54
and in order to open the cartridge
09:56
container then you pulled up the paper
09:58
tab and it opened
09:59
and the thing was the paper towel kept
10:00
on ripping off so that meant that
10:02
soldiers in the heat of war
10:04
would suddenly need to get to their
10:05
ammunition and they'd rip off this paper
10:06
tab and they wouldn't be able to open
10:08
these boxes and it would take ages to
10:09
open
10:09
and she spotted this and so she designed
10:11
duct tape and
10:13
her colleagues didn't go for it and her
10:14
bosses didn't go for it and so
10:16
she just wrote a letter straight to fdr
10:19
straight to mr president and was like
10:20
i've had this idea
10:21
my colleagues haven't gone for it but i
10:23
think it's going to save your children's
10:25
lives and my children's lives in the war
10:27
and you've got to make it happen and
10:28
within a few weeks he'd forwarded it on
10:30
to
10:30
the military i believe that employees he
10:33
not only received it
10:34
he read it then forwarded it on there's
10:36
an idea when will we ever have that
10:38
sentence again
10:39
maybe maybe he didn't have much on that
10:41
day old fdr
10:42
but um there was a case of duct tape
10:44
saving some ducks recently
10:46
which yeah there sure was um so this was
10:49
in idaho
10:50
a couple of years ago i think and people
10:52
noticed that a mother duck
10:54
was standing over a drain and some of
10:56
her little ducklings had fallen into the
10:58
drain and so
10:59
the residents of this place gathered
11:01
around and they got some duct tape and
11:02
they wrapped it with a sticky side out
11:04
and they inserted it at the end of a
11:05
stick into the drain and
11:07
attached the chicks to it and pulled
11:08
them up so still attached to this day
11:10
they are but they're grateful to be out
11:12
of that drain so duct tape should be
11:14
used on ducks
11:16
duck james should be used on ducks but
11:18
not ducks but only ducks trapped in
11:19
ducks
11:20
yes speaking of that
11:23
uh duck tape company um i was looking
11:26
into
11:26
their products because they they have a
11:28
lot of novelty products and one that i
11:30
found was uh they do a one direction
11:32
duct tape so it's you if you like the
11:34
band one direction
11:35
you can buy duct tape of one direction
11:38
you can buy justin bieber as well i went
11:40
on to amazon it's incredibly popular
11:42
they've had 236 reviews 80 of which are
11:45
five-star reviews
11:47
um in fact there's only a few odd star
11:48
reviews i wrote one down
11:50
i brought duck brand one direction
11:52
printed duct tape but instead arrived a
11:54
regular one without the images of harry
11:55
liam
11:56
louis nile or zayn i don't want a
11:57
regular one i want the product that i
11:59
bought
12:00
one star yeah they do all these novelty
12:02
things and
12:03
fans are obsessed with it it kind of
12:04
makes sense i think that's really cool
12:06
they write names on the wall
12:07
using the duct tape that's very cool is
12:09
it cool
12:10
it's kind of cool so in circles you're a
12:12
14 year old girl maybe
12:14
yeah i'm going to say yeah maybe there
12:15
is a whole culture of making things out
12:17
of duct tape it's like
12:18
it's the most versatile thing on this
12:20
earth i swear whoa
12:21
strong claim it
12:25
well that's like that's many products
12:27
duct tape is an actual you know
12:28
you can you can tear it with your hands
12:30
but then if you fold it
12:31
up on itself so it's two tapes thick as
12:34
it were that can lift nearly a ton
12:35
uh without breaking wow um and there is
12:37
one duct tape company
12:39
that holds a high school competition
12:41
every year to
12:42
or the best prom dress created entirely
12:44
out of dutch shape and the winner
12:45
receives a three thousand dollar
12:46
scholarship
12:47
wow the lifetime of bullying
12:50
i can never get there's the annual duct
12:53
tape festival as well
12:55
that happens every year hence being
12:56
called the annual duct tape
12:58
festival uh it's in ohio and because you
13:01
can do everything sculptures you can
13:02
make hammocks out of them
13:04
you can it's awesome you can't go to
13:06
space with just duct tape but you can do
13:07
a lot and i feel have you guys ever
13:09
visited the website of the duct tape
13:11
guys
13:11
no i think they might be your soul mates
13:13
alex yeah yeah yeah
13:15
yeah you know it's all my favorites
13:18
it's incredible so much effort has gone
13:20
to this website if these two guys were
13:21
just obsessed with duct tape and
13:23
the way you enter their home page is
13:24
theducttapeguys.com i think
13:26
and uh it says click on the duct tape
13:27
luggage to enter and i didn't realize
13:29
what it said i just clicked on anything
13:31
and then there are five four pictures of
13:33
luggage one of them's made of duct tape
13:34
the others aren't if you click on the
13:36
others you don't get into the site
13:37
very clever it tells you what they're
13:39
about and they have page after page
13:41
after page of things you could make of
13:43
duct tape it is extraordinary
13:45
um but yeah like quite good ideas
13:47
stylish flip-flops
13:49
they suggest which i thought i might
13:50
give a try yeah yeah i mean
13:52
all these things are great but you can
13:54
make them all out of other
13:55
materials and the fact that people are
13:57
making them out of other materials like
13:59
flip-flops for instance
14:00
yeah the fact that people make them out
14:02
of rubber and not out of duct tape
14:03
usually
14:04
makes me think that perhaps duct tape
14:06
isn't the best material
14:07
i guess so if you're on a desert island
14:09
your luxury item
14:10
might just be a roll of duct tape
14:12
because of the amount of things i would
14:14
have one with justin bieber's face on as
14:15
well
14:16
because it's company as well yeah is
14:18
that the kind of company you want
14:20
let's hope you get the right one shipped
14:21
to you because amazon has a history of
14:23
sending
14:24
imagine that disappointment imagine that
14:26
you're on the desert island
14:27
you've got some duct tape without justin
14:29
bieber's face like a madonna rather
14:31
where she's saying
14:32
you and a plank
14:35
[Laughter]
14:36
um anna you said it can't get you to
14:38
space earlier interestingly
14:40
space is one of the places where duct
14:42
tape is the most useful thing that you
14:45
can have oh yeah
14:46
almost like a desert island kind of
14:47
situation so it's carried on every
14:49
single flight since
14:50
about gemini missions yeah it's not
14:52
every one wow that's just this is this
14:54
is this is this is
14:54
an apollo missions yeah what kind of
14:56
stuff is it doing now then well okay so
14:58
just through i don't know like on the
15:00
iss right now but apollo 13
15:02
very much uh says that one of the main
15:05
reasons they were able to get back was
15:07
because of the duct tape
15:08
and also if you're if you're in space
15:10
and let's say you're on a mission to the
15:11
moon and someone suddenly goes nuts
15:13
suddenly lose they just what am i doing
15:15
up here this is too crazy you can take
15:16
them down
15:17
you take them down then that genuinely
15:18
was part of the manual
15:20
i'm not sure for the apollo missions but
15:21
it's it says you
15:23
immediately what you do is you duct tape
15:25
their hands and feet together
15:27
and then maybe to the maybe to the the
15:29
wall or something they take them down
15:30
it's not you don't
15:31
take them to the wall yeah yeah
15:34
yeah yeah i read that and it says that
15:36
you take the handsome feet like you say
15:38
but yeah then you tie them down with a
15:40
bungee card but that means they have a
15:41
bungee gear
15:43
when does that be used i think that's
15:45
what they should do with space walks
15:46
right
15:46
just do like bungee jumping out of there
15:49
that's amazing
15:50
yeah um i have just one last example as
15:53
well for space which was um
15:55
gene cernan so he's the last man to
15:57
stand on the moon when he was up there
15:59
for his mission
16:00
they had a moon buggy and the moon buggy
16:02
as they were about to get into it and
16:03
start exploring um
16:04
he ripped off the fender of the moon
16:06
buggy and the
16:08
problem was is that obviously the buggy
16:10
still operated without the fender but
16:11
they needed it on and the reason they
16:13
needed it on
16:14
is because if you drive in space the
16:16
moon dust
16:17
will just shoot up onto the astronauts
16:19
um costumes which sounds fine but this i
16:22
found this really interesting
16:23
apparently if your spacesuit gets
16:25
covered in moon dust
16:27
that means that the sun can start
16:29
overheating you because it conducts it a
16:30
lot better
16:31
so the idea is that as an astronaut you
16:33
would just fry in the suit
16:35
it would absorb it because it's darker
16:37
yeah exactly so it was a big thing so
16:39
they had duct tape and they managed to
16:40
duct tape the fender back on and that
16:42
kept the whole mission going for their
16:43
geological
16:44
uh expedition that they were doing i
16:46
don't think they called the space shoots
16:47
costumes though
16:52
everyone gave this fancy dress party in
16:54
the same outfit
16:57
[Applause]
17:00
okay it is time for fact number three
17:02
and that is my fact
17:04
my fact this week is that oxford
17:06
university's first ever professor of
17:07
chemistry
17:08
believed that fossils were actually
17:10
frozen urine
17:13
and they're not are they no it's worth
17:16
pointing out that he didn't think it was
17:17
animal life at all
17:19
frozen urine was one of the things that
17:20
he thought it was he thought generally
17:22
fossils were
17:23
salt i think he thought that that's what
17:25
made their mark but at no point at all
17:27
did he think that
17:28
it could have been an animal i don't
17:30
know if it just didn't occur to him so
17:32
his name is robert plott founding
17:34
curator at the ashmolean museum
17:36
and um he's also very famous because he
17:38
found what was
17:39
the first ever dinosaur bone as it were
17:42
he he did a drawing of it again he
17:44
didn't know that that was a dinosaur
17:46
bone
17:46
he thought that it might have been a
17:47
giant human the thigh bone of a giant
17:49
human
17:50
and uh so yeah he's he's a very famous
17:53
guy for doing quite a few things
17:54
and can we just go back to the bit where
17:56
he looked at a fossil and we've all seen
17:57
examples of fossils and thought what
17:59
that reminds me of is frozen urine
18:02
yeah do we know why he drew that
18:04
conclusion well i think what it was
18:05
is back in the day so this is what 18th
18:08
century this is uh 17th
18:09
yeah so you had like two lots of people
18:12
some of them thought that they were
18:13
natural things
18:14
that had been made from animals and the
18:16
others thought it was just a physical
18:17
process that they were made out of rocks
18:20
uh and that they had nothing to do with
18:21
animals at all and he was one of these
18:23
people who thought they were made out of
18:24
rocks and
18:25
his idea of how they might have formed
18:28
is that the urine
18:29
reacted with the rocks yeah it's urine
18:31
salts isn't it or something that's what
18:33
they're called
18:34
salts that he thought made that specific
18:35
pattern and what i thought was quite
18:37
interesting was that the dominant view
18:38
was that they weren't
18:39
living things so that was really really
18:41
controversial for reasons probably
18:42
related a lot to religion
18:44
but the sort of dominant philosophical
18:47
way of thinking
18:48
was platonic at the time and so they
18:51
adopted this neo-platonic approach which
18:53
is what they call it which is the idea
18:54
that
18:55
everything in nature sort of mirrors
18:57
everything else and there are patterns
18:59
um throughout nature so something that
19:00
you find in the ground will
19:02
have a pattern that imitates something
19:04
that you'll see in the air or patterns
19:06
on birds will be the same as patterns
19:08
in the earth and so when they found
19:09
these fossils that almost just confirmed
19:11
the philosophy that a lot of people
19:13
lived by that plato had said this is how
19:15
the world works there are all these
19:16
things on earth and
19:17
they all conform to this specific
19:19
pattern so they saw something that had
19:20
exactly the same spirals as an animal
19:22
might have on it and they thought well
19:24
that makes sense because
19:25
things in existence mirror other things
19:27
rather than thinking maybe that is
19:29
actually an animal wow
19:30
some people of course there was folklore
19:32
behind them so you would think that an
19:34
ammonite which is the kind of spirally
19:36
fossil
19:37
was actually a snake which had been
19:39
turned to stone by saint patrick
19:41
oh yeah it was thought by a lot of
19:43
people really yeah and they said hilda
19:45
and stars were a common apparent cause
19:47
of fossils weren't they people often
19:49
thought that they'd been
19:49
caused by falling stars or the action of
19:52
stars on the ground had
19:53
created fossils i think that was
19:55
something that leonardo da vinci
19:56
tried to tell people definitely couldn't
19:58
be true it didn't make any sense
20:00
oh and another thing was um it was
20:02
controversial i think they were living
20:03
things that lived more than let's say 6
20:04
000 years ago because at the time
20:05
everyone was kind of creationist and so
20:08
they couldn't believe that anything
20:09
existed before that the
20:11
universe was supposed to be created in
20:12
4004 bc yes
20:14
exactly but for some people fossils when
20:17
they were discovered confirmed
20:18
creationism because they were evidence
20:20
of noah's flood
20:21
having swept lots of sea creatures up
20:23
onto the mountains
20:25
and so they were saying look this is his
20:27
the flood did this it brought these
20:28
things up to the mountains and then it
20:30
retreated
20:30
and left them here which is kind of
20:32
almost true isn't it yeah it is yeah
20:35
it's just a much longer time frame yeah
20:37
yeah um the guy who came into curating
20:40
the ashmolean straight after
20:42
plot who was called edward lloyd uh he
20:45
thought that
20:46
vapors came from the sea they carried
20:48
spores
20:49
the spores landed in rocks and then
20:51
somehow the rocks managed to
20:53
turn the spores into animals like fish
20:55
right
20:56
yeah he was wrong as well but he thought
20:59
that that life was created from non-life
21:01
not necessarily life
21:03
but it was that these objects so it's
21:06
you've got something that looks like a
21:07
fish what created it it might never have
21:09
been alive but something has been made
21:10
that looks a bit like a fish
21:12
and he thought it might have been spores
21:13
had gone into the rocks and there was
21:14
some kind of process which allowed that
21:16
um
21:16
rock to turn into a fish okay wow he's
21:19
not too far away
21:21
in because he still at least placed a
21:23
life form into the
21:24
yeah so suddenly it was partially
21:26
organic it's hard isn't it because
21:28
these things don't make any sense until
21:30
you know the answer yeah
21:31
so you've got to come up with something
21:32
haven't you i was thinking so yeah when
21:34
you saw the dinosaur bone that makes
21:35
total sense to go well this must have
21:37
been just a giant human
21:38
back then that maybe wasn't an
21:40
outrageous suggestion because they were
21:41
finding all these weird big things
21:43
and they thought well maybe maybe we
21:45
shrunk as well i always wondered this
21:46
because you
21:47
always find evidence of a giant
21:50
millipede has been found a million years
21:52
ago or a giant
21:54
a giant lizard or a giant bird which is
21:56
a dinosaur or a giant
21:58
shrew has just been found or a giant
22:00
kangaroo's been found were the giant
22:02
humans from the past
22:03
but the thy bone the robert plot
22:05
discovered yeah 100 years later
22:06
it was given to richard brooks and he
22:08
called it scrotum human because it
22:10
looked like a giant scrotum and it's
22:12
quite annoying because that's
22:13
he he went through robert plot's papers
22:15
and he started
22:16
looking through them and organizing them
22:18
and he found that drawing and he wrote
22:20
scrotum humanum
22:21
yeah and uh i it sounds to me like he
22:23
didn't genuinely think that that
22:26
was a giant solid balls yeah because i
22:29
don't think anything has solid balls
22:30
like that
22:31
so it's hard to think that that was but
22:34
yeah boris does
22:35
which does do one exception
22:38
um you know he thought it was an
22:39
elephant when he first found it
22:42
and then he wrote that so he found this
22:45
huge bone
22:46
and he said i thought it was an elephant
22:48
bone from when the romans invaded so
22:49
they came across with elephants invading
22:51
us
22:52
was the theory and then he reported that
22:54
that happily came to oxford while i was
22:56
writing of this
22:57
a living elephant to be shown publicly
22:59
with whose bones i compared ours
23:01
so an elephant just rocked up into town
23:03
and i don't know how he
23:04
got access to it i guess he compared his
23:06
own thigh bone to the elephants and went
23:08
yeah ah doesn't look the same at all i
23:10
like the idea of that happy
23:12
coincidence that there happened to be an
23:14
elephant yeah in town
23:15
yeah that's quite rocky i wrote to the
23:18
ashmolean museum to say
23:19
do you still have the bone and they said
23:22
we don't keep dinosaur bones
23:23
here and you should try out other places
23:25
and i started looking into it more um
23:27
turns out they lost it
23:29
no one knows where this uh where this is
23:32
and actually the giant scrotum is it is
23:34
it plays a very fundamental role in our
23:36
understanding of dinosaurs because yes
23:38
richard brooks saw it and he described
23:39
it and
23:40
called it the scrotum of a human um but
23:42
then richard owen saw it as well
23:44
and richard owen at that time was
23:46
putting together his theories about
23:48
what eventually led him to coining the
23:50
word dinosaur and the first dinosaur
23:52
that he
23:53
put together the pieces together was the
23:55
megalosaurus and that bone scrotum
23:57
humenum
23:58
was part of the megalosaurus so that
24:00
initial drawing actually led to the
24:02
uh to the conclusion of dinosaurs which
24:04
is quite cool so
24:05
plot had no idea what he discovered but
24:08
there we have it the first drawing of a
24:09
of a dinosaur bone yeah quite cool he
24:11
was super useful even though he had
24:13
wacky theories i guess it's like a lot
24:15
of people from that era he just
24:16
collected loads and loads and loads of
24:18
stuff and recorded it right yeah
24:19
a lot of things that we later realized
24:21
would have been drawn from his work
24:23
gotta give him some credit yeah i mean
24:25
everyone would have been thinking like
24:26
that at the time
24:27
yeah it's not it would not have been out
24:29
of place to suggest some sort of
24:31
mythical mystical kind of background
24:33
that is in line with the church at the
24:35
time
24:35
uh he died in 1696 after suffering from
24:38
a urinary complaint
24:40
i thought that was quite how fitting
24:42
yeah fitting in april this year
24:44
we discovered an ancient daddy longlegs
24:45
that's been uh encased in amber for 99
24:48
million years and it has an erection
24:52
which was not just a spare leg no it's
24:54
definitely an erection they had black
24:55
cells on the daily mail
24:58
i didn't know they could get erections i
24:59
mean i just didn't know they had a stick
25:01
penis
25:01
either um just my favorite theory about
25:04
where fossils came from actually from
25:06
this era was
25:07
a lot of people thought that they were a
25:09
prank by the devil to try and test your
25:11
faith
25:12
but others thought that they were god
25:13
practicing to make life so he made these
25:15
fossils before he had the balls to
25:17
really go ahead and make a living thing
25:19
he thought i'll practice with some of
25:20
the shapes and so they were just like
25:23
his
25:23
his sketches before he made actual
25:25
living creatures that's a great theory
25:28
maybe the moon is a practice earth then
25:30
if then all the fossils are practice
25:31
animals maybe
25:32
you would have fitted right in in the
25:34
1600s
25:37
on urine fossils urine can fossilize and
25:40
hyrax urine is telling us about climate
25:43
change so this is this really clever
25:45
geologists have discovered which is that
25:47
hyraxes which live
25:48
in sort of south africa and places like
25:50
that you can probably picture them they
25:52
look like
25:52
big gerbils or guinea pigs although
25:54
actually their closest living relatives
25:56
are elephants and manatees
25:58
which is kind of cool but anyway these
25:59
big gerbil things that are related to
26:01
elephants and
26:02
they always urinate in the same place to
26:04
the extent that once they've picked a
26:05
urination spot they'll keep doing that
26:07
generation after generation for
26:08
thousands and thousands of years
26:10
whoa the same to the same family just
26:12
forever same family forever so some of
26:13
these fossils date back 30 000 years or
26:15
more they've been urinating
26:17
your father's father pissed here and
26:19
your bloody piss here
26:22
imagine how rebellious a hierarchy would
26:23
be who pissed somewhere else after 30
26:25
000 years um but anyway this eventually
26:28
has crystallized over thousands of years
26:30
into blocks of stratified
26:32
material and by investigating it we can
26:34
see what hyraxes were eating at
26:36
different times
26:37
in the last 30 000 years let's say so if
26:39
you get a strata that smells of
26:40
asparagus
26:42
exactly like it was a smelly time in 10
26:45
000 bc
26:46
um you can tell what vegetation's grown
26:48
and so we can tell
26:49
what was growing when based on these
26:52
sticks of hyrax you're in
26:53
they've essentially they've taken
26:54
samples from the surrounding area and
26:56
just yeah yeah exactly they've collected
26:58
they've collected their own geological
26:59
samples maybe that's why they're doing
27:01
it and we've just come along and kind of
27:02
smashed it all up to look at it and
27:04
they're going
27:05
okay cool we were going to make a museum
27:06
out of that in a few thousand years
27:08
or where are we going to piss now
27:10
[Laughter]
27:13
[Applause]
27:16
okay it is time for a final fact of the
27:18
show and that is
27:20
chozinski my fact this week is that
27:21
leonardo da vinci made sculptures out of
27:24
marzipan and got angry when people ate
27:26
them
27:28
was it a massive you know david or
27:32
that was the original david yes or were
27:34
they tiny little things like to put on
27:36
i think they were very elaborate a lot
27:37
of them so i know this from one of his
27:40
uh notebooks in which he says that he'd
27:43
made all these intricate marzipan
27:44
sculptures for the court in milan that
27:46
he worked for and he said
27:47
i have observed with pain that people
27:49
gobble up all these sculptures i give
27:51
them right to the last morsel and i am
27:52
determined to find other means that do
27:54
not taste as good so my works may
27:56
survive
27:57
which he did fortunately seems like
28:00
do you think maybe for his whole life he
28:02
was doing sculptures and different
28:04
things like cheese
28:06
i was like nope they're eating that as
28:08
well steak
28:10
the original mona lisa was made out of
28:12
pizza
28:14
he has a whole i genuinely did not know
28:16
this until you told us that fact
28:18
that he had a whole career working as a
28:20
chef
28:21
yes i had no idea like he he ran a
28:24
restaurant
28:25
i've struggled so much verifying this
28:27
because there's this book of notes
28:28
which some a couple of places say is
28:30
controversial that it's his
28:32
but then a lot of books write this down
28:34
as his absolute career
28:36
but i don't know how dangerous it is
28:37
that we say it what you're saying is
28:38
maybe his notes have got like mixed up
28:40
with god and ramsay's notes
28:44
[Laughter]
28:47
but yeah they do say that he used to be
28:49
a chef didn't he so he worked at a
28:51
restaurant yeah his stepfather was a
28:53
pastry chef um and
28:54
he had a nickname when he was 17 a fat
28:56
boy and he was a wedding planner like it
28:59
extended into him doing wedding planning
29:01
yeah this whole side of da vinci i had
29:03
no idea yeah
29:04
um and he took over the only reason he
29:05
became a chef so he was just working
29:07
uh in the restaurant but uh supposedly
29:10
in 1473
29:12
there was a poisoning that killed the
29:14
majority of the cooking staff
29:15
so he just took over a chef and the
29:18
three snails wasn't it
29:19
yes yeah but then i think he got fired
29:21
because he'd like to make kind of
29:22
nouveau cuisine style really tiny
29:24
delicious perfectly sculpted
29:26
portions and people didn't care for that
29:27
they just wanted huge amounts of food
29:29
but there's a there's another
29:31
continuation of the story which says
29:32
that
29:33
he paired up with botticelli to do some
29:35
art with botticelli at one point that's
29:37
definitely true
29:38
and him and botticelli started a
29:40
restaurant together called the three
29:41
frogs
29:42
and this is uh this is on the afizi
29:44
gallery website the
29:45
in florence the gallery in florence and
29:47
various other spanish sources and
29:49
italian sources say
29:50
that yeah him and botticelli started
29:52
this restaurant together and the way it
29:54
works according to tourist sites but
29:56
again i would love
29:57
first-hand information on this if anyone
29:59
has it is that
30:01
the guest could choose the dishes by
30:02
reading the menu which was written from
30:04
right to left because that was how
30:05
leonardo da vinci famously wrote
30:07
or they could choose the dishes by
30:09
looking at the pictures that were drawn
30:10
by botticelli
30:11
which sounds so implausible but what a
30:14
great idea it's like a themed restaurant
30:16
it's like
30:16
hollywood um he invented a giant whisk
30:19
apparently
30:20
oh yeah his inventions was larger than a
30:23
man
30:24
um what could you whisk with that
30:27
i think the model said this is just a
30:29
sketch of his i don't think he actually
30:31
created we always say inventor stuff
30:33
when he just drew it i know
30:37
but all that is is it's a normal sized
30:39
whisk with on the right-hand side scale
30:41
1-200
30:43
it's not like his drawing will have been
30:44
bigger than the man he drew a man
30:46
in the whisk i think part of the
30:48
operation of the whisk is that a man has
30:50
to be inside it
30:51
that's just a man with no sense of
30:52
perspective in his drawings
30:54
how can we be sure he didn't invent the
30:56
tiny man
30:56
[Laughter]
30:59
looking at some of his other like bits
31:01
of artwork that have been destroyed
31:03
and kind of not respected and um so i
31:05
mean we know the last supper came really
31:07
close to destruction
31:08
uh during the war and the allies allied
31:10
forces bombed it and there's that
31:11
amazing picture of
31:13
the whole building destroyed except for
31:14
the one wall that's got a lot of supper
31:16
on it yeah wow
31:17
and so he was also sort of a bit of a
31:19
sculpture but the only sculpture we have
31:22
surviving of his is a beeswax model of a
31:25
horse that was supposed to be a model
31:26
for a proper sculpture like a plant
31:28
was that a model for he was going to do
31:30
a massive brass
31:32
man on a horse wasn't he called neil
31:34
colosso i think yes
31:35
and they basically got loads and loads
31:38
and loads of brass from all over the
31:39
country even all over europe maybe and
31:41
um they never made it because they went
31:44
to war and used them to make guns or
31:45
something
31:46
like that that was a different one from
31:47
the one made of beeswax but yeah it was
31:48
for the duke of milan that was one he
31:49
was talking about and then
31:50
he he had made a plaster cast of that
31:52
and there were he's waiting for the
31:53
bronze to arrive and then
31:54
they did they used the bronze for the
31:55
war and they used the plastic castle for
31:57
target practice
31:59
[Laughter]
32:01
the last couple was also used for target
32:02
practice i can't believe that really
32:04
when napoleon's forces were camped out
32:06
in that town they they why isn't it
32:08
more damaged they were aiming for
32:11
jesus's head
32:12
and they got one bullet through it and
32:14
it's been restored so
32:15
they were terrible as well yeah awful
32:17
thank god
32:19
poor guy just an entire history of his
32:21
works being destroyed
32:22
and you know rats ate another one of his
32:25
food sculptures
32:26
i think i was reading this in that was
32:28
the one he made out of cheese wasn't it
32:32
um this was so james you were asking at
32:34
the start how big his marzipan sculpture
32:35
was
32:36
and this particular one was an altar of
32:38
polenta and marzipan
32:40
he made for his patreon who was this guy
32:41
called ludovico
32:43
and it was for this guy's wedding and so
32:46
he made a sculpture our polenta in
32:48
marzipan that measured 72
32:50
square yards and was covered with cream
32:54
and he made this a few days before the
32:56
wedding and before the wedding could
32:57
happen it was eaten by rats and insects
32:59
in milan
33:01
it was such a thing marzipan it seems
33:03
that it was used for
33:04
table decoration as much as it was used
33:06
for eating and actually a huge
33:09
purpose of sweet food in the 16th and
33:10
17th centuries was
33:12
to decorate tables we might have said
33:14
before in fact i'm sure i must have said
33:15
it because it's one of my favorite ever
33:16
facts that antoine karem made
33:18
a marzipan vagina for someone's
33:20
christening
33:22
for the christening yeah it was the
33:23
christening of a of a noble person in
33:25
france i think it was
33:26
and um he made a clockwork vagina made
33:30
out of marzipan that a marzipan baby
33:32
came out of
33:33
i think we have definitely that before
33:35
and i think you can't say it too much i
33:37
think whenever it gets mentioned
33:38
you should leave it in my pant is
33:40
apparently incredibly malleable really
33:42
good it's like better than clay
33:44
for building a sculpture out so that's
33:45
why you liked it apparently it's better
33:46
than duct tape at
33:47
everything they made wallets out of it
33:50
they make flip-flops out of it
33:52
space flight marzipan has taken him
33:56
he's credited with inventing the napkin
33:58
as well
33:59
yes i've never heard that before
34:00
credited by idiots so yeah
34:02
yeah like he was invented the first cv
34:04
didn't he the first resume
34:06
did he did he yeah did he write on an
34:07
update
34:10
probably wrote the fact he made the
34:12
first tv on his tv as well oh yeah
34:14
inventor of the cv
34:17
again that just can't be true it can't
34:20
be true that he was the first person to
34:22
wipe his
34:22
mouth with a bit of cloth and it can't
34:24
be the truth that he was the first
34:25
person to write down everything
34:26
he what he did was he wrote when he was
34:28
serving at the table of his patron he
34:30
noticed that people would be just wiping
34:32
their
34:32
faces on the tablecloth or on each
34:34
other's clothes he wrote a list of
34:35
manners that were to be expected at the
34:37
table and one of them was
34:38
nobody should clean his knife with his
34:40
neighbor's clothes so people were just
34:41
cleaning stuff with whatever was to hand
34:43
and so he introduced the idea of giving
34:45
everyone a napkin specifically for
34:47
wiping their hands he's like well now
34:49
you finished eating my marzipan
34:50
sculpture i spent ages
34:52
at least wiping out your face
34:53
[Laughter]
34:56
some things that he definitely did
34:58
invent that didn't exist beforehand
35:00
were his weapons for war yeah so he
35:03
um he invented a mechanism for repelling
35:06
enemy ladders
35:07
i like wallace and grommet they're
35:08
brilliant yeah a more efficient way to
35:10
pour burning oil on enemy heads
35:13
finally a more efficient there's like an
35:17
infomercial with someone dropping all
35:18
the oil
35:19
i've never get it over my enemy soldiers
35:22
he also is supposed to have invented the
35:24
idea of the contact lens but i saw the
35:26
picture and
35:26
the idea is that it's a bowl basically a
35:28
bowl full of water that you put your
35:30
entire face in and the water refracts
35:32
which isn't really really cool did you
35:33
invent the snorkel as well
35:36
you can't really use it for any length
35:37
of time hang on so you plunge your face
35:39
into a bowl of water and open your eyes
35:41
and you can see better
35:42
yeah the water's supposed to counteract
35:44
the the refraction in the water is
35:45
supposed to counteract
35:46
the short-sightedness he sometimes
35:49
misfired didn't he i think
35:52
he pretty much always misfired a lot of
35:54
his medical um
35:55
ideas because he did the section which
35:57
was illegal but he
35:58
came up with lots of medical theories
36:01
which were
36:02
not accepted for hundreds of years but
36:04
the truth is that
36:06
people didn't read his work for hundreds
36:08
of years because it was illegible a lot
36:09
of it was written in code
36:11
so and a lot of it just wasn't read so
36:13
um
36:14
none of his scientific advancements were
36:17
ever really useful because by the time
36:19
people
36:19
translated his work and found out that
36:21
he'd come up with it they'd already made
36:22
those advancements
36:23
ah right oh really i think that's my
36:26
problem as well i have really bad
36:27
handwriting
36:30
so i assumed that there was a lot of
36:32
artwork that survives of leonardo da
36:34
vinci
36:35
for some reason in my head i had it at
36:37
over 100 at least
36:38
different paintings and wall paintings
36:40
and so on
36:41
but there's 15 and of the 15
36:44
a lot are disputed because he never
36:47
signed his name i think mona lisa might
36:48
be the only signed one is it
36:50
is it really i don't something in the
36:51
back of my head says i'm not sure it's
36:53
true
36:53
i'm not sure if it is mona lisa sign
36:55
because the thing i read said that
36:56
none of them are signed by him um maybe
36:59
it is so maybe that might be an
37:00
exception but
37:01
um a bunch of the paintings are disputed
37:03
no one all we are taking it
37:05
upon as a verification is that the
37:08
historian the art historian has said
37:10
i think that this definitely is leonardo
37:12
as well
37:13
paintings i think that's extraordinary
37:14
though so we're kind of attributing
37:17
a lot of the history of art to someone
37:18
that might not have done it well
37:20
if you go into an art gallery it'll
37:22
always be like that but our experts do
37:23
seem to have this bizarre magic knack of
37:25
telling exactly if a painting is painted
37:27
by someone or painted by their very
37:29
closely imitating people
37:31
there are lots of ways so mostly they
37:32
can tell yeah the brush strokes or the
37:35
type of paint that they used yeah all
37:37
sorts of different ways of doing it but
37:38
yeah
37:39
that's definitely true the mona lisa is
37:41
a great one because there's like three
37:42
or four different versions there's
37:44
there's the famous mona lisa topless one
37:46
yeah there's a nude one that was painted
37:48
at the moment
37:49
of vanna and it's supposedly painted by
37:50
his pupil sally and
37:52
we also know him from his notebooks
37:54
because you've got all of leonardo's
37:55
notebooks with his amazing backwards
37:56
handwriting and then you've just got
37:58
like shitty doodles of like penises with
38:00
legs running around
38:01
so i didn't know if that was real
38:02
because it looks so fake yeah sally was
38:04
apparently da vinci's lover as well
38:06
which i think is almost undisputed and
38:09
he took him in
38:10
very young age as an apprentice yeah and
38:12
yeah
38:13
because there are very bad penises with
38:15
legs drawings
38:16
apparently by him but i can't believe it
38:18
i'd love to see the original
38:19
yeah but yeah no it literally is his
38:21
version supposedly if it's his he just
38:23
did a version of the mona lisa that's
38:24
just gone and clothes on and then
38:25
there's also another mona lisa that is
38:27
supposed to be exactly the same that was
38:28
apparently done by another one of his
38:29
pupils which is in much better condition
38:31
because it's not famous
38:32
and it's just hanging somewhere just in
38:33
someone's living room
38:35
well one of the one of the paintings he
38:37
did that was disputed was his first ever
38:38
painting and this was going to be my
38:40
headline facts which is that the first
38:43
painting he painted
38:44
he had to paint as punishment for eating
38:46
too many sweets
38:47
but this is when he was an apprentice
38:49
and he worked in the studio of an artist
38:51
called viroccio
38:52
and he used to get packets of sweets
38:55
sent to him and apparently had a very
38:57
sweet tooth was responsible for crappy
38:59
lando which
39:00
essentially means stuffing your face and
39:02
so virocio punished him by instructing
39:04
him to paint an
39:05
angel in the corner of uh his big
39:07
picture of the baptism of christ
39:08
which i don't know why that's punishment
39:09
when you've come to study art
39:11
and you're yeah it's your main passion
39:13
but anyway that's apparently his first
39:15
painting is this angel if you look up
39:16
virtue's baptism of christ there's da
39:18
vinci's
39:19
little angel in the corner you know that
39:21
extremely old drawing of da vinci the
39:23
self-portrait
39:24
that's done in they call it the red
39:25
chalk one yeah so it's a kind of sketch
39:28
yeah um so even that is disputed about
39:30
whether or not that's da vinci and
39:32
whether or not
39:33
he did it himself and one of the main
39:35
reasons behind that is
39:36
the guy in the drawing is way older than
39:39
da vinci
39:40
live too yeah he's just way older um
39:42
maybe he's being modest
39:44
well no one so one of the theories that
39:45
allows them maybe he just looks a bit
39:47
rough that day
39:48
one of the theories is that he did draw
39:50
himself and that he drew himself older
39:52
because he was
39:53
using it to put forward to give to
39:55
rafael who was painting
39:56
plato in the school of athens and he
39:58
wanted to use da vinci
40:00
as the model but da vinci wasn't old
40:02
enough so he did an older version of
40:03
himself
40:04
but it would be quite accurate because
40:05
usually self-portraits are going to be
40:07
mirror images but he writes backwards
40:08
anyway
40:10
so he would have drawn it backwards yeah
40:11
so he inverts the mirror image
40:14
i look really weird
40:18
do you think i'll just do that when they
40:19
do a self-portrait they're looking in
40:21
the mirror and as soon as they finish
40:22
they step back and are like
40:23
oh is that what i look like why did no
40:26
one told me i have a green thing in my
40:27
teeth
40:29
oh no i've got my eyes closed
40:38
okay that's it that's all of our facts
40:40

00:00
hi guys just before we start this show
00:02
we wanted to let you know about
00:03
last week's show on which you might
00:05
remember we had a few
00:07
facts about leonardo da vinci that we
00:08
were slightly suspicious about and we
00:10
just asked someone if they could get in
00:11
touch
00:12
and provide us with a reliable source so
00:14
that all these things that sounded too
00:15
good to be true
00:16
could be verified as true and someone
00:19
did get in touch
00:21
to tell us that they weren't true i'm
00:23
afraid leonardo da vinci
00:24
doesn't seem to have had a long and
00:27
lustrous career as a chef
00:28
he may not have even made the giant
00:30
whisk
00:31
we fell for a hoax this is a hoax book
00:35
that was written in the 1980s it's
00:36
called notas de cocina
00:38
de leonardo da vinci and it's full of
00:41
lies
00:42
cruel lies that were then repeated in
00:44
biography after book after history
00:46
magazine
00:48
throughout the decade solely for the
00:49
purpose of making me
00:51
look like an idiot thanks so much to
00:54
pedro almada who is the person who
00:55
emailed in to tell us about that
00:57
original text
00:58
and who also managed to avoid writing in
01:01
huge capital letters
01:02
you total and utter gullible morons very
01:05
grateful to him for being so restrained
01:07
on that front and for letting us know
01:08
and i'm so sorry to the rest of you
01:10
for saying these things that turned out
01:13
not to be true
01:14
won't happen again i promise the
01:16
upcoming podcast is
01:18
almost entirely true okay on with the
01:24
show
01:26
[Music]
01:32
[Applause]
01:32
[Music]
01:36
hello and welcome to another episode of
01:39
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
01:42
coming to you from the qi offices in
01:43
covent garden
01:44
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
01:46
here next to andrew hunter murray anna
01:48
chazinski
01:49
and james harkin and once again we have
01:51
gathered around the microphones with our
01:53
four
01:53
favorite facts from the last seven days
01:55
and in no particular order
01:57
here we go starting with you james
02:00
harkin
02:01
okay my fact this week is that the least
02:03
creepy job
02:04
is that of a weather forecaster
02:08
according to you according to
02:11
a new paper from this year in the
02:14
journal new ideas in psychology called
02:17
on the nature of creepiness
02:20
by two scientists called francis t
02:22
mcandrew
02:23
and sarah s kernker and what did they do
02:26
that they personally meet up with
02:28
people yeah um no what they did is they
02:30
did a survey
02:31
of 1341 people and they
02:34
asked them they gave them a list of a
02:36
load of jobs and said which of these is
02:37
the most creepy
02:39
and the um top creepy job was clown
02:42
oh yeah followed by taxidermist
02:46
followed by sex shop owner oh
02:49
no i'm friends with loads of those and
02:52
then
02:52
funeral director and taxi driver taxi
02:56
driver just because it sounds like
02:56
taxidermist
02:58
is that the confusion there could it be
03:00
so this is only a small list of jobs
03:02
there were 21 jobs in total so things
03:04
like weird butcher weren't on the list
03:06
which might be even creepier than clown
03:08
but
03:11
you've got the normal butcher and then
03:12
the next door shop is always the weird
03:13
butcher yeah he's always rubbing his
03:15
hands on the offal
03:18
so who who else is on the list um so the
03:20
bottom three as in
03:22
the uh least creepy meteorologist or
03:24
weather forecaster
03:25
came at least creepy followed by teacher
03:28
and then farmer
03:29
okay i'm quite surprised by teacher
03:31
because not that teachers are creepy
03:33
generally but
03:34
you often would hear school children
03:36
saying about teachers are creepy and
03:38
stuff
03:38
yeah maybe it's a survey done once
03:39
people have grown up exactly
03:41
nowadays everyone thinks of teachers as
03:43
being great because you know you think
03:44
oh what a good profession to be in
03:46
sort of everyone has had one creepy
03:48
teacher though it's sort of unfair to
03:49
lump an entire profession into
03:51
creepiness isn't it based on probably
03:53
one person's experience a weird physics
03:55
teacher
03:55
i reckon i'd answer that a creepy job
03:57
was a hairdresser because i had like one
04:00
creepy hairdresser once
04:02
um you know and then i think that
04:03
affects your view of the whole
04:04
profession yeah
04:05
my parents are hairdressers yeah that's
04:07
the one we're talking about yeah
04:09
your mum just really strange so what is
04:12
being creepy
04:14
okay so um being creepy is kind of a
04:17
feeling of unease about somebody
04:20
uh and it's interesting i read this
04:22
paper um and they say
04:24
it's not just that you feel like you're
04:26
gonna be in harm because if someone
04:28
comes at you with an
04:29
axe you wouldn't say that's creepy you'd
04:31
say that's just scary
04:34
it was really creepy it's so creepy
04:36
wasn't it it's creepy
04:39
such a creep we were talking about this
04:42
the other day that the certain words
04:44
that uh get given over to sort of like
04:46
murders and stuff
04:47
that are just a bit too playground so
04:50
copycat
04:51
yeah that's just like stealing my
04:53
murders you're nothing but a
04:59
that's the same creepy but yeah
05:01
creepiness is more like the potential to
05:03
do harm isn't it yeah
05:04
or actually it's a lot more like um the
05:06
ambiguity of whether someone might do
05:08
you harm or might not do your harm
05:10
yeah um so yeah maybe this is why
05:12
because i think this study also had the
05:14
creepiest hobbies what people found were
05:16
the creepiest hobbies for people to have
05:18
and the top creepiest hobbies were
05:20
collecting things
05:22
that's right which i think that's so the
05:24
examples it gives are
05:25
um dolls insects and body parts
05:29
well i think adults and insects i'd be
05:31
upset if i was lumped in with body part
05:33
collectors
05:34
it actually said that body parts such as
05:36
teeth bones or fingernails
05:38
were considered especially creepy so
05:40
just a few more things from this study
05:42
yeah before we move on um they asked for
05:45
creepy traits
05:47
and what they did was they said imagine
05:49
a creepy person is talking to your
05:50
friend what traits might this creepy
05:52
person have
05:54
and ones that they went for were the
05:56
person stood too close to your friend
05:58
[Music]
05:59
the person licked his or her lips
06:02
frequently
06:03
is that their own lips or the lips of
06:06
your friend
06:06
[Laughter]
06:08
and the person laughed at unpredictable
06:11
times
06:12
ah i would put sorry
06:19
i would put oscillating on there as well
06:22
oscillating as in kind of rocking yeah
06:24
just rocking i
06:25
find that a bit odd sure i'll be i'll be
06:27
in bookshops there's always an older guy
06:29
standing looking at a sort of
06:30
uh the the naughty section of a bookshop
06:32
you know sort of like a
06:34
romance erotica and they oscillate and i
06:37
always say don't go near an oscillating
06:38
man but is that well down to the
06:40
position that he's in
06:41
as in he's in the in the sexy
06:43
departments of the bookshop
06:45
like if he was oscillating somewhere
06:46
else in the bookshop would it be less
06:48
weird because actually like sexual
06:50
predation
06:50
is one of the things which people
06:52
associate with creepiness of course
06:54
right that is creepy
06:55
yes i concur did you um did you guys see
06:58
that on the list as well was uh bird
07:00
watching bird watchers
07:03
it was quite unfair and a guy who is a
07:05
bird watcher
07:06
wrote an article on his website called
07:08
audobon
07:09
and he just wrote he said i'm just going
07:11
to step away from my usual articles
07:12
because i need to address this
07:13
creepiness thing
07:14
and he said here are a few of my
07:16
thoughts number one first of all only
07:18
squares use the term bird watching
07:20
it's birding that's a serious burden
07:23
here yeah he sounds like not a square he
07:24
sounds like he's a cool guy and he says
07:26
and he says as well like what they're
07:27
not
07:28
what they're suggesting is that bird
07:29
watchers just stand there watching birds
07:31
it's not about that it's about going to
07:32
exotic locations it's adventure
07:33
this month sounds misinformed because
07:35
bird watching is not going to look for a
07:37
rare bird that's twitching
07:39
that's the thing that the bird watching
07:40
community gets quite annoyed about so
07:41
twitching are the people who are just in
07:42
it for the excitement who they hear
07:44
there's been a weird parrot spotting in
07:46
cornwall and they get down there
07:47
watching is sitting in your garden or in
07:49
a forest all day
07:50
usually listening out for bird calls
07:52
because you can't see well he does say
07:53
listening
07:54
and thinking and anticipating i can't
07:57
wait for the letters after anna said
07:58
that this guy who writes about i know
08:00
i know the website on audubon which is
08:02
the most famous bird watching website
08:03
yeah yeah
08:04
i think this is it's his site um he just
08:06
to the final point number four
08:08
is he says you know who i think the real
08:09
creeps are here these psychologists
08:12
sitting around thinking about what's
08:13
creepy all day constantly asking people
08:15
do you think this is creepy
08:16
and how about this creepy what a bunch
08:19
of creeps
08:19
i think these scientists should get out
08:20
of the lab a bit more maybe pick up a
08:22
hobby i know the perfect one
08:26
do you know who came up with the term
08:28
the creeps as in that gives me the
08:30
creeps no charles dickens
08:32
david copperfield that's the first use
08:34
that the oxford dictionary has
08:35
and was it in reference to bird watchers
08:37
it was not
08:39
and it also at around that time mid 19th
08:42
century
08:42
uh creepiness was known as being clammy
08:44
if you that was another way of
08:46
describing someone who was a creep
08:47
oh yeah they were very clammy yeah so i
08:50
think the reason
08:51
just to explain why bird watching and
08:53
other it was bird watching and
08:55
other hobbies that involve watching like
08:57
the other examples given word
08:59
taking pictures of people watching
09:01
children
09:04
pornography and bird watching so you
09:06
can't see why he was upset at being
09:07
lumped in with those guys yeah
09:09
yeah but um this study the study
09:11
concludes by saying that um
09:13
creepy people are the personification of
09:15
something called the prospect
09:17
refuge theory uh which is this idea that
09:20
humans seek places
09:21
where you get refuge so safety and you
09:24
get prospects so
09:25
opportunity and basically what that
09:26
means is places where you can hide
09:28
easily
09:29
but you can see lots of other things
09:31
around you potential threats and i think
09:33
maybe the idea of people who watch is
09:34
that they're
09:35
concealed so a bird watcher is watching
09:37
you but often you can't see
09:39
him if you're a bird and that's why in
09:42
like a victorian house we'd be creeped
09:43
out because there are lots of nooks and
09:44
crannies people could
09:46
you know round corners that people could
09:47
be hiding in and if you're on a big
09:49
open moor land people often find that a
09:51
bit uncomfortable because
09:52
there's no way you can hide sure when i
09:54
used to play laser quest when i was a
09:56
teenager i used to like to hide in the
09:58
corner
09:58
so that no one could shoot me
10:02
from where i was does that make me
10:03
creepy yes and i also hate people who do
10:05
that
10:05
yeah i know yeah well i was all with
10:07
herself yeah i played uh two weeks ago
10:09
laser quest
10:11
wow it was great fun that's i'm afraid
10:13
that's the extent of the fact
10:15
my fact this week i'm back in the 90s
10:19
really good it's great so i think it was
10:21
discovered by maybe richard
10:23
wiseman did a study in the early 2000s
10:25
and someone else before that that
10:26
any area that has infrasound any sound
10:29
that's below 20 hertz which is basically
10:31
below the level at which humans can hear
10:33
makes us creeped out somehow even though
10:35
we don't know it so he did this study in
10:37
edinburgh and he sent people to two
10:38
apparently haunted locations and two not
10:40
haunted but didn't tell them which were
10:42
which
10:42
and they were more scared in the
10:44
apparently haunted ones and then he
10:45
realized that's because
10:46
there was this constant rumble i think
10:48
it was caused by the traffic but it was
10:50
just below that frequency which we can
10:51
hear there i i'm sure this must be made
10:54
up i remember
10:55
at school someone telling me that when
10:57
hitler did all of his speeches
10:59
what they used to do is before he came
11:00
on there was it was that kind of noise
11:02
so there was an unsettled feeling
11:04
amongst everyone who was there for the
11:05
speech and then as soon as
11:07
hitler would come out they would turn
11:08
the sound off and the matching of the
11:10
sense of calm from the sound
11:11
disappearing
11:12
with this person who you would like to
11:13
see was like ah
11:15
our our leaders here kind of thing is
11:17
that true at all um
11:18
i've read that right i don't know if
11:20
it's true do you think theresa may just
11:21
keeps forgetting to turn the machine off
11:22
when she starts
11:27
um clowning was number one on the list
11:29
of creepy
11:30
occupations right yeah um so the
11:33
clowning community is very aware
11:35
that they are being seen as creepy and
11:37
they need to do something about it
11:38
so one of the things is that they teach
11:40
uh people who are petrified of clowns
11:43
not to be petrified by inviting them to
11:44
come along and they give them
11:45
counselling
11:46
they call it and counseling sessions
11:48
involve meeting the person
11:50
they then get done they're made up done
11:53
and stuff in front of them and then you
11:54
see them in the circus and you realize
11:55
it's a normal person
11:57
behind the clown face did you see this
12:00
uh last few weeks in the news there have
12:01
been some clown
12:03
sightings in south carolina no they're
12:05
not native to south carolina that
12:07
doesn't make any sense what do you mean
12:08
clown
12:08
sightings so they have been reported
12:11
sightings of lurking creepy clowns
12:14
um that people have been telling the
12:15
police about police in south carolina
12:18
have warned that anyone dressed as a
12:20
clown
12:20
could face a rest because so many people
12:23
are being scared by these clowns
12:25
uh and at least one performer in georgia
12:27
has decided to inform police of his
12:29
movements whenever in costume
12:31
so that he doesn't get arrested it's not
12:33
what's the what's the offense there
12:35
because it's not an offense to be creepy
12:36
no but there's reports of them kind of
12:39
trying to get children into the woods
12:41
there you go but here's the thing right
12:43
in um
12:45
1981 there was a very similar thing
12:47
happening
12:48
um where people saw these clowns and
12:51
they were
12:52
supposedly kind of luring children into
12:54
woods and stuff like that
12:56
there was one um one event where there
12:58
was a clown who only had half his clown
13:00
suit on
13:00
um and he was even more scary because he
13:02
didn't have the bottom half on
13:04
he was naked from the waist down right
13:07
yeah um
13:08
but they had over 20 calls at this time
13:10
and it was in the newspapers
13:11
but they found out that basically no
13:13
adults had seen any of these clowns
13:15
and they reckoned that maybe it was just
13:17
overactive imagination of kids
13:19
and that was what caused it oh okay i'm
13:21
scared of clowns again now
13:23
all that counselling i had clearly gone
13:26
out there four years of counselling
13:29
and actually these ones in south
13:31
carolina at the moment i think no
13:33
policeman has actually seen any of these
13:35
clowns either so i wonder if it also
13:37
might be
13:37
another kind of example of mass hysteria
13:39
that's another example of also a
13:41
playground word
13:42
for effectively what sounds like sexual
13:44
predators on the go those clowns
13:46
we'll get those clowns one day
13:50
i have one more creepy thing before we
13:51
move on yeah sure um
13:53
there was a news report about donations
13:56
left to shelter scotland
13:57
a homeless charity and they gave their
14:00
weirdest and creepiest donations
14:02
a mummified cat and a sack of creepy
14:06
severed dolls heads
14:08
with their eyelids glued shut yeah that
14:11
was donated to a charity donated to a
14:13
charity
14:15
possible use could you have in the
14:17
charity shop
14:18
because sometimes the doll's heads fall
14:20
off and you need a replacement you need
14:21
a report well i love these doll heads
14:22
but i'm afraid the eyes are just too
14:24
open for me
14:25
no thanks
14:32
okay it's time for fact number two and
14:35
that is
14:35
my fact my fact this week is that
14:38
self-driving cars are playing grand
14:40
theft auto
14:41
in order to learn how to drive better so
14:44
this
14:44
is scientists are basically
14:48
teaching self-driving cars to identify
14:50
stuff
14:51
better and that's quite hard when you
14:53
don't have a program
14:54
that has things mapped out because you
14:56
need it you need to do it you need to
14:57
teach the algorithms to
14:58
to learn better to understand what every
15:00
single potential thing you might
15:02
encounter on the street is
15:03
and they realize that instead of having
15:05
to build all these programs that
15:07
simulate a real life driving experience
15:09
why not use something that is
15:10
extraordinarily detailed like grand
15:12
theft auto
15:13
and let it play it and let it just
15:15
understand and start labeling
15:17
all the things that you don't want to
15:18
run over there's this lab in germany
15:21
which has developed this it's basically
15:23
a software layer that sits in between
15:26
the game
15:27
and the car and the idea is that it's
15:30
just automatically starts classifying
15:31
all the things and feeding it into the
15:33
algorithm
15:33
do you think the game would be annoyed
15:35
if it knew that it was being played by a
15:38
not a human what do you mean by that
15:41
andy
15:41
i don't know i think you thought that
15:44
was a more profound question than it
15:45
actually was
15:46
but it's interesting you've got one
15:47
virtual reality thing interacting with
15:49
another
15:50
yeah and it's pretty weird so i read a
15:52
list of how detailed grand theft
15:54
auto is now some of the things that
15:55
they've programmed into it if you were
15:57
playing the game that you would notice
15:58
um so if it begins raining puddles will
16:01
slowly and realistically form in the
16:03
road
16:04
and if you shave your head or you have a
16:07
clean shave your hair and stubble will
16:09
grow
16:09
at the same rate that uh say if it was
16:12
mine
16:12
like they just calculated one person's
16:14
growth it's stuff like that they've
16:15
really gone
16:16
yours is quite fast growth yes mine's
16:18
available
16:19
if it was mine it wouldn't be fast
16:20
growth at all so yeah have they taken an
16:22
average of everyone no i guess i guess
16:24
they've just used one
16:25
person's it's the idea of hair growth so
16:27
it all like well that's not realistic at
16:29
all what are the cars going to do when
16:30
they're put into real life
16:31
and they come up against someone who
16:32
doesn't have such fast growing hair
16:34
they're going to absolutely freak out
16:36
really good point on the bright side
16:38
people always get uh
16:40
critical of grand theft auto and kids
16:42
playing it because it maybe teaches them
16:43
to commit crimes but
16:45
it's quite safe for a car to play a game
16:47
about stealing cars because a car has no
16:49
incentive
16:50
to steal a car that's true it's like
16:52
teaching it about real life
16:54
this is what might happen to you yeah
16:56
it's a warning video
16:58
yeah there was i read an article about
17:00
someone who was in a
17:01
google self-driving car and they were
17:03
saying that it's really interesting
17:04
because the car uses a mixture of 3d
17:06
laser mapping gps
17:08
radar and um when they're using the
17:10
radar
17:11
the radar goes through objects as
17:12
opposed to just slapping
17:15
onto something as it were so like our
17:17
eyes do yeah when your eyes slap
17:19
when you slap onto you're supposed to
17:21
sing through it yeah
17:23
but so as a result there are moments
17:25
when this person was in the car
17:27
where the car would suddenly stop um
17:29
because it
17:30
recognized the cyclist who was halted
17:33
and they would have gone into it except
17:34
for the fact that the cyclist was on the
17:35
other side of a hedge
17:37
whoa so it could see through the hedge
17:40
to see a cyclist it was going head-on
17:43
what would it register that as would it
17:45
register that as a sort of
17:47
spread out i don't think cars need to
17:49
register a thickness do they
17:51
pass the certain thickness mist becomes
17:53
fog okay so a really heavy fog
17:56
yeah i think my point stands no fog has
17:59
ever been
17:59
so heavy to act as a wall against a car
18:03
so it would have to be what are you
18:04
saying is that they don't use cameras
18:05
they use radar
18:06
yeah so it would have to be a fog thick
18:08
enough to show on radar
18:09
yeah okay like a fog of insects like
18:12
sometimes if there's a load of insects
18:13
kind of like mayflies all come at the
18:15
same time right
18:16
there what about what about that anna
18:18
what about a plague of
18:20
uh locusts or cicadas yeah which is in
18:23
the middle of the road
18:24
james i don't know why you're trying to
18:25
dig andy out of this it's very generous
18:28
obviously help me i thought it was an
18:30
extremely profound question
18:31
thank you google cards just had their
18:35
first
18:36
accident caused by google car rather
18:39
than a person
18:40
i think fatality no i'm the smallest car
18:43
accident you could possibly imagine
18:45
it was uh in february this year and it
18:48
actually exploded something quite clever
18:49
that i didn't realize they do which is
18:51
they've trained google cars to what you
18:53
know when you're going along a main road
18:55
and you need to turn
18:56
right off the road and there's traffic
18:58
coming the other way
18:59
so if you just stay in the middle of
19:00
your lane then you hold up all the
19:01
traffic behind you so what you usually
19:03
do is
19:03
edge to the right hand side of your lane
19:05
so that traffic can get around you
19:07
and they've taught the google cars to do
19:09
that so a google car
19:10
needed to turn right so edged to the
19:11
right hand side of his lane but then
19:13
spotted the um i don't know why they've
19:15
installed this in the area where they're
19:16
training the cars but there's a bunch of
19:18
sandbags blocking its route
19:19
and so then it indicated left to get
19:21
back into the middle of the lane
19:23
and it scraped up at two miles an hour
19:25
against a bus
19:26
that was coming on its left-hand side so
19:28
that was pretty dramatic
19:29
was it in britain this no i don't think
19:32
it was i think was in america
19:33
so that would be turning left rather
19:35
than right would it i
19:36
absolutely would be i've said uh so
19:38
listen to what i just said and then swap
19:40
around all the lefts and rights
19:41
right and then you've got it
19:46
have you seen the rolls-royce one that
19:47
they've developed i'll put this up on
19:50
twitter but it's
19:51
the photo on twitter but it's worth you
19:52
guys seeing what twitter you gonna put
19:54
it down i'll put on
19:55
qi podcast um this is a design that
19:58
they're planning to actually
19:59
wear wheels yeah square wheels it's a
20:01
silver beast
20:02
it looks like it's from isn't that the
20:04
jetsons just listening to this you're
20:06
not on twitter it does not have square
20:08
wheels
20:08
it's got sort of wheeled guards on it
20:10
yes that's right
20:12
yeah are you sure that's not just a car
20:13
that's still mounted on its block
20:15
in the display room it looks like a
20:16
monopoly piece doesn't it that's the
20:18
best way to describe
20:23
imagine if all the self-driving cars all
20:25
look like different monopoly pieces
20:27
that'd be amazing
20:28
oh my god driving around yeah giant top
20:31
hat
20:32
cruisers and what's the new one
20:35
they've introduced the character oh yeah
20:37
the internet you'd always swear at the
20:39
cat wouldn't you
20:39
just new fangled youth yeah it's not
20:43
gone down too well
20:44
this car in terms of design i like the
20:46
design but um they said in the article
20:48
one reviewer has called the car
20:50
but ugly and i think maybe a lot of
20:52
people will agree but i think it looks
20:54
awesome
20:57
[Laughter]
21:00
well the point of driverless cars i
21:01
think of the design for instance that
21:03
google's going for is to make them look
21:04
incredibly friendly because
21:06
uh we're quite very nervous about
21:08
handing our lives over to robots even
21:10
though that's not really justified we
21:11
are
21:12
and that looks like a very intimidating
21:14
car so i think they've gone entirely the
21:15
wrong direction
21:16
so that the google cars if you look at
21:17
them they've sort of made a face on the
21:19
front of them
21:19
yeah like a friendly face the lights are
21:21
a pair of eyes and then below the bumper
21:23
it's like a smiling mouse
21:24
zaps they must take us for these killer
21:27
robots are smiling
21:28
i think it's true though because you
21:30
know the new london red buses
21:31
to me they look like they're pissed off
21:33
with me anytime i see one from the front
21:35
i'm like that bus is angry
21:36
it's the drivers and it's because you
21:39
keep standing in front of them
21:43
so there was an interview with a guy
21:44
called barry kirk who was an expert from
21:46
the canadian
21:47
automated vehicle center of excellence
21:50
and he was very worried that people
21:51
would start having sex in driverless
21:53
cars oh yeah because
21:54
you're not driving so what are you going
21:56
to do like yeah whenever i'm not driving
21:58
i'm always having sex
22:01
um but that's why you're driving to sex
22:04
driving away from sex
22:05
or having sex or driving people away
22:07
from sex
22:09
um he was saying yeah he reckons that
22:12
people will be in cars and they'll not
22:13
be driving and they'll be like well what
22:15
we're going to do so we'll have sex and
22:16
he thinks that's going to be a problem
22:18
because
22:18
all right mom
22:23
every school run
22:27
um but yeah he thinks that this he
22:29
thinks that this is a problem because
22:30
um when the humans have to kind of take
22:33
over because something goes wrong
22:34
they'll be
22:34
they'll be having sex yeah right i'll be
22:38
playing a board game
22:40
i'll be really folding a cardigan
22:44
andy's post-sex ritual
22:49
let's add these chats up like nice
22:51
cardigan i'll be folding that later
22:55
you know what your cardigan would look
22:56
good folded up
22:59
in a drawer
23:00
[Laughter]
23:04
do you guys know how old driverless cars
23:06
are when they date back to
23:08
five years that is thanks that's really
23:11
sweet of you to do that because it's
23:12
actually much longer ago than that is it
23:14
and it's gonna make my fact sound even
23:16
better
23:16
five thousand years you dig
23:20
um no so the earliest driverless cars
23:22
date back to the 1920s
23:24
and actually you'll see uh various
23:26
articles refer to the earliest one has
23:28
been called the linwrick and wonder
23:29
which was made in 1926
23:31
and it was radio controlled and so there
23:33
was someone driving in a car behind it
23:34
who had a radio connection to the car in
23:36
front
23:37
then i looked i searched in the british
23:38
newspaper archive for this and there's
23:40
actually an earlier one
23:41
that it referenced in 1921 so this was
23:44
in ohio
23:45
and again it was the same idea it was
23:46
invented by this guy called captain
23:47
vaughan
23:48
who drove another car 17 yards behind it
23:50
and controlled it with a little remote
23:51
control oh wow
23:53
and um it said the article said to the
23:55
dis to the surprise and dismay of
23:56
passers-by
23:57
it made its way through the main streets
23:59
obeying the traffic signals taking the
24:00
turns and blowing its own horn at
24:02
careless pedestrians so you could all
24:04
have an automated horn as well
24:06
some things on grand theft auto yeah
24:08
sure so
24:09
if you um you can get your character on
24:12
grand theft auto
24:13
look at their smartphone and open some
24:15
websites
24:17
and grand theft auto has more websites
24:19
than
24:20
north korea whoa wow
24:24
there are 83 sites available on the game
24:27
and there are 28 sites in the whole of
24:30
the north korean
24:31
intra web wow that they're allowed to go
24:33
on the guy
24:34
who voices a character called michael in
24:37
grand theft auto a guy called ned luke
24:40
um he put on 25 pounds for the role
24:43
except for the voice
24:44
wow
24:47
he said he wanted to really get into the
24:49
physicality of this role
24:51
put on some weight dedication that's
24:53
amazing that's incredible
24:56
if you um complete the game having found
24:59
every peyote location this is grand
25:01
theft auto 5
25:03
and complete the mission the last one
25:05
without killing the sasquatch first
25:08
and then you play another go of the game
25:10
as franklin
25:11
on a tuesday between 5 30 and 8 30
25:14
while the weather is foggy then you can
25:17
play
25:18
as a bigfoot that play as a yeti awesome
25:22
that's so cool oh there must be videos
25:24
of that on
25:25
youtube probably yeah yeah and it was
25:26
for a long time it was a
25:28
kind of a conspiracy theory between
25:30
grand theft auto players that you would
25:32
be able to do this but no one knew how
25:33
to do it and then someone just found out
25:35
right um that you're describing that
25:37
knowing that you've never played it
25:39
uh and neither have i it was kind of
25:40
like listening to grandparents talk
25:42
about the internet
25:42
like yesterday when my friend's mum
25:44
asked me to send her an app
25:46
of the show that i do oh yeah yeah
25:49
just hearing you trying to pronounce all
25:50
the words in grand theft auto
25:52
it was most of those words were
25:54
perfectly normal english words you just
25:56
sounded not comfortable doing it you're
25:57
quite right
26:00
[Applause]
26:05
okay it is time for fact number three
26:07
and that is
26:08
andy my fact is that kookaburras are
26:11
born with a hook in their upper beak
26:12
which is specifically for murdering
26:14
their siblings
26:16
we all have that okay that was creepy
26:21
so this is what's known technically as a
26:23
morphological specialization for
26:25
sibling rivalry so it's basically like
26:27
having an arm just for hitting your
26:28
brother
26:28
with actually with my brother that was
26:30
his own arm
26:34
why are you stabbing yourself in the
26:36
beak
26:39
um yeah so so kookaburras they have this
26:41
thing where they always lay three eggs
26:43
and they
26:44
they hatch out at separate times and in
26:46
about half of kookaburra broods uh the
26:49
youngest
26:50
one to hatch is killed by their siblings
26:52
and uh their siblings
26:53
they peck it to death uh normally um or
26:56
they push it out of the nest and it just
26:58
helps the other two
26:59
get to a larger weight when they fly the
27:02
nest which allows them to be more
27:03
successful breeding later on
27:05
and it's basically done as an insurance
27:07
policy by the parents because
27:09
there is a chance that one of the first
27:11
two will die and that will limit your
27:13
reproductive success
27:14
so as a result you have the third one
27:16
just in case
27:18
but normally it's clear that um it won't
27:20
be required so it's really brutal but
27:22
they're a substitute yeah it's like
27:23
being on the bench
27:24
except at the end of the match you don't
27:25
celebrate with the team you get killed
27:27
by them
27:27
yeah yeah and there's a few birds that
27:31
do this actually
27:32
um honey guides they do this and um
27:36
one of the children will peck the other
27:38
one blindly before it's even opened its
27:40
eyes
27:40
so just been born still blind and he
27:43
just kind of blindly pecks around
27:45
until it hits its brother or sister and
27:46
then just murder them and is it is it
27:48
definitely know what it's doing or is it
27:51
is it kind of just like i've just been
27:53
born i'm just as much as birds
27:55
ever know what they're doing
27:59
it's not an accident that i mean i think
28:01
you couldn't really defend the
28:02
accidental
28:03
repeated killing of your siblings just
28:05
saying you were flailing around
28:07
yeah definitely i wouldn't say it's an
28:08
accident okay so they mean no
28:10
so for instance black eagles do this as
28:12
well
28:13
and um once they were studying them and
28:15
they found that one of the larger
28:16
eaglets pecked the smaller one 1569
28:20
times before it died
28:22
right so you couldn't really call that
28:23
an accident right
28:25
there is a thing about uh eagles this is
28:28
bald eagles i think but um
28:30
it's really interesting so they they
28:31
have again three three chicks and
28:33
the first two to hatch they have this
28:35
massive dose of testosterone in the egg
28:37
yolk
28:38
um and there's a scientist from the
28:39
university of oklahoma called douglas
28:41
mark who said i think this is brilliant
28:43
the yolk is like a bagged lunch that the
28:45
kid takes to school
28:46
you can either give your kid a lunch
28:48
packed with steroids
28:49
so he'll be a brood by recess or you can
28:52
give him peanut butter
28:53
and so the third the third one born
28:55
doesn't have the huge mega dose of
28:56
testosterone you'd be called in by the
28:58
teachers saying
28:59
your son's lunchbox today was the
29:02
youngest with the peanut butter that's
29:03
fine but
29:04
old steroids that's not an acceptable
29:07
punch
29:09
so this is what's so cruel about it is
29:11
the parents sort of deliberately set the
29:13
situation up and sometimes the kids will
29:15
be fighting and the parent knows which
29:16
is the weakest the one which needs to
29:17
die and we'll
29:18
hold that one down so that the others
29:20
can get at it oh
29:22
it's a really bad example to be setting
29:24
your children i think yeah yeah
29:26
it is do you know what i thought was
29:27
weird about kookaburras is that the
29:29
um female who gives birth can controls
29:32
the timing of when she lays the eggs and
29:33
that's part of her strategy
29:35
so by uh timing them so that the eggs
29:37
hatch at different times it means that
29:38
they're slightly different sizes the
29:40
kids so it sets up some to be able to
29:42
beat the others
29:42
right but also the first egg that she
29:45
lays is male
29:46
and the second egg is female so the
29:47
first egg to hatch is male
29:49
second is female and the third is 50 50.
29:51
it could go either way lucky dip
29:52
yeah wow isn't that strange you know
29:54
kookaburras used to be called the haha
29:56
pigeon
29:59
isn't that the best nickname i thought
30:01
they were called laughing jackasses they
30:02
get called that
30:03
they have a lot of names yeah the
30:04
breakfast bird because
30:06
they have this really loud laugh and it
30:09
sounds like
30:09
they got called the settler's clock wait
30:11
hang on hey god why
30:13
you started explaining why they're
30:14
called breakfast it wakes you up for
30:16
breakfast
30:18
i was thinking well i don't always laugh
30:20
when i'm eating my brown flakes
30:23
and i was thinking can i buy these in
30:24
tesco fry them up with an egg so
30:26
you do have to finish these sentences
30:28
sorry breakfast bird or settlers clock
30:29
or they also get called the giant
30:31
kingfisher because they are the largest
30:32
member of the kingfisher family they're
30:33
in the family
30:35
i think haha pigeon's the best though
30:37
that's brilliant
30:38
there was uh there's a very famous
30:39
aussie song that we used to sing as kids
30:42
uh kookaburra sits on the old gum tree
30:44
very classic song
30:45
and i was reading about that song
30:46
because um obviously
30:48
it is very famous and i googled it and
30:50
what came up was that
30:51
there's an aussie show called spicks and
30:53
specs uh
30:54
ages ago this happened adam hills was
30:56
the host and it's like never mind the
30:58
buzzcocks of australia
30:59
one of the questions was which song
31:02
which famous song
31:03
has uh kookaburras sits on the old gum
31:05
tree in it
31:06
and the answer was men it works i come
31:08
from a land down under
31:10
now no one had made that connection
31:12
before and so the people who own the
31:14
rights to the song kookaburra sits on
31:15
the other hand tree
31:16
got in touch sued men at work and won
31:20
and 4.5 million dollars roughly in that
31:23
region after years and years
31:25
of them having to battle it out in court
31:27
got handed over
31:28
and they they lost the case and they
31:30
proved that there were two flute moments
31:32
in it that copy
31:33
the lines from this song which was
31:35
written by an aussie school teacher and
31:36
then handed over to a library
31:38
um yeah that's i bet they felt bad
31:41
whoever
31:42
set that question yeah
31:47
it would have been adam hills i imagine
31:48
yeah just a headline i found which was
31:51
sausage addicted kookaburra too fat to
31:54
fly
31:54
i thought i'd share that one yet you
31:56
didn't um read the full article which i
31:58
did
31:59
yeah we all read the article that's what
32:02
we've done
32:02
some links you just can't not click she
32:05
was a cookaboo and she became very fat
32:07
but from sausage handouts
32:09
the article said the article really is
32:12
kind of summed up quite well at the
32:13
headline there isn't it yeah
32:15
yeah reading was quite disappointing
32:17
really there was very little more to be
32:18
gained well it gets attacked by dogs at
32:19
one point and then people notice it
32:21
because they smell like sausages
32:25
someone thought oh no the poor thing it
32:27
must have broken its wing and i'm being
32:29
able to protect itself from the dogs i
32:30
know it's just been eating sausages so
32:32
it can't fly away
32:34
did you read that thing uh someone sent
32:35
this to us i think mark abrams had
32:37
retweeted it
32:38
mark abrams of the ignoble prize had
32:39
retweeted it and
32:41
it was from errol flynn's autobiography
32:44
i saw the tweet but i didn't read it yet
32:46
okay so what what did you read it andy
32:48
it's basically he suddenly says that his
32:49
autobiography that he started
32:51
experimenting
32:52
on ducks he's like i did a lot of
32:54
scientific experiments on ducks and he
32:56
had read
32:56
that if you gave ducks a bit of pork so
32:59
i'm just going off
33:00
uh kookaburras eating sausages if you
33:02
gave ducks a bit of pork
33:04
it immediately goes through the system
33:05
within like two to three minutes they
33:07
pour it out on the other side
33:08
so he had a thought of what if i tied a
33:10
bit of string to the pork
33:12
and let it go through the duck and he
33:13
did and so it went through
33:15
and then he gave another bit of pork to
33:17
another duck and another duck and he
33:19
basically created a string of dust
33:21
centipede
33:22
human exactly duck centipede and uh
33:25
and he used to charge people to come and
33:27
see his scientific experiments
33:29
and people would come and watch dark
33:30
centerpiece this is awful yeah it's in
33:32
his autobiography it got sent around on
33:34
twitter
33:34
wow yeah do you know there are some
33:37
plants
33:38
which engage in siblicide really
33:41
yeah wow so um there's a tree in india
33:43
called the delbergia or dalbergia tree
33:45
and it makes all these flat pods full of
33:47
seeds and the seeds get dispersed by the
33:49
wind they get spread around so you get
33:51
more trees elsewhere
33:52
in the seed pod the very first seed to
33:54
develop produces these
33:56
chemicals which gas all the other seeds
33:59
in the pod wow yeah and it means that it
34:01
is much likelier to be the one which
34:03
survives
34:03
it's not crazy very clever
34:07
[Applause]
34:08
[Music]
34:11
okay it is time for our final fact of
34:14
the show and that
34:15
is anna chazinski my fact is that the
34:18
first
34:18
ever mention of paper recommended it as
34:21
a cure for frizzy hair
34:23
how does this cure work uh great
34:26
question well i don't think it does
34:28
step one sorry james um just go to boots
34:30
if i were you
34:31
but this i read this in a book called
34:33
paper trail by a guy called alexander
34:35
monroe which is such a good book
34:37
really readable really interesting and
34:39
he cites this bamboo document which was
34:41
found in a chinese tomb in 217 bc
34:44
and that document uses the chinese for
34:48
paper in it for the first time but the
34:50
context in which it uses it
34:52
is it says if a man's hair without
34:54
reason
34:55
stands erect like worms whiskers or
34:57
eyebrows
35:00
sorry erect like worms yeah i know
35:03
i don't maybe worms were different back
35:05
then
35:06
if a man's hair stands erect like worms
35:09
whiskers or eyebrows he would have
35:10
encountered a bad spirit to resolve this
35:12
boil a hemp shoe
35:13
with paper and the evil will be
35:15
dismissed
35:17
that's when paper paper first came into
35:19
our lives yes being boiled with a shoe
35:21
wow amazing so this is the word it's g
35:24
is that how you pronounce it sure h i
35:27
yes that hi true okay uh and
35:30
i'm also reading a book about paper at
35:33
the moment by mark kulanski
35:35
uh and he um has another time when they
35:37
use this word very early it was in 93
35:39
bc and it wasn't when a guard advised
35:42
the prince to hide his deformed
35:44
nose with a piece of paper did he draw a
35:47
more perfect nose on the bit of paper
35:49
and just hold it up he didn't say that
35:51
that would make sense i like when they
35:52
do scaffolding on buildings and they put
35:54
on the outside of the scaffolding what
35:55
the new building is going to look like
35:56
yes exactly
35:57
yeah but friend knows yeah it's very
35:59
clever my mom said when she was a kid
36:00
the queen was once visiting the area she
36:02
grew up in manchester
36:03
and their their line of terrorist houses
36:06
they decided the council
36:07
looked a bit skanky and so they put
36:09
covers on all of their houses so stop
36:10
hauling covers so that the
36:12
would think they were nicer oh wow yeah
36:14
that's amazing
36:15
yeah how weird like a potemkin village
36:18
kind of thing
36:19
yeah exactly village they might as well
36:21
have just not taken her to manchester
36:24
why don't you take it oh this is
36:27
manchester oh it looks a lot like bath
36:29
oh no so paper in china um
36:33
there's a thing in china it's a sort of
36:35
tomb sweeping day
36:36
basically it happens every year and you
36:38
take um paper money fake paper money to
36:40
burn at your ancestors great yeah i used
36:41
to go and do that yeah did you yeah yeah
36:43
yeah
36:43
and so is it stacks of i didn't have any
36:45
ancestors myself so i just had to use
36:47
other people's ancestors
36:48
yeah yeah honestly it was a thing it was
36:50
a big day there in hong kong yeah
36:52
is it like you buy monopoly money and
36:54
you burn that it's money for the dead
36:55
it's um it's a specific currency for the
36:58
afterlife and you burn it
37:00
by the grave and it's did the other
37:01
people not mind that you were doing it
37:03
for their ancestors oh i went with
37:04
friends and also it's
37:06
there's a lot of graveyards where it's
37:07
kind of unmarked
37:09
tombstones and stuff belonging to the
37:11
forgotten person yeah
37:12
was it only money that you were burning
37:14
then no but no because in
37:16
taiwan is this what you're going to say
37:18
they've now started burning
37:19
cardboard ipads for their ancestors so
37:22
that they can have them
37:23
in the in the other world that you get
37:25
helicopters and whole
37:26
uh models of houses and plastic servants
37:29
you get
37:29
you burn a plastic service so they do
37:31
that they do that largely for funerals
37:33
as well
37:33
um in in china and taiwan hong kong what
37:36
they do is
37:36
they build replicas of the things that
37:38
you had in life and and maybe give it a
37:40
bit of an extension
37:41
so that you can bring it into the after
37:43
world so i've seen it go by you see
37:45
these huge they look like giant pinata
37:47
kind of things
37:47
um and they bring it yeah to all the
37:49
cremations and so on it's
37:51
amazing really cool so cool the idea is
37:53
that you get that in the next life is it
37:55
yes
37:55
yeah so they will make exactly servants
37:57
in little little
37:59
you know cadillac cars and that's
38:00
amazing
38:03
so about the history of paper um
38:07
the fact that we have paper now a lot of
38:09
it is thanks to
38:10
buddhists um so when they first started
38:14
making paper a lot of it was used for
38:16
kind of holy books
38:18
but if you think about it um a jewish
38:20
book like the torah would be just read
38:22
over and over again the same book
38:24
if you look in an old torah it's like
38:26
really well worn it'll be well read
38:28
christian books would only be read by
38:30
monks so they don't really need that
38:32
many of those
38:33
and the quran you would just memorize so
38:35
you don't really need many of those
38:37
but in buddhism you kind of helps you to
38:39
reach enlightenment it helps you if you
38:41
just
38:41
copy things out lots and lots of times
38:44
and in order to do that
38:45
it's better to have a cheap writing
38:47
material and that's where paper
38:49
came in or one of the reasons why it
38:50
proliferated so much in the early days
38:52
very
38:52
interesting so cool and we should say
38:54
we're talking about tree based
38:56
paper because three years you've got
38:58
papyrus sorry tree or rags
39:00
yeah because you've got papyrus which is
39:01
earlier and is made of
39:03
reeds basically uh and you've got loads
39:05
of other styles
39:07
and actually yeah the tr when you say
39:08
tree or rags this definition of paper
39:11
that monroe uses isn't rags that he says
39:13
specifically that paper
39:15
needs to be plant-based and it needs to
39:17
be properly pulped so it can't even be
39:19
plant-based and sort of flattened out
39:21
paper for him is pulped plant-based so
39:24
that's what the paper in
39:26
my original fact refers to okay bizarre
39:28
thing about the invention of paper which
39:30
happened
39:30
probably in like 100 or 200 bc
39:33
is what you're doing is you're taking
39:35
bits of plant material
39:37
you're mushing it down so you release
39:39
all the cellulose which is inside it
39:41
and then you're adding water and
39:43
spreading it out and then the cellulose
39:45
mashes together and becomes paper but no
39:47
one discovered cellulose until 1838.
39:50
so how on earth do you come up with this
39:53
idea of making paper it doesn't make any
39:54
sense that's cool
39:56
because yeah that's it it's all these
39:57
very very long fibers that you get and
39:59
it's better if you
40:00
boil down your tree pulp rather than
40:03
chopping it up
40:03
yeah yeah that shortens the fibers loads
40:05
it was very popular for making kites in
40:07
china ancient china
40:08
and there was a fifth century chinese
40:11
emperor
40:12
who ordered that people should be
40:13
executed by attaching them to kites and
40:15
having them fly away
40:17
which i don't think would have worked in
40:19
reality but that's what he instructed
40:23
what a way to go quite a nice way to go
40:25
i suppose
40:26
everyone's singing let's go fly a kite
40:29
that would have been a morbid ending to
40:30
mary poppins
40:34
actually one of my favorite things about
40:35
paper has always been that
40:38
paper was invented by wasps long long
40:40
before
40:41
it was invented by humans and actually
40:43
wasps taught us how to make paper
40:46
okay are you reading my notes
40:50
you have to explain this you mean white
40:52
anglo-saxon protestants
40:54
no um paper wasps are wasps that make
40:57
their nests out of paper essentially and
40:59
they do it by chewing up wood
41:01
and pulping it like we do and then
41:02
exuding it in the same way we don't chew
41:05
up
41:05
wood to move paper oh is that not how
41:07
you've that's what my notes are
41:09
that's why they're a bit damp but it
41:10
kind of it was so it's the same process
41:12
basically it's exactly the same process
41:14
and in fact when i say they taught us
41:15
how to make paper they taught us in the
41:17
west how to make paper because we
41:18
were thousands of years behind the
41:20
chinese in this um
41:22
so this was in the 18th century a french
41:25
scientist called renee
41:26
romur in 1719 saw observe these wasps
41:30
making paper nests
41:31
and he wrote down in a book saying i
41:34
think we could use this we could make
41:36
paper like this as well this seems like
41:37
a really good thing to do but never
41:38
actually tries it and then
41:40
i think about 50 years later a guy
41:42
called jacob shaffer read his book
41:44
and thought yeah good idea i'll give it
41:46
a go and he made paper that we
41:48
definitely had paper before that though
41:49
because the mars brought it over
41:51
to um spain in the 11th century yeah
41:54
that's what i thought so i wonder if it
41:55
is exactly the same process
41:57
or if it's i think i think it might be a
41:59
different the amazing thing is
42:00
wasps do not to this day know what
42:03
cellulose is
42:04
but incredibly they retain the capacity
42:06
to make paper
42:07
do you think we're going to be the
42:08
equivalent of spicks and specs here
42:09
where a wasp is going to be listening to
42:11
our show
42:12
realize the amount of money they wrote
42:13
for this invention
42:16
so for rag-based paper cotton-based
42:20
paper
42:21
um they needed ammonia to make it and so
42:24
you would get rag men
42:25
in lots of large cities going
42:26
door-to-door saying do you have any
42:28
spare urine
42:29
yeah that was the thing and people
42:31
almost always do if you wait long enough
42:35
in fact i would say that all urine i
42:36
produce is spare
42:42
but that is true actually in all the old
42:44
paper mills it wasn't just the ammonia
42:46
of the urine
42:47
they would make the paper out of old
42:49
rags and that would come from like
42:50
soiled clothing
42:52
and so you would go to a paper mill and
42:54
it would be the smells of soiled
42:57
underwear and stuff and the smell of
42:58
urine and that's basically what it would
43:00
be wow
43:01
great news i've just shot and wet myself
43:03
i'm a paper magnate
43:10
oh what's toilet paper made out of paper
43:12
yeah i was going to say but if you've
43:13
pissed yourself
43:14
is that then going into is it like a
43:16
particular there are two kinds
43:18
of blue paper so there's there's what
43:20
they call virgin blue paper
43:22
uh which is made of tree pulp that has
43:25
never been used for anything before it's
43:26
only been
43:27
turned into blue paper does it have
43:29
richard branson's face on it
43:32
jeremy carvin sat in the toilet there's
43:34
nowhere for me to sit in here
43:40
um and the other kind is recycled blue
43:42
paper which is not recycled loose paper
43:44
it's recycled
43:45
things like office paper yeah the other
43:47
thing about these paper mills is at
43:49
night time they would close them
43:50
because they're really noisy but then
43:53
often they you know if they had a big
43:55
order they'd go on all night and
43:56
everyone would complain but they closed
43:58
them at night
43:59
and then children would crawl around the
44:00
machinery cleaning their little bits and
44:02
pieces
44:03
and then in the morning they would get
44:05
hauled out dried with rough cloths
44:08
spanked to remove numbness from their
44:10
skin giving up
44:11
giving a large glass of wine and sent to
44:13
bed
44:15
that's the life of a paper mill whoa
44:18
sounds
44:19
sort of fun yeah
44:25
[Applause]
44:25
[Music]
44:27
[Applause]
44:30
okay that's it that's all of our facts
44:32
thank you so much for listening
44:34

[Applause]
00:12
hello
00:13
and welcome to another episode of no
00:15
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:17
coming to you from up the creek in
00:19
greenwich london
00:20
my name is dan schreiber please welcome
00:22
to the stage it's andrew hunter murray
00:24
anna chazinski and james harkin
00:32
and once again we have gathered around
00:34
the microphones with our four favorite
00:35
facts from the last seven days and in no
00:37
particular order
00:39
here we go starting with you james
00:41
harkin
00:42
okay my fact this week is that this
00:44
week's presidential debate
00:46
was best watched with the sound turned
00:48
off
00:51
what do you mean by that it's just my
00:52
opinion
00:55
uh no this was a study this was a study
00:58
done um
00:58
by the professor of economics at
01:00
dartmouth
01:02
and also the university of chicago so it
01:04
was two people together
01:05
and they found that if people are
01:07
watching a debate
01:09
you can tell who's more likely to win
01:11
the election
01:12
by seeing how charismatic and how kind
01:15
of relaxed and how confident they are
01:17
but the problem happens when you turn
01:19
the sound on and you're distracted by
01:21
their policies
01:22
you can't tell anymore i could tell you
01:25
for a fact there was no chance of being
01:26
distracted by the policies being
01:27
discussed last night so i think we're
01:29
okay
01:30
that's true so obviously i'm talking
01:32
from a british perspective so i can't
01:35
vote in this
01:35
election so it doesn't make much
01:38
difference to me
01:39
who i who i think i should vote for but
01:41
it does make a difference to me who i
01:43
think will win or who i think will lose
01:45
and so if i watched 10 seconds of each
01:48
of um
01:48
candidates on silent i should be able to
01:51
tell who's going to win the election
01:53
okay
01:54
and i did this and it's bad news guys
02:00
what hillary gets in
02:06
um yeah i mean i what what can i say
02:09
apart from the fact that i watched the
02:11
first 10 seconds of each person's speech
02:13
and
02:13
hillary was kind of blinking a lot and
02:14
looking away and trump just looked
02:16
more confident yeah he's a very
02:19
confident man i don't think anyone's
02:20
ever denied that
02:23
huge revelation from you there james
02:26
even though
02:26
didn't he want a secret service code
02:28
name to be humble at one point
02:30
i think he didn't ask for that because
02:32
that's right so a confident man with a
02:33
sense of irony
02:34
did you guys see uh that the um the
02:36
kansas state police they have a twitter
02:38
account did you see that tweet that they
02:40
sent out
02:40
so they sent this tweet out just before
02:42
the debate started
02:44
which said reminder in capital letters
02:46
we realize politics can make emotions
02:48
run high
02:48
but being mad at a presidential
02:50
candidate in a debate is not
02:52
a reason to call 9-1-1
02:55
[Laughter]
02:57
and i think they've been inundated with
02:59
calls yeah
03:00
i saw some people uh warning not to play
03:02
there was a this idea of a drinking game
03:04
where every time
03:05
trump tells a lie you take a shot
03:09
cirrhosis figures have mysteriously
03:11
rocketed across america
03:13
and so there's been a lot about
03:14
fact-checking about whether journalism
03:16
has a duty to fact check and whether
03:18
because there are so many fibs being
03:19
thrown around in this election
03:21
and um i love the rating systems they
03:22
have so politifact
03:24
is a website and the rating system goes
03:26
to true
03:27
mostly true and then there's the three
03:29
bottom categories are mostly false
03:31
false and pants on fire
03:33
[Laughter]
03:39
they measured 260 uh give or take
03:42
statements from each candidate trump's
03:44
seven out of ten were in those last
03:46
three categories
03:47
uh hillary was 27 but uh but still and
03:49
the washington post uh
03:51
gives um they have fact checked 75 trump
03:55
statements and of those 75
03:57
49 received a four pinocchio rating
04:02
which is totally false um
04:06
this is the interesting thing it's
04:07
average pinocchio rating is 3.4
04:09
uh and in 2012 in that election the
04:11
highest rated
04:12
uh was michelle bachmann who got 3.08
04:16
and i think she believes in witchcraft
04:18
so that gives you
04:20
an inclination mind you that's not a lie
04:22
if she believes it i think you can only
04:23
lie if you're
04:24
if she says witches are real i don't
04:26
think she's lying if she genuinely
04:28
thinks it's
04:28
true actually and i read um there was a
04:31
kind of a
04:32
republican commentator who said
04:36
actually trump isn't lying because he
04:37
just hasn't checked it and he's just
04:39
saying it and technically that isn't
04:41
lying that's [ __ ]
04:45
my ears are burning
04:49
you are off the pinocchio scale
04:51
[Laughter]
04:54
um people are reporting now in america
04:56
trump induced anxiety as in this is a
04:59
column that michelle goldberg a slate
05:01
columnist did and she investigated spoke
05:03
to a bunch of
05:04
therapists of psychologists of
05:06
psychoanalysis and they're all reporting
05:07
cases of trump-induced anxiety so one of
05:09
them in new york said
05:11
six out of seven daily appointments will
05:13
be someone discussing how they're made
05:14
to feel anxious and uncomfortable
05:15
because of the election
05:17
um there was a victim who described a
05:19
nightmare's insomnia digestive problems
05:22
and it turned out she realized it was
05:24
triggered by when she turned on the news
05:25
and realized what was happening so she's
05:27
now determined to cut down on her news
05:29
consumption
05:30
as a way of curing it well this is
05:32
interesting because
05:34
uh trump is experiencing the opposite we
05:36
actually got sent in effect by
05:38
someone in the crowd here tom boyerson
05:40
uh and
05:41
he uh he sent in the fact that donald
05:43
trump's doctor
05:44
has done an analysis on how he is
05:45
anxious and how he's doing health yeah
05:47
so the idea is that everyone thought
05:49
that hillary was particularly sick
05:50
because she coughed that time and she
05:52
took some time off for
05:53
pneumonia and so trump decided to
05:55
release his medical records
05:57
yeah so these are a couple of quotes
05:58
from his medical record
06:00
um his blood pressure is astonishingly
06:04
excellent
06:09
what's this doctor's name mr donald rump
06:13
yeah and same thing his physical stamina
06:16
and strength are
06:18
extraordinary so on
06:20
uh debate uh preparation and things like
06:22
that so uh do you know when the first
06:25
one was televised oh no so it's nixon
06:28
against
06:29
kennedy which was 1960. was that the
06:31
famous sweaty one that was the that was
06:32
the
06:38
um no so well this is the thing so um
06:40
there's always a load of horse trading
06:42
about what you get in and there's
06:43
actually
06:44
a commission on presidential debates you
06:46
have a senior republican and a senior
06:47
democrat to try and make sure it's
06:48
completely
06:49
level um and nixon wanted no reaction
06:51
shots
06:52
he said none at all um and kennedy said
06:54
no i do want
06:55
shots of reactions and see what the
06:57
other person's doing while someone's
06:59
speaking
06:59
but there was a concession which was
07:01
that nobody neither of them was to be
07:02
shown wiping sweat from his face
07:04
oh yeah because nixon was famously
07:07
sweaty yeah
07:08
that sounds like kennedy was at home
07:10
going oh i've got such cool reaction
07:14
shots
07:19
um do you know how clinton got around
07:21
that hillary or bill
07:23
uh bill sorry yes forgot we have to
07:25
specify
07:26
i think it was clinton who got around
07:28
this because it used to be that you
07:29
weren't
07:30
allowed to show the other person in the
07:31
debate while someone was talking
07:33
so when he practiced his debates his
07:35
advisers got him to practice on a grid
07:37
layout of the stage so he could plan
07:38
exactly where he was going to stand
07:40
and they worked out what the camera
07:42
angles were going to be and in his
07:43
debates against bush senior
07:45
they made sure that where he stood
07:47
usually the camera angles would have to
07:48
catch a shot of bush senior as well
07:51
so that you could get the reaction shots
07:52
and in fact one of the downfalls of bush
07:54
senior in that him versus clinton
07:56
campaign was when during one debate he
07:58
checked his watch while clinton was
07:59
speaking and that went down really badly
08:01
because
08:02
people don't care about policy um and so
08:05
they were like oh he's bored don't have
08:07
him
08:07
[Laughter]
08:09
and so hillary has been preparing for
08:12
these debates whereas
08:13
uh donald trump hasn't at all um he's
08:15
been flying around on his jet
08:17
meeting people he's too busy with his
08:18
astonishingly excellent blood pressure
08:22
whereas hillary has been practicing and
08:24
she's been practicing with lots of
08:25
different donald trumps
08:28
for all of his different personalities
08:31
so she gets people they might be the
08:33
angry donald
08:34
the sexy dog
08:40
but because he's got no problems in that
08:42
department
08:44
let me assure you is there is there like
08:46
a list that she can grade them on to see
08:48
which one is the best
08:50
what i'm asking is is there a top trumps
08:51
kind of
08:54
[Laughter]
08:58
um so her main trump uh was a guy called
09:01
philippe raines
09:02
uh and he's one of her most trusted
09:04
advisors uh he's a bit like a
09:06
malcolm tucker kind of person he just
09:08
swears at everyone and shouts at
09:09
everyone
09:10
uh and so in that way they thought he'd
09:12
be a bit like trump
09:13
he doesn't mind picking on her faults
09:16
and all that kind of stuff
09:17
um and i kind of tried to find some
09:20
facts about him there wasn't really much
09:21
apart from that he has two cats
09:24
uh and they're called uday hussein and
09:27
kusey hussein
09:29
so he's got two cats that are named
09:31
after saddam hussein's
09:32
sons what yeah i know it's good though
09:36
it's it's such a strange fact tonight do
09:38
we know why yeah he gave him surnames as
09:40
well
09:42
well in saddam hussein news this week
09:50
uh there has been some uh there's going
09:52
to be a golden statue of saddam hussein
09:54
sent into orbit
09:56
uh and this is by an iraqi american
09:59
artist
10:00
who's doing it as kind of a way of
10:01
expressing himself i guess
10:03
did he do this that's what artists do
10:05
right
10:07
is it going to be tiny though yeah it's
10:08
going to be pretty small um there used
10:10
to be
10:11
there used to be a kind of no hang on
10:13
someone in the crowd
10:15
some of the crowd expressed audible
10:16
disappointment that we weren't going to
10:18
get a larger stature of saddam hussein
10:20
in space
10:21
you were hoping it was going to be like
10:22
the size of the iss
10:26
so you know it's going to go over and
10:28
you go you see that that's actually not
10:30
a star
10:35
[Laughter]
10:41
it'd be great if he was like recognized
10:43
so he was waving
10:50
other presidential preparation um so
10:54
george w bush he used to prepare with
10:56
rob portman who played al gore in the
10:58
year 2000
10:59
so uh portman used to argue with bush
11:03
and shouted at him and
11:04
did what he thought gore would do which
11:06
is go up really really close to george w
11:07
bush and stare him direct in the eye
11:09
and be really intimidating towards him
11:10
and apparently when he did this during
11:12
one of the enactments of the debates
11:14
george bush just put his arms around
11:15
portman and kissed him on the head
11:17
which feels like he'd missed the point
11:19
of the presidential debate with his
11:20
elections
11:22
i have a fact about al gore in al gore
11:25
news
11:26
in 2012 mitt romney was running against
11:29
barack obama to try and prevent him from
11:31
winning office again and he was really
11:33
dedicated so he started practicing a
11:35
month early
11:36
and he built accurate practice podiums
11:39
to match the debate stage ones and he
11:40
had
11:41
16 mock debates so he was super prepared
11:44
and right this is the thing i've read i
11:46
can't quite believe it's true
11:47
it's supposedly he arrived in denver
11:50
several days earlier
11:51
so that he could prepare for the
11:52
altitude of the division
12:01
um so obama had a really bad night on
12:03
the first debate he wasn't good at all
12:04
everyone said that enough oxygen
12:08
al gore half-jokingly said it was the
12:10
altitude yeah
12:12
so there we go um they've made lots of
12:14
elaborate like previous
12:15
presidents have made lots of elaborate
12:16
mock stages so ronald reagan converted
12:19
elizabeth taylor's garage into a
12:20
complete
12:21
tv studio in which he practiced his
12:24
debates
12:25
um i mean that doesn't sound true does
12:27
it no but
12:28
he was he was an actor wasn't he was a
12:30
movie actually
12:32
was he no reg sorry
12:36
no
12:42
um we need to move on to our next phase
12:43
oh wow yes yeah
12:45
abraham lincoln
12:48
just the the structure you might want to
12:50
know the first ever kind of
12:52
big political debates in america um so
12:54
this was
12:55
in 18 i think 58 so it wasn't
12:57
presidential it was for the senate and
12:59
it was him against senator stephen a
13:00
douglas
13:01
and the format was the first guy got to
13:04
speak for an hour the next guy got to
13:07
rebut
13:07
for an hour and a half and then the
13:10
first guy would close off uh with
13:12
another half an hour so they had an hour
13:13
and a half each
13:14
and we're touring with this as a podcast
13:15
format so if you guys are pro
13:18
i i read that he was such a charismatic
13:21
speaker that there's there's this one
13:22
very famous speech of his
13:24
which was so good it was so brilliantly
13:27
awesome
13:27
all the journalists there was so
13:29
captivated by what he was saying
13:31
no one wrote it down and it's called the
13:34
lost lincoln speech
13:35
no one knows what it is because they
13:36
said they said literally people were
13:38
holding their pencils and they were like
13:40
and they just listened to it and to this
13:41
day we have no idea what he said
13:43
during the speech that sounds like an
13:44
assistant flattering lincoln because he
13:46
forgot to write the speech down
13:50
okay it is time for fact number two and
13:52
that is chizinski
13:53
my fact is that a frog just vomited up a
13:56
new species of ant
14:01
that's this week right that's this week
14:03
that's just happened and it's the little
14:05
devil frog or
14:06
diablito and it's this bright orange
14:09
poisonous frog
14:10
and it just threw up this new tropical
14:12
ant species
14:13
although when i say threw up it didn't
14:16
voluntarily throw up this is a thing
14:18
that scientists do
14:19
to find new species they've got so
14:20
desperate now that's basically sticking
14:23
their fingers down animals throats in
14:24
order to get
14:26
stuff out of them so um because they
14:28
know that these frogs go hunting for
14:29
bugs
14:30
in places that are like hard to access
14:32
for them this is in ecuador this
14:33
happened
14:34
um so they hunt these bugs in places
14:35
that maybe the scientists wouldn't find
14:37
the scientists then insert a tube into
14:39
their stomach and flush all the contents
14:41
out of it
14:42
so they pour water down the tube that's
14:44
gone through the frog's mouth into its
14:46
stomach
14:46
flush the contents out gently the
14:49
article said
14:50
but they don't just like squeeze it
14:55
it's more of a massage a light massage
14:58
and this anki
15:01
dan is very musically miming a massage
15:03
on the frog
15:04
[Applause]
15:08
physical comedy in this field so what is
15:11
essentially an audio
15:12
show did you say they have a tray
15:15
uh that they put the vomit into yes and
15:17
they sort of uh like they used
15:18
a pan for gold in fact uh they sort of
15:20
find the new species in the that's great
15:22
and then i read that they let the frog
15:25
back into the wild
15:26
yeah and you said they're going to be
15:28
all right but i once drank five
15:30
pints of water in four minutes for a bet
15:33
and that frog is not going to be good
15:35
like he is going to be wandering around
15:37
dizzy not really knowing what's going on
15:40
for about 15 minutes but we did find a
15:41
new species of frog in your vomit
15:44
[Laughter]
15:46
weirdly the ant is not the only new
15:48
species that they found
15:49
in that batch of vomit there's other
15:51
insects in there that they just haven't
15:52
classified yet but there were a bunch of
15:54
new
15:55
unknown species inside yeah so
15:58
with what they do they give this if they
15:59
get a live thing in the vomit
16:01
which does sometimes happen um they do a
16:03
thing called a cafeteria test
16:05
which is where they offer the insect
16:07
they've found multiple different prey
16:09
items
16:10
and they see what it goes for um it's
16:12
not the only species that's been found
16:14
inside another species
16:15
either that's been named infants and
16:17
other species and this one i find really
16:19
cool this is a
16:20
the duns earth snake and this was found
16:23
inside another snake in 1932 in
16:24
nicaragua and no one's ever found one
16:26
since
16:27
inside another snake inside another
16:28
state so it was found inside a coral
16:29
snake
16:30
like a russian doll of uh
16:33
my favorite bit of frog news from the
16:36
last uh
16:37
year is that uh they were they were
16:39
trying to work out there's a there's a
16:40
frog called the bombay night frog
16:42
and they were trying to work out how it
16:44
mated because they'd never been observed
16:45
because it does it at night
16:46
so they they went and they managed to
16:48
track one down and they got their sort
16:50
of night vision stuff and they followed
16:52
it and
16:52
they saw it mating and it was an amazing
16:54
discovery because there were
16:55
six sex positions in the frog world no
16:58
more than
16:59
six so from style yeah
17:06
but so when they observed this uh this
17:08
frog was doing it in a seventh position
17:10
a never-before-seen position in frog so
17:14
they've
17:14
they've had to add a new position to
17:16
frog sex but it's so far
17:18
exclusive to the bombay night frog and
17:21
what it does and it's crazy
17:22
it climbs onto the head of the the other
17:26
frog
17:26
and it just starts doing the head again
17:30
for people listening at home that is
17:32
very amusingly
17:33
showing someone doing the head
17:40
so the frog is kind of rotting on the
17:43
other frogs it's just there yeah and
17:44
then
17:45
what it does is it it lets it lets loose
17:47
and then
17:49
and then it dribbles all the way down
17:52
yeah just on uh frog vomit this is a
17:55
cool thing
17:56
so scientists are currently trying to
17:59
clone a particular
18:00
frog and uh it's gone extinct right so
18:03
this
18:03
is two kinds of frog that went extinct
18:05
in the mid 80s
18:06
and they were the only known frog
18:08
species which incubated their offspring
18:10
in the mother's stomach so once the eggs
18:13
were fertilized
18:14
she ate them and they have this chemical
18:16
in them which
18:17
says stop producing hydrochloric acid
18:19
immediately
18:20
because otherwise they'll just be
18:22
dissolved in the stomach and so it turns
18:24
off uh
18:24
the production of hydrochloric acid and
18:27
when the eggs hatch the tadpoles have to
18:29
keep producing this stuff in their mucus
18:30
to say
18:31
don't digest us and then they get bigger
18:34
and bigger and eventually the mother is
18:35
entirely stomach on the inside
18:37
and eventually the pressure builds up
18:38
and she vomits out the offspring
18:40
oh she vomits out her babies
18:44
hey here's a terre one terrifying frog
18:46
actually which there's been news about
18:48
recently is the scrotum frog
18:50
which you might have talked about before
18:51
it's the titty car car water frog and
18:54
this year it's transpired that they're
18:56
critically endangered
18:57
because they are being eaten in peru or
19:00
drunk as part of a smoothie which is
19:02
supposed to be
19:02
um an aphrodisiac but they are so they
19:05
came second to the blob fish do you
19:06
remember a few years ago there was that
19:08
contest for the world's ugliest animal
19:09
blob fish one
19:10
they were second that's even worse isn't
19:13
it really than being the ugliest
19:14
being the second ugliest it is and also
19:18
i think that's so sweet so they look
19:19
exactly like scrotums
19:22
they are more attractive than scrotums i
19:24
would say
19:28
more attractive than a scrotum
19:30
[Laughter]
19:32
it's almost impossible to believe
19:36
i've actually got a picture if you want
19:37
to a picture of what
19:42
look so i think it's unbelievably sweet
19:45
it's got this flabby flabby skin but
19:47
that's because it lives in
19:48
areas without much oxygen like aquatic
19:50
environments or high altitude so it
19:51
needs lots of surface area to absorb it
19:53
but
19:54
i mean i think it's adorable the person
19:55
who's studying them says they have
19:56
permanent smiles
19:58
and dark forward-facing eyes that give
20:00
them a sweet cartoonish look
20:02
what i love about scrooge
20:07
oh we need to move out of the sec all of
20:09
my research was about ants
20:13
uh one thing about ants this was in new
20:14
scientists two weeks ago
20:16
um there are ants trapped in a nuclear
20:19
bunker
20:20
and they've um developing their own
20:22
society
20:25
what does it mean so there's like this
20:27
nuclear bunker underneath um a forest
20:29
somewhere
20:30
and there's a ventilation pipe and the
20:32
ants just keep walking
20:34
past this ventilation pipe and falling
20:35
in and they can't get out again
20:38
and so they've kind of built their own
20:39
nest and they're living as like a little
20:41
society
20:42
but it's not i thought you meant they
20:43
were just very paranoid ants
20:47
so unfortunately as far as they can see
20:49
there's no food
20:50
and so they kind of set up a nest and
20:53
these ants keep falling down into this
20:55
society
20:56
but then they all die because there's no
20:57
food and there's a carpet of ants that's
21:00
two centimeters
21:01
deep over this whole nuclear bunker so
21:04
that's what we've got to look forward to
21:05
when the nuclear apocalypse comes
21:07
as soon as trump is elected that's what
21:09
we're gonna look forward to
21:12
okay it is time for fact number three
21:14
and that is andrew hunter murray
21:16
my fact is that a group of saxon
21:18
soldiers is marching 300 miles towards
21:20
hastings
21:22
and this is happening now it's topical
21:26
it's a it's a reenactment that they
21:28
don't because what we've just had is the
21:30
950th anniversary of the battle of
21:32
stamford bridge
21:33
and that was the battle three weeks
21:35
before the battle of hastings
21:36
uh so we're about to have the 950th
21:38
anniversary of that
21:40
and uh english heritage have kind of
21:42
been involved in this they've set up
21:44
a group of soldiers and they're marching
21:46
they started in york
21:47
uh on day one and they are marching all
21:50
the way down the country
21:51
they're going to stop in hyde park in
21:52
london for a bit and when you say
21:55
soldiers so reenactors right
21:58
so unemployed people dressed as soldiers
22:04
so this is unkind
22:06
[Laughter]
22:07
it's okay i well i spoke to one of them
22:10
this afternoon actually
22:12
that's an embarrassing moment when
22:13
you're in reenactment
22:14
[Music]
22:17
time traveler
22:20
not quite from the present though still
22:21
got that knocky ringtone from 10 years
22:24
ago
22:27
[Applause]
22:28
so i spoke to a very nice man this
22:30
afternoon called phil harper who's from
22:32
english heritage and he's not one of the
22:34
he's not one of the ones guys doing the
22:35
full stint uh he just sort of helped a
22:37
bit with the setup
22:38
but they're going all the way down the
22:40
the half horse riding and the half
22:41
walking
22:42
and they're sleeping in churches and
22:43
village halls along the way and
22:45
you know tying up their horses at night
22:46
and things uh they've had to improvise a
22:49
bit with the route because
22:50
they think that the route they would
22:51
have gone when the real
22:53
saxon army was going from stanford
22:55
bridge down to hastings uh
22:56
was directly on the a1
22:58
[Laughter]
23:02
so they've compromised there but there
23:05
are bits which they know they would have
23:07
gone through so there's an old roman
23:08
arch and lincoln that these guys would
23:10
have gone through so they're going to go
23:11
through that and they're going to go on
23:12
various roman tracks and
23:14
things like that that's kind of cool do
23:15
you know the who the chairman of the
23:18
battle of stamford bridge society is
23:20
no it's chris rock
23:25
i didn't i assume it's the same one but
23:27
[Applause]
23:30
uh no so he said this week chris rock
23:32
said this week
23:33
that the reason they're doing it and
23:35
he's led this is because the battles in
23:36
yorkshire are overshadowed by the whole
23:38
battle of hastings thing
23:39
which is actually very true so we don't
23:41
i think give
23:42
king harold enough sympathy for the fact
23:45
that he'd been
23:46
under attack from the scandal from the
23:47
vikings for a long time um
23:49
england had britain had um and he
23:52
finally got up to stamford bridge and
23:54
defeated the vikings defeated
23:56
harold number two howard hardrada and
23:59
his brother at the same time didn't he
24:00
so as in
24:01
how king harold of england's own brother
24:03
was fighting him he defeated him
24:05
he defeated harold hardrada he went
24:07
thank [ __ ] for that we've actually got
24:08
our own country for once
24:09
three weeks later he went down south and
24:11
got defeated by the normans
24:13
who essentially still in charge i think
24:18
uh but yeah so three weeks of
24:19
independence england had
24:21
[Laughter]
24:22
actually um i read um a letter to the
24:25
hastings observer
24:27
from this week and it was from a man
24:29
called ethel red ronaldson
24:32
okay and he said i have just visited the
24:36
seafood and wine festival in hastings
24:39
and i must say it was an excellent event
24:41
i was however dismayed to see that the
24:43
flag
24:44
on the logo representing king harold was
24:46
a saint george flagg
24:48
this saint george flag was brought in in
24:50
the 13th century to replace the saxon
24:53
white dragon
24:54
it is therefore a symbol of norman
24:56
oppression of the saxon people
25:00
stole our land and were nasty and
25:02
unpleasant
25:03
to the english people and they're still
25:05
in charge
25:08
so i think he needs to get over it a
25:09
little bit
25:13
but they are still in charge to nominate
25:14
they are well this is the interesting
25:16
thing is that um
25:17
there's norman names today still belong
25:21
to people who tend to have more
25:22
prosperous careers
25:28
yeah so another thing they did is
25:29
brought us surnames thank you the french
25:31
so
25:31
before the normans came everyone had
25:33
weird ass names like ethel red and edric
25:35
and lothric or whatever
25:37
and then the french came over and we
25:38
loved them so much we adopted all their
25:40
names but they only really had two names
25:42
so
25:42
we all became called either william or
25:45
john and then there was all this
25:46
confusion in england because
25:48
everyone was called either william or
25:49
john and i think
25:51
by 1379 half the men in
25:54
england were called william or john so
25:57
that's why we needed surnames
25:59
because we all had the same first name
26:01
because we couldn't think of
26:02
just get more first and they used to
26:04
have amazingness so right king harold
26:06
goblinson who
26:07
the king harold who was killed at the uh
26:09
the battle of hastings uh his mistress
26:11
was called edith swan neck
26:13
now yeah it's a shame that that name has
26:15
fallen into obeyance
26:18
i think i think it's really a nice name
26:20
english heritage have just done a survey
26:21
of how
26:22
many people recognize the key
26:23
participants in the battle of hastings
26:25
at stanford bridge and so on
26:27
and more people recognized the names
26:29
stannis baratheon and daenerys targaryen
26:34
then they recognized harold hadrada
26:44
but most of them recognize duke william
26:46
of normandy and harold goblinson so
26:47
actually
26:48
it's not a terrible result i mean edgar
26:50
the athlete was a minor figure
26:52
he was the one who was pronounced king
26:53
after the battle and then he was king
26:54
for about a week and then right i think
26:56
that is asking a lot of people
26:58
i agree bloody idiot didn't recognize
27:00
the apple i reckon that was james's
27:02
newspaper writing guy writing it
27:05
typical moment of pressure
27:09
forgotten but unjustly forgotten every
27:12
school in the county should have an
27:14
anchor the athenian room
27:15
[Laughter]
27:19
the the historical reenactments of this
27:21
battle have been going on obviously for
27:23
ages um
27:24
and there was a guy i just want to tell
27:25
you about in 2006 uh there was a man
27:27
playing king harold who was roger berry
27:29
he was a sergeant in the military
27:31
provost guard service and this i just
27:33
wanted to read out this quote from him
27:34
he said he was fairly confident that the
27:37
onlookers will know
27:38
who he was he said when the archers
27:41
raise their bows
27:42
i will produce a dummy arrow which i
27:43
will place to my eye
27:45
and collapse heroically then i will
27:48
retire to the beer tent
27:50
[Applause]
27:53
you're a legend roger barry i've just
27:55
been reminded by
27:56
my fiance she when she was younger she
27:58
worked at this festival which was called
28:00
the war and peace festival
28:02
it was out in kent and she was serving
28:04
beer so she was in the
28:05
the beer tent so everyone came but
28:07
everyone was kind of really into the
28:08
idea
28:09
of the war and peace theme to and they
28:11
were they were going to reenact a battle
28:13
so they started and she was in the beer
28:15
tent on her own they started the
28:17
reenactment and
28:18
guns were going off and all this
28:19
fighting was happening and no one had
28:21
told her that there was going to be a
28:23
reenactment
28:24
so she flipped out she got onto the
28:27
ground she crawled to the
28:28
john's ambulance and she got there and
28:31
she
28:32
they're all killing each other
28:33
[Laughter]
28:36
i love the idea of the saint john's
28:38
ambulance being on hand at war
28:44
okay it is time for our final fact of
28:46
the show and that is my fact
28:47
my fact this week is that scientists
28:50
have concluded
28:51
that objects look smaller when viewed
28:53
from between the legs
29:01
i was gonna say if you're viewing an
29:03
object between your legs
29:08
as it looks smaller no no
29:12
scientists say it what
29:15
go on explain well okay so this is this
29:17
was actually published a while ago but
29:19
um
29:20
hopefully all of you saw this week was
29:22
the annual
29:23
ignoble prizes yeah ignoble prizes if
29:26
you don't know it
29:27
is an awards uh it's a scientific awards
29:29
for people
29:30
who do research that first makes you
29:32
laugh and then makes you think
29:33
and so all the little bits of research
29:36
that might get ignored because it has a
29:38
slightly odd element to it or it doesn't
29:40
have huge impacts to our
29:42
understanding of the universe this is
29:44
the award system
29:45
that uh allows for them to be recognized
29:46
and so this was one of the awards that
29:48
was given it was given to a japanese
29:50
team who had discovered this i mean
29:52
that's pretty much what it says on the
29:53
tin it's smaller when you look through
29:54
your legs yeah but what do you mean by
29:56
through your legs
29:57
oh not like x-ray like you got to look
29:59
through the hole you stand up
30:01
and you bend over yeah it's like the
30:03
eighth frog sex position isn't it yes
30:06
but you kind of you you look backwards
30:08
through your legs and you can kind of
30:10
see things behind you and they're
30:11
supposed to look a bit smaller is that
30:12
right yes
30:13
okay yeah and they've looked so in the
30:14
study um then
30:16
they investigated whether or not it was
30:18
because the image had been inverted
30:20
or because you were physically bending
30:22
over and they found out that if you were
30:24
just inverting glasses so you know you
30:26
can get those glasses which turn
30:27
everything upside down
30:28
and then you look at an object it didn't
30:29
have the same effect so it's not the
30:31
effect of the image turning upside down
30:33
it's the physical effect somehow of you
30:36
just flipping your body upside down that
30:39
causes you to see objects as smaller
30:41
and we don't know why there is a famous
30:44
i think native american tribes that
30:45
would
30:46
tell the height of a tree by walking
30:49
away from it
30:50
and then bending over until they can
30:52
just see that the top of the tree is
30:54
level with the top of the
30:56
like the the groin region and then you
30:59
would know the distance that you are
31:01
from the tree and through trigonometry
31:02
you'll be able to work out the height of
31:04
the tree
31:05
wow and that was the way that they did
31:06
really so they actually yes
31:08
so what did what did women do for the
31:10
same thing i guess it's true
31:11
yes i mean they would have to subtract
31:13
the height of the scrotum
31:16
i mean we still have legs that's so
31:19
interesting
31:20
i love when i hear stories of uh
31:23
testicles being used
31:24
for scientific purposes if you're like
31:28
out in the wild
31:28
because so that's the colony polynesian
31:31
travelers if they were on boats
31:33
and they were looking for which way they
31:34
wanted to go where the tide was going
31:36
what they would do is they would dip
31:38
their testicles into the water because
31:39
it's the most sensitive bit
31:41
of a man's body so they they dip in and
31:43
be like
31:47
that is true what they did they had
31:49
these things called metangs which they
31:50
were made
31:51
they were kind of maps that were made
31:53
out of sticks and uh rope
31:55
and they would be in the shape of the
31:57
waves
31:58
and waves change if there are islands
32:00
around so you can tell where nearby
32:03
islands are depending on which way the
32:04
waves are going
32:05
and actually waves are quite hard to
32:07
detect you need to use your most kind of
32:10
delicate part of your body and for them
32:12
it was the scrotum i mean they would
32:13
sometimes use their elbows as well and
32:15
stuff but right because you're meant to
32:16
test
32:17
how warm a baby's milk is with your
32:18
elbow
32:24
you test how hot the baby's bath is with
32:26
your elbow
32:28
oh god you have been sticking your
32:32
scrotum into that milk for no reason
32:34
whatsoever
32:35
i've got a lot of babies to apologize
32:42
worst uncle ever
32:48
um i was i was googling upside down
32:50
things and
32:51
uh i because i just thought okay look
32:53
upside down and what else is upside down
32:55
so we were talking
32:56
about new species that were discovered
32:57
last year a new monkey
32:59
was discovered and they've nicknamed it
33:01
snubby it's a sneezing monkey
33:03
and its nose is upside down and it lives
33:06
in
33:06
rainy areas and so as a result its nose
33:10
just takes in all this water and it
33:12
sneezes because it has little puddles so
33:14
it has to go
33:15
and sneeze out all the water so mostly
33:17
when people are trying to observe this
33:18
monkey and it's raining their head is
33:20
literally in their legs because
33:22
they will drown oh yeah they hide in
33:24
their arms
33:26
because their noses
33:29
yeah that's amazing i can't work out if
33:30
it would be more annoying you know when
33:31
you have a trickly nose and it goes into
33:33
your mouth if it would be more or less
33:34
annoying if it trickled into your eyes
33:37
but it would be different yeah more more
33:40
probably more
33:44
so this um this prize that this japanese
33:47
team won for
33:48
the objects was smaller through your
33:49
legs um it was also quite a big prize
33:51
because the ignoble prizes have been
33:52
going for something like 25 years is it
33:54
james
33:56
definitely and it's and this is the
33:58
first time that
33:59
a single country has managed to make it
34:02
10 years in a row of winning
34:05
so japan are an award people so a few
34:06
examples of previous uh
34:08
awards that they got they got an award
34:09
for chemistry which was
34:11
someone had invented an infidelity
34:13
detection spray that wives can spray
34:15
onto
34:15
their husbands underwear so that when
34:17
they come home they can see
34:18
if they've been unfaithful in uh
34:21
at least let me take them off first
34:25
that was a problem in the first
34:33
i've got place of this i'm going to go
34:34
get the baby as milk
34:44
there was another testicular ignoble
34:47
awarded this year what's that this was
34:48
the
34:49
cause they have different categories
34:50
depending on which papers they want to
34:51
win so they don't always have this one
34:53
but this year
34:54
the ignoble prize for reproduction uh
34:56
went to a contraceptive device
34:59
where you have to put your testicles in
35:00
a polyester sling
35:02
so this sling device it raises the
35:04
temperature of your testicles
35:06
and apparently that is measured by the
35:08
rectal testicular temperature difference
35:11
[Music]
35:12
so hang on what have you the temperature
35:13
of your rectum is raised as well then
35:15
they test with the rectal temperature
35:17
increased
35:18
i think the testicular temperature
35:20
increases which decreases the difference
35:22
between the rectal and the testicular
35:23
temperatures but i might be wrong unless
35:25
the rectal temperature increases as well
35:26
in which case the difference between
35:27
them stays the same and your experiments
35:29
void
35:30
yeah but i'm just saying i think yeah i
35:32
think there are holes in this experiment
35:36
and that's it for our show that's
35:38
[Applause]
35:43

00:37
live last week on with the show
00:44
[Music]
00:54
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:57
no such
00:58
thing as the news coming to you from up
00:59
the creek in greenwich london
01:01
my name is dan schreiber and i'm sitting
01:03
here with anna chazinski
01:04
andrew hunter murray and james harkin
01:11
once again we're here to present the
01:13
most interesting stories we found in the
01:15
news of the last seven days
01:16
and in no particular order here we go
01:19
starting with you
01:20
jacinsky my fact this week is that one
01:23
of these stalls
01:24
at the conservative party conference
01:26
this week is a grouse shooting simulator
01:31
sort of normal ordinary thing for
01:32
struggling families
01:35
so this is in the mirror in fact so a
01:37
mirror journalist went around the
01:38
conservative party conference and made a
01:40
list of the most
01:40
tory things at the tory conference and
01:43
that unsurprisingly made the list
01:45
well the um the grass simulator did you
01:47
you obviously saw what it looks like
01:49
it's like a little thing that you attach
01:51
on this kind of fake gun but you can
01:53
attach it on your own
01:54
gun if you want to if you're so inclined
01:57
uh how many people at the conservative
02:00
conference went oh actually i brought my
02:01
own gun
02:03
and actually um there's a lady called
02:05
danke bartekova
02:06
who's slovakian who used this grouse
02:09
simulator when she was training for the
02:10
london olympics and she won a medal at
02:12
the london olympics
02:14
really yeah oh cool
02:17
so it's a useful and interesting thing
02:19
and not just a chance for landowners to
02:21
show off their shooting prowess
02:23
um i have to say reading about the tory
02:26
party conference
02:27
i just thought it looked so fun
02:29
[Laughter]
02:30
i know like politically you could sit on
02:32
either side but as an event it looks so
02:34
much fun and i went on twitter and i
02:36
thought i wonder if people are tweeting
02:37
about this saying this is really fun
02:39
and they work so many people were just
02:41
because it was a hashtag
02:43
cpc16 and i put cpc16
02:46
uh fun and i just came up with all these
02:48
tweets going
02:49
if you search cpc16 crap you would have
02:52
got a lot of things
02:54
well i searched cpc16 boring and
02:57
actually uh today there was a lot of
02:59
boring stuff going on mainly about
03:00
hammond's speech i don't know if you
03:02
heard about harriman speech so there
03:03
were a few tweets i saved uh one that
03:05
said hammond's so boring
03:07
tfl wants to use him on the tunnels for
03:09
the london crossrail project
03:12
and then on the fun side because there
03:13
were lots of fun tweets this guy said
03:15
hell
03:16
it's 1 30 in the morning and i'm
03:17
listening to two men arguing about the
03:19
turnstile act of 1963.
03:21
the cpc16 is so fun it aches
03:27
i think you might be missing a note of
03:28
sarcasm
03:30
i am here to tell you having been to a
03:32
party conference or two that they are
03:34
all lying the people who want to be
03:36
promoted within the tory party are going
03:38
so it is not in their interest to go
03:39
this is a waste of time isn't it
03:41
i think they have to say i'm having the
03:43
time of my life
03:45
i don't know because there was an owl
03:47
that you could hold on your arm
03:50
yeah that's not a real owl it was a real
03:52
app unfortunately a lot of tories
03:54
brought their own guns and that album
03:56
there was a mix-up they shouldn't put
03:58
those two things next to each other
04:00
uh one person i'm not sure he was having
04:01
a great time is camden councillor johnny
04:03
bucknell
04:04
who spent the conference sleeping in his
04:06
car uh and what he thinks is
04:09
these conferences shouldn't be held in
04:10
big cities where all the hotels are
04:12
really expensive they should be held in
04:13
like blackpool where it's 10 pound a
04:15
night or something
04:16
that's what he said and so i looked at
04:19
the other things that he's
04:20
done in the last year or so and this is
04:21
all that's in the news about him
04:23
uh he was fined 30 000 pounds for being
04:25
a shoddy landlord
04:27
and he was told off for eating roast
04:29
duck during a town hall meeting
04:34
after which he he vowed to campaign for
04:36
the right to have a roast meal during
04:40
meetings
04:42
do you think you could get at the lib
04:43
dem uh conference this year there's
04:45
another bit of a seat
04:46
hey
04:54
i think you'll find james seats are the
04:55
one thing the live democracy struggle
04:56
with
04:59
[Laughter]
05:02
no they they so they also have i mean
05:04
all the party conferences have their own
05:05
merch but
05:06
the lib dem conference you could get
05:07
branded 18th birthday cards lib dem
05:10
themed in a pack of 50
05:12
[Laughter]
05:15
for someone who has 50 young nephews
05:18
on nieces don't worry donna you can sell
05:21
them to pay off your student loans
05:24
uh it was the looney conference this
05:27
week
05:28
earlier this week for the monster raven
05:29
looney party uh they held it in
05:31
blackpool
05:32
um uncle tom's cabin pub
05:36
and i went on the website and they had a
05:38
whole load of things that was going to
05:39
happen there and they said
05:41
very sorry to say that vince cornwall
05:43
and his rodent rat show
05:44
will not be appearing this year
05:48
vince has had surgery and been told to
05:50
take it easy although he is up and about
05:52
and will be attending with andrew the
05:54
rat
05:54
[Laughter]
05:59
there was an incident at the ukip party
06:01
conference which was
06:02
in september one of the failed
06:04
leadership candidates called lisa duffy
06:05
went out for dinner the conference was
06:07
in bournemouth
06:08
and the place was raided by immigration
06:10
officials who wanted to
06:12
check the visa status of the people
06:14
working in the restaurant and apparently
06:16
the chef she said ran away into the
06:18
night so she said watching our chef
06:19
running away into the night his apron
06:21
flapping in the wind
06:22
was a surreal moment turned out they
06:24
were all completely legally working in
06:26
the uk so i have no idea why he ran away
06:28
[Laughter]
06:30
could be the idea of having to serve a
06:32
whole bunch of
06:38
um the journalists and politicians have
06:40
a football match at every labor and tory
06:42
party conference which i didn't realize
06:44
so this year the lobby 11 which is the
06:47
team of journalists played the tory mps
06:50
and tori's lost 5-2 this year in 2014
06:53
they lost 7-2
06:54
that's because they're all on the right
06:55
wing
07:01
another thing that's been in the news
07:02
and is related to football this week is
07:03
the hungarian referendum
07:05
um so this is a referendum as to whether
07:08
hungary wants to allow the eu to force
07:10
that they take in only another 1 300 i
07:13
think asylum seekers
07:15
and they voted against it but the prime
07:17
minister of hungary victor orban
07:19
who brought this referendum is a former
07:21
footballer and he features
07:22
in the 2006 edition of football manager
07:26
so if anyone has that he's there he
07:28
plays for felk sutt
07:30
fc yeah he they yeah
07:33
yeah speaking of games uh and also
07:36
um simulators the top app at the moment
07:39
is a simulator
07:41
this is pewdiepie's youtuber simulator
07:44
where you get to pretend to be a
07:46
youtuber it's a great game
07:48
what so do you you wear a simulator and
07:51
you're just looking into
07:52
a camera and going oh my life's so crazy
07:55
i just
07:56
amazingly it's even more boring than
07:58
that
08:00
you're a character on your phone and
08:01
you're in your bedroom with a computer
08:03
and you have to make um videos you don't
08:06
get to really make videos you just get
08:08
to pretend to make videos
08:10
and then they get views and you get
08:11
money for that and you can buy more
08:12
things to decorate your bedroom with
08:16
your fake bedroom your fake bedroom yeah
08:18
i played it this morning which is why
08:21
my research is a bit kind of short this
08:24
week
08:24
um no i made a video it got 13 views and
08:27
three subscribers
08:28
uh and it got me enough money to buy a
08:30
cardboard box
08:32
to put it in my bedroom uh and then i
08:34
had to wait for it to get delivered
08:36
and it said that it would take 30
08:38
seconds and my app crashed and it took
08:39
me three minutes
08:41
and then i just got bored and i stopped
08:42
playing
08:44
uh and this app is made by the same
08:46
people who made goat simulator
08:50
a game in which players can drag things
08:53
wiggle
08:54
things throw things and lick things
08:57
i think it needs to be specifying what
08:59
thing
09:01
there's a there's a new uh virtual
09:03
reality simulator out as well as so you
09:04
put it on your head and
09:06
um what it is the game is you're a
09:08
lonely cow
09:09
in a field yeah genuinely
09:12
and there's no other cows and people
09:14
come and they taser you
09:16
and and force you into a truck
09:19
and it's meant to raise awareness about
09:21
how cows are being treated
09:22
in the world today um it doesn't sound
09:24
that fun does it now i say it out loud
09:26
but the pictures look amazing because
09:28
you're on all fours and you're just
09:29
walking around your living room
09:30
um occasionally going wow when you're
09:33
tasered
09:35
and there's another one where you can um
09:36
you can be a piece of coral
09:38
uh it's another virtual reality
09:41
simulator and you sit and you're a piece
09:43
of coral and you watch
09:44
uh the reef uh decay from acids that are
09:47
let into the water
09:49
the one thing i know about coral is they
09:51
get most of their nutrients from urine
09:53
they get it from fish urine so parents
09:56
don't buy this game for your children
09:59
uh we need to move on in a sec to our
10:00
next fact anything before we do just
10:02
back to politics once yeah um
10:04
so there's been uh it's been an election
10:06
in brazil uh for the mayor of uh
10:08
sao paulo and the man who has won
10:11
is the host of the brazilian version of
10:13
the apprentice
10:15
oh yeah i know what are the chances
10:18
it'll happen twice
10:19
[Laughter]
10:22
okay it is time for fact number two and
10:25
that
10:25
is andy my fact is that comets sound
10:28
like a cross between a cat and a dolphin
10:33
you mean the noise that they make i mean
10:34
the noise they make so this week uh
10:36
the comet 67p churyum of gerasimenko
10:40
uh the the rosetta uh satellite
10:43
has the probe we call it probe probe
10:46
probe it's weird when people shout probe
10:50
at you
10:50
[Laughter]
10:54
i'm used to it okay um so
10:57
they they they've gathered so much data
10:59
from this comet that they never had
11:00
before and one of the things they found
11:02
is it gives us this
11:03
low frequency hum and they're not
11:04
exactly clear why it might be because it
11:06
has charged particles in the
11:08
in the in the gas and the dust jets that
11:09
it gives out and i think uh we can play
11:11
it this is a sped up
11:13
version of it because it's normally
11:14
below the range
11:19
that's kind of dolphinity dolphin yeah
11:23
imagine it but more like a cat
11:26
imagine pressing it together it sounds
11:28
like a cat purring a bit anyway that's
11:30
that's the noise it makes
11:31
i think it does sound like a cat pairing
11:32
yeah more than a dolphin in fact
11:34
but that is very sped up isn't it so
11:36
actually it's like one of those noises
11:37
every
11:38
20 minutes or something that clicks very
11:41
infrequently and
11:42
have we had to manufacture that sound
11:44
because it doesn't quite
11:45
we can't send sound back so they're
11:46
picking up signals of what the sound
11:48
should be generating and
11:49
we're recre that's a recreation that's
11:51
someone in a that's like in tv when you
11:53
have to make boot sounds on the ground
12:04
yeah it's not quite that they've copied
12:06
and pasted the vibrations that are being
12:08
emitted by the comet
12:09
and into radio waves so that we can hear
12:11
them they haven't just hired a cat
12:15
actually doesn't it smell like cat pee
12:18
yeah
12:19
and it looks like a duck so you're
12:21
wondering if this is a commentator
12:24
if it looks like a duck sounds like a
12:26
dolphin and a cat and smells like cat
12:28
urine
12:29
it's comet 67p
12:30
[Laughter]
12:33
do you know we don't know if it changed
12:34
its tune though um so
12:37
so halley's comment has been studied
12:39
before and it makes a completely
12:40
different thing is a completely
12:41
different song
12:42
when it gets closer to the sun and so
12:44
we're still waiting on the data to come
12:45
back as to whether the tune
12:47
now sounds more like a duck or a giraffe
12:49
or whatever
12:50
weird animal you want to compare it to
12:52
hey speaking of halley's comet do you
12:54
know when the next time we're going to
12:55
see halley's comet is
12:56
oh well the last one was when probably
12:58
when i was a teenager so it'll be
13:00
another
13:01
probably 45 point six years something
13:04
like that
13:05
october 20th oh yeah
13:14
and i'm older than i think names i've
13:17
just got the word hubris in my notes
13:21
you could send me 50 birthday cards i
13:24
hope you like tim ferran
13:29
no what this is is that halley's comet
13:31
when it flies by
13:32
it obviously leaves a trail behind it
13:34
and so on october 20th we're going to
13:36
come
13:37
into the path of the debris trail that
13:39
it left behind when we saw it
13:40
and so if you're in the north of wales
13:42
october 20th and it lasts for quite a
13:44
long time because it's a long trail
13:46
you'll see meteor showers coming in and
13:48
you'll be able to watch the debris of
13:49
halley's comet
13:50
coming in and it happens every year that
13:53
is great
13:54
i don't know if it counts as seeing a
13:55
comment if you're seeing what it's
13:56
excreted as it is
13:58
walking into a room two years after
14:00
someone fasted it
14:03
[Laughter]
14:06
so this this thing so with the just back
14:08
to the comet quickly um
14:10
they've discovered a lot of stuff so for
14:12
example they discovered a new kind of
14:14
carbon
14:15
which was really complicated not like
14:16
the kind of carbon that we're
14:18
made of and uh there was an interview
14:20
with a team member of rosetta
14:21
called every cotton he said it is so
14:24
complex we can't give it a proper
14:26
formula
14:27
or a name
14:30
it's so complex
14:36
do they keep trying
14:43
and have we said why this is in the news
14:46
this week
14:46
rosetta um which is the probe which went
14:49
around
14:49
the comet uh it's crashed into the comet
14:52
and it's the end of its life isn't it
14:54
it's not actually the end of its life
14:55
it's just cut off its phone conversation
14:57
with us yeah
14:58
it's kind of hubristic of us to assume
15:00
that it's now dead well
15:01
that's true but one you see because it's
15:03
like solar powered isn't it so
15:05
they were thinking well maybe we could
15:07
just kind of land it softly and then
15:09
next time it goes near the sun it can
15:11
power up again
15:12
but they weren't sure if that was going
15:13
to work and then so one of the
15:15
um scientists at the esa matt taylor
15:17
said they'd rather go out in true rock
15:19
and roll
15:20
style and crash into the comet
15:23
it's weird that he said that because
15:25
they crashed into the comet at two miles
15:27
an hour
15:29
that's walking pace that is strolled
15:32
into a comet
15:34
the most interesting thing for me about
15:36
the whole thing is that
15:38
we did find out amazing information
15:40
about uh the makeup of comets and so on
15:42
and uh they think that there might be
15:44
bits of it that suggest
15:45
how life may have arrived on earth um
15:48
but for me what's really interesting is
15:50
on the actual probe rosetta they
15:52
included a thing called the rosetta disc
15:55
i don't know if you remember voyager
15:56
years and years ago had a golden disc on
15:59
it that had
16:00
songs from earth exactly
16:04
so they've created a 7.5 centimeter
16:07
nickel disc that has a thousand
16:09
languages on it
16:10
it's basically its nickel and you can
16:12
use a microscope
16:14
to head in towards and you can read a
16:16
thousand languages
16:17
um so for a second time we've seeded the
16:20
idea of language that may die very soon
16:22
into the universe which is quite cool it
16:24
will just sit there all the aliens that
16:25
have just finished building a record
16:26
player
16:28
oh great finally we can always i mean
16:31
what's this format
16:34
rosetta took 116 000 photos on the
16:37
mission
16:38
and it sent back 218 gigabytes of data
16:41
um 218 of them
16:44
like it's taken
16:49
it sounds like 218 gigabytes of data and
16:51
i worked out um
16:52
that what that would be is 872
16:55
copies of the film deep impact
17:00
that's the only version i could find of
17:02
the film deep impact online was dubbed
17:03
into tamil so it might be slightly
17:06
more or fewer speaking of a deep impact
17:09
um i was surprised that no one has got
17:11
angry about the fact
17:12
so far that rosetta has gone into
17:16
the actual comet because in 2005
17:19
nasa crashed their probe deep impact
17:22
into a comet called
17:23
tempel one and an astrologer tried to
17:25
sue nasa
17:26
saying that they had upset the balance
17:28
of the universe
17:30
and all of these horoscopes are bollocks
17:32
now aren't they
17:36
[Applause]
17:38
okay so we're halfway through the show
17:40
and it's time to look at the stories
17:42
that you've sent in to us via emails and
17:44
social media starting
17:46
with james okay this one comes from
17:49
david smith um it's at dvd smith on
17:52
twitter
17:53
and it comes from the independent a
17:55
russian children's charity
17:57
has had a million flyers printed asking
17:59
people to exterminate
18:01
beavers that's due to a misprint
18:04
it should have read do good
18:10
uh anna this is a tweet from at i of
18:13
siva and it comes from the florida sun
18:15
post and it's the story that a
18:17
68 year old man who married a 24 year
18:20
old woman only to discover when looking
18:21
through family photos that she's his
18:23
estranged biological granddaughter
18:26
said they have no plans to divorce he
18:28
said i've already had two failed
18:30
marriages and i'm determined not to have
18:31
a third
18:34
uh and finally andy my fact this has
18:37
been sent in from kenzie lee
18:39
an employee of the canadian mint is
18:41
currently on trial accused of smuggling
18:42
a hundred thousand pounds worth of gold
18:44
out of the building
18:46
in his rectum he kept on setting off the
18:49
metal detector when he was leaving
18:51
and and they kept on doing a sort of pat
18:54
down search for him no nothing there
18:55
okay well and then they found some gold
18:57
pucks and a tub of vaseline in his
18:59
locker
19:00
and he maintains that this is completely
19:02
circumstantial evidence as well
19:05
anyway he is at the moment innocent
19:06
until proven guilty
19:08
until proven really weird
19:12
okay it is time for fact number three
19:14
and that is
19:16
james okay my fact this week is that
19:18
nobel prize winners
19:19
always immediately return their award so
19:22
they don't lose it
19:23
in the subsequent party
19:28
this it makes it sound like as soon as
19:30
they get the award it kicks off
19:33
so i think the key to the fun that they
19:35
have because they definitely do have fun
19:36
is that they made sure that every year
19:39
um 200 of the 1300 seats there are
19:42
allocated to students
19:43
from the uni yes so that's what it is
19:46
and a lot of the parties are led by
19:47
students so the best part of the nobel
19:49
prize ceremony apparently
19:51
um is the after party and it's called
19:52
nobel nightcap do you know what they
19:54
make the nobel laureates do
19:57
shots they they induct them into the
20:00
order of the ever smiling and jumping
20:03
green frog
20:05
and everyone like richard feynman was a
20:07
part of it richard feynman was really
20:09
excited because as well as playing the
20:10
bongos he's a he's an amazing physicist
20:13
most people just know him as a bongo
20:15
player
20:17
he was involved in science as well and
20:19
yeah and they gave him one of these
20:20
awards and he was really excited because
20:22
he does an
20:22
awesome frog impression so he was like
20:24
oh finally you can bust this out in it
20:26
and it's not weird and so what they do
20:28
is they get they get people who've won
20:29
the prizes
20:30
uh usually in physics um to be they have
20:33
to leap like
20:34
a frog and they also have a massive
20:35
paper mache frog that they have to carry
20:37
all the way back to the origin place of
20:39
the frog so people who've just won
20:41
the biggest award in science can be seen
20:44
at 2 a.m
20:44
with a huge paper mache frog or a real
20:48
one so it changes every year the
20:50
formalities and sometimes it's a person
20:51
dressed up as a frog right um
20:53
they mix it up all the time of course
20:55
you say physics and it is the nobel
20:57
prizes this week isn't it yeah
20:58
and the physics prize has just been won
21:00
by three british people yeah which is
21:02
great
21:04
so there is a lot of partying and it is
21:05
very fun but there also is
21:07
the actual ceremony bit which is very
21:09
serious and so all nobel
21:11
laureates get a course in how to receive
21:15
the actual prize from the king so there
21:17
was actually a british
21:19
nobel prize winner called paul nurse and
21:21
they used his video as an example of how
21:23
not to accept it
21:25
he got his medal turned around and held
21:26
it up like he'd won the world cup in
21:28
football classic brit
21:30
and um they edited that out from his
21:33
winning video
21:34
and they apparently show that in a uh in
21:37
the demonstration of how to receive it
21:39
by how not to risk he could have done
21:40
worse he could have been like knuts
21:42
handsome who won the
21:43
1920 literature prize you don't need to
21:45
tell us
21:46
[Laughter]
21:49
um he got drunk and he pulled the
21:50
whiskers of an elderly nobel committee
21:53
man
21:54
and then he snapped his finger against
21:56
the corset of his fellow
21:58
laureate secret unset and shouted it
22:01
sounds like a bell boy
22:05
it was a different time um so they give
22:08
you they give you
22:08
the actual gold uh medal when you win
22:10
and for some reason the economics one is
22:12
very slightly larger than all the other
22:14
fighters
22:14
it is 10 grams bigger than the white no
22:16
explanation
22:18
but uh so there was a guy called brian
22:20
schmidt who won the 2011
22:21
prize for physics for discovering dark
22:24
energy basically
22:25
and he went to visit his granny and she
22:26
lives in fargo uh made famous obviously
22:28
by
22:29
the film and the tv series and then on
22:31
his way out at the airport uh it was in
22:32
his
22:33
laptop bag and uh it came up on the
22:36
screen as this completely black disc
22:37
because it's made of gold
22:38
and the airport guys were a bit freaked
22:40
out and he reported the conversation
22:42
they had he said
22:44
they're like sir there's something in
22:45
your bag he said yes i think it's this
22:46
box
22:47
they said what's in the box he said a
22:49
large gold medal
22:52
so they opened it and they said what's
22:53
it made out of and he says
22:55
gold and then they said
22:59
who gave this to you and then he says
23:02
the king of sweden
23:06
they say why did he give this to you
23:09
he says because i helped discover the
23:11
expansion rate of the universe is
23:12
accelerating
23:16
at which point they were beginning to
23:17
lose their sense of humor
23:21
and he tells them it's a nobel prize and
23:23
he says and their main question was
23:24
why were you in fargo
23:29
he could have saved a lot of problems if
23:30
he smuggled it in his rectum
23:32
[Laughter]
23:35
it's big though at least it's not the
23:38
economics one
23:38
[Laughter]
23:42
as well as the medal you obviously get
23:44
the massive uh cash prize
23:46
uh that goes away is it like a million
23:48
dollars well it fluctuates i've read
23:50
this article where they talked about how
23:51
people
23:52
who've won the nobel prize how
23:53
scientists have spent the money
23:55
that they've won one interesting one was
23:57
albert einstein who gave his money over
23:59
to his first wife
24:00
he gave it in 1921 that's when he won it
24:03
but actually he signed it over to her
24:04
when they were in divorcing in 1919.
24:07
so he said if i ever win the nobel prize
24:09
you can have the money
24:11
in the divorce and then he won it and
24:14
she got the money which is amazing
24:16
um you know they have the banquet yeah
24:18
for the 1300 guest banquet it's
24:20
incredible and sometimes there's major
24:21
ghosts
24:24
so i was trying to look for a scandal at
24:25
the banquet and um
24:28
get this guys this is according to the
24:30
svenska
24:31
dagbladet newspaper last year the
24:34
biggest scandal
24:35
was a minor faux pas which meant the
24:36
king was last at his table to be served
24:38
the source for the main course
24:42
it's amazing when you get that inside
24:44
scoop
24:48
[Laughter]
24:55
you're right it goes alongside it so
24:57
there's this blog written by a former
24:59
planning secretary for the banquet
25:01
talking about the issues she'd come up
25:02
against and one of the things is a
25:04
seating plan which is very difficult
25:05
with 1300 people
25:07
so obviously a lot of colleagues attend
25:08
together because they're on the set in
25:09
the same
25:10
science research group and she said
25:11
eating plans do sometimes request that
25:14
they be seated as far from their
25:15
colleagues as possible
25:17
people have said there was one a few
25:19
years ago where
25:20
an american uh attendee and a swedish
25:23
attendee who didn't know each other were
25:25
sat next to each other and they're still
25:26
married today
25:27
so that's nice so nice and there was one
25:31
where
25:31
one of the nobel laureates invited his
25:33
ex-wife and his wife
25:35
and apparently the nobel committee
25:38
received strict
25:38
instructions to seek the ladies as far
25:40
apart as possible without
25:42
any possibility of eye contact
25:46
it was the peace prize
25:50
okay it is time for our final fact of
25:52
the show and that is
25:54
my fact my fact this week is that two
25:57
recently recovered stolen van gogh
25:59
paintings
26:00
would buy you enough cocaine that you
26:02
could snort
26:03
a continuous line from here to moscow
26:09
[Applause]
26:12
and you'd still have a bit left over for
26:13
when you get there
26:15
uh so the reason that we know this is
26:17
that two you might have seen in the news
26:18
this week two very
26:20
uh famously stolen van gogh paintings
26:23
which were taken back in 2002 from the
26:25
van gogh museum in amsterdam were
26:27
recovered
26:27
and they were found in italy near naples
26:30
in the property
26:31
of a famous cocaine mafia
26:34
cartel and the idea is that they were
26:36
using these paintings as currency
26:38
so we found out how much one van gogh
26:41
would be worth we doubled it and then we
26:43
worked out how much cocaine that would
26:44
be equivalent to
26:46
it's a shame that you have to make the
26:47
swap because once you've given away the
26:48
paintings you've got nothing to snort
26:49
the cocaine off
26:53
because that's the most rock and roll
26:55
moment of your life
26:55
[Laughter]
26:57
when these two uh paintings disappeared
27:00
they
27:01
actually found the people that they
27:02
thought may have stolen it
27:04
and there was a guy sent there were two
27:06
people sent to prison weren't there yes
27:07
the main one was called octave durham
27:10
and he was known to the police as the
27:11
monkey
27:12
uh because he was so good at evading the
27:14
rest
27:16
as monkeys are i've ever tried to slap
27:19
the cuffs on the monkey
27:20
little paws uh i checked and actually
27:23
only two monkeys have been arrested one
27:34
was
27:34
for harassing locals in mumbai uh and
27:38
the other was after a high-speed chase
27:39
in washington state
27:42
he was he was sitting on the back of the
27:44
guy who was driving so it hardly seems
27:46
fair and they did let it go
27:47
quite quickly afterwards but still an
27:50
arrest so they never recovered the
27:51
paintings from them but they
27:53
they assumed it was them because at the
27:54
site they found their dna
27:56
on the ropes on the ladders and on both
27:59
hats that they left behind
28:02
like like a monkey wears a hat
28:07
but banana peels everywhere so
28:10
um one of the things is that they so
28:12
they got four years jail sentence
28:14
and they were denying it obviously that
28:16
they'd stolen it and they thought maybe
28:18
the reason they hadn't admitted to it
28:19
and
28:20
probably played against them in the
28:21
trial is the fact that dutch law states
28:24
that if there is a stolen bit of art and
28:26
it's missing for 30 years whoever is in
28:28
possession of it owns it so they
28:30
thought that they were going to wait 30
28:31
years and then go
28:33
oh look what we found and then and
28:36
legally that's fine
28:36
incredible isn't it that that might be
28:38
true yeah no but they they own it but
28:39
would they still go to prison for
28:40
committing the crime
28:42
yeah probably well they did the time i
28:43
guess they did the four years for the
28:45
for the theft apparently all these old
28:47
laws date from the time when
28:49
um like amsterdam and rotterdam were
28:51
massive ports where people could steal
28:53
things and then just disappear
28:54
and so they have a load of kind of
28:56
slightly weird arcane laws that still
28:58
are on the statute books we have a law
28:59
about that we have a finder's keeper's
29:01
law where if you find something handed
29:02
into the police
29:03
and then a few weeks later um it's been
29:05
unclaimed you get it
29:07
is there a loser's weeper's law
29:14
um there has been another development in
29:16
our theft news
29:17
um so the fbi has a top 10 art crimes
29:20
list which i didn't know
29:21
um and one of them is a theft in 1990
29:24
from the isabella stewart gardner museum
29:25
in boston
29:27
and this year the fbi dug up the garden
29:29
of a mafia
29:30
boss called roberto gentile to try to
29:32
find it it didn't find any of the
29:33
paintings that we're missing and
29:35
this is the evidence they've got against
29:36
him he did a polygraph test which
29:38
assessed the likelihood he was telling
29:39
the truth about not being involved at
29:41
less than 0.1
29:44
he was found to have a handwritten list
29:46
of the stolen artworks and their values
29:49
um and he was recorded telling an fbi
29:52
agent he had
29:53
two of the stolen paintings well this is
29:56
the biggest ever art theft in the u.s
29:58
and um the way they did it is so um
30:01
movie star style they dressed up as
30:04
policemen these two guys
30:05
and they turned up and said to the
30:06
security guards hey we got a call about
30:09
disturbance in this
30:10
art gallery full of priceless things can
30:12
we get in and so the security guards let
30:14
them in
30:15
and then as soon as they've been let in
30:16
they said in your face this is a robbery
30:19
i think they in fact i think they were
30:20
quite polite about it they did the
30:21
classic thing they said
30:22
gentlemen this is a robbery and then
30:24
tied them up and
30:26
stole the stuff kim kardashian got
30:28
robbed and she yeah
30:29
and they reckon that might have been the
30:30
pink panther gang uh who apparently have
30:33
lots of these kind of tricks like
30:35
sometimes they get away on bikes dressed
30:37
as women and sometimes they get away
30:39
in speed boats and one time so they
30:41
didn't get spotted they put
30:43
wet paint signs on all the benches
30:45
nearby so no one would sit on them
30:47
and always with the theme tune um
30:53
um there's i read an interesting story
30:55
about art heists
30:56
so there was a story about a guy who he
30:59
was called radu dogara
31:00
and he stole 26.38 million dollars worth
31:04
of art
31:05
and so he was caught and he was going to
31:06
trial and he said that he was willing to
31:08
divulge where
31:09
all of the art was the only condition
31:11
was that he got a dutch trial instead of
31:14
a romanian trial
31:15
because it turns out that the laws are
31:17
different in every different country for
31:19
how severe
31:20
a sentence you get for stealing art and
31:22
the dutch laws are
31:23
way less severe than they are in romania
31:25
where they're extremely severe so it's a
31:27
difference between four years in jail or
31:28
20 years in jail so i looked for the
31:30
best place to steal art from
31:35
and it turns out it's on norwegian
31:38
cruises
31:39
okay yeah so a guy a kentucky native
31:43
uh called kevin hudgins he recently
31:45
stole it was a copy of a rembrandt still
31:46
worth about 13 000
31:48
american dollars and he stole it but he
31:50
happened to steal it
31:51
while the cruiser he was on docked in
31:53
bermuda and in bermuda they just don't
31:56
care they're like that's fine
31:57
and his trial because wherever the
31:59
wherever the boat docks
32:01
that's where you are the law of and so
32:03
he got fined 500
32:04
for stealing it as opposed to 20 years
32:07
in jail had he docked in romania
32:09
for example so if you're on a cruise and
32:11
there's a good bit of art
32:13
check out where you're docking check out
32:14
the launch of romania yeah
32:16
exactly but if you're heading to bermuda
32:18
have a look at the walls on the ship
32:20
and i mean romania is
32:23
it's not completely landmarked but
32:24
there's not that many cruises go there i
32:26
don't think
32:28
has anyone else been researching cocaine
32:29
news just quickly on that
32:31
so this is a story from last week in
32:33
seattle um the police got handed a
32:35
suitcase which had been lost and they
32:36
said well let's look inside and see if
32:38
we can
32:39
find any you know clues to whoever might
32:40
have owned it they opened it up they
32:42
found 31 bags of cocaine
32:45
uh a scale for all the cocaine uh some
32:48
marijuana in case you got bored of
32:49
cocaine
32:55
and a 19 year old man's id card and
32:58
mobile phone
32:59
[Laughter]
33:02
a little while after this had been
33:03
handed in a 19 year old man
33:05
approached police saying he had lost his
33:08
briefcase
33:09
and he needed it back as it contained
33:11
some extremely important paperwork
33:14
oh man he was arrested because of
33:17
all the cocaine yeah i found one bit of
33:21
cocaine news um it's a study uh a new
33:24
study
33:24
um scientists have found that cocaine
33:26
makes fish feel drowsy
33:29
yeah they gave some cocaine to some
33:31
zebrafish and also they can take a
33:33
hundred times more cocaine than mice can
33:36
and a thousand times more cocaine than
33:38
humans can wow
33:40
well but they're just blinking very very
33:41
very hard they're slow
33:44
i guess it's slow yeah it slows them
33:45
down oh yeah of course
33:47
bizarre there was another study on
33:49
cocaine uh in the last week actually
33:52
so it turns out that we're turning into
33:55
cocaine news welcome to cocaine news
33:58
you want news we got news
34:03
the reason andy's so anxious is that
34:05
it's most likely his cocaine is cut with
34:07
a flesh-eating substance
34:09
so 65 of cocaine in this country is now
34:12
cut with this thing called
34:13
lavamisol which literally rots human
34:16
flesh
34:17
and so yeah i know nice it's used by
34:19
farmers to purge their livestock of
34:20
parasitic worms usually
34:22
but it also serves this extra purpose
34:25
and it keeps the weight off okay that's
34:34
it that's all of our facts
34:36
just time to share with you the four
34:37
stories that we didn't have time to get
34:39
through during the show
34:40
and we're gonna start with mine my fact
34:43
is that north korea has banned sarcasm
34:45
because kim jong-un is worried that
34:48
people are only agreeing with him
34:50
ironically
34:53
uh james okay mine is that the police in
34:57
utah have officially recommended against
34:59
shooting random clowns
35:05
okay andy uh this is from the
35:08
the times of india a building in
35:10
massachusetts had to be evacuated after
35:12
residents complained about a peculiar
35:14
smell
35:14
which turned out to be caused by a man
35:16
cooking urine in his flat
35:21
and finally anna yep this is from the
35:24
national post of
35:25
canada and this is that after the
35:27
official opening of a ring road in
35:29
edmonton canada on saturday
35:31
motorists were surprised by a large
35:32
electronic sign announcing
35:35
we done
35:41
that's all from me andy james and anna
35:44
we'll be back again next week we've been
35:45
no such thing as the news good night
36:01
i

=135
00:00
[Music]
00:10
[Applause]
00:14
hello
00:14
and welcome to another episode of no
00:16
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:19
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:20
covent garden my name is dan schreiber
00:23
i'm sitting here with alex bell
00:25
andy murray and anna chazinski and once
00:27
again we have gathered around the
00:28
microphones with our four
00:30
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:32
and in no particular order
00:33
here we go starting with you andy my
00:37
fact is that scientists have developed
00:38
barcodes
00:39
for zebras
00:42
no uh they've also developed a separate
00:45
and identical system for zebras
00:49
we'll get on to how to say the name of
00:50
the thing in a bit
00:52
but um this is a team of scientists at
00:54
princeton and uh
00:55
what they've done is this is a
00:56
particular species of zebra called the
00:58
grevy's
00:59
zebra and it's the rarest of the species
01:02
of zebra
01:03
and they've persuaded volunteers to take
01:05
40 000 photos of
01:06
different animals and the scientists
01:09
have then used this software on them
01:11
because they've all got completely
01:12
unique
01:13
stripe patterns and it combines barcode
01:15
technology and facial recognition
01:17
software
01:18
and so you can now identify an
01:19
individual animal from it leaving skyra
01:22
who's been on
01:22
uh as a guest he has a show in belgium
01:25
and
01:26
one of the games because when you go to
01:27
a supermarket in belgium they give you a
01:29
scanning
01:29
gun to take around now so you can just
01:31
scan as you go along the items
01:33
and then you hand the scan gun in at the
01:35
end and then they tally up what you have
01:37
to hand in your badge as well
01:40
so he uh he convinced the supermarket in
01:42
allowing him to
01:44
have him and his friends have barcodes
01:46
printed up on t-shirts
01:48
and they ran around the supermarket like
01:49
laser quest and we're trying to scan
01:52
each other's shirts and they had to
01:54
collect all the kills as it were
01:55
yeah a very cool game at the end they're
01:57
like well i got three zebras
02:00
it's it's really i had no idea this is
02:02
how it works but each gap and space
02:04
combo is a number and so each digit is a
02:07
combination of seven
02:08
uh black and white bars so to say one in
02:10
a barcode
02:11
it's white white black black white white
02:13
black you put those all together
02:15
so it's slightly thicker white and black
02:17
bits and that is it's kind of like morse
02:19
code did you read
02:20
about the guy who invented it how he
02:21
came up with it well it was several
02:22
people who kind of developed it but one
02:23
of the people
02:24
uh in charge of um kind of developing
02:26
the idea was a guy called norman joseph
02:28
woodland
02:28
and he was thinking about it when he was
02:30
at the beach and he uh drew a sort of
02:32
morse code pattern in the sand sort of
02:34
by doing dots and dashes uh
02:35
poking them in the sand and then pulled
02:37
down those dots and dashes into bars and
02:40
came up with a barcode
02:42
but then the developers turned it into
02:44
the shape of a bull's-eye so the first
02:45
barcodes were actually bull's-eyes oh
02:47
yeah they took up loads of space didn't
02:49
it
02:50
so it's actually much more efficient to
02:52
just go with the long line yeah
02:54
um you know that guy joe woodland who
02:55
you just mentioned yeah he's one of the
02:56
pioneers
02:57
supposedly he came up with the idea
02:59
indirectly because of the atlantic city
03:01
mafia
03:03
go on okay so he he got the idea when he
03:06
was at uh drexel university in
03:07
philadelphia
03:08
and he was doing a master's degree there
03:10
and he hadn't originally wanted to do a
03:12
masters he wanted
03:13
to start a business where he made a
03:15
music system for lifts
03:17
but and he wanted to set up this whole
03:19
phone and his father said
03:20
no the mob control the music it lifts
03:24
you in atlantic city or on the east
03:26
coast of the usa you're not allowed to
03:28
go into that because they'll they'll get
03:29
you
03:29
so instead he went off and did a masters
03:31
and came up with a barcode instead i had
03:33
a weird industry to decide to control if
03:35
you're the mafia
03:36
they had a whole race it wasn't just
03:38
lift music that they controlled
03:39
that feels like it was really like the
03:41
mobster's baby brother
03:42
yeah they needed to give him something
03:44
yeah
03:46
have you seen that in venezuelan
03:47
supermarket since last year
03:49
you've had to scan in your fingerprints
03:52
to get wow because so you know venezuela
03:56
is going through a very horrible time at
03:57
the moment and there's a lot of food
03:58
shortages
03:59
and so the government's had to ration
04:00
stuff and people have been panicked
04:02
buying things
04:02
like they'll just buy in loads of grain
04:04
or loads of cigarettes or whatever it is
04:06
that they think the country is going to
04:06
run out of
04:08
and so in order to stop them doing that
04:09
supermarkets have installed fingerprint
04:11
scanners and when you buy something
04:12
you have to give provide id you have to
04:14
give your name your address your date of
04:16
birth and you have to scan in your
04:18
fingerprint so they can make sure that
04:19
you haven't been over buying
04:20
whoa if you just want a loaf of bread um
04:23
i was looking into other animals with
04:25
codes on
04:25
so in 2010 farmers in some of the
04:29
painted qr codes onto their cows
04:31
um so to try and raise awareness of
04:33
their website uh this is dairy
04:34
farming.com
04:35
well uh it's worked oh my god best
04:38
website ever i spent all afternoon on it
04:40
it's really good
04:40
there's videos of uh new dairy farm
04:43
technology there's a there's a farmer's
04:45
dairy diary which i quite like did you
04:47
read it yeah i did yeah the cow of the
04:48
month as well a little profile on the
04:50
cow of the mountain okay
04:51
and there's also like what it's like to
04:52
live as a cow and like you can follow
04:54
the journey of milk it's a really good
04:55
site genuinely recommended so the cows
04:57
are writing the diary no the cows make
04:58
the videos they put they put they put um
05:00
they
05:00
put cameras on the cows and then the
05:02
cows go around and make videos
05:04
what do you say make videos what the
05:05
camera is they don't edit
05:07
like that they just gave a
05:10
did you see um there's a small uh island
05:13
i can't remember where it is but they
05:14
google um street view has not got to
05:17
them yet and they're
05:18
quite furious because they've learned
05:19
that google street view is a fantastic
05:21
way about
05:22
getting tourism because a lot of people
05:24
just go wow this place looks amazing we
05:25
should go
05:26
so they've attached cameras their own
05:27
cameras to the heads of of
05:29
sheep um and goats and they just have
05:31
them walk through and they've been
05:32
taking photos so this whole island is
05:34
being mapped
05:35
by sheep now but all sheep do is eat
05:37
grass so presumably all you're saying is
05:39
this place is full of grass real
05:42
close-ups
05:43
and also sheep following each other so
05:44
you're just going to get a lot of the
05:45
same pictures
05:46
just a lot of sheep's bottoms yeah
05:49
tourism has plummeted
05:50
it's also are naturally low down as well
05:52
yeah so
05:53
it's not practical yeah also on
05:57
barcodes um embryos are going to get
06:00
them
06:01
they're developing these at the moment
06:02
and this is to stop baby swap disasters
06:04
because you know there are always a few
06:05
news stories every year where people end
06:07
up with the wrong baby
06:08
the bucket doesn't go on the embryo uh
06:11
it goes on the egg one go
06:12
it goes on the egg or on the spot the
06:14
actual wow and the sponge
06:17
well they're on it this would be a
06:18
nightmare to scan apart from anything
06:20
else
06:21
off 500 million times
06:23
[Laughter]
06:26
here's the thing about barcodes when
06:27
they were introduced uh in the
06:30
in the 70s i think the first item bought
06:34
with the upc which stands for universal
06:36
product code
06:37
system was a bit of chewing gum but
06:40
it was really hard to introduce because
06:42
obviously you need hundreds of products
06:44
to have
06:44
barcodes in order for it to be worth
06:46
anyone's while and also
06:48
they didn't used to come on the
06:49
packaging so you used to get the food
06:50
into the shop and then you would have to
06:52
stick on
06:53
the barcodes the shopkeepers had to glue
06:55
them on to the boxes
06:56
yeah then you could scan them i mean
06:58
that doesn't that's not really that
06:59
weird because
07:01
a lot of reduced foods in supermarkets
07:03
come with a fresh barcode that's good
07:06
so yeah um but people were frightened of
07:08
them initially in the 70s people thought
07:10
they'd be blinded
07:11
because there are lasers involved oh
07:13
yeah blinded by the scanners
07:17
yeah but it's quite alien isn't it if
07:19
you're used to someone just ringing up
07:21
goods at the till
07:21
or you know a label which says 50p
07:23
that's weird
07:25
i mean i'm not frightened of them i'd
07:26
like to make that very clear it was the
07:28
70s we had we'd landed on the moon
07:31
i don't know i don't think witchcraft
07:33
people running out of supermarkets
07:34
screaming
07:37
no we landed on the moon before we had
07:39
the barcode yeah that's weird that is
07:40
odd yeah
07:41
yeah it feels like the moon is the
07:43
landing is the last thing that
07:44
we should do in fact i'm not sure we
07:47
should have landed there yet
07:48
even um
07:51
funny that you mentioned the devil
07:52
because uh the universal product code
07:55
um is part of a big devil conspiracy oh
07:58
yeah yeah yeah
07:58
it begins and ends with uh some sort of
08:00
uh easy identifying lines so that the
08:03
lasers kind of know where the code
08:05
begins and ends and that resembles
08:07
a 666 on either side no there is there's
08:09
a six and a six
08:10
there are three sixes throughout they're
08:12
not they're not quite sixes they
08:14
they there are sixes as well in the
08:15
barcode obviously but at the beginning
08:17
they're just they're just markers that
08:18
look like sixes they're not quite sexist
08:20
okay and there's a uh the guy who i
08:22
developed the product code
08:23
george joseph lara has got a section on
08:25
his website where he addresses this
08:26
constant
08:27
accusation he says there's nothing
08:29
sinister about this they resemble sixes
08:31
it's simply a coincidence like the fact
08:33
that my first middle and last name all
08:35
have six letters
08:37
if you'd like to ask me anything more
08:39
about this sacrifice a lamb on your lawn
08:41
at midnight
08:42
he does say i will not be answering any
08:44
questions of this as of
08:45
october 2000 or something there's a
08:48
section on his website
08:49
like the uh video that you remember
08:50
ringo starr oh
08:53
peace and love i'm not yeah any more fan
08:54
mail as of this date peace and love
08:56
peace
08:56
the thing is i genuinely believe that
08:58
ringo starr gets quite a lot of fan mail
09:00
whereas i
09:01
really struggle to believe that this man
09:03
is just inundated
09:06
or if he is it's the same two mad people
09:08
and he can just block their addresses
09:11
um i was trying to look into how
09:13
zookeepers identify
09:15
different species of animals say they
09:17
have a bunch in a cage and what do they
09:18
do to do that
09:20
sometimes they have training to teach
09:21
them the difference between say a rabbit
09:22
and a giraffe exactly
09:24
it's a better resource though
09:26
[Laughter]
09:28
and i didn't find anything but this is
09:30
the only reason i wanted to mention this
09:31
is that
09:32
um there's a great hashtag that you can
09:34
find on twitter which is hashtag
09:36
zookeepers problems and it's just really
09:38
fun because zookeepers around the world
09:39
just put up their problems so a few i
09:41
have here um
09:43
from yummy tees at yomi tees i have way
09:46
too much lemur pee in my hair right now
09:49
from jillian erzar uh at julian erzar
09:52
punched in the vag by a tortoise hashtag
09:54
zookeeper problems
09:56
how slow is jillian
10:02
zebras caused the most injuries to u.s
10:04
zookeepers
10:05
more than any other animal are those
10:06
injuries caused when the zookeepers
10:08
mispronounced their name so egregiously
10:10
just like andy did earlier yeah because
10:12
i think that's fair
10:12
what did i say hey zebra that's going to
10:15
be the only kind of
10:16
the only kind of feedback we'll get
10:18
about this episode is people saying why
10:19
on earth does andy say zebra
10:21
yeah is it a problem it's going to be
10:24
believe you me
10:25
potato potato zebra zebra yeah
10:28
zebra no no doesn't sound right so why
10:31
are they injuring
10:32
because they're wild animals but people
10:34
think they're like horses so i think
10:36
that it's just you're more likely to be
10:37
injured
10:37
so we're not domesticated it's
10:39
impossible to domesticate a zebra
10:41
they're really uh in fact there's only
10:43
one person i found
10:45
who managed to even slightly domesticate
10:48
them and that was
10:49
walter roth's child have you heard of
10:50
him yes he is an amazing man he was
10:53
a late 19th century early 20th century
10:57
he was a zoologist
10:58
naturalist he had the most amazing
11:00
collections of animals he collected
11:02
tens of thousands of butterflies he was
11:04
a roth child from the banking dynasty
11:05
the rothschild so he was seriously
11:07
wealthy
11:08
he didn't care about any of the banking
11:09
stuff all he wanted was to collect
11:10
animals
11:11
and he had a carriage uh harnessed with
11:15
four
11:15
zebras and he rode it along piccadilly
11:18
and into the forecourt of buckingham
11:20
palace
11:20
oh i think i've seen a photo of that
11:22
yeah yeah it's one of these sort of
11:24
historical photos that
11:25
gets trotted out a lot
11:29
um we still haven't it seems to be one
11:31
of those evolution
11:33
questions that we haven't solved yet of
11:35
why they have the black and white
11:36
the my favorite theory i just can't
11:38
believe this is that it cools the zebra
11:40
down because air might move
11:42
more quickly over the black uh bits of
11:45
skin which absorb light and then more
11:48
slowly over the white stripes which
11:50
reflect it
11:51
which might make little convection
11:53
currents around the zebra to cool down
11:55
cannot i cannot believe that's true well
11:57
i i mean first of all i think that god
11:59
slash darwin
12:00
is looking down on the zebra debate and
12:01
going you guys are overthinking this
12:04
so i just thought it would be fun
12:08
the theory that god slash darwin is
12:09
looking down right now only one of them
12:11
will be looking down right now
12:12
if they're right in fact it's a it's
12:16
either both of them or neither oh that's
12:17
right sorry so you are right
12:21
[Music]
12:22
[Applause]
12:27
okay it's time for fact number two and
12:29
that is alex
12:30
my fact this week is that agatha
12:31
christie was once turned away from a
12:33
party held in her honor
12:35
nice i think we've all had that yeah was
12:38
she was she too
12:39
drunk no she was too shy actually that
12:42
was the problem
12:43
so this is in april in 1958 um the
12:46
mousetrap which is the play in london
12:48
that
12:48
is based on the book that she wrote
12:50
became the longest running production
12:52
in the history of british theatre so
12:54
most performances ever
12:55
2239 performances and there was a big
12:58
party in the savoy hotel
12:59
and so she turned up all dressed up and
13:02
went to the party room and the guy at
13:04
the door didn't recognize her and she
13:06
was
13:06
so shy that she just got very
13:08
embarrassed and went and sat in the
13:09
lounge and had a drink by herself for
13:11
most of the evening
13:11
[Music]
13:13
she'd been asked to turn up early hadn't
13:14
she by peter saunders who was the
13:16
producer of mousetrap who said
13:18
avoid the press by turning up early and
13:20
you can sneak in early
13:21
and um i think when she did that she
13:23
couldn't get in until the party actually
13:24
started
13:25
oh so she did make it into the party
13:26
she'd get into the party yeah because i
13:27
read an account in the british newspaper
13:29
archive from the stage newspaper in 1958
13:31
and it was an account of the speech that
13:32
she made and
13:34
richard attenborough actually gave this
13:35
interview about what she'd said and she
13:37
just stood up it was one of the shortest
13:38
speeches
13:39
in theater history she said well
13:41
darlings i think we'll get a few months
13:42
out of it
13:44
so yeah which is weird because at that
13:46
point she'd already got 10 years out of
13:47
it
13:48
um in 1972 to exacerbate her shyness
13:51
there was another party held in her
13:52
honor because there seemed to be
13:53
constant parties held in honor of
13:55
someone who was very shy it's like a
13:56
form of torture
13:57
but in 1972 she turned up to the party
14:00
and she forgot her false teeth
14:02
because she was in her 80s at that point
14:03
and so none of the guests were allowed
14:04
to speak to her except her very closest
14:06
friends because she didn't want to open
14:07
her mouth
14:08
and did that cure her shyness
14:12
does it cure your shyness if nobody
14:13
speaks to you i suppose it might do
14:15
because then you have to go and speak to
14:16
other people can you imagine you're a
14:18
shy type you've
14:19
you've plucked up the courage to go to
14:21
your party
14:22
you know everyone's gonna want to talk
14:24
to you and you haven't brought your
14:25
[ __ ] team
14:26
here oh man yeah it's a tough moment
14:30
it's a tough moment so i was reading
14:33
this mousetrap
14:34
um uh play when she died the rights went
14:37
over to her grandson matthew
14:39
pritchard and there's been this big
14:40
thing where he's been
14:42
in a bit of a fight with uh wikipedia
14:45
because wikipedia often whenever they
14:48
put the uh
14:49
a novel or anything they'll often do a
14:50
really detailed plot analysis of what
14:52
goes on
14:53
and mousetrap famously has a plot twist
14:55
right at the end
14:57
and it's up there and so he's been
14:59
trying to get them to take it down and
15:00
it's very funny because even on the
15:01
wikipedia they now acknowledge that he's
15:03
trying to do it
15:04
um but so that he hasn't won wikipedia
15:06
says this is just information it stays
15:08
up there
15:08
but it's interesting this plot to us
15:10
because it's it the plot twist hang on
15:11
wait are you about to
15:12
i'm not gonna say it okay but the plot
15:13
twist has become famous for being a plot
15:16
twist
15:16
yes and so i i for one know what the
15:19
plot twist is because
15:21
of people saying oh there's this famous
15:22
plot to us where this happens
15:24
i've never actually experienced the
15:25
actual twist and i reckon the majority
15:27
of people
15:28
know what the twist is without ever
15:29
having actually had the twist happen to
15:31
them
15:32
which is a shame i don't know what the
15:33
twist is so i'm not going to go on the
15:35
wikipedia page
15:36
i kind of feel like it would be sporting
15:38
of them to take it down well there is
15:40
surprisingly um or rather unsurprisingly
15:42
on wikipedia
15:43
there's a page you can go to with huge
15:46
discussions from all the wikipedians
15:48
about the
15:49
attitude they're taking towards spoilers
15:51
that sounds like a really fun reading
15:55
yeah i mean it depends on the role of an
15:57
encyclopedia doesn't it is the role of
15:58
an encyclopedia to tell you
15:59
everything about you know the ending of
16:02
all plots
16:03
or is there all of an excitement to
16:04
pique your interest so you want to know
16:06
more
16:07
i think it's the first one to find out
16:09
what zebras really
16:10
are you'll have to come and see the
16:12
stage show
16:15
um do you know how she described herself
16:17
she said
16:18
she was a sausage machine
16:23
um not a sausage party vital difference
16:26
no she was
16:27
this was at a time for life when she was
16:28
writing two books a year she said
16:30
i'm a sausage machine a perfect sausage
16:32
machine there was one yet where
16:33
i think she wrote seven uh books plays
16:36
another collections of short stories
16:38
right yeah insane so if anything
16:40
if anything she's a mystery novel
16:41
machine rather than a sausage machine
16:44
i think but i think it was a metaphor
16:45
rather than her actually just describing
16:47
she is a writer and that was what made
16:48
her so brilliant as an author is she
16:50
never
16:50
you know she sometimes would not
16:51
literally describe the thing she was
16:53
what i love about her
16:53
was all those sausages yeah all the time
16:56
is that the plot twist on the mouse trap
16:58
yeah the lead characters are sausage all
16:59
along
17:00
it was in the drawing room with a
17:02
sausage i like the idea of her at the
17:05
press conference where she's giving the
17:07
interview saying the thing about me is
17:08
i'm just a sausage machine a perfect
17:10
sausage machine and every single
17:12
journalist trying to suppress that
17:13
snickers they write it down
17:20
[Laughter]
17:22
do you know where she did a load of her
17:23
writing on paper
17:25
on paper and in iraq i didn't know this
17:30
second husband uh was an archaeologist
17:32
and a really eminent archaeologist and
17:34
um
17:34
she uh she went out and did a lot of
17:36
digs with him so there are loads of
17:38
stories happening
17:39
you know exotic archaeology dig sites
17:41
and that kind of thing yeah
17:42
there are a fair few at least which do
17:44
and that's why she was a very keen
17:46
archaeologist wasn't she in the second
17:47
part like
17:48
she herself got into it as well as her
17:50
husband yeah and she said to her she
17:51
said to her husband there's a sort of
17:53
famous anecdote where she says
17:55
i just wish i knew a bit more about this
17:57
kind of pottery stuff and he says
17:59
do you realize you know more about this
18:01
ancient pottery than any other woman
18:03
alive in the world today
18:04
because it wasn't really studied by
18:05
women at the time right you know it was
18:07
quite a closed shop
18:08
yeah yeah wow um she if you go to the
18:11
british museum you can see a bunch of
18:12
artifacts that he uncovered i think he
18:14
made a particularly important find
18:15
in nimrod which is an ancient iraqi city
18:18
uh i found some a bunch of sort of 3000
18:20
year old
18:21
artifacts and they're in the british
18:22
museum and because she cleaned all his
18:23
artifacts so you can go and see stuff
18:25
that's been cleaned by agatha christie
18:26
so cool
18:28
so the british museum says the reason
18:29
these have probably been preserved so
18:30
well over the last hundred years is
18:32
because they were perfectly
18:33
cleaned by christie they called her the
18:35
queen of clean
18:36
i think they called it the sausage
18:38
machine
18:40
i kind
18:42
[Laughter]
18:46
um i was looking into other people who
18:48
have been turned away or kicked out from
18:49
their parties
18:50
uh nirvana kicked out of their own never
18:52
mind release party
18:54
wow what did they say as they walked
18:55
away
18:56
[Laughter]
18:59
yeah they um they it's really odd though
19:01
because you read what they did when they
19:02
got there
19:03
basically they started tossing around a
19:04
watermelon and
19:06
they effectively started a food fight
19:08
and they were told to leave
19:09
the uh release of their album that's a
19:11
pretty hardcore food fight to start
19:13
throwing an entire watermelon yeah
19:14
that's
19:14
true yeah i can understand if it was
19:17
lobbed at someone's face that that might
19:19
be
19:19
yeah start with mashed potatoes yeah i
19:22
got a fact about parties yeah
19:24
there are schools in japan for how to
19:26
have a party oh no
19:28
yeah oh cool because it's not really the
19:29
done thing because most people live in
19:31
very small homes so you don't
19:32
really have parties where you have loads
19:34
of people around very much
19:36
so there is this group which has been
19:38
set up called the home party association
19:40
which teaches you how and there are
19:42
three levels of certification
19:44
first one you just have to send them
19:45
about 22 quid and
19:47
pictures of a party that you have thrown
19:49
second one
19:50
level two you have to attend five hours
19:52
of lectures in how to throw a party and
19:54
you have to write an essay
19:55
and that costs about 200 quid the third
19:58
one
19:58
uh costs about 450 quid for all the
20:00
training and you have to successfully
20:02
host a party attended by the examiners
20:04
of the school
20:05
oh my god get this get this the failure
20:08
rate is ninety percent
20:10
whoa no [ __ ] any party attended by
20:13
examiners is gonna be crap
20:14
yeah the definition inviting your
20:16
teachers to a party
20:17
ruins it oh my god what they should have
20:19
taken tips from
20:20
is the party of the century in the 20th
20:23
century and i'd never heard of this but
20:25
it's
20:26
this party that apparently is the party
20:28
of the century it was in 1951 it was
20:30
thrown by
20:31
someone who was known as charlie who was
20:33
heir to some great mexican silver
20:35
fortune
20:36
and it sounds incredible and it's been
20:39
remembered in great party history great
20:41
party law
20:42
um as the greatest party ever thrown and
20:44
so
20:46
you said a bunch of stuff there that
20:47
doesn't exist
20:49
great party look a great big book of
20:51
famous parties
20:53
mentioned at every party great
20:57
encyclopedia of party legend i never i
20:59
never throw a party without reminding
21:01
all my guests of the greatest party of
21:02
the century in 1951
21:04
if you guys had attended these japanese
21:06
lectures you'd be like
21:08
what happened at this great time so this
21:09
is what happened it took place in
21:11
the palazzo labia in
21:15
okay it sounded venice you weren't wrong
21:18
um it was called the bal orientale or
21:21
lebel oriental depending on which
21:23
pronunciation is correct
21:24
um sorry an oriental ball inside a labia
21:27
yeah that's correct yeah the host wore
21:30
16-inch platform shoes so uh he was six
21:32
foot ten so he towered above all of his
21:34
guests he changed his costume 16 times
21:36
throughout the evening
21:38
and the roof of the place had a garden
21:41
designed by darley
21:42
and darley actually did attend darley
21:44
attended and christian dior attended and
21:46
they came dressed up as each other
21:48
this is a fun little uh little trick um
21:50
it was a costume ball but awesome
21:52
wells's costume didn't arrive on time so
21:54
he had to wear
21:55
just a normal suit which is very
21:57
embarrassing for all of you as himself
21:59
that's quite a good costume for a party
22:01
yeah he should have just claimed he
22:02
wasn't orson wells
22:06
um daisy fellows was there who was a
22:08
very famous
22:10
i think journalist um or socialite at
22:12
the time and she was the first time
22:13
anyone had ever worn leopard print so
22:15
she started the trend for work
22:16
first in the in the west it was the
22:18
first time you know
22:20
western person had worn leopard print
22:21
this party is sounding better and better
22:23
yeah isn't it
22:24
so many people threatened to be
22:25
cleopatra that it had to be up to the
22:26
host to settle who was going to come as
22:28
an apache to be clear
22:31
it's an anonymous phone call someone i'm
22:33
going to be clear patrick your party
22:35
um americans who hadn't been invited
22:37
because it was so famous it was
22:38
happening
22:39
uh they sailed over and arrived in the
22:42
lido nearby
22:43
in their yachts just in the desperate
22:44
hope of getting an invitation so there
22:46
were all these wealthy people's yachts
22:48
parked
22:48
in nearby coastline and lido's just in
22:51
hope they get it doesn't it sound
22:52
incredible
22:54
but who's charlie just a super rich guy
22:57
no one really knows anything more about
22:58
him
22:58
that's amazing that's very cool it
23:00
sounds kind of great gatsby-esque
23:02
so a great game do you think what was
23:03
the period of was that
23:05
it's like it's slightly later
23:10
through a party as well which uh was to
23:12
tie in with the publication of in cold
23:14
blood and that apparently
23:15
uh in america was the big party uh of
23:18
1966.
23:19
um yeah so um it was dubbed the night
23:22
capote made 500 friends and 15 000
23:25
enemies
23:25
because the invitations were so coveted
23:27
the idea
23:28
that he was saying no to people to come
23:32
to this party
23:32
created more enemies than uh than the
23:34
people who ended up coming liking him
23:36
and everyone wore masks so it was you
23:39
know
23:40
no one who knew who anyone was there
23:42
frank sinatra was there apparently
23:43
lauren because apparently no one knows i
23:45
had a mask on the only person without a
23:46
mask was andy warhol who just decided
23:48
not to wear a mask because it's so arty
23:50
and yeah that's like when brian cranston
23:53
went to uh comic con and he wore
23:54
a plastic mask with his own face on and
23:56
no one recognized him that's
23:58
really good it's funny are we sure jim
24:00
and capote didn't just invite
24:02
a few thousand randomers off the street
24:04
put masks on them take photos and then
24:05
point at the various photos going that's
24:07
frank sinatra there yeah
24:08
skepticism from the woman who told us
24:10
this [ __ ] and bull story about the
24:12
greatest party in 1951 ever told
24:14
i just don't like being faced with this
24:16
capote competition
24:18
um salvador dali once said i am never
24:21
alone
24:22
i'm used to being with salvador dali
24:24
always and that for me
24:25
is a permanent party
24:34
okay it is time for fact number three
24:36
and that is chozinski
24:38
my fact this week is that different
24:39
species of dolphins babysit each other's
24:42
children
24:43
um so this is some research that was
24:46
done a while back and reported in the
24:47
marine mammal science journal and it's
24:49
about
24:50
bottlenose dolphins and spotted dolphins
24:52
and how they work together and they do
24:54
loads of stuff together
24:55
and one of the things they do together
24:56
is leave their children with each other
24:58
so when dolphins dive deep to
25:00
hunt squid for instance their kids young
25:02
dolphins can't dive that deep so they
25:04
leave them with someone to care for them
25:06
and these two species is the first
25:08
instance of species um properly
25:09
cooperating in this way
25:11
it would be great if you could get an
25:12
animal babysitter just for your kids
25:14
what kind of animal would you pick to
25:16
babysit presumably not dolphin not
25:18
ever either but yeah well dolphins are
25:20
very well qualified if you give the kids
25:21
armbands and drop them in the sea
25:23
then get spotted they're a bit
25:26
sexy towards any human they come into
25:29
contact with aren't they
25:30
dan speaks from the personal experience
25:32
i don't know any time i've heard about
25:34
people with dolphins
25:35
there's always there's a sort of weird
25:36
humping going on yeah cause i feel like
25:38
you want to tell the sexy
25:39
no no no i just i just any time i've
25:41
read about dolphins
25:43
okay but then maybe i shouldn't be
25:44
googling those particular keywords
25:47
yeah i think hanging out in the wrong
25:48
section of the library you know that
25:50
dolphin
25:51
nipples are secret in that
25:59
they're hidden they have these abdominal
26:01
slits and the the nipples are kind of
26:03
inside the slits are the the mammary
26:05
mammary slits they're called
26:07
and also the penis of the male dolphin
26:09
is the same it's in a
26:10
slit and it sort of it can poke out but
26:13
it can retract within the slit as well
26:15
so it's not how convenient
26:16
external yeah i read an article title
26:18
that was called dolphins have scary
26:20
hand-like penises
26:21
and did you read that as well well i did
26:23
but i've read a debunking of it
26:25
but you say what have you no i just they
26:27
have a retractable penis um
26:29
and the idea was that they use it uh to
26:32
find things if they're near if they're
26:34
near a sort of a surface area
26:36
they'll use it like humans in the dark
26:38
used hands to find their way around
26:39
things
26:41
i'm afraid that's not quite true i've
26:44
read a thing by a science writer called
26:46
justin greg
26:46
who's a bit of an expert on these masses
26:49
and he's there's a myth that dolphins
26:50
have prehensile penises
26:52
and that doesn't really make any sense
26:54
because prehensile like prehensile tails
26:56
which can be used to grip and grab
26:57
things and
26:57
wrap around things um they can extend it
27:00
and they can retract it and they can
27:02
bend it
27:02
in different directions to help with
27:04
mating um but they probably
27:06
can't pick up keys for example
27:09
yeah that's enough if you give someone
27:11
directions with that kind of either yeah
27:12
someone directions with it if you really
27:14
tried hard yeah
27:14
so that's not too far off is that too
27:16
far off yeah yeah yeah yeah so
27:18
this this is an interesting thing they
27:19
have such control because
27:21
dolphins like wales they have pelvises
27:24
because they evolved from
27:24
land animals which got bored of being on
27:27
land went back into the sea right
27:28
so all the muscles which attach to their
27:30
penis and give them this controls
27:32
left right in out that kind of thing um
27:34
they are
27:35
directly attached to the pelvic bone and
27:37
one side has said it's like operating a
27:39
trick
27:40
kite where you pull two strings and
27:42
pulling left and right makes it go in a
27:44
loop-de-loop
27:44
but i don't think wow that's quite a
27:46
specialized i don't think dolphin
27:47
penises can do a loop-de-loop
27:49
you're talking about the secret nipples
27:50
it's really interesting how the babies
27:52
drink the mother's milk so they have a
27:55
tongue that they can turn into like a
27:56
little straw you know when you kind of
27:57
like loop your tongue over and some
27:58
people do that yeah oh yeah like that
28:00
they do that
28:01
and their tongue has little fingery
28:02
things on the end that kind of
28:04
go into the nipple and act a bit like a
28:06
zip like they kind of latch on to make
28:07
it a little bit of a seal because it is
28:09
difficult because they're drinking milk
28:10
underwater so it's liquid and liquid oh
28:12
yeah well otherwise it would seep out
28:14
yeah exactly and it's got the
28:15
consistency of milkshake apparently the
28:16
milk and um and yeah it lasts about five
28:18
ten seconds
28:19
but it smells really it smells like fish
28:22
a milkshake that smells like fish
28:23
imagine everything smells a fish in the
28:25
ocean
28:25
but can't they only taste salt oh
28:29
yeah i think you're right yeah i think
28:30
that is true they lost all their other
28:32
taste possible
28:32
they lost and they lost the sense of
28:33
smell they used to have it when they
28:35
were on
28:36
um land and then obviously in water you
28:38
don't need to smell the air
28:39
and then the nostrils moved above their
28:42
head to become the blowhole i just
28:44
i want to know about the middle of that
28:45
process where muscles from moving
28:47
north adolescent stage where they have
28:49
their nostrils
28:50
yeah the unicorn yeah that's bizarre
28:53
isn't it it's so bizarre
28:54
um you know dolphins grandmothers
28:57
sometimes feed them
28:58
so and they employ wet nurses i think
29:00
it's underwater they're all wet nurses
29:04
i i there's a theory that um that
29:08
male dolphins can tell when female
29:11
dolphins are
29:12
pregnant because they take we know they
29:13
take a special interest in females when
29:14
they're pregnant
29:15
and there's a theory that's because they
29:16
have capability to use ultrasound
29:19
so that they can do ultrasound without
29:21
having to make an appointment at a
29:23
sonogram
29:23
so do they see them and go oh it's a boy
29:27
don't tell me
29:31
i feel like we quite in dolphin-esque
29:33
that'll be quite rude actually to look
29:34
at someone else's don't look inside my
29:36
wife's stomach
29:37
yeah it's like having x-ray specs all
29:39
the time yeah imagine
29:41
babies imagine taking your wife to the
29:43
ultrasound and it's just a dolphin
29:45
yeah i'd be like oh great we're in good
29:47
hands
29:49
um except they're not because we have
29:51
this impression that dolphins are really
29:52
nice but um
29:54
some dolphins some male bottlenose
29:56
dolphins kill
29:57
newborn calves uh which is not nice
30:01
why do they do that they do it it's
30:04
really grim actually they do it because
30:05
it frees up the females for mating
30:07
because if a female has a newborn cuff
30:10
she will be looking after the cuff for
30:11
some years she won't be interested in
30:13
having any more offspring
30:14
uh whereas if uh if the the males have
30:17
killed off the
30:18
uh the cuff them within a few months she
30:19
might be ready to mate again do they
30:21
have to i don't know if we would know
30:22
this but do they have to do it
30:23
sort of behind while the mother's away
30:25
on a trip no the the
30:26
truth um the holiday babysitting is
30:29
going on yeah presumably
30:31
they just kind of mob the mother and so
30:33
the mother will try and protect her cuff
30:35
and often
30:36
will succeed in protecting her from the
30:38
males and get away with them
30:39
yeah yeah yeah and then the mothers find
30:40
just a mate with that
30:42
dolphin again they get over it don't
30:44
they pretty fast in the animal world
30:45
they've got to procreate
30:47
healthy family not they i think actually
30:50
i think bottlenose dolphins might be the
30:52
bastards of the dolphin world
30:54
because actually this initial fact was
30:55
about bottlenose and spotted dolphins um
30:57
looking after each other's children
30:59
but the only instance they've found is
31:00
of spotted dolphins looking after
31:02
bottlenose dolphins children not the
31:03
other way around
31:04
and actually there's quite a lot of
31:06
instances as well as them cooperating
31:07
with each other species-wise
31:09
bottlenose dolphins will just force
31:10
their way into a group of spotted
31:11
dolphins and start shagging the women in
31:13
them
31:13
and there's nothing that the spotteds
31:15
can do because they're half the size yes
31:17
yeah they're just gonna take their women
31:19
so actually they're kind of bullies
31:22
bottlenose bullies there's evidence in
31:24
uh marine research centers that kind of
31:26
manage large areas of water
31:27
with lots of species in that when
31:29
dolphins get bored of all the human toys
31:31
and things that they
31:32
use baby sharks as volleyballs which is
31:34
definitely bullying
31:35
well that's how that that's how dolphins
31:37
uh kill baby dolphin
31:38
calves they toss them out of the water
31:42
or they will hold them under the water
31:43
too because obviously dolphins need to
31:45
come up forever yeah
31:46
have you guys heard of a wolfen it's a
31:49
whale
31:49
dolphin half whale half dolphin it's
31:52
amazing how big is it
31:53
a massive dolphin it was in between the
31:54
size of the two
31:56
because it was the false killer whale
31:57
there i think that's slightly smaller
31:58
than uh
31:59
killer whales it must be so bad for it
32:01
though just so awkward like who do you
32:03
hang out with you're
32:04
way too small for the whales and you're
32:05
way too big for the door sell it to
32:07
pixar
32:07
sell it to pixar alex
32:14
okay time for our final fact of the show
32:16
and that's my fact
32:18
my fact this week is that sylvester
32:19
stallone's mum is a bum reader
32:22
it's a bit harsh there's no way to speak
32:25
this is something
32:26
she is very proud about according to her
32:29
website which she has taken down and we
32:30
had to search very hard
32:32
to verify this is the kind of fact you
32:34
get when james harkin is away for a week
32:36
for the podcast that's what slips
32:37
through the net i know this is my only
32:39
chance
32:41
this is called rompology and why didn't
32:44
they call it
32:44
astrology oh nice
32:48
yeah okay so for anyone who hasn't heard
32:50
of rompology or
32:51
astrology that nearly causes those
32:53
people exist surely everyone's familiar
32:55
with the arts
32:57
what they do is rhompologists look at
33:00
people's
33:01
bums and they make predictions off the
33:03
back of the creases
33:05
off the back of any how many creases are
33:07
there there's one
33:09
do you have do you have to spread like
33:11
how much detail is this
33:13
well depends how much how far into the
33:15
future
33:17
your future is very dark but yeah so i
33:20
was reading about this i
33:21
actually found out about this because um
33:24
i was emailing an author called david
33:26
bramwell
33:27
who wrote an incredible book called
33:28
number nine bus to utopia
33:31
and he's also the maker of a podcast and
33:34
a live show called the auditorium
33:35
and so he puts on these nights and he
33:37
had a rumpologist speak at one of his
33:39
events and i thought what the hell's a
33:40
rompologist googled it
33:41
found out that jackie stallone sylvester
33:43
stallone's mum
33:44
has done it and um she's done it to the
33:46
point where even on her website again
33:48
this is quite hard to verify because
33:50
it's been taken down
33:51
um but suggestions sort of little echoes
33:54
of a past website through
33:55
reading on reddit and so on suggests
33:57
this that she used to charge 600
33:59
and you would send a printed copy of
34:02
your bum
34:03
to her and she would read your bum
34:05
digitally as it were
34:06
i love a printed copy of yours how does
34:09
one print one
34:10
now with 3d printing you probably can
34:13
print your bum
34:13
you probably can get them oh i think
34:15
that's was the perfect excuse for all
34:16
the office parties whenever someone was
34:18
called sitting on the
34:20
copy no no i want to know about my
34:21
business prospect for the next year
34:24
but according to wikipedia jackie
34:26
stallone has
34:27
claimed to predict the outcome of
34:29
presidential elections and
34:30
the oscar winners uh by reading the
34:32
bottoms of her two pet
34:34
doberman pincers so it doesn't he works
34:36
on animals as well
34:37
yeah she's reading she's reading animal
34:39
buns and it doesn't seem it doesn't so
34:41
it's one thing to send your picture of
34:43
your own bomb and get your own future
34:44
but for some reason these two dogs have
34:46
the future presidential elections in
34:47
them instead
34:51
sometimes they're just born lucky like
34:53
what are the odds of her having those
34:54
dogs as well
34:55
yeah they're amazing yeah um dan you
34:58
briefly read out from the wikipedia on
35:00
rompology just there um which is
35:03
surprisingly restrained actually in what
35:05
it says about this ancient art
35:07
but i do want to read out one paragraph
35:09
from it
35:10
the american astrologer jackie stallone
35:12
claims
35:13
that rompology is known to have been
35:15
practiced in ancient times by the
35:16
babylonians the indians and the ancient
35:18
greeks and romans
35:19
although she provides no evidence for
35:21
this claim
35:22
stallone has been largely responsible
35:24
for the supposed
35:25
quote mark's revival of rompology in
35:28
modern times
35:28
it's the most skeptical paragraph i've
35:30
ever read about anything the idea was
35:31
going in and out of vogue as well
35:34
yeah the ancient romans would have um
35:37
you know spent their time on it
35:38
just to clarify how you print a bum
35:40
because i just feel like people are
35:41
going to have been wondering
35:42
yeah and she does tell you did you see
35:43
how what she said you can do no
35:45
you can henna your bum and then you sit
35:47
on a piece of papyrus she says because i
35:49
guess she's trying to enhance the
35:51
ancient origins of perspectives
35:54
so you sit your head a newly wet henna
35:57
darts on a bit of papyrus and then you
35:59
blow it dry or whatever and send that
36:00
off to her and she can read the imprint
36:02
she doesn't even need the physical
36:03
that is fantastic potato prince
36:06
but with your art it's very skilled of
36:08
her not to need the original bum i mean
36:10
it's amazing
36:10
isn't it incredible yeah i guess that's
36:12
what you pay your six hundred dollars
36:13
for don't you
36:16
where do you get papyrus these days is
36:18
that is that in ryman's is that
36:20
readily available yeah you're right it's
36:22
hard it's next to the
36:23
80 gsm papyrus
36:27
papyrus is really good though i mean it
36:28
lasts a lot longer than our paper
36:30
well that means all the paper from our
36:32
time of this current bit of history is
36:33
going to go except for these bits of
36:34
papyrus that just have
36:35
aspirin little is known of the
36:38
civilization of the early 21st century
36:41
but they accurately predicted every
36:43
single thing that has come to pass
36:45
so here's the thing the ancient
36:46
babylonians also believed that you could
36:48
predict the future
36:49
um and they believed it was by the liver
36:52
that was the part of the body they
36:53
thought was really significant
36:55
and but how do you know which bit of the
36:57
liver
36:58
means what and they had a model liver
37:01
so you would kill a sheep get out it get
37:04
a special priest
37:05
get uh the liver out and um
37:08
he had a special wooden liver or there
37:10
were even some
37:11
special bronze livers and it says look
37:14
if this bit is discolored this way then
37:16
you're an alcoholic
37:17
[Laughter]
37:20
yeah it's hepatology uh the no sorry
37:23
not hepatology i'm sorry that is the
37:25
medical study of the liver
37:27
it's not hepatology i think that's going
37:29
to be the thing that gets most feedback
37:30
out of it right my
37:31
zebra pronunciation earlier liver
37:33
surgery
37:35
going to correct it right now it's
37:37
hepatoscopy um and it's a branch of
37:39
haroo spacey which is which was the yeah
37:42
bub learning and etruscan study of
37:43
various organs which spelt out your
37:45
future in some way but yeah it was
37:46
really popular wasn't it
37:48
a common way of of telling the future
37:50
and in fact
37:51
an example very famous example of how
37:53
responsibility was
37:54
um in caesar julius caesar so do you
37:57
know the way the ides of march was
37:58
predicted
37:59
was not by because of this practice
38:03
um the beware the eyes of march famously
38:06
that julius caesar was told to do and he
38:08
was told this by a haroos bassist
38:10
who is someone who looks at the entrails
38:12
of animals to tell the future so i think
38:14
it was the entrails of a sheep
38:16
which informed the haroos persist that
38:18
to tell caesar to beware the eyes of
38:19
march
38:20
and that was recorded by i think
38:21
sewertonius so here's the things um
38:24
isaac newton himself did a lot of future
38:26
predicting
38:27
yes and we you know he was very
38:29
interested in
38:30
uh learning about the nature of god is
38:33
it just it's so
38:34
contrary to the modern image of him he
38:36
devised a chronology of
38:38
all the great events before his life and
38:39
then he did a chronology of the future
38:42
as well
38:42
so he predicted a thing called the
38:44
tribulation of the jews and he predicted
38:46
a thousand years of peace are going to
38:47
begin in 2370
38:49
uh and part of it was based on the life
38:51
cycle of the locust i mean it was
38:53
seriously out there that's also quite
38:56
scientific in a way the idea of taking a
38:58
load of data and trying to find trends
38:59
based on
39:00
kind of things that happen no that's the
39:01
kind of thing that conspiracy theorists
39:03
do it's not scientific it's taking a lot
39:04
of data
39:05
and making it find the trends that you
39:06
want it to find i think or finding
39:08
there is it's not finding it making
39:11
future predictions on say
39:12
you know what's going to happen with
39:13
climate change and global warming based
39:14
on past data
39:16
like that is science also there's good
39:17
ways and bad ways to do it but it's two
39:18
sides of the same coin yeah
39:20
i was reading about one of thailand's
39:21
leading fortune tellers oh yeah whose
39:23
name is
39:24
luck rackanithes and he says that the
39:26
fact that his name is luck
39:28
which means luck in english is complete
39:30
coincidence there was an interview with
39:32
him recently
39:33
um where he he runs this system now
39:36
which is like a call center where people
39:37
just literally
39:38
ring in they get get their horoscopes or
39:40
they get told what lottery numbers to to
39:42
choose or whatever he's a
39:44
multi-multi-millionaire so
39:45
hundreds of thousands of people call him
39:47
every month and um the way he did it was
39:49
he just memorized a bunch of astrology
39:51
books when he was a child and then
39:52
regurgitates it but he
39:54
spoke to channel four i think in the
39:55
last couple of years and channel 4 asked
39:58
him how he finds it just reading
40:00
people's futures and telling them what's
40:01
going to happen to them and
40:03
he said i want to change my life i'm not
40:06
kidding i'm so bored of going places
40:07
with people shouting teacher look at my
40:09
palm tell me my fortune
40:11
he's basically completely well i don't
40:12
think he ever believed it but he's now
40:14
gone these people are all idiots who are
40:16
asking me
40:17
what's going to happen to them and he
40:19
acknowledges there's no point in asking
40:21
me if you're going to get rich
40:22
you need to get rich using your own
40:23
brains i can't tell you what's going to
40:25
happen to you you actually have to just
40:26
go out there and make it happen for
40:27
yourself
40:28
you should sell that device over the
40:29
phone to people yeah
40:31
perhaps he is yeah i don't think he
40:33
makes much money press one for an angry
40:36
rant
40:39
[Music]
40:42

no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:19
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:22
covent garden my name is ann tajinski i
00:25
am here with
00:25
andrew hunter murray and this week we
00:28
are joined by
00:29
two great pillars of qi the
00:32
producer of qi piers fletcher and one of
00:35
qi's longest serving
00:37
been there for a million years
00:38
researchers and historian
00:41
justin pollard and once again we've
00:43
gathered around the microphones with our
00:44
four favorite facts in the last seven
00:45
days and in no particular order here
00:48
we go starting with you justin
00:51
okay so the first person recorded ever
00:53
buying a pornographic book
00:55
in england was samuel peaks
00:59
so how was he recorded typically
01:02
idiotically he managed to record it
01:04
himself
01:04
because you know pete's wrote this sort
01:06
of 10-year diary
01:08
which is great cause he records a great
01:09
fire of london and uh the plague and all
01:11
sorts of big events but the main use of
01:13
it is he records
01:14
the details of his everyday life and he
01:16
wrote in his diary
01:17
that he'd seen the idol roguish book le
01:20
chol de fe
01:20
which i have bought in plain binding
01:24
and he takes it home and he reads it but
01:26
then he promises himself in his diary
01:27
which is written in shorthand so nobody
01:29
else can read it
01:30
but uh as soon as i've read it i will
01:32
burn it
01:33
which as far as we know he did there's
01:34
only one copy left of this book in the
01:37
world
01:37
wow so he burned it in order to save
01:40
himself the embarrassment of having it
01:42
found among his collection but then he
01:43
recorded the fact that he'd read it in
01:45
his diary yeah he failed to clear his
01:46
browser history
01:47
yes when he bought it he wrote in his
01:50
diary well i was thinking about getting
01:51
it because it's in french
01:52
maybe it would be a good translation
01:53
tool for my wife
01:55
and then i think he saw what was in it
01:57
and thought maybe not
01:58
yeah but the great thing is that he
02:00
found it and then he went away for a
02:02
month nearly he's obviously been
02:03
praying on his mind i might just go down
02:07
the strand
02:08
today and then eventually oh look at
02:10
this at bookshop again he went in and
02:12
and then he's apparently he stayed there
02:13
and he he hung about in the bookshop for
02:15
an hour
02:16
before actually buying it in a plane
02:19
like this
02:21
exactly so sorry just was the plane
02:23
binding in the same way as peop
02:24
adults read harry potter with a
02:26
different binding was that uh
02:28
exactly just so that you know when he's
02:29
got a shelf at home it doesn't say
02:31
you know pornographic book on the spot
02:34
he says the reason is because he it was
02:36
cheaper in plain binding and he was yeah
02:37
he only took it home
02:38
in order to destroy it he didn't want to
02:40
destroy the expenses he intends no one
02:42
else to read but he's lying to himself
02:45
it is weird because at the end of his
02:46
diaries because he gave up after about
02:48
10 years the personal diary because of
02:50
his
02:50
his eyesight was failing he was making
02:51
him blind yeah
02:53
he was right um and he said i'm going to
02:56
keep going with my other diary because
02:58
he kept another diary going but it was
02:59
just official engagements and things
03:00
like that and it was being kept for him
03:02
by other people
03:03
so he said i have to put in only what i
03:05
can decently tell other people and which
03:08
i will be sure won't get out
03:09
did he mean for it to be seen do we know
03:12
we don't know for his private diary
03:13
certainly it is not during his lifetime
03:15
not by his wife
03:16
obviously so he does record sort of
03:18
every detail in it and he has numerous
03:20
affairs
03:21
but the funny thing is he obviously must
03:22
be very conflicted because he's writing
03:24
it as you say in
03:25
code but at the same time he copies it
03:27
out in fair
03:28
and puts it into leather-bound i think
03:30
and makes sure that it's represented so
03:32
there must be some part of him that was
03:33
saying somebody's going to read this and
03:34
enjoy this one day
03:35
otherwise you know why would you why
03:37
would you bother i think he must have
03:39
thought i think that's like teenagers do
03:40
that all the time don't they write about
03:42
their boyfriends and pretend that they
03:43
want to hide the knowledge of it and
03:44
leave it i think
03:46
you know in a long time in the future it
03:48
will be lovely when people get to read
03:49
about my life
03:50
i think what he had was an early case of
03:52
portnoy's complaint
03:54
portnoy's complaint is a disorder in
03:55
which strongly felt ethical and
03:57
altruistic impulses are perpetually
03:58
warring with extreme sexual longings of
04:00
a perverse nature
04:02
yeah because he does say he's uh there's
04:03
nothing wrong with a a decent
04:05
man a morally upstanding man reading
04:07
material like that for the sake of
04:08
educating themselves
04:09
he justifies themselves as they did
04:11
right into the 19th century with the uh
04:12
the secret room of the british museum
04:14
you know which contained all the sort of
04:15
phallic statues
04:16
and things that were considered
04:17
inappropriate for the public there was a
04:19
there was a
04:20
secret museum uh at naples and it's
04:23
exactly the same thing all the erotic
04:25
art that was found at uh pompei and
04:26
herculaneum uh so there's a statue of
04:29
uh the god pan um sort of
04:32
he's getting off with a goat yes yes
04:34
extraordinary sculpture
04:36
yeah he really is they really are in a
04:37
loving embrace definitely yeah and that
04:39
that is the same thing that happened and
04:41
pompeii had these erotic frescoes and
04:43
they had locked
04:44
metal cabinets put over them but if you
04:46
were a gentleman and you paid a small
04:48
fee they would remove the locked metal
04:49
cabinet
04:51
from the top of the fresco and you could
04:52
see it but if you're a woman no dice i'm
04:53
afraid anna
04:54
this is interesting is what you're
04:56
saying is the first recorded instance of
04:57
byron buying pornography but apparently
04:59
what happened was
05:00
most pornography at that time was
05:02
circulated in the form of manuscripts
05:04
miscellaneous that people would keep
05:05
people would keep a miscellany of
05:08
these kinds of things but also recipes
05:10
and political tracks and school
05:11
exercises and they just keep them all
05:13
bound together
05:13
for themselves and to give to their
05:15
friends but there was only ever one copy
05:16
of each one
05:17
i've got one here this is a guy named
05:19
anthony scattergood who was a theologian
05:21
at trinity college
05:26
he has an erotic poem called on six
05:28
cambridge maids bathing themselves by
05:30
queen's college june 15 16 29
05:33
which is quite good and then immediately
05:35
after that is a recipe that says for the
05:37
eyes take snails and prick them through
05:39
the shells with a great pin
05:41
and they will issue out a fat water drop
05:43
the same into the eyes evening and
05:44
morning
05:45
wow and you know so that frankly
05:48
probably less attractive than the six
05:49
uh was the kind of thing they just
05:52
gathered together in these miscellaneous
05:54
and often inverse form as well because
05:55
if it was inverse it was sort of a
05:57
little bit less
05:57
sort of graphic it was a bit more arty
05:59
if it's inverse so
06:00
yeah best-selling pornographic versus
06:03
the 15th century
06:04
uh is a book called the tale of two
06:06
lovers and you know wrote it
06:07
oh that was the pope's one was it was
06:09
pope pius the second yeah
06:11
this was to be fair before he became
06:13
pope that he wrote this book
06:14
all the popes have a past don't they so
06:16
there was a there was the goalkeeper and
06:17
there was the
06:18
hitler youth guy yes you know and the
06:21
one who wrote yes a tale of two lovers
06:23
that is saucier than most popes it's
06:26
samuel peeps
06:28
i think my favorite line in all the
06:30
diaries is he he woke up
06:32
and he was going down into the cellar
06:34
and his exact words are and put my foot
06:35
into a great heap of turds
06:37
my mistake uh it's just very funny
06:41
one of the only things i knew about
06:42
samuel peeps is that he buried
06:44
his parmesan during the great fire of
06:46
london i did not know that he was
06:49
involved in the great fire of london and
06:50
then he he went to visit
06:52
it he went yeah no he went to visit the
06:54
king halfway through
06:55
and um advised the king will you need to
06:57
pull down the houses whether
06:59
where the fire hasn't got to yet make
07:00
what they call a fire break so it
07:02
doesn't spread outside that area
07:04
didn't he say he also said that the fire
07:05
of london went on for months and months
07:06
after we thought it did so i think it
07:07
was still burning in march the following
07:09
year
07:10
yeah it's not weird and it started in
07:12
september so
07:14
yeah really strange very strange another
07:17
thing i didn't know about him was that
07:18
he
07:18
sort of wore spectacles which he was
07:20
very impressed by
07:21
and thought worked really well but what
07:23
they were was um paper tubes
07:26
which had been invented a few decades
07:28
earlier and they were just rolled up
07:30
bits of black paper and they were wider
07:32
at the eye
07:32
end than they were at the reading end
07:34
and so they focused right
07:36
in on you know tiny lettering they do
07:38
kind of work
07:39
i guess it gets rid of glare well it's a
07:42
small aperture isn't it
07:43
you know with the camera people don't
07:45
use old-fashioned cameras but with a
07:46
small aperture on the lens you get a
07:47
much greater depth of field and you're
07:49
just using that effect you said that
07:50
nero had emeralds polished as glasses so
07:53
for his reading but he was nero
07:54
yeah and that's probably a made-up story
07:59
[Music]
08:02
okay let's move on to fact number two
08:04
and that is
08:06
from pis yeah this is me um my fact
08:09
is that if 50 people swam continuously
08:12
for 15 months in an olympic-sized
08:14
swimming pool the water would boil
08:18
have you worked that out yeah i've got
08:19
the physics the thing is
08:22
it's rubbish physique says you know
08:24
basically doesn't work but so what we do
08:26
is it's an idealized model but what this
08:28
comes from is there's
08:29
james jewell after whom the jewel is
08:31
named named
08:33
and a joule is the amount of energy it
08:34
takes to lift a tomato one meter from
08:36
the ground
08:37
but the thing is tomorrow 100 tomorrow
08:42
standard tomorrow oh your standard
08:43
european tomato
08:45
yeah but anyway it's also the point is
08:46
it's also the amount of energy released
08:48
when you drop the tomato
08:49
back to the ground and that each of
08:51
those is one joule and the point about
08:53
that is conservation of energy
08:54
you can't create or destroy energy only
08:56
convert it from one form to another so
08:57
if you have people
08:59
swimming around that they raise the
09:00
temperature of the water and he
09:01
demonstrated this he had a tank
09:03
which was sealed and he had a paddle in
09:04
it and a rope which a bit of a
09:07
string of something that came out at the
09:08
top over a pulley and then he had a
09:09
weight on the end and the weight drops
09:12
turns the paddle and he measures the
09:14
wart the temperature of the water and
09:15
is able to demonstrate that the the
09:18
amount of energy from the dropping
09:19
weight is
09:20
exactly equal to the amount of energy
09:21
from the increase in temperature
09:24
in the water so does it matter
09:27
what stroke you'd be doing no not
09:30
just about the body heat it's not well
09:33
that's the other thing it's not about
09:34
your body
09:34
i for the purposes of this calculation
09:36
i've excluded the body heat effect right
09:38
have you excluded the fact that if you
09:40
put people in 50 degree water they tend
09:42
to sort of stop functioning certainly
09:43
after 15 months
09:44
i've got various things that need to be
09:47
left out of the calculation here in
09:48
order to make it work
09:50
one of them is that the water in this
09:52
idealized swimming pool doesn't radiate
09:54
heat away you know
09:55
the heat that they create all stays
09:56
there the other is
09:58
that there's nothing to do with the body
09:59
heat um and the other thing is i
10:02
that you have to find a swimming pool
10:03
that's open on christmas day because
10:05
otherwise
10:07
that is the hardest thing as opposed to
10:09
the laws of thermodynamics which are
10:10
easy to move around
10:12
i guess it's a lido that we're looking
10:13
for yeah yeah
10:15
and the other the other thing actually
10:16
which makes it difficult is it an
10:17
olympic sized swimming pool you know
10:18
this does not have a standard size
10:20
because the depth is not standard it can
10:23
be it can be anything from two meters to
10:25
three meters
10:25
the pool in my illustration i'm not
10:28
gonna actually run through all these
10:28
numbers so rather than link it but
10:29
this is two meters deep it all it starts
10:32
at 20 degrees and
10:33
it would take 11 200 hours which is 466
10:36
days to raise the temperature by 80
10:37
degrees from there
10:38
wow and the other thing of course you
10:40
got to continue with is at what point
10:41
people die
10:43
yeah you can replace them though so you
10:44
could just have substitutes presumably
10:46
just
10:46
standard are you getting people to dive
10:48
into a swimming pool which is
10:50
90 degrees already full of fecal matter
10:54
yeah if you could put me down for an
10:55
early shift please slash that would be
10:56
great
10:57
so many caveats there's an entire thesis
10:59
of caveats
11:00
but once we've overcome them this is
11:02
teammating yeah team-making for the
11:03
future
11:04
guys about swimming which does not i'm
11:07
afraid it's not in the
11:08
idealized realm of physics but it is an
11:10
actual fact
11:13
okay so this is about urinating in
11:15
swimming pools so
11:16
if a pool is chlorinated and you have a
11:20
way in it it creates a chemical called
11:21
cyanogen chloride did you know this and
11:23
it's
11:24
also it's toxic um it reacts with
11:28
uh nitrogen it's when chlorine reacts
11:29
with the nitrogen in your urine
11:31
and it acts basically is tear gas and
11:32
cyanogen chloride is classified as an
11:34
agent of chemical warfare
11:36
so when you have a pee in the swimming
11:37
pool you are technically in breach
11:40
of the organization for the prohibition
11:41
of chemical weapons you are a war
11:43
criminal
11:44
swimming pool if you don't report it to
11:46
the opcw
11:48
uh then yeah that sounds like it's a
11:50
more idealized
11:51
experiment than that there's a
11:52
calculation on this as well and it was
11:54
to see
11:55
uh whether you could produce enough
11:57
cyanogen chloride in this same
11:59
olympic-sized swimming pool that we
12:00
found that's open on christmas day
12:01
the boiling one yeah exactly um that
12:04
would cause
12:05
a fatal uh amount of cyanogen chloride
12:07
to be created
12:08
so this is done by casey johnston as
12:10
technica and um
12:11
she calculated that what you needed is 2
12:15
500 parts per billion that's a fatal
12:16
dose of cyanogen chloride
12:18
she said what it turned out you would
12:20
need is a swimming pool that was two
12:22
parts water to one part chlorine
12:24
so is anyway completely fatal to swim in
12:27
before you get it
12:28
and you also need about three million
12:30
people to have a pea in it
12:31
before they were killed by the chlorine
12:33
in the pool
12:34
so we can't put it to military use just
12:36
yet wheel paddling pools
12:38
onto the front lines no it does also
12:42
make a thing called
12:43
trichloramine which is another lung
12:45
irritant and it makes a tiny bit of
12:46
chloroform as well
12:48
who knew that this much was going on
12:49
when you had to be in the pool there is
12:50
a way of making flashy's boiling pool
12:52
work of course you have to do just one
12:54
simple thing to his pool of water and
12:56
the people without killing them
12:58
all you have to do is raise the pool up
13:00
a mere 18 kilometers into the air
13:03
well 18 kilometers in the air then water
13:06
will boil at blood temperature
13:07
well that's probably a better solution
13:08
so which would probably be easier
13:10
actually if you just raised up it's
13:11
called the armstrong limit
13:12
we've made a breakthrough i mean people
13:13
said this as a student
13:15
it's been very useful but it has been
13:17
checked because of course when uh pilots
13:19
who go very high
13:20
above 18 kilometers you have to wear a
13:21
pressure suit no matter how much oxygen
13:22
you're getting from an oxygen mask
13:24
because beyond that point things like
13:25
your tears and your saliva start to boil
13:27
stop boiling
13:28
there is there is a recording of an
13:30
american pilot who said the last thing
13:32
remembers for
13:33
blacking out this is going above 18
13:35
kilometers without a pressure suit
13:36
is feeling the uh the sensation of his
13:39
saliva boiling on his tongue
13:40
wow oh that's got to be unpleasant
13:44
do you know about boiling in space this
13:46
is very cool so
13:47
this is a thing which hadn't been done
13:49
obviously for decades because they have
13:50
more pressing things to do like going to
13:51
the moon
13:52
but obviously the further up you go the
13:54
lower the boiling point of water
13:56
and in the 1990s they did a series of uh
13:59
experiments on boiling on the space
14:01
shuttle
14:02
uh and they found out that you know when
14:03
you boil a catalan it has thousands and
14:05
thousands of bubbles
14:06
when you boil a liquid in space it just
14:08
produces one
14:09
big bubble no yeah and it hoovers up all
14:12
the
14:12
other bubbles it swallows up all the
14:13
others so you just have one massive
14:14
bubble when your tea is ready
14:16
that's so great that is brilliant i was
14:18
listening to a podcast the other day
14:19
called smart enough to know better which
14:21
is an excellent podcast really
14:22
interesting um
14:23
and they were actually talking about a
14:25
guy who tries to break records for
14:26
blowing the biggest bubbles
14:28
and he was saying once a bubble goes
14:30
above five
14:31
meters in diameter if you puncture it it
14:33
no longer pops
14:35
it tears isn't that cool so if you blow
14:37
a gigantic soap bubble
14:39
it won't pop anywhere we in edinburgh
14:41
this year we were after a show called
14:42
the amazing bubble man
14:44
it's a children's show and it was
14:45
unbelievably good we
14:47
were watching a bit of it through the
14:48
curtains did you feel a bit like a let
14:50
down after it yeah
14:51
we couldn't follow it but thankfully all
14:53
the all his audience were four-year-olds
14:54
and all our audience were not
14:55
four-year-olds so it was all right
14:56
but oh man it was so so you know he
14:59
fills a bubble with smoke
15:00
yeah he sort of injects a bubble
15:02
hypodermically and then pumps smoke into
15:04
it and it floats up and when it pops it
15:05
produces this weird
15:07
cloud of smoke he has a sword that can
15:10
sort of slice bubbles in two or you
15:13
don't actually need a sword to do that
15:14
so you can get implemented far less
15:17
difficult to obtain we'll do the same
15:18
that's true it's yeah it's fascinating
15:20
he has a whole and he
15:21
sort of puts bubbles on people you put
15:23
bubbles along the arm of a child for
15:25
example
15:26
because they don't have hair on their
15:28
arm but for an adult with more hair on
15:29
their arm
15:29
you can't do that because it doesn't
15:30
quite work so yeah all sorts of very
15:32
interesting stuff what about plug for
15:34
him
15:34
i know i know you can't remember his
15:36
name he doesn't need it he's hugely
15:38
successful
15:42
the business about how the best way to
15:43
kill a lobster oh yeah
15:45
and whether because there's a there's
15:46
sharply divided opinion between
15:48
either lobsters put them in cold water
15:52
and bringing up some heat
15:53
gradually and then they sort of go to
15:56
sleep and then
15:57
they're anesthetized and die without
15:59
knowing it or else you plunge them into
16:01
boiling water
16:01
and that kills them instantly or you
16:04
stab them in the back
16:06
or you don't kill them at all which is
16:07
the peta peter position
16:09
if you do the peta method and don't kill
16:11
them they're going to be very feisty on
16:13
the plate
16:13
that's the only problem they are they
16:15
are yeah
16:17
we do know what happens if you boil a
16:18
human alive though because there's a
16:19
description
16:20
of one oh reign of henry viii uh
16:23
a cook called richard roose who poisoned
16:26
the bishop of rochester
16:28
and he got caught and he thought he said
16:30
it's a joke
16:31
i just i gave him a purgatory if it's
16:33
just a joke bit funny you know give him
16:34
a granny tummy
16:35
but henry viii was incensed and actually
16:37
put an act of attender out against him
16:39
so he could be
16:40
convicted without trial then persuaded
16:42
the parliament to make
16:44
poisoning an act of treason then when he
16:46
thought it couldn't get any worse
16:47
decided the penalty for poisoning would
16:49
be being boiled alive
16:51
so poor old richard ruse who apparently
16:53
had just had a bit of a joke with his
16:54
employer
16:55
ended up being boiled alive and there's
16:58
a
16:59
someone who was actually watched said he
17:01
roared mighty loud and diverse women who
17:03
were big with child did feel sick at the
17:05
sight of what they saw
17:06
and were carried away half dead and
17:08
other men and women did not seem
17:09
frightened by the boiling alive
17:11
but would prefer to see the headsman at
17:13
his work
17:14
as in the what the executioner
17:22
did that catch on as a means of
17:24
execution or is he is he unique
17:25
uh no there are a few others there were
17:27
actually a few before it's often said
17:28
that henry viii invented boiling alive
17:30
they're actually in scotland there are a
17:31
few
17:32
there was a laird uh somewhat earlier
17:35
who's uh
17:36
upset some of his nobles by apparently
17:37
being too harsh with them
17:39
and they got together and threw him in a
17:40
kettle and apparently then to prove they
17:42
were all in it together
17:44
they all took a glass of the of the stew
17:47
that they made by boiling their layered
17:49
alive and drank it
17:51
do you guys know about the world's
17:52
deepest swimming pool i don't know about
17:54
the world
17:57
there's not actually that much to say
17:58
about it except that i like it because
17:59
it's called the deep joy
18:01
um which sounds like a quote from one of
18:02
samuel peeps favorites um
18:04
but i think this is in belgium and you
18:06
can walk through a tunnel at the bottom
18:07
of it and it's the depth of nine or ten
18:09
double
18:10
decker buses i think that's really cool
18:11
here's my question though but what's the
18:13
point of having a deep end at all
18:15
in the swimming pool why don't you just
18:17
make it all sort of a normal
18:19
height that's annoying you want to dive
18:20
down well not much particularly
18:22
i mean the thing is what you want to do
18:23
is stand on your hands and have your
18:24
feet sticking out don't you
18:26
you could do that a shallow flash some
18:27
of us like to test out all shadows
18:29
otherwise you had with all the other
18:30
noobs up the shallow end
18:31
when you could have the whole pool of
18:33
people standing upside down
18:35
flash has been forcibly removed from
18:36
many public pools
18:39
the only point of having if you're going
18:40
to do a very steep vertical dive
18:44
yeah yeah otherwise i guess i guess they
18:46
have to build that into the plans for
18:47
the pool because they in case someone
18:49
misses the sign saying please do not do
18:50
a steep vertical dive because
18:52
following the advice of piers fletcher
18:53
we have made the entire pool a depth of
18:55
only a meter in 30. feel free to stand
18:57
on your head
18:58
it makes it really difficult to boil the
19:00
water you know because you get so much
19:01
more
19:08
okay time for fact number three and that
19:11
is
19:11
my facts and this is that in wales the
19:14
size of your garden
19:15
used to be determined by how far you
19:17
could throw an axe
19:19
and so this is a uh tradition in wales
19:21
that apparently is very well known and
19:23
i went to the trouble because i don't
19:24
want to offend anyone of looking up how
19:26
you pronounce it and it's called t
19:28
unos which means one night house and it
19:31
was this tradition that apparently dates
19:33
back to the middle ages according to
19:35
welsh folklore
19:36
which is that if you could build a house
19:38
within a night
19:39
and have a fire burning in the hearth
19:40
and smoke coming out the chimney by the
19:42
morning
19:42
then you own that property and then the
19:45
rule was that you could stand at each of
19:47
the four corners of your house
19:48
and throw an axe and the distance that
19:50
you threw it marked out the boundaries
19:52
of your property and that's what you
19:54
owned
19:54
and they continued doing this up until
19:56
uh the 19th century
19:57
it was never legally i've never found a
19:59
law yeah it
20:00
was never a legal thing i think people
20:02
just did it yeah quite a big garden
20:04
oh no no i'm hugely relieved i didn't
20:06
live in pre-19th century wells because i
20:07
would have had the smallest garden of
20:09
all of my neighbors
20:10
there's an actual example of a house
20:12
which is well in fact there's several
20:13
but there's one in particular it's
20:13
supposed to be built that way do you
20:15
know about this is the snow doughnut
20:16
snowdonia one yes this is where because
20:18
i went
20:18
on holiday the ugly house yeah i was in
20:20
wales last week so
20:21
saw it and found about out about this
20:23
thing in an old book but yeah there is
20:25
this house in snowdonia called the ugly
20:26
house which is actually really
20:27
attractive
20:28
now in a sort of tumble downy sort of
20:30
way but
20:31
it looks like something out of hansel
20:33
and gretel or something and i think that
20:34
was made by two brothers in the 15th
20:37
century
20:38
was it was that the legend that's the
20:39
legend but apparently they think it's
20:40
more likely to be in 19th century
20:41
cottage
20:42
yeah sounds more likely the other thing
20:44
is hill which is the word
20:46
they translate as ugly it really doesn't
20:47
mean ugly and well she means rugged
20:49
oh really much nicer it does look rugged
20:52
yeah yeah so well a load of the houses
20:55
the the
20:55
houses were obviously not very good
20:58
because they've been built in a night
20:59
so a lot of them were torn down but then
21:02
they were replaced later on by more
21:03
modern cottages on the same site
21:05
i just nip into your garden build a shed
21:07
overnight light a fire in it throw me
21:09
axe and you wake up in the morning to
21:10
find that i own half your garden
21:12
and then later i build a very nice house
21:14
on there a nice conservatory on the side
21:16
and then there's a swimming pool in
21:16
place of my house when i've gone out
21:18
yeah look it happened
21:19
i'd welcome you justin um come on i was
21:22
just gonna say you see it might
21:24
it might not be a law but you can see
21:25
how it's the kind of thing that people
21:27
would believe
21:27
or at least still talk about in the pub
21:29
apparently you know if you do this and
21:31
then they can say let's do it and they
21:32
go out and they do it and everyone will
21:33
have a laugh and then they see if they
21:35
can get away with it
21:36
penn's everyone notices i suppose isn't
21:37
it really i think there is a law of
21:38
adverse possession
21:40
in the uk which changed in 2012 but
21:42
still exists whereby if
21:44
it's called squatters rights it's sort
21:45
of the shorthand for it and if you
21:47
own a piece of land and act like the
21:49
proprietor of it for long enough
21:51
then um then it can become your land do
21:54
you have to be in it for seven years or
21:55
something
21:58
someone else's house if it's their home
22:00
and then wait for the process
22:01
you know have them appeal to the courts
22:03
you can immediately be chucked out for
22:04
that now that's good
22:05
you could even uh create your own
22:07
private beach because you know most of
22:09
the
22:09
fall land in britain is owned by the
22:10
crown that's the bit between
22:12
sort of midway between the neap and the
22:14
spring high tide mark and the ocean
22:16
is owned by the crown but if you wanted
22:18
your own beach there were just a couple
22:20
of simple things you have to do find a
22:21
nice quiet beach somewhere
22:23
put up a sign saying private keep out as
22:25
you often see on beaches actually even
22:27
though they're not
22:28
you could put up a little fence don't
22:30
have to but it's nice to blow up your
22:31
fence just show that you're caring for
22:32
the land
22:33
roll up your trousers take your socks
22:34
off go for a paddle and all you have to
22:36
do is stay there for 60 years and the
22:39
beach is yours
22:40
60 years 60 years of paddling and the
22:42
beach is yours
22:43
you know how many olympic swimming pools
22:45
you could boil in that time
22:48
you don't actually have to be literally
22:49
on the beach all that time and i do
22:51
wonder if those people who put up
22:52
private beach signs
22:53
are actually waiting for 60 years to
22:55
perform to then say they now own the
22:57
foreshore
22:57
i wouldn't have announced to do this
22:58
before the age of let's say 20. so
23:00
that's you
23:01
by the age of 80 you'll have a beach
23:03
it's a gift for the grandchildren
23:05
it's like planting for sure
23:08
yeah yeah so this thing about throwing a
23:10
thing and seeing how far it lands i'm i
23:12
looked into it and i found a book
23:14
called the history of the germanic
23:16
empire vol 3 which was published in 1835
23:18
best volume it's an absolute cracker and
23:21
it describes
23:22
a load of these customs so um a shepherd
23:25
could see how far he could drive his
23:26
flock
23:27
into someone else's forest by throwing
23:29
his crook
23:31
as far as he could and then wherever it
23:33
lands you can drive your sheep in that
23:34
far
23:35
or a woodcutter could cut wood according
23:37
to how far he could throw his axe
23:39
could you only throw it once or i don't
23:40
know the the history of the germanic
23:42
empire vol 3 is pretty sketchy on
23:44
details
23:45
but i just found this other custom which
23:48
i
23:48
thought i had to share with you which is
23:50
if you killed someone else's dog
23:52
to make restitution to them what you had
23:54
to do is hang it up by the tail with its
23:56
nose just
23:57
touching the ground and then you had to
23:58
cover it with wheat so it was completely
24:00
invisible so you completely cover the
24:02
whole dog with wheat
24:03
and then that heap of wheat is the
24:05
compensation
24:06
that's due to the person whose dog would
24:08
kill people covered in dog carcass
24:10
it's delicious if it's a toy dog then
24:13
you're fine
24:14
you're fine that's just a small loaf of
24:15
bread you shove it into and you're
24:16
sorted
24:17
the thing about throwing the axe the way
24:18
they um found out what how much your
24:20
territorial waters were internationally
24:22
were how far you could fire a cannon
24:24
back in the day and not even all that
24:26
long ago
24:28
under international law um until the
24:30
mid-20th century territorial waters
24:31
would decide it were
24:33
it was uh three nautical miles which was
24:35
the length of a cannon sure no way
24:36
the idea was that that was the distance
24:38
that you could dominate the city
24:39
defensible resistance you could fire a
24:41
cannon
24:41
three miles yeah three nautical miles
24:45
spain claimed six nautical miles but
24:47
that was unusual and
24:48
the united kingdom only extended from
24:50
three miles to twelve in 1987.
24:53
oh really well when we suddenly got a
24:54
cannon upgrade
24:56
these days you've got cruise missiles
24:57
which can go quite a long way so you
24:59
could make a pretty good claim
25:00
so i think that doesn't work anymore
25:02
that's how it was wow that's interesting
25:04
so it's actually such a and you
25:05
presumably these welsh guys were saying
25:06
well i can defend this
25:08
house as far as i can throw this act
25:11
but then you have to go out and get the
25:12
axe from limitless still a big
25:15
deal in in north wales is it yeah
25:17
apparently in fact
25:18
here's the interesting thing at this
25:19
moment there is a thing taking place
25:21
which is called the good life experience
25:24
of the hawaiian estate in north wales
25:25
and
25:26
keris matthews runs an annual axe
25:28
throwing competition there
25:30
i know who that is yeah you know
25:34
catatonia yeah and and the thing is it's
25:36
keras matthews and some other people but
25:37
she's you know what i've heard of so
25:39
it's scary
25:40
well it's becoming a trend here and
25:42
james harkin formerly of this podcast
25:44
has done axe throwing with his wife
25:46
polina and said it was the best one he's
25:47
ever had
25:48
i think there's one in chicago the best
25:50
fight he lives a quiet life he should
25:51
read peeps
25:52
[Laughter]
25:53
but they are still apparently uh people
25:55
still use tomahawks in a military
25:58
sense in certain wars this is true
26:00
cruise missiles are called top hawks
26:03
so i think in the korean war people
26:06
actually brought throwing axes as part
26:08
of their gear the americans brought
26:09
throwing axes
26:10
here's the thing about tomahawks which i
26:11
did not know is that loads of native
26:13
american tomahawks had hollow
26:15
handles and could be used uh to smoke
26:18
through
26:18
but basically if you know some native
26:20
americans met uh some white settlers it
26:22
could go one of two ways
26:24
you use the axe either to hit them or
26:26
you sort of you come to some sort of
26:28
agreement and then you smoke together to
26:30
seal the deal that's amazing in the film
26:32
he's becoming
26:33
you see the shadow of this shape and be
26:34
holding it up and then you cut it
26:40
um this is so random but i discovered
26:43
since we're talking about america and
26:44
wales that the first welsh settler in
26:46
america was called howell powell
26:48
howell powell i like that but anyway i
26:50
was actually going to talk about um
26:52
squashing in america generally in 2004 a
26:55
woman in georgia came home from a
26:56
holiday
26:57
and there was a car in her drive and all
27:00
the lights were on in her house and so
27:01
she went into her house
27:02
and there was a stranger in there a
27:05
woman who was
27:06
wearing all this woman's clothes she
27:08
changed all her utility bills
27:09
into her name she'd installed a washing
27:11
machine and she'd installed a dryer and
27:13
she'd moved her dog in and this woman
27:16
had just moved in pretended to be her so
27:17
the lady arrived home said get out of my
27:19
house and we have no idea why
27:21
she did that she'd ripped out a carpet
27:23
she didn't like how one room was painted
27:24
so she repainted what happened
27:26
she went to prison what the which one
27:28
did
27:29
i know that's a film isn't it
27:36
that's a good tele format is who
27:38
actually owns the house
27:40
and you get the two claimants and you
27:41
have to ask them questions about where
27:43
are these switches if a light goes yeah
27:46
the trip switches
27:47
squatting through the keyhole yeah who
27:49
would squat in a house like this
27:55
[Music]
27:58
okay we should move on to our final fact
28:00
and that is from andy my fact is that
28:02
some caterpillars find new friends by
28:04
drumming on their anuses
28:06
work on me yeah uh so this actually this
28:09
fact was sent in by somebody
28:10
uh by gorish trawler so thank you very
28:12
much for sending us in i liked it so
28:14
much
28:15
this is the masked birch caterpillar and
28:18
it lives on birch leaves and it spins
28:19
cocoons out of silk
28:20
but sometimes they need a lot of
28:23
caterpillars to join in
28:24
the silk cocoon uh ceremony and maintain
28:27
their hiding place so
28:28
what they do is they do anal drumming so
28:30
they bang their anuses on the ground
28:32
they drum their anus on the leaf
28:33
and it summons the other caterpillars
28:36
and they but they're very versatile
28:37
because also if they have rivals and
28:38
they want to scare a rival away
28:40
sometimes then they will do anal
28:42
scraping that's different from anal
28:44
drumming
28:44
oh yeah as we all know um so
28:48
they have a thing called an anal or um
28:51
and uh
28:52
what not a choice i want to be presented
28:56
with
28:58
if you don't have a very strong musical
28:59
ear as a caterpillar and you
29:01
misinterpret the
29:02
come hither for the trouble please then
29:05
yeah you're really in trouble
29:06
yeah well the thing is that there's a
29:09
recording of this thing online
29:10
uh who's you found that but there's the
29:12
woman who researches it says you can't
29:13
really hear it but
29:14
if you get a laser vibrometer you hear
29:16
this crazy rumbling sound
29:18
they actually sound like lions tiny
29:20
lions she's called
29:21
jane yak this researcher and she says
29:23
they talk to themselves with their asses
29:25
as well talking with their butts even
29:27
when they were alone when feeding they
29:28
go chomp chomp chomp anal scrape
29:30
chop chop chop nothing unusual about
29:33
that
29:34
um i don't get invited to many dinner
29:36
parties
29:38
the alcon blue caterpillar also makes a
29:40
scraping noise but not for other
29:42
caterpillars
29:43
it makes a scraping noise that um red
29:45
ants mistake for a queen red ant
29:48
and it releases a sort of a chemical
29:50
that smells like them as well
29:52
so the red ants then take the
29:53
caterpillar into their ant hill
29:55
kick out the actual queen ant the
29:57
caterpillar sits there eating the larvae
29:59
to which the ants don't seem at all
30:01
bothered because it smells like a queen
30:02
it looks like
30:03
it doesn't look good but it smells like
30:04
we know it's making a queen sort of
30:06
noise
30:07
and right up until the moment when it
30:08
pupates and it stays in there protected
30:10
by the ants then it
30:11
bursts out at which point all the ants
30:12
go wait a minute
30:14
because there's a butterfly in the
30:15
middle of their anthill which is unusual
30:17
yeah but they're covered in really loose
30:18
scales when they
30:20
come out so the ants make a grab for it
30:21
and all the scales just come off and it
30:23
just climbs out and flies away oh
30:24
brilliant that's amazing brilliant is
30:27
our own queen
30:28
actually the queen or is she just an
30:30
enormous caterpillar imagine if one year
30:32
for the state opening of parliament she
30:33
comes out and she seems to be all
30:34
covered in these loose scales
30:36
what's going on do you know they have
30:39
carnivorous
30:40
uh caterpillars in hawaii what do they
30:43
eat
30:44
snails they trap the snail in the silken
30:46
noose and then they eat it alive because
30:48
they
30:49
the snail can't move and they they
30:51
caterpillar sort of
30:52
goes into the hole the front door as it
30:54
were and the snail
30:55
tries to withdraw further and further
30:57
into its own shell and then it runs out
30:58
of space and then gets eaten alive
31:00
and eat the whole thing that's a rough
31:02
way to go back into a corner
31:04
yeah did you discover this he said
31:05
called daniel rubinoff he said
31:07
almost all insects are predators but to
31:09
find a caterpillar going after snails a
31:11
real shock
31:12
it's like finding a wolf diving for
31:14
clams
31:16
well we'll have to take his word with
31:17
that i suppose because he's the expert
31:19
that would be a shark that would be if i
31:21
was a snail i would have a trapdoor
31:22
in the back of my shell or a panic room
31:25
which
31:26
yes marine shells do they have an
31:27
aperculum they have a little
31:29
trapdoor they can close up their shell
31:31
speaking of the words
31:32
backdoor oh no i have a fact about
31:35
because there's a fact it's about anal
31:37
drumming
31:37
i have a fact about the giant california
31:40
sea cucumber
31:41
okay this is a lovely organism lives out
31:43
lives on the in the ocean
31:44
and it uses its anus as a mouth in spite
31:48
of already
31:48
having a mouth what does it use its
31:52
mouth for well it uses its mouth as a
31:53
mouth
31:54
and very greasy but then when there's
31:55
food around it sort of oh i'll have a
31:57
bit of a bit of my bumps
31:59
why not yeah it has a series of tubes
32:02
which go
32:03
up from its bottom and it gets water in
32:05
through those tubes and it
32:06
sucks the oxygen out of the water that's
32:08
how it gets its oxygen
32:09
but it also has these blood vessels and
32:11
they found that food has been making its
32:13
way
32:14
through these blood vessels from the
32:15
bottom so that's how they their food
32:17
brilliant um on anuses actually i was
32:19
reading about scorpions anuses
32:21
and um scorpions sometimes lose their
32:24
anuses
32:24
in uh you know what some creatures do
32:28
automate yes but the problem with
32:30
scorpions these particular scorpions is
32:32
that they commit
32:33
autototomy so if you threaten them from
32:35
behind then they
32:36
drop their tail off but their anus is at
32:38
the end of their tail
32:39
so once they've done that they can no
32:41
longer defecate um
32:42
and so sting or sting indeed so they
32:45
just wave around
32:46
uh randomly a little but in fact the guy
32:48
who discovered this uh a guy called
32:50
martoni said that
32:51
once it had lost its tail he could see
32:53
the buildup of faecal matter
32:55
in the back of it they got a photograph
32:57
of it haven't they yeah yeah
32:58
so they they and they can't grow it back
33:00
they can't go back the thing is they can
33:02
breed
33:03
in the before they dive see what i mean
33:05
it takes them so long to die that
33:07
they've got they can bring up a family
33:09
and pay the school fees
33:10
so it's no problem it's not a good
33:11
chance it's not a good job
33:14
it's like losing your hair you can but
33:17
you can still breed before you die yeah
33:19
in principle there is a tiny species of
33:23
jaw worm which doesn't have a common
33:24
name called haplonathia which has a
33:26
transient anus
33:28
most of the time it doesn't have a
33:29
bottom and it eats things and when it
33:31
needs a bottom
33:32
a bottom appears for a while it uses the
33:35
bottom
33:36
and then the bottom goes away again
33:38
that's so useful
33:39
transient anus think how useful that
33:41
would be i can imagine supermodels
33:43
wanting to invest in that sort of thing
33:44
because an anus is not actually that
33:45
appealing uh body part
33:48
i know they say a lot of things would be
33:49
a good name for a band but transient
33:51
anus would be a fantastic name for a
33:53
band
33:54
mapani worms the larvae of the emperor
33:57
moth
33:58
it said in the thing i read commonly
34:00
eaten in africa africa is always used to
34:02
mean just this like abroad
34:04
and you eat it by squeezing it like a
34:07
tube of toothpaste
34:08
and then giving a quick flick of the
34:10
wrist to expel the slimy green contents
34:12
of the gut and it's a
34:14
nutritious snack and there's a bloke who
34:16
was called a gatwick
34:17
with a big four sacks of these
34:21
um things which complicated and
34:22
destroyed and the customs said they were
34:24
worth 40
34:25
000 pounds what wow i know but i looked
34:28
up the cost and you could buy 40 grand
34:29
tin for 16 pounds 99 online
34:32
which means that if it really was 40
34:34
grand's worth this is in 2013.
34:36
it must he must have been carrying the
34:38
same weight as a baby elephant i saw
34:40
that i think it was about 100 kilos
34:41
and he claimed that they were for
34:43
personal consumption
34:47
how is he getting that much into uh into
34:49
the luggage
34:50
you just pack your backpack really
34:52
densely you can you can get away with a
34:53
lot you cannot squeeze that into one of
34:55
those tiny little wire containers at the
34:57
easyjet check-in well he didn't
34:59
i don't you may not have been hand
35:00
luggage this was an unusual seizure but
35:03
the vigilance of our officers have
35:04
stopped these dried incidents from
35:07
entering the uk hooray and possibly
35:09
posing a risk to our food chain
35:12
ingrid smith spokesman for the uk border
35:15
agency i love the idea that you need
35:16
vigilance to spot
35:17
a hundred kilos of dried caterpillars in
35:20
sacks
35:27
okay that's all of our facts today if

01:06
[Music]
01:07
hi everybody welcome back to no such
01:09
thing as a fish a weekly podcast coming
01:11
to you from the qi offices in covent
01:13
garden
01:14
my name is andrew hunter murray and i'm
01:16
sitting here with anna tajinski
01:18
james harkin and anne miller and once
01:20
again we have gathered around the
01:21
microphones with our four favorite facts
01:23
not from the last seven days from our
01:25
new book oh my goodness we've written a
01:27
book
01:28
it's called one three four two q i facts
01:31
to leave you flabbergasted and it is out
01:34
now
01:34
to celebrate that and plug the book we
01:37
have each brought our favorite fact
01:39
from the book and starting in no
01:41
particular order we begin
01:42
with james okay my fact is
01:46
that four-year-old mice are less common
01:49
than 100 year old humans nice
01:53
mind you all 100 year old humans are
01:55
very posh aren't they so
01:57
ah i see it's a play on the word comment
02:01
i don't know how you class a mouse
02:03
though what do you mean
02:06
do
02:12
so yeah this is just simply a fact that
02:14
mice don't live very long
02:16
yeah it's unbelievable that they're so
02:18
short-lived i know it's not
02:19
extraordinary
02:20
they're tiny that's interesting what you
02:21
say andy because you're
02:23
equating smallness with um
02:26
lack of longevity um do you think that's
02:29
true in general
02:30
no i guess because there are there's
02:31
multiple tortoises
02:33
mollusks tardigrades yeah true all right
02:36
i take it all back
02:37
parrots bigger than a tardy but smaller
02:40
than a pensioner
02:41
they're quite small they're bigger than
02:42
a mouse so they live a long time parrots
02:44
oh yeah
02:45
yeah there's one parrot called charlie
02:47
the parrot whose own acclaim
02:48
since he's 117 and used to belong to
02:50
winston churchill
02:51
but um what i like is everyone's looked
02:53
into this and so mr oram who owns him
02:56
now says his father-in-law
02:57
sold him to churchill in 1937 and then
03:00
got him back when churchill died
03:02
and the churchill family and all
03:03
historians have questioned this and say
03:05
they can't find
03:06
any evidence that churchill owned a
03:07
parrot and i would have just thought
03:09
like obviously we'd know if churchill
03:11
had a pet parrot right yeah
03:13
no i don't think we would because do you
03:15
remember there was that thing when
03:15
frobies came out and they were banned
03:17
from government offices because they
03:18
could repeat things
03:19
so if he had a pirate he would have to
03:21
be an illegal because he might repeat
03:22
all the secrets
03:23
you couldn't tell anyone that you had a
03:24
powerful kill the parrot
03:27
churchill had a secret parrot is what
03:29
we're saying this is the greatest
03:30
conspiracy fact
03:32
i've ever heard um so the world's oldest
03:35
mouse
03:35
um which is an article about whom i
03:38
found this fact
03:39
is called yoda and yoda celebrated his
03:42
fourth birthday on april the 10th
03:45
yeah and he got to the age of four and
03:46
this is the quote in a pathogen-free
03:48
rest home for geriatric mice
03:51
and he had a cage mate called princess
03:53
leia um and i said this
03:55
i mentioned this to dan uh who was
03:57
sitting in the room when i was doing my
03:58
research earlier and down
03:59
very dismissively said they didn't even
04:01
meet
04:04
uh so that yoda basically if you're four
04:07
years old as a mouse that's the
04:08
equivalence of 136 in human years
04:12
very old yeah well it's older than any
04:14
humans ever been
04:15
yeah so well done mice they've beaten us
04:18
in a way
04:19
sort of we've definitely beaten them
04:21
it's weird because they're doing a lot
04:22
of experiments into
04:23
how to make mice live longer in the hope
04:25
that we can then make humans live longer
04:26
the same way and one thing that does
04:28
work is
04:28
calorie restricted diets um that they
04:31
just live longer when you give them less
04:33
calories
04:33
but lots of mice in cages are fed a diet
04:37
which is almost exclusively starch and
04:38
sugar
04:39
it's like feeding someone donuts
04:41
basically and expecting them to get to a
04:42
ripe old age
04:43
although they i mean when they eat in
04:44
the wild they live less long than when
04:46
they're in captivity and they eat more
04:47
than starch and sugar in the wild
04:48
presumably i guess the wild is a
04:50
less easy habitat to get to an old age
04:53
in because it's
04:54
you know you're outdoors and you're
04:55
exposed to the elements slightly less
04:56
than a pathogen-free rest home
04:59
yeah um there was a guy already before
05:02
last week who was saying that domestic
05:03
cats should all be euthanized and no one
05:05
should be allowed them because they
05:06
caused such devastation to the bird
05:07
population yeah
05:09
yeah um he's very very angry they kill
05:12
lots of small other small animals and i
05:13
think i've heard that especially in
05:15
australia they're trying to
05:16
you know get rid of cats i think they've
05:19
destroyed something like 65 bird species
05:21
in the last 50 years oh there's quite a
05:24
lot of species to have got rid of yeah
05:26
yeah i was looking at a research lab
05:28
called the jackson lab which i think
05:29
this one was in maine
05:31
and they had mice
05:34
who they said were four and a half have
05:37
i written that down well they must be
05:38
three and a half
05:39
if this is the oldest but they well they
05:42
had mine so they said before and a half
05:44
which i said is over twice the life
05:45
expectancy and i quite like this quote
05:47
so the researcher who's working with the
05:49
most closely said
05:50
the mice are two girls and she's become
05:52
really really attached to them so she
05:53
totally loves them now and she treats
05:55
them really really well
05:56
and she says we move them to a new cage
05:58
and we take care when we pick them up to
06:00
cup them in our hands rather than pick
06:01
them up by the tail with the forceps
06:04
it's the luxury mice yeah it's the level
06:06
of extreme care and attention they get
06:08
my friend told me that because rabbits
06:10
are natural prey every time you pick up
06:12
a rabbit it thinks it's about to be
06:13
eaten so it's really stressful for
06:14
rabbits to be handled
06:15
that's why you pick them up really
06:16
gently like go down to them because
06:17
otherwise you think you're picking up
06:19
for a hug it thinks
06:20
yeah that's why they're complete
06:21
bastards when you pick them up it's
06:23
terrible i don't suppose any animals
06:24
really think
06:25
when you pick them up that they're going
06:26
to get a hug
06:28
they should be consistently pleasantly
06:30
surprised in that case
06:32
so ungrateful um have you guys heard of
06:34
the black six
06:35
c57bl six slash six
06:39
yeah um
06:42
this is so cool this is a particular
06:44
kind of mouse which gets used
06:46
in almost all experiments it's like the
06:49
standard currency of mouse experiments
06:51
um five
06:52
in six american research mice are this
06:54
one very particular strain
06:56
uh it was created in 1921 i read a huge
06:59
thing there's a huge article on slate
07:00
about them
07:01
uh created in 1921 when a mouse
07:03
codenamed c52
07:04
mounted one called c57 and deposited its
07:07
semen in her reproductive tract with a
07:09
waxy plug
07:10
that's a very sexy article you've been
07:12
reading
07:14
and so that basically almost all
07:16
experiments in america are on mice
07:17
i don't know them and most experiments
07:19
on animals are done on mice so it's
07:21
you know most of most of them um and
07:23
they're but the
07:24
problem is we think that they're kind of
07:26
standard mice and they're treated as
07:27
such in experiments
07:29
but they're really unusual they all
07:31
think they're special
07:32
well no they are special this is the
07:33
interesting thing because they are
07:35
um they're susceptible to morphine
07:37
addiction and they like alcohol
07:39
and um and that's how special does it
07:41
normal
07:42
i'm afraid
07:47
but they're exceptional in their pain
07:48
responses and other things like this so
07:50
actually
07:50
there's no such thing as a perfect
07:52
average mouse to experiment on
07:54
that's really interesting because what
07:55
you lose by having the mouse
07:58
being one kind you gain because all your
08:00
experiments are controlled by the same
08:02
kind of mice
08:02
exactly yeah that's true yeah yeah um
08:05
and
08:06
it one thing it does it does mouse
08:07
barbering behavior
08:09
so cutting nice hair yeah styles this is
08:12
where you have several different mice in
08:13
the same case the dominant mouse will
08:15
selectively remove hair
08:17
from its cage mates to show that it's in
08:19
charge
08:21
so all the all the subordinates are
08:22
going around little bold patches on them
08:24
really oh wow to mark them out as his
08:27
slaves yeah actually speaking of my
08:29
stress you know mice are
08:30
more stressed around men than around
08:32
women and they've just discovered this
08:33
and they
08:34
think it's going to have to be
08:35
controlled for in future experiments
08:36
with mice do we know why
08:38
um so we assume it's because they have a
08:40
reaction to the testosterone so they
08:41
just have the same reaction as they do
08:42
to male mice and a male is often going
08:44
to be more bellicose
08:45
i suppose just maybe mice are just
08:47
ardent feminists and they get really
08:49
annoyed with the patriarchy it could be
08:50
that they definitely release
08:52
more of this stress hormone so they put
08:54
male researchers with
08:56
mice and their bodies course through
08:57
with all these hormones that they don't
08:59
have
08:59
when they have they're with females but
09:01
yeah it means in future when you're
09:02
doing experiments we need to control for
09:04
that because their bodies are behaving
09:05
completely differently depending on
09:06
who's working on them
09:07
women become more stressed when i
09:08
approach them than when another woman
09:10
approaches them yeah i've noticed that
09:11
does that make me a
09:12
mouse no no it makes you a researcher
09:16
oh it makes i don't think it works does
09:18
it
09:19
it's not just women though andy isn't
09:21
people become stressed when i approach
09:23
them
09:23
and mice actually did you say they've
09:26
made transparent mice
09:27
no um yeah they i mean no you you
09:30
obviously wouldn't see that they've made
09:31
transparent mice would you wherever the
09:33
transparent might oh no
09:34
it's okay they're still there come on
09:35
andy you can see a window
09:37
um can you can you you can see a window
09:40
frame
09:41
you can see where the window is i'm
09:42
looking at the window right now and i'm
09:43
doubting anna has these amazing guys
09:45
that can see the molecules
09:47
they can see reflections and little
09:49
little bits of grime okay these mice
09:52
they've got fingerprints all over them
09:54
yes
09:55
so scientists have made transparent mice
09:56
and this is on something they do to mice
09:58
after they've died
10:00
is they inject chemicals into them and
10:02
they pump these chemicals through their
10:03
blood vessels through their brain
10:04
through their spinal cords through all
10:06
their organs and it gets rid of
10:07
um hemi h-e-m-e which is the stuff in
10:10
hemoglobin
10:11
and that's what gives a lot of the stuff
10:12
in their body its color and other stuff
10:14
that's um
10:15
creating obstacles to the eyes and it
10:17
makes them completely transparent but it
10:19
means that we can
10:20
um study them much more easily because
10:22
usually when you're studying dead mices
10:24
organs let's say you've got a diabetic
10:25
mouse and you want to work out
10:28
how that works then you'd have to cut
10:30
the organs up and you could distort them
10:31
but
10:32
in this way you can just look at it from
10:33
the outside and see everything inside
10:34
there
10:35
sure would be more useful to have uh
10:37
transparent living mice i think
10:39
i know i think they're working on that
10:40
are they yeah didn't you find a thing in
10:43
in qa about putting windows and cows
10:46
yeah so they put these windows in cows
10:47
stomachs which means that
10:48
you can if a cow's got a stomach
10:50
infection you can just insert
10:51
whatever is needed to be inserted into
10:53
the cow's stomach to make its infection
10:55
better
10:55
that's very cool um other old animals
10:58
oh yeah greenland sharks yeah they're
11:01
really old they've recently found out
11:03
that they might live up to
11:04
around 400 years maybe even older um
11:08
they looked at some females 28 female
11:10
greenland sharks
11:12
and they worked out that the oldest one
11:14
was somewhere between 272 years old
11:17
and 512 years old
11:21
wow the greenland track where they
11:22
didn't know until quite recently how
11:23
long they actually lived they said
11:25
it could be anywhere between like 20 and
11:26
400 years and no one knew well
11:28
still it's anywhere between 272 and 512
11:31
which is quite a big discrepancy
11:34
1744 that that one would have been born
11:38
yeah if it was sure it's a shame they
11:40
couldn't have been born in a year where
11:42
one of us had a useful historical
11:43
reference to compare it to what was
11:45
1744. anyone got anything
11:47
um not top of my head uh so king one of
11:50
the king georges was on the throne
11:51
great thanks andy that's really good
11:54
imagine that
11:54
have you heard of claire hollingworth
11:56
claire hollingworth yeah no
11:58
no no um i was on the list of uh
12:02
wikipedia
12:03
centenarians basically they have all
12:04
these categories and they've got uh
12:06
you know sports people and they've got
12:07
artists and they've got scientists and
12:09
they've
12:09
and they've also got a miscellaneous
12:10
category absolutely yes please
12:12
um and claire hollingworth was the
12:15
journalist
12:16
who basically discovered the second
12:17
world war
12:19
um she was 27. wait wait how did you
12:21
discover the second world
12:23
war well she's she broke the story in
12:25
britain basically
12:26
um and when i say that um she was 27 she
12:30
was a brand new journalist and then she
12:31
had just met the editor of the telegraph
12:33
and said
12:34
when you hire me and why don't you send
12:35
me to poland so he
12:37
relented and sent her to poland and a
12:39
few days into her trip she was returning
12:41
to poland after a cross-border trip into
12:43
germany and she noticed all the
12:45
way along the road there were these big
12:46
uh screens of hessian up alongside the
12:48
road
12:49
and the wind blew one of them up and it
12:50
revealed loads of gentlemen
12:53
here we have loads of german tanks no
12:55
way did germany invade poland behind a
12:57
load of screams
13:00
and then the wind blew and they're like
13:01
oh damn it's very sweet
13:03
i've got away with that it's very
13:05
scooby-doo isn't it this is what
13:06
happened no it isn't it is
13:09
this was from the guardian i trust the
13:11
guardian has anyone checked whether
13:12
germany's invaded anywhere else recently
13:15
look for the hessian screens wait how i
13:18
have no idea how that's related to what
13:19
we're talking about centenarian she
13:21
lived to 100
13:21
sorry she's more common than a
13:25
four-year-old mouse
13:26
nice yeah centenarian so i was looking
13:29
up some things about aging
13:31
and how we can age better and so you
13:34
know people always go and look at
13:35
villages than towns that are full of
13:36
really really old people and so the
13:37
latest is a report in npr which looked
13:39
at the
13:40
village of akiaroli in italy and it has
13:43
300 people in it who are over 100 which
13:45
is a third of the population
13:47
of that village and so a doctor went
13:49
there and did a little study and noted
13:51
that there were two dietary habits and i
13:53
basically mentioned this so people can
13:54
take it on board and imitate it
13:56
he said that everyone ate anchovies at
13:58
every meal
13:59
and they had rosemary with everything
14:02
and that's the key
14:03
secret wow if you eat weird isn't it
14:05
because i wouldn't have
14:06
personally just wouldn't put those two
14:08
things together for every meal
14:10
they're having every meal anchovies and
14:12
rosemary look they're not enjoying the
14:14
taste james but it makes me live so long
14:16
but i like that but that's a solid bit
14:18
of advice i looked at these tips too and
14:20
they're brilliant because they always
14:21
contact each other and there's one
14:22
where um if you slept sleep for fewer
14:25
than six hours a night
14:26
you're four times likely to die but if
14:28
you sleep for
14:29
seven to eight hours thirty percent
14:31
higher chance of death which means you
14:32
need to sleep for about exactly six
14:34
hours according to these studies
14:35
or you're gonna die i mean you're gonna
14:37
die anyway probably gonna die anyway
14:38
is the problem i'm not talking about you
14:41
guys this one's wearing it said that for
14:42
every hour of tv you watch after the age
14:44
25 you knock off 22 minutes of your life
14:46
expectancy
14:48
what if you're watching an hour-long
14:49
documentary on how to extend your life
14:52
we call a paradox um i would do that for
14:56
quite a lot of tv shows
14:57
i would take that ahead what about
14:59
gogglebox absolutely
15:01
rollerbox is the best one to watch
15:02
because you get lots of tv in one show i
15:04
was going to say what if
15:05
if you're watching someone watching tv
15:07
is that 45 minutes
15:09
double penalty some more centenarians
15:11
just going back to what andy was saying
15:13
before
15:13
um my incredibly relevant story about
15:15
claire hollingworth
15:17
isn't that cool that's weird anyway
15:19
amazing uh emma morano
15:21
on moreno is the oldest person in the
15:23
world at the moment
15:24
she is the only person born in the 19th
15:27
century
15:27
who's still alive she's the oldest
15:30
italian
15:31
as well as the oldest of everyone what i
15:34
mean to say is she's italian
15:37
and she's the oldest from a tiny italian
15:39
village what a coincidence
15:41
um she credits her long life to her diet
15:44
of raw eggs and being single
15:46
i think what she means is she credits
15:48
being single to her diet
15:51
the oldest man is a guy called israel
15:53
cristal
15:54
and he's 45 years older than the state
15:57
of israel
15:58
wow great good one so it was named
16:02
after him no no no no
16:05
i was being very careful photologically
16:06
yeah
16:10
[Music]
16:14
okay it's time for fact number two and
16:16
that is anna
16:18
my fact this week is that the detective
16:20
agency that hunted butch cassidy
16:22
also worked for coca-cola yes i just i
16:25
just really loved this
16:26
um overlapping of its two roles so this
16:29
is a detective agency called the
16:30
pinkerton detective agency
16:32
and it was a very big deal in the 19th
16:34
century it was a bunch of detectives
16:36
were hired to hunt down all the all the
16:37
greats of the wild west so
16:39
they hunted butch and the sundance kid
16:41
they hunted jesse james for years
16:43
and also they were employed in 1916
16:47
by this guy called harold hirsch who
16:50
wanted to spy on other companies and
16:52
make sure they weren't stealing
16:53
coca-cola's trademark
16:54
because he was running coca-cola at the
16:56
time and yeah he sent them undercover
16:58
to soda fountains he's almost as
17:01
dangerous as going after butch
17:03
can you imagine that career step after
17:05
being in a shootout with a sundance kid
17:07
i'm going to send you to a soda fountain
17:09
undercover to collect samples
17:11
of coke and check there were a lot of
17:15
imitations i found a list of all the
17:16
companies
17:17
that they went after for using their
17:18
names do you want to hear something yeah
17:20
some of them are very close so
17:21
uh they went after a candy cola celery
17:23
cola coca-cola
17:25
coca-cola or with case uh cooler coke
17:27
with a c then okay
17:28
coco and cola hyphenated cola
17:32
yes it's a cola and koala coca-cola all
17:35
with caves is especially egregious
17:37
that's outrageous i saw coke k-o-k-e
17:40
and they also went after a company
17:42
called dope
17:44
yeah dope and coke yeah um they were
17:47
made by the same
17:48
manufacturer who'd actually been a
17:49
partner of the guy who went on to set up
17:52
coca-cola
17:52
but yeah they called it dope so the um
17:55
coca-cola company
17:56
sort of begged people it's advertising
17:58
not to refer to their drink as coke
18:00
because that made it much easier to copy
18:01
because so many drinks are called coke
18:03
but people still did call it coke as we
18:05
do but equally they called it dope
18:07
so you'd say you can have a cup of dope
18:08
and that was obviously a reference to
18:10
its
18:10
former cocaine content so people knew it
18:13
as the drink that had the drugs in it
18:14
it didn't have actual cocaine in it did
18:16
it it had the is it the coca leaves or
18:18
it had
18:19
yeah it had uh i think it had basically
18:22
cocaine in it
18:23
what was interesting was that when it
18:25
was taken out of coca-cola
18:27
at the turn of the century they still in
18:29
their advertising implied that it
18:31
contained cocaine because they still
18:32
wanted people to think they were going
18:33
to get that kick
18:34
and so they used to get in trouble and
18:36
there was a lawsuit filed against them
18:38
for implying that they drink contain
18:39
cocaine when outrageously it didn't
18:42
that's fantastic should we should we
18:44
also say who butch cassidy was
18:45
oh yeah oh yeah so butch cassidy for
18:48
those of you who
18:49
haven't seen one of the greatest films
18:50
i've made was a wild west
18:52
outlaw in the 1800s and he
18:56
conducted various train robberies he was
18:58
hunted by this pinkerton agency so in
18:59
butch castle in the sundance kid it's
19:01
these detectives who are always on their
19:02
tail
19:03
and eventually they drove them out of
19:04
america and they ended up in bolivia
19:07
and then there's lots of theories about
19:09
what happened to them so
19:10
it's assumed they were killed in a
19:12
shootout in bolivia and that's how the
19:14
film ends
19:15
certainly or actually you don't see them
19:16
die in the film do you
19:18
spoiler very much allowed
19:20
[Laughter]
19:21
sorry that is true um but yeah there are
19:24
lots of theories so apparently there was
19:25
a guy
19:26
called william t phillips who surfaced
19:29
in america
19:30
in 1908 or 1909
19:33
and he was recognized by a bunch of
19:34
people a bunch of policemen who chased
19:36
butch in the olden days and his
19:38
ex-girlfriend
19:39
and uh this guy's adopted son says it it
19:42
had always been accepted in the family
19:43
that he'd been butch cassidy and he even
19:45
wrote this manuscript in 1934
19:47
william t phillips saying this is what
19:49
happened to butch cassidy without saying
19:51
oh that's who i am
19:52
but saying butch cassidy got away at the
19:54
shootout the sundance kid was killed
19:56
and so there's little details that he
19:58
threw in as well it was really detailed
19:59
yes photography yeah yeah and he didn't
20:01
like 1934.
20:03
so so one of the former president of
20:05
bolivia uh
20:06
renee perrientos he actually
20:08
investigated
20:09
the idea that butch and sundance had
20:11
been killed in a shootout outside of
20:13
bolivian bank
20:14
as in he interviewed villagers
20:16
personally who had been
20:17
you know witnesses or nearly witnesses
20:19
and he checked out army files
20:20
and um i've got in my notes that he dug
20:22
up bodies i think actually he had bodies
20:24
dug up
20:26
but he eventually concluded that the
20:27
shootout story was a fabrication
20:29
did he yeah although there is a town in
20:32
bolivia that says this is the um
20:34
resting place or here lie butch cassidy
20:36
and the sundance kid don't they i think
20:37
it's called sam vicente
20:38
oh really what you would do for the
20:40
tourism wouldn't you you wouldn't say
20:42
got away from this place that's true did
20:45
you know that the movie was originally
20:46
called the sundance kid and butch
20:48
cassidy no way that's one of the worst
20:51
ever names for himself
20:53
it feels like that to us now doesn't it
20:55
yeah we'll never know if it would have
20:56
felt absolutely normal yeah
20:57
because paul newman was going to play
20:59
sundance that's right
21:01
but then they needed to switch that over
21:02
for some reason and then they had a
21:04
thing where oddly robert redford who
21:05
wasn't as big a star
21:06
was then going to be playing sundance
21:08
sundance was going to be first in the
21:09
name of the film
21:10
so then they said well we have to switch
21:12
the name of the film as well now that
21:13
doesn't make any sense sundance was the
21:15
protege
21:16
it would have been totally ridiculous
21:18
and not in accordance with the real
21:20
history of the thing
21:21
all right okay
21:24
um but yeah i think i said in a i might
21:26
have said before that he had a
21:27
lancastrian accent was it this
21:29
this might have been well his father and
21:32
mother both came from the north of
21:33
england
21:34
um and didn't move to america until
21:36
quite late on in life sounds great
21:38
oh yeah suddenly a won over well you
21:40
know people always say that i sound like
21:42
a real butch wild west and you really
21:45
remind me of paul newman so
21:47
yeah i don't know what he looks like but
21:49
i can only imagine
21:51
oh i mean he's the most attractive man
21:53
ever born i can see where you're coming
21:55
from now
21:55
[Laughter]
21:57
um the pinkerton detectives then do you
21:59
guys have stuff on that
22:00
uh their motto okay what was the motto
22:03
we never sleep
22:04
we never sleep and also we're
22:05
chronically exhausted
22:08
i read in one place that their logo was
22:10
a large black and white eye and that's
22:12
supposedly where the phrase private eye
22:14
comes from
22:14
yeah that's true do you know who
22:17
pinkerton was
22:18
he was a barrel maker so he's from from
22:21
scotland and living near chicago
22:23
one night he went to the woods to get
22:26
more wood for staves to make into
22:28
barrels
22:28
and he found the remains of a campsite
22:30
and he got suspicious and he went back
22:32
uh the following night and um he found a
22:34
group of counterfeiters making coins
22:36
and he got the gang arrested and
22:37
everyone said oh great job pinkton you
22:39
should investigate more of these
22:40
counterfeiting cases
22:41
and so he did he just started
22:42
investigating things and then set up
22:43
this enormous countrywide agency
22:45
so he had a scottish accent and cassidy
22:48
had a lancastrian accent
22:49
so if they ever do an audio play of this
22:51
then anna and i could play the two yeah
22:55
and i think there are agents already
22:58
phones ringing off the hook next door
23:01
but i think they were seen as a threat
23:02
the pinkertons by the end of the 19th
23:03
century and in fact were forced to
23:05
disband because they were so big and the
23:08
like government law enforcement
23:10
didn't like that they were posing this
23:12
threat so they were larger than the u.s
23:14
military by the by so they were larger
23:17
than the u.s
23:17
military by the 1890s they had 2 000
23:21
people full time on their books and they
23:22
had 30 000 reserves which is more men
23:24
than in the standing army
23:26
um for detective work i know yeah that's
23:29
amazing it is amazing they were all
23:30
reserves of course so
23:31
i don't know if they could have called
23:32
them all up full time no i think they
23:34
all had normal jobs probably most of the
23:35
time and then sort of spied on people as
23:37
a hobby at weekends as i said
23:38
i'm a pinkerton with notebooks yeah
23:42
do you know what pepsi was originally
23:43
called what brad's drink
23:48
was it just for brad it was just for
23:50
brad it wasn't it was caleb
23:51
bradham who was the inventor and it was
23:53
named uh it was like
23:55
coca-cola but it didn't have any coker
23:56
in it so i think it was casting around
23:58
desperately for another name
24:00
it's interesting that coca-cola these
24:02
days you could buy a bottle with the
24:04
word brad on it
24:05
that must really sting to pepsi yeah
24:08
that's a good point
24:09
ouch um freud said it cured his
24:12
depression and made him more sexually
24:14
active
24:14
cocaine coca-cola coca-cola yeah
24:18
they would say what would you like to
24:19
drink can you go [ __ ] coke
24:24
[Music]
24:27
okay it's time for fact number three
24:29
which is my fact which is that
24:31
you cannot get to the highest point of
24:33
mauritania
24:34
with a compass right well you can't get
24:37
to it you can't take your compass with
24:38
you
24:38
but you can't use a compass to navigate
24:40
to it even if you have a map
24:42
and your position because it's
24:44
completely made
24:46
of magnetite with the mountain which is
24:48
a natural magnet and as a result it'll
24:50
send your compass completely haywire
24:52
well you would think actually that no
24:54
matter where you were in the world if
24:56
you were close enough
24:57
it would point you towards this massive
24:59
mountain so actually it would work
25:00
really well
25:01
it wouldn't get you to the top would it
25:02
because it would just point directly
25:03
down at the mountain once you've got it
25:04
so it will get you to the base of the
25:05
mountain that's a really good point but
25:06
it would be perfect for getting to the
25:08
base of the mountain
25:09
and then it's useful i read this amazing
25:11
article this week i think it's on
25:12
cracked
25:13
about um like life-saving like tips and
25:15
things that you should know and they
25:16
said that if you get caught in an
25:18
avalanche everything is white so you can
25:19
you don't know which way that which
25:20
way's down so what you should do is you
25:21
should clear some space around your
25:22
mouth and spit
25:23
and whichever way the spit falls you
25:25
know which is down so you go down the
25:26
way do you really think you wouldn't
25:27
know which way was up and down because
25:29
you still have gravity you're still
25:31
going to be light-headed i sometimes get
25:33
that in bed do you
25:34
yeah you spit on your face you know the
25:36
thing where you're lying about it
25:37
momentarily you don't know which way
25:38
you're facing
25:40
sure but that's not really the same the
25:42
one way you can't breathe that's you're
25:43
facing into the pillow
25:44
[Laughter]
25:45
this mountain just to say is blue isn't
25:47
it yeah um
25:49
you could definitely find it without a
25:50
comfort i think it's a magnetite that
25:51
makes it blue so from above you can
25:53
identify it and there's this other
25:55
amazing thing in mauritania
25:57
which is 25 kilometers wide
26:00
but we didn't know it existed until we
26:03
had the ability to fly
26:05
this is the thing called the eye of the
26:06
sahara and it was hidden for many many
26:08
millennia it's uh this
26:10
beautiful swirling rock formation it's
26:13
these blue rocks and it looks like a big
26:14
bullseye but no one noticed it was there
26:16
until
26:17
i think it was when we went to space or
26:18
maybe when someone was flying over it
26:20
but from space they say it
26:21
it becomes particularly striking because
26:23
it's in the middle of the sahara so
26:24
there's nothing all around and this huge
26:26
blue swirl
26:27
gemini 4 in 1965 was when they
26:30
discovered it
26:30
was it yeah and we have no idea what it
26:32
is do we they thought it was from an
26:34
asteroid but now they don't think so and
26:35
now they're saying they think it's
26:37
seismic activity pushing this dome up
26:40
but
26:40
why is it a circle they have no idea
26:42
yeah some kind of uplift
26:44
um it does happen fairly often but not
26:46
very often in a circular
26:47
way yeah it's basically like heart
26:49
attack when you'd be doing the big one
26:50
and you wouldn't know what it was then
26:51
they pan out at the end and you see it
26:53
that's what they basically this is like
26:55
yeah that was great yeah bloody loved
26:57
that um mauritania is an
26:59
interesting country it's 90 sahara
27:01
desert it's only got 3.5 million people
27:04
and yet they have found the time to have
27:06
11 coups or attempted coups since 1960.
27:10
eleven coups that's a lot yeah yeah it's
27:12
a good selling number
27:13
and also they still have loads of
27:14
slavery the most coups is bolivia isn't
27:17
it i think
27:18
they've had loads they've had something
27:20
like 191 in their 190 year history
27:23
they've had certainly had one more coup
27:25
than they've had
27:26
well that'll be the cocaine
27:28
[Music]
27:28
[Laughter]
27:30
and there was a really weird incident
27:31
and did you see this 2012 in mauritania
27:33
where the president was
27:35
shot and then they said oh the
27:37
president's been shot by accident uh
27:39
it's fine it was a mistake and uh
27:41
just a bit of a mix-up and it's it's all
27:43
fine now and that may have been a
27:45
you know an aborted coup or something
27:46
like that really bizarre yeah
27:49
some things on highest points oh yeah um
27:51
there's a list of highest points of
27:53
countries on
27:54
uh wikipedia um murray hill is the
27:57
highest point of christmas island
27:59
that's nice i'm absolutely chuffed do
28:02
you think there are
28:03
many tennis fans who have accidentally
28:05
booked a trip to murray hill
28:08
uh the highest point of um the french
28:11
polynesian island territory of wallace
28:13
and futuna
28:14
is called mount puke no yeah yeah
28:17
p-u-k-e but it's pronounced phuket
28:19
yeah is one of the quietest places in
28:23
the world
28:24
it is so you've been there have you been
28:26
no i haven't but we
28:27
um james and i didn't think we were
28:29
researching loads and loads of countries
28:30
and james started the beginning of the
28:31
alphabet and i started at the end
28:32
and let's just say the afternoon a nice
28:34
point researching wallace of petunia
28:36
was pretty slow did you find the mount
28:38
puke thing
28:39
uh i think i did yeah i think it's not
28:41
much else i mean there are about two
28:43
things on there and one of them is a
28:44
place called
28:45
puke it's quite hard even for a
28:46
researcher of my limited ability to find
28:48
it you know is it even a volcano because
28:50
that might make sense
28:51
it's puking again it comes from the
28:55
polynesian word phuket
28:56
which means mound i see uh phuket phuket
28:59
means like an
29:00
uneven surface or something with lots of
29:02
mounds so does it mean mount
29:04
mountbound yeah do you think they get
29:06
annoyed with having to explain to every
29:07
single british lad tourist who comes
29:09
that it's pronounced phuket no there are
29:11
no
29:11
british lad tourists actually i'm just
29:14
looking up wallace and for tuna now
29:16
i'm just going to see what gems i came
29:18
up with
29:20
no one has opened this file since the
29:22
25th of october 2011. this is very
29:24
exciting this is like ancient history
29:26
little time capsule yeah do you want
29:28
another mountain fact from the book
29:29
while you're looking
29:30
uh so the highest point of canada was
29:32
only determined in 1992.
29:34
really really yeah weren't you before
29:36
then and
29:37
um when edmund hillary got got to the
29:40
top of everest he celebrated by having a
29:41
wii
29:42
that's how i usually celebrate actually
29:45
you've been celebrating a bit much
29:46
around the office recently
29:47
to be honest it's true it was my
29:48
birthday yesterday i thought you'd
29:51
appreciate it i left it on your desk and
29:52
everything
29:54
uh can we see what else is in that wall
29:56
is some fortuna guys
29:58
it's pretty thin groove population
30:02
uh population is 15 400 which is about a
30:05
tenth out of swindon
30:09
that's good that's okay okay um it was
30:11
the only french colony to side with the
30:13
vichy
30:14
collaborationist government during the
30:16
second world war
30:17
yeah and that lasted until a regiment of
30:19
u.s marines arrived in 1942 and said
30:22
um cannibalism was banned there in 1830
30:25
oh well that's quite ahead of its time
30:27
yeah
30:28
for cannibalism no is it not in
30:31
polynesia cannibalism is still
30:33
technically not illegal in the uk
30:34
you're right there's not a specific
30:36
lawyer basically they'll do you for
30:38
something
30:41
desecrating a grave or a corpse or a
30:44
removal of evidence yeah there's a lot
30:45
of things you can get done for but
30:46
specifically cannibalism is not illegal
30:48
in the uk but it is illegal in wallace
30:50
and for tuna
30:51
it has been for a while um actually
30:53
mauritania was the last country in the
30:55
world to abolish slavery
30:57
which it did in 2007 2007
31:00
yeah and it didn't make it a crime until
31:02
2012
31:04
but it's still the thing is i've read
31:06
reports saying that it still happens a
31:07
lot it does
31:08
four years out it's not long to change
31:10
between four this is i mean such rough
31:11
estimates between 4
31:13
and 20 of the population are still uh
31:16
enslaved what although in the interest
31:19
of balance i think uh the mauritanian
31:21
government has denied that has said that
31:24
foreign reports of it are exaggerated
31:26
should we talk a bit about magnets for
31:27
legal safety yeah
31:29
did you know that deer line up from
31:31
north to south even when fleeing
31:34
do they yeah even if that involves
31:35
fleeing straight into the hands of the
31:37
person that running away
31:38
no actually it might make sense because
31:40
it keeps the herd of animals together
31:42
unless of course they run
31:46
you wouldn't bump into anyone because
31:48
you're all going parallel to one exactly
31:50
yeah
31:50
i've always wanted to study this with
31:52
dogs you know when they say that dogs
31:53
poo in
31:53
line with the earth magnetic field or
31:55
something and i know people have done
31:57
studies but i'm actually gonna go to
31:59
richmond park this weekend i don't have
32:00
much on and see if this is actually true
32:02
because it
32:03
so doesn't feel like it's true you're
32:05
going to go and chase deer and see if
32:06
they run
32:07
i sure am yeah
32:14
okay it's time for the final effect and
32:15
that is and my fact is that in 2015 a
32:19
plane had to make an emergency landing
32:20
after the smoke alarm was triggered by
32:22
farting sheep
32:24
amazing it was over 2 000 sheep in the
32:26
cargo hold
32:27
and the alarms went off and it appears
32:30
to be the methane emitted by the sheep
32:32
i got the alarm could not believe that
32:34
you can transpo transport two thousand
32:36
sheep on a plane of sheep that is a lot
32:38
of sheep well i guess
32:40
they kind of don't demand the same like
32:42
roommates
32:43
the world record for um people on the
32:45
flight is 1088
32:47
and two of those were born during the
32:49
flight was that um
32:51
an airlift out of israel or something
32:53
wasn't it out of africa and into israel
32:54
you're right it was
32:56
out of ethiopia and into israel yes in
32:58
1991
32:59
yeah it was a jewish community who were
33:01
at risk of a war or something in israel
33:03
after an airlift that's right um but
33:05
yeah it's incredible this fact
33:07
this happened again in november last
33:09
year with goats on a different plane
33:11
really what that's so weird it could
33:13
happen again in 2014 with cows on a
33:15
different plane
33:17
guess what the headline in the sun uh
33:19
article was about the farting goats on
33:21
the planet
33:21
on a plane uh not bad
33:36
that's better than billy goat cats was
33:38
the sun headline
33:39
great
33:39
[Laughter]
33:42
yes it does seem to be weirdly common
33:43
they need to get better alarms i think
33:45
i suppose if the alarm goes off you're
33:46
better i'm not like oh it's probably the
33:48
farts and then your plane goes down
33:50
it's way better to land and be like sir
33:51
there are no sheep on board
33:53
it's fine it's always the fun animals
33:56
actually in 2014 it was the fire alarm
33:58
not the smoke alarm and i think it was
33:59
caused by the cows overheating
34:01
oh no the heat sensor yeah exactly and
34:04
they thought it was a fire and they
34:04
landed in case it was
34:06
in 2012 a plane had to make a landing
34:08
after a cobra got out of someone's hand
34:10
luggage
34:12
and it uh bit its owner and escaped and
34:14
then i said oh i'm fine i'm fine they're
34:16
like you need to get off the plane now
34:18
if someone didn't quote samuel l jackson
34:21
at that moment
34:21
that is the greatest travesty ever known
34:23
to man okay what about maggots on a
34:25
plane
34:27
they're sort of mini snakes go on
34:30
the line this was a u.s airways flight
34:32
uh atlanta
34:34
airport was um it wasn't allowed to take
34:35
off actually uh because maggots started
34:38
falling out of the overhead compartments
34:40
oh my god oh my god someone had left a
34:42
container of old meat
34:46
and it caused a delay this was it was a
34:48
flight to charlotte
34:49
uh and someone said that there was only
34:52
one maggot landed on that but she felt
34:54
like they were crawling all over me
34:56
because it only takes one maggot to
34:57
upset your world
34:59
which i think is fair and as they're
35:02
telling us to stay calm and seated
35:04
i see a maggot looking back at me and
35:06
i'm thinking
35:07
these are anaerobic flesh-eating larvae
35:10
that the flight attendants
35:12
don't have to sit with i like that
35:15
thought that they're anaerobic
35:16
yeah yeah rather than just was she a
35:19
chemist
35:21
i think these are bloody maggots get me
35:23
off yeah i'm moving my seat here okay
35:25
they're just fly larvae though not just
35:27
they are anaerobic fly larva oh that's
35:32
there was a flight got grounded for
35:33
human flatulence in 2006 after a lady
35:35
was
35:35
fighting on a plane but uh she was a bit
35:37
embarrassed and to get rid of the smell
35:39
she lit a match
35:41
which you really shouldn't do on planes
35:44
in the blue compartment can't you
35:46
no that's they're very clear you're not
35:47
allowed to light anything in the middle
35:49
they've got smoke sensors i know but
35:50
that's the sort of people smoking
35:52
cigarettes isn't it
35:53
yeah you're not supposed to be lighting
35:54
matches in a pressurized environment
35:56
i think people smelled sulfur god i've
35:58
been getting away with it for years and
35:59
yeah
36:00
i always have a joystick on a plane to
36:02
calm myself down
36:04
um well here's a headline from march
36:08
2015
36:09
ba flight forced to land early because
36:10
of smelly poo
36:12
this was a flight to dubai from heathrow
36:15
and one passenger said um
36:16
we knew something was a bit odd about 10
36:18
minutes later the pilot said
36:20
you may have noticed there's quite a
36:21
pundit smell coming from one of the
36:22
toilets
36:23
he said it was liquid fecal excrement
36:26
those are the words he used
36:28
something coming from the passenger
36:32
the plane was in the air for 30 minutes
36:34
and then got turned around had to go
36:36
back to heathrow because apparently
36:38
it was a risk because they only recycle
36:40
half the area this was so
36:42
smelly apparently it was 15 hours until
36:44
the next flight left so they had to all
36:46
stay overnight
36:47
it wasn't like they had to wait that
36:48
long for the smell to go
36:51
i think i'd leave it for 15 hours
36:56
that's very good i was on plane recently
36:59
and i was chatting to the um
37:00
excellent aerostats because um it was
37:02
quite late and i ordered a toasting
37:04
and i saw her do this hand signal to the
37:06
person at the other end of the plane
37:08
like a crocodile
37:08
and i said oh what's that and she said
37:10
it's because um
37:12
one one person's at the front doing the
37:13
food and one's taking the orders down
37:14
the plane and rather than yelling they
37:15
have hand signals
37:16
so toasty is a crocodile because it's
37:18
like a croc monster in france that's
37:19
good um
37:20
a smiley face holding your hand make a
37:22
smile is this cheese sandwich
37:24
cheesy great oh no tapping your shoulder
37:27
is chips because chip on the shoulder
37:28
they have a whole system what's the
37:29
signal for there's an enormous period
37:34
so they transported horses to the
37:35
olympics in rio this year and the
37:37
racehorses got more legroom than your
37:39
standard horse transport
37:41
i learned yeah so usually it's three
37:43
horses to a cabin and these ones were
37:45
two because they're special horses
37:47
with special talents who deserve
37:48
business class treatment
37:50
that is so unegalitarian certainly but
37:53
they also
37:54
uh pile up more carefully with horses
37:56
than
37:57
no more people they don't do normally we
38:00
get pilots doing loop the loops
38:02
and the horses just hate that no it's
38:04
not more carefully but they do more
38:06
gradual takeoffs and landings
38:07
so they spend much longer on takeoff and
38:09
landing and they don't do it as steeply
38:11
so that the deceleration acceleration
38:13
isn't as much because horses get
38:14
centralized because you can't explain to
38:16
a horse okay you're gonna go in a plane
38:17
now
38:17
whereas the humans we know what's going
38:18
on a plane operated by the airline fly b
38:21
was forced to turn back after a b became
38:24
stuck in one of its instruments
38:28
is that true what which instrument what
38:31
instrument on a plane is so sensitive
38:33
well they're all important i imagine but
38:36
bees can't do too much damage can they
38:37
it was like sitting on a button that was
38:39
crucial you thought you press it you'll
38:40
get stung
38:41
sitting on a button maybe it was
38:46
lower the landing gear i can't
38:50
a pork pie loving man caused a minor
38:52
alert at manchester airport when he
38:54
tried to carry one through security
38:57
apparently the juice inside the pie and
39:00
set off the
39:01
kind of thing that was looking for
39:02
liquids uh and the people in security
39:05
said it must have been a very juicy pie
39:08
but we've all got liquid in us
39:10
so why don't we set off the alarm that
39:12
is a great point you're right i'm not
39:13
sure you're quite as juicy as a pork pie
39:16
no don't be insane james nobody's as
39:19
juicy as a good pork pie
39:20
anyone would think that this was just a
39:22
made up story by a tap like newspaper
39:27
we should end

the british navy erased 123 islands from

their charts
01:52
because they didn't exist the british
01:55
navy didn't exist or the islands yeah
01:57
you were gonna do that um no it's it's
02:00
phantom islands were a huge problem when
02:02
we were sorting out our charts
02:04
um they were just the maps were just
02:06
cluttered with these things and
02:08
mainly caused by human error especially
02:11
in the time before we could measure
02:12
longitude
02:13
you would estimate your position with
02:16
dead reckoning
02:17
and because of that you had huge amounts
02:19
of wildly inaccurate
02:21
coordinates that would be fed back to
02:23
cartographers uh painted on maps and
02:25
presented as
02:26
fact so to be fair to them they were
02:28
often real islands they just weren't
02:30
anywhere near the places where they were
02:32
told that they were to what extent is an
02:34
island in a different place before it
02:35
becomes a different item
02:38
i'll give them a hundred miles leeway in
02:40
any direction she's unbelievable
02:43
as well you're giving them too much
02:45
you've got to be loose with these poor
02:46
chaps they didn't have longitude
02:48
okay well sort of mirages and things
02:50
that meant people think they'd seen in
02:51
ireland and they hadn't
02:53
yeah there's a whole load of crazy
02:55
natural phenomena
02:56
presumably still out there waiting for
02:58
you to think that you are seeing land
03:00
when you're not i mean we're talking
03:01
uh icebergs sometimes covered in uh in
03:05
sort of dirt that can disguise him as an
03:06
island
03:07
uh surrounded by did somebody do that
03:09
does somebody go to an iceberg
03:12
biggest prank of all time america the
03:15
whole thing is just made up
03:17
but there's also things like low hanging
03:19
clouds which doesn't sound
03:20
like you would uh mistake the solid land
03:23
but this island
03:25
the fluffiest island in the whole south
03:27
pacific is it still happening do we ever
03:29
get
03:29
yes there's one in 2012 that goes
03:31
covered sandy island got undiscovered
03:33
yeah where is it in new caledonia
03:36
yeah the northeast coast of australia oh
03:38
it was it was undiscovered then
03:40
so everyone thought it was there and
03:41
then eventually someone went there and
03:42
there was nothing there
03:43
wow i've been on maps for a hundred
03:45
years and it was discovered to be fake
03:47
seven years after you launched google
03:48
maps
03:49
yeah so you could sort of time find it
03:51
on google maps and you still can but
03:52
there's a little annotation
03:53
saying it's not does not exist please
03:55
refresh your browser imagine how
03:56
embarrassing if you lived there
03:58
you found out it wasn't real i feel like
04:01
such an idiot
04:02
do you think some people do still try to
04:04
build houses though you know like if you
04:05
go on a walk and you are
04:06
insisting that you're following a
04:07
footpath but you've obviously lost it
04:09
but you just keep
04:10
hacking through the undergrowth do you
04:12
think there are people who are putting
04:13
brick upon bricks
04:15
on a cloud yeah yeah there was a radio
04:17
dj in the 60s who claimed to have
04:19
broadcast a radio show from a reef
04:21
called the
04:22
maria theresa reef that no one has ever
04:24
been able to find and he swear he swore
04:26
to his friends that he was there and the
04:27
water was lapping up to his knees and
04:28
his dead chair was floating away
04:30
maybe he just had a sound effect cd and
04:32
he was like oh the water's really close
04:34
he was in his mom's basement exactly so
04:36
um three years ago pakistan got a new
04:38
island completely new island
04:40
uh they had an earthquake in the country
04:42
because they're quite a couple of
04:43
um tectonic plates uh uh right up
04:46
against each other there
04:46
hence um the himalayas anyway after this
04:50
earthquake it disturbs a pocket of
04:52
pressurized gas
04:53
and as a result this entire section of
04:55
the seabed rose up to the surface
04:58
and bobbed around for a bit and until
05:00
the the gas underneath it was going to
05:02
sort of collapse or get pressurized and
05:03
then it sank again but it was it was so
05:06
unattractive as an island it was just
05:07
mud and silt and it was covered in dead
05:09
fish which had not realized what was
05:11
happening to i mean it
05:12
it's not the kind of mystical land
05:14
appearing out of the sea that we all
05:15
dreamed it was much of a stage
05:17
no wonder it sank everyone's so horrible
05:20
i think if i were a fish i would manage
05:23
to swim
05:24
into the water i mean how quickly did
05:26
this island pop up out of it
05:28
what if you're a flat fish and you're
05:30
meant to be on this
05:31
surface you might not notice as it was
05:33
rising yeah i see
05:34
this guy's getting scared it's kind of
05:36
like the fish's version of a tsunami
05:38
yes do you know that there's no map
05:40
containing the phrase here be dragons
05:42
but there are two uh globes ancient
05:45
globes which do have
05:46
the phrase here be dragons or they have
05:48
the latin because they were classy back
05:50
then which is hick
05:51
and dracones and one of them is from
05:53
1510
05:55
uh and it's one of the first ever
05:56
european clubs and one of them's from
05:58
1504
06:00
and it's from ostrich eggs it's that's
06:01
what they made it out of take two
06:03
ostrich eggs cut them in half glue them
06:04
together
06:05
draw on globe oh wow yeah do we think
06:07
one day the ec will recede to reveal
06:09
that there are in fact dragons there
06:11
wouldn't that be nice
06:12
wouldn't it be well you just get an
06:13
island floating out with a lot of
06:14
dragons flopping around like fish
06:17
well a lot of these monsters they sort
06:18
of they're painted on for stylistic
06:20
flourishes and sometimes it's just not a
06:21
lot of information you've got to fill
06:23
the blanks
06:24
it's called um horror evacuee you know
06:26
this this cartographers
06:28
they cannot ignore blank spaces they
06:30
have to fill it in with something
06:32
but um but there's one particular
06:34
monster you sometimes see
06:35
drawn on on maps of south america in the
06:38
patagonian region
06:39
and it's a giant a giant couple and it
06:41
usually says a regime gigantum region of
06:44
the giants
06:45
the weird thing is that wasn't just um a
06:48
stylistic flourish
06:49
though it got to the point in 18th
06:50
century london where they really
06:52
believed there was a race of
06:54
eight-foot giants that stalked the
06:55
landscape in patagonia
06:57
and to the extent that i think dr
06:59
matthew matey
07:00
secretary of the british royal society
07:02
sent a letter to the french academy of
07:04
sciences saying the existence of giants
07:06
here is confirmed
07:08
wow and when they printed their journal
07:11
it came with a
07:12
frontispiece illustration of one of the
07:15
sailors and we're talking british
07:16
sailors at that time were about five
07:17
foot five
07:18
one of them said he's giving them a
07:19
biscuit that's kind of peace offering
07:22
and so it's a massive bestseller people
07:23
wanted maybe they only viewed them from
07:25
a distance
07:26
and it was just that that area had
07:27
slightly smaller trees
07:30
well the thing is they they reckon that
07:32
it was a native tribe that no longer
07:33
exists
07:34
of maybe six foot tall men that still to
07:37
a very short englishman would look
07:38
terrifying
07:40
there's still an element of exaggeration
07:41
going on there isn't there when a six
07:43
foot tall man morphs into
07:45
a hearby giants type they had six foot
07:48
tall people
07:49
it wasn't washington or lincoln six foot
07:52
uh
07:52
abraham lincoln was six foot four i
07:54
think that's with the hat though
07:55
no i think i think it was even bigger
07:57
with the hat really with the hat he was
07:58
about seven feet tall
08:00
wow yeah um they have a full uh fully
08:02
functional audio animatronic robot of
08:04
him in disneyland
08:06
is it full is it fully fun does it
08:08
emancipate slaves
08:10
no he just stands up makes a speech he's
08:12
supposed to be exactly like him they
08:13
have all the presidents they have a
08:14
whole hall for
08:14
every single president of the united
08:16
states and they all get up and talk and
08:17
make speeches
08:18
you watch video on youtube it's pretty
08:20
weird and cool and it's very practical
08:22
where is this disneyland disney i
08:24
started when you said it i just had a
08:25
vision of all
08:26
of them in a hall talking at the same
08:28
time on their own and it's just the most
08:30
frightening
08:31
weird unsettling they tag each other in
08:33
like restless yeah
08:36
on fictitious islands so you were saying
08:38
that there were various reasons that
08:40
they
08:40
they got it wrong and they put islands
08:41
in the wrong places but they did also
08:44
make them up didn't they they like you
08:46
say they wanted stuff to happen they
08:47
didn't like empty space
08:49
and so i was reading about benjamin
08:50
morrell who i assume you're a maps fan
08:53
benjamin morale i i mean i just find
08:54
historical liars
08:56
fascinating so what benjamin morale did
08:58
is he um made up a whole bunch of um
09:00
places in ireland so he made up this
09:02
island called new south greenland
09:04
near antarctica which didn't exist and
09:05
we thought it existed for
09:07
a hundred years until i think a
09:09
shackleton expedition
09:11
undiscovered it in uh 19 between 1940
09:14
and 1917.
09:15
they went there and said oh that's not
09:16
here but why did this guy
09:18
do that uh well this is i mean voyages
09:22
at that time
09:22
and probably still are are a business
09:25
operation you need to raise funds
09:26
and sponsorship to do it and people are
09:29
more likely to give you money
09:30
if it's exciting if you're often an
09:32
adventure all he wanted to do was go and
09:34
travel he just wanted to live at sea
09:36
uh and so when he came back and he had a
09:38
particularly uneventful trip
09:40
uh he had to sex it up somehow so he
09:42
invented a buyer's island there's morels
09:44
land
09:45
was one of his he claimed a humble man
09:48
that's where the wheels started coming
09:49
off that's where he was us
09:50
and what was the name of that that the
09:51
locals had for oh uh
09:53
uh uh morrell's land
09:57
and so yeah that's how he secured
09:59
funding and so
10:00
he was known as the biggest liar in the
10:03
pacific
10:04
because of this tendency to just invent
10:06
geography so we should say the reason
10:08
that ed knows
10:08
so much about this is that you have
10:10
written a book on this very subject
10:12
haven't you ed
10:13
yeah it's called the phantom atlas and
10:16
it comes out november 3rd and it's
10:17
basically
10:18
an atlas of the world uh as we believed
10:20
it to be
10:21
rather than how it actually existed well
10:23
there you go fandom atlas go and buy it
10:25
not on the 2nd of november but on the
10:27
third because on the second it won't
10:29
exist yes you'll be a bit disappointed
10:31
yeah yeah there are isn't there an
10:34
island somewhere called disappointment
10:35
island um maybe it was one that morel
10:38
bigged up and then his son went and
10:39
visited
10:40
this paradise it's made of ice cream and
10:42
it's 80 meters high
10:43
turn out it's covered in dead fish um
10:45
disappointment islands
10:47
one of the first westerners to land
10:51
there
10:51
uh was john byron who was the
10:53
grandfather of
10:54
lord byron the man who discovered the
10:57
patagonian giants
10:59
really was john byron yeah he was
11:02
captain of the dolphin
11:03
wow and they called him foul weather
11:05
jack because he had this amazing
11:07
knack of sailing always into enormous
11:09
storms i think we've mentioned it before
11:11
yeah yeah so the islands had already
11:12
been called the unfortunate islands
11:14
because they didn't have a decent
11:16
water supply on them and that was by
11:18
magellan but they were called
11:19
disappointment irons for a different
11:20
reason it wasn't because there wasn't
11:21
any water it was because
11:22
uh john byron found that the people who
11:25
lived there were hostile disposition
11:27
and they didn't like him that's a dick
11:28
move though to rename someone that's
11:30
like oh you now live on bastard lane
11:33
aggressive isn't it just a
11:34
disappointment yeah yeah he didn't call
11:37
them
11:37
fierce or frightening which i think they
11:39
would have been more flattered by
11:41
a disappointment it's been a real
11:42
disappointment yeah we were we were
11:44
really expecting good things from these
11:46
islands and um
11:47
i bet he was really nice to their face
11:48
as well
11:51
thank you for the the candy floss
11:52
brilliant islands we'll definitely call
11:53
it that when we get back
11:56
[Music]
12:01
okay time now for fact number two which
12:03
is my fact my fact this week is that the
12:05
white house only got the ability to
12:06
print on double-sided paper
12:08
this year and was that the staff weren't
12:11
trained well enough to understand
12:13
it's a very hard little click box to
12:15
find very hard that's true they've had
12:17
the ability they just
12:18
have the ability no this is the amazing
12:19
thing is that they have not had the
12:21
ability it's incredible so the white
12:22
house has just had a huge
12:24
technological overhaul which has meant
12:26
that they can now print double-sided
12:28
they can do color printing they don't
12:31
all have to use blackberry phones
12:34
um it's incredibly difficult to upgrade
12:36
any technology in the white house
12:38
but partly because of security and
12:40
partly because it's very complicated but
12:41
also there are four different
12:43
offices which look after white house
12:45
tech so
12:47
it's a complete nightmare it's the
12:49
national security council
12:50
executive office of the president the
12:52
secret services and the white house
12:53
communications agency
12:55
and between them nothing has been
12:57
achieved for the last
12:58
20 years all of that expertise they
13:00
still can't get the opportunity to work
13:01
no one's got any hope
13:02
no um and they even one thing they did
13:04
they had to remove uh lots of
13:06
spare wiring that was just left in the
13:08
walls of the building from previous
13:09
systems that were no longer in use they
13:11
removed
13:12
13 000 pounds of wiring so the white
13:15
house has just lost 13 000 pounds in
13:17
weight so they when they renovated the
13:19
situation room in 2006 seven up until
13:22
that point they were using
13:23
cathode ray tube tv screens and fax
13:26
machines and phones from the 80s like
13:27
you were absolutely right it was a
13:28
completely dire situation and apparently
13:30
it was a really
13:31
disruptive overhaul they found bits of
13:33
windows and
13:34
the remains of a sunken courtyard that
13:37
had been left there by previous
13:38
presidents
13:38
that they didn't know was there so i
13:40
think roosevelt built
13:41
in the white house a warm swimming pool
13:44
and he used it for therapeutic swimming
13:46
for his polio
13:47
um so this was in the 1930s there was a
13:49
big opening in 1933. that was inside the
13:51
white house and various other presidents
13:53
used it and their nixon fun and lover
13:56
that he was decided to cover it up
13:58
and build the press classic classic
14:00
nixon
14:02
he also installed the bowling alley
14:04
though so you know he's nosy
14:06
that's true yeah yeah so nixon covered
14:08
it up
14:09
and typically and he turned it into a
14:12
press briefing room but we only realized
14:13
quite recently when they were excavating
14:15
the white house or doing some building
14:16
work so the swimming pool is actually
14:17
completely intact underneath it so
14:19
underneath this floor
14:20
underneath where the main white house
14:22
press secretary stands is the deep end
14:23
of the swimming pool
14:24
and then goes up to the shallow end
14:26
underneath there that's a fun metaphor
14:27
for anybody
14:28
we're putting presumably it's been
14:31
drained
14:32
i think it has been trained yes although
14:34
hillary clinton expressed
14:35
a while ago i think when bill was
14:37
president she expressed a desire to have
14:39
that swimming pool back so you never
14:41
know if she wins
14:42
she might stop all press briefings stop
14:45
the press briefings get the pool back
14:46
because
14:47
we're going to be a campaign slogan we
14:48
could have both and you have inflatable
14:50
floating chairs for the press people
14:52
that is a good idea
14:55
and then the press secretary can have a
14:57
flamingo or something an inflatable
14:58
flamengo to be on
14:59
to show that position you know the
15:02
secret service
15:03
had to hide the front doorbell on the
15:06
north side of the white house from
15:07
calvin coolidge the president
15:09
because he would he would prank them and
15:11
every time someone rang the doorbell
15:13
that wasn't expected obviously the
15:14
secret service had to rush it we're
15:15
talking 1929.
15:17
um and he just loved doing it and then
15:19
hiding in a bush and watching them
15:20
arrive and
15:20
be completely confused and so when they
15:23
finally figured out what he was doing
15:24
and this is this is from an article in
15:25
time i'm not i'm not pulling this
15:27
completely
15:27
out yeah um they they hid the doorbell
15:30
from him so he couldn't do it again
15:32
after that he was leaving bags of
15:33
flaming dog on the door of his own
15:35
house
15:36
obama still has a blackberry doesn't he
15:38
but he really wants an iphone
15:40
does he yeah he was saying oh it's a
15:41
great phone but it doesn't take pictures
15:43
you can't text the phone doesn't work
15:44
you can't play music on it and he's
15:45
really jealous of his wife and kids
15:46
because they've got cool phones and they
15:47
can snapchat and stuff and he was
15:48
complaining about that
15:49
it sounds like a terrible phone if it
15:50
can't text take pictures yeah or do
15:52
anything else
15:53
that's actually the reason that he's not
15:54
um completely tearing up the
15:56
constitution and standing for a third
15:58
term he would but
15:59
he wants that iphone yeah kind of odd
16:01
that you're the president you still
16:02
can't get the model of phone that you
16:04
want
16:04
well it's because it needs to be heavily
16:06
modified doesn't it by the secret
16:07
service whatever phone the president
16:09
uses i think this is why
16:10
and so an iphone is a little bit more
16:12
difficult for them to hack into i think
16:13
or they've gone to so much trouble by
16:15
the time they've modified his bloody
16:16
blackberry that when he comes back next
16:17
year and says i want an upgrade they say
16:19
sorry mate
16:19
it's just the secret service they're
16:21
always modifying things so we've talked
16:22
before about the um the presidential
16:24
cars and how they're modified and i just
16:26
get the
16:26
idea of a blackberry which has got three
16:28
inches of armor placing on the outside
16:31
and there are seven decoys which one is
16:34
my phone
16:35
so another thing about early days of
16:37
tech in the white house the first ever
16:39
telephone in the white house could only
16:41
be used to call the treasury
16:42
and if you wanted to ring the white
16:44
house the treasury just had to pick up
16:45
the phone and dial one
16:47
that's so cool yeah that was one so um
16:50
printing yes printing let's talk about
16:53
that
16:54
did you know you know heart the herald
16:55
angels thing yeah
16:57
the song the song um do you know what
16:59
relation that has to printing
17:01
no that mendelssohn wrote that tune
17:05
to celebrate the 400th anniversary of
17:07
the printing press
17:08
wow yeah isn't that weird it was for
17:11
some celebrations in honor of gutenberg
17:13
and yeah i didn't get that from the
17:15
lyrics i'd say i always thought it was
17:16
should have been called
17:17
the herald angels glory to the newborn
17:20
cannon hp laserjet 600
17:24
um that is very cool yeah so just to
17:26
clarify aside from these guys silly
17:28
jokes the lyrics were not the same at
17:30
the time
17:31
um they were in fact lyrics suitable to
17:33
the celebration of gutenberg
17:34
oh really so yes it's just the music
17:36
that we're talking about
17:38
it was yeah so he wrote the tune and
17:39
then someone else wrote the lyrics about
17:41
it was called the guttenberg cantata
17:43
and then later on it was repurposed well
17:46
do you guys know the uh you know the
17:48
expression
17:48
to a t when you're talking about knowing
17:50
something very precisely yeah you play
17:52
the bank robbery to a t
17:53
do you know what the t stands for no no
17:56
tittle
17:58
and tittle is the official name for the
18:00
dot in a lowercase i
18:01
that printers oh really so the original
18:04
phrase was
18:05
to a title so what's what's a jot thing
18:08
because i know the phrase jot and title
18:10
yeah that's from the bible uh they came
18:12
yet to
18:23
[Music]
18:24
they could actually they could catch on
18:25
as fancy names
18:27
title title come and do your piano
18:29
practice
18:31
jot it's definitely chocolate is a boy's
18:33
name and title is girl's day i don't
18:35
think
18:35
well she's gonna have a rough time at
18:36
school did you know that on
18:38
printing publishing the illustrator of
18:41
the first ever nursery rhyme book was
18:43
sued for selling porn
18:45
this is a guy called george bickham jr
18:47
it was in the 1740s and the nursery
18:48
rhyme book was three inches by 1.75
18:50
inches which is
18:51
so sweet i know isn't that cool
18:54
because it was a book for children so it
18:56
was child size but then he went on to um
18:58
sell loads of porn which makes me really
19:00
wonder what was the illustrations
19:01
he put some saucy images in the first
19:03
children's book well maybe he did
19:05
but i don't think he did
19:06
[Laughter]
19:09
um have you heard of the smallest ever
19:11
inkjet printed picture this was done not
19:13
so long ago it's naught point naught
19:15
eight millimeters by one millimeter and
19:18
it's a picture of a
19:19
few different tropical clownfish it's
19:21
the same as nemo basically
19:23
and it's unbelievable it's done with a
19:25
thing called quantum dots
19:27
the really weird thing is um the the
19:29
dots look
19:30
like a different color according to what
19:32
size they are so obviously they're all
19:34
absolutely tiny but the very very
19:35
smallest ones look blue the slightly
19:38
larger ones
19:39
look green and then the bigger ones look
19:40
red so you can print
19:42
different colors using the same ink
19:46
but just using this i think it's
19:47
something to do with the light but i'm
19:49
not completely sure
19:50
so
19:57
[Music]
20:02
time for fact number three now and that
20:04
is alex
20:05
my fact this week is that world war ii
20:07
most code operators could recognize each
20:09
other's accents over the line
20:12
they were speaking in morse code at the
20:13
time presumably yes yeah yeah so it's
20:15
not even just world war
20:16
ii um operators it's all operators if
20:18
you do moscow a lot if you're one of
20:19
those
20:20
kind of people it's known as your fist
20:22
if you have a good fist or you have a
20:23
poor fist
20:24
that means you've got a very kind of
20:25
sloppy uh bad way of typing in most
20:27
codes
20:28
it means a completely different thing
20:29
actually where i was brought up but yeah
20:32
um and i grew up in a boxing community
20:35
all right just to make that ultra clear
20:40
bit like i guess it's like enunciation
20:41
um but for morse code if you have a good
20:43
fist
20:43
uh you most you morse very you code very
20:46
um
20:48
exactly like i'm not doing now you code
20:49
very um
20:51
very very good articulately is the word
20:54
that i can never remember
20:55
just to be clear is it the speed with
20:57
which people are
20:58
typing the letters or is it everything
21:00
it's the rhythm which you type um it's
21:02
also
21:02
you would um morse differently depending
21:05
on the type of instrument you were using
21:07
so there are different mechanisms in
21:08
different things so you would get
21:10
different rhythms or different
21:11
intonations of uh your dots and dashes
21:14
could british most code people recognize
21:17
individual
21:17
german yeah but it's not like hello
21:20
there
21:20
it's just regional action it's not no it
21:23
sounds like it's exactly the equivalent
21:25
yeah
21:25
yeah i know that there was the people in
21:28
bletchley monitoring
21:29
spy codes and speaking a lot with the
21:31
same people from a long way away that
21:32
they'd never met
21:33
were able to recognize each other just
21:34
from the most accurate i remember one
21:36
story
21:36
a lady talking who worked at bletchley
21:38
talking about it and she felt that she
21:39
knew the person who she was listening
21:41
into so intimately that she referred to
21:43
her as i think maria
21:44
she gave her a name and wow even though
21:46
you only hear
21:47
dot dot dash dash dot dash dot wow
21:51
classic maria
21:54
there's this story about um thomas
21:56
edison it's one of those
21:58
probably apocrypha where after he went
22:00
deaf that he and his wife would
22:01
communicate through morse code
22:03
and so when they went to the theater she
22:04
would have his hand on his knee
22:06
and would tap out the lines
22:09
which that would be pretty rapid and
22:12
quite irritating
22:14
especially for whoever's in the row in
22:15
front of them yeah are we sure she
22:18
wasn't just constantly trying to say
22:18
excuse me i need the toilet can you get
22:20
up
22:22
so on communicating in secret using
22:24
morse code here is a cool thing uh
22:26
during the second world war there was a
22:27
british
22:28
prisoner of war who was imprisoned in
22:30
germany
22:31
uh he was called major alexis castelli
22:34
and
22:35
he was a sower so he would so to pass
22:38
the time very intricate beautiful
22:40
patterns and there are bits of
22:41
cross stitch and there's one he did
22:43
that's really nice it says you know this
22:44
piece of work was made by major here at
22:46
this castle on these dates
22:48
but around the edges there are two
22:50
borders and they
22:51
are little patterns of dots and dashes
22:54
and
22:55
one of them says god save the king in
22:58
morse code
22:58
and the other one says excuse my french
23:00
hitler
23:04
and it's amazing and this is so it was
23:06
so nice and pretty that he was allowed
23:08
to hang it on the wall at the prison
23:10
camps he was in and none of the german
23:11
guards ever spotted or deciphered that
23:13
this was morse code
23:14
so risky because so many of them must
23:16
have known morse code it was wartime i
23:18
thought everyone had to memorize it
23:19
unbelievable in 2010 members of the
23:22
colombian
23:23
army were being held hostage by the
23:25
guerrilla army in gambia the
23:27
revolutionary armed forces of colombia
23:28
and so the colombian army wanted to get
23:30
a message to them and they decided the
23:32
best way to do it would be to commission
23:34
a pop song
23:35
which had morse code hidden inside it
23:37
and then find a way of getting it on air
23:39
broadcast
23:40
on radio so that they could get a
23:42
message to their captions so at various
23:44
points in the chorus
23:45
they sing the words listen to this
23:46
message brother and then after that
23:48
the beat uh is built around a morse code
23:51
message that says nine people rescued
23:53
your necks don't lose hope
23:54
and they got through it and then there's
23:57
an interview with a guy who said yeah i
23:58
recognized it pretty much immediately
23:59
because i was expecting more code and it
24:01
was pretty blatant when i heard her
24:02
listen to this message
24:03
uh yeah it's amazing i knew your accent
24:05
obviously because of that extra long gap
24:06
you leave between
24:07
the e and the l it better be a good song
24:10
as well otherwise you just turn the
24:11
radio off
24:12
yeah that was the problem they had to
24:13
make it good because they had to justify
24:14
forcing radius dike as in they had to
24:16
try and get it on radio station so that
24:17
it could be broadcast
24:19
on the radio so it couldn't be awful
24:20
otherwise people get suspicious yeah and
24:22
you'd have to be like you know ken hates
24:24
jazz we can't do that
24:25
he will switch over immediately actually
24:28
not that useful a message to be honest
24:30
if i were sitting there in prison and i
24:32
just finally decoded
24:33
what's the key to how i get out yeah
24:35
we're on our way
24:37
thank you hope you are well because we
24:39
have at the moment we're having a great
24:40
time recording a pop song but we'll be
24:42
there soon
24:44
um there's morse code on mars anyone sir
24:47
yep uh the curiosity rover leaves tire
24:50
tracks
24:50
and it has morse code in those tire
24:52
tracks it says jpl but there's actually
24:54
a practical use for it
24:55
you're able to look at a picture and
24:57
they know how big the tire tracks are
24:59
because they design the wheels
25:00
so then they can be like oh okay that's
25:01
that much distance very efficient dead
25:04
reckoning
25:04
yes that's that's exactly what it is
25:06
yeah we should say what jpl stands for
25:08
it's the jet propulsion laboratory which
25:09
is nasa's
25:10
they're the guys who built the rover
25:12
right yes that's very cool
25:14
um do you know what 21 means in morse
25:16
code
25:17
no so you used to have all the letters
25:18
obviously but it's so it's such a pain
25:20
to type out every letter as alex says
25:22
so there are about 99 short codes which
25:24
we're using the numbers from 1 to 99
25:26
21 is stop for meal
25:29
so that's why you're not getting a reply
25:31
88 is love and kisses
25:32
um i really like 28 which is do you get
25:35
my writing
25:36
[Laughter]
25:38
really insecure a lot of themes that are
25:41
emerging
25:42
in the last message i really want you to
25:43
draw them out in just remember this
25:45
which is so related to the original fact
25:47
but now it's slightly off topic but
25:49
there were people in world war ii who
25:50
claimed they could recognize a german
25:52
accent in a pigeon
25:54
and these were experts because there
25:56
were a lot of pigeon spies that people
25:57
thought were coming over here
25:59
coming over here taking our information
26:02
going back to germany exactly um
26:05
and so experts claimed that they could
26:07
recognize a germans
26:09
carrier pigeon this sounds to me like
26:11
someone who knows his pigeons and he can
26:13
tell by looking at them but he comes up
26:14
with a really clever way of sounding
26:16
like he's the expert like
26:17
just just say coo again he just knows
26:20
he's got brown dots that's german
26:23
is it the the ones which the german
26:24
spies have a tube on their leg which has
26:26
a message
26:30
um a way that morse code has been used
26:33
recently is in a chess tournament last
26:35
year
26:36
and it was used by an italian chess
26:38
player to
26:39
cheat but it was quite impressive so it
26:41
was one of the biggest i think was the
26:42
biggest chess tournament in italy
26:44
and this guy was ranked number 51
26:47
366 in the world and yet got to the
26:50
penultimate round so apparently the
26:52
tournament organizers were a bit
26:53
suspicious
26:54
up to that point anyway um and he kept
26:57
on he had his hand constantly under his
26:59
armpit while he was
27:00
playing and he was blinking in a most
27:02
unusual manner apparently
27:06
he kept asking for the same song to be
27:08
played over and over again
27:09
so eventually people that was a bit
27:11
dodgy so they asked him to
27:13
take off his shirt and understandably
27:14
actually he said he wouldn't
27:16
so then they put him through a metal
27:18
detector and they found that there was a
27:20
video camera and a little pendant that
27:22
he was wearing around his neck and then
27:23
there was a box under his armpit with a
27:25
massive wires going all around his body
27:28
and that was transmitting signals to him
27:30
from a computer or a friend who was
27:32
telling him
27:35
[Laughter]
27:37
speaking of cheating there's a there's a
27:38
sport called vincent sport a sort of
27:40
competitive bird tweeting
27:42
where you have your bird in a box and
27:44
they measure how many cisco eats it
27:46
produces
27:48
a cisco weed is just than the name of
27:50
the note of a chip and if it goes a sisk
27:52
or what then it's a dud
27:53
but they found i think fairly recently
27:55
it's a competition so you so you have a
27:57
bird and you have to make your bird
27:58
pretty small you have a bird in a box
27:59
you don't do anything to make it you've
28:01
just trained this bird to chirp
28:02
okay there's a huge amount of cheating
28:04
in in the vinca sport finch singing
28:06
or cheaping
28:12
to the point where one year they opened
28:13
up a box because they noticed that his
28:15
bird
28:15
cheaped uh the exact same number each
28:17
time and they found a cd player
28:21
it hadn't struck the tournament
28:22
organizers to have sort of transparent
28:24
boxes
28:24
their suspicion was aroused when he
28:26
asked if he could plug in his revenge
28:30
anyone have anything else before we move
28:31
on can we end this section with a stop
28:34
since there's not much code yeah we can
28:36
alex
28:37
just stop
28:44
okay time for our final fact this week
28:45
which is anna
28:47
my fact this week is that braver snails
28:48
have thicker shells
28:50
this is so good i love this one the
28:52
snails have thicker
28:54
it's like a fridge magnet saying it is
28:58
what does it mean what are you trying to
28:59
tell me it's something you tell your
29:01
children it's not being bullied in the
29:02
playground i think
29:03
i can see you're trying to work and
29:05
figure out the wording so does that
29:06
so snails with thicker shells are bravo
29:09
what a great question we don't know so
29:11
it could be either way around
29:13
this is a study last year that was
29:14
published in biology letters which is a
29:16
royal society
29:17
science journal published last year and
29:20
it found that risk-taking
29:21
freshwater snails tend to have thicker
29:24
stronger
29:24
rounder shells but we don't actually
29:27
know so we can only hypothesize as to
29:29
whether
29:30
they've developed stronger shells
29:31
because they're naturally very
29:32
risk-taking
29:33
and so they need to mitigate that risk
29:36
of predation by having a stronger shell
29:38
or whether they had a stronger shell and
29:40
so they went out and took more risks
29:43
i have never noticed a snail taking
29:46
risks all being conspicuously brave
29:48
like at this at burning buildings it's
29:50
never a snail coming out with the
29:51
orphans over his shoulders
29:53
how do you define bravery in a snail
29:54
like what kinds of things yeah climbing
29:56
up
29:56
saving children um yeah so boulder
29:59
snails were defined as snails who
30:00
uh when you scared them and they
30:02
retracted their neck back into their
30:03
shell they then stuck their neck back
30:04
out again within 10 seconds and the
30:06
cowardly snails were those
30:08
who exceeded the 10 second limit for
30:09
sticking their neck back out again
30:11
and also i think the boulder snails had
30:13
a wider aperture so they had a bigger
30:15
front door essentially
30:22
that's that's nails snails are amazing
30:24
we've never really talked about before
30:25
unbelievable satsumas nails go on
30:28
um so generally in snails you can get
30:30
left-handed nails and right-handed nails
30:32
in the sense that some snails have a
30:33
left spiraling shell
30:34
and some snails have a right spiraling
30:36
shell the first interesting thing is
30:38
that in most
30:39
places around the world the ratio of
30:41
left spiraled to right spiraled snails
30:43
is roughly the same as ratio of
30:45
left-handed people to right-handed
30:46
people the reason
30:47
that there aren't very many left-handed
30:49
snails in most parts of the world is
30:50
because it's very difficult for left
30:51
spiraled and right spiraled snails to
30:53
have sex
30:55
in japan there's a snail called the
30:56
satsuma snail um
30:58
and there are a lot more left spiraling
31:00
snails than right sparring sounds there
31:01
because
31:02
they have a predator which is a snake
31:04
that likes to eat them
31:05
and it has real difficulty latching on
31:08
and biting down on snails with left
31:09
spiral shells or something
31:11
so they flourish that is such a good
31:12
example of natural selection
31:14
no so you hear the story of in new
31:16
zealand they have giant snails that can
31:19
grow the size of hamburgers
31:20
called the oh if i'm pronouncing like
31:22
the poela fanta
31:24
and in 2011 their habitat was on a
31:27
particular i think plateau that was due
31:29
to be mined and so the government in a
31:31
mass operation moved these i think
31:33
something like 6 000
31:34
of these giant snails into uh these
31:37
high-tech cool rooms
31:38
temperature controlled do you know
31:40
what's coming next oh no they died
31:42
there was a glitch and the temperature
31:44
plummeted to zero but no one noticed for
31:46
ages because they didn't constantly
31:48
check on the snails
31:49
um and half of the snails hadn't been uh
31:53
rehomed so i think something like
31:54
800 or 1600 these very rare snails died
31:58
they're all killed
32:01
wow have you heard of the giant african
32:03
land snail
32:04
no this is an amazing snail it's massive
32:07
and they're really popular for eating um
32:10
and people keep on smuggling them around
32:12
the world
32:13
it's about 15 centimeters long normally
32:15
which is pretty long but it gets
32:16
really big in 2005 there was a passenger
32:18
coming through heathrow who
32:20
said she had something small to declare
32:21
and she walked through the red lake
32:23
they looked in her luggage she had 104
32:26
kilos 16 stone of snails in her luggage
32:32
yeah alive and with eggs all over the
32:35
place
32:36
well they're really popular to be eaten
32:37
one farmer in austria sells
32:39
snail caviar and snail livers and snail
32:42
livers are also
32:44
in spiral shapes are they they're
32:46
amazing cool
32:47
yeah you know speaking of smuggling
32:49
snails you know patricia highsmith
32:51
the novelist who wrote talented mr
32:53
ripley yeah
32:54
those books um she wrote strangers on a
32:56
train which was adapted into a
32:57
hitchcock film um she hated people
33:00
and loved snails at a snail obsession so
33:03
she used to smuggle snails with her and
33:04
she kept about 300 snails as pets
33:07
took them with her wherever she went
33:08
when she went to a dinner party she'd
33:09
always have them in her handbag and then
33:11
she'd
33:11
get bored many many a good proportion
33:14
and then she'd whip them out and put
33:15
them on the table
33:16
sorry the snails the snails right
33:19
no wonder people didn't like it i know
33:20
she didn't like people she hated people
33:22
she sometimes apparently traveled around
33:23
with a snail under each breast
33:27
why would you invite that person to a
33:28
dinner party
33:30
there was a guy i like this guy so much
33:33
he was a charity director called lloyd
33:34
scott and in 2011 he dressed up as a
33:36
snail
33:37
to do the london marathon it took him 26
33:40
days
33:41
he raised 20 000 pounds doing so one
33:44
article wrote he has crawled for 26 days
33:46
across broken glass
33:47
nails dog feces enduring cramps vomiting
33:50
and at least one trip to a
33:51
e he has said he was reluctant to repeat
33:54
the experience
33:55
right so he gets to the end of the
33:56
course took him 26 days you know when
33:58
someone stepped on him
34:01
he was in a nine foot long snail costume
34:03
dressed as brian from the magic
34:04
roundabout
34:05
he was then sacked by the charity he
34:07
worked for because he hadn't raised
34:09
enough money doing it
34:11
it's because it did cost more money to
34:12
do it yeah he'd incurred a loss
34:14
basically and not raise enough money and
34:16
as a result
34:17
imagine just crawling slowly towards the
34:19
p-45 at the other end
34:21
it's so unkind why wouldn't they sack
34:24
him
34:24
during it why would they wait if you've
34:26
done the whole thing
34:27
they do sound like sadistic people
34:29
you're right it's true
34:31
just cheering him on all the way as well
34:34
snails
34:34
anuses are still gotta talk about snails
34:38
anuses
34:39
nails snail's anuses are just above
34:40
their heads and
34:42
but they're not there for their whole
34:43
life no so they start out at the back of
34:45
them and then they undergo the coiling
34:47
process like the rest of the body
34:48
so i think the snail must be thrilled as
34:50
it begins as an embryo that is bummers
34:52
all the way at the back of it doesn't
34:53
have to have anything to do with it and
34:54
it gradually grows up and around until
34:57
it's perched right above its eye
34:58
but it's a really weird thing that only
34:59
happens to a specific type of
35:00
invertebrate it's basically my whole
35:01
body just turns around
35:02
i'm unbelievably glad it only happens to
35:04
a certain type of invertebrate because
35:06
the ramifications for the cosmetics
35:07
industry here would be huge
35:09
in terms of having bum replacements so
35:11
that you looked young and beautiful
35:12
again because your bum was where your
35:13
bum is
35:14
instead of on the back of your neck
35:16
although you save on underpants you just
35:18
use a hat right
35:19
great point yeah pants and hats double
35:20
up as one that's a small advantage to
35:23
many disadvantages
35:24
as true as you get older you really want
35:26
your ass to be as far away from you as
35:27
possible
35:29
i was on pet snails dot co dot uk
35:32
only confused with pets nails
35:34
[Laughter]
35:35
um but they have a list of problems that
35:38
your snail can have and the list of
35:40
problems includes
35:42
excessive mucus uh swollen tentacles
35:46
and sudden multiple death
35:50
there's a page for what happens if i've
35:52
stepped on a snail what do i do how can
35:53
i resuscitate it what do you do well the
35:55
author then said
35:56
if you found us now that looks really
35:58
mangled or the internal organs are
35:59
sticking out of gaping cracks in the
36:01
shell etc
36:02
please call one one because 999 is over
36:05
stressed
36:06
i euthanized them by stamping on them it
36:09
sounds horrible but it's far better than
36:11
taking hours to dry
36:12
out and die from desiccation right good
36:14
advice probably worth clarifying because
36:15
i always thought this is true and it's
36:17
not true that snails are built into
36:19
their shells they don't just live in the
36:20
shells like a
36:21
crab it doesn't turn into a slug if you
36:23
take out
36:25
how many snails did you remove before
36:27
you haven't gone anywhere
36:29
have you heard of semi slugs is that
36:31
just a slightly flaccid slug
36:33
[Laughter]
36:35
it's as opposed to what the permanently
36:37
erect slugs you normally get
36:41
[Laughter]
36:48
um semi-slugs are they're slugs which
36:50
have got a shell on their back but it's
36:51
not quite big enough for them to fit
36:53
their whole body into
36:54
but it's not quite completely vestigial
36:56
yet so they can kind of cram a bit of
36:57
themselves into it
37:00
i'm definitely still a size eight i
37:03
don't know
37:03
boris your house is looking pretty small
37:05
these days
37:10

[Music]
00:13
hello
00:14
and welcome to another episode of no
00:16
such thing as a fish
00:17
a weekly podcast this week coming to you
00:19
from the london podcast festival in
00:21
kings cross
00:22
my name is dan schreiber and please
00:23
welcome to the stage it's anna chazinski
00:25
james hurricane
00:26
and andy murray
00:36
and once again we have gathered around
00:38
the microphones with our four
00:40
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:42
and in no particular order here we go
00:44
starting with you james harkin okay my
00:47
fact this week
00:48
is that smooth fan lobsters travel
00:51
around the sea
00:52
inside jellyfish eating their rides as
00:55
they go
00:58
so they they're in the jellyfish and
01:00
they're eating
01:01
the jellyfish imagine you were to take
01:02
an uber home and it was made out of
01:04
chocolate
01:07
but a jellyfish is a living thing so has
01:08
the jellyfish eaten them before they the
01:10
jellyfish
01:11
um no these are kind of like baby
01:13
lobsters uh and they managed to kind of
01:15
swim up inside the bell
01:16
of the jellyfish now come on
01:21
it's a bit early in the show to be
01:23
laughing at the word belle
01:26
also it's a bit far out of the 90s to
01:28
find the word bells
01:31
so yeah he just eats it until the bell
01:33
ends
01:39
james's trap which we all walked into
01:41
tonight
01:43
there is no jellyfish um
01:46
so yeah they get inside this thing which
01:48
is called a moon jellyfish
01:50
they eat it from the bottom to the top
01:52
uh and actually these jellyfish
01:54
you might have heard of these immortal
01:55
jellyfish and actually the moon
01:57
jellyfish is one of these
01:58
theoretically it could live forever as
02:00
far as we know
02:02
if it doesn't get eaten by a baby
02:03
lobster wow meantime
02:05
so it just kind of doesn't mind because
02:06
it's like i'm not going anywhere you can
02:08
have a nibble that's it
02:10
they can't they can they can be killed
02:12
they're much like elves in the lord of
02:13
the rings
02:14
in that sense if it got half eaten it
02:16
probably would be okay wouldn't it
02:17
because a lot of jellyfish can clone
02:18
themselves and if you cut a jellyfish in
02:20
half i think
02:22
that's like the myth about the worm in
02:24
that if you cut one in half it will just
02:26
become
02:26
two clones but the jellyfish have a
02:28
defensive mechanism they fire
02:30
mucus at the lobsters don't they they do
02:32
they they fire mucus at the lobsters
02:34
inside them and if they get enough mucus
02:37
onto the lobster then the
02:38
lobster can die of like a bacterial
02:40
infection so it's almost like an
02:42
internal sneeze onto the lobster so
02:44
disgusting
02:45
but then the lobsters have a defense so
02:47
the lobsters what they do they're
02:49
they have one of their five pairs of
02:51
legs and they use one of their pairs of
02:52
legs like a pair of
02:53
windscreen wipers and they just clear
02:56
the mucus away
02:59
so lobsters i had no idea shed their
03:01
shells
03:02
which so they molt and if they're
03:04
missing a limb
03:06
part of the shell regrowth period is
03:08
also part of their
03:09
limb regrowth period so if they lose an
03:11
arm they're just like
03:12
well i'll just wait for the shedding and
03:14
then i'll do my whole regrowth again
03:16
yeah and there are immortal lobsters
03:18
so what if an immortal lobster gets
03:19
inside an immortal jellyfish
03:22
that's an x sometimes when i say a fact
03:24
and it sounds completely wrong but then
03:27
it kind of sounds right anna will join
03:28
in and be like yes
03:29
and then she'll be like it can't be
03:30
right no lobsters grow to be extremely
03:33
old and we're not sure
03:35
how old they could get to be i think and
03:37
so there's this myth that
03:38
lobsters might live forever because they
03:40
don't really age
03:42
um so they don't go through senescence
03:44
they don't get weaker and they don't get
03:46
infertile in fact they get stronger so
03:47
they get more fertile
03:48
they make better parents they get
03:50
stronger and they keep growing as well
03:52
which is quite unusual they don't ever
03:53
reach a limit of growth so there are
03:55
lobsters that have been found that are
03:56
the size of the ocean the size of the
04:01
well i think they get killed by their
04:03
own bigness
04:05
[Laughter]
04:07
so there's a limit
04:11
this is just a theory though we don't
04:13
know there's a guy called carl wilson
04:14
who studies them and he says
04:16
the reason they'll eventually die if
04:18
humans don't kill them so most of them
04:20
get killed by humans
04:21
um the reason they'll eventually die is
04:23
it takes so much energy to shed that
04:25
exoskeleton constantly because they're
04:27
always molting
04:28
the bigger they get the more energy it
04:30
takes and eventually it takes so much
04:31
energy
04:32
that they're just sat and they die wow
04:34
what i like about lobsters is that they
04:36
are doctor who the
04:39
they are the closest thing to doctor who
04:41
that exists in reality in that
04:42
when they regenerate so when they molt
04:44
uh they turn into a middle-aged scotsman
04:48
and also doctor who doesn't get bigger
04:50
and bigger
04:50
[Laughter]
04:53
he does he does that's why the tardis is
04:55
bigger and bigger
04:57
there are tiny holes in my theory but
05:00
essentially it sucks loads of energy
05:01
when they mop so what they do is they
05:03
lie
05:03
on their side and they worm the wet the
05:05
way out of their shell and it takes
05:06
about half an hour
05:08
and like doctor who you know when he's
05:09
regenerating it's like really traumatic
05:11
for a bit
05:12
and then he does take a few days or a
05:13
while to recover and they have to go
05:15
into hiding for a few days
05:16
to recover because they're so sapped of
05:18
energy while they harden their new shell
05:20
and they're all defenseless as well
05:21
because they're all soft so predators
05:22
can take a bite out of them yeah yeah
05:24
there is a thing so female lobsters they
05:27
have this little sack beneath their
05:29
tails which they collect male sperm in
05:31
and they can decide to use it
05:32
whenever they like when they molt they
05:35
leave that behind
05:36
and i have read that being described as
05:38
basically them regaining their virginity
05:40
which i think is a stretch
05:44
that's what they've claimed in women's
05:46
lobster magazines
05:48
i've read that in a very in actually a
05:50
really good book called sex in the sea
05:52
which is not
05:55
it does not make sufficiently plain that
05:56
it's mostly about lobsters
05:59
they're making diapers out of lobsters
06:01
now um so they're taking there's these
06:03
this element to the skin of a lobster
06:05
which if you kind of break it down and
06:07
you apply it with other
06:08
more diaper-like substances
06:12
you can use it because it sucks up more
06:13
fluid so people are going to start be
06:16
wearing
06:16
lobster diapers and lobster tampons are
06:19
on the way as well
06:20
yeah do they cut the claws off or
06:23
[Laughter]
06:26
sorry this is so embarrassing uh it's
06:28
jellyfish it's jellyfish
06:34
okay do they cut the tentacles on
06:36
[Laughter]
06:39
oh my goodness they are making golf
06:42
balls out of lobsters
06:43
yes do you remember that classic image
06:45
you would see of uh super rich people on
06:47
top of these huge ocean liners hitting
06:49
golf balls off into the ocean
06:51
when the idea of plastic ruining the
06:53
ocean became a proper thing they put in
06:55
laws that you're not allowed to hit
06:56
plastic into the ocean
06:57
uh golf balls immediately were on that
06:59
list and no one could do it anymore so
07:00
university of maine
07:02
has worked out how to make a lobster
07:03
golf ball so that's made entirely
07:05
of lobster shells entirely and uh
07:08
so now it's going to be legal again that
07:10
you can do it so what's the point of it
07:12
sorry what's this
07:13
hobby that the rich have that we don't
07:15
know about you you get on the top of a
07:17
boat and you just smack a ball into the
07:18
ocean and you go oh
07:20
handy i think
07:23
i think you should be grateful that
07:24
scientists at the university of maine
07:26
are devoting their time to making rich
07:27
people playing golf on yachts have a
07:29
better time
07:30
that's a good point so actually back to
07:32
the what the original fact was
07:34
um lobster ride on jellyfish in order to
07:36
get from one place to another don't they
07:38
and when they're in their larval
07:39
stage which is this really weird stage
07:42
where it's called a philosoma
07:43
and this is slipper or spiny lobster
07:45
they look like a circular disc
07:47
with like weird little spider legs
07:48
coming off it and they cling onto this
07:50
lobster to get transported somewhere
07:52
um but then when that when they're
07:54
dropped off and they morph into an
07:56
actual lobster
07:57
they shed part of themselves in order to
07:59
grow but what they do is they shed the
08:01
front
08:01
so lobsters grow from the sort of
08:05
arse upwards so you would have thought
08:07
that they would keep hold of their
08:09
little larval head and their legs and
08:12
all of that but no that just drops off
08:13
and they start from the bum
08:15
the head and everything floats away and
08:16
gets eaten by something and then they
08:18
grow up from the bun
08:19
into a lobster isn't that weird that is
08:23
weird
08:23
that's pretty cool that's very cool we
08:26
need to move on very soon someone else
08:28
who has been killing lobsters recently
08:30
is the nazis what um
08:33
there was a lobster who became a belated
08:36
casualty of the second world war
08:38
after they found an unexploded mine okay
08:41
so the um navy divers went down to see
08:44
the mine
08:45
they saw a lobster inside it gave it a
08:47
name and then blew it up
08:50
they called it lionel the lobster and
08:52
they tried to get him out and then they
08:53
went come on come on and he nipped their
08:55
hand and they were like
08:56
right you're going and they blew him up
09:00
maybe he was a nazi lobster
09:03
all right let's move on uh okay it is
09:05
time for fact number two
09:06
and that is andy my fact is that in 1892
09:09
france built a telescope which was so
09:12
long it couldn't actually be pointed at
09:14
the sky
09:18
so um this was uh for a sort of
09:22
a world's exposition a universal
09:24
exposition which france was holding in
09:26
1900
09:26
and uh that they needed a sequel to the
09:29
eiffel tower basically because the art
09:30
was a huge hit
09:32
and they said we need another thing
09:33
that's really big to be the kind of
09:35
centerpiece of the exposition uh and
09:37
there's an article all about this on
09:38
amusing planet which is a very good
09:39
website uh i recommend it
09:41
and the tube which housed it was 60
09:43
meters long
09:44
the lenses were one and a quarter meters
09:46
across um
09:47
and it was it was too long to move when
09:49
they had built it so
09:51
they had to have a secondary system so
09:54
they constructed to
09:55
to funnel light in from astronomical
09:57
objects and then direct it with a series
09:58
of mirrors into the actual
10:00
telescope and also because it was at the
10:02
world's fair uh there were lots of
10:04
bright lights
10:05
nearby and it was functionally useless
10:07
as a
10:08
telescope because it was in the middle
10:10
of paris so
10:12
it was kind of useful it was broken up
10:13
for scrap it's kind of tragic but i just
10:15
i think that's amazing
10:16
it was quite an amazing exposition
10:18
because they had uh
10:20
they debuted to the world the russians
10:22
debuted russian dolls for the first time
10:25
there
10:25
yeah how cool is that like so you have
10:27
this big thing and then next door is
10:30
like
10:32
and which one of the two do we know yeah
10:34
so
10:35
yeah egg on their face would have been
10:37
better if they'd had a smaller telescope
10:38
inside that and a smaller weapon like
10:40
that
10:43
yeah but so they had that they had a
10:45
ginormous ferris wheel i think it was
10:46
the biggest
10:47
of its time and they eventually had to
10:48
take it down and the compartments were
10:50
so big
10:51
that uh during the war they got taken
10:53
and used as houses because
10:55
people who lost their houses people
10:57
lived inside the compartment
10:58
um they also had they they debuted um a
11:02
travelator
11:02
the sort of moving escalators that go
11:04
you know in the airport when you're
11:05
walking on the flat surface one
11:07
they were showing their that for the
11:09
first time so they had three different
11:11
speeds yes
11:11
right through there there was a slow one
11:13
so you're going at a few miles an hour
11:14
and then you step onto the next one
11:15
which is only slightly different but
11:16
suddenly you're going at six miles an
11:17
hour and then
11:18
whatever the speed because the theory is
11:19
you could do those for
11:21
well not forever but you could do that
11:23
until it gets up to about 30 or 40 miles
11:25
an hour just go three miles an hour each
11:26
time
11:27
and in that way you could go on a moving
11:29
walkway that would go
11:30
30 miles an hour was it a good way of
11:32
getting around town weren't you
11:33
proposing that as an idea for
11:36
for trains so trains never have to stop
11:38
you just walk up to it in the speed it's
11:40
going
11:40
i'm not sure it was my proposal i think
11:43
japan's proposed that but it's nice that
11:45
you've attributed it
11:46
yeah sorry i always mix up james with
11:49
japan
11:52
you've got to stop doing that have you
11:54
guys heard of the banquet of mares
11:56
no no this was the thing that happened
11:58
at the 1900 paris exposition this was a
12:00
group meal where 20
12:04
777 mares from france
12:07
all over france gathered in a massive
12:10
tent
12:11
and had a meal together isn't that
12:12
amazing my god i thought you were
12:14
talking about horses when you said
12:17
and then i thought you were using a
12:18
sexist term for women um
12:20
no i don't even know if that's a thing
12:22
no mayor's in mail mayor
12:24
sorry i should have pronounced it
12:25
properly mayor
12:27
[Laughter]
12:28
but this meal this is amazing so the
12:31
waiters at this meal had bicycles to get
12:33
up and down
12:34
in between the tables even there was one
12:35
uh car driving up and down between
12:38
the tables to take orders extra first um
12:40
they got through 39
12:41
000 bottles of wine um there were seven
12:44
miles of tables 1200 liters of
12:46
mayonnaise
12:47
1500 camembert mayonnaise
12:54
[Applause]
13:04
someone um it was incredibly
13:08
popular so it was visited by more people
13:11
than the population of france at the
13:12
time
13:13
and it was only about six months i think
13:14
it was visited by 50 million people and
13:16
the french population was 38 million
13:18
at the time so people were into it yeah
13:21
and they were apparently the technology
13:22
of it was genuinely astounding
13:24
and i read a i read about a guy an
13:26
artist italian artist who went over for
13:28
it
13:28
called gear camo bala and he was so
13:31
impressed by all the technology so
13:33
that he named all his three daughters
13:35
off the back
13:36
of that one expo he named his daughters
13:40
the italian words for but in english
13:42
light electricity
13:43
and propeller
13:48
uh andy you were talking about they
13:49
wanted to kind of do something that was
13:51
like the eiffel tower but better well
13:53
they asked for suggestions and a lot of
13:55
people decided well maybe you should
13:57
just do something with the eiffel tower
13:59
one of the suggestions was to turn the
14:01
bottom half into a
14:03
waterfall and the top half into kind of
14:05
the shape of an enormous woman
14:08
what well it would have looked like she
14:10
was wetting herself the whole time
14:13
but that was a real suggestion and in
14:14
the end they had loads of different
14:16
ideas what they might do with the eiffel
14:17
tower but in the end they just
14:19
went for applying a fresh coat of paint
14:21
to the spike
14:25
um on telescopes oh yeah yeah um there
14:28
was i was looking at other large
14:29
telescopes
14:30
and there was another two large
14:32
telescope actually the largest telescope
14:33
in the world in 1935
14:36
uh was reported about in the nottingham
14:38
evening post i discovered in the british
14:40
newspaper archive
14:41
and it turned out it was too large to go
14:43
through railway tunnels
14:44
and so it was built in new york and it
14:46
had to get to
14:47
california but they had to take it via
14:50
the panama canal
14:51
so that was rather than being a 2 900
14:53
mile journey that was an 8
14:54
600 mile journey wow because they
14:57
couldn't get it through any railway
14:58
tunnels
14:59
they should have seen that coming
15:05
oh god
15:09
because they had an enormous telescope
15:11
yeah
15:13
it was built to spot martians actually
15:15
really yeah it was built because they
15:17
knew that there were indentations on
15:19
mars and
15:20
they wanted to establish whether or not
15:21
they were made by martians as in were
15:23
they martian canals or were they just
15:25
naturally formed what were they and we
15:27
we're still not sure but we're just like
15:28
martians
15:31
the biggest telescope which has just
15:33
been built in china and that's also
15:34
supposedly for looking for
15:36
aliens although the us defense
15:38
department thinks it might be for
15:39
something else
15:40
right but that's a radio one not a
15:43
an optical so it's a 500 meter aperture
15:45
spherical telescope
15:47
uh it's called fast and um it
15:50
is 500 meters across that's where the
15:52
name comes from and i worked out
15:55
that you would be able to get about
15:57
three trillion bowls of cornflakes in
15:59
there
16:02
and so that would be enough for
16:03
conflicts for every person
16:06
in the world to have a bowl every day
16:08
for a year and it still wouldn't run out
16:10
wow so is that what it's going to be
16:15
the really cool thing about it is you
16:17
can probably see that it looks a bit
16:19
different than normal telescopes it's
16:21
spherical rather than a parabola in fact
16:24
if anyone's listening at home it is a
16:25
spitting image of the thing james bond
16:27
class to climb around in golden eye
16:29
is that right yeah okay looks like a
16:31
very big conflict bowl
16:34
but what they do is a parabola normally
16:36
the data would come in and it would all
16:38
point to
16:39
the focal points of the parabola but
16:41
they don't do that so what they have is
16:42
these six towers
16:44
and they have uh wires coming down on
16:46
them and there's a little robot in there
16:48
and you know if you watch a soccer game
16:50
or an american football game or
16:51
something
16:51
and you have like the camera going
16:54
around the top of the stadium
16:56
and it's able to take all the shots well
16:58
the robot is there and they can move it
17:00
around wherever they want and they get
17:01
it sort of to
17:02
focus to wherever that robot is wow
17:05
that's really cool
17:06
that's very cool apparently 10 000
17:08
people had to move house for the
17:09
telescope to be installed yeah
17:10
yeah because they wanted to be closer to
17:12
get a good look
17:15
and the people who stayed the one
17:17
condition is they have to have their
17:18
mobile phone off
17:19
that's the only condition really yeah
17:21
because it will interfere so it will
17:22
pick up
17:23
and they'd better like conflict
17:30
um have you heard of the james webb
17:33
space telescope this is very cool so
17:36
hubble is
17:36
is in space because it's it's much
17:38
better for looking at the stars because
17:39
there's no atmosphere in the way
17:41
and the next incarnation is going to be
17:43
called the james webb space telescope
17:44
it's going to be about a hundred times
17:46
better apparently don't ask me in what
17:48
metrics
17:49
but it will be they they said that it's
17:51
so powerful that
17:52
um when they turn it on the heat uh
17:55
they'll be able to detect heat coming
17:56
from a bumblebee
17:58
as far away as the moon wow but there
18:01
aren't that many bumble bees underneath
18:04
buzz aldrin left a few
18:08
[Applause]
18:10
we're actually put getting a robot to
18:11
put telescope on the far side of the
18:13
moon
18:13
you know there actually is telescopes on
18:15
the moon at the moment china has
18:17
telescopes on some of their small rovers
18:19
and um they've been looking out into the
18:21
universe as well but we only found this
18:23
out a few years after they'd been doing
18:25
it so they had
18:26
secret telescopes on the moon wow yeah
18:28
pretty cool
18:29
um one more big telescope yeah we need
18:30
to move on inside okay um
18:32
havelias he was a guy
18:36
who made a telescope and it was really
18:38
big it was 150 feet long
18:40
and it was so long that he couldn't make
18:43
a tube to fit it in
18:45
because a metal tube would be too heavy
18:47
and a paper tube would just fall apart
18:49
and so he put it in like a trough it was
18:51
like a trough where all the lenses went
18:53
in
18:54
and he had to have a team of men with
18:56
ropes and pulleys
18:58
and they were just there to kind of keep
19:00
it steady
19:01
because even the tiniest breeze would
19:03
just rip the whole thing apart
19:05
yeah so it didn't really work did it it
19:06
did not
19:08
when was that that's amazing renaissance
19:09
is it nor is it after that
19:11
well it must be it must be before the
19:13
18th century because one of the other
19:15
things that um
19:15
hevelius invented were side-looking
19:18
opera glasses
19:19
so you could have these glasses where i
19:21
could be look like i'm looking over here
19:23
but actually
19:24
i'm looking at andy and they were called
19:26
polemiscopes
19:27
why if you've gone to see the opera
19:30
what's wrong with my face then
19:33
well he called them polemoscopes after
19:35
the greek for war because he thought
19:37
you'd be able to use it in military
19:40
good news their entire army is facing 90
19:42
degrees away
19:44
they will never see us coming
19:49
wouldn't you see the person next to you
19:51
there's a traitor
19:54
they were never really used in the
19:56
military but the reason i know that he's
19:58
um pre-18th century is they were used in
20:00
the 18th century
20:01
for looking sideways at young women at
20:04
bowls
20:06
but it's nice andy that you didn't
20:08
automatically assume that was what they
20:09
were used for it shows you're a
20:10
wholesome person
20:12
that's immediately what i thought
20:15
don't get invited too many balls anymore
20:16
um
20:18
i think we have one on the on the tv
20:20
show we had we borrowed one from the
20:21
museum of optical
20:22
instruments or something yeah they're
20:24
very cool i remember i've got one last
20:25
thing which is that um
20:27
the planet neptune when it was
20:28
discovered it was discovered
20:30
within the hour of astronomers starting
20:32
to look for it
20:33
so literally they went i reckon it's
20:35
about there oh yeah there it is
20:39
uh okay it's time for our next fact and
20:41
that is anna chazinski
20:44
my fact is that the first gentleman's
20:45
club in america was formed for the
20:47
purpose of eating turtle soup
20:51
so this is the hoboken turtle club
20:54
actually i haven't looked up to her how
20:55
to pronounce that hoboken turtle club
20:58
there we go
21:02
i just looked it up in my mind
21:06
this was a brainchild of a guy called
21:08
john stevens and he lived in new jersey
21:11
and he kept chickens and he was plagued
21:13
by turtles he discovered that these big
21:15
turtles were jumping out the river
21:17
and grabbing his chickens and killing
21:19
them so he declared that he would have
21:21
vengeance on all the turtles
21:24
wow and actually a lot of sources say it
21:26
was alexander hamilton's idea
21:28
hamilton of hit broadway musical fame
21:33
to make this turtle club so hamilton
21:36
said to stevens that you should make a
21:37
turtle factory on your new jersey farm
21:40
and kill the turtles and we should eat
21:42
them and so they decided to do that they
21:44
created this club
21:44
and they killed turtles they ate them
21:47
and a bunch of important people joined
21:49
so jefferson
21:50
franklin burr hamilton washington they
21:53
were all members of the hoboken turtle
21:55
club
21:55
they hung out they ate turtle suit they
21:57
had the best time and that was the first
21:59
members club
22:00
so there's a bit of detail i just want
22:02
to pick you up on quickly so
22:03
these turtles were eating his chickens
22:06
right
22:07
so okay i've got so two things one
22:09
turtle's incredibly slow
22:10
as far as i know two i'm pretty sure
22:13
that chickens are incredibly fast in
22:16
fact
22:17
fast to the point that did anyone see
22:18
creed like rocky sylvester stallone gets
22:21
him to try and catch chickens that's
22:22
part of the training for a lot of people
22:24
so they're really quick so what what
22:27
what the
22:28
what's going on yeah what kind of super
22:31
speech noodles
22:32
you're citing the seventh rocky film
22:41
in the eighth rocky film they're
22:42
actually going to have him beaten by a
22:43
test
22:44
for real mistakes they can they can snap
22:47
out with their drawers incredibly fast
22:50
turtles right they can they can once
22:52
they get close to you
22:54
they're there so if you don't see them
22:56
sneak up on you then
22:58
you are dead meat this is my theory
23:02
so don't quote me on it but it might
23:04
have been a lie because the way that he
23:05
found out was that one of his servant
23:07
boys he sent down to the river to find
23:09
out why his chickens kept disappearing
23:10
and the servant boy came back and said
23:12
look i was lying by the riverside
23:13
reading my book
23:14
apparently romance fiction weirdly um
23:17
reading my book and suddenly a turtle
23:19
leapt out of the river
23:20
and grabbed a chicken so maybe the
23:22
servant boy was just stealing all of his
23:24
chickens and didn't know who to blame it
23:26
on
23:26
left out of the river do you know what
23:29
these things were
23:30
these parties uh were called turtle
23:32
frolics
23:33
that's what you'd have you'd have say
23:34
i'm having a turtle frolic come on over
23:36
but what's really awkward about that is
23:38
if you were a turtle and someone said
23:39
you want to come to a turtle frolic
23:40
you'd say yes
23:41
because you'd assume the wrong thing um
23:43
do you know mock turtle soup
23:45
so turtle soup was hugely popular and in
23:47
fact the only reason it's become
23:48
far less popular in america is because
23:50
they have eaten all the turtles
23:52
in loads of states and they're really
23:53
endangered now so in the 19th century
23:55
you had mock turtle
23:56
soup which is made with a calf's head
24:00
lovely this is campbell's famously had
24:03
mock turtle soup yeah so the slogan
24:05
you'll like it's unusual flavor
24:08
some sometimes i found a book from 1821
24:11
with a load of recipes in and it said
24:13
that
24:13
the fetus of the cow is regularly sold
24:16
to pastry cooks for the purpose of
24:17
making mock turtle soup
24:19
lovely uh nixon banned soup
24:23
from white house from america
24:26
from white house state dinners yeah why
24:28
so he this is this was according to
24:30
harry bob haddelman who was his uh
24:34
his he was the chief of staff for for
24:36
nixon and and famously was the main
24:38
perpetrator yes
24:41
he did jail time and he said that what
24:43
happened was
24:44
nixon one day said i don't want any soup
24:47
at any of our dinners okay and
24:48
he said why it's a perfect thing he says
24:50
no one likes soup no one's into soup
24:52
let's get it banned
24:53
and then he spoke to someone who had
24:54
dinner with nixon the night before and
24:56
nixon was famously clumsy
24:57
and apparently they were having soup and
24:59
he got it over his shirt and he thought
25:01
this is unacceptable and so he banned
25:03
soup so no soup was ever served
25:06
did he say waiter waiter there's a bug
25:08
in my soup
25:10
because of the watergate scandal
25:11
[Laughter]
25:13
even i didn't like that
25:17
president lincoln's last ever meal was
25:20
mock turtle soup what was it yeah along
25:23
with like
25:24
six other dishes but it was it was it
25:26
was a starter i think
25:27
were they more lacks on the last meal
25:29
thing in those days well i don't think
25:30
he knew he was going to die
25:32
yeah i guess he wasn't on death row
25:33
actually
25:36
this feels like a last meal
25:39
i don't think i should go out tonight
25:42
they actually the turtle club meetings
25:44
used to become eating competitions they
25:46
morphed into that
25:47
yeah so they the famous soup maker for
25:50
the turtle club meetings in the second
25:51
half of the 19th century was a guy
25:52
called john tarbell
25:54
and he used to arrive two days before
25:56
the club would have its meeting
25:58
and a newspaper report from the time
25:59
said he'd arrive with turtles
26:01
flippers tied and eyes are bulged with
26:03
apprehension
26:05
and two days later they'd be in a suit
26:07
so it was justified apprehension and
26:10
if you could eat more than three plates
26:11
then you automatically entered the
26:12
eating competition
26:14
and then i think the winner in 1894 had
26:16
eaten seven main courses
26:18
um and you got presented with a
26:19
vegetable bouquet
26:21
at the end of it it's just classic uh
26:24
boys club stuff
26:26
uh we need to move on to the next final
26:28
fantasy just maybe one or two
26:30
little kind of other clubs like
26:32
gentlemen's clubs
26:33
there was a 13 club which was an
26:35
anti-superstition club
26:37
they wanted to say okay look this idea
26:39
of 13 being bad luck is just ridiculous
26:42
so let's go for dinner with 13 of us and
26:45
let's have 13 of this and 13 of that and
26:47
let's walk under some
26:49
ladders and have some black cats and all
26:51
that kind of stuff
26:52
but at the first meeting only 12 people
26:54
turned up
26:57
so the 13th have been decapitated by a
27:00
dropped mirror
27:02
well they drafted in a waiter to make up
27:04
the numbers and unfortunately the waiter
27:06
was extremely superstitious
27:08
so he spent the whole time howling and
27:10
trembling like a leader
27:12
i'm going to move us on to our final
27:13
play okay it is time for our final fact
27:16
of the show and that is my fact
27:17
my fact is that when evil knievel
27:20
starred in the 1977
27:22
film viva knievel he used a stunt double
27:27
how cool is that greatest supposed
27:29
daredevil in the world
27:31
using a stunt double was it for
27:32
insurance or something like that it was
27:33
yeah
27:34
so they booked him and he plays himself
27:35
in the movie and the idea was that he
27:38
would make all these leaps and
27:39
he was at one of the shows where they
27:42
were going to
27:43
test out and they did have a stunt
27:44
double already but he did a wheelie just
27:45
the crowd and he fell off
27:47
and the insurance people came in and
27:48
said okay that's it you're done and he
27:50
couldn't do anything else for the movie
27:52
he fell off during a wheelie he was just
27:55
he was crap wasn't he he was the worst
27:57
he was the worst he just fell over all
27:59
the time that's all he did all of his
28:02
actual claims to fame are the mistakes
28:04
that he made so there was a huge
28:06
thing that put him on the map was when
28:07
he failed to leap over the fountains at
28:09
caesar's palace in las vegas
28:11
so he he went over and he clipped right
28:14
at the end of the ramp
28:15
and he went right off and so the the
28:17
jump was 150 feet that's how far he was
28:20
jumping
28:21
when he flew off the bike he went 165
28:24
feet
28:26
he cleared the jump in a fall by 15 feet
28:29
and that's what put him but then the
28:30
bike hit him it was really it was
28:32
horrible
28:33
um but do you know why he was there in
28:35
the first place in las vegas
28:36
no he was there to see a boxer whose
28:38
name was dick tiger
28:40
[Laughter]
28:42
why isn't this stuff on the national
28:43
curriculum guys
28:46
i read a few obituaries of even knievel
28:48
um and uh one of the sentences was
28:50
that he went into semi-retirement after
28:53
a failed attempt to jump a pool full of
28:55
sharks in chicago in 1976.
28:58
he didn't fall in he didn't fall in he
29:00
came off the ramp again yeah real
29:01
problem with ramps
29:03
but he's he's a fascinating character
29:05
because he's he was one of those guys
29:07
who
29:07
became one of the most famous people in
29:09
america in his time
29:10
then disappeared for a very long time
29:12
then the revival of nostalgia came about
29:14
and
29:15
he came back big in the 90s again he did
29:17
a revival tour
29:19
revival knievel because that rhymes with
29:22
his name
29:26
he's trying how many do i have to
29:27
explain
29:30
i would say far too many
29:34
no but so he he was he was a huge
29:36
character and he he led his life
29:39
like he was the most famous man in the
29:40
world he bought private
29:42
jets he had countless motorbikes he used
29:45
to because he had injured himself so
29:46
much he used to walk around with a cane
29:48
and the cane was really cool it could
29:50
screw off at the top and he had vials of
29:52
whiskey inside six bars of whiskey so he
29:54
could have shots wherever he was going
29:56
yeah he got incredibly drunk before his
29:58
last famous
29:59
jump which was actually in the uk he was
30:02
jumping over
30:02
uh 13 buses yeah and it was in the uk he
30:06
got incredibly drunk the night before
30:07
with this guy frank gifford who was the
30:09
broadcaster who was going to show it
30:10
and he woke up the next day and he went
30:12
incredibly hung over to
30:13
look at what he had to jump and he said
30:15
i can't do this this is impossible
30:17
it's going to fail and so frank gifford
30:18
said okay well don't do it and he said
30:20
well i have to do it
30:23
so but it's just gonna fail um and so it
30:26
did indeed fail
30:27
and he crashed and he ended up smashing
30:30
into this wall
30:31
and frank gifford said he landed almost
30:34
at his
30:34
feet and he was spewing blood from his
30:36
mouth and his bones were sticking out of
30:37
his hand
30:38
and so frank bent down to his new friend
30:41
to see if he was still alive
30:42
and he noticed that he was trying to say
30:44
something and so he listened in thinking
30:46
these could be his last words and he
30:48
said
30:49
frank get that broad out of my room
30:52
uh just get get that lady out of my room
30:55
i just want to be
30:56
be sent back there on my own now so oh
31:00
my god when he was filming viva knievel
31:03
um because he didn't have to do the
31:04
stunts he just every night went off to
31:06
the bars of la and he was he frequented
31:08
most was his favorite bar it's called
31:10
filthy mcnasty
31:13
that was an actual play very famous
31:15
place very famous bar and it shut down
31:17
and it got uh
31:18
hygiene regulations and no but when he
31:22
was when he used to go there
31:23
if he got completely drunk um what the
31:26
owners of the place would do is they
31:28
would go
31:28
outside and they had a huge sign and
31:30
they changed the words from whatever
31:31
they had to
31:32
now drunk inside evil knievel
31:36
he went to prison yes for beating up his
31:38
pr
31:39
with a baseball bat and i read one
31:41
account that said that he did this even
31:42
though
31:42
both his arms were in plaster at the
31:44
time
31:48
he also coined his name in prison didn't
31:51
he
31:52
um so he obviously wasn't called evil
31:54
knievel but
31:55
this was when he went to prison before
31:57
he became famous
31:59
and he did a lot of robberies he
32:01
committed a lot of crimes he fell in
32:02
with the wrong crowds
32:04
and his cellmate in prison was called
32:06
awful conofl
32:11
he was he was called william connor but
32:14
people called him awful connor
32:16
who the guards called him awful yeah
32:18
well it's exactly that yeah they
32:19
they were saying it's a it's a fun pair
32:22
of names to have if we name him evil
32:23
knievel
32:25
and actually was evil with an eye
32:26
originally but i think he thought it
32:28
would look too mean
32:29
yeah and so i looked into kanawha and he
32:32
looks like he was a murderer
32:34
he yeah he escaped prison three times
32:37
and eventually uh this was in montana
32:39
because he was from montana
32:40
and they kicked him out of montana and
32:42
said as long as you go to california
32:44
we won't chase you anymore and so they
32:46
sent him off to california and he never
32:48
came back
32:48
and that's the last we know oh um even
32:51
evil son
32:52
is now also a dead devil he has
32:54
recreated some of the jumps that uh evil
32:56
knievel didn't make and
32:57
i went to his website and it says want
33:00
captain knievel to jump something badass
33:02
for your live event
33:04
so you can get him to jump over anything
33:06
you want uh i didn't i didn't actually
33:08
ask for a quote i should have done yeah
33:09
we should get him to jump over our
33:11
podcast while we're doing it
33:12
just just book him just but it won't
33:15
make any sense in a future episode
33:17
i should have booked him for this one
33:21
so some things on stuntmen generally
33:23
yeah
33:24
um so the guinness world record holder
33:27
for most stunts
33:28
in a movie in a movie career as well is
33:31
uh jackie chan
33:32
he holds the guinness world record for
33:34
that he's actually got two guinness
33:35
world records so one is for the most
33:37
stunts in a movie career of a living
33:39
person
33:40
and the second one is that he has the
33:42
most credits
33:43
in a single film 15.
33:46
he's got 15 credits and that's what he's
33:48
got that second one for it's called a
33:50
chinese zodiac
33:51
and his credits include um
33:54
obviously actor writer director producer
33:57
exec producer
33:58
gaffer stunt double
34:01
[Laughter]
34:03
so i looked into it because i thought
34:04
well that doesn't count if you're just
34:05
doing your own stunts
34:06
it's not his stance he does the other
34:09
character's stunts
34:11
is it a fight scene yeah he's punching
34:13
him
34:14
exactly hey why are you hitting yourself
34:16
jenny
34:19
and uh and lastly probably my favorite
34:21
one on that list of his credits
34:23
catering coordinator and you can see
34:26
photos where he's behind like going
34:28
lasagna vegetarian that's so cool
34:33
he's an amazing character jackie chan
34:35
yeah he i said on the podcast ages ago
34:37
and he said this on
34:38
uh the view in america that he's not
34:40
allowed to get into fights
34:42
in america on the street because his
34:44
hands
34:45
are illegal weapons i would argue no
34:48
one's allowed to get into a fight on the
34:49
streets
34:51
so they say that if okay normal fight if
34:53
you were having a fight on the street a
34:54
punch is a punch
34:56
a punch from jackie chan in the eyes of
34:58
the law according to jackie chan
35:00
is firing a gun what if he punches
35:03
himself
35:04
suicide
35:05
[Laughter]
35:08
and also he claims that his mother was
35:10
pregnant with him for 12 months
35:14
i've got a fact about one of your heroes
35:15
who makes incredibly dubious claims
35:17
yeah it's brian blessed um this is from
35:20
brian blaster's autobiography he says
35:22
that uh when he was doing the show
35:23
zed cars back in the what was it 1670s
35:27
he couldn't drive so he had a stuntman
35:29
under his seat
35:30
working all the pedals and the gears and
35:33
the bbc
35:34
then eventually paid for driving lessons
35:36
after blessed became overexcited by his
35:38
performance and kicked his stuntman in
35:40
the bollocks
35:44
um we're going to have to wrap up in
35:45
literally a couple of minutes because
35:46
we're going to shut the building
35:48
all right okay um just very quickly
35:50
there's a guy called ron cunningham who
35:51
is was the i think the oldest stuntman
35:53
ever working he did his final
35:55
performance in brighton at the age of 90
35:57
as a stuntman
35:58
and this is the description of it he
36:01
surrounded by a bevy of brazilian
36:03
beauties
36:04
crushed broken bottles with his bare
36:05
feet set himself a light with lighter
36:08
fuel
36:08
stabbed himself several times in the
36:10
chest with a bendy knife
36:12
smashed a beer glass into his neck with
36:13
a hammer and rounded things off by
36:16
telling his infamous chicken joke
36:21
what a guy
36:26

[Music]
37:21
you

=140
00:00
[Music]
00:14
hello
00:15
and welcome to another episode of no
00:17
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:20
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:21
covent garden
00:23
my name is dan schreiber and i am
00:24
sitting here with james harkin
00:26
andrew hunter murray and anna chazinski
00:28
and once again we
00:30
have gathered around the microphones
00:31
with our four favorite facts from the
00:33
last seven days
00:34
and in no particular order here we go
00:37
starting with fact number one and that
00:39
is my fact
00:40
my fact this week is that a pub in
00:42
london has just renamed itself
00:44
the bill murray however because they
00:46
couldn't get his permission
00:47
they had to name it after william murray
00:49
who was king charles the first whipping
00:51
boy
00:51
instead yes so this is a this is a pub
00:54
uh in angel north london and they wanted
00:57
to give tribute
00:58
as the fact that they were renovating
00:59
the pub and renaming it um but there's a
01:01
law that you can't name
01:02
a thing like a pub after a living person
01:04
unless you get their
01:05
absolute permission yeah so that's why
01:07
they needed his permission
01:09
oh okay that's why you don't see pubs
01:11
called like the piers morgan everywhere
01:12
yeah yeah yeah did he try to get bill
01:15
murray's permission yeah they did quite
01:16
a few things they found a friend of bill
01:18
murray's brother who they got in contact
01:20
with
01:20
um bill murray famously doesn't have an
01:23
agent but there's a number that you can
01:24
call him on and
01:25
propose projects and uh he um or offer
01:28
parts too presumably that's the main
01:30
functionality yeah exactly exactly his
01:32
answer phone is his agent and he listens
01:34
to him so i think they left a few
01:35
messages on that and they were going to
01:36
take an
01:37
ad out in the newspaper in the local
01:38
city where he lives so that he might see
01:40
it just in the paper but then they
01:42
thought that's a bit creepy
01:43
yeah i didn't do that yeah yeah he's um
01:45
he's such a fun
01:47
guy bill murray he's always crashing
01:49
random people's parties isn't he
01:51
yes yeah he's a bit of a legendary
01:52
character in that sense do you think
01:54
it's because he assumes he's been
01:55
invited but hasn't got the invite
01:59
uh yeah he went to a 22 year old
02:01
norwegian students party i think and
02:03
then started doing the washing up
02:04
halfway through it which is such a
02:06
massive sacrifice if you've ever washed
02:08
up anything at a student's party
02:10
that's amazing yeah it's it's one of
02:11
those things where there's a lot of
02:13
these stories
02:13
and the assumption is that they're all
02:15
fake and so actually there has been a
02:16
site that's set up where you can share
02:18
your personal bill murray
02:20
stories i think it's called bill
02:21
murraystories.com it's a good name yeah
02:23
it's confusing though right
02:24
um but so yeah so like all these stories
02:26
it turns out they are true
02:28
are people constantly submitting stories
02:30
about william the childhood whipping boy
02:32
[Laughter]
02:34
actually you should you should explain
02:36
what a whipping boy is yeah yeah
02:38
so being non-british uh i had never
02:40
heard of a whipping boy until
02:41
i heard about william murray and it is
02:44
unbelievable the idea of a whipping boy
02:46
this is back
02:47
uh king charles the first so he was
02:48
1600s and
02:50
what would happen is as a child if the
02:53
prince was naughty there was this rule
02:54
where you couldn't
02:55
hit them and you couldn't uh make them
02:58
be disciplined off the back of a slap or
02:59
anything so they had a best friend who
03:01
was called the whipping boy
03:02
if they did anything bad their best
03:04
friend would get beaten for it
03:06
they tried to encourage friendship
03:08
between the whipping boy and
03:09
the young prince so that the prince
03:11
would have an incentive not to behave
03:13
badly do you know what an even bigger
03:14
incentive would be if the prince
03:16
actually just got whipped every time he
03:17
behaved gradually oh but the divine
03:18
right of kings it's not a
03:20
kicker so that was it wasn't it because
03:21
kings are ruled by divine right and so
03:23
no one's allowed to punish the king
03:24
except god himself
03:26
although charles the first did later go
03:27
on to be punished in a very big way
03:30
by parliament oh yeah he wasn't able to
03:31
nominate bill murray to be
03:33
executed
03:34
[Laughter]
03:36
i struggled to find evidence that much
03:38
whipping was done with the whipping boys
03:40
and whether it was a bit of a nominal
03:42
thing um
03:43
an idealized thing and actually was a
03:45
really privileged position wasn't it so
03:46
he
03:47
eventually was given a great estate
03:50
somewhere and they often were knighted
03:52
or became
03:53
important members of nobility there was
03:54
um a historical society i read about
03:57
where they had a debate about whether
03:58
william murray actually
04:00
liked charles the first or not and they
04:02
did a big debate and they all
04:03
voted that he would definitely not have
04:05
liked charles the first
04:07
well because he was getting beaten up
04:08
every time yeah sorry i forgot about
04:10
that
04:11
because let's be honest all kids are
04:13
little shits aren't they
04:14
so what you would do is just you would
04:16
always at least be threatening
04:18
your friends that you're gonna i'm gonna
04:20
do something naughty and you're gonna
04:22
get beat up for it
04:23
yeah you would and actually even if i'd
04:24
do it to my best friend if i was 10
04:26
even if it was your friend friend
04:28
doesn't mean much when you're 10 years
04:29
old except someone to be tortured
04:31
hmm what that doesn't explain why you've
04:34
made no
04:35
significant personal relationships in
04:37
your life anna i discovered another role
04:38
which you three might know but i think
04:40
non-brits won't know the necessary woman
04:43
yeah the necessary woman was someone who
04:46
was
04:47
effectively a personal cleaner to the
04:49
king and had the uh what was seen as a
04:51
very
04:52
very important job of emptying the uh
04:54
the chamber
04:55
the chamber pot the toilet that was that
04:57
was seen as like a high privilege
04:59
but the title was the necessary woman is
05:01
there anything more necessary than
05:02
someone tipping the poo out of your
05:04
toilet no there is not
05:07
um so there's also a whipping father in
05:10
existence
05:11
uh yeah i'm surprised that i hadn't come
05:13
across this
05:14
uh but this is a christmas character who
05:16
is a french christmas character who
05:18
accompanies saint nicholas on his rounds
05:20
on
05:20
nicholas day on the 6th of december and
05:22
nicholas tradition has it
05:24
goes around and dispenses nice stuff to
05:26
children who've done well
05:27
but he's also accompanied by the
05:29
whipping father the perfuetard
05:31
who judges whether or not a child's been
05:33
naughty and if it has
05:34
whips it what where is this uh france
05:36
and belgium wow
05:37
and is santa cool with this feels like
05:40
he should step in
05:40
santa's pro yeah santa is an ass like if
05:43
you think about it
05:44
because he is deciding on whether people
05:47
get
05:48
gifts or not yeah who made him like
05:49
morality of what's right
05:53
christmas knows he has a list but he
05:55
only checks it twice
05:56
like i've loads of things i've checked
05:58
twice and then the third time i've
06:00
realized it was a mistake
06:02
most of the job of father christmas is
06:04
data entry
06:06
and then there's a brief couriering
06:08
service at the end of it
06:09
can you imagine that you're given this
06:11
amazing role of being sanctioned you
06:12
didn't realize
06:13
that for 364 days it's excellent it's
06:16
all spreadsheets
06:18
there are columns check one check two
06:22
presents delivered child whipped
06:25
question mark
06:27
just while we're on whipping boys and
06:29
people being punished for things that
06:30
aren't their fault so this kind of
06:32
extended into adulthood as well so henry
06:34
iv
06:34
of france he uh became catholic or he
06:38
had a
06:38
ceremony with the catholic church in
06:40
1593 but
06:42
he obviously had to do penance so what
06:44
he did instead he sent two ambassadors
06:46
to rome
06:46
and he said to the pope look if i've
06:48
done anything wrong just punish these
06:50
guys will you and these two ambassadors
06:52
were beaten on the steps of saint
06:53
peter's while singing the misery
06:56
by um by the representatives of the pope
06:58
wow yeah
06:59
oh so the pope didn't even go out and
07:01
beat them himself he sent bloody
07:02
representatives out
07:04
saying if you need to be beaten please
07:06
let my representatives do it yeah the
07:07
pope is very much the father christmas
07:09
in this situation
07:11
so um some other william murray's oh
07:14
yeah yeah so we've got bill murray
07:15
haven't we and we've got the whipping
07:16
boy uh william murray yeah
07:18
um there's a william murray who wrote
07:20
the peter and jane books
07:21
do you remember those those children's
07:23
books 80 million of these were sold
07:26
around the world and they're extremely
07:27
kind of simple books like
07:30
peter plays with the ball jane climbs a
07:32
hill stuff like that
07:33
he works out that 12 words make a
07:35
quarter of all words used by children
07:38
wow and they are a and he i in is it
07:41
of that's the two and was and so he
07:43
wrote all these books
07:45
to kind of just try and teach you those
07:46
words first because if you can get those
07:48
ones nailed then the
07:49
other 20 000 that you learned just i'd
07:51
love it immediately please tell me he
07:53
wrote the books
07:54
just including all of those words which
07:55
is just a sequence of prepositions and
07:57
conjunctions
07:58
no nouns no verbs just you can say that
08:01
was i
08:02
if you're a pirate child that would be
08:05
page one
08:05
what have you got for page two that was
08:07
she
08:09
she isn't one of them and there was a
08:13
guy called william murray
08:14
who uh invented vacations
08:18
um what do you mean the concept of
08:19
vacationing yeah so
08:21
he was american and he there's a
08:23
mountain range called the
08:25
ad iron dax and he used to take people
08:27
up there to
08:29
go walking and it used to be that you
08:31
would call it a holiday the british
08:33
people called it holiday
08:34
but he called it kind of vacating your
08:36
home and going to these mountains and so
08:38
he kind of coined the word vacation
08:40
wow a time when you go away that's very
08:42
cool yeah yeah
08:43
vacation really sounds like an
08:44
advertisement to burglars doesn't it
08:46
you're actively saying i'm emptying my
08:48
house for the week i think it sounds
08:50
medical
08:50
do you yes like vacating your bowels yes
08:53
i'm afraid so
08:55
i'm afraid
08:58
it's like you're talking to your
08:59
unnecessary woman i'm afraid
09:01
i vacated once again it's not the kind
09:05
of vacation you were hoping to have with
09:07
me
09:09
okay uh we're gonna have to move on to
09:10
our next facts soon can we just say a
09:12
couple of things about pubs yeah yeah
09:13
um so bizarre coincidence the pub with
09:16
the longest name in the country
09:18
is in the same town the pub with the
09:20
shortest name in the country
09:21
which is staley bridge and i think this
09:24
is actually like it's it's almost in
09:25
manchester but yeah isn't that weird so
09:27
it's got the q in which is just a queue
09:29
and then it's got the longest name pub
09:31
in the country which is the old 13th
09:32
cheshire astley volunteer rifleman core
09:34
inn
09:35
also there are four pubs in the uk
09:37
called the blob shop
09:39
[Laughter]
09:40
if that's a derogatory reference to
09:42
women's menstrual cycles then i think
09:44
that's
09:45
okay i'm afraid it is
09:47
[Laughter]
09:49
oh that kind of vacation again
09:52
the um i got this fact from chortle the
09:54
the comedy website they reported on the
09:56
fact that they were changing the name
09:57
and at the bottom of the article they
09:58
had a link
09:59
to other comedian named pubs so uh these
10:02
were all in the uk um there's the eric
10:05
bartholomew and that's in morkum and
10:08
that's after
10:08
eric very lovely um there's the four
10:12
candles
10:12
in oxford which is a tribute to the
10:15
ronnie barker the two ronnie sketch
10:17
charlie chaplin has one in elephant and
10:19
castle but it's being demolished but in
10:20
the article they point out that it might
10:22
not actually be missed because the
10:23
online reviews for it include
10:25
unremitting horror and what a
10:28
oh yeah well i think i think it's been
10:31
demolished now unfortunately
10:33
yeah very quickly in 2013 a glittering
10:36
ceremony to reward pubs and clubs in
10:38
wigan for preventing
10:39
night scene violence ended in a fight
10:46
[Music]
10:48
okay it is time for fact number two and
10:51
that
10:52
is james okay my fact this week is that
10:56
it is impossible
10:57
to paint a picture with the world's
10:59
blackest black and
11:00
the world's pinkest pink because it's a
11:02
really bad clash
11:05
it would be wouldn't it actually i think
11:07
they go very nicely together
11:09
but why is it impossible so um the
11:11
pinkish pink has been invented by an
11:13
artist called stuart semple and he sort
11:16
of has control of this
11:17
pigment but the black is black is under
11:20
control of another artist called anish
11:21
kapoor
11:22
and anish kapoor doesn't want anyone
11:24
else to use it and so stuart semple has
11:26
said
11:26
anyone can use my pink apart from anish
11:29
kapoor
11:30
when you go onto his website to buy it
11:31
you have to promise that you are not a
11:33
nish kapoor you are no way affiliated
11:36
with anish kapoor
11:37
you are not purchasing this item on
11:38
behalf of anish kapoor or an associate
11:40
of anish kapoor
11:41
to the best of your knowledge
11:42
information and belief this paints will
11:44
not make its way into the hands of anish
11:46
kapoor
11:47
it's such a nice idea so basically
11:48
everyone in the world can use the pink
11:50
apart from anish kapoor and only initial
11:53
part no one else in the world can use
11:54
the black
11:54
yeah it's very cool so the the way that
11:57
they measure the blackest black is that
11:58
it's how much light it absorbs and
12:01
reflects
12:01
and this uh blackest black absorbs all
12:05
but
12:06
0.035 of the light that you shine on it
12:08
which is very black indeed
12:10
um and the previous record was 0.04 so
12:12
it's kind of incrementally
12:14
increasing they can only make tiny
12:15
amounts of it as well so he can't really
12:16
paint a huge amount
12:18
but when he started they could make two
12:19
square centimeter
12:21
patches of it so don't do a mural no
12:25
but it's made of these uh stems of color
12:28
which are really really really tall
12:30
and not at all white so it's like the
12:31
forest of palm trees basically when you
12:33
say really tall
12:35
you mean not really time i mean tiny
12:36
absolutely tiny sorry
12:38
what i mean is they're 300 times as tall
12:40
as they are white um and so it's
12:42
one of the guys said it's like splitting
12:44
a hair 10 000
12:45
times to make one of these things and
12:47
then when you shine a light on it
12:49
it gets reflected all around inside this
12:51
forest of
12:52
uh pine trees basically until it gets
12:54
absorbed and dissipated as heat
12:56
so the light turns into heat because it
12:57
can't get it can't make its way out the
12:59
moon
13:00
absorbs 88 of the light that hits it so
13:02
it only reflects 12 percent of visible
13:04
light so
13:04
the moon which always looks obviously
13:06
white to us um or bright
13:08
silvery actually is the color of worn
13:10
pavement
13:11
yeah and that's because it's against an
13:13
extremely dark sky yeah
13:16
um actually comets are even more
13:18
absorbent of light
13:20
only two to four percent of light is
13:23
reflected so actually they're extremely
13:25
dark but again they're against the night
13:27
sky so you can kind of see them better
13:29
um to compare that a lump of coal is
13:31
about eight percent
13:33
really so they're four times darker than
13:36
a lump of coal that's amazing
13:37
so that's the moon is almost the color
13:39
of a lump of coal really pretty much
13:41
yeah
13:42
um on pink got a question for you guys
13:46
what color is pink it's like a mixture
13:49
of white and red
13:50
no no pink is dark yellow
13:54
yeah originally if you if you go to the
13:56
originally original
13:58
revamp what so i was reading this book
14:00
called the accidental dictionary it's by
14:02
paul anthony
14:03
jones otherwise known as haggardhawks on
14:05
twitter and
14:06
in it uh he points out that back in the
14:09
mid 15th century
14:10
pink was a yellowish or greenish yellow
14:12
lake pigment made by combining a
14:14
vegetable coloring matter
14:16
with a white base so originally that's
14:18
what pink was defined as as a uh
14:21
dark yellow what's interesting as well
14:23
is they they're not quite sure about the
14:25
etymology of the word pink but there's a
14:26
lot of theories and one of the theories
14:28
is that
14:29
um it comes from a german word which is
14:31
pink on
14:32
and that means to piss so the color of
14:35
dark urine and that's why a sit spinkler
14:37
is someone who sits down to go to the
14:38
loo
14:38
oh and that's why in during the world
14:41
cup or the euros when they were in
14:42
germany
14:44
um they had a problem with um football
14:46
fans urinating everywhere
14:47
and they called it the pinkle problem
14:50
yeah it was also very manly used to be
14:52
very masculine so pink was seen as a
14:54
version of red which was a
14:56
kind of a warlike color and so pink was
14:59
the color that men would wear
15:00
and i think there's a quote even from
15:02
1918 a trade catalog in 1918 which
15:05
recommends
15:05
blue for girls clothes for young girls
15:08
clothes and pink for
15:09
boys clothes because blue was the color
15:11
of the virgin mary as well
15:12
so you'd have pink pink for boys blue
15:14
for girls yeah even in 1927
15:16
i found a thing from time magazine there
15:18
was a princess who'd given birth and
15:19
they said oh we were hoping for a boy
15:21
but unfortunately we've painted you know
15:22
we painted the nursery pink to get ready
15:24
for it and unfortunately it's a girl so
15:25
we've got to repaint the nursery
15:27
she's a princess as well that's kind of
15:29
it's true
15:30
yeah it's really strange if you're a
15:31
flamingo and you're pink
15:33
like a little bit pink i'm talking about
15:35
the modern day color pink here
15:37
if you're a little bit pink and you've
15:38
got a mate who's really pink your mate
15:40
who's really pink will be more popular
15:41
than you
15:42
yeah the more pink you are the more
15:44
popular you are as a flamingo how do you
15:46
get more pink
15:47
eat more algae right okay so it's i mean
15:50
that's really achievable it's something
15:54
to aim for at least
15:55
isn't it yeah this is a study uh by paul
15:58
rose at the university of exeter paul
16:00
rose
16:01
oh yes yeah just on flamingos
16:04
you guys will have to watch david
16:05
attenborough's planet earth too and
16:07
i don't know if you guys have seen it
16:08
did you see the one this week it focused
16:10
on some flamingos which live up in the
16:11
andes i think they're the flamingos that
16:13
live
16:13
higher than any other flamingo in the
16:14
world so it's one of these places which
16:16
is extremely hot in the daytime and
16:17
extremely cold overnight and the lake
16:19
they sit in freezes overnight
16:21
and they just stand there and it freezes
16:23
over their legs and then in the morning
16:24
they have to spend a couple of hours
16:26
pulling their legs out of the ice
16:27
and then trying to walk to the shore and
16:29
then falling back into the ice
16:30
you would think that one flamingo would
16:32
have worked out maybe that we should go
16:34
and sit on a tree or something
16:36
happens every night i mean come on guys
16:38
stand on the bank
16:40
i think we've said before that they're
16:41
the inside of their eggshells is pink
16:44
and so the yolks of their eggs is pink i
16:45
think we've mentioned that before on
16:46
this podcast
16:47
also we only mentioned this on the tv
16:49
show so a lot of the podcast listeners
16:51
might not have heard this but we got
16:52
sent in a news story that
16:54
australia has one flamingo is that right
16:56
was it the flamingo yeah
16:57
yes what was it flamingo yeah one
16:59
flamingo and it's
17:00
uh it's like 85 years old or something
17:02
really old flamingo
17:04
hey if you want the accurate version of
17:05
that fact rather than the misremembered
17:06
one you should watch our tv show no such
17:08
thing as the news
17:09
seems absolutely seamless i didn't know
17:12
i was being advertised to yeah i found
17:14
myself watching a show
17:15
um i saw flamingos earlier this year for
17:16
the first time in my life yeah that's
17:18
something you're live
17:19
yeah oh sorry i've grown up in south
17:22
london
17:23
do they not have them in st james's park
17:25
all right
17:26
it's literally literally 500 meters away
17:30
they they don't have okay clearly
17:33
all right i saw them in spain for the
17:35
first time in my life it's the first
17:36
time i've been
17:37
all right go on tell us some changes you
17:39
sure they went flamenco
17:44
the women dancing flamingos yeah
17:48
the women stuck in ice every night
17:51
they lay pink eggs did you know um
17:55
so it was in the 19th century when they
17:57
installed all the birds for the first
17:59
time in the parks and they brought over
18:00
these beautiful exotic birds and they
18:02
put them in
18:02
and people uh went along in their
18:05
hundreds
18:05
to throw stones at them to kill them no
18:08
yeah that was a huge
18:09
it was and it was like um you know it
18:10
was like a coconut shy at affair
18:12
there was you know they would cheer
18:14
whenever they got an especially big or
18:16
beautiful one of the birds with a stone
18:18
yeah they killed them by the dozen um
18:20
just on colours
18:22
uh do you know how purple
18:25
was first made by the mirrex snail
18:28
oh no i mean made by human synthetic
18:30
purple this was first made by
18:32
a guy called william henry perkin and he
18:33
was the first person ever to
18:35
synthetically make
18:36
colors so we used to get colors from
18:37
natural dyes that existed in the world
18:39
like from beetles or shells or whatever
18:41
um and this was in the 1850s and he
18:44
accidentally made purple
18:46
while trying to cure malaria and so that
18:48
feels like a game for the world in one
18:50
sense but a loss
18:51
in another he was trying to synthesize
18:53
quinine which would help cure malaria
18:55
and he failed to do it
18:56
but then he was rinsing out his flask
18:57
with alcohol afterwards and he realized
18:59
it created this purple solution
19:01
and that meant that he could make purple
19:02
and that was vital because dye was
19:04
so expensive before uh 9
19:07
000 molluscs were needed to create one
19:10
gram of tyrion purple
19:14
no surely not so apparently i know
19:17
i know i can't but surely that would
19:20
have got you a toga or something so you
19:22
own
19:22
no i think a token was many many
19:24
thousands
19:27
to get a single roman i just i don't
19:29
believe it
19:30
only royalty ever wore purple because
19:32
they didn't have enough mollusks in the
19:33
world
19:34
for anyone else did the world just used
19:36
to be completely full of mollusks
19:39
there were trillions and trillions of
19:41
molluscs everywhere
19:43
yeah it did have you heard of
19:44
international klein blue
19:46
just while we're on the invention of
19:47
colours and while we're on patented
19:48
colours as well
19:49
so eve klein the famous artist in the
19:51
60s and in
19:53
in 1960 klein patented a color which he
19:55
had kind of helped to develop so this is
19:57
not the first time
19:58
someone's patented a color and he called
20:00
it international climb blue and he did a
20:01
series of shows
20:03
uh where he splashed it on nude models
20:05
in a series of
20:06
kind of artistic events that the
20:08
guardian described as sexist even by
20:10
1960s standards
20:11
wow um but that color the klein is dead
20:14
now
20:14
the color lives on do you know where um
20:18
i think something that's blue yeah a
20:20
blue man group
20:21
the blue man group no you're kidding
20:23
himself blimey
20:24
aggressive whoa name something blue
20:27
he came with that straight away
20:29
international climb blue is the color
20:30
they paint themselves
20:31
um so was eve klein the one who had
20:34
a art exhibition he was in his blue face
20:37
and everyone came and there was just no
20:39
art anywhere and they just drank the
20:40
champagne and left and they're all like
20:41
where the hell is all the art
20:43
but what he'd done would put something
20:44
in their drink which made their urine
20:46
blue
20:46
and so the exhibition was when they went
20:48
for a pee afterwards yeah it's so cool
20:50
yeah that's very cool uh he's not the
20:52
only person to have invented a blue
20:55
there's a new blue on the scene is that
20:56
yeah uh it's called uh
20:58
jay-z blue it's jay-z who invented
21:13
can i just say you should think eiffel
21:14
65 should have invented a blue now your
21:16
joke makes sense
21:17
[Laughter]
21:19
so jay-z blue just very quickly it's a
21:21
silverfish color uh
21:23
has tiny flecks of platinum in it and
21:25
the idea is that he wanted his own color
21:27
because he's going to be releasing a lot
21:28
of
21:28
jay-z edition style things like jeeps
21:32
and motorboats and he wants jay-z blue
21:35
to be the color the unifying color
21:37
pink should make her own pink shouldn't
21:38
she oh yeah absolutely
21:40
that's a great idea i do know something
21:42
about jonathan greene and his dictionary
21:44
of slang
21:46
but it's about pink so um i was reading
21:47
through all the entries on
21:49
pink in that book and there was a gang
21:51
in ireland
21:52
in the 1700s called the pink indies
21:56
and what they were they're a gang of
21:57
rich young men who like causing trouble
21:59
and
21:59
they like getting into fights and the
22:00
way they would get into fights with
22:02
people is they would cut off
22:03
the bottom few inches of their scabbards
22:05
on their swords so basically the bottom
22:07
inch or two of their sword is poking out
22:09
at the end and then they'd slowly
22:10
prick people that they were next to with
22:12
their swords to make them angry and get
22:14
get into fights with them do you think
22:15
it's pinking like pinking shears
22:17
i bet it does isn't it that's pink yeah
22:20
and then was there a spin-off called the
22:21
pinky dindies who did it with their
22:24
pinky
22:27
[Music]
22:30
okay it is time for fact number three
22:32
and that is anna chazinski
22:35
my fact this week is that at least 30
22:37
percent of the cocaine in america
22:39
arrives by
22:40
submarine that's amazing
22:43
or gets there via submarine so i didn't
22:46
know about
22:46
narco subs but they're a big deal and
22:50
there so a lot of the cocaine in america
22:51
comes from colombia
22:52
and it tends to be transported by
22:54
submarine to mexico and then i think
22:56
often makes it overland from there
22:58
but i also read something in time
23:00
magazine which said that in 2009
23:02
experts estimated that 70 percent of the
23:04
cocaine that was leaving colombia
23:06
left colombia and narco subs wow so it
23:09
all goes away in submarines how cool is
23:11
that
23:11
they've not bought the submarines off uh
23:14
navies like
23:15
they're not old submarines they've made
23:17
these submarines so they're sort of
23:18
homemade submarines i'm sure those
23:20
engineers are very qualified to make
23:22
it but they're pretty cobbled they make
23:23
them in the jungle yeah together
23:25
yeah they're not then yeah imagine just
23:27
traveling that far
23:28
underwater in a thing that there was one
23:30
they found where
23:31
the flippers to control the rising and
23:34
sinking of the submarine were controlled
23:35
by go-kart steering wheels
23:37
so they're quite steampunky and they've
23:39
see their pictures online amazing photo
23:40
galleries of these things the periscope
23:42
on one of these submarines
23:44
it really is basically two cctv cameras
23:46
facing in opposite directions with the
23:48
perspex bubble
23:49
over the top like they're really
23:51
rudimentary cobble together things that
23:52
work
23:53
it would work um but actually the
23:55
advantage of them being cobbled together
23:56
is that most of the time
23:58
when they've reached their destination
23:59
they sync them earlier on this year
24:01
there was an instance of this i think uh
24:03
in march when the
24:04
u.s authorities caught a narco sub which
24:07
had 5.5 tons worth of cocaine in it
24:09
which is worth 194 million dollars
24:11
and the people on it they immediately
24:13
scuttled it so they sunk it
24:15
and that means you can't really get them
24:16
for anything because the cocaine's now
24:17
on the bottom of the ocean
24:19
so you don't really have any evidence
24:20
that they were smuggling cocaine and
24:21
then as a coast guard you have to save
24:22
them so you get these three bedraggle
24:24
coke dealers onto shore
24:25
and they're like it's like we were just
24:26
having a swim
24:29
about half of somali pirates are
24:31
immediately freed
24:32
when they get back to shore how can it's
24:34
very hard to find people who are willing
24:36
to try them and imprison them
24:37
for the right length of time uh it's
24:40
hard finding evidence it's
24:41
yeah it's really maddening for the
24:42
authorities wow yeah so you just get a
24:45
lift back to shore
24:46
you've got a free meal or two and
24:47
there's not evidence enough that you got
24:48
the skull and crossbones flying
24:51
you've got a parrot on your shelf
24:52
[Laughter]
24:54
submarines used to have their own
24:55
newspapers
24:56
did they yeah there's a whole book of
24:58
extracts from submariners newspapers
25:00
do they not get quite wet in the
25:02
delivery process uh well the
25:04
[Laughter]
25:06
that's a hell of a paper round isn't it
25:09
um how did it work they would just print
25:12
them on board they did not
25:14
uh submariners would write and produce
25:15
their own newspaper yeah
25:17
[Laughter]
25:20
actually they had a newspaper in the
25:21
trenches as well didn't they
25:23
yeah like wipers times yeah you know
25:25
about that i don't know about that well
25:27
there was a group of soldiers who found
25:28
an old printing press and they just
25:30
repurposed it and started printing and
25:32
it's really satirical so in hislop and
25:34
nick newman
25:34
of private eye wrote a tv thing about it
25:37
which has now become a play actually
25:38
and it's uh yeah it's traveling on the
25:40
country but it was very satirical like
25:42
loads and it was well it was wipers
25:43
times wasn't it because it was april it
25:45
was a misconception of oprah so
25:46
i'm trying to have a laugh in the face
25:49
of real horror
25:50
it was so the the flamin verses the
25:52
flamethrowers that the german troops
25:53
were using would cause you know horrible
25:55
horrific disfigurement and injury and
25:56
death
25:57
and yet in the wipers times they ran a
25:59
little advert
26:00
for these flamin verses it started off
26:02
with is your boy a practical type
26:05
um it's really you know during world war
26:08
ii the submarines around japan would
26:11
swim along and look for a better pistol
26:13
shrimps
26:14
because pistol shrimps make tons of
26:15
noise by snapping their claws really
26:17
really loud
26:18
and by going on these it meant that the
26:20
japanese sonar couldn't find them
26:21
because they would just hear the pistol
26:22
shrimp
26:23
did we only find that out after the war
26:25
or did that did they then start looking
26:27
for
26:28
pistol shrimps i only found that out on
26:30
reddit just now
26:31
so i don't know is it's a breaking news
26:33
a lot of them are still down there
26:35
no it came out after the war i think i
26:37
think it was quite a long time after the
26:38
war i think it was in the 70s or
26:40
something right they first studied it
26:41
that's very clever
26:42
yeah do you know what you get called if
26:44
you're on a submarine in the royal navy
26:46
but you're not a submariner
26:47
you get called an oxygen thief
26:51
gosh i know there was a really
26:53
interesting article on the guardian
26:54
about um
26:55
life on a submarine they told the author
26:57
do you know we've got a badger on board
26:59
the submarine we picked it up at this
27:00
point and uh we're feeding it looking
27:02
after it and finding enough food for it
27:03
and it was not true but this guy
27:06
the writer said i was really starting to
27:08
believe that there was a bad rumble
27:10
because you have to
27:11
entertain yourself you have to come you
27:12
know come up with sort of jokes and
27:14
games and ideas and
27:15
you know it's very much in a time when
27:16
you're calling non-submariners oxygen
27:18
thieves you wouldn't think you'd have a
27:20
menagerie of animals on there that just
27:23
reminds me that
27:24
we might have said this before you
27:25
sometimes get penguins towards the north
27:27
pole because
27:28
um sailors have taken them as pets in
27:30
the south pole
27:31
and they kind of just bring them up and
27:32
then they get a bit annoying and they
27:34
just let them go
27:35
oh wow you imagine people who are in the
27:37
arctic are responsible geographers or
27:39
environmentalists or something not
27:41
people who just like
27:42
yoink a penguin up and take it with them
27:45
don't tell me if you went sailing down
27:46
the south pole and you saw a penguin
27:48
there you wouldn't go i
27:49
might just i definitely would i don't
27:51
deny that but i'm not qualified to be
27:53
doing that
27:54
well they keep on turning down your
27:55
application isn't it the sole purpose of
27:57
visit
27:58
pick up at penguin can we talk a bit
28:01
about drug
28:02
smuggling yeah yeah um so jfk airport
28:05
has a drug loo which is specifically for
28:09
people who've been suspected of drug
28:11
smuggling to go to
28:12
when they pick you up they x-ray you and
28:14
if it looks like you've got drug
28:15
cylinders in your body yeah
28:16
um they say go to this loo because it
28:19
automatically washes
28:21
um the pellets of drugs which people
28:23
expel whereas in the old days
28:25
officers had to manually sift
28:28
this is the new basically the modern day
28:31
necessary woman isn't it
28:32
yeah yes yes it is it's the auto toilet
28:35
which just washes the packets and says
28:36
right there you go but what is so what
28:38
if you say up i don't need to go
28:39
and then they say well like how long can
28:41
you hold off
28:42
claiming constipation before you
28:44
actually go i don't know they'll just
28:45
wait
28:46
so they'll just wait yeah i don't think
28:47
they say well he's past the half an hour
28:49
so i think we can do it and mary roach
28:52
says that on long flights
28:54
so mary rhodes writes these great books
28:55
and she wrote one called gulp about the
28:57
brilliant book the
28:58
the gut and the stomach and everything
29:00
she says that on long flights sometimes
29:02
flight attendants will pay attention to
29:03
who doesn't eat anything
29:05
because if you've got 50 heroin capsules
29:08
swallowed
29:09
you don't want to eat anything and often
29:10
you've taken anti-diarrhea medication to
29:12
keep yourself bunged up
29:13
and you don't want to do anything which
29:14
will cause you to go to the loo because
29:15
obviously
29:16
if you pull out all the heroin on the
29:18
flight it's a big problem
29:20
just one thing on smuggling drugs across
29:23
the
29:24
u.s mexico border and this was that that
29:27
people come up with various
29:28
uh imaginative ways of getting drugs
29:30
across the border so they make catapults
29:31
very often
29:32
um sometimes they make bits of air
29:34
propulsion that can fire them over
29:36
and then there was someone who was found
29:38
in 2012 just trying to drive
29:40
a bunch of cocaine over the border in a
29:42
jeep cherokee but there's a huge fence
29:44
so they made a makeshift ramp
29:45
on either side and they drove up one
29:47
ramp and then they got stuck
29:49
in their jeep on top so there are some
29:51
really good pictures you can look them
29:53
up of a jeep just hovering on top of a
29:55
fence
29:56
and then the police eventually turned up
29:57
and there are two guys just trying to
29:59
get this jeep down from on top of the
30:00
fence
30:01
there was a politician who was one of
30:03
the early people say there should be a
30:04
big wall between america and mexico
30:07
luckily that idea went pretty quickly um
30:10
but he
30:10
decided as a publicity stunt to get an
30:13
elephant and a mariachi band
30:15
to cross the border well to sort of
30:17
prove that you can prove that you can
30:18
get anything through
30:20
he was called raj peter bachter and he
30:23
also as well as being a politician had
30:25
appeared on the apprentice
30:26
in america oh really wow
30:30
everything is connected yeah
30:33
also one last thing on um so people who
30:35
uh have to smuggle drugs on their bodies
30:38
so the practice of putting them at the
30:39
bottom is called rectal stuffing is it
30:41
the technical name for it
30:43
i mean rectal is technical yeah okay
30:45
well you just wait
30:47
thanksgiving meal
30:51
[Laughter]
30:53
but the website popside did a whole
30:55
piece about this
30:56
practice and the sort of trickiness of
30:58
it because um
30:59
obviously the rectum stores feces and
31:02
then when it's stretched enough
31:03
it sends a signal to your nervous system
31:05
saying you have to go to the loo now but
31:07
they interviewed a chap called william
31:08
whitehead from the university of north
31:09
carolina who's an expert in these things
31:12
and he says that you might actually be
31:13
able to increase the capacity
31:15
by putting drugs up there and end up
31:16
with what he called a mega rectum
31:21
[Music]
31:23
it's time for a final fact of the show
31:25
and that is
31:27
andrew hunter murray my fact is that in
31:28
the greek odysseus myth
31:30
he escapes the cyclops by hiding under
31:33
one of the cyclops sheep
31:34
in the apache version of the same myth
31:37
he escapes by hiding in the anus of a
31:39
buffalo
31:42
i like that the the cyclops is a
31:44
shepherd
31:45
yeah i just never thought of him doing
31:47
sort of menial tasks or
31:48
sort of like running a farm because he
31:51
can't judge the distance of his sheep
31:52
because he's only got one eye oh yeah
31:54
so he doesn't know how far away they are
31:56
so that father ted joke about
31:58
the size of a cow that would actually be
32:00
a reality for him yeah he doesn't get
32:02
that joke
32:03
right yeah he's like yeah that makes
32:04
sense this is a myth that goes back
32:06
and uh there's a french anthropologist
32:08
called julian d
32:11
who has studied myths and he studied a
32:14
particular ethnic group
32:15
who have gone around the world uh for
32:18
thousands and thousands of years and he
32:19
reckons it goes back 18
32:20
000 years and there's always the
32:24
same version of the story is human goes
32:26
into a monster's house to steal
32:27
something
32:28
the monster gets home and he has a herd
32:30
of wild animals and he finds the humans
32:32
and he locks the humans in somehow
32:34
and then he waits by the door for the
32:37
man to kill him as the humans
32:39
start to leave and the humans escape
32:41
using the herd of animals
32:42
so in the greek version they blind him
32:44
and then they hide under the sheep
32:46
and the cyclops feels the sheep as he
32:47
goes out and then in the apache version
32:50
the hero gets into the anus of a buffalo
32:56
i mean it does the same job doesn't it
32:57
it does the job
32:59
it does the job yeah but actually there
33:01
is some cave painting
33:02
in south of france in the cave of the
33:04
tuafre so there's a picture of a bison
33:06
with an extremely distended rectum
33:09
and they think that that might be part
33:11
of this story as well so actually it's
33:12
not just the apaches it might go back to
33:14
ancient
33:15
wow stone age european times is that
33:17
picture the sequel
33:18
of that bison's life story once he got
33:22
back out and there's another bison going
33:23
how did you get like that
33:25
you will not believe it
33:28
there's another theory that there are
33:29
two main families of myth
33:32
they're called the laureation and the
33:33
gondwanan and they're named after the
33:34
two big supercontinents
33:36
and he reckons that one branch of
33:38
humanity went north about 40 000 years
33:39
ago out of africa
33:41
right and they all of all the sheep anus
33:43
stories all of those
33:44
come from there right and as that group
33:46
moved around so that's in switzerland
33:48
it's in scandinavia it's in north
33:49
america
33:50
right it's in greece and lots of those
33:52
myths are about kind of
33:54
the creation of the world the rule of
33:55
the gods the rise of man the end of the
33:57
universe that's it
33:58
the ones who went south and became for
33:59
example the australian aborigines
34:01
are a completely different family
34:02
they're all about a world and which
34:04
already exists the world already exists
34:05
it's about the rise of man or the
34:07
invention of that
34:08
oh wow yeah but both families have one
34:10
thing in common which is the massive
34:12
flood myth
34:13
where humans are punished in some way
34:14
that's the linking myth between these
34:16
two huge groups
34:18
most places have uh most ancient
34:20
civilizations have a flood myth which is
34:22
so curious um there's the babylonians
34:25
they found on cuneiform
34:27
sort of um it was the measurements for
34:29
effectively an arc a noah's ark
34:31
wow this is in babylonian cuneiform time
34:34
it's it's
34:34
it was like a coracle wasn't it it was
34:36
more of a circular thing yeah
34:37
the biblical one which is x cubic spy y
34:40
qubits by z cube it's just more of a
34:42
square
34:42
yeah they actually rebuilt it there's a
34:44
documentary you can see irving finkel
34:45
who's a british museum curator
34:47
actually managed to decipher the exact
34:49
measurements and they
34:50
they tried to rebuild it a very sci-fi
34:52
to be a sphere
34:54
as an order yeah it's true just going
34:57
back very quickly to talking about how
34:58
would the apache
34:59
have managed to get this myth um it's so
35:02
interesting though
35:02
like in recent archaeology we keep
35:05
learning more and more about cultures
35:06
colliding way before
35:08
we realize and did you guys see that
35:09
story about the ancient greeks they're
35:11
looking at the terracotta warriors
35:13
and they're suddenly thinking that
35:14
ancient greek artists were involved in
35:16
helping in the making
35:17
of uh of the terra cotta army and i
35:20
asked a historian friend
35:22
uh if that had any credence to it and he
35:24
said absolutely it's it looks like very
35:26
convincing looks extremely convincing
35:28
and this is
35:29
way before marco polo this is way before
35:31
the first time we ever thought that
35:32
they'd had
35:33
proper contact culturally wow yes i've
35:36
seen the terracotta warriors
35:37
yeah yeah i saw them in london well okay
35:40
they just didn't say james's partner
35:42
people used to throw things at them to
35:44
knock them over
35:46
oh really so you went to where they
35:47
actually went to xi'an in china
35:49
their natural habitat
35:52
and they're in these huge long it's like
35:55
it's like a it's much bigger it's bigger
35:56
than a football pitch this massive
35:58
long hangar that you see them in and
35:59
they're in trenches and they're all
36:00
lined up facing the same way hundreds
36:02
and hundreds and hundreds
36:03
and um and they're finding more and more
36:05
aren't they they're finding terracotta
36:06
acrobats and terracotta yeah jugglers
36:09
and sort of this whole society
36:12
yeah they know that there's they've
36:13
probably unearthed i think it's
36:15
something like a tenth of
36:16
how many they actually believe are gonna
36:18
they're gonna be unearthing over time
36:19
they've just been doing it really slowly
36:20
it's amazing yeah it's so cool
36:22
and the first emperor's tomb which
36:23
supposedly is a mercury lake
36:25
on the inside because he was obsessed
36:26
with the elixir of life and that's
36:28
mercury was the main thing
36:30
um they found a spot that they think
36:31
might be where he's buried and
36:33
using detection the mercury levels
36:35
suddenly go
36:36
up on the dial like really high so they
36:38
think they might have
36:40
found where he is buried and where it
36:41
could be true the myth of the mercury
36:43
lake
36:43
that's very cool that was a really good
36:44
impression of a mercury detector by the
36:46
way
36:49
um do you just quickly do you know what
36:50
color the sheep were that
36:52
um odysseus escapes on my head though
36:56
you're actually quite close you're
36:58
closer than james um
36:59
they're violet colored really if you
37:01
believe homer so this is this weird
37:03
thing about the odyssey where
37:05
all of his descriptions his colour
37:06
descriptions don't really equate with
37:08
what colors are so like the wine colored
37:10
sea
37:11
honey is described as being green um
37:14
hector's hair
37:15
is dark blue um and yeah the sheep are
37:18
described as being violet
37:19
in china there are blue sheep which are
37:22
in secluded bits of china and they
37:23
constantly try to make documentaries on
37:24
them but the government
37:27
there are now documentary makers making
37:28
documentaries about the documentary
37:30
makers
37:30
just keep going no comment
37:33
i think what it is is that there are
37:35
certain areas of china that have been
37:37
closed off by the government for people
37:38
going into and it's just so happens that
37:40
where they believe the blue sheep are
37:42
it's in a territory where you're not
37:43
allowed to go so they can't get access
37:46
i only know it actually because remember
37:47
molly went over to china to make a
37:49
documentary
37:50
right they were they try and make a
37:51
documentary
37:53
again they couldn't they couldn't the
37:55
whole thing fell apart as well while
37:56
they were there but they were looking
37:57
for blue sheep that's what
37:58
so that's molly oldfield who was one of
38:00
the researchers for qi
38:02
yes um you can still see i was going to
38:05
say you can still have a bath in but you
38:06
can't
38:07
you can still see a bath that featured
38:09
in the odyssey
38:10
wow isn't that cool so this is a bath
38:13
that
38:14
odysseus's son is bathed in
38:17
and it actually still exists so it's in
38:19
pailos uh which is on the western coast
38:21
of greece and you can go and see it's
38:23
the bathtub of nesta
38:24
and it's still there it has been around
38:26
since 1300 bc
38:28
it was all fake right so the story of
38:30
what um home is writing about
38:32
the iliad and the odyssey are actually
38:34
two i think of a series of eight
38:36
stories of the whole trojan wars and the
38:39
only those two
38:40
survived in full but i think there are
38:41
six fragments and the trojan wars really
38:43
happened
38:44
um but then obviously they start getting
38:46
crazy god's involved which starts to
38:47
become a bit fictional but yeah nestor's
38:49
palace existed and nestor's bathtub
38:50
existed
38:51
okay there are ruins of troy that is
38:52
discovered aren't they so yeah they know
38:54
that it was a real place
38:55
yes yeah and that there were loads of
38:56
cities which were destroyed or burned
38:58
down or you know fell in war and then
39:00
they build another one on top and
39:01
they've got a kind of layer cake
39:02
yes because i think the person who
39:03
discovered troy initially got in loads
39:05
of trouble because in order to discover
39:07
it he destroyed
39:08
an equally valuable layer of archaeology
39:11
on top of it which he just chucked away
39:12
and then that's book nine in the series
39:16
so in greek mythology a lot of uh you
39:18
know weird and wonderful stuff happens
39:20
and for particularly zeus turning
39:21
himself into things in order to get off
39:23
with women
39:24
he turns himself into someone's husband
39:26
which at least
39:27
kind of makes sense uh then he turns
39:30
himself into a swan
39:30
yeah to get off with leader uh then some
39:33
rain was it not a golden shower
39:35
it's described as a golden shower which
39:37
which used to be called just
39:38
pink shower and that's for perseus isn't
39:42
it uh oh i read danai oh to
39:45
to make perseus sorry to make yeah
39:46
you're absolutely right uh then as a
39:48
bull
39:49
so this is really interesting he
39:50
disguised himself as a bull to get off
39:51
with europa
39:52
right and europa is the mother of king
39:55
minos of crete
39:57
so king minos of crete his mum has had
40:00
sex with a bull
40:01
but then his wife pacify falls in love
40:04
with a bull
40:05
which is a punishment from the gods
40:06
because he said he tries to trick them
40:08
and send them an inferior sacrifice
40:10
it's never worth doing in the greek myth
40:11
they always find out this is an imperial
40:13
sacrifice they never don't check
40:15
um so not only has his mum got off with
40:19
a bull
40:20
his wife has now fallen in love with the
40:22
bull it just must be so embarrassing
40:24
for him it's a real curse yes imagine
40:26
what bad luck it would be if you're
40:27
trying to make an escape
40:28
and you happen to pick the wrong bull's
40:30
anus to climb into
40:31
but it turns out can you find your mum
40:33
in there yeah
40:39
okay that's it that is all of our facts
40:41

hi all okay look james and i admit
41:31
that maybe there aren't any flamingos in
41:33
james's park
41:35
our further research tells us now what
41:37
we need to do about this is either
41:39
you lot if you have any photographic
41:41
evidence that there have been flamingos
41:43
in some james's park you need to send it
41:44
to us quickly so that we feel vindicated
41:46
and if you don't and it turns out there
41:48
aren't any there and there never have
41:50
been and we were confusing flamingos
41:51
with pelicans
41:52
because we're idiots then you just have
41:54
to never ever tell andy

[Music]
01:33
hello and welcome to another episode of
01:36
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
01:39
coming to you from the qi offices in
01:41
covent garden
01:42
my name is dan schreiber and i'm sitting
01:44
here with james harkin
01:45
andrew hunter murray and anna chazinski
01:48
and once again we have gathered around
01:49
the microphones with our four
01:51
favorite facts from the last seven days
01:53
and in no particular order
01:55
here we go starting with you james
01:57
harden
01:59
okay my fact this week is that the word
02:00
wow was popular in scotland
02:03
for 400 years before it caught on in the
02:05
rest of the english-speaking world
02:09
you were so waiting for one of us to go
02:11
there weren't you
02:12
oh hang on wow there we go i'll edit
02:15
that in the right place
02:16
and yeah isn't that crazy it's um first
02:20
use
02:20
1513 this is according to the oxford
02:22
english dictionary
02:23
in a translation of the aeneid by um g
02:26
douglas whoever that was
02:28
was it the original author virgil yeah
02:30
you're right but g douglas was a
02:32
scottish person
02:33
and he said out on their wandered
02:34
spirits wow
02:36
thou crease and then the first time it
02:39
gets used really in the english-speaking
02:40
world is about the 1890s
02:42
and um burns uses it and a few other
02:45
scottish writers use it as well
02:46
and it was and it was in that context
02:48
it's meant as an exclamation
02:50
looks like it doesn't it wow thou cries
02:52
yeah you're crying
02:53
wow yeah so why was scottish people
02:55
keeping it to themselves
02:56
like a secret for 400 years maybe the
02:59
only exciting things that happened in
03:00
the world were all in scotland
03:02
that's true they were ahead with
03:04
inventions and the enlightenment there
03:05
was much more to say
03:06
wow too that's true and there was
03:08
necessarily elsewhere yeah yeah
03:10
so yeah andy brings up a good point how
03:12
is it that
03:13
we must have been people were
03:15
communicating obviously from scotland
03:16
and england and
03:18
ireland and further places uh that would
03:20
they been saying it to their face
03:22
do we know
03:22
[Laughter]
03:25
so you think that when the english went
03:27
back down south they go wow what a bunch
03:29
of yeah
03:29
wow thank god he's gone um well we don't
03:33
know
03:33
basically this is um as with all of
03:35
these citations this is the evidence
03:37
that we have
03:38
so the only evidence that we have that
03:40
it was spoken by anyone or
03:41
written by anyone was in scotland and
03:43
then when the evidence for it being
03:45
spoken in england and the rest of the
03:46
world comes in that's all later on
03:48
okay but it seems like they were
03:49
deliberately keeping it secret from
03:51
everyone i guess
03:52
as soon as an english person comes along
03:54
they all had an agreement to shut up
03:56
um do you know another very old scottish
03:58
word first used in scotland is boo
04:01
really b double o same meaning yeah it's
04:04
a word that's used in the north of
04:05
scotland to frighten crying children
04:08
so they're already frightened and crying
04:10
but does that frighten them out of their
04:12
tears it does sometimes with children
04:13
doesn't it i've tried it
04:14
does it yeah just on rounds sometimes
04:16
make it worse
04:18
i think it's 50 50. it's definitely
04:19
worth a try though it's quite fun but
04:20
then you might try it like eight times
04:22
and by then it's like
04:23
you know you do it once and it gets
04:25
worse and then you do it again thinking
04:26
i'll bring it back to the last time
04:28
it just gets worse again it's a slippery
04:30
slope
04:31
but um so another early reference this
04:33
might give more of a
04:34
guide to what context it was using was
04:37
uh used by
04:38
sir walter scott in 1830 and he used to
04:41
write
04:41
papers on the esoteric on on the
04:43
paranormal i had no idea about that so
04:45
he wrote a paper on
04:46
uh it was called letters on demonology
04:48
and witchcraft and that was from 1830
04:51
uh and the sentence he had in it was we
04:53
start and are afraid when we hear one
04:55
cry
04:55
boo but he smelt it boh so sorry is he
04:58
claiming that ghosts shout boo
05:00
is that where we've got the original
05:02
idea that ridiculous ghost shout boo
05:04
yeah i guess so that's what i always
05:06
thought
05:13
it's a lot like scottish dialects i
05:15
think different ghosts from different
05:16
places have a different uh
05:17
ways of speaking don't they different
05:19
pronunciations yeah
05:21
um so the scottish also have scots has
05:24
421 words for snow which is
05:28
so i think a lot of people used to say
05:29
that scandinavians had
05:31
thousands of words yeah eskimos um
05:34
and they don't but the scots do so
05:36
they've got these amazing words for snow
05:37
and this is taken from all the scottish
05:38
dialects so there are
05:39
a lot of scottish dialects from all
05:41
around the country and that's different
05:42
to
05:43
gallic and there was a study done a
05:45
couple of years ago by a scottish
05:47
thesaurus compiler that found they have
05:49
words specific to snow
05:51
like sneezel which is to begin to rain
05:54
or snow
05:54
skelf is a large snowflake fuchta
05:58
is to fall lightly and come down in odd
06:01
flakes
06:02
it's really fucturing out there that
06:04
sounds very germanic
06:08
it does a bit but it also sounds a bit
06:09
scottish and it obviously is a germanic
06:12
language the thing with the um eskimos i
06:15
think is that
06:16
you could technically say that they do
06:18
have 100 words for snow but the way
06:20
is is they have one or two or maybe four
06:22
or five roots
06:23
which kind of means snow and then the
06:25
rest of them you can just put like a
06:26
prefix or a suffix after it to make
06:28
another word which means this type of
06:30
snow or this type of snow so it's
06:31
snowing a bit
06:32
always knowing a lot or yeah in 98 other
06:34
variations
06:35
so like we would it counts heavy snow
06:38
and light snow and
06:39
you know to snow
06:42
just in this in the study that they did
06:44
the thesaurus they also looked at um
06:46
words that scottish people have for
06:48
sports they figured there'd be a lot of
06:50
sporting words as well and they assumed
06:53
that football would have the most words
06:54
that are used to refer to it because
06:56
football's popular sport and actually it
06:57
turns out that the sport of marbles
06:59
has many more words
07:03
yeah so marbles has things like it had
07:05
369 different items of vocabulary linked
07:08
to it in scotland
07:09
yeah there's runtit which is having lost
07:12
all of one's marbles to one's opponent
07:14
there's a neve which is a method of
07:16
cheating and delivering the shot by
07:18
advancing the hand too far i remember
07:20
having that done to me when i was a kid
07:21
wow so marble's actually more popular in
07:23
scotland than football in some ways and
07:25
are these
07:26
these are words from scottish dialects
07:28
or are they gaelic words
07:30
they're words from scottish dialects got
07:32
it and i think you mean gaelic
07:34
i think i mean gamer oh my god guys
07:37
we've just spent the last 15 minutes
07:38
before this podcast arguing about this
07:40
yeah that was an active war that andy
07:43
just
07:44
pulled out there all i'm saying is what
07:46
my glaswegian father has said and now i
07:48
think of it i'm not certain whether he
07:49
said galac or gaelic but i'm pretty sure
07:51
it was gaelic
07:52
so please write in in your hundreds
07:56
um sorry is marbles competitive on like
07:58
is it
07:59
like as in like you know how we have
08:01
darts on tv here is there marbles on tv
08:03
in scotland yeah the marbles channel
08:05
you're kidding are you watching it
08:09
no i think it's just like an
08:11
old-fashioned game isn't it like for
08:12
instance
08:13
skittles or something like that yes it's
08:16
not one
08:16
it's a bit more old-fashioned than
08:17
possible older than pogs pogs go back
08:19
uh to the roman numeral the romans had
08:22
500 different words to describe pox um
08:26
so there is another word uh which
08:28
mcmillan's open dictionary took in
08:30
august so
08:30
some dictionaries have an open section
08:32
where anyone can submit a word and
08:34
then but and it's like a holding pen for
08:36
words and then they take the words that
08:38
they can find actual evidence for
08:40
and one few of them i imagine yeah very
08:42
few uh well actually they say about
08:44
three quarters
08:45
fall into the disallowed sections and
08:46
they said that those are words that you
08:48
or your friends have invented
08:50
obscenities the names of people you
08:52
dislike and what you would like to do to
08:54
them
08:55
but with me all three of those are just
08:57
one word
08:57
[Laughter]
08:59
can you share that or as we'd have to
09:01
edit that and the out of the room
09:03
[Laughter]
09:04
um but the word that they took in august
09:08
was ball bag oh yeah after hurricane
09:11
barbara after hurricane borbog which was
09:13
a storm
09:13
uh in 2011 all the papers it was so
09:15
annoying that all the papers called it
09:16
hurricane ball bag
09:19
for ball bag yeah but with a w ball bag
09:21
and when nigel farage visited scotland
09:23
in 2013 he was greeted with cries of
09:25
nigel europe or bag
09:26
was that a reference to the hurricane of
09:28
political activity that he engendered
09:30
i can only assume that it is i can't
09:31
think of any other reason why people
09:32
would compare him to a ball back yeah is
09:34
there a picture of him next to that word
09:36
in the dictionary
09:37
[Laughter]
09:40
i don't know they don't really go for
09:41
pictures in the dictionary but maybe in
09:42
the children's edition they'll have a
09:43
picture
09:44
yeah it's weird that's a saying actually
09:45
isn't it if you look up stupid there'd
09:47
be a picture of you because as you say
09:48
the dictionary is a book that does not
09:50
go in for pictures at all
09:51
they should say if you looked up stupid
09:53
in the dictionary there'd be a
09:54
lengthy verbal description of you
09:58
however if you were to look it up in the
09:59
children's dictionary or the picture
10:00
dictionary there would be a picture of
10:02
you
10:03
um can i just on uh or in pictionary
10:05
sorry you're still going yeah
10:07
that's a game right it's a game yeah
10:09
it's an ancient roman game
10:11
it dates back to earlier than pogs
10:13
impossible
10:15
just on scott's dialects so um there was
10:17
a census in 2011 which asked scottish
10:20
people if they spoke scots and there was
10:23
a website that was set up to help people
10:25
out with this in case they didn't know
10:26
if they did because it's dialects a lot
10:27
of scottish people might
10:28
speak a dialect but think they're
10:30
actually speaking just kind of bad
10:31
english
10:32
and so there's now a website called i
10:34
can a-y-e-c-a-n
10:36
which is really fun and it uh plays the
10:39
dialects from all the different regions
10:40
of scotland
10:41
and if you can understand them it shows
10:42
that you speak that dialect does it also
10:44
play bad english just in case
10:46
that's what you speak uh yeah that's
10:47
actually become a scottish dialect now
10:49
it's in its own right
10:51
what they should do is put bad english
10:52
at the top and so you click on that
10:54
and it's bad english and you're like
10:55
okay i definitely don't have any of the
10:57
rest rather than going through all the
10:58
dialects and get into the ending
11:00
now it was bad english after all i don't
11:02
know if you go through all because if
11:03
you're from glasgow for instance it's
11:04
very unlikely that you'll speak the
11:06
shetland dialect
11:07
unless you've enchanted they spoke
11:10
something very similar to old norse for
11:11
a long time
11:12
yeah until only like two or three
11:15
hundred years ago
11:16
yeah yeah it's like clung on because it
11:18
could work came because norway owned
11:20
what's clements or is that the name
11:21
of it it clung
11:23
on sorry that's just my bad diction
11:26
you've got bad english
11:29
so i found another scottish word which
11:31
is glamour
11:32
is scottish okay which i didn't know and
11:35
because i've heard of that in english as
11:36
well
11:37
yeah well we use it now it's it's passed
11:40
on to us yeah but i just assumed glamour
11:42
meant you know someone who looks very
11:44
glamorous
11:44
as someone who's dressed very well in
11:46
high fashion um but the the definition
11:48
of glamour at least the original
11:50
definition is
11:51
magic enchantment spell so whenever a
11:54
magician says my glamorous assistant
11:56
he's actually saying my magical
11:57
assistant is that really true
11:59
yeah as in that's why he says always no
12:02
i know i'm i'm assuming that must be the
12:04
origin of why not why that can't be
12:05
why my glamorous assistant said
12:10
astonishing like magical and then it
12:12
meant something beautiful and then it
12:14
was used by magicians and then dan made
12:16
this connection
12:17
yeah that's how that works yes okay
12:20
what a beautiful connection to me they
12:23
might be saying my magical assistant
12:24
so the collins english dictionary they
12:26
have a scottish wing and they recently
12:27
added
12:28
so they have words of the year which
12:29
we've discussed on the tv show as well
12:31
um so they added things like tv shows
12:33
that there's no such thing as the news
12:35
it's the bbc two tv shows
12:37
it's on wednesday nights on bbc two
12:39
after news night okay
12:40
they had a words like um neverending
12:43
have you heard of this
12:44
which is just you know this debate about
12:46
the referendum
12:48
was talking about the whole time yeah
12:49
exactly that just keeps going on and
12:52
they've also added
12:53
nicola bilia any guesses uh is it a lot
12:56
of things that you collect
12:57
that are made out of nickel no not bad
13:00
that's been all the rage this year
13:03
james's desk is is it not is it like
13:07
loose change because that's like nickels
13:08
no think of think of the nicola bit of
13:11
nicolas
13:12
nicholas sturgeon it's merchandise
13:13
collects nickel
13:16
it's merchandise featuring the face of
13:18
nicholas sturgeon
13:19
and i'm i'm unsure about how much this
13:21
is used i haven't found up my relatives
13:24
all right i'd ask them i've just got a
13:25
couple more things on uh
13:27
exclamations um so one that i use all
13:30
the time is holy moly
13:31
and i assume that i got that from the
13:33
early batman series you know holy moly
13:35
batman
13:36
so there's actually a wikipedia article
13:37
where they've listed every single
13:39
holy something that robin has said and
13:41
there's hundreds of them and i've just
13:43
picked out a few
13:44
holy bank balance that's one holly
13:47
contributing to the delinquency of
13:49
miners
13:50
batman and holy priceless collection
13:53
of etruscan snoods batman in context
13:56
they might make sense
13:58
yeah i think it was plot point
13:59
explaining i think it was like
14:01
he was just trying to remind you that
14:02
we're looking at etruscan smoothies
14:06
but weirdly the one missing from the
14:07
list holy moly not on the list
14:09
because it's a catchphrase that's owned
14:11
by captain marvel
14:12
you were saying holy um that's what kind
14:15
of a lot of
14:16
um oaths aren't they they're kind of
14:17
things against the church
14:19
gosh means it's another way of saying
14:21
god godzilla godzilla
14:22
sucks god's hooks um but when i was
14:25
looking up gosh i found out that
14:26
people used to say losh which was like
14:29
short
14:30
for lord yeah in the um 18th century
14:33
losh
14:34
oh that was really good that isn't it i
14:35
really like that um
14:37
just on fuddle doddle uh another
14:39
explanation
14:40
that's got a more recent history do you
14:41
know where that came from no yeah
14:44
thought a little that thing we say all
14:45
the time to exclaim that comes from
14:47
pierre trudeau
14:48
so you know justin trudeau's dad who was
14:49
prime minister of canada in the 70s
14:51
he was in a parliamentary debate when he
14:53
was prime minister and the opposition
14:55
said something he didn't like and he
14:57
mouthed what the opposition then
14:59
went out to journalists and complained
15:00
looked a lot like a word beginning with
15:02
f then a word beginning with o
15:04
so they said what were you thinking when
15:06
you mouthed those two words
15:08
and he said well what's the nature of
15:10
your thoughts gentlemen when you say
15:11
fuddle duddle
15:12
so he sort of claimed it was fuddle
15:14
duddle and then that's
15:16
caught on in they all went off
15:19
and then actually recently last year um
15:22
justin made a speech where he did admit
15:24
that his dad hadn't in fact said fuddle
15:25
duddle
15:26
right yeah scandal uh there was an
15:28
israeli guy he was 90 years old
15:30
and he um said he was in the news about
15:32
5-10 years ago saying that he invented
15:34
have a nice day
15:36
and he was like i don't know what i was
15:38
thinking it just came into my head and i
15:40
just said have a nice day and then
15:41
before i knew it everyone was saying it
15:45
[Applause]
15:49
okay it is time for fact number two and
15:51
that is anna
15:52
my fact this week is that at least 61
15:54
species live
15:55
in elephant footprints that's so cool
15:58
it's so cool wow
15:59
so exclusively live in no so
16:03
this is a paper that was published a
16:04
couple of months ago i read about it in
16:06
scientific american
16:07
and uh they've just studied the mini
16:10
ecosystems that are elephant footprints
16:12
and they found
16:13
61 species in them and that's they're
16:15
only studying a few so all these
16:17
creatures are living in elephant
16:18
footprints but they make it their
16:20
permanent habitat because
16:21
they looked at older footprints and they
16:23
found that they'd have much many more
16:25
animals in them and that's because you
16:27
know dead leaves have fallen into them
16:28
and things like that so it's become a
16:31
bit like richer environment for them
16:33
but yeah you get think you get tadpoles
16:34
in them swimming around you get
16:37
mites mayflies leeches
16:40
none of the big hitters you don't get
16:42
any shrews yeah they don't get dolphins
16:47
they can hold 200 liters of water it's
16:49
not amazing what
16:50
yeah maybe a liter is less than we think
16:52
it is yeah how much is oh well this is
16:54
an african liter which is five
16:55
milliliters no
16:56
i don't know i i think it's um i think
16:58
it's yeah if you had to express that in
17:00
a
17:01
in something that i don't understand uh
17:03
it will be uh you know nearly 400 pints
17:05
wow in one footprint yeah i think that's
17:08
i was so skeptical but i guess in mud
17:10
then they'll sink very deep won't they
17:12
yes does that count as a footprint then
17:15
if like your leg is in you think it's a
17:18
leg lift that's a leg print
17:20
it's a full elephant print if he just
17:21
gets completely stuck
17:24
um but they do and the other thing they
17:25
do is they hop from footprint to
17:26
footprint
17:27
what elephant no i read they can't even
17:30
jump
17:32
um they call them stepping stone
17:33
habitats and apparently because during
17:35
the dry season it's really important for
17:36
animals
17:37
and if if the elephants weren't walking
17:39
through this area they would disappear
17:40
during the dry season certain other
17:42
species would not be able to live in
17:43
these areas
17:44
um but they i mean this is this raises
17:47
more cause for concern
17:48
elephant poaching obviously because it
17:50
looks like these elephant footprints are
17:52
preserving
17:53
a lot of these creatures massive housing
17:55
crisis yeah exactly
17:57
yeah i mean i was already quite
17:58
concerned about elephant poaching but
18:00
now i hear that tadpoles are involved
18:02
i'm breaking it well the thing is like
18:04
with all this kind of thing the
18:05
elephants you can be concerned about the
18:07
elephants but actually it's the fact
18:08
that they're top
18:09
you know species in an ecosystem and
18:12
actually it is there's hundreds and
18:13
hundreds
18:14
of different species that rely on them
18:16
so you like if you want to save an
18:17
elephant it's mostly the other animals
18:19
you should be worried about really
18:21
yeah they don't look as cool as an
18:22
elephant do they it's true but also
18:24
is it not that they loads of plants that
18:26
they disperse the seeds through yeah
18:29
they do they really do who do sorry
18:31
elephants so people
18:32
they're called ecological engineers
18:34
because they properly create
18:35
habitats for other animals to live in
18:37
don't they by knocking down all the
18:38
trees yes
18:40
they're good for lions right because
18:42
they they knock down trees as they move
18:43
along and they convert forest to
18:44
scrubland which means you get smaller
18:46
animals living in the scrubland which
18:47
means that lions
18:48
prey on the smaller animals so not so
18:50
good for the smaller animals then
18:51
they're
18:52
good for them yeah and apparently they
18:54
have 96 species of seed a day on average
18:57
in their poo which they disperse across
18:59
the
19:00
uh areas they're moving through they're
19:01
like large insects really aren't they
19:03
spreading they're like big bees
19:05
spreading seeds i mean they are they're
19:08
almost like pollinators
19:09
they're so unlike insects that's the
19:12
opposite of insects
19:13
they spread the seed of plants i mean in
19:14
that one incredibly specific respect
19:16
they're quite like us
19:17
and they've got six legs is that right
19:20
so um just to get my head around it
19:22
these animals they're most
19:24
found there where else would they live
19:25
if not in the footprints in ponds and
19:27
stuff
19:27
so there are fewer ponds around
19:28
especially in the dry season yeah
19:30
they'll find this kind of
19:31
footprint which is turned into a pond
19:33
and they'll live there but if it wasn't
19:34
there they'd
19:35
have to try and find another pond yeah
19:36
but the more ponds there are the more
19:38
places they can live
19:39
and the better their species will do
19:41
okay yeah okay
19:42
i got it now do you know an amazing use
19:45
for elephant poo
19:46
if you're dying of thirst oh no
19:49
yes you can squeeze it together and ring
19:52
a few drops of water out
19:53
yeah bear grylls does that doesn't he i
19:55
think he did it with camel poo as
19:56
opposed to elephant poo i can't remember
19:58
maybe it was elephant poop but
19:59
yeah you can see that there's not much
20:01
bacteria in there
20:02
botswana gets 650 000 kilos of elephant
20:05
droppings on the ground that's botswana
20:07
alone
20:07
every day wow that's a lot it's so much
20:10
yeah they put a lot it is a lot no one's
20:14
denying it
20:16
all right but i'm waiting for one of you
20:17
to try to deny it
20:19
it's not that much it is that much
20:23
so uh i was i was looking into um other
20:26
odd places that you find
20:28
uh species living in okay that aren't
20:30
necessarily natural to their habitat
20:31
those uh
20:32
researchers uh have been looking in the
20:34
specific african cave because they found
20:36
out about this uh group of crocodiles
20:39
who live in this cave and it's really
20:41
rare because they're out of sunlight for
20:42
most of the time
20:43
um they feed off bats that live in the
20:45
cave and so on and yeah they have just a
20:47
totally
20:48
different eating habit the thing is they
20:50
do go out though so they're not going to
20:51
go blind they're not going to adapt
20:53
to night time because they're going to
20:55
need the heat because they don't make
20:56
their own heat yeah
20:57
exactly but they do spend a lot of time
20:58
there and one thing they noticed they
21:00
did think
21:01
uh for a while at least to begin with
21:03
like wow i wonder if this is a
21:04
completely different species or
21:06
subspecies of crocodile
21:07
because it was orange and they were like
21:09
what's going on here and it turns out
21:10
that because of the water that they're
21:12
in in the caves
21:13
there's so much bat poo that goes into
21:14
the water that it's colored the
21:16
crocodiles into a different color
21:18
so they come out and they're like whoa
21:19
what's this weird color and it's just
21:21
bat
21:21
do you think that's where the phrase
21:23
batshit crazy comes from because they
21:25
look so crazy they've turned orange and
21:26
the other crocodiles are going you look
21:28
batshit crazy it could be
21:30
yeah i don't think so there's actually
21:33
this other amazing cave that has its own
21:36
ecosystem
21:37
which i found out about so this is
21:38
called the sundoon cave in vietnam
21:40
apologies if i've mispronounced that
21:42
this is the world's largest cave
21:44
and it was discovered in 2009 by a
21:47
british guy
21:48
uh so that's what when it's reported it
21:50
was discovered even though i think the
21:51
people in vietnam knew about it
21:52
but it's this huge cave so it has a
21:54
jungle in it
21:55
if you go into it so it's got a jungle
21:57
with you should honestly look up
21:59
look up pictures of this place it's
22:00
extraordinary the trees are gone
22:03
and inside the jungle there's a desert
22:05
[Laughter]
22:07
inside that there's an ocean why won't
22:09
you believe me
22:10
where at the bottom is another massive
22:12
cave
22:14
the russian doll of caves there's a
22:16
jungle with trees that are 30 meters
22:18
tall
22:18
um it has its own river um
22:22
it's got it's got a center park um and
22:25
all these new species have been found in
22:27
it anyway so
22:28
yeah honestly look up pictures of it so
22:30
they found a new type of gecko
22:32
a tree frog a new type of striped hair
22:34
living inside this cave completely
22:36
underground
22:36
the main cavern of it is so big it has
22:38
its own climate so it has rain clouds
22:41
which i imagine means it actually rains
22:43
inside this huge cave
22:44
where is this again uh it's in vietnam
22:46
wow can i just say one last thing yes
22:47
because i read this the other day i
22:49
haven't got the full details here but
22:50
there's a species of crab and they're um
22:53
polygamous
22:54
so the males have sex with loads of
22:55
different females and vice versa
22:57
if these crabs find a turtle shell with
23:00
just the right gap between the shell
23:02
and the bottom of the turtle that will
23:04
fit two crabs in
23:05
then a male and a female crab will go
23:07
and live inside the turtle shell and
23:09
they'll have
23:09
a monogamous relationship and they won't
23:12
have sex with anyone else and they'll
23:13
just live there
23:14
but anywhere else they live they'll have
23:16
loads of partners but if they find that
23:17
little niche then they'll kind of stay
23:19
together it's like a suburb
23:23
it's right if you move into the perfect
23:25
house then your relationship can be
23:27
repaired absolutely yeah
23:29
that's the lesson here
23:32
[Applause]
23:35
okay it is time to move on to fact
23:37
number three and that is my fact
23:39
my fact this week is that the original
23:41
edition of wisdom's cricketers almanac
23:44
was 112 pages long
23:46
and because the author wasn't sure what
23:47
to put in it was padded out with
23:49
accounts of the trial of king charles
23:51
the first
23:53
so if you don't know what this book is
23:55
this is published annually and it
23:57
is the ultimate cricketers book and the
23:59
current edition the 2016 edition
24:01
is over 1 500 pages long and so it's a
24:05
huge book has nothing but cricket but
24:06
the very first edition
24:08
wisdon was like i don't have enough
24:09
cricket to put in this but i need to
24:11
make it worth buying
24:12
so he added the accounts of the trial
24:14
from king charles of fort he also put in
24:16
battles of the english civil war and
24:18
also britain's canals
24:19
the size of them in length and also the
24:22
rules of quitting
24:23
yeah what is that uh quitting is where
24:25
you i think you have a quite is like a
24:28
kind of a circular thing a bit like a
24:29
horseshoe and you throw it to a stick
24:31
and it goes around the stick and if you
24:33
get it round the stick you get points
24:34
it's based on pub garden games
24:38
we should actually not only explain what
24:40
quitting is but probably for our
24:41
american
24:42
explain what quick it is i think so it's
24:44
like baseball on me a lot slower
24:46
okay that'll do yeah and there are there
24:48
are tea breaks
24:50
yeah and that i still find that insane
24:52
so i didn't know that because i didn't
24:53
really follow cricket but
24:55
halfway through a day of playing cricket
24:57
they all stop to have cups of tea
24:59
no you have tea as in food you would
25:00
have like yeah sandwiches and stuff
25:02
yeah to see to english people who know
25:04
about cricket that seems like the most
25:05
normal thing in the world
25:06
yeah i mean you go well i should know
25:08
that in theory yeah
25:09
yeah well actually do australia play
25:11
qriket anymore
25:15
interesting fact about the cricketers
25:18
almanac yeah
25:18
really interesting fact get ready hold
25:20
on to your seats um
25:22
so it's been published every year since
25:23
1864. and for the first six years it was
25:26
published
25:27
it was wisdom's cricketers almanac but
25:29
for the subsequent
25:30
however many years it's been wisdom's
25:33
cricketers
25:33
almanac with the apostrophe on the other
25:36
side of the s
25:37
which s wisdoms or cricketers
25:40
there's only ever been one wisdom so
25:42
it's always been for from one wisdom but
25:44
originally it was for only one cricket
25:46
it was for one cricketer for the first
25:47
six years
25:48
it was just aimed at one cricketer no
25:50
one knows who that cricketer is but
25:51
john wisdom the founder was quite an
25:53
interesting guy he was a cricketer and
25:54
his nickname was the little
25:56
wonder because he was five foot nothing
25:58
and he weighed seven stone when he
26:00
started his career and he was tiny
26:02
uh and yet in one match in 1850 he
26:04
bowled out all 10
26:05
of the opposite team in a single innings
26:08
which i think
26:09
is it's written online that this is the
26:10
only time that's ever happened in a
26:12
first class match
26:13
so they were all bowled out as in he hit
26:15
the stumps rather than them being caught
26:16
out or
26:17
you know got out another way there are
26:18
about 10 ways you could be good at
26:20
that's great yeah well done here yeah on
26:23
page 657
26:24
of the year 2000 edition the leicester
26:27
spin bowler matthew brimson
26:30
exposed himself and nobody noticed at
26:32
the time
26:33
and it went into the audition and then
26:35
about six days after it had been
26:37
published someone wrote in and said this
26:38
guy's middle stump is in this picture
26:40
matthew engel who was editor at the time
26:42
uh wrote about this and he said
26:44
uh in the 2000 leicestershire photo one
26:46
of their most obscure players was
26:48
laughing
26:49
oh having chosen to expose himself to
26:51
the camera his only contribution to
26:53
cricket history
26:54
the leicestershire the leicestershire
26:56
squad was large the page was small
26:58
so was our editorial team and so was the
27:00
appendage
27:01
[Laughter]
27:02
okay this guy got slammed by yeah
27:05
absolutely
27:06
it is kind of embarrassing that nobody
27:08
noticed for a week yeah yeah and then
27:10
so then he was asked to apologize and he
27:12
didn't and
27:13
apparently he said well he said it was
27:15
the editor's fault they should have
27:16
spotted it and engel
27:17
said oh do you think we need to we need
27:19
to employ a full-time penis spotter then
27:23
so did you know the first uh cricket
27:25
balls were rolled along the ground
27:27
that was the first way you bowled in
27:28
cricket really this is very early
27:30
yeah it's so it's more like croquet kind
27:33
of
27:34
yeah except you're allowed to roll the
27:35
balls along the ground
27:37
yeah yeah and the idea being that it was
27:38
still trying to hit stumps behind
27:40
yeah yeah yeah so there's um is it
27:42
french cricket where you throw very very
27:44
low
27:45
you reign for someone's legs yeah yeah
27:47
you're cranking their arm basically so
27:48
instead of having wickets that you aim
27:49
for you aim for their legs yeah
27:51
so but one and this is very exciting so
27:52
one of the first bowlers to pitch
27:54
uh was a guy called edward lumpy stevens
27:57
lumpy was his nickname and
27:59
there's a book got that nickname after
28:00
he exposed himself
28:03
um there's a book called the authors 11
28:05
and it says the name lumpy
28:06
may have come either from his ability to
28:09
pitch the ball on any protrusion on the
28:11
pitch
28:11
or his fondness for eating a whole apple
28:13
pie at a time
28:20
you know um in all the kind of uh if you
28:22
read
28:23
uh you know amazing things about uh
28:25
wisdom's cricketers almanac one of the
28:27
claims they make is that both pg
28:30
woodhouse
28:30
got the name jeeves from wisdom
28:32
cricketers almanac
28:33
and sherlock holmes was named after a
28:36
cricketer as well conan doyle used to
28:38
read
28:38
wisdom's cricketers almanac i can't see
28:40
any evidence that that's true though so
28:42
i think that's one of those myths that's
28:43
been going around
28:44
that's where they got them because uh
28:45
you do have quotes from pg woodhouse
28:47
saying that he knew
28:48
jeeves the cricketer and he was a big
28:50
fan of his and that's where the name
28:52
came from so
28:53
presumably he didn't need to discover
28:54
that in a book he already knew that
28:56
that reminds me that um blowfelt the um
28:58
bad guy in james bond is named after
29:01
henry blowfeld's father i think oh yeah
29:03
your family who is
29:04
a cricket commentator yeah henry
29:06
blaufelt's a cricket commentator um we
29:08
met him last year he came on our radio
29:10
show museum of curiosity
29:12
and um he told this story about how ian
29:15
fleming was in a gentleman's club in
29:16
london and was looking through the
29:18
members list and saw blowers his father
29:20
in there and decided to name him after
29:22
that
29:22
wow was there beef between them no i
29:25
don't think so because he named
29:26
goldfinger after the architect
29:28
goldfinger who he didn't like at all and
29:29
he tried to sue him didn't he like he
29:31
was very
29:32
goldfinger yeah goldfinger was very
29:33
angry about that yeah
29:35
um most famous copy of wisdom is a 1939
29:39
edition belonging to ew
29:40
swanton uh he was a cricket writer and
29:43
then he was taken prisoner by the
29:44
japanese
29:45
in the war and it was so popular with
29:47
all the other prisoners of war that
29:49
everyone used to borrow it and he had to
29:50
turn it into like a library book so
29:52
people could take it different times
29:54
and then it became really really thumb
29:56
through it was stamped not subversive
29:58
by the japanese little did they know all
30:00
the subversive political undertones
30:03
to those extensive scorecards
30:06
and now it's in the museum at lords wow
30:08
it does show
30:09
how poor the reading material was for
30:10
prisoners of war because it is not an
30:12
interesting book
30:13
it's a thick book you can recreate an
30:16
entire cricket match
30:18
just based on a few numbers and names
30:19
that's incredible that's true and you
30:20
could picture it in your head probably
30:22
going along right yeah it's like saying
30:25
that if you've got a good imagination
30:26
then anything's interesting i suppose
30:28
guys but it is a long list of schools
30:29
like saying the score of an opera isn't
30:31
an interesting read
30:32
come on when was the first edition this
30:36
was like
30:38
it's been in print every year so it's
30:40
it's a good book yeah but i bet not that
30:42
many people buy it if you ever read it
30:43
no
30:44
no loads of people buy it fifty shades
30:46
of grey and stuff like that
30:48
oh come on you can't you can't have you
30:50
can't compare like for like with
30:51
well i'm comparing those two now and i'm
30:53
saying one of them is probably a better
30:54
read than the other
30:55
and it's wisdoms
30:58
um do you know who invented bowling
31:01
edward
31:02
lumpy stevens sorry do you know who
31:04
invented overarm bowling
31:06
the theory goes it was invented by a
31:08
woman so women's qriket has a really
31:10
interesting history but uh
31:11
this is the claim that a woman called
31:13
christina willis used to bowl over onto
31:15
her brother
31:16
john who played for england this was in
31:17
the early 19th century
31:19
and she did it to avoid getting tangled
31:21
up in her skirts when she went underarm
31:23
and he took it to the matches he went on
31:25
to play and realized it was much more
31:26
effective than underarm
31:28
but yeah women's qriket was really
31:29
popular in the 19th century so
31:31
there were matches played all over
31:32
england that would get crowds of 3 000
31:35
which is quite large for
31:36
just an amateur qriket match um there
31:38
are pictures of women playing qriket
31:40
that go back to medieval times
31:42
and women were the first people to have
31:44
not read bulls and the reason was in the
31:46
late 19th century bulls would turn from
31:48
red to blue for women
31:49
because it was worried that lady
31:50
cricketers would swoon at the sight of a
31:52
red one
31:54
and just one last thing we said at the
31:55
top that americans won't really know
31:57
what cricket is but they do have a
31:58
cricket team that does play
32:00
internationally and they're called the
32:01
compton cricket team
32:02
so straight out of compton we know from
32:03
mwa is that it's about cricket
32:06
yes uh ice cube was actually a umpire
32:09
and uh yeah the
32:10
compton cricket team they've they say
32:12
that the aim of playing qriket is to
32:13
teach people how to respect themselves
32:14
and respect authority so they stop
32:16
killing each other
32:17
and the homies mission is to curb the
32:19
negative effect of gang activities
32:21
and they've been over to the uk a bunch
32:23
of times playing exhibition matches with
32:25
uh uk teams
32:26
so yeah so cricket is starting up there
32:28
first ever international game
32:30
usa versus canada no way really yeah
32:34
britain toured to uh the usa in the mid
32:36
19th century
32:37
and it would have become massive if it
32:38
wasn't for the civil war yeah
32:40
oh which you can read about in uh the
32:42
original edition
32:44
of different civil war oh okay
32:47
[Music]
32:48
[Applause]
32:51
[Music]
32:52
okay it is time to move on to our final
32:54
fact of the show and that is andrew
32:56
hunter murray
32:56
my fact is that fossilized poo is worth
32:59
more if it has what one collector calls
33:01
the classic poo look okay
33:04
so describe that well i think we all
33:07
know what the classic blue look is
33:09
so this is the fact that the guinness
33:10
world record has just been announced
33:12
for the largest collection of fossilized
33:15
poo
33:16
it's a man called george franson he
33:17
studied paleontology george lumpy
33:19
franson
33:20
um he owns 1277.
33:24
pieces of fossilized instrument uh 1277.
33:27
wow he's been collecting it for nearly
33:29
20 years so
33:30
and he says that the classic poo look
33:32
makes it more valuable along with um you
33:34
know distinctive
33:35
ripples and of size the bigger the best
33:37
the better the bigger the better always
33:39
yeah yeah yeah just what is a
33:40
distinctive rip is that like if
33:42
someone's name is written in the ripples
33:44
or that would be very romantic i think
33:47
yeah and they've all had to be examined
33:50
by a professional paleontologist
33:53
all 1277 pieces paleoscatologists aren't
33:56
they
33:57
people who study them yeah wow well
33:58
because the problem is a lot of people
34:00
like to buy
34:01
coprolites as they're called online um
34:03
but
34:04
most people can't really tell the
34:05
difference between a real one and a fake
34:08
one so a lot of people
34:08
are just buying rocks and they just
34:10
think they have it but it's just a rock
34:12
yeah and they're called
34:13
pseudo-coprolites yes and there's
34:16
real controversy about the biggest one
34:17
ever you know this
34:19
no it got sold in uh july 2014 it was
34:21
auctioned off it was 40 inches long
34:24
oh yeah uh that was quite a famous one
34:26
wasn't it very famous yeah it sold for
34:28
ten thousand dollars
34:29
uh and the the the auction said the
34:32
passer of this remarkable object is
34:34
unknown
34:34
and all this you know stuff but it came
34:37
from a place called the wilkes formation
34:38
which is where there was a swamp and
34:39
there
34:40
is a theory that actually it's plant
34:43
material and lumps of mineral
34:45
because sometimes things get uh lumps of
34:47
ash get turned into play and they get
34:48
squeezed through knot holes in trees
34:50
i mean how is it's not that much
34:52
different than a poo is it exactly it's
34:54
basically
34:54
yeah it's basically been pushed through
34:56
like a tube of toothpaste
34:58
so there is a theory that's there but
34:59
you'd have to cut it in two to take a
35:01
slice
35:02
because there'll be organic material in
35:04
there if it isn't copper like i found a
35:05
really good website
35:06
uh called the posium did you guys see
35:08
that no did no one see it no i've seen
35:10
them
35:10
isn't it great i didn't look at the
35:12
website i saw it referred to and i think
35:13
that's a funny name exactly so it puts
35:15
you off to look at it because you think
35:16
this is a silly name it's not going to
35:17
be good this is a guy who much like the
35:19
person you've just said with the largest
35:20
collection has dedicated his life to
35:22
understanding and cataloging and
35:24
reporting on
35:25
coprolites and it's fantastic it's an
35:27
incredible website
35:28
it's got pictures it's got all the
35:30
latest news stories i honestly i
35:32
highly recommend posium give us an
35:34
example of a brilliant posium news story
35:36
well he was telling you how you can make
35:37
your own
35:38
uh i know how to do that
35:41
i've been dedicating my life to making
35:43
my own
35:44
how you can make your own poo fossil in
35:47
time
35:48
so he says you and this was done in an
35:49
interview that he uh re
35:51
posted on his own site by jason
35:53
rosenfeld on silicon exit which is a
35:55
website
35:55
did this great interview with him so he
35:57
said that the way that you can make your
35:58
own
35:59
coprolite is that you start off by
36:00
eating a bunch of corn and peanuts
36:02
every few days and that will give the
36:04
copper light interesting inclusions and
36:06
make it worth more money when someone
36:07
finds it a special treasure
36:08
because that's easier to tell if
36:10
something is genuinely poo
36:12
because it has little bits sticking out
36:13
of it of insects or whatever that that
36:15
helps them identify it
36:16
and then you dig it into a very deep
36:18
hole uh and then put the soil over
36:20
immediately so nothing gets to it
36:21
that in theory is how you make your own
36:22
fossil poo if someone wants to start get
36:24
going on that weird thing to do or you
36:27
poo in the lake
36:28
how come it sinks through the water
36:30
right and it gets to the bottom and
36:32
there's
36:32
much less oxygen down there for it for
36:34
bacteria to eat it
36:36
so the hope is that over time anaerobic
36:38
bacteria gradually replace the mata with
36:41
um minerals but for best results you
36:44
have to poo
36:44
in the lake you have to get in the lake
36:46
do the poo get out of the lake
36:48
okay i mean there are other ways to make
36:50
your mark on this earth
36:53
it's true it's very unreliable because
36:54
you know the world would be covered in
36:56
poo
36:57
if they all survived so in fact it's
36:59
it's a really valuable substance right
37:00
because it used to be
37:01
important as fertilizer coprolite and so
37:04
when they discovered this then it became
37:07
something that people mined and there
37:08
are various places in the uk
37:10
where coprolite mining was an important
37:12
industry
37:13
so one of the main centers of this was a
37:15
place called shillington
37:16
in bedfordshire and this was in the mid
37:19
19th century its population doubled
37:21
because loads of people flocked it was a
37:23
bit like the gold rush it was the
37:24
uk equivalent of the gold people
37:27
whatever america is always better isn't
37:29
it
37:30
we've had a turd rush america if you go
37:33
to bedfordshire all the streets are
37:34
paved with
37:38
so the brilliant thing about this place
37:39
is it had this big boost to the local
37:40
economy and
37:41
it was actually a bit of a problem
37:42
because these pubs um multiplied because
37:45
coprolite miners were paid desperately
37:47
to drink away the memories of what they
37:48
spent their day doing
37:52
well they had quite a lot of fights so
37:54
there was tension and everything i mean
37:56
exactly at the gold rush can i just say
37:57
in the gold rush people used to go to
37:59
the pubs and pay for their drinks with
38:01
like little bits of gold
38:12
the great thing about this place is it's
38:14
called shillington
38:15
but its name was actually changed in the
38:17
1880s because it was worried it was
38:19
going to offend queen victoria
38:20
because it was called shitlington yeah
38:22
really yeah
38:23
yeah shuttlington was the heart of
38:26
shipmining
38:27
wow that's amazing hello to anyone
38:29
living in shillington
38:30
yeah he's learning that for the first
38:32
time is that a coincidence
38:34
like glamorous assistant like it's a
38:36
total coincidence it's a coincidence
38:38
yeah wow they discovered they only
38:40
discovered the turd seam
38:42
in the mid-19th century and it had been
38:44
around for hundreds of years before that
38:46
they called it the treacle mines locally
38:48
yeah they used to yeah that's the worst
38:50
euphemism i've ever
38:51
ever anything it's weird that there's a
38:54
seam
38:55
isn't it you would you would think that
38:56
they'd be scattered fairly evenly but
38:58
actually it all comes from a time when
38:59
the south of england was covered in
39:01
hundreds of meters of water
39:02
uh flooded and all the land animals died
39:04
so there's a lot
39:06
remaining from that period yeah yeah um
39:08
so andy the whole idea of coprolite
39:10
selling more if it looks
39:11
actually like a poo um i was reading
39:14
again in this interview from posium
39:16
that uh the reason that that's so
39:18
precious is actually most fossilized poo
39:20
the reason it doesn't
39:21
retain the shape of a poo is that most
39:23
animals will do it from a height
39:24
obviously and then
39:26
it experiences what he calls the
39:27
splatter effect so it's very hard to get
39:29
a poo shaped fossil because most of it
39:31
has splattered once it hits the ground
39:32
get in the lake
39:34
get in the lake is the answer yeah and
39:35
slow it down on the descent absolutely
39:37
yeah
39:38
you say they're so precious this guy
39:41
george franson
39:42
his most valuable coprolite is called
39:45
precious
39:47
just to make him a tiny bit more creepy
39:48
the idea is sitting by it again
39:52
because the splatter effect thing i just
39:53
said was he's talking
39:56
literally about precious in this
39:57
sentence is this the same guy
39:59
does he run posium i don't know whoa
40:03
i think that your guy runs the posium ah
40:07
i've just checked it knows what he's
40:10
talking about he sure does
40:11
um something related to coprolites are
40:14
regurgitalites
40:16
which is well what do you think
40:18
fossilized vomit correct
40:20
yeah um really good because often this
40:22
will be something
40:24
if you've got fossilized poo and you can
40:25
see what someone's eaten but it's
40:27
obviously been
40:28
through the digestive system if it's
40:29
fossilized vomit then obviously not been
40:31
quite as far through the digestive
40:32
system so you can see a lot better what
40:34
these things have eaten
40:36
um so there was a bit of vomit coughed
40:39
up by nick theo saw 160 million
40:41
years ago and it's still got little bits
40:43
of the like ammonites and stuff that
40:44
were in there
40:45
that's amazing yeah it's really that's
40:47
so the shame for the atheist who vomited
40:48
and thought god i hope no one remembers
40:50
this
40:50
moment 160 million years later they're
40:53
still reminiscing there's an even more
40:55
embarrassing thing we
40:56
think we have a 300 year old piece of
40:58
bishop excrement
41:01
wow this is in the news this week so um
41:03
there's a danish news
41:08
i don't think it's credible it was a
41:10
danish bishop called jens birchard and
41:12
he lived in a city called alborg
41:13
until 1708 and 80 years ago
41:16
archaeologists found in his private
41:18
midden a lump of stuff
41:19
and now it's been analyzed and we they
41:22
think it's bishop's poo
41:23
it could be the bishop's wife but it's
41:25
got
41:26
married
41:32
18th century denmark was a very liberal
41:35
place
41:38
one professor said this is a way of
41:39
making history through the back door
41:43
the word the treacle mine are they going
41:46
to put it probably in the local museum
41:48
but it's so embarrassing no i think it's
41:50
good to be proud of it
41:51
so there's there's a village called
41:53
bassingbourne hello to those in batting
41:55
born as well which was another home of
41:57
coprolite mining
41:58
and they wanted to erect a statue as a
42:00
monument to their village's great
42:01
history in 2005
42:03
and there were some contenders so they
42:05
could have had a heroin there are lots
42:06
of beautiful herons there
42:07
they thought about having a second world
42:09
war bomber uh because they had a strong
42:11
second world war history
42:12
and then one of the suggestions was a
42:14
large pooh and the village voted and
42:16
they voted for the poo
42:17
so they've got don't let the public vote
42:19
on things
42:20

00:24
there
00:35
[Applause]
00:40
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:43
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:45
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:47
covent garden my name is dan schreiber
00:49
and i am sitting here with james harkin
00:52
anna chazinski and andrew hunter murray
00:54
and once again we have gathered around
00:56
the microphones with our four favorite
00:58
facts from the last seven days and in no
01:00
particular order here we go starting
01:03
with fact number one and that is my fact
01:06
my fact this week is that the white
01:08
house's oval office is a giant weighing
01:11
scale
01:13
what do they use it for normally
01:16
weighing the president
01:18
to see how heavy he is no it's not
01:20
that's why you weigh things yeah that's
01:22
what i thought yeah it's to see that
01:23
he's there full stop so the secret
01:26
service need to monitor where the
01:27
president is at all times however
01:29
they're not allowed into the oval office
01:31
he doesn't want them in there so they
01:32
have to stand outside now when the doors
01:34
open they can see where he is but when
01:36
the door is shut they can't see where
01:37
the president is so if you look at
01:39
pictures of the oval office there is a
01:41
giant oval carpet that literally spans
01:43
the entire office room except for a few
01:45
inches to the wall and underneath it are
01:47
weighing pads that are connected to a
01:49
line that goes outside so the
01:52
secret service can see where he is in
01:54
the oval office
01:55
purely by where he's standing i think i
01:57
would get a load of objects that weighed
01:59
exactly the same as me and just keep
02:01
moving them around the office just to
02:03
wind up the secret service like indiana
02:04
jones at the beginning of the first film
02:06
yeah yeah but it's kind of like if
02:08
you've seen harry potter the marauders
02:09
map where they just follow the footsteps
02:11
on the map that's what the secret
02:12
service have to have except it's not on
02:14
the map because the things aren't
02:16
labeled as the president it's just
02:17
someone who weighs roughly the same
02:18
amount as the president right so it's
02:20
definitely obama's in the oval office or
02:22
someone who is also human-sized is in
02:25
the yeah or two people in the oval
02:26
office um it's just a way of making sure
02:28
that no one kidnaps him through a window
02:30
maybe they're allowed into the oval
02:31
office i don't know actually this is
02:33
this is a fact which i haven't seen in
02:35
many places it's from brad meltzer who
02:38
is a best-selling novelist but also
02:39
works at the white house and gives tours
02:41
and he did a huffington post piece where
02:43
he said here is secret service secrets
02:45
and uh that was the top one because he
02:48
invites lots of randomers into the oval
02:49
office i'd be a bit insulted as his
02:51
secret service if i wasn't allowed in
02:53
well i think it's more they're probably
02:54
allowed in at some point i don't think
02:55
it's like a total ban on secret service
02:56
people i think when he's working on a
02:58
day-to-day basis he doesn't want secret
03:00
services let's say they're doing
03:01
something really important which is
03:03
quite classified
03:04
and only the people who need to know are
03:06
in there so the other guys just stood
03:07
outside like playing cards or something
03:09
do you think do you think if he puts on
03:10
a bit of weight they start giving him
03:11
sly looks correct
03:14
are you sure about that biscuit mr
03:16
president
03:19
this article by brad meltzer also
03:21
mentions that anytime we hear about the
03:23
white house going under renovations of
03:25
an old room it's actually that the
03:27
secret service are conducting an
03:28
investigation and it's the only way of
03:30
giving an excuse to allow for the first
03:33
family to be out of the white house
03:35
while renovations are going on but it
03:36
actually means they're conducting an
03:37
investigation is that right it can't
03:40
always be that no no but i think there's
03:41
been a few cases it's a sort of like
03:43
inside knowledge thing that if there's
03:44
an investigation by the secret service
03:46
they will say currently under generation
03:50
that needs the president to be away it's
03:51
hard to research them because they're
03:53
quite open about some things but then
03:55
other things they're surprisingly secret
03:56
about it is surprising isn't it
03:59
that they would want to keep anything
04:00
from us it's controversial are they
04:02
telling the truth is the author telling
04:04
the truth we know a bit too much about
04:05
the secret service it seems recently it
04:07
would just be called the service
04:09
exactly yeah the open service yeah do
04:12
you know we have a lot of presidents and
04:13
leaders who like exercise and like
04:15
jogging obviously when they go out on a
04:17
jog they have to be accompanied by their
04:19
little secret service cabal who have to
04:21
jog with them and so for instance there
04:22
was an article i think this is in the
04:23
atlantic by someone who'd been in the
04:25
secret service under clinton and he said
04:27
it was a complete nightmare because
04:28
clinton loved running and they even
04:31
built him his own little running track
04:33
inside the white house grounds but he
04:34
didn't like it he liked to be out there
04:35
with the people so whenever clinton went
04:37
for a run a bunch of them all had to go
04:39
for a run as well but not just for a run
04:41
they have to go for a run carrying like
04:43
all their guns and weapons and be super
04:45
alert and always be ready to attack
04:47
someone if they attack the president and
04:49
so it sounds like absolutely hell
04:50
imagine if mulfara became president
04:55
oh my gosh who would you
04:57
that's that's true there are five people
04:59
disqualified from being president and
05:00
they're the five fastest people in the
05:02
world because surely you need five
05:03
people faster than the president but
05:04
most not in the five fastest people in
05:06
the world is it for running distances
05:08
which is what yes was doing i mean it's
05:10
hardly usain bolt becomes president
05:14
you can only run a hundred feet about
05:15
200 meters yeah what trouble could he
05:17
get it
05:18
but he will you will be able to get away
05:20
because at least the secret service can
05:21
bust in more people to start running
05:23
after the first 5000 meters president
05:26
farah has been running so when president
05:28
farah is running what they'll do is
05:30
they'll all be running in like a relay
05:33
and they pass the gun
05:34
[Laughter]
05:36
um yeah uh they they do have to it's
05:40
quite funny when you look into sort of
05:41
odd little things that they have to
05:42
prepare for in the safety of a president
05:44
like clinton uh going for his runs so do
05:47
you remember that famous incident where
05:48
george bush uh swallowed a pretzel and
05:50
started choking on it um apparently that
05:53
was a thing that they had to try and
05:54
work out how to avoid from ever
05:56
happening again because did they all
05:57
like suck the pretzels suck all the
05:59
pretzels first exactly
06:01
what do you do in that situation so the
06:03
owner just elects a new president
06:04
eventually
06:06
the only thing uh that they could come
06:08
up with was a sort of emergency push
06:10
button which i assumed he should have
06:12
had anyway the pretzel button no it's
06:14
not exclusively for pretzels
06:18
[Laughter]
06:21
um some of the presidential secret
06:23
service things i read i read in one book
06:25
um called personality character and
06:27
leadership in the white house i don't
06:28
know if it's true um that gerald ford
06:30
whenever he farted would blame the
06:32
secret service who are around him
06:35
jesus guys can you
06:37
keep a bit of dakar that's amazing
06:39
apparently that's true i guess that's
06:41
the was who was the um we spoke about
06:43
this before on the podcast there was one
06:45
president i think it was johnson who
06:47
would just if he was taking a piss would
06:49
just urinate on the secret service
06:51
member and say i can do this i'm the
06:53
president
06:54
i think the story went something like it
06:56
was lbj wasn't it i think what happened
06:58
was he went for a piss on the side of
07:00
the road when they were driving
07:02
somewhere and they kind of did like a
07:03
human wall around him and then there's
07:06
like a gust of wind and it blew the pee
07:08
onto one of the guys he said excuse me
07:10
mr president you're peeing on me and he
07:11
said well it's my prerogative to do that
07:13
i think that's what the story is anyway
07:15
okay it makes him slightly less
07:16
unpleasant than deliberately
07:18
yes yes
07:20
every time he needs to he calls one of
07:22
them into the office
07:25
there was an assassination tempt that
07:26
was made on ronald reagan
07:28
and uh it was made by john hinckley jr
07:31
and um one of the secret service guys a
07:34
guy called jerry parr is the guy who got
07:36
ronald reagan into the limousine and got
07:38
him off to and noticed that he blood was
07:41
coming out of his mouth and said we need
07:42
to get to the hospital right now uh so
07:44
he's said to have saved ronald reagan's
07:46
life um interestingly he became a secret
07:49
service officer because he had watched a
07:52
movie called code of the secret service
07:54
years before which starred ronald reagan
07:56
as a secret service guy no way yeah so
07:59
he ended up saving the life of the guy
08:01
who got him into it through so ronald
08:02
reagan saved his own life in a way
08:04
exactly
08:06
true that's incredible yeah
08:08
does that make a good movie in itself
08:10
yeah there's one thing about the british
08:13
secret services uh which i thought was
08:15
interesting so during the second world
08:17
war they obviously requisitioned a load
08:18
of you know country houses and castles
08:20
and things like that and stately homes
08:22
and one place they had was in scotland
08:24
it was called invalid lodge and it was
08:26
used for spies who weren't good enough
08:28
to spy but had already learned too much
08:31
secret information to be allowed to
08:32
leave
08:35
no way
08:37
and they had to stay there for the rest
08:38
of the war one of them one unfortunate
08:40
man who had signed up to spy he was
08:42
refused uh leave to actually go and spy
08:44
on the field because apparently he was
08:46
outstandingly ugly
08:48
so there was a report which said he'd be
08:50
recognized anywhere once scene never
08:52
forgotten
08:53
he has no teeth at all
08:56
except two gold tusks and two incisors
08:59
[Laughter]
09:01
poor man
09:02
[Laughter]
09:05
but they must they must have been as
09:07
well like by the time they all left
09:08
everyone would have known the secrets
09:10
that they were meant to be keeping as
09:11
well how come you're here well i got
09:13
told this thing about
09:15
there's one guy going no
09:16
come on mike
09:20
[Applause]
09:23
okay it is time for fact number two and
09:26
that is james
09:28
okay my fact this week is that because
09:30
male bumblebees rely on sight to find
09:32
females they sometimes find themselves
09:34
chasing after aeroplanes
09:36
[Laughter]
09:38
so presumably their eyesight is not very
09:40
good um well it's good
09:42
it's good for an insect
09:45
but it's not good for like an eagle oh
09:47
okay okay
09:49
bees do have kind of good i say um as in
09:51
they can see lots of colors
09:53
um but they people didn't realize they
09:55
could see colors and then carl frisch is
09:57
it cold that guy who worked out that
10:00
they did the waggle dance he's quite a
10:01
famous scientist yeah he got nobel prize
10:03
for that didn't you yeah and he did um
10:05
an experiment where he proved that they
10:07
could see colours by getting loads of
10:09
gray um like grey card and then one
10:12
colored card and always put the food on
10:13
the colored one they could always tell
10:14
where it was so they do have color site
10:17
so are you saying we need to stop
10:18
painting our aeroplane stripy black and
10:20
yellow
10:22
well there is
10:23
a stripy black and yellow airplane and
10:25
it is the smallest airplane that has
10:27
flown is it the size of a bee it's
10:29
called the bumblebee it's a bit bigger
10:31
it's uh it's eight foot uh ten inches in
10:34
length and the wingspan is five foot six
10:36
and it's tiny but if it's only one
10:37
purpose so small yeah
10:39
it's a biplane as well yeah
10:41
it's i mean you it does not look like it
10:43
should get off the ground it doesn't the
10:45
wings are so small but you shouldn't
10:46
think it has enough lift it it looks it
10:48
looks like your car has just had some
10:50
wings and not even as big as your car
10:52
because it fits five people in a car is
10:54
this yeah this is my arm's pen it's six
10:56
inches shorter than my arms bent across
10:58
the whole plane and
10:59
wing tip looking at that despite the
11:01
fact that that's black and yellow and is
11:03
the smallest plane i still think these
11:04
are idiots if they look at something
11:06
like that i think it's genuinely a b do
11:08
they chase after the plane once it's in
11:10
flight or is there a lot of bees at
11:12
heathrow it's in flight so i got this
11:15
from a newsletter of the bee
11:17
conservation society it's all about how
11:20
bees fight how male bees find the queens
11:23
and there are different ways of doing it
11:24
one way that they do it is by
11:26
all loads of males kind of leave their
11:28
smells around in a certain area their
11:31
pheromones and they kind of do it as a
11:33
gang and they put loads and loads of
11:34
stuff around and then the queen just
11:36
smells tons and tons of males and then
11:38
goes down and then they make that way
11:40
and another way is by kind of chasing
11:42
after a female so they'll see one in
11:44
flight and they'll chase after the
11:46
female
11:47
um and even though their eyesight is
11:49
kind of good for insects it's not quite
11:51
that good and so if they see something
11:54
which is
11:55
small looking but actually is far away
11:57
and is flying then they can sometimes
11:59
according to this newsletter mistake it
12:01
for an airplane do we know how far they
12:03
get towards the plane before
12:06
they realize their mistake and then they
12:07
have to casually turn around as though
12:09
they weren't chasing you like you're
12:12
trying to get onto a tube train and it
12:13
goes away and you pretend you weren't
12:15
bothered yeah yeah yeah
12:16
[Laughter]
12:18
or do they think that there's just
12:20
certain female bees out there or male
12:22
bees that are extremely fast
12:25
she was like
12:26
president usain bolt
12:28
the bees
12:30
no it didn't go that far into the
12:33
psychology of the bee
12:35
okay that makes more sense that it's at
12:37
a distance though i sort of can forgive
12:39
the bee slightly i think you're playing
12:40
it's like a beef and far away yeah sorry
12:43
just one more thing on the colors that
12:45
bees can see they can't really see red
12:48
um but they can see things in that
12:50
further in the spectrum so they can see
12:51
like ultraviolet and they can see a
12:53
little bit of yellow and orange uh they
12:55
can see blue they can see violet and
12:57
they can see another color which i saw
12:59
in a website was called b purple
13:02
and b purple is a color that we can't
13:04
see
13:05
which is like a combination of yellow
13:07
and ultraviolet really that's so cool
13:11
yeah
13:12
how do we know they can see it have we
13:13
have they done paintings and there's
13:15
just these big blank spots
13:18
i don't know i think you can if you know
13:20
the wavelength that something gives off
13:22
you can know that there is a color there
13:23
even if you can't see it yeah
13:25
so they can tell that it's a sort of
13:26
purplish in the spectrum area okay
13:30
that's so cool yeah i don't think you
13:31
could mix normal colors with ultraviolet
13:33
as well i guess i think but it makes
13:35
sense that you can doesn't it yeah i
13:37
don't know
13:39
as you mixed it the color would
13:41
gradually disappear because we can't see
13:42
stuff in the ultraviolet spectrum so it
13:44
would start it would be like putting an
13:45
invisibility cloak on manufacturers of
13:48
invisibility cloaks should take notes i
13:50
imagine that it doesn't quite work like
13:52
that
13:52
yeah i think that's absolutely right see
13:55
i'm not the only one to get slammed for
13:56
my harry potter references not being
13:58
right
13:59
do we know if there's anything in our
14:01
day-to-day life that is actually that be
14:04
purple but we obviously just see it as
14:05
purple well there are plants which have
14:09
colors that if you shine a uv light on
14:11
them you can see that they glow in a
14:13
certain way and that you can't see as
14:15
humans um but bees presumably can see
14:18
because they point towards the center of
14:19
the plant so they're pointing the bee to
14:22
the center of the plant but if you or i
14:23
were to look at it we would never see
14:24
those arrows okay but we would see it as
14:27
a different color we wouldn't see it as
14:28
nothing yeah it would be invisible yeah
14:30
you know that bees aren't the only
14:31
things that make honey i did not know
14:33
this
14:34
really wasps some wasps make honey today
14:38
yeah
14:38
um there's a particular species of it
14:41
called the brachiogastra mellificator
14:44
and apparently you can even eat that
14:45
wasps honey but i don't think it's
14:48
farmed because it's quite hard to
14:50
breed wasps i don't know why it's not
14:52
farmed a single pound of clover honey
14:54
requires 8.7 million flowers to be
14:58
manufactured
14:59
8.7 million flowers for one pound of uh
15:03
clover honey i go through so much honey
15:06
that's terrible flowers i mean the
15:07
flowers can do multiple multiple
15:09
pollinations it's all right oh okay have
15:11
you guys heard about and i only realized
15:14
as we were about to start recording that
15:16
actually this article's from 2015 so
15:17
potentially this already now exists but
15:19
um the highway for bees in norway
15:22
no in oslo and norway um they want to
15:25
make life better for bees basically and
15:27
they have a lot of green spaces and the
15:30
idea is that they want to create
15:32
networks so that the bees can go between
15:34
the green spaces through sort of like
15:36
alleyways that are created in buildings
15:38
and between buildings and so on
15:40
buildings yeah so like literally tunnels
15:42
inside but it's like yeah like trying to
15:44
get in the lift well no imagine in this
15:45
room yeah they would have their own next
15:48
lift
15:50
yeah they just it's like tunnels and so
15:52
on and the the bees can travel and find
15:54
their way to the next green place that
15:56
they're going to i think it might be
15:58
that but i thought it would be like like
16:00
rooftop gardens and stuff rather than
16:02
actually inside the building yeah i
16:03
probably made that up well they put
16:05
signposts on rooftop saying because
16:07
you're allowed to fly over there what
16:08
they do is their bees are in one place
16:10
they might want to go to another place
16:11
and they just make sure there's a
16:13
corridor of green spaces where they can
16:15
go so they put green on the rooftops
16:17
yeah and flowers that they like and
16:19
things like this because you can make
16:20
your garden really be friendly there are
16:21
all these specific flowers that you can
16:23
grow and you guarantee bees and london
16:25
is basically covered in bees
16:28
it's true basically yeah when you say
16:32
basically you mean not so many rooftops
16:35
hipster beehives in shoreditch no i mean
16:37
the royal festival hall has a beehive on
16:39
top of it harrods has a beehive on top
16:40
of it and there's a there's one specific
16:42
london beekeeper who goes to all of
16:44
these different places and is he does he
16:45
do parkour do you just
16:48
jump from one to the other but it is a
16:50
problem because it's really fashionable
16:51
to have a beehive and it's really cool
16:53
but what they haven't done is planted
16:54
8.7 million flowers so you get exhausted
16:56
beehives and they haven't got any you
16:58
haven't got enough
17:00
flowers and plants to pollinate what you
17:01
should actually do is plant a wildflower
17:03
meadow because that's not as sexy as
17:04
getting a load of bees off the internet
17:06
that's true if you do have a garden but
17:07
not many people do have gardens in
17:09
london but if you do have them you
17:10
should plant lots of flowers shouldn't
17:11
you yeah yeah
17:12
did you know there's such a thing as a
17:13
bee beautician
17:15
no beautician yeah so her job is to
17:19
brush bee's hair
17:21
to wash them with shampoo so bees are
17:24
when specimens are collected then
17:25
they're preserved in ethanol and that
17:26
makes them kind of soggy and slimy and
17:29
she has to prepare them to be fit for
17:30
display so she's got she's concocted
17:32
special bee shampoo and then she dunks
17:34
it in the bee shampoo and then she hangs
17:36
it out so she inserts a tiny tiny pin i
17:39
think at the hinge of one of its legs um
17:41
and then she's created a blow dryer so
17:44
yeah so she at first tried actual blow
17:45
dryers but she found that they were too
17:47
violent so it used to be
17:50
she's got the little legs left in the
17:52
clam
17:57
she does say so it used to blow their
17:59
limbs off and then she'd have to glue
18:00
the limbs back on which is the whole
18:02
thing through the limbs back on yeah but
18:04
she did say something interesting about
18:05
bees which is that they have lots of
18:06
split ends and so that's why she has to
18:08
use a special shampoo it's because they
18:10
get very clumpy and frizzy when they get
18:12
is this
18:18
i think it's like a mixture of water and
18:19
sodium bicarbonate or something okay but
18:21
wasps don't have split ends
18:23
so if you don't want frizzy hair be a
18:26
wasp it's a bit late for me really
18:30
[Applause]
18:34
okay it is time for fact number three
18:36
and that is andrew hunter murray my fact
18:39
is that running a leaf blower for 30
18:41
minutes creates more emissions than
18:43
driving a pickup truck 3 800 miles
18:48
no way that is incredible it does sound
18:50
unbelievably untrue doesn't it yes um
18:53
i'm following the words of james fallows
18:55
who's a correspondent at the atlantic
18:56
which is a very reputable magazine
18:59
uh and he has a campaign against these
19:01
things
19:02
uh well i guess if you were pro them you
19:03
wouldn't uh work out the emissions what
19:05
he says is that
19:07
about a third of the petrol they use
19:09
because they use petrol or gas in
19:10
america is vomited out in aerosol form
19:14
right and that gets mixed in with like
19:16
tiny particles of oil in the exhaust in
19:18
the droplets
19:19
so he has calculated that which if true
19:21
means that you could drive from covent
19:23
garden to jerusalem
19:25
wow well i think they compared it to a
19:27
particular type of pickup didn't sorry
19:29
yeah f-150 maybe it's an unbelievably i
19:31
think it is oh okay i think it is an
19:33
extremely efficient one but it's still
19:35
good i mean it's still amazing yeah yeah
19:37
yeah i thought the f-150 was a model of
19:39
casio watch is it not that's the f91w
19:42
great anyway so is he suggesting we all
19:44
try and clear our leaves with pickup
19:45
trucks because i think
19:48
if you use the f-150 and you can blow it
19:50
in the right way i guess he i guess you
19:52
could save technically on emissions you
19:54
could you gotta make the exhaust pipe
19:55
pointed the right direction imagine
19:57
trying to dry a bee with the leaf blower
20:01
there were legs everywhere
20:03
yeah so i mean people really hate these
20:05
things
20:06
yeah horrible yeah i think they make the
20:08
most disgusting noise and they should
20:10
all be banned i genuinely do think that
20:11
they're very very very loud and i think
20:13
they're unnecessary just rake your
20:14
bloody garden guys that's it must be
20:16
easier to blow it than rake it though
20:18
also you're blowing it into someone
20:20
else's spot aren't you what are you
20:22
doing or would you blow it into a pile i
20:23
think you blow it into a pile into a
20:25
pile okay i've got leaves all over my
20:27
bloody garden at the moment i would kill
20:29
for a blower your garden's small
20:31
i don't mean to be rude
20:34
well that is quite rude
20:36
all i'm saying is it's eminently
20:38
breakable like you couldn't fit a pickup
20:39
truck in your garden
20:41
i think uh kill for a blower is the most
20:44
rooting in that sentence by a long mile
20:49
oh dear um yeah but i can see that they
20:51
are i think my neighbors have got one
20:53
they are pretty loud you would if your
20:55
neighbors have got one you will
20:55
definitely know about it there is a big
20:57
loud noise coming from my neighbors
20:59
every now and then in the
21:00
autumn that's what it is you don't want
21:03
to pry well it could be that it sounds a
21:05
bit like an airplane taking off is that
21:07
what they sound like
21:08
unless do they have an airstrip in their
21:09
garden
21:11
well no it's a beer
21:18
in california there are 20 cities that
21:21
have banned
21:22
um wow
21:24
yeah there's i was reading an article by
21:25
the kendall family who are from
21:27
california are in a state that they
21:29
where they want to get it banned and
21:31
they were pointing out the reason it's
21:32
so annoying and this definitely does
21:33
ring true is that compared to a
21:34
lawnmower which can be as loud but
21:36
operates at the same kind of frequency
21:38
and volume the whole time leaf blowers
21:40
really go up and down don't they so you
21:42
can't predict it so you're constantly
21:44
being shocked by its volume increases
21:46
and decreases that's very interesting
21:48
that's what stresses you out how long
21:49
have we had leaf blowers by the way does
21:51
anyone know since about the 50s or 60s
21:54
yeah 50s except in japan in the 19th
21:57
century we know they used like bellows
21:58
that you use for a fire as leaf blowers
22:01
i
22:02
yeah i haven't seen a photo of the
22:04
bellows i tried to find one and i
22:05
couldn't find a picture of japanese
22:07
ancient leaf blowing bellows no but
22:09
there is an early book but the 1950s
22:11
reference is weird if anyone can tell us
22:14
if this is true wikipedia claims and
22:16
this is from a book called everything
22:18
you ever needed to know about leaf
22:19
blowers so you would have thought this
22:20
would be the authority on it but this
22:22
claims it was invented by a guy called
22:24
dom quinto who originally designed it in
22:26
the 1950s as an agricultural sprayer and
22:29
but people were taking out the spraying
22:30
device and just using it to blow their
22:32
leaves
22:33
but there's no evidence aside from this
22:35
book that this dom quinto chap ever
22:37
existed so if you are him always
22:39
offspring get in touch do you know who
22:41
invented the rake
22:43
no
22:44
is it mic rake
22:45
[Laughter]
22:47
no it's not mike rake i mean these are
22:49
always a bit dubious aren't they but
22:50
apparently the steel rake which is kind
22:53
of a bit springy and the modern day one
22:55
that's good for raking stuff with um it
22:57
was invented by a guy called chester
22:59
greenwood who also supposedly invented
23:01
earmuffs really apparently wow and he's
23:05
quite famous in north america in maine
23:07
that uh there's a certain town where
23:09
every year they have a celebration of
23:11
his inventing what do they do they put
23:13
on a load of earmuffs and girl and
23:14
breaking stuff up
23:16
yeah to drown out the noise of the leaf
23:17
blowers they're trying to protest
23:19
against they kind of do that i think
23:21
they kind of were earmuffs they have an
23:23
emf parade and stuff
23:26
i think they don't really they don't
23:27
really bother about the rake part of it
23:29
that much they're more bothered about
23:30
the earmuffs because he was quite young
23:31
when he invented them he was like 17 16
23:34
or 17
23:39
maine sounds like a very exciting place
23:41
to live doesn't it if that's their
23:42
highlight of the year well the thing is
23:44
it's cold and they have a lot of trees
23:46
so earmuffs and rakes are the kind of
23:47
things you might invent if you live
23:48
there and they have every major horror
23:51
story that we know of in popular culture
23:53
set there through stephen king because
23:55
he lives in bangor maine so it the clown
23:57
is from maine and okay you can't credit
23:59
an entire state for one person that it's
24:02
produced
24:05
but well done man there is a cool thing
24:06
you can do with leaf blowers which is
24:08
turn them into a hovercraft can you yeah
24:11
there's a very cool video online of a
24:13
texan man called ryan craven so shout
24:15
out to texas who created ryan craven
24:19
who has trapped sort of four of them
24:21
together into a kind of platform and he
24:22
puts a skateboard across the platform
24:23
and it hovers very very low off the
24:25
ground but it does hover you know on
24:27
fallen leaves um i was actually looking
24:29
at this in the tv show we did
24:31
this week no such things in news um we
24:34
were talking about channels that's still
24:35
available on iplayer i think it might be
24:36
yeah and actually if you're
24:37
international it's on youtube
24:39
but that's besides the point but how
24:40
would you find that oh you go to no such
24:42
thing as the news.com thanks for asking
24:45
yeah anyway we recorded a tv show this
24:47
week and we mentioned chernobyl
24:50
and leaves in chernobyl don't decompose
24:53
because the radioactivity means that the
24:55
bacteria are no longer there can no
24:56
longer survive so they can't decompose
24:58
the leaves and so there aren't you know
25:00
that it's missing this fungus and the
25:02
worms and um the microbes and stuff like
25:04
that and so it's just building up this
25:06
huge floor of dead leaves and at the
25:08
moment if a forest fire started which
25:10
can't happen at certain temperatures it
25:12
would be a complete disaster and would
25:14
spread radiation
25:15
much much further and wider than it is
25:17
already because it would just catch fire
25:19
to all these dry dead leaves
25:21
that's like in australia um a sort of
25:24
aussie non-nuclear version of that is
25:26
the eucalyptus tree because
25:28
their
25:29
uh leaves when they drop off the tree
25:31
they have a kind of uh sort of what's
25:33
called like a toxic name palm thing
25:35
about them in that they're too hard to
25:37
break down for all the insects and
25:38
animals so they sit there dry as hell
25:41
and if a forest fire starts and it hits
25:43
a eucalyptus patch that will just go
25:46
massively up in flames it's just sitting
25:47
there waiting to be caught on fire and
25:49
this must be because a eucalyptus tree
25:51
is one of the trees that love being set
25:52
on fire because they spread their seats
25:54
yes they love to be set on fire they
25:55
sort of have an inner tree waiting to
25:58
break out of the bigger tree and uh
26:01
forest fires is what brings that to
26:02
happen i think they're pretty much
26:03
ambivalent about the whole thing
26:06
do you think they don't even know their
26:07
trees
26:10
in 2011 someone patented a glove rake
26:12
which uh is really cool it's a normal
26:15
glove except it's got these five long
26:16
you look a bit like edward scissorhands
26:18
except we were able to break hands and
26:19
you could just go around breaking stuff
26:21
up with
26:22
knees you would have your back
26:23
on your hands and knees it's not going
26:24
to be nice i mean because it's the
26:26
middle of autumn yeah it's going to be
26:27
dumped edward ray hands by the way would
26:29
have been really useful in that scene
26:30
where edward scissorhands cuts all the
26:32
hedges
26:34
he could have been on the side cleaning
26:36
up
26:38
[Laughter]
26:41
guys why are we all called edward
26:45
we're not related we've got different
26:46
surnames
26:49
they've all got to say they've
26:51
[Laughter]
26:57
[Laughter]
27:00
i've never noticed before the moment
27:01
where we come up with the title of an
27:03
episode i think no such thing as edward
27:08
[Applause]
27:12
okay it is time to move on to our final
27:14
fact of the show and that is chizinski
27:17
yes my fact is that early humans had
27:20
spiky penises
27:23
that is insane how early i actually
27:25
couldn't believe just a couple of weeks
27:26
ago
27:28
[Laughter]
27:30
no this was a study a study on human
27:32
genes that was done in 2011 and it found
27:35
that about 700 000 years ago so um
27:38
before our common ancestor split into
27:40
modern humans and neanderthals then we
27:42
have the gene that carries
27:44
penis spines and then that gene seems to
27:47
have been deleted when we evolved into
27:49
what modern humans today um but lots of
27:51
other like almost all other primates
27:53
still have penis spines
27:55
yeah they do except for spider monkeys i
27:57
think all primates have penis spines and
27:59
what what do the spines feel like as in
28:04
if i
28:05
if i gripped a chimp's penis would i
28:07
would i be arrested yeah
28:09
would i cut my hands would the palms of
28:11
my hands be sliced the ones on promotes
28:13
i think are more bumpy some some animals
28:16
have already spiky spines like cats i
28:17
think do but i think they're more like
28:19
lumps slightly blunt spikes you've never
28:21
seen the film elbows is a penis haven't
28:23
you
28:27
so just to go into quickly the reason
28:30
that um we might well that men might
28:32
have had spiky penises in the past we're
28:33
not totally sure about it but we think
28:36
it might be because um what it can do is
28:39
it can help clear out rival sperm from a
28:43
female vagina so uh if you get the
28:45
spikes in then as it's sort of
28:47
retracting they scrape the edge of a
28:49
vagina and they'll bring out any sperm
28:50
that's been left in there by someone
28:52
else and they can break through a little
28:53
sperm sac and break it open to make this
28:55
that's true some animals isn't it i
28:57
think um i think dragonflies have like
29:00
spade shaped penises that they do
29:03
it must be really hard to study the
29:04
evolution of human penises um because
29:08
the lack of bone means that how can you
29:11
how can you you just there's nothing so
29:13
ironic
29:14
no bone or boner
29:17
you've said that a few times
29:19
i've got to change my strap line on a
29:21
lot of dating sites
29:26
we might have had a bone i must stop
29:28
saying we in reference to our penises
29:31
men might have had a bone we don't know
29:33
but um other primates do have a penile
29:35
bone i think don't they and it has a lot
29:36
of advantages having a bone there
29:38
because it means you can push it out
29:39
much quicker than having to wait for the
29:41
blood to engorge it just flip right out
29:43
and it can stay out for longer um and
29:46
i think richard dawkins
29:49
[Laughter]
29:52
richard dawkins in the selfish gene
29:55
wrote that the advantage of humans not
29:57
having this is that it having to
30:00
get blood flowing in there shows that
30:02
you've got like a healthy blood flow
30:04
shows is kind of a sign of good health
30:06
so women are more attracted to it so
30:08
that might be why we've men have evolved
30:10
okay penis is without the bone because
30:11
it's harder to get it blown up i've
30:13
heard so uh in place of the bone there
30:16
is a new thing that they're testing out
30:18
which is a metal rod so some men could
30:20
now have a metal rod inside their penis
30:23
and the idea is for it's done do you
30:25
remember where it's done andy in
30:26
hospitals mostly but
30:30
if it's being offered to you in a bar
30:31
you should be very careful
30:33
so the idea is that this is for people
30:35
suffering from erectile dysfunction and
30:37
if they've gone through various courses
30:39
they're gonna then say on health
30:41
services or whatever they will say you
30:42
can have this and the idea is that it's
30:44
a little metal rod inside but when you
30:46
want an erection you can press a button
30:48
like a remote control and it preheats
30:50
this metal bar to a heat point where it
30:52
expands within you you are never going
30:55
to get on a flight are you
30:56
[Laughter]
31:00
i mean that's just not it's just not
31:02
going to happen
31:03
every single time yeah you're gonna set
31:06
it off they're gonna get that paddle
31:07
thing you're gonna go up and down your
31:09
body and get to the get to the rod yeah
31:11
what and you think you just go never
31:12
mind i'm going home doesn't matter i
31:14
think that would happen yeah yeah the
31:15
other thing is you can get a bit of
31:16
cartilage put in there if you have
31:18
erectile problems and then you have to
31:19
just kind of maneuver the penis into
31:20
position so it's kind of permanently
31:22
erect from that point and that's in uh
31:24
mary roach's book bonk which is about
31:26
science and sex and it's it's an amazing
31:28
book oh it's an incredible book yeah so
31:30
this is partly about how um
31:33
males of various species manage to get
31:35
rid of competition because the spines
31:37
are often used to scrape um to scrape
31:40
other sperm out of the vagina yeah and
31:42
so i was looking at other ways that you
31:43
get rid of the competition and one is
31:45
that in mice sperm club together as a
31:48
group to beat rival sperm it's exactly
31:51
like my west side
31:55
yeah
31:56
the jets are the sperms
32:00
it's exactly like in a cycling race
32:02
which james will know more about where
32:03
um they move faster if they move as a
32:05
group so they can tell if they're the
32:07
sperm that belong to the same person and
32:09
all the sperm that belong to that person
32:10
get together and all the sperm that
32:11
belong to another person get together
32:13
this is in these mice inside this female
32:14
mouse yeah and so they as a group they
32:16
move much faster than they do
32:18
individually what's that called it's
32:19
like the
32:20
peloton peloton effect it's a peloton
32:22
it's the peloton of sperm
32:24
and then when they get near the finish
32:25
line suddenly they all start someone
32:27
breaks away yeah and then the mark
32:28
cavendish sperm wins exactly yeah so
32:31
they're just programmed it'll be
32:33
smell or no what is it what is it how do
32:35
they know this how can they how can they
32:36
grow they're just a cell yeah yeah well
32:40
cells can be programmed to do things uh
32:42
so i imagine it must be that it's inside
32:44
the dna of the cell
32:45
um that has instructions of what it
32:48
should do it makes the makes the tails
32:50
wag yeah and also if they have their
32:52
specific rendition of keep cool from
32:54
west side story
32:57
which is the best song to sing for a
32:58
sperm
32:59
because you do need to keep lower than
33:01
the ambient temperature of the body yeah
33:03
it's weird that they weren't the lyrics
33:04
in the original
33:08
[Applause]
33:12
okay that is it that is all of our facts
33:14

[Music]
00:38
[Applause]
00:42
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:44
no such thing as a fish
00:46
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
00:48
qi offices in
00:49
covent garden my name is dan schreiber i
00:51
am sitting here with anna chazinski
00:54
james harkin and alex bell and once
00:56
again we have gathered around the
00:58
microphones with our four
00:59
favorite facts from the last seven days
01:01
and in no particular order
01:03
here we go starting with you
01:06
james my fact this week is that
01:08
scientists at mit
01:10
have invented an artificial intelligence
01:12
that can see into the future
01:14
but it can only tell two seconds into
01:16
the future
01:17
[Laughter]
01:19
totally useless what's it reported i
01:21
knew you were gonna say that
01:24
so this is this is really cool so what
01:27
they did was
01:28
they got this um algorithm to watch um
01:31
tv shows like the office
01:33
and the big bang theory okay and it
01:36
watched what people did when they met
01:37
each other so did you go in for a hug or
01:39
a kiss or a handshake or a high five
01:42
and then when you showed them a picture
01:44
of two people coming near each other it
01:46
could work out what they were gonna do
01:47
whether they were gonna high five
01:49
whether they were gonna hug whether they
01:50
were gonna kiss or whatever so that's
01:52
basically as far as this has gone so
01:54
far it's still pretty good for an ai
01:56
yeah and i'm surprised it was able to do
01:57
this based on the office and the big
01:58
bang theory both of which are about
02:00
totally socially inept people yeah who i
02:02
wouldn't have thought give those
02:03
correctly
02:03
the best source material to use maybe it
02:06
made the ai feel more comfortable
02:08
watching something closer to their kind
02:10
of robotic
02:10
way so okay we're not so different you
02:13
and us humans
02:14
yeah yeah and also i think that is quite
02:16
a useful thing because
02:18
how many times have you gone in for a
02:20
hug to someone and they tried to
02:21
high-five you and slap you in the face
02:23
or
02:24
you know all the the kiss slash um
02:26
handshake thing is pretty awkward at
02:28
times well in the article it said that
02:29
the ai could only get it right 43
02:31
of the time which i was reading wasn't
02:33
very hype but then i realized i get it
02:34
right about maybe
02:34
two percent of the time so apparently
02:38
normal humans get it right 71
02:40
of the time yeah but obviously that
02:41
doesn't apply to you the thing is alex
02:43
goes in for the kiss every single time
02:47
and it will get better won't it because
02:48
it'll keep on watching it'll get better
02:50
and 43 the time versus 71 of the time is
02:53
not that bad considering
02:55
all they've done is got it to watch
02:57
these two things yeah whereas most
02:58
humans have had a lot of social
03:00
interaction to get to where we are which
03:02
is still not that good
03:03
the thing it might do in hospitals if it
03:05
gets really good is anticipate a couple
03:07
of seconds in advance whether someone
03:09
for instance is about to fall over
03:10
like an old person on the way to the loo
03:12
and then swoop in and catch them
03:14
maybe they should show him lots of
03:15
episodes of miranda
03:19
where she falls down all the time yeah
03:22
intermediate level you can see it coming
03:24
off if you watch miranda it would try to
03:25
save you every step you took
03:27
yeah yeah if you if you saw a mr bean
03:30
episode it could probably either explode
03:32
or not let you out the house
03:35
check this out there's another ai
03:37
robotic thing
03:38
which plays uh scissors paper rock
03:42
and beats humans a hundred percent of
03:44
the time no
03:45
yes 100 it has a hundred percent breaks
03:48
the rules though this makes me so angry
03:49
at this machine it doesn't break the
03:50
rules yeah it does it waits to see what
03:52
you're doing and then very quickly
03:54
yeah no no no no no no no no that's not
03:55
quite right because it's
03:57
it it technically is doing that but if
03:59
you're a good game player as well you
04:01
would be looking at someone's hand to
04:02
monitor where you think they're gonna go
04:04
so it has a camera on it which is able
04:06
to work out hand movements of people
04:08
and what most likely handshake they're
04:10
about to take but it can make a split
04:11
second decision
04:12
so that it's at the same time it's a
04:14
microsecond afterwards because it's seen
04:16
the way your hand is moving so it's
04:18
decided a microphone is not
04:19
indistinguishable to humans of course
04:21
but it is
04:22
cheating it is because rock paper
04:24
scissors is fundamentally a game of
04:25
chance
04:26
but you it's like a coin toss you're
04:27
supposed to try and you use it to decide
04:29
things
04:30
no no because all it's doing is it's
04:32
calling your tell it's seeing the hand
04:34
shape that you're bringing
04:35
that's not cheap it is 100 of the time
04:37
becomes cheating because you can work
04:39
out what's more or less likely 100
04:40
million
04:49
[Laughter]
04:50
it does look like you're about to
04:52
high-five dan but i'm not sure
04:56
so a robot was arrested recently um in
04:59
september
05:00
for taking part in a political rally
05:02
seems a bit dodgy this was in russia
05:03
and this is actually a robot that i
05:05
think might have come up before you guys
05:06
might have heard about it's
05:08
promobot and it's the one that escaped
05:10
from its
05:11
enclosure twice in i think about july
05:14
this year
05:14
oh yeah but didn't we didn't we work out
05:16
that that was actually
05:18
the clues in the name promo yeah yeah
05:21
but then it did it again
05:22
and then the mechanics at promobot said
05:24
that they were trying to reprogram it to
05:26
stop it escaping
05:27
so they're just really sticking to their
05:29
story um but now it's taking part in a
05:31
political rally because this robot
05:32
supported parliamentary candidate
05:34
valerie kalachev
05:35
so went to moscow and started collecting
05:37
people's views on politics asking them
05:39
what they thought
05:40
again it escaped by itself and was just
05:42
going around interviewing i believe it
05:43
might have been programmed to do this
05:44
kind of dream to be a political
05:46
correspondent
05:47
after it was arrested did it escape from
05:49
prison it probably has done now yeah
05:52
they did put handcuffs on it apparently
05:54
they must have like idiots those
05:55
policemen handcuffing a robot
05:57
that would have been a fun moment of an
06:00
otherwise probably depressing arresting
06:02
situation
06:03
[Laughter]
06:06
i had to like handcuff you know 25
06:08
people at a political protest
06:10
but i did handcuff a robot and that
06:12
actually really made me smile
06:15
this is just one bit of delight you're
06:17
right um also in robot news uh
06:20
they uh have set this year in july a new
06:23
uh dancing robot guinness world record
06:26
is it a thousand and seven robots
06:28
danced together for a minute and that
06:30
was what was needed
06:31
and uh so that it was a synchronized you
06:33
can see a video online it did really
06:35
cool it was in china
06:36
and it was a um it was a qingdao
06:39
beer festival so it was i guess they
06:41
were trying to just get headlines for it
06:42
but you can see all these
06:44
tiny little robots the kinds that you
06:45
would buy in a shop um that makes sort
06:47
of small movements they're all doing a
06:48
dance and
06:49
some fall over so they're discounted but
06:51
they're still dancing while they're
06:52
talking i wonder if they count you know
06:53
those like
06:54
a flower and when you play music they
06:56
just kind of dance to the music
06:58
do you remember them from there yes if
07:00
you put and 1050 of those down would
07:02
that be able to technically beat the
07:03
record i think they're effectively
07:05
that's the robots effectively that they
07:07
used anyway yeah they were
07:08
built to dance they can't do anything
07:10
else yeah so they put down a thousand
07:11
forty but uh they lost thirty three
07:15
um i have danced with a robot you have a
07:17
video you have asimov right
07:19
[Laughter]
07:23
no yeah we had um asimo who was built by
07:26
honda
07:26
yeah obviously and he came on qi and we
07:29
during the warm-up
07:30
i did a little dance with him and he
07:32
kind of just follows your dance patterns
07:34
i think i think that's how it worked
07:36
i know a thing about asimo which a
07:39
guest on our show from quite a few
07:41
episodes ago leaving skyra
07:42
belgian comedian and scientist he was
07:44
telling me that asimo they've
07:46
programmed him to speak something like i
07:48
don't know let's say 30 languages it
07:50
might be less so that whenever they
07:51
bring him over to different countries
07:52
for conferences he's able to do a
07:54
lecture
07:55
in their language but he has one special
07:57
setting for when he's in italy
07:58
which is that they've programmed his
08:00
arms to gesticulate
08:02
so that when he's talking it feels more
08:04
because that's how in italy they feel
08:05
more
08:06
humanized uh than the robot standing
08:08
still that's quite cool
08:09
yeah i love it and he's also watched
08:11
episodes of the office so you can do the
08:12
david brent dance
08:15
um okay here's something amazing about
08:17
telling the future
08:18
okay um there was a study done by a u.s
08:21
intelligence
08:22
group called the good judgement project
08:25
and what they did is they got a load of
08:27
people about
08:27
more than 2 000 people and they started
08:30
asking them things about world events
08:31
like will robert mugabe still be the
08:34
head of zimbabwe
08:35
uh in two years time or whatever like a
08:37
load of different things
08:39
and a lot of people made guesses and
08:41
eventually they siphoned off the top two
08:43
percent who were doing the best
08:45
and then they put them in a separate
08:47
group and compared them to everyone else
08:49
and found that that group was four times
08:51
more accurate than anyone else and
08:54
they're saying that this
08:55
proves that in humans there are it's a
08:57
thing called super forecasters
08:59
and these are people who are better than
09:01
normal humans are foreseeing the future
09:04
wow and are they all on brighton pier
09:06
with a crystal ball charging people 10
09:08
pounds to read their fortune
09:10
it's weird they all had different jobs
09:12
like one of the best ones was a
09:13
pharmacist they come from different
09:15
walks of life and everything so we need
09:16
to round these people up and take them
09:18
all to the met office
09:18
they should all be the weather
09:19
forecasters if they're
09:24
[Music]
09:26
[Laughter]
09:32
he's warning us about a massacre
09:36
[Laughter]
09:40
apparently what these guys are
09:41
particularly good at is being
09:42
open-minded
09:44
um which you can kind of imagine it
09:45
means that they're they're they don't
09:47
let their world views
09:48
judge that their predictions and also
09:51
they change their mind fast
09:53
and often so um whenever
09:57
to like correct their wrong prediction
10:01
so they get something wrong one time and
10:04
a normal human might kind of stubbornly
10:06
stick with the same
10:07
similar kind of predictions but then
10:08
these people go well actually you know
10:10
i've seen that that happens in the past
10:11
now so i'm going to change my mind this
10:12
time oh okay
10:13
i was thinking more like football
10:14
matches where they're like okay
10:16
manchester united is going to win this
10:17
one liverpool school like you know i'm
10:18
actually thinking that maybe uh
10:20
oh uh i'm gonna go for rock no scissors
10:22
[Laughter]
10:24
we need to put one of those people
10:26
against the machine
10:33
okay it is time for fact number two and
10:35
that
10:36
is alex my fact this week is that big
10:39
ben
10:39
is falling over we should get out of
10:41
here
10:42
[Laughter]
10:44
we're not that close no we're out of
10:45
reach yeah yeah um what do you mean
10:47
okay uh well technically the elizabeth
10:50
tower not big ben
10:50
obviously don't write in but when they
10:52
built it when they built the house of
10:54
parliament
10:55
they built it straight obviously and
10:56
then i think as soon as the building
10:58
settled it was a little bit leaning um
10:59
and it's got
11:00
leaner and leaning as in it's been
11:02
leaning over more and more away from the
11:04
houses of parliament
11:04
and they've worked out that uh if it
11:07
keeps falling over at the rate it is
11:09
falling over
11:09
in about four thousand years time it'll
11:11
be leaning as much as the leading tower
11:12
of pisa really
11:14
how many years uh four thousand so it's
11:16
not like super urgent
11:18
so they are going to restore it now
11:19
aren't they there's this big houses of
11:20
parliament
11:21
restoration going on which is costing
11:23
billions and they're about to start
11:24
working on that as well the elizabeth
11:26
tower so anyone overseas
11:28
who wants to see it in its pure
11:29
unscaffolded form you better get over
11:31
quick because beginning of january 2017
11:34
they're going to start scaffolding yeah
11:35
and it's going to be scaffolded for
11:36
three years
11:37
but it's going to take six months to
11:39
just put the scaffolding up
11:40
is that nuts yeah six months what and
11:43
they're going to push it back
11:44
the right way no i think they're doing
11:46
basic restoration i don't think they can
11:47
do anything about that i don't think so
11:48
no
11:49
but um it's it's causing cracks in the
11:51
offices next to it because it's
11:52
basically pulling the wall away
11:54
they're gonna fill those up for a start
11:56
the um big ben tower has a prison in it
11:58
that they keep naughty mps in
12:00
does it talk about they have a prison
12:03
room
12:03
uh if an mp breaches codes of conduct
12:05
they'll get put in there
12:07
and the last time it was used in 1880
12:08
was when uh charles bradleau an atheist
12:11
refused to swear allegiance to queen
12:13
victoria on the bible
12:14
wow and who's kept in the prison room
12:16
overnight and no mp
12:18
every hour every quarter of an hour it
12:20
rings you're right you're right you're
12:22
not going to get much sleep how you
12:23
happy torture
12:24
that's like it's like how they play
12:25
barney guantanamo yes
12:28
that'll be why mps behaves so well these
12:30
days because they're
12:31
terrified of the noise um it used to
12:34
make a different sound didn't it when it
12:36
was originally built
12:37
uh it chimed differently so it was built
12:39
in may 1859
12:41
no so it was made and the uh thing that
12:44
crashes into the bell to make the
12:45
bonging sounds
12:46
worked for a few weeks and then
12:48
immediately broke the bell
12:49
and the crack in the bell is still there
12:51
from where i broke it and so they had to
12:52
realign it didn't they which for some
12:53
reason took them three or four years
12:55
and then they made it bang the bell on a
12:57
different point of it
12:58
so we'll never hear the tone that big
13:00
ben originally made did you know that
13:01
the big ben chimes have words they have
13:03
lyrics
13:05
yeah they do it's uh it's half past
13:08
two it's quarter to nine
13:12
it's all through this hour lord be my
13:14
guide and by thy power no foot shall
13:16
slide
13:17
hang on but it doesn't say that i've
13:19
never heard those words broadcasting
13:20
from nothing
13:21
performed no yeah that's true here's
13:22
another one play up pompey
13:24
the portsmouth fans sing play up pompey
13:27
pompey play up
13:28
like that same tune just play up has him
13:31
play better
13:32
so oh pompey is a nickname for
13:34
portsmouth fc got it
13:36
did you know that you can hear big ben
13:37
chime before it chimes
13:39
oh that's is that those future
13:40
predicting people again no it's not
13:42
no it's absolutely normal because that's
13:44
an easy prediction i feel like it's
13:46
going to chime in about
13:47
five seconds it's not no so
13:50
uh the bbc for anyone who doesn't know
13:52
the bbc broadcast the bongs
13:54
live at six i think six o'clock uh every
13:56
day yeah so they have they have a
13:58
speaker installed inside the tower and
13:59
that has direct link to the bbc
14:01
broadcasting center
14:02
so if you have a uh an fm radio
14:06
and you go and stand even really close
14:07
to big ben so like on westminster bridge
14:09
for example and you listen to the fm
14:10
radio
14:11
the fm radio signals are so much faster
14:13
than the sound waves in the air
14:14
that the sound of the bomb will go into
14:17
the microphone all the way to the bbc
14:19
and be broadcast all the way to your
14:20
radio faster than it just coming through
14:22
the air at you
14:23
so if you were standing on westminster
14:24
bridge and you listened to an fm radio
14:26
and big ben chimed you would hear on the
14:28
radio a split second before you would
14:30
actually hear it in your other ear
14:31
that's really cool it's really cool
14:33
yeah well done the radio doesn't get
14:35
enough appreciation
14:36
of the internet it's so impressive um
14:39
do you know on wikipedia there's a big
14:40
long list of um
14:42
leaning towers so you can just see every
14:44
leaning tower in the world
14:45
there's a nice one in australia this is
14:47
called the leaning tower of jinjin
14:49
it's purposefully built to be leaning
14:51
and it's built at the gravity discovery
14:53
center
14:54
and they wanted to make it so that when
14:55
you went to the gravity discovery center
14:57
that you could
14:58
replicate by climbing the top galileo's
15:00
experiments on the leaning tower
15:02
yeah so you could actually go up and you
15:04
drop you drop stuff down a shield
15:06
the idea with galileo is that he
15:08
supposedly although we don't think this
15:10
happens
15:10
dropped two bowls from the um leaning
15:12
tower of pisa and they were different
15:14
weights but they landed at the same time
15:16
and that was proof that
15:17
things will fall at the same rate not
15:19
dependent on the mass
15:20
you know uh buildings in amsterdam tilt
15:23
deliberately as well
15:24
do they and do you know where that is no
15:26
so these are buildings in amsterdam that
15:28
face the canal they're many hundreds of
15:29
years old
15:30
and the reason they're built a slight
15:31
tilt is that they're tilting towards the
15:33
canal
15:34
and that's so that they could winch good
15:35
stuff from the canal to the upper
15:37
windows
15:38
and it's also so that uh if if houses
15:40
flooded which they often did
15:41
then the first couple of floors might
15:43
get full of water and you need to
15:44
evacuate your goods really quickly
15:46
and faster than carrying them all
15:48
upstairs was if you just got them onto a
15:50
platform outside the window
15:51
and winch those goods up to a higher
15:53
level and the only way you can do that
15:54
without breaking the windows on the way
15:56
up and having it crash into the wall is
15:57
to have the
15:58
building lean so that you can pull the
16:00
goods up directly yeah because if you go
16:01
to amsterdam you see that they
16:03
a lot of the houses have got winches on
16:04
the front of them haven't they at the
16:06
very top they got a little winch and the
16:08
reason was
16:09
i think this is right i might be wrong
16:10
but i think they came up with the law
16:13
that the amount of tax you paid was
16:14
dependent on the front of your house
16:16
how wide that was and so people wanted
16:19
really really thin houses so they paid
16:21
less tax
16:22
and so they would be thin and long and
16:23
they would be tall as well
16:25
so that was fine but then um they needed
16:27
to get if you need to get a sofa up to
16:29
the top floor that's gonna be really
16:30
tough because you're gonna have a really
16:32
thin staircase going up there
16:34
and so the way they did it was to winch
16:36
it all up and if you look now in
16:37
amsterdam they have all these winches at
16:39
the top of the houses
16:39
this is so cool i i feel like our facts
16:42
have just married each other
16:44
met and married they also actually in
16:46
amsterdam they had to have a laws
16:47
preventing houses from being too tilted
16:49
in the end because everyone was going
16:50
you know 45 degree angles
16:51
[Laughter]
16:53
actually it's a really thin house but
16:55
it's tilted 90 degrees
16:57
[Laughter]
16:59
there's a tilted structure in
17:00
yekaterinburg in russia
17:02
it's a massive tv tower and it is the
17:04
tallest
17:05
abandoned structure in the world oh
17:07
really they started building it they got
17:09
it really really high
17:10
and then the soviet union fell and then
17:12
they were like okay we're not going to
17:13
do this anymore
17:14
and it's still there i'm intentionally
17:16
leaning uh yeah unintentional it's very
17:18
slightly leaning
17:18
and did the soviet union fall because it
17:21
itself was on
17:23
it was leaning too far to the left yeah
17:27
uh a friend my friend uh who you all
17:29
know marina is from uh
17:30
kathryn berg and this is right near her
17:32
house and she says that everyone from
17:33
there absolutely hates it and
17:35
really wants it to get pulled down as
17:36
soon as possible right
17:38
just give it a nudge sounds like yeah
17:41
one of the buildings that is on the list
17:43
of the uh list of leaning towers on
17:44
wikipedia is this one that is a current
17:46
store it's a news story
17:47
the san francisco millennium tower so
17:49
they're still trying to deal with it it
17:50
keeps
17:51
leaning further and further because it's
17:52
sinking into the ground and it was found
17:54
out it was about six years ago they
17:56
started noticing it was a lady called
17:57
pamela buttery
17:58
who is up in her room and she was it's
18:01
she's on the
18:01
57th floor and she was trying to play
18:03
golf in her room every time she put the
18:05
ball down it just
18:06
dribbled away from her towards the end
18:08
of the room and she had to go and
18:10
collect and she's like why what's wrong
18:11
with my floor
18:12
it's a bit annoying for pamela buttery
18:13
because presumably if she's got tilting
18:15
flaws she's going to be slipping
18:16
all over them all the time
18:20
but yeah she falls over she'll fall face
18:22
down as well
18:28
[Music]
18:30
okay it is time for fact number three
18:32
and that
18:33
is chozinski my fact this week is that
18:36
when aspirin tablets were first
18:38
introduced people were unsure how to
18:40
take them
18:41
so one patient ended up strapping them
18:43
to his head to cure a headache
18:46
did it work uh we actually have no
18:48
reports on that so i read this in an
18:50
article in the independent from 2005 by
18:52
a journalist called david randall
18:54
who and i'd love to know more on it so
18:56
david if you're listening
18:57
please get in touch but this is a drug
18:59
called aspro
19:00
and this was devised in 1915 and it was
19:03
called aspro because the aspirin name
19:05
was taken by bayer
19:07
um but it was the same as aspirin so
19:08
aspirin is it's like saying jacuzzi
19:11
or um hoover they are technically yeah
19:14
but didn't
19:15
um bayer lose the copyright to lose the
19:18
trademark to it because they literally
19:19
let anyone use it and they had they
19:21
never sued anything i think they lost it
19:22
in the treaty of versailles
19:24
yeah really with like yes well actually
19:26
the interesting thing about germans and
19:27
aspirin is that
19:29
uh its invention is put down to a guy
19:31
called felix hoffman and if you look at
19:33
bayer's official history of aspirin it
19:34
still says that he invented it
19:36
and actually it's pretty much widely
19:37
accepted now since about 1999 that it
19:40
was in fact created
19:41
and tested by a guy called arthur aiken
19:45
grund
19:45
and i'm probably pronouncing that wrong
19:47
and he tested it in 1899 and he wrote a
19:49
paper in 1949 saying that
19:51
he just told hoffman what to do hoffman
19:53
didn't even know what he was doing
19:55
but aiken graham was jewish and so he
19:57
wasn't
19:58
ever included in the official narrative
20:00
and hoffman was this aryan kind of guy
20:02
and it didn't come out until just over
20:04
10 years ago and still if you look it up
20:06
hoffman is the person who's mainly
20:07
credited is inventing it i thought it
20:09
was hoffman yeah
20:10
i was just thinking by strapping um your
20:12
aspirin to your head it might work
20:14
still as a placebo yeah that's right
20:16
that's what i was thinking i bet the
20:17
person did feel better
20:18
yeah individual tablets or just the
20:20
whole box it doesn't matter you could
20:22
if you believed it was gonna work you
20:23
could strap an empty box to your head
20:25
then it would still work a little bit
20:26
yeah for me to believe it i need the
20:28
aspirin to be touching my skin i think
20:30
i'd have to take it out of the packaging
20:31
yeah okay
20:32
otherwise yeah it's a placebo pharmacy
20:34
as you just stare at the product
20:36
behind the counter and just visualize
20:38
them going into you
20:39
that'd be great i've got a magic
20:40
pharmacy all these things work from a
20:42
distance you'd only have to take any of
20:44
them
20:44
yeah you get the placebo effect and my
20:47
business goes immediately out of
20:49
business because i don't sell anything
20:50
yes
20:51
you can charge them to look and you can
20:52
charge them more to look at branded
20:54
aspirin than you charge them to look at
20:56
underground
20:56
and that's true because branded aspirin
20:58
is does better doesn't it than
21:00
non-branded aspirin because people
21:02
believe that it's more
21:04
somehow more potent because it's got a
21:05
brand attached to it it is insane
21:07
that literally the same thing in tesco
21:09
costs 30p that also costs three pounds
21:11
or whatever and people so often buy the
21:13
three pounds
21:13
and tesco even colors it so it looks
21:15
like the neurofen pattern
21:17
and then it makes its aspirin red so it
21:19
looks like um branded aspirin but
21:21
it actually does work so you pain extra
21:24
actually makes it work better
21:25
it was a study by braithwaite and cooper
21:27
in 1981 that showed that that was true
21:30
it's good that they don't make the
21:31
tablets themselves silver because
21:32
imagine you're being attacked by a
21:34
werewolf you accidentally mistaken your
21:35
aspirin tablets with your silver bullets
21:37
that you're using to kill it
21:39
and then you end up just curing the
21:40
problem isn't it but instead they've
21:42
made them look like children sweets
21:44
i can't see the risk with that it's not
21:47
nearly as dangerous as the werewolf
21:48
situation i think we can all agree hey
21:50
um
21:50
i was reading in the uh in the new qi
21:52
book the fact book there's a fact in
21:54
there that i've been thinking about for
21:55
weeks which i just think it's so odd
21:58
i can't believe that it's true 95 of
22:01
people on earth have at least one thing
22:03
wrong with them
22:04
so that's quite amazing but flip that
22:06
round that means there are five percent
22:07
of people on this planet with
22:09
absolutely nothing wrong with them how
22:11
is that possible
22:12
yeah i don't think it can be that is
22:14
impossible right five percent of people
22:16
how are you absolutely fine it's
22:18
impossible yeah but maybe they're just
22:19
people who are extremely stoic
22:21
and so when they asked them in the uh
22:24
survey they said
22:25
you know what's wrong with you they're
22:26
like fine i'm fine
22:28
just their organs hanging out collapse
22:31
can't move
22:32
fine i'm fine
22:33
[Laughter]
22:35
but yeah anyway so sorry just to round
22:37
up apparently
22:38
it was the first thing that was it was
22:40
the first medicine that was sold on mass
22:41
in tablet form and so it wasn't widely
22:43
accepted even though i think people have
22:45
been swallowing things for hundreds of
22:46
years it wasn't widely accepted this
22:48
would be the way to swallow it
22:49
and like i say i couldn't find any more
22:50
information on this poor man who
22:52
strapped one to his head so if anyone
22:54
knows him he's descended from he died of
22:55
a headache immediately afterwards
22:57
and so was never heard of again aspirin
23:00
is
23:01
called a wonder drug by a lot of people
23:03
because it's been very recently
23:04
discovered that it does all these other
23:05
incredible things so a lot of people
23:06
over a certain age or with blood
23:08
clotting issues
23:09
are told to take an aspirin a day
23:10
because it stops platelets from clotting
23:12
and a third of them that sounds like a
23:15
really crap version of an apple a day
23:16
keeps the doctor away
23:18
say it again and that's for a day keeps
23:20
the platelets from clotting
23:22
yay
23:25
does the trick um but a third of all
23:28
people who are at risk from cardiac
23:29
arrest or cardiac incident
23:31
will not have that cardiac incident if
23:33
they take an aspirin every day which
23:34
isn't amazing
23:35
apparently if your car is broken down it
23:38
can't fix a car down
23:39
you just strap it to the top of the car
23:43
apparently if you if you can't if you've
23:45
got any jump leads on you and no one is
23:47
passing by to help you and you happen to
23:48
have
23:49
some aspirin on you if you put the
23:51
aspirin two tablets into the battery
23:53
itself
23:54
the uh basically the sulfuric acid
23:57
within the battery will mix with the
23:58
aspirin and it'll kick start it back
24:00
into life
24:01
i read this in the reader's digest
24:03
article yeah i i haven't tested it i
24:05
can't give first of all
24:06
the dosage is the same for cars and
24:08
humans take two touches two
24:10
every four hours will keep your car
24:11
running
24:13
drop two tablets another thing it helps
24:16
to get running
24:16
is um a collider like not the large
24:20
hadron collider but there is another
24:21
collider in
24:22
illinois there are like little switches
24:24
they put aspirins on and the idea is if
24:25
there was a leak
24:26
the water would drop down it would
24:28
dissolve the aspirin
24:30
and then the switches will be able to
24:31
switch back and it would turn off
24:33
automatically
24:33
oh it's kind of like those old like
24:35
resistors or trip switches or something
24:36
when the metal is supposed to basically
24:38
it destroys the connection if the
24:39
currents
24:40
yeah it's like a fuse box kind of thing
24:42
wow um
24:43
we're getting near the end of the year
24:45
and uh obviously new year's eve in
24:47
america there's huge traditions of
24:48
dropping things
24:49
uh in in manhattan sorry in new york
24:52
times square it's the what they dropped
24:54
the
24:55
ball uh there's a place in america
24:58
called uh myers town in pennsylvania
25:01
where you can see a giant aspirin tablet
25:03
dropped
25:04
yeah and that brings us into the new
25:05
year and the reason is is because the
25:07
uh the bayer healthcare plant is there
25:10
and so it's such a big part of the town
25:12
and probably employs so many people who
25:13
live there
25:14
so yeah they just drop a giant into a
25:16
giant glass of water or
25:18
into a giant mouth yeah yeah is it real
25:21
aspirin like if i went and chipped some
25:23
off
25:23
would that no no that would be so cool
25:25
though but no it's uh it's it's fake
25:27
they do
25:28
it's really weird there's a list you can
25:29
go on of things that are dropped at new
25:31
year in america and pennsylvania has
25:33
so many so in certain places you can see
25:35
a beaver dropped a canal boat dropped
25:37
indy car dropped it's like a theme that
25:39
each uh town has on their own
25:41
wow yeah but one is the aspirin yeah
25:43
they're all beaver
25:44
it's a stuffed beaver it's not a yeah
25:46
it's not a real deep well yeah but still
25:47
poor old beaver who got killed and stuff
25:49
yeah oh yeah yeah that's true
25:51
it's in and that's in beavertown is it
25:53
in pennsylvania i don't think that's a
25:55
coincidence
25:55
[Laughter]
26:02
okay it is time for our final fact of
26:04
the show and that is my fact
26:06
my fact this week is that the first
26:08
british plans to put a human on the moon
26:10
was made by oliver cromwell's
26:12
brother-in-law this is so cool
26:14
so this is back in the uh 1600s yeah he
26:17
wouldn't have really had the means to do
26:19
so i don't think no he didn't at all i
26:20
mean
26:21
we uh i think you're right yeah this is
26:24
uh this is dr john wilkins this is not a
26:26
this is not in any way a nut case
26:28
of who just we happen to have found
26:29
documents of some crazy machine that was
26:32
built this is a really respected
26:33
clergyman philosopher author helped
26:36
found the royal society
26:37
it was a really big deal back in the day
26:39
he's quite a famous polymath i think
26:40
yeah he was yeah and he was he was a big
26:43
champion
26:43
of uh sort of the latest ideas about
26:46
space
26:47
and um and one of the what were the
26:49
latest ideas about space in the 17th
26:51
century well so
26:52
i mean i guess galileo had telescopes
26:54
trained at the moon and he was very much
26:56
he wrote two books about the moon and
26:58
his thoughts about what actually was
27:00
going on he thought it was a solid
27:01
object and he got a lot wrong but
27:03
you always do in those you know when
27:04
there's limited science and you're
27:06
trying to break ground
27:06
although to be clear the moon is a solid
27:08
object that was one of the things he did
27:09
not get wrong right
27:10
what so how did he try and get to the
27:14
moon
27:14
okay so his idea was that you could
27:17
build a
27:17
space chariot and he was using obviously
27:20
the technology of his time
27:21
and his theory was that as soon as you
27:24
got 20 miles
27:25
up into the air magnetism of earth and
27:28
gravity
27:29
loses itself so you that's why you can
27:30
stay up there the reason he thought that
27:32
is because why do clouds stay in the air
27:34
and he thought as high as they were
27:36
that's where you no longer suffered
27:38
to the pull of earth's magnetism i mean
27:40
that's pretty good logic considering the
27:41
information you had available
27:42
yeah yeah so he thought if you could
27:44
just get up to that point
27:45
then you'd be able to float off into
27:47
space and go to the moon and you would
27:49
adjust
27:49
to the air and you'd breathe the air of
27:51
angels this is where the kind of
27:52
religious side
27:53
comes in but it made sense that that's
27:55
how angels breathed um they just got
27:57
used to it and then you go to the moon
27:59
and you would trade for spices and so on
28:01
with the people who lived on the moon
28:02
you thought there were people that might
28:03
live on the moon and we could trade with
28:04
them and sorry this very easy problem of
28:06
getting the initial 20 miles up into the
28:08
air how was he surmounting that
28:09
well okay so flying chariot yeah so the
28:12
flying chariot so
28:13
it was um it was meant to use clockwork
28:16
gears it was gunpowder
28:17
the idea was that it was going to be
28:18
propelled using gunpowder and springs
28:20
and springs yeah the acme space chariot
28:25
but he is he was a very rational
28:27
sensible person and in this age
28:29
that was actually kind of a perfectly
28:30
reasonable thing to think and
28:32
his greatest interest was making a
28:34
unifying language for the world wasn't
28:36
it
28:36
so he did lots of work on creating like
28:39
what we have now
28:40
esperanto which obviously we all speak
28:42
he also designed the system of
28:44
a decimal system which the metric system
28:46
was then based on and built off
28:48
so you know his language was quite
28:50
interesting um
28:52
every time you added a new letter to a
28:53
word it would change the meaning
28:56
but your meaning would be related to the
28:57
previous word so
28:59
um the word d e d would be an element
29:03
but then when you put a b on the end deb
29:05
that would mean fire
29:07
and then debar would mean a flame so
29:10
each one was related to the previous
29:12
and the whole idea of it was you would
29:14
be able to
29:16
see a word and knowing the basic
29:18
building blocks of how his language
29:20
works you could work out pretty much
29:22
what it kind of meant so if it began
29:23
with d you would know it was
29:25
in this part of you know semantics and
29:27
if it began with x you would know this
29:29
or with j
29:30
you would know that that's clever so to
29:32
a much smaller extent you can do that
29:33
with english and that you know if
29:34
something is you know it's got a
29:35
diminutive on the front or
29:36
kind of like something like it has been
29:38
the suffixes but the core word is
29:40
usually completely random or comes from
29:41
a really random source so you can't
29:43
deduce it right from the beginning sure
29:44
so i suppose if you
29:46
hear a word that has hydro at the start
29:48
of it you know it's gonna be something
29:49
to do with water
29:50
didn't he also say that eating wouldn't
29:53
be necessary when we got to space
29:55
because
29:56
there's no gravity and the reason we
29:57
have to eat on earth is that the
29:59
gravity pulls your food through your
30:00
body and makes it fall out so you have
30:02
to keep eating more
30:04
it's so wonderful but he was genuinely i
30:06
mean i have to say uh when i saw this
30:08
fact i thought wait a minute
30:10
so there are some animals whose mouth
30:12
and anus are on about the same level
30:14
like a dog for instance or a cat yeah
30:16
maybe he tried to train animals not to
30:18
sit down because as soon as they sit
30:19
down that's suddenly gravity right dogs
30:22
don't poo when they're standing up do
30:23
they they kind of move their bum down oh
30:25
my god
30:26
of course they do it makes sense maybe
30:28
he was right
30:31
but he didn't like all of this
30:32
theoretical stuff he did he worked out
30:33
the distance to the moon
30:35
to a degree of accuracy of 99.9 using
30:38
just trigonometry
30:39
that is incredible he's so impressive
30:41
and i'm quite surprised that of the
30:43
you know uh the british space program
30:46
that this guy there's not a big statue
30:47
of this guy outside i mean we don't
30:49
really have that much of a space
30:50
probably
30:51
we have one that goes all the way back
30:52
to the 17th century and it kind of ended
30:54
there
30:54
yeah that's true we've done pretty much
30:57
it we have one we have the uh
30:59
the prospero satellite we got one one
31:00
british made satellite that was launched
31:02
the british made rocket
31:03
everything else has basically been we've
31:05
given something everything else is
31:06
basically chariots
31:08
[Laughter]
31:10
[Music]
31:15
okay that's it that's all of our facts
31:17
thank you so much for listening

[Music]
00:14
hello
00:15
and welcome to another episode of no
00:17
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:19
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:21
covent garden
00:22
my name is dan schreiber and i am
00:24
sitting here with james harkin
00:26
alex bell and andrew hunter murray and
00:28
once again we have gathered around the
00:30
microphones with our four favorite facts
00:32
from the last seven days
00:33
and in no particular order here we go
00:36
starting with you
00:37
andy murray my fact is that in 1851
00:41
all of the 436 thousand eight hundred
00:44
sandwiches sold on the streets of london
00:46
were ham just hamster
00:50
sandwiches that's so obviously not
00:52
tricky well
00:54
uh i think it is was it just ham or did
00:56
they have like ham and pickle or ham and
00:57
mustard or add some mustard
00:59
okay had had other sandwiches been
01:01
invented at that point and they thought
01:03
we don't actually like those we'll stick
01:04
with ham i think they have because i
01:05
think they had cheese sandwiches because
01:06
we've said before in this podcast they
01:08
used to be called bread and meat or
01:09
bread and cheese
01:10
yeah so i'll tell you basically ham
01:12
sandwiching was
01:13
a thing as in you didn't have a sandwich
01:15
shop you would be
01:16
a sandwich seller and you have a your
01:18
own ham
01:19
and you would boil it and then you would
01:21
sell it from your car so it's quite hard
01:22
to have a big range
01:23
and we only know about this because
01:24
there was a guy called henry mayhew
01:27
uh who was a social investigator and he
01:28
wrote this huge work called london labor
01:30
and the london poor
01:32
and he calculated that that number of
01:34
sandwiches were sold and the only ones
01:36
he came across were ham ones
01:38
so he's pretty amazing this guy he is i
01:41
hadn't heard of him he co-founded punch
01:43
which was the original british satirical
01:46
magazine that ran for god
01:47
hundreds of years ago might this have
01:49
been satire we're talking about no
01:52
and b wilson who's a food writer and her
01:54
book's very good she also has written an
01:56
essay on the subjections she she said
01:57
that all the
01:58
sandwiches were happening if b wilson
01:59
says it then i do believe it
02:01
but even before the went and did punch
02:04
he
02:05
had the most ridiculous childhood he ran
02:06
away from home when he was 12 to join
02:08
the east india company
02:09
wow and worked on their ships and then
02:12
he came back and tried law and then he
02:13
went into journalism but 12 he ran when
02:15
he was 12.
02:15
you know how people used to die younger
02:17
is it like dog years is 12 actually
02:19
like 18 back then well i guess kind of
02:22
but also it was he ran away because he
02:23
didn't want to follow
02:24
the same career as his father so it's
02:26
pretty early what did his father do he
02:28
was a sailor
02:30
i think he was an accountant oh well i
02:32
can understand that he was a very
02:33
fertile accountant because henry mayhew
02:35
was one of 17 children
02:37
17. wow um he did report on his sandwich
02:41
investigation that one seller told him
02:43
that sometimes cab drivers would offer
02:45
to fight them for a sandwich instead of
02:46
paying for it
02:50
that doesn't really feel like it would
02:52
be a good idea well it doesn't work in
02:54
prep when i try it
02:55
because as a sandwich seller the best
02:57
outcome is that you've
02:59
won a fight and kept your sandwich
03:03
but you had to fight someone not to lose
03:05
the sandwich yeah exactly
03:06
it feels like it would be better for you
03:08
to do nothing at all than to get
03:09
involved in this fight yeah there's a no
03:11
transaction
03:12
yeah this isn't the best ham based
03:15
story from 1851. it was a good year
03:18
wasn't it it was a very
03:20
versatile say what else happened in 1851
03:21
just give it yeah sure a great
03:23
exhibition happened in london
03:24
and it was just ham sandwiches well
03:26
didn't they have tin food as one of the
03:28
attractions so i guess
03:30
and also moby dick was published i've
03:32
got to say
03:33
the best moby dick fact ever which we
03:35
all know because it was found by one of
03:36
our colleagues ed brooke hitchins this
03:38
um this last week which is that he got a
03:41
rejection letter from one publisher
03:43
saying the whale is obviously a nice
03:46
idea but maybe you could replace it by
03:48
something more popular
03:49
maybe young voluptuous maidens
03:51
[Laughter]
03:53
why would you want to harpoon young
03:55
voluptuous maidens that's true it
03:56
doesn't make any sense i would've been
03:57
like carrie
03:58
it was just hang on hang on dan you said
04:01
you had a better ham anecdote from 1850
04:03
yeah well okay
04:04
alex we all did it in our heads james
04:07
and we decided not to say it
04:10
that's not podcast work
04:13
yeah so uh other news uh alex mentions
04:16
the great exhibition moby dick two other
04:18
things that happened in 1851 is that the
04:20
new york times was founded and reuters
04:22
news was founded as well
04:24
so obviously a lot more outlet to report
04:26
hand-based stories were erupting
04:28
that year so um christmas in 1851 have
04:31
you heard about this
04:32
in london it was a sort of super great
04:35
giveaway to all the poor of london to
04:37
feed them
04:38
on christmas day and it was over 22
04:41
000 people who were fed in one single
04:43
place and that place was called ham yard
04:46
and ham yard in london they had
04:47
benefactors from all the richest people
04:49
in london
04:49
who gave one one guy called mr richard
04:52
cooper supplied 200 pounds of beef
04:54
um and they did a massive christmas
04:57
meal for all the less privileged of
05:00
london so over 22 000 people fed in one
05:02
go
05:03
by a very famous chef he's often called
05:05
the first celebrity chef
05:06
alexis sawyer and it was his idea and he
05:09
put it together
05:10
and he fed all these people wow yeah
05:12
i've been to him yard it's off region
05:13
street yes still there right
05:14
yeah um the best
05:18
ham sandwich related story of the mid
05:21
19th century
05:22
okay that's cheating a bit well it is um
05:24
this comes from
05:25
around 1840 so it's about 10 years
05:28
before both of your hands
05:30
oh this is way better than if you've got
05:31
pre-dated it's true
05:33
um so the town of swindon was invented
05:35
by a ham sandwich
05:37
what um it was founded by a ham sandwich
05:39
let's say
05:40
the story goes i don't know if this is
05:42
true that isn't bad kind of brunell was
05:44
on the railway and he knew that they had
05:46
to found a town
05:47
somewhere on the railway because they
05:48
needed to have a stop there and he
05:50
started eating his ham sandwich
05:52
and then he thought well as soon as i've
05:53
had enough of this sandwich and i throw
05:55
it out the window wherever it lands
05:56
that's where i'm going to start my new
05:58
town
05:58
and it landed where currently swindon is
06:01
no way
06:02
but hang on because you'd have to stop
06:05
the train
06:06
immediately yeah and go back and find it
06:08
and go back and find the sandwich
06:10
that is true unless you remembered oh we
06:13
were passing through swindon when i
06:15
threw my sandwich out of the window
06:17
i threw my sandwich out right next to
06:19
that sign that says welcome to swimming
06:22
the swindon was tiny it was absolutely
06:23
tiny before the railway arrived and then
06:24
it became huge
06:25
so there's another town that's sort of
06:27
further south in wheelchair called
06:28
marlborough
06:28
and it's absolutely tiny but it could as
06:32
easily have gone the other way
06:33
if isn't about kingdom brunel had you
06:34
know been a bit hungry or hadn't had a
06:36
banana or breakfast and you wanted a bit
06:37
more of a sandwich
06:39
um so ham sandwiches are still extremely
06:42
popular
06:43
are they yeah the british sandwich
06:45
association
06:46
says that ham sandwiches is the most
06:49
popular sandwich in the uk
06:50
really do you think they'll look back in
06:52
100 years at 2016 and think it was a
06:54
great age of ham sandwiches as well
06:56
i think finally back to the great times
06:58
of 1851
06:59
um they so this is this is an old survey
07:01
i can't imagine though it was 2001 i
07:03
can't imagine in 15 years it's changed
07:05
that much
07:06
but they said that the favorite filling
07:08
wasn't ham though
07:10
it was cheese but a ham sandwich on its
07:12
own topped
07:13
for the favorite filling yeah i always
07:16
like my ham sandwiches without ham but
07:17
with cheese
07:18
[Laughter]
07:20
i think what they mean is what's your
07:21
favorite filling well if i'm having a
07:22
sandwich i love it if there's cheese in
07:24
there and they said would you be happy
07:26
with just a cheese sandwich
07:27
no no i think i'll go for ham i think
07:28
that's how the conversation wait but the
07:30
favorite filling
07:31
is that because you have it outside the
07:33
sandwich no you have it in the sandwich
07:34
but you might have it with ham so you
07:36
have a ham and cheese
07:37
so you're saying ham is not a filling
07:38
because it's the base ingredient of the
07:40
sandwich you know if
07:40
anything extra is a filling no no
07:42
there's two questions what is there's
07:43
bread
07:44
added item in it yeah and you could have
07:46
one item in it
07:47
they've gone for ham sandwich that works
07:48
best as a sandwich yeah what's your
07:50
favorite filling to go in a sandwich
07:51
oh okay well if i'm having a ham
07:53
sandwich rather than pickle i'll
07:54
i'll have cheese but he's the favorite
07:56
added what's your favorite filling
07:58
for two slices of bread is ham yeah of
08:01
all the things that people have voted on
08:03
in 2016 this makes me the most annoyed
08:07
well this is 2001. people say 2016
08:11
imagine you were presented with a lot of
08:13
different sandwiches that
08:14
uh had base meats in them like let's say
08:17
let's say or no meat or like a salad or
08:19
whatever base meat
08:21
like the alchemy of the sandwich world
08:24
there's base 10 which are numbered and
08:26
then base meat
08:27
which is what our sandwich is turned ham
08:29
into cheese
08:30
[Laughter]
08:33
um two-thirds of ham and cheese pizzas
08:35
tested by trading standards officers in
08:37
derbyshire failed to contain ham
08:39
or cheese no yeah how many uh two thirds
08:43
two thirds of the pizza
08:44
[Laughter]
08:46
what it was is when people thought it
08:49
was ham it was actually turkey ham
08:51
which is made of turkey not ham and the
08:53
cheese was often cheese substitute
08:56
i'm not sure what cheese substitute is
08:58
but i it doesn't sound great
08:59
ham apparently
09:00
[Laughter]
09:04
um so henry mayhew did a load of just to
09:07
drag us back to henry
09:08
mayhew for a bit um he did a load of
09:10
calculations basically so
09:11
he calculated how many sellers there
09:13
were of each thing on the streets of
09:14
london so he calculated for example
09:16
that there were 60 ham sandwich sellers
09:18
in london 200 baked potato sellers 300
09:21
people who sold pea soup and hot eel
09:23
um six people apparently specialized in
09:26
plum puddings
09:28
yeah and he would work it out by
09:29
estimating the number of miles of street
09:30
in the city and then multiplying that by
09:32
the number of traders he found per mile
09:35
yeah i think it sounds like the most
09:37
fascinating book i really want to read
09:39
it it's what's it called again it's
09:40
called london labor and the london pool
09:42
yeah and he basically documented 1851
09:44
in london in down to every bit of
09:47
clothing that people it would be like us
09:48
just going out on the street and just
09:49
recording what's going on as a time
09:51
capsule and it's pretty amazing
09:54
really yeah and it had a big impact he
09:56
uh pissed off a lot of people
09:57
with this book um particularly the
10:00
street traders and they actually set up
10:02
a uh street traders protection
10:04
association against this kind of
10:06
journalism
10:07
uh specifically because how they were
10:09
presented in the book they were
10:10
presented like these sandwich sellers
10:12
they're like well actually we do have a
10:13
bit more than ham
10:15
yeah yeah exactly really
10:18
yeah some of them some just didn't even
10:20
have hammond did they not no just cheese
10:22
they had a bit of they had a bit of uh
10:25
beef dripping and that was it between
10:26
two bits of bread what is beef dripping
10:28
it's uh fat yeah sort of uh it's a
10:31
congeal fat when you've cooked beef
10:33
um you get all the fat kind of drops
10:35
down when you roast it
10:36
and then you can take that and you can
10:38
kind of spread it on bread and it's what
10:40
people used to eat
10:41
that sounds like cheese substitute it
10:42
does but it doesn't taste anything like
10:44
cheese it tastes more like kind of
10:46
fatty gravy oh so delicious um also
10:49
he collected a load of data with his
10:51
brother augustus mayhew and yet
10:53
20 years after the book was published
10:54
augustus mayhew was head up in court
10:56
on charges of attacking a female peddler
10:59
a
11:00
woman going on selling things and his
11:02
defense in court was that
11:03
people would knock on his door up to 38
11:05
times a day selling things
11:07
[Laughter]
11:10
he just snapped and he said they were
11:11
shouting things like crockery
11:13
or fine young rabbits or roots all are
11:16
blowing all are growing
11:18
young rabbits sounds like a great band
11:20
doesn't it yeah
11:22
did you know that there's a a latitude
11:24
around the earth
11:25
that's sometimes referred to as the ham
11:27
belt and it's 40 degrees latitude
11:29
and it's the uh it's not so much these
11:31
days but it used to be the climate at
11:33
which
11:33
all the best ham came from so uh like
11:35
kentucky ham virginia ham italian
11:37
prosciutto ham uh spanish serrano ham
11:40
all of those places are along the same
11:41
last students because the climate is
11:43
sort of ideal for ham curing and it's
11:44
not so important nowadays because
11:46
uh you know you have climate control
11:47
factories and whatnot but um and it was
11:49
discovered by alexander von hambelt
11:58
okay it is time for fact number two and
12:00
that is alex
12:01
my fact is that since 2003 the uk has
12:04
eaten
12:05
one and a half million pounds in cash
12:08
okay and when do you say cash are we
12:10
talking two p coins
12:11
or notes oh so this is the bank of
12:14
england releases stats every year on
12:16
uh the uh yeah big graphic alex got a
12:19
massive graph on his
12:20
uh research notes so for people at home
12:23
what happens is
12:24
we kind of do some research and we print
12:25
it out on a sheet of paper
12:27
and we've got like little paragraphs
12:28
that we might read out if something
12:30
comes up
12:30
but alex just has a massive grab i'm
12:33
concerned by the year-to-year trend
12:35
i'm gonna explain you can um submit uh
12:38
banknotes that are damaged in some way
12:40
to the bank of england get them replaced
12:42
and then they keep stats on them so they
12:44
release each year how many banknotes
12:45
have been
12:46
um torn apart or accidentally washed
12:49
or contaminated or damaged by fire or
12:52
flood and the other category is chewed
12:53
or eaten
12:54
and so each year they've released how
12:56
many uh how many notes of each
12:58
denomination have been
13:00
chewed or eaten and how much they're
13:01
worth and
13:03
in total since 2003 it's 1.5 million
13:06
okay so
13:06
i reckon when you said that fact people
13:09
were thinking that humans were eating
13:10
these notes but i reckon it must be
13:12
mostly like dogs and stuff maybe yeah
13:14
it could be babies it could be babies
13:16
yeah i mean babies will put things in
13:17
their mouths won't they they will but
13:19
they don't have teeth
13:20
that's true so they won't be chewing it
13:23
and damaging it
13:24
i mean some of them have teeth don't
13:25
they do do you have to have teeth to
13:26
chew
13:27
that's a good point can you chew with
13:29
gums alone you could suppose you could
13:31
ruminate the note in your mouth
13:33
yeah you can dissolve it yeah i'd say a
13:35
baby would be sucking rather than
13:37
chewing
13:37
yeah okay well but you have to provide
13:40
the
13:40
the remnants of the note to prove that
13:42
uh you had it in the first place
13:44
otherwise you could just write the
13:45
background
13:45
how do you so what you bring the
13:50
there could be plenty of notes that have
13:51
been completely eaten i guess it's very
13:53
hard to say my dog ate 2 000 quid in 50
13:55
pound notes
13:56
um unfortunately he ate them so
13:58
thoroughly but if you could tell me
14:00
no but they do send this i recommended
14:01
that it's called the mutilators notes
14:03
service and you you post them in and you
14:05
write a little explaining letter
14:07
and if they think it's legit then
14:08
they'll post you some money ah
14:10
yeah i could have used that i once got
14:11
given an envelope of some money and
14:14
uh
14:17
[Laughter]
14:25
[Laughter]
14:28
the rest of you can look that up at home
14:30
and have a really entertaining afternoon
14:31
cash for question anyway sorry go on
14:34
done so rather than opening the envelope
14:36
the normal way
14:37
i opened it up at the top end of the on
14:39
the side so i just ripped it over the
14:41
short edge of the envelope yes exactly
14:42
so i ripped it open there and
14:44
i uh and then i got to the shop and it
14:45
was closed and so i couldn't buy
14:47
anything so i went to
14:48
my house came out in the morning to buy
14:50
the milk that i was looking to buy
14:51
handed over from the envelope my 10
14:53
pound note and the guy said i can't
14:55
accept this you're missing
14:56
uh the last like eighth of the note and
14:59
what i had done
15:00
and there was about 60 quid in this
15:02
envelope i had ripped as well as the
15:04
envelope
15:05
all that final eighth of all the notes
15:08
and they had scattered all on the street
15:09
and had to go around the street
15:10
collecting the rest of my notes you got
15:12
the bag yeah i found them
15:13
all day afterwards yeah oh my god did
15:15
you get the milk
15:16
i did yeah um i think that
15:20
all of these banknotes were mostly eaten
15:22
by dogs not humans or babies
15:24
well babies are humans apart from baby
15:26
dogs
15:26
[Laughter]
15:28
um so i think they're mostly eaten by
15:30
dogs um
15:32
in montana a few years ago there was a
15:34
news story about a dog called sundance
15:36
who at five one hundred dollar bills
15:39
that were stashed
15:40
in his owner's little cubby hole um but
15:43
the 500
15:44
bills were together with a single one
15:46
dollar bill which it didn't eat
15:52
it's fantastic wow this is interesting
15:56
do you know where the first place
15:57
to feature queen elizabeth on money was
16:01
oh uh so not britain it was not britain
16:03
yeah was it
16:05
somewhere in the caribbean no somewhere
16:07
in africa no
16:08
australia no canada yes yes
16:11
what is that they had her when um
16:15
she was a nine-year-old princess uh so
16:18
prior to being the queen
16:19
and it was on the 20 notes and so
16:21
obviously she wasn't on any money here
16:22
she wasn't the queen yet but
16:24
they wanted to they wanted to give her
16:26
some props over there i'm not sure
16:28
completely why but they used her image
16:30
yeah that's cool speaking of notes in
16:32
canada a few years ago there was
16:34
a rumor that all canadian banknotes
16:36
smelled of maple syrup
16:38
and people were kind of pulling them out
16:41
of their pockets and smelling them and
16:42
believed that they could smell
16:44
maple syrup and everyone on the internet
16:46
was saying yeah mine smell of maple
16:47
syrup as well
16:48
but mine only smell of it when i take
16:50
them out my pocket and they've warmed up
16:51
so they must be putting something in the
16:53
nose
16:54
the pocket i keep on my maple syrup yeah
16:56
well i think that must have been it or
16:58
it was just like a weird hysteria
17:00
because the bank of canada said that
17:02
actually
17:02
there's nothing in there and we've
17:04
tested ours and they don't smell maple
17:05
syrup but they have got in trouble in
17:06
the past as well the bank of canada
17:08
because
17:09
they did a new series of banknotes and
17:10
they put a maple leaf on and it was
17:12
pointed out that that maple leaf
17:14
that particular shape of maple leaf is
17:16
from a tree which does not grow in
17:17
canada that's right yeah
17:18
norwegian maple rather than a canadian
17:20
maple right and they said
17:21
actually what we've done is we've
17:22
blended together a load of maple leaves
17:24
to avoid being regionally insensitive
17:26
to all those norwegians living in canada
17:29
that's kind of like the euro though
17:31
yeah when they designed the euro notes
17:33
they didn't want to favor any particular
17:34
country's culture so they uh got someone
17:37
to take a load of famous bridges from
17:39
all the different countries that were
17:40
taking the euro
17:41
and sort of blend them into generic
17:42
bridges yeah so all the euro
17:44
money has fake bridges on it yeah so no
17:47
one gets effective started building
17:48
those bridges it was an art installation
17:50
rather than an actual bridge but he
17:51
started building the fake bridges over
17:52
rivers in belgium or something that's a
17:54
great idea yeah yeah that's fantastic
17:56
sort of odd weird reverse forgery but
17:58
not money
17:59
yeah oh this is a cool thing about
18:01
currency so in uh i think it was
18:04
november or october um the japanese
18:07
financial services industry was
18:09
considering regulating a new kind of
18:11
currency which was any guesses
18:14
um it's currency that james spends and
18:17
the rest of us don't
18:18
pokemon money it's poke coins um so as
18:22
far as i understand you use the currency
18:24
to breed uh imaginary monsters on your
18:25
phone
18:26
um you use them to not buy monsters but
18:28
buy things that help you
18:29
to find monsters i see okay so you can't
18:32
even buy pokemon with them you can buy
18:34
to help you you've got to catch pokemon
18:35
yeah so it's like you could buy a net
18:37
with a pokecoin
18:38
kind of you can buy a lure that's
18:40
spending real money on that
18:41
you can spend real money or you can find
18:43
them in the game
18:44
okay so but we all do it like temple run
18:47
you know when you spend money to buy
18:48
more
18:49
you know speed ability and so on we all
18:52
do it
18:52
okay the japanese financial services
18:54
authorities not considering regulating
18:56
temple run coins though
18:58
they are considering regulations
19:02
and basically if they did decide to
19:04
regulate it i don't think i'm not sure
19:06
if they've come to a conclusion yet
19:07
companies would have to declare all the
19:09
unused currency
19:10
that gamers have held and they'd have to
19:12
secure it with massive deposits of real
19:14
money
19:14
wow speaking of digital money there's a
19:18
landfill in wales which has an enormous
19:20
treasure
19:21
trove like buried treasure and it's
19:23
getting more and more valuable each year
19:25
so in 2013 it was worth four million
19:27
pounds and it's because there's a hard
19:28
drive
19:28
which a man called james howells threw
19:30
away um in 2013
19:32
um and he realized after he thrown it
19:34
away that he had a digital wallet on it
19:36
which had
19:36
seven and a half thousand bitcoin and he
19:38
got those in 2009 when they were worth
19:40
nothing
19:41
but they're now worth 2013 they're worth
19:43
about four million pounds and
19:44
they're increasing a lot more since then
19:46
and so we don't know where it is in the
19:47
world
19:48
yeah right yeah so yeah get digging um
19:51
should we move on soon yeah
19:52
i have one thing that uh motorola has
19:55
invented an edible password they call it
19:57
an authentication vitamin and it's a
19:59
pill that you swallow if you have your
20:00
phone near you it will wirelessly unlock
20:01
it
20:02
oh sorry i i'm a bit confused on how it
20:04
works a piece you swallow a pill it has
20:05
a tiny microchip in it which uh
20:07
broadcasts a little uh signal
20:09
and that's a signal that will wirelessly
20:11
unlock your devices if they're set up
20:12
for it so is it activated by the actors
20:14
following it
20:15
no no you don't have to swallow it every
20:16
time you're on your phone you put it in
20:18
you and then whenever you're around your
20:19
phone it's unlocked
20:20
but except for when you pull it out yeah
20:22
so then you have to swallow another one
20:24
but why can't you just have it in your
20:25
pocket
20:27
uh because you could lose that or
20:28
someone else could take your pocket
20:30
yeah whereas you can't have it stolen
20:32
from you if you've eaten so what you
20:34
could do
20:34
is you could put the little chip that's
20:36
in an oyster card and you could eat that
20:38
and then every time you're walking
20:39
towards
20:40
um the gates and the tube station it'll
20:42
be like you're on star wars or something
20:44
yeah and that is why my lord i took a
20:46
dump on the oyster barrier
20:53
okay it is time to move on to fact
20:55
number three and that is my fact
20:57
and my fact this week is that a day on
21:00
the sun
21:01
lasts both 25 and
21:04
38 earth days okay
21:07
you're gonna have to explain because
21:08
it's always going to feel like daytime
21:10
there isn't it
21:11
yeah it's not really gonna yeah you're
21:13
gonna be confused so
21:14
um because it's a massive gas body it
21:16
spins at different speeds so the
21:18
middle of it the equator as it were
21:20
spins
21:21
around 25 days that makes one day but
21:23
the poles go a lot slower so it takes
21:26
up to 38 days for them to turn around so
21:29
um
21:29
i should say that there are fluctuations
21:31
in these numbers obviously so
21:33
24.7 is usually the number given for the
21:35
quickest bit where the equator where the
21:37
middle of the sun is spinning around
21:38
38 is the top end bit but i asked alex
21:40
and i saw an astrophysicist the other
21:42
night
21:42
uh dr lucy green and she said that's
21:45
absolutely true that they do have these
21:46
different spins
21:48
on them yeah really interesting so did
21:50
jupiter and saturn actually
21:51
they also have differential spin because
21:53
because they're gas
21:55
yeah um i found out this thing the other
21:57
day which i told the guys but i haven't
21:58
told you yet so i'll ask you
22:00
as a question um so uh let's assume that
22:03
there are eight planets in the solar
22:05
system yeah
22:05
how many planets in our solar system
22:07
orbit the sun of those eight
22:09
all of them ah technically if you go
22:11
into a super technical
22:13
uh reasoning we orbit the sun because at
22:15
the center of the gravity that's pulling
22:17
us
22:17
making us over the sun is in the middle
22:18
of the sun jupiter is so
22:20
large it's so big that it's pulled the
22:22
center of gravity
22:23
out to above the sun's surface so
22:26
technically
22:27
they are orbiting each other that's
22:28
really good yeah it's quite cool isn't
22:30
it i had no idea jupiter was
22:31
that big it also has a massively fast
22:33
day jupiter
22:34
that's it so yeah it rotates uh every 10
22:37
hours
22:38
so daytime and nighttime each last about
22:40
five earth hours oh which is really
22:42
short it's faster than any other planet
22:45
and if it was 80 times larger which is
22:47
not that much larger it could have been
22:48
a star
22:49
jupiter wow yeah what would it done to
22:52
us
22:53
i think we'd be in big trouble yeah
22:55
issues right probably
22:56
hey so i found this fact when i was
22:58
reading a book called the jupiter effect
23:01
which is written by john gribben who
23:03
most people know is a massive popular
23:05
science writer he wrote in search of
23:06
schrodinger's cat
23:08
um and this book is the one book that he
23:10
wants people to forget about so i
23:11
apologize
23:13
because you've met john riben haven't
23:14
you i have yeah uh he'll be delighted
23:17
that you're bringing this up
23:18
i'm really sorry but it is out there and
23:19
it is it's a really well written book
23:21
except for one thing which it has a
23:22
conceit of it which is that
23:24
basically there was going to be a
23:25
ginormous earthquake at the san andreas
23:27
fault
23:28
um on march the 10th of 1982 because
23:30
they believed that all the planets were
23:32
going to align and it was just going to
23:33
set off chaos on earth
23:35
which never happened it was a bestseller
23:36
though but it didn't happen and so they
23:38
he's kind of buried that book by writing
23:40
about 200 more books
23:42
to separate he writes tons of books and
23:45
they're all brilliant they're all
23:46
brilliant yeah
23:47
but yeah do you think that's the reason
23:48
he writes so many i think just so we
23:50
could go
23:50
down that bibliography list i'm just
23:53
going back to the sun very quickly
23:55
yes what would happen if you replace the
23:56
sun with a black hole so
23:58
uh there'd be less light yeah for
24:01
starters
24:02
less energy coming from it you would
24:04
think yes
24:05
um so we'd all freeze to death and we
24:08
would get sucked into it
24:11
there we are that's finally the thing
24:12
yeah no apparently uh this so the oxford
24:14
university science blog looked into this
24:16
and they found that apparently the
24:18
planets orbits would stay kind of much
24:20
the same because if it's the same mass
24:21
of the sun this black hole
24:23
then the gravitational field it produces
24:24
is about the same as that of the sun
24:26
but it will be cold and dark the sun is
24:29
obviously missing loads of heat but
24:31
jupiter was all my jupiter
24:32
jupiter radiates so much heat but it
24:34
loses it faster than it gains
24:36
energy from the sun which means that
24:38
it's shrinking about two centimeters a
24:39
year
24:40
what yeah two centimeters a year yeah i
24:42
mean it's massive so that's relatively
24:44
quite small amount but that's yeah
24:46
mad yeah are there planets out there
24:48
that we've seen exoplanet style that
24:50
would be
24:50
just enough atmosphere tall enough that
24:53
a six foot person could stand in
24:54
and sort of like run their life but
24:57
that's where the planet ends well that's
24:58
the only
24:59
yeah so if you were to go to i think
25:02
it's
25:02
mars yeah they have a very very very
25:05
weak atmosphere
25:06
and so it would kind of feel like winter
25:09
at your head but
25:10
spring at your feet wow yeah so
25:13
so you kind of your head would be out of
25:14
the atmosphere kind of so
25:17
you have to what do you have to where do
25:19
you spend christmas
25:21
do you have to go up a step ladder
25:23
basically for christmas
25:24
and then for summer just lie on the
25:26
floor summer collection just lie down
25:29
you have one more do you know what else
25:30
is fueled by the sun superman
25:32
according to dc comics really know this
25:35
because once he was bitten by dracula
25:37
and dracula exploded
25:38
what science guys
25:42
[Laughter]
25:46
wait hang on dragging a bite superman
25:48
then superman explodes dracula explodes
25:50
because dracula vampires don't like
25:52
sunlight
25:52
how do we know superman isn't made out
25:53
of garlic
26:00
[Music]
26:02
okay it's time for a final fact of the
26:04
show and that is
26:05
james okay my fact this week is that in
26:07
1945
26:09
police in halifax nova scotia initiated
26:12
a campaign to stop people from beeping
26:14
their car horns in most code
26:16
to signal out vile and filthy language
26:19
and what were they saying in the north
26:21
code do we know
26:22
this is the weird thing right so i saw
26:24
this on a website called boing boing
26:26
which is one of my favorite places
26:28
online they have amazing facts and stuff
26:29
like that on there
26:30
and it was a news cutting and i'm pretty
26:34
sure the news cutting is real because i
26:35
found it in other places
26:37
but that's the only thing on the whole
26:40
of the internet that seems to give
26:41
any idea that this actually happened now
26:43
i see why you were throwing shade at my
26:45
ham sandwiches that you're trying to
26:46
draw attention from your own
26:49
sourcing yeah fair enough um i just i
26:52
don't know if it's true if anyone knows
26:54
any more then do let us know but i think
26:55
it's a really
26:56
it's a nice idea if it's not true right
26:58
yeah it's i don't
26:59
think it's the most uh eloquent way to
27:02
swear at someone
27:02
through most it takes a long time
27:07
yeah if you're in traffic though you do
27:08
have time so you might as well
27:10
send a message yeah you're relying on
27:12
the person who is a dick
27:13
knowing um yeah yeah it's quite funny
27:17
because it does sound like you're
27:18
actually just bleeping yourself
27:20
yeah as you're swearing at someone
27:23
so this is 1945 that's right what kind
27:26
of
27:26
car horns were we at that point what
27:28
kind of cars were we at at that point
27:30
well we will have had cars that are not
27:33
a million miles dissimilar to
27:35
cars that we have now they're combustion
27:37
engines so
27:38
maybe slightly bigger american cars that
27:40
kind of thing yeah so the 50s is where i
27:42
start to
27:43
clock what a car is okay so imagine five
27:45
years before that
27:46
[Laughter]
27:51
like a horn sound since the very
27:52
beginning of things with wheels on the
27:54
road haven't they yeah yeah so they
27:55
pre-date cars
27:56
yeah and they weren't they originally
27:57
outside the cars and people would walk
27:59
alongside carriages with horns or they'd
28:01
walk alongside cars with horns
28:03
if you were just walking you had a you
28:05
had a horse i i've heard yeah i've read
28:07
this as well
28:08
pedestrians carried the first car horns
28:11
to warn cars and then eventually they
28:12
said why don't we combine this with the
28:14
car
28:14
i read that there was an early
28:16
locomotive act and
28:17
the idea was that cars used to travel
28:19
really slowly
28:20
and to warn people that cars are on the
28:22
way someone would walk ahead of the car
28:24
with a red flag
28:25
okay so andy knows everything about this
28:26
yeah is it true is this true
28:28
uh not really oh okay it's true that the
28:31
act existed the act existed yep
28:33
uh and the red flag thing was used and
28:36
you you would have to have three people
28:38
operating a vehicle one to
28:39
steer it one to stoke the boiler and one
28:42
to walk ahead was called the stalker
28:44
with the red flag yep
28:45
however i think that when the act was
28:48
introduced
28:48
cars were not a thing uh because it was
28:51
in about the 1870s and by the time
28:54
people started having personal cars the
28:56
red flag bit
28:57
was not observed not and have been
28:59
repealed okay from memory yeah that's
29:01
yeah that's how it went
29:02
so yeah um i was looking online about
29:05
um sometimes in morse code you know how
29:08
on
29:09
text messages you know lol for life out
29:11
loud there's a long list of
29:12
how they do abbreviations for longer
29:14
sentences um
29:16
so uh one of my favorite ones and this
29:19
is goodbye
29:20
so i want to see who gets this if you
29:21
were doing a shortened morse code of
29:23
goodbye
29:23
it's dsw why would it be dsw
29:27
don't darling what did no dsw you were
29:30
doing
29:31
for three words no it doesn't actually
29:33
no
29:34
then i'm not gonna know it dsw i would
29:37
have thought i would have gone for cu
29:39
because that would be shorter yes it
29:41
would have been yeah so what's dsw dsw
29:43
i can't actually pronounce it but james
29:45
will be able to because
29:46
it's second yeah yeah isn't that
29:49
interesting
29:50
it's russia yeah russian does without
29:52
yeah that's a goodbye dsw
29:55
goodbye and then humor is hi humor
29:57
intended
29:58
h-e-e is humor intended or laughter we
30:00
should we should absolutely start using
30:02
these after some of our jokes on the
30:03
show
30:04
i can just say hi after one of my puns
30:07
uh here's another thing i hadn't heard
30:09
of
30:10
uh hogmorse have you heard of hogmore's
30:12
hogwarts yeah it's from
30:14
hogmors is that is it bad morse is it
30:17
like piglet it's it's autocorrect
30:19
it's basically autocorrect for when
30:21
you're doing more so it's the um most
30:22
commonly made mistakes when you're doing
30:24
morse code what does it mean is it like
30:26
letters which are similar or
30:28
yeah it's um it's basically called after
30:30
one example home
30:32
becoming hogg one example given in the
30:34
literature is please fill me in becoming
30:36
six nas fimi q i see so m
30:39
e is going to be dash dash dot or
30:42
something but then
30:43
g is going to be dash dash dot without a
30:45
space yes yeah and so
30:47
i guess there's a risk of everything
30:48
going really out of kilter if you mix up
30:50
something and then
30:50
you get out of sync with the person
30:52
receiving and they think your letters
30:53
end and start in different places
30:54
and then it just turns into gold yeah um
30:56
so this was this whole fact about a kind
30:58
of
30:58
secret message being sent out basically
31:00
it's a rude secret message
31:01
um so i found another example of this
31:03
kind of thing another thing from the
31:05
second world war
31:06
so chinese engravers who are designing
31:08
banknotes
31:09
changed the design of chinese banknotes
31:11
uh to score points off the japanese
31:14
who are occupying their country yeah so
31:16
for example the one you
31:18
end note very very common note um it has
31:20
a picture of confucius on it and he's
31:22
he's making a gesture of prayer
31:24
uh almost uh it looks quite uh buddhist
31:27
almost
31:28
and the uh some engravers changed some
31:30
of the banknotes they made so that
31:32
confucius is doing the um
31:33
the classic uh sex mime where you you
31:36
use one uh
31:37
your thumb and finger on one hand and
31:39
the finger on the other and for people
31:40
at home
31:41
andy is doing said mine yeah great radio
31:44
classic sex mind as he put in
31:47
yeah so they did that um here's a thing
31:50
about
31:50
um signaling out violent filthy language
31:53
an article from the daily mail from a
31:54
couple years ago
31:56
mother lauren walker had endured a day
31:58
from hell at the hands of her son max
32:01
the two-year-old had smeared their dog
32:03
in butter and put jam in the dvd player
32:06
then he decided he didn't want the fish
32:08
pie she had spent two
32:09
hours making so she then spelt out the c
32:13
word in his alphabet potato shape
32:18
i don't know how that becomes news but
32:20
it didn't make me laugh it must be a
32:22
photo on instagram that
32:23
gets picked up or something like that i
32:25
was just fake i was reading
32:27
um about and and president andrew
32:29
jackson he had a parrot that he taught
32:30
to swear
32:31
and apparently he attended his funeral
32:33
and started swearing really loudly his
32:34
funeral had to be taken out
32:36
taken out by the secret service just
32:42
open up the coffee to chuck it in with
32:43
them
32:45
um there is a an online service called
32:48
eggplantmail.com
32:49
uh where you can send a message to your
32:52
loved one
32:53
and the idea is that in emojis um
32:57
a aubergine is a signal for um
33:00
something sexual and this company will
33:03
send a real-life
33:04
aubergine to your loved one and they'll
33:06
inscribe a message on it
33:08
and it's supposed to be a signal it's
33:10
like doing a real life emoji
33:13
it's quite good isn't it yeah and they
33:14
describe themselves as 100
33:16
phallic 100 anonymous and 100 percent
33:20
disturbing
33:22
and 100 added math
33:31
okay that's it that's all of our facts
33:33

01:20
now do you guys want to start with one
01:22
okay uh what have i got uh
01:26
oh yeah i like this one so it's about
01:29
soon and now and it's from
01:32
from alex hello thank you very much alex
01:34
hi alex okay so the fact is
01:36
the word soon used to mean right now but
01:39
people would misuse it and so it came to
01:41
mean
01:42
in a bit
01:45
because maybe some people started saying
01:47
soon to mean right now but then they
01:48
were a bit delayed on their way
01:50
and so they got to the place and then
01:52
someone said oh they must have meant in
01:53
a bit yeah
01:54
that's our language can i read another
01:57
one here yeah yeah
01:58
i just read this and this seems i well i
02:00
actually don't believe it
02:03
so kieran where are you kieran's
02:05
favorite fact
02:06
kieran you better be right about this
02:10
according to kira
02:15
um the number plate of the car in which
02:18
franz ferdinand was shot
02:19
is the date that world war one ended
02:25
do you know what that how exact a date
02:27
is it 18
02:28
or is it literally 11 11 18 or i've got
02:31
a picture of the car
02:32
okay and it's this is east sussex world
02:35
war
02:36
one dot org dot uk
02:39
and it says did you know the archduke's
02:41
number plate reads a
02:42
one one one one one eight so that could
02:46
be
02:46
11 11 18. kieran i take it all back
02:51
that's really good one thing i know
02:53
about franz ferdinand is that
02:55
they used to sew him into his clothes oh
02:58
yeah
02:59
really and so when he was shot they
03:01
couldn't really loosen his clothes
03:02
because
03:03
um obviously they he was like sewn into
03:06
them
03:06
and that was perhaps one of the reasons
03:08
why he died because they couldn't get
03:09
the bullet out
03:10
maybe the shooting thing but
03:14
let's not lay a hundred percent of the
03:15
blame at the closed door
03:27
[Music]
03:31
arrested and sent away except there's
03:32
one guy who went to buy a bagel
03:33
somewhere else in town
03:35
and he stepped out and i think he was
03:36
holding a sandwich in one hand
03:38
as franz ferdinand and his wife went
03:40
past not only went past
03:42
the car broke down oh yeah he stood
03:44
there with the bagel and the car
03:46
just stopped and he was like uh
03:49
because he thought that it was going a
03:50
completely different direction and then
03:51
i'm pretty sure there might be a
03:52
historian in here
03:53
he then tried to kill himself the bullet
03:55
ricocheted into
03:57
no no no failed about six times because
04:01
he jumped into
04:02
he fleed into a river so he jumped over
04:04
a bridge he thought this will this will
04:05
kill me um
04:06
i'll drown it didn't and the river was
04:08
only about that high so he ended up
04:10
breaking his legs and he took a cyanide
04:12
pill but it was old so he ended up
04:13
vomiting
04:14
and then before the police got there all
04:16
the locals got there and started beating
04:18
him up so he'd
04:19
he was soaked with broken legs with
04:21
vomit coming out from a fake side like
04:22
getting his ass kicked by locals
04:24
it was a terrible end to it was that one
04:26
of the other i think that was one of the
04:27
other guys wasn't it
04:29
who tried and failed yeah the main guy
04:31
was gabrielle princeton
04:32
yeah yes i've been to that um to that
04:34
bridge actually
04:35
and my memory is that that river was a
04:37
bit deeper than
04:39
but is there any historians in who know
04:41
that story no
04:43
okay well we'll go with it then we'll
04:44
believe it i know i got all that by the
04:46
way from a ben elton novel so i'm not
04:48
sure
04:48
oh and in that franz ferdinand is killed
04:52
by a time traveler
04:53
so um i've got one here from harrison
04:57
fleming
04:58
harrison fleming there we go australian
05:00
bushrangers
05:01
brackets outlaws would put their
05:03
horseshoes on their horses
05:05
backwards so that their traps would
05:06
appear to be going in the opposite
05:08
direction okay
05:10
isn't that cool and i like that because
05:11
apparently that's what yeti's doing
05:16
they take their feet off and they put
05:17
them on the other way round so when you
05:19
think they've gone that way
05:20
they've busted loose that way yeah and
05:22
that's the only reason we've never seen
05:24
them is that right
05:26
according to the park ranger at the yeti
05:28
park he says they can turn themselves
05:29
invisible
05:32
that's the yeti park in bhutan yes yeah
05:34
did you go to it you've been to the town
05:36
i've been to bhutan but i didn't go to
05:37
the yeti park
05:38
maybe you did
05:42
is it world's happiest country or has a
05:44
happiness minister doesn't it uh
05:45
yeah i mean they they show you round and
05:48
you only see the bits that they want you
05:49
to see
05:49
so it seems like a very happy country
05:51
but um so maybe the happiness minister's
05:53
just focusing on those parts for now
05:55
we did do this on the podcast but it got
05:57
rejected which is that um according to
05:59
poland's
06:00
only officially registered ghost hunter
06:03
the ghosts in poland are now going on
06:05
strike
06:06
um and the reason they're going on
06:07
strike is they're sick of our skepticism
06:09
towards them so they've said
06:10
they said to him if you're going to have
06:12
that attitude we're not going to bother
06:14
haunting you anymore
06:16
but isn't that a good like oh none of
06:19
the crockery's broken like that's a good
06:21
thing isn't it
06:23
i don't know the walls aren't covered in
06:24
ectoplasm
06:27
not for the ghost hunter they'll have to
06:28
start breeding them ghosts
06:30
yeah it's not just killing people
06:36
um so i've got a factor from emily and
06:38
alan a joint effort
06:40
are those guys hi is it just used emily
06:43
like on the other side of the room you
06:44
had a fight
06:47
and this is that um the u.s military
06:51
bled
06:51
ac dc music at general noriegas who was
06:54
a 1980s dictator in panama wasn't he
06:57
at general noriega's compound in panama
07:00
for two days continuously to remove
07:02
him and he surrendered as a result
07:06
is it the third i think that's yeah it
07:07
depends which album yeah
07:10
now you won't believe this but andy
07:12
knows every single ac dc album and
07:14
that's all he listens to at the office
07:16
you know
07:16
i've got six
07:20
i'll tell you what though after the
07:21
second one they start getting pretty
07:23
repetitive
07:25
uh let's do one more from your side um
07:27
okay well i have one here it's got a
07:29
really nice picture on so that's the
07:30
reason i'm reading it
07:31
uh by amy east east he's hot oh hello
07:35
front row um it is that symptoms of
07:38
asthma
07:39
can be treated with a roller coaster
07:41
ride and there's a nice picture of
07:42
someone on a roller coaster
07:46
so derolica's not your gallstones as
07:48
well they said this week yeah
07:50
do they cure everything so someone did a
07:52
study kidney stones maybe
07:53
yeah they took fake kidneys onto roller
07:56
coasters
07:57
and they put stones into them and then
07:59
the stones would kind of work their way
08:01
out of these fake kidneys and it
08:02
happened more if you were at the back of
08:04
the roller coaster than at the front
08:06
but doesn't it matter how they work
08:07
their way out because they haven't put a
08:08
person who feels actual pain around the
08:10
fake kidney
08:11
so if they're working their way out
08:12
through your spinal cord
08:16
that isn't a viable solution to kidney
08:18
stones that's true
08:20
shall we hurry up yeah yeah you go this
08:22
is from anna martinez
08:24
oh hello anna and it's got a citation as
08:26
well which is why i like it
08:29
it's from nature from may 2007
08:33

09:10
more of a quiz question oh yeah
09:12
um according to steven spielberg this is
09:14
just talking about plants and rocks and
09:16
and animals according to steven
09:19
spielberg what is
09:20
e.t is he so eating the extraterrestrial
09:22
is he a plant
09:24
a rock or an animal uh i would decide an
09:26
animal a rock
09:27
he's a plant is he bollocks he's a plant
09:32
he's a plant he comes from a plant
09:34
planet and his job as a biologist
09:36
yeah yeah because i read i read the
09:38
sequel to e.t which is the search
09:41
i didn't okay i didn't read the actual
09:42
book i read the review on amazon
09:45
uh which says right at the end it's
09:47
written by william cosnickel and william
09:49
cosnickel wrote the original
09:50
novel of the of the movie so they're
09:52
like the screen adapted novel
09:54
and the review ends by saying i hope
09:57
there's a future sequel
09:58
in the trilogy of what should be a
10:00
trilogy of e.t because there are so many
10:01
unanswered questions left at the end of
10:03
this second book
10:05
for example what happens to the turnip
10:07
ship
10:09
when it goes into the multi-dimensional
10:11
wormhole
10:12
so spoiler alert for the end of the
10:14
novel part two
10:16
okay uh anna do you got one uh yeah so
10:18
this is another one this one's about
10:20
sean connery
10:21
sean connery was once pulled over and
10:23
fined by a british officer first
10:25
does that say speeding yeah it looks
10:27
like speeding but i assume
10:29
what are the odds it would be the word
10:30
speech
10:33
it could be how sean connery pronounces
10:35
spitting or something
10:38
the officer's name was sergeant james
10:40
bond
10:41
no that didn't have a citation actually
10:45
so
10:46
all right i got another one which is
10:48
that um
10:49
so i'll read the fact that we can find
10:51
out who it is uh who sent in afterwards
10:53
uh
10:53
wolfsburg football club's longest
10:55
serving manager
10:56
was slash is called wolfgang wolf
11:01
that's incredible that's very good who
11:03
was that
11:04
what's your name james i know some of
11:06
the funny football names yeah
11:08
there was one guy who played for chelsea
11:09
called naughty naughty
11:12
and you remember that guy um he was the
11:14
goalkeeper for australia when
11:16
england be australia ate one or
11:17
something i think it wasn't he was
11:18

11:21
[Laughter]
11:24
i've got a football factor which is
11:25
about a swiss football team i don't want
11:27
to give it away who's it from
11:29
michael so this is the fact
11:32
that swiss football team young boys
11:36
play at wankdorf stadium
11:41
very good fact i've got another one here
11:43
this is from katie clark
11:44
where are you katie oh hey hello uh okay
11:47
so
11:47
the flag that flies over big ben over
11:50
the houses of parliament
11:52
is the same size as wimbledon center
11:55
court
11:56
wow that's a big-ass flag
12:00
that is huge you're not thinking table
12:02
tennis
12:03
i don't know i was walking past it the
12:04
other day and i did think what an
12:05
unusually large flag
12:08
i genuinely and i was walking past
12:11
wimbledon thinking what a small tennis
12:13
court
12:15
uh this is from mark is it mark
12:19
it's a drawing no fact just a nice
12:21
picture of you all
12:22
oh
12:27
mark's thought outside the box it's an
12:30
interesting choice for the fact to read
12:32
out
12:32
it's not that read out friendly there's
12:33
one there's one person in a tie which is
12:35
done there's one with big hair which is
12:36
james there's one who's got uh the
12:39
woman's hair which is you that's one
12:42
completely neutral stick man
12:47
it's a really good likeness
12:51
uh i got a fact here um this is
12:54
the reason that scuba divers roll out of
12:57
the boat
12:57
backwards is that if they rolled
13:00
forwards they would fall into the boat
13:08
and that was that was sent in by two
13:10
people
13:16
exact wording the handwriting yes
13:19
sam barton and ellen crane are you two
13:22
together
13:23
oh okay cheeky ones
13:26
all right should i read that in actual
13:28
fact yeah okay
13:29
um this is from ben and it is that major
13:31
league baseball umpires
13:33
are required to wear black underwear in
13:35
case they tear their trousers
13:40
my favorite fact about baseball is about
13:42
clarence blethen do you remember that
13:43
one
13:44
uh he was sliding into fourth base once
13:46
in 1920 and he bit himself on his own
13:48
ass
13:51
and he had to be taken out of the um out
13:53
of the gate you're gonna have to explain
13:54
that
13:55
he was very flexible he had false teeth
13:58
and they fell out and then
14:02
i really like there was um lou gehrig
14:04
very famous baseball player
14:06
more famous now so for lou gehrig's
14:09
disease
14:09
so i was reading a stephen hawking
14:11
biography and at the top they mentioned
14:13
lou gehrig's disease and then there's a
14:14
little footnote that says recent
14:16
research has shown
14:17
that lou gehrig didn't in fact die from
14:20
lou
14:21
gehrig's disease he died from something
14:23
very similar to lou gehrig's disease
14:26
so he's got a disease named after him
14:27
that wasn't what he had uh
14:29
just one more baseball yeah yeah yeah uh
14:32
see the cubs have got to the major
14:33
league
14:34
to the um to the finals this time 75
14:37
years or something
14:38
um but when i was reading about that i
14:40
heard about a guy called
14:41
joe sprints and in 1939 um he tried to
14:45
break the record for the highest
14:46
that anyone had dropped to baseball that
14:48
he could catch it
14:50
and so he got a blimp to go up 800 feet
14:53
and they dropped a baseball down he had
14:54
a glove and it came down
14:56
and it caught him in the glove hit him
14:58
in the face and it broke his nose and he
15:00
lost five teeth
15:02
worse still he dropped the ball
15:07
so this is from david to fact about a
15:08
rocking chair oh hi
15:11
um so this is that when the world's
15:13
largest rocking chair was built
15:14
it was immediately welded to the ground
15:16
because the sight of it rocking in the
15:17
wind terrified the locals
15:22
very good that's amazing sorry next fact
15:25
i've got one yep uh
15:26
it's about adam ant who's that from uh
15:29
what's your name i'm stephen stephen
15:31
hello uh so it's about adamant we all
15:32
know adamant don't we yeah
15:34
a music person yeah famed 80s music
15:38
person adamant
15:39
adamant used to walk paul mccartney's
15:41
dog
15:44
because adamant's mum was his cleaner
15:46
and he helped with the dog walking
15:50
i got one here which is that the kakapo
15:52
parrot
15:53
is an endangered species of parrot it
15:55
evolved
15:56
out of being able to fly so it can't fly
15:59
anymore
16:00
however they have forgotten that they
16:02
can't fly
16:04
and that's true they know that they can
16:06
fly but they don't ride on the ground
16:08
they climb up trees
16:09
they go to the end of branches and go
16:11
i'll have my fly now
16:13
and and they plummet to the ground and
16:15
it's killing them
16:16
yeah they're endangered now so they're
16:18
trying to stop them they're trying to go
16:19
you can't
16:21
and on top of that that's not on here
16:23
but they also have this thing where and
16:25
this was in there's a very famous
16:26
douglas adams book called last chance to
16:28
see
16:28
and he talks about how kakapo parrots
16:30
have a mating call that when they
16:32
when they do their mating call it's
16:34
really deep so deep it's kind of like
16:36
the base
16:37
of a stereo system so it's just this um
16:39
kind of noise
16:40
now the problem with the base of the
16:41
stereo system is the point is if you put
16:43
it in your room
16:44
no matter where it's playing from you
16:46
can't find the source that's meant to be
16:47
this
16:48
the idea of it's surround sound so their
16:50
mating call gets them nowhere because
16:53
the female parrot is like where are
16:55
where
16:56
and so she can never find the kakapo wow
16:58
that reminds me a bit of um
17:00
do you remember that story about lesbian
17:02
sheep so yeah
17:04
it doesn't it's like great
17:08
no so um there are lesbian sheep and the
17:10
thing is if you're a female sheep
17:12
and you want to mate what you do is you
17:14
stand perfectly still and wait for the
17:16
male to come and mount you
17:17
and so when you've got two lesbians
17:19
sheep and they both stand perfectly
17:21
still
17:22
and so they're both kind of stood there
17:23
looking at each other
17:25
are you gonna go or am i that's amazing
17:29
so that bird fact did anyone see the um
17:32
documentary this week which showed that
17:33
kind of sea bird and i can't know what
17:34
it is it's like a little puffin
17:36
that lives at the top of a cliff and it
17:38
rises they rear one
17:39
young one youth every year and then as
17:42
soon as the youth is ready they push it
17:44
off the cliff really really high and it
17:46
has to stick its wings out and try to
17:48
hit
17:48
the sea but the sea isn't directly below
17:50
it the sea is about
17:51
150 meters away from the cliff 150 and
17:55
it's unbelievably far they're
17:56
unbelievably high and there are loads of
17:58
wolves waiting to eat
18:00
and you just most of them just they go
18:02
they don't quite and they just do slow
18:04
motion filming are they going to make it
18:05
and most of them don't they hit the
18:06
ground
18:07
they tumble over and then the wolves
18:08
come up that should be in that wall
18:10
though that was pretty good
18:11
so if i'm just looking up with uh anna
18:14
we got another one
18:15
yeah sure um this is that which one do i
18:18
like here
18:19
okay i don't know who submitted this i
18:20
don't know anything about it but when
18:21
the ancient romans deployed lions
18:23
against germanic tribes
18:24
the tribesmen simply assumed they were
18:26
large dogs
18:28
i don't believe that it feels like
18:30
really an instinctive fear when you see
18:31
it
18:33
i can't imagine even if i've never seen
18:35
one going out it just looks like strange
18:37
it feels like you probably would get
18:40
scared of it the first time it turned
18:41
you into a ghost you'd probably
18:45
uh andy have you any um i do like this
18:47
one uh
18:48
john le carre's father once seduced a
18:50
woman on a night train
18:52
by claiming to be john le carre
18:57
[Laughter]
19:01
we would have known all the relevant
19:02
stuff about his childhood i suppose
19:05
yeah but you could you could just make
19:07
that no one knows john le carre well
19:09
enough that they'd be like oh yeah i
19:10
knew about his butterfly obsession when
19:12
he's like no one knows
19:13
anything he's a spy the guy's a spy
19:16
that's true
19:17
here's another one in 1996 two neighbors
19:20
in devon
19:21
spent a year hooting their owls unaware
19:23
they were
19:24
actually hooting at each other
19:25
[Laughter]
19:33
i was weirdly reading a story uh
19:35
yesterday about
19:36
this is from like 10 years ago in
19:37
iceland there was a lady who um
19:40
who was with this big party and she got
19:42
changed she just went off and got
19:43
changed and when she got changed no one
19:45
recognized her
19:46
and thought that the woman that was she
19:47
was before in the other clothing
19:49
had gone missing so they sent out a huge
19:51
day-long search party in order to look
19:53
for this lady
19:54
and the lady herself was in the search
19:56
party
19:58
going what did she look like again yeah
19:59
i'll help out
20:01
and then they worked out it was her just
20:02
in different clothing since you
20:04
mentioned birds my favorite thing about
20:05
birds this week that came out
20:07
is that they've just found out that
20:08
swifts can stay
20:10
in the air without touching the ground
20:12
or a tree
20:13
for ten full months without touching
20:16
down
20:16
one single time yeah it's not incredible
20:19
and we don't know how
20:20
they're sleeping or eating but they're
20:21
mating and eating
20:23
in the air aren't they they are eating
20:24
in the air are they mating i thought it
20:25
was pre-breeding season
20:27
and then maybe they do a little bit oh i
20:28
think they do a bit yeah they might do
20:29
recreation
20:33
yeah we think that they've seen that
20:34
they they gain altitude at
20:36
dusk at bedtime um and we think maybe
20:39
they do this
20:39
then they can go to sleep and then they
20:41
just gradually descend and by morning
20:43
when they wake up do they just wake up
20:44
in time
20:45
to look around they maybe sleep like on
20:46
a cloud because that's quite fluffy
20:52
okay this is about a place in canada
20:56
called church hill who's is that from oh
20:59
hello what's your name
21:01
clint i'm going to call you clint
21:08
was it klim klim k-l-i-m like that
21:11
okay well oh actually i've just noticed
21:14
your name is on this
21:17
[Applause]
21:20
so this is from clint
21:24
uh people in church hill canada leave
21:26
their car doors
21:27
unlocked in case neighbors need to make
21:30
a quick escape
21:31
from polar bears what
21:34
yeah that's good that isn't it i thought
21:36
because people always say that people in
21:37
canada leave their house doors unlocked
21:38
because they're so friendly
21:39
they're not friendly that is terrified
21:44
another thing you don't get there is
21:45
doorknobs right yeah
21:47
you still kind of do have some doorknobs
21:49
but if you make a new building in
21:50
vancouver you're not supposed to put
21:52
doorknobs on it
21:53
and that's so that all people who've got
21:54
arthritis will be able to use levers
21:56
instead of knobs
21:57
yeah that's or also polar bears we'll be
22:00
able to use them
22:04
okay this is a fact from alex about
22:06
oxymorons it's that
22:08
oxy is greek for sharp is greek
22:11
for dull
22:12
oxymoron is an oxymoron
22:16
[Music]
22:18
so good that's pretty good you can't
22:20
even know that
22:25
um we got just on on words uh we got
22:28
sent in because we asked people on
22:29
twitter as well to send in some facts
22:30
and i really like this
22:32
uh this is from someone called at stray
22:34
gym
22:35
and he said during the 1914 christmas
22:37
truce germans put up a sign
22:39
facing the british troops saying got mit
22:41
once
22:42
effectively god with us the british
22:44
responded by erecting a sign facing the
22:46
germans saying
22:47
we got mittens too
22:52
that's quite nice
22:56
how did they get across the slightly
22:58
offensive german accent in seinfeld
23:02
uh we got we got a fact here about fiji
23:04
and their
23:05
declaration of independence who was that
23:07
yeah what's your name
23:08
joe so uh this is joe's fact in 2010
23:12
fiji lost their declaration of
23:14
independence and had to ask britain for
23:16
a photocopy
23:22
um let's do a few more uh yeah so this
23:25
is about pistachios
23:26
uh is that your name aura you were just
23:28
a fall of possession
23:31
lucy so this is from lucy about
23:33
pistachios and this is the fact that if
23:35
too many pistachios are shipped in the
23:36
same container
23:38
they will self-heat and spontaneously
23:39
combust
23:41
wow is that true yeah is it have you
23:44
tried it
23:45
yeah do you remember uh
23:49
ages ago i i said this on the podcast
23:51
and then
23:52
uh everyone was like it can't be true
23:53
and i was like it's definitely true and
23:54
then we found out it definitely wasn't
23:56
true
23:56
um but i was i was told it by ash who's
23:59
up there in the corner ash is the uh
24:01
singer and composer of our theme tune
24:03
this is emperor yes
24:05
wasp sash and he told me and i used it
24:07
on the show i was like that's amazing
24:08
that when you're bringing sparkling
24:10
water overseas from somewhere
24:13
before you take the sparkling water into
24:15
a boat
24:16
you have to remove all the bubbles
24:18
because it will explode on the other
24:20
side or it will go unfizzy so what they
24:21
do is they take out all the bubbles and
24:23
then they ship the water out and then on
24:25
the other side they put the same bubbles
24:27
back in it's the same it's the fact that
24:31
it's the same bubbles that makes it
24:33
impossible
24:33
got to be the same ones we've got
24:36
bubbles
24:37
yeah yeah and then and then i told i
24:39
told ash i was like after we found out
24:40
that it wasn't real which
24:42
like there's no even way to google that
24:43
because it's not not even the thing i
24:45
was like ash it's
24:46
like that wasn't real and he was like
24:48
yeah i know i found it wasn't real ages
24:50
ago yeah
24:53
it was the same episode when you said
24:55
that um if you have water which you
24:56
can't drink you can feed it to a camel
24:58
let it vomit it out and then it'll be
25:00
completely drinkable
25:03
and i still stand behind that fact
25:06
i'm pretty sure an explorer wrote into
25:08
us and said how do you mock it
25:10
oh you wrote into me i am an explorer of
25:14
sorts
25:14
yeah i found in a book it was like a
25:16
19th century explorer's book and he said
25:18
a good way to treat dehydration is to
25:20
drink the
25:20
vomit of a camel so i mean it was
25:22
obviously nonsense at the time but i
25:24
think people have believed it for a
25:25
while
25:25
i definitely remember reading a
25:26
reference but that's for dehydration and
25:28
not for poison
25:29
i'm not sorry it was about sorry it was
25:30
poison it was the toxins thing yeah yeah
25:32
so
25:33
the jury's out on whether if you're
25:34
dehydrated you should drink
25:36
camel vomit it's got liquid content why
25:39
we all being so squeamish about this
25:42
fight actually reminds me of bees i
25:44
think bees air condition themselves by
25:46
spitting
25:47
inside of their hives don't they so that
25:49
it creates like a nice bit of
25:50
condensation which cools them down in
25:52
summer
25:53
like that and they spit on each other's
25:54
faces to cool each other
25:56
so why you've been doing that to me no
26:04
okay turkey vultures um weed down their
26:07
own legs to cool themselves down yeah
26:10
which is why i've been doing that
26:13
this is actually sorry but you mentioned
26:15
vultures this is one of my favorite
26:16
facts i found on this series of qi we
26:18
just researched which is the term
26:19
the reason that vultures have bare necks
26:21
they don't have fur on their necks it's
26:23
because
26:23
it's quite hard for them to scavenge
26:25
actually because it's quite hard to get
26:26
into the body of a dead animal
26:28
so if there's not an open wound then
26:29
they find the easiest orifice to enter
26:31
through
26:32
and so they either go in through the
26:34
eyeballs of you know your dead deer or
26:36
they just go straight up the ass and the
26:38
reason
26:38
that they they have that little bare bit
26:41
is so they don't pull their heads out
26:42
covered in feces from the animal that
26:44
they've been scavenging inside
26:48
they do and they're covered in feces but
26:50
it doesn't kind of stick there because
26:52
they don't have all the feathers
26:53
yeah yeah yeah it's easier to remove
26:55
just to clarify that
26:57
yeah wait so that's literally why
26:59
they've evolved like that so they don't
27:01
you know get the rest of their body
27:02
covered in shape and their head is
27:04
well they don't usually need to crawl up
27:05
entirely inside the animal
27:07
usually just the neck is enough i know
27:10
but it's just odd that they haven't
27:11
worked out how to eat something else
27:12
that they've just thought well let's
27:15
let's just lose all the feathers here
27:16
and then we can keep
27:19
getting all over our heads this
27:22
is about german international
27:24
development
27:25
agencies ah
27:28
who is that joe hi joe
27:32
okay i pretty much already read all of
27:35
it
27:35
um the german international development
27:38
agency
27:39
is called jizz
27:43
it's called giz and then open brackets
27:46
jizz is g
27:50
g i z is that an acronym yeah but you
27:53
you do call it jizz great
27:58
uh andy have you have you got one yes
28:01
mine is also about german and about
28:04
squirrels anybody hello what's your name
28:08
ed hello it's fact is the german word
28:11
for squirrel
28:12
literally means oak crossover
28:19
yeah can we get some verification from
28:20
the back
28:24
they've left
28:29
that citation needed i think ed
28:34
this one's about kangaroos uh and it's
28:36
got a drawing on it does that
28:38
ring a ring a bell with anybody hello oh
28:41
right on the back what's your name
28:43
clint
28:47
lewis uh his facts from lewis and it's
28:50
it's i'm going to read it out verbatim
28:52
my fact is rubbish but i didn't google
28:54
it
28:56
brackets for shame on you googlers
28:59
then we get to the meat of the matter a
29:02
kangaroo
29:03
licks its arms to stay cool and then
29:06
there's a drawing of a kangaroo
29:09
licking its arms which is really good
29:11
that's quite good that's great
29:12
don't they um pose with their biceps
29:15
when they're trying to pick up
29:16
lady kangaroos yeah there's all these
29:18
photos where kangaroos are like oh
29:20
do you want me to get that like
29:22
genuinely bicep
29:23
sort of bodybuilding very famously have
29:26
three vaginas don't they yes
29:27
very famously within the qi office
29:32
yeah it's not in the australian national
29:34
anthem isn't it
29:36
speaking of things which have three
29:38
vaginas wait a minute
29:40
now are you gonna say what i think
29:41
you're gonna say i think i am
29:44
she doesn't have three vaginas no but do
29:46
you want us at utopol so a kangaroo has
29:48
three vaginas which means it has two
29:50
wombs
29:51
because it has two extra kind of bits
29:53
that go out to a womb
29:54
and does anyone know somebody else who
29:57
has two wombs
29:58
james found this out just today and i
30:00
want to use it i wanted to use it for
30:02
the show but they wouldn't let me
30:03
um mary berry mary berry
30:06
has two wounds has two and three vaginas
30:11
that's no way to speak about melon sue
30:13
and paul hollywood

=145.5 2016 Extra Bits
00:00
hi everyone james here this week's
00:02
podcast is a compilation
00:04
it's all the little bits from the last
00:06
year of fish which didn't quite fit in a
00:08
show
00:08
um but they're kind of self-contained
00:10
little nuggets and we put them all
00:12
together
00:13
for a little best of show i really hope
00:16
you enjoy it we'll be back next week
00:17
with a normal show
00:18
but in the meantime happy new year
00:31
[Applause]
00:32
some things that bees do that people
00:35
think is a lot of people think is
00:36
impossible
00:37
is fly and so this is uh it's constantly
00:41
claimed that they defy the laws of
00:43
physics and it's because an entomologist
00:45
in 1934
00:46
wrote a book in which he said i have
00:48
applied to insects the laws of air
00:49
resistance and have arrived at the
00:50
conclusion that their flight is
00:52
impossible
00:53
and it's not impossible obviously but
00:55
the way they do fly
00:57
is not by flapping their wings up and
00:59
down is by flapping them back and forth
01:01
so they go from front to back and it's
01:03
kind of like the motion of rowing oh
01:05
cool
01:05
i think so imagine uh you if you put
01:08
your hands out and your palm faces the
01:10
ground
01:10
and then you move your arms forward with
01:12
your palm facing the ground
01:13
and then when you get your arm in front
01:15
of you you flip your hand over so your
01:17
palms facing upwards
01:18
and you move your arm back and then they
01:20
fly with that motion so they're doing
01:22
backstroke
01:23
um is that you must have a really weird
01:26
backstroke dan
01:27
it's a bit more like the butterfly yeah
01:29
yes it is more like the butterfly but
01:31
it's not
01:31
oh okay and that creates kind of
01:33
vortexes which uh reduces pressure above
01:35
their wings and means they can fly but
01:36
isn't that cool they
01:37
that's very cool they float they float
01:41
[Laughter]
01:47
i was actually thinking about this
01:48
phrase yesterday because i saw a really
01:49
good play about him but
01:51
butterflies don't really float i mean
01:53
they fly right they don't they don't
01:55
just sit motionless in the air with
01:56
their wings hanging i just think it was
01:57
a bit of a flawed statement
01:59
but i think really it was more it was
02:01
like a poem wasn't it really
02:03
it was just the thing that he said and
02:05
it scanned nicely and
02:06
yeah i just it wasn't really
02:08
biologically accurate enough
02:10
well you wanted to be what float like a
02:11
log like a log sting like a b that would
02:14
be much
02:15
much like a boxer
02:19
imagine if muhammad ali had a few
02:21
penalty friends like you hanging out
02:23
when he was like i've got this new line
02:24
i'm not sure can we go for the log one
02:26
i'm gonna do the i'm gonna do the
02:28
butterfly
02:28
okay on your head bit man
02:32
[Music]
02:34
um early weather forecasters would steam
02:36
on wet days
02:37
on television what do you mean steam
02:40
their maps no their clothes would steam
02:41
gently yeah i saw that but i didn't
02:44
understand why was it the heat of the
02:46
no it was it was the heat of the lights
02:48
because they have been outdoors before
02:49
they weren't like it's going to be foggy
02:51
tomorrow
02:52
just creating a bit of atmos no they
02:55
would no it was just under the hot
02:57
lights and
02:57
in the bbc studios but i didn't know
02:59
this either the
03:01
met office is or until recently was part
03:03
of the ministry of defense
03:05
as a sort of affiliated body um and so
03:07
in the early days of weather forecasts
03:09
on the tv the weather charts were drawn
03:11
up at what was called the air ministry
03:13
and then they were rolled up and they
03:14
were put in a taxi to the bbc
03:17
so you could have lost the weather you
03:19
tried
03:20
that's good i like this from george
03:21
cowling who is the bbc's first weather
03:23
forecaster who said that there were a
03:25
few breakthrough moments where he
03:26
realized he was really nailing it
03:27
because weather forecasts were really
03:28
really boring before
03:30
the 50s when he sort of transformed them
03:32
um and he said there was one time quite
03:34
early into weather forecasting where he
03:36
predicted the weather and he said
03:38
rain would reach north wales in the
03:39
northwest coast of england around
03:41
lunchtime the following day
03:42
and he got a telegram from a viewer the
03:44
next day saying well done
03:45
rain arrived liverpool one o'clock slam
03:48
dunk mate
03:49
absolutely nailed that one
03:54
there's a company called celeb for a day
03:56
which offers on-demand paparazzi
03:58
services so you pay up to one and a half
03:59
grand
04:00
and um they'll just have a team of
04:01
photographers wait outside whichever
04:03
venue you're going through that night
04:04
and pretend that you're famous and shout
04:06
out questions for you and oh i'll do
04:07
that isn't that weird
04:08
i was at um an awards ceremony once um
04:11
and
04:11
left as the paparazzi were there and you
04:14
could kind of hear
04:15
them all for about a millisecond start
04:18
snapping their things and then realize
04:20
that i wasn't someone famous
04:21
and there's like an audible
04:25
screwing back of lens cap daniel
04:28
radcliff was performing in a play in the
04:29
west end he wore
04:31
the same outfit as he left the theater
04:33
every night of six months so the
04:34
paparazzi's photos weren't worth
04:35
anything so they looked exactly the same
04:37
i thought it was quite clever oh that's
04:38
quite clever yeah but they could report
04:40
on how bad he was smelling
04:42
more and more flies every every night
04:47
[Music]
04:50
so a study was done this year that found
04:52
that
04:53
in 20 of scientific papers on genetics
04:57
there are mistakes because excel
04:59
reformats gene names into dates
05:01
oh my god because it's in
05:04
one fifth of papers and that's because
05:06
genes have names like m
05:08
a r one or dec one or oct4
05:12
so they all look to excel like a date
05:15
and so in one fifth of papers this is a
05:16
mistake and also you know that thing in
05:18
excel where if you try to undo it once
05:20
it's reformatted it to a date
05:22
it then corrects to um how it stores
05:24
dates internally so for instance
05:26
if you are dealing with a gene which is
05:29
march
05:30
1 march 1 which is membrane associated
05:33
ring finger c3hc41 as
05:36
classic you all is it really is excel
05:39
reformats it to make it first of march
05:41
and then if you hit
05:42
undo it then makes it 42430 because
05:45
that's how it stores the first of march
05:46
and it's database
05:47
so all these poor geneticists are going
05:49
no it's a bloody gene and excel's going
05:51
no i think you mean the fifth of may
05:53
[Music]
05:54
[Applause]
05:56
one recent experiment i saw done with
05:58
mice is they gave it a molecule called
06:01
isrib and it makes them smarter
06:04
and they reckon this might be a molecule
06:06
you can give to humans to make them
06:07
smarter
06:08
okay how can they tell that it makes
06:09
them smarter because i've seen bitching
06:10
in the scientific community about the
06:12
fact that mice are the idiots of the
06:13
rodent world to the genius of rats
06:15
so are they trying to make them compete
06:17
with rats in what way are they smart
06:22
uh no they it's the basic way of seeing
06:24
how smart a mouse is
06:25
is by putting an underwater um platform
06:29
in a pool of water and then putting the
06:31
mouse in and seeing how long it takes
06:33
them to find the
06:34
platform i see that sounds very like
06:36
testing for witches
06:39
yeah then when it gets to the platform
06:40
you do burn it
06:42
as a wish
06:43
[Applause]
06:43
[Music]
06:45
there's a massive list of hundreds and
06:47
hundreds of foods on wikipedia that are
06:49
named after people
06:50
there's only two that really caught my
06:52
eye one is that van gogh has a potato
06:53
named after him
06:55
but also jesus has only one food
06:58
really and we won and we learned that
07:00
donald trump has two named after him in
07:02
his thanksgiving dinner that he had last
07:04
month
07:04
two of the dishes served were named
07:06
after him
07:07
yeah it was a chocolate cake wasn't it
07:09
chocolate cake and a salad yeah
07:10
so he had the trump salad and the
07:12
massive racist chocolate cake
07:14
yes
07:17
[Music]
07:19
have you guys read about this guy claude
07:21
ruggieri
07:22
no so claude ruggieri was an italian who
07:24
was living in paris in 1806
07:26
and according to marshall space flight
07:28
center uh
07:29
he used to send animals into space on
07:32
balloons
07:33
i think oh no sorry he sent animals onto
07:35
space in his own homemade rockets and
07:37
then
07:38
they were recovered by a parachute how
07:40
were they when they were recovered
07:42
they were really healthy actually yeah
07:44
um apparently
07:45
french authorities halted ruggieri's
07:47
plans when they came to
07:48
suggest launching a small boy using a
07:50
rocket cluster
07:52
you do see occasional stories of someone
07:53
who's tied a lot of balloons to a chair
07:56
and and flies up you've watched up by
07:58
pixar
07:59
oh yeah yeah no no no is that true no
08:01
you see people trying it
08:02
and then they shoot a balloon to to sort
08:04
of bring themselves down again it's not
08:06
inconceivable that he would have done
08:08
that and assumed because he never saw
08:09
them again they must have kept going up
08:12
i mean how long until the first person
08:13
who was just a normal person worked out
08:15
that when they let a balloon off into
08:16
the air
08:17
that it did pop and come back down you
08:19
would just assume it i would assume it
08:21
would just keep going
08:22
they didn't really have balloons for
08:23
quite a long time no that's true yeah
08:25
yeah
08:26
i think they have bladder so like um
08:27
they had bladders did they have helium
08:29
no no no no
08:30
it would be hot i wouldn't know they
08:31
would use they would like fire
08:32
underneath yeah they didn't really
08:34
isolate helium until quite late on okay
08:37
so
08:37
there goes that theory
08:42
[Music]
08:45
there are like northern words that i
08:47
would use that you guys would never use
08:49
like for instance i would say ginnell
08:51
for um a path between two houses
08:54
and i would use that i mean i don't use
08:55
it every day but every time i walk
08:57
every time i walk through a guinnel i
08:59
would use that word you would say you
09:00
because you constantly say out loud the
09:02
things you're doing as you're doing yeah
09:04
and i i'm from london i will constantly
09:06
say things like liberal elite media
09:08
bubble
09:08
[Laughter]
09:10
but not really because it's like in the
09:11
same way fish don't have a word for
09:12
water
09:15
[Applause]
09:18
just a little thing about the guinness
09:20
book of records oh yeah um that's been
09:22
going for a long time it's
09:24
first compiled by two brothers norris
09:25
and ross mcwhirter
09:27
and someone had a bet about what was the
09:29
fastest burden they decided to put down
09:30
this
09:31
group of all the records in the world
09:33
the first one it took them 16 weeks and
09:35
they sent loads of letters to experts
09:37
and consultants around the world
09:39
but the problem was that people would
09:40
just exaggerate all the time
09:42
and so they got a letter from a guy in
09:45
africa saying that they'd measured the
09:46
flight of a fly
09:48
at 820 miles an hour that's twice the
09:51
speed of sand
09:53
and this guy wanted them to put that in
09:55
as the world's fastest fly
09:58
well and they just heard the buzzing
09:59
reached them
10:04
[Applause]
10:07
[Music]
10:08
just one really interesting ecosystem
10:10
that exists and that's really important
10:12
is whale fall so i didn't know about
10:14
this but whale carcasses
10:15
are really important habitats as well to
10:16
other creatures and not many of them
10:18
have been found but basically when
10:19
whales die
10:20
then creatures live in them on the
10:22
bottom of the ocean we haven't found
10:23
many but when we do we tend to find new
10:25
species on them
10:26
so first of all a bunch of scavengers
10:28
live inside the whale carcass and eat
10:30
all the flesh of them
10:31
and then these bone-boring animals come
10:33
along so
10:34
for instance we found a new species of
10:35
bone-boring worm in 2005 living in a
10:38
whale carcass
10:39
and it's called the bone eating snot
10:40
flower which
10:42
yeah and it was really cool because it
10:44
looks the reason it's called that is
10:45
because it looks like a flower its
10:46
backside looks like a flower as it pokes
10:48
out of the
10:48
bone as it's gnawing into it and then
10:51
after the bones have been eaten then
10:53
bacteria comes along and then other
10:55
stuff comes and feeds on that
10:56
so they create these like really vital
10:58
ecosystems whale carcasses
11:00
that's like i was reading an article
11:01
about ocean animals that live
11:03
purely on land-based food
11:07
so logs when logs and plants go into the
11:09
ocean
11:10
and 90 of the animals that are found in
11:13
these logs aren't found anywhere else
11:15
on any other uh bit of coral or wherever
11:18
in the ocean that's their living place
11:19
90 percent so they just have to wait for
11:22
another log to fall in
11:23
and some of them are a really long way
11:25
in the ocean they're not
11:27
coastal you know it's mad you can see
11:29
why people used to think that animals
11:30
just came from nowhere because you would
11:32
find a log there and suddenly there were
11:33
tons of animals
11:34
yes and people thought that they would
11:36
just come from rotten logs or whatever
11:37
so that's why you know the tate and lyle
11:40
image is the lion with a load of bees
11:42
flying out of it oh that's the famous
11:44
technical image that's because they
11:45
thought that uh bees were generated
11:47
spontaneously from lion carcasses
11:49
the idiots
11:53
[Music]
11:54
um i was reading about elephant penises
11:57
and they sound
11:58
very very cool um they use their penis
12:01
to swat away flies
12:03
yeah and also if they have like an itch
12:05
on their belly they'll just use their
12:06
penis to itch
12:07
their belly no we all do that dan
12:10
i can use it to which you know that bit
12:12
at the back that you can't quite reach
12:24
[Applause]
12:25
did you know i just had no idea about
12:27
this colin powell wanted to run for
12:29
president in the 90s
12:30
um in 1996 and he decided not to because
12:33
his wife was too worried that he would
12:35
be assassinated
12:36
by white supremacists yeah and that's
12:38
the thing that michelle obama said
12:39
she had to be really talked into when
12:41
obama wanted to run was the risk of
12:42
being assassinated or
12:44
harmed by white supremacists yes there
12:47
was an assassination attempt on obama
12:49
which barely anyone knows about because
12:52
the secret service didn't notice it
12:53
until four days later
12:55
and it wasn't even them who noticed it
12:57
was one of the ushers one of the house
12:59
cleaning staff at the white house
13:00
when they saw that one of the windows
13:02
had gun bullets fired through it
13:05
one of the windows is smashed yeah and
13:06
they had no idea and they eventually
13:08
caught the guy he's in jail now he's
13:09
serving 25 years
13:10
um and they found bullet holes yeah in
13:13
the white house
13:15
it's a long time to go
13:21
[Music]
13:22
[Applause]
13:22
[Music]
13:23
[Applause]
13:26
the man who developed the noise the the
13:29
reversing noise the beep beep beep
13:33
not that actually it's the actual beep
13:34
his name is chris hanson abbott he
13:36
developed it in the 1970s and it's used
13:38
all over the world now
13:38
and he regrets that sound and because he
13:40
says that everyone finds it really
13:41
annoying and he hates it so he developed
13:42
a new one which is like sort of
13:45
and it sounds a bit like c wave waves
13:47
crashing in the sea yeah but in
13:49
short bursts and now that he's trying to
13:50
get that adopted and it's beginning to
13:52
be
13:52
used surely the whole point of that is
13:54
it's annoying yeah yeah
13:55
exactly you don't want to have um your
13:57
you know your alarm going off in the
13:58
morning and it's just
13:59
beautiful relaxing
14:04
to be easy to recognize and to work out
14:05
where the sound is coming from but
14:07
that's slightly different from being
14:08
annoying so he regrets that he made it
14:10
too effective and too annoying and now
14:12
he's trying to make one that does the
14:13
same job but is less intrusive than
14:15
julia
14:16
i think the speaking person is way more
14:17
annoying very cool
14:19
yeah for me that's i know that's why
14:21
that's what the beepers told me oh i
14:23
like the ones where
14:24
you've got the money trucks and they're
14:25
like please help help i'm under attack
14:27
please call the police have you seen
14:28
those yeah that's so weird
14:30
yeah i've never heard the noise though
14:31
it's literally it's literally a person
14:33
just shouting that and it's a recording
14:34
of a person saying help help
14:36
i am under attack and so when you heard
14:37
that was the thing being actually
14:39
attacked well he was the one trying to
14:42
steal
14:44
[Music]
14:45
[Applause]
14:46
they also eat themselves jellyfish in
14:49
times of
14:50
need they eat their own bodies and
14:53
because they can survive with a small
14:54
portion of their bodies that's okay so
14:56
i think a jellyfish of 18 centimeters
14:58
can de-grow
14:59
uh to be 1.4 centimeters and then grow
15:02
back again
15:03
cool right is it when they're stressed
15:05
as well because octopuses chew their own
15:07
arms when they're really stressed
15:08
it's not nice no just when they're
15:10
hungry they're not very anxious
15:11
creatures
15:13
you wouldn't think there would be a net
15:14
gain of eating yourself though would you
15:16
like if i eat my finger i'm still gonna
15:18
be the same weight as i was before i ate
15:19
the finger
15:20
but you won't eat but you won't be
15:21
hungry
15:22
[Laughter]
15:23
so that's true it's a short-term
15:26
strategy
15:28
[Applause]
15:29
[Music]
15:33
[Applause]
15:33
[Music]
15:34
[Applause]
15:37
i've got one last thing that i really
15:38
like which is the lord of the rings um
15:42
the main characters of lord of the rings
15:43
the actors in real life
15:45
to celebrate the amazing time that they
15:46
had they all got a tattoo
15:48
which was of elfish for nine everyone
15:51
got it except for gimli
15:53
who didn't want to get it so he got his
15:55
stunt double to get it instead
15:59
and he did he's got it his stun doubles
16:02
like this random guy he's a part of the
16:03
character
16:04
have you seen my tattoo let me just
16:06
bring him up
16:09
[Applause]
16:12
[Music]
16:13
[Applause]
16:13
[Music]
16:14
[Applause]
16:17
[Music]
16:18
one thing about donald trump as well so
16:20
he you know has been the story in the
16:22
papers this week he's made this enormous
16:24
loss in his taxes the year he did this
16:25
1995
16:27
um two percent of net operating losses
16:29
occurred by american taxpayers in that
16:31
year
16:32
was donald trump oh yes
16:35
500 000 people declared a net operating
16:37
loss and he was two percent of the
16:39
entire sum
16:40
do you know that um his that's why it
16:42
makes sense that if you look at his tax
16:44
records which were published in the new
16:45
york times
16:46
um the figures are a bit off-kilter so
16:49
the first two digits of the nine hundred
16:50
and something million
16:53
that's because the tax software couldn't
16:56
take a figure that large
16:58
so his accountant had to add it manually
17:00
afterwards with the typewriter
17:02
because it was not rigged to be working
17:03
in the hundreds of millions
17:05
in terms of losses
17:06
[Applause]
17:09
[Music]
17:10
[Applause]
17:10
[Music]
17:11
[Applause]
17:14
it is one of the most dangerous jobs in
17:15
america assassinating a president no
17:17
being a president while also
17:19
assassinating presidents probably
17:21
yeah quite a few of them got shot didn't
17:22
they yeah yep
17:24
yeah yeah you can't really say it's one
17:25
of the most dangerous jobs in america
17:27
it's quite different to what it was 150
17:28
years ago isn't it
17:30
that's true that's true we wouldn't say
17:32
uh being a trawler men is one of the
17:34
most dangerous jobs in the world and
17:35
then for our evidence used for
17:37
men from the 1400s no although it is a
17:40
very dangerous job yes it is
17:41
it was actually quite a bad example for
17:43
me to choose i should have shown some
17:44
prison something
17:45
a really safe job now but was really
17:46
dangerous in the 1400s nonetheless if
17:48
there was a one in 10 chance of me being
17:49
shot
17:50
at qi i would resign immediately but
17:53
there's not a one intention well there
17:54
is a one in ten chance if you think
17:57
that's only because of my brilliant
17:58
points i keep on making
18:04
[Music]
18:04
[Applause]
18:06
so compasses weren't used to tell
18:08
directions for many many years after
18:10
they were discovered were they they were
18:11
discovered in china in the fourth
18:12
century bc roughly
18:14
or first built in china in the fourth
18:16
century bc
18:17
and they were used for feng shui
18:19
essentially so they were used for
18:21
spiritual reasons to decide where to
18:22
build a house or where to put your
18:23
furniture or where to have a tomb
18:25
um and yeah it was many hundreds of
18:27
years after that we learned that we
18:29
could actually use it to find places
18:30
a modern version so um satellite dishes
18:32
all point slightly east of south so if
18:34
you get lost in the city you can use a
18:35
dish to work out where north is
18:37
you even got a compass oh yeah although
18:39
if you see someone walking past your
18:40
house staring at your satellite dish you
18:42
do call the police and report a
18:43
suspected robber in the air
18:45
it's just lost my compass wasn't working
18:47
my
18:48
satellite dish method has led me to your
18:51
house
18:53
to your front door great another thing
18:56
in london at least and in other big
18:59
cities in the morning if you're lost
19:01
follow the crowd because they'll take
19:02
you to a tube station and in the evening
19:04
go against the crowd because they're
19:06
coming from a tube station
19:08
very good it's the other way
19:12
around in the morning everyone in the
19:14
center of the city everyone's walking
19:15
away from the tube station oh it's
19:17
center yeah i see i'm thinking where am
19:19
i going to be in the morning near my
19:20
house
19:22
but then to be honest i'm not lost in
19:23
that situation am i but i frequently
19:25
wake up in the middle of a city centre
19:27
and don't know where i am
19:28
so yeah what if you're so lost you can't
19:31
tell the difference between the city
19:32
centre and the outskirts so you don't
19:33
know whether to go with the crowd or
19:35
away from the crowd just study the
19:36
number of satellite dishes uh
19:38
yeah that's why we have that back up
19:41
[Applause]
19:41
[Music]
19:43
[Applause]
19:45
so the neutron stars are incredibly
19:46
heavy dense they weigh the same as half
19:48
a million earths but they would fit into
19:50
a ball the size of manhattan oh cool
19:53
they're
19:54
so dense how are they not falling out
19:56
the sky then
19:59
they are their own i was really missing
20:02
dad on this podcast
20:05
um they are so far away that is not a
20:08
problem
20:09
but um so those are neutron stars
20:11
magnetars are like
20:13
super neutron stars they are a thousand
20:15
times stronger we only know about 10 of
20:17
them
20:17
in our galaxy and the field strength is
20:20
a thousand trillion times stronger than
20:23
the earth's magnetic field
20:26
thousand trillion i know that's just a
20:28
very very large number yeah but what a
20:29
number
20:30
we can't really yeah it's too big we
20:32
can't get it into
20:36
[Music]
20:36
[Applause]
20:37
[Music]
20:38
[Applause]
20:40
[Music]
20:43
so obviously a lot of people like to
20:45
attack people who believe in
20:47
astrology and and so on and dave gorman
20:50
did a the comedian in britain for anyone
20:52
overseas dave gorman
20:54
he uh he did a show where he tried to
20:56
follow his horoscope
20:58
completely to the word for 30 days it
21:00
was a big experiment
21:01
and he was using all sorts of different
21:03
uh horoscopes but he was largely using
21:05
the one by jonathan kaner uh jonathan
21:08
kaner was a very famous
21:09
uh astrologer um for the sun i think it
21:11
was male 1 was it the male
21:13
yeah so gorman suddenly thought hang on
21:16
i think this guy has caught on to my act
21:19
here because
21:20
he just started finding that his
21:22
particular
21:23
horoscope reading was just a bit more
21:25
advanced
21:26
did i say you're going to kill him
21:27
tonight dave
21:30
here here's one that he had so he's at
21:31
pisces and on one of the days of the
21:33
entries
21:34
during the experiment when he knew that
21:36
gorman was doing this because it was
21:38
very much publicized
21:39
uh this was the entry stand on one leg
21:41
place a bowl of cereal in your left hand
21:43
and a tangerine in your right balance
21:45
three books on your head and jump
21:46
up and down what do you mean this is
21:48
difficult i haven't finished yet
21:49
sing the national anthem backwards and
21:51
jump into a bucket of water while still
21:53
on one leg peel the tangerine and flick
21:54
the segments into the bowl one at a time
21:56
why what do you mean why why not you
21:58
seem happy enough to take a bunch of
21:59
other daft orders for no good reason
22:01
today
22:02
and that was published in a newspaper
22:04
and gorman had to do that because it was
22:06
part of this
22:07
as well as part of his experiment
22:09
strange because my mom is a pisces and
22:11
we have always wondered about that
22:13
morning that one morning
22:15
[Applause]
22:18
[Music]
22:19
[Applause]
22:19
[Music]
22:20
[Applause]
22:23
there's a there's an aussie word that i
22:24
use that's not translated over here
22:26
uh which is khan c-a-r-n khan
22:30
and khan i've heard you say that i
22:31
thought it meant come on like it does
22:33
yeah but
22:33
it doesn't it doesn't get used here but
22:35
back home it does get used all the time
22:36
but it also it doesn't mean just come on
22:38
in the sense of like come on we're late
22:40
it also means come on as in like
22:41
oh come on like you know in the scene in
22:44
the titanic when the guy falls off and
22:45
he hits the rudder on the way down
22:47
his last word would have been can
22:49
because that would be like something
22:51
that as well yeah falling to my death so
22:53
yeah that's a big word that's not yet
22:54
made it over yeah i haven't seen titanic
22:57
what wow that's a whole big conversation
23:00
i know about the titanic so i mean i
23:02
figured it's like watching a long
23:03
documentary about something i already
23:04
know about
23:05
i have also not seen it but i think that
23:07
i've seen enough spoofs of it that i
23:09
pretty much know everything that happens
23:10
yeah um okay guys well aren't you guys
23:13
cool
23:14
yeah um there was you've seen titanic
23:17
too
23:19
i'm waiting for titanic three i can't
23:21
get enough he only watched titanic one
23:23
so he'd understand the plot line to
23:24
titanic
23:26
[Music]
23:27
[Applause]
23:28
[Music]
23:34
you know there's a there's a group of
23:35
there's a species of bee which only
23:37
lives in abandoned snail shells
23:39
really yeah it's a it's so it's a
23:41
solitary bee obviously it doesn't live
23:43
in a hive so
23:44
um yeah it's called osmium bicolor and
23:46
this is part of a group of bees called
23:48
helicophiles
23:49
or shell lovers and it's so sweet so the
23:52
female lays an egg
23:53
inside the shell and then it fills the
23:56
rest of it with grains of sand and
23:58
pebbles to act as a barricade against
24:00
intruders
24:00
and then she flies off and she comes
24:03
back with all these dried grass and
24:05
twigs and she covers over
24:07
this empty snail shell with her egg in
24:09
it and she glues it together with saliva
24:10
and she makes a little pyramid basically
24:12
for the egg
24:13
to rest inside and this is so cool so
24:16
this is from a feature on
24:17
wired i found this when she flies back
24:20
holding a twig it does look like it's a
24:21
bee
24:22
riding a tiny broomstick it's amazing
24:26
[Applause]
24:27
[Music]
24:31
the coolest thing i think about snails
24:33
sorry just quickly
24:34
is that they can walk upside down on
24:37
water
24:38
and um this is incredible and we only
24:41
just worked out how
24:42
they do this but um so essentially most
24:45
freshwater snails
24:46
don't have gills they have lungs so they
24:48
need to be in open air to breathe rather
24:50
than in water
24:51
so some of them like the apple snail
24:52
which is a common pet have a little
24:53
snorkel device which they
24:55
shoot up to the surface which gets air
24:57
in but a lot of them have a lung
25:00
which they want to be exposed to at all
25:02
times and so they float on top of the
25:04
water with this lung exposed
25:05
and what they can do is they can turn
25:07
upside down and attach themselves to the
25:09
under surface of the water and they use
25:11
a combination of surface tension and
25:13
then the viscous kind of
25:15
drag from the slime that they um exude
25:18
and that's just the right balance that
25:19
they can just crawl upside down
25:21
along the surface of the under surface
25:23
of the water it's amazing it's really
25:25
cool and do you reckon they come across
25:26
other snails going on the other
25:28
side and they're like it's my reflection
25:32
[Music]
25:33
[Applause]
25:33
[Music]
25:35
just one or two little pokemon go things
25:37
yeah a non-governmental agency in bosnia
25:40
has warned players to be aware of land
25:41
mines while trying to catch pokemon
25:43
right yeah but also generally just
25:44
whenever whatever you're doing be aware
25:46
of landmines
25:46
that's true yeah i think the prop yeah
25:48
you're right all right actually you can
25:50
um genetically modify crests so that
25:52
when it's stressed
25:53
going over landmines it changes color
25:55
and that's one way of finding landmines
25:57
bringing it back to that but no help for
25:59
pokemon yeah no
26:01
uh and finally two men in california
26:03
ignored warning signs and fell off a
26:05
cliff when playing pokemon
26:07
yeah they're okay though aren't they um
26:10
it was an
26:11
article in cnn and it said that this
26:13
happened
26:14
and it said that they'd had injuries but
26:16
it was uncertain how
26:17
bad their injuries were but i think
26:19
maybe it wasn't a massive cliff and
26:20
i hope they're okay oh wow
26:24
[Music]
26:26
[Applause]
26:35
uh but it's about caterpillars do you
26:37
know about this so the um
26:39
in uh the byzantine empire they needed
26:41
silk and it was ruinously expensive but
26:42
the silk was produced in china and the
26:45
uh trade was controlled by the persians
26:47
who choked it off and so
26:48
justinian the first sent two monks to
26:50
china to smuggle out some silkworm eggs
26:53
which they did they had uh bamboo
26:55
walking sticks which are hollow
26:56
you know and they they made full sort of
26:59
things inside and they smuggled
27:00
silkworm eggs in their bamboo starves
27:03
and it took them two years to do it
27:05
and destroyed the uh monopoly
27:08
and the whole of byzantine economy was
27:10
based on the silkworm
27:12
industry in from they brought back in
27:14
their bamboo staff for the next 650
27:16
years
27:17
no way yeah and then the mulberry leaves
27:19
that they eat had to be brought by a
27:20
different path by some other people
27:22
so it was a real major and you see it's
27:24
a proper sort of jason bourne style
27:26
uh thriller isn't it really being those
27:28
two monks and trying to get the bring
27:29
schlep them back through all the
27:30
persians
27:31
yeah sort of yeah it's a version of the
27:34
born identity hasn't been made yet
27:35
[Applause]
27:36
[Music]
27:40
i was reading a good article in a local
27:41
scottish newspaper about a diy
27:44
store in sterling which hedged outside a
27:47
30-foot hedge have been taken over by
27:48
caterpillars and it's
27:49
turned into this enormous web and you
27:51
should look it up it is impressive and
27:52
so they they closed it off
27:54
and they invited people to come and
27:56
visit it as a tourist spot
27:58
and the newspaper said that visitors
27:59
from as far away as
28:01
motherwell have traveled to see the
28:02
unusual height
28:04
which is if you're interested a
28:06
40-minute drive from sterling
28:07
yeah that's a full 40 minutes people
28:10
traveled
28:11
more than 40 minutes you would sort of
28:13
think um
28:16
yeah yeah um the tobacco hawk moth
28:20
caterpillar this is a cool caterpillar
28:22
it has two different walking systems for
28:24
different parts of its body
28:25
so it walks normally with its legs but
28:28
then its gut
28:29
which is obviously on the base of it
28:31
walks a step
28:32
out of sync do that it walks a step
28:35
ahead
28:35
yeah it's i think this is how
28:37
caterpillars move is their organs move
28:39
in front of them
28:39
isn't that amazing so amazing this is in
28:42
2010 they put them on a tiny
28:44
treadmill and i can't find any images of
28:46
the tiny treadmill they made for
28:48
caterpillars so annoying should we
28:49
photograph this or take a video for
28:50
posterity
28:52
who'd want to see that
28:59
[Applause]
28:59
[Music]
29:00
we have the ability to tell the future
29:02
and we don't know why
29:03
in 2012 this meta-analysis was done of
29:06
studies from 1975
29:08
that looked at 26 experiments which show
29:10
people a series of random images so in
29:12
lots of experiments they do that for
29:13
various reasons
29:14
and they'll suddenly put up a scary
29:15
image like a slithering snake with big
29:18
fangs
29:18
and it found that people are able to
29:21
tell
29:22
between 1 and 10 seconds in advance when
29:24
the snake image is going to come up
29:26
totally at random so they're not primed
29:27
in any way to tell that it sounds
29:29
completely insane
29:30
people are going to get very angry i'm
29:31
saying that i know that sounds like the
29:32
kind of i usually say but you too
29:34
i i don't this doesn't sound very
29:37
corrupt it sounds like nonsense doesn't
29:38
it but look they looked at these 26
29:40
experiments and they said at the end
29:42
the cause of this anticipatory activity
29:44
which undoubtedly does lie within the
29:45
realm of natural physical processes
29:47
remains undetermined so they said it's
29:49
not supernatural guys but actually
29:51
come on we're able to predict what scary
29:53
picture's coming up my immediate thought
29:55
is that the
29:56
the experimenter is giving something
29:58
away yeah or that we're all just so
30:00
fundamentally similar that our
30:02
our uh the people who put the order in
30:05
yeah uh you could kind of predict that
30:06
just because you're both humans so you
30:08
kind of you naturally have we naturally
30:10
have an
30:10
unrandomized income the other thing is
30:12
if you can predict it between one and
30:14
ten seconds and they're coming up every
30:15
couple of seconds
30:16
then you could say one's going to come
30:18
and you have five chances of it coming
30:19
yeah that's true i think james is right
30:21
i think it's the guy who's doing the
30:23
experiment doesn't realize he's going to
30:24
be he's going to hate
30:25
this dragon picture ready for your next
30:28
one
30:30
must stop these researchers from talking
30:31
to themselves out loud
30:33
but let's keep an open mind and say
30:35
maybe it is unexplained yeah yeah
30:37
open minds people yeah
30:50
so there's the thing about trump of the
30:51
secret service which is that
30:53
during the election campaign uh they
30:55
paid him 1.6 million dollars
30:58
have you heard this oh yeah so that they
31:00
can fly on his plane oh yeah because
31:02
whenever
31:02
well yeah when you're a candidate for
31:03
one of the two big parties you get a
31:04
security detail
31:05
and they have to accompany you
31:06
everywhere you go and they obviously pay
31:08
for their tickets because they've got
31:09
funding
31:10
however if you're traveling on a plane
31:12
owned by the candidate
31:14
you have to pay him money yeah i
31:17
i have to say though i don't think that
31:19
that is exclusive to trump
31:21
um because the clintons did that as well
31:23
and i think they've taken over two
31:24
million from the secret service
31:26
in terms of things that they've uh yeah
31:29
taxed them for god you don't want to be
31:30
the candidate who doesn't rock up with
31:31
your
31:32
own personal airplane do you you just
31:34
disqualified from applying
31:37
you want to be the candidate who's also
31:38
an uber driver
31:46
[Music]
31:47
[Applause]
31:49
he also had the most amazing looking
31:51
helmet which
31:52
actually
31:56
what's your problem www
32:01
okay yeah i'm not familiar with that
32:03
term but thanks
32:04
he also had a really lovely moist
32:07
rounded helmet
32:16
[Applause]
32:19
[Music]
32:20
they've found some neanderthal bones and
32:22
they've checked about the markings on
32:24
them
32:24
and some of them have evidence of
32:26
cannibalism they've got like
32:28
teeth marks on them and then other ones
32:29
have got like scraping marks where you
32:31
can see they've been made into like
32:33
kind of rudimentary tools so once their
32:35
friends died or their
32:36
you know other neanderthals died they
32:38
would kind of turn them into tools and
32:40
foods
32:43
yeah would you like to be turned into a
32:45
spade well i think my rib cage could be
32:47
a quite a nice tux track

00:14
hello
00:14
and welcome to another episode of no
00:16
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:19
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:20
covent garden
00:21
my name is dan schreiber and i'm sitting
00:23
here with james harkin
00:25
andrew hunter murray and sarah pascoe
00:27
and once again we have gathered around
00:29
the microphones with our four
00:30
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:32
and in no particular order
00:34
here we go starting with you james
00:36
harkin
00:37
okay my fact this week is that the first
00:39
man to use an umbrella
00:41
in london was pelted with rubbish for
00:44
doing so
00:44
hmm oh but fortunately he had an
00:46
umbrella yeah
00:47
was that why he took it out he didn't
00:50
although um
00:51
according to his biographer when one
00:53
person threw
00:54
rubbish at him he used his umbrella to
00:56
give the man a right good
00:57
thrashing oh really yeah wow wow so he
01:01
he turned that's that should be the fact
01:03
the first ever
01:04
outing of an umbrella was used to beat a
01:06
man oh yeah
01:07
that's quite cool yeah no so what um
01:10
so yeah so this is a guy called jonas
01:12
hamway uh
01:14
and he had been to france he was a bit
01:15
of a traveler and he came back from
01:17
france and in france they'd all been
01:18
using umbrellas for quite a long time
01:20
but in
01:20
england they were seen as kind of um
01:22
either a femina
01:23
or a weakness of character that you
01:25
would have it or just french which was a
01:27
bad thing at the time so when you say
01:28
it's the first person seen in public
01:30
with an umbrella it just means the first
01:31
man yeah like the women had them every
01:33
day they were beaten you're right
01:34
did i not say that you did say you did
01:36
say men did i say man yeah
01:38
also women women were used so he was the
01:40
first yeah so women were using them
01:42
um and men were using them all over
01:44
europe going on well i think also
01:45
priests were using them because
01:47
there's basically women
01:50
in their girly clothes always
01:54
singing
01:57
smelling perfume everywhere
01:59
[Laughter]
02:03
yeah but basically they i think they had
02:06
them at funerals but they had these huge
02:07
heavy things at funerals which would
02:09
maybe they'd have an assistant because
02:11
it would they'd be outside and it'd be
02:13
raining
02:13
so they wanted to keep dry like that but
02:15
yeah no proper lads
02:16
uh as sarah rightly points out i did not
02:19
have them i think yeah you're right and
02:20
so
02:21
what happened was if it was raining in
02:23
london um this was
02:24
in the 1750s you would probably hire
02:27
down
02:28
a handsome cab or a someone carrying a
02:30
sedan chair or something like that and
02:32
that would help you get out of the rain
02:34
and so it was the people who were
02:35
driving these cabs who didn't like the
02:37
guy
02:38
and so they started throwing things on
02:39
because they thought that he might put
02:41
them out of business yes i knew it was
02:42
the hackney
02:44
kind of carriage men that had pelted him
02:45
with rubbish but i just thought it's
02:47
because he wasn't very popular
02:48
nope so but it was because actually it
02:50
was their competition so also did you
02:52
know that he was anti-tipping
02:53
this jose was he yeah do you know what
02:56
do you mean by tipping like what tipping
02:57
people so
02:58
yeah another reason why the hackney cab
02:59
drivers might have like you shut your
03:01
mouth
03:03
and he was anti-tea drinking okay why
03:06
was he auntie tea drinking i don't know
03:07
it's just wikipedia says he was right
03:10
no i oh i do know oh you do know so
03:12
there's he wrote this whole essay about
03:14
tea uh because he thought it'd be he
03:16
again thought it was french and that was
03:18
a bad thing at the time
03:19
and he said men seem to have lost their
03:21
stature and comeliness and women their
03:23
beauty
03:24
your very chambermaids have lost their
03:25
bloom i suppose by sipping tea
03:28
so i just thought it was bad for people
03:29
yeah okay yeah
03:31
well it's a good job that me sarah and
03:33
dan are all drinking wine and you're
03:34
drinking tea tonight
03:36
like an ugly chamber maid
03:38
[Laughter]
03:41
it's weird is it because actually
03:42
umbrellas anti both chinese
03:45
originally yeah so actually it feels
03:47
like he kept saying french but it was a
03:48
different kind of racist
03:50
it was less acceptable but also now very
03:52
english right yes
03:54
carrying an umbrella like a businessman
03:56
like yeah
03:57
apparently most umbrellas are still made
03:59
in china are they yeah but actually they
04:01
found that the terracotta army oh really
04:03
that's one of the chariots that has a
04:04
giant umbrella that's attached
04:06
that must have been an amazing discovery
04:08
when they saw that because
04:09
you would think you don't invent the
04:11
umbrella before the house
04:13
like you think in terms of people they
04:15
were like they'd get like a rough kind
04:16
of covering and hang on we could add
04:18
walls to this
04:19
it would be that way round so you think
04:21
that the house is just a very advanced
04:23
umbrella it is it really is able to look
04:25
oh my gosh look what they've done
04:27
they've got toilets in their umbrellas
04:29
[Laughter]
04:30
uh this was the 1700s that this happened
04:34
in but do you know the first time
04:36
that an umbrella was mentioned in the uk
04:39
was in the 1600s
04:40
okay and it was in a book by thomas
04:42
corriet he was a he was a court jester
04:44
for the son
04:45
of king james the first and he wrote
04:48
this amazing book which came out
04:49
in the same year as the king james bible
04:51
uh which was called
04:53
coriat's crudities hastily gobbled up in
04:56
five months
04:56
travel and he went from london to venice
04:59
in the same pair of shoes
05:00
um and he came back and it sounds like
05:02
someone who needs an edinburgh show
05:04
doesn't it sound like a third year
05:06
scraping the barrel
05:08
i'm gonna walk to venice and i'm not
05:10
gonna change my shoes
05:12
yeah so he came back and he put he put
05:14
his uh supposedly put his shoes
05:16
into a church hung them up he was like
05:18
this is the one pair i wore and he was
05:20
quite famous in his day
05:21
so in his book he mentions umbrellas for
05:23
the first time because as he was passing
05:24
through europe he saw them
05:26
he also mentions the fact that everyone
05:28
was eating using this forked device
05:30
and that supposedly as well is how we
05:33
started using forts that's interesting
05:34
because actually i think the first
05:36
people choose forks were kind of
05:37
ridiculed weren't they yes again
05:39
effeminate i think
05:40
were they yeah there was one famous guy
05:43
i can't remember who it was who used a
05:44
fog
05:45
and was known as fork user and that was
05:47
supposed to be an insult
05:49
they were like user is that because it
05:51
sounded exactly like
05:52
yeah thank you is that sound is that
05:54
where we got it from maybe
05:56
do you know what early umbrellas were
05:57
nicknamed in england no they were called
05:59
robinsons
06:01
because in the book robinson crusoe he
06:04
makes himself an umbrella
06:05
before he makes the house yeah
06:08
it's all coming together everything
06:10
makes sense
06:11
do you know who had the first umbrella
06:13
covered with kevlar
06:15
to make it uh bulletproof no no nicholas
06:18
sarkozy
06:20
isn't he yeah he was like i'm gonna be
06:21
dry and safe any of those uh
06:23
sky assassins
06:25
[Laughter]
06:28
wow did he carry the umbrella or was
06:29
that a body guard he he held it himself
06:32
it must have been very heavy but
06:33
apparently other people have them now
06:35
yeah
06:35
is it heavy kevlar uh i'm actually i
06:38
assume so but maybe not i mean i'm sure
06:40
he had
06:40
you know special light as stuff as light
06:42
as possible you'll be making houses out
06:44
of kevlar
06:46
um i found some famous umbrellas that i
06:48
thought
06:49
is there a wikipedia list of famous
06:51
umbrellas and there also should be an
06:53
umbrella museum where they keep them
06:54
because i would definitely go
06:55
there's not i haven't found an umbrella
06:57
museum i have found an umbrella cover
06:59
museum
07:00
huh what do you mean the thing that
07:02
slips over it the little you know when
07:03
you buy a short umbrella and it's got
07:05
that little sort of
07:06
slip of material little pouch that you
07:07
lose within about 20 seconds there's a
07:09
museum in maine
07:10
devoted to those you're kidding no the
07:13
website says
07:14
people flocked by the tens to see the
07:16
museum
07:17
people were thrilled to donate their old
07:19
umbrella sheets and the international
07:20
press
07:21
went bonkers so um so the umbrellas that
07:24
i
07:25
would put into the museum if i had a
07:26
couple of uh entries
07:28
would be the first one is mary
07:29
kingsley's umbrella oh yeah very
07:31
important umbrella and i'm surprised
07:33
that it's not in the rgs i'm surprised
07:34
that i couldn't find if anyone's
07:36
actually got it
07:37
because it was the umbrella that she
07:38
used to ward off the animals famously
07:40
she uh
07:40
smacked a hippopotamus away while she
07:42
was in her canoe so she was an explorer
07:44
in africa wasn't
07:45
yeah she was and she went out at a time
07:47
when she was still
07:48
she didn't even wear trousers she still
07:50
wore a full
07:52
victorian garb the dress like it was
07:54
insane and she
07:55
sounds like such a she was amazing
07:58
whacking hippos
08:00
they're in my way like you went to
08:02
africa
08:06
who's in the wrong it's out here that's
08:08
true i'm being unfair on her she
08:10
she tickled the behind the veneer of a
08:12
hippopotamus in order to get it away
08:14
it's nice when you say it yeah
08:15
and i think she like kicked a crocodile
08:17
in the face or something i'm not sure
08:19
yeah but um yeah and she uh so that's
08:21
one umbrella because she
08:22
she was an incredible explorer and the
08:25
second one is the umbrella that was
08:27
thought to have assassinated jfk
08:30
do you know about this story oh no it's
08:31
that thing you've heard about umbrella
08:32
man
08:33
umbrella man so umbrella man i hadn't
08:35
heard of this um so in the famous
08:37
footage of the
08:38
um of the jfk assassination um there's
08:41
famously this shot when people are
08:42
analyzing it and not knowing where the
08:44
shot might have come from out of nowhere
08:46
as the car is passing a bunch of people
08:47
on the side there's just this one guy
08:49
standing there holding an umbrella oh
08:51
and it's a sunny day there's no reason
08:54
yeah and they thought how is this a
08:55
parasol it could have been a parasol
08:57
that's true it was an umbrella though it
08:58
was a dark umbrella
09:00
it turned out that it was a guy who was
09:01
actually protesting kennedy's father
09:04
because kennedy's father was a
09:05
sympathizer with neville chamberlain who
09:08
was quite nice to the nazis uh during
09:10
his time and he was just
09:11
protesting that it was a very it doesn't
09:13
make any sense like if his father was a
09:15
rain cloud
09:16
great protest because apparently a
09:19
trademark
09:20
accessory of chamberlain's was to carry
09:21
an umbrella okay that's still there's
09:23
still like six
09:24
removes so you have to explain to
09:25
everyone what your protest means
09:27
it's like going to a fancy dress party
09:28
where you look nothing like what you're
09:30
supposed to do yeah you have to explain
09:31
to everyone
09:32
being an impressionist who goes oh hello
09:35
was winston churchill
09:38
that was uncanny well except that while
09:41
uh kennedy was at harvard he wrote a
09:43
thesis
09:43
and it kind of that was very much a part
09:45
of that so he thought kennedy would get
09:47
the little nod
09:49
and so everyone was going who's the
09:50
umbrella man he turned himself in he
09:51
brought the umbrella in and basically he
09:53
explained
09:54
this convoluted reason why he was
09:55
protesting and this is the quote from me
09:57
said i think if the guinness book of
09:58
world records had a category for people
10:00
who are at the wrong place at the wrong
10:01
time doing the wrong thing
10:03
i would be number one in that position
10:04
wow he was there two seconds
10:06
or so before kennedy so there is a
10:09
website which
10:09
claims that in 1797 there was only one
10:12
umbrella in cambridge
10:13
and that you could hire it out right
10:15
okay for an hour at a time
10:17
so 1797. i think as soon as it starts
10:19
raining there's going to be a rush as
10:20
well
10:22
but i don't know what there was only one
10:23
there but it's true that in paris
10:25
uh it was common practice as in you
10:27
could hire them out uh by the hour and
10:29
they had that they were all clearly
10:30
recognizable they had a number
10:32
painted on so they couldn't be next yeah
10:33
uh so it's like the boris bike oh yeah
10:35
like the bike system
10:36
yeah except obviously they could be next
10:38
i don't know how you would
10:40
legislate against that france because
10:42
they had the bike system before us then
10:43
they weren't getting stolen there
10:45
it's really interesting culturally that
10:47
in paris they left them all in amsterdam
10:48
they all got stolen instantly
10:50
i don't know what we did really what are
10:52
we doing in london i think they're too
10:53
heavy and aren't they yeah
10:55
yeah i think if you're kind of riding
10:57
that around someone's to know that it's
10:59
not your
11:00
actual bike you reckon yeah people are
11:02
like detectives like that sometimes
11:06
just uh we were talking about ancient
11:08
china before in the umbrella um
11:09
something i thought i'd show you guys
11:11
which obviously doesn't translate too
11:12
well but people can google this
11:14
the chinese character for umbrella sun
11:16
it was designed
11:17
uh to look just like an umbrella so part
11:20
of the
11:20
it looks like a house it does doesn't it
11:23
yes yeah
11:24
yeah that's it there yeah it's beautiful
11:26
just a nice little bit of
11:28
how chinese words often work is that you
11:30
actually designed it
11:31
initially to look like they look like
11:32
that yeah yeah yeah so if i was to read
11:34
chinese might i get a clue of what the
11:36
words are by looking at what they look
11:38
like well
11:38
in in its origin so when i when i was
11:40
taught mandarin as a kid you would start
11:42
with the super simplified pictorial
11:44
versions of it and it would show you
11:45
that the
11:46
total image would look exactly like a
11:48
turtle and it slowly became hardened and
11:50
edged and so on
11:51
the numbers one two three they're just
11:53
just lines
11:54
yeah for one and then add a two and a
11:56
three yeah mm-hmm
11:57
yeah hmm chinese i kind of believe you
11:59
but then also i think maybe you went to
12:01
special classes
12:03
don't make mandarin easy for dad i get
12:06
the turtle drawing we know what you mean
12:11
just draw an umbrella we'll just accept
12:13
it that's what it is
12:14
[Laughter]
12:16
um some stuff about throwing rubbish at
12:18
things sure
12:19
okay um so when blackfriar's bridge was
12:23
opened uh so it was a replacement bridge
12:25
and queen victoria opened it and uh
12:28
there's a
12:28
statue of her at the end and she'd been
12:30
in mourning for ages
12:31
like for albert so the crowd really
12:34
hated her by then so they pelted her
12:36
with vegetables
12:36
apparently really yeah why did they hate
12:39
her because she hadn't been to see them
12:40
for
12:41
such a long time like decades right so
12:43
they threw vegetables
12:44
did anyone get into trouble for that
12:46
presumably they did maybe they all said
12:48
it was the wrong place at the wrong time
12:54
we're just protesting lord liverpool
12:57
don't you remember he used to like
12:58
cabbage
12:59
we don't want to go to the crimean war
13:01
[Laughter]
13:03
umbrella inventions is one of the main
13:05
inventions that people try like i think
13:07
mouse traps is one of them and umbrellas
13:09
is the other one
13:11
invented a mouse trap did you it was for
13:12
pickpockets
13:14
so you put a mousetrap in your pocket
13:17
and then when someone tries to get into
13:18
your pocket it traps their fingers and
13:20
then you have to take them
13:21
two miles away and release them
13:26
that's good but it makes your pockets
13:28
unusable doesn't it yes you mustn't
13:29
forget and put your hands in your pocket
13:32
there was a um there's a museum in the
13:34
uk and i wish i could remember which one
13:35
it is but
13:36
um they have one of the oldest examples
13:38
of a mouse trap inside
13:39
a glass box and the curator came back
13:42
one morning and found a mouse trapped in
13:44
it because it managed to get inside the
13:46
box
13:48
and so yeah an ancient mousetrap that
13:51
was never meant to be used yeah caught a
13:52
modern day maps like time travel
13:54
i once went to a museum in bhutan
13:57
and it was run by monks and they had a
13:59
mouse problem that they discovered on
14:01
that day when i was there
14:02
and they're uh buddhist monks so they
14:04
didn't want to kill the mouse or even
14:05
hurt in any way so they were just
14:07
running after it chasing after
14:08
all these monks running in and out of
14:10
rooms like an old fast i love how they
14:12
think that that's not stressful for mice
14:14
i
14:16
[Laughter]
14:20
a lot of them have um so you know about
14:22
toxoplasma have you talked about it
14:23
before
14:24
yes yeah so so loads of mice have it and
14:26
it means they're not scared of cats and
14:28
they're not scared of humans
14:29
when they have it so is it humans as
14:30
well yeah with humans as well um but so
14:32
the theory is the people who
14:33
really like worship cats is because so
14:36
lots of people are carrying it's only
14:37
really dangerous for babies to get it
14:39
but most lots of human beings have it
14:41
and they the theory is that that's why
14:43
there's humans who just
14:44
love cats not just like oh hey i've got
14:46
a cat but like
14:47
this cat is my secret wife
14:51
my wife's like that my real wife
15:01
she always comes home at night i have to
15:04
go into the neighbor's house
15:14
okay it is time for fact number two and
15:17
that
15:17
is sarah okay so my fact is about men
15:20
and it's about how
15:21
uh the male brain changes when his
15:24
partner is pregnant
15:26
okay how does it change well this is all
15:28
very early research and a lot of the
15:30
studies i've looked into have a very
15:31
small
15:32
amount of subjects but it seems like
15:34
things happen from
15:35
literally four to six weeks of finding
15:37
out his partner is pregnant no matter
15:38
when that is that testosterone
15:40
starts to drop and he starts to produce
15:42
prolactin which is a hormone that
15:45
creates milk production in female
15:47
mammals but in male mammals makes them
15:49
less aggressive
15:50
so it's what's really really interesting
15:52
is it seems like um cortisol changes as
15:53
well cortisol
15:55
is a stress hormone but in men and women
15:57
it also causes you to
15:58
put on weight because you're storing
16:00
energy so for a long time there's been a
16:02
theory about and they've kind of called
16:03
it sympathetic male pregnancies or i
16:05
think it's called
16:06
couvard syndrome which is when the men
16:08
start to get nauseous and get morning
16:10
sickness and they get they put on weight
16:11
as well it's now a theory that actually
16:13
in terms of resources
16:14
the man putting on weight is quite
16:15
sensible in terms of storing energy
16:16
because he's gonna have to do a lot more
16:18
and give a lot more resources once as a
16:19
baby so it's really fascinating
16:22
wait what does what does the male give
16:24
in terms of that
16:25
that more body on it if you think about
16:28
it like if you have
16:29
more body fat then you don't have to eat
16:31
as much you work harder and also
16:33
give your food away yeah exactly so if
16:35
you think about times of sort of fast
16:36
and famine
16:37
any kind of stored energy is the
16:39
difference between living and dying
16:41
yeah the causes are things interesting
16:42
so another thing i found out when i was
16:43
looking into this
16:44
is that the more stressed the mother is
16:46
the more cortisol she produces and
16:47
obviously having a new baby is very very
16:49
stressful
16:50
the faster the baby grows through her
16:52
breast milk so cortisol
16:54
it does make you decision as a child
16:57
it's better to make your mother more
16:58
stressed
17:00
yes that's exactly what it means thank
17:02
you for interpreting it
17:03
and they've done rat studies and i hate
17:04
animal studies and i don't think they're
17:06
applicable
17:06
but they did they do obviously awful
17:08
things to animals but with rats if they
17:09
really really stressed the mother out
17:12
then her children would come out much
17:14
much tougher
17:15
with higher levels of cortisol and
17:16
testosterone and things like already
17:18
as if they're prepared for a horrible
17:20
world it's the kind of thing which is
17:21
really interesting that whatever you do
17:22
to the mother especially through breast
17:24
milk
17:24
she's telling she's programming her
17:26
children you need to be ready for this
17:28
do you have to be aware that your wife
17:30
is pregnant or does your body
17:32
well this thing i have so many questions
17:33
about it number one this is such a
17:34
heteronormative study
17:36
yes blocks the first one adoptive
17:37
parents people who go through ivf
17:39
what about gay parents does this all
17:40
this is insane you have all these
17:42
questions and then it's like we studied
17:44
29 heterosexual couples okay
17:46
and did some salivary hormone tests also
17:48
i have to say so there'll be one test
17:50
that will find
17:51
oh my god men have this amount of
17:52
testosterone then when their partners
17:54
are pregnant and then it'll be
17:54
replicated and they don't find it but
17:56
they'll find something else
17:57
okay so it seems like and also with the
17:59
brain because of neuroplasticity
18:01
it's so different from lots of people
18:02
anyway that there's never a and
18:04
absolutely 100
18:05
all people do this i was kind of
18:06
thinking if you had a one night stand
18:08
with someone you're looking at your body
18:10
going you put a bit away
18:15
[Laughter]
18:21
because you've got more in sickness yes
18:24
so morning sickness
18:25
in these studies they were saying that
18:26
men get morning sickness as well yeah
18:28
they can do it yeah and so there's
18:29
and and the sympathy cramps and
18:31
everything yeah which is really
18:32
interesting
18:34
we didn't notice it for ages because
18:36
most of the experiments done were on
18:37
as you say rats and rat fathers as it
18:40
were uh
18:41
don't look after their offspring yeah so
18:43
it's when they started experimenting on
18:45
marmosets
18:46
where the males do look after their
18:48
offspring that they they notice these
18:49
hormonal changes in mama separate yes
18:51
yeah so it's one of those things where
18:54
there are some things that are kind of
18:55
hardwired because physically we can do
18:57
them but it's very very unpopular to say
18:59
because it looks like you're reinforcing
19:00
all these things we're trying to get
19:01
away from which is like gender binary
19:03
and things like being biologically
19:05
different between men
19:06
and women which actually it's a really
19:08
really complex right area
19:10
and it's not popular they don't want to
19:11
study it people don't want to do it
19:13
so is that considered controversial kind
19:16
of really so if you
19:17
were to stand up for a feminist meeting
19:19
yeah that would be like guys it's not
19:21
your fault
19:21
like you evolved to make babies and
19:23
until very recently that's what happened
19:25
if you had sex
19:26
see you later enjoy yourself right yeah
19:29
okay
19:29
and it's the same change my speech same
19:31
with the studies of the brain
19:33
they try and say like really
19:34
complementary things about both genders
19:36
rather than negative so rather than
19:37
going like oh women
19:38
maybe are less spatially aware and it's
19:41
not ever true
19:42
in terms of it's just like oh they'll do
19:43
a study and it seems like oh men are
19:45
using their brain this way
19:46
or this way and then you look at people
19:47
who are brought up differently and it's
19:48
not it's not true
19:50
the brain is so elastic in terms of how
19:51
it's used people who do loads of maths
19:53
are better at maths and that's kind of
19:56
uh seems to be the thing because it's
19:57
really difficult not to be reductive in
19:58
telling people and it's the same with
19:59
men like
20:00
obviously 90 percent of criminals are
20:02
male and i'm saying crimes and there's a
20:04
theory that's because the amygdala is
20:05
much bigger and the prefrontal cortex
20:07
develops much later
20:08
so you have this emotional instinctual
20:09
brain that isn't very good at
20:10
controlling itself
20:11
and that's very sexist to say to men
20:13
like you're just crazy
20:15
you're just much closer to monkeys right
20:18
i read a really good um article um it
20:21
was a study from 2015 at tel aviv
20:23
university and they were saying okay
20:26
well if you look at men's brains and
20:27
women's brains
20:28
uh if you look at them generally you can
20:30
say okay generally a men's brain will be
20:32
a bit like this and generally a woman's
20:34
brain will be a bit like this
20:35
but actually 98 of people they studied
20:38
didn't fit a clear-cut profile
20:40
so you can kind of say generally
20:42
speaking it's like this but if you take
20:43
an individual division
20:44
it's really fascinating so this
20:46
obviously men's brains are about ten
20:47
percent bigger which is
20:48
correlates to body size really but um
20:51
what's really fascinating is that
20:52
there's a lot of um
20:54
so dyslexia adhd things like that are
20:57
all much much more prevalent than
20:58
in men than women and they don't know
21:00
why and sort of the genetic basis for
21:01
that but there's certain kind of brain
21:02
disorders which are just you're much
21:03
more likely
21:04
an autism as well it's more male and
21:07
yeah and the testosterone and the crime
21:08
thing but i didn't realize as well
21:09
testosterone doesn't actually get into
21:10
the brain
21:11
there's a there's a kind of uh there's
21:13
something in the brain stem that turns
21:15
it into a different hormone because
21:16
of how it would actually change the
21:18
structure yeah
21:20
there was a just on the on the men and
21:22
pregnancy thing physiological changes to
21:24
the man in pregnancy they did do a load
21:26
of
21:26
surveys of men about the symptoms that
21:29
they'd experienced physically when
21:30
their partners were pregnant i bet their
21:32
wives were like what for me flynn
21:34
how this affected you darling well a lot
21:37
of them complained of stomach cramps
21:39
basically but there were a few
21:41
there were a few kind of illustrative uh
21:43
lines um
21:45
uh one man uh said uh my stomach pains
21:48
were very much like a build up of a
21:49
woman's contraction as she's giving
21:51
birth
21:51
uh they started mild and then got
21:53
stronger and stronger and stronger
21:54
another man claimed
21:55
i think i was in more pain than she was
21:57
right well the christmas
21:59
is interesting the cramps thing's
22:00
interesting because oxytocin which is a
22:02
hormone that does make you bond which
22:03
does raise for men especially in the
22:04
last trimester of pregnancy and
22:06
obviously it's what a woman releases
22:07
when she breastfeeds it also causes
22:09
muscle contractions so it's what causes
22:11
an orgasm in everyone
22:13
and so actually if you had raised
22:15
oxytocin that would absolutely make
22:16
sense about cramping
22:17
wow yeah okay so my reading out that
22:20
line for a cheap laugh at this man
22:22
saying i think i was in more pain than
22:23
she was
22:24
yeah may have had point behind us also
22:26
do you know what i think people say
22:27
stuff like that with a wink
22:28
that we don't hear yeah that's very true
22:31
with the internet
22:32
very true i think so many things that
22:34
people say are joking
22:36
and then we write it down and go what a
22:37
bastard i'm going to send him a turd in
22:40
the post
22:43
and i think it's today they were talking
22:44
about so women's gray matter actually
22:46
decreases in certain parts of her brain
22:49
and that's so she can become obsessed
22:50
with a baby whoa
22:52
really she has to be obsessed with it or
22:54
it will die yeah like and it's caused by
22:56
hormones but
22:57
uh you have to have a baby and then just
22:59
want to stare at it constantly otherwise
23:00
someone else is going to eat it
23:02
yeah i mean someone else like a wolf or
23:03
something like roger from next door
23:07
but i think when they first found that
23:09
out they saw that the emotion part of
23:10
your brain shrunk a little bit and
23:12
everyone thought that doesn't make any
23:13
sense at all
23:14
and then they realized actually you're
23:15
just decluttering like getting rid of
23:17
all that not important yeah it's like
23:19
pruning they call it
23:20
and this is the thing with the brain
23:21
they say they think that oh that's the
23:22
emotional part of your brain or that's
23:24
the drive
23:24
and it's always so much more complicated
23:26
than that like so the amygdala which is
23:28
like this emotional center really really
23:30
ancient brain
23:31
also is connected in terms of what you
23:32
remember in terms of trauma and
23:34
really like
23:48
and my all of us included were lay
23:50
people how else are you supposed to
23:52
understand this really complicated
23:53
science unless someone goes
23:55
that's the really old bit like you as a
23:57
fish
23:58
this spirit that's monkey bit remember
24:00
when you're a monkey
24:01
so it's interesting though that the
24:02
brain can't understand itself
24:05
yeah that is interesting yeah you have
24:07
what's that theory of yours that um
24:09
well i think it's the only thing that's
24:10
ever named itself yes that's so cool
24:13
i try to write stand up about how you
24:14
know when you go like oh my god the
24:16
brain is amazing how aaron
24:17
arrogant is that it's your brain telling
24:19
you yeah yeah you're like shut up bray
24:22
it's the most complex thing we know of
24:24
in the galaxy nothing will ever
24:25
understand the brain
24:26
excuse me just bragging about yourself
24:31
you know what you're saying about the
24:32
gray matter shrinking yeah so if you
24:34
were to do a list
24:35
of every animal species on earth in
24:37
terms of
24:38
how let's say loved a newborn is where
24:42
would we appear on that which is very
24:43
very high but
24:44
the sad thing if anyone watches
24:45
blackfish the documentary which is
24:47
is that like a black mirror for fish
24:51
people don't even talk about how clever
24:52
fish are they charlie brooker nicked
24:54
their idea
24:55
[Laughter]
24:56
so blackfish is and it's really
24:58
interesting so orcas orcas
25:00
also have menopause like us grandparents
25:02
uh never stop caring for their young
25:04
young never leave their parents the part
25:05
of their brain which again very crudely
25:08
would say
25:08
is to do with familial love is like two
25:10
and a half times bigger than ours
25:12
and when their children are taken away
25:13
from them in the wild to go to aquariums
25:15
they cry for the rest of their lives
25:17
whoa
25:17
yeah does that mean queen victoria was
25:19
an orca what
25:20
oh because she was she was sad for the
25:22
rest of her life guys i think i've blown
25:23
this thing wide
25:24
without a big dress on which might have
25:27
been hiding exactly
25:28
a massive tail she was a human head on
25:31
an orca
25:33
that's why they threw things at her
25:35
because she was a weird awkward walker
25:38
oh my god this is the yeah they saw him
25:40
merge from the thames
25:41
to open blackfyre's bridge again this is
25:44
splash the sequel
25:46
i was yeah cause i read the um giraffes
25:48
when they're born this is this is quite
25:50
separate but just thinking how like how
25:52
the human body just is very much
25:55
everyone's around
25:56
takes the the baby out cuts the cord
25:57
it's so it needs us to be there
25:59
basically
26:00
um which giraffes they're born with
26:01
slippers right oh yeah yeah they're born
26:04
with slippers and their horns are
26:05
bendy what do you mean slippers they
26:07
have this odd thing around their hooves
26:09
right are they cool
26:10
yeah and they and they shed after about
26:13
like three months after they're born
26:14
some or maybe three days
26:15
three days or three months every other
26:17
species other than us gives birth to
26:19
young that are ready to live and we
26:21
don't so we give birth and then the baby
26:23
continues growing and that's thing to
26:24
always remember in terms of the brain
26:25
and us as a species
26:27
our whole society all of our personal
26:29
interactions are because we
26:30
can't just have a baby and look after it
26:34
on our own
26:34
because the brain is so big yeah yeah
26:37
massive yeah oh that means stop
26:38
it with your brain every time we talk
26:42
about the brain on this show i get blown
26:44
away by
26:45
the oddness of what we are constantly
26:46
learning about it yes it just completely
26:48
flips yeah it's just such
26:50
big knowledge every time we learn
26:51
something new so this is this is not new
26:53
but this blew my mind today when i read
26:54
it blew my brain today so my brain is
26:56
being blown by its own
26:57
abilities yeah um yeah i bet literally
27:00
in outside of skull when you learn brain
27:01
facts your brain is like walking up and
27:02
down right
27:03
doing the moon walk like i know it
27:06
so it's if you sleep in a new place
27:09
let's say a new house a new hotel
27:11
anywhere you've gone to that's not your
27:12
regular place
27:13
half your brain stays in a kind of alert
27:15
position
27:16
so that it can just wake up for news yes
27:20
like a dolphin queen victoria
27:23
so neuroplasticity which is the really
27:25
exciting thing the books have been
27:26
written about it are so amazing in terms
27:28
of
27:28
the brain the way it prunes itself that
27:30
thing about um if you go to new places
27:32
all the time people who travel and get
27:33
new stimuli
27:34
they build more neurons all of the time
27:35
because they have to and that benefits
27:37
all of the brain but
27:38
so there's things that so fascinating
27:39
and dick schwab's book
27:41
um he talks about how so your brain if
27:43
it doesn't use certain parts it prunes
27:45
them as a child so it's so incredible
27:47
but people who grew up in the east who
27:48
don't have certain
27:49
sounds like the r sound their brain
27:51
prunes them and then when they learn
27:53
english later on
27:54
they can't pronounce words properly
27:55
because their brain physically has got
27:57
rid of that part
27:57
same with those languages as well yeah
28:00
your baby can do
28:01
um has the ability in theory to be
28:04
able to do every single sound that's
28:05
known to man but then you just lose it
28:07
yeah just certainly which is the brain
28:09
going and it's not because
28:10
it's not a detriment it's going i'm
28:11
going to use this for stuff i do need
28:13
yeah right should we move on to the next
28:16
fact
28:17
you see that guy's name is dick schwab i
28:19
know yeah he's i mean he wrote
28:21
and he's one of the best audiences
28:25
was so much but he's huge because
28:28
there's like three amazing brain books
28:29
at the moment and his is one of them
28:31
yeah and that's his name but the thing
28:32
is once you've said it three times you
28:34
get used to saying
28:34
you do and when you i think if i was
28:36
friends with dick swacks i would never
28:38
get used to that
28:38
you'd think that when his like he handed
28:41
the book in he said to the editor or the
28:42
publisher
28:43
any changes they went actually yeah
28:48
oh our swab is even worse
29:00
okay it is time for fact number three
29:03
and that is
29:04
andy my fact is that a fifth of all the
29:06
species of coral on the planet have been
29:08
named by the same
29:10
man yeah hey what's his name his name is
29:14
john veron i hope i'm pronouncing that
29:16
right uh his nickname is charlie
29:18
which doesn't sound like a nickname but
29:19
actually it was in school he was uh as
29:21
a teacher said hey charles darwin
29:22
stopped doing that because he was doing
29:23
some
29:24
cool experiment with animals
29:28
collecting finches again um so he's he's
29:31
a marine biologist and
29:32
he's been nicknamed the godfather of
29:34
coral
29:35
uh he's 71 years old now but he has done
29:38
so much in the world of
29:40
looking at coral exploring it studying
29:41
it categorizing it
29:43
so in 1972 he was made the first
29:45
full-time researcher on the great
29:46
barrier reef
29:47
and he spent more hours diving down
29:49
there than anybody else in the world
29:51
he studied more of it than any other
29:52
human alive and
29:54
he's just he was interviewed in the ft
29:56
last weekend
29:57
and he's an extraordinary guy so i
29:59
thought he is
30:00
when he comes over to the uk david
30:03
attenborough will introduce him onto
30:04
stage and introduce him by saying that
30:06
this is one of the most important
30:07
scientists
30:08
in our time he's a huge huge deal really
30:11
exciting character has he done a ted
30:12
talk
30:12
so he's not that big a deal actually i
30:14
don't think about it
30:16
um no have you done one no oh okay no i
30:19
wasn't like about to touch
30:27
[Laughter]
30:33
just because of quotas they had to have
30:35
a deep-sea diver
30:37
sarah pascoe i'm dick swan
30:42
um yeah so uh go on andy so
30:46
generally where you get kind of soft
30:47
corals and hard corals but hard corals
30:49
are the ones which live in colonies with
30:51
lots of little individual animals and
30:53
they excrete the skeleton
30:55
of calcium carbonate which becomes the
30:57
reef and grows so that's what the yeah
30:59
that's not the animal that's the kind of
31:00
shell isn't it
31:01
exactly yeah and and they have tentacles
31:04
around their mouth and they can catch
31:05
things they can catch little bits of
31:06
prey even some small fish they can catch
31:09
and eat them and they're very very cool
31:11
do you know that they kiss
31:12
no i didn't know that coral kiss oh
31:15
james
31:18
[Laughter]
31:25
yeah they got this new little um camera
31:27
it's a new kind of camera it's called
31:29
the benthic underwater microscope or bum
31:33
yeah unfortunately um but it lets you
31:35
see what's happening that very very um
31:37
close up and they found that these um
31:40
polyps which is what makes the coral
31:42
they get the food and then they pass on
31:44
nutrients to each other
31:46
by kind of kissing each other wow isn't
31:48
that amazing it's amazing
31:49
is there benefit to an individual from
31:51
passing on nutrients to another nearby
31:53
well i think generally speaking that's
31:55
true in a lot of animals when you all
31:57
benefit from the
31:58
kind of the ecosystem don't you think
32:01
about cultures and they now understand
32:02
that you all kind of
32:03
survive together that's great they're
32:06
all made at the full moon as well
32:09
yeah once a year it might be the light
32:12
or it might be them
32:13
sensing something else it might be the
32:14
tide i don't know but um
32:16
yeah they they yeah because they have
32:18
higher tides yeah yeah they do this
32:20
thing called broadcast spawning uh where
32:22
they all release this blizzard
32:23
of uh you know bundles into the ocean
32:25
they're really brightly colored who knew
32:26
it was so sexy
32:29
it's moonlight yeah it's sexy down on
32:31
the reef it is
32:32
[Laughter]
32:35
yeah wow is it i get really confused by
32:37
coral i don't understand
32:39
what it is exactly in terms of there's
32:42
no brain
32:43
but there is some kind of system that
32:45
means i know how to reproduce
32:47
um what what kind of intelligence level
32:50
are they
32:50
is it nothing and it's just a kind of
32:52
system i think it's like if you think of
32:53
everything as a tube
32:55
we are a tube from stomach to anus and
32:58
you have a nervous system
32:59
yeah so they just have a more simplistic
33:00
version of what we've got okay
33:02
um well corals are not tubes in fact
33:04
because they don't have an anus
33:07
well the their mouth functions as a
33:09
natives and they have to excrete via the
33:10
mouth because
33:11
they're they're attached to the reef and
33:13
they're facing outwards into the world
33:14
so that they're like a wind sock
33:18
but in the windsock of the sea we're
33:21
getting less sexy as we go along
33:23
i think the phrase like a wind sock is
33:25
quite sexy
33:27
no andy's chat up live
33:32
was it what was it livingston chatted
33:34
something up with
33:35
you so dear like a broom handle in the
33:37
morning that was his
33:39
channel how nice i'm like a broom handle
33:43
in the cupboards
33:51
yeah but no you're right then because
33:52
they they are confusing as in they were
33:54
thought to be plants
33:55
corals until the 18th century because
33:57
you would think so from looking at them
33:58
yeah
33:59
um but they're hugely important and also
34:02
they are
34:03
uh they're dying out so the great
34:04
barrier reef has been
34:06
they call it bleaching where yeah um
34:09
they rely on little algae living inside
34:11
uh the coral which photosynthesize
34:13
sunlight and provide the coral with
34:14
loads of its energy
34:15
when the temperature changes those algae
34:17
produce too much oxygen
34:19
that stresses the coral out and damages
34:21
it so they expel
34:22
the algae and then that's the coral
34:25
bleached because those are
34:26
very brightly coloured so actually if
34:28
you look at coral it's very brightly
34:29
coloured but actually it's the algae
34:31
which is colourful
34:31
and coral is just white so a white coral
34:34
is like a dead coral
34:35
basically yeah if they don't get the
34:36
algae back in time
34:38
when the temperature returns to normal
34:40
then that coral is dead
34:41
it's interesting isn't it because we
34:43
would probably think of algae as a bad
34:44
thing
34:45
for living like if you're covered in
34:47
algae yeah like
34:48
yeah for people it's really bad yeah for
34:50
them yeah it's really really vital
34:52
so um coral is dying at the moment in
34:55
the northwest coast of uh bali they've
34:58
been doing this thing there's a beach
34:59
that if you walk along
35:01
i'm going to pronounce it wrong but it's
35:02
pemitoran if you walk along this beach
35:04
you'll see
35:05
power cables going into the ocean so you
35:07
literally you'll be walking over power
35:09
cables and what they've been doing
35:10
is they've been attaching low voltage
35:12
power cables to corals
35:14
to stimulate them from all the bleaching
35:16
that's going on so they're giving a
35:18
little electric shocks
35:19
into these coral and for some reason and
35:22
again
35:23
they're slightly yeah they're into it
35:24
but it's slightly like we haven't
35:26
shown in any study that they're better
35:28
than any of the other methods that we're
35:29
doing and i think it's still bit new
35:31
research but that's what they're doing
35:32
at the moment they're putting electric
35:33
cables
35:34
onto coral basically the whole problem
35:36
is the sea temperature rising which is
35:38
not something that can be counteracted
35:41
large
35:42
scale you know if it goes up by one
35:44
degree it's really bad for them and
35:45
we're looking at one and a half or yeah
35:47
or two degrees of rise in the ocean
35:48
temperature so
35:49
uh it looks that's the kind of thing
35:50
that's like even if we stop now that's
35:52
the irreversible change isn't it yeah
35:54
and the the really terrible thing is uh
35:57
well
35:57
that's the really terrible thing but
35:58
also so shallow coral reefs there are
36:00
different kinds um
36:02
shallow coral reefs of the tiny amount
36:04
of the ocean surface obviously
36:05
um but about 25 of marine species have a
36:09
home
36:09
you know in and around and on reefs and
36:11
they're these huge
36:13
yes it's like one habitat of the planet
36:15
of the oceans but 25 percent of the
36:17
yeah there's 0.1 of the ocean surface
36:20
there's 25
36:21
of marine species that manage to find a
36:23
home there so it's this huge knock-on
36:25
effect that might happen if we lose
36:27
coral reefs yeah yeah but have you heard
36:28
about
36:29
uh the twilight zone
36:32
so the twilight zone is a deep reef and
36:35
a deep reef
36:36
is really interesting because it's far
36:39
down enough that it would require extra
36:42
scuba gear in a way that
36:43
isn't affordable really but it's not
36:45
deep enough that you would send a
36:47
submersible that was
36:48
either manned by humans or done by
36:50
remote so they haven't really studied it
36:52
and only in the last 20 years they've
36:53
been studying this twilight zone
36:55
of reef where they found that all the
36:57
fish that live in it
36:58
are exactly the same as it appears they
37:01
might have been for hundreds of millions
37:02
of years as in
37:03
most coral higher up would be subject to
37:06
say ice ages and so on
37:08
and they couldn't escape from it because
37:09
they wouldn't know how to go deeper so
37:10
there's this whole level of new reef
37:12
that they've started they've had
37:13
more stability yes they've had no change
37:15
because they wouldn't need to escape the
37:17
glaciers or they're that deep enough
37:19
that's the thing with that statistic and
37:20
i'm not about to poo poo at the 25
37:22
thing but obviously there's so much of
37:23
the ocean we haven't studied because
37:24
it's too difficult to get to
37:26
yeah so actually that 25 of like the
37:28
ones we can count which are in the
37:29
bright shallow bits
37:30
i read something about the sea floor
37:33
today
37:34
this isn't really related apart from
37:35
it's in the sea um but there's a place
37:37
called octopolis
37:39
uh which is just off the coast of
37:41
australia most oxygens kind of live on
37:43
their own
37:44
uh and this is a place where octopuses
37:46
kind of come together
37:47
and hang out and they kind of touch each
37:49
other which helps pluses don't really
37:50
like to do much
37:51
okay when they're not mating or fighting
37:54
um but it's a place where they kind of
37:55
hang out like a swingers club
37:57
actually well why did you drop your pen
38:00
when i said
38:02
it
38:05
[Laughter]
38:14
she's a carl um
38:17
so here's the really interesting thing
38:19
about that right
38:20
so octopuses are really really smart
38:22
really smart
38:23
um but they're not quite as smart as um
38:26
things with a similar sized brain that
38:28
live
38:28
out of the water and one of the reasons
38:30
is they're not social and they think
38:31
that
38:32
by being social it helps your
38:34
intelligence uh
38:35
but they think that this kind of area of
38:37
octopuses because they're all kind of
38:38
hanging out together they might get
38:40
smarter and smarter and smarter
38:41
and if we were to leave them alone they
38:42
might get super smart so you know that's
38:44
the tribal effect is what it's called in
38:45
human beings
38:47
and susan pinker wrote a book about it
38:48
which i don't think she mentions animals
38:50
at all but it's that's the theories the
38:51
more you interact with other beings that
38:53
you have to learn to communicate you
38:54
become more intelligent
38:55
and her theory is that men who
38:57
communicate more and more tribal live
38:58
longer
38:59
and that it's you know the whole there's
39:00
all these theories that men talk a lot
39:02
less they have a smaller vocabulary they
39:04
talk less every day
39:05
in tribes where they talk as much as
39:07
women they live as long as they're women
39:09
oh this is her theory and how that's
39:11
what her book's about yeah
39:12
there's a fish called file fish they eat
39:15
coral
39:16
and they um gain the smell of the coral
39:19
so it means they can hide in the coral
39:20
and no one can find them
39:22
so it's like if you were to eat
39:23
something and you got the smell of it
39:25
and then
39:25
yeah then then you'd like hide in a
39:27
pizza shop
39:29
no one even knows you're not a pizza
39:33
[Applause]
39:37
okay it is time for a final fact of the
39:39
show and that is my fact my fact this
39:42
week is that the first
39:43
female british playwright was called
39:46
joanna lumley
39:48
yeah but it wasn't joanna lumley but not
39:51
the first
39:51
british playwright as in as in
39:54
absolutely fabulous
39:55
yes so it's not the current living
39:57
johanna lumley no
39:58
this is from the 1500s um and the
40:01
uh the thing is is that her name in a
40:04
lot of
40:04
uh online and in books she'll be
40:06
presented as jane
40:08
lumley um but actually so little is
40:10
known about people from the 1500s it's
40:12
quite hard to establish if she was born
40:14
joanna
40:15
or jane but definitely she was joanna
40:17
lumley and i just thought that was kind
40:18
of cool
40:18
i hadn't heard that before but she was a
40:20
translator rather than a playwright
40:22
yes and it wasn't even published or
40:24
finished um
40:25
god i love the olden days yeah
40:27
everyone's dreams could come true
40:28
it has it has since been published in
40:31
1909
40:32
uh so it has made it to publication
40:34
people do put it on in the uk
40:36
as a play um and uh but she was a very
40:39
interesting
40:40
person obviously she couldn't publish
40:41
stuff at the time because she was
40:43
uh what was known as a woman and they
40:46
yeah they were not thank you not keen on
40:49
them back then
40:50
um they didn't allow them to do stuff
40:52
like uh put out plays so it's a shame
40:54
because she was an extraordinary person
40:56
um and uh yeah she did this translation
40:58
of
40:59
canon euripides yeah um yeah i just
41:02
thought that was quite cool yeah it was
41:03
cool
41:04
so um because we were looking up jane or
41:06
joanna lumley i
41:07
looked up the first woman in the uk who
41:09
wrote her own original play
41:11
and and her name was uh elizabeth curry
41:14
and um
41:14
i love it it's called the the tragedy of
41:16
mariam do you know what it's about
41:19
no is it robin hood it isn't it's about
41:22
herod she was herod's second wife she
41:24
wanted to hear the synopsis of this play
41:25
i mean he had a wife called doris didn't
41:27
he yeah that would have been his first
41:28
wife i think or maybe
41:30
third spoilers
41:36
okay so this is full of spoilers but
41:38
basically yeah
41:39
this was something written in 1613. yeah
41:41
i know if you haven't seen it so far
41:43
you're probably not going to see it now
41:45
and so basically herrera the great his
41:47
words
41:48
um basically the first four acts
41:50
everyone thinks that he's dead
41:52
and and mariam's like working out how
41:54
she feels about him because she's like
41:55
oh he did love me he was a wonderful
41:56
husband but he also did kill my brother
41:58
and grandad
41:59
and she's trying to work out what to do
42:01
and because he's been merging everyone
42:02
but then at four herod returns
42:04
and he says to everyone i'm not even
42:05
dead and um
42:07
then salome says that marion was
42:10
unfaithful even though she wasn't and
42:11
then herod kills her
42:13
the end oh yeah it's a long lead
42:16
up of four acts of deliberation even
42:18
though she's not it's named after murray
42:19
and she's only in it ten percent of the
42:21
time
42:21
wow there's a lot of chorus work um
42:23
elizabeth carey
42:24
very interesting person um she was she
42:26
loved reading um to the point where her
42:28
parents had to ban
42:30
anyone in the house giving her candles
42:31
at night so that she would stay up
42:33
by candlelight reading yeah reading
42:35
books so they were like you have to
42:36
start and they were very encouraging
42:37
for parents of her reading but only in
42:39
daylight yeah right
42:41
you may just sleep yeah um and she was
42:44
brilliant at languages she spoke a bunch
42:46
of languages
42:47
spanish italian latin hebrew
42:48
transylvanian and this is my favorite
42:51
fact it says that later on at the age of
42:52
10 so this is all before 10 years old
42:54
she learned these languages
42:56
she helped exonerate a woman who was
42:57
accused of witchcraft
42:59
after noticing that the accused lady was
43:01
answering yes
43:02
to every question she was asked without
43:04
thinking about what she was being asked
43:07
so at 10 she was like she's just saying
43:09
yes because you're asking her questions
43:10
you have no idea what you're talking
43:11
about and they said you're right she's
43:12
exonerated she's not a witch
43:14
that's so interesting yes
43:16
[Laughter]
43:18
um um so aphra ben was a very
43:21
influential
43:22
she this is a later still this is yeah
43:24
and she's often who has attributed this
43:26
she is
43:26
she says she's the first time she was
43:28
the first female player but she
43:29
she was a very influential female player
43:32
right in the 17th century and she was
43:34
doubly cool because she was also a spy
43:37
yeah
43:37
wow one of the reasons that she wrote or
43:40
she wrote and then she gave it up for a
43:41
while
43:42
and she took it up again partly to make
43:43
a living because the government had not
43:45
paid her for doing all the spying work
43:46
that she had done
43:48
um but her stuff is really good yeah
43:50
yeah brilliant
43:51
i only said that because she's the only
43:53
one of these three that i've read stuff
43:55
by but uh during
43:56
during my english studies yeah same here
43:58
and they said she was the first
44:00
proper female player
44:03
was it her own original play though yeah
44:05
they were yeah she was
44:09
i don't want to give to my own
44:11
facts but i think she uh who you're just
44:13
talking about has more of a claim
44:14
to first female player right well hers
44:16
is like an adapted screenplay
44:18
yeah i think eric kerry has claimed
44:20
truth
44:26
like female first as a thing yeah and so
44:28
i looked on the wikipedia list of female
44:29
firsts and i found out something so
44:30
delightful so
44:32
uh elizabeth thyball in 1784 was the
44:35
first woman to ride in a hot air balloon
44:38
okay oh how exciting but in 1805 only 19
44:42
years later
44:43
sophie blanchard was the first woman to
44:45
pilot on herself
44:47
so it took women 19 years to work out
44:50
how to give him being a passenger
44:53
so then i thought this is so interesting
44:54
there's sophie blanchard um so basically
44:57
her husband was a hot air balloon pilot
44:59
and he died so she carried on his
45:01
business and so she became his first one
45:03
and napoleon really liked her and he
45:04
gave her this title that aeronaut
45:06
of the airfield festival or something
45:09
and then she died
45:11
because she set up some fireworks
45:16
hit her house and fell to the ground
45:18
that's why we shouldn't let women do
45:19
45:21
they can't be trusted all of this so uh
45:24
so female playwrights and things even
45:26
up until the time of aphro ben which is
45:28
you know a long time after the first
45:30
play written by women weren't allowed on
45:32
stage yeah yes so
45:33
it was all boys um but
45:37
the reason that it was ended was because
45:39
basically charles ii
45:40
when he was restored to the throne yeah
45:42
um fancy actresses
45:44
he fancied actresses and he he he
45:46
decreed
45:47
well what we have to do actually i think
45:49
the public will be outraged about
45:51
um boys appearing on stage in uh women's
45:54
roles when actually no one really was
45:56
outraged about it but he said no it's
45:57
completely outrageous
45:58
we must you know legalize and make it
46:00
compulsory for female roles to be played
46:02
by women
46:03
that's basically the only reason it
46:04
happened how could he sorry if this is a
46:06
very dumb comment how could he fancy
46:08
actresses if
46:09
the profession didn't exist some things
46:11
kind of happened
46:13
i mean illegally you fancy the idea of
46:15
actresses right
46:16
look at those boys imagine if those were
46:18
real
46:18
[Laughter]
46:21
things happened uh illegally but also so
46:24
in shakespeare's time what some of the
46:25
people who accredited writing were
46:26
women like women did actually write
46:28
things it's just they didn't get their
46:30
names on them
46:31
yeah so i read actually in one article i
46:33
don't know if this is true but by the
46:34
late 17th century about a third of plays
46:37
staged in london were written by women
46:39
but it fell to around
46:41
seven percent in the early 18th century
46:43
and it stayed between
46:45
seven and ten percent until the 1980s
46:48
wow yeah and it's so related to
46:51
economics
46:52
actually when you look at the ups and
46:54
downs women who have space and time it's
46:55
the whole virginia wolf thing
46:57
created just as much as men yeah um jane
47:00
austen
47:00
thing you know writing on tiny bits of
47:02
paper i went to see her desk the other
47:03
day
47:05
uh library yeah yeah and you're just so
47:07
amazed it's such a visual symbol of like
47:09
this woman like in the corner like don't
47:10
worry i won't take up any room
47:12
yeah it's like and it's really tiny it
47:14
has her her spectacles on it it's the
47:15
size of an iphone
47:17
it's really it's really small she was a
47:19
mouse yeah she was a
47:20
last lady queen victoria was an orca
47:22
jane austen was a mouse
47:23
my wife was a coral are there any actual
47:26
women please
47:28
it's been a trick the entire time
47:35

you

=147
00:00
hi guys just a quick announcement before
00:01
we start this show and that announcement
00:03
is that andrew hunter murray
00:05
of qi podcast fame is doing his own show
00:08
it's a solo show he did at edinburgh
00:10
last year
00:10
and he's going to be doing it at the
00:11
soho theater in london from the 6th to
00:13
the 8th of march
00:14
and you're gonna find this as hard to
00:16
believe as i did but it's genuinely
00:18
hysterically funny it's extremely good
00:20
it's like he saved up all of his funny
00:21
stuff
00:22
and put it in that show rather than in
00:24
our show so you should definitely go and
00:26
see it go to the solar theatre website
00:27
it's andrew hunter murray
00:29
round one is what it's called okay on
00:31
with the show
00:33
i mean it did sell out in edinburgh i
00:34
don't want to make a big point about it
00:44
[Music]
00:47
[Applause]
00:49
[Music]
00:51
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:53
no such thing as a fish
00:54
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:56
covent garden my name is anna tashinsky
00:58
and i'm here with alex bell james harkin
01:00
and
01:01
andrew hunter murray once again we've
01:04
gathered around the microphones with our
01:05
four favorite facts from the last seven
01:07
days
01:08
and in no particular order here we go
01:11
james harkin okay my fact this week is
01:14
that in 1683
01:16
some people were ice skating in the
01:17
netherlands when the ice broke away
01:20
and they floated all the way to essex
01:28
it happened according to some people um
01:31
so this is from a book called the thames
01:33
and its tributaries by charles mackay
01:35
it's an old book
01:36
and he says it's reported that this
01:38
happened uh he says that some skate
01:41
sliders
01:41
upon those large icy planes were
01:44
unawares
01:45
driven to sea and arrived living though
01:47
almost perished with cold and hunger
01:49
upon the seacoast of essex okay and
01:52
you know what i don't really believe it
01:54
but it is a kind of thing that happened
01:56
and
01:56
it's kind of related to the uh mini ice
01:59
age that happened
02:01
in the 17th century when it got really
02:03
really cold
02:04
and basically the sea was freezing and
02:06
all the rivers were freezing
02:08
and they had these frost fares in london
02:10
and there was lots of crazy stuff that
02:11
happened whether this happened
02:12
i don't really know but i believe it
02:16
yes i want to did they put a sail up
02:19
yeah how big was the ice shelf
02:20
well that one sentence that i said is
02:22
the sum total of all the information i
02:24
have about this fact
02:26
did they accidentally cut the raft off
02:27
with their skates well what used to
02:29
happen
02:29
is they would um people would have these
02:32
fares on the rivers
02:33
and then they would try and keep them
02:35
going as long as possible because they
02:36
were so much fun
02:37
um but then as the kind of ice got less
02:40
and less and less it would break up into
02:41
icebergs and then people get stuck on
02:43
these little ice floes
02:45
and that that definitely did happen yeah
02:47
they also tried to keep them going
02:48
because they were quite
02:49
economically important so the the london
02:52
thames frost fares
02:53
happened partly because when the thames
02:55
freeze is over all the trade from the
02:57
sea has to stop
02:58
and like on one occasion i think it was
03:00
two months that the thames froze over so
03:01
wow that all the people that are usually
03:03
working on the docks or stuff like that
03:04
had nothing to do they had no income all
03:06
of a sudden
03:06
it was all the ferryman as well and they
03:08
were really cheeky so what they did they
03:09
would guard the access to the river
03:11
basically because there are ladders and
03:13
slipways it's not just a case of walking
03:15
straight out onto the river
03:16
and they would charge you two or three
03:18
pennies to climb down the ladder and get
03:20
onto the river and then they'd charge
03:21
you another penny to leave
03:23
even if you left up the same ladder even
03:25
if you left up the same ladder
03:26
really and you can't talk to the ticket
03:27
inspector in the office and ask if you
03:29
can get a refund
03:30
card there's no office there's no oyster
03:31
card there's no i
03:33
i don't know about the incentive
03:35
programs they had to come and use the
03:36
same ladder again
03:37
what happens though if you spend your
03:39
last penny on a bit of you know candy
03:40
floss or something
03:42
and then how do you get off you have to
03:43
stay on the river
03:48
they must have been so exciting though
03:49
the thames river affairs and partly
03:51
because there weren't that many of them
03:53
so this little ice age
03:54
i think you were saying was in the 1700s
03:56
but it it sort of spanned from the 13th
03:58
century to the 19th and reached its peak
04:00
then
04:00
and there were only five thames frost
04:03
fares
04:04
i thought in that period where properly
04:06
the thames froze over and all industry
04:08
moved on to the thames so it must have
04:09
been so thrilling when it happened
04:11
yeah and they had like you know an
04:12
elephant walked across didn't it in the
04:14
18 was it the 18 14 18 14 yeah
04:18
yeah but what happened was the elephant
04:19
walked across the river right next to
04:21
black friar's bridge
04:22
which seems unnecessarily dangerous
04:25
doesn't it when you've got a bridge
04:28
a bit of a slap in the face of the
04:29
bridge building they are kind of
04:30
dangerous because there was a bloke who
04:32
because a few people died falling
04:34
through the ice
04:35
really really few compared with the
04:36
number of people there but one of them
04:37
was a plumber who was carrying a load of
04:39
lead across the river on the ice
04:41
and he you know clearly got to a week
04:43
bit of ice and fell in but apparently
04:45
if if that happened a load of people and
04:47
tents would just get dragged into a hole
04:48
which just sounds
04:50
terrifying it did happen on a couple of
04:51
occasions like just a huge chunk of ice
04:53
and tents and people would disappear
04:55
there was one time when the ice broke up
04:57
and it was
04:58
there were things attached to a local
05:01
building
05:01
and then the ice broke up and kind of
05:03
drifted away and pulled this building
05:05
down oh yeah i think it was a pub wasn't
05:06
it and it was when a ship had been
05:08
anchored to a pub near rotherhithe
05:10
and they just tied it around the beam of
05:11
the pub and then it dragged the pub down
05:13
with it when they
05:13
like when you take your dog to a pub and
05:15
leave it outside and tie it up
05:16
but it's the world's strongest clifford
05:21
well yeah they put a cable around the
05:23
beam in the middle of the pump and then
05:24
they put an anchor in the cellar of the
05:26
pub
05:26
to keep it there attached to the chips
05:28
obviously i mean you're just asking for
05:30
the pub to be ripped out of its mooring
05:31
kind of yeah five people died though
05:33
apparently the highlight in 1814 was
05:35
they
05:36
roasted an entire ox on the ice and
05:39
this guy called ivan day has replicated
05:41
that and says it takes 24 hours to spit
05:43
roast an ox and it would feed 800 people
05:46
it's also interesting that you could
05:47
light fires apparently a lot of the
05:48
tents
05:49
like the shoemaker's tents and things
05:51
that had fires in them to keep the
05:52
people inside warm
05:53
and that worked somehow and didn't melt
05:55
the ice because it was really thick
05:56
they also had a lot of souvenirs which
05:58
you could get right but basically
06:01
they just had tat and books and toys and
06:04
things that had been made in london and
06:06
they just
06:07
took them out of the ice put a label on
06:08
them saying sold on the icy thames and
06:10
then sell them for three times as much
06:12
i'd buy it wow yeah well there was one
06:13
book that was made in the frost fair it
06:15
was called frostiana or a history of the
06:18
river thames in a frozen state
06:20
and the entire book was typeset and
06:22
printed at a printing store which had
06:24
been set up on the thames
06:25
this is cool i haven't heard of any
06:26
other book which was printed
06:28
at the place that it's about and then
06:30
sold there as well do you know they had
06:31
ice brothels
06:33
today yeah it sounds very uncomfortable
06:35
there were sex tents on the ice
06:37
nice i know it was written of one woman
06:40
uh the heat of her buttocks made such a
06:42
great thought
06:42
she had leaf to drowned the man of the
06:44
law so that's really sad
06:48
it's probably not going to happen
06:49
anymore i mean obviously it hasn't
06:50
happened for 200 years but the reason
06:52
it happened in the first place was that
06:54
the it happened uh
06:55
near the old london bridge right and
06:57
that had loads and loads and loads of
06:59
arches so it was really annoying for
07:00
river traffic because the archers
07:02
meant you couldn't get big ships through
07:04
there and as a result that slowed the
07:05
flow of the water down and it meant that
07:07
um it was it was froze over much more
07:10
easily he actually sped the flow of the
07:11
water up what slowed the flow of the
07:13
watertown was that the thames was
07:14
much wider and shallower than because it
07:16
hadn't been embanked there was no
07:17
embankment
07:18
so what the old london bridge did was
07:20
the arches were much narrower which
07:21
meant that it was much easier for a
07:22
block of ice that was floating in to get
07:24
stuck
07:24
and sort of form uh the beginning of a
07:26
dam which ice could then form across
07:28
i reckon that we have the technology now
07:30
to freeze the thames if we wanted to i
07:32
was going to say it would be really cool
07:33
if we did it again by just injecting
07:35
probably or something yeah it probably
07:36
cost quite a bit but city can come on
07:39
i don't know if that one penny entrance
07:40
and exit fee is going to pay for the
07:42
technology
07:43
of freezing the entire thames they used
07:45
to play sports
07:46
um while it froze over on the thames um
07:48
they played football
07:50
for instance um they also played donkey
07:52
racing
07:53
nine pin bowling throwing at cox
07:56
all right sorry just go back because i
07:57
read about the nine pin bowling and i
07:58
want to know when they added the extra
08:00
pin
08:01
i like the way that i went nine pin
08:03
bowling and throwing at cox and it was
08:05
nine people
08:06
but you had a problem with uh my
08:08
understanding of nine pin bowling and
08:09
temping bowling
08:10
and this is going off really old
08:12
knowledge is that
08:14
they banned nine pin bowling for
08:16
gambling
08:17
and then they kind of put in an extra
08:20
pin to try and get around the law
08:22
i see very clever yeah throwing it cox
08:24
actually sounds like it's the same as
08:26
nine pin bowling really doesn't it
08:27
it does but with instead of pins
08:29
yeah it's like an upgrade
08:31
too that's pretty much what it is apart
08:32
from so you get a chicken
08:34
and you throw stuff on it that's kind of
08:36
how it happened nice
08:38
there's also shooting at pricks
08:41
yeah it's not the same as throwing at
08:43
cox um it's kind of shoes that pricks is
08:45
an old
08:46
name for a kind of archery apparently
08:49
what was the prick
08:50
it's i would imagine it must be this the
08:51
sharp bet at the end of your arrow
08:53
i would have thought that as well but
08:54
you don't shoot at that you're right are
08:56
they throwing
08:56
are they throwing the board towards the
08:58
arrows
09:00
no a prick is an old word for a small
09:03
indentation or something that
09:05
sounds like a needle prick yeah so
09:07
that's what you were aiming for the
09:08
little indentations cool
09:09
um in 1540 the word prick was a term of
09:12
endearment for a man
09:14
so instead of darling or sweetheart you
09:16
would say my prick
09:18
um in six is that because of the penis
09:22
uh thing uh this prick i'm sure has
09:25
meant penis for quite a long time yeah i
09:26
think it has i think it's
09:27
shakespeareanish isn't it yeah and you
09:29
you you say watch a i do say cuz i
09:31
said it all the time
09:32
and not all the time constantly saying
09:34
it to me
09:36
well in the 1960s a spare prick at a
09:38
wedding
09:39
was a bit of british slang for someone
09:41
who is embarrassingly out of place in a
09:43
particular situation
09:45
okay i think that's worth bringing back
09:47
but not somebody with their out
09:50
that would be i mean that would work as
09:51
well isn't it that you wouldn't be out
09:53
of place like that
09:56
we have just been to dan's wedding and i
09:58
don't remember much of that going on
09:59
oh you're in the wrong room um so
10:03
russia was quite used to these kind of
10:04
things it wasn't as exciting there they
10:06
were accustomed to
10:07
their rivers freezing over and having
10:09
big fares and stuff on them still
10:10
still are i've skied on the moscow river
10:12
have you when i went to petersburg i saw
10:14
a wedding actually happening on the
10:15
frozen night
10:16
it was amazing
10:19
[Music]
10:22
[Laughter]
10:27
and i've accidentally married a snowman
10:31
[Applause]
10:34
[Music]
10:36
okay moving on to fact number two and
10:38
that is from alex bell
10:40
my fact this week is that former
10:42
argentinian president
10:43
carlos menem had such a reputation for
10:46
bad luck that people would touch their
10:48
left breast or testicle while shaking
10:49
his hand
10:50
i find the while shaking his hand bit
10:52
pretty insulting i think they used the
10:54
other hand
10:55
but it's fairly obvious what you're
10:57
doing if your hand slides into your
10:58
pocket
10:59
yeah as you're shaking hands with the
11:01
former president of your country yeah
11:03
absolutely
11:03
um this guy is extraordinary yeah we
11:06
should call him the unnamable because uh
11:08
it's bad luck to say his name
11:09
so he's like voldemort in many ways yeah
11:11
except people instead say things like
11:13
mendes or menon where with voldemort you
11:14
don't just save all the dram
11:18
so he's supposedly not allowed to attend
11:20
football matches
11:21
argentina team football matches because
11:23
in 1990 in the world cup he visited when
11:26
they were playing
11:27
and he approached the goalkeeper uh
11:28
pompido to shake hands
11:30
and this was ages ago so clearly the the
11:33
myth was established even though that he
11:34
was cursed
11:35
the goalie refused to shake his hand
11:37
because of the curse he's just sort of
11:38
put his hands up and said no you're not
11:40
gonna
11:40
no so then uh madame laughed and he gave
11:43
him a pass on the knee and in the match
11:45
that followed
11:45
a argentina lost and b the goalkeeper
11:47
fractured his knee
11:49
how do you bat someone's knee at such a
11:50
stretch to get down there
11:52
he was probably aiming for the left
11:54
testicles
11:56
do you know that um witchcraft is
11:58
explicitly banned in
11:59
malawi i think it is in football
12:02
is it yeah as in it's in their rules
12:05
that you're not allowed to
12:06
really i don't think it's explicitly
12:08
illegal
12:09
in british football but i did write to a
12:12
referee about this to find out
12:14
what the truth is he hasn't replied
12:16
weirdly enough
12:17
but i reckon that it would be on
12:20
gentlemanly conduct
12:21
a yellow card and an indirect free kick
12:23
i don't think that matters though if
12:24
you've just turned stoke into picks
12:30
yeah football is full of these
12:32
superstitions though it's all you do
12:34
something once
12:35
you win a match and then you have to do
12:36
it every time yeah
12:38
so scoring goals so there was a another
12:42
argentinian
12:42
guy carlos belardo in the quarterfinals
12:45
the goalie had to pee on the pitch
12:47
because they're about to have a penalty
12:48
shootout and there wasn't time for him
12:49
to get back to the dressing room and
12:50
have a pee there
12:51
so his teammates all surrounded him in a
12:53
wall and he had a pee on the pitch
12:56
and then he blocked two shots and
12:57
argentina ended up going through so the
12:59
next match
13:00
every time there was a free kick and
13:01
they made a wall he peed against them
13:05
next match bellado um made him pee on
13:08
the pitch
13:08
again because he thought it would be
13:10
lucky right did it work
13:12
it did not work they did not win the
13:13
next minute it's gonna be you're gonna
13:14
be under pressure aren't you
13:15
like with you know 60 000 people
13:18
watching
13:21
um so yeah back to menom and the reasons
13:23
that people think he's bad luck
13:25
i like the fact that he shook the hand
13:27
of the world powerboat racing champion
13:30
who was called daniel skioli in 1989 and
13:33
immediately scaredy's boat crashed and
13:34
he lost his arm
13:35
but then scurly became an mp for mr
13:38
manam's party
13:39
michael schumacher i think he shook his
13:41
hand and then michael schumacher was
13:42
immediately shunted
13:44
yeah but then he narrowly won the next
13:46
race and if that's the curse
13:48
that you win by slightly less than
13:49
you're normally accustomed to i think
13:50
it's not much of a curse
13:51
yeah he's also known as the father of
13:53
the devastating 2001 economic collapse
13:55
which is a pretty
13:57
that is a heavy title to be taking if
13:59
you want to be the father of anything
14:00
it's not that
14:01
yeah madame did become famous for his uh
14:03
womanizing as well so he married a
14:05
former miss universe when he was about
14:07
seventy-three and a reason
14:09
for her i like this is confusing so
14:12
there was an article listing all of his
14:14
all of his bad lucks and it ended on
14:16
this so it went through all these people
14:17
that he's cursed
14:18
it ended by saying the night before the
14:20
2000 u.s presidential elections
14:23
the unnamable as in menem is said to
14:25
have called his good friend george w
14:27
bush to wish him good luck
14:29
need i say more i mean george has won
14:32
that election
14:34
i don't actually won that election
14:35
despite losing that election so
14:37
it's incredibly good luck my favorite
14:39
thing about him is that his surname is a
14:41
palindrome
14:42
that's pretty much all i like um which
14:45
means that he has something in common
14:46
with
14:47
ex-cambodian president null
14:50
wow who as far as i can tell is the only
14:52
head of state ever to be a complete
14:54
palindrome
14:55
really that's really good do you think
14:56
they meet well they have a little club
14:58
yeah in the middle somewhere in in
15:00
panama yes
15:02
in a canal in panama in a in a man in a
15:04
canal
15:07
in his election campaign one of the ways
15:09
he won is that he saw he'd throw the
15:10
brits out of the falklands
15:12
and then as soon as he did when he
15:13
started really trying to ingratiate
15:14
himself with britain
15:15
to the extent that um he angled
15:17
desperately according to the guardian
15:19
for an invitation to bucky and palace
15:21
so many times did he announce that he
15:22
had been invited to london
15:24
that the foreign office eventually had
15:25
to let him come which i didn't know you
15:28
could do that if you just announced
15:29
repeatedly that the queen's invited you
15:30
to buckingham palace she's eventually
15:31
forced to let you
15:32
let you through the door no you work for
15:34
any party so i'm coming tonight i'm
15:36
really forward congressman it's gonna be
15:37
great hey everyone i'm coming to this
15:38
party
15:39
i think that would work yeah do you
15:40
think it would well you're playing by a
15:42
rule that other people don't recognize
15:43
or rather you're not playing by rules
15:45
that other people do recognize
15:47
yes so if you just say i am invited to
15:49
this party people will be embarrassed
15:51
even though it's nothing to do with them
15:53
it's all you embarrassing yourself that
15:54
the embarrassment will reflect on them
15:57
okay yeah fine whatever it doesn't
16:00
affect my life so much if they come to
16:02
my party
16:03
yeah and i don't want to look like a
16:05
rude idiot yeah
16:06
weirdly i did get a letter from the
16:07
queen yesterday asking if i wanted to
16:09
attend her
16:10
private reception next week yeah um i
16:13
was i found a really questionable list
16:15
on
16:16
on core i think it was of some other
16:17
superstitions in a discussion
16:20
i like the way you said the word quora
16:21
in a real undertone in the hope that
16:23
people might miss that
16:26
my favorite ones were um apparently it's
16:28
bad luck to leave your purse lying open
16:30
on the floor because that means that
16:31
you'll lose money
16:33
obviously somehow related
16:36
also if you eat watermelon with a glass
16:38
of red wine you will die
16:39
and apparently loads of argentinians
16:40
just like that's just a proper wise tale
16:42
that people like don't do that you will
16:44
die
16:44
i've heard things like that not just in
16:46
argentina
16:47
because it used to be i think that you
16:50
would have foods that
16:51
were very hot foods and foods that were
16:53
very cold foods
16:54
and even if they weren't necessarily hot
16:56
or cold they were felt that that's the
16:58
effect they would have on your body
16:59
and the watermelon would be particularly
17:02
cold and icy
17:03
whereas the wine would warm you up and
17:04
it would think that like the two
17:06
opposites would kind of clash in
17:09
there it's friday the 13th today which
17:12
is one reason we might be talking about
17:14
um
17:14
superstitions and there's a vets in
17:17
australia that has a promotion for
17:18
friday the 13th
17:20
where it's discounting it's neutering
17:22
for black cats
17:23
oh that's so we've got a black cat i
17:26
could fly to australia and save loads of
17:27
money getting it
17:30
is that is the aim so that there are
17:31
fewer black cats because some people
17:32
think they're bad luck i think they're
17:33
good luck
17:34
it depends which way they cross the road
17:36
if they cross from left to right it's
17:37
one and if they cross them right left
17:38
is it different in the uk and the rest
17:40
of europe that's a really good point
17:43
and also which way you're going on the
17:44
road as well no
17:46
you're coming towards the cat so if it
17:48
crosses from your left to your right
17:50
it's one relative to you whereas someone
17:52
walking the other way will experience
17:53
opposite luck based on the movement of
17:55
the cat
17:55
right okay you know left and right is
17:57
always relative yeah that's the thing
17:58
about it oh yeah that is the interesting
18:00
thing that it's impossible
18:02
or there's not very many ways to explain
18:05
to an alien say
18:06
which is left and which is right if you
18:08
don't have a similar field of reference
18:10
yeah i'd have more important things to
18:12
talk about all right
18:14
yeah i bet you'd freeze up if it
18:15
actually came to it yeah i'd be very
18:17
nervous i'm not good with new people
18:20
whole new species so i'm really looking
18:23
forward to coming to your planet
18:25
yeah you've said that five times
18:28
[Applause]
18:31
[Music]
18:32
okay we should move on to fact number
18:34
three and that
18:36
is my fact my fact this week is that
18:38
isambard kingdom brunel once spent six
18:40
weeks with a coin stuck in his windpipe
18:43
as a result of a magic trick that
18:44
backfired did he
18:46
he did indeed yeah so i found this i was
18:50
for some reason i was looking him up in
18:51
the british newspaper archive a bit
18:53
bored
18:53
and i found an obituary for him from
18:56
1862 and it said the closest he came to
18:58
death
18:59
was when he was trying to impress his
19:01
children in 1843
19:04
apart from his actual the closest he
19:06
came to death was one second before he
19:08
died
19:10
the second closest he came to death i'm
19:12
sure they issued a correction the next
19:14
day
19:14
um he was trying to impress his children
19:16
as uh by doing a magic trick where he
19:18
swallowed a half sovereign coin and then
19:20
brought it out of his ear but instead
19:23
the sovereign landed in his windpipe
19:25
so what happened um so what happened was
19:27
uh he had chest pains for a while and
19:28
quite bad coughing
19:29
and he because he's an engineer as we
19:31
know uh possibly the most important
19:33
thing he ever designed was a contraption
19:35
in order to extract it
19:37
and i couldn't find any diagrams of it
19:39
but apparently it was a movable platform
19:40
with hinges on it
19:42
which i think he strapped his body to
19:44
and it bent his body over
19:45
an 80 degree angle and then he was
19:47
repeatedly struck on the back and the
19:49
idea was that this would dislodge the
19:50
coin
19:51
so he tried this out and it almost
19:53
killed him one time so they didn't do
19:55
that again
19:56
and then he took six weeks having
19:58
various doctors fiddle about with him
19:59
one of them tried to get forceps in
20:01
there and pull it out but he nearly died
20:02
again
20:03
and then eventually he went back to the
20:05
contraption but this time with an
20:07
incision cut in his throat
20:09
and he bent himself over on this
20:11
contraption he designed
20:12
and there was this incision on his
20:13
throat which was you know when you have
20:15
like a tracheotomy that was
20:16
allowing him to breathe and so he then
20:18
managed to choke the coin
20:20
up and as it was rising up through his
20:22
windpipe he was still able to breathe
20:23
because the incision was there in his
20:24
throat
20:25
and he coughed it up and he actually did
20:27
say that
20:28
the moment when he heard the gold piece
20:30
strike against his upper front teeth
20:32
was perhaps the most exquisite moment of
20:34
his whole life wow
20:36
it was a really famous thing throughout
20:37
the country the the isn't about kingdom
20:39
brunel coin thing everyone knew about it
20:41
because he was very famous at the time
20:42
yeah
20:42
so for example um there's a famous uh
20:45
victorian historian called thomas
20:46
babington macaulay
20:48
and when he read the good news
20:49
supposedly he ran along the street
20:51
yelling
20:52
it's out it's out and everybody knew
20:54
what he was talking about
20:55
[Laughter]
20:57
it is it's an incredible story yeah it
21:00
is so ingenious the way he
21:02
got himself out of it yeah and crazy he
21:03
caught himself out of it and that you
21:05
know all these doctors tried and then
21:06
he just built a machine yeah is he
21:08
clever for getting himself out or is he
21:09
stupid for getting himself into it i'd
21:10
say a bit of both
21:11
technically he got itself out of him
21:16
but yeah i was actually looking him up
21:17
because i visited recently
21:20
the brunel museum in rotherhithe which
21:22
if you are passing is
21:23
really cool it's absolutely tiny and
21:26
it's the mark brunell museum
21:28
so it's about the thames tunnel which is
21:30
the first ever tunnel that was built
21:31
under a river
21:32
and it was designed by mark brunell and
21:34
isambarbra now his son
21:35
helped him out and it's a really cool
21:37
place go there it's
21:39
an amazing story it was like an
21:40
unbelievable feat of engineering and
21:41
that's why he came third closest to
21:43
dying as well i got an extract of the
21:45
description of the
21:46
the conditions that the workers put up
21:48
with there
21:49
um they were showered in raw sewage and
21:51
dodged flames from ignited methane gas
21:54
whenever they worked it was the worst
21:55
job in the world they only worked
21:56
four-hour shifts because
21:58
they collapsed after four hours and then
21:59
would be replaced by men who were still
22:00
breathing and then they would
22:02
work for four hours and they'd be
22:03
replaced by another shift and they were
22:04
constant there were five floods i think
22:06
yeah in one of which bruno was down
22:07
there and nearly died and it's
22:09
like it's just insane that they carried
22:11
on why were they why did they have
22:12
showers of raw sewage i think because
22:14
the because there's constantly leaking
22:16
in the thames
22:17
was coming in disgusting but yeah so you
22:19
know when it froze up would it just be
22:21
like frozen turds everywhere yeah
22:24
i guess it would have been right bumpy
22:26
skate ring yeah i guess you have snow on
22:28
top as well yeah yeah
22:29
um so he brought a lot of this on
22:31
himself in the tunnel
22:32
um so he nearly drowned three times
22:35
right uh he fell into a water tank
22:37
uh once um that could have happened
22:39
anywhere exactly so that's not so bad
22:41
but then
22:42
there was a time where he was with a
22:43
party of influential visitors in a
22:45
rowing boat and he was trying to freak
22:46
them out by rocking it from side to side
22:48
fell in nearly drowned and it was a
22:51
third the third time the most deadly
22:53
time which we've just talked about
22:54
um was because he was told you shouldn't
22:57
dig through there that's that soft mud
22:59
that'll bring the river in
23:00
and he said no it's fine don't worry
23:02
about it he did and he dug through that
23:03
bit
23:04
river came in the ceiling collapsed and
23:06
um he was pulled to safety but
23:08
six members of the evacuation crew died
23:10
um just quickly on the tunnel
23:12
something else you should look up is the
23:13
painting that's been done
23:15
of the banquet that they had inside it
23:16
so one time when it flooded to celebrate
23:18
the fact that everyone hadn't died and
23:19
it was still going
23:20
they held this enormous banquet and they
23:22
invited all of high society there
23:23
that is asking for trouble listen
23:25
everyone almost died what should we do
23:27
let's get all of society
23:29
back in the tunnel apart from everything
23:31
else you're basically asking for the
23:32
riddler to attack
23:35
well it looks very exciting nobody died
23:37
so crisis averted
23:39
no and it looks amazing and they used to
23:40
have stalls so what did happen in the
23:42
tunnel was they had lots of little
23:43
market stores running all the way
23:44
through and it was a tourist attraction
23:46
it was much like the ice fairs and
23:47
people would have to pay a few pennies
23:48
to go into the tunnel
23:50
and they'd walk through someone see the
23:51
death tunnel of death
23:54
he also built an atmospheric railway i.e
23:56
a vacuum railway
23:58
pumped along by pressure and can we
24:00
refer to it as the atmospheric caper
24:02
which is what they called
24:07
unfortunately so basically there will be
24:08
huge pipelines pumping out air to create
24:10
a vacuum to push the train along with
24:12
atmospheric pressure
24:13
but it's such a cool steam punky reason
24:16
it failed
24:17
the technology needed the air pipes to
24:20
be sealed with leather flaps right
24:22
they needed to be kept supple and moist
24:24
so they needed tallow
24:25
kind of fat to be sort of smeared on
24:27
them right unfortunately
24:29
rats like eating tallow so they ate a
24:32
load of the
24:33
flaps uh and stopped the system from
24:36
working so
24:37
yeah the system the design was perfect
24:39
it was just the environment that it was
24:40
made
24:40
exactly and it did work for seven months
24:42
to successfully carry people from
24:43
exeter to plymouth i think and there is
24:45
a pub now in a place called starcross
24:47
called the atmospheric railway which
24:49
sounds all
24:50
modern but it was that was from you know
24:51
the mid 19th century really yeah
24:53
you'd be expecting a really atmospheric
24:54
i would say
24:58
we should say the good thing about the
24:59
atmospheric railway the reason he made
25:01
it is because
25:02
you don't need to carry your fuel with
25:03
you because there will be fuel planted
25:05
along the way
25:06
so that the way that the vacuum was
25:07
created was through piston action
25:09
and every three miles the pistons were
25:12
fueled by
25:12
steam by little steam sheds and so you
25:15
didn't need to have all this heavy fuel
25:16
that you carried with you on your train
25:18
so it would be efficient but then we
25:19
found electricity and we didn't need
25:21
anymore
25:22
so mark brunell great engineer
25:25
is embark kingdom brunel great engineer
25:28
so it's gone through the family and
25:30
there is another
25:31
direct descendant of brunel called moena
25:34
wilson
25:35
who made a craft made entirely out of
25:37
folded paper
25:39
and managed to sail it on some water
25:43
great great engineering right it's
25:46
amazing completely made out of paper
25:48
apart from the keel
25:52
which is made out of wood and
25:54
polystyrene
25:59
right that's pretty cool though yeah no
26:01
it's good that's awesome
26:02
does she charge people two pennies to
26:04
get in it and say the question
26:06
then does she rock it from
26:10
really tarnished my view of isn't
26:11
working every now and then it was an
26:13
absolute child
26:14
well he was a bit of a slave driver like
26:16
uh a lot of people died
26:17
on the huge tunnel he built on the great
26:20
western railway box stock
26:21
the box tunnel that's right yeah it's
26:22
not supposedly about 100 people died in
26:24
the day
26:25
of that and he supposedly did it so that
26:27
the sun shines down it on his birthday i
26:29
read that that's a myth though
26:31
well did you we worked it out and we
26:33
think it's pretty much
26:35
not far away from being true oh really
26:37
whether he did it on purpose or not
26:39
uh we actually asked um the railway
26:42
company if we could go and check it out
26:44
uh and they said no there's high-speed
26:46
trades going through here
26:47
the one thing we ask you not to do is
26:49
trespass on our railways yeah
26:51
so they wouldn't let us but um we reckon
26:53
that
26:54
at least it should pretty much work do
26:56
you know one thing he did do
26:57
in the box tunnel um speaking of
26:59
high-speed trains is
27:01
he used to quite like driving the steam
27:02
chain sometimes and he was driving
27:04
through the box tunnel
27:05
once uh next to the driver and he was
27:07
the one who was driving the train
27:09
and he suddenly saw a big obstacle in
27:10
front of him too late to break and avoid
27:13
it
27:13
and so so james bond put his foot down
27:16
like went full steam ahead and just
27:18
blasted straight through that's what
27:19
happened to our researcher
27:20
[Laughter]
27:22
and it turned out that it was a carriage
27:24
from another train that had accidentally
27:25
fallen off the train and left on the
27:26
track and he just blasted it into
27:28
smithereens
27:29
plowed right through it he was an action
27:31
all of his work actually came from
27:33
the time when he nearly drowned in the
27:34
thames because he went to convalesce for
27:36
ages and ages
27:37
in clifton near bristol and that's where
27:39
he got hired for a load of jobs because
27:40
he was thinking and writing and
27:42
designing all the time he was
27:43
convalescing
27:44
and at clifton so they had the two
27:46
towers of the bridge they didn't have
27:47
the main
27:48
body of the bridge but they did have an
27:49
inch and a half thick
27:51
metal uh while rope going across the
27:54
gorge by the time
27:55
while he was still alive and he went
27:58
across in a wicker basket
28:00
on a pulley and it jammed while they
28:02
were halfway across and if you
28:03
started rocking it if you've seen the
28:07
clifton gorge you know that is
28:08
terrifying because it is so high
28:10
instant death if you fell and he looked
28:13
up
28:13
took off his hat climbed up to the
28:16
pulley
28:16
unjammed it and they continued along the
28:18
way that's the fourth closest he came
28:20
today
28:22
um actually the foundations of the
28:24
clifton suspension bridge were
28:26
invented not by him but by a lady called
28:28
sarah guppy
28:30
uh who gave the plans to brunel for free
28:32
because she believed that women must not
28:33
be boastful
28:34
wow yeah there's someone's written a
28:36
book basically saying that brunel
28:38
was not nearly as good as we all think
28:40
and he didn't design the clip and
28:41
suspension bridge hardly any of it was
28:42
related to his original design even by
28:44
the time it was fully made
28:45
i think it was pretty good well read the
28:47
book andy i certainly haven't but i read
28:49
an article about it
28:53
[Applause]
28:55
[Music]
28:57
okay we should move on to fact number
28:59
four and that
29:01
is andy's facts yes my fact is that to
29:03
deal with violent or drunk people
29:05
japanese police carry massive futons and
29:07
roll the offender up in them to calm
29:09
them down
29:10
this is fantastic they genuinely look
29:12
they turn criminals into burritos
29:15
and would that calm you down do you
29:16
think i think it would if you're
29:18
rendered completely immobile you just
29:19
sort of in your comfy futon i would yeah
29:22
i'd calm down yeah like when you put a
29:23
bag over a horse's head and it stops
29:25
yeah stop doing that alex
29:28
um so this is from a podcast which is
29:30
called my perfect country
29:32
each episode is about a country that is
29:34
doing something right in a particular
29:36
aspect
29:37
of law or society or whatever it is uh
29:39
and
29:40
you're doing it perfectly so for example
29:42
this is about very low
29:44
crime and particularly gun crime in
29:46
japan
29:47
uh it's almost impossible to get a gun
29:49
in japan
29:50
you have to do exams you have to score
29:51
more than 95 percent on a rifle range
29:54
test
29:55
so if you do get a gun at least we know
29:57
you'll be incredibly accurate
29:59
yeah there's no attempted murder charges
30:01
ever yeah
30:02
so that's what they should do if you get
30:04
less than five percent in the rifle
30:06
range they should give you
30:08
help yourself yeah um and as a result
30:10
there were
30:12
uh six occasions last year when the
30:14
japanese police fired their guns in
30:15
total
30:16
and in 2014 there were six gun deaths i
30:18
mean they're just they just don't really
30:20
have them that's good
30:21
we do have very similar stats with uh uh
30:23
police people firing guns
30:25
um yeah so anyway this is about japanese
30:27
uh policing methods
30:29
and how they um they roll people up yeah
30:32
it's from the sushi tradition basically
30:34
i think someone looked at some sushi and
30:35
thought
30:36
wait a second why don't we carry massive
30:37
bits of seaweed around
30:39
what if that bit of cucumber was a
30:41
violent offender
30:43
yeah i i think it would be quite awkward
30:46
as a police officer if
30:48
for this very occasional time when you
30:50
get a violent offender because like you
30:51
say there's not many guns yeah but you
30:52
always have to carry a massive food
30:56
they are slightly smaller in japan
30:57
aren't they so futons are a big thing in
30:59
japan a lot of people sleep on futons
31:01
and they're not
31:01
like i imagine which is kind of a proper
31:03
sofa that turns into a bed kind of thing
31:05
there's
31:05
nothing like it's a roll-up yeah they're
31:06
not juveniles sorry they're more like
31:08
duvets than mattresses aren't they
31:09
basically
31:10
kind of they're pretty supportive it's a
31:12
thin mattress that you sleep on
31:14
but um do you know what else gets a
31:15
futon in japan if you want it is your
31:17
wallet
31:18
so there's a futon company yep it's a
31:21
futon company called
31:22
nakatagawa futons and they've started
31:25
making sai futons
31:26
which means wallet futon and it's made
31:29
of high quality cotton
31:30
it includes a little cover like a duvet
31:32
cover for your wallet and it includes a
31:34
pillow
31:34
for the head of your wallet whichever
31:36
end of your wallet
31:37
is the head it says it's been blessed
31:40
from priests at a shrine in tokyo
31:42
and if you want to go like if you want
31:44
to go more expensive you can order a
31:45
little bed that comes with it
31:47
i'm going to go out on the limb and say
31:48
this company is not going to last very
31:49
long
31:50
do you see the amount they charge for
31:52
these um food holes they think they cost
31:53
about 115 quid give or take
31:56
for the futon and bed is 340. so then
31:59
you've got nothing to put in your wallet
32:03
oh no it's hilarious they aren't
32:05
beautiful though look them up i mean i'd
32:06
be tempted but then i'm a sucker for
32:09
stuff like that um have you heard of the
32:12
boro
32:14
no this is a it's a legend which is uh
32:17
it's like an evil
32:18
uh spirit described as a tattered futon
32:21
that comes to life at night and it's
32:23
basically part of a group of
32:24
uh these kind of demons these spirits
32:26
called sukumogami
32:28
they're basically all household objects
32:30
that either they're possessed by spirits
32:32
or ghosts or
32:32
if you use them constantly for 90 to 100
32:34
years they eventually become sentient
32:38
and they will be they'll be fine and
32:40
they'll just kind of do like they'll
32:41
just behave like normal household
32:42
objects
32:42
unless uh if they're feeling ignored or
32:44
needless in which case
32:45
they will come to life and try to
32:47
strangle their owners and they'll float
32:48
around through the house
32:49
or they will throw noisy parties with
32:51
other members of this family
32:53
so you'll get all your household objects
32:54
having a party and they're trying to
32:55
kill you but
32:56
yeah how do you how do you stop a
32:59
violent
32:59
offender futon wrap it up with a drunk
33:03
person
33:03
[Laughter]
33:05
um so the police in north wales a few
33:07
years ago this is in 2010
33:09
they hired a troop of actors to pretend
33:11
to be drunk
33:12
did they it was to do a sting on a load
33:14
of pubs in north wales they had about 50
33:16
pubs they wanted to check and see if
33:17
they'd serve people who were obviously
33:18
inebriated
33:19
so they hired a troop of actors to dress
33:22
up as trunks and they gave them all the
33:23
clothes and costumes
33:24
like they gave them shabby jackets and
33:27
monkey trousers and shoes and they said
33:28
go in
33:29
pretend to be absolutely blind drunk and
33:31
see if you can get served wow
33:32
but then you couldn't prosecute anyone
33:34
because they're not drunk
33:35
i don't know i imagine you could arrest
33:37
on those grounds
33:38
you don't think so no i mean neither of
33:40
us has tried it
33:41
i like this used to be a landlord you
33:44
used to be a landlord for a problem
33:45
i had a personal landlord's license yeah
33:48
what is that like having a drinks
33:49
cabinet is that just in your house
33:51
personal landlords because we've all
33:52
i've got one of those it means i could
33:53
go to
33:54
any pub and be officially by law the
33:57
landlord of that pub
33:58
so about 15 years ago they changed the
34:00
law it used to be that
34:02
you the building had the license right
34:04
but then they changed it so that the
34:05
landlord had the license
34:06
the reason they did it i think is
34:07
because they had a lot of chain pubs and
34:09
stuff like that
34:10
and i used to be an accountant for a pub
34:12
company and i
34:13
did my personal license and so it meant
34:16
that if there were
34:16
like landlords on holiday i could go and
34:18
work in the pub that's the landlord
34:20
in fact i wouldn't even have to work i
34:22
could just be sat there while other
34:23
people were doing all the job but i'd be
34:24
kind of the
34:25
one responsible wow you'd be saying yeah
34:28
you can leave your ship
34:29
outside yeah put the cable down here
34:30
that's fine
34:34
that's good to know we should use that
34:35
i'm not anymore it's slapstick i mean it
34:37
lapsed
34:38
15 20 years ago it lapsed now you're a
34:40
pointless friend to us then
34:42
um they have for drunk people on the
34:44
streets of the uk they've tried drunk
34:46
time
34:46
they don't have drunk people on the
34:47
streets of the uk
34:49
they're all acting that's always my life
34:53
it's the amdram capital of the world
34:56
no they have drunk tanks now and the
34:58
idea is that you get people out of a
34:59
e and you stop clogging up ambulances
35:01
with drunk people
35:03
and they've trialled this in bristol and
35:05
i think they've trialled it in other
35:06
places as well and in 2014 for instance
35:08
over one weekend it kept 15 people out
35:10
of hospital
35:11
because what they do is they had a
35:12
mobile drunk tank which is just a lorry
35:14
which if someone's really drunk and
35:16
thinks they're really ill and collapses
35:18
you shove them in the lorry and then let
35:19
them have a nap that sounds like a party
35:21
i mean i would i know you're gonna be
35:24
putting in a lorry
35:26
i think these people might have gone
35:27
past the fun fun part of the drunk
35:29
oh that is going to be the most it's
35:31
going to be full of vomit and pierces
35:32
it's going to stink
35:33
oh my god don't really reckon they have
35:35
futons in there
35:37
everyone's rolled up in a futon actually
35:39
they are just big futons made of metal
35:41
and
35:41
it's the same principle yes i mean you
35:43
can say anything's a futon man if
35:44
something else can't yeah
35:46
this building's a futon made of bricks
35:50
excuse me i've got a complaint about
35:51
this sandwich it's just a futon made of
35:53
bread and cheese
35:56
you know you can buy um speaking of
35:58
bread and food
36:00
all that kind of stuff um you can buy a
36:02
towel which is deliberately created in
36:04
the likeness of a flour tortilla
36:07
um so you can wrap yourself up like a
36:09
burrito that's really good
36:11
and sexy too oh yeah that's weird
36:14
because the people who invented this
36:16
um they're a collective called ampersand
36:18
friends
36:19
and friends or something yeah they told
36:21
the huffington post that they were
36:22
inspired by the fantasy of being a human
36:25
burrito wow
36:26
we would if they said that we were
36:27
inspired by the collective works of
36:29
shakespeare
36:29
like it makes sense you are right of
36:32
course but
36:33
odd reading of hamlet um actually there
36:36
is a guy who's addicted to being rolled
36:37
up in
36:38
carpets yeah maybe he's part of this
36:40
collective
36:41
i think he might be the inspiration for
36:43
it he's a guy called giorgio t
36:45
he didn't want to be known by his full
36:46
name he he's in new york
36:48
and he loves rolling himself up in a
36:49
carpet and having people on him
36:51
and uh charming that's the most charming
36:53
addiction i've ever heard of rolling up
36:54
something it is quite sweet and now he
36:56
hires himself out to parties and rolls
36:58
up in the carpet and
36:59
just trample all over him he
37:00
particularly likes women and he gets
37:02
paid for them
37:02
naked does he people will pay up to 200
37:05
for him to perform
37:06
yeah i mean it's lovely isn't it when
37:08
your weird perverted fetish can turn
37:10
into your job
37:11
well if anyone would like um a burrito
37:14

00:10
[Applause]
00:14
hello and welcome back to another
00:15
episode of no such thing as a fish a
00:17
weekly podcast coming to you from the qi
00:19
offices in covent garden my name is
00:21
andrew hunter murray and i'm sitting
00:23
here with anna tajinski james harkin and
00:25
alex bell and we have gathered our
00:27
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:29
so in no particular order here we go
00:32
starting with you anna my fact this week
00:34
is that the second president of the
00:36
united states of america used to inspect
00:39
london's dung
00:41
why did john adams go around inspecting
00:43
the reason he did it he obviously was a
00:45
farmer and he was inspected obviously
00:47
obviously
00:49
he was also the president of the united
00:50
states he's most famous for his farming
00:52
days no sorry it's obvious from his
00:54
diaries that he's a farmer because he's
00:56
not from his dairies
01:02
was it sort of 25th march did some more
01:04
farming today is that what gives it away
01:06
that was my first clue yeah yeah 25th
01:09
march miltokow when all the people of
01:11
america let me get back to my farm
01:14
um he was a farmer and so he was
01:18
inspecting it to compare it to his own
01:20
dung and he pointed out so his own dunk
01:23
this is not normal behavior in a person
01:25
well andy's questioning
01:27
he's an absolute fruit loop
01:30
it's amazing that they're mentally
01:31
unstable to become president of america
01:32
that will never happen again
01:35
he was very stable man and had many
01:38
stables of his own
01:40
he inspected the dung in order to
01:42
compare it to the manure he kept on his
01:44
own farm and in fact he concluded that
01:46
the manure on the edgeware road he wrote
01:48
of it this may be good manure but it is
01:51
not equal to mine wow
01:53
yeah so he had better manure he had um
01:55
he had some manure from the boston
01:57
marshes which he he considered superior
02:00
and yeah this fact was sent in actually
02:02
by a guy called mark david who sent me
02:04
some of john adams diaries and he said
02:06
in his diary in one of my common walks
02:09
along the edgeware road there are fine
02:11
meadows belonging to a noted cow keeper
02:13
plentifully manured i have carefully
02:15
examined the manure and found it to be
02:18
composed of straw and dung from the
02:20
stables of streets of london and then he
02:21
goes through all the stuff that's in the
02:22
manure so he's really gone through it
02:23
with his hands probably getting in he
02:25
used to live up edgeware road in that
02:27
direction and it's not like that anymore
02:29
do you ever find any of john adams's
02:30
dung flying around i don't know who's it
02:32
was on your doorstep though and it was
02:34
on fire that's the main thing
02:37
it wasn't john adams his own dung just
02:39
to be clear he didn't take a poo by the
02:40
side of the road and then respect that
02:43
well what if he'd accidentally swallowed
02:45
a tooth or something and he wanted it
02:46
for his collection as hypothetical
02:48
situations go andy i don't know i think
02:50
you're most likely to swallow a tooth if
02:51
you get punched in the face and if you
02:53
were wandering around inspecting poo on
02:55
the streets of london you might
02:58
and if i got punched in the face i'd be
02:59
likely to poo myself
03:00
[Laughter]
03:03
is why i never go to boxing fights
03:06
it gets very messy
03:08
absolutely stinks in there he was a
03:10
lawyer originally before he was uh
03:12
president
03:14
i'm not sure if he was a farmer at the
03:15
same time as he was a lawyer but he was
03:16
a really bad lawyer so in his first year
03:18
he had one client and it took him three
03:20
years before he won a case in front of a
03:22
jury wow yeah i don't think it was a
03:24
really long trial either i think it was
03:25
just it took him a very long time one
03:27
thing he was a liar for was the boston
03:29
massacre wasn't it
03:31
i think quite famously that what was
03:32
that i think it was something like there
03:34
was a crowd of people and there were
03:36
some british soldiers and the crowd
03:38
started throwing snowballs at the
03:39
soldiers was it snowballs i think so and
03:41
then other stuff as well like dead
03:43
animals and stuff and then the soldiers
03:45
shot when snowball fights get out of
03:47
hand
03:48
is that a reindeer coming towards me
03:52
and then um the the british soldiers got
03:55
angry and shot them yeah which is
03:57
obviously worse than snowballs or
03:58
reindeers and they were arrested and i
04:01
think adam's got them off he did get
04:03
them off he
04:04
and not not one of them went to prison
04:06
uh thanks to his defense of them
04:08
are we saying that he was kind of partly
04:10
responsible for the american revolution
04:12
starting i think he was certainly a
04:14
player wow and he was pro-revolution as
04:16
well wasn't he he just defended the
04:19
brits because he wanted to uphold the
04:21
rule of law so he thought they had a
04:22
right to equal representation yeah good
04:24
man when he was in boston he also wrote
04:26
political theory essays for the uh
04:28
boston newspapers under the nom de bloom
04:30
humphrey plough jogger
04:32
wow
04:33
humphrey turd sifter
04:39
so jefferson was his main rival and he
04:42
fought jefferson for the title of second
04:44
president of the u.s and he won and then
04:46
jefferson beat him at the next election
04:48
and then when they both retired they
04:49
spent the rest of their lives writing
04:51
letters to each other
04:53
it should have been me
04:55
but didn't they during one of the
04:56
elections didn't they really fight like
04:58
really badly i thought jefferson called
05:00
him a hermaphrodite or something yes he
05:02
did yeah they had a really really
05:04
vicious campaign and um he actually so
05:06
jefferson accused adams of being a
05:08
hideous
05:09
character who smuggled prostitutes into
05:11
the country so he said he was smuggling
05:12
prostitutes in from england uh into
05:15
america and he said that he was planning
05:17
to marry one of the sons of king george
05:19
and he was a royalist which actually
05:22
there could be some foundation to that
05:23
because one of the things that adam's
05:25
got mocked for when he was president was
05:27
that he thought the president should be
05:29
referred to as his royal highness or
05:31
your majesty or something like that
05:33
because he pointed out the president's
05:34
you get presidents of golf clubs and
05:37
other really tedious things and it
05:38
wasn't a noble enough title yeah one of
05:40
his suggestions was his highness the
05:42
president of the united states of
05:43
america and protector of the rights of
05:45
the same
05:46
there you go
05:47
yeah um so we're talking about adams and
05:50
jefferson being friends even though they
05:51
called each other hermaphrodites and
05:52
said there were english prostitutes uh
05:55
afoot um they died on the same day
05:58
and they died on the 50th anniversary of
06:01
the signing of the declaration of
06:02
independence fourth of july um what
06:05
would it be 1826 yeah and they were both
06:07
absolutely determined to stay alive
06:08
until then
06:09
and jefferson died just after noon
06:12
and
06:13
adams
06:15
awoke
06:16
uh soon after jefferson died and though
06:19
he was in a separate place at the time
06:21
and he said with great effort thomas
06:23
jefferson survives as though at least
06:25
one of the architects of the revolution
06:26
is still alive even though he didn't
06:27
know that jefferson had already died and
06:29
then he died a few hours later and then
06:31
do you think anyone do you think there
06:32
was a really awkward pause around his
06:33
bedside when he said jefferson survived
06:36
should we tell him is it cruel
06:39
yeah i don't think i don't think he ever
06:40
knew which is nice he died thinking that
06:42
jefferson still survives today
06:44
[Laughter]
06:47
on his diary writing and his prolific uh
06:50
letter writing and diary keeping
06:51
apparently congress made fun of him
06:53
because he when he went to paris um at
06:55
one point and wrote a lot in his diary
06:56
about how uh and how great the dungeon
06:58
was yeah
07:00
how much he admired the french
07:01
aristocracy all this kind of really
07:02
effusive stuff about how great paris was
07:04
and then he sent it along with his
07:06
report of what was going on in paris to
07:07
congress possibly accidentally like
07:09
we're not sure whether it was supposed
07:11
to be part of the report diary just read
07:13
it aloud
07:16
just like a 12 year old girl well if
07:19
anyone's mom's ever read their diary
07:20
they can take solace in this probably
07:22
the worst moment of his life when he
07:24
realized that i bet he never got over
07:25
that i bet that's why he had to become
07:27
president was to erase the memory of his
07:29
diary oh god that's embarrassing what
07:31
was okay so there was nothing too
07:32
humiliating it wasn't like oh dad walked
07:35
in on me masturbating this morning must
07:37
learn to lock the door it was there was
07:38
nothing too awful in it no he said that
07:40
one french gentleman
07:42
you won't believe the prostitutes they
07:44
have here in france
07:46
i think they complimented him a lot and
07:48
one of the men called him the washington
07:49
of negotiation when he wrote that down
07:52
and he was like oh i really like him
07:53
he's so nice and that's like retweeting
07:55
praise of yourself isn't it and then
07:57
posting the retweet to congress yeah
07:59
yeah copying in congress uh we should
08:01
move on but just one quick anyone got
08:03
anything on dung or droppings yes
08:06
go on drop it in um but reynolds once
08:09
dropped a helicopter full of horse
08:10
manure on the national enquirer did he
08:13
well yeah why did he do that he uh
08:15
they'd been writing a lot of stories
08:16
about him and they weren't accurate so
08:18
he decided uh he said this i thought it
08:20
was only fitting on christmas eve my
08:22
pilot and i loaded my helicopter with
08:24
manure from my ranch flew over the
08:26
building and watched it cascade down
08:28
their giant christmas tree
08:31
isn't that amazing the children would
08:33
have probably thought he was santa claus
08:35
[Laughter]
08:37
you know there's a there was a moose
08:38
dropping festival in talkeetna in alaska
08:41
so is this for dropping mooses
08:44
but reynolds flies over the town
08:47
in a helicopter
08:49
uh
08:50
no that's but that's such a good
08:52
question james and it's exactly the same
08:53
question that confused peta the animal
08:56
rights organization so it's it was a
08:58
festival that was cancelled in 2009 but
09:00
it was basically where people used to
09:02
throw moose droppings out of helicopters
09:04
flying over the top and people took bets
09:06
on whereabouts they'd land and would be
09:07
how close they get to a target but
09:09
petter got confused and assumed that it
09:11
did involve hurling moose
09:14
from helicopters loading them into a
09:15
helicopter
09:16
coaxing the moose into an aircraft do
09:19
you think they every time they hear
09:20
about animal droppings this is just what
09:22
they issue
09:25
[Applause]
09:28
okay we should move on so it's time for
09:30
fact number two now and that is james
09:33
okay my fact this week is that you can
09:35
be blocked from getting a swiss passport
09:38
if your neighbors find you too annoying
09:41
so this has come about this is a news
09:43
article that's been uh quite recent and
09:46
it is in the canton of argo in
09:48
switzerland and there was a lady who is
09:51
a vegan and she has been complaining
09:54
about the way that cows are treated and
09:56
various different things in this area
09:58
why does this weird man keep sifting
09:59
through their manure
10:00
it's their own business
10:03
and the locals are not very happy with
10:05
her because they think that she's
10:07
invading their way of life and the rules
10:09
say that when you apply for a passport
10:11
your neighbors can give you a reference
10:13
either good or bad and they've given her
10:15
a bad reference and it's stopping her
10:17
from getting a passport and so now it
10:19
has to go to the next level so that she
10:20
can apply elsewhere yeah she's lived
10:22
there since she was eight yeah and all
10:24
her children are swiss yep but she's a
10:27
really big campaigner one of the things
10:29
she campaigns to get she does complain
10:30
against putting bells around the cow's
10:31
necks she also campaigns against piglet
10:33
racing which is a thing that happens in
10:35
switzerland i wonder if she campaigns
10:37
about cow droppings
10:38
[Laughter]
10:40
that's the thing that happens cows just
10:42
walk over cliffs in switzerland all the
10:43
time they walk off mountains and then
10:45
the other cows think oh maybe maybe
10:47
bessie found some better grass over
10:49
there and then you get like up to 40
10:50
cows at a time just plunging off cliffs
10:52
to their death you would have thought
10:54
the smart thing for her neighbors to do
10:55
would be to give her a really glowing
10:56
reference and ensure that she does does
10:58
have the ability to leave the country
11:00
wouldn't it you're right
11:02
because having a passport
11:04
means that you immediately are forced to
11:05
emigrate i think it does allow you to
11:07
leave though doesn't it that's the thing
11:09
exactly that's true yeah i think
11:11
actually she does have a passport for
11:12
another country her nationality is dutch
11:14
she must have a dutch passport and she's
11:16
yeah she's got children there so she can
11:17
remain it's weird though the law in
11:18
switzerland is that uh in order to apply
11:21
for a passport you have to first become
11:22
a resident of your local town basically
11:25
it's called uh hematot
11:31
yeah so all the foreign nationals have
11:33
to uh become a citizen of the town they
11:34
were living in and they have to live
11:35
there for at least 12 years and then up
11:37
until 2003 the whole town could vote on
11:41
whether they become new citizens or not
11:42
and would vote on whether someone could
11:44
become a new citizen yeah absolutely so
11:45
a whole town would vote on it and so
11:46
until 2003 it was everyone in the town
11:49
then they realized actually people were
11:50
just being a bit racist because they
11:51
didn't actually know these people they
11:52
would just make a judgement based on
11:54
which country they came from so they
11:55
changed the law so it's then a sort of
11:57
committee when you get references from
11:58
people who know them and they're judged
12:00
specifically on them as a person but it
12:02
still means it's really difficult to get
12:03
into there was a family in 2006 a family
12:06
from kosovo was denied citizenship
12:07
because one of the reasons was that they
12:09
dressed inappropriately because they
12:10
were too many track suits around town
12:12
and the other one is that they didn't
12:13
systematically greet people passing them
12:15
on the streets
12:16
now that is a weird thing so if you go
12:18
to a party in switzerland when you
12:20
arrive you have to go around the room
12:21
saying hello and shaking hands with
12:23
everybody else at the party so there's a
12:24
huge incentive to arrive on time because
12:26
if you get there on time everyone comes
12:27
up to you and says hello and you don't
12:29
have to go around saying actually you
12:30
want to go early don't you really yeah
12:32
so there's this kind of game theory
12:34
going on about
12:35
what time do you arrive yeah i would
12:38
actually rather get there late because
12:39
if you arrive first then that means all
12:42
your conversations are going to be
12:42
interrupted by the next arrival coming
12:44
up and shaking your hand whereas if you
12:45
arrive last you get all the handshakes
12:47
out the way immediately and you can get
12:48
on with your conversations in peace
12:50
that's my top tip for swiss people out
12:52
there it's very good yeah thank you this
12:54
one this woman who's been rejected she's
12:55
writing a book and the title of it is
12:57
selkie nev or the lady who annoys
13:00
[Laughter]
13:02
so she's embracing it that's nice yeah
13:04
great about the cowbells though like
13:07
they do they are incredibly loud i think
13:09
that is right it's like there are like
13:10
100 decibels aren't they yeah and it's
13:13
around your neck the whole time you
13:14
can't get away with it i just jump off a
13:16
cliff
13:17
and i'd follow you
13:21
just on passports there was a
13:23
nine-year-old girl who recently got into
13:26
turkey on a toy passport
13:29
uh this was in it was in 2013 and she
13:32
was from wales and she had her own
13:35
passport she was traveling with her
13:36
parents but she also had the passport
13:38
that belonged to her teddy bear unicorn
13:40
uh her soft toy unicorn and her mum
13:43
accidentally pulled that out instead
13:44
handed it over to the authorities who
13:46
julie stamped it and let her in it must
13:47
have been roughly the same size and
13:49
shape and color as a normal passport
13:51
which is quite a well they've got a
13:52
unicorn on the front anyway british
13:54
passports actually
13:58
oh my god i didn't know we had royalty
14:00
visiting
14:01
[Laughter]
14:05
can we quickly talk about how until
14:06
really recently switzerland was rigged
14:08
to explode if an army invaded yes i
14:10
think we can because that's gonna need a
14:11
lot of justification
14:13
so um since the second world war muslims
14:16
have had a really um stringent plan for
14:19
what would happen if they're invaded
14:20
because they're a famously neutral
14:21
country the main kind of plan is for
14:23
everyone in switzerland to withdraw from
14:25
the cities and fight a guerrilla war
14:27
from the alps if an army was to invade
14:29
and all of the tunnels through the
14:30
mountains and all the bridges were all
14:32
rigged with explosives so that they
14:34
could be blown up and it would be very
14:35
difficult to get around the country very
14:36
difficult to get into the country in the
14:38
mountains and they have all sorts of
14:39
other plans like they have enough
14:41
nuclear bunkers for every citizen of
14:43
switzerland so presumably this woman is
14:46
going to be the only person who has
14:47
nowhere to go
14:49
passport please i've got this unicorn
14:54
[Applause]
14:57
okay we better move on it's time for
14:59
fact number three and that is my fact my
15:01
fact is that there are people in the
15:03
houses of parliament constantly looking
15:05
for fire
15:06
you you phrase that like they're smokers
15:08
and they're like don't have a like
15:10
there are 24 fires patrol officers who
15:12
go around the house of parliament they
15:13
do it in shifts obviously and the palace
15:15
of westminster is basically only able to
15:17
be used because they're working so if
15:19
they weren't there then the building
15:20
would not comply with a 2005 fire safety
15:23
order so they are easily the 24 most
15:25
important people in the houses of
15:27
parliament so you say that the fire
15:29
people have had to be installed because
15:30
of this 2005 piece of health and safety
15:32
recognition i do say that you do say
15:35
that and yet
15:37
i think that no here we go effectively
15:40
crown properties are exempt from health
15:42
and safety regulations so they still
15:44
have to abide by them but you can't
15:47
prosecute the crown properties for not
15:49
abiding by them the only thing you can
15:51
do is censure them
15:52
so if they don't abide by these rules it
15:55
goes to this incredibly long process
15:56
that you would go through usually where
15:58
someone else might go to prison at the
15:59
end or be arrested or fined but with the
16:01
crown they just get a formal censure wow
16:04
basically this is about how shocky the
16:06
houses of parliament are they're falling
16:08
to bits they really are yeah there was a
16:10
report in 2012 that said if it wasn't
16:12
building uh they'd recommend demolishing
16:14
it and starting again
16:15
yeah
16:16
wow do they often find fires in their
16:19
hand they do yeah do they so there have
16:21
been 60 incidents since 2008 which have
16:23
had the potential to cause a serious
16:25
fire yeah so that is completely insane
16:27
how incompetent are the people in the
16:28
houses of parliament no need to answer
16:30
that
16:31
[Laughter]
16:33
um well this is just a very old building
16:34
and there are lots of bits which are
16:35
kind of fire hazards and which you know
16:37
it's a huge place as well there's a lot
16:39
of kind of it was built obviously before
16:41
electricity so the wires are all kind of
16:43
botched into where all the yeah
16:46
and there's loads of basically nothing
16:47
gets uninstalled so anytime old wiring
16:50
is replaced they don't take out the old
16:52
wiring so there's just tons of flammable
16:53
material sitting there and there's loads
16:55
of asbestos i mean that's not flammable
16:57
but there's like no but
16:58
it's sort of everywhere it's not just in
16:59
the walls like there's asbestos inside
17:00
the light switches and things like that
17:02
they just shoved it in absolutely
17:03
everywhere everywhere
17:04
of the of the 3000 windows in the palace
17:06
of westminster nearly all of them don't
17:08
close properly
17:12
so badly built i guess does that mean if
17:14
there's a fire yeah more air will get in
17:16
i suppose to make the fire worse and i
17:18
think the shutters don't open properly
17:19
the windows don't close and the shutters
17:20
don't open because i think they built
17:22
radiators i was reading the report on
17:24
why it needs redoing and one of the
17:26
things and it said that they built
17:26
radiators in the nooks that are supposed
17:28
to house the shutters at some point so
17:30
now when you try to open the shutters
17:31
there's a radiator in the way wow um
17:33
sometimes mps miss votes because they
17:35
get stuck in lifts
17:36
do they really well it's happened at
17:38
least once yeah i don't know when i say
17:40
sometimes i mean one time the
17:42
legislation only passed by seven votes
17:44
and so if there was like a chance of if
17:46
more people couldn't get there i mean if
17:48
they'd all been in that lane
17:51
i used to work for an msp in scotland
17:53
and he once pressed the wrong button on
17:54
his voting thing and voted the wrong way
17:56
in a vote that came down to one vote
18:00
[Laughter]
18:03
and then what terrible law passed
18:05
because of that um so scottish
18:08
independence upcoming that's all him
18:12
no it was about green energy i think i
18:14
once worked in the houses of parliament
18:15
for a while and um on my first day uh
18:17
someone came into the office i was
18:18
working and took off his shoe and threw
18:20
a mouse in the corner because they have
18:21
a really bad mass problem really yeah
18:24
wow
18:25
oh hi i'm usually cartoon-based
18:29
according to mp ben bradshaw um there is
18:32
urine leaking uh in the house of
18:35
parliament specifically into his office
18:37
a couple of years ago he tweeted that
18:39
urine seems to be pouring through the
18:41
ceiling into my commons office for the
18:43
second day running there was some piping
18:45
with holes in it in the in the room
18:47
above him
18:49
and the smell was only made bearable by
18:51
his staff wearing strong perfume
18:56
um apparently the roof of the hall of
18:59
westminster
19:00
they're aren't really sure why it's
19:03
still up because they thought that it
19:05
was originally built with columns
19:06
because at the time during the 13th and
19:08
14th century we didn't think that they
19:10
had the technology to make a roof that
19:11
was wider than the beams it was made of
19:14
and it doesn't have columns anymore but
19:15
they recently had a look at it and they
19:17
think that there were never any columns
19:18
so they're unsure as to why it's up
19:20
there and how it's staying up is this
19:22
going to be like in a cartoon when the
19:24
building realizes that it's going to be
19:26
standing out freewheeling in the air for
19:27
a bit and then yeah that's so weird i
19:30
know so just on fire safety has anyone
19:33
seen the fire safety slide that's been
19:35
installed in shanghai
19:37
so it's basically like a slide you see
19:38
in a playground and it goes around the
19:40
stairwell and when it's not in use then
19:43
it's up vertically kind of attached to
19:45
the the banisters why is it not in use
19:48
who yeah who what's the spiral slide in
19:50
a massive building and thinks oh we
19:52
won't bother using this james this is
19:54
not for the purposes of recreation it's
19:56
a health and safety issue the only time
19:58
you would ever want to use the slide is
20:00
in a case of a fire in which case it
20:01
takes 14 seconds to descend the five
20:03
stories that is so cool is there a
20:05
penalty for improper use
20:08
but that is really 14
20:10
14 seconds for five stories well i was
20:12
trying to work out i reckon i could run
20:13
downstairs in less than absolutely
20:17
three seconds per story
20:19
oh i don't know i take four stairs at a
20:22
time i can do it i think you could fall
20:24
that distance from that time
20:27
[Applause]
20:30
okay it's time for a final fact of the
20:32
show and that is alex my fact this week
20:34
is that the cookie monster isn't allowed
20:36
to eat cookies
20:39
since his diabetes diagnosis
20:41
no why not uh he because well he cookies
20:44
are actually bad for the fabric that he
20:46
is made out of so he actually eats rice
20:48
cakes disguised to look like cookies in
20:49
disguise yeah i think he knows but um
20:53
yeah but it would be quite a powerful
20:54
message about childhood healthy eating
20:56
if he did eat cookies and slowly saw his
20:58
skin degrading and rotting away over the
21:01
next six months of the show no what to
21:03
teach children that if you eat too many
21:04
cookies your fur will fall off yeah
21:07
i've never actually seen it but they
21:08
obviously obviously are supposed to be
21:09
educational aren't they and they're good
21:11
at dealing with the hard-hitting issues
21:13
i think they're covering the trump
21:14
election as we speak they did have a
21:16
character called donald grump
21:18
so good yeah yeah based on donald trump
21:21
and it was when the apprentice first
21:22
became popular
21:24
and he was a muppet with a bright orange
21:27
quaffer
21:28
who had the most trash of any grouch in
21:30
the world and he had his name on every
21:32
piece of trash in town
21:35
he was played by oscar the grouch and
21:37
he's like i have more trash than you get
21:39
it i don't know who oscar the grouch is
21:41
all right he's the guy who lives in the
21:42
bin he's really grumpy
21:45
but everyone else knows you're awesome
21:47
yeah it's true actually oscar the grouch
21:48
is quite uh even if you've never seen it
21:50
i'm surprised you've never come across
21:52
him yeah come across big bird yep so
21:53
i've heard of big bird and i've heard of
21:54
elmo and i've heard of bert and ernie
21:56
but that's only because they're
21:57
referenced in friends which i have seen
21:58
and you must know the cookie monster as
22:00
well i think i thought that was the same
22:01
as big brother he's appeared on every
22:03
like he's used night he's appeared on
22:04
bbc breakfast he's done more political
22:06
shows than most people in this country
22:07
jeremy carbon
22:10
it took a long time for us to get into
22:11
jeremy corbyn shy
22:13
puppets don't have a sexual orientation
22:14
and sesame street had to make that clear
22:17
because apparently there are lots of
22:18
rumors that bert and ernie are a gay
22:19
couple because they share a bed
22:21
oh right okay so i can see where those
22:22
rumors came from okay so there were
22:24
rumors about that and they said they're
22:26
just friends and puppets don't have a
22:28
sexual orientation
22:29
they're puppets they don't exist below
22:30
the waist they only have a top half you
22:32
know big bird exists below the weight
22:33
yeah i've seen but he's not poppies and
22:35
i guess
22:36
unless he belongs to the three percent
22:37
of birds that do have a penis
22:40
big bird will have a cloaker which he
22:42
will press against the cloaker of other
22:44
big birds they are educational
22:46
presumably they've discussed the cloak
22:47
of big bird at some point in the show so
22:49
big bird is flightless and isn't it true
22:51
i read someone said this week that um
22:54
flightless birds have a bladder is that
22:57
right flightless the only bird with the
22:59
bladder is the ostrich
23:01
and that's because bladders are heavy
23:04
and like birds can't normally have them
23:06
because it would weigh them down yes but
23:08
big bird could possibly have a bladder
23:10
he could have a blood has anyone ever
23:11
seen him wee
23:12
[Laughter]
23:20
isn't elmo the only non-human to testify
23:23
in a court of law where did the
23:25
defendant tickle you
23:26
[Laughter]
23:27
no it was during a campaign for
23:29
increased funding for music programs and
23:30
he testified that there should be and
23:33
indeed that does he sing is he involved
23:35
does he see in musicals yeah
23:37
yeah they all sing
23:38
nice thing so there's a list of um
23:41
puppets that have been in sesame street
23:43
and muppets as well but there's a list
23:45
and um there was one called anna
23:48
hey
23:49
this was in the spanish version of
23:50
sesame street and it says that anna had
23:52
a know-it-all attitude wow
23:56
based on me i'm not gonna lie
23:58
but it's a justified attitude isn't it
24:01
uh alex bell there was one called belle
24:03
who was in the brazilian co-production
24:06
of sesame street and belle was an
24:08
imaginative hot pink monster girl sounds
24:11
about right that's my online profile
24:13
[Laughter]
24:15
and there was one called murray monster
24:17
was there yeah and he was the host of
24:19
the word on the street segment and he
24:21
was a boisterous red orange muppet
24:25
in the nigerian version of sesame street
24:26
the star muppet is called kami and kami
24:29
is hiv positive to remove the stigma of
24:32
wow we're talking about um wow dealing
24:34
with the heartache issues yeah that's so
24:36
good i know
24:38
um another responsible thing they do is
24:39
they make a whole separate program
24:41
called talk listen connect and it's for
24:42
children with parents in the military
24:44
and um they broadcast that to them to
24:46
teach them about how much they're gonna
24:48
miss their parents and how it's okay and
24:49
how for instance like amputees coming
24:51
back from war zones their children might
24:53
be a bit traumatized by seeing that and
24:55
so there was a lovely story of a father
24:57
who came back from afghanistan i think
24:59
and he'd had three of his limbs
25:00
amputated and he was really worried and
25:01
they showed him the sesame street video
25:04
that had been made to educate his
25:05
children about his condition and he
25:07
burst into tears apparently he was so
25:09
happy that he had a good way of
25:11
communicating it to his child oh my
25:12
goodness
25:13
some of the muppets are actually made of
25:15
army surplus material i watched my
25:17
documentary ages ago and i just
25:18
remembered it the cookie monster has a
25:20
british cousin really called
25:22
um the biscuit bastard
25:28
you are half right oh really it's the
25:30
biscuit monster oh okay
25:33
let's get bastard because that could
25:34
educate children about how it's okay if
25:35
your parents aren't married
25:42
that's hilarious does he does he
25:44
actually feature on the american show
25:45
then uh he's only in one episode where
25:47
he came to visit the cookie monster
25:50
okay yeah uh he was on holiday tried to
25:52
get himself a job as donald grump's
25:55
representative
26:01
we could talk about biscuits but do you
26:03
think we're i can i just say one thing
26:05
about biscuits then yeah yeah dunking
26:07
biscuits
26:08
was originally done in wine
26:10
um the first evidence we have of biscuit
26:12
dunking was wafers that the romans
26:14
softened in um wine oh wow
26:17
and before dunking and tea even there
26:19
was dunking in beer because in the royal
26:22
navy you would have hard tack biscuits
26:24
that were really really hard and you
26:25
couldn't eat them very well so people
26:26
would dunk them in their beer to soften
26:28
them up
26:29
that's very interesting
26:31
that remember you are you have to dunk
26:32
your wafer in your wine at church during
26:34
community you're not no
26:36
the idea of putting wafers directly into
26:39
people's mouths yeah
26:40
that came because they were worried that
26:42
people would take them in their hands
26:44
hide them away and use them for magic
26:46
potions i thought you're gonna say use
26:47
them slowly over time build their own
26:49
christ at home
26:54
um i was reading about simon pope who's
26:56
a biscuit designer and tester and so
26:59
best job in the world
27:02
it's honestly his job so his job
27:03
includes eating
27:05
tasting biscuits from 472 packets of
27:07
biscuits every year so he says he tastes
27:09
30 biscuits a day
27:11
he says he often doesn't swallow them
27:13
because i guess for health reasons so he
27:16
says he'll nibble on them to check for
27:17
things like taste texture and firmness
27:19
he says he sometimes does have biscuits
27:20
at work because it's important to test
27:22
them in situ
27:24
i need to test this batch in las vegas
27:26
i'm afraid
27:27
[Laughter]
27:31
travel expenses are enormous
27:35
he's in the plane he's got a seat next
27:37
to him which just has a packet of
27:38
biscuits on it
27:40
always going around the world hobnobbing
27:42
[Laughter]
27:46
i think we might be done
27:49

00:51
hello and welcome to no such thing as a
00:53
fish a weekly podcast coming to you from
00:55
the qi offices in
00:57
covent garden my name is anna and i am
01:00
here with andrew hunter murray james
01:01
harkin and ann
01:03
miller once again we've gathered around
01:05
the microphones with our four
01:06
favorite maps that we found in the last
01:08
seven days and in no particular order
01:10
here we go starting with you james
01:14
my fact this week is that anna wants to
01:16
be like with donna
01:17
and known by just one name
01:21
what was that all about did i i couldn't
01:23
work out if normally we do two names or
01:25
one so i mixed it up i thought it was
01:26
casual and friendly
01:27
like done enough podcasts i thought it
01:29
was power mad
01:30
[Laughter]
01:31
i thought it was maybe that you couldn't
01:33
work out how to pronounce your own
01:34
surname
01:36
it might have been that dan's confused
01:38
me over the years i'd like to be known
01:40
as lightning from now on on this podcast
01:42
please
01:42
all right you've already got three so
01:44
i'll introduce you all again
01:46
my name is anna and i'm joined by
01:48
lightning james and anne
01:52
okay uh my fact this week is that in
01:54
1758 there were two camels on display in
01:57
london
01:58
one with a single hump and one with two
02:00
humps they were advertised as
02:02
the surprising camel and the wonderful
02:05
camel
02:08
i think that i think the one with the
02:10
single hump
02:11
was surprising and the one with two
02:13
humps was wonderful
02:14
i think they're all surprising to start
02:16
off with and then a difference in humps
02:18
is also surprising
02:19
so i think they're both surprising are
02:21
they they're both wonderful
02:22
yeah let's not do camels down i agree
02:24
with lightning
02:27
i read this in the london review of
02:29
books and it was
02:30
a review of a book called menagerie by
02:33
caroline grigson
02:34
i haven't read that book yet but i am
02:36
going to read it because it looks
02:37
amazing there's some
02:38
really good facts in that review i read
02:40
a really good book about the history of
02:41
london zoo a couple years ago
02:43
my favorite thing in the whole book was
02:44
that london zoo used to be at the tower
02:46
of london and when it was there
02:47
you could get in for free if you brought
02:48
a dog or a cat to feed to the lions
02:51
nice was it entry for one or was it for
02:53
a family or did you have to bring
02:54
kittens if you wanted your children to
02:56
go and see the lions i think if you were
02:57
bringing a family you had to bring a
02:58
surprising camel
02:59
[Laughter]
03:01
so one other thing that i saw because um
03:03
yeah that book does look incredible
03:04
doesn't it and one other thing that i
03:06
really like that she spotted
03:07
is that this was in the age where it was
03:10
very fashionable if you're a wealthy
03:11
person to bring back lots of exotic
03:12
animals from various places or to send
03:14
agents off to get them and apparently
03:16
one london merchant asked his agent to
03:18
send him
03:19
two or three apes but he forgot the r
03:23
on or and so he was delivered two
03:25
hundred and three eighths
03:27
where did he put them i don't know
03:30
apparently a first cargo of 80 apes
03:32
arrived with the letter promising the
03:34
more which is
03:35
wow there was one other thing in there
03:37
that um george the fourth had a giraffe
03:39
at windsor uh and the giraffe didn't
03:42
flourish
03:42
very well because it was in windsor and
03:44
not where it's supposed to live
03:47
[Laughter]
03:50
and when it got sick uh they put it down
03:52
to sympathy for the king's gout
03:55
what a load of pr nonsense sympathy for
03:58
the
03:58
outrageous you can say that or in an
04:01
alternative fact universe you can say
04:03
that maybe
04:04
you know it was feeling sad because the
04:05
king was sad maybe it was sad
04:07
do you know they have camel wrestling
04:08
festivals in turkey is that camels
04:10
wrestling against each other
04:12
it is camels wrestling against each
04:13
other yeah but how does a camera
04:15
yeah they're on all fours well with
04:17
great difficulty
04:18
this is the one joke um they i don't
04:21
know if it is with camels but often they
04:23
do it by showing
04:24
the two combatants a sexy lady insert
04:26
animal here so they might bring on a
04:28
sexy lady camel and then they then
04:30
remove it and then the two blokes remain
04:32
and say well i wanna well i wanna
04:33
little do they know they're not gonna
04:34
get her do you know what constitutes a
04:36
beautiful camel since you mentioned a
04:38
sexy lady long eyelashes eyelashes
04:41
they do have lots of eyelashes although
04:42
maybe in the camel world because that's
04:44
so common than short eyelashes lovely
04:45
lady humps
04:49
um so i've been reading about oman
04:51
lately because we were searching for the
04:52
o series and they have camel beauty
04:54
contests in oman
04:55
and they're put on by the government and
04:57
it's a milking and beauty contest
04:59
and a beautiful camel apparently should
05:02
have a well-proportioned body and face
05:04
a long gar rib which is the area between
05:07
the hump and the neck
05:09
a clear and huge hump uh
05:12
it needs to have this was written by men
05:14
wasn't it
05:16
firm ears and pouty lips uh big whiskers
05:20
and a fur shimmer right uh yeah and he's
05:24
good
05:24
posture and it needs to be huge
05:28
that kind of makes sense all that stuff
05:29
that sounds quite attractive isn't it
05:31
is it of both sexes as in do male camels
05:34
compete against female camels it just
05:35
has to be a beautiful camel yes
05:38
yeah i don't think you can tell a male
05:40
owned female camel apart by looking
05:42
i i bet you can it depends where you're
05:44
looking
05:47
in the 18th century there was a
05:48
collection of camels on display on the
05:50
strand just around the corner from
05:52
us so it was at the tolbert inn in the
05:53
strand and it belonged to a man called
05:55
richard heppenstahl
05:56
and so that's exactly where old witch
05:58
tube station used to be which i think is
05:59
just
06:01
he tried to lure women in to view his
06:03
herd of camels because at the time women
06:05
were afraid they would be a bit dirty
06:06
and a bit spitty and a bit smelly
06:08
um so he advertised them as having
06:11
breath as sweet as a sows
06:13
which is weird because i didn't think of
06:14
salsas having particularly sweet breath
06:16
but um apparently soon afterwards there
06:18
was a journal article or a newspaper
06:20
article that reported that the ladies
06:22
are especially charmed by the camels and
06:24
expressed great satisfaction at the
06:25
sweetness of their breath
06:27
see that's quite high risk because i
06:28
read that when a camel spits at you it's
06:30
also kind of bombing at you because the
06:31
content of their stomach comes up as
06:33
well it's not a spit is it
06:34
yeah so we go oh it's just spitting no
06:37
maybe that's what generates such sweet
06:38
breath though
06:40
do you know what you could get from a
06:41
camel if it's bad at you a
06:43
cold because one of the four common cold
06:46
viruses originated in camels
06:48
no yes yeah and spread to humans this is
06:50
according to the german center for
06:52
infection research
06:53
yeah and there are four uh global uh
06:56
human they're called coronaviruses and
06:58
there are also
06:58
things called rhinoviruses rhino meaning
07:00
nose they come from rhinos
07:03
[Laughter]
07:06
and so one of these one of these main
07:07
ones apparently has made its way over
07:08
from camels a long time ago i don't know
07:10
if you could still get the same virus
07:12
inhabiting both or whether it's come
07:14
over and now it's only humans not sure
07:16
wow still i didn't know that a thirsty
07:18
camel can drink as many as 30 gallons of
07:21
water in 13 minutes
07:23
okay which sounds impressive but i
07:25
worked it out and that's 3.25 seconds
07:28
per pint
07:29
and i can drink a pint in less than
07:30
three seconds right so i can drink
07:32
faster than a camel
07:34
it's short and long furlongs though
07:35
isn't it
07:37
well i would be ahead after the first
07:39
pipe but then by
07:41
probably halfway through 0.2 it might
07:42
overtake me
07:44
and then by pint 240 i'd probably
07:48
be struggling a little bit so you just
07:50
have to pick your race when you're
07:51
challenging the camel to the drinking
07:52
contest
07:53
so when you say to the camel i want a
07:55
drinking contest and he says okay let's
07:57
do 240 pints
07:59
well let's start at one and see how we
08:00
go and don't do double our quits on the
08:03
next 239
08:06
i didn't realize that there are three
08:08
kinds of camel i thought drama derain
08:09
battering were the only kinds
08:11
but the wild bacterians probably are
08:12
have different chromosomes got three
08:14
hundreds
08:16
they yeah they felt they did a dna
08:17
sequencing on it and it's a different
08:18
species wow
08:20
so we've mentioned before that saudi
08:21
arabia imports camels from australia
08:24
because for meat but actually now have
08:25
you heard that they're trying to rescue
08:27
camels from australia
08:28
so australia's got too many camels
08:30
apparently they're becoming a bit of a
08:31
pest and
08:32
they were threatening to cull i think 6
08:34
000 camels
08:35
a few years ago and there was a big
08:37
campaign set up in saudi arabia an
08:38
internet campaign saying
08:40
send the camels to us instead and we'll
08:41
look after them yeah but
08:43
australia has a million feral camels so
08:45
six thousand is pretty small beer
08:47
actually yeah
08:47
i think we've said before they shoot
08:48
them from helicopters yeah they do
08:50
apparently one i think
08:51
this was in the australian apparently
08:53
camels in australia smash water tanks
08:55
destroy offenses
08:56
come up to houses and antagonize people
08:59
i don't know how a camel and i'm just
09:01
trying to blend it
09:08
[Music]
09:09
okay on to fact number two and that is
09:13
andy's back it's lightning's fact i
09:14
think you'll find
09:17
okay my fact is that before they are
09:18
launched london sends all its trains to
09:21
austria to be beaten up
09:24
so there's this wind tunnel which is
09:26
called the rail tech arsenal
09:27
there's a huge article on wired about
09:29
them recently and the article describes
09:30
them as trained torture chambers
09:32
so you can put a whole 330 foot long
09:34
train in this tunnel
09:35
and then they basically simulate extreme
09:37
weather conditions and see how the
09:38
carriages
09:39
stand up to it so you can see what it'll
09:41
be like for passengers
09:42
if the train gets stuck in boiling sun
09:44
or snow or
09:46
huge wind conditions that must be very
09:48
confusing for the train because normally
09:49
when he goes in the tunnel there's no
09:51
weather
09:51
[Laughter]
09:54
it's like a thomas getting up by
09:57
the cia
09:59
are we in danger of anthropomorphising
10:00
trains a little bit they shouldn't draw
10:02
those faces on the front should they
10:04
um yeah they do simulate conditions that
10:07
they wouldn't
10:07
necessarily come across in this country
10:09
don't they don't they go down to
10:10
ridiculously low and high temperatures
10:12
well the london ones they only test to
10:13
minus
10:14
13 celsius which is very would be very
10:17
low for london but
10:18
they can set it to uh minus 50
10:21
fahrenheit what would that be
10:23
is that's cold that's really cold um
10:26
so trains from kazakhstan uh get sent
10:29
there as well and they'll have
10:30
lower temperatures probably everyone's
10:31
trains go to this tunnel loads like
10:33
germany america kazakhstan saudi arabia
10:36
they all it's the article describes it
10:37
as the eaton college of the train
10:39
testing world
10:40
where you get beaten up correct yeah you
10:43
shove the train in the
10:45
you think if all the trains have to go
10:47
through this tunnel wouldn't it make
10:48
sense for all the trained factories to
10:49
be in vienna
10:51
yeah i guess it would but we've got i
10:52
guess once you've built a train factory
10:54
in derby
10:55
and how do you reckon they go are they
10:57
allowed to go on the train tracks to get
10:59
to the tunnel or they have to go on a
11:00
lorry because they're not past safety
11:02
yeah i think they get boated over
11:04
they do they get seven votes yeah yeah
11:07
you get um trains which you can put cars
11:09
on don't you
11:10
i think we have one or two of those in
11:11
britain but you get them especially
11:12
abroad are you suggesting i think i was
11:14
in the eurostar
11:15
i would just love to have a um a car
11:18
on a train on a boat and i'd probably
11:21
put like a bike rack on there as well
11:22
[Laughter]
11:24
also they've got um i think it was in
11:26
the news this week or last week we've
11:27
finally
11:28
got a direct train service from britain
11:30
to china i don't know why i say finally
11:31
like we've all been desperately wasting
11:33
we've all been still on the platform
11:34
right over here any minute
11:39
but yeah i think that's amazing it takes
11:41
18 days it's a freight train so you have
11:43
to be a piece of freight
11:45
you're a piece of freight right but
11:48
it goes to yiwu which is in east china
11:51
and that's the place that provides 60 of
11:53
the world's christmas decorations and so
11:55
i think it's like the new santa's slate
11:57
and it goes direct from china to london
11:59
but that has to actually be lifted from
12:01
one track to the other sometimes because
12:02
different countries have different
12:04
gauges
12:05
just on train testing do you know what
12:06
the new measurement train is
12:08
no no this is this train that's
12:10
constantly in operation around the
12:12
country and it's to test all the tracks
12:14
and it runs 125 miles an hour and it has
12:16
various means of testing the track so
12:17
there are no passengers on it
12:19
um it was made in response to hatfield
12:21
so that was the year 2000 wasn't it and
12:24
but it's got this amazing technology so
12:26
it can test tracks as people would have
12:28
to at walking pace but at 125 miles an
12:30
hour by for instance firing lasers at
12:32
them
12:32
and it measures contact with the rails
12:34
and it measures the electrical supply
12:36
and you know in some places you need to
12:38
have a tilt on trains it
12:39
checks uh that the tilt isn't too much
12:41
so it won't crash into a cliff next to
12:43
it or something
12:44
and these are go running around the
12:45
country at all times so there are 100
12:47
mile an hour trains going around the
12:48
country firing lasers at things
12:50
correct they're really cool yeah have
12:53
you heard
12:54
about operation smash hit uh is it about
12:57
1970s pop stars
13:00
it's very well known
13:04
um no it was an experiment they did in
13:06
1984 in july
13:08
by the british central electricity
13:09
generating board and what they did was
13:11
they got a train and they set it to
13:13
smash at 100 miles an hour into a flask
13:16
of nuclear waste
13:17
what a flask and they televised this
13:20
flask of nuclear weapons yeah so they
13:21
had these new
13:22
ways of storing nuclear material
13:24
hazardous material in these flasks right
13:26
and very strongly built
13:27
flasks and they set one of these up on a
13:29
track and they sort of wedged it into
13:31
concrete and this is an old bit of
13:32
testing track they didn't need to use
13:33
anymore and they got an
13:34
old train they didn't need and they set
13:36
it going at a hundred miles an hour
13:38
and then they they put it on tv millions
13:40
of people watched it all around the
13:41
world
13:42
and it was to show how safe these
13:43
nuclear flasks were because it didn't
13:45
break
13:46
barely lost any of its pressure at all
13:48
it was and
13:49
this was the final of a series of
13:51
experiments they did where they like
13:52
engulfed them in flames these flasks and
13:54
they dropped them from a big height
13:55
amazing and they did like all these
13:57
looney tunes experiments just to show
13:59
you cannot break into these it was to
14:00
reassure the public there's high risk
14:01
though because if
14:02
one of those goes wrong sorry we just
14:04
wiped out the country
14:05
so france has had problems with trains
14:08
lately
14:08
and i think it's important that we smash
14:10
the myth that france is the trained king
14:11
of europe because in 2014
14:15
finally yeah come on then so who is the
14:18
king of
14:19
trains the train king of europe well i
14:22
think we should enter ourselves into the
14:23
contest because france is out right in
14:25
2014
14:26
i think we've mentioned before they made
14:28
those trains that are too wide for their
14:29
stations do you remember so
14:31
yeah they built they spent billions it's
14:33
pretty embarrassing for the train king
14:34
of europe
14:37
so this was they'd spent 15 billion
14:39
euros on these trains they were too wide
14:40
so they had to amend
14:42
thousands of platforms across france so
14:44
they fitted them and then the following
14:46
year
14:46
they made trains that are too tall to
14:48
get through tunnels to take them into
14:50
italy
14:51
wow so who's going to be your new train
14:52
king of europe anna well like i say i
14:54
think we're in with the shop guys
14:55
i would have thought switzerland but i
14:56
was on a train in switzerland last week
14:58
and it
14:58
got cancelled and i had to walk across
15:01
to another platform yeah you wouldn't
15:02
think that in switzerland would you
15:05
for me they were always the trained
15:07
prince of europe
15:09
i have a nomination i nominate sweden
15:11
because i went to stockholm a few years
15:13
ago and
15:13
the train there was so amazing it was um
15:16
really lovely it felt like first class
15:18
standard glass and i had to sign up
15:19
saying if you're more than two minutes
15:20
late we'll refund you in full
15:22
two minutes wow that was the airport
15:24
express train but that was a pretty
15:26
good deal so i nominate sweden for
15:28
training
15:29
okay look these nominations have all
15:30
been accepted and will be julie
15:32
constance
15:32
i'm a trained republican i think we
15:34
should put all the trains
15:36
in a shed
15:36
[Laughter]
15:39
we should move on quite soon has anyone
15:40
got anything else so in vienna
15:42
also in austria um they had an escalator
15:45
reopening
15:46
in 2015 and 14 000 people
15:49
um signed up to turn up to this
15:51
reopening of an escalator um in the end
15:54
a good few hundred people turned up and
15:57
the party just got out of hand
15:59
and police had to be called to um calm
16:01
the crowd down
16:02
did someone would say well that
16:03
escalated quickly
16:09
[Music]
16:10
okay moving on to fact number three and
16:13
that
16:13
is and facts my fact is that the oil
16:16
company shell used to sell shells
16:20
and it's not a coincidence the name and
16:22
the selling of the shelves or the two
16:24
things related
16:24
they were different generations so
16:27
marcus samuel in 1833 started had an
16:29
antiques business and started selling
16:31
seashells
16:32
and then they got very popular they
16:34
started having these trading rates for
16:35
import export all over the world
16:36
and then his son marcus samuel jr
16:39
expanded the business
16:40
different goods and then ended up doing
16:42
oil oil is more lucrative than shell
16:44
selling isn't it
16:45
i guess they clocked onto that bit
16:47
riskier though
16:49
yes for the world yeah yeah i think so
16:52
but also
16:53
you can't power a massive industrial
16:54
economy just grinding up seashells
16:56
so i'm glad actually seashells used to
16:59
be used as currency
17:00
um many many years ago not
17:04
here not in britain no that before
17:05
britain existed like i'm talking about
17:08
thousands of years ago i think there
17:09
were cowrie shells and went off memory a
17:11
bit here
17:12
and they were used around africa i think
17:14
as currency
17:15
but then they found a new bay which had
17:18
tons and tons and tons of carry shells
17:20
in
17:20
and then people just went and collected
17:21
loads and loads of them and ended up
17:23
completely collapsing the
17:25
very early economy did you know that
17:26
shell is revisiting its shell-based
17:29
roots
17:29
are they in that they are helping
17:32
to return shells to their natural
17:36
environment
17:36
so they're sponsoring this non-profit
17:38
organization which
17:40
collects shells from restaurants and
17:42
then puts them back on beaches and in
17:43
areas where oysters can cling onto them
17:45
because apparently oysters like to cling
17:46
onto other oyster shells
17:48
so there there you go they're collecting
17:49
shells again um so i was really
17:51
impressed with this fact and i thought
17:52
it was brilliant my husband already knew
17:54
it
17:55
because there is a curt vile song from
17:57
the 30s about
17:58
uh shell did you know this anna's
18:00
married to 101 year old man
18:04
um the whole song is about uh in
18:05
margaret it was a promenade
18:07
and a man was selling shells and his son
18:09
comes along and turns the business
18:10
around and then petroleum ends up being
18:11
this big thing about
18:12
how it's complex come out of oil in the
18:14
united league of nations
18:16
from the 90s wow it's kind of cool they
18:18
used to write songs about very different
18:19
things
18:22
the the first ever um oil company was
18:25
founded to harvest just oil that was
18:27
floating on water
18:29
because that was the first people knew
18:31
about obviously you don't know oils in
18:32
the ground
18:33
yeah yeah so they sort of saw it there
18:35
in pennsylvania in 1859
18:37
and they said maybe there's more oil
18:39
underneath here they started drilling
18:41
down
18:41
and then they struck oil but wow i think
18:43
that was the first time that oil was
18:45
actually struck
18:46
you know that just speaking of oil
18:47
floating on water so bitumen
18:49
is uh it's like more solid oil it's made
18:52
of the same stuff but it's slightly more
18:53
compressed
18:54
and so i think the first ever oil
18:57
kingdom that made its money from oil was
18:59
the nabataeans who i love i remember
19:01
researching them for the end series
19:03
so in the future you're always trying to
19:05
shoehorn the navity and
19:06
in fact anna is actually sure for and
19:08
nabataean
19:11
i'm even older than ann's husband
19:15
no this is incredible they made their
19:17
money because they were near the dead
19:18
sea
19:19
so they based their kingdom around the
19:20
dead sea and they noticed these lumps of
19:22
bitumen
19:23
floating in the dead sea and they were
19:24
islands of tar and the egyptians like to
19:27
buy tarp because
19:28
they were used in the mummifying process
19:30
for embalming and they were also used
19:32
for waterproofing boats
19:33
and so the nabataeans went and swum out
19:35
to these islands on the dead sea
19:36
easy to swim in it because you're
19:37
floating um and they collected this
19:40
bitumen sold it to the egyptians and
19:41
that's how they got so rich and that's
19:42
how they had the biggest kingdom
19:44
of that time that was great isn't that
19:46
cool that's really good
19:47
i love the nabataeans do you know
19:50
someone who wrote about seashells
19:52
was edgar allan poe did he he wrote a
19:55
book called the conchologist's first
19:57
book and it was his best-selling book
19:59
no yes and also he didn't write it
20:01
really it's so like
20:03
he the original author said can you
20:05
rewrite this and sort of remix it in a
20:06
cheaper way
20:08
um but like don't tell the publishers
20:10
that you're doing this
20:11
because the publishers didn't want the
20:12
author to do this but the author wanted
20:14
to make extra money
20:15
wow like a sparknotes version of the
20:17
original book
20:18
so um so needed the money so he
20:21
reordered the picture he wrote a preface
20:23
um one of his biographers jeffrey meyers
20:25
said poe's boring pedantic and hair
20:27
splitting preface was absolutely
20:29
guaranteed
20:30
to torment and discourage even the most
20:32
passionately interested school boy
20:35
um do you know when the best time to buy
20:37
petrol is when your car is like
20:43
it's the winter actually because petrol
20:46
gets more dense when it's colder
20:48
and so that means you get more for your
20:50
money uh so if you make sure you go and
20:52
buy your
20:52
petrol on a cold day then more of it's
20:54
going to come out
20:55
because it's measured by volume like how
20:57
metal expands when it's hot so bridges
20:59
change in length you get a different
21:00
volume of petrol bridges don't expend
21:02
that much in length
21:04
oh we've been on this bridge for ages
21:06
well it's a very warm day
21:09
earliest oil drilling platform do you
21:11
guys know when it was
21:12
was it the nabataeans again that was
21:15
collecting
21:16
um it was not it was chinese obviously
21:19
as
21:20
all great inventions seem to be this is
21:21
in the third century bc
21:23
and they drilled down 800 feet for oil
21:26
and they siphoned it up through bamboo
21:29
poles and the reason they did it was
21:30
because salt was very valuable
21:32
and they used oil to create fuel to
21:35
create heat to evaporate
21:36
brine so that it left salt and they had
21:38
oil pipelines underground made of bamboo
21:41
and led from one like salt world to
21:43
another come off it
21:44
isn't that incredible bamboo pipelines
21:47
apparently
21:48
does not compute it was in a real book
21:50
and i'll look it up again later to check
21:52
that it wasn't
21:53
crazy facts about oil by mr muppet
21:58
so if you defecated at 650 degrees
22:01
fahrenheit with a pressure of 3 000
22:03
pounds per square inch
22:05
it would burn it would and your poo
22:07
would turn into oil
22:08
so oil is made through organic material
22:11
which is pressurized
22:12
and that would give you the same effect
22:14
by doing that we've all had curries like
22:16
that haven't we
22:17
it doesn't mean we could take if
22:19
everyone's periods work this would be
22:20
horrible but if someone collected
22:21
everyone's potatoes and put them in a
22:22
hot
22:23
pressurized room yes why don't we do
22:26
that
22:26
well the reason being that the energy
22:28
that you would need to create these
22:29
conditions
22:30
is a lot more than the energy get from
22:33
those laws of thermodynamics
22:35
it's called hydrothermal liquefaction
22:38
and it's a report by the pacific
22:39
northwest national
22:40
laboratory um where they did they say
22:43
the defecation thing
22:44
they was that the harkin spin that is
22:47
yeah that is a hacking spin
22:49
but there was they said if you put um
22:51
feces under these conditions that would
22:53
happen
22:54
through the pipeline and what is pooing
22:56
apart from
22:57
feces going through a pipeline that's
22:59
true
23:01
we should move on soon but has anyone
23:02
got anything else oh i was looking at
23:04
other businesses that originally sold
23:06
different things but my favorite which
23:08
kind of makes sense if you think when
23:09
you think about the name it's american
23:10
express
23:11
do you know what they might have done
23:12
first uh travel or transport uh
23:14
so post they were because in those days
23:17
uh so they were founded in 1850
23:19
and the post u.s postal service was sort
23:21
of not as slick as it is today and you
23:23
could only post things as big as a
23:25
regular letter size envelope
23:26
and so anything bigger you'd go through
23:28
and express companies so sort of horse
23:29
guys on horseback and
23:31
some other form of transport that was
23:32
around like the pony express yeah and
23:34
they would just take things
23:35
and american express found out that they
23:37
did a lot of business for banks and
23:38
carrying things like stock certificates
23:40
and currency was a lot more lucrative
23:41
than carrying big bulky things
23:43
and they specialized and made their own
23:44
products that was really cool because
23:46
american express
23:47
it makes sense yeah my other favorite
23:49
one is that it's still the same products
23:50
but the guys who invented youtube
23:52
thought it was gonna be a dating site
23:53
people would upload videos like for what
23:55
they were looking for and you see what
23:56
they were like
23:57
and then it turned out no one is very
23:58
camera friendly and we all like
24:00
cats but not in that way yeah
24:04
[Applause]
24:07
[Music]
24:08
okay we should move on to our final fact
24:10
and that is my fact which is that when
24:12
mozart first performed in naples he had
24:14
to stop to take his ring off halfway
24:16
through
24:17
because the audience complained it was a
24:18
magic ring
24:20
a magic ring through which he was
24:22
producing oil at 650 pressures
24:26
oh dear um that's disgusting
24:29
but it wasn't that kind of ring they
24:30
were referring but mozart would have
24:32
liked that wouldn't he because he was a
24:33
he had a dirty mind yeah he did quite a
24:36
sense of humor yeah
24:37
about his farts and things he was um
24:39
obsessively scatological actually wasn't
24:41
it
24:42
and i think people have really tried to
24:43
analyze this and work out why but
24:45
he so he wrote to his cousin uh quite
24:48
rude letters very often and
24:50
one of them for instance was well i wish
24:52
you good night this is a swear warning
24:54
for any listeners
24:55
uh he said well i wish you good night
24:56
but first in your bed and make it
24:58
burst
24:59
sleep soundly my love into your mouth
25:01
your ass your shove
25:03
what and then he wrote another one
25:04
saying i pull on your nose so it runs
25:06
down your chin
25:08
[Laughter]
25:10
he also wrote a lot of really good stuff
25:12
guys some of the good stuff yeah
25:15
uh he wrote enough music that it would
25:16
take you 202 hours to listen to all of
25:18
it
25:19
wow that's pretty cool i think they
25:21
might this rings above and classic fm i
25:23
think they might have just released the
25:24
complete
25:25
mozart 200 hours 200 200 maybe they
25:29
skipped off the last two that was all
25:30
the blue stuff
25:31
yeah it was the best-selling cd of last
25:33
year wasn't it or more cd more mozart
25:35
cds were sold than any other
25:37
artist last year mozart loved pooh yeah
25:40
it's possible that pooh loves mozart
25:43
there is a sewage treatment plant in
25:46
switzerland
25:47
and in 2010 they started playing mozart
25:49
nope
25:50
to the waist yes no i started dancing
25:56
[Laughter]
25:58
they claimed that the music's vibrations
25:59
would help the organisms
26:01
the microbes in it to break down the
26:03
waste and the cadences and all these
26:05
things so they developed a process to
26:06
play it
26:06
and the man who ran the place is a guy
26:08
called anton stuckey and he said
26:10
he wasn't actually a fan of mozart they
26:12
had to convince him quite strongly that
26:13
it would work to do it
26:14
i don't know if they're still doing it
26:15
but they did start interestingly if you
26:18
take
26:18
um human eggs
26:21
in ivf they grow better if you play
26:25
techno music to them
26:26
really i read that last week in a some
26:29
study earlier wow
26:30
so is this vibration we're thinking yeah
26:33
that's vibration yeah i've just realized
26:34
i haven't actually explained my fact
26:36
because you all derailed me with your
26:37
scatological sorry magic ring yeah
26:39
magic ring uh so he was doing this
26:42
concert in naples he was 14 years old
26:45
and it was in 1770 and rumor been
26:48
spreading anyway that he was using magic
26:49
powers to play that the audience refused
26:51
to be entertained
26:52
so they and they refused to applaud and
26:55
they just didn't see it as impressive
26:56
because they assumed that his power was
26:57
coming from this magic ring
26:58
so halfway through his performance he
27:00
had to stop and take off his ring and at
27:02
that point apparently
27:03
uh the audience gasped in astonishment
27:05
and fear while crossing themselves
27:08
i went on to um the wikipedia for magic
27:11
rings
27:11
there is one and it starts off a magic
27:14
ring
27:15
is a ring usually a finger ring
27:20
i wanna know what these magic rings
27:22
are oh my god
27:24
ring james they're talking about toe
27:25
rings toe ring or earring it could be i
27:27
guess yeah
27:28
my mind went there yeah a magic ring
27:32
is a ring usually a finger ring that has
27:34
magical properties
27:36
great makes a lot of sense yeah i should
27:38
say i found this fact
27:39
in a book called timekeepers by simon
27:41
garfield and it's amazing and
27:43
you should buy i'm loving it i'm about
27:44
quarter of the way through he's
27:46
brilliant
27:47
so i didn't know i knew mozart was a
27:49
child prodigy i didn't know quite how
27:50
much of one
27:51
he was so he could play the harp in the
27:53
violin at the age of about three
27:55
or he started playing again when he was
27:56
five he was quite good and then his
27:58
father took him on tour age six
28:00
for three and a half years playing
28:02
across europe
28:04
with his sister as well who doesn't uh
28:05
get as much uh cred
28:07
was his sister better i read somewhere
28:08
that his sister was a better musician
28:10
i don't think so start off with because
28:12
she was older she had i think didn't she
28:14
like trans because he would play i think
28:16
she would transcribe and there's some
28:18
thought that she had more influence
28:19
right he was giving credit for
28:21
interesting um yeah and he could
28:23
i've read this i can't i don't know if i
28:25
believe it he could write music before
28:26
he could write words
28:27
you can sort of believe that it's easier
28:29
to write blobs on a
28:30
manuscript than it is to write actual
28:32
letters yeah
28:34
it is very interesting psychologically
28:36
because he is the
28:37
original child prodigy and you've got to
28:39
wonder what effects it had
28:41
so when i was listening to i used this
28:43
podcast as an excuse to listen to
28:44
my genuinely favorite podcast which is
28:46
the radio three composer of the week
28:50
podcast second favorite radiolabs my
28:53
favorite
28:55
um and yeah he was and people were
28:59
amazed at him and it must have affected
29:00
him hugely and apparently when he
29:02
got older he was very angry that people
29:04
didn't treat him with the same kind of
29:06
amazement and deference because once he
29:07
was a grown-up he was just
29:09
an incredibly talented musician and
29:10
composer but as a child he was like this
29:13
magic genius so he used to get very
29:15
annoying it's really rough but also
29:17
because he will
29:18
be a better player than he was when he
29:19
was a kid but rather than being admired
29:20
for being more like better more skilled
29:22
everyone's gone you're not cute
29:23
yeah like someone whose absolute best
29:26
year was
29:27
uh the first year of university and they
29:29
can never quite
29:31
get back that magic again that is the
29:34
story of my life
29:36
so mozart's first name was john
29:39
johannes chrysostom wolfgangus
29:42
theophilus mozart
29:43
and he was named after saint john
29:45
chrysostom
29:47
uh and i was reading about the story of
29:49
saint john chrysostom
29:50
and it's quite good he was living in the
29:53
desert
29:54
and then a princess came to his cave
29:56
because she was being attacked by
29:57
animals
29:58
and he didn't really want her to move
29:59
into his cave because he was worried
30:01
that he might have sex with her
30:02
and so what he did was like some kind of
30:05
1960 sitcom he drew a line in the middle
30:08
of his cave and said i'll stay on my
30:10
side of the line and you stand your side
30:11
the line
30:13
and then despite this um the sin of
30:15
fornication was committed
30:17
and in attempt to hide it he threw her
30:19
off a cliff don't just
30:22
just tell her to keep it quiet with
30:23
their friends let's throw off a cliff
30:26
it was a different time it feels the
30:28
seventies
30:31
[Laughter]
30:33
um then he went to rome to beg for
30:36
absolution which was refused
30:38
for the murderer for the sex for the
30:40
murder really i'd like to be absolved
30:42
from murder please but with a sex
30:44
chaser at the beginning when he said a
30:47
princess comes into his cave i was
30:49
thinking it sounds a bit like the
30:50
beginning of notting hill
30:51
um what because that's where the
30:55
celebrity comes into hugh grant's
30:56
bookshop in notting hill okay like a
30:58
very famous
30:59
wealthy person comes into the life of an
31:00
ordinary man i've not seen notting hill
31:02
does he then throw her off
31:04
he does anyway so then he um
31:07
he lived like a beast um crawling on all
31:10
fours and feeding on wild grasses and
31:12
roots
31:13
and then the princess reappeared alive
31:16
with the saints baby
31:19
and the baby miraculously pronounced his
31:22
sins to be forgiven
31:23
and that was the miracle that made him
31:25
into a saint very forgiving of the baby
31:27
was she brought back to life by god or
31:29
was she did she just survive being
31:30
thrown off a cliff we don't see that
31:32
we don't see that off-screen yeah you
31:34
have to infer it from
31:36
yourself like it's one of those stories
31:38
where
31:39
it could be one or it could be the other
31:41
like the end of inception
31:44
i thought you could only become a saint
31:46
by doing three amazing things i didn't
31:47
realize you could just get a baby to
31:49
forgive you he's done three amazing
31:50
things
31:51
he's had sex with the princess he's
31:53
lived like a beast
31:55
and he's been to rome he's in a room and
31:57
he's got a talking baby
31:59
it's basically notting hill mixed with
32:01
inception look who's talking
32:03
[Laughter]
32:05
and that's that's the story of mozart um
32:08
most i've got a lot of bad reviews
32:09
interestingly even during life
32:11
probably used a magic ring one star
32:15
fake so these were phrases that we used
32:18
about him too strongly spiced
32:20
um impenetrable labyrinths bizarre
32:22
flights of the soul
32:24
and overloaded and overstuffed really
32:26
yeah
32:27
so it wasn't all completely positive i'm
32:29
not saying he was bad at music
32:32
you're one of the haters yeah he may
32:34
have this is interesting he may have
32:35
died because he got too little sunlight
32:38
really yeah because he died so young he
32:40
was 35
32:41
yeah when he died and um he was very
32:43
nocturnal towards the end of his life
32:45
and
32:45
where he was living he died about three
32:47
months into the winter
32:48
and there's a theory that a contributory
32:50
factor was
32:51
lack of vitamin d because you can't make
32:54
vitamin d
32:55
if you don't get sunlight so um and
32:57
there are so many other theories though
32:59
there are about 20 theories at least of
33:00
what killed him
33:01
he was also rejected in other other ways
33:04
so he was rejected in love
33:05
uh by the first woman he fell in love
33:07
with actually aloysia
33:09
webber and he ended up marrying her
33:11
sister but he fell in love with her at
33:12
first and when asked after his death why
33:14
she turned him down she just said
33:16
i did not know i only thought he was
33:17
such a little man
33:19
to reject her because he was too small
33:21
and then another person
33:22
uh the uh prince elect of bavaria
33:26
once heard him play and then afterwards
33:28
said who would believe that such great
33:30
things could be hidden in so
33:32
small ahead so he obviously had a
33:34
smallness problem that perhaps he was
33:36
trying to compensate for with it it must
33:37
have been hard for him to play music
33:38
with such small hands
33:39
he ran up and down the keys
33:43
like big yeah
33:46
maybe is there anything about him not
33:47
getting if he was indoors not getting
33:48
enough vitamin d because you need that
33:49
to grow right
33:50
yes this is a cracking theory this is
33:52
the kind of thing that
33:54
science studies get written
33:56
about was mozart too
33:57
small because he didn't have enough
33:58
vitamin d
34:00
okay we should round up pretty soon has
34:02
anyone got anything else
34:04
oh i just have one thing which i'm not
34:05
sure is true but i like it so much i
34:06
wanted to say
34:07
uh mozart apparently had a fear of
34:09
trumpets and i read somewhere to cure
34:11
her this his father hired someone to
34:13
follow him around with a trumpet
34:14
and blast the noise to surprise him i
34:17
don't care if it's not true because i
34:19
really like that idea
34:20
i can kind of knowing what i know about
34:22
mozart's father i could totally imagine
34:24
that
34:24
a totally horrible man you're a slave
34:26
driver uh a little bit i think
34:28
it was six-year-old entourage for three
34:30
years yeah
34:32
no sunlight
34:37
yeah deliberately shrunk his own son
34:40
like honey i shrunk the kids
34:49
okay we should finish on that excellent
34:52
reference
34:53

01:23
oh i love chewie and once again we have
01:26
gathered around the microphones with our
01:28
four favorite facts from the last seven
01:30
days
01:30
and in a particular order here we go
01:33
starting with my fact
01:35
my fact this week is that in the final
01:37
years of its construction
01:39
mount rushmore was built by baseball
01:42
players
01:42
nice did they run out of dynamite and
01:45
they said well we'd better just get a
01:46
bunch of guys with bands
01:49
no so uh mount rushmore was constructed
01:52
between 1927 and 1941 in the
01:55
first early stages and actually right up
01:57
until about 1938
01:59
it was being led by a guy called gutson
02:01
borglum and gutson borglum had a son
02:03
working on it called lincoln and lincoln
02:05
was obsessed with baseball and he really
02:07
wanted to put a baseball team together
02:08
so from 1938 when he started hiring all
02:12
the people to work on it
02:13
one of the things that he required you
02:14
to be able to do was play baseball
02:17
so that you could be part of the team uh
02:19
it almost didn't matter
02:20
if you were able to be a drill well one
02:24
of the guys uh
02:25
his name's nick clifford he's the last
02:27
construction worker on mount rushmore
02:28
who's still alive
02:29
and you can meet him in the summers so
02:32
if you're this year 2017 in the summer
02:34
he's 95 years old at the moment
02:36
uh go to mount rushmore and he sits
02:38
there and he gives tours he explains
02:40
what's going on how they built it he
02:42
signs books
02:42
and he hands out baseball cards from the
02:44
team and
02:46
they actually competed in amateur
02:47
baseball and they made it to the
02:49
semi-finals they came in third so they
02:50
were really good and
02:51
uh the semi-finals of of the amateur
02:54
baseball
02:55
no one's heard of league just in the
02:58
mount rushmore area
02:59
yeah no i'm not fully sure on that
03:01
actually actually it did sound when you
03:03
read people's
03:04
memoirs about it it sounds like they had
03:06
a really good teamwork kind of bond
03:09
doesn't it
03:09
yeah the workers so they all had these
03:11
weird nicknames
03:12
so they were all called stuff like uh
03:15
lively
03:16
and paluca and red and hoot and whiskey
03:19
and how do you and howdy yeah one guy's
03:22
called howdy
03:22
did you read the story about what howdy
03:24
did to one of his teammates at one point
03:27
no this is so they played quite a lot of
03:28
pranks on each other i think so one of
03:30
their favorite pranks was uh if a new
03:32
builder came on site then uh when he was
03:34
going up on an ab sale then you'd like
03:36
loosen it so he dropped down a few feet
03:38
and think he was plummeting to his desk
03:40
that's bullying isn't it it yeah but
03:42
bullying is always funny for the bullies
03:44
and so i think most of them enjoyed it
03:46
okay
03:47
it was very good nature who will speak
03:48
for bullies
03:50
hannah will speak for bullies
03:53
hey i'm in good company these days um
03:56
but no he did this thing
03:57
where i think one of his uh co-workers
04:00
slapped him on the ass or something so
04:01
to get him back
04:02
um they have they had an air hose that
04:04
they used to remove all this rock dust
04:06
that was all over them at the end of the
04:07
day they got covered in rock dust so it
04:09
had really powerful
04:10
blowing force and he got this air hose
04:12
and he shoved it up his teammate's
04:14
ass and it inflated his teammates inside
04:18
and everyone thought he was gonna die so
04:20
this guy said he blowed up
04:22
tight he blowed up tighter than a drum
04:24
and one of the witnesses said that um
04:26
when the hose connected you could see
04:27
his belly swell right up
04:29
he yelled my god howdy you've killed me
04:32
and then he had to start passing air and
04:33
he passed quite a lot of blood with it
04:35
if you're listening and you have access
04:36
to high pressure air hoses do not try
04:38
this at home
04:38
but no fatalities of any of the workers
04:41
on mount rushmore
04:43
uh despite all the weird pranks that
04:45
they would play on each other
04:46
yeah so when did you say it was finished
04:48
1941 is when they ran out of funding
04:50
exactly it's not finished yeah someone
04:53
could still take up the mantle they're
04:54
meant to be down to the waist but once
04:55
they've done the faces and the shoulders
04:56
and things they sort of thought
04:58
well you know who they are yeah it's
04:59
good that they didn't start at the other
05:01
end
05:06
did you read that thing where it's not
05:08
going to be properly finished for 300
05:10
000 years
05:13
that's because the granite erodes and it
05:15
erodes by a very very tiny bit and the
05:17
person who is making it knew this
05:19
and so he deliberately made all the
05:21
faces slightly fatter
05:23
so they'll just keep eroding and keep
05:25
eroding and then apparently in 300 000
05:27
years
05:27
all the proportions will be correct
05:29
that's amazing that's incredible
05:30
yeah but why did he plan it to be right
05:32
in 300 000 years rather than just
05:35
to go with the 300 000th anniversary of
05:37
the declaration of independence
05:40
well the thing is that the the faces
05:42
will still be
05:43
you'll still have the outline of a face
05:45
for seven million years before they
05:47
arrive
05:48
and i read this is in futility closet a
05:50
website i read this
05:52
the noses are about 240 inches long
05:55
will be 2.4 million years before it's
05:57
down to just a flat
05:58
face if they rode all the way they'll
06:00
look like four voldemorts
06:02
that'd be quite cool yes so in 2.4
06:05
million years they'll think that four of
06:07
the first presidents of america were all
06:08
voldemort
06:09
or rather than just the most recent ones
06:14
they finished the heads at different
06:15
times right because they would they
06:16
would they worked on washington then
06:18
they finished washington then they
06:19
started on the next one
06:20
so they had different dedication
06:21
ceremonies for each one before they
06:23
did the whole dedication at the end and
06:26
before
06:26
each dedication they would put a massive
06:29
american flag over the president's head
06:31
and then they'd drop it to reveal ah
06:34
there he is yeah so does that mean
06:36
people didn't really know who it was
06:37
going to be before they yeah i think
06:39
yeah maybe 90 of it was done with
06:41
dynamite mount rushmore yeah i think
06:43
that's amazing yeah and they got to
06:44
within
06:45
four inches of the final thing just
06:47
using dynamite and then they had to do
06:49
the chips but the rest was done by hand
06:50
doesn't it
06:51
yeah like as in they would make little
06:53
holes and then they'd just grab it out
06:54
with their hands yeah
06:55
it's like um called honeycombing yeah we
06:57
do loads and loads and loads of little
06:58
holes and then just pull it out
06:59
i think it's incredible that you would
07:01
do almost all of it with massive
07:02
dynamite and the last bit you would just
07:04
kind of grab it out with your hands yeah
07:06
that's really yeah
07:07
um on the actual uh baseball card that
07:09
you can buy of
07:10
um back to the baseball
07:14
well he's actually holding one of the
07:16
honeycomb uh devices on the front
07:19
as an old man he's holding it so they've
07:21
still got the original ones there
07:22
that's really cool yeah i do get the
07:24
feeling you're more interested in the
07:25
baseball side of this
07:26
than the monument side yeah i think it's
07:29
pretty
07:30
i mean they they clearly are as well if
07:31
you go to the local cafe
07:33
all of their trays is the story of the
07:35
baseball team they don't even point out
07:37
the mountain to you they're a bit
07:38
embarrassed that that's the focus point
07:40
do they cover have they recovered it
07:41
with those flags originally it was not
07:44
going to be any presidents on mount
07:45
rushmore it was just going to be a
07:47
mountain
07:47
uh no that's how god intended it
07:51
so the original plan uh before they got
07:53
uh
07:54
borglum on board was to have uh sort of
07:57
figures from
07:58
the american west so maybe chief red
08:00
cloud
08:01
buffalo bill and lewis and clark the two
08:03
explorers who
08:04
uh explored a load around there um and
08:07
then cuts on took over
08:08
and he said there's absolutely no way
08:11
i'm spending my life's work
08:13
on these non-entities it's going to be
08:15
presidents or nothing
08:16
and he insisted and they did change the
08:18
plan yeah i have a baseball facts for
08:20
you dan
08:21
oh great um so during the war um
08:24
during the cold war uh america wanted to
08:26
make a surveillance tunnel um in berlin
08:29
um they needed to get something on the
08:30
floor on the other side that they could
08:32
use
08:33
as a marker which is where the tunnel
08:35
would go to and so what they would do is
08:37
they'd play baseball
08:38
right near the wall and deliberately hit
08:40
the ball over so the ball landed there
08:42
and then they'd be able to survey it and
08:43
be able to see where the ball is and use
08:45
that as a marker
08:46
so it's like can we not have a ball back
08:48
please yeah exactly that
08:50
and what happened was the germans were
08:52
just too kind and they just kept going
08:54
and collecting the ball back and
08:56
bringing it back to them
08:57
so they could never do it that's awesome
08:59
that's so good
09:00
like a dog like an annoying dog
09:04
in world war ii and also on baseball the
09:07
americans designed a grenade that was
09:09
exactly the same
09:10
shape and size and weight as a baseball
09:12
so that americans could throw it easily
09:14
i think didn't they it was called the
09:15
bino really yeah and that was to make it
09:17
because it was and it was supposed to be
09:18
thrown like a baseball and then it
09:20
exploded on it
09:21
was it painted as well to look like a
09:22
baseball and had stitching on it like a
09:24
baseball
09:24
yeah was there was there an amusing mix
09:26
up at any point with these things
09:29
yeah maybe it's like christmas and they
09:31
get in the trenches and like okay let's
09:33
play football no no let's play baseball
09:35
i brought my own ball
09:38
according to a medical report published
09:40
in 1977 in the diseases of colon and
09:42
rectum
09:43
a 49 year old man was admitted to san
09:46
francisco hospital complaining of severe
09:48
pain
09:48
a firm fixed round object was found to
09:51
be lodged high in his rectum
09:53
the man then admitted that he and his
09:55
sexual partner had celebrated the
09:56
oakland days world series win
09:58
by having a baseball inserted into his
10:02
anus
10:05
oh my god could have been worse could
10:07
have been a bad
10:11
[Applause]
10:13
[Music]
10:15
okay it's time for fact number two and
10:18
that is
10:19
james okay my fact this week is that on
10:22
some train journeys
10:23
in china passengers are forced to take
10:25
it in turns to use the seats
10:27
so that everyone gets a chance to sit
10:29
down for some of the journey
10:32
that's good isn't it very much the
10:33
southern rail of countries china
10:36
so this is this is the spring festival
10:40
uh chinese new year which is happening
10:41
at the moment
10:43
and um it's the biggest migration of
10:45
humans in the world
10:46
there's like three billion people making
10:49
journeys around china
10:51
and while china infrastructure is pretty
10:53
good and it's getting better
10:55
it's still that's way too many people to
10:57
be moving around
10:58
and there's only so many trains you can
11:00
have and they sell these tickets and
11:02
a lot of the journeys are quite long and
11:04
so they make a rule where everyone gets
11:06
to sit down for a little bit and i think
11:08
that's quite a good rule actually yeah
11:09
it's great
11:09
that's true yeah yeah how many journeys
11:11
did you take it made i've said three
11:13
billion yeah there's three billion
11:14
journeys isn't it not three billion
11:16
people
11:16
because it's so amazing you have to go
11:18
there and you have to come back and then
11:19
you might have to change a bit
11:20
yeah exactly i wonder if a change count
11:22
still has one journey though because it
11:23
does when you buy a ticket doesn't it
11:25
did you see that thing in the news i
11:26
think it was today or yesterday where
11:28
say you're buying a ticket from london
11:30
to bolton um
11:31
then you would have to pay a certain
11:32
amount of money but you go on this
11:34
website you say where you want to go and
11:36
it splits it all up so you might go
11:38
london to watford watford to milton
11:40
keynes milton keys to birmingham
11:42
birmingham to stoke stoke to bolton
11:44
and it works out the cost of all those
11:46
and you can save a load of money
11:48
and a load of football fans from the fa
11:49
cup were using it and they all saved a
11:51
ton of money
11:53
on the news this morning yeah yeah a guy
11:54
had uh 52 tickets from one return
11:57
journey to a football match because you
11:58
need a ticket for each one of these tiny
12:00
little things and so he just has a
12:02
massive envelope full of tons of tickets
12:04
and where the ticker
12:05
inspector comes you're like okay it's
12:07
definitely one of these
12:08
that's amazing apparently that is true
12:10
although i think they're gonna try and
12:11
make
12:12
all their tickets a bit easier in that
12:14
news article i read they're gonna change
12:15
a lot of the tickets aren't they
12:16
there's something like three million
12:18
different possible tickets you can buy
12:20
in the uk and the majority of them have
12:21
never been bought by anyone no way
12:23
something like that yeah
12:25
anyway this isn't about trains this is
12:26
about the chinese movements of people oh
12:29
yeah
12:29
so one thing about chinese new year is
12:31
that it's very confusing
12:32
that it's called spring it's called the
12:35
spring festival
12:36
which is because it's obviously in
12:37
winter it's supposed to be like the
12:38
start of spring isn't it
12:40
yeah it doesn't feel right it's so
12:41
optimistic so i think
12:43
like i think china divides the year into
12:46
is it 20 sections which have different
12:47
names and then there's one section which
12:49
is
12:49
the first section of the year which is
12:51
start of spring and that runs for a
12:53
couple of weeks in mid-february
12:55
and so this is called spring festival
12:57
because i think it's a festival that
12:58
comes
12:59
just on the cusp of start of spring
13:01
period right which is just
13:02
i mean it's not spring it's sweet that
13:04
they're convincing themselves that it is
13:06
and it's called chinese new year it
13:07
doesn't even happen at new year doesn't
13:08
even happen first january what's going
13:10
on
13:11
dan you grew up there what's what's this
13:13
all about well it's like the deal with
13:15
chinese new year did you do the thing
13:16
where you give each other envelopes with
13:18
money
13:18
yeah lycee it's called or i'd probably
13:20
pronounce that slightly wrong but um
13:22
you used to say congrats and
13:25
they would give you a red packet with
13:27
money inside and it was
13:29
living in hong kong which was a very
13:30
affluent place was amazing because
13:32
everyone gave you these packets and it
13:34
was
13:34
the time to make money if you were a kid
13:36
you would just walk around and walk up
13:37
to adults and say gongs
13:38
and they just give you a red packet and
13:41
it was yeah yeah so if you went to a
13:42
party
13:43
it was incredible it was like the tooth
13:44
fairy went nuts and everyone
13:46
revealed themselves to be that person
13:48
and they're just handing you money
13:49
is it just a kid because i thought it
13:50
was everyone and then i thought at the
13:52
end of the day you'd end up
13:53
equal i left when i was a kid so yeah
13:55
you left and you stayed got all the
13:57
money
13:58
while still a child fled the scene of
14:00
the crime
14:02
very crafty just on the everyone
14:04
traveling everywhere for chinese new
14:06
year there has been a story in the news
14:07
uh last week about one guy who uh
14:10
started cycling home because he was very
14:12
poor couldn't afford a train ticket
14:13
couldn't afford a plane
14:15
so he started cycling uh really early
14:18
and he cycled for 30 days he went 300
14:20
miles
14:20
so 10 miles a day which is not great but
14:22
okay maybe it's a bad bike
14:24
anyway he then yeah it was gonna be
14:27
rocky
14:27
exactly anyway he then found out he'd be
14:29
going the wrong direction for 300 miles
14:32
no yeah well i don't know because
14:35
he was trying to travel a thousand miles
14:36
supposedly and it meant that he would
14:38
have had to take
14:39
three months to get home so i can't
14:42
quite
14:43
believe it but apparently he'd been
14:45
living in internet cafes because he was
14:46
really broke
14:47
yeah but maybe he thought that he was
14:48
going to get more than 10 miles a day
14:50
probably
14:50
probably yeah didn't bank on that rocky
14:52
terrain and the bad bike
14:53
[Music]
14:56
anyway this was reported in the china
14:57
people's daily an organization i have no
14:59
reason to mistrust
15:01
i remember reading that as well and the
15:03
idea was that he kept asking people
15:04
which way to go and they all started
15:06
telling him the wrong direction
15:10
if he kept asking then presumably he'd
15:11
just have gone back and forth over the
15:13
same 10 miles to get it again and again
15:16
um just can i just say something about
15:18
uh crowded trains
15:19
yes this is kind of about because i
15:21
didn't know this was a thing but in
15:23
japan in tokyo they have pushers at
15:25
stations
15:26
which are people to i think they're
15:28
called oshia and they're people to push
15:30
people onto crowded trains
15:32
and someone described it as uh perfectly
15:34
happily someone who's been pushed by a
15:36
push i said
15:37
it's like if you had a big laundry
15:38
basket and it's overflowing you just
15:39
force stuff in there
15:40
you can see footage of this on youtube
15:42
if you uh look it up and
15:44
it's extraordinary it's a there's no
15:46
more space like literally to even
15:48
breathe and you've got people shoving
15:50
like crazy to get those doors closed
15:52
it's astonishing and they pull people
15:54
off as well don't they that's a bit much
15:57
yeah how much do you have to give them
15:58
in a red envelope to do that
16:01
no they're called puller offers
16:02
sometimes no they're not i've seen them
16:05
called polar offers
16:07
i'm sure wow we used to have uh in hong
16:09
kong you used to be able to
16:11
in some cases get your own carriage if
16:13
you were western because of the number
16:15
four
16:16
so the superstition of number four is so
16:18
great that a lot of people wouldn't get
16:19
anything that had the number four on it
16:21
because it sounds like the word for
16:22
death is
16:23
that which is death and yeah so number
16:25
four so
16:26
if say a cable card that had number four
16:28
on it uh would be empty
16:30
and so if you were if they could see a
16:31
western family they would go
16:33
come on now
16:41
yeah in 2005 uh this is the
16:44
period when everyone's going is known as
16:46
chunyun i think yeah
16:48
um so in the 2005 chunyun period um
16:51
the train offices had certainly less
16:54
than a hundred
16:55
um phone lines uh more than ten but less
16:57
than a hundred so somewhere in the tens
16:59
of
16:59
phone lines and they were getting 19.91
17:03
million calls per hour
17:05
oh my god you are number 10 million and
17:08
12
17:09
in the queue um just one last thing
17:13
it's the chinese year of the cockerel
17:16
um that's just started um that's 2017.
17:19
obviously it's every what is it every
17:22
12 12 years until you return to the
17:24
shoulder animal so one of them
17:25
um was 1945 and 1945 was the first time
17:30
that the cartoon character foghorn
17:32
leghorn was ever voiced
17:34
so he is a year of the cockrell
17:36
character
17:38
and also have you heard of mike the
17:39
headless chicken yeah
17:41
he must have done he was the guy who um
17:43
there was a family in america and they
17:45
were chopping their heads off chickens
17:46
and one of them stayed alive and ran
17:48
around for a couple of years
17:49
and he was born also in 1945 so he was
17:53
also a
17:54
year of the cockrell guy very nice
17:57
you know they're all very arrogant
17:58
though here are the cockrell types
18:00
the roosters and this year of the
18:02
rooster is the year of the vain the
18:03
arrogant and the emotionally volatile
18:05
what are you
18:07
i am a tiger what's your chinese new
18:10
year side
18:13
it's interesting um so what the
18:15
description you just made
18:16
is taken very seriously back in china
18:18
and there are certain years where
18:20
pregnancy rates are extremely low
18:22
because oh
18:24
very bad year and i wish i could
18:25
remember off the top of my head yeah
18:28
[Laughter]
18:31
[Applause]
18:34
[Music]
18:36
okay it is time for fact number three
18:38
and that is
18:40
drew ah this is the worst new name
18:45
i've ever had and i went to an all-boys
18:47
school for 11 years
18:50
okay it is time for fact number three
18:52
and that is lightning
18:56
my fact is that the moon has been
18:57
collecting tiny bits of earth for the
18:59
last three billion years
19:01
collecting collecting like a baseball
19:03
card yeah yeah yeah
19:05
what's that gonna do with them um it's
19:08
going to it's got an album and
19:10
it does swapsies with venus
19:14
um yeah this is really really cool so
19:15
there's a new uh uh discovery which has
19:17
been published in nature
19:19
which is that the moon is dusted in this
19:21
fine layer of oxygen
19:23
and it was a bit of a puzzle as to how
19:25
it got there and it turns out that earth
19:27
basically has a tail
19:29
uh of of uh ions and atoms and electrons
19:32
and things like this
19:33
which you know lashes out into space
19:34
behind it wow and normally
19:36
the moon doesn't get any of it but
19:38
sometimes when the sun the earth and the
19:40
moon are all lined up together
19:42
the moon is shielded from the solar wind
19:44
right
19:45
and then it gets a bit of a lashing of
19:47
oxygen atoms
19:48
so the really cool thing is that we
19:51
don't have much evidence
19:52
of very very early life on earth like
19:53
the first bacteria
19:55
there is a chance that on the moon there
19:58
are
19:58
fossil bacteria which got blasted out
20:02
into space
20:02
ended up on the moon then got plowed
20:04
under the moon's surface or maybe buried
20:06
by lava or this kind of thing
20:08
so there's a chance there are fossils up
20:09
there of bacteria
20:11
from the very earliest days of life on
20:13
earth yeah so i mean pretty unlikely
20:15
pretty unlikely but so that's quite a
20:18
cool image because obviously
20:19
uh the earth is hurtling through space
20:21
and it's quite cool to know that we're
20:23
leaving like
20:24
what an asteroid has that sort of tail
20:26
uh out back
20:27
so i've never it stretches all the way
20:31
around the sun
20:31
in the path that we go in yeah yeah
20:33
scientists call it a large dusty ring
20:38
are they yes they do i don't know why
20:40
james is cracking up
20:42
i'm not laughing at all they could do
20:44
with getting a bigger pump
20:49
um yeah the other thing about this tail
20:51
that we're shedding it's in it's our
20:52
magnetic field and it's uh it's called a
20:54
magneto
20:55
tail uh is that when it does sweep
20:57
through the moon
20:58
it's full of these really really hot
21:00
charged highly charged particles which
21:02
it sheds all over the moon and that
21:04
means that
21:04
on the surface of the moon uh suddenly
21:07
voltages can climb up to hundreds and
21:08
hundreds of volts so the surface of the
21:10
moon is incredibly
21:11
electric because we've just shed all
21:13
these eyes wow
21:15
it's cool isn't it so do you reckon i
21:16
know if i stood on the moon
21:18
then my hair would all go kind of wild
21:20
like i'd been static electricity fight
21:23
god maybe that'd be pretty cool wouldn't
21:25
it you'd have to take your helmet off
21:26
though so you would die but i think it
21:27
would be worth it to find out
21:30
could you take your helmet off on the
21:32
moon and then put it back on really
21:34
quickly yeah you hold your breath
21:35
well and re-pressurize your suit and all
21:38
of that
21:38
yeah kidding really you can you can
21:40
survive in outer space for
21:42
like 20 to 30 seconds without dying but
21:45
it's not worth the risk because imagine
21:46
if you took it off your hair went so
21:47
static that you couldn't fit the helmet
21:50
oh no um do you know when um when the
21:53
astronauts the fellows landed on the
21:54
moon
21:55
what are they called armstrong and
21:56
aldrin yeah when they landed on the moon
21:58
do you know what the official schedule
21:59
said uh they should do next well when
22:02
they landed on when they landed on the
22:03
moon the official schedule was for them
22:04
to have a nap
22:05
yeah well that's that's the the whole
22:07
reason that um
22:08
a lot of problems were caused with the
22:10
actual footage of the moon landing
22:11
because
22:12
because they were asleep no because they
22:14
were not asleep they
22:15
had scheduled a nap and armstrong was so
22:17
awake he said i'm not having a nap we're
22:19
going to go out now
22:20
yeah the problem was is that the wrong
22:22
side of the earth was facing the moon
22:23
when he wanted to go out so they had to
22:26
re-route where they were going to
22:28
take the signal from to just to bring
22:30
back the signal of the moon so parks
22:32
observatory in australia
22:33
suddenly were the key people because
22:35
they had access to the moon america was
22:37
on the other side of the wow because
22:40
neil armstrong didn't want to have a nap
22:41
he refused to have a nap so he messed up
22:43
everything that was meant to happen in
22:44
terms of
22:45
the televised footage do you know what
22:47
the words of the third man on the moon
22:49
were
22:50
you'll know this i do but say it yeah um
22:53
that's how i should answer everything
22:54
[Laughter]
22:57
so this is pete conrad who went up in
22:59
the apollo 12 mission a few years later
23:02
so he was the third person to walk on
23:03
the moon and he had a bet with a
23:05
journalist who'd bet
23:06
that nasa dictated what the first words
23:09
of anyone who stepped on the moon had to
23:10
be and he was saying
23:11
no they don't and i'll prove it so the
23:13
journalist told him he had to say a
23:15
particular thing
23:16
and what he said was when he stepped
23:18
when he took his first step
23:20
whoopi so the thing about this guy was
23:22
he was a really short guy and he stepped
23:23
out and he said whoopee
23:24
man that may have been a small one for
23:26
neil but that's a long one for me
23:28
and that was his first words as he
23:29
stepped out of the spacecraft and then
23:31
actually as he stepped onto the
23:33
moon itself he said oh is that soft and
23:35
queasy
23:37
wow um does anyone know the shortest
23:40
trip
23:41
ever to the moon wallace and gromit
23:43
didn't take very long at all
23:44
that's true it's a 45 minute special
23:46
including the preamble
23:48
um it must be that the moon landed on a
23:50
bit of the moon landed on earth and no
23:52
no just as in i'm
23:53
i'm genuinely asking the questions okay
23:55
of all the times that
23:57
humans have gone from the earth to
23:59
around the moon what's the shortest
24:00
amount of time it's taken
24:01
do you mean the full trip over here to
24:03
there from here to there
24:05
um i would think it would take a couple
24:08
of days
24:09
to get there so that's a long way
24:11
actually it's 250 000 miles can you take
24:13
i would say nine hours
24:16
oh that's so close is it um yeah eight
24:19
and a half hours
24:20
that's amazing in 2006 it was a new
24:22
horizons
24:23
probe so it didn't land on the moon but
24:25
it went from the earth to where the moon
24:26
is
24:27
in eight hours in eight and a half hours
24:29
that's crazy and
24:30
that was in 2006 and the longest ever
24:34
was in 2003
24:35
and that was one year one month and two
24:38
weeks
24:38
it took them to get from here well they
24:40
kept asking for directions on the way
24:42
people kept on messing around with them
24:45
that's very rocky terrain
24:49
um no that was a deliberate attempt to
24:52
do it with as little
24:53
kind of fuel as possible little
24:55
publicity or interest
24:57
how annoying to pull the short straw and
24:59
bid on the year-long one although i
25:01
suppose people weren't on these were
25:02
they
25:03
oh neither one were there any people
25:04
yeah would you think that a few hundred
25:05
years ago it would take
25:06
six months to get to australia and now
25:08
we can go to the moon
25:10
in eight hours yeah it's a substantial
25:12
change is what i'm saying
25:14
up until researching this particular
25:16
effect i would have said if i was asked
25:18
the question
25:19
does the earth get heavier or lighter
25:21
every year i would have said heavier you
25:23
would have said
25:23
yeah i know that but what did you say
25:28
yeah i would have said heavier because i
25:29
would have thought with the amount of
25:30
space dust and asteroids passing by we
25:32
always hear about stuff coming into
25:33
earth's atmosphere that we would get
25:34
heavier but in fact we do get lighter
25:36
and it's because of all the escaping gas
25:38
so we uh expel in terms of stuff out of
25:42
the atmosphere and
25:43
out of earth into space every year um
25:45
the equivalent weight of 890
25:47
000 humans wow how much goes out so
25:50
that's
25:50
50 000 tons uh that it gets lighter per
25:54
year and we only take on
25:55
40 000 uh from things entering the
25:57
atmosphere from space
25:59
wow and helium just goes out into space
26:02
i had no idea
26:03
yeah when you get a helium balloon and
26:05
you let go of it
26:06
that's where it goes i know well thank
26:08
god for balloons the moon is littered
26:10
with helium balloons i never appreciated
26:11
what a great invention balloons were
26:13
right here's the thing if you do let a
26:15
balloon go yeah where does it go
26:18
uh it goes up all the air leaks out of
26:20
it to make its way into space
26:22
and then the balloon uh falls down again
26:25
just pops and a bit of
26:26
plastic goes somewhere yeah and that
26:28
plastic often ends up in the sea
26:30
especially in the coastal resorts or
26:32
anything like that so a lot of places in
26:34
america
26:35
especially on the east coast have banned
26:37
helium balloons people letting helium
26:39
balloons go because it just causes so
26:40
much crap in the sea
26:42
oh really yeah it's very sensible yeah
26:43
it's good yeah it makes sense or you
26:45
should make all balloons out of fish
26:46
food
26:46
yeah biodegradable balloons oh yeah yeah
26:49
yeah that must be invented
26:51
you can make a puffer fish into a
26:53
balloon you could they do that they
26:55
just goes back and then you blow it up
26:57
with an air hose like anna's hilarious
26:59
mount rushmore prank you let the balloon
27:01
go and then it's bleeding and passing
27:03
all the gas it's
27:04
tough which is so funny and then then it
27:07
falls into sea and another fish can eat
27:08
it
27:09
they do that in check not the whole
27:10
story they don't see the plot lines
27:12
really bad
27:13
they turn the buffer fish into a balloon
27:20
[Music]
27:22
okay it is time for our final fact of
27:24
the show and that
27:25
is chelsinski my fact this week is that
27:29
the most deadly user of portuguese man
27:32
of war
27:32
venom is not the portuguese man of war
27:36
so the most deadly user of the
27:37
portuguese man of wars of venom
27:39
is something that's called a blue dragon
27:41
sea slug
27:42
which is the most beautiful creature if
27:44
you look it up
27:45
it's a kind of nudibranch which are
27:48
these little slug-like sea creatures
27:50
it's really lovely looking and what it
27:52
does is it goes and eats the venom on
27:54
the portuguese man of war
27:55
and then it has these special limbs
27:58
these special organs that are especially
27:59
for storing venom
28:00
and it pushes it out into these little
28:02
organs these finger-like branches
28:05
and it is more concentrated at the end
28:07
of those branches than it is in the
28:08
portuguese man of war and so
28:10
when it administers the venom to someone
28:12
it's actually more effective than when
28:14
the portuguese man of war does it it
28:16
makes it and it makes it better but it
28:17
doesn't it doesn't kill the portuguese
28:19
man of war
28:20
it just uses it like a gas station like
28:22
it goes up and it just fills up on its
28:24
venom so it
28:25
sucks it out and it hurts it as well
28:27
yeah it's like
28:28
um being hurt at a gas station
28:33
and that happens to me at quite a lot of
28:34
petrol stations because i always try to
28:36
haggle
28:37
so is it the so it's the nudibranch who
28:40
gets
28:40
hurt the nudibranch gets hurt it does
28:42
have special adaptations to stop it
28:44
being too badly injured by the poison
28:45
because it's really poisonous so it has
28:47
sort of special mucus
28:48
which helps to shield it a bit and then
28:50
yeah and then it adapts the stuff and
28:52
you can ask about nudibranch yeah
28:54
so you would think if you saw a drawing
28:56
in the first time i think most people
28:58
did see it was a drawing and it was from
28:59
captain cook's
29:00
um voyages it was the artist who did a
29:02
did an illustration of it um you would
29:04
think it's fake you would you'd think
29:06
that this was a made-up
29:07
uh sea creature um and it's phenomenal
29:09
because it
29:10
it swims upside down yeah so and that's
29:13
a kind of camouflage tactic and it
29:15
floats upside down
29:16
at the surface who's to say what's
29:18
upside down then if that's how it lives
29:20
its whole life
29:20
yes there's a good point so you're
29:22
saying maybe all other animals are wrong
29:25
no what i'm saying is if you if all
29:27
humans walked around with their head
29:28
near the floor and their feet in the air
29:31
then we would think that was the right
29:32
way up exactly yeah it's like saying to
29:34
a bat you sleep upside down but they do
29:36
because i always sleep i sleep yeah this
29:38
is the right way it's right up well why
29:39
are we launching this war on correct
29:41
placement of things you started it i did
29:44
not say
29:45
anything i just don't see that you can
29:47
say that he's
29:48
swimming upside down if he spends his
29:50
whole life upside down maybe that's the
29:52
correct way for him to live does he
29:53
spend his whole life upside down
29:55
i don't think so okay i think it so the
29:57
way he floats is he
29:58
inflates his stomach so i think maybe
30:00
it's all about what's the back and
30:02
what's the stomach and the way that this
30:03
guy floats is by
30:05
filling his stomach with gas and then he
30:07
bubbles up to the top of the
30:08
surface of the ocean and then he has his
30:11
stomach keeping him afloat
30:12
prime candidate for this new animal
30:14
balloon we've been talking about
30:17
well here's another thing about
30:18
nudibranch so they all have their anus
30:20
above their head
30:21
yeah which james is going to say is
30:23
perfectly normal and why don't we all do
30:24
it
30:25
no what i'm saying is maybe if you look
30:28
at him the other way up
30:29
which is how he wants to be looked then
30:31
his head is in a perfectly normal
30:32
position no
30:33
because they twist around as they grow
30:36
so they start off with their anus not
30:37
near their head and then as they grow i
30:39
think we talked about this with um
30:40
snails snails recently
30:41
so same thing they see slugs their body
30:44
twists 180 degrees
30:45
as they grow so their gills and their
30:47
anus end up right by their
30:49
who's to say that when they're a baby
30:51
nudibranch that they're not upside down
30:53
then
30:54
and they flipped to be the right way
30:55
around like us being born
30:57
in a handstand position and us realizing
30:59
this didn't feel so right
31:01
i'm just i can't wait for my anus to be
31:02
nearer my head is that what they're all
31:04
saying
31:06
can't wait for all the girls to fancy me
31:09
how close to my head my anus is
31:12
that would their parents must say to
31:14
them these really are the best days of
31:15
your life
31:17
you know enjoy this daze of distance
31:19
between your head and your anus
31:23
um there are uh nudibranchs which have
31:25
disposable penises
31:27
okay so they're hermaphrodites so they
31:29
both have a penis on their right hand
31:30
side so they stand next to each other
31:32
how do you know it's the right-hand side
31:34
[Laughter]
31:37
so they stand next to each other facing
31:39
in opposite directions and then they
31:40
sort of lock
31:41
their penises into each other and they
31:43
transfer sperm both ways
31:45
but then their penises break off and
31:46
fall to the ocean surface
31:48
do you think that's a really terrifying
31:50
moment the first time it happens
31:52
i imagine it only happens once no does
31:55
it
31:56
so they drop off fall to the bottom of
31:58
the sea and then within
32:00
24 hours sometimes they've regenerated a
32:02
new one
32:03
because most of their penis is a big
32:04
coil inside them and it just grows out
32:06
again oh cool
32:07
they would have noticed that when they
32:09
were a younger nudie branch alone in
32:11
their shell
32:12
uh having a little touch of themselves
32:16
i think a vigorous session might result
32:18
but
32:19
again the first time it happens it would
32:21
be terrifying that's true
32:23
you couldn't come back home after a
32:25
night out if you'd been
32:27
you know if you've been sleeping around
32:28
you couldn't come back home to your wife
32:30
and say oh nothing happened it's like
32:32
well why is your falling off then
32:37
so another nudibranch is a solar-powered
32:41
one
32:41
have you guys read about this one it's
32:43
so cool so it harvests it basically
32:46
farms algae
32:47
it eats algae and then uh it uses the
32:50
photosynthesis
32:51
of the algae so the algae inside it
32:53
photosynthesizes
32:54
using the sun and then this is what uh
32:57
this is what this nudibranc gets its
32:58
energy from
32:59
and it has these little solar panels so
33:00
if you look at it you can see these
33:02
little brown spots on it
33:03
which are the specific zones where it's
33:05
put its algae so that it can get the
33:07
light from the sun
33:08
so that it can photosynthesize aren't we
33:09
all solar powered
33:11
but we're not using photosynthesis as in
33:13
so they get the chloroplasts from the
33:15
seaweed like the little green bits and
33:18
that
33:19
turns the sunlight into energy wow
33:21
that's pretty much so they can live
33:22
for a year on sunlight alone wow
33:26
and you're right that all of our energy
33:27
eventually comes from the sun
33:29
yeah so like as humans were
33:30
solar-powered yeah yeah that's pretty
33:32
much never thought of being
33:33
solar-powered yeah
33:35
but i am well done
33:38
i think it's worth it's worth knowing
33:40
that about yourself yeah so
33:42
i grew up in australia uh in my after i
33:44
took the money and run from hong kong
33:47
and um along along the beaches you get
33:49
blue bottles and blue bottles
33:51
in reading up about portuguese man of
33:53
war are the same kind of thing it's the
33:55
same
33:55
kind of animal and i thought that was an
33:57
animal i thought it was a jellyfish so
33:58
i've just discovered today that
33:59
portuguese man of war is basically
34:01
a team effort of a bunch of different
34:04
creatures working as one
34:06
yeah like when the power rangers combine
34:08
to be that giant robot thing
34:10
it's like that's what a portuguese man
34:11
of war is yeah that's a really good
34:12
analogy actually
34:13
so i could i'm really confused about
34:15
this i i read somewhere that they were
34:17
different
34:17
species but they're not different
34:19
species they're different
34:21
kinds of animal in the same species all
34:24
working together
34:25
all having different things that they
34:27
specialize in so someone will be
34:29
responsible for the sex
34:30
fun job someone's responsible for the
34:31
digestion also quite a fun job
34:34
and then there's probably someone
34:34
responsible for sort of pointing and
34:36
stuff which is probably that's fun
34:38
but yeah it's like they're called cyphon
34:39
of cyphonophores yeah syphonophores
34:42
um and yeah it's a bunch of tiny
34:43
organisms which all perform
34:46
yeah they do i never thought about their
34:48
name before
34:49
and why they're called that and they're
34:51
called that because they look like a
34:52
portuguese man or like a sailing boat
34:54
and um they really do and they've got
34:56
this kind of sail that sticks up out of
34:58
the water
34:59
and it performs the purpose of a sail
35:01
which i didn't know so the way they get
35:02
around
35:03
is by you know acting like that's
35:05
amazing sailing around by sticking the
35:07
sail up in the water under water
35:09
all the way above the water water they
35:11
have a surface sail that
35:12
gets them into places the sail sticks up
35:14
above the water it catches the wind and
35:15
then another good
35:17
candidate for the balloon um they can
35:18
deflate their sail if they see
35:20
a threat coming along like a turtle and
35:23
then they re-inflate it
35:24
that's amazing so you know how some
35:26
animals are unbelievably poisonous to
35:28
humans
35:28
yeah there are frogs that can kill a
35:30
thousand people with a single thing
35:32
yeah i was reading an article about why
35:34
this is the case like why is it useful
35:36
for a frog to be able to kill a thousand
35:37
people yeah
35:38
with a single thing and the really
35:40
interesting thing it's not useful at all
35:42
right it just happens that we're
35:44
measuring how many humans
35:46
something could kill or a snake can kill
35:47
a quarter of a million mice
35:49
it would be pointless for the snake but
35:50
the thing is animals always adapt their
35:53
poison
35:53
to what they're hunting right so there
35:55
are loads of for example hedgehogs that
35:58
could survive
35:59
a bite from a snake which would kill a
36:01
person
36:02
uh much much bigger but hedgehogs and
36:04
snakes are in an arms race
36:05
of who's going to develop more poison or
36:07
better poison resistance right
36:09
right so if you find a snake which is
36:12
unbelievably poisonous you can bet
36:13
there's probably a little rodent out
36:15
there
36:15
which is unbelievably tough and could
36:17
take a huge amount of poison
36:19
uh before dying so i wonder with those
36:21
little kind of
36:22
tiny little colourful frogs that live in
36:24
the amazon yeah
36:26
what you're saying is there's some
36:27
animal there that is super hardcore that
36:30
you just can't poison
36:31
yeah but we don't know what it feeds on
36:33
them that is
36:34
nearly resistant to their poison maybe
36:36
and so they're having to constantly
36:37
become more poisonous
36:38
wow you know the brazilian wandering
36:40
spider can give you when it bites you an
36:42
erection
36:43
so intense that you become impotent
36:46
that is tough isn't it what joe's found
36:50
what i think is the best headline of the
36:52
year so far i know we're just into uh
36:54
early february but it was that um what
36:57
was it james it was
36:58
it was something like um mafia boss with
37:00
permanent
37:01
erection arrested yes i'm finally
37:03
arrested
37:05
permanent erection finally arrested and
37:07
um
37:08
he has a disease that means that he has
37:10
a permanent erection and so
37:11
throughout the whole article they're
37:12
talking about his court case and he's
37:14
sitting
37:14
in court it says with bag of ice on his
37:17
genitals
37:18
he's just from an erection he didn't
37:20
want it to stand up and cut it
37:29
okay that's it that's all of our facts
37:30
thank you so much for listening if you'd

[Music]
38:17
you

=151
00:00
[Music]
00:14
hello
00:15
and welcome to another episode of no
00:17
such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
00:19
coming to you from the qi offices in
00:21
covent garden
00:22
my name is dan schreiber and i'm sitting
00:24
here with james harkin
00:25
andrew hunter murray and anna chazinski
00:28
and once again we have gathered around
00:29
the microphones with our four
00:31
favorite facts from the last seven days
00:33
and in no particular order
00:35
here we go starting with you anna
00:37
chazinski
00:38
my fact this week is that a frog's
00:40
tongue is ten
00:41
times softer than a human's tongue i
00:44
thought we had soft tongues already
00:46
and yeah you'd be very lucky in your
00:48
love life
00:50
does this mean that french kissing a
00:51
frog would be unbelievably good or
00:53
unbelievably bad
00:54
yeah because you don't want too much
00:55
give there do you i don't know
00:58
it really depends on your personal taste
01:00
but it doesn't use it for kissing when
01:01
the princess kisses the frog in the
01:02
story
01:03
does she french kiss it and if so does
01:06
she notice that its tongue is
01:07
unbelievably soft that was probably in
01:08
the original draft after that she kissed
01:10
she went what the is that
01:13
actually i do remember that in one of
01:15
the really early versions of that
01:17
like in the old french versions of that
01:18
thing i think she has sex with the frog
01:20
to turn him into a prisoner
01:21
i think so but unfortunately he finds
01:23
the frog's penis is
01:25
10 times softer than humans
01:27
[Laughter]
01:30
so 10 times softer that's pretty jelly
01:33
it's soft
01:34
yeah yeah it's soft it's because it's so
01:36
that they can catch
01:37
their prey effectively so if we stuck
01:40
our tongue out and
01:41
bashed it into a fly then then we'd bash
01:44
the fly away from us but a frog's tongue
01:46
is soft enough that if it bashes its
01:48
tongue into a flight it sort of um
01:50
molds into the various crevices of the
01:52
cricket or whatever it is
01:54
and then it can retract and pull it back
01:56
in and it does this by having an
01:57
extremely soft tongue
01:59
and it also does it by having this
02:00
incredible saliva so frog saliva
02:03
is 50 000 times more viscous so 50
02:06
000 times stickier than ours so that
02:08
means if you do french kiss a frog it's
02:10
going to be hard to get away
02:12
yeah that's true so if a frog was
02:14
licking stamps to put on
02:16
that would be really solidly stuck on
02:18
right yeah and so in the early days of
02:19
the post office then every letter came
02:21
with a frog attached
02:22
they employed them at first it's
02:24
incredible but the thing is that it
02:26
changes doesn't it
02:27
so it starts off like incredibly thick
02:30
honey
02:31
and then when it's on the tongue and
02:32
then when it hits the insect for a
02:34
moment
02:35
it liquefies covers the insect
02:37
completely like gets
02:38
it gets around every angle of it every
02:39
nook every cranny so the insect is
02:41
completely covered in it
02:42
and then it hardens again and then the
02:44
frog pulls it back in how is that
02:46
well it evolves over time i know but i
02:48
mean it's incredible to think of that
02:50
evolving
02:51
and i can't believe that we've never
02:52
bothered to look into it before it's
02:53
such a common trope the idea of a frog
02:55
darting out his tongue and grabbing an
02:56
insect and we've only just bothered to
02:57
work out how they do it but there's so
02:59
many things that do that right like
03:00
chameleons
03:01
yeah so there's a lot of animals yeah so
03:02
i wonder if they do the same thing they
03:04
don't
03:04
they do it in a slightly different way
03:06
yeah they evolve separately
03:07
i think like salamanders they have like
03:10
a kind of a skeletal
03:11
bit attached to the tongue which fires
03:13
it out and the frog just kind of drops
03:15
its jaw really really quickly and that
03:17
flicks it out
03:18
like a flicky thing because when i was
03:21
reading the paper so that's quite a
03:22
different description to what i read
03:23
about how the tongue is used when it
03:25
when it
03:25
darts out in order to catch prey and
03:27
they said that effectively what it was
03:29
doing was it's acting almost like a
03:30
bungee cord
03:31
so it's gripping on to the prey and just
03:34
sucking it back in a very
03:35
kind of mild manner as opposed to like a
03:38
whip yeah like as if you were coming
03:40
back up on the bungee kind of weird
03:41
bungee jumps have you done where you
03:42
stand on the ground
03:43
and you wait for a bungee rope to
03:47
even more exciting you jump off the
03:49
cliff without a bungee rope and then it
03:51
comes down and grabs you
03:52
and pulls you up that'd be pretty
03:54
exciting amazing do you know how they
03:56
found this out the science the scientist
03:58
who did this as a phd student
04:00
called alexis knowl and she said i
04:02
actually got 15 frogs and scraped their
04:03
tongues for a couple of hours one night
04:05
it was pretty disgusting and she said it
04:07
takes about half an hour to get a
04:09
milliliter
04:10
of frog saliva off their tongue yeah she
04:13
says it's like the world's most precious
04:14
material
04:15
yeah because it's so hard to get and you
04:17
get so little of it once you've done
04:18
that
04:18
but i don't think that necessarily makes
04:20
it precious well it depends on her time
04:23
doesn't it if she
04:24
charges like two million dollars an hour
04:26
and it takes her that long
04:28
and it is really precious but if she's
04:30
you know on minimum wage it's probably
04:31
not that precious she's probably
04:32
somewhere in between
04:33
[Laughter]
04:36
well she works under dr david who uh he
04:39
was the guy who came up with the idea
04:40
that all
04:41
animals or all mammals urinate for the
04:43
same amount of time around 21 seconds
04:47
have we yeah he's won the nick nobel
04:50
prize
04:51
we met him at the ignoble show in london
04:53
oh oh yes we did
04:55
yes we spoke to him afterwards he gave
04:56
us his card you're right sorry david
04:59
is he a doctor he's doctor who yeah nice
05:01
yeah
05:02
that's very cool he said of the frog's
05:04
tongue that it's like a trampoline
05:06
and a baseball mitt and then it
05:07
stretches catches you and then pulls
05:09
back
05:10
and the bungee cord yeah and there's a
05:11
lot of metaphors going on here
05:14
well the other metaphor is on the
05:15
softness of the tongue uh they said it's
05:17
like
05:18
freshly chewed chewing gum about that
05:20
same stickiness and
05:21
kind of softness okay and also
05:23
marshmallow fluff
05:24
you know if you get like a tea cake and
05:25
you get marshmallow in your hands you
05:26
just can't get it off like that
05:28
oh my god i wonder if marshmallow fluff
05:29
works like this and actually if you
05:31
bashed it really hard it would suddenly
05:33
turn to liquid and you could
05:34
get it off you'll finally be able to
05:36
catch all those flies you've been
05:37
looking for
05:38
do you know when the frog gets its
05:40
tongue back in its mouth as well it's
05:42
then it has a problem which is that my
05:44
saliva is like honey and it's incredibly
05:45
sticky and i've got this fly on my
05:46
tongue and i can't get it off
05:48
so do know what they have to do they
05:49
have to push their eyeballs down
05:51
into their head onto their tongue to
05:53
scrape the fly off
05:54
well it's not to scrape it because i
05:56
think we might have mentioned the
05:57
eyeballs thing before but i think
05:58
they've just realized why that works
06:00
because that's the same thing i think
06:01
the eyeballs
06:02
bash into it and it's the impact that
06:05
turns it into this very very liquid
06:07
thing
06:07
so what is it it's a non-newtonian fluid
06:09
which we've talked about before
06:11
so it's like quicksand whereby whenever
06:14
you
06:14
agitate it it changes it's viscosity but
06:16
it's like the opposite of custard it's
06:18
so it's a non-eutectic fluid but it has
06:20
the opposite effect
06:21
ketchup is the same as frog saliva what
06:24
what do you mean
06:25
the same it's a non-italian fluid as
06:27
well but this way round so that's why if
06:29
you bash a glass ketchup bottle
06:31
then it will suddenly come flowing out
06:33
because if you hit it hard enough then
06:35
the viscosity of the liquid suddenly
06:36
changes i was looking into
06:38
tongues generally and we don't know how
06:41
bats
06:41
drink we're still we're still looking
06:43
into how bats drink
06:45
and one of the things that they notice
06:46
is that they use their tongue as a sort
06:48
of conveyor belt
06:49
to bring the liquid up what does that
06:51
mean it means that the
06:52
the tongue sort of it hasn't is it is it
06:56
on rollers yeah
06:59
how does that work i don't know dan i
07:00
think you don't know how bad tongues
07:02
work
07:03
i think you've slightly misunderstood
07:04
this story it says no it says
07:07
uh scientists uh they use their tugs as
07:10
a kind of
07:11
conveyor belt to slurp up nectar i think
07:13
the key bit there is kind of
07:15
okay because the amazing thing about it
07:16
being conveyed would be if it wound all
07:18
the way around on its rotor and came
07:20
back out which is hard to believe
07:21
they do um have you heard the myth about
07:23
dog mouths
07:25
uh is it that they're cleaner than human
07:27
mouths yes ah because i had not heard
07:29
the smith until
07:30
the what i was researching this fact um
07:32
but there is a myth
07:33
that dog males are cleaner than human
07:35
males and that it's fine as a result to
07:36
french kiss them and it's okay
07:38
i think what happens is now you've read
07:40
into this so you might know but i think
07:41
there might be fewer bacteria but the
07:43
point is that they're all bacteria that
07:45
you don't already have in your mouth
07:47
yes and probably you don't really want
07:48
in your mouth yeah so
07:50
there was an article on abc news where
07:51
they spoke to a vet and said
07:53
it may be safer because lots of the
07:54
bacteria are specie-specific
07:56
so you can't catch the same strep from a
07:59
dog that you could from a person
08:00
however i did read also articles like uh
08:03
i almost died
08:04
after a dog saliva infection so i think
08:06
it's not recommended
08:07
well especially a rabid dog that can oh
08:10
yeah yeah
08:11
if you get rabid dog saliva and you've
08:13
got any kind of cuts in your mouth then
08:15
you'll catch rabies from that
08:17
and they used to try to uh weaponize
08:19
this
08:20
so i think um alien as he called he's a
08:23
roman writer
08:24
um he wrote that um if a rabid dog
08:27
saliva
08:28
could get into contact with someone then
08:29
they would get rabies leonardo da vinci
08:31
thought that this might be a good idea
08:33
to use in war
08:34
and there was a polish general called
08:37
kasamir
08:38
cimenovich um who thought that he would
08:40
get the slobber from rabid dogs put them
08:42
in clay balls and fire them into
08:44
like towns that sieged is the hope that
08:47
people will
08:48
find the clay bottles on the ground and
08:49
think what is this i must put it in my
08:51
mouth
08:51
or is it that they can fire into
08:53
people's mouths like it just seems like
08:55
such an inefficient distribution message
08:57
they were firing into towns of toddlers
08:58
you could just pick them all
09:00
up and try to eat them you're right they
09:02
should put it in like a
09:04
an easter egg or something yeah exactly
09:06
something really crafty like that and
09:07
then leave a load of easter eggs outside
09:08
saying sorry about this siege going on a
09:10
bit isn't it
09:11
some easter eggs but our official advice
09:14
is don't snog your dog right
09:16
i think yeah that's mine even if it
09:18
might be safe even if you've got a very
09:19
clean dog
09:20
even if it's safe it's weird yeah
09:24
i have one more thing uh which is that
09:25
gray whales this is so cool they use
09:27
their tongues really cleverly to control
09:30
their heat loss
09:31
so they've always got mouths full of
09:33
extremely cold ocean water right
09:34
so they might lose a massive amount of
09:37
heat that way and that would
09:38
uh they might die as a result of if they
09:41
had a really warm tongue
09:42
so what happens is the arteries that
09:45
take blood to their tongue right
09:47
are really close to the veins carrying
09:48
blood away from the tongue and as the
09:50
arteries get close to the tongue
09:52
they transfer all the heat over
09:55
from the artery going to the tongue to
09:57
the vein heading back from the tongue
09:58
right
09:59
so the blood on its way to the tongue
10:01
cools down yeah and the blood on its way
10:03
back
10:03
to the heart warms up and it's it sounds
10:05
kind of like
10:06
a um like a conveyor belt it doesn't
10:09
look like
10:09
that actually yeah so when it gets to
10:12
the when it gets to the end of the
10:13
tongue
10:14
or when it gets to the tongue it's
10:15
incredibly cold already this blood
10:17
so the whale doesn't lose massive
10:18
amounts of heat because its tongue is
10:20
constantly in contact with really cold
10:21
water clever isn't that crafty there is
10:23
i don't know if it's this whale but
10:24
there is some kind of whale that can
10:25
thermoregulate in that way but by
10:28
it has erectile tissue in its tongue and
10:30
so it can kind of engorge it with blood
10:33
in the way that an erection would and so
10:35
they would kind of
10:36
if they need to cool down they get a
10:38
massive kind of erection in the mouth
10:39
in their tongue and that will cool them
10:41
down what are you laughing at andy
10:43
just remembering a joke someone told me
10:45
um
10:46
do you want to just know how you can
10:47
tell if you're an extrovert or an
10:49
introvert
10:49
by your saliva yeah sure if you are
10:52
constantly leaving it in other people's
10:54
mouths you're an extrovert
10:55
[Laughter]
10:58
so there's a study that was done i think
10:59
in the 60s but i think it's been
11:01
replicated that showed that introverts
11:02
salivate more
11:03
so when you put drops of lemon on the
11:05
tongue of people who are
11:07
introverted by character they produce
11:09
more saliva and it kind of makes sense
11:11
because people who are introverts tend
11:12
to react more strongly to certain kind
11:14
of stimulation so they should
11:15
make sense if you're constantly
11:17
slobbering that you don't want to spend
11:19
a lot of time with me
11:22
every time you open your mouth you spit
11:23
in someone's face you start to stop
11:25
speaking
11:27
well so apparently this works if you're
11:29
not sure if you're an introvert or an
11:30
extrovert
11:31
um it's not the easiest way to tell but
11:33
you get a cotton
11:34
bud you tie a little bit of thread to
11:36
the exact middle
11:37
so that when you hold it by the thread
11:39
it hangs horizontally
11:40
and then you put one end of the tip in
11:42
your mouth for 20 seconds and take it
11:44
out
11:44
and then you put lemon juice on your
11:47
tongue and then you put the other end of
11:48
the tip on your mouth for another 20
11:50
seconds
11:50
so you're seeing how much you're
11:52
salivating in response to the lemon
11:54
juice
11:54
and then you hold it by the thread and
11:57
if it's hanging horizontally still it
11:58
means you haven't salivated much which
12:00
means you're an extrovert
12:01
and if it tilts it means you've
12:03
salivated quite a lot so the
12:05
end one end is heavier now it's a lot to
12:07
do to tell you something that presumably
12:09
you kind of already know
12:10
if you've got the time to do this you're
12:12
an introvert
12:15
[Music]
12:20
okay there's time for fact number two
12:22
and that is andy my fact is that during
12:24
the second world war
12:26
britain invented chocolate bars infused
12:28
with garlic
12:29
to give to pilots who were shot down and
12:31
needed to make their breath
12:32
authentically french
12:35
so it's the idea that you land in france
12:37
yeah and you meet someone
12:39
yeah and they say are you french
12:42
and you just breathe on them and they go
12:43
oh you must be french then
12:45
yeah not actually to speak french they
12:46
don't ask you why you're wearing an raf
12:48
uniform
12:48
[Laughter]
12:51
so this gets written about quite a lot
12:53
i've tried to find concrete evidence of
12:55
pilots actually being given these bars
12:57
and using them and i haven't found much
12:59
i i do know that it was invented as a
13:01
thing because
13:02
uh it's written about a load of times
13:04
there was a guy called charles fraser
13:05
smith
13:06
who was kind of uh one of the original
13:08
inspirations of q
13:09
in the james bond films okay so that's
13:12
this guy
13:12
and uh he did invent these things as
13:14
well as loads of other incredible stuff
13:16
yeah but i can't find out whether it was
13:18
put into operation in the field why
13:19
didn't he just give them
13:21
garlic it's not as though well it's not
13:23
as though garlic goes especially well
13:25
with chocolate anyway and b
13:27
raf pilots in world war ii would be
13:29
undergoing a lot of like physical
13:31
trauma and challenges every day i
13:33
wouldn't thought they're going to have a
13:34
problem with just eating a couple of
13:35
cloves of garlic that's not going to be
13:37
the final straw no but this let's
13:38
say this guy was james bond's q right
13:41
yeah
13:42
so q never just he there was always a
13:44
double thing to the invention
13:46
it's a pen that doubles as a so you
13:48
would be like it's just garlic you'd be
13:49
like
13:50
and doubles as a chocolate bar
13:53
that's cute it's not garlic that doubles
13:56
as a chocolate bar
13:57
well it's a chocolate bar yeah garlic
13:59
flavored yeah
14:00
i'm just saying but is it isn't it um a
14:02
lot of people that go
14:04
on uh missions isn't chocolate a thing
14:06
of sustenance so maybe he was trying to
14:07
double up the sustenance with the
14:09
so again hugh's mind is working there
14:12
he's doubling up
14:13
yeah i'm very good yeah it's a great
14:16
idea
14:16
yeah this was in the news because there
14:18
was a very recent story mi6 announced
14:19
that their current
14:20
queue is a woman hmm which surprised a
14:23
lot of people because they thought it
14:24
was still desmond lewellen from the
14:25
james bond films
14:26
but he doubles up as a woman
14:30
did they tell us who these people are
14:32
well yeah i think it's bizarre that you
14:33
know who the head of mi5 and how my sex
14:35
is yeah i do as well
14:36
really probably aren't the real ones
14:38
they can't be right like stella
14:40
remington couldn't have been
14:41
the head head i think she was i
14:43
mentioned she was but
14:44
on what james is saying i think then you
14:47
can't
14:47
there must been someone who is actually
14:49
is going to be there's going to be
14:51
someone who if you ask them they will
14:52
just
14:52
not be able to say anything i don't know
14:55
what if stella everton listens to this
14:57
podcast and she's sitting at home
14:58
feeling bad now
15:00
what she's she's fine she probably she's
15:02
the fake head
15:04
i don't think we could say people are
15:05
fake
15:07
all i'm saying is if i was in charge i
15:09
would make stella remington the fake one
15:11
and then have a real one
15:12
yes but she'd know at some point that
15:14
she was the fake one after
15:16
well yeah she's no longer she's in on it
15:17
oh she's she doesn't think she's running
15:19
the show with secretly this
15:21
oh she's in on it she's an actor called
15:24
maureen
15:26
maureen littman yeah well people are
15:28
going to recognize her there they'll say
15:29
i saw
15:30
that stella remington in a bt yeah
15:34
she should be looking after the
15:35
country's safety not not clocking off
15:37
and doing bt adverts
15:38
and then there'd be a scandal i love the
15:41
bt adverts that's
15:42
a reference from the early 80s
15:46
the last thing i can remember
15:49
well she's going to be feeling sad at
15:51
home because you haven't been keeping up
15:52
with her career
15:54
so i don't think that you need to be
15:56
secret unless you're in the field
15:58
it's not a thing i would assume well
16:00
stella remington was the first
16:02
uh person that they openly acknowledged
16:04
as the head
16:05
so that was a transparency thing that
16:07
came in with one of the governments
16:09
uh who decided transparency was a thing
16:11
so they did keep them secret okay yeah
16:13
that's not always been known that was
16:15
the thing that i think we've mentioned
16:16
on a previous podcast
16:17
and i don't know i think we almost
16:19
mentioned it as an urban myth the idea
16:21
of
16:22
the spy who was pregnant and they
16:24
discovered that she was a spy
16:25
when she was delivering the baby because
16:27
the pain was so great she started
16:29
swearing
16:30
in her own language is that a myth
16:32
because i
16:33
don't know no no i thought you meant
16:34
that the baby came out and started
16:36
speaking russian
16:40
[Laughter]
16:43
it's a great myth or i mean if it's true
16:46
says it might be true um only that i've
16:48
heard it and i've never personally
16:50
questioned it but it might yeah it does
16:52
have the whiff of the
16:52
ring doesn't it yeah um do you guys know
16:54
about operation lena
16:56
no no so this was a a german operation
17:00
this was in 1940
17:02
and it was when 12 german spies were
17:04
sent to britain as
17:05
to like do a bit of a recce uh to plan
17:08
hitler's follow-up operation which is
17:10
going to be operation sea lion which is
17:11
going to be the invasion of britain
17:13
and so they were trained up as to how to
17:15
appear british apparently train trained
17:17
up to blend right in
17:18
and they were caught straight away
17:20
because of their own stupidity was what
17:22
the british officials said
17:23
one of them went into a pub and ordered
17:25
a pint of cider at 10 in the morning
17:27
and which is a weird thing to do in any
17:29
situation i can't think of anything more
17:31
british
17:32
yeah you go to gatwick in heathrow
17:33
airport you'll see a lot of german spies
17:36
there you haven't been to my local
17:37
weather spoons
17:39
so you could you would normally drink
17:41
pints of cider at 10 in the morning
17:42
obviously because it's britain but in
17:43
wartime you weren't allowed to serve
17:45
alcohol before midday
17:47
because i don't know maybe they wanted
17:48
people to be accomplished
17:50
and so they immediately knew and another
17:52
couple was stopped because they were
17:53
cycling through scotland on the wrong
17:54
side of the road hadn't bothered to
17:56
research which side of the road you were
17:57
supposed to drive on
17:58
so police apprehended them and said
18:00
you're on the wrong side of the road
18:01
that's a bit suspicious
18:02
can we search your bags in their bags
18:04
they found german sausages
18:06
and um some nivea hand cream which was
18:09
german brand
18:10
now if they'd only been given a sausage
18:12
which doubled up as a scone and gave
18:14
them scone breasts oh that's
18:15
a cumberland sausage yeah they should
18:18
have just bent their sausages into a
18:20
spiral
18:20
yeah yeah that's all you need to do oh
18:22
they said what's this sausage
18:24
and they go oh no my blood sausage has
18:26
unraveled itself
18:27
[Laughter]
18:31
[Music]
18:34
okay it is time for fact number three
18:36
and that is my fact
18:38
my fact this week is that a komodo
18:40
dragon can taste its meal two and a half
18:42
miles before it gets
18:44
to the restaurant stop saying restaurant
18:47
you put that in the wording in the email
18:49
and i thought dan will change the
18:51
wording for the natural thing
18:52
well no i mean it's not a restaurant is
18:54
it it's not an actual
18:56
no i have no problem with the wedding
18:57
den all it is is basically is that
18:59
komodo dragons have the ability to use
19:01
their
19:02
tongue to sample air and they can taste
19:04
the meal
19:05
as it were the carcass that might be
19:07
laying two and a half miles away
19:08
from that distance and know exactly
19:10
where to go but it's not as if it can
19:12
just sense where it is it can actually
19:13
taste and be like
19:15
tastes good and head on over get excited
19:18
by it so um
19:19
it collects these uh particles these
19:21
scent particles inside what's known as
19:22
the jacobson's organ which is just above
19:25
its nose and it's like a little
19:26
analyzing station where it just
19:28
like it like analyzes it and then gives
19:30
them a result and says
19:31
tasty and so they head that way you can
19:34
smell something
19:35
as a human and not know exactly where it
19:38
is yes they
19:38
if they're getting a particle hitting
19:40
the left side of their tongue as opposed
19:41
to the right
19:42
they will know to head over here yeah oh
19:45
that's cool yeah yeah yeah
19:46
so that's how these particles on the
19:47
yeah because they've got a forked tongue
19:48
and so
19:49
the right and left interesting um in
19:52
fish
19:53
i think in sharks um people kind of
19:56
think they might do that with
19:57
sharks but one other way that they might
19:59
do it is they get a little molecule of
20:01
blood
20:02
and they think okay there's something
20:04
that's bleeding around here and they
20:05
just follow the current because they
20:06
know the blood must have come through a
20:08
current
20:09
so if there's water coming towards them
20:10
they'll just follow the water in that
20:12
direction and they'll find it
20:13
people aren't quite sure i think that's
20:15
really cool yeah okay i would have
20:16
assumed that they're following actually
20:18
the blood
20:19
smell and they've they've located it but
20:20
actually they're using the science of
20:22
how it arrived to them but what you
20:23
could do is if you are bitten
20:25
if you are bleeding in the water you
20:26
could get your blood and throw it
20:28
downstream and hopefully trick the shark
20:31
that's
20:31
true into thinking i'm trying to work
20:33
out where you'd have to throw your blood
20:35
to save you
20:36
it would have to be in front of you
20:37
wouldn't it yeah if you threw it down
20:39
would it flow right back to you oh yeah
20:42
if you throw it right to the top up
20:44
straight up sorry it'll flow back down
20:47
to where you are and if you throw it
20:48
downstream you're just speeding up the
20:49
process
20:50
there's no way you can throw it to save
20:52
yourself you could throw it to the side
20:53
yeah so five minutes later a shark will
20:55
arrive next to you
20:58
and we'll be foxed completely oh well
21:00
nothing here
21:02
[Laughter]
21:05
dragons are amazing yeah that's so cool
21:08
yeah they're awesome
21:08
they're massive they're they're 10 feet
21:10
long up to 10 feet long they're really
21:13
heavy small when they're babies
21:14
smaller when they're babies they live in
21:16
trees when they're babies yeah
21:17
so usually you would think i need to
21:19
escape a komodo dragon by climbing a
21:20
tree
21:21
they're already up there do you know why
21:23
they climb up trees
21:24
uh no it's partly to avoid being eaten
21:26
by their own parents
21:28
is it kimono dragons are really uh
21:30
savage things yeah and so they either
21:32
climb a tree
21:32
or if they have to be on the ground they
21:34
roll around in excrement
21:37
which is apparently unappealing if your
21:39
food is rolled in excrement i've never
21:40
found that but
21:42
the um the thing about if you climb up a
21:44
tree and there's baby komodo's there
21:45
they won't eat you
21:46
i don't think because there's a really
21:49
weird thing about komodo dragons
21:50
where the baby ones will eat little
21:52
rodents and stuff like that and the
21:54
adult ones will go for much bigger prey
21:56
but the baby ones won't go for the
21:58
bigger prey and the adult ones won't go
22:00
off the smaller prey
22:01
and it's when they reach 20 kilograms
22:03
approximately not exactly but around 20
22:05
kilograms
22:06
all of a sudden they just switch so just
22:09
overnight they just stop going for the
22:10
little guys and go for the big guys
22:12
wow i know do you think that's really
22:13
killed a lot of friendships in the
22:14
komodo dragon world
22:16
overnight yeah you think when some
22:18
people kind of
22:19
you know reach puberty before the others
22:21
yeah exactly
22:22
did you guys all stop being friends with
22:24
people when they reached puberty
22:26
they just i wasn't really interested in
22:28
chasing rodents anymore
22:30
check this out komodo dragons they eat
22:33
only about 12 times a year they really
22:35
eat huge amounts in one chunk in fact
22:37
they can eat up to
22:38
80 percent of their body weight and
22:41
because they eat so much
22:42
one of the problems that they have is
22:44
that the food can start rotting inside
22:46
them before they digest it so they need
22:48
to go they do a thing where they go in
22:49
the sun
22:50
so that some reason the sun rays help
22:52
them to digest
22:53
quicker and must do some stuff to their
22:55
skin but they're
22:56
also in a sort of rush when they're
22:59
eating the carcasses
23:00
and they've been observed to have
23:02
slammed themselves
23:03
against trees the carcass in between so
23:06
that they can
23:07
thrust it down their throat quicker so
23:10
they'll often knock down trees as
23:11
they're eating
23:12
because they're slamming into it so what
23:14
with food in their mouth they're bashing
23:15
their food
23:17
down their throat because they're going
23:18
to treat while it's in their mouth i
23:20
don't know
23:20
if that's connected but they certainly
23:21
are impatient it's kind of like
23:23
eating a yogurt but just keeping it in
23:25
your mouth for three days yes
23:27
and then it goes off yeah exactly
23:30
it is like that wasn't that nuts they're
23:32
literally forcing it by slamming
23:34
into a tree i didn't know that we didn't
23:37
really have any evidence that komodo
23:38
dragons existed until i think
23:40
1906. yeah it was the early 1900s there
23:42
were kind of stories about them but then
23:44
people always used to embellish stories
23:45
so people would say i found this massive
23:47
dragon and then everyone said it
23:48
breathes fire and it flies and then
23:50
we just didn't believe them but yeah you
23:52
didn't know about them for 100 years
23:53
and only so yes it was the early 1900s
23:56
and then
23:56
they gave birth really to the idea of
23:59
king kong
24:00
oh yeah yeah which i i didn't know until
24:03
i read this
24:04
so the producer of king kong had read
24:05
the story of w
24:07
w douglas burden and w douglas broden
24:10
had gone over and he was the first
24:11
person to properly film komodo dragons
24:13
bring back a few
24:14
live komodo dragons as well as samples
24:16
of dead ones that they'd shot while
24:17
they're out there
24:18
and uh he went out with his wife and he
24:20
had basically the scenes that you see in
24:22
king kong where they go to skull island
24:24
to begin with
24:25
is the kind of same setup of what they
24:27
had wait did he tie his wife to a tree
24:29
to draw a komodo dragon
24:31
no but she almost got killed by komodo
24:33
dragon while she was out there
24:34
yeah she was she went out without her
24:36
gun one day and she was walking past a
24:38
carcass that was laid out for a komodo
24:40
dragon that they were hoping to attract
24:42
and one was coming so suddenly she was
24:44
between the carcass and the komodo
24:46
dragon
24:46
and she laid down in the tall grass and
24:49
really hoped that it hadn't seen her
24:51
but she also suspected that it had um
24:53
and smelt her and so she accepted her
24:55
death and just laid there because she
24:56
knew it was that close
24:57
and five feet away the komodo dragon as
25:00
it was coming towards her was shot by
25:01
one of the assistants
25:02
of burden so she survived she didn't
25:05
deserve to survive
25:07
who just lies down and takes it at least
25:09
try and make a run for it well she just
25:11
knew there was no way
25:12
there
25:16
well they've just discovered them they
25:17
don't know what their abilities are this
25:18
is like a line
25:20
what kind of survival instinct is that
25:22
she just said i'm dead she's wearing a
25:24
goat to have me i'm good complete idiot
25:25
that would work against some animals
25:27
though wouldn't it
25:27
they're playing dead yeah i never big
25:30
risk brown players and black bears
25:32
there's a different one of them i think
25:34
brown bears
25:35
nothing works because they're faster
25:37
they can climb trees and they can just
25:39
beat you okay and then with black bears
25:41
i think you're supposed to kind of take
25:42
your clothes off and slowly walk away
25:44
from them so that they get
25:46
confused about what your clothes are
25:47
you're just trying to make me have an
25:48
embarrassing bear
25:53
noted pervert andrew hunter murray
25:56
[Laughter]
26:00
back on the way they taste things so
26:01
they have this fork tongue and they
26:03
stick it out and it gets like all the
26:04
chemicals and information from the air
26:06
and then they retract it into their
26:07
mouth and they rub it into pads on the
26:10
bottom of their mouth and then they have
26:12
to close their mouth and the pads on the
26:14
bottom of their mouth touch the top of
26:16
their mouth
26:16
and that contains an organ that gives it
26:18
to their brain so every time they want
26:19
to taste something
26:20
you get it on your tongue put it on the
26:21
bottom of your mouth close your mouth
26:23
put it on the top of your mouth it just
26:24
seems like a real pilate it's a hassle
26:26
that does but that does seem like a
26:27
connoisseur as well it does doesn't it
26:30
yeah why a professional feels like
26:31
someone's really tasting their face so
26:32
in your mythical komodo dragon
26:34
restaurant yeah
26:35
there'll be a lot of consideration going
26:36
on yeah and getting notes of carcass
26:39
but also excrement maybe that's why she
26:42
laid still as well she thought i mean
26:44
how often do you change your mind about
26:46
the restaurant you're going to
26:47
as soon as you get up to it and see a
26:48
better one next door yes she knew she
26:50
was bad tasting yeah exactly two and a
26:52
half miles away this komodo dragon made
26:54
it booking
26:54
yeah he's on his way we sure she wasn't
26:56
lying still covering herself in feces
26:58
she probably was
26:59
[Laughter]
27:02
so there is a thing um their metabolisms
27:04
are really slow reptiles as we know
27:05
because they're
27:07
as we say cold-blooded but their muscles
27:09
can stay working for hours after death
27:10
so there was an atlantic article all
27:12
about the process of dissecting a komodo
27:14
dragon
27:14
which is very hard you go through loads
27:16
and loads of knives because their skin
27:17
is so tough really
27:18
yeah and one of the students who was
27:20
doing it uh called viv allen said that
27:22
she'd been studying an alligator which
27:23
had been shot had a massive hole in his
27:25
head
27:26
and she stuck a knife into the alligator
27:28
and it walked off the table
27:31
and they freaked out obviously because
27:33
it was dead but
27:35
their metabolisms are so slow that their
27:36
muscles can stay working for hours and
27:38
if you hit the right nerve center
27:40
you can trigger lots of muscular
27:42
contractions and she said
27:43
we freaked out it just wouldn't stop
27:45
moving we cut its head off just to make
27:47
sure
27:48
and then one of the undergrads was sick
27:49
in it oh my god
27:52
wow i know just quickly on reptiles
27:55
surviving
27:55
after they've been killed a snake
27:58
remains completely alive after you
27:59
decapitate it
28:00
not just muscle not just muscles like
28:02
spasming or anything a snake's head is
28:04
totally alive for about an hour
28:06
and after a full hour it can see you and
28:08
decide it's pissed off with you because
28:09
you've cut his head from its body
28:11
and headed so i don't know how it heads
28:13
over to you but crawl its way over to
28:15
you on its head
28:16
and bite you amazing no it's because
28:18
they've got these ridiculously slow
28:20
metabolisms oh that's hilarious that's
28:21
amazing
28:22
so creepy it must be weird if they
28:24
actually say like chase a mouse and they
28:26
catch it and they eat it but it just
28:32
[Music]
28:35
okay it is time to move on to our final
28:38
fact of the show
28:39
and that is james okay my fact this week
28:41
is that you can improve your darts game
28:43
by training yourself to dream about
28:45
darts
28:47
but it's not worth it because you have
28:48
to dream about darts all the time
28:50
well you know there are worse streams
28:52
it's not a nightmare at least
28:54
it's what depends on the game the dark
28:55
board is chasing you it's a nightmare
28:58
and it's trying to throw darts into your
29:00
body and saying see how you like it
29:02
i don't think that would improve your
29:03
game if that's the way you dream about
29:05
it
29:06
now the way that this works it was a
29:07
study which they did on lucid dreamers
29:09
and these are people who can kind of
29:11
decide what they're going to dream about
29:13
and it's the thing you can train
29:14
yourself to do you go to sleep and then
29:16
you realize you're asleep and you can
29:18
say okay now i'm going to chase dragons
29:20
because i know i'm asleep
29:21
whereas most people just dream passively
29:23
anyway they got these people who could
29:25
lucid dream
29:26
to um practice darts and they tested
29:28
them afterwards and the ones who did it
29:30
were better at darts and the ones who
29:31
didn't do it or worse at darts
29:33
really that's so cool although they did
29:35
specify that if people
29:36
the third group that practice darts in
29:37
their waking life were even better than
29:39
the ones who practiced it in their sleep
29:41
sure but i imagine if you practice in
29:44
your waking life
29:44
and practice while you're asleep you're
29:46
going to be even better yeah
29:48
um so it sounds like this is quite early
29:50
research slightly controversial as well
29:52
a lot of people aren't sure whether or
29:53
not
29:54
it does actually improve it's just a
29:55
small pool oh it's a small study yeah
29:57
yeah
29:58
but the thing is it definitely does work
30:00
i don't want to say definitely just in
30:01
case but
30:02
it does appear to work is kind of in
30:04
sport just imagining that you're going
30:06
to do something and that really helps
30:07
your
30:08
your body to prepare for muscle memory
30:10
and things like that i can absolutely
30:12
believe it haven't there been studies on
30:13
people with their arms and casts
30:14
who've been asked to visualize
30:16
themselves doing exercises with that arm
30:18
and it's been their arm has become
30:20
stronger than
30:22
if they were than if they were not doing
30:23
those visualizations
30:25
yeah it absolutely so that is i mean
30:26
dreaming doesn't sound very far from
30:28
that at all i believe it
30:29
um there was one thing about this study
30:31
as well with um the lucid dreamers about
30:33
darts
30:33
dreams being what they are sometimes
30:35
that they weren't
30:36
exactly the same as a darts game so one
30:38
of the people was throwing
30:40
a dart board that was actually looked
30:41
exactly like a tree stump
30:43
but that still helped them to get better
30:45
oh sure as it would in the real world i
30:47
guess
30:47
yeah it's like you find out the doubled
30:49
is your mum that's different
30:51
no but i think the idea is even if a
30:53
dartboard turns into your mum and you
30:54
turn out to be naked and you're flying
30:56
over australia
30:57
then you're still going to be better
30:59
because you practice the darts bit
31:00
imagine if once you got to the
31:02
competition you needed those exact
31:03
conditions
31:06
um phil taylor the darts player yeah he
31:09
dreams about darts so sometimes i'm
31:10
playing darts in my sleep and i wake
31:11
myself up
31:12
i hate it drives me crackers because if
31:14
i have a cat nap i'm dreaming about
31:15
bloody darts yeah so
31:17
he is the best darts player of all time
31:20
right um
31:20
and he probably plays darts all the time
31:22
in his in his normal life
31:24
because otherwise how would he get so
31:25
good yeah and he's probably just
31:27
dreaming because
31:28
you often dream about what you're doing
31:30
yeah actually he's
31:31
deliberately doing its practice like if
31:33
you play a computer game and when you
31:34
close your eyes at night
31:36
you can see images from the computer
31:37
yeah the tetris effect yeah i used to
31:39
get that all the time yeah i used to
31:40
play a lot of computer games
31:42
supposedly when um queen elizabeth ii
31:45
and prince philip went on a tour of
31:46
australia and they did something like 56
31:49
towns in 57 days so it was a mega tour
31:52
um
31:52
phillip at that point was dreaming of
31:54
just waving in his dreams
31:56
yeah i don't know if that's a proper
31:58
fact it's in the crown but
32:00
i assume they pulled that from a book
32:01
somewhere wow you love the crown so much
32:04
i can't believe it's taking you so long
32:05
to crowbar into this podcast
32:07
what is the crowd is it a film it's a
32:08
netflix uh it's written by peter morgan
32:11
who wrote the queen so
32:12
he's he's very factual in his uh initial
32:15
writing and yet neither of those stories
32:17
mentions that they're all lizards
32:20
weirdly have you ever seen the queen
32:22
trying to catch a fly with a
32:24
marshmallow-like tongue
32:28
there goes the lba yeah i know and i've
32:31
sent all those emails about the honors
32:32
committee to my management
32:34
terrible um phil the power so the
32:36
nickname the power
32:37
i i went on to wikipedia and saw a big
32:39
list of all cause they've all got sort
32:41
of wwf
32:43
nicknames that they bring to the sport
32:44
but what's really exciting is there's a
32:46
lot of
32:46
uh there's a lot of puns so uh antonio
32:50
alcinas he's spanish so what do you
32:53
reckon his is
32:54
antonio alcinas i don't know
32:57
so that's it jamie harvey he's from
33:00
scotland what's his pun
33:02
um tossing the dart no scotland
33:06
the sk like scotland the brave some pun
33:08
on this brave dart
33:10
oh yeah mark frost
33:13
where's he from is he from dartford
33:18
because otherwise i reckon we're going
33:19
to struggle somewhere from dartford
33:21
could only be beaten by someone from
33:22
dartmoor
33:26
so the earliest form of darts do you
33:29
know why
33:30
it was banned why um
33:33
because it was banned because people
33:34
kept on dying
33:36
it's the earliest form of darts war yes
33:41
no um it was called puff and dart and it
33:44
involved a blowpipe
33:46
okay can you go you know you would blow
33:48
the dart towards the board
33:50
and um eventually i mean people kept on
33:52
swallowing them by mistake and they
33:53
could be looking instead of blowing
33:55
yeah they could be quite small and so
33:57
eventually they thought why don't we
33:58
just get rid of the
33:59
blowpipe element of the darts game did
34:02
you
34:02
read about that man last year or the
34:04
year before last to inhale the dart
34:07
and um but he inhaled a rubber dart 44
34:09
years ago
34:10
and his parents took him to any and said
34:12
we think our sons inhaled a dart and
34:14
they said there's not really a dart in
34:15
there go away
34:16
and then he he didn't know about this
34:18
and he's always had sinus problems and
34:20
he sneezed this was in 20 2015.
34:23
he sneezed please tell me he was
34:24
standing right next to the dartmouth
34:29
and he took him 5 000 pounds of prize
34:31
money and the rubber
34:33
he sneezed and the rubber duck came out
34:35
and it had been sitting in his nose for
34:36
the last 44
34:38
james you know darts terminology because
34:40
you're a fan of the sport sure have you
34:42
heard
34:42
of the phrase wankers 50.
34:47
um i haven't no what is a wanker's 50
34:50
it's
34:50
i don't know if this is common or rare
34:51
it doesn't seem common it's where you're
34:53
aiming for a bullseye
34:54
which is 50. oh yeah but you hit single
34:56
20 single 18 and single 12.
34:58
okay instead so you do score 50 but you
35:00
use three does okay have you heard of
35:02
bag of dicks
35:03
which is b-a-g-a-d-i-x oh is that an
35:06
acronym
35:07
no no what would begin with x in that
35:10
acronym
35:13
it's rhyming slang it's not an accuracy
35:16
it's rhyming slang for 26.
35:18
oh because if you're aiming for the
35:20
treble 20 you miss it on one side and
35:22
get a one and on the other side you get
35:23
five
35:23
exactly yeah we call that b but i don't
35:26
know why we call it that
35:26
b and b is two and six and two and six
35:29
is how much a bed and breakfast used to
35:30
cost in the uk
35:32
two shillings and six months in
35:33
pre-decimalization currency so what's
35:35
bag of dicks
35:36
26 26 as in like i don't know shouldn't
35:39
that have like most rhyming slang
35:40
has a meaning i would sing it

hello and welcome to another episode of
01:56
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
01:59
coming to you from the qi offices in
02:01
covent garden
02:02
my name is dan schreiber and i'm sitting
02:04
here with james harkin
02:05
andrew hunter murray and anna chazinski
02:08
and once again we have gathered around
02:10
the microphones with our four favorite
02:11
facts from the last seven days
02:13
and in no particular order here we go
02:16
starting with you
02:17
andy my fact is the doomsday clock was
02:20
originally set at
02:21
seven minutes to midnight because the
02:23
artist responsible for it thought it
02:24
looked good
02:26
those were literally her words she was a
02:28
lady called martil langsdorff and she
02:30
was asked to come up with a cover for a
02:31
magazine basically
02:32
but the magazine was the bulletin of
02:34
atomic scientists
02:36
and uh she said it looked good to my eye
02:39
when she drew the doomsday clock at the
02:41
original thing
02:41
so the doomsday clock for anyone who
02:43
doesn't know is um is a sort of
02:45
theoretical clock saying how near we are
02:47
to the end of the world and it's put
02:48
together by
02:49
a body of atomic scientists and nuclear
02:52
weapons experts
02:53
and they have just moved it uh so we're
02:56
now two and a half minutes to midnight
02:58
which
02:58
is just about the closest it's ever been
03:01
i think at one point it
03:02
might have been on two minutes oh yeah i
03:03
think it was on two at one point yeah
03:04
you're right yeah if it was it was
03:05
around cuban missile crisis
03:07
no that's the weird thing they didn't
03:09
move it for the cuban missile crisis do
03:11
you know why
03:12
what they had no idea what was going on
03:14
they said we just don't have any data to
03:15
make a judgment
03:16
ah but it was in the newspapers yeah
03:20
i don't think they knew whether the
03:21
missiles were being primed or loaded or
03:23
whether they were going to get to cuba
03:24
or
03:24
no but that's one of the times where
03:26
they didn't change the clock at all so
03:27
were they
03:28
the this artist a was she an atomic
03:30
scientist as well by night no
03:32
artist by day or no she was married to a
03:34
guy who worked on
03:35
uh both the uh magazine and was also
03:38
part of the manhattan project i believe
03:40
he was one of the scientists who
03:41
who's helping out on that uh she was she
03:44
was just asked to design a cover so she
03:46
wasn't even designing a doomsday clock
03:48
as such she thought she was going to do
03:50
a u the letter u
03:52
for uranium as the cover but she noticed
03:54
in the talks that a deadline was sort of
03:56
looming and she thought oh like a clock
03:57
going to
03:58
12 it's just on its way kind of thing
04:01
it's an analog clock as well isn't it so
04:02
we don't know for sure that it's not
04:05
like two minutes to mid day yeah yeah
04:08
absolutely fine oh that's great 12 hours
04:10
away
04:11
i think they gave us not very much
04:13
wiggle room by putting it at seven
04:14
minutes too
04:15
and i think that's causing problems now
04:17
isn't it because actually the world
04:18
could get much much more dangerous
04:19
before catastrophe
04:20
and so for instance now is the first
04:22
time that they've only added half a
04:24
minute rather than a full minute
04:26
yes because clearly we're getting closer
04:28
and closer to midnight but
04:30
you don't want to say we've got a full
04:31
third of the way closer
04:33
it's like a parent saying i'm going to
04:34
count a three to a naughty child in like
04:36
one
04:37
two two and a half two and three
04:40
quarters
04:42
did they factor in for when the clocks
04:44
go forward
04:45
[Laughter]
04:49
i think the important thing for everyone
04:50
listening is that there is no scientific
04:52
basis or proper scale
04:54
to this clock they just kind of wing it
04:56
there is scientific basis
04:57
and it's a load of scientists who come
04:58
up with it to assess whether the world
05:00
is more dangerous or less dangerous yeah
05:01
but it's
05:01
sort of an arbitrary scale you know they
05:04
haven't actually worked out this is 20
05:05
percent more dangerous than it was
05:07
yesterday and it's yeah so but it's just
05:08
i think it's just 10 scientists and
05:10
security experts and they just get
05:11
together in a room don't they
05:13
and they just kind of discuss things and
05:16
then at the end of the day before they
05:17
crack open the whiskey they go okay what
05:19
we're gonna say
05:20
two minutes pretty much that's not yeah
05:22
um so the mana you know the manhattan
05:24
project um you know when it was underway
05:26
so this is when they
05:27
obviously uh oppenheimer and co exploded
05:30
an atomic bomb
05:31
they discussed at the time when they
05:32
were planning the manhattan project the
05:33
possibility
05:34
that it could in fact blow up the entire
05:37
world
05:38
so one of them guys working on it edward
05:40
teller did some calculations
05:42
and he said that it was possible that
05:44
the explosion they generated would uh
05:46
create this
05:47
fission reaction that generated heat so
05:49
intense that it would trigger
05:51
runaway fusion in the atmosphere now i
05:53
only know what a few of those words mean
05:55
but essentially the explosion was going
05:56
to generate such a huge heat that the
05:58
fusion in the atmosphere would spread
06:00
all around the world and the world would
06:02
explode we've basically become a sun
06:04
which is like the sun's energy comes
06:06
from nuclear fusion
06:07
yeah exactly i really like the
06:09
oppenheimer said at one point and this
06:11
is before the manhattan project
06:13
that in an interview he said my two
06:15
great loves are physics and desert
06:17
country
06:18
it's a pity they can't be combined and
06:20
then
06:21
he actually had the chance to marry his
06:23
two great lovers
06:24
yeah but marry them by blowing one of
06:26
them up
06:28
my third love of course is tiny
06:31
uninhabited islands in the south pacific
06:35
um so on the end of the world yeah uh
06:38
there are lots of
06:39
stories recently about preppers and uh
06:42
people so there's been a recent news
06:43
story that everyone is buying a house in
06:45
new zealand
06:45
everyone everyone who's anyone and has a
06:47
billion pounds is buying a house in new
06:49
zealand
06:50
uh because every sport house in new
06:52
zealand recently but he's from new
06:53
zealand yeah he lives there
06:55
i don't think he counts as a prepper in
06:57
that case
06:59
because they think it's less likely to
07:00
be bombed because everyone basically
07:02
likes people from new zealand you know
07:03
they're pretty innocuous people
07:05
but what about mordor that's there
07:07
that's very dangerous that's true that
07:08
is a rogue nation if ever there was one
07:10
isn't it
07:12
but did you know before the american
07:14
election in november prepper meal firms
07:17
a lot of them saw sales triple
07:18
in the three weeks leading up to the
07:20
election wow
07:22
yeah which is substantial because people
07:24
were thinking
07:25
it's all gonna kick off once we've had
07:26
the election do they think that would be
07:28
his first move
07:29
literally get into the white house red
07:30
button i was reading a um prepper's
07:33
um list of things that you take uh into
07:36
into your bunker with you should the
07:38
apocalypse happen do
07:39
they arrive this was actually a cracked
07:40
article and they were saying that one of
07:42
the things that's on the list that
07:44
sticks out is quite odd is uh
07:46
non-lubricated condoms
07:48
and they say you should have lots of
07:49
non-lubricated condoms lubricated yeah
07:52
so cracked they start saying okay it
07:54
kind of makes sense imagine if there's a
07:55
big group down there and suddenly sti
07:57
starts spreading so you want to make
07:58
sure that in any sex that that's
07:59
happening but then you think okay why
08:01
non-lubricated condoms
08:03
turns out that condoms are incredibly
08:05
practical as a thing to have
08:07
it's almost like if you were out in a
08:09
bear grylls situation with nothing you
08:10
can carry water in them
08:12
you can carry water in them where it's
08:13
called well you can yeah yeah yeah you
08:15
can carry
08:15
two liters non-lubricated as well so i'm
08:18
just gonna put a bottle in the bunker
08:19
and carry my water in there you'll be
08:20
toting around your condom
08:22
you can put them around your head and
08:24
blow it up with your nose
08:26
for fun yeah because you need
08:27
entertainment in these bunkers yeah
08:29
very dry places you can make a slingshot
08:31
out of them no
08:32
you can't yeah you can so there's the
08:34
preppers journal
08:35
and they have 11 ways a condom can save
08:37
your life and one of them is make a
08:39
slingshot and
08:40
it acts as the actual bit of rubber that
08:42
you pull back
08:43
on so you can and they show you how to
08:44
make it so you carve out the wood and
08:45
then you strap
08:46
two condoms and tie them up that's gonna
08:48
save your life
08:50
if there's a giant coming and you need
08:51
to send a small boy to defeat
08:54
him and in the post-nuclear landscape
08:56
there probably will be giants walking
08:57
around doing harm to people yeah
08:59
um any other ways that uh condone can
09:01
save your life yeah starting fires
09:03
uh starting of course starting fire
09:05
that's why sex is such a dangerous
09:07
business
09:08
that's the song this sex is on fire
09:12
due to this non-lubricated condom yeah
09:15
it's that friction
09:17
um does it say how you might start a
09:19
fire with a condom yeah it does well
09:21
actually it's not about starting
09:22
the fire it's about protecting tinder
09:23
from moisture
09:26
not your tinder
09:30
it does feel like that list is compiled
09:32
by completely insane people
09:34
well no it's on this amazing site called
09:35
preppers.com yeah i think they're
09:37
completely insane
09:39
they're really secretive as well so the
09:40
new yorker did a profile and
09:42
the journalist writing the article was
09:44
approaching possible preppers to
09:46
interview them yeah and one prepper
09:48
wrote back saying
09:49
asking to see my prepper stash you just
09:52
asked me one of the most personal things
09:54
i've ever heard that is effectively like
09:56
going to someone's house
09:57
meeting their new girlfriend and saying
09:59
have you got any condoms
10:01
yeah he said it's like saying i'd like
10:03
to see her naked and have sex with her
10:05
so they are very very secretive about it
10:07
that's because i think they're the kind
10:08
of people whose prepper stash does
10:09
contain 100 blow-up dolls
10:13
we should say that this is genuinely
10:15
really quite widespread in america so
10:18
there was
10:18
a study done recently that found 22
10:21
percent of americans believe that the
10:22
world will end
10:23
in their lifetime another study the
10:26
national geographic did that said
10:28
40 of americans so almost half think
10:30
that stocking up on end of the world
10:31
supplies is a more sensible idea
10:33
than getting a pension scheme i keep
10:35
getting it
10:37
right if you if you don't get a pension
10:40
but you do have a lot of canned food and
10:42
water you can once you retire just go
10:44
and live in your bunker anyway
10:46
it doesn't matter that the world's not
10:47
ended does it it doesn't really affect
10:49
you whether the world's going on or not
10:51
it's the retirement everyone's always
10:52
dreamed of the windowless
10:55
canned food dependent 30 years
10:58
post-working life
11:05
okay it's time for fact number two and
11:07
that is
11:08
james okay my fact this week is that
11:11
some villagers
11:12
in the central african republic
11:14
deliberately allow lions to live nearby
11:16
so they can steal their food
11:19
so what would normally happen if um if
11:21
you lived in a village
11:22
and there were lions nearby you would
11:24
always try and shoo them away
11:25
yeah but these guys kind of allow them
11:27
to live nearby they don't try and get
11:29
rid of them
11:29
because what they know will happen is
11:31
these lines will catch bits of meat and
11:33
whatever
11:34
and then they can shoot them away or
11:36
they can sneak up on them and they can
11:37
grab the meat
11:38
and they'll be able to eat it have you
11:40
seen the video of people doing this
11:42
though no with the lions
11:43
yeah i saw the uh no it's
11:46
what were you about to say i brought up
11:48
the youtube page yes i've seen the crown
11:50
right it's 10 part series it's amazing i
11:52
brought up the youtube page and i saw
11:54
all the videos but i didn't press play
11:55
on them so i saw the screen grab
11:56
that holds the video but i saw the
11:58
advert before it came back
12:00
yeah there's a new nokia
12:03
anna you've actually seen the videos i
12:05
have they're really good
12:06
so um basically i think i saw a video
12:09
that was
12:10
of the darobo hunters in southern kenya
12:12
so as james says this happens in various
12:14
places
12:14
um and what they do is there are about
12:17
10 lines gathered around a corpse i
12:18
think it's a gazelle or something
12:20
so 10 lions males and females and there
12:22
are three hunters and
12:23
you know scrawny little humans and um
12:26
they just go up to them i think two of
12:28
them had little spears just
12:30
wooden sticks essentially right and the
12:33
key is confidence
12:34
and if you just stride up and look like
12:36
you definitely own the show
12:38
then the lions just leave um so there's
12:40
kind of a staring contest and a battle
12:41
of wills they walk towards the lions and
12:43
the lions look up at them and sort of
12:44
meet their eye and size them up and then
12:46
for some reason
12:47
this pride of ten lions thinks no i
12:49
can't handle these three
12:51
small skinny men and they go away but
12:53
they know they have to cut
12:54
the um meat off the animal really
12:57
quickly because if the lions stay and
12:58
watch them long enough
13:00
and size them up properly then they'll
13:02
realize that actually i probably can
13:04
take those guys i'll go back
13:06
how do you do it at the end do you just
13:07
walk off just walk away just casually
13:10
stride away
13:11
it's like these guys have read the game
13:13
but with lions
13:14
[Laughter]
13:15
just this is completely off subject but
13:17
about staring people out uh dan what do
13:20
you think is the
13:21
record in the world staring someone out
13:23
competition ooh
13:24
so is this the same as a no blinking
13:26
yeah so if you and i are kind of who's
13:28
gonna blink the
13:29
yeah the latest what do you reckon the
13:32
two people who
13:33
um were in the final the person who went
13:36
out how long do you think it was got it
13:38
i can't imagine
13:39
is it reality is it 1962 between kennedy
13:41
and khrushchev at the height of the
13:43
cuban missile crisis
13:45
that is pretty old satire
13:49
it's because we were talking about the
13:50
cuban missile crisis
13:52
it was timely it was weirdly topical
13:56
um uh just going from my own
14:00
eyeballs your own record you get my own
14:02
record i'd say no longer than half an
14:03
hour or
14:04
no no like no no sorry sorry what like
14:06
half a minute how do you think someone's
14:08
not blinking for half an hour that's
14:09
what i'm saying well james is asking
14:10
what i think the record is so and i know
14:12
it's got to be more than half a minute
14:13
so i'm saying half an hour i'm saying
14:16
half a minute okay
14:18
uh i believe it's about 40 minutes
14:23
was one of them dead and they hadn't
14:25
realized
14:29
um that's amazing whoa did you know that
14:32
uh in the pool they do the same thing
14:34
that james is talking about but with
14:35
tigers so there's kleptoparasitism
14:37
uh humans do this with tigers but it's
14:40
very often in nepal elephant trainers
14:42
who do it and they do it by they'll lead
14:43
their elephants into the undergrowth to
14:45
feed them and
14:46
things like that and then if there's a
14:48
tiger nearby then they take the elephant
14:50
with them and they use the elephant to
14:51
scare away the tiger to scare the tiger
14:53
off a carcass
14:53
so they employ the elephants as their
14:55
henchmen in order to get the tiger to
14:57
scarpa
14:58
wow that's very cool um here's the thing
15:00
so
15:01
the worst time for being attacked by
15:03
lions as in the time it's most likely to
15:05
happen
15:06
it's always bad the time it happens most
15:09
um often is just after the full moon
15:12
okay
15:13
and that's because lions hunt best when
15:16
it's dark
15:17
and when it's light at night time
15:18
there's a full moon they tend to not
15:20
really hunt that much and so they don't
15:22
eat that much
15:23
and so just after the full moon they're
15:24
really hungry and so they're more likely
15:26
to
15:27
attack you oh really do you know how you
15:30
lure a lion to you if you want it to
15:32
come to you
15:33
with some meat yeah you could put on a
15:36
gazelle costume
15:37
and you prance around looking
15:38
incompetent
15:40
no it's an interesting trick that's used
15:42
by a lot of photographers when they're
15:44
trying to lure them to camera traps to
15:45
set off to take photos
15:47
for jaguars and for lions um it tends to
15:49
be men's aftershave
15:51
so with lions a photographer that i was
15:53
reading about
15:54
um said that they use old spice and what
15:57
they do is they just spray it all over
15:59
say the leaves of the area where the
16:00
camera is and that tends to
16:02
glue them in so the masai obviously are
16:05
known for
16:06
lion killing their lion killing ways and
16:08
it's the rite of passage
16:09
in maasai culture to is it yeah when you
16:12
hit adolescence then you go out and you
16:14
kill a lion and that
16:15
means you're a man and means you're very
16:17
brave and you come back and the person
16:18
who killed the lion gets to wear the
16:19
mane on his head at special events and
16:21
the tales all bejeweled by the women in
16:23
the tribe um
16:25
and they've started cutting down a bit
16:26
now because lime populations are under
16:28
threat so it used to be more individuals
16:29
that went out
16:30
uh now it's more groups but they've
16:33
because there's a kind of increasing
16:34
awareness about how lion populations are
16:36
in trouble
16:37
amongst maasai people i was in kenya 10
16:39
years ago and even then i met a couple
16:41
of maasai guys who were campaigning in
16:42
their tribes
16:43
against killing animals because they
16:45
don't think they should do it
16:46
so because there's this increasing
16:47
awareness they've started the maasai
16:49
olympics as an alternative way for
16:51
men to prove their kind of status in
16:53
society and they have
16:54
all the same kind of skills that it
16:56
would take to hunt a lion like
16:57
sprinting or long-distance running
16:59
javelin throwing
17:00
but they don't have to kill lions
17:02
anymore i watched um
17:04
just thinking about uh humans living
17:06
with uh
17:07
lions um i was watching a video of
17:10
do you remember that melanie griffith
17:12
those video those pictures came out that
17:14
she grew up with lions
17:16
who's melanie griffith she's an actor um
17:18
very famous but you might know her
17:19
through she was married for years to
17:21
antonio banderas um
17:23
and she was um whose daughter was she
17:24
tipped to be headroom yeah tippy
17:26
headroom oh yeah
17:27
yes so that's more your era isn't it
17:29
andy yeah yeah yeah absolutely the
17:30
the 1962 good old days yeah hitchcock
17:33
was alive
17:34
the rolling stones were still good the
17:36
cold war was still going
17:38
so all your jokes still made sense
17:41
hey guys what about those missile bases
17:43
in hungary huh
17:45
yeah so um so melanie griffith uh the
17:48
actor
17:48
she when she was growing up lived with
17:50
lions and there's all these photos of
17:52
them playing in the pool
17:52
sleeping in the same bed and so on but
17:54
her parents made a movie called roar
17:56
which is a very very famous movie um in
17:58
which they used actual
18:00
lions and tigers in the movie and a few
18:02
of them i think melanie griffith
18:03
actually got a bit mauled
18:04
in it she had like 100 stitches off the
18:06
back of it and you can see that footage
18:08
on the dvd that they've released
18:10
but you can watch the the sort of
18:11
collected clips from roar on youtube
18:14
of all the lion and tiger attacks in the
18:16
movie and it is
18:17
nuts then they lived with like a hundred
18:19
lions the family itself so melanie
18:21
griffith grew up
18:22
100 lions yeah i promise it was like 100
18:24
lines and targets and you can see in the
18:26
footage
18:26
because they were they weren't they
18:27
weren't all in the house like it was an
18:29
outdoor area oh okay
18:30
just the sleeping arrangement sort of
18:32
bad enough yeah we'll put you in the
18:34
98th bedroom
18:35
yes exactly it still has got a line and
18:37
obviously we have a hundred lions
18:41
well it's not one of the two rooms i've
18:43
got two lions in it
18:45
no you'd never say yes to a sleepover
18:49
would you
18:50
[Music]
18:51
[Applause]
18:55
okay it is time for fact number three
18:57
and that is my fact
18:58
my fact this week is that there is a
19:00
victorian time capsule
19:02
buried in london that contains
19:03
photographs of the 12
19:05
best looking women in england so the 12
19:08
best looking
19:09
from victorian times yeah well yeah it
19:11
would be amazing if it had pictures of
19:13
kim bassinger and stuff in it now
19:14
wouldn't it
19:15
still an incredibly old reference
19:19
you're getting closer
19:22
yeah um so um here's the thing
19:26
i'm not fully sure and i don't know if
19:28
anyone does properly know
19:29
who these women were so the phrase i
19:31
kept coming across is 12 best looking
19:33
women in england or 12 english beauties
19:36
of the day
19:37
and no one says any more about it so
19:39
this is buried as part of a time capsule
19:41
which is buried underneath cleopatra's
19:43
needle which if you've ever been to
19:45
london is
19:45
on the embankments it's on along the
19:48
thames
19:49
only down the road down the road from
19:51
here we could almost see it from our
19:52
office
19:53
can we get to the um pictures they're
19:56
buried
19:56
obviously underneath in a time capsule
19:58
that's the point
19:59
when do we get to open it and have a
20:01
look at these english beauties they
20:02
haven't said
20:03
but that's what's amazing to me this is
20:04
what i find very interesting about the
20:06
fact is that there is this box buried
20:07
underneath um
20:08
the cleopatra's needle which was brought
20:10
and erected in 1896.
20:12
um things that were included in it were
20:14
a box of cigars there's a portrait of
20:16
queen victoria there's a written history
20:18
about how cleopatra's needle actually
20:19
got transported
20:21
to being on the embankment and then
20:22
there are 12
20:24
photographs of the english beauties of
20:26
the day and no one
20:27
has seemed to have gone huh and said who
20:30
are they why is that
20:31
they just treat it like it's a normal
20:32
thing you put in a time capsule there's
20:34
a load of really weird stuff
20:35
like there's also a three foot high
20:37
model of cleopatra's needle
20:39
under cleopatra needle yeah is that then
20:42
underneath that there's a three
20:43
centimeter one
20:44
that's the original russian doll it's
20:46
really weird that is strange yeah and
20:48
they've got and they've also inserted
20:50
under there one of the hydraulic jacks
20:52
used
20:52
to lift it up because it was lifted by
20:55
just four men using four hydraulic jacks
20:57
and it was hugely
20:58
technologically advanced for the time
21:01
they consulted joseph bazeljet
21:03
uh he was the person that they asked
21:05
about how to get it onto the
21:06
shore and whether it would be safe
21:08
because people were worried that it was
21:09
so heavy
21:09
it would cause the embankment to
21:11
collapse and brazil jet was of course
21:13
the guy who designed the london sewer
21:15
system so he
21:16
knew a lot by that point about what was
21:18
underneath the earth in london and he
21:19
said look it's fine it's made of london
21:21
clay it's safe
21:22
dump it on there and so they did so we
21:24
should say what cleopatra's needle
21:26
actually is before we go any further so
21:27
it's a
21:28
it's an obelisk it's a huge uh ancient
21:30
egyptian
21:31
stone it's sort of pillar covered in
21:34
hieroglyphs and it's got nothing to do
21:36
with cleopatra
21:37
um it should be called footmose's needle
21:40
because he was the pharaoh who actually
21:42
commissioned it
21:43
it's you know way way way longer ago
21:44
than cleopatra and uh there are three of
21:46
them
21:47
one of them is in new york uh it's in
21:49
central park one of those in london and
21:50
there's another one
21:51
in paris but it's from somewhere else
21:53
yeah so that's what they are
21:55
yeah and uh anna is saying the worries
21:57
about how
21:58
uh placing it there was it gonna go
22:00
through the ground the initial proposal
22:02
for where it was gonna be
22:03
was outside the front of the houses of
22:05
parliament that's where they wanted to
22:06
stand
22:07
and the metropolitan district uh
22:09
committee said you can't do that because
22:11
it's directly over one of our tube lines
22:13
and it's going to be too heavy
22:15
and it's going to fall the rumbles are
22:16
going to topple it over and then the
22:18
weight of it once it topples over
22:19
it's going to break through the ground
22:21
and stab a train it's not stopped
22:24
come on it wasn't their exact words but
22:27
it's a needle point at the top isn't it
22:29
so
22:29
it's not that pointy i don't know it's
22:31
pointy enough to penetrate
22:32
but it's it's not so big it's it's much
22:35
less weight than
22:36
say a building yes like that's the thing
22:39
yeah like
22:39
you would think that big ben would be
22:41
more likely to fall over and stab a
22:42
train than that oh yeah
22:44
it's a very pointy big bed yeah at the
22:45
top yeah it's very true and also it's
22:47
got these two sphinxes which are facing
22:49
it
22:49
um and they are firstly they're the
22:51
wrong way round these massive
22:53
bronze sphinxes they should be facing
22:55
away from it protecting it and actually
22:57
they're looking towards it like idiots
22:59
and the other thing is that they were
23:00
actually made in 1881 they're so fake
23:03
no way yes they're completely knock off
23:06
victorian things yeah they're replicas
23:08
yeah
23:08
i went down there this morning uh to
23:10
look at them and just see if i could see
23:12
the you were looking for the twelve
23:13
beauties
23:14
i was looking for where i thought they
23:16
might even acknowledge that maybe there
23:17
was a time capsule
23:18
somewhere but they don't but what you do
23:20
see is there's there's a lot of things
23:22
they tell you about the people who died
23:23
in the process of bringing it over
23:25
because there was a whole ship container
23:26
that was built for it called the
23:27
cleopatra to transport it
23:29
and it got disattached during a storm so
23:30
they lost it for five days
23:32
fell over and stabbed a ship he just
23:35
stabbed a fish it came out like a sort
23:36
of lovely kebab
23:40
this was insane i think you're under
23:41
selling it a bit down like they
23:42
literally built an
23:43
iron capsule with sails on top exactly
23:47
slotted cleopatra's needle into it and
23:49
then towed it behind a ship
23:51
unsuccessfully i'm really unsuccessful
23:53
the men
23:54
several men died didn't they because
23:55
there was a storm arose and the
23:58
it was was it the men going from the
24:00
main ship
24:01
to try and steady the needle it was lost
24:04
at sea
24:04
yeah there was another ship that
24:05
realized that there was there'd been a
24:06
big storm and they were in trouble and
24:08
they sent some people on a little boat
24:09
to try and rescue the people and those
24:11
people on the boat died
24:12
but then uh i think you were saying
24:14
cleopatra's needle itself inside this
24:16
massive container just floated around
24:18
yeah lost it see no one knew if it had
24:19
sunk and then someone just stumbled upon
24:21
it
24:22
yeah and i think they gave up i think
24:23
they thought well it's gone it's it must
24:25
have
24:26
gone down absolutely terrible when they
24:28
thought we've lost cleopatra
24:30
because the thing is before it was
24:31
brought over right it was given to the
24:33
british
24:34
by the ruler of egypt it was called
24:35
muhammad ali incidentally
24:37
um to say thank you for winning the
24:39
battle of the nile and the battle of
24:40
alexandria against napoleon
24:42
but the british government said well we
24:44
can't really afford to bring it over
24:45
this is 1819.
24:46
so they then waited 60 years
24:50
59 years until 1878 when they said i
24:53
suppose we better bring it over then
24:55
they've given it to us it seems churlish
24:56
now and then as soon as they try and
24:58
bring it over they lose it yeah
25:00
yeah do you think when they lost it they
25:02
thought well we have this three-inch
25:04
version
25:05
[Laughter]
25:07
should we just put that on display
25:09
instead
25:10
we can only fit one photo of a beauty
25:12
underneath it unfortunately
25:15
so yeah i was going to say so it has the
25:17
names of the guys who died in that in
25:19
that process
25:20
on the back of it facing the water
25:21
facing the thames um and then
25:23
underneath one of the sphinxes you can
25:25
see a little sign that says
25:27
the shrapnel holes that you can see in
25:28
here are little holes that were
25:31
made as a result of nighttime bombing in
25:34
1917
25:35
over london and the bombs uh hit a tram
25:38
and and it shot off metal and so on into
25:40
it and so
25:41
you can actually go up to the sinks and
25:42
put your finger through a bomb hole in
25:44
the
25:49
god out of control today well we've lost
25:52
then everybody listening
25:54
sorry you didn't you didn't see it
25:55
coming did he just said he
25:57
said you could put your finger in a bomb
25:59
hole all
26:00
innocence
26:01
[Laughter]
26:08
i'm on time capsules while we've got
26:11
that subject
26:12
open um loads of them have been lost
26:15
so there's an international body called
26:17
the international time capsule society
26:20
uh which set up in 1990 and it reckons
26:22
that there are 10 to 15 000 capsules
26:24
worldwide
26:25
but that most of them have been
26:26
forgotten and lost unfortunately the
26:28
international time capsule society now
26:30
says
26:30
we are not open anymore we're not open
26:32
for business we'll be open in 2153
26:39
did you say did you see they um they
26:41
accidentally dug up
26:42
a blue peter time capsule at the end of
26:44
last year yeah by the start of this year
26:47
uh it was under the millennium dome and
26:48
they accidentally dug it up and damaged
26:50
it
26:51
and they've taken all the bits out and
26:52
put them in their office and they're
26:54
gonna re-bury them
26:55
yeah and it's i mean it was buried in
26:57
1998 to sort of go under the millennium
26:59
dome and it is the most 90s collection
27:01
of things
27:02
you could find so here's what they
27:03
thought was worth it i bet you could
27:05
guess something yeah
27:06
is it one of one of the dogs yeah one of
27:08
the dogs what are the blue pizzas
27:11
so it's gotta be newspapers of the day
27:13
richard bacon
27:15
loads of cocaine it's so bear in mind
27:17
this was
27:18
selected by children who were watching
27:20
blue peter in the 90's was it not much
27:22
cocaine because
27:23
it's a small amount of cocaine alright
27:26
you're an actual guest
27:27
so think of some things to do one of
27:28
those badges yeah blue peter badges
27:30
absolutely
27:31
but like really 90s things that
27:32
children's things from the 90s a spice
27:34
girl
27:34
a spice girl correct a spice girl's cd
27:36
not bad was it yeah
27:37
absolutely it's got a tamagotchi um it's
27:40
got a picture of tony blair in a hi-vis
27:42
vest
27:44
and it's got one of the great beauties
27:45
of the day
27:47
it's got some felt from the roof of the
27:49
millennium dome
27:50
yeah what i think strange is like this
27:52
blue pizza one for instance
27:54
we know what's in it and they were only
27:56
planning to open it in 2050 or something
27:59
yeah presumably we're still going to
28:01
know what was in it then i think what
28:02
they should do is put stuff in and keep
28:04
it a secret
28:05
like the 12 beauties who are they see
28:06
that would be a huge reveal
28:08
yeah yeah uh you know the new york one
28:11
so
28:11
there's a cleopatra's needle in new york
28:14
yeah
28:14
um egypt has asked for the one in new
28:17
york back
28:18
because they're not taking good enough
28:19
care of it so this was a couple of years
28:21
ago the secretary general of egypt's
28:23
supreme council of antiquities
28:25
wrote a letter to the mayor who was
28:26
bloomberg at the time saying i've seen
28:28
some pictures
28:29
of the obelisk that we kindly gifted you
28:31
in the 19th century
28:32
and we've noticed that you're not taking
28:34
good care of it at all the hieroglyphics
28:35
have rubbed off
28:36
it's chipped away at if you don't hold
28:39
everywhere
28:40
a weird guy sticking his finger in at
28:42
various times of day
28:44
um and he said we're gonna have a duty
28:46
to come and remove it if you don't saw
28:48
it
28:49
one of the first things they did when it
28:50
arrived in new york was they gave it a
28:52
thorough cleaning they said this is too
28:53
mucky and it did a huge amount of damage
28:55
to it
28:56
yeah that was pretty much on
28:57
installation oh come on guys
28:59
i think we think there are only about 28
29:01
left aren't there and i they
29:03
they were all in egypt obelisks and i
29:05
think egypt only has six left because
29:07
it seemed to keep giving them away as
29:09
thank yous constantly the romans stole
29:15
did we steal ours or no we were given it
29:17
we were given it for winning those
29:18
battles
29:19
okay yeah i think we found it though as
29:21
well we uncovered it
29:22
it was british archaeologists over there
29:24
who uncovered it and so i said
29:25
can we have that oh i didn't know that
29:27
we found it yeah all right it was found
29:28
by a circus strong man
29:30
come on why did he not just carry it
29:35
he might have been able to he could
29:37
carry 12 people
29:38
up on a uh that was part of his act he
29:40
would he would hold people up
29:42
on stage 12 people on a on a sort of
29:44
platform and walk across the stage
29:46
really but he studied hydraulics
29:48
initially and so that was his thing so
29:49
he was one of the most successful
29:51
archaeologists of this time
29:52
i don't need hydraulics with these arms
29:57
um yeah i'm pretty sure he was the one
29:59
who um
30:00
found the obelisks itself if not he
30:02
definitely was very much involved with
30:03
cleopatra's needle um
30:05
i can't quite remember why though and he
30:07
was quite strong
30:08
so he ruined a lot of things so to get
30:10
into so just kind of lent against the
30:12
pyramid
30:14
mr strong from the mr members actually
30:17
all the pyramids used to have square
30:20
sides
30:24
his name was giovanni batista belzoni uh
30:27
he was born in italy but
30:29
he he lived over in uh in england he was
30:32
six foot seven tall
30:33
um and he was known as the patagonian
30:36
samson as when he was a strong man
30:38
and he found um the tombs of ramses the
30:40
first
30:41
so he made some mega discoveries but he
30:43
used to like battering ram his way
30:45
through
30:45
in order to guess he destroyed a lot of
30:47
is that why he wanted the obelisk so he
30:49
could batter
30:50
some tombstone he just used it as a
30:52
toothpick
31:00
okay it is time for our final fact of
31:02
the show and that is jazinski
31:04
my fact this week is that after women
31:06
stop breastfeeding their breasts eat
31:08
themselves
31:09
and this is this is something we've just
31:12
found out
31:13
about human women and it's
31:16
that so what happens is when when we're
31:18
breastfeeding then we have to produce
31:20
loads of extra cells which produce the
31:21
milk for the babies and so
31:23
our breasts have suddenly become full of
31:25
these cells and then when you stop
31:26
breastfeeding
31:27
then you're just full of useless cells
31:30
which die
31:31
and in normal circumstances if you've
31:33
got a bit of your body that are full of
31:35
totally useless dead cells
31:37
that would create a huge immuno response
31:39
to try and clear them up which would be
31:41
extremely painful and there'd be loads
31:43
and loads of bruising there'd be tissue
31:44
damage
31:45
because that's just all this dead stuff
31:46
hanging around in your body that your
31:47
white blood cells then have to come and
31:49
eat up
31:50
um so it'd be really painful so we've
31:51
never quite known how it is that once we
31:53
stop breastfeeding
31:54
we're able to get back to normal without
31:56
any serious problems
31:57
until now and it turns out that they
32:00
thoughtfully kill each other these milk
32:01
producing cells
32:02
so once you stop breastfeeding then
32:05
there's a hormone release which means
32:06
that they stay
32:07
quite close next to each other the dead
32:09
cells and the
32:10
live ones just swallow them and they
32:12
just keep eating each other and eating
32:14
each other until there are few enough
32:15
left that the white blood cells rock up
32:16
and swallow the rest
32:18
crikey but yeah our breasts devour
32:20
themselves that is amazing
32:22
breasts are really intelligent when it
32:23
comes to um
32:25
producing milk for babies i asked ash um
32:29
so
32:29
my best friend ash he has uh become a
32:32
dad recently and i he'd been telling me
32:34
a few things while
32:35
uh jackie his wife was pregnant about
32:37
what breastfeeding how how it works
32:39
um and he said that basically the nipple
32:42
sort of
32:42
listens listens not being you know
32:44
obviously it has no ears but
32:45
it it analyzes baby saliva right
32:48
to give the appropriate milk and i
32:50
looked into it and this is true
32:52
so what it does is little bits of saliva
32:54
when the baby is
32:56
um sucking on the nipple makes its way
32:58
into the nipple
33:00
and they say that the breasts um and the
33:02
body of the mum
33:03
actually manages to sort of diagnose
33:05
what kind of milk the baby needs in
33:07
terms of if it's actually a bit ill
33:09
it might need these uh like the extra
33:11
antibodies in order to make the baby
33:13
healthier so it kind of
33:14
it produces whatever kind of concoction
33:17
it's really
33:18
it's really controversial that is it
33:19
yeah it is so there's there's not
33:21
any studies done on it and it's also
33:23
just very possible and some people think
33:24
it's much more possible that
33:26
if you're producing more antibodies it's
33:27
just because whatever's making the baby
33:29
ill is also making you will you've
33:30
caught the virus and so
33:31
you're producing antibodies but there's
33:33
there's a lot of anecdotal evidence you
33:35
know mothers say that my milk looks
33:36
different when my baby's sick yeah
33:38
famously your mother put a picture up on
33:40
facebook which said look at the color of
33:42
my milk because it's kind of changed and
33:43
the suggestion was is that it was
33:45
changing because it was
33:46
adding more stuff into the weirdly
33:47
science sometimes requires more evidence
33:49
than a mum's picture on facebook
33:51
honestly i'm not going to how many likes
33:52
today i'm lying 70 000 oh well you know
33:54
oh well then that does sound
33:56
unequivocal one thing that's true uh and
33:59
this is not from a mum's facebook post
34:01
is the past um no one thing is that
34:04
babies uh can
34:06
smell breasts very accurately
34:10
and home in on them because after a
34:11
woman's given birth
34:13
uh women give off from the breast these
34:15
kind of secretions which
34:16
babies can smell very clearly and babies
34:19
can smell
34:20
them and react to them more strongly
34:22
than they react to the smell of actual
34:23
milk
34:24
oh wow so it's like a homing beacon
34:27
saying there is a breast here make your
34:28
way towards it
34:29
and then it's frustrating because most
34:30
babies can't really move at all so they
34:32
just
34:33
breast nearby really frustrated there's
34:36
nothing they can do
34:37
when they smell these secretions they
34:38
get more interested and they sort of
34:39
make more
34:40
you know head movements and suckling
34:42
gestures and things like this than they
34:43
do even when they smell milk so that's
34:45
how they sort of
34:46
yeah i thought this was really
34:47
interesting i was reading about this for
34:49
the o series research actually i was
34:51
looking into ovulating
34:52
but very interesting and this is related
34:55
to lactation that in the olden days when
34:58
we were hunter-gatherer society
35:00
we menstruated far far less i hardly
35:03
menstruate it
35:04
now to be honest um so we had far fewer
35:07
menstrual cycles back in the olden days
35:09
because women were breastfeed for much
35:10
longer so the average
35:12
uh in hunter-gatherer societies now and
35:14
then the average length of time you
35:15
breastfeed for was about three years
35:17
whereas now
35:18
varies a lot but i think it's about six
35:20
months here and so you'd either be
35:22
breastfeeding which
35:23
suppresses your periods or you'd be
35:26
pregnant where obviously you don't get
35:27
periods
35:28
and so someone worked out that back then
35:30
you'd have about 50 menstrual cycles in
35:32
your lifetime which is hardly any and
35:34
now we have about 420 430 menstrual
35:37
cycles
35:37
and we're just not evolved to be able to
35:39
cope with these constant wild
35:41
fluctuations of
35:42
estrogen and progesterone because we're
35:44
not supposed to be doing that it's
35:45
supposed to be kind of an occasional
35:46
thing between
35:47
being pregnant and breastfeeding because
35:49
and then you're dead at the age of 25 or
35:51
30 so
35:52
exactly and then everything really drops
35:54
off
35:55
in all departments after that yeah um i
35:57
was reading about
35:58
um letdown it's a phrase called let down
36:00
and i think that
36:01
i've heard it before dan i've heard the
36:02
face
36:05
but it's obviously four people around
36:07
the microphones right now who don't have
36:09
uh children so the what we might we
36:11
might be saying a lot of very obvious
36:13
things to parents
36:14
uh in this chat but i'd not heard of
36:16
this just check it on facebook and see
36:17
if anyone spends it
36:20
um so it's um it's the fact that um
36:23
lactating can happen not just when
36:26
the baby latches on to uh to the breast
36:29
but
36:29
things can spark it off for example if
36:32
you show
36:33
a mum a picture of her baby she might
36:36
let some milk loose just purely by
36:38
seeing the photo isn't that incredible
36:40
wow yeah
36:42
um or even if she hears another baby cry
36:45
because of a primal uh urge to soothe
36:48
a child knowing that sueds might just
36:50
release some milk
36:52
again obviously most mums and fathers
36:54
around the world are going yeah we know
36:55
this but
36:56
i'd never heard that wow i remember
36:58
reading a year or two ago
36:59
about the idea there was a study done
37:02
that a lot of
37:03
babies especially mammals i think all
37:05
kind of cry at
37:06
similar frequencies and i can't remember
37:09
why that would happen
37:10
maybe you would look after other species
37:12
yeah that's what that would imply isn't
37:13
it
37:13
so if you're a stout if you're a baby
37:15
stoat you cry
37:16
in the hope that they'll be a your mum b
37:19
another stoat or c
37:20
a weasel passing by or any any mammal
37:24
yeah and did you see that thing this
37:26
week speaking of nursing other species
37:27
the woman in peru
37:29
who was being interviewed about floods
37:31
in peru at the moment which is
37:32
devastating agriculture
37:33
things like that and she was holding a
37:34
piglet and as the interviewer was
37:37
interviewing her she lifted up her shirt
37:39
and just started suckling the pig on her
37:41
own breast
37:42
and the cameraman is so tactful over the
37:44
camera swings away from that image
37:46
faster than you can breathe suddenly
37:50
takes a real interest in the surrounding
37:52
scenery
37:53
it's very weird so there are obviously
37:55
loads and loads and loads of stories
37:57
about breastfeeding
37:58
uh you know saints who miraculously
38:00
started lactating when they were
38:02
starving in the desert
38:03
so one of them is um the christian holy
38:05
woman christine the astonishing
38:08
i seem to remember could christine the
38:09
astonishing fly as well
38:11
from her name i wouldn't be surprised by
38:12
anything she could do
38:14
i have a feeling she was in a church
38:15
once since she flew up into the eaves of
38:17
the church
38:18
so also in the bible they you know they
38:19
used to depict the virgin mary
38:21
breastfeeding jesus but sometimes they
38:22
didn't want her breast to seem sexy
38:24
so they put her breasts on her
38:26
collarbone instead of breast level yeah
38:28
so there are all these pictures that
38:29
less sex espos it is less sexy it's
38:32
it's more weird isn't it which makes it
38:34
a bit less sexy
38:35
yeah yeah that's really funny so there
38:37
are all these pictures of having
38:38
oppressed them way up here and jesus
38:40
feeding on them
38:41
um did you know that opossums so you
38:44
know
38:44
possums look like possums but american
38:47
um their
38:48
nipples grow up to 35 times their
38:51
original length when they're being
38:52
cycled
38:53
do they start off really small or really
38:56
really long they're quite normal size
38:58
they're getting
38:59
incredibly long silly baby opossums
39:02
climb up into their mother's pouch when
39:04
they're very undeveloped
39:05
and they have to latch on immediately
39:06
and if you don't find a nipple really
39:08
quickly you die straight away
39:09
so you latch on and they latch on and
39:11
then the nipple swirls up inside their
39:13
mouth so they're locked on and they stay
39:15
locked on for two months
39:17
so it becomes like an umbilical cord it
39:19
grows up to 35 times its own length down
39:21
into
39:21
down into the body yeah yeah what that
39:25
is not sexy oh my god yeah
39:29
it's weird isn't it and because it's so
39:31
swollen up inside it's so latched on if
39:33
you try to detach one from the other
39:34
then you turn
39:35
you know you tear the nipple because
39:37
they're locked
39:39
they're locked tight no no no no no
39:42
no thank you do you know the fact that
39:45
breasts have on men
39:49
well they have done experiments on men
39:52
who
39:53
they divided men into two groups uh
39:55
normal men and perverts
39:56
no um they asked them to do the
39:59
experiment like you know with the
40:00
experiment with children we have a
40:01
marshmallow now or
40:02
two much manners later so they said you
40:05
can have one breast now our two breasts
40:07
later
40:08
no they they asked them if they would be
40:10
willing to delay gratification get a
40:12
small cash amount now or a large cash
40:13
amount later
40:14
right and then they show the two groups
40:16
of men two different films one of them
40:18
was a woman
40:18
running along a beach in slow motion
40:20
like in baywatch
40:22
and the other was some countryside right
40:25
um and the men who watched the you know
40:26
the countryside was there anything was
40:28
it just
40:28
was just piglet there were no piglets
40:33
there were no rutting balls
40:37
um no so just like boring countryside
40:40
and the men who watched the baywatch
40:41
style video
40:42
were much likelier to take the small
40:44
payout now
40:45
rather than wait and defer their
40:47
gratification so it's
40:49
believed that this sort of the
40:50
neurochemical circuits of the brain get
40:52
hijacked and they're basically saying
40:53
pleasure now take pleasure now
40:55
oh yeah that makes a lot of sense yeah
40:57
okay when i was researching this i
40:59
remembered a scene that i watched in
41:01
a movie called the last emperor which is
41:02
about the chinese the final chinese
41:05
emperor before mao zedong
41:06
um kicked him out of power and there was
41:09
there's a scene in it where he's quite
41:10
old
41:11
and he's being breastfed by one of his
41:13
nurses
41:14
and he's like eight nine something like
41:16
that in there
41:17
um so i quickly looked into it and that
41:18
was a thing of chinese emperors that you
41:20
can actually see
41:21
um this really cool um looking device
41:24
which is a big steel
41:26
thing with a hole in the middle and
41:28
women who were basically
41:30
auditioning their breasts for the
41:32
emperor would kind of have their breasts
41:34
checked yeah
41:34
and to see if they were giving enough
41:36
milk and so on so they would
41:38
they would audition people and be like
41:40
you've why would you have that's the
41:41
breast factor
41:42
basically why would they need the steel
41:44
with the hole in the middle why
41:46
you don't need to put your breasts
41:47
through a hole in order to breastfeed i
41:49
don't know but unless it was like the
41:50
voice where you're not allowed to see
41:51
their faces
41:54
no so it wasn't a full steel door it was
41:56
just it was just for the breast and
41:58
there was a hole at the front where
41:59
presumably
42:00
how big how big was it i would say uh
42:03
a hardback book like the private eye
42:05
annual
42:06
like the like no smaller than the
42:08
private eye oh okay
42:10
but the third book of general ignorance
42:12
whereas the previous books of general
42:13
ignorance were a smaller format edition
42:15
yeah all available at qi.com
42:19
that is the worst plug for anything one
42:22
of
42:22
our books which are of different sizes
42:24
to the breastplates formally used
42:26
to feed the emperor's shoes
42:34

00:54
[Music]
00:55
hello and welcome to another episode of
00:58
no such thing as a fish
00:59
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
01:01
qi offices in covent garden
01:03
my name is dan schreiber and i'm sitting
01:05
here with james harkin
01:07
andrew hunter murray and anna chazinski
01:09
and once again we have gathered around
01:11
the microphones with our four favorite
01:13
facts from the last seven days
01:14
and in no particular order here we go
01:17
starting with you
01:18
andy murray my fact this week is that
01:20
the smallest football league in the
01:21
world
01:22
consists of two teams who play each
01:24
other 22 times
01:26
every season where is it
01:29
it's on the isles of scilly which is
01:32
just off cornwall
01:33
which is the southwest tip of britain
01:35
for anyone who's not from britain
01:36
listening
01:37
and um they're called the woolpack
01:38
wanderers and the garrison gunners
01:40
and they used to be called the rangers
01:42
and the rovers and then they thought
01:42
that was a bit boring so they should
01:44
make it more interesting
01:46
and it's weird that they did that
01:47
because you can only really call
01:49
yourself the gunners if you've got a
01:50
historical connection to
01:51
like in arsenal's case and armaments
01:53
factory and the wanderers
01:55
people are called that when they don't
01:56
have a permanent stadium which i assume
01:58
they always have because there aren't
01:59
any other teams in this place
02:00
yes so their names are lies i mean they
02:02
were
02:03
uh they've been playing since world war
02:05
one i believe
02:06
they must be knackered they've got he
02:09
forgot to mention how long the matches
02:11
are
02:12
half times coming up next year uh no
02:15
they
02:15
so maybe there is a connection
02:16
potentially for the gunners well they're
02:18
called the garrison gunners so is it not
02:20
to do with some kind of garrison
02:22
yeah i'm sure there was a garrison on
02:23
the isles of philly i don't know i don't
02:24
have the facts
02:25
you know i really like they play on the
02:27
same football pitch every time
02:29
but uh they swap for being a home and
02:31
away team so they're changing rooms they
02:33
change
02:34
to say away if for the awake team that
02:36
week and then home
02:37
on the next match but that means they're
02:39
the exact opposite of what you would
02:41
expect a wanderer's team to be then
02:43
it's true because not only have they
02:44
always played on the same pitch
02:46
they even play all their away games on
02:48
the same pitch as well
02:49
yeah it's very true and the the
02:51
wikipedia on them is
02:53
unbelievably cautious it says the league
02:55
is reportedly the smallest in the world
02:57
i do not believe there's a one team
02:59
league anywhere in the world
03:00
you know how they pick the teams they
03:02
pick them by every year a few weeks
03:04
before the season the captains of the
03:05
two teams they meet up in the pub
03:07
and no way they take turns no yes oh
03:10
like a school yard yeah yeah so they try
03:13
and make it so the teams are roughly
03:14
equal in ability
03:16
i was reading an interview with them
03:17
though and they don't seem to even know
03:18
which team they play for one of them
03:21
one of them was asked whose team he was
03:22
on and he said oh i'm wearing red which
03:25
team is that
03:28
but um just the isle of silly for the uh
03:31
people overseas who haven't heard of it
03:32
is incredibly small and
03:34
its population size uh as of 2001 that's
03:38
the last
03:38
update i've seen that i could find uh
03:40
2153 people so it's a very tiny
03:42
population
03:44
um but they've worked out that 32
03:45
percent of the population participate at
03:48
least three times a week in 30 minutes
03:50
more
03:50
sport way greater than any other bit of
03:52
britain but then one percent of the
03:54
population
03:55
are in one of these football teams
03:56
presumably that's amazing
03:59
yeah that's really good that must be the
04:00
highest anywhere i would think so
04:02
highest proportion of football players
04:04
anyway yeah professionals and also on
04:06
their teams i really like this
04:07
there's a huge gap um of the age bracket
04:10
of who plays
04:11
where they're majority missing 16 to 25
04:14
year olds
04:15
and the reason is because the schools in
04:17
uh the isle of silly only go up to sixth
04:20
form
04:20
um so when you're 16 you have to go to
04:22
the mainland to finish off your
04:23
schooling
04:24
and so they end up just staying on the
04:26
mainland when they come over rather than
04:27
going back
04:28
i used to go on holiday there as a kid
04:29
it's so lovely amazing bird watching oh
04:32
really
04:32
amazing birds did you ever see the silly
04:35
bee
04:38
this silly bee is this thing yeah it's a
04:41
kind of bee that you find on the silly
04:43
islands
04:43
that's great does it behave in a in a
04:46
silly way
04:48
it never collects any pollen uh it only
04:50
collects uh twiglets and things like
04:52
that it's such a silly bit
04:54
it just collects anecdotes
04:57
um yeah it's uh actually quite
04:59
endangered but they someone took a photo
05:01
of one in 2012
05:03
um because people thought they might
05:04
have even gone extinct
05:06
so um that was big news in the silly
05:08
islands
05:09
he did a really good job of transferring
05:11
really quickly from a laughter voice to
05:13
the very
05:14
solemn it's quite endangered voice quite
05:16
endangered
05:17
there's a serious side to the silly
05:19
beast
05:21
have you seen the the silly police force
05:23
is quite famous
05:24
around the world sorry now everything
05:27
sounds like
05:28
it's silly um it's they've only got two
05:30
officers
05:31
and i think they're i've read one thing
05:33
saying they're only posted for a certain
05:34
number of years so they don't get too
05:36
close to the local population and they
05:37
are it's five years five years
05:39
well i know but the last sergeant he
05:41
wrote a thing saying he'd been there for
05:42
seven years
05:43
so i don't know maybe no one liked it
05:47
um he had to borrow a child's bike once
05:49
to pursue a drunk driver
05:51
and this is a silly policeman you're
05:53
talking about exactly
05:55
i think he's a very good policeman but
05:56
and the one of the other cases that he
05:58
dealt with was
05:59
and i'm quoting here a shed door was
06:01
forced open at a football club but one
06:03
of the only clues available was a fried
06:05
egg
06:06
there's a right egg on the ground next
06:08
to this is
06:09
there any resolution to that story do we
06:11
know the case of the fried egg if there
06:13
is i don't have it
06:15
sorry an escaped chicken no they don't
06:19
fry their own eggs today doesn't make
06:20
any sense
06:23
um i was reading so the teams actually
06:26
do
06:26
team up as well to play against the
06:29
mainland
06:30
there's a team which is a massively
06:31
uneven contest to be fair
06:33
yeah so they play the england football
06:35
team no they don't they
06:36
they uh they play um who are they called
06:39
it's dynamo chuff
06:40
depends on yeah and so they play them
06:42
together and they have
06:44
a trophy that they use the lioness cup
06:46
and the lioness cup trophy
06:48
is the smallest trophy in the world um
06:50
or
06:51
in size you mean yeah in size it's very
06:53
tiny i think it's in the fifa
06:55
museum isn't it they took it for the
06:57
fifa museum for a year it's six
06:58
millimeters tall
07:00
wow very sweet that's smaller than a
07:02
silly bee
07:04
it was made by a carpenter from dynamo
07:07
troughs and his wife i think they're
07:08
artists
07:09
so is it made out of what then i think
07:11
it's made of wood and metal
07:12
um you're the oldest player in the
07:14
football league retired last year at the
07:15
age of 70.
07:16
70. yeah but i read that um the way that
07:19
they
07:19
play it sounds it doesn't sound overly
07:22
competitive
07:23
in that uh there's a journalist who is
07:25
going to play for the sake of writing an
07:27
article and uh and he he just kept
07:30
missing
07:31
the shot every time and he missed it
07:32
like 16 times uh but every time
07:35
he missed it everyone was really
07:36
encouraging and apparently that's the
07:37
whole thing it's just about so this 70
07:39
year old guy i bet
07:40
he's but but it doesn't matter
07:43
because they'll be listening to this
07:44
podcast
07:45
really sad looking at an empty six
07:47
millimeter high spot on his mantelpiece
07:55
well all i'm saying is he's 70 playing
07:57
against uh
07:59
you know ages that don't include 16 to
08:01
25 but everything else
08:03
he might he might be outplayed for his
08:05
age maybe not
08:06
the silly isles signed a peace treaty
08:09
with uh the netherlands a few years ago
08:11
to
08:12
end formerly the 335 years war between
08:15
the two countries
08:17
even though no one actually knows if the
08:19
335 years war
08:20
ever actually happened whoa so there's
08:23
there have been rumors since the 1600s
08:26
that war was declared between the
08:27
netherlands and the silly isles and then
08:29
other people say it can't even have been
08:30
declared because they're not a nation
08:32
and no one really knows but the sources
08:33
go back that far
08:34
and eventually at some point the city
08:36
isles wrote to the netherlands and said
08:38
look can we just acknowledge that
08:40
there's never been a war between us and
08:41
the netherlands said
08:42
we can't factually verify that i think
08:44
we're probably still at war so the city
08:45
owl said
08:46
okay well can we end the war please and
08:49
um
08:50
so yeah they they visited each other and
08:52
they signed a treaty saying we're at
08:54
peace it's amazing the ambassador came
08:55
over in a helicopter
08:57
to with a scroll to sign the piece
09:00
but the man the the admiral who declared
09:03
war on
09:03
the silly isles the dutch one was called
09:06
trump
09:08
i know so we don't know if he's any
09:09
relation um that's a long helicopter
09:12
ride
09:13
isn't it 300 years
09:16
we said that the ambassador got there by
09:18
helicopter it will have been
09:20
it would have been from the mainland uk
09:22
i guess mainland uk you have to
09:23
yeah no i was just suddenly thinking can
09:24
you go over the channel and how far can
09:26
you go in a helicopter you can go over
09:27
the channel
09:28
how bad do you think helicopters are do
09:30
you think you just throw them and then
09:31
they go as far as you can
09:33
they just don't look like they have much
09:34
fuel they could go about 300 miles
09:36
like just a small helicopter and then
09:38
the big ones could go how far is that
09:40
you just ask how far 300 miles is so you
09:43
know a mile
09:45
yeah 300 of those we can't reduce it
09:48
further than that
09:50
and the netherlands is very close okay
09:53
we used to always get a helicopter over
09:54
i think they've cancelled it now but
09:55
when i used to go as a kid
09:57
it was the only way that you'd go over
09:58
except for the ferry crossing yeah i
10:00
think they might be gonna bring it back
10:01
oh really either they're gonna bring it
10:03
back or just have brought it back or
10:04
they said they were going to and haven't
10:06
done
10:07
one of those covering your options from
10:10
james harkin
10:13
i do have a fact about the longest and
10:15
shortest things in the world because
10:17
it's about the
10:17
world's smallest league of football
10:20
yeah but i'm afraid it's about the
10:22
world's largest
10:23
penis oh god the world's largest
10:27
penis is only two inches shorter than
10:29
the world's smallest
10:30
man wow
10:34
are they on the same person no
10:39
this is a man called roberto esquivel
10:41
cabrera who
10:42
says his penis is 19 inches long it's
10:45
not
10:46
hard to verify that well there are how
10:48
long is 19 inches
10:53
it's a short helicopter journey i'll say
10:57
[Applause]
10:58
that
11:00
[Music]
11:01
okay it is time for fact number two and
11:04
that
11:05
is chozinski my fact this week is that
11:08
in the 1940s in america
11:10
if you wanted to play a recording of a
11:12
banned song on the radio
11:14
the entire band had to be present in the
11:16
studio while you played it
11:18
[Laughter]
11:20
this is about a musician's strike in
11:22
america between 1941 and 1943
11:25
about the fact that recorded music was
11:27
being played on the radio and so
11:29
musicians thought they were going to go
11:30
out of business because
11:31
they were no longer being paid to play
11:32
live music and so
11:34
they went on strike and one of their
11:36
demands was that every time a recording
11:39
was played
11:39
so the musicians didn't lose out every
11:42
single person involved in making that
11:43
recording had to turn up in the studio
11:45
and then be paid the fee
11:46
that they would be paid for that's
11:48
amazing incredible why would they then
11:50
still just play the recording and not
11:51
have the band play
11:52
maybe it's more effort to get your
11:54
studio set up and get the sound all
11:55
sorted yeah i guess so yeah
11:57
if anyone's listening to this podcast we
11:58
will be turning up in your house
12:03
oh god i'm gonna have to meet that seven
12:04
year old man
12:11
[Laughter]
12:14
um just speaking of recreations and that
12:16
was another thing that was very popular
12:18
in the 1940s going back to the 20s and
12:20
as late as the 50s where they would
12:22
recreate sport events
12:24
because it was too hard to get live
12:26
recording so if there was a baseball
12:27
match
12:28
that was going on while the baseball
12:30
match was going on they would relay the
12:31
information
12:32
about how the game was going back to a
12:34
studio and
12:35
the commentator would commentate as if
12:37
it was live match
12:39
yeah but they would um he would have a
12:41
bat that was hanging next to
12:42
his microphone which he would hit
12:44
anytime there was a hit and they would
12:46
have
12:46
crowd noise played in and so on and they
12:48
would commentate live no
12:50
yeah it was it was all a recreation
12:52
because it was too expensive to get the
12:54
lines
12:54
to mic up an entire stadium did they
12:57
wait did they have
12:58
all the sports equipment hanging in the
12:59
studio because they must have had to
13:01
depending on what they thought
13:03
the coconut to the horse rating and one
13:06
of the uh one of the sports announcers
13:08
was ronald reagan in his early days when
13:11
he was an actor wow
13:12
that is so funny that's really funny
13:14
yeah amazing james you had a fact about
13:16
darts didn't you
13:17
about dance um yeah they used to in the
13:19
old days they used to have darts on the
13:21
radio
13:22
and the way they would do it is you'd
13:24
get a darts player and he would throw
13:25
the darts at a board
13:27
and then the guy would say tell you what
13:28
he got and then there'd be silence while
13:30
you were allowed to throw your own darts
13:32
and then would be like playing against
13:34
the guy so cool
13:36
it's so good why don't we do that kind
13:38
of stuff anymore
13:39
well i think it's because we have
13:40
playstations
13:41
[Music]
13:42
[Laughter]
13:44
very good point so you know old
13:48
recording studios were really cramped
13:50
and also they didn't have very good
13:51
technology to do the recording
13:53
so for example you had maybe one
13:56
recording horn right and you had to
13:59
posit which was soaking up all the sound
14:01
and you had to get the band positioned
14:03
around it in exactly the right way that
14:05
when they played
14:06
the instruments wouldn't drown each
14:07
other out yeah and sorry and by horn you
14:10
mean something that takes in the sound
14:11
you don't mean sorry
14:12
i don't mean a french horn which gives
14:13
out yeah or a clown car horn
14:16
as james just brilliantly did the sound
14:19
effect for
14:20
the horn
14:23
of being sexually uh aroused yeah not
14:26
no one had an erection in this room
14:28
either okay can you guarantee that
14:30
i can't guarantee that so anyway
14:32
basically
14:33
singers had the worst time of all
14:34
because they had to move towards the
14:36
horn when they were singing quietly
14:39
and when they had a loud bit coming up
14:40
in the song they had to lean away from
14:41
the recording horn so that they didn't
14:43
you know drown everybody out
14:45
but inexperienced soloists got pushed
14:46
back and forth on a trolley
14:48
by an assistant
14:51
it's amazing wow how hard is it
14:54
to lead
14:58
people who've complained about the sound
14:59
quality on this podcast are thinking you
15:01
guys could do with doing that
15:02
yeah we're all on a trolley at the
15:04
moment that's the problem
15:07
our wheelie chairs with alex bell
15:08
running around
15:12
so how long did the strike go yeah yeah
15:14
i'll just talk about the strike a little
15:15
bit more so it went on for
15:16
two years it's the longest ever strike
15:18
in hollywood entertainment industry
15:20
history and some other weird things
15:22
about it so the guy who led it was this
15:24
guy called petrillo
15:26
one of the things that petrillo said
15:27
that radio stations would have to do one
15:29
of the demands he made and i'm not sure
15:31
if he ever got around to enforcing it
15:32
was that as soon as any station had
15:34
played a record they had to immediately
15:36
destroy that record
15:43
but one thing that happened in the end
15:45
was um it
15:46
led to the decline of the big bands and
15:49
then it just became more
15:51
about the singers than the bands yeah so
15:53
it didn't have the intended effect
15:55
long term did it not at all almost the
15:56
opposite in fact i find it amazing that
15:59
this was all going on from when did you
16:00
say 1942 to 44.
16:02
yes during a period of total war i know
16:05
around the world
16:06
i think this was the main thing that was
16:08
eating a load of people you're right it
16:10
feels weird the musician's like we're
16:11
going on strike
16:13
yeah all the time mate i thought i'd
16:14
have a look at some of the um
16:16
songs that were in the charts in the 40s
16:19
um
16:19
so one famous one was white christmas
16:22
which was
16:22
um number one for 11 weeks in 1942. is
16:25
this american or british
16:26
this is the billboard american challenge
16:28
yeah so white christmas was number one
16:30
for 11 weeks and i was quite surprised
16:31
it first got number one
16:32
in october that year
16:36
kind of interesting so all this whining
16:37
about christmas starting too early
16:38
actually it's always done
16:40
and um in 1941 so a bit before this
16:42
strike um there was
16:44
things like chattanooga choo-choo as
16:45
number one songs like blue champagne my
16:48
sister and i
16:49
um but on october the 4th of 1941 for
16:53
eight weeks
16:54
the number one song in america was piano
16:56
concerto number one in b flat minor by
16:59
tchaikovsky
17:01
that was top of the charts wow i thought
17:03
he was around way earlier
17:06
1940s yeah
17:09
but they had to have his body in the
17:11
studio whenever they played it
17:14
costly exhuming
17:18
um i should say that i got this fact
17:19
from a website called timeline it's
17:21
timeline.com and it's such a good
17:23
website
17:23
and it basically tells you in-depth
17:25
stories uh sort of
17:27
from history sort of related to stuff
17:28
that happens in the news but it's a
17:30
brilliant website and they got this from
17:32
a podcast that i've just discovered
17:34
called the pessimists archive which is
17:36
also great and the idea of this podcast
17:38
is it's about
17:39
stuff that throughout history people
17:40
have been terrified of change
17:42
and they've always said this is going to
17:43
destroy it oh cool so and they have
17:45
loads of examples of that so you know
17:47
trains thought buses were going to
17:48
destroy them um
17:50
horses and carts campaigned against
17:51
trains because they thought trains were
17:53
going to destroy them which they did
17:54
people thought that the radio was really
17:56
damaging for your ears and for kids
17:58
people thought walkman should be banned
17:59
it's so it's really interesting
18:00
pessimist archive
18:02
um is i would recommend i wonder how
18:05
many
18:05
bits of new technology have just been
18:06
outright accepted as the
18:08
the right way forward like airplanes
18:11
they thought would never
18:12
yeah never thought they'd take off
18:14
[Laughter]
18:17
do you know they played music on apollo
18:19
11. really
18:21
apparently like in the lift when you
18:24
like was like when they were waiting to
18:25
take off while they were going
18:27
while they were going to keep them calm
18:29
that's amazing you're kidding what
18:31
during takeoff apparently
18:32
wow did they also have awesome buttons
18:35
like in a lift and one of them said moon
18:40
jupiter yeah
18:42
[Applause]
18:45
[Music]
18:47
okay it is time for fact number three
18:49
and that is my fact
18:50
my fact this week is that the british
18:52
library has a collection of over 60
18:54
million newspapers
18:56
and none of them can catch fire you
18:58
cannot light
18:59
any of them on fire give us a go i've
19:02
got a flamethrower
19:04
are they kept in water or anything in a
19:08
vacuum
19:08
yeah no it's uh so the british library
19:11
uh obviously
19:12
ginormous archive um too big to even fit
19:15
in one
19:15
place in london in some pancras where
19:17
the british library is so they have a
19:19
warehouse out
19:20
in a place called boston spa which is
19:22
out in the countryside of england and
19:24
in there they house all of the newspaper
19:26
archive this goes back some three
19:27
centuries
19:28
and it's a collection of 60 million so
19:30
what they've done in there is that
19:32
they've reduced
19:33
the oxygen level to a lower percentage
19:36
which means it's impossible to light a
19:38
flame inside that you cannot light a
19:39
match you cannot make your lighter
19:41
produce a flame therefore you are unable
19:43
to light any of the newspapers in there
19:46
uh it's very clever so cool yeah you
19:48
can't actually work in that building for
19:49
too long because
19:51
you go a bit loopy employees don't
19:53
actually really need to be down there
19:54
for long because the whole thing is
19:56
operated by robots it's an amazing
19:58
amazing department um but when they do
20:01
go in they're only allowed in for so
20:02
long because the oxygen level is so low
20:04
it's the same amount of oxygen as is in
20:07
a pressurized air cabin
20:09
in an airplane i didn't quite realize
20:11
how much the oxygen levels are reduced
20:13
when a
20:14
aircraft cabin is pressurized but
20:15
they're reduced by 25
20:17
just because the of the pressurization
20:19
oh and reducing it by 25
20:21
ends up with it being the equivalent of
20:23
15 oxygen
20:25
concentration at sea level which is
20:27
about the same and the only reason we
20:28
don't really notice is because you don't
20:29
really do anything on a plane but if you
20:30
try to run a marathon
20:32
up and down that corridor you'd be in
20:35
trouble for a number of reasons
20:36
a marathon is 26 and a bit miles down
20:39
and how long is that it's a
20:42
medium-length helicopter right yeah
20:44
yeah it and also it's all in the dark
20:46
this warehouse because robots don't need
20:47
lights
20:48
i think it's a bit harsh that these
20:50
robots have to work in the dark
20:52
i know they're robots but it just feels
20:54
like you know give them a light
20:56
they hate like they're like vampires how
20:58
they meant to read in there
21:00
maybe it's to stop them from reading so
21:02
they wouldn't be doing their job yeah
21:03
if you're a member of the british
21:05
library and you request one uh the robot
21:07
goes to the shelf it gets down the thing
21:09
and then it goes to an
21:10
airlock and it passes the thing through
21:13
the airlock to a human on the other side
21:15
so that it preserves the oxygen levels
21:16
in the room how cool is that yeah and
21:18
then in most cases
21:19
they do have a reading room there but a
21:21
lot of it is ordered from
21:23
the central london uh library so it gets
21:26
in a van and they just bring it over it
21:27
says bringing these
21:28
it's a lot of effort to read a newspaper
21:29
it's amazing yeah although you can most
21:31
of it's digitized i think so the british
21:33
library is paired up with the british
21:34
newspaper archive which i think i
21:35
constantly mention
21:36
and they're digitizing most of their
21:38
newspapers on that and i think you're
21:40
only allowed to extract something from
21:42
this place in boston spa
21:43
if it's not available digitally right
21:46
away thing about boston spa
21:47
it's a very small place in new york
21:49
share it's got a wikipedia page very
21:50
short
21:51
nowhere does it mention on its wikipedia
21:53
page that it constitutes the entire
21:55
british library newspaper archive
21:57
i think someone needs to add that in the
21:59
first library
22:00
in britain manchester free library which
22:03
opened in 1852
22:05
in manchester and it had 18 000 books
22:08
and it was so popular in its first week
22:10
that a police officer was assigned to
22:12
control the crowd around the borrowing
22:14
desk
22:15
wow and the first librarian was called
22:17
edward
22:18
edwards
22:18
[Laughter]
22:22
i was reading a thing about so libraries
22:24
um
22:25
keep shutting down and one of the things
22:27
as well that happens in a lot of
22:28
libraries is if a book
22:30
doesn't get borrowed then they get taken
22:33
off the library shelf okay
22:35
and what that means is if the library
22:37
actually wants to keep the book they end
22:38
up having to buy the book back
22:40
to put on their shelf so it costs them a
22:41
lot of money so there is a
22:44
library in orlando where they found a
22:47
guy
22:47
who checked out 2 361 books
22:51
in the span of nine months and it turned
22:53
out it was the librarian there who
22:55
created
22:56
a false library card and the idea was is
22:59
that now that he borrowed it
23:00
uh it was on it was in circulation and
23:03
you get paid for circulation as well it
23:04
brings in funds
23:06
but he got in serious trouble because
23:07
it's very illegal to fake
23:09
of being a library borrower that's a
23:12
shame because that is a brilliant idea
23:13
yeah it's a great scheme to get the
23:15
library he was
23:15
funding it yeah he was saying that he
23:17
was saving money technically because
23:19
uh they would just buy the books back
23:21
anyway so it was just him
23:22
trying to be a bit cheeky about keeping
23:24
the books without it costing the library
23:26
anything but unfortunately it was
23:28
seen as illegal and he's now in jail for
23:29
life what
23:38
plausible about the american justice
23:40
system he was placed on paid suspension
23:43
um oh okay it does sound a bit like like
23:45
playing your own songs on spotify
23:47
non-stop
23:48
yes that kind of thing that's a good
23:50
idea
23:51
people do it don't they do they i mean
23:53
there was a band who did that we spoke
23:54
about on the podcast ages ago i think
23:56
they're called wolf pack or something
23:57
like that
23:58
memory yeah they uh what they did was
24:01
they
24:01
streamed their album and told everyone
24:04
to stream it
24:05
because if they if it went enough so
24:07
they said when you go to bed just stream
24:08
it over and over put on repeat but put
24:10
it on low volume when you know
24:11
it wasn't a silent album yeah yeah yeah
24:13
yeah sorry so the volume thing was
24:14
nothing yeah yeah and they did make a
24:16
lot of money which funded their tour
24:18
um but they got caught out by spotify
24:20
and they're all in prison
24:21
for life
24:24
there is an archive called the london
24:26
metropolitan archives and they have
24:28
um a whole collection of old london
24:30
records sort of
24:31
parish records and city records and
24:33
things like this but many of them are
24:34
unbelievably badly burned
24:36
from a fire that happened in 1786
24:40
and then what happened was after the
24:42
fire they said we should preserve these
24:43
records
24:44
just in case and now 200 and something
24:47
years later what that's nearly 240 years
24:49
later
24:50
there are becoming able to read them
24:52
what do you mean
24:53
what they've been doing is they've been
24:54
preserving the pages very carefully in
24:56
boxes and then they increase the
24:57
humidity
24:59
and they sort of puff them out and then
25:00
they scan them and then they can
25:02
digitally flatten the pages
25:03
so you kind of unburn them a little bit
25:05
basically yeah you can unburn something
25:07
by getting it wet
25:09
and no you increase the humidity i don't
25:10
know if that is wetness yeah okay good
25:12
point
25:13
and then oh yeah and they use magnets to
25:15
hold the page flat while they're
25:16
scanning it or as flat as they can
25:18
i mean it's unbelievably clever but
25:20
basically it's meaning that they can
25:21
suddenly read
25:22
all these things but all that we find
25:23
out is that mr jones lived on
25:25
high hoben there could be clues in here
25:27
james that could be important clues to
25:29
how we save everything all i'm saying is
25:30
it's a lot of effort to just learn
25:33
a list of names of people getting
25:35
married and stuff
25:36
you love reading long lists of
25:37
information james this is right up your
25:39
street
25:39
but just the vision of keeping these
25:41
things for two hundred years
25:42
is just in case we're just doing
25:44
technology yeah read them again i kind
25:46
of think that's incredibly admirable
25:47
yeah that's great james thinks it's
25:49
absolutely worthless
25:52
i think the money could be spent better
25:54
elsewhere yeah build more libraries
25:57
and then take thousands of books out of
25:58
them at a time
26:02
[Applause]
26:05
[Music]
26:06
okay it is time for our final fact of
26:08
the show and that is
26:10
james okay my fact this week is that the
26:13
man who invented mulled wine
26:15
also invented an aphrodisiac sorbet
26:20
well yes he did well a man did both of
26:23
those things
26:25
um mulled wine is kind of pretty old
26:28
pretty ancient um but bluevine which is
26:30
the german version of it
26:32
uh has a guy who is often called the
26:35
inventor of it
26:36
he's called auguste joseph ludwig von
26:39
wackabath
26:41
which is a pretty strong name and he is
26:44
the author of the oldest
26:45
extant recipe so in germany they call
26:47
him the father of mulldwine
26:49
and um quite recently some historians
26:52
found some writings of his
26:53
of a recipe for aphrodisiac sorbet
26:57
and the sorbet is made with the
27:00
delicious whites of two eggs
27:02
the juice of two lemons two pounds of
27:04
sugar a few grains of ambergris
27:06
hold on it's done writing this down
27:11
dan just whipped out his pen and started
27:13
scrolling notes on his page
27:14
so then two two eggs two eggs yeah
27:17
uh two lemons two pounds of sugar um
27:20
some amber grease
27:21
and delicious lozenges from the pharmacy
27:24
four ounces of oh great strepsils but we
27:27
don't know what's
27:28
in the lozenges that's the problem you
27:30
see that might be the magic ingredient
27:32
and all it says and also it's
27:34
one pound of sugar per egg i mean that's
27:36
quite a sugary recipe but also it has an
27:38
incredibly expensive recipe in there
27:40
because it's using ambergris
27:41
yeah which which you subtly slipped in
27:43
like just some sugar some milk some
27:44
solid diamond
27:46
and yeah
27:49
but if you don't have that you can use
27:51
the glandular secretions of a muskrat
27:53
oh good well we got a lot of that
27:58
no what i was writing down was he's
27:59
called the father of mulled wine
28:02
i was wondering if that he was called
28:04
that because that's just way easier to
28:05
say than his actual name
28:09
august joseph ludwig vogner what's hard
28:13
about that
28:13
you're right he seemed it's a it's a
28:16
shame
28:16
a lot of the articles on him online uh
28:19
there's a lot of results when he put his
28:20
name in but they're all in german
28:21
and uh i really want to read more about
28:24
this guy
28:25
but i didn't have time today so you have
28:26
time to learn german
28:29
when are you gonna get that done over
28:30
the weekend yeah yeah
28:33
um he is a wild claim isn't it this
28:35
father of mulled wine because
28:36
people have been drinking heated up uh
28:38
wine and alcoholic drink since the dawn
28:40
of time so i think peeps talks about
28:42
drinking it
28:43
right um and the ancient greeks as well
28:46
the ancients
28:47
from even before the time of samuel
28:48
peeps yeah well you said dawn of time
28:51
which is i think a bit
28:52
bit far back did i say i said from when
28:55
when we've been drinking
29:07
[Laughter]
29:10
do you know how they used to heat it um
29:12
and i think they still do heat it
29:14
over a flame no no not over a flame oh
29:18
and a microwave
29:19
yeah that's right that's okay people did
29:21
it in some dung uh eats things
29:23
no oh maybe maybe some of them did that
29:25
cutting open the body of a horse
29:27
and putting it in there and pouring it
29:28
into there and then you drink it from
29:30
the
29:30
orifice the latent heat of the early
29:33
universe
29:38
just the big bang was a hot time
29:39
automatically it was a trick question
29:42
it's still warming
29:43
[Laughter]
29:46
all mulled wine gets here from comets um
29:49
know that well peeps records how they
29:51
would get a
29:52
poker really really hot over the fire so
29:54
you'd hold a poker over the fire and
29:55
then you'd have a huge vat of um
29:57
beer it often was in those days uh or
29:59
wine and then you'd stir it with a hot
30:01
poker
30:01
so you'd still have a barrel of beer
30:03
with a poker that's really clever yeah
30:05
that's cool
30:06
does that work really well or it would
30:08
work
30:09
it would work of course so like if i
30:10
wanted to make a tea but i didn't have a
30:12
if you had you didn't have a pencil you
30:14
did have a red hot poker yeah
30:17
yeah would that work i guess could you
30:18
get the water boiling hot
30:20
yeah you could i suppose yeah maybe
30:22
because you know you need it quite hot
30:24
to make a really good cup of tea
30:25
yeah but i mean the cup's not that big
30:27
is it so i
30:28
imagine the mulled wine that's a pot so
30:30
yeah you don't want to damage the cup
30:32
that you're making your tea in either
30:33
and if you're waggling around a red hot
30:35
poker in it you might
30:37
um so the victorians had a version of
30:39
mulled wine which they called smoking
30:41
bishop
30:41
that kind of thing yeah that was a thing
30:43
it was it was port
30:44
it was port fruit and spices um but they
30:47
had also smoking archbishop
30:50
uh which was with clara and smoking pope
30:52
and in a christmas carol
30:54
scrooge promises bob cratchit some
30:56
smoking bishop
30:57
let's see yeah you could have quite a
30:59
fun night if you were a bishop with some
31:01
smoking bishop and then you could eat
31:02
some stinking bishop the cheese
31:04
yeah oh yeah if there are any bishops
31:06
listening who want to
31:07
know how to party
31:08
[Laughter]
31:12
but wait it wasn't just bishops who were
31:14
allowed to drink it right no it was
31:15
everyone who was like drinking it was
31:16
just a name so you don't have to be a
31:17
bishop
31:18
who knows how to party you can be anyone
31:20
who knows how to party that's true yeah
31:21
yeah can we do some aphrodisiac stuff
31:23
yeah okay no sir no uh what i was going
31:26
to say is um they did
31:27
an experiment with some rats where they
31:30
took out
31:30
one of the ingredients of ambergris
31:32
which is ambrian
31:33
so it's like a type of a compound and
31:36
they gave it to the rats
31:38
and it um produced an increase of
31:41
anal genital investigatory behavior
31:44
so let's unpack that a second
31:47
investigator okay got it yeah yeah yeah
31:49
so i think all those words are self
31:52
you know absolutely yeah yeah really
31:54
what friday night is complete without
31:58
the spot of whatever
32:00
[Laughter]
32:03
a genital investigatory behavior
32:05
absolutely yep
32:06
only works in rats though apparently
32:08
well we don't know
32:10
i think we need to do the investigation
32:12
for humans
32:13
god i don't think we need to i think
32:14
other people need to
32:16
it only works really in male rats as
32:18
well the female rats aren't that
32:19
interested
32:20
right um ain't no genitally or otherwise
32:25
above that kind of thing hey i'm just
32:26
wondering if you're interested in me
32:28
aerogenically or otherwise
32:34
it's a good word isn't it yeah
32:37
you're being really anal genital about
32:39
this mark
32:46
i've never actually seen that shortened
32:47
to that before no no
32:49
neither it's where um a volcano is made
32:51
up of
32:52
two words folk and ano right because it
32:55
thought people thought it was um
32:57
vulcan the god yeah his anus that's
32:59
right fire into the sky
33:03
yeah gwyneth paltrow sells aphrodisiacs
33:07
and this is a way of talking about her
33:09
website which
33:10
i know this is very low brow for us to
33:12
go into this subject but it's
33:13
unbelievable
33:14
her website called goop.com okay which
33:17
she sells extraordinary things on there
33:19
so she's like
33:21
and for how much
33:24
and uh if you're listening this week's
33:25
episode of no such thing as a fish it's
33:27
practically brought to you by goop
33:30
for all your anal genital needs
33:33
so for this ain't genital need you can
33:34
get sex bark um
33:36
which is yeah a sex bottle it's worse
33:39
than it's sex bites
33:44
um yeah it's like chocolate except then
33:48
you have to add something called
33:50
to it which is sex dust and i don't it
33:53
doesn't really specify where you get
33:55
that
33:55
it sounds to me like she's just taking
33:57
objects and putting the word sex in
33:59
front of them
34:00
as the um has the sex cleaner being
34:02
there's a lot of sex dust on top of the
34:04
sex piano
34:07
but she also sells um jade eggs do you
34:10
know what these are
34:11
are they are they made out of jade the
34:13
material i believe they are they
34:15
they claim to be they're also called
34:17
yoni eggs and they're advertised on
34:19
goop.com
34:20
as uh once strictly guarded secret of
34:22
chinese concubines and royalty in
34:24
antiquity
34:25
and they harness the power of energy
34:27
crystal healing and a kegel-like
34:29
physical practice so it's all very
34:30
scientifically
34:31
sound and what you do is you put them
34:33
into your vagina
34:34
and you sit there with one in for a
34:36
while and it makes you feel better
34:38
it's strange that they didn't call them
34:40
sex jade eggs isn't it yeah
34:42
i guess you hadn't developed that
34:43
particular marketing twist yet
34:45
and then you have to pass them again
34:47
presumably you pass them out again yeah
34:49
of the same plucking
34:54
uh wow that's yeah wow that's yeah cool
34:58
that's okay i mean if it's consenting
34:59
adults nothing criminal about
35:02
it no no um galen said that any food
35:06
which made you flatulence was an
35:07
aphrodisiac
35:09
any warm moist and windy foods were ones
35:12
that produced lust
35:13
and did he do well with women
35:20
um saffron can help you have a sustained
35:23
erection they found
35:24
wow there was a 2009 study in iran and
35:28
the 20 male patients were given saffron
35:30
for 10 days
35:31
and they showed a statistically
35:34
significant improvement in
35:35
apparently their tip rigidity and tiptum
35:38
essence
35:39
as well as base rigidity and base
35:41
tumescence but no word on the middle
35:43
hang on
35:43
[Laughter]
35:48
so it's a bit like you know the the
35:50
slinky dog in toy story
35:55
i was reading about an aphrodisiac uh
35:57
this is the title of the um
35:58
the story can a rare hawaiian mushroom
36:01
really give women a spontaneous orgasm
36:03
and this was a 15 year old study not by
36:07
sorry let me start that again my
36:10
steadies continue into the rare
36:12
mushroom impersonation of a 15 year old
36:15
that's what i sounded like
36:19
were you in some 41 when be the biggest
36:26
podcast revealed
36:27
ever andy's grunge past
36:34
this is a study that was done in 2001
36:37
and
36:38
these two medical students uh published
36:39
a report in the international journal of
36:41
medicinal mushrooms
36:43
and they did this study on 36 volunteers
36:46
both male and female
36:47
and they found that this mushroom this
36:51
hawaiian mushroom was causing
36:52
spontaneous orgasm
36:54
in a bunch of the women a part of the
36:57
study group
36:58
and so everyone says it's not a big
36:59
enough study group in order for that to
37:01
be a truth so it's a very dubious thing
37:03
and the article i was reading saying
37:05
actually no it can't give you
37:06
spontaneous orgasm what i was wondering
37:08
though was if we thought that it did i
37:10
wonder if there's a sort of placebo
37:12
effect
37:13
with it therefore could you placebo an
37:15
orgasm
37:16
well almost all aphrodisiacs and things
37:19
that are sold at aphrodisiacs
37:21
trade on the placebo effect yeah do they
37:22
oh yeah right so
37:24
oysters and all that like the the actual
37:26
evidence for them changing
37:27
chemicals in your body to make you more
37:29
interested in sex
37:30
is pretty slim yeah although they don't
37:32
claim spontaneous orgasms to be fair
37:34
that's another
37:35
i think when you have an aphrodisiac you
37:36
also need to have some other sexual
37:38
stimulation right
37:39
you don't just eat ten oysters and stand
37:41
there going why haven't i orgasm
37:47
um i don't know darling keep trying i'm
37:49
doing the crossword
37:58
okay that's it that is all of our facts
38:00

[Applause]
00:14
hello
00:15
and welcome to another episode of no
00:17
such thing as a fish
00:18
a weekly podcast coming to you from the
00:20
qi offices in covent garden
00:22
my name is dan schreiber i'm sitting
00:24
here with james harkin
00:25
andrew hunter murray and anna chazinski
00:28
and once again we have gathered around
00:29
the microphones with our four favorite
00:31
facts from the last seven days
00:33
and in no particular order here we go
00:36
starting with you
00:37
james okay my fact this week is that
00:40
british warships are so
00:42
noisy that enemy submarines can hear
00:44
them from
00:45
100 miles away what's going on on board
00:48
these ships
00:50
disco night yeah so um this
00:53
basically is the type 45 destroyer and i
00:56
think we've mentioned them before
00:57
they've had a lot of troubles
00:58
uh they were the ones who broke down in
01:00
warm water yes
01:02
and they also rattle very loudly uh and
01:05
they used to stop it by putting little
01:07
wooden wedges
01:09
between the hatches and that would stop
01:11
them from rattling but they've kind of
01:12
stopped doing that now
01:13
just because they've run out of patience
01:15
and now our warships are rattling around
01:18
the seas
01:19
and anyone who wants to know they're
01:20
around doesn't even have to use any
01:22
detection they can just get
01:23
wow if you're in a submarine yeah you
01:26
can't really hear that well underwater
01:28
you can hear better underwater no that's
01:30
what well only in the sound you ever
01:32
tried to have a chat with someone
01:33
underwater yeah but sound does move
01:35
quicker through liquid than through air
01:37
really yeah because the molecules are
01:38
closer together i guess so
01:40
but then they're in a tin so like
01:41
they're not in the water it's
01:43
i just don't know they're not using
01:44
their actual ears to hear it right no i
01:46
would say
01:46
people in submarines if you're detecting
01:49
things through sound then usually it
01:51
would be sonar rather than people
01:52
sticking their ears out
01:54
of the hatch i just want to get
01:55
clarification there is a new submarine
01:57
that the
01:58
uh the swedish are building they're
02:00
building these incredibly advanced
02:01
submarines and one of the features they
02:02
have
02:03
is there's a pod in it where the
02:05
submarine can land on the bottom of the
02:07
sea
02:08
and then the pod opens and special
02:10
forces can leave the submarine
02:12
uh plant mines or do whatever they need
02:14
to do on the bottom of the sea and then
02:16
go back in
02:17
that's very unusual isn't it very only
02:19
because first of all submarines don't
02:21
really like
02:22
to actually touch the bottom of the
02:24
ocean do they
02:25
because then they can get stuck like the
02:27
cursed one good point this was just a
02:29
concept drawing so maybe i've
02:30
misunderstood
02:31
also mines in the water you don't tend
02:33
to dig them underneath the sea otherwise
02:35
all you're going to do is blow up some
02:37
fish
02:38
and crabs yeah it's not like the
02:40
old-school scuba divers with the
02:42
huge bell and rope thing it does feel to
02:44
me like you've seen an eight-year-old
02:46
destroyed
02:47
but it's more effective to catch scuba
02:49
divers because they're wearing their big
02:50
flippers on their feet so they're more
02:52
likely to tread on a mine that's true
02:54
but
02:54
the flippers will mean that there's less
02:56
pressure because they're wider
02:58
but there is pressure pushing down from
02:59
the ocean so the additional pressure of
03:01
the flipper
03:02
but you don't walk along the floor and
03:04
flippers have you ever tried to open
03:05
them
03:07
never let them touch the ground you
03:10
could walk on tiptoe on the flippers
03:11
which would give you extra height and
03:13
which would give you actually less of
03:15
a surface space to be standing on lines
03:17
there are some fish which um have
03:19
their extended fins and so they kind of
03:22
walk on the bottom of the ocean
03:24
oh yeah tripod fish they're called
03:26
aren't they um do you know
03:27
so sweden only has five submarines
03:30
they but they are incredibly good and
03:32
incredibly quiet as well they're so
03:34
stealthy
03:35
so for example they're mostly used
03:37
because sweden doesn't really fight many
03:38
people but they are mostly used by
03:40
the american navy to play the russians
03:43
and the last time they did a big war
03:44
gaming exercise the swedish submarines
03:46
got through all the american defenses
03:48
and sort of virtually torpedoed the
03:49
entire american navy oh wow yeah without
03:51
being detected it was
03:52
is there not a danger that one day then
03:54
sweden this lovely peacemaking nation is
03:56
going to think hang on
03:57
we're really good at this as well should
03:59
we try actually
04:01
not making it a game this time sweden
04:03
used to own sort of a third of europe
04:05
they used to have a massive massive
04:06
empire they invaded russia
04:08
while simultaneously fighting france i
04:10
think they're crazy
04:12
don't invade russia while simultaneously
04:13
fighting another country no i know
04:15
people
04:15
anyway the submarines are made by saab
04:17
is the main thing i wanted to say
04:22
[Laughter]
04:25
well we reached some pretty high points
04:26
of punary quite early on today
04:29
i don't know where to go from here um so
04:31
one way that submarines
04:33
are hiding themselves or planning on
04:34
hiding themselves in future is with
04:36
bubble wrap
04:37
do you see this what is it wrapping
04:39
themselves in just bubbles
04:41
or yeah but not sea bubbles this is
04:43
obviously in submarines there's a
04:44
problem of
04:45
uh trying to avoid detection by like
04:48
boats and other submarines
04:49
sonar and radar and so they've developed
04:52
this kind of bubble wrap which is
04:54
kind of plastic material that they're
04:55
planning to put on the outside of
04:56
submarines then it will deflect radar
04:59
oh wow and i mean they're impossible to
05:01
spot also i mean they're really fun
05:03
because you just keep popping them all
05:05
the time wouldn't you but then you get
05:06
detected that's the problem
05:08
that's true only by five-year-olds
05:12
um the thing about bubbles that's
05:15
interesting i don't know if we've
05:16
mentioned this before
05:17
is that a torpedo when it hits a
05:19
submarine
05:20
the torpedo doesn't hit the submarine it
05:22
explodes just before the submarine
05:24
and it's the bubbles that bring down the
05:26
ship
05:27
yeah it's extraordinary it's like it
05:29
explodes as a massive vacuum which is
05:31
like a bubble and that will force the
05:33
hull apart wow ah because it would fool
05:36
you as well into thinking you were safe
05:37
when you saw it explode before i hear
05:38
you'd be like
05:39
idiots
05:42
[Laughter]
05:44
is there you know how airports have
05:46
flight uh controllers who sort of
05:48
shepherd in the planes you know in in
05:52
an order plain shepherds yeah the plain
05:53
shepherds i think sometimes they call
05:56
them
05:56
uh traffic controllers but that's just a
05:58
slang thing yeah yeah it's a slang term
06:00
for plane shepards yeah yeah so are
06:01
there submarine shepherds
06:02
do they do they because if you've got
06:04
let's say you send out like a fleet of
06:06
your own submarines and they've all got
06:07
this amazing invisible detection thing
06:10
they'll just be slamming into each other
06:11
on the way out the harbor right so
06:13
is that a thing i don't think because we
06:15
don't have as many submarines as we have
06:17
commercial
06:18
planes i don't think we're sending 200
06:20
of them out in the space of three hours
06:22
there must be occasionally where it's
06:23
like let's launch them all because
06:25
you know sweden's decided to take over
06:27
everything again
06:28
i think britain only has one constantly
06:31
at sea nuclear trident submarine
06:33
so if that's why isn't it so that
06:34
doesn't crash into it yes
06:38
is it there's one which is being sort of
06:40
repaired all the time there's one which
06:41
is being used for training all the time
06:42
and there's one which is constantly at
06:44
sea
06:44
and obviously that switches around it's
06:45
not like one of them is constantly being
06:47
repaired
06:48
exactly i think they're just gonna admit
06:49
that once that one's broken
06:53
um it's interesting looking at the
06:54
numbers of warships so in 1945
06:57
um i read this an article that we had
06:59
nine this is britain 900 warships
07:02
in the royal navy um by the time of the
07:04
falkland wars
07:05
it was down to 70 warships and they now
07:07
reckon in
07:09
2017 it's half of that so we're looking
07:11
at about 35 warships
07:13
and that i think includes a lot of
07:14
smaller craft as well like frigates in
07:16
the 55
07:17
so warship that can mean anything from
07:18
an aircraft carrier to a
07:20
speed boat maybe not quite
07:23
it's not quite that bad yet that we've
07:25
only got 35 speed boats
07:27
but it's bad the japanese navy is larger
07:28
than the british and french navy put
07:30
together
07:30
how many speed boats have they got oh
07:33
75.
07:34
wow but this is the thing the japanese
07:36
army i was reading about this
07:37
in the economist has never fired a shot
07:39
in anger
07:41
what have they fired it in
07:45
[Laughter]
07:46
what do you mean that doesn't i don't
07:48
know what you mean by that so the
07:49
japanese army was disbanded
07:50
in after the second world war so you
07:52
mean since the second world war is the
07:53
second world war yeah they fired a load
07:55
of shots
07:56
but since then they have never got
07:58
involved and there is a japanese man who
08:00
is now
08:01
suing the government because they're
08:02
training his son to kill people
08:04
oh really yeah the british navy at least
08:06
having big problems with recruitment and
08:08
they've basically just had to change all
08:09
the rules so that
08:11
uh it used to be that you couldn't be
08:13
recruited if you were over the age of 59
08:15
and now they're saying if you're over
08:16
the age of 59 that is no
08:17
problem please come and rejoin the navy
08:19
because they're
08:20
really needed god that does seem
08:22
relatively old to start
08:24
your naval training career i think it's
08:26
i think it's retired
08:27
it's retired yeah yeah they're saying
08:29
come back yeah so the current first sea
08:31
lord who's named admiral
08:32
sir philip jones um he's put this
08:34
calling out saying we need people to
08:36
come back um
08:37
it's code named and i don't know why we
08:38
know the code name but it's code named
08:40
from street to fleet
08:41
and they just don't have enough sailors
08:45
basically they need they need people
08:46
back on ships there's only 35 speed
08:48
boats we need to manage
08:49
exactly and this year has been named the
08:51
year of the navy and that was named
08:53
by uh michael fallon uh the defense
08:56
secretary he's
08:57
so it's meant to be pushing it i mean
08:59
he's the defense secretary they should
09:00
all be the year of the navy to him
09:04
but he needs to have a special year for
09:05
these things well last year was a year
09:06
of the emoji
09:08
this is defend britain year in which we
09:11
prevent people from invading
09:13
um does everyone know the name of the
09:14
captain on the us
09:16
navy's biggest stealth destroyer is it
09:19
captain
09:19
bird's eye no i
09:28
yes it is captain james kirk sure is
09:32
um but yeah captain james t kirk uh runs
09:34
this destroyer and
09:36
um the cool thing about this and this is
09:38
true of some of our warships
09:40
and related to the fact which i guess is
09:42
about how ships need to disguise
09:43
themselves
09:44
is that it looks to radar like a little
09:47
fishing boat
09:48
actually all of britain's ships look
09:50
like a little fishing boat as well
09:54
amazing disguise it's so realistic
09:57
they do it by the angles that it's built
09:58
out so if you look it up it looks like
10:00
more like a spaceship than a boat
10:01
because it's built um
10:02
a really weird shape yeah and the angles
10:04
again they deflect the radar in certain
10:06
ways which will make it appear
10:07
can you do the opposite whereas if i
10:09
have a tiny ship i can
10:10
be in the sub going check out my my ship
10:13
over there so here's how it works
10:14
imagine you're firing
10:16
um something at an airplane and it
10:18
bounces back at you
10:19
like a tennis ball you throw it at it
10:21
and it bounces back and you can tell
10:23
it's there because it bounces back okay
10:25
okay now
10:26
imagine these stealth airplanes which
10:28
are triangular
10:29
if you fire it up exactly at the nose
10:31
it'll bounce back at you but if you fire
10:33
it anywhere on the side it's going to
10:34
bounce to the side so you're not going
10:35
to see it's there
10:36
yeah and that's how the stealth works
10:38
and so one of these really triangular
10:40
aeroplanes they look
10:41
tiny because the only bit that comes
10:42
back from the radar is from the little
10:44
nose bit but what do they think that
10:45
they go oh it must be just
10:47
a a a bird side oh they think it's a
10:49
bird yeah
10:50
is that a bird no it's a plane
10:58
[Music]
10:59
okay it is time for fact number two and
11:01
that
11:02
is chizinski my fact is that the first
11:05
account of european smoking cannabis
11:07
reported that one hid in a jar for four
11:09
hours
11:10
and another got into a fight with a
11:12
pillar
11:14
um so this was i read this in a book
11:16
called penguins pineapples and pangolins
11:18
and it's first encounters with the
11:19
exotic as a subtitle and it's all about
11:21
the first times that
11:23
people from some parts of the world
11:24
encountered stuff from other parts of
11:26
the world
11:26
so this was a sailor called thomas
11:29
bowery
11:29
and 10 of his mates they were english
11:31
actually this is in the 1670s and they
11:33
were in bengal
11:34
and so in india at the time lots of weed
11:37
was smoked all over the shop it was
11:38
called bang
11:40
b-h-a-n-g and this guy reported thomas
11:43
barry reported that
11:44
it took its operation on most of us but
11:46
merrily save upon two of our number
11:48
one of them sat himself down upon the
11:50
floor and wept bitterly all afternoon
11:52
the other terrified with fear did run
11:54
his head into a great jar and continue
11:56
in this posture four hours or more
11:58
wow okay so did he have his head in a
12:00
jar then he had his head in the jar
12:02
right oh not his full body
12:04
i mean it's so hard to find a jar that
12:06
you can fit into these days
12:08
the plane of jars in lao the plane of
12:10
jazz
12:11
in la in lao lao all right
12:15
um yeah the country of lao they have a
12:17
big plane with loads of massive jazz and
12:19
no one's quite sure
12:20
what they're there for but they're
12:21
probably for burial yeah or could be for
12:23
big parties getting stoned and needing
12:24
somewhere to hide is what you're saying
12:27
this was actually specified as a
12:29
martyrbun jar which i think is a
12:31
big jar from somewhere in burma okay who
12:33
won the fight with the pillar
12:35
great question so yeah
12:39
definitely the pillar based on this so
12:41
he said one of our number was
12:42
quarrelsome and a fought with one of the
12:43
wooden pillars of the porch until he'd
12:45
left himself little skin upon the
12:46
knuckles of his fingers
12:48
[Music]
12:49
remained intact so i guess the pillar
12:51
one oh is that was the jar
12:53
made of glass or was it made of still
12:55
back on the jar what was just thinking
12:57
just thinking if it's made of glass it's
12:59
not the best hiding spot
13:01
they didn't have glass jars did they it
13:03
would have been a clay clay jar it's a
13:05
pot
13:05
i think we're saying pot here is that
13:07
why they call it pot
13:12
here's something about cannabis that i
13:13
did not know okay
13:15
is that um there is a conspiracy theory
13:18
oh i know oh that uh the only reason
13:22
that marijuana is illegal
13:23
is because have you heard this dan no
13:25
it's because
13:26
hemp paper was a rival to wood paper
13:30
oh yeah and so basically big paper
13:33
got together like a3 yeah yeah got
13:36
together
13:37
and um you know tried to shut down and
13:39
get it declared illegal
13:41
so great and so much deeper it's not
13:42
true can i just say your conspiracy
13:43
theories are way more boring than my
13:45
ones
13:45
yeah that's true there were no aliens in
13:47
that i thought it was going to be that
13:49
lizards are allergic to hemp
13:51
and the royal family are all lizards
13:55
kennedy was killed by a bullet of
13:57
marijuana or something no
13:58
sorry it's just that's the theory if you
14:01
type in you know
14:02
but that's actually plausible the good
14:04
thing about andy series is that there is
14:05
some genuine possible substance to it
14:07
exactly
14:08
here's the thing legal indoor growing of
14:11
marijuana uses one percent of all the
14:13
electricity in america
14:16
wow yeah
14:19
it produces the equivalent in carbon
14:21
dioxide of three million cars
14:23
industry it's huge wow yeah so
14:27
it's bad for the environment it's bad
14:28
for the environment the hippies are
14:30
going to hate that
14:30
yeah imagine hearing that oh man that
14:33
was the thing when people were
14:35
taking laughing gas in balloons i'm sure
14:38
they still do but it's very bad for the
14:39
environment because it's a really bad
14:41
greenhouse gas right yeah yeah so
14:44
it's hard to be an eco-friendly hippie
14:46
these days heroine's all right try
14:48
heroin
14:50
this week's episode of no such thing as
14:52
a fish is sponsored by heroin
14:56
yeah no one's got a good brand name out
14:58
of it yet that we can use because
14:59
it's just still heroin heroin was a
15:00
brown yeah what yeah heron was owned by
15:03
uh bayer the german pharmaceuticals oh
15:05
my god really
15:06
so are there other kinds of heroin that
15:09
we just we don't know the name of the
15:10
brand
15:11
yeah if that's what i mean people say
15:14
it's basically the same but i prefer the
15:16
stuff um
15:19
uh there was this thing i wanted to put
15:21
this forward
15:22
because it sounds to me like it's fake
15:24
but you guys might have read the story a
15:25
while ago
15:26
and known as that ridiculous theory
15:28
about hemp paper
15:31
well it's this new theory it is another
15:33
theory that uh shakespeare
15:34
was a pot smoker because they found
15:38
in a pipe which was in the gardens or in
15:40
the area of where he lived
15:42
they found a pipe that had traces of
15:43
cannabis in it and
15:45
the suggestion is that he might have
15:46
been a weed smoker they can't prove that
15:48
it was his but it definitely is from the
15:50
time it's a pipe from the time on the
15:51
grounds of where he lived so
15:52
it made it to england we're saying by
15:55
the early
15:56
1600s because he died in 1616. because
15:59
we we got it from india in the mid 1600s
16:02
really and hardly anyone was smoking it
16:03
i think we might have uncovered a small
16:05
hole in your theory yeah
16:06
again not my theory it does make sense
16:08
if you consider that shakespeare's plays
16:10
were all written
16:11
by samuel johnson who lived about 150
16:13
years later
16:16
it must be that it would grow in these
16:17
kind of climates
16:19
yeah um so and i think there were
16:22
germanic tribes who were using it so
16:24
theoretically it could have been around
16:26
possibly even though we
16:28
there's no evidence that we used it it's
16:29
very very unlikely but he may have been
16:31
the one person in this country
16:33
he was getting stunned but that explains
16:35
why he was
16:36
such a genius out of his time right he's
16:38
so true yeah
16:39
can we go back to the jazz
16:42
thank you james uh in 1749 there were
16:46
adverts all over london
16:48
that um you could go and watch a man
16:50
getting into a jar
16:52
um getting into a quart bottle actually
16:54
so a quart bottle's pretty small
16:56
tiny yeah it's really small well
16:58
compared to a man surely it depends on
17:00
how big the
17:00
neck is well
17:04
it depends if his neck will fit in the
17:06
neck
17:06
[Laughter]
17:08
um no this was um a bet between the duke
17:10
of portland and the earl of chesterfield
17:13
and that they were discussing the
17:14
gullibility of the british public and
17:16
one of them bet the other that if i put
17:18
signs up saying
17:19
a man can climb into a four quart bottle
17:21
then i bet people will go and see it
17:23
and the other guy goes now people aren't
17:24
that stupid anyway people were that
17:26
stupid
17:27
and they turned up and they waited for
17:29
about half an hour until it became
17:30
obvious that this guy and his bottle
17:32
were not going to turn up
17:34
and then they trashed the place um
17:36
general chaos
17:37
broke out they ripped up the theater
17:40
through seats and benches everywhere
17:43
three pillars had to be hospitalized
17:48
um i think everything carriable was
17:50
hauled outside and thrown into a bonfire
17:53
people abandoned their hats and wigs in
17:55
the panic wow
17:57
abandoned wings
18:01
and then people tried to guess who it
18:03
was um
18:04
and no one knew and it was only about
18:06
four or five years later that the
18:08
earl of chesterfield and the duke of
18:09
portland fest
18:11
i would absolutely go along to the show
18:12
i'm with the public on this one someone
18:14
said
18:14
this theater on this day has been booked
18:17
i would think that's legit
18:18
well up in covent garden where they have
18:20
all the street performers i saw a man my
18:22
size get into a briefcase
18:24
[Music]
18:26
how big was the briefcase today it was
18:28
just like it was it was a slightly
18:29
bigger briefcase but it wasn't quite a
18:30
suitcase so
18:31
he just opened it up and he did this
18:33
whole thing i'm gonna fit myself in this
18:35
in this briefcase and he did he just
18:36
disappeared
18:38
and then he picked it up from the inside
18:44
[Laughter]
18:46
wouldn't that be great when you get to a
18:48
meeting and you put your briefcase on
18:49
the table
18:51
have you met my chief strategist
18:55
so i have one last thing about cannabis
18:56
yeah which is that in 2008
18:58
there was a japanese customs officer who
19:00
was uh training his sniffer dog
19:02
and he planted a pack of cannabis resin
19:05
in uh
19:06
he was meant to plant it in a dummy bag
19:08
okay a previously agreed dummy bag
19:11
he decided to give his dog a bit of an
19:12
extra challenge and planted the cannabis
19:14
resin
19:15
in a random member of the public's bag
19:18
right
19:19
unfortunately the dog did not find the
19:21
drugs
19:23
so that's probably because there was a
19:25
guy inside that bag who just immediately
19:27
smoked
19:30
[Applause]
19:33
okay it's time for fact number three and
19:36
that is
19:37
andy my fact is that glow worms go
19:39
fishing with their own urine
19:42
we've mentioned these guys before
19:43
actually they live in caves and they
19:45
live
19:45
on the ceilings of caves really wet
19:47
caves and they drop
19:49
lines down and they dangle them out of
19:52
their own bodies and they dangle them
19:53
out of their own mouths
19:54
so scientists have been analyzing the
19:56
content and it turns out they're mostly
19:57
water
19:58
but the thing that makes them so sticky
20:00
is urea which is one of the ingredients
20:02
in urine
20:02
so we think they're taking like the
20:04
early gut
20:06
urine as it's forming and stringing that
20:08
out of their mouth to make these
20:10
adhesive lines
20:10
that is disgusting and these
20:14
lines then things get trapped in them
20:16
right exactly things get trapped in and
20:17
they hold them up
20:18
but they hold them back up yeah they go
20:21
oh my god and then they recycle and
20:23
digest it and then use the same line
20:25
again or the same
20:26
so all their meals taste of piss so i
20:28
didn't agree
20:30
yeah wow all the uh tripadvisor reviews
20:33
one star tasted a piss
20:37
no that would just one thing they do
20:38
they they build a mucus tube on the
20:40
ceiling of the cave
20:41
and they shuttle backwards and forwards
20:43
along it with dozens of lines
20:45
dangling down so they can keep loads of
20:47
fishing lines on the go at the same time
20:50
wow and then whenever an insect gets
20:51
stuck they haul it up
20:53
very cool they look really pretty don't
20:55
they yeah they look lovely
20:56
um for a thing which is vomiting its own
20:59
piss and then eating it
21:01
it looks like a christmas decoration in
21:03
that cave i am not coming to your house
21:05
for christmas
21:08
[Laughter]
21:11
so they're not glow worms like the glow
21:13
homes we have in britain which are a
21:15
type of beetle
21:16
and they're a type of gnat which people
21:19
only found out
21:19
relatively recently in maori the name is
21:23
titty y which means projected over water
21:28
when they're doing this thing with their
21:30
fishing um their larvae
21:32
and they're like that for quite a few
21:33
years uh
21:35
and then they become an adult and
21:37
they're only an adult for like a day or
21:39
so and then they mate
21:40
and then they lay the eggs and then they
21:41
live for a larvae for ages and ages and
21:43
ages
21:44
and if you get too many of these nuts in
21:47
a cave
21:48
then they'll start catching each other
21:49
and they start eating each other and
21:51
they get
21:52
cannibalistic right okay so just a few
21:55
more things about
21:56
the titty yeah so quite a lot of animals
21:59
seem to use
22:00
projectiles as fishing rods and i think
22:03
i've seen a claim that one of them is
22:05
the fastest animal
22:07
in the world in this sense is it a
22:09
cheetah
22:10
yeah it's a swift a swift is the fastest
22:14
is it a buffalo falling off a cliff
22:17
is it a human in a spaceship
22:21
all of these are strong contenders it
22:23
really depends on your definition of
22:24
fast so it's a frog fish
22:26
and well i reckon a human in a
22:28
spaceship's faster than that well it
22:29
depends which bit of the
22:31
body you're measuring when you're
22:32
talking about speed so this is
22:33
specifically its tongue so a frog fish
22:35
if you can picture it it's they look
22:37
so weird they look like a weird gnarly
22:39
bit of rock with a kind of wobbly face
22:41
on them
22:44
that happens to be my wife thank you
22:45
very much
22:48
and they have one of their uh their
22:50
dorsal fins is like super modified into
22:53
this rod so it looks like this really
22:54
long
22:55
thin rod that sticks out of them and it
22:56
has a lure at the end so it looks like a
22:58
bit of a mica at the end of it
23:00
and when it sees a fish coming by or a
23:01
crustacean or something then it wobbles
23:03
the lure around
23:04
so the the fish thinks it's a bit of
23:06
prey and then the fish will
23:08
come and it'll try to eat it and the
23:09
speed at which it sucks in the prey
23:11
that's landed on its lure
23:13
is uh it manages to get it into its
23:15
mouth within 0.006 seconds
23:18
so another weird thing about them is
23:19
that's so fast that no other animals can
23:22
see it happen so if you're swimming next
23:23
to your fish
23:24
we know that it's happened then because
23:26
the fish are swimming along and then
23:28
your mate just disappears
23:29
yes that's presumably what happens yeah
23:31
but where is it
23:33
there's probably conspiracy theories in
23:34
the fish world about what happens to
23:36
people like jeff
23:38
uh that is incredible so what humans
23:39
have done is we that fish haven't done
23:41
is developed high-speed cameras
23:42
the fish police probably look at that
23:44
and see people speeding and they're like
23:45
oh man i wish we had that
23:48
that's awesome with one of those yeah
23:50
catch whatever
23:51
wobbly face critter is swallowing our
23:53
names
23:55
and what so we can see it through so
23:57
we've seen it with uh with our
23:58
high-speed cameras and they eject their
24:00
tongue out and then they suck these
24:01
things in
24:01
yeah that's amazing that'd be such a
24:03
skill if you're at a restaurant with
24:04
someone and they had something on the
24:06
plate that you wanted
24:09
what happened to my food i tried to be
24:12
the manager good meal good meal all
24:13
right nice to see you thank you
24:15
oh yeah nice to see you what that is
24:18
incredible that is super fast
24:20
right and also they can suck stuff in
24:21
that's bigger than their own bodies
24:24
okay i think that it's a bit obvious
24:26
when you're the shape of jeff
24:29
where'd jeff go
24:34
the way one of them does it is by
24:36
opening their mouth to 12 times its
24:38
original size
24:39
so it expands its mouth to 12 times as
24:42
wide as it was
24:43
and then that creates this suction in
24:44
the water that pulls the prey in
24:46
oh they then still themselves or are
24:48
they then another animal completely
24:50
because they've got a massive fission i
24:51
think the thing is the thing that's
24:52
still alive because they say that humans
24:55
have got like 50 bacterial cells so
24:57
we're almost more bacterial than human
25:00
now if you've eaten a fish which is
25:01
bigger than you then
25:03
are you actually more fish than human
25:05
well this is what they discuss a lot in
25:06
fish philosophy school
25:10
when the police give them a break
25:11
[Laughter]
25:13
there are salamanders which secrete glue
25:15
through their skins
25:16
and then when snakes can't get anywhere
25:19
[Laughter]
25:22
it's called the extinct
25:24
[Laughter]
25:27
no it's it's called uh well there's one
25:28
called betra kosep's attenuatus and
25:31
it secretes from its skin a glue which
25:33
sticks a snake to itself
25:35
and glues the snake's jaws shut but
25:36
doesn't stick to the salamander
25:38
what so the snake is all glued up next
25:40
to itself on its own coils and its mouth
25:42
is all glued shut and that's terrible
25:45
only for the salamander no fantastic for
25:47
the salamander yeah obviously
25:49
um urine yeah monkeys washed themselves
25:52
with it they've just found out in a new
25:54
study
25:54
do they yep uh to attract mates so
25:58
it's male and female monkeys uh we think
26:00
of several species they wee into their
26:01
hands and then they rub it all over
26:03
themselves like it's shower gel
26:04
what is it with animals they're just
26:07
animals just
26:08
love pests don't they yeah they do they
26:10
really do loads of them
26:11
like literally every single time you
26:14
google
26:14
animal urine it's always they do this to
26:17
attract mates or yeah but maybe we've
26:19
got the wrong attitude
26:20
maybe i mean how many of you given a
26:22
chance to your own urine on your body
26:24
no well no i haven't i haven't or not on
26:27
purpose certainly
26:28
i can think i can think of a world
26:29
leader or two who might have done
26:34
no because obviously throughout history
26:35
urine has been used as mouthwash i think
26:37
we've mentioned in the
26:38
in the past we've uh used it for all
26:41
sorts of medication
26:42
um in battle henry viii i think his his
26:46
soldiers always wash their wounds in
26:48
urine so you're saying really
26:50
that we're unusual not only in
26:53
animal world but also in time this is a
26:56
very very unusual part of history when
26:58
people aren't dousing themselves in
26:59
urine yeah that's true actually isn't it
27:01
it's a really good point robert boyle um
27:04
who's often
27:05
said to be the father of chemistry urine
27:06
was very much a part of his
27:08
um his uh ideas of medication so he used
27:11
to say that
27:12
um every morning you should drink a
27:13
moderate draft of your own urine
27:16
um and while it's still warm warm urine
27:19
very important not to let it cool down
27:21
that'd be disgusting
27:22
well it's the difference if you don't
27:23
like red wine have a go at mold wine
27:26
because it's it's very nice even if you
27:29
don't like red wine and i imagine that's
27:30
what hot urine's like
27:31
so are you saying you should put some
27:33
cloves into your urine
27:34
before you drink it i'm just saying
27:36
heating up urine might take that sort of
27:38
edge off what was stopping you from
27:40
drinking the cold version well i'm not
27:41
coming to your place for christmas
27:44
and be just me and you yeah just like
27:46
every year
27:49
so there is a fantastic article by a guy
27:50
called richard sugg
27:52
on the guardian which just lists some of
27:54
the medieval uses of you
27:55
yeah it's so good i did read that one as
27:57
well okay i haven't read this so let's
27:58
see all right well here we go in 1550
28:01
the italian doctor
28:02
leonardo fioravanti saw a man's nose
28:05
sliced off in an argument and promptly
28:07
urinated on the fallen organ before
28:09
stitching it back on
28:10
wow i know like that was to keep her
28:13
germs at bay and
28:14
i guess so yeah yeah they used to say
28:16
women should uh gargle urine or drink
28:18
warm urine to
28:20
deal with the sore throat which might
28:21
well work i suppose warm liquids are
28:23
quite soothing
28:24
yes but don't do it with cold urine
28:26
never do anything with cold urine i
28:28
think that's what we've established
28:29
today
28:31
um he richard tugg in this article he
28:33
also mentions um
28:34
that there was a pioneering french
28:36
surgeon ambrose
28:37
pare um itching eyelids if you had
28:40
itching eyelids
28:41
wash your eyelids in your urine and make
28:44
sure that the urine
28:45
that has been provided has uh been kept
28:47
all night in a barber's basin
28:49
so there's something i guess about just
28:52
it
28:53
getting some air and uh but why a
28:55
barber's basin why not just any old
28:57
like jar or well because someone might
28:59
put their head in that jar
29:01
and drown if they've got plans to keep
29:02
it in there no one has ever put their
29:04
head in the barber's base
29:07
the only basin people routinely plunge
29:09
their hands into
29:15
obama's basin has that um gateway in it
29:17
where the urine would spill out we know
29:19
where you lie your neck down oh yeah
29:21
so actually wouldn't be able to hold
29:22
nearly as much urine as a conventional
29:23
base
29:24
which bit you know when you go to a
29:25
barber and you lie your head back oh
29:26
that's a modern
29:27
that's a modern barber's base and james
29:29
and i have spoken about this before
29:30
people used to face downwards over
29:32
over a basin which was just like a mini
29:34
bath or a kitchen sink because it's
29:36
easier to get your eyelids
29:38
into the
29:41
um just want to say that i am so
29:43
skeptical because james you have made a
29:45
good point that urine was everywhere
29:46
throughout time and all animals
29:48
if you read literature from any period
29:50
fiction
29:51
it's never mentioned that people were
29:53
washing in you and that people were
29:54
drinking you and i've never seen it in
29:55
dickens
29:56
it never comes up in shape yeah but but
29:58
you're not gonna have a like
29:59
shakespeare's not gonna write a sonnet
30:00
about
30:01
like bathing your richie eyes and urine
30:03
is he like
30:04
all that glitters is not gold he did
30:06
write that though so
30:08
you're right maybe that was about me
30:09
there are fish
30:11
um in fact a lot of fish they'll go
30:13
around and they'll urinate at each other
30:16
and the way that they found out that
30:17
it's to send signals
30:19
is they got two fish and they put them
30:21
in some water and they put a divider
30:23
between them
30:23
so they could see each other yeah but
30:25
the water was separate
30:26
and then they put um a dye inside the
30:30
fish which made the urine turn purple
30:32
you know like that thing that doesn't
30:34
exist in swimming say
30:35
yeah that they scare you with yeah they
30:37
put the fish in the
30:39
in the tank and they would urinate at
30:41
each other um
30:42
but then they couldn't detect it because
30:45
this wall
30:46
and so what happened was they would
30:47
think there was something wrong and they
30:49
just peed more and more and more and
30:50
they ended up with tons of pee because
30:52
they're trying to get the point across
30:53
to the other guy
30:54
they're not hearing anything back from
30:55
him so they just pee even more
30:57
and that's to prove that it's like a
30:59
signaling thing yeah
31:00
okay oh wow but we don't know what the
31:02
point is that they're trying to get
31:03
across
31:04
it's just a point they're trying to make
31:05
a point it's true we ca we can't speak
31:08
fish urine
31:11
it'd be great for the sentence was i
31:13
think there's something wrong with my
31:14
weed
31:17
does it look weird to you i don't think
31:19
it's meant to be that color
31:21
i thought this was a myth about
31:25
[Applause]
31:28
[Music]
31:29
okay it is time for our final fact of
31:32
the show
31:32
and that is my fact my fact this week is
31:35
that according to the endangered
31:36
language alliance
31:37
more languages are spoken in queens new
31:39
york than anywhere else in the world
31:41
wow the most incredible dense area on
31:44
our planet of spoken languages is
31:46
queens new york and they put it as
31:47
around as many as 800 languages
31:49
that are spoken and a lot of the
31:51
languages are languages that
31:53
are no longer even spoken in the place
31:55
where they originated from they're now
31:56
just purely
31:57
in new york which is insane it's they've
32:00
gone there to die
32:01
basically because normally you know
32:04
people go to florida
32:04
[Laughter]
32:06
there are a couple that are only spoken
32:08
by like one person there aren't there
32:09
yeah exactly
32:10
did you read about the guy mr hussein i
32:13
think who's 67
32:14
and he speaks mamuju which is an
32:16
austronesian language so he grew up in
32:18
indonesia
32:19
um and he doesn't have anyone else to
32:22
speak to because not even his wife or
32:23
children speak it
32:24
the only time he gets to speak is on the
32:25
phone to his brother back home so he's
32:27
the only
32:28
mamuju speaker in new york yeah it's
32:30
very sad
32:31
some people think that it's good that
32:33
languages die out
32:34
do they yeah contrarians
32:39
i can see an argument we get very
32:41
precious about them well the argument is
32:43
and this isn't my argument but it is an
32:44
argument that is
32:46
um the a lot of these languages are
32:48
spoken by isolated people
32:49
and it's the language is part of their
32:52
isolation
32:52
and maybe it's better for people to be
32:54
less isolated rather than more isolated
32:57
i see and the other argument which is
32:59
much more pervasive
33:01
is that um it's complete cultures and
33:04
and knowledge which you lose as soon as
33:05
you lose a language
33:07
yeah although we can write them all down
33:08
now we can record them all you can put
33:10
them on the internet that is not a
33:12
language
33:12
living though yeah it's not a way of
33:14
life living you know
33:16
no it's not yeah don't go to cornwall
33:18
anytime soon
33:20
in 2001 there were and 689
33:23
known languages uh how did you think
33:25
there are now
33:26
they're dying out two a month okay six
33:29
thousand two hundred i'd say six
33:30
thousand nine hundred i reckon we're
33:32
discovering more languages yeah that's
33:34
right there's more than seven thousand
33:35
no way we're finding them quicker than
33:37
they're dying out at the moment
33:39
but that can't keep going forever no
33:41
well
33:43
at some point we will hit the buffers
33:45
unless there is an infinite number of
33:46
languages
33:47
okay so you you were right andy thank
33:50
you that's all that's all i need um
33:52
or unless we start creating new ones
33:54
because there's a new there's for
33:55
instance a new language
33:56
in australia which is called light wall
33:59
peri
34:00
so it's it was related to war period but
34:02
it's just been identified as a new
34:03
language it's in this really isolated
34:04
village of 700 people in the northern
34:06
territory
34:07
is it light as in like marlborough light
34:09
or i think it is sort of like that
34:11
slightly less
34:12
20 fewer consonants or something exactly
34:14
but yeah 350 people speak it as their
34:17
native tongue
34:18
and this is just a completely new
34:19
language based on other languages but
34:21
now classified as new
34:22
wow so we've just got to keep replacing
34:24
them as fast as we lose them i
34:25
really like this this is just this is a
34:27
fact from the endangered language
34:28
alliance
34:29
who record and identify languages which
34:31
are dying out um there's a
34:32
language from gabon called mahongwei and
34:35
it has a word
34:36
uh manono which means i like when you
34:38
say it softly
34:40
and i don't like when the first syllable
34:42
is slightly sharper
34:43
in tone that's like saying fine
34:46
fine oh yeah yeah the entire language is
34:49
based on sarcasm basically
34:51
i think it's brilliant this group that
34:54
you've just mentioned
34:55
uh the endangered language alliance they
34:58
say that when you get the um the subway
35:00
in america
35:00
if you were going from queens to
35:02
manhattan every stop along the way
35:05
you'll notice when they're saying things
35:06
like the equivalent of mind the gap
35:08
um they'll have english but they'll have
35:10
like six translations underneath it and
35:12
then maybe five and then maybe two as
35:13
you get closer into
35:15
manhattan so the amount of density of
35:18
language speakers there is enough that
35:19
they're altering
35:20
uh enough for multiple translations they
35:22
really should have mine the gap in 800
35:24
different languages shouldn't they
35:25
yes yeah otherwise it's going to be
35:27
accidents yeah well this is why we're
35:29
losing this is why we're losing another
35:30
language has gone extinct
35:32
because fell through the gap
35:36
i read about a juggernaut in the world
35:39
of linguistics uh and his passing
35:41
uh he passed in early january very sad
35:44
14th of january this year and it was a
35:46
man called
35:46
zhao yo guang his birth name was zhao
35:49
yao ping
35:50
not heard of him he is the father of
35:53
pinyin
35:54
which is what's taken china into a whole
35:57
new world
35:58
of written language because it took the
36:00
chinese language and he applied
36:01
romanization to it and so
36:03
we can now use our alphabet to write
36:06
chinese words
36:07
and he only passed away this january he
36:09
was 111 years old wow
36:12
yeah he lived in new york for a while
36:14
i'm trying to track down if it was
36:16
queens i'm not sure
36:17
but it might have been queens he met
36:18
albert einstein there um
36:20
and he he became a sort of outspoken
36:23
character later in his life
36:24
he wrote 10 books after turning 100 um
36:27
and most
36:28
most of which were banned because uh he
36:31
was saying really controversial things
36:32
about the chinese government
36:33
um and when they asked him why you're
36:35
doing this he was like they sent her
36:37
books
36:37
yes
36:41
yeah and he was like i'm over 100 what
36:42
have i got to lose i'm going to say what
36:44
i'm going to say
36:44
um wow but yeah he absolutely
36:46
transformed the chinese language
36:48
um when he did that it was under online
36:51
who was underneath chairman mao
36:53
um he was a he was his number two or
36:55
whatever
36:56
mao hated it mao hated the idea that
36:58
they were bringing westernization into
36:59
china so they banished him away and he
37:01
basically spent a lot of the cultural
37:03
revolution
37:03
working as a as a scarecrow his job was
37:06
literally to scare crows away in the
37:08
fields um from all the fields no way yes
37:10
it's a real
37:11
curious he was obsessed with curiosity
37:13
obsessed with knowledge
37:14
real qi kind of guy yeah yeah and he
37:17
only passed away this year at 111 in one
37:19
day
37:20
i like the sentinelese language
37:23
i think we've talked about the
37:24
sentinelese people before
37:26
who are a totally isolated group of
37:30
people who live
37:31
in uh the andaman nicobar islands in
37:33
india
37:34
and because they're isolated and they're
37:35
so aggressive so they really hate
37:36
outsiders so whenever we've tried to
37:38
penetrate their culture then they attack
37:41
us oh so they know what we're like
37:42
they know what we're like yeah yeah i
37:44
don't know how they've got this
37:44
information
37:45
all we're trying to do is penetrate
37:47
their culture
37:49
very unnecessarily violent word i used
37:50
wasn't it yeah so we have no
37:52
idea what their language is like if you
37:54
look up the language we only know the
37:55
word for
37:56
art which is one word in there
38:00
[Laughter]
38:02
unless you say it softly please come in
38:05
they were actually saying and we just
38:07
liked it so one of the things that could
38:09
be related to is the andamanese kind of
38:11
language which is spoken very nearby and
38:14
that has all of its nouns that are based
38:16
on body parts
38:17
so every noun is related to like what
38:20
body part it resembles or what body part
38:22
you touch it with
38:24
do you have examples it has a so i think
38:26
let's say you're talking about a floor
38:27
then it would have a prefix
38:29
which means like foot something or maybe
38:32
food would always be mouth something
38:34
right then i think that makes a lot of
38:36
sense
38:37
no oh look what you started i do though
38:40
don't you think most things around us
38:43
are we use with bits of our body
38:45
i mean my wife we were talking the other
38:46
night and we we realized we didn't know
38:47
what you know with the bathrooms when
38:49
you have the b day thing
38:50
is it called bitter you mean the asp the
38:52
b day so is it
38:53
is it an art bowl is that what it is
38:55
well it's an everything bowl isn't it i
38:57
just didn't know it was for men i
38:58
thought it was for women
38:59
it's a region bowl i mean you're allowed
39:00
to put whatever you want in it but it is
39:02
mostly for bums
39:03
okay have you got one of these things
39:05
you didn't know what it was no no no we
39:07
saw a picture of while online and we
39:08
thought
39:10
we started chatting about it evenings
39:16
i was trying to think of things that
39:17
like for instance a brick what would you
39:19
call that what body part would that go
39:21
without intense okay and handbrake what
39:23
about
39:24
it's called a brick
39:25
[Laughter]
39:39
[Laughter]
39:41
what about a worm
39:45
why why foot because you don't want to
39:46
tread on is it on the ground yeah yeah
39:48
oh it's got to be things they resemble
39:49
as well small intestine
39:50
um oh um willy worm yeah what's that
39:53
because it's also
39:54
things that they resemble bodily bodily
39:56
things they resemble
39:57
no i think it needs a practical use
39:58
because if you're mixing up the language
40:00
there mine's got to practice
40:02
if i have a bum b day and i heard willie
40:05
webb i'd assume that that's
40:06
what i need to connect it with don't be
40:08
really well with
40:10
this is just how the language works dan
40:12
it's not your language
40:14
it's someone else's i'm saying it needs
40:16
to be related to the bit you want it to
40:17
touch
40:18
so if i see a willy worm but the thing
40:19
is your rules are not important to this
40:22
language
40:24
[Laughter]
40:33
this is why we didn't want people
40:35
penetrating our culture
40:38
[Music]
40:43
okay that's it that is all of our facts
40:45
thank you so much for listening if you'd
40:47
like to get in contact with any of us
40:48

[Applause]
00:14
oh
00:20
[Applause]
00:28
hello
00:30
and welcome to another episode of no
00:33
such thing as a dish a weekly podcast
00:35
this week coming to you live
00:37
from up the creek in greenwich london my
00:39
name is dan schreiber and i am sitting
00:41
here with anna chazinski andrew hunter
00:43
murray and james harkin
00:44
and once again we have gathered round
00:45
the table with our four favorite facts
00:47
from the last seven days
00:48
and in no particular order here we go
00:51
starting with
00:51
my fact my fact this week is that
00:54
scientists can now predict when someone
00:58
is going to fall over
01:02
three weeks before it happens
01:09
these are scientists who have been
01:10
studying miranda
01:13
[Music]
01:14
this is this shockingly is true um
01:18
so what they do is they notice obviously
01:19
it's a problem that a lot of
01:21
elderly people fall over and that leads
01:22
to a lot of problems so they've been
01:24
studying it and what they've realized
01:26
is that you can actually spot the moment
01:27
when a fall is going to happen
01:29
due to the speed that someone travels at
01:32
so what they've done is they put cameras
01:34
into this
01:34
into a house and they've monitored
01:36
someone walking and they've noticed a
01:37
speed change that happens
01:39
and when the speed change happens it
01:40
means because something is deteriorated
01:42
inside the body
01:43
so it means that they walk a lot slower
01:45
therefore they predict and they've shown
01:47
from these studies that in the
01:48
subsequent three weeks a fall is going
01:50
to happen
01:51
so robots are now monitoring old people
01:53
to see if they're changing speed
01:55
and they're like they're down by like
01:56
point five miles an hour
01:58
said the text and you can stop them from
02:00
falling over well and then as the
02:01
granddaughter or whatever you have to
02:03
go to the house immediately and stand
02:04
there in front of them with your arms
02:17
and that's kind of what happens right is
02:19
that amazing
02:25
so the other thing it can measure
02:26
actually i'm not sure how they do this
02:27
with
02:28
the sensors that they install but if
02:30
your stride length changes by just
02:32
about seven centimeters that can be
02:35
detected and that also is a strong
02:37
indicator that you're going to have a
02:38
full within the coming few weeks yeah
02:40
and and to illustrate how effective it
02:42
is
02:43
because it is unbelievable um if your
02:46
walking speed decreases by 5.1
02:48
centimeters a second
02:50
you have an eight as a pensioner you
02:51
have an 86
02:53
chance of falling over within three
02:54
weeks compared to a 20 chance
02:56
if your speed hasn't decreased that much
02:58
which is an unbelievable difference
03:00
is this just huge change that suddenly
03:01
happens and i think the idea is that you
03:04
get these robots in people's houses and
03:05
it means that they can
03:06
kind of hang out a lot more without
03:08
people looking after them right yeah
03:09
are they they're not actual robots are
03:11
they like i mean what is a robot
03:13
well like hello how are you that's an
03:16
android an android is human shaped
03:19
whereas a robot is just anything that's
03:20
robotic
03:24
if i bought like i was like my best
03:26
friend is a robot and he arrived and it
03:28
was like a camera
03:32
do you know what robots they use for
03:33
older people actually no
03:35
well one robot they use is paro who's a
03:38
seal
03:39
and so para was built in japan
03:42
and it's a little seal which is robotic
03:44
and it responds to like being hugged
03:46
and being spoken to and the creator of
03:49
this little robot seal
03:51
is called takanori shibata and he chose
03:53
it because
03:54
he said people are unlikely to have
03:56
unhelpful memories of real seals
04:00
so it's not going to freak anyone out
04:02
because very few people have been
04:02
assaulted by a seal but just
04:04
just one person who's you know lost a
04:06
hand to a seal
04:09
so there is a there's buster's just a
04:11
quick say it doesn't matter
04:15
um the british researchers are currently
04:17
teaming up with
04:18
uh japanese i've written japanese robots
04:20
they're teaming up with japanese
04:21
researchers
04:23
to use monitoring robots um and they're
04:26
trying to install
04:27
uh cultural differences and one of the
04:28
reasons that they're doing it in the uk
04:29
is you have a lot of people from a lot
04:31
of different cultures living here
04:32
one of the researchers said the
04:33
following uh i think she was greek
04:35
herself she said a robot might be taught
04:37
not to try and cheer up a greek woman
04:39
whose husband died months ago
04:41
because greek widows are expected to be
04:42
sad for at least a year
04:44
wow so instead of installing the
04:46
cultural sensitivity
04:48
that's very good whereas i suppose in
04:50
other cultures the robot will just say
04:52
come on you know
04:56
but it instructs them to stay depressed
04:58
if they're greek
05:03
can't help but notice you smiled a
05:05
second ago
05:07
you know you've lost your husband
05:12
inappropriate and just just on falling
05:16
over
05:17
this is an experiment that you might not
05:18
have seen it's fantastic it's an
05:20
experiment on
05:21
penguins which put penguins on
05:23
treadmills
05:26
and it's fantastic
05:30
so penguins have to they have to strike
05:32
a balance right because they can't they
05:34
have to go a long time without food
05:35
because they're feeding their young and
05:36
they're foraging for their young and
05:38
they have to you know so they lose a lot
05:39
of weight
05:40
during the period where they're hunting
05:41
so they they need to put on as much
05:43
weight as possible
05:45
but if they put on too much weight they
05:47
become completely inagile and predators
05:49
will catch and eat them
05:50
and so that's not good for the young
05:51
either obviously so the scientists
05:53
from the university of london wanted to
05:55
test you know
05:57
uh the sort of relationship between
05:59
weight and and walking speed
06:00
and this team just put them on
06:02
treadmills and didn't feed them for
06:04
hours and thousand days in fact
06:06
they're used to it they're fine um we
06:09
didn't feed them for two weeks and put
06:10
them on a treadmill
06:12
um and some of the penguins started
06:13
cheating right so there's a treadmill
06:15
and then there's a little hood over the
06:16
treadmill okay
06:17
so that they're in the same place all
06:19
the way along and some of the penguins
06:21
just leaned against the back wall
06:23
of this canopy and sort of water skied
06:26
along the trap
06:34
[Music]
06:36
that's the thing about penguins is is it
06:38
not there's a i think it's a myth but
06:40
in the falcon islands supposedly planes
06:42
go over them fly over them and they just
06:44
look and look and look and look and then
06:46
fall over
06:46
no they they they debunked it just very
06:49
recently
06:49
they did a study where i think people
06:51
went out to film them and they sent
06:52
planes over
06:53
and and they looked up and they were
06:55
like i was playing and then they were
06:58
they were all good yeah no they don't
07:00
actually they don't actually fall over
07:01
but the discovery the penguins can talk
07:03
really trumps
07:04
beyond discovery yeah yeah there's a lot
07:07
of quotes going
07:08
well is that emirates
07:09
[Laughter]
07:12
um so another another thing that uh is
07:14
done in old people's homes
07:16
another thing that's done in nursing
07:18
homes is installing therapy animals
07:20
sometimes
07:21
um so to make people feel better and
07:23
there's one particular therapy cat
07:25
called oscar
07:26
who's been adopted in a nursing home in
07:29
rhode island
07:30
and it's quite confusing the reasons why
07:31
he was adopted because apparently he's
07:33
generally unsociable
07:35
but his one skill is bizarrely he can
07:38
tell when someone's about to die so the
07:40
only time
07:41
he goes near someone is when they are
07:43
about to die
07:45
he's the most terrifying cat
07:50
and if he's so he'll just suddenly run
07:52
to somebody's room and sit on their bed
07:54
and then if he's removed then he'll
07:56
scratch on the door scratch on the door
07:57
until he's let back in again
08:01
is he is he killing is he killing the
08:03
people
08:03
[Laughter]
08:07
all the mysterious cats
08:16
[Music]
08:18
he's detected over 50 uh deaths
08:22
and it's within hours so i mean it's
08:24
very strong this is a book been written
08:25
by a doctor who works this nursing home
08:27
and they think maybe he's detecting
08:28
ketones which are the chemicals that you
08:30
release
08:31
uh chemicals that dying cells release so
08:34
there is a very subtle change in the
08:35
chemicals he is in an old people's home
08:38
though isn't he like a lot of these
08:39
people are gonna die at certain times
08:41
i'd like to see him put in a football
08:43
stadium
08:45
oh yeah so have they what's happened to
08:47
the cat is he still there
08:48
he's still there because he's under your
08:52
seat
08:56
but that can't be that can't be good for
08:58
the
08:59
morale yeah
09:05
phew wow where where is the home sorry
09:08
uh it's in pittsburgh and you're
09:11
scheduled to go next week
09:14
do you know why we don't fall over in
09:17
terms of
09:17
our body and the balance do you know why
09:19
we don't fall over yeah just
09:20
what are your feet get in the way no so
09:24
yes
09:24
it is our legs thank you very much but
09:27
there's a there's a thing and i've not
09:30
actually
09:30
i read it earlier i didn't write it down
09:32
so i'm freestyling here
09:36
there's a thing in our ear which
09:37
everyone thought was a balance making
09:39
thing
09:40
thank you uh the otolith which was uh
09:43
meant to be a thing that just gave us
09:45
balance i guess kind of like when you're
09:47
measuring a
09:48
a door and you have that little thing in
09:50
the mirror
09:54
so
09:58
so you have a spirit level thing
10:01
and and everyone thought that that's
10:04
what was keeping you up
10:05
but it turns out they did an experiment
10:07
and they they worked out how to shut
10:09
that off
10:10
so that it wasn't in the humans that
10:12
they were testing that wasn't playing a
10:14
factor into it they managed somebody to
10:15
just turn off the switch i think there's
10:16
a switch
10:19
and um what i noticed was the cards of a
10:22
human
10:22
is what actually provides the balance
10:24
it's not the fee it's not the
10:25
that bit between the foot and the car it
10:28
was can i
10:29
i really want to make this right now
10:31
okay because you can't see this but dan
10:33
is saying carves but he's clutching his
10:36
thigh
10:40
where the [ __ ] the car that's your
10:44
curve
10:48
[Music]
10:52
[Applause]
10:55
[Music]
10:56
[Applause]
10:58
where did you think your thigh was
11:01
i thought it was the front bit um don't
11:05
fortunate if you i i also read about
11:07
this experiment and i did write it down
11:10
because we do a factual podcast
11:17
and he's right
11:26
we do need to move on to our next pack
11:28
should we do that can i tell you very
11:29
quickly one one more thing about walking
11:30
running that
11:31
elephants can't run oh yeah uh
11:34
yeah uh so they will they can run with
11:37
their front half
11:39
this is kind of amazing they run with
11:42
their front legs but not with their back
11:44
legs
11:44
so what happens when we run is our
11:46
center of gravity starts bumping up and
11:48
down
11:48
and that wastes energy so what elephants
11:50
do is they start trotting along with
11:52
their front legs to speed up their
11:54
movement
11:54
but they keep on walking with their
11:57
batteries
11:59
[Laughter]
12:02
like a slinky were you horsing the
12:04
sausage elephant
12:10
it's true that their center of gravity
12:12
stays at constant height from the ground
12:14
which most most things doesn't so they
12:16
they only run with half of their bodies
12:18
that's my fact and it's as true as yours
12:23
let's should we move on to our okay it
12:25
is time for
12:26
fact number two and that is james
12:29
okay my fact this week is that when he
12:31
became president
12:33
lyndon b johnson installed a special
12:35
shower in the white house
12:37
the fire jets directly at his penis
12:40
[Music]
12:42
but he i mean he became president uh
12:44
after the assassination of uh
12:46
kennedy he did yeah so he was saying
12:47
that was a bit tasteless
12:50
it depends how long after he became
12:52
president i suppose immediately after he
12:54
was sworn in he said right let's sort
12:55
out this shower
12:58
he wanted it as well to have the sort of
13:01
the force
13:02
of a fire hose that's right he wanted a
13:05
needle-like
13:06
intensity um which was the equivalent of
13:09
a fire hose
13:10
and he had lots of jets uh especially
13:12
one um
13:13
up his bum and another one directly at
13:16
his penis
13:17
and the jet which went directly at his
13:20
penis he nicknamed
13:21
uh jumbo which is weirdly
13:25
exactly what he nicknamed his actual
13:26
penis and that's true he did
13:29
really yeah it's weird though i think in
13:31
the uk it sounds more of a sort of
13:33
audacious thing
13:34
to name your penis because i have a lot
13:36
of american friends
13:37
who they're just like
13:41
they they have names they're like meet
13:43
jumbo like it's
13:46
meat
13:49
what do you shake hands
13:52
you say that's normal um for your
13:54
american friends
13:55
this this is also something that lbj was
13:58
kind of known for so there's a guy
14:00
called robert carro who's writing a five
14:02
volume uh biography of him he's 80 now
14:04
he's done four volumes he's working on
14:05
the fifth
14:06
listen to this this is about obj um
14:09
he early became famous for a rabbalacian
14:11
earthiness urinating in the parking lot
14:13
of the house office building as the urge
14:15
took him
14:16
if a colleague came into a capital
14:17
bathroom as he was finishing at the
14:18
urinal there he would sometimes swing
14:20
around
14:21
still holding his member which he liked
14:23
to call jumbo looting once
14:25
have you ever seen anything as big as
14:26
this
14:28
and shaking it in a brandishing manner
14:30
as he began discoursing about some
14:32
pending legislation
14:35
he genuinely i can't believe that we've
14:38
only found this out
14:39
like we've been looking at presidents
14:40
for ages and suddenly it's like okay lbj
14:42
just took his penis out a lot and he
14:45
would do it in public
14:46
in front of any reporter that was
14:48
chatting to him his inauguration speech
14:50
actually was
14:52
yeah he's much better attended than
14:54
trump's
14:58
[Laughter]
15:02
i don't know mr president the photos
15:04
don't seem to say that
15:06
it was cold it was raining
15:12
so he would take it out while the
15:13
journalists were sort of talking to him
15:15
famously and this is a bit that
15:17
obviously they just keep having to hide
15:18
these moments because like we can't
15:20
report on this
15:21
they asked him about the vietnam war and
15:23
they were like tell us about why we why
15:25
are we fighting with vietnam
15:26
his response and i think it's because he
15:28
was like i don't quite have an answer
15:29
he unzipped his trousers he pulled out
15:32
his penis and he held it at them and he
15:34
went
15:34
this is why
15:35
[Laughter]
15:39
and isn't it amazing that presidential
15:42
press conferences
15:43
have got no better since then
15:47
he did used to frequently ask aids to
15:49
join him in the
15:50
lavatory didn't he when he was so when
15:52
he was giving them briefings
15:54
or when he was just hanging out with
15:55
them so i think one of this so men and
15:57
women as well one of his aides doris
15:58
kearns goodwin said she often
16:00
accompanied him into the bathroom
16:01
because he needed to take a pee but he
16:03
also wanted to continue talking
16:04
um and she recalled that uh the security
16:07
adviser when he joined
16:09
he complied really reluctantly and he
16:11
stood in the furthest corner away from
16:14
johnson while johnson was urinating
16:15
understandably with his back to him
16:18
and the president said to him come
16:20
closer come closer
16:22
uh i don't know if it was in that tone
16:23
of voice but
16:26
um but then bundy complied and came
16:28
closer and johnson later remarked
16:30
i thought he was going to sit on my lap
16:32
hasn't that guy ever been in the army
16:33
and i don't know what any of that really
16:35
means
16:39
it's so weird so he he had a lot of uh
16:42
affairs
16:43
lbj um al also all the people in his
16:45
family had the initials
16:47
lbj no yeah his wife was called lady
16:50
bird
16:50
johnson her first name was lady no her
16:53
first name was
16:54
bird yeah yeah as in she was sorry
16:57
ladybird was
16:58
was her first name ladybird
17:01
well it kind of was in a way they like
17:04
when she was a kid they called her
17:05
cute as a ladybird uh they're not sure
17:07
if they meant ladybug or
17:09
or whatever and and then she was known
17:11
as bird throughout her whole life
17:12
and then when she became a first lady
17:14
she became first ladybird
17:18
carry on um so he did have a lot of
17:21
affairs
17:22
he used to be very boastful about it
17:24
actually and i think he got quite
17:26
annoyed that
17:27
jfk had a bit of a reputation for being
17:28
a womanizer in his time
17:30
and apparently whenever anyone mentioned
17:32
kennedy's multiple affairs
17:34
johnson would bang the table and declare
17:36
that he had had more women by accident
17:38
than kennedy had had on purpose
17:41
i don't know what that means either
17:46
has a mind of his own
17:47
[Laughter]
17:51
when he wanted to install the shower
17:53
into
17:54
uh the the white house he was questioned
17:56
about him they said
17:57
you know why would we do this and he
17:59
said if i can move 10 000 troops in a
18:02
day you can certainly fix the bathroom
18:04
in any way i want
18:05
and then it was a complete waste because
18:06
as soon as nixon entered the white house
18:08
after him
18:09
he took one look at the elaborate set up
18:10
and said get rid of this stuff
18:12
i like to think he took one shower it
18:14
blew his [ __ ]
18:16
[Laughter]
18:22
the shower did get reviewed by people
18:24
other than lbj
18:26
so i
18:36
lbj by the way he was so he was
18:39
in by all accounts at [ __ ] in in his
18:42
in just like you know he would make
18:44
people come in while he was having a poo
18:46
to sort of tell them what he wanted to
18:47
do and he uh but he also did a lot of
18:49
pranks
18:50
which are quite exciting we have
18:51
mentioned this ages go on the podcast
18:53
but
18:53
he had a car that was a amphibious car
18:57
so it's a car that can drive on the road
18:59
and then go into a body of water and
19:01
still
19:02
work a sort of boat all of a sudden but
19:04
it's still the car
19:05
um yeah so
19:08
what he used to do at the white house is
19:10
he used to drive people around in the
19:12
car and he would be talking to them
19:14
and in the white house property there's
19:15
a bit of a lake it's a tiny bit of body
19:17
water
19:18
where uh you can go and just hang out
19:20
and he would drive the car
19:21
down suddenly down the hill and then he
19:24
would pretend that the brakes had broken
19:25
on the car and he'd go oh no and he
19:28
would freak them out and then they'd hit
19:30
the body of water and then just become a
19:31
boat
19:32
and then high fives all round but
19:34
[Music]
19:36
that was a thing he did while he was
19:38
president so you know
19:39
do we have amphibious cars i do not
19:42
believe we have
19:43
those that switch quickly enough for
19:45
that price have you not have you ever
19:46
been on a duck talk
19:47
yeah i think it takes like 45 minutes
19:49
for them to do the transfer
19:56
okay it is time for fact number three
19:59
and that is andy murray
20:01
my fact is that rejected names for
20:03
british storms
20:04
include baldrick noddy
20:08
megatron and branch wobbler
20:18
why
20:23
[Music]
20:25
um this is we've just had a big storm in
20:27
the uk this was a piece of wire about
20:29
storm uh nomenclature and the met office
20:31
started naming
20:32
british storms in 2015 and the rationale
20:35
was
20:36
you sort of have a better handle it's a
20:38
bit confusing when someone says that a
20:39
large weather system or
20:40
a storm is on the way it's a bit vague
20:42
whereas if you pin a name
20:44
to a storm it makes it a lot more
20:46
concrete and you know
20:47
and the idea is is easier to prepare for
20:50
so they've been doing this in america
20:51
with
20:52
tropical storms and hurricanes and
20:53
things for decades so we've got
20:55
names for our storms and the met office
20:57
in their wisdom asked the public to
20:58
submit names
21:02
there were things one of the rejected
21:03
names was ina teacup
21:06
[Music]
21:11
um there are other rejected ones big
21:14
boss vader voldemort
21:17
my favorite one was uh and i think this
21:19
was for a hurricane
21:20
in the state uh this was from someone
21:22
called at yuldul falcon
21:24
and he wanted to call it schmur kane so
21:26
you'd be hurricane schmurge
21:32
they're usually named after people
21:33
aren't they and it's usually names so
21:35
what was the one doris
21:36
we just had doris yeah um i quite like
21:38
the idea of
21:39
gail and is that one that's been
21:42
accepted
21:43
no no they didn't accept it but it's a
21:45
good one isn't it things and
21:46
a few others like um what was the one
21:48
you said branch wobbler yeah
21:49
so some other things like that leaf
21:51
shaker leaf stripper and root ripper
21:54
that's good and also i quite like
21:56
someone said we should call a storm king
21:57
henry the fifth
22:00
storm through northern france
22:01
[Music]
22:04
during the hundred years war
22:07
um so do you know the first person who
22:09
started to name weather events
22:10
no no uh this is a guy called clement
22:15
it was welsh
22:19
okay okay what storm right
22:22
the first the first person to name
22:26
weather events was a guy called clement
22:28
lindley rag
22:29
this is a british guy in the 19th
22:30
century who lived in tasmania he was a
22:33
meteorologist
22:34
and um he decided to name storms to make
22:37
them more memorable
22:38
but he named them largely after
22:40
politicians
22:41
so that he was able to say in the name
22:43
of a politician he didn't like
22:44
and then followed that with things like
22:47
causing great distress
22:48
so you know david cameron is causing
22:51
great distress
22:52
on the coast of cornwall and uh you know
22:55
george osborne is wondering aimlessly
22:57
about the pacific
23:00
michael gove is blowing people all over
23:03
the place
23:08
so they they named storms only after
23:11
women for a long time
23:12
yeah and that was thought to be very
23:13
misogynistic um because
23:16
the idea was the people who did it was
23:17
in the 19th century and it was
23:20
because um women were similarly
23:22
unpredictable to the weather
23:24
um and then there was they changed it
23:26
eventually thankfully um
23:27
there was a women's rights activist
23:29
called roxy bolton
23:31
uh which is where i spent a lot of my
23:33
teenage years
23:37
um but she suggested um replacing the
23:39
word hurricane because it sounds a bit
23:41
like
23:42
her akane to hemicaine
23:44
[Music]
23:46
so there is a theory that um this is a
23:48
2014 study and it's a bit controversial
23:51
it's the theory that hurricanes in
23:52
america with women's names have higher
23:54
death tolls than those with men's names
23:57
because people think oh it's only
24:00
cindy or whatever it might be isn't they
24:02
think oh i don't need to worry about
24:04
hurricane
24:05
you know is that is that actually what
24:06
they think yeah well yeah it's a it's
24:09
but it is controversial and it is a
24:11
theory and it does include all the data
24:12
from
24:13
i think before the 70s when hurricanes
24:15
only had women's names
24:17
so it seems a bit dubious
24:21
to me yeah do you know what um what roxy
24:24
bolton said
24:26
in her defense of uh hurricanes being
24:29
gender equal
24:30
um she said women are not disasters
24:33
destroying life and communities and
24:35
leaving a lasting and devastating effect
24:38
uh which hey i think that would be so
24:39
cool if we were
24:40
[Music]
24:44
but then she did immediately suggest
24:45
naming them after senators
24:47
that was her suggestion she had an extra
24:50
grind
24:50
it's good that they brought in the names
24:52
um in the olden days you would
24:54
just call the name sometimes after a
24:56
saints day or some other things
24:58
um in ireland they had one very big um
25:01
it wasn't a hurricane it was a storm but
25:02
they called it the night of the big wind
25:08
but it was such a severe storm a lot of
25:10
people thought the end of the world was
25:12
happening because it happened
25:13
on the epiphany and they thought that
25:15
maybe this was
25:16
judgment day or whatever and it was so
25:18
famous in the time in 1908 they
25:20
introduced pensions into ireland
25:22
and they a lot of people didn't have
25:24
their birth records and so the way they
25:26
would tell how old you are
25:27
was to ask you if you remembered the
25:29
night of the big wind
25:33
you know there's a theory um it's it's
25:35
no longer
25:36
believed but back in the day um
25:42
wind was created by time travelers
25:48
all the wind and all the songs were
25:49
created um because
25:51
of trees waving their branches so they
25:54
were
25:54
they were waving that and suddenly winds
25:56
were that makes complete sense
25:58
i think as a child i think you know
26:00
that's a natural thing to think right
26:02
because it's windy
26:02
and there are trees moving yeah and you
26:04
think maybe this comes but then do you
26:06
think like
26:07
oh um this wind is caused by my hat
26:09
falling off
26:10
or something like that
26:16
there's there is a possibility that
26:17
that's not a theory and it's actually a
26:19
poem by ogden nash
26:20
but i it's also a line under pressure
26:23
book you might be thinking of that
26:24
right so we should probably ignore the
26:26
whole last minute yeah
26:28
i've what i find amazing is with weather
26:30
obviously it's
26:31
it's all this kind of butterfly effect
26:33
and chaos theory and stuff like that
26:35
that
26:35
the tiniest little thing can cause
26:36
massive weather systems
26:38
and so that means that weather
26:39
forecasters actually they say that they
26:41
cannot
26:42
predict any weather at all for 14 days
26:46
anything over 14 days it's completely
26:48
impossible wow but we can predict that
26:50
all people are going to fall over
26:53
for three weeks yeah but they often
26:56
fall over when it's windy so i assume
26:58
that old people
26:59
create the wind
27:02
um we should move on to our final fact
27:04
oh i have a quick thing just about
27:06
asking the public
27:07
to name things so a couple years ago
27:10
greenpeace had a competition they wanted
27:12
to name a whale to raise awareness
27:14
of um of whaling and they wanted to sort
27:17
of limit
27:17
japanese whaling efforts and so they had
27:20
they picked a whale and they said
27:22
please submit your names and the
27:23
finalists included things like uh
27:25
kaimala which is a hawaiian word which
27:27
means power of the ocean
27:29
uh there's a word shanti which is
27:31
sanskrit for tranquility and there was a
27:34
huge amount of voting and after all the
27:35
voting had ended the winner
27:37
was mr splashy pants
27:45
and it absolutely crushed the others
27:48
got more than 78 of the vote
27:52
next was humphrey with three percent
27:55
the other top ten got less than one
27:57
percent age
27:58
[Laughter]
28:01
he's still out there swimming around
28:02
this is flashing hands
28:06
okay it is time for our final fact of
28:09
the show
28:09
and that is jacinski yeah my fact this
28:12
week is that
28:14
books of crabs use sea anemones
28:17
as boxing gloves um
28:20
and i don't know why i chose this fact
28:22
because i can't pronounce the word
28:23
anemone
28:25
i actually think if we all just say and
28:27
then
28:29
anemone right i've said it
28:37
i'm just saying
28:44
this is actually a really interesting
28:45
fact guys yeah i was just
28:47
i was thinking with my editor's head on
28:50
i've said it once so now i can snip that
28:52
in
28:52
every single time i know we're gonna get
28:54
wrong every single time aren't we
28:56
so what is it so this is incredible uh
28:59
this is a box of crabs or they're also
29:00
known as pom-pom crabs
29:02
and they use known as pom-pom crabs but
29:05
the obvious reason that on their two
29:06
front claws they always have
29:07
two sea anemones and they associate
29:11
often poisonous to other fish even
29:13
though they're not to us they have like
29:14
poison cells in them
29:15
so they use these to ward off other fish
29:17
and they just wave these anemones at
29:19
other fish
29:19
to make sure they go away but the thing
29:22
that they've discovered in the last few
29:23
weeks
29:24
is that if a boxer crab loses one of the
29:26
anemones off one of its claws
29:28
it will tear the other one in half and
29:31
they reproduce egg sexually so
29:33
effectively the crab
29:34
is cloning the anemone and it shoves
29:37
that anemone onto its other claw so it
29:39
rips it in half
29:40
shoves it onto its other claw and they
29:42
think this is one of the main ways that
29:44
this species of anemone reproduces
29:46
insane
29:47
it's like the equivalent of like
29:49
fighting mike tyson knocking a glove off
29:58
except that it's a live species that
30:00
it's doing it so it's like if mike tyson
30:01
was boxing you and he's got cats
30:05
to defend and himself rips a cat in two
30:09
and it grows another
30:10
into a cat the other thing this crab
30:13
does
30:13
if it wants to eat because it can't put
30:15
them down because um
30:18
so it constantly has to be holding these
30:20
two anemones for its defense
30:22
but sometimes it needs to eat so what it
30:23
does it just leans over to some food and
30:25
wipes the anemone along the surface it
30:27
wants to eat from
30:29
so it's like the cat food for you so
30:31
what it's like is
30:32
holding a cat in your hands and then
30:34
dipping it in some soup
30:36
and then sucking it off the cat
30:42
the other annoying thing for the
30:44
anemones is that the crabs starve them
30:46
to an extent
30:47
because if they're allowed to eat the
30:49
normal amount that they would eat they'd
30:50
be too heavy for them to carry on their
30:52
claws
30:52
so the crabs really control their eating
30:54
like a horrible dietitian or something
30:57
to make sure that they remain light
30:58
enough for them to carry what
31:00
it's a tough gig so what also happens
31:04
is that say you're a crab and you've
31:06
only got one
31:07
anemone and then you meet another guy
31:10
who's got two of them
31:11
then you can fight him to get one of him
31:13
one of them off him
31:14
no okay now say you have three of them
31:17
and one guy's got none
31:18
they'll keep fighting and then they'll
31:20
rip them apart and rip them apart
31:22
until it doesn't matter what the number
31:23
of crabs is they'll keep doing it until
31:25
everyone has one on each
31:27
um yeah it's incredible it's weird that
31:29
they fight though because
31:31
all the fights end up with the guy who
31:33
had two he then only has one and he says
31:35
okay well i'll just rip mine in two now
31:36
i've got two
31:37
but they have this weird little
31:38
wrestling match
31:41
are you saying they should just
31:42
distribute it at the start go how many
31:44
of us are we okay we need double
31:46
that i'll cut them up exactly yeah it's
31:48
very bizarre
31:49
yeah maybe it's flirtatious though
31:52
because um
31:53
a lot of crabs use their claws to flirt
31:55
so one of the most famous examples is
31:57
the fiddler crab
31:58
and the fiddler crab looks so cool
32:00
because it really does just have this
32:01
one
32:02
claw which is enormous and a different
32:04
color as the rest of its body so
32:06
it's often like blue or yellow really
32:08
bright color
32:09
and the way they seduce is they just
32:11
wave
32:12
and so that gives a lady a wave when
32:15
they're a distance away
32:16
and then as the lady gets closer they
32:18
then start using their claw to vibrate
32:20
i think and they vibrate the ground with
32:22
their claw and uh scientists are saying
32:24
it's like morse code
32:26
as in they're communicating with their
32:27
vibrations but basically what it does is
32:29
uh if
32:30
the longer they can vibrate and and the
32:32
harder
32:33
er
32:38
the more stamina they have and so women
32:40
think yeah this guy's
32:45
so i started looking into um other
32:47
animals
32:48
that use other animals to attack so yeah
32:51
so animals are like i now have a weapon
32:54
and it's alive
32:55
yeah and uh and i was very surprised by
32:58
finding out that dolphins
32:59
do this as well not just a boxing crap
33:02
yeah so what do they use
33:03
to attack sea snakes really
33:06
yeah so check this out this is
33:08
extraordinary so dolphins will find a
33:10
sea snake
33:11
and it will bite it on the midsection
33:13
and it will
33:14
drag it immediately and plunge it into a
33:16
school of fish all these things need to
33:18
be very close to each other as it
33:19
happens
33:20
they grab it and they bring it through
33:21
and the snake is freaking out and it's
33:23
biting things as it goes along
33:24
so what it does is as it shoots into the
33:26
school of fish the snake is biting
33:28
all these fish and killing them as it
33:30
goes and then the dolphin releases the
33:32
snake and heads back and finds
33:34
the booty wow yeah isn't that
33:37
extraordinary
33:38
yeah and then there's this other thing
33:39
that i read about which is called the
33:41
indiana jones octopus
33:42
[Laughter]
33:44
i've renamed it um it's actually called
33:47
the blanket octopus
33:48
and it's an extraordinary it's an
33:50
extraordinary octopus and that it's got
33:52
webbing between its tentacles that's
33:53
very rare but it uses it so it can sail
33:55
through the ocean which is
33:57
quite exciting it takes the tides and
33:58
just kind of goes but it's immune
34:01
to the man of war jellyfish and what it
34:03
does
34:04
is it grips it with a tentacle and when
34:06
it's going up to a prey that it wants to
34:08
eat
34:09
it whips it like a whip that's the thing
34:12
so we'll go
34:13
tap and it'll hit it poison it and kill
34:16
it
34:16
and then they'll die and they'll eat it
34:18
so they're indiana jones stole
34:19
octopuses in the ocean whipping stuff to
34:22
death
34:23
that's incredible why is this not one
34:24
day but edinburgh's planet earth why
34:26
haven't we not
34:27
seen that guy that is unbelievable yeah
34:30
it's pretty much quite romantic
34:31
in lots of ways so the mating is they
34:34
most crabs can only
34:35
make when they've malted so when they're
34:36
out of their skin and when they're soft
34:38
and vulnerable
34:38
and then they they meet yeah when they
34:41
yeah exactly
34:42
when they they have both literally made
34:44
themselves vulnerable to each other
34:46
they take their clothes off and they
34:47
take their clothes off that's so nice
34:49
so they meet the first thing is they
34:51
meet and then they hug each other for
34:53
several days
34:54
[Music]
34:55
and then they mold and then they mate i
34:58
don't know you say that is romantic but
35:00
being hooked for several days it's one
35:03
of them going
35:04
oh yeah okay
35:08
that definitely sounds one-sided um we
35:11
need to wrap up very shortly
35:12
so do you guys have stuff you want to
35:13
say before we do i really got distracted
35:15
by lobsters
35:16
when researching this which we like
35:18
crabs but more fun
35:20
[Music]
35:22
so just really quickly just on
35:23
crustaceans fighting so lobsters i
35:25
didn't realize
35:26
all hate each other so if a lobster
35:28
comes across another lobster
35:30
then they'll start fighting that's why
35:31
lobster nets aren't that effective
35:33
because as soon as one lobster is in
35:34
there
35:34
it fights off all the other lobsters
35:36
that try to get in
35:38
what happens
35:41
this is my safe space
35:47
i am king of this enclosed prison
35:50
nothing can harm me
35:52
[Music]
35:56
so what there is in every lobster
35:57
community there's a dominant lobster and
35:59
what he does is every night
36:00
he goes out around the other male
36:02
lobsters houses and he beats them up
36:03
just to show
36:05
just to show that he's the main lobster
36:07
genuinely and the women are really
36:09
turned on by this so
36:10
the women try to seduce him because
36:11
they're like he's the dominant one
36:13
um but as national geographic said the
36:16
problem when the women go to his door
36:18
and knock on his door and say i want to
36:19
mate with you you're the dominant
36:20
lobster is
36:21
he just wants to beat people up all the
36:22
time
36:24
so he's not that interested in sex and
36:26
so what the female lobsters do
36:28
is um they release a pheromone so they
36:30
they urinate out their eyes which
36:32
lobsters do
36:34
that is much more romantic
36:38
this releases a drug into the nail
36:40
obstalaire which relaxes him
36:42
uh and then means that he's ready to
36:44
mate but
36:46
i just i can't believe someone urinates
36:48
out their eyes at you and your first
36:50
thing is i'm now so relaxed
36:54
i'm ready for sexy time
36:57
netflix and going out the eyes
37:03
i'm gonna wrap us up okay that is it

this week sitting in his place
01:15
is erica mcallister erica mcallister is
01:18
a friend of ours she works at the
01:19
natural history museum
01:21
and she is their curator of flies
01:23
diptera
01:24
and uh she's got a new book out it's
01:26
called the secret life of flies
01:28
she took three years to write this book
01:29
it's everything that she knows about
01:31
flies and she knows a lot about flies
01:33
she knows so much stuff about flies and
01:35
also
01:35
she has no time for people who don't
01:37
like flies which is why i wasn't allowed
01:39
on the process
01:41
so the book's going to be out april 3rd
01:43
it was really exciting to have her on
01:44
the show she was really awesome
01:46
and she told us that she was going to
01:48
make sure she always brought it back to
01:49
flies and she did no matter what we were
01:51
talking about
01:52
okay on with the show
01:58
[Music]
02:04
[Applause]
02:09
hello and welcome to another episode of
02:12
no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast
02:14
coming to you from the qi offices in
02:16
covent garden
02:17
my name is dan schreiber and i'm sitting
02:19
here with anna chazinski
02:20
andrew hunter murray and the natural
02:22
history museum's curator of diptra that
02:24
means flies
02:25
it's erica mcallister and once again we
02:28
have gathered round the microphones with
02:30
our four
02:30
favorite facts from the last seven days
02:32
and in no particular order
02:34
here we go starting with you erica
02:38
my fact is that the vinegar fly sperm is
02:40
so long that if humans have the same
02:42
sperm to body ratio
02:44
as the fly for example then dan's sperm
02:47
would be the size of a sperm
02:49
whale whoa do you feel proud
02:53
that's so when you say size
02:56
is that the the left as long as the blue
02:58
wet
02:59
as a sperm if it was blue that would be
03:01
quite extraordinary but it's a sperm
03:03
whale so it's about 120 feet i read
03:06
roughly is that right or not it's meters
03:08
science
03:09
can you not do it no no it's new money
03:11
no 33 meters
03:13
33 meters yeah a third of a 100 meter
03:16
sprinting thing so three of dan's sperm
03:17
will be able to stretch
03:18
the length of usain bolt's run yes yeah
03:22
that's quite a nice graphic i hadn't
03:24
quite
03:26
thought process but thank you why do
03:27
they need sperm that long
03:29
um they don't have a lot of sperm oh
03:31
okay and they don't go through the
03:32
teenage years so they don't waste it
03:34
and what they do is that because it the
03:36
females are very very promiscuous
03:38
okay and this is all nature that females
03:40
are designed to be promiscuous
03:42
and we're only doing it for our
03:43
offspring it's not for fun that's what i
03:45
tell
03:46
people and and so what we originally
03:49
thought that if there was lots of sperm
03:50
competition
03:51
you make loads of it and it was great
03:53
and actually what these do
03:54
is their sperm is so large the actual
03:56
sperm pushes
03:58
the other sperm out of the way whoa i
04:00
know
04:01
pushes them out of the way of what like
04:03
in the opening in the genital opening it
04:05
pushes
04:06
away yep um they've got quite exciting
04:08
penises
04:09
have they what are their penises yeah
04:10
what are their penises like hello
04:14
it depends on species some of them have
04:15
got like little combs some of them
04:17
like got like little whips they've got
04:19
little tickling organs they've got all
04:20
sorts of things
04:21
wow sounds like a whole ann summers shop
04:23
but just inside a penis
04:26
another thing i read is that this
04:27
particular flight vinegar fly yep
04:30
has testes which are a tenth of its body
04:32
weight they're enormous
04:33
because they have to produce this so
04:35
they're not the biggest in comparison to
04:36
body size in animal kingdom the
04:38
sagebrush cricket gets that 14
04:40
okay and you can look it up you know we
04:42
study this but they do need because when
04:45
they want to produce this sperm and it
04:46
is one at a time that basically it's
04:48
pumped out not
04:49
not like the thousands that dan wastes
04:51
yeah
04:52
[Laughter]
04:53
so dan's dan's testicles here and i've
04:55
estimated your weight i think they'd be
04:57
uh well over a stone maybe seven and a
04:59
half kilos so as you as
05:01
you're lining up next to usain bolt
05:05
bouncing along on them like space
05:08
hoppers
05:11
wow i've also got a real image of your
05:13
sperm that i want someone to draw
05:15
with just very thick roomed glasses and
05:17
a weird
05:18
if you're listening to this do not draw
05:19
that and send it to schreiberland
05:22
don't do it and this is the other thing
05:25
about it so
05:25
supposedly the the sperma they're like
05:27
balls of twine
05:28
yeah they're really really thin so it
05:30
looks like somebody has just given a cat
05:32
a load of wool
05:33
right and then somebody's come in and
05:35
quickly had to tidy up and shoved it all
05:37
back together
05:39
it's all it's always the same when the
05:40
cleaning lady comes around
05:44
um the guy um the guy who i think first
05:47
found out about the vinegar flight and
05:49
their extremely long sperm
05:50
yeah scott picnic he has a tattoo
05:54
of a sperm cell on his arm to sort of
05:56
commemorate this discovery
05:58
that's very cool he's put up photos of
05:59
it online and it is all over his arm
06:02
yeah it have to be well it is the length
06:04
of his arm
06:05
it's uh it's a huge tattoo although he
06:07
should have made it the length of you
06:09
know as we've said proportionally
06:12
yeah so he should have made it running
06:14
all up and down his body yeah he needs
06:16
30 meters of it
06:17
yeah i guess he should um is it true
06:21
that
06:22
the way as someone who um
06:25
looks for new species of flies as you do
06:27
at the natural history museum
06:28
is it true that you identify them
06:30
through their genitals more than
06:31
anything else
06:32
well not through their genitals because
06:34
that would be odd
06:36
but yeah um species descriptions is
06:38
basically it's always done on
06:39
male genitalia female genitalia is
06:42
really similar
06:43
so the whole thing about it being a lock
06:45
and key doesn't quite make sense
06:47
but um the idea now i have got this
06:49
great idea that we're very into 3d
06:50
printing and micro ct scanning
06:53
we can actually do 3d genitalia get
06:55
glasses
06:56
walk through we could have like theme
06:58
parks or fly genitalia
07:01
i'm sure the nhm would totally go for a
07:03
new gallery of like walks through
07:04
genitalia is this the thing that you've
07:06
been pitching at every weekly meeting
07:08
any more business before we end could
07:10
you call it through the pee hole
07:12
[Laughter]
07:14
isn't there so i was reading about
07:15
apparently they think the reason it has
07:17
one big sperm that it leaves in a packet
07:20
on top of the women's abdomen and then
07:23
she puts it into her genitals the reason
07:25
it's so big is so that it blocks it up
07:27
like a plug
07:28
do other flies do that no i mean
07:30
basically every animal has a plug
07:31
humans have plugs ours is just a little
07:33
bit more fluid oh okay
07:36
yeah so the female seminal fluid is the
07:38
plug trying to kill all the sperm
07:40
but also the european plugs are slightly
07:42
different they are very and you need an
07:44
adapter sometimes
07:46
and so yeah so flies go out of their way
07:48
to try and make these plugs and a lot of
07:49
flies actually use themselves
07:51
so they do practice sexual suicide the
07:54
male
07:54
when he's in cop with the female yeah
07:57
and he's pumped
07:58
his sperm up yeah a lot of them will
08:00
sacrifice themselves we'll let the
08:02
females
08:02
eat them and then so she's so busy doing
08:06
that it's a longer sperm transferal
08:08
so he's got a greater chance so he uses
08:11
him so there's a
08:12
type of fighting midge that basically
08:14
when she's in cop and she's facing him
08:16
she soars through his eyeballs releases
08:18
a digestive enzyme
08:20
his insides dissolve she sucks them up
08:23
his body breaks off
08:24
snaps leaves the penis in her she just
08:26
whips it out afterwards
08:28
brilliant whoa you know when we our
08:30
parents as humans talk about the
08:32
sacrifices they've made
08:33
yeah they know nothing no idea
08:36
i had my body dissolved by your mother
08:39
well the bush
08:40
crickets with your your massive sperm
08:42
she will eat his wings
08:43
how come because he gives her something
08:45
like mid-cop
08:46
to nibble on to keep her there because
08:48
females basically only care about food
08:50
and then does he have to walk home
08:52
afterwards i can't do anything
08:54
basically that's it for him because no
08:56
other female is going to be interesting
08:57
no point in even doing the
08:58
wingless walk of shame right it's why i
09:00
go on any date with a packet of pringles
09:02
in either hand
09:03
it's so it's like women don't eat so
09:05
mid-day
09:06
i can provide the pringles to them and
09:08
they'll stay on the date with me for
09:09
longer because you've got to keep the
09:10
female interested
09:11
there's a whole group of flies that the
09:12
females don't even hunt and so the males
09:15
would bring them gifts
09:16
so the females would feed they would
09:17
have sex it was all great but the
09:19
females finished before the male so the
09:21
females would just disappear
09:22
and then i was like but we haven't
09:24
finished and so the males learnt to wrap
09:26
up their gifts so it was like taking a
09:28
box of chocolates so she'd take
09:30
so much time opening the fly up that he
09:33
would have lots of sex
09:34
but it went the opposite way because
09:36
then she she spent so much time he was
09:38
like when i finished so another group
09:40
basically stole back this half-eaten box
09:42
of chocolates and re-wrapped it
09:44
to give to another fly what are they
09:45
wrapping it in oh saliva
09:47
nice yeah it's my favorite kind of
09:49
wrapping paper um
09:50
so some other questions i have about
09:52
flies while you're here so they flap
09:54
their wings super fast right yeah
09:55
like 300 times a second which i find
09:57
insane but i was reading that some of
09:58
them have
09:59
someone called it a gearbox mechanism
10:02
where
10:02
you have do they have grooves or
10:04
something and they can kind of change
10:06
gear
10:06
to make themselves go faster or slower
10:08
well they have um
10:10
they do have that but flies probably are
10:12
the most efficient and most amazing
10:13
flyers on the planet but their vision is
10:15
what's really important here because
10:17
they see
10:17
so much faster so we are or is it half a
10:20
second behind real time
10:21
what it takes us that long to process
10:23
what goes on
10:24
so actually we're never in the present
10:26
moment okay we're always in the past
10:28
but flies are milliseconds
10:31
like nano so hence why they do
10:33
everything so much faster
10:34
because so if i and obviously i'm
10:36
advocating do not swap them
10:38
but if we went to sort them they would
10:40
just see that as really slow motion
10:41
and at the last minute they can just
10:42
walk out the way so if you do want to
10:44
catch a fly
10:45
do it really slowly because then
10:47
actually it appears like a solid object
10:50
like neo at the end of the first major
10:51
very much like neo okay
10:53
yeah well that's they have described
10:55
that is that so yeah
10:56
what bullet time bullet time yeah is
10:59
what they call it in the matrix when
11:00
yeah everything goes slow and bushy
11:01
yeah i should have watched spider-man
11:03
can do that as well as you see in that
11:05
scene in spider-man and spiders catch
11:07
flies ah but there's flies that eat
11:09
spiders
11:10
no no no no no it is and they are so
11:12
cool there's three species in the uk
11:14
and they're called across areas
11:15
hunchback flies and they look gorgeous
11:18
and the female she lays loads of eggs
11:20
but she doesn't lay them she's basically
11:21
got a machine gun as an ovi poster
11:23
and so she just rapidly fires out
11:25
hundreds of these eggs like
11:27
around the garden and she wants them to
11:30
land on vegetation that's slightly
11:31
raised off the
11:32
the ground and then the larvae have got
11:34
like a sucker on the end of them and
11:35
they kind of like
11:36
stand up in the air they just don't care
11:38
waving around and then they look down
11:40
and when a spider runs along
11:41
they kind of hurl themselves at the
11:43
spider and then they run
11:44
to the spider by the way they've got no
11:46
legs so you can
11:47
like inchworm crawling to the spider up
11:49
the leg into the abdomen
11:52
but what's really cool if the spider is
11:53
immature and spiders can live to about
11:55
five years they would do a little bit of
11:56
munching and then basically go to sleep
11:58
and wake up when the spider is mature
12:00
and they can eat the right organs
12:02
really yeah so the inside that they have
12:04
a nap inside the spider for two years
12:06
three years but it's not just spiders so
12:08
i read that there was uh there's
12:09
a name here that i can't properly
12:10
pronounce but lucilla
12:12
buffon nevorah have you heard of that
12:14
buffy for shorts yeah
12:17
yeah and so they have a similar uh
12:18
larvae thing where they go into a frog's
12:20
head
12:21
and then they eat the frog's head from
12:23
the inside and it is amazing if you see
12:24
the frog's head have you seen it yeah i
12:26
saw the photos
12:27
yeah okay go and have a look at the
12:28
images because it's like completely
12:30
deformed like
12:31
collapsed it's like i'm not sure we
12:33
should be advocating this sort of
12:34
behavior
12:35
well your garden honestly if you really
12:36
knew what was going on in it it's just
12:38
like
12:39
it's different yeah and everyone isn't
12:42
about cute nature
12:44
everything is eating everything ripping
12:46
limbs off and eating their insides out
12:55
okay it is time for fact number two and
12:57
that is my fact
12:59
my fact this week is that whenever he
13:00
got really angry winston churchill would
13:03
throw his teeth
13:04
across the room yeah whenever
13:07
well not every single time but uh when
13:10
he got really angry
13:11
apparently that's when you knew the
13:13
teeth were coming out uh so
13:15
so winston churchill had uh false teeth
13:18
dentures and
13:19
he had three sets of them he had a
13:21
dentist who made them for him called
13:23
derrick cudlip and derek cudlip
13:25
specifically made these teeth
13:27
and so he used to get called in to the
13:30
war rooms whenever churchill flung his
13:32
teeth across the room
13:33
because they would break so he would
13:34
arrive with a new set of teeth to give
13:36
him to pop back in and then he would
13:38
take the old pair
13:39
and he would go off and he would fix
13:40
them while he was gone
13:42
so he used to break them a lot churchill
13:44
when he got angry
13:45
some of it was by throwing it against
13:46
the wall the other times was when he was
13:48
biting too hard through stress and anger
13:50
of what was going on
13:52
and it was so important these teeth to
13:54
him because
13:55
as far as churchill was concerned part
13:57
of the major push of winning the war was
13:59
his voice
14:00
was him going on the radio and saying
14:02
all these inspiring things
14:04
so when the call up came for the dentist
14:06
to go to war
14:07
he tore up the paper and said it is more
14:09
important for the war effort that this
14:11
man is here
14:11
looking after my teeth than it is for
14:13
him to be fighting on the front lines
14:16
it was his technician wasn't it cuddlit
14:18
was the technician who made it and then
14:19
his dentist
14:20
was so wilfred fish both excellent names
14:24
so as you say he thought his speech was
14:26
very important and he had a slight
14:28
speech impediment so he had kind of a
14:29
lisp
14:30
and he thought that was a vital part of
14:31
how he was going to rally the troops and
14:33
so
14:33
he made them make specially designed
14:35
dentures that were slightly soft so that
14:37
he could actually preserve his lisp
14:39
so that he could make invigorating lispy
14:41
speeches that he did it's amazing
14:42
yeah and you can so the reason i know
14:45
about this is because i read an article
14:46
where a few years ago his teeth were
14:48
auctioned off
14:49
so someone actually bought his teeth and
14:51
it was sold i believe by the family of
14:54
mr cudlip and uh yeah i can't take that
14:57
name seriously
14:59
i'm sorry but the really cool thing the
15:01
guy who
15:02
bought them he was a collector of
15:05
churchill memorabilia
15:06
and he already owned the microphone that
15:08
churchill had made a lot of these
15:09
speeches into
15:10
and then he had the teeth that went with
15:12
the microphone so he said in a sense he
15:15
had reunited
15:16
them i mean all he was missing was
15:17
actually winston churchill yeah the
15:19
guardian headline about the auctioning
15:20
of the teeth i just have to read that it
15:21
was we shall bite them on the beaches
15:23
pretty good very good yeah yeah um i
15:26
actually looked up
15:27
as far as i could a list of things that
15:28
had been auctioned off churchill's
15:30
um so there were quite a few things his
15:32
funeral plans were auctioned
15:34
um they went for 472 pounds a violin
15:37
made from one of his cigar boxes
15:39
uh was also auctioned off and a calgary
15:42
stetson
15:43
cowboy hat that was auctioned off as
15:45
well i read the thing
15:46
that was auctioned off it came with a
15:48
dvd which showed a clip of him putting
15:50
on the hat
15:52
presumably which is kind of sensible
15:54
because you want authentication
15:56
one thing that uh of churchill's that
15:57
went up for auction was a
15:59
file of his blood and it was withdrawn
16:02
from auction after the very
16:04
understandable objections of his family
16:06
members who said i don't we don't need a
16:07
file of winston churchill's blood going
16:08
out for sale
16:09
but it was only put on auction at 300
16:11
pounds which i think
16:12
if you're gonna do the really gruesome
16:14
thing of putting a file of somebody's
16:16
blood up at least
16:17
put it up for 50 grand so we were
16:19
looking into this because
16:20
obviously you go around the world and
16:21
you go into all the nice big cathedrals
16:23
and there's
16:23
an artifact and it's like okay i have a
16:26
finger of jesus christ and we're like
16:28
brilliant and um i've now seen god knows
16:30
how many vials of blood of jesus christ
16:32
really
16:33
yeah and so the scientist to me is like
16:34
oh we should just sequence this
16:36
yeah you know we can do it now we've got
16:38
the technology and but like with all the
16:40
bones and all the artifacts apparently
16:41
you can make like
16:42
four or five jesus christ the natural
16:45
history museum gets
16:45
no we haven't got said those no we don't
16:49
get said that so i think
16:50
could you make your own jesus christ
16:52
would he have the blood
16:53
well no so it's not like when you
16:56
you guys brought back the ibex yeah 2
16:59
000.
17:00
we didn't bring it back no it wasn't
17:01
there no no no no no
17:13
well another churchill relic is uh went
17:16
to auction in 2015 and that was
17:18
the stub of one of his cigars that he
17:20
had smoked while
17:21
in hospital in his hospital bed uh times
17:24
have changed
17:24
um but he uh you can you can get a lot
17:27
of that out there
17:28
cigars of church hills little stubs um
17:31
there's plenty of them around they keep
17:32
going on auction and the reason is is
17:34
that he never used to finish a cigar he
17:36
used to only smoke them halfway through
17:38
and there's a lot of accounts of
17:39
churchill being very acutely aware of
17:41
the fact that the cigar
17:43
was his trademark look so there's
17:45
accounts of him as they're pulling up to
17:46
places
17:47
him saying stop the car and he'd light
17:49
up a cigar and say branding it's all
17:50
about branding
17:51
you wouldn't say that
17:55
that is in 50 years that's going to be a
17:56
churchill miss quote and it's going to
17:58
be your fault
17:59
branding it's all about branding it was
18:01
something like that i can't remember you
18:02
guys seemed very corporate though
18:04
yeah i mean if he's worrying about his
18:06
how he speaks and his teeth yeah well
18:08
and of course the thing with his uh
18:09
whiskey drinking where he knew that
18:10
whiskey was part of his image and he
18:12
massively watered down his whiskey all
18:13
the time because he didn't want to be
18:14
drunk but
18:15
i think i think that's fair enough i
18:17
think that's i think it's good that he
18:18
wasn't absolutely smashed all the way
18:20
through the wall
18:20
obviously that's fine but you didn't
18:22
have to cultivate the whiskey image yeah
18:24
[Music]
18:26
as i believe he once said branding it's
18:28
all about banding
18:30
just on his cigars his mom hated the
18:32
fact that he smoked cigars
18:34
and she said to him when he started she
18:36
said him when he was 15. if you knew how
18:37
foolish and silly you looked doing it
18:39
you would give up immediately
18:40
and i just i love the idea because
18:42
parents always say that when you start
18:43
smoking and you're 15. and they're like
18:44
you look like an idiot i know you think
18:46
you look cool
18:47
and churchill's mom was saying to him
18:48
you look like a damned fool churchill
18:50
and she actually paid him to give up
18:52
smoking so he did give up for six months
18:54
i think you've like done a really bad
18:56
public health message there
18:59
look he turned out really well yeah
19:03
one day you too could beat fascism
19:08
what you said dan about how um he
19:10
thought the speeches were a hugely
19:11
important part of um
19:12
the war effort and mural and this this
19:14
kind of stuff i was reading about the
19:16
reaction to
19:17
one of his most famous other speeches
19:18
the dunkirk one so just after
19:20
the british army had um been kicked out
19:23
of france
19:24
by the nazis the speech we shall fight
19:26
on the beaches
19:27
and in all the other locations
19:30
as the first draft had it brackets fill
19:33
in here
19:34
branding anyway supposedly that reaction
19:37
didn't
19:38
the speech did not get a great reaction
19:40
so when you read it out in the house of
19:41
commons
19:41
his wife uh clementine she told a friend
19:44
that and i'm quoting it a great section
19:45
of the tory party were not behind
19:47
winston
19:48
and had received his speech even in
19:49
sullen silence so
19:51
lots of the reactions were not actually
19:54
as good as we think they were at the
19:55
time and it was more when the tide of
19:56
the war turned a bit
19:58
for example in about 1942 that they've
20:00
really got a great reaction then
20:02
okay is it is it true that he basically
20:04
just used anglo-saxon
20:06
words in that speech because he he
20:09
really went like patriotic patriotic
20:12
patriotic
20:13
so he tried to use any other words so
20:15
it's all very solid old english words
20:17
that is
20:18
fascinating yeah yeah even though
20:20
they're kind of germanic
20:22
in origin really should have been using
20:24
some nice romance languages like the
20:25
french
20:26
that wasn't going so well
20:27
[Laughter]
20:30
so the the original speech when
20:31
churchill made it wasn't broadcast
20:33
because the house of commons wasn't
20:34
wired for sound
20:35
and on the radio that evening they said
20:36
churchill said these things in the house
20:38
of commerce today and then quoted him
20:40
so where did we get the recording sorry
20:41
of the beaches script if it wasn't
20:43
recorded in the house of commons at the
20:44
time churchill re-recorded them later on
20:46
no way and in fact he recorded them
20:48
after the war was over he's so corporate
20:50
that is so cool he is aware i feel like
20:54
obama getting into a recording booth and
20:56
doing his yes we can speak
20:58
right yeah well it was in 1949 that he
21:00
recorded these and these were the ones
21:02
that were sold
21:03
by emi and i think possibly decker too
21:05
uh and there was they were
21:06
they were sold in the states as well
21:08
this is honestly so disappointing i
21:10
reckon i've definitely listened to those
21:12
at some point with after a bottle of
21:14
wine and
21:14
got really emotional and thought god
21:16
it's like i'm right there and that's
21:18
just him sitting in 1949
21:20
in a little white business room that is
21:23
so depressing
21:24
it's the experience of hearing them is
21:26
very emotive and i think when you hear
21:28
those words you know we can all
21:29
remember him saying how he says we will
21:31
fight them on the beaches
21:32
we actually says we will fight on the
21:34
beaches so there we go
21:36
i mean doing it like later on as he did
21:38
he could probably add more emphasis
21:40
because he knew how it turned out yeah
21:46
wow you're amazing i've got a funny
21:50
[Laughter]
21:56
feeling
21:58
okay it is time for fact number three
22:00
and that is josinski
22:02
yeah my fact this week is that art
22:04
galleries wedge marbles between
22:06
paintings and the wall
22:08
so that if anyone tries to steal the
22:09
painting the marbles fall on the floor
22:11
and make a clattering noise
22:13
and that's just a classic art gallery
22:15
anti-theft device
22:17
is that a classic is it is a classic yes
22:20
i read this in salon
22:21
and it was in an article called how to
22:24
foil an art heist and the person who
22:26
wrote it is someone who advises museums
22:28
on this kind of thing and galleries
22:29
and he said he can't name the museums
22:31
who'd do this because they don't want to
22:32
give away their
22:34
really advanced tactics but yeah
22:35
apparently this is quite common
22:36
especially if there are galleries that
22:38
have budget constraints you just shove
22:40
some marbles wedge them between the
22:42
painting and the wall and as you can
22:43
imagine if a thief tries to lift the
22:45
painting off the wall
22:46
and they go clattering to the ground the
22:47
thief might scarper yeah
22:49
you bought a trip yeah outside my flat
22:53
when they put the garden gates and they
22:54
were like
22:55
have you have this extra bit on top of
22:56
the garden gate which is really flimsy
22:59
so if someone tries to climb over that
23:01
smashes
23:02
oh wow and uh it's it's yeah so a lot of
23:04
people it's like oh
23:06
it's the home alone method of defending
23:08
your gallery isn't it the galleries also
23:10
recommend
23:11
installing tarantulas around the place
23:13
yes and little cardboard cut outs of
23:15
people to make it look like the gallery
23:16
is always really gorgeous
23:17
yeah they're just dancing all the time
23:19
in the window so you wouldn't have
23:20
tarantulas
23:21
that would be like the worst they can
23:23
only just flick hairs you want to really
23:24
go for something else in the tarantula
23:26
what do you go for
23:27
i'd go for a death stalker scorpion
23:29
death stalker scorpio or a scalopendra
23:31
like the big centipedes here you go tips
23:34
i just say they're pretty more
23:36
aggressive
23:37
i'd love if you're in charge of security
23:42
i'd have flesh eating spiders but they
23:44
go away and slowly
23:46
these necrotic wounds carried on eating
23:48
them
23:49
we have a lot of problems because
23:50
obviously in the old days
23:52
natural history collectors were very
23:54
obsessive obviously we're very normal
23:56
nowadays
23:56
a lot of people would come in with
23:58
various different apparel
24:00
to actually go through the collections
24:02
and pick out specimens they hadn't got
24:04
in their own collections
24:05
so and this is a era of top hats and
24:08
things like that
24:09
so underneath in there they would have
24:10
like foam bases in the top
24:13
in the inside of their top hat so they
24:15
go into the collection
24:16
stick a load of butterflies in it put
24:18
that back on wow
24:20
no way yeah and these were collectors
24:22
who just wanted to steal from the nhs
24:23
yeah because they wanted the stuff for
24:25
themselves there's
24:26
there's some very famous cases and
24:27
there's a lot of people who
24:29
i mean that's wrong but what they did a
24:31
lot of them was even worse
24:33
they took the data of the specimens now
24:35
to me that's like you might as well
24:37
it's like oh and then it's ruined it's
24:38
ruined for life there's nothing we can
24:40
do
24:40
when it was collected away and it is
24:42
just a dead state you know what steel
24:44
and hopefully we'll get it back one day
24:45
because some child
24:46
in the family like three generations on
24:48
would donate it to us
24:50
uh but if you take off the data that's
24:52
it it's dead it's double dead
24:54
why don't you take it to us there's
24:56
nothing we could do with it
24:58
why would they say they sort of take
25:00
they leave the thing behind but they
25:01
just take the
25:02
yeah very famous person
25:06
he he did a vera he did that all the
25:08
time and um he also put on different
25:11
data
25:11
and it was like oh i'm just a mess with
25:13
you was he trying to build up his own
25:15
collection
25:16
sort of say i've collected all these
25:18
things he was trying to make himself to
25:19
be the most amazing
25:20
like collector at the time and it was
25:22
like ah yes and that's why we're very
25:25
careful about security
25:26
and top hats no longer allowed no longer
25:28
allowed no yeah
25:30
i think i found the most prolific uh art
25:33
destroyer
25:34
who was not a thief of art it's a woman
25:37
called mrs breitweiser
25:39
who was the mother of a french art thief
25:42
uh and destroyed
25:44
the art that her son had stolen and he
25:47
asked her to destroy evidence too
25:49
and i've got written down here that she
25:51
destroyed a billion pounds worth of
25:53
stolen very prolific art thief why
25:55
didn't he destroy it
25:57
i'd tell your mum to do your dirty work
25:59
i know but this is not he's not the only
26:00
one so there was a
26:01
thief called radu dogaru who asked his
26:03
mom to burn all the artworks he'd stolen
26:05
so that the police wouldn't find them
26:06
and she did she put them in the stove
26:08
and she burned them all up and then
26:09
forensics experts had to go through all
26:11
the ashes in the bottom of her stove
26:13
and pick out tiny tiny bits of say
26:15
picasso's signature
26:17
like tiny you know fractions of a
26:19
millimeter long yeah just so they could
26:21
measure them and say
26:22
that is the kind of paint that would
26:24
have been used in this monitor
26:26
yeah yeah yeah yeah these are the sad
26:28
little boys living in their mom's attic
26:30
doing their crime and then bringing it
26:32
home to their mummy to sort out it's
26:34
bizarre there have been two separate
26:35
cases of
26:35
you know getting your mum to destroy the
26:37
art you stole it that is weird
26:40
just been reading gonna be a depot which
26:43
is
26:44
exists somewhere in the uk and um a cat
26:46
broke in and it took offence to one of
26:48
the specimens and it just kept knocking
26:50
it off
26:50
and so they're coming every morning and
26:52
it was like put it back up could never
26:54
find his cat
26:54
and it was only like cctv because they
26:57
were like this is really weird why is
26:58
this one specimen always
27:00
always off you brag about the great
27:03
security you've got but there's a cat
27:05
that keeps repeatedly breaking in and
27:06
you can't we know that cats are actually
27:08
very good at that they are good at that
27:10
i've got one last thing which is this is
27:12
a really cool example of security
27:13
in a museum um that this is at the
27:17
museum of english rural life
27:19
and it's a bit of security they didn't
27:20
realize they had uh
27:22
they have within their collection on
27:25
display
27:25
a 150 year old mouse trap and they came
27:29
in one morning
27:30
and sitting inside the mouse trap was a
27:32
mouse
27:33
caught in present day as in in the last
27:36
few years
27:37
um wow and so what it was is while
27:39
they're doing renovations some mice
27:40
managed to get into the museum had
27:42
managed to get
27:43
through the little casing and got caught
27:45
by a mousetrap that had been set and
27:48
built in 1861. that is so cool
27:51
yeah by colin pollinger and sons
27:54
uh of cilsey west sussex and on the side
27:56
of the box it boasts perpetual mousetrap
27:59
will last a lifetime
28:02
longer than someone needs to write in
28:03
longer than yeah before that
28:05
yeah that's super cool that's pretty
28:07
cool one of the silliest things we've
28:08
ever had stolen from the museum
28:10
is um coprolite is done from a dinosaur
28:13
oh yeah
28:14
oh yeah the pusa there's a market for
28:16
that i wonder what he wants to do with
28:18
it
28:18
oh it's just it's the coolest coprolite
28:20
out surely yeah
28:22
exactly exactly no i mean you can get
28:24
any sort of there's a museum of poo in
28:25
the isle of wight did you know that
28:27
no yeah they they freeze they liquid
28:30
nitrogen they freeze these
28:31
poos in spheres
28:35
are they accepting donations apparently
28:38
there's a there's a waiting list
28:39
they're trying to get different animal
28:41
poo and whatever we've been in contact
28:43
so it's not fossilized ancient poo it's
28:44
just a dog food you pick up on the
28:46
street
28:46
and but no no i mean they're not they're
28:48
quite selective okay they shouldn't take
28:50
any old
28:51
it's got to be pedigree pedigree god
28:54
don't want to know what the gift shop
28:55
looks like is it that's not open to the
28:58
public though is it
28:59
what great isle of wight visit here we
29:02
come
29:04
[Music]
29:09
okay it is time for a final fact of the
29:10
show and that is andy
29:12
my fact is that prisoners in siberia
29:14
used to eat prehistoric animals they
29:16
found frozen in the ice
29:19
is that really true so what kind of
29:20
animals mammoths all kinds of animals
29:23
really mammals dinosaurs dinosaurs well
29:26
okay according to
29:27
alexander solzhenitsyn okay he's
29:29
reliable he's very reliable
29:31
he was a prisoner in in siberia for a
29:33
very long time
29:34
a very famous russian author and he
29:35
wrote a book called the gulag
29:36
archipelago
29:37
the idea of this sort of huge chain of
29:39
islands of gulags spread across siberia
29:42
siberia is absolutely enormous and it's
29:43
where russia traditionally sent all of
29:45
its dissidents and
29:46
you know any troublemakers and it's on
29:48
the first page of his book he writes
29:50
about uh
29:51
some prisoners handing over some
29:53
prehistoric squirrels they found ground
29:55
squirrels
29:56
to the camp geologist of the camp they
29:58
were in but he also said that on other
30:00
occasions prisoners had just
30:02
devoured these things on the spot
30:03
because they were so hungry other people
30:05
have disputed it they've said
30:07
there wouldn't be much left of a ground
30:08
squirrel even if it had been frozen it
30:10
would have uh
30:11
you know uh petrified gone very hard so
30:14
he claims it other people have said
30:15
is this possible they get hard like wood
30:17
maybe they were just fish that have been
30:18
stuck in a frozen river
30:20
but it's possible yeah yeah so they've
30:22
been uh
30:23
lots of reports for hundreds of years of
30:25
people eating prehistoric animals
30:27
haven't there which i think
30:28
people say are mostly apocryphal and
30:30
it's often mammoths
30:31
well they did when the baby mammoth so
30:34
when and they defrosted and all the
30:36
blood started leaking out
30:37
there was and i don't know if they
30:39
actually took from that one but they
30:40
have eaten bits of mammoth
30:41
was that the one that was found quite a
30:43
couple of years ago yeah who who were
30:45
they
30:46
the the researchers oh yeah it was like
30:48
a big thing
30:49
and um is that a risky thing to do i
30:52
mean
30:52
if if the if the animal is frozen and
30:54
it's kept
30:55
constantly below zero degrees it's fine
30:58
which doesn't happen basically in the
31:00
environment so that's but if it goes up
31:02
and down in temperatures and it defrosts
31:04
and then refreezes
31:05
yeah that's when you're getting all the
31:06
mold and the bacteria being
31:09
actually frozen into the specimen so
31:10
that's when you can get all sorts of
31:12
craziness but if you heat it in the
31:13
microwave for a minute that's
31:14
fine because the average mammoth is
31:16
gonna fit in a microwave
31:19
there was was it alexei tikenov has
31:21
tried mammoth i think he might have been
31:23
one of the zoologists on that expedition
31:25
well anyway he said he's tasted mammoth
31:27
and it was awful it tasted like meat
31:29
left too long in a freezer
31:30
i mean which
31:32
[Laughter]
31:35
just on things found in ice i read a
31:38
really cool story that in 2010
31:40
researchers were looking in shackleton's
31:43
base camp
31:43
and they found underneath the
31:45
floorboards a crate of
31:47
old whiskey and they brought it up and
31:50
it was frozen
31:50
but when they were defrosting it and
31:52
they were swirling around the bottles
31:53
they could hear liquid inside so the
31:55
whiskey was still
31:56
usable now obviously they were never
31:58
going to drink it but
31:59
the particular whiskey that was there
32:01
was from a company called mckinley
32:03
and they'd lost the recipe since so
32:06
basically we had the recipe again
32:08
of a lost whiskey so what they did was
32:10
they flew it over to scotland
32:12
and there's a new company called wyatt
32:13
and mckay who bought mckinley
32:15
and they put syringes through the cork
32:17
and they managed to get the whiskey out
32:19
and they managed to replicate
32:20
the recipe of what that long-lost
32:23
whiskey
32:24
uh recipe was and they made 50 000
32:26
bottles so they sold it
32:28
as a sort of limited edition 157 dollars
32:31
american per bottle
32:32
it's not unlimited is it yeah you know
32:33
when you get something limited edition
32:35
you think god it's only me and people
32:36
yeah
32:36
the people i guess everything is a
32:38
limited edition is there because no
32:39
one's ever made an infinite number of
32:40
anything yes
32:42
but so then they uh they sent the
32:44
bottles back to
32:45
uh the base so it's still there as part
32:48
of what was
32:49
about what did they call it um oh i
32:51
don't know i think they called it just
32:53
what it was
32:54
okay they didn't call it shackleton no
32:55
they should have the american audience
32:57
would have loved that
32:57
yeah um just on these uh these ancient
33:01
animals that are being
33:01
found in the permafrost and things like
33:03
this yeah um so one
33:05
really useful thing is uh squirrels
33:07
because they
33:08
uh they made nests and they made nests
33:10
of all the local uh flora
33:12
and so it's like a it's like a a densely
33:16
packed
33:16
nest full of the kind of species that
33:19
you would have had growing
33:20
in the ice age it's a frozen heart at
33:22
herbert yeah so you've got all these
33:24
different species just gathered very
33:25
conveniently in one place for the
33:26
scientists to look into an example yeah
33:28
that's great
33:28
and this is the amazing thing uh a few
33:31
years ago in 2012
33:32
scientists grew the most ancient
33:36
living organism multicellular on the
33:38
planet
33:39
it's a plant little plant called cylene
33:41
stenophila
33:42
and it was brought back to life by these
33:44
seeds that the squirrels
33:46
that the squirrels put in their nest the
33:48
seeds were 31.5 000 years old
33:50
and we grew them and they still work and
33:53
now we have lots of these things
33:54
and it's quite beautiful isn't it it's
33:55
sort of a is that that really delicate
33:57
looking white flower
33:58
i think so with a white flower on top
34:00
yeah it's really lovely
34:02
yeah that's incredible can i ask a quick
34:04
question about so has the natural
34:05
history
34:06
museum got a woolly mammoth that's ever
34:08
been um
34:09
sort of thawed out of the ice i don't
34:12
believe we have any
34:14
and the one that came to us to visit and
34:16
everyone got to see
34:17
went back again okay so it's like yeah
34:19
you can look but
34:20
yeah really apparently one percent only
34:22
of the woolly mammoths that get dug out
34:24
of the permafrost or the thor out of the
34:25
permafrost ends up in end up in
34:27
scientific hands
34:28
interestingly um elephant tasks
34:30
assighties
34:31
mammoth tusks aren't
34:43
yeah but you can stop the tusks from
34:45
getting into the wrong hands right you
34:46
could say this is protected as in a
34:47
museum has to happen but
34:49
yeah but we haven't got legislation for
34:50
that really
34:52
on other old foods that have been eaten
34:54
there's
34:55
bog butter bog butter is a way that
34:58
people used to store
34:59
butter and they would put it in bogs
35:01
this is especially in scotland and
35:02
ireland and it would be preserved
35:04
and i think recently we found 300 packs
35:06
of bog butter
35:07
so there was a big uncovering in a swamp
35:09
in ireland
35:10
and it was up to 1400 years old and this
35:15
woman called helen
35:16
lucy burke who i think is a journalist
35:17
went to the museum where all this bog
35:19
butter was on display
35:20
1400 years old and it was being
35:22
suspended on a plinth
35:23
and it's yeah it's like cheesy lardy
35:25
butter and she just grabbed a bit of it
35:27
and ate it
35:28
which is quite cool and she said it
35:30
wasn't disgusting it wasn't very nice it
35:31
was cheesy
35:32
ripe and athlete's footy i mean but that
35:35
sentence would be disgusting enough if
35:36
you had a friend who just grabbed a
35:38
bunch of butter
35:39
and started eating it so like what did
35:41
she have it on anything did she have
35:42
toast with her just on its own i think
35:44
it was quite solidified by that point
35:46
maybe
35:46
oh right like a biscuit i quite like
35:48
butter just bites yeah but you wouldn't
35:49
just stick your hair
35:51
really yeah you're kidding i just it's
35:53
one of those things
35:54
a cat i see i don't like chocolate i
35:57
like butter
35:58
oh really which is healthier just eating
36:00
chocolate just eating butter
36:01
both are bad don't fart they're good in
36:04
small amounts
36:04
it's not like i have like a pack of
36:06
butter who would die first
36:08
you only allowed to eat butter or me
36:09
only allowed to eat chocolate well at
36:10
this rate chocolate's dying out so you
36:12
would have the worst sauce
36:14
what chocolates dying out the problem
36:16
isn't there is because the pollinator is
36:18
dying out
36:18
and you know what the pollinator is it's
36:20
a fly
36:22
is it one specific flight well we think
36:24
there's about 14 species we don't know
36:25
well can't you bring them back isn't
36:27
this what you do no it's you're creating
36:28
a habitat problem for them i don't blame
36:30
me
36:30
i'm just saying as you people are with
36:32
your mass demand of chocolate
36:34
you've gone out there and you're like
36:35
okay let's say our monocultures
36:37
the adults have come along and they're
36:38
like oh don't like this oh so
36:40
they're genuinely like this is limited
36:42
stock like this is just grab your
36:44
chocolate now
36:45
stick it in a bog and then you'll be
36:47
fine okay wow
36:49
there is very interesting by the way uh
36:50
mosquitoes flies yes
36:52
okay yeah i thought that might be
36:54
something else is it daddy long legs a
36:55
fly
36:56
ah what are you calling a daddy long
36:57
legs oh there are two aren't there i
36:59
know there's three now they've added the
37:00
third one just fun
37:02
so you know this is why i shouldn't use
37:03
common names or anything so you've got
37:05
the daddy long legs the flying thing
37:06
which is a crane fly true flight that's
37:08
the one
37:09
the second one is a pillions which are
37:10
harvest men and the third type is the
37:12
daddy long leg spider
37:15
which is the one that it's used to be
37:16
called a cell spider it's the one that
37:18
hangs around in your living room i
37:19
always fight
37:20
yeah okay and that can't fly either no
37:22
but that's a spider so that is venomous
37:24
are there any spiders that can fly
37:26
nope unless they're using phoretic
37:28
behavior oh
37:30
i'm kind of lying because balloon
37:32
spiders
37:33
they balloon so they exist oh yeah so
37:35
they can get up into
37:36
really high up wait hang on how did what
37:38
they float up like
37:39
they were still it's the celtics do you
37:41
remember oh yeah
37:43
the reverse parachutes yeah they go
37:45
that's like saying
37:46
we can fly isn't it that's like saying
37:47
we can fly because we climb up we rope
37:49
climb
37:50
or build yeah because they're using
37:52
threats
37:54
literally released into the wind yeah
37:55
and and because it's so thin and they're
37:57
so small
37:58
the viscosity of the air is such that
38:00
they can go
38:01
and it's them if i the only equivalent
38:04
is if i let out my sperm whale
38:06
sperm and that caught the wind and
38:08
dragged me to the
38:09
end before usain bolt got there you rode
38:12
on it
38:12
yeah exactly through the extraordinary
38:14
scenes at today's olympics
38:23
okay that's it that's all of our facts
38:25
